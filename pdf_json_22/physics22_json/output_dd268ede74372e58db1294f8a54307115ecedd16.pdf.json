            "text": "Spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnets have attracted much attention recently.\nThe combination of strong geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuations leads to a va-\nriety of exotic quantum states in these materials, such as quantum spin liquids, [1\u20134] in-\ntrinsic quantum Ising magnets, [5\u201311] quantum spin state transitions, [12\u201316] and so on.\nAmong them, the quantum spin liquid (QSL) state proposed by P. W. Anderson in 1973,\n[17] in which the spins remain liquid-like without showing any long-range magnetic order\neven at absolute zero temperature, has been intensively studied in past decades. A QSL\nstate can host long-range spin entanglements, topological orders, and fractional spin exci-\ntations known as spinons, which holds great potential for quantum communication and\ncomputation.\nNumerous experimental efforts have been devoted to the explorations of QSL mate-\nrials in spin-1/2 quantum magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions in a triangular net-\nwork of magnetic ions. [18] For example, the triangular-lattice Yb-based antiferromagnets\nYbMgGaO 4 , NaYbO2, NaYbS2, and NaYbSe2 with effective spin-1/2 for Yb\n3+ ions have\nbeen proposed as QSL candidates. [19\u201325] However, confirming a genuine QSL state in\nthese compounds is challenging, as the existence of either structural disorder or anisotropic\nspin interactions in them usually results in a spin glass or magnetically disordered ground\nstate, which is difficult to be distinguished from the QSL state.\nVery recently, Na2BaCo(PO4)2 (NBCPO) crystallizing in a trigonal structure (space\ngroup P3\u0305m1 ), in which the Co2+ ions (Kramers ions with electronic configuration 3d 7\nand effective S = 1/2) reside on a perfect triangular lattice, has drawn a great deal of\ninterests. [16,26\u201328] As reported by Zhong et al . and Lee et al ., no long-range magnetic\norder was observed in NBCPO by neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation meas-\nurements, down to 300 mK and 80 mK, respectively. [26,27] In addition, inelastic neutron\nscattering and thermal transport experiments on NBCPO revealed a low-energy magnetic\ncontinuum indicative of spinon excitations and a nonzero residual thermal conductivity,\nrespectively, supporting a QSL-like state. [16,26] However, the heat capacity measure-\nment by Li et al. unraveled a weak antiferromagnetic order at TN ~ 148mK in NBCPO. [16] So far, it is still controversial about the exact magnetic ground state of NBCPO, ne-\ncessitating further experimental investigations on this novel material and its structural\nderivatives.\nCompared with the Yb-based triangular-lattice antiferromagnets, NBCPO is be-\nlieved to possess no structural disorder and dominant isotropic exchange interactions, so\nthat it is considered to be in close proximity to an S = 1/2 triangular Heisenberg antifer-\nromagnet, the first conceptual model system historically proposed to realize the QSL\nstate. As the magnetic interactions strongly depend on the atomic distances between mag-\nnetic ions, structural modifications to NBCPO by means of chemical substitutions or ap-\nplying physical pressure will provide a way for tuning its magnetic properties and under-\nstanding the correlations between the structure and the magnetism.\nIn this paper, we have performed a fine tuning of the crystal structure of NBCPO by\nsystematic chemical substitution of Sr for Ba. Using solid state reaction method, poly-\ncrystalline samples of Na2Ba1-xSrxCo(PO4)2 (NBSCPO) were synthesized. Detailed structural characterizations of the NBSCPO samples were carried out by complementary\nx-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements. Rietveld refinements to the diffrac-\ntion patterns revealed that the trigonal structure is stable at low Sr doping levels (x \u2264 0.3),\nand a pure monoclinic phase with slight rotations of CoO6 octahedra and displacements of Ba2+/Sr2+ ions is formed at high Sr doping levels (x \u2265 0.6). The lattice constants and the atomic distances between the Co2+ ions shrink with increasing Sr doping in both phase\nregimes. At intermediate Sr doping levels (0.4 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5), the trigonal and monoclinic\nphases coexist. The doping-induced structural transformation in NBSCPO is supported\nby first-principles calculations and Raman spectroscopy. The dc magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements reveal the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 2 K in\nNa2SrCo(PO4)2 (NSCPO), which is a novel monoclinic-distorted spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with less geometrical frustration, and the robustness of magnetic exchange interaction\nagainst the Ba/Sr substitutions."

A stoichiometric mixture of\ndried Na2CO3 (99.99%), BaCO3 (99.95%), SrCO3 (99.95%), CoO (99%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (99.99%) was ground well together with the catalyst NH4Cl (99.99%) in the molar ratio of 2:1, pressed into pellets, sintered in air at 700 \u00b0C for 24 h in alumina cruci-\nbles, and finally cooled down to room temperature. The sintering process was repeated\nfor three times to minimize the impurity phases.\nStructural characterizations of the polycrystalline samples of NBSCPO were per-\nformed using both x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) meas-\nurements. The XRD patterns on all samples were collected using a Bruker D8 diffractom-\neter in Bragg-Brentano geometry with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) at room\ntemperature in a range of 10-100\u25e6. The NPD experiments were carried out on the time-\nof-flight (TOF) diffractometer GPPD (General Purpose Powder Diffractometer) at China\nSpallation Neutron Source (CSNS), Dongguan, China. [29] Samples with the mass around\n1.6-1.8 g were loaded into vanadium containers, and the neutron diffraction patterns were\ncollected at room temperature with wavelength band from 0.1 to 4.9 \u00c5. The program Full-\nProf was used for the Rietveld refinement of the crystal structures of all compounds.[30]\nThe Raman spectra of NBCPO and NSCPO were collected under ambient conditions\nusing a commercial confocal Raman microscope, alpha 300R WITec system (WITec\nGmbH, Ulm, Germany). A continuous-wave 532 nm laser was utilized as the excitation,\nand a 100\u00d7 short-working-distance objective lens with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.95\nwas used to focus the laser and collect signals.\nMagnetic properties of polycrystalline Na2BaCo(PO4)2 (x=0) and\nNa2SrCo(PO4)2 (x = 1) were characterized using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS). The temperature dependence of the dc magnetic suscep-\ntibility was measured during warming from 2 K to 300 K in an applied magnetic field of\n1000 Oe under the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) condition.\nFirst-principles calculations have been carried out based on the density-functional\ntheory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)\n[31,32] , using the projector augmented wave method [33] and Perdew-Burke- Ernzerhof\n(PBE) exchange-correlation functional approach [34]. The plane-wave cutoff energy was\nset to 320 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh [35] of size 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2 was used for the\nBZ sampling.\nThe crystal electric field (CEF) of NBCPO and NSCPO were calculated by con-\nstructing and solving a point-charge model with the information of ligand environment\nas implemented in PyCrystalField package [36] and the structural parameters deter-\nmined experimentally."

At low Sr doping levels (x \u2264 0.3), all\nthe diffraction peaks can be well indexed using the trigonal structure as reported for\nundoped NBCPO in Ref. 26, showing only the peak shifting associated with the lattice contraction due to substitutions of Sr2+ (ionic radius 1.36 \u00c5) for Ba2+ (ionic radius 1.61\n\u00c5). At high Sr doping levels (x \u2265 0.6), numbers of reflections split and additional weak\nreflections emerge, suggesting a symmetry lowering from trigonal to monoclinic, as sup-\nported by the Rietveld refinements represented below. For instance, as shown in Fig. 1(b)\nand Fig. 1(d), the (110)t reflection and its equivalents in trigonal notation splits into the\n(310)m and (020)m reflections in monoclinic notation, and additional weak reflections\nmarked by asterisks including (203)m, (113)m and (311)m appear. The patterns for x \u2265\n0.6 fit well with a structure with a monoclinic distortion together with a tiny amount of\nSr2P2O5 impurity formed in the sintering process. The appearance of the weak reflections indexed with (H K odd)m indicates the doubling of lattice constant c related to the trig-\nonal-monoclinic transformation, which will be discussed in details later. At intermediate\nSr doping levels (0.4 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5), the trigonal phase can still be identified in the diffraction\npatterns, in addition to the emergent monoclinic phase, giving rise to a coexistence of two\nstructural phases in these compositions.\nThe XRD and NPD patterns of all samples collected at room temperature are sim-\nultaneously refined using the Rietveld refinement program FullProf suite. Fig. 2 shows\nthe refinement results of Na2Ba1-xSrxCo(PO4)2 for x = 0 (a and b), 0.3 (c and d), 0.6 (e and f) and 1 (g and h). The Sr doping-induced structural transformation from trigonal to\nmonoclinic symmetry is clearly visible, as shown in the insets, evidenced by the splitting\nof a single (110)t reflection (a-d) into (310)m and (020)m reflections (e-f) as well as the\nemergence of a nearby (311)m reflection (e-f). Note that the asymmetric peak profiles in\nthe XRD patterns is due to the combined contributions from both Cu-K\u03b11 and Cu-K\u03b12 radiations with the intensity ratio of 2:1, leading to a doublet of peaks for the (110)t\nreflection (a and c) and quartet of peaks for the (310)m/(020)m reflection pair (e and g).\nThe Sr-doping induced structural transformation from trigonal to monoclinic sym-\nmetry is illustrated in Fig. 3. All samples of Na2Ba1-xSrxCo(PO4)2 are found to adopt the glaserite-type XY2M(TO4)2 structure [37] in which the Na, Ba/Sr, Co and P sites are coordinated by 10, 12/10, 6 and 4 O2- ions, respectively. The structure of a pure NBCPO (x\n= 0) determined here by x-ray and neutron powder diffraction is very similar to that deter-\nmined by single-crystal XRD in Ref. 26, with the CoO6 octahedra forming a perfect triangular network in the ab plane (see Fig. 3(a)). These magnetic layers are separated by a single layer of nonmagnetic BaO12 polyhedral, with the PO4 tetrahedra and Na + ions filling the remaining space. As is shown in Fig. 3(c) viewed from the c axis, each CoO6 octahedron is linked to six undistorted corner-shared PO4 tetrahedra, showing a threefold rotational symmetry in accord with the \ud835\udc433\u0305\ud835\udc5a1 space group. In addition, the Ba2+ ions locate exactly at the center position of neighboring Co2+ ions along the c direction, yield-\ning a 180\u00b0 Co-Ba-Co angle.\nThe introduction of Sr dopants, however, tends to induce some lattice distortions,\ndue to the considerable difference of ionic radius between Sr2+ (r = 1.36 \u00c5) and Ba2+ (r =\n1.61 \u00c5). As a response, the CoO6 octahedra in neighboring layers rotate slightly in opposite directions, which doubles the lattice constant c, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) for a pure\nNSCPO (x = 1). The slight rotation of the CoO6 octahedra also distorted the PO4 tetrahedra linked with them (Fig. 3(d). Furthermore, the Sr2+ ions show some displacements in the ab plane, away from the center position of neighboring Co2+ ions on adjacent magnetic\nlayers. The polyhedral distortions and ionic displacements induced by Sr doping break\nthe threefold rotational symmetry, leading to a symmetry lowering from trigonal to mon-\noclinic.\nSuch a trigonal-monoclinic structural transformation involves the change of the unit\ncell. As shown in Fig. 3, associated with the symmetry lowering, the in-plane and out-of-\nplane lattice constants transform into am \u2248 \u221a3at, bm \u2248 bt , and cm \u2248 2ct, respectively, with the subscript m and t denoting the monoclinic and trigonal notation. This unit cell con-\nversion and the symmetry lowering account for the splitting of overlapped equivalent\n(110)t/(1\u030520)t reflection into non-equivalent (020)m and (310)m upon Sr doping, as well\nas the absence of correspondence for (H K odd)m reflection in trigonal symmetry,\nconsidering the conversion rule of Hm = Kt \u2212 Ht, Km = Kt + Ht, and Lm = 2Lt.\nIn Table 1, we have listed the structural parameters of NSCPO (x = 1) determined by\nsimultaneous refinements of both the x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns. This com-\npound, which was never reported before, crystallizes in the monoclinic symmetry with\nthe space group of P21/a. We note that this glaserite-type structure with the same space group was ever reported for Na2SrMg(PO4)2, which contains nonmagnetic 3d Mg 2+ ions.\n[38] Compared with NBCPO, the unit cell of NSCPO is four times large in volume. As a\nresult of monoclinic distortion, the unique Co site in a trigonal lattice evolves into two\ncrystallographically nonequivalent sites, denoted as Co1 (2a) and Co2 (2d), respectively, with their surrounding CoO6 octahedra rotating in opposite directions.\nThe evolution of room-temperature lattice parameters with Sr doping is shown in\nFig. 4(a) and 4(b). Both the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters are found to decrease with the introduction of Sr dopants. This is consistent with the fact that the Sr2+ ions are considerably smaller than the Ba2+ ions. Such a lattice contraction will also lead\nto a decrease of both interlayer and intralayer Co-Co distances and accordingly that of\nthe magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, as stated above, the substitution of Sr2+ for Ba2+ distorts the unit cell from the trigonal symmetry. In the monoclinic regime,\nalong the c axis, the Co1-Ba/Sr-Co2 bond angle gradually deviates from 180\u25e6, as shown in Fig. 4(b), finally reaching 166.3\u25e6 for the pure NSCPO (x = 1), which suggests a size-\nable in-plane displacement of Ba/Sr ions associated with the trigonal-monoclinic struc-\ntural transformation. In addition, the in-plane Co1-Co1-Co1 bond angle shrinks continuously from 60\u25e6 for a perfect triangular lattice when entering the monoclinic regime. Such a doping-induced distortion of the triangular network of Co2+ ions (with the Co1Co1-Co1 angle of 59.54\u25e6 for NSCPO), although slight, will help to release some geometrical frustration and might result in a different magnetic ground state.\nThe symmetry lowering in NSCPO compared with NBCPO is also evidenced by\nthe Raman spectroscopy. According to the factor-group analysis for the space group of\n\ud835\udc433\u0305\ud835\udc5a1 (trigonal symmetry) performed using the program SAM from the Bilbao Crys-\ntallographic Server [39], 11 Raman active modes in total are allowed for NBCPO.\nEspecially, four normal phonon modes of the PO4 tetrahedra at high wavenumbers (> 400 cm-1) are expected for such phosphates with glaserite-type structure [40], including the symmetric stretching vibration mode around 1000 cm-1, symmetric bending vibration mode around 440 cm-1, asymmetric stretching vibration mode around 1120 cm-1, and asymmetric bending vibration mode around 590 cm-1, well consistent with the positions of Raman peaks in the range of 400-1200 cm-1 observed for NBCPO as shown\nin Fig. 5. However, for NSCPO, these four peaks marked by 1-4 become clearly broad-\nened and asymmetric, suggesting the emergence of multiple modes with close energies\nthat can not be resolved within the instrument resolution. Such a peak broadening for\nNSCPO is fully in accord with the fact that the PO4 tetrahedra become distorted due to slight rotations of CoO6 octahedra and the corresponding internal P-O bond lengths become non-equivalent in the monoclinic phase, thus further corroborating the symmetry\nlowering in NSCPO compared with NBCPO.\nFurthermore, the structural stabilities of trigonal NBCPO and monoclinic NSCPO\nare checked by performing first-principles calculations. The experimentally determined\nlattice constants of both compounds were adopted for single-point energy calculations.\nBased on lattice relaxation calculations, the lattice constants are optimized to a = 9.606\n\u00c5, b = 5.432 \u00c5, c = 13.707 \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u25e6, \u03b2 = 89.751\u25e6 for a possible monoclinic phase\nof NBCPO and a = 5.280 \u00c5, c = 6.765 \u00c5 for a possible trigonal phase of NSCPO. By\ndirectly comparing the free energy of the monoclinic unit cell and the \u221a3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 trigonal\nsupercell with comparable volumes, our DFT calculations confirm that the trigonal\nphase of NBCPO and the monoclinic phase of NSCPO are structurally more stable, as\nshown in Table II. This is well consistent with our experiment observations that\nNBSCPO undergoes a Sr doping-induced structural transformation from trigonal to\nmonoclinic symmetry.\nIn order to check the effect of such a structural transformation on the magnetic\nproperties, we have analyzed the alignment of energy levels of Co2+ ions for both\nNBCPO and NSCPO. According to the CEF theory [41], both the CEF effect HCEF= \u2211 Bn mOn m n,m and the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) HSOC =\u03bb\u0303S\u2219L should be considered in the Hamiltonian for 3d transition-metal ions, as they are of a similar magnitude. Here On m are the Stevens operators, Bn m are multiplicative factors called CEF parameters, n is the operator degree constrained by time-reversal symmetry to be even, m is the\noperator order with -n \u2264 m \u2264 n, S is the spin angular momentum, and L is orbital angular momentum, respectively. For Co2+ ions, it is necessary to treat both the CEF and\nSOC non-perturbatively in the so-called intermediate coupling scheme, in which HCEF acts only on L. For free Co2+ ions with the electronic configuration of 3d7, the ground state is 4F, which splits into three energy levels (\u03932, \u03935, and \u03934) in a predominantly cubic-symmetry crystal field, as shown in Fig. 6. The \u03932 state can be represented by the fictitious orbital angular momentum L \u0303= 1 and the spin angular momentum S = 3/2. Un-\nder the action of SOC, the (2L \u0303+1)(2S + 1) = 3(2S + 1) manifold of states splits into a\nseries of energy levels characterized by an effective quantum number J\u0303 =1/2, 3/2 and\n5/2. For NBCPO with trigonal symmetry, the trigonal distortion naturally splits the J\u0303 = 3/2 states of Co2+ ions into two well-separated energy levels. For NSCPO with mono-\nclinic symmetry, the cubic-symmetry crystal field is fully distorted into a lower-symmetry centrosymmetric field acting on the two non-equivalent Co2+ sites (Co1 and Co2), as a consequence, enhancing the CEF splitting as well. Utilizing a point-charge model,\nthe CEF energy levels can be calculated (see Table III for the CEF parameters). The atomic SOC strength of Co is taken as the effective SOC constant ?\u0303? of Co2+ ions [42].\nAlthough our na\u00efve calculation might overestimate the CEF splitting, such an estimation on the order of magnitude of the CEF splitting of 102 K can be trusted. Therefore, even though the CEF environment of the Co2+ ions in NSCPO is more complicated compared\nwith that in NBCPO due to its lower crystallographic symmetry, the ground state of\nNSCPO composing of the lowest-energy Kramer doublets can still be safely treated as\nan effective J\u0303 =1/2 state at low temperatures, similar to the case in NBCPO.\nFinally, the magnetic property of the polycrystalline NSCPO with the monoclinic\nstructure has been characterized using magnetization measurements, and compared with\nthat of polycrystalline NBCPO with the trigonal structure. As the CEF from the surrounding CoO6 octahedra and the SOC can result in a Kramers doublet for the Co 2+ ions, a ground state with effective S = 1/2 is expected for both NBCPO and NSCPO. As\nshown in Fig. 5(a), the dc magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) of NSCPO does not exhibit any\nfeature of long-range magnetic order down to 2 K. However, its inverse (1/\u03c7) shows a\nchange of slope around 50 K. By doing the Curie-Weiss fitting to the high-temperature\n(200 < T < 300 K) and low-temperature (2 < T < 20 K) parts, the effective moment of Co2+ ions are estimated to be 5.14 \u03bc B and 4.10 \u03bc B , respectively, suggesting the change of its spin from a high-temperature S = 3/2 state to the low-temperature effective S =\n1/2 ground state. The Curie-Weiss temperature, \u03b8cw, is determined to be -2.94 K for\nNSCPO from the low-temperature fitting, suggesting an antiferromagnetic interaction\nwithin the triangular Co network. Similar analysis of the dc magnetic susceptibility of\npolycrystalline NBCPO (Fig. 5(b)) yields the effective moments of 5.31 \u03bc B and 3.96\n\u03bc B for Co\n2+ ions at high and low temperatures, respectively, as well as the Curie-Weiss\ntemperature of \u03b8cw = -2.82 K, which is well consistent with the values determined from\nsingle-crystal NBCPO. [16] Therefore, the dominant antiferromagnetic exchange en-\nergy (J) in monoclinic NSCPO and trigonal NBCPO is comparable, as J is proportional\nto \u03b8cw, according to the mean field theory, suggesting the robustness of magnetic ex-\nchange interaction against the Ba/Sr substitutions. However, as monoclinic NSCPO dis-\nplays less geometrical frustration compared with trigonal NBCPO, a higher antiferro-\nmagnetic ordering temperature than TN ~ 148mK (for NBCPO) is expected to be observed below 2 K for NSCPO, if the Co2+ spins order. Further measurements at ex-\ntremely low temperatures for NSCPO in both polycrystalline and single-crystal forms\nare still ongoing to clarify its magnetic ground state for comparison with the QSL can-\ndidate NBCPO, which is helpful for tuning the intriguing magnetic interactions to real-\nize exotic quantum states in the family of such spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromag-\nnets. (Fig. 7).\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, using x-ray and neutron powder diffraction as complementary meth-\nods, we have investigated the structural evolution of Na2Ba1-xSrxCo(PO4)2 (NBSCPO), a spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet as a quantum spin liquid candidate, with\nthe chemical doping of Sr. The trigonal and monoclinic phase are found to be structur-\nally stable at low (x \u2264 0.3) and high (x \u2265 0.6) Sr doping levels, and they coexist at\nintermediate doping levels. The doping-induced trigonal-monoclinic structural trans-\nformation is accompanied by slight rotations of CoO6 octahedra and sizeable displacements of Ba2+/Sr2+ ions, leading to a lattice contraction and accordingly a\ndecrease of both interlayer and intralayer Co-Co distances. Such a doping-induced\nstructural transformation in NBSCPO is supported by our first-principles calculations\nand Raman spectroscopy. The dc magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a com-\nparable antiferromagnetic exchange energy for the end members, NSCPO and NBCPO.\nThe monoclinically-distorted NSCPO does not show any long-range magnetic order\ndown to 2 K and a similar negative Curie-Weiss temperature as Na2BaCo(PO4)2 with a perfect triangular lattice, suggesting the robustness of magnetic exchange interaction\nagainst the Ba/Sr substitutions."
