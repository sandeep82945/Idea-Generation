    "abstractText": "Lewis/Br\u00f8nsted acidic deep eutectic solvents (LBDESs) are a recent class of solvents that combine the two types of acidity. In some cases, this synergy leads to enhanced catalytic properties for many reactions and applications. For this reason, it is important to discover more LBDESs. In this work, we prepared and characterized four different zinc(II)-based LBDESs, mixing ZnCl2 and various Br\u00f8nsted acids: acetic, glycolic, levulinic, and formic acids. Apart from the latter, for which the corresponding DES is not thermally stable, the samples have been characterized in terms of density, viscosity, and conductivity. Notably, as zinc(II) is a diamagnetic metal, all of them are suitable for NMR spectroscopy, for example, for kinetic and mechanistic studies.",

            "text": "Zinc(II) is acidic in nature, as the 4s and 4p orbitals are empty and available for coordination [1], whereas the 3d orbitals are full and, unlike many other late transition metals, redox-stable. This makes zinc(II) salts good catalysts for many reactions [2]: among others, we can remember the Friedel\u2013Craft benzylation of benzenes [3], the Biginelli reaction [4], alkyne hydrogenation to alkenes [5], activation of CO2 [6], trans-amidation [7], and trans-esterification [8]. The latter has been also extended to polyester synthesis and degradation [9\u201311]. In the last few years, zinc(II) salts (generally chloride salts) have been used also for the preparation of acidic deep eutectic solvents (aDESs) [12]. In general, a DES is a mixture of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (HBDs and HBAs, respectively) whose melting point is much lower than the value expected for an ideal mixture [13]. They recently found application in various fields, such as organic synthesis [14\u201316], metal deposition [17], extractive desulfurization [18], and CO2 capture [19,20]. DESs are usually prepared by heating (with conventional heating or microwave reactors [21]) the mixture of the precursors until a homogeneous liquid mixture is obtained, or in some cases by freeze-drying or evaporating the solvent in which the desired components are dissolved [22]. Their physicochemical and thermal properties have been extensively studied in view of orienting future applications [23\u201326]. In particular, the use of Zn(II) salts (generally chloride) as DES precursors enabled the preparation of new solvents for (i) cyclic voltammetry (with choline chloride [27]), (ii) electrolytes in zinc aqueous batteries (with lactic acid [28]), (iii) the fractionation of lignin (with acetamide [29]), (iv) cellulose dissolution (with water and formic acid [30]), and (v) the depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (with urea [31]) and polyethylene (with lactic acid [32,33]).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8054. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28248054 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8054 2 of 13\nNotably, the combination of ZnCl2 and acetic acid was known and characterized in 1939 [34] and used in different contexts [35,36]. This mixture, in fact, has peculiar properties and presents advantages with respect to the common use of the catalyst Zn acetate, as Zn acetate lacks any Br\u00f8nsted acidity, and the presence of chloride ions of ZnCl2 could influence the solubility of many chemical species through the instauration of chemical equilibria or weak interactions. In view of all these applications, the preparation of new Zn(II)-based DESs and their in-depth characterization proves to be a topic of recognized interest. This class of DESs presents the additional advantage of the possible synergy between Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acids (LBDES), which has been already assessed in a few cases [28,33,37\u201343], and more potential applications will be explored in the future. As is evident from some of these references, in some cases, the zinc-based solvent is catalytically active, meaning that one of the components of the DES directly enters into the mechanism of the reaction, lowering its activation barrier. Furthermore, unlike paramagnetic LBDESs based on iron, cobalt, or nickel, in the case of Zn(II)-based DESs, NMR spectroscopy can be used, for example, to study the kinetics of a reaction or better characterize the solute\u2013solvent interactions, as has already been done for metal-free DESs [44]. For all these reasons, we report here the preparation and characterization of four LBDESs, based on zinc(II) and various Br\u00f8nsted acids. Other diamagnetic metal salts have been tested, such as aluminum(III), zirconium(IV), and tin(II), but with these metals, we could not obtain a homogeneous liquid mixture. For the stable LBDESs (i.e., the ones formed using acetic, glycolic, and levulinic acids with ZnCl2), in-depth physicochemical characterization is provided in terms of viscosity, conductivity, and density. It is worth noting that the DES preparation was performed without the elimination of water traces from the precursors, to reproduce the conditions required for their application. In fact, for interesting applications, such as PET [37,42] or cellulose [45] hydrolysis, at least a small amount of water has to be present in the system. Overall, this study represents a necessary starting point for future applications of these systems in different fields."

            "text": "Given the versatility of iron(III)-based LBDESs [37], we confidently began mixing d0 and d10 transition metal salts with different carboxylic and sulfonic acids. Beyond the diamagnetic properties, all the metal salts we used are known for forming eutectic mixtures. For example, ZrOCl2\u00b78H2O is a known precursor for acidic DESs [12], and generally, its acidity is due to the protons of water coordinated to the zirconium (Br\u00f8nsted-type), rather than directly to the metal (Lewis-type). Regarding the organic acid, we tested a wide variety of substances, varying not only the strength, but also the presence of additional functional groups. In addition to this, only widespread and cheap acids have been tested, given that a solvent cannot be made of expensive components if practical applications are desired. Unfortunately, only a few combinations successfully led to the formation of a clear, homogeneous liquid, without an evident pattern. Table 1 shows the (few) LBDESs successfully prepared and the (many) unsuccessful combinations.\na unstable liquids; b MSA = methanesulfonic acid; c pTSA = para-toluenesulfonic acid.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8054 3 of 13\nSome LA/LB mixtures, such as ZrOCl2\u00b78H2O/MSA or SnCl2/glycolic acids, became unstable with time, meaning that after some hours they became heterogeneous again. For practical applications, this may not be a problem, especially if heating is required, but the characterization is difficult because the liquid tends to form a solid phase during the measurements. For these reasons, only zinc(II)-based LBDESs, which were stable for 24 h or longer, have been characterized here. Prior to performing the evaluation of the samples\u2019 properties, we estimated the amount of water present in each sample by performing Karl Fischer titrations and/or thermogravimetric analysis on the precursors. It is worth noting that water traces were not eliminated a priori from the precursors, to reproduce the conditions required for their application. Considering the water content of the single components (see Section 3), DES1\u20134 have approximately the following water content: 12,000, 30,000, 20,000, and 16,000 ppm, respectively, corresponding to 1.2%, 3%, 2%, and 1.6% of the total sample mass. More details on the calculation of water content are reported in Section 3, but it is worth remembering that the precise water content can vary from sample to sample, as it depends on exact reaction conditions and air exposure. In addition, we noticed that DES4 showed instability during heating with gas evolution; therefore, in this case, the full characterization was unfeasible. In order to determine the nature of the evolved gas, two reactions have been hypothesized:\nHypothesis 1. ZnCl2+ HCOOH ZnCl(HCOO) + HCl\u2191\nHypothesis 2. ZnCl2+ HCOOH ZnCl2(H2O) + CO\u2191\nDuring the heating, the evolved gas was collected, passed through a glass tube, and bubbled in an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (100 g/L), but no AgCl formed. In a different experiment, the glass tube was filled with CaCl2, to dry the gas, and then I2O5. The immediate formation of a purple phase (I2) upon gas/I2O5 contact (Figure S1) revealed the presence of a reducing gas, which confirmed hypothesis 2. This is coherent with the known dehydration of formic acid upon contact with drying agents such as H2SO4 or P2O5. In our case, \u201canhydrous\u201d ZnCl2 acted as a drying agent. The release of CO makes the use of this DES unpractical for security reasons."

Later, we studied the viscosity dependence on temperature at a fixed shear rate (10 Hz, Figure 4b).\nThe viscosity (\u03b7) values obtained follow the same trend as that observed with density (DES2 > DES3 > DES1), and also in this case, the measured values are remarkably different from those of the pure acid precursors (\u03b7 of acetic acid at 298.15 K [47]: 1.115 mPa\u00b7s; \u03b7 of levulinic acid at 308.15 K [48]: 18 mPa\u00b7s), suggesting the establishment of interactions among the precursors which significantly decrease the overall system mobility, i.e., the formation of head-to-tail hydrogen-bonded aggregates. It is worth noticing that the high values of DES2 and DES3 hamper their use in many room-temperature applications because the high viscosity of the solvent slows down the mass and heat transfer of any process. In these cases, an increase in the reaction temperature or the addition of a proper amount of cosolvent (which reduces viscosity without breaking the DES structure) may be evaluated.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8054 7 of 13\nThe rheological behavior of the samples was mathematically evaluated using the Ostwald\u2013de Waele power-law equation (Equation (7)). The fitting procedure (Figure S2) showed that DES1 had n = 0.999 \u00b1 0.001; thus, the power-law flow index can be approximated as 1, and the viscosity can be considered constant in the entire shear rate range, with a Newtonian behavior. On the contrary, the other two samples presented a reduction in viscosity at a higher shear rate, with a power-law flow index of 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 for DES2 and 0.955 \u00b1 0.001 for DES3. This behavior denoted a shear-thinning behavior of these fluids. In a second assessment, the viscosity at a fixed shear rate (10 Hz) was measured in the range 288.15\u2013333.15 K. The dependence of viscosity on temperature can be described satisfactorily with a simple exponential decay in the entire temperature range (as proposed by the Arrhenius equation, Equation (8)). The data were fitted with the Arrhenius equation in a selected temperature range in order to determine the activation energy of the process (Table 4)."

In the case of ZnCl2/formic acid, the LBDES was stable at room temperature but unstable under heating, releasing carbon monoxide, and it has been discarded for safety. The other three systems, ZnCl2/acetic acid, ZnCl2/glycolic acid, and ZnCl2/levulinic acid, were stable and safe to use. In particular, their nature as deep eutectic solvents has been demonstrated by comparing ideal and experimental melting points, and they have been characterized by means of density, conductivity, and viscosity in the range of 15\u201360 \u25e6C. The Br\u00f8nsted acid very effectively tuned all the properties of the liquid, giving a wide range of choices for potential applications. In the case of glycolic acid, experimental data suggest that head-to-tail aggregates can be present in the solution. The combined Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acidity of these DESs is potentially useful for many acid- or zinc-catalyzed reactions, with the added benefit that NMR techniques can be used for kinetic or in-depth characterization studies.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28248054/s1: Figure S1: A glass tube containing I2O5 after contact with the gas produced by DES4 (ZnCl2/formic acid).
