Edwards School of Medicine, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, United States, 2 Hershel \u2018Woody\u2019 Williams Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Huntington, WV, United States\nAdolescence is characterized as a period of increased social behavior, risk taking, and novelty seeking, partly due to ongoing maturation in critical brain areas and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) negative-feedback system. During this period there is heightened vulnerability to stress that can drive neuro-immune-endocrine remodeling, resulting in the emergence of maladaptive behaviors that increase susceptibility to alcohol and substance abuse. Here we used a rat model to investigate the impact of chronic adolescent unpredictable stress on a battery of behavioral measures to assess anxiety, novelty seeking, risk taking, depression, and voluntary ethanol consumption while determining whether the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone can attenuate these effects. Adolescent female rats that experienced stress showed increased risk taking behavior and novelty seeking behavior with no change in ethanol consumption. The administration of rosiglitazone during stress induction attenuated stress-induced cortisol elevation, normalized risk taking behavior in a model anxiety, and attenuated novelty seeking in a task-specific manner. Depressive-like behavior was not impacted by adolescent unpredictable stress or the administration of rosiglitazone. The results from this study demonstrate that exposure to unpredictable stress during adolescence increases the prevalence of maladaptive behaviors that are known to increase susceptibility to alcohol and substance abuse, and that rosiglitazone may be an effective therapeutic to attenuate the emergence of select risk taking and novelty seeking behaviors in females.\nKeywords: unpredictable stress, adolescence, rosiglitazone, novelty seeking, anxiety\nINTRODUCTION\nAdolescence is characterized as a period of increased social behavior, risk taking, and novelty seeking in both humans and rodents (Spear, 2000). This is in part due to critical brain areas, important for top down inhibitory control, still undergoing development and maturation (Crews et al., 2007), and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) negative-feedback system still being\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 830310\nestablished and refined (Engel and Gunnar, 2020). Due to the enhanced plasticity of the brain during this phase of maturation, it has been described as a critical period of vulnerability for addiction and stress (Arnsten and Shansky, 2004; Crews et al., 2007). Developmental exposure to stressful events has been associated with the emergence of psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder (Alloy et al., 2006; Herbison et al., 2017; LeMoult et al., 2020; al\u2019Absi et al., 2021). The development of stress-induced maladaptive behaviors can also result in the emergence of alcohol and substance abuse, compulsive gambling, and generalized risk taking behavior (Sinha, 2008; Carroll et al., 2017; Teixeira et al., 2017; Duffy et al., 2018; Horak et al., 2021). These data suggest that uncontrolled exposure to stressors during this period of heightened neuronal plasticity may act as an important trigger for neuronal circuit remodeling that persists into adulthood.\nCircuit remodeling can occur through complex neuroimmune-endocrine multidirectional interactions that involve stress-induced upregulation of cortisol and the induction of cytokine release through neuroimmune activation (Haddad et al., 2002; Wiranowska and Plaas, 2008). Childhood maltreatment and stress resulting in the increased production of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory markers are known to drive neuronal remodeling that have been associated with numerous psychiatric disorders (Munjiza et al., 2018; Wohleb et al., 2018). Moreover, the stress-induced changes in cytokine regulation can persist into adulthood as demonstrated by Carpenter et al. (2010) in which they show that adults with a history of childhood maltreatment exhibit increased release of IL-6 during acute stress when performing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Cytokinerelated neuroinflammation has been demonstrated in animal models of chronic unpredictable stress (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2016) and social defeat paradigms (Esquivel-Rend\u00f3n et al., 2019), and have been directly linked to the emergence of stress-induced behavioral phenotypes, including depression (Fernandes and Gupta, 2019; Mograbi et al., 2020). Interestingly, rosiglitazone has been shown to have both anti-depressant and anxiolyticlike effects in rodent models (Eissa Ahmed et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2017), suggesting that rosiglitazone has the potential to be an effective therapeutic approach for the prevention of stressinduced behavioral maladaptation.\nInterestingly, the potent peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR\u03b3) agonist, rosiglitazone was originally used due to its efficacy in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Richter et al., 2007). This was primarily due to its ability to increase the insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue without directly stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic \u00df-cells, thus reducing plasma glucose levels (Wagstaff and Goa, 2002; Richter et al., 2007). It was also viewed as beneficial due to its efficacy in modulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation (Chinetti et al., 2000, 2003; Standiford et al., 2005). More recently, it has been shown that some of the PNS actions of rosiglitazone are mediated through the suppression of NF-\u03baB and through a macrophage shift from an inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Bouhlel et al., 2007), similar to the process that occurs in microglia within the central\nnervous system (CNS) (Subramaniam and Federoff, 2017; Ji et al., 2018). These data suggest that the effects of rosiglitazone are likely mediated through multiple complex mechanisms that involve peripheral and central immune cells, endothelial cells, neurons, and glia (Cullingford et al., 1998; Moreno et al., 2004; Bernardo and Minghetti, 2008). The role of neuroinflammation in animal models of chronic unpredictable stress and the direct link to the emergence of multiple stress-induced behavioral phenotypes suggests that rosiglitazone may be the ideal therapeutic intervention to attenuate stress (immune)-induced neuronal remodeling and the emergence of maladaptive, stressrelated, behavioral phenotypes that are associated with increased risk of developing alcohol and substance abuse disorder.\nIn the present study, we investigate the effectiveness of rosiglitazone in preventing the emergence of stress-induced behavioral changes following adolescent chronic unpredictable stress. We hypothesize that the administration of rosiglitazone will attenuate the emergence of stress-induced risk taking and novelty seeking behavior. By administering rosiglitazone during adolescent chronic unpredictable stress, we reveal task-specific attenuation of stress-induced behaviors following a battery of tests to assess anxiety, novelty seeking, depression, ethanol consumption, and risk taking behavior that may contribute to increased vulnerability to substance use disorder and the emergence of other maladaptive behaviors."

Overall, our findings indicate that animals that undergo stress exhibit confounding effects in two behavioral measures of anxiety and risk taking (as indicated by an increase in the time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus maze and an increase in thigmotaxis in the open field test). Stressed animals demonstrated an increase in novelty seeking in the social context (social interaction) and in the context of object novelty (novel object recognition) with no signs of a depressionlike behavioral phenotype (forced swim and sucrose preference). The administration of ROSI resulted in the attenuation of risk-taking behavior in the elevated plus maze and reversal of novelty seeking in the novel object recognition but no effect in the open field and social interaction task, demonstrating task-specific efficacy of this drug in preventing stress-induced behavioral changes.\nSocial behavior, risk taking, and novelty seeking are classic behavioral characteristics that emerge during adolescence (Spear, 2000). Due to ongoing brain development and maturation during this period of time it has been described as a critical period of vulnerability for addiction and stress (Wills et al., 1994; Arnsten and Shansky, 2004; Crews et al., 2007). The findings in the current study demonstrate that adolescent stress increases risk taking behavior in the EPM, consistent with a number of previous studies (McCormick et al., 2008; Peleg-Raibstein and Feldon, 2011; Toledo and Sandi, 2011; Chaby et al., 2013). Using an adolescent social stress paradigm, McCormick et al. (2008) demonstrated that female rats in estrous show reduced anxiety in the EPM. Additionally, Peleg-Raibstein and Feldon (2011) used a 5 day unpredictable stress paradigm in adolescent and adult male C57BL/6 mice and demonstrated reduced freezing behavior and increased open arm time in the EPM but only\nwhen stressed in adolescence. When stressed in adulthood, there was no effect on risk taking behavior (they did not assess females) (Peleg-Raibstein and Feldon, 2011). These data are consistent with previous findings from Toledo and Sandi (2011) in which they used an adolescent rat predator odor stress model (PND 28\u201342) and showed that adolescent stress increased risk taking behavior in the EPM in both male and female rats. Interestingly, these authors also found indications of mild anxiety in the open field as indicated by stressed animals taking significantly longer to enter the center zone of the apparatus. This is somewhat consistent with our current study in which we find stressed animals show increased risk taking in the EPM but spent more time in the thigmotaxis zone in the open field. It should be noted that if an animal displays risk taking behavior, it does not exclude the presence of anxiety; the presence of anxiety simply influences the risk/reward assessment that the animals perform that will be contingent on the current environmental conditions. These data are further complicated due to a lack of difference between Stress + VEH and Stress + ROSI groups in multiple behavioral measures. However, in the EPM, there is also no significant difference between No stress + VEH and Stress + ROSI. This is due to a partial reduction in open arm time in the Stress + ROSI group compared to Stress + VEH, however, this reduction is insufficient to reach No stress + VEH levels. The open arm time for the Stress + ROSI group resides between the two groups (Stress + VEH and No stress + VEH). These partial effects can also be observed in the open arm distance in the EPM and in the NOR task. Given the presence of this effect over multiple behavioral domains it is possible that this lack of significant effect may be due to the dose of ROSI selected (10 mg/kg, i.g.) since previous studies have used doses ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg i.g. (Pipatpiboon et al., 2012; Zong et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020).\nThe release of cortisol can occur during a bout of anxiety and can actually increase risk-taking behavior in men (Kluen et al., 2017). The cortisol measures from our current study were obtained immediately following the stress paradigm and show increased cortisol levels in response to adolescent chronic stress. However, administration of ROSI during stress attenuated this effect. ROSI administration also attenuated the stress-induced increased risk taking behavior in the EPM, suggesting that ROSI could be preventing stress-induced circuit remodeling that is occurring through complex neuroimmune-endocrine interactions. These interactions likely involve the upregulation of cortisol and the induction of cytokine release through neuroimmune activation (Haddad et al., 2002; Wiranowska and Plaas, 2008).\nThe relationship between ROSI and neuroendocrine suppression is not new. ROSI has been shown to downregulate HPA axis hyperactivity in diabetic rats via a mechanism dependent on PI3K activation in pituitary and adrenal glands (Torres et al., 2016). ROSI has also been used in diabetic rats to treat adrenal hypertrophy and hypercorticoidism (Ventura et al., 2020), while Goodson et al. (2017) used a chronic variable stress model to demonstrate that administration of ROSI blunted the stress-induced increase in circulating basal\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 830310\ncortisol. Here we suggest that blocking stress-induced HPA hyperactivity suppresses downstream neuroimmune modulation and the emergence of maladaptive behavior. The actions by which rosiglitazone mediates its anti-inflammatory effects are complicated because PPAR\u03b3 are expressed by glial cells and neurons, suggesting complex cell-cell neuroimmune interactions may be involved in rosiglitazone\u2019s mechanisms of action. Recent findings directly support a role for microglia in the actions of rosiglitazone. Carta et al. (2011) demonstrated that rosiglitazone was able to modulate PPAR\u03b3 receptor expression specifically in microglia without impacting neuronal receptor levels to attenuate neuroinflammation and degeneration in a model of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Further work suggests that the anti-inflammatory action may be through suppression of TNF\u03b1 (Carta et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016) or possibly due to rosiglitazone\u2019s ability to drive a microglial switch from a neuroinflammatory activation state to a neuroprotective activation state (Subramaniam and Federoff, 2017; Ji et al., 2018). It may be interesting in future studies to assess the relationship between cortisol response and immune-neuronal-remodeling in the context of risky decision making to elucidate whether blunted cortisol response during the stressful task contributes to the increase in risk taking behavior observed following adolescent stress and whether ROSI administration during or after stress induction can attenuate such an effect.\nWhile we consider the EPM to be a measure of risk taking, we must also consider the contributions of impulsivity and novelty in the context of exploration, either of which could contribute to changes in EPM and open field exploration. Although impulsivity was not assessed in this study, we did assess two different kinds of novelty seeking. We found that adolescent rats exposed to stress during adolescence demonstrate increased novelty seeking in both the social interaction task (social novelty) and the NOR task (object novelty). While the NOR task is typically used as a measure of working memory, it is also a good indicator of novelty preference. In the NOR task used for this study, the stress group spent significantly more time with the novel object than the familiar object compared to the no stress group that received ROSI. This is consistent with Toledo and Sandi (2011), who demonstrated similar increases in stress-dependent novelty seeking using a novel object test. However, novelty seeking was not limited to objects in the current study. When faced with the option to spend time with a familiar rat or a stranger rat in the social interaction task, the stress animals spent significantly more time with the stranger, demonstrating a preference for social novelty. These data become even more interesting when we consider the effect of ROSI administration on novelty seeking in both paradigms. While in the context of social novelty there was no effect of ROSI on preference for the stranger animal, in the NOR there was a significant reduction in discrimination index when ROSI was administered, as demonstrated by a decrease in time spent with the novel object. As previously discussed, disruption of mPFC function can not only decrease anxiety-like behavior but can also increase social interaction time (Gonzalez et al., 2000; Lacroix et al., 2000; Shah and Treit, 2003). This occurs through the modulation of cortisol, suggesting once again a role for HPA axis and cortisol dysregulation following adolescent\nstress that can be attenuated (in part) by administration of ROSI. These data suggest that the social reward/novelty pathway may be more resistant to adolescent stress-induced remodeling. Further work is required to understand the nuances of novelty seeking in the context of social reward versus object exploration and how ROSI may selectively attenuate one but not the other. However, recent work suggests that unique pathways inside and outside the classic mesolimbic pathway may drive social reward (Huang et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021) and likely involve mPFC modulation of dopamine regulation (Watson et al., 2012).\nDespite adolescent stress exacerbating risk taking and novelty seeking, this did not manifest in the context of increased EtOH consumption. However, ROSI alone (no stress animals) resulted in an increased in EtOH consumption across day 2 and 3 of self-administration which then normalized to the level of all other treatment and stress groups by day 4. Many times when animals self-administer more drug early in a paradigm it is associated with novelty seeking and/or impulsivity. This has typically been the case when comparing adolescent and adult rodents, with adolescent rodents typically demonstrating more consumption or nose poking (in reward tasks) than their older counterparts (Spear, 2000; Romer, 2010; Doremus-Fitzwater et al., 2012). However, ROSI animals do not demonstrate more novelty seeking or risk taking in the EPM and OF. Moreover, if this was simply a response to taste novelty we would expect to see similar differences on the single day sucrose exposure, which we do not, thus making it unlikely that ROSI is inducing increased novelty seeking or risk taking resulting in early increases in EtOH consumption. Regardless of the reasons for increased EtOH administration during day 2 and 3, it did not persist throughout the remaining sessions.\nThe lack of stress effect on alcohol consumption was surprising since risk taking and novelty seeking are strongly associated with alcohol and substance abuse use and escalation in both humans and animal models (Wingo et al., 2016). It is possible that, despite using a chronic stress paradigm, the mildness of the stressors in the current study produces less robust behavioral and neuroendocrine effects that would be sufficient to manifest as increased alcohol consumption. Regardless, we cannot rule out that animals undergoing this adolescent stress paradigm may have increased abuse liability toward other drugs of abuse or gambling tasks, but clearly there is no generalized reward sensitivity as indicated by no differences in sucrose or alcohol consumption following adolescent stress. However, previous studies have shown that chronic stress during adolescence enhances locomotor sensitization to amphetamine (Mathews et al., 2008) and cocaine (Lepsch et al., 2005) in both male and female rats.\nIn conclusion, these findings support the growing data demonstrating the vulnerability of the adolescent brain to stressful experiences. These data also show a potential role for the PPAR\u03b3 pathway in novelty seeking and risk taking behaviors that may be related to neuro-immune-endocrine processes. Further work will be necessary to delineate the role of these pathways and determine the specific downstream cellular and molecular changes that may be involved.\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 830310"
