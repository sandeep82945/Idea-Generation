We used quarterly Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data (SDUD) from 2018 to 2020 to construct 3 measures of buprenorphine provision. The primary measure\u2014units (defined as tablets or sublingual films) dispensed per 1000 beneficiaries (units)\u2014represents total buprenorphine supplied to Medicaid beneficiaries. Two other measures\u2014prescriptions per 1000 beneficiaries (prescriptions) and mean units dispensed per prescription (units per prescription)\u2014decompose total supply into component parts. For each measure, we used linear regression to compute deviation from prepandemic trends during the pandemic\u2014defined as the second through fourth quarters of 2020. For all Medicaid programs combined and for each state separately, we computed cumulative deviations for units and prescriptions, and mean deviations for units per prescription over the pandemic period (eAppendix in the Supplement).\nStatistical testing was 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata software version 16.1 (StataCorp) from November 2021 to February 2022."

After the start of the pandemic, the trend in units flattened, the trend in prescriptions flattened following an initial drop, and units per prescription increased and then remained elevated (Figure 1). Regression analysis indicated that cumulative units dispensed during the first 3 quarters of the pandemic was below the prepandemic trend by 92.75 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries (95% CI, \u2212174.82 to \u221210.68 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries). Cumulative prescriptions issued was also below the prepandemic trend by 11.56 per 1000 beneficiaries (95% CI, \u221215.42 to \u22127.71 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries), but mean units dispensed per prescription increased by 2.20 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries (95% CI, 1.34 to 3.06 per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries) relative to the prepandemic trend.\n+ Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.\nOpen Access.

            "text": "Cumulative units of buprenorphine dispensed per 1000 Medicaid beneficiaries was significantly below the prepandemic trend nationally and in 13 states in the first 3 quarters of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was despite increases in units per prescription, which partially offset below-trend prescribing in some states. Previous studies found no change in the number of unique Medicaid beneficiaries receiving buprenorphine prescriptions at the pandemic\u2019s onset,4 and noted increases in days\u2019 supply per prescription.5 The key finding of below-trend buprenorphine dispensing is particularly concerning given the increase in opioid overdose deaths over the same period.5,6\nThis study has some limitations. First, Medicaid programs submit aggregate rather than individual- or claim-level data. Therefore, we could neither distinguish between new prescriptions and refills nor determine if trend deviations varied across subpopulations. Second, we could not examine whether expanding units per prescription had adverse outcomes, such as more diversion. Third, this study describes associations and does not make any causal statements or attribute findings to specific policies or clinical adaptations. For example, we could not isolate state policy changes\u2014such as relaxation of prescription quantity limits1,2\u2014from other factors owing to limited information on the nature of these policies and their specific applicability to buprenorphine. Further research should evaluate whether state-level changes affected quantity per prescription, and whether that mitigated access barriers.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: February 07, 2022.\nPublished: March 24, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.4058\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Dowd WN et al.
