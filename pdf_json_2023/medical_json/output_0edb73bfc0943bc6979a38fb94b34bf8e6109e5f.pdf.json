    "abstractText": "In this study, the hysteretic behavior of a novel frictional energy dissipation steel truss (FED-ST) is examined. The proposed FED-ST incorporates a friction damper with brass as the friction material into the top chord of traditional truss to improve the seismic performance of the staggered truss framing systems. A FED-ST specimen with a scale of 1:2.5 was subjected to a hysteresis test. The hysteretic behavior, ductility, and energy dissipation capability were analyzed considering the test findings. It is demonstrated that the FED-ST specimen has favorable ductility and an energy dissipation capacity that is 7.3 times more than that of a conventional truss specimen. The test findings were then used to compare and validate a finite element (FE) model. The FE analysis results are in strong agreement with the test results, demonstrating the validity of the modeling approach. To further investigate the impact of the cover plate width on the behavior of the FED-ST, preliminary parametric research was also carried out.",

Structure diagram of the STFS.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6273. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16186273 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6273 2 of 18\nNumerous studies have been done on the static and dynamic performance and design solutions of STFS since the 1960s [2]. A 1:8 scaled STFS specimen\u2019s performance under low cyclic loading was studied by Zhou et al. [3], and some ideas for the design of the STFS were put forth according to the outcomes of tests and FEA. A 6-story STFS specimen built without a fire-proof coating and subjected to a pool fire was researched by Chen et al. [4] to determine its mechanical behavior and manner of failure. Kim et al. [5,6] evaluated the seismic performance of STFS, and developed a seismic design strategy for friction dampers within STFS. Zhou et al. [7] designed and fabricated two 1:2.5 scaled truss specimens and carried out tests under cycle load. The results of the test indicate that the ductility of truss specimens is worse than that of the ordinary momentframe system. A 14-story STFS model with a size of 1:8 was subjected to a number of pseudo-dynamic tests by Zhou et al. [8], and the seismic performance of the test model was examined considering the test findings. Zhou et al. [9] calculated the demand for hybrid STFS under earthquake through numerical simulation and revealed damagecontrol behavior. However, STFS is not listed as a fundamental seismic-force-resisting system in mainstream specifications [10], which suggests that more work should be done to improve the system\u2019s seismic performance. Because of their durability and affordability, frictional dampers have been frequently used in structural engineering in the past few decades. Boggian et al. [11] proposed a retrofitting solution for RC buildings based on the combined use of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels and asymmetric friction connections (AFCs). The research showed that the energy dissipation of the AFC increases the structural dissipation capacity and reduces the displacement demand. Qiu et al. [12] investigated the cyclic behavior of a steel selfcentering (SC) rocking column. The steel SC rocking column consists of an H-section steel column and a pair of shape memory alloy (SMA) slip-friction dampers (SMASFDs). It was found that up to a drift ratio of 7%, the rocking column maintained stable flagshaped hysteresis, which was characterized by excellent SC capability and satisfactory damping capacity. The experimental research by Zhang et al. [13] reveals that compared with steel-stainless steel friction pairs, the friction behavior of steel-brass pairs is more stable, repeatable, and predictable. Moreover, the material wear is also slighter, highlighting their advantages as friction pairs. According to research by Kim et al. [14] on a 3D-office building frame, a limited number of BRBs (Buckling-Restrained Braces) could enhance the seismic capacity of the structure by minimizing story drift. Using two numerical models, Bruschi et al. [15] tested a novel friction damper used in existing building retrofitting. According to the study\u2019s findings, the friction damper is advantageous for dispersing seismic energy, preventing the frame\u2019s lateral deformation, and simultaneously managing a rise in internal forces and structural acceleration. An inelastic moment frame was proposed to have its seismic vibration controlled using rotating friction dampers (RFDs) by Jarrahi et al. [16]. The frame outfitted with the optimal RFD was subsequently evaluated and put to the test against four historical earthquake records. The findings show that it performs better seismically than the uncontrolled structure. A new self-centering damper was developed by Veismoradi et al. [17] and a sample prototype was created for testing. The test findings demonstrate the damper\u2019s capacity for energy dissipation and reliable selfcentering function that does not require any post-event maintenance. A brand-new kind of shape memory alloy self-centering friction damper was created by Li et al. [18]. When used with earthquake-resistant structures, its self-centering capability and inexpensive maintenance costs after an earthquake provide it a significant benefit. The effectiveness of the suggested friction damper with double slip loads (DSL) under moderate and strong seismic excitations was examined by Ghorbani et al. [19]. In comparison to the more traditional dampers, the results show that the suggested DSL dampers are more successful at lowering the structural seismic response. To improve the seismic performance of STFS, the authors developed a new frictional energy dissipation steel truss (FED-ST). The difference between FED-ST and conventional trusses is that it integrates a friction damper in the top chord. In previous studies [20], the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6273 3 of 18\nauthors conducted mechanism analysis and experimental study on a FED-ST specimen with a sliding distance of \u00b118 mm. To further investigate the seismic behavior of FED-ST with a long sliding distance, a 1:2.5 scaled specimen with a sliding distance of \u00b140 mm was made for the cyclic load test in this paper. In addition, numerical simulations of FED-ST were conducted using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS 6.14 and compared with experimental results.\n2. Configuration of FED-ST\nThe configuration of FED-ST is seen in Figure 2, where the top chord consists of a T-shaped member with long slot holes, two angle members, and two brass friction plates. The T-shaped member, brass friction plates, and angle members are connected through a series of bolts, and the brass friction plates can make the friction between the angle members and the T-shaped member smoother. Energy is dissipated through the friction generated between brass plates and steel plate, and the effective energy dissipation has been verified by many studies [21,22]. Sliding and friction will occur between the angle members and the T-shaped member to dissipate energy when the truss structure undergoes rare earthquakes.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 19\nTo improve the seismic performance of STFS, the authors developed a new frictional energy dissipation steel truss (FED-ST).

Configuration of the FED-ST system.\nThe behavior of FED-ST under earthquakes is seen in Figure 3, which consists of three stages. FED-ST is in the elastic stage under frequent earthquakes, just like a traditional truss. At this time, the lateral load does not reach the activation force of the frictional chord damper (maximum static friction force generated by the bolts).\nWhen the lateral force exceeds the activation force of the frictional chord damper, sliding occurs between the T-shaped member and the angle members, which is the friction stage.

As the force continues, FED-ST is about to yield and enter the plastic stage.\nFigure 2.

HSS (hollow structural section members) were used to make webs, H-shaped members were used to make the bottom chord, and the top chord is a frictional chord. The friction plate between T-shaped member and angle members is made of brass with a thickness of 1 mm.

There are 22 highstrength bolts with a diameter of 12 mm arranged in the frictional chord in double rows; the pre-tightening force of each bolt is 20 kN.

Due to the failure of specimen FED-ST40 at a loading displacement of 60 mm, 60 mm is taken as the u\u0394 of FED-ST40, which is significantly higher than that of the conventional truss specimen (22.7 mm) [7] and which meets the requirements of mainstream specifications [28,29] for inter-story drift of steel structures (0.02 rad). The ductility coefficient of FED-ST40 is 20, which is much larger than that of a conventional truss specimen (2.91) [7], indicating that the FED-ST has good ductility.\n4.3. Energy Dissipation Capability The cumulative energy dissipation of FED-ST40 is shown in Figure 12. The specimen FED-ST40 was in the elastic stage when the displacement was 3 mm, with little energy dissipation. After the displacement reached 6 mm, FED-ST40 had mainly dissipated energy through friction, and the energy dissipation had significantly increased. When the displacement was 42 mm, the cumulative energy dissipation reached 287.6 kJ, the sliding displacement of the specimen got to the maximum value, then the chords were about to enter a plasticity state. When further loaded to 60 mm, the specimen failed. The total energy dissipation is 7.3 times that of the conventional truss specimen [7]. The above results indicate that the energy dissipation capability of FED-ST is good. The equivalent viscous damping coefficient eh can be used to measure the energy dissipation capacity of a structure, defined as ABC CDA OBE ODF( ) 2 )(eh S S S S\u03c0= + + , where ABCS , CDAS , OBES , and ODFS are shown in Figure 13. The variation of the eh of the specimen with lateral displacement is shown in Figure 14. After the frictional chord damper is activated (6 mm\u201360 mm), the eh of FED-ST40 remains high (0.25\u20130.35), showing the excellent capability of energy dissipation. According to the previous studies, the FED-ST has good energy dissipation capability which will greatly improve the seismic performance of the STFS.\n-60 -40 -20 20 40 600 -600 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100\n100 200 300 400 500 600\n0\nLo ad\n(k N\n)\nLateral displacement (mm)\nHysteresis curve Skeleton curve\n-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Inter-story drift ratio (%)\nFigure 11.

Due to the failure of specimen FED-ST40 at a loading displacement of 60 mm, 60 mm is taken as the \u2206u of FED-ST40, which is significantly higher than that of the conventional truss specimen (22.7 mm) [7] and which meets the requirements of mainstream specifications [28,29] for inter-story drift of steel structures (0.02 rad). The ductility coefficient of FED-ST40 is 20, which is much larger than that of a conventional truss specimen (2.91) [7], indicating that the FED-ST has good ductility.\n4.3. Energy Dissipation Capability\nThe cumulative energy dissipation of FED-ST40 is shown in Figure 12. The specimen FED-ST40 was in the elastic stage when the displacement was 3 mm, with little energy dissipation. After the displacement reached 6 mm, FED-ST40 had mainly dissipated energy through friction, and the energy dissipation had significantly increased. When the displacement was 42 mm, the cumulative energy dissipation reached 287.6 kJ, the sliding displacement of the specimen got to the maximum value, then the chords were about to enter a plasticity state. When further loaded to 60 mm, the specimen failed. The total energy dissipation is 7.3 times that of the conventional truss specimen [7]. The above results indicate that the energy dissipation capability of FED-ST is good. Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 19\nFigure 12.

The FEM\u2019s geometrical dimension and boundary condition were following that utilized in the experimental study for the specimen, as shown in Figure 15. All component connection settings are consistent with the experiment, such as using \u201ctie\u201d for chord-column connection, which can be considered as a rigid connection, and \u201ctie\u201d is also used for web-chord connection. To simulate the loading pattern of the experiment, a rigid body was set up at the height of the top and bottom floor slabs of the specimen. The rigid body at the bottom floor was constrained by displacement in three directions of XYZ to simulate the foundation, while the rigid body at the top floor was constrained by displacement in two directions of YZ, and the load was applied in the X direction. Considering the computing costs and the accuracy of results, the shell element S4R was used to simulate the web members, while the other components were simulated using the solid element C3D8R. The reinforcing bars and head studs are modeled using truss elements (T3D2), and assuming it is embedded in the concrete floor slabs. The meshes in the plastic area have been refined to a size of approximately 5 mm, while in the rest zones, 20 mm or smaller was the largest element size allowed. The \u201csurface-to-surface contact\u201d was created between the contact pieces. The tangential behavior of the contact property setting was set to \u201cpenalty\u201d and the frictional coefficient was entered. The normal behavior was set to \u201chard\u201d contact. The frictional coefficient was calibrated to 0.25 for the brass-steel contacting surfaces and was tuned to 0.5 for the concrete-steel contacting surfaces [30,31]. the expected slip force f can be calculated based on Coulomb friction theory:\nf = n\u00b5rN (3)\nwhere n is the number of high-strength bolts applying the pressure, which is 22 in this study; \u00b5 is the friction coefficient, calibrated as 0.25 at the steel\u2013brass interface; r is the number of friction surfaces, which is 2 in this study; N is the bolt pre-tightening force, which is 20 kN in this study.

The yield strength fy is 407 MPa based on the material properties tests.\nTo further validate the effectiveness of the proposed FEM, Figure 17 shows the comparison of experimental floor slab damage and numerical simulation results after loading is completed. The results indicate that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The damage model of concrete can effectively simulate the damage of floor slabs. Figure 18 compares the buckling of the T-shaped member at the end of the top chord between experimental and finite element analysis, while Figure 19 compares the deformation of the angles after the end of the experiment. The results show that the deformation of the specimen in the FE model can be matched well with the experimental results. Overall, the proposed FEM could predict the response of the frictional energy dissipation steel truss subjected to lateral load because it accurately captured the deformation behavior of FED-ST40 and the key points of the load-displacement curves, such as the initial lateral stiffness, the peak, and the ultimate load and displacement. In addition, different types of energy dissipation can be extracted from the FEM results; the comparison of frictional dissipated energy (FDE) and plastic dissipated energy (PDE) under different loading displacements is shown in Figure 20. In the friction stage, the proportion of FDE has always been greater than 92%, in the plastic stage (42 mm\u201360 mm), due to significant plastic deformation of the specimen, the proportion of plastic energy dissipation has increased. The final proportion of FDE is 83%, which is far greater than the plastic energy dissipation. This indicates that friction dampers can greatly improve the energy dissipation capacity of the structures.\nFigure 17.

The experiment verified that the FED-ST showed the expected failure\nmode and expected three-stage behavior under lateral forces. The ultimate lateral\ndisplacement of the FED-ST specimen is 2.6 times that of the traditional truss speci-\nmen, the ductility coefficient is 6.9 times that of the traditional truss specimen, and\nthe cumulative energy dissipation is 7.3 times that of the conventional truss speci-\nmen. The equivalent viscous damping coefficient of the FED-ST specimen remained\nat a high level during the test. FED-ST has better energy dissipation capacity and\nductility compared to conventional trusses, which will greatly improve the seismic\nbehavior of the STFS. The steel used in this experiment is Q355 steel, while the seismic\nperformance of trusses made of other types of steel needs further research.\n2. The proposed FE model was able to predict the response of the frictional energy dis-\nsipation steel truss subjected to lateral load based on the deformation behavior of the\nFED-ST and key characteristics of the load-displacement curves. Therefore, it is ad-\nvised that it be applied in actual practice for structural design and analysis.\n3. The parametrical numerical analyses reveal that the smaller the width of the cover\nplate connecting the web members and the angle members, the smaller the angles\u2019\ndeformations.

The experiment verified that the FED-ST showed the expected failure mode and expected three-stage behavior under lateral forces. The ultimate lateral displacement of the FED-ST specimen is 2.6 times that of the traditional truss specimen, the ductility coefficient is 6.9 times that of the traditional truss specimen, and the cumulative energy dissipation is 7.3 times that of the conventional truss specimen. The equivalent viscous damping coefficient of the FED-ST specimen remained at a high level during the test. FED-ST has better energy dissipation capacity and ductility compared to conventional trusses, which will greatly improve the seismic behavior of the STFS. The steel used in this experiment is Q355 steel, while the seismic performance of trusses made of other types of steel needs further research. 2. The proposed FE model was able to predict the response of the frictional energy dissipation steel truss subjected to lateral load based on the deformation behavior of\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6273 17 of 18\nthe FED-ST and key characteristics of the load-displacement curves. Therefore, it is advised that it be applied in actual practice for structural design and analysis.\n3. The parametrical numerical analyses reveal that the smaller the width of the cover plate connecting the web members and the angle members, the smaller the angles\u2019 deformations. The use of narrow cover plates can effectively control the torsional bulking of angles. Moreover, when the width of the cover plate is less than the distance of the centers of mass of the two angles, the deformation of the angles is significantly reduced. Therefore, it is recommended that the width of the cover plates be less than the distance of the centers of mass of the two angles during design.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.Z. and X.Z.; methodology, Z.Z. and Q.Z.; software, Z.Z., S.L. and H.F.; validation, S.L., H.F. and Z.Z.; formal analysis, Q.Z. and Z.Z.; investigation, Q.Z.; resources, Q.Z. and X.Z.; data curation, Q.Z. and Z.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Z.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, Z.Z. and Q.Z.; visualization, Z.Z. and H.F.; supervision, Q.Z.; project administration, Z.Z.; funding acquisition, Q.Z. and X.Z.
