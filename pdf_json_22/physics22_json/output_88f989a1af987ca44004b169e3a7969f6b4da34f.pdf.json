    "abstractText": "Image guidance using in-beam real-time magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is expected to improve the targeting accuracy of proton therapy for moving tumors, by reducing treatment margins, detecting interfractional and intrafractional anatomical changes and enabling beam gating. The aim of this study is to quantitatively characterize the static magnetic field and image quality of a 0.22T open MR scanner that has been integrated with a static proton research beamline. The magnetic field and image quality studies are performed using high-precision magnetometry and standardized diagnostic image quality assessment protocols, respectively. The magnetic field homogeneity was found to be typical of the scanner used (98 ppm). Operation of the beamline magnets changed the central resonance frequency and magnetic field homogeneity by a maximum of 16 Hz and 3 ppm, respectively. It was shown that the in-beam MR scanner features sufficient image quality and influences of simultaneous irradiation on the images are restricted to a small sequence-dependent image translation (0.1\u20130.7 mm) and a minor reduction in signalto-noise ratio (1.3%\u20135.6%). Nevertheless, specific measures have to be taken to minimize these effects in order to achieve accurate and reproducible imaging which is required for a future clinical application of MR integrated proton therapy.",

For the treatment of mobile soft-tissue tumors, high-contrast real-time imaging is required for online beam gating or tumor tracking. In photon therapy (XT), such real-time image guidance is realized by magnetic resonance (MR) guided linear accelerator systems (MRXT). Currently, two such commercially available systems have been introduced into the clinic [1], [2] and further groups are developing independent prototype systems [3], [4]. However, due to the much steeper dose gradient at the distal fall-off of the beam and increased sensitivity to anatomical variations and organ motion of PT, online image guidance in PT is expected to be even more important than for XT, especially regarding moving soft-tissue tumors [5]. Despite this strong motivation, the development of MR-integrated PT (MRiPT) is still in its infancy, due to a number of unresolved technological questions [6]. One of the key aspects highlighted by Hoffmann et al. [6] is the electromagnetic interference between the PT system and the MR imager. The MR image quality is expected to be influenced by the presence and operation of the PT system, mainly due to the magnetic fringe fields of the beamline magnets that are expected to overlap with the imaging magnetic field of the MR scanner and thus result in a degradation of image quality.\nIn 2018, we have shown for the first time that a 0.22T open MR scanner designed for musculoskeletal imaging (MrJ 2200, ASG Superconductors S.p.A., Genoa, Italy) can been integrated with a horizontal static research proton beamline [7]. The study by Schellhammer et al. [7] included the setup, beam alignment, beam quality, and first anatomical images with this in-beam MR research setup, thus proving the feasibility of simultaneous imaging during proton beam irradiation. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of image quality is missing in this work. Such an analysis is important since it allows to investigate in detail any beam related effects on the image quality of the scanner and it is the basis for the definition of a quality assurance (QA) protocol for future MRiPT systems to be used for patient treatment, to assure reproducible and accurate images. As shown in [8], for the first MRXT system, image QA regarding an in-beam MR system for radiation therapy requires additional parameters to be studied as compared to diagnostic MR systems, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and geometric fidelity. As the MRI system studied here utilizes a permanent magnet design which is known\n1\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\nto show a residual temperature induced frequency drift, absolute positioning of the image is a further crucial parameter, as MR images shall be used for patient positioning and treatment adaptation, thus absolute geometric accuracy is of paramount importance. Therefore, the aim of the current study is twofold. First, for the field strength and homogeneity of the main magnetic field of the MR scanner (B0), effects of temperature change and energizing the beamline magnets of the PT system are studied. Second, regarding the image quality of the scanner, we compare two scenarios, imaging with and without simultaneous proton beam irradiation by a quantitative assessment of: 1) the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom test; 2) the SNR test; and 3) the absolute positional accuracy test."

            "text": "The static magnetic field around the MR magnetic isocenter was mapped using a half-moon shaped magnetic field camera (MFC 3048, MetroLab, Geneva, Switzerland) containing 16 NMR probes evenly distributed along the arc of the half circle (Fig. 1). Each probe measured the resonance frequency at a specific location. The probe array was vertically mounted on a manually rotatable holder with its origin aligned with the magnetic isocenter of the MR scanner. The probe array was either\ndirected toward the beam exit window at a fixed azimuthal angle of \u03d5 = 180\u25e6 or manually rotated over 360\u25e6 along the B0 field axis at 12 equidistant azimuthal angles of 30\u25e6 each. In the former case, in total, 16 samples were acquired on the arc with a radius of 11 cm, whereas in the latter case, for a full rotation, in total 16 \u00d7 12 samples were acquired on the surface of a 22-cm diameter-spherical volume (DSV). From this data, both the central resonance frequency (fn), which was the average frequency over all n samples, and the peak-to-peak frequency variation relative to the central resonance frequency to indicate the magnetic field homogeneity (MFHn) were calculated.\n1) Magnetic Field Drift: Since the MR scanner is based on biplanar permanent magnets made of Nd2Fe14B material, it is known to be very sensitive to temperature fluctuations [9]. The temperature coefficient of the residual magnetic flux density of Nd2Fe14B is about \u22121100 ppm\u00b7K\u22121 [10]. To compensate for thermal drift effects of the B0 field the magnets and the steel flux return yoke are temperature controlled at 36.0 \u25e6C. The temperature stability, as measured by the internal temperature sensors of the MR scanner, is better than 0.3 mK. However, this measure provides no information on the temperature distribution over the whole volume of the magnet and given the very low thermal conductivity of the Nd2Fe14B of 7\u20138 W (m\u00b7K)\u22121 [10], the B0 field strength and homogeneity of the scanner are expected to exhibit a residual drift due to environmental temperature fluctuations [11]. To evaluate the magnitude and rate of this drift long-term measurements over 4 days (with a 2-hour break during the second day for reference rotation measurements, see below) were performed with the magnetic field camera positioned at a fixed azimuthal angle of \u03d5 = 180\u25e6 and a sampling rate of 0.1 Hz, yielding a time series of f16 and MFH16. To be able to correlate the frequency drift with the ambient temperature, Ta, the room temperature was logged with an SL52T (Signatrol, Tewkesbury, U.K.) miniature temperature data logger positioned at the outside wall of the Faraday cage at a sampling rate of 2 min. The correlation between f16, MFH16, and Ta was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient. During the 2-h break on day 2, three\n2\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\nfull rotations of the magnetic field camera were performed to measure the MFH192 and f192. For these rotation measurements, it was assured that all beamline magnets were switched off.\n2) Effect of Beamline Magnets: In the previous study [7], the fringe field produced by the beamline magnets at a position close to the isocenter of the MR imager in the absence of its B0 field was found to increase the environmental magnetic field by 1\u20133 \u03bcT for 70\u2013220 MeV beams. Therefore, these magnetic fringe fields are expected to overlap with the magnetic field deployed for imaging by the in-beam MR scanner and hence distort the B0 field, which will potentially compromise the MR image quality. To study this effect, the B0 field was mapped with the beamline magnets being energized for nominal proton energies in the clinical range of 75\u2013225 MeV at equidistant energy steps of 25 MeV. For each beam energy, one full rotational measurement by the MFC was acquired with baseline measurements using nonenergized beamline magnets in between, to compensate for the magnetic field drift that may occur due to environmental temperature changes, through a linear relationship. For the beamline settings at 125 MeV, two additional full rotations were performed to measure the reproducibility and the robustness of the drift rate correction."

            "text": "1) Imaging Protocol: For the MR imaging experiments, the ACR Small Phantom (inside length and inside diameter are both 100 mm) was placed centrally inside a dedicated knee coil, which were both positioned reproducibly in the magnetic isocenter using an in-house built phantom holder (Fig. 2). As shown with EBT3 film by [7], a 2-cm lateral displacement of the MR scanner relative to the beam central axis assured that a 125-MeV proton beam centrally impinged on the phantom\u2019s front face. Following the ACR Small Phantom protocol [12], a sagittal (vertical plane parallel to the B0 field and the central beam axis) locator scan and a set of seven axial (vertical plane perpendicular to the central beam axis) T1- and T2-weighted spin echo (SE) images were acquired for each measurement (see Table I). According to [12], the T2-weighted SE sequence is a double echo sequence, with\nonly the second echo being used for image analysis. Since gradient echo (GE) sequences are commonly used for real-time imaging and are more sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity [13] than SE sequences, two GE scans were added to the protocol, with seven axial slices each: first, a fast T1-weighted GE sequence using the shortest achievable repetition time of the MR scanner, and second, a magnetic field-sensitive T\u22172 - weighted GE sequence using the highest achievable echo time. A subsequent acquisition of the locator and the four SE and GE sequences is called \u201cimaging set\u201d in the following. To separate statistical fluctuations from systematic differences in the image quality, 24 imaging sets were acquired each with: 1) all beamline magnets switched off and 2) during simultaneous proton beam irradiation. Image sets with and without irradiation were acquired alternately to minimize the influence of possible temporal dependencies such as the temperature induced B0 drift (Section III-A1). The beam energy (125 MeV) was chosen such that the beam traversed all axial imaging planes and stopped at the distal region of the phantom behind the last imaging plane. This energy was calculated by a simple Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of monoenergetic, parallel proton pencil beams of different energies through a simplified water phantom without inner structures. The beam current was set to the maximum (5.4 nA at beam exit window) to gain a worstcase estimate of any beam-related effects. Before each imaging set, a calibration of the transmission frequency was performed and a Scout scan, i.e., a set of three orthogonal SE localizer images, was acquired with the beamline magnets switched off. On the Scout scan, the position of the imaging slices in the phantom was visually verified according to the ACR phantom test protocol.\n2) Image Quality Parameters: For diagnostic MR system QA, a periodic control of the geometric accuracy, sliceposition and slice-thickness accuracy, high-contrast spatial resolution, low contrast detectability, image intensity uniformity, and percentage signal ghosting parameters as defined by the ACR [12] is the gold standard. As described by [8], MR QA for radiotherapy purposes requires the evaluation of additional parameters. Thus, the image SNR was deduced in accordance with the NEMA standard MS-1 from the mean phantom fluid signal and the standard deviation of the signal in a region outside of the phantom [14], [15]. Regions of interest (ROIs) for both signal and noise are indicated in red and yellow in Fig. 3, respectively. Additionally, since a uniform phantom shift along frequency encoding direction (FE) was expected [7] as a result of changes in B0 due to the overlapping fringe fields of the beamline magnets, the absolute position of the phantom center in both frequency and phase encoding (PE) direction was analyzed. The phantom center was determined using a Hough transform [16] (green circle in Fig. 3), yielding the center coordinates of the fitted circle (green cross in Fig. 3) relative to the center of the image with the coordinate axis pointing down and right. This analysis additionally allowed to study the system robustness against mean frequency drift and thus the stability of the transmission frequency calibration.\n3) Parameter Analysis and Statistical Testing: Image parameters were semi-automatically evaluated on the\n3\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\nTABLE I MR SEQUENCE PARAMETERS FOR THE IMAGE QUALITY TESTS.

Image analysis on slice 4 of the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence, showing regions of interest used for the SNR test (red circle and yellow rectangles), the ghosting test (green rectangles), and the phantom center determination (green circle and cross).\n256 \u00d7 256 DICOM images reconstructed by the manufacturer provided MR software, using the in-house developed and internally validated AMRIQA software tool [15]. A detailed description of the image parameter acquisition from the image slices 1\u20137 can be found in [14] and [17] and in the ACR Small Phantom protocol [12]. For the evaluation of the SNR and absolute phantom position, the software was extended for this study by implementing a circular Hough transform [16] in slice 4. The automated analysis was supervised visually to detect any implausible results. Two parameters, the slice thickness and the low-contrast detectability, were found to be not reliably quantified by the software due to the low SNR of the MR images. These were therefore evaluated manually according to the ACR Small Phantom protocol [12]. The median and interquartile range of all 13 image quality parameters and 5 sequences were calculated for the images acquired with and without simultaneous irradiation. As a first external reference, these results were compared to the minimum performance thresholds as defined by the \u201cRecommended Action Criteria\u201d of the ACR [12]. It should be noted, however, that these criteria are commonly used for the diagnostic application of high-field 1.5 T scanners, which are known to have a higher SNR in comparison to a\n0.22 T scanner. As far as we know, no established criteria exist for low-field MR scanners and their application in radiotherapy. To test the hypothesis that the image quality with and without simultaneous irradiation was equivalent, a two one-sided test (TOST) equivalence test [18], [19] was applied for all image quality parameters and sequences. Since no minimum performance thresholds had been established so far, the equivalence margins were based on the phantom and image-specific discretization: one pixel width for the geometrical parameters (i.e., 0.47 mm along PE and FE direction and 5 mm along slice encoding direction), two spokes for the low-contrast object detectability, 0.1 mm for the resolution, and 10% of the median for the SNR, image uniformity, and ghosting ratio. As the statistical analysis of this amount of parameters (12 \u00d7 4 + 1 = 49) would yield an unacceptable amount of random false-positives, a Bonferroni\u2013 Holm correction [20] was applied to achieve a familywise false positive error rate of \u03b1 = 5%. An image quality parameter was considered equivalent if the corresponding equivalence test was significant. Otherwise, if no statistical equivalence was found for at least one of the MR sequences, the statistical difference in the parameter was tested for all sequences by an inferiority t-test with a significance level of \u03b1 = 5%. Since the parameter distributions were monomodal and fairly symmetric, a normal distribution was assumed for the statistical tests."

Given the temperature coefficient of the residual magnetic flux density of the magnets material \u22120.1% / K [10], this translates to a temperature change on the order of 10 mK inside the permanent magnet material. Ambient temperature Ta measurements showed changes in the range of 23.7\u25e6C\u201324.2\u25e6C over the course of the experiment. The temperature Ta and frequency f16 were negatively correlated with p = \u22120.62.

For the three rotations under reference conditions, with the beamline magnets switched off, the MFH192 was 98.1, 97.9, and 98.2 ppm (Fig. 4). Pointwise absolute differences of all 192 probes for the three measurements were within 2.1 ppm. The mean and standard deviation of f192 for the three measurements was 9495219.0 \u00b1 1.7 Hz.\n2) Effect of the Proton Beamline: The change in mean resonance frequency, f192, as a function of proton beam energy is shown in Table II. A marked beam energy dependent change in f192 is observed, with the mean frequency decreasing for all energies between 75 MeV and 200 MeV and increasing for 225 MeV. For all measurements, no relevant changes in MFH192 were seen, with maximum pointwise differences below 2.5 ppm as compared to reference.\nB. Image Quality With the Beamline Switched Off\nFor all studied sequences, MR images were successfully acquired and reconstructed without distortion correction or uniformity enhancement. Fig. 5 presents the sagittal localizer and slices 1, 3, 4, and 7 of the T1-weighted SE images, which are the four slices used for image analysis. Apart from the T1-weighted GE sequence images, which exhibited radiofrequency spikes and a low signal intensity, all images were artifact free and present a typical image quality for the 0.22 T scanner. The image quality parameters measured with and without simultaneous irradiation for the T1- and T2weighted SE sequence, the T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence\nand the locator sequence, are given in Tables III\u2013VII of the Appendix B, respectively.\n1) ACR Image Quality and SNR: The geometrical image quality parameters showed very good agreement with the ACR Recommended Action Criteria. The axial geometric accuracy, slice position accuracy, and high-contrast spatial resolution tests were passed by all four axial sequences, and the sagittal geometric accuracy test was passed by the sagittal locator sequence. As common for low-field MR scanners, the median SNR of the images was low, especially for the T1-weighted GE sequence (45, 47, 14, and 53 for the T1- and T2-weighted SE and the T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences, respectively). This resulted in a relatively low image intensity uniformity, a high percentage signal ghosting, and a small low-contrast object detectability in comparison to the ACR Recommended Action Criteria. Consequently, the image intensity uniformity test failed for all sequences. The percentage signal ghosting test failed for all sequences except for the T1-weighted GE sequence. The low-contrast detectability test failed for the GE sequences and only partly passed for the SE sequences. As signal noise obscured the slice thickness test bars, the slice thickness accuracy test failed for the T1-weighted SE and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences and was not feasible for the T1weighted GE sequence. It was only passed by the T2-weighted SE sequence.\n2) Absolute Phantom Position Accuracy: The median absolute position of the phantom center, in both horizontal (i.e., PE) and vertical (i.e., FE) direction, agreed between the four sequences within 0.4 mm. For the horizontal direction, a systematic median offset of 1.6 mm from the center of the image was observed for all sequences (Fig. 6). The variability of the phantom center in vertical direction was found to be sequence dependent, with an interquartile range from 0.3 to 1.5 mm, and a maximum deviation from 1.3 to 3.6 mm (Fig. 6). Both the interquartile range and maximum deviation increased with decreasing gradient amplitude of the sequences, which was 2.6 mT/m, 1.5 mT/m, 5.7 mT/m, and 0.7 mT/m for the T1- and T2-weighted SE and the T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences, respectively. Fig. 7 shows an example of this vertical shift between two T\u22172 -weighted GE images. For the horizontal direction, however, the variability was smaller and no sequence dependence was observed (see Fig. 6). The interquartile range was between 0.4 and 0.5 mm (i.e., one pixel) for all sequences.\nC. Image Quality During Irradiation\nFor most image quality parameters, the results with and without simultaneous irradiation were statistically equivalent (see Tables III\u2013VII). However, four parameters were not statistically equivalent for at least one of the four sequences. First, the absolute vertical position of the phantom center showed a sequence dependent median shift in the opposite\n5\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\ndirection of FE of 0.3 mm, < 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, and 0.7 mm for T1- and T2-weighted SE and T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences, respectively (Fig. 8). The inferiority test showed that the decrease in the vertical phantom position with and without simultaneous irradiation was significant for the T1weighted SE and the T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences (with p = 0.04, p = 0.01, and p = 0.04, respectively). Second, the SNR was not statistically equivalent for the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence. In fact, a decrease in SNR was observed for all sequences during proton irradiation with a difference of medians of 0.6, 0.9, 0.8, and 1.5 for the T1- and T2-weighted SE and the T1- and T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences, respectively (see Tables III\u2013VI). This decrease was statistically significant for the T1- and T2-weighted SE and the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequences (with p = 0.01, p = 0.01, and p = 0.02, respectively). Third, the phantom diameter in slice 3 of the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence showed no statistical equivalence.\nHere, no consistent trend was observed amongst the sequences. A high fluctuation was observed as compared to the other sequences and, consequently, the inferiority test was not significant. Fourth, the percentage signal ghosting ratio showed no statistical equivalence for two out of the four sequences. For all sequences, the median differences were below 0.6%. Both SE sequences showed an increase in ghosting whereas for the GE sequences the ghosting ratio showed a minor decrease. The inferiority test was not significant."

            "text": "For hybrid MR-image guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) systems the characterization of the imaging performance is an essential part of a QA program to characterize, accept, and commission the integrated MRI unit. MR imaging performance characterization studies have been conducted for clinical MR-IGRT systems based on ACR, NEMA, and vendor specifications to establish procedures and baseline values for future routine QA [8], [21], [22]. A recent development is the initiation of studies on the technical feasibility to integrate real-time MR imaging and PT [5], [6]. Although the integration of on-board MR imaging and PT is still in its infancy, a first research prototype system developed by our group made it possible to conduct an initial image performance characterization study. In this work, we quantitatively characterized the image quality of an in-beam MR scanner during operation of a static proton research beamline and investigated the influence of the magnetic fringe fields produced by the beamline onto the B0 field of the MR scanner. Our B0 field measurements over a 22-cm DSV have shown that the peak-to-peak homogeneity of 98 ppm is within the operating specifications of the lowfield open MR scanner used in this study. Although this value\n6\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\nis higher than the typical specification of \u223c2 ppm for superconducting closed-bore high-field diagnostic MRI systems, it is sufficient for the purpose of prototyping an MRiPT system. High B0 field homogeneity is required for fat suppression, phase-based imaging, spectroscopy, and echo-planar imaging type of pulse sequences. As SE-based sequences show a relatively small sensitivity to B0 field perturbations, an acceptable image quality can still be achieved with inhomogeneities of several tens of ppm [23], [24]. In addition, the B0 field measurements showed two external sources perturbating the MR imager\u2019s central resonance frequency (f0). First, a residual daily magnetic field oscillation on the order of \u00b11.4 \u03bcT (\u00b160 Hz), which was shown to correlate with ambient temperature, thus indicating imperfections in the thermic insulation of the temperature-sensitive permanent magnet material. Second, the operation of the proton beamline system resulted in a change in B0 field strength on the order of 0.35 \u03bcT (15 Hz) induced by the fringe fields of the beamline magnets. Both of these effects may be compensated by the implementation of a more accurate f0 calibration method directly before acquisition of each MR image [25]. Alternative measures to reduce these effects are an improvement in thermic insulation and magnetic shielding of the MR system against external fields, respectively. The image quality of our in-beam MR scanner was shown to be acceptable both with and without simultaneous proton beam irradiation. All geometrical parameters agreed with the physical dimensions of the ACR phantom within one pixel width, and most ACR image quality parameters were shown to be equivalent with and without simultaneous irradiation. However, as is common for low-field MR scanners when there is no averaging over multiple excitations, as is the case with the ACR protocol, the SNR was low. This resulted in a low image intensity uniformity and a high percentage signal ghosting ratio in comparison to the ACR Recommended Action Criteria. Furthermore, a fluctuation in the absolute phantom position accuracy in FE (vertical) direction was observed, with an interquartile range of up to 1.5 mm. This effect can be understood by the accuracy of the prescan f0 calibration method currently used by the MR imager, which is on the order of 50 Hz [26]. Hence, an error in the resonance frequency, f0, results in a spatial off-resonance misencoding x = f0/\u03b3 Gx in the FE direction, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen nuclei (42.6 MHz/T) and Gx is the frequency encode gradient amplitude. For f0 = 50 Hz and Gx = 0.7 mT/m for the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence, this results in a calculated image shift of 1.7 mm, which corresponds with the observed interquartile range of 1.5 mm. As discussed above, this effect should ideally be corrected by the implementation of a more accurate f0 calibration performed before each image acquisition. Alternatively, an absolute positioning technique in which the imaging object relative to a fixed reference frame or fiducial markers is visualized could be used to detect the apparent displacement of the magnetic isocenter relative to the proton beam. The phantom\u2019s median horizontal position showed a constant deviation of 1.6 mm from the center of the FOV for all acquisitions and all sequences (Fig. 6). This offset is systematic and showed a small interquartile range of \u2264 0.5 mm and thus can be attributed to manufacturing tolerances in the phantom holder design. A statistically significant influence of simultaneous irradiation during image acquisition was observed as a decrease in the SNR and an apparent shift in the vertical position of the phantom. While the median decrease of 1.5 in SNR is not considered relevant, this effect can be tracked back to induced currents in the MR receiver coil due to irradiation [27], [28]. In contrast to the minor reduction in SNR, the sequence-dependent vertical shift of the phantom position showing median differences of up to 0.7 mm, which are due to changes in f0 resulting from the beamline magnets\u2019 fringe fields, has to be addressed in future studies, as discussed above. While changes in f0 generally affect the slice encoding direction in the same manner as the FE direction, the slice encoding gradient amplitude was larger than the FE gradient amplitude for all sequences. Hence, the slice position was less sensitive to B0 field perturbations and showed median differences < 0.2 mm in images acquired with and without simultaneous irradiation, which are considered to be within tolerance. The PE direction is generally not affected by uniform B0 field changes and therefore showed no relevant changes (\u2264 0.2 mm). As the magnitude of the FE gradient is the smallest for the T\u22172 -weighted GE sequence out of the four sequences studied, the effect of B0 inhomogeneities was expected to be most prominent for this sequences. This was confirmed by the nonuniform distortions of the phantom from its circular shape that induced uncertainties to the Hough transform (Fig. 3). This study is subject to a number of limitations that arise from the particular setup. First, the magnetic field gradient magnitudes of the MR pulse sequences used in this study were relatively small compared to those available on modern lowfield-strength MRI systems equipped with high-performance gradient subsystems and advanced imaging methods [29], [30].\n7\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden\nTherefore, it is expected that sequences with greater gradient amplitudes, and hence higher receiver bandwidths, will be more robust against geometric deformations, as voxel displacement is inversely proportional to gradient amplitude. Second, the MR imager features a relatively high magnetic field inhomogeneity, which limited the range of applicable sequences to standard SE and GE imaging. Commonly used alternatives for low-field-strength scanners featuring a much better field homogeneity, especially in the context of cine imaging for MR-guided radiation therapy and cardiac studies are balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequences, which have an intrinsically high SNR [31], [32]. However, bSSFP type sequences were not available on the MR system used in the current study. Third, this study does not include a 3-D geometric distortion analysis, as was suggested by [8]. The reasons are twofold: 1) the MRI system used is considered a research prototype and the high magnetic field inhomogeneity would deem such an analysis to be challenging and 2) to our knowledge, no validated 3-D distortion phantom exists that would fit into the knee coil used in this study. However, for a next generation clinical MRiPT prototype system, featuring a larger field-of-view and better magnetic field homogeneity, such an analysis should be included in the QA protocol. A fourth limitation of this study is that no dynamic effects of external magnetic field perturbations were investigated, such as a change in the magnetic fringe fields caused by switching ON/OFF the nearby cyclotron or those of the proton beamline magnets during MR image acquisition. These effects are known to potentially lead to severe image blurring [33]. Additionally, in the case of operating the scanning magnets for proton pencil beam scanning dose delivery in the absence of magnetic decoupling between the proton beam delivery system and the MRI system, simultaneous imaging and irradiation was recently shown to result in a severe loss of image quality due to the occurrence of ghosting artifacts along the PE direction [34]. Furthermore, MR imaging performance characterization studies for MR-IGRT systems have been largely based on diagnostic guidelines from ACR and NEMA. However, standardized acceptance and QA criteria for MR-IGRT systems are still lacking in the literature. Such criteria need to incorporate the specific image quality requirements that result from therapeutic applications, such as target localization, tissue segmentation, beam gating, or target volume tracking. The AAPM Task Group 284 is currently working on recommendations for MR simulation in radiotherapy and the optimization of radiation therapy-specific MR workflows. However, for MRiPT, we assume that additional recommendations will be required to account for the increased geometrical sensitivity that is inherent to PT."

The MR images showed acceptable geometric quality with limitations typical for the particular low-field MRI system.

            "text": "Fig. 9 shows the results of the drift measurement of the mean resonance frequency f16, the MFH16, and the ambient temperature Ta over four days. The mean frequency (upper plot, solid blue line) follows an oscillating daily seasonality being negatively correlated (p = \u22120.62) to the room temperature change (upper plot, overlaid dashed black line). Sharp drops in the frequency indicate activities in the nearby treatment room (influences of the treatment room on the B0 field of the MR scanner were studied in detail but are beyond the scope of this work). Energized beamline magnets to the treatment room lead to a decreased frequency on the order of 20\u201330 Hz (results not shown in this study). The 2-h data-void on the second day corresponds to the time point of reference rotation measurements. The same trend is visible for MFH16 (lower plot), however, the amplitude of the oscillation measures 1.5 ppm only.\n9\nProvided by S\u00e4chsische Landesb bliothek, Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Dresden"
