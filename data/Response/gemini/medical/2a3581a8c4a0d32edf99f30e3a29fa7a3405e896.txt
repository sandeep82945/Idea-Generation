1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential reactivity patterns of RDTs in relation to parasitaemia.** This could involve studying the expression levels of HRP-2, pLDH, and aldolase in P. falciparum parasites with different levels of parasitaemia, as well as the binding affinities of the antibodies used in the RDTs to these antigens.


2. **Evaluate the performance of RDTs in detecting P. falciparum parasitaemia in different populations and settings.** This could include studies in endemic areas, where malaria transmission is high and parasite densities can be very low, as well as in non-endemic areas, where malaria is imported and parasite densities are typically lower.


3. **Develop new RDTs that are more sensitive and specific for detecting P. falciparum parasitaemia, particularly at low levels.** This could involve using new antigens or combinations of antigens, as well as developing new technologies for detecting these antigens.


4. **Investigate the relationship between haematological parameters and parasitaemia in different clinical settings.** This could include studies in patients with severe malaria, uncomplicated malaria, and asymptomatic malaria, as well as in patients with different underlying medical conditions.


5. **Develop new clinical decision-making tools that incorporate RDT results and haematological parameters to improve the diagnosis and management of malaria.** This could involve developing algorithms or nomograms that can be used by clinicians to estimate parasitaemia and guide treatment decisions.
