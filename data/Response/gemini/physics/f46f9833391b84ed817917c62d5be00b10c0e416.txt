1. **Investigate the use of alternative protecting groups for the nucleobase and backbone amino groups.** This could include exploring protecting groups that are more compatible with each other, or that are more easily removed under mild conditions. This would allow for the synthesis of PNA monomers and oligomers with improved efficiency and purity.


2. **Develop new strategies for the synthesis of PNA monomers and oligomers in solution.** Solution-phase synthesis offers several advantages over solid-phase synthesis, such as the ability to use a wider range of solvents and reagents, and the ability to more easily monitor the reaction progress. However, solution-phase synthesis of PNAs is currently less efficient than solid-phase synthesis. Developing new solution-phase strategies could help to overcome this limitation.


3. **Explore the use of PNA monomers and oligomers in the synthesis of PNA-peptide conjugates and PNA-DNA chimeras.** PNA-peptide conjugates and PNA-DNA chimeras are promising new classes of biomolecules with a wide range of potential applications. However, the synthesis of these molecules is challenging, due to the different chemical properties of PNAs, peptides, and DNA. Developing new strategies for the synthesis of PNA-peptide conjugates and PNA-DNA chimeras would be a significant advance.


4. **Investigate the use of PNA monomers and oligomers in the development of new therapeutic agents.** PNAs have a number of properties that make them attractive candidates for use in the development of new therapeutic agents, such as their high affinity for DNA and RNA, their ability to inhibit gene expression, and their low toxicity. However, more research is needed to explore the potential of PNAs as therapeutic agents.


5. **Develop new applications for PNA monomers and oligomers in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology.** PNAs have a number of unique properties that could be exploited for a variety of applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology. For example, PNAs could be used to develop new biosensors, drug delivery systems, and nanomaterials. More research is needed to explore these potential applications.
