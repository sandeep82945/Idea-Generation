ABSTRACT Introduction Wilson\u2019s disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder characterised by a progressive accumulation of this metal mainly in the liver and the brain. Treatment is based on the removal of copper operated by the chelators, among which, Dpenicillamine (DP) is prescribed as a firstline treatment in most situations. There is some evidence in linking the use of DP with a risk of vitamin B 6; therefore, vitamin supplementation is sometimes recommended, although nonconsensually. The objective of our study was to evaluate the level of vitamin B 6 in WD patients treated with DP with and without associated supplementation. Methodology All WD patients followed at the National Reference Centre for WD in Lyon between January 2019 and December 2020 treated with DP for more than 1 year were included and separated in two groups according to vitamin B 6 supplementation. The level of vitamin B6 was measured by the determination of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Results A total of 37 patients were included. Average age of 23.3\u00b114.8 years, 15 patients with <18 years. Median duration of treatment was 51 (55.8) months. 15 patients were under vitamin B 6 supplementation and 22 had interrupted it for more than 1 year. The median PLP level was significantly higher in the group with supplementation, 137.2 (86.7) nmol/L vs 64.9 (30.8) nmol/ (p<0.01). No patient had a PLP level<35 nmol/L. Conclusion Longterm stable WD patients under DP treatment probably do not need vitamin B 6 supplementation.",

            "text": "Wilson\u2019s disease (WD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a progressive toxic accumulation of copper, mainly in the liver and central nervous system.1\u20133 This accumulation is responsible for liver damage and secondarily for neurological and psychiatric symptoms due to copper mobilisation. The disease is exceptionally symptomatic before 3 years and after 50 years.1 4 WD progresses to cirrhosis and irreversible central nervous system damage without early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.1\u20134 Treatment of WD is based on lifetime\nadministration of either copper chelators or copper absorption inhibitors associated with a low copper diet.1 2 5 6 D- penicillamine (DP), a copper chelator and inducer of endogeneous metallothioneins, is the firstline chelator for symptomatic WD. This drug is frequently responsible for adverse effects that require its discontinuation in up to 30% of cases.5\u20137 These effects are multiple and comprise notably cutaneous (rashes), haematological (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphadenopathy), renal (proteinuria) and immunological effects.8 9\nVitamin B6, or pyridoxine, is a generic term that includes a group of six chemically related compounds with a common pyridine ring. The phosphorylated derivate, known as pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), is the biologically active form of vitamin B6 that serves as a cofactor in more than 160 different catalytic reactions, particularly in the synthesis of haem, nucleic acids, as well as lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid metabolism.10 11\nStudies carried out more than 40 years ago demonstrated an antipyridoxine effect of DP manifested by an increase in the urinary\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 The antipyridoxine effect of D- penicillamine (DP) has been demonstrated, but there is no consensus regarding systematic vitamin B6 supplementation.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \u21d2 This is the first study addressing this subject after nearly four decades.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, including DP dose, vitamin B6 supplementation and blood pyridoxine level.\nVitamin B6 supplementation is routinely prescribed in our centre for patients at the start of DP treatment, 125 mg for children and 250 mg/week for adults. This supplementation is often later discontinued at the request of the patient or by the prescribing physician to improve adherence to the chelator treatment. Patients who discontinued vitamin supplementation for >12 months were compared with those who continued vitamin B6 supplementation.\nVitamin B6 level was determined by the quantification in whole blood of PLP, its biologically active form. This assay was carried out using high- performance liquid chromatography. Normal values ranged from 35.0 to 110.0 nmol/L. The quantification of PLP has been added to the routine follow- up of WD patients treated with DP since 2019.\nQualitative variables are presented as relative frequency (percentage), and as mean and SD for normally distributed quantitative variables and median (IQR) for nonnormally distributed variables. Comparisons were made using the Mann- Whitney non- parametric test using SPSS software V.23.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). P<0.05 was considered significant.\nThis analysis was listed as a clinical practice audit, under the control of the research committee of our structure, and therefore did not require ethics approval.

Only one case showed elevated urinary tryptophan metabolites indicating an antipiridoxin effect.

Attributing these complications to the antipyridoxine effect of DP remains challenging to prove, considering that in one case, optic neuropathy appeared in the first weeks of treatment using DP in low doses; in another case, a vitamin B6 supplementation was prescribed concomitantly.\nIn the supplemented group, more than three- quarters of patients had above- normal PLP levels, but we did not find any neurological manifestation that could be attributed to vitamin B6 overdose; however, patients were assessed only by clinical neurological examination without a dedicated electrophysiology study. Multiple publications have described a link between the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy and vitamin B6 overdose.20 In most published cases, this complication appears with large doses of vitamin B6 (2\u20136 g/d)\n21; but also with 50\u2013600 mg/day dosages over several months to several years.20\nAll the patients included in this study received DP for a relatively long time, about 4 years on average, so these\nresults should not be extrapolated to patients in the initial phases of treatment.\nWithout an established toxicity threshold, it is recommended not to exceed 25\u201350 mg/day of vitamin B6.\n22 23 Due to the ubiquity of vitamin B6 in common animal and plant foods, the need for vitamin B6 is generally satisfied. Supplementation may be necessary in exceptional cases (malnutrition and pregnancy). Our cohort only had two cases of moderate undernutrition and no pregnancy.\nThis study has many limitations: the retrospective and descriptive design, the small number of patients, the absence of a dietary evaluation and the predominance of chronic patients with long- term DP treatment.\nVitamin B6 level assessment or monitoring of clinical symptoms of vitamin toxicity are not routinely recommended during WD follow- up. However, we recommend thoroughly assessing both until more firm evidence is available.\nT echnology P atna (IIT P atna).
