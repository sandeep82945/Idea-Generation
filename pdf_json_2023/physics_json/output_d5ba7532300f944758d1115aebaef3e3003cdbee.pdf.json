    "abstractText": "In this study, Cu-doped ZnO was prepared via the facile one-pot solvothermal approach. The structure and composition of the synthesized samples were characterized by XRD (X-ray diffraction), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analyses, revealing that the synthesized samples consisted of Cu-doped ZnO nanoparticles. Ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy analysis showed that Cu-doping significantly improves the visible light absorption properties of ZnO. The photocatalytic capacity of the synthesized samples was tested via the disinfection of Escherichia coli, with the Cu-ZnO presenting enhanced disinfection compared to pure ZnO. Of the synthesized materials, 7% Cu-ZnO exhibited the best photocatalytic performance, for which the size was ~9 nm. The photocurrent density of the 7% Cu-ZnO samples was also significantly higher than that of pure ZnO. The antifungal activity for 7% Cu-ZnO was also tested on the pathogenic fungi of Fusarium graminearum. The macroconidia of F. graminearum was treated with 7% Cu-ZnO photocatalyst for 5 h, resulting in a three order of magnitude reduction at a concentration of 105 CFU/mL. Fluorescence staining tests were used to verify the survival of macroconidia before and after photocatalytic treatment. ICP-MS was used to confirm that Cu-ZnO met national standards for cu ion precipitation, indicating that Cu-ZnO are environmentally friendly materials.",

            "text": "A continuous deterioration in water quality due to pathogenic pollution has raised significant concerns among researchers worldwide [1\u20133]. Statistics indicate that waterborne diseases caused by water pollution affect millions of people globally and cause about 14,300 deaths every year [4]. The invention of efficient sterilization technology is of great significance for water purification and reduction in the occurrence of water-borne diseases. Thus far, traditional sterilization technologies such as ultraviolet sterilization [5] and antibiotic sterilization [6] have been unable to meet requirements due to drawbacks, including high costs, secondary pollution, and bacterial resistance. Compared with these traditional sterilization methods, photocatalysis-based disinfection technology exhibits tremendous prospects for application in the field of sewage treatment as it is environmentally friendly and causes no secondary pollution [7,8]. The excellent photocatalytic performance of metal oxides makes them an important research object in the field of sewage treatment. A series of metal oxides including TiO2, ZnO, Cu2O, and WO3 have been found to have photocatalytic potential [9\u201311]. The characteristics of non-toxicity, biocompatibility, thermal stability, photostability, and high UV absorption make ZnO a promising photocatalyst [12,13]. However, its low light absorption\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7232. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28207232 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7232 2 of 13\ncapacity and high electron\u2013hole recombination rate limit the application of pure ZnO in the field of photocatalysis [14]. The modification of materials is an important means of widening this narrow range. Transition metals such as Ag [15], Pd [16], Mn [17], and Cu [18], due to their valence states, are easy to change; outer electrons can easily be removed, and they can easily acquire electrons on the d orbital, providing them with redox properties [19]. Hence, they are widely used as modifiers of photocatalysts to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Among the transition metals, Cu is the most prominent; on the one hand, it has a certain bactericidal effect, which enables it to create a synergistic effect with photocatalytic fungicides [20]. On the other hand, it has the lowest cost and good biocompatibility compared with other transition metals [21]. The Cu-doping of ZnO is a good strategy for improving its photocatalytic efficiency. In this study, Cu-doped ZnO was prepared using the solvothermal method. The solvothermal process refers to the process of decomposition or chemical reaction between precursors induced by the presence of a solvent in a closed reaction vessel at a temperature higher than the boiling point of the solvent [22]. Depending on the experimental conditions (pressure and temperature), solvothermal systems can be heterogeneous, subcritical, or supercritical. Wojnarowicz J [23] proposed that the solvothermal method is an environmentally friendly method, and it is recognized as a green chemical method. The main advantages include high speed, good uniformity, and high purity. The experimental results show that the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanomaterials has great potential and can obtain a wide range of product morphology, from quantum dots to core\u2013shell structures and layered structures. In addition, Cu/ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by Fu [24] using the sol\u2013gel method, whereby the maximum degradable rate of methyl orange reached 88% when the initial concentration was 20 mg/L during a photodegradation test of nanomaterials. Kuriakose et al. synthesized Cu/ZnO using the wet chemical method and examined the mechanism underlying its excellent photocatalytic performance; the authors attributed this performance to the formation of electronic defects, as well as the formation of a heterojunction between Cu and ZnO, promoting carrier separation [25]. Cu-doped ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by Khan [26] using the coprecipitation method, while the antibacterial activity of different strains was studied by means of the agar diffusion method. The results indicate that synthesized Cu-doped ZnO nanoparticles have excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with inhibitory regions of 31 \u00b1 0.4 mm and 27 \u00b1 0.6 mm, respectively. Subsequently, Cu-doped ZnO was synthesized by Rashid [27] using the coprecipitation method. The author highlighted that the disinfection effect of ZnO on Gram-positive bacteria was significantly different (p < 0.05) before and after Cu-doping. By observing the structural changes before and after doping, the reason for the increase in the photocatalytic activity was found to probably be the transformation of nanoclusters into nanorods when Cu was doped into ZnO. Thus, ZnO doped with Cu produces good photocatalytic activity. In the present study, Cu-doped ZnO was synthesized with the aim of achieving an enhanced photocatalytic effect. The characterization of the structural morphology, element composition, and valence distribution of the nanomaterials was proved using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The carrier separation performance of Cu-ZnO was illustrated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and isothermal transformation (I-T) curves at an electrochemical workstation. The light absorption performance of Cu-ZnO was characterized via ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The nanomaterial\u2019s actual photocatalytic efficiency was determined by measuring the effect of Cu-ZnO on the Gramnegative bacteria E. coli and the pathogenic fungus F. graminearum. Finally, the safety assessment for Cu-ZnO of the release of Cu ions was tested using ICP-MS. Herein, we provide a promising environmentally friendly and visible light excitation catalyst as an alternative method to disinfect bacteria and agricultural pathogenic fungi.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7232 3 of 13"

The height of the peaks is related to the separation of electrons and holes, whereby the lower the peak, the higher the separation, and the corresponding photocatalytic efficiency also increases. Figure 6 shows that the peak of 7% Cu-ZnO has the lowest height, followed (in descending order) by 10%, 5%, 20%, 3%, and 1% Cu-ZnO; the corresponding electron\u2013hole separation efficiency is proportional to the sterilization performance [39,40]. The electron impedance spectrum (EIS) shown in Figure 7a reflects the electron\u2013hole recombination efficiency of the materials. The size of the radius is used to reflect the recombination rate of electrons and holes in the high-frequency region, whereby the larger the radius, the higher the electron\u2013hole recombination rate.

Figure 10 shows the release of Cu ions into water [41], taking 20% Cu-ZnO oxide as an example (tested using ICP-MS). The results show that the solubility of Cu ions was 0.07 mg/L before visible light irradiation, which may be due to the dissolution of a small number of copper clusters during ultrasonic dispersion. These dissolved Cu ions may have had an impact on the number of E. coli in the sterilization experiment, which supports our previous conclusion that the material also has a bactericidal effect under dark conditions due to the Cu ions. With the increase in illumination time, the solubility of the Cu ions in the composite gradually increased, reaching 0.13 mg/L at 150 min. The hygienic standard for drinking water [42] (GB57492006) issued by the UK Ministry of Health states that the detection limit for Cu ion concentrations in drinking water is 1.0 mg/L [43]; the maximum Cu ion solubility of 20% Cu-ZnO nanoparticles in this experiment was significantly less than 1.0 mg/L. Therefore, the concentration of Cu ions dissolved in water with the Cu-ZnO nanoparticles synthesized in this experiment was far below the safety threshold, and the potential for impact on the human body and the environment is therefore negligible.\nFigure 9.

A total of 0.15 M (1.252 g) ZnCl2 and CuCl2 with different molar ratios (Cu: Zn of 0:0.15 mM, 0.0015 mM:0.15 mM, 0.0045 mM:0.15 mM, 0.0075 mM:0.15 mM, 0.0105 mM:0.15 mM, 0.015 mM:0.15 mM, and 0.003 mM:0.15 mM) were added to one beaker, and the mixture was stirred until it was completely dissolved; this was recorded as solution A. A fixed molar ratio of NaOH to ZnCl2 and CuCl2 of 2:1 was added to another beaker, and this was also stirred until it was completely dissolved; this was recorded as solution B. Then, solution B was added dropwise to solution A and mixed well to obtain solution C. Then, the pH of solution C was adjusted to neutral using hydrochloric acid. Finally, solution C was transferred to a 100 mL reactor and reacted at 80 \u25e6C for 2 h. After the reaction, Cu-ZnO nanocomposites with different proportions were obtained after washing (water washi g and alcohol washing alternately) and drying; these were recorded as pure ZnO and 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, and 20% Cu-ZnO."

The nanomaterials\u2019 photoelectric properties were characterized via UV-vis (U-3900H, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), BET (TriStar II Plus 3030, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) transient photocurrent response (I-T) (CHI660E, Corrtest Instruments, Wuhan, China), and electronic impedance (EIS) (CHI660E, Corrtest Instruments, Wuhan, China).\nElectrochemical Workstation\nThe transient photocurrent response (I-T) and electronic impedance (EIS) of the composite were measured using an electrochemical work station. The internal resistance and responsiveness to visible light of the synthetic material were obtained by testing the photoelectric properties of the sample. The specific methods and principles were as follows: 5 mg of the sample was dissolved in 5 mL of absolute ethanol; 1 mL of this solution was extracted ultrasonically mixed with water; and an FTO conductive surface was coated with the mixed liquid to form an area 1 cm2 in size. On this 1 cm2 area, the working electrode was installed using a platinum sheet electrode as the comparison electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode; 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution was prepared as the electrolyte for the system, the light source was a 300 W xenon lamp W (ultraviolet light was blocked using a >400 nm filter), and a quartz beaker was used. An ordinary beaker could not be used in this experiment as the intensity of the light would have been weakened to a certain extent. The amount of photogenerated charge generated by the material under illumination was reflected by the photocurrent curve during different periods. Before the photocurrent test, the light source needed a stability time of 5 min, and following that, every 20 s was taken as a test time (the test was conducted alternately under dark and light conditions, and each test time was 20 s, forming a complete cycle). The light source was blocked with a tin foil baffle to create the dark condition, and for the light condition, the baffle was removed. These two treatments formed a stable current. After five such cycles, the stability and photocatalytic performance of the material was determined. The resistance of the materials to conductive media was determined by AC impedance. The charge transfer ability of the materials, as well as their photocatalytic activity, was indirectly determined by comparing the internal resistance of the different materials."

The characterization results show that the synthesized nanomaterials are Cu-doped ZnO nanomaterials. The photocurrent density of the 7% Cu-ZnO was also significantly enhanced compared to that of pure ZnO. The sterilization experiments proved that the photocatalytic disinfection performance of Cu-ZnO is significantly superior to that of pure ZnO. Among the synthesized materials, 7% Cu-ZnO presented the best photocatalytic sterilization performance, killing almost all bacteria and fungi spore within 120 min. In addition to this, Cu-ZnO are environmentally friendly materials, as demonstrated by ICP-MS testing.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.S. and J.Z.; methodology, R.N. and S.L.; investigation, M.Z.
