"The association between reporting transparency and the accuracy of cost imputation warrants further research. While we promote the efficient secondary utilisation of published costs, we also encourage authors to report their primary costing research results with transferability in mind, following applicable international guidelines [15, 60]."

"To improve the accuracy of predictions, further research is needed on the explainable variability and transferability of costs within MENA involving specific diseases, sub-regions [64â€“67] or special cost categories such as productivity loss [56]. We hypothesize that if costs are reported by more countries and the reporting quality improves, more accurate imputations will be possible. We also hypothesize that cost transfer coefficients differ between high- and low- to middle-income countries as well as between different cost types and disease areas. Also, due to the specifics of health systems, the costtransfer coefficient may be specific to geographic regions or even country-pairs. Furthermore, as more data become available for estimation or as health systems evolve over time, cost transfer coefficient estimates may also change."

"Although some of these hypotheses can be studied from the cost database described in this paper, the methodological heterogeneity and varying reporting quality of costing studies in MENA may represent challenges for further studies."
