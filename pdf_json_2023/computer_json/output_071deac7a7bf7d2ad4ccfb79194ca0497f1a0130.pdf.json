    "abstractText": "Commercializing data and data-related services has gained in importance in recent years. Driven by digitalization and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), companies and individuals continuously generate vast amounts of data. Data marketplaces have emerged to support these data providers in selling their data to different data consumers. However, data marketplaces face challenges in different data governance decision domains that inhibit their adoption. To get a better understanding of how data marketplaces counteract these challenges, this paper develops a taxonomy of data governance decision domains in data marketplaces. We used a taxonomy development method to inspect 13 data marketplaces from eight countries. The resulting taxonomy shows an overview of mechanisms concerning data quality, data security, data architecture, metadata, data lifecycle, data storage, and data pricing. We discuss common instantiation patterns, highlight gaps, and propose possible solutions. The taxonomy sets a foundation for further research and theory-building on data marketplaces. Practitioners can use the taxonomy to develop customized data governance strategies for data marketplaces.",

For some time, digitalization focused on the automation of backoffice and customer-oriented processes (Urbach, et\u00a0al., 2019). Today, digitalization increasingly encompasses the collection and usage of data, adding to global data growth (IDC, 2018). Monitoring and collecting data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, mobile devices, and business processes not only facilitate companies in creating innovative products and improving customer experience. These activities also open\nnew ways of monetizing data as a product itself. According to Forrester Research (2018), 48 percent of global data and analytics decision-makers commercialize the data they own by either selling it or the derived insights. In doing so, data becomes part of a company\u2019s revenue model. Simultaneously, the demand for access to external data sources is growing (Forrester, 2018). Companies need diverse datasets to train machine learning models and enable improved decisionmaking. For example, sharing data between manufacturers can help to improve predictive maintenance algorithms and therefore increase machine performance (World Economic Forum, 2020). Additionally, making more data available for analysis supports tackling societal and environmental challenges (European Commission, 2020).\nData marketplaces have been emerging in recent years to match the supply and demand for data. Data marketplaces provide a digital platform enabling data providers to sell their data to data consumers. Concurrently, data consumers get access to otherwise inaccessible data sources. Though data marketplaces bring along benefits, they pose multiple challenges for data governance. These challenges manifest in a variety of issues within different data governance decision domains, including how to protect data, ensure data quality, and define and model\nResponsible Editor: Martin Smits\n* Jan vom Brocke jan.vom.brocke@uni.li\nRene Abraham rene.abraham@uni.li\nJohannes Schneider johannes.schneider@uni.li\n1 Institute of\u00a0Information Systems, University of\u00a0Liechtenstein, F\u00fcrst-Franz-Josef-Strasse, 9490\u00a0Vaduz, Liechtenstein\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\n1 3\n22 Page 2 of 13\ndata consistently. Regarding data security, companies fear a loss of control over their data, which could lead to a competitive disadvantage (Roman & Stefano, 2016; Spiekermann, 2019; van den Broek & van Veenstra, 2015). Concerning data quality, data consumers require insights into the quality of data products before they can use them for certain purposes (Janssen et\u00a0al., 2012). If data products are further processed and used as the basis for producing other goods, a high level of data quality is required (Stahl et\u00a0al., 2017). Issues with the quality of data products can hamper efforts to provide a marketplace service (Smith et\u00a0al., 2016). Regarding data architecture, the lack of standards inhibits data sharing (European Commission, 2022). It also poses barriers to finding, analyzing, and processing published data (Smith et\u00a0al., 2016). These challenges indicate that further research is required regarding data governance in the context of data marketplaces.\nThis paper adopts a comprehensive perspective by establishing a taxonomy of data governance decision domains in data marketplaces. A taxonomy structures and organizes the body of knowledge within a certain field (Glass & Vessey, 1995). It builds a foundation for future research by allowing researchers to determine relationships between the taxonomy\u2019s dimensions and other variables of interest. A taxonomy is also helpful in identifying divergence in previous research findings (Sabherwal & King, 1995). We aim to create a taxonomy that describes the different mechanisms available to instantiate data governance decision domains in the context of data marketplaces. Hence, our study answers the following research question: how do data marketplaces instantiate data governance decision domains? Our study advances the body of knowledge on data governance in data marketplaces, which has to date been little researched (Koutroumpis et\u00a0al., 2020). Our findings also contribute to the body of knowledge on the wider topic of data governance for ecosystems of public and private organizations (Tiwana et\u00a0al., 2014).\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we present the theoretical background regarding data marketplaces and data governance decision domains. Second, we describe the taxonomy development method applied for the study. Third, we present our findings concerning the dimensions, subdimensions, and characteristics of the taxonomy. Fourth, we discuss our findings in the context of scientific literature and present the final taxonomy. In doing so, we highlight current limitations in the instantiation of data governance decision domains. We then conclude with a summary, describe the limitations of our study, and suggest avenues for future research."

            "text": "Data marketplaces are digital platforms that offer data or data-related services as primary goods (Stahl et\u00a0al., 2016).\nData goods encompass manually and automatically created personal and commercial data, such as age, gender, purchase history, and IoT sensor data. Data-related services comprise capabilities such as data aggregation, analysis, and visualization (Roman & Stefano, 2016; Spiekermann, 2019). In our study, we focus on data marketplaces that act as independent intermediaries connecting two or more market participants (Stahl et\u00a0al., 2016). The main actors involved in data trades are data providers offering data, and data consumers buying data. Marketplace providers offer an infrastructure that allows these actors to upload, discover, buy, and sell data (Spiekermann, 2019; Stahl et\u00a0al., 2016).\nData governance decision domains in\u00a0data marketplaces\nData governance is a framework that provides structure and formalization for the management of data (Morabito, 2015; Rifaie et\u00a0al., 2009; Weber et\u00a0al., 2009). As part of data governance, organizations typically need to specify what must be governed, i.e., the scope of data (Abraham et\u00a0al., 2019), who governs the data, i.e., the roles and governance bodies (Khatri & Brown, 2010; Otto, 2011), and what decisions must be made in data-related areas, i.e., the data governance decision domains (Abraham et\u00a0al., 2019; Khatri & Brown, 2010; Lee et\u00a0al., 2019). This study deals with the last component. Based on Khatri and Brown (2010) and Abraham et\u00a0al. (2019), we distinguish between the following six data governance decision domains: (a) data quality; (b) data security; (c) data architecture; (d) metadata; (e) data lifecycle; (f) data storage and infrastructure. Based on Schreieck et\u00a0al. (2016) we add (g) data pricing as an additional data governance decision domain since data marketplaces contain the aspect of data trade and data valuation. In the remainder of this section, we describe the seven data governance decision domains that form the foundation of the taxonomy."

            "text": "Data quality refers to the ability of data to satisfy its usage requirements in a given context (de Abreu Faria et\u00a0al., 2013; Khatri & Brown, 2010). Data quality is characterized by quality dimensions such as completeness, credibility, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency of data (DAMA International, 2009; Khatri & Brown, 2010). Scientific literature proposes both preventive and reactive measures to manage data quality (Otto et\u00a0al., 2012). In the context of data marketplaces, preventive measures inhibit data providers from onboarding data products with insufficient quality. For example, data providers apply automated test scripts to examine the quality of their data products before making the products available on\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\n1 3\nPage 3 of 13 22\nthe data marketplace (Smith et\u00a0al., 2016). Reactive measures aim to support the identification and reporting of data quality issues after data products have been made available on the data marketplace. Examples include rating systems that allow data consumers to rate and provide feedback on data products (Zuiderwijk et\u00a0al., 2014) or data providers (Mi\u0161ura & \u017dagar, 2016; Ramachandran et\u00a0al., 2018).\nData\u00a0security\nData security refers to the preservation of security requirements concerning the accessibility, authenticity, availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and reliability of data (Carretero et\u00a0al., 2017; de Abreu Faria et\u00a0al., 2013; Donaldson & Walker, 2004; ISACA, 2013). In the context of data marketplaces, requirements concern the control of when, to whom, and to what extent data is being sold (Mi\u0161ura & \u017dagar, 2016; Tzianos et\u00a0al., 2019) and how and where data is being used (Otto & Jarke, 2019; Roman & Stefano, 2016). To store data confidentially, data marketplaces use encryption techniques (Roman & Stefano, 2016; Shaabany et\u00a0al., 2016; Tzianos et\u00a0al., 2019). To protect sensitive data during data usage, data marketplaces apply methods that only provide access to parts of the data or even fully restrict access to raw data. Examples include the utilization of anonymization techniques to hide identity data (Fung et\u00a0al., 2010; Ha et\u00a0al., 2019) and the application of homomorphic encryption to enable mathematical operations on encrypted data (Roman & Stefano, 2016). To control data usage and protect data ownership rights, data marketplaces apply data usage terms that describe the appropriate uses of data (Otto & Jarke, 2019; Truong et\u00a0al., 2012; Tzianos et\u00a0al., 2019). Similarly, data contracts help to negotiate and assure the authorizations, obligations, and prohibitions on data covered by the contract (Allen, et\u00a0al., 2014; Matteucci et\u00a0al., 2012). They enable data providers to have a remedy against data consumers in case of contract infringements (Truong et\u00a0al., 2012)."

Data architecture also contains comprehensive data models on a conceptual, logical, and physical level (DAMA International, 2009; Watson et\u00a0al., 2004). In the context of data marketplaces, data standards are often mentioned as being crucial to supporting interoperability and data exchange between data providers and data consumers (Lis & Otto, 2020; Spiekermann, 2019). However, data marketplaces apply different approaches regarding the data format to facilitate data exchange, ranging from standardized through proprietary to hybrid. Within the standardized approach, data marketplaces\ndefine standardized vocabularies and formats, to which all marketplace participants must adhere (Ito, 2016; Otto & Jarke, 2019). The proprietary approach allows data providers to offer their data products using their own proprietary data formats (\u00d6zyilmaz et\u00a0al., 2018). The most convenient approach for both data providers and consumers is a hybrid approach, where data providers can offer data products in proprietary formats, which then are automatically normalized on the marketplace platform using a standardized data model (Nagorny et\u00a0al., 2018)."

            "heading": "Metadata",
            "text": "Metadata represents data about data (DAMA International, 2009; Were & Moturi, 2017). It gives meaning and context to data by providing a structured description of the content, quality, and other characteristics of data (Hovenga & Grain, 2013; Khatri & Brown, 2010). Within data marketplaces, rich contextual metadata is important for supporting data consumers in finding data of interest (Tzianos et\u00a0al., 2019), determining the usefulness of data products (Ramachandran et\u00a0al., 2018), and correctly interpreting and processing data (Zuiderwijk et\u00a0al., 2014). Scientific literature provides two approaches regarding the metadata vocabulary in the context of data marketplaces. The first approach contains a marketplace-specific metadata vocabulary, which is used by data providers for describing and publishing metadata, and by data consumers for looking up and retrieving metadata (Otto & Jarke, 2019). The second approach comprises the application of standardized metadata vocabularies such as CERIF and DCAT (W3C, 2020; Zuiderwijk et\u00a0al., 2014).\nData\u00a0lifecycle\nThe data lifecycle represents the approach of defining, collecting, creating, using, maintaining, archiving, and deleting data (Khatri & Brown, 2010; Morabito, 2015). In the context of data marketplaces, the main data lifecycle phases are data onboarding, data discovery, data purchase, and data usage. During data onboarding, data providers capture, create, and store data, which is made available to the data marketplace (Otto & Jarke, 2019). Within the data discovery phase, data consumers try to find the right data for their purpose (Mi\u0161ura & \u017dagar, 2016; Ramachandran et\u00a0al., 2018). During the data purchase step, data consumers pay for data products, and data providers grant access to the purchased data (Musso et\u00a0al., 2019; Tzianos et\u00a0al., 2019). In the data usage phase, data consumers use the data, e.g., by enriching and aggregating it (Otto & Jarke, 2019)."

In a data marketplace context, one major question concerns how the data should be stored. Spiekermann (2019) distinguishes between the centralized, decentralized, and hybrid storage approaches. With the centralized approach, data products are offered by data providers via a central location such as cloud infrastructure. With the decentralized approach, data products remain with data providers. The hybrid approach is a combination of both the centralized and the decentralized approaches."

            "heading": "Data pricing",
            "text": "With the trade of data between independent parties, the question of how to price data products becomes relevant. Data marketplaces often apply pay-per-use or subscription-based pricing models in line with their business models. Within a pay-per-use pricing model, data marketplaces charge data consumers for each consumed data product (Spiekermann, 2019; Truong et\u00a0al., 2012). Within a subscription-based pricing model, data consumers have access to data products for a certain period. In addition to pay-per-use and subscriptionbased pricing models, data products can be provided free of charge. This often includes data from public authorities and non-profit organizations (Spiekermann, 2019). We also identified hybrid pricing models, such as the freemium pricing model, where data providers offer basic data products free of charge while charging a premium for more detailed data products (Thomas & Leiponen, 2016). Furthermore, data pricing contains the determination of the right price for data products (Truong et\u00a0al., 2012). Apart from fixed prices for data products, data marketplaces apply more dynamic pricing strategies such as bidding (Maruyama et\u00a0al., 2013; ParraArnau, 2018), progressive pricing (Spiekermann, 2019), the \u201cpay what you want\u201d approach (Zuiderwijk et\u00a0al., 2014), and packaged pricing (Spiekermann, 2019)."

The development of a taxonomy is a multistep process (Fiedler et\u00a0al., 1996). We use the taxonomy development method by Nickerson et\u00a0al. (2013) which comprises four main steps. The first step is the identification of the meta-characteristic. This is based on the purpose of the taxonomy and guides the choice of the remaining characteristics within the taxonomy. The second\nstep comprises the selection of objective and subjective ending conditions. The third step initiates an iterative approach for the development of the taxonomy. Within each development cycle, the researcher can choose between an empiricalto-conceptual or a conceptual-to-empirical approach. The fourth step contains the validation of the taxonomy against the objective and subjective ending conditions. The taxonomy development ends if all objective and subjective ending conditions are fulfilled. Otherwise, the taxonomy development continues with the third step."

We considered objects for inclusion if they met the following two criteria: (a) the object represents a data marketplace or a data marketplace protocol enabling trading between data providers and data consumers; (b) the main products traded on the data marketplace are data products or data services. We selected multiple objects since the evidence is considered more robust and generalizable than from a single object (Herriott & Firestone, 1983).\nWe retrieved an initial list of 177 data marketplaces via the datarade.ai website. In a first round, we reviewed all 177 data marketplaces against the two inclusion criteria and reduced the list to 63 data marketplaces. In a second round, we reviewed the remaining 63 data marketplaces and excluded instances where the marketplace provider did not act as an independent intermediary but rather as an aggregator of different data providers. We also excluded instances which did not provide sufficient official and openly accessible information to be analyzed. In doing so, we reduced the list to 13 data marketplaces to be included in our study. The selected data marketplaces enabled trading personal data, corporate data, and IoT sensor data. Personal data represents data about natural persons such as gender, date of birth, place of residence, and personal interests. Corporate data comprises data about companies, such as company descriptions and financial market data. IoT sensor data encompasses data specifically collected from such IoT devices as sensors installed in cars, smart homes, and smart factories. Table\u00a01 provides an overview of the examined data marketplaces.\nWe consider the sample set of data marketplaces as appropriate for studying the instantiation of data governance decision domains since they support various types of data products and are located in diverse countries. Also, some data marketplaces enable the creation and sale of data analysis results, which require the management of additional data stakeholders and complex data infrastructures. The primary source of evidence for our study was official publications\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\nPage 5 of 13 22\nfrom the sample set of data marketplaces. We collected data provided in whitepapers, reports, and on data marketplace websites."

Since our purpose was to investigate how data marketplaces instantiated data governance decision domains, we chose data governance instantiation in data marketplaces as our meta-characteristic. We then determined the ending conditions for the validation of our taxonomy. We omitted the objective ending condition that at least one object was classified under every characteristic. We perceived characteristics solely derived from scientific literature as valid because they provided for differentiation and thus robustness of the taxonomy. Tables\u00a02 and 3 provide an overview of the selected objective and subjective ending conditions. After each taxonomy development cycle, we checked to see whether the resulting taxonomy met all selected objective and subjective ending conditions. If the test result was negative, we initiated a new development cycle.\nIn total, we conducted four development cycles to reach the final version of the taxonomy. In the first taxonomy development cycle, we used a conceptual-to-empirical approach and conceptualized dimensions, subdimensions, and characteristics taken from scientific literature. Based on Khatri and Brown (2010) and Abraham et\u00a0al. (2019), we chose the following data governance decision domains as the initial dimensions: data quality, data security, data architecture, metadata, data lifecycle, and data storage and infrastructure. The resulting version of the taxonomy gave us a first impression of the taxonomy structure. During the second development cycle, we applied an empirical-to-conceptual approach. We used the open coding technique to turn collected raw data from the sample of objects into dimensions, subdimensions, and characteristics (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). We first assigned labels to key areas of text using a software tool for content analysis (Tallon et\u00a0al., 2014). In doing so, we created 167 codes in total. Then, we reviewed the codes and filtered for those with a focus on the meta-characteristic, which reduced the number of codes to 80. We searched for common patterns among the codes and underlying raw data to derive generic characteristics. Afterward, we grouped related characteristics under dimensions and subdimensions.\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\n1 3\n22 Page 6 of 13\nDuring this analysis step, we added data pricing as a new dimension, among others. We conducted a third development cycle because we had previously added the data pricing dimension. Also, the validation via objective ending conditions showed that the characteristics within the data lifecycle dimension were not mutually exclusive. We applied a conceptual-to-empirical approach to derive additional relevant subdimensions and characteristics from scientific literature for the data pricing dimension. Furthermore, we restructured characteristics within the data lifecycle dimension to make the characteristics mutually exclusive. Since we restructured characteristics, we did not meet all objective ending conditions. Therefore, we conducted a fourth empirical-to-conceptual development cycle and classified again all 13 data marketplaces using the final version of the taxonomy. As we met all objective and subjective ending conditions this time, we concluded the taxonomy development process. Figure\u00a01 shows an overview of the taxonomy development process."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Our findings show that data marketplaces have multiple options to instantiate data governance decision domains. We observed certain tendencies, but also limitations of specific mechanisms. In the following, we discuss our main findings in the context of scientific literature and present our final taxonomy.\nRegarding data security, our findings would suggest that data marketplaces offer limited protection of sensitive data. Though data marketplaces apply anonymization techniques, Narayanan\u00a0and Shmatikov (2008) have demonstrated that the de-anonymization of datasets is possible with little auxiliary information. Secured execution environments, which restrict direct access to raw data, promise a higher level of protection. Nevertheless, in cases where raw data is used to train machine learning algorithms, adversaries could identify the raw data by using model inversion attacks (Fredrikson et\u00a0al., 2015). It becomes essential, therefore, for data providers to undertake a thorough check to assess whether their data products comprise sensitive data. Furthermore, in most analyzed data marketplaces, data providers transfer data products to data consumers. Thus, the main mechanism to control data usage and protect data ownership rights is the application of data contracts between data providers and consumers. However, the application of data contracts cannot fully prevent the illegal and malevolent copying and reselling of data products. In cases of unauthorized reselling, being able to prove data ownership is essential. Technologybased data usage control mechanisms such as watermarking could help to prove data ownership rights. By applying watermarking, data providers could embed watermark data such as data ownership information into data products (Agarwal\u00a0et al., 2019; Vlachos et\u00a0al., 2015).\nFurthermore, our findings would suggest that data quality management within data marketplaces is still at an early stage. Almost half of the data marketplaces did not actively approach the topic of ensuring data quality. Where we identified measures, these were mainly rating systems consistent with those proposed by Mi\u0161ura and \u017dagar (2016), Ramachandran et\u00a0al. (2018), and Zuiderwijk et\u00a0al. (2014). Using these reactive approaches, the responsibility for identifying and reporting data quality issues often lies with data consumers. A hybrid approach comprising both preventive and reactive measures can help to overcome this drawback. For example, guided approaches such as LANG can help data consumers reactively identify data quality issues in datasets for which they have minimal control or knowledge of underlying rules (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019). Simultaneously, data marketplace providers can use LANG to prevent flawed data products from being onboarded on the marketplace. Another solution comprises the provisioning of warranties for data products. If data providers do not deliver data products at the expected level of quality, data consumers have the right to cancel the purchase and demand a refund. The terms and conditions could either be stipulated by law or by data marketplace providers similar to guarantees provided by marketplaces such as Amazon (Amazon, 2022) and payment providers such as PayPal (PayPal, 2022).\nIn terms of data architecture, our findings do not reveal a clear tendency towards a specific data formatting approach. Instead, our findings would suggest that the approaches described by Tzianos et\u00a0al. (2019), \u00d6zyilmaz et\u00a0al. (2018), and Nagorny et\u00a0al. (2018) are valid in different contexts. Data marketplaces, which aim to support data consumers in the automatic processing of data products, are likely to provide a standardized data format for the data payload. This applies in particular to data products that are published regularly or in real-time such as data streams. Data marketplaces that want to keep adoption barriers low for data providers might enable the use of proprietary data formats. This might especially be the case for data marketplaces new on the market. Those data marketplaces that focus on convenience for both data providers and data consumers might apply a hybrid approach.\nRegarding data storage and infrastructure, our findings show a tendency towards decentralized storage solutions. Preserving data within data providers\u2019 storage systems offers data providers an increased level of control over their data assets (Spiekermann, 2019). Also, storing data using distributed storage nodes enables the scalability of storage and facilitates the availability of data and fault tolerance through data replication. These findings contrast with data governance in traditional companies where the inclusion of external IT infrastructure is negatively related to data governance maturity (Borgman et\u00a0al., 2016). Also, the storage of data in several disparate databases often inhibits the accessibility and consistency of\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\n1 3\n22 Page 10 of 13\ndata (Cheong & Chang, 2007; Tallon et\u00a0al., 2014). The high level of standardization and integration within the marketplace platform architectures could be reasons why a decentralized storage approach is successfully applied.\nConcerning data pricing, our results confirm earlier findings showing that the pay-per-use model and the subscription-based model are the more common pricing models applied in data marketplaces (Truong et\u00a0al., 2012). Most data marketplaces within our sample applied one of these two pricing models. However, we also identified data marketplaces that allowed data providers to offer data products using a pricing model of their choice. This approach might support marketplace adoption as it might attract more data marketplace participants. Within the set of dynamic pricing strategies, we only identified bidding as an applied pricing strategy, omitting other dynamic pricing strategies such as progressive pricing, \u201cpay what you want\u201d, or packaged pricing. We suspect there are different reasons behind this result. Progressive pricing is applied where the dissemination of data products is to be restricted (Spiekermann, 2019). Given that data marketplaces are fairly novel, data providers have likely no incentive to restrict the dissemination of their data products. Furthermore, the commercial interest of data providers and data marketplaces pre-empts the application of a \u201cpay what you want\u201d pricing approach. However, increased adoption of data marketplaces could bring along the application of additional pricing strategies.\nFigure\u00a02 shows our resulting taxonomy of data governance decision domains in data marketplaces. Per characteristic, the number in the bottom right corner illustrates how often we found that characteristic within the analyzed data\nmarketplaces. A hybrid characteristic indicates that a data marketplace applies a combination of the characteristics within the respective subdimension. The taxonomy meets all selected objective ending conditions. Each dimension of the taxonomy consists of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive characteristics. All objects were examined. During the last development cycle, we did not merge or split any objects. We also did not add, merge, or split any dimensions, subdimensions, or characteristics during the last development cycle. Every dimension, subdimension, characteristic, and combination of characteristics is unique within the taxonomy. In addition, the taxonomy meets all subjective ending conditions. The taxonomy is concise since the number of dimensions is in the proposed range of seven plus or minus two. The taxonomy is robust since the added characteristics provide for differentiation among objects. The taxonomy is comprehensive since we were able to classify all 13 data marketplaces. By adding dimensions and characteristics during development cycles, we were able to demonstrate that the taxonomy is extendible. Furthermore, the taxonomy is explanatory because the dimensions, subdimensions, and characteristics provide explanations of the nature of the objects."

Facilitating the exchange of data between independent market participants has the potential to generate significant economic,\nElectronic Markets (2023) 33:22\n1 3\nPage 11 of 13 22\nsocietal, and environmental benefits. However, the fear of unintentionally releasing sensitive data, the lack of control over data usage, alongside accessibility and interoperability issues create trust-related and technical barriers to data sharing (World Economic Forum, 2020). To overcome these barriers, the trade and exchange of data should be accompanied by robust data governance practices, increasing the level of certainty and producing new opportunities. Hence, the research reported in this paper analyzed the emerging topic of data marketplaces from a data governance perspective. The following research question framed our study: how do data marketplaces instantiate data governance decision domains? We answered this question by developing a taxonomy comprising the subdimensions and characteristics of data governance decision domains in the context of data marketplaces.\nOur study has the following limitations. As the primary source of evidence, we reviewed official documentation such as whitepapers, reports, and information provided on data marketplace websites. Future research should conduct case studies collecting data from interviews and observations to enhance our findings. In addition, we used a sample size of 13 data marketplaces. Future research should examine a larger sample size to validate the robustness and comprehensiveness of our taxonomy. Furthermore, our data did not allow for rigorous testing of how different types of data products influence the instantiation of data governance decision domains. Future research should analyze the possible configurations of data governance decision domains based on different types of data products. Also, future research should investigate which roles and governance bodies have the decision-making authority within each decision domain and which marketplace actor takes on which role.\nThe results of our study advance scientific literature. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate data marketplaces through a data governance lens and thus combine these two research strands. The taxonomy of data governance decision domains offers a common terminology that can be used by researchers to share their findings with other members of the information systems community. Moreover, the taxonomy represents a foundation for further scientific investigation and theory-building. For example, the taxonomy can be used to study relationships between the taxonomy concepts and other variables of interest (Glass & Vessey, 1995). The taxonomy also enables researchers to understand divergence in previous research findings regarding data marketplaces (Sabherwal & King, 1995). Additionally, the taxonomy can be used to define data governance archetypes for data marketplaces. From a practitioner\u2019s perspective, the taxonomy highlights relevant data governance decision domains and instantiation options in the context of data marketplaces. When trading and exchanging data with third parties, neglecting aspects such as data security,\nprivacy, and data quality can have unforeseen consequences. Marketplace providers can use our findings to develop a data governance strategy in a structured and thoughtful manner. Our results can also be used by traditional companies aiming to implement an internal data marketplace.\nFunding Open access funding provided by University of Liechtenstein"
