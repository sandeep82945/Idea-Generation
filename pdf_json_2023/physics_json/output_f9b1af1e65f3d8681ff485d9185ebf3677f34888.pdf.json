    "abstractText": "Thermostable enzymes are enzymes that can withstand elevated temperatures as high as 50 \u00b0C without altering their structure or distinctive features. The potential of thermostable enzymes to increase the conversion rate at high temperature has been identified as a key factor in enhancing the efficiency of industrial operations. Performing procedures at higher temperatures with thermostable enzymes minimises the risk of microbial contamination, which is one of the most significant benefits. In addition, it helps reduce substrate viscosity, improve transfer speeds, and increase solubility during reaction operations. Thermostable enzymes offer enormous industrial potential as biocatalysts, especially cellulase and xylanase, which have garnered considerable amount of interest for biodegradation and biofuel applications. As the usage of enzymes becomes more common, a range of performance-enhancing applications are being explored. This article offers a bibliometric evaluation of thermostable enzymes. Scopus databases were searched for scientific articles. The findings indicated that thermostable enzymes are widely employed in biodegradation as well as in biofuel and biomass production. Japan, the United States, China, and India, as along with the institutions affiliated with these nations, stand out as the academically most productive in the field of thermostable enzymes. This study\u2019s analysis exposed a vast number of published papers that demonstrate the industrial potential of thermostable enzymes. These results highlight the significance of thermostable enzyme research for a variety of applications.",

            "text": "Recent developments in biological based materials for a variety of applications have begun to penetrate the industrial sector [1, 2]. As a result, several industries are now taking steps to transition from chemical-based manufacturing to clean biological manufacturing. [3\u20135]. Enzymes are proteins that operate as biological catalysts in biological systems, speeding up reactions and catalyzing chemical reaction functions [6\u20138]. Enzymes are increasingly being used in a wide range of industrial processes due to their great specificity of action. Their benefits include their efficiency in speeding chemical reactions and their selectivity in distinguishing between potential substrates [6, 9, 10]. Enzymes may aid in the development of environmentally friendly processes by displacing toxic chemicals used in industrial manufacturing [11\u201313].\nEnzymes can be utilized in many industrial production processes, enabling the creation of environmentally friendly technology processes without creation of waste and production of hazardous chemicals such as detergent formulations, cheese production, the leather industry and pharmaceuticals industry [8, 14\u201317]. However, the most major difficulty to the widespread commercial deployment of enzymes is their intrinsic fragility under rigorous industrial operations conditions, one of which is that they cannot sustain the process\u2019s high temperature. The majority of enzymes lose activity at higher temperatures, which are typically between 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C [18]. Enzymes derived from thermophiles have affected the *Correspondence: Che Haznie Ayu Che Hussian haznie_ayu@yahoo.com INTI International University & Colleges, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia\ninterest of numerous businesses, including the pharmaceutical, detergent, textile, food, feed industries, leather, and paper, as well as biorefineries [19, 20]. The term for these enzymes is \u201cthermostable enzymes\u201d.\nThermostable enzymes are enzymes that can resist high temperatures, typically between 45\u00a0 \u00b0C and 120\u00a0 \u00b0C [2]. These enzymes not only survive at high temperatures, but they also work in severe environments where humans cannot exist. Thermostable enzymes provide numerous benefits to the industrial sector, including a rapid growth rate, a reduced risk of contamination, a reduction in liquid viscosity, and improved solubility in polymeric substrates and oil [21]. The resistance of thermostable enzymes to proteolysis and chemical denaturation is greater. With these benefits, it is possible to slow down the process of denaturation, which is essential for commercial preparations, and to store them at room temperature for a longer half-life. Many different enzymes have been identified from thermophiles, including cellulases, amylases, xylanases, pectinases, proteases, and lipases [22\u201325].\nNumerous thermophilic microbial taxa, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Pyrococcus, Thermus, Thermotoga, and Aquifex, produce unique enzymes including \u03b1-amylase, lipase, cellulase, xylanase, alkaline phosphatase, polymerase and ligase [18]. Taq polymerase was the first thermostable enzyme to be reported in 1976 [26]. It was discovered from thermal springs of Yellowstone National Park in 1969 and was isolated from Thermus Aquaticus. The ideal temperature for activity was determined to be 75\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C, with a half-life of 2\u00a0h at 92.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C, and 9\u00a0min at 97.5\u00a0\u00b0C [27]. Formerly, DNA polymerases obtained from Escherichia coli were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods [28]. Nevertheless, they lost their enzymatic activity at high temperatures, necessitating the addition of a new polymerase enzyme after each cycle of denaturation and primer hybridization, which was time-consuming and costly. As a result, the availability of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase has an impact on the PCR development process since it can survive the 95\u00a0 \u00b0C required for DNA strand separation without denaturing. Thermophilic microorganisms are occupying several biological niches, including hot springs, deep marine, volcanic sites, compost and deep organic landfills [29]. However, they have been widely investigated in hot springs around the world and are abundant in nature [30]. Hot springs have been identified as natural habitats that are ideal for thermophile colonization.\nSince 1970, numerous studies have been undertaken on thermostable enzymes. As this protein differs from mesophilic enzymes in its structural properties and adaptations to the harsh environment, the majority of\nthe studies have been oriented to studying these characteristics [25, 31]. Thermophiles have rigid cell walls, a high G + C concentration of DNA contents that ultimately alters these protein structure [32]. This component causes these enzymes to have distinct hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, hydrophilic contacts, metal binding and loop deletion or shortening, which eventually results in a superior conformational shape. Enzyme thermostability is typically an intrinsic feature determined by the primary protein structure. The thermostable enzymes were more stable than the mesophilic enzymes because they had larger levels of non-polar amino acids [33]. These amino acids increase the hydrophobicity of proteins, which is directed towards the catalytic pocket and increases the rigidity of proteins [34]. Furthermore, the higher charged of amino acids also enhance the electrostatic interactions in the outer part of protein leading greater ion pair interaction [35]. Studies also revealed that thermostable enzymes contain higher disulphide bonds and hydrophobic bonds [36]. These criteria make the structure of the enzymes more rigid and lead to better folding of the conformational.\nTechnologies for data extraction and synthesis are currently essential due to the abundance of data available. Bibliometric analysis is a statistical methodology that use [37, 38] to analyze and evaluate a significant number of scientific research articles in various fields of knowledge. Bibliometric is very important for uncovering developing trends in a specific topic or field by identifying the relationship of core research or authors across all publications, journal performance, collaboration patterns, and research constituents [39]. The findings of academic publishing analysis have proven to be an excellent method of measuring the impact of research trends [40]. As a result, the researcher can find knowledge gaps concerning the issue and develop new original ideas for investigation and contribution to the specific research topic. Through bibliometric analysis, it is possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of a certain topic and its relationship to specific databases. Utilizing interaction charts, this popular method provides a simple and easy assessment of selected works. The publication year, the most-cited articles, journals, authors, and fields of study were all examined in this study\u2019s bibliometric analysis of thermostable enzymes. Current trends in thermostable enzymes are examined in light of relevant research."

The \"analyze results\" feature of Scopus\u2019s search tools displays the publication year and topic matter of the chosen work. The articles we gathered were examined using VOSviewer version 1.6.15, which was used to import all data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (csv) (www. vosvi ewer. com). VOSviewer is a software tool used in bibliometric analysis by constructing and visualising the networks of publications, documents, sources, authors, organizations, and countries. These networks can be built via citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship relationships. It also provides network mapping of the relationships between bibliometric networks and the topic of interest.\u00a0 In this study, the data were collected to determine the most productive countries, the most highly referenced journals, authors, publications and research trends based on keyword analysis. Several different types and units of analysis were used to construct the results."

All studies on this topic, were focuses more on strategies used to enhance thermostable enzymes, such as molecular, characterization, genetic alteration to improve catalytic activity and purification. Although the quest for thermophiles began 40\u00a0years ago, the discovery of important and novel thermostable enzymes continues to rise, making the search for and isolation of thermophiles an essential topic of research. However, based on the industrial potential of thermostable enzymes, the majority of research focuses on lignocellulosic biodegradation for biofuel production. The biodegradable process requires severe conditions for the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass [67, 79]. Enzymatic degradation is the most effective and environmentally safe method for converting complex\nlignocellulose polymers into fermentable monosaccharides, compared to chemical and physical procedures. Cellulase and xylanase are the thermostable enzymes that are involved in this industrial sector [4, 5, 12]. The usefulness of thermostable cellulases and xylanases is primarily determined by their productivity, thermostability, specific activity, broad pH range and broad substrate specificity. Using genetic engineering, expression control and enzyme immobilization, the thermostability of thermophile cellulase and xylanase has been increased in order to expand their industrial applications. Most approaches involve site-directed mutagenesis, whereas cloning was used to increase the enzymes\u2019 stability."

Thus, it is not difficult to forecast that this area of research is expected to continue to rapidly increase and that more papers will be published in the coming years. For future research, it will be necessary to create strategies for developing thermostable enzymes that can be employed extensively in the biofuel, biodegradation, food, pharmaceutical, textile, bio-based, and animal feed industries. Enzymes are frequently denatured by high temperatures, strong acids and bases, organic solvents, and other harsh conditions, compromising their catalytic capabilities and limiting their applicability in industrial processes. Discovering new thermostable enzymes in extreme environments or performing molecular modification of existing enzymes with poor thermostability using emerging protein engineering technology are now effective methods for getting new thermostable enzymes."
