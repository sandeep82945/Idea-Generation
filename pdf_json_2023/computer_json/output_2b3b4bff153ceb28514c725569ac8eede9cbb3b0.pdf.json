    "abstractText": "Areas in Western Greece are particularly prone to landslides. Usually triggered by earthquakes or intense rainfalls, they cause damage to infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.) and human properties. Hence, there is an urgent need for the implementation of monitoring and landslide prevention methodologies. In the last years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques have been applied for landslide mapping and monitoring. The current study focuses on the systematic and long-term analysis of a landslide that occurred in Ano Kerassovo village, within the region of Western Greece. To precisely measure the current evolution of the landslide, we performed repetitive UAV campaigns in conjunction with corresponding GNSS surveys, covering a time period between February 2021 and April 2023. The identification of surface modification was based on a change detection approach between the generated point clouds. The results are validated through GNSS measurements and field observations. Added to this, we collected archived Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) measurements derived from the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to extend the observation period and gain a more complete understanding of the phenomenon. It is proven that archived PSI measurements can be used as an indicator of possible landslide initialization points and for small-scale large coverage investigations, while UAVs and GNSS data can precisely identify the microscale deformations (centimeter scale).",

            "text": "Landslides are one of the most common hazards worldwide. Triggered by several factors such as earthquakes, weather extremes, volcanic eruptions, etc., they usually manifest instantly. Apart from modifying Earth\u2019s surface, they can cause economic losses and even fatalities [1\u20134]. Hence, the development of strategies for landslide prevention and mitigation is an essential issue [5,6]. Over the last few years, several studies have been carried out on the utilization of remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the investigation of instability phenomena [7,8]. Some of those are analyzing the triggering factors, while others are focusing on the incessant monitoring of landslide-prone locations [9\u201312]. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) constitutes one of the most widely known approaches for evaluating topographic changes [13]. Thus, the utilization of InSAR methods to detect and monitor landslides has been well-documented in several studies over the last few years [14\u201317]. The main advantages of this approach over conventional ones for landslide investigation include the extended spatial coverage, the enhanced spatio-temporal resolution, and the capability of being operated independently of weather conditions. In light of this, advanced InSAR methodologies, based on the multitemporal analysis of SAR data stacks, were applied in order to detect extremely slow\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2870. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15112870 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2870 2 of 18\nmovements estimated at a few mm/year. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) constitute the most widely used approaches for the long-term monitoring of slow-moving landslides [18\u201322]. It has been proven that PSI appears to be slightly more accurate compared to the SBAS approach [23]. In more detail, some researchers have utilized PSI measurements derived from the Sentinel-1 constellation to evaluate landslide kinematics and subsequently understand the sliding mechanisms [24], while others focused on creating methodologies for the continuous assessment or update of landslide inventories through PSI measurements [25,26]. Moreover, a post-processing PSI procedure has been proposed for the identification of slowly moving regions in the French Alps and the subsequent extraction of areas of active deformation with velocities lower than 1.6 cm/y [27]. Another well-known solution for landslide monitoring is based on the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors [28,29]. Although GNSS measurements for topographic monitoring purposes have been used since the 1990s, the advances in technology and computer science prove that it is still an active field of research. Specifically, different GNSS-based algorithms were developed in order to precisely detect displacements [30], while the adaptive sliding window method was proposed to provide reliable and operational landslide information [31]. Furthermore, low-cost GNSS receivers have been manufactured to evaluate surface deformation in real-time [32,33]. The rise of UAVs has revolutionized landslide investigation due to their survey flexibility, cost efficiency, and high spatial resolution [34,35]. In this framework, numerous studies have been conducted to monitor landslide behavior. [36\u201341]. The more simplified approaches used Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) extracted by UAV surveys to map and quantify surface changes over landslide areas [42,43] or to monitor waste piles in coal mines [44]. Another successful way to identify topographic modification or any potential displacement relies on the comparison of multitemporal UAV point clouds [45]. Some researchers focused on the assessment of the evolution and dynamics of landslides through the post-processing of UAV products (orthophotos, DEMs, point clouds) [46,47], while others tried to create guidelines for the proper performance of UAV flights for landslide investigations [48\u201350]. UAV data along with a non-parametric random forest model have also been utilized in order to create landslide susceptibility maps [51]. At the same time, different approaches have been developed for the extraction of 3D displacements via UAV photogrammetry [52,53]. The more sophisticated methodologies deal with the creation of semi-automated or automated models for the rapid recognition of landslides or landslide cracks [54,55]. More multidiscipline studies suggest the combined use of various remote sensing data to monitor ground deformation. In particular, InSAR time series measurements in conjunction with UAV imagery were utilized to analyze the long-term behavior of landslides and improve the understanding of landslide kinematics [56,57]. Moreover, UAVs and GNSS surveys were performed for the validation of SAR methodologies in other case studies [58,59]. Finally, more complex approaches consisted of topo-geodetic and UAV surveys along with ground-penetrating radar and geotechnical data [60]. The current research focuses on the systematic and long-term analysis of instability phenomena in a mountainous area of Western Greece. To precisely monitor the recent evolution of the landslide, we performed repetitive UAV campaigns in conjunction with corresponding GNSS surveys. The identification of surface deformation was based on a change detection approach between the generated point clouds. The results were validated through GNSS measurements and field observation. Added to this, we collected archived PSI measurements derived from the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) to extend the observation period and gain a more complete understanding of the phenomenon. With regard to this, the novelty of the current research relies on the exploitation of archived PSI measurements as potential future landslide indicators. In addition to the aforementioned points, the synergistic use of various remote sensing data provides the necessary information to study instability at different scales. Specifically, PSI measure-\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2870 3 of 18\nments are ideal for monitoring large areas, while UAV and GNSS surveys are suitable for monitoring smaller areas."

Ten square 4.5\u2033 black and white targets were allocated sparsely in the field during the UAV surveys. These targets were measured with a real-time kinematic GNSS receiver and used in order to geoereference UAV images and enhance the registration quality between the multi-dated orthophotos. All the collected images were processed using the same parameters in Agisoft Metashape software (v. 2.0.1., Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia). In order to achieve the best 3D reconstruction, we used the highest-quality option for the alignment of the UAV photos. As described in previous studies [49,50] using the specific option, the camera positions are calculated more accurately. The ultrahigh-quality option was also used for dense point cloud generation in order to achieve more detailed and precise depth maps. Regarding other processing steps, such as camera calibration and optimization, the suggested default options were chosen [49,50]. Using the ground control points collected in the field, all the derived products, i.e., orthophotos, and 3D point clouds, were projected to the Hellenic Geodetic Reference System of 1987. The total processing time for the UAV data is estimated at twelve hours. During the flight campaigns, repetitive static GNSS measurements were performed at three permanent pillars inside the landslide body (Figures 3 and 4). The guideline for the installation of the permanent GNSS pillar positions and the sequent observations were published in [47]. In more detail, these pillars were constructed by excavating a hole and placing a vertical steel rod, which was 1.5 cm thick and 120 cm long. At the top of each pillar, there is a 5/8\u2033 pole for the performance of GNSS measurements. Performing static observations on permanent pillars located at key points within the landslide body guarantees the accuracy of the measurements. GNSS measurements were processed using simple mathematical equations in order to calculate the possible deformation from the initial three-axis measurements.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nDays\nDecember 2021\nRain (mm)\nWind (km/hr)\nFigure 9.

            "text": "The precise mapping and monitoring of the landslide at Ano Kerassovo started a few days after the occurrence of the first slide on 28 January 2021 and continued until today. The last fieldwork took place on 11 April 2023. The surveys were executed at the beginning and the end of the rainy period, as well as on specific dates based on information about the evolution of the area from local residents. Our fieldwork includes the collection of UAV data, as well as high-precision GNSS measurements with 1\u20132 mm precision (Table 2) in permanent pillars. UAV flights are operated within 1 h using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro. This tetracopter is easily transferred into the landslide body and can be deployed in a limited space. It is equipped with a 20 MP camera and operates with a mechanical shutter, capturing images of 5472 \u00d7 3078 pixels.

GNSS measurements were processed using simple mathematical equations in order to calculate the possible deformation from the initial three-axis measurements. To examine if the archived PSI measurements can be used as future landslide indicators, we obtained data from the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) [66]. The service provides systematic and accurate (millimeter-scale) ground deformation measurements over the Copernicus-participating countries. Applications such as infrastructure monitoring or geohazard analysis are viable through the service. EGMS measurements are based on the processing of Sentinel-1 imagery using PSI. Buildings, man-made structures, and areas without vegetation are used as permanent scatterers among the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 datasets. The calibration of PSI measurements is performed through data acquired by GNSS. The service distributes three types of products, namely Basic, Calibrated, and Ortho. The Basic level includes ascending and descending line-of-sight velocity maps with annotated geolocalization and quality measures for each point. Calibrated data consist of ascending and descending line-of-sight velocity maps, which are referenced to a model created by GNSS data. Finally, Ortho products provide motion components (horizontal and vertical), which are anchored to a reference geodetic model. In the current research, we utilized Ortho products in the village of Ano Kerassovo.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2870 10 of 18"

The collected data were processed appropriately, and three-dimensional models of the area of interest were generated. Afterward, the generated 3D models were aligned using the iterative closest points (ICPs) algorithm. Figure 10a illustrates the point cloud that emerged from the UAV flight executed on 25 September 2022. The specific point cloud was used as a reference to identify topographic alterations over time. A cloud-to-cloud change detection (C2C) methodology was applied between the reference and the multi-dated point clouds into CloudCompare software. C2C estimates the distance to the closest in the compared cloud for every point. The results of the aforementioned approach are displayed in Figure 10b\u2013d. Specifically, Figure 10b presents the topographic changes between the point clouds, obtained on 25 September 2022 and 20 December 2022. These variations are highlighted in green, and they are related mainly to vegetation changes. Surface deformation occurred between the point clouds, acquired on 25 September 2022 and 25 January 2023, and is depicted with greenish to yellowish shades in Figure 10c. Deformation of the specific period is particularly obvious and intense, with surface changes ranging from 0.7 to 1.8 m. It is evident that rainfall events strongly affected the entire region. The most recent UAV campaign, performed on 11 April 2023, revealed that the landslide is still active, but the prevailing force is the at-depth erosion, which shapes the study area relief. This is clearly noticeable in Figure 10d, in which more areas have been altered."

The first landslide event was manifested after a daily rainfall height of 93.6 mm, while a total rainfall of 256.8 mm within a week triggered the second reactivation.

The first landslide event was manifested after a daily rainfall height of 93.6 mm, while a total rainfall of 256.8 mm within a week triggered the second reactivation. Since then, the landslide is still active, presenting slower deformation rates, as rainfall height was lower during 2022 than in previous years. There are many studies published in the last years pointing out the usefulness of InSAR techniques, UAV photogrammetry, and GNSS technology for landslide monitoring. However, there are very few combining all the previously mentioned techniques. Our methodology and results are in accordance with some previously published studies. Eker and Aydin 2021 also used archived PSI data, aerial photos, and UAV images in order to monitor an active landslide long-term [57]. They also used a 3D point cloud comparison in order to measure the volume deformation. In another similar study by Razi [59], PSI analysis was performed on ALOS PALSAR data, and the results were compared to UAV data and GNSS measurements. Other researchers combined GNSS measurements, UAV data, ground-penetrating radar data, and geotechnical techniques in order to monitor a landslide in Romania. Using interdisciplinary monitoring, it was proven that the slope was undergoing surface erosion, and soil displacements were detected [60]. A combination of PSI data and UAV photogrammetry was also presented by [56]. In particular, they used PSI data derived from 25 ENVISAT SAR images and UAV photogrammetry to monitor displacements in a resort in Granada, Spain. Themistocleous et al. presented an integrated ground deformation monitoring study by combining INSAR data, UAV imagery, and GNSS measurements [58]. The study area was a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Cyprus named Choirokoitia. A noticeable novelty in the current study is the effort to predict the future evolution of the specific landslide based on archived PSI data and the UAV and GNSS measurements. Figure 15 presents an overview of the broader area. The landslide extents at different dates and the position of the PSI are displayed together.

This subsidence could be a warning signal for the landslide occurrence. Inside Ano Kerassovo village, there are two PSI measurements depicting subsidence estimated at 2 mm/y. These points should be regularly monitored for future landslide events. In addition to GNSS measurements and crack mapping from the UAV orthophotos, we assume that the landslide will progress to the northeast in the near future.
