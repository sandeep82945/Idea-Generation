    "abstractText": "Buckled monolayer nitrogene has been recently predicted to be stable above the room temperature. The low atomic number of nitrogen atom suggests, that spin\u2013orbit coupling in nitrogene is weak, similar to graphene or silicene. We employ first principles calculations and perform a systematic study of the intrinsic and extrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling in this material. We calculate the spin mixing parameter b2 , reflecting the strength of the intrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling and find, that b2 is relatively small, on the order of 10\u22126 . It also displays a weak anisotropy, opposite for electrons and holes. To study extrinsic effects of spin\u2013orbit coupling we apply a transverse electric field enabling spin\u2013orbit fields . We find, that are on the order of a single \u03bc eV in the valence band, and tens to a hundred of",

            "text": "monolayer nitrogene Paulina Jureczko & Marcin Kurpas*\nBuckled monolayer nitrogene has been recently predicted to be stable above the room temperature. The low atomic number of nitrogen atom suggests, that spin\u2013orbit coupling in nitrogene is weak, similar to graphene or silicene. We employ first principles calculations and perform a systematic study of the intrinsic and extrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling in this material. We calculate the spin mixing parameter b2 , reflecting the strength of the intrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling and find, that b2 is relatively small, on the order of 10\u22126 . It also displays a weak anisotropy, opposite for electrons and holes. To study extrinsic effects of spin\u2013orbit coupling we apply a transverse electric field enabling spin\u2013orbit fields . We find, that are on the order of a single \u00b5 eV in the valence band, and tens to a hundred of \u00b5 eV in the conduction band, depending on the applied electric field. Similar to b2 , is also anisotropic, in particular for the conduction electrons.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) pnictogens have gained a lot of attention in recent years1\u201310. Among these materials atomically thin black phosphorus emerged as the most promising one for electronic and spintronic applications due to its intrinsic semiconducting band gap, extraordinary high carrier mobility and strongly anisotropic orbital and spin properties1,2,11,12. Recently, 2D atomically thin nitrogen, called also nitrogene13, has been predicted to be structurally stable even far above the room temperature10,13,14. According to these predictions, 2D nitrogene can crystallize in a few different forms, each having distinct electronic properties. Puckered (black phosphorus like) nitrogene is a direct gap semiconductor with the gap 1.25\u00a0 eV15. Octagon nitrogene is an indirect wide-gap semiconductor with the gap 2.6\u00a0 eV16,17, while buckled honeycomb nitrogene is an indirect gap insulator with the calculated band gap of about 4\u20136\u00a0 eV13. The wide band gap of buckled nitrogene may be an obstacle to use this material in semiconductor electronics. However, several ways of lowering the gap to the semiconducting limit have been proposed, including formation of multilayers14, doping by boron18 or making nitrogene nanoribbons13.\nSo far the experimental realization of 2D nitrogene remains a challenge. The main obstacle here is a tendency of N atoms to form N2 molecules with a triple N \u2261 N bond19. Therefore, the goal is to find conditions under which this tendency is minimized, allowing for the formation of single bonds between N atoms. Such conditions can be created, for instance, by high pressure and temperature. Very recently this strategy has led to the synthesis of bulk nitrogen in black phosphorus structure19,20. More useful method, in terms of practical applications of nitrogene, was used by Harada et\u00a0al., who epitaxially grown a single atom thick N layer in GaAs21. Although the structure of the epitaxial layer did not correspond to any of the theoretically envisaged, this is a big step towards the realization of 2D nitrogene.\nNitrogen is a light element with the atomic number Z=14. Therefore, spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) in nitrogene is expected to be weak22, similar to graphene23 and phosphorene12. Indeed, in a recent theoretical study, Lee et\u00a0al.10 observed no significant effects of SOC on the band structure of buckled nitrognene. This may open great perspectives for this material in spintronics, since weak SOC should result in long lasting spin coherence. Buckled 2D nitrogene crystallizes in the centrosymmetric structure of the P3m\u03041 space group being isomorphic with the D3d point group. The unit cell of nitrogene contains two nonequivalent atoms (Fig.\u00a01b) belonging to two noncoplanar sublattices A and B. The finite out of plane buckling of the structure breaks the mirror symmetry of the lattice and allows the emergence of the intrinsic Rashba24,25 spin\u2013orbit coupling (PIA SOC in the context of functionalized graphene26,27). In contrast to the well known Bychkov\u2013Rashba28 SOC due to structure inversion asymmetry, the intrinsic Rashba SOC preserves the spin degeneracy of states, as a consequence of space inversion symmetry of the lattice and the time reversal symmetry. On the other hand, it affects the electron spin and leads to the emergence of in-plane spin components, forbidden by symmetry in flat, mirror symmetric graphene.\nBesides the above general considerations, not much is known about SOC in this material. For instance, the question about the competition of the intrinsic Rashba SOC, polarizing the spins in-plane, and the intrinsic SOC polarizing spins along the z directions has not been addressed. Since such a competition may lead to the anisotropy of the SOC, we take up this problem here and perform a systematic study of SOC in buckled monolayer nitrogene. By employing first principles calculations we characterize the intrinsic SOC by the spin mixing\nOPEN\nInstitute of Physics, University of Silesia in Katowice, 41-500 Chorz\u00f3w, Poland. *email: marcin.kurpas@us.edu.pl\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:3201 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07215-2\nparameter b229, while the extrinsic SOC, arising due to breaking of the space inversion symmetry, is quantified by the amplitude of spin splittings so and spin\u2013orbit fields . All these quantities provide essential information about the strength and anisotropy of SOC in the band structure.\nWe find, that b2 is of the order of 10\u22126 , both for electrons and holes, and displays a weak in-plane to out-of plane anisotropy. The extrinsic SOC shows significant diversity between the valence and conduction bands. In the former, the values of spin\u2013orbit fields vary between a few to a dozen of \u00b5 eV for the considered amplitudes of an external electric field, and are rather isotropic. In the latter, the values of are roughy ten times bigger and are strongly anisotropic."

The size of the indirect gap for the PBE exchange correlation functional is Eg = 4.06,\u00a0eV, and is in agreement with the values reported by others13. The top-most valence band has two local maxima lying between the \u0174 K and \u0174 M paths in the First Brillouin Zone (FBZ) (Fig.\u00a01c). The maxima are located approximately 0.5\u00a0eV above the saddle point at the \u0174 point, and differ in energy by 35\u00a0meV. The edge of the conduction band is located in the middle of the \u0174 M path in the FBZ.\nAs already stated by Lee et\u00a0al.10, the effects of spin\u2013orbit coupling on the band structure on buckled nitrogene are weak. Indeed, the inclusion of relativistic effects in the calculation makes no significant effects on the non-relativistic band structure. The most prominent ones are spin\u2013orbital gaps opened at high symmetry points of the FBZ. In the valence band, the spin\u2013orbital gap at the \u0174 point (between the bands marked 2 and 3) is \ufffd\u0174SO = 17.3\u00a0meV, while at the K point (between the bands marked 1 and 2\u2019) it is K SO = 2.1\u00a0meV. For comparison, the same splittings for graphene are \ufffd\u0174SO = 9\u00a0meV and K SO = 24\u00a0\u00b5eV23, and for blue phosphorene \ufffd\u0174SO = 48\u00a0meV, K SO = 10\u00a0\u00b5eV22.\nTo characterize the intrinsic SOC in the band structure away from the high symmetry points we calculate the spin mixing parameter b2 . This parameter measures the amplitude of the spin component being admixed to the Bloch state of opposite spin by the SOC. Importantly, the parameter b2 can be easily accessed experimentally from the Elliott relation connecting b2 with the spin \u03c4s and momentum \u03c4p relaxation times: b2 = \u03c4p(4\u03c4s)\u22121 , provided the Elliott-Yafet mechanism dominates spin relaxation29,30. This is usually the case, when the spin lifetime follows the same characteristics as the momentum lifetime31\u201334. Knowing \u03c4p and \u03c4s from the experiment, one can extract the sample independent parameter b2 , and compare it with the theoretical values. Recently we have successfully applied this strategy to characterize b2 and spin relaxation in black phosphorus12,34. In numerical simulations the parameter b2 can be calculated directly from the wave functions, provided the spin subbands of a Bloch state \u03c8k,n are degenerate. This requirement is met if the time reversal symmetry and space inversion symmetry of the sample are present simultaneously. In such a case the two Bloch subbands are\n(1)\u03c8\u21d1 k,n(r) =[ak,n(r)| \u2191 \ufffd + bk,n(r)| \u2193 \ufffd]e ik\u00b7r ,\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nK M K\nE - E F [e V ]\nK M\n1\n2' 2\n3\n0.5eV\na b\nc\nFigure\u00a01.

Here, bk,n is the amplitude of spin component |\u03c3 \u2032 \ufffd being admixed by the SOC to the Bloch state of spin |\u03c3 \ufffd , \u03c3 = {\u2191,\u2193} . Since the Bloch states \u03c8\u21d1\nk,n(r) and \u03c8 \u21d3\nk,n(r) are degenerate at any k-point, any linear combination of these states is also an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. This allows us to chose the amplitudes ak,n and bk,n in such a way, that \u03c8 \u21d1 k,n(r) , \u03c8 \u21d3\nk,n(r) diagonalize spin one-half operator s\u0302i , i = x, y, z . By doing so we can choose the spin quantization axis (SQA), SQA=i, which in experiment corresponds to the direction of magnetization of injected spins.\nThe spin mixing parameter can be calculated by integrating the amplitude |bk,n,| over the whole unit cell\nor, alternatively by calculating the deviation of the expectation value of the spin operator s\u0302i from its nominal value 1/2 (in units of )36\nwhere \u03c3 = {\u21d1,\u21d3}\u00a0and\u00a0\u03c8\u03c3 ,i k,n(r) is the eigenstate of s\u0302i . For normalized states 0 \u2264 b 2 k,n,i \u2264 0.5 , where b 2 k,n,i = 0.5 corresponds to fully spin mixed states and b2 k,n,i = 0 to pure spin up (down) spinors.\nThe calculated Fermi contour averaged spin mixing parameter b2 plotted versus the position of the Fermi level is shown in Fig.\u00a02. The value of b2 is in the range of 10\u22126 for both, the valence and the conduction band. This is roughly ten times the value of b2 for graphene and ten times less than for black and blue phosphorus22,34,37. At EF \u2248 32\u00a0meV the second valence band maximum (along the \u0174M path in Fig.\u00a01) crosses the Fermi level and k-points from this wedge of the FBZ start contributing to b2 , slightly modifying its slope. The parameter b2 is almost doping independent. Such behavior is typical for bands being energetically separated from other lower and higher lying bands22.\nThe parameter b2 shows weak anisotropy with respect to the spin quantization axis. In the valence band (Fig.\u00a02a) b2 for SQA=z (out of plane polarization) is roughly twice as large as for SQA=x,\u00a0y, b2SQA=x/y/b 2 SQA=z \u2248 0.54 . This result is surprising, since most of buckled elemental monolayer materials display the opposite trend22. In this context nitrogene is similar to graphene, which exhibits similar anisotropy of b2 for holes away from the Dirac point. For conduction electrons (Fig.\u00a02b) we observe the opposite trend in b2 , namely, b2SQA=x/y/b 2 SQA=z \u2248 1.6 . Although the anisotropy of b2 is not very high, this result deviates from other buckled pnictogens, for which b2 is mostly isotropic.\nThe results presented Fig.\u00a02 have been obtained for the PBE exchange\u2013correlation functional. Since for hybrid functionals the band gap increases by 2\u00a0 eV13, we have checked how the band gap correction influences the values of the spin mixing parameter and performed calculations for the HSE38 functional. Although the band gap increased to 6.34\u00a0eV (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1) the corresponding spin mixing parameter (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2) stays almost unaffected and varies by at most a few percent. Therefore, the results obtained for the PBE functional can be taken as conclusive.\nExtrinsic spin\u2013orbit coupling. Monolayer nitrogene has been predicted to be structurally stable on metal surfaces. Even though the interaction with the substrate is weak and makes no significant changes to the band structure of nitrogene13, the crystal potential at the interface breaks the inversion symmetry of the nitrogene lattice and enables the extrinsic Bychkov\u2013Rashba spin\u2013orbit coupling28. The extrinsic SOC has two main effects on the electron spin. First, it removes the degeneracy of spin states, and second, it induces crystal momentum\n(2)\u03c8\u21d3 k,n(r) =[a \u2217 \u2212k,n(r)| \u2193 \ufffd \u2212 b \u2217 \u2212k,n(r)| \u2191 \ufffd]e ik\u00b7r ,\n(3)b2k,n = \u222b |bk,n(r)| 2d3r,\n(4)b2k,n,i = 1\n2 \u2212 |\ufffd\u03c8\n\u03c3 ,i k,n(r)|s\u0302i|\u03c8 \u03c3 ,i k,n(r)\ufffd|,\n1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nb2 [1 0\u2212\n6 ]\nEF [meV]\nSQA=x SQA=y SQA=z 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6\n\u2212100 \u221280 \u221260 \u221240 \u221220 0\nb2 [1 0\u2212\n6 ]\nEF [meV]\nSQA=x SQA=y SQA=z\na b\nFigure\u00a02.

The SO field k is linked to spin splitting by the Zeeman-like Rashba Hamiltonian\nwhere is the Planck constant, and \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices. Instead of placing nitrogene on a particular substrate we model its presence by applying an external transverse\nelectric field E = (0, 0,E) , whose amplitude can be precisely controlled in numerical calculations. This approach, allowing us to simulate different substrates, is justified due to weak hybridization of states of nitrogene and the substrate13.\nIn Fig.\u00a03 we show the Fermi contour averaged spin splitting so calculated for several values of the electric field. In contrast to the spin mixing parameter b2 , so differs significantly between the valence and conduction band. In the former (Fig.\u00a03a), so takes the values from a few to a dozen of \u00b5 eV for the considered values of electric fields and grows by approximately 3\u00a0\u00b5 eV per 1Vnm\u22121 . In the conduction band (Fig.\u00a03b) the corresponding values are almost ten times bigger than in the valence band, and vary between 20\u00a0\u00b5 eV to 100\u00a0\u00b5eV, for E = 1\u00a0Vnm\u22121 and E = 4\u00a0Vnm\u22121 respectively, with a linear growth of 33\u00a0\u00b5 eV per 1\u00a0Vnm\u22121 . Similarly to b2 , the slope of so in the valence band changes slightly when the Fermi level EF \u2248 32\u00a0meV and the second valence band maximum (between the \u0174 and M points in Fig.\u00a01) enters the Fermi contour.\nThe spin splitting so characterizes the strength of the extrinsic SOC in a band. The anisotropy of SOC can be accessed through the components of the spin\u2013orbit field k , k,i ,\nwhere Si , i = {x, y, z} is the expectation value of spin one-half operator at a given k point, and Sk = \u221a S2k,x + S 2 k,y + S 2 k,z\n39. The calculated Fermi surface averaged components i are presented in Fig.\u00a04. In the valence band (Fig.\u00a04a,b), x and y take similar values, while z (Fig.\u00a04c) is almost twice smaller and displays different monotonicity. In the conduction band, the in-plane spin components x , y (Fig.\u00a04d,e) are large, tens of \u00b5eV, and are doping independent, while z (Fig.\u00a04f) takes the values of a few \u00b5eV, and is doping dependent. Such big differences between \ufffdx/y and z lead to a sizeable, up to \ufffdx/y/\ufffdz \u2248 40 , doping-dependent anisotropy.\nTo understand these results one needs to look at the components of the electron spin which shape i . We show them in Fig.\u00a05a,b. The in-plane spin components Sx and Sy form the typical circulating Rashba spin texture (Fig.\u00a05a). Within the considered doping range the length of Sx and Sy is approximately constant, as shown in Fig.\u00a05c. The Sz component displays much bigger diversity, and takes small values in the center of FBZ, while for bigger crystal momenta we observe the spin-valley locking effect with a strong spin polarization. In effect, when doping increases the average value of |Sz | in the valence band first decreases from the value |Sz | \u2248 0.1 to |Sz | \u2248 0.03 , and for EF \u2264 \u221232\u00a0meV its starts increasing and saturates at the value |Sz | \u2248 0.075 (Fig.\u00a05c). The qualitative change to Sz takes place when the Fermi contour reaches the k-points close to the anticrossings marked by the green rectangle in Fig.\u00a01a, what happens exactly at EF \u2248 \u221232\u00a0meV. For k in the range from the \u0174 point to the anticrossing at E \u2212 EF \u2248 \u221210\u00a0eV, Sz \u2248 0 (see the Supplementary Fig. S3). Increasing k towards the K-point, Sz starts growing and reaches the maximum Sz \u2248 0.5 at k above the anticrossing lying at E \u2212 EF \u2248 \u22129\u00a0eV. Since the valence band maximum lies in between of the two anticrossings, we first observe a decrease of |Sz | followed by its increase.\nIn the conduction band (Fig.\u00a05b,d), the in-plane spins also form the Rashba texture, similar to the valence band, but the z component of spin is very small in the wedge of the BZ corresponding to doping range\n(5)HR(k) =\n2 \ufffdk \u00b7 \u03c3 ,\n(6)\ufffdk,i = \ufffdso(k) Sk,i\nSk ,\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\u2212100 \u221275 \u221250 \u221225 0 EF [meV]\na b\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0 25 50 75 100 EF [meV]\nso [ eV\n]\nso [ eV\n]\nFigure\u00a03.

In effect, x and y take the values close to so , while z is of the order of a few \u00b5 eV (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f), generating a large anisotropy of the extrinsic SOC.\nAs can be seen from the results shown above, SOC in nitrogene is weak. The calculated spin mixing parameter, b2 \u2248 10\u22126 , is approximately ten times bigger than for graphene22. This suggests, that the intrinsic SOC should not contribute much to spin scattering in nitrogene. Taking the typical momentum lifetime \u03c4p = 100\u00a0fs, we can make a rough estimate of spin lifetime from the Elliott-Yafet mechanism29,31,\u03c4EYs \u2248 \u03c4p/4b2 \u2248 50\u00a0ns. On the other hand, several factors may affect SOC and spin dynamics in a material. For instance in graphene, the out-of-plane lattice distortions strongly affect both, the strength of the SOC and momentum scattering, dramatically reducing spin lifetime40\u201343. A transition from the flat to rippled graphene results in the emergence of an additional (intrinsic) SO term Hcurv42,44. For typical ripples of radii in the range R \u223c 50\u00a0nm-100\u00a0nm the characteristic energy of this interaction is curv \u2248 0.2\u00a0K, and can exceed the energy of the intrinsic SOC, int \u2248 0.01K\u2212 0.1\u00a0 K23,42, making the relevant spin-flip processes important. Additionally, rippling breaks the mirror symmetry ( z \u2192 \u2212z ) protecting the electron spin, and enables additional spin relaxation channels by flexural phonons and random spin\u2013orbit fields41,43.\nIn contrast to graphene, nitrogene is naturally buckled. Thus, the effects of buckling are embedded in the intrinsic SOC and b2 , and are much stronger than effects of rippling discussed above. It was shown, that int at the K-point in graphene grows quadratically with the buckling height \u03b4 , \ufffdint \u223c (\u03b4/a)2 , a being the lattice constant, and for \u03b4/a \u2248 0.08 it jumps to int \u2248 1\u00a0 K23. In the case of nitrogene, the buckling height is \u03b4 \u2248 0.9 \u00c5, a = 2.3\u00a0\u00c5, which gives \u03b4/a \u2248 0.4 . Following the quadratic dependence for graphene, one gets for nitrogene int = 25\u00a0K, close to the value Kso = 23\u00a0K extracted from our first principles calculations. For comparison, static ripples of radii R \u223c 50\u00a0nm-100\u00a0nm, give the correction to the intrinsic SOC of the order of \ufffdcurv \u223c a/R \u2248 0.2\u00a0 K42,\u2014negligible in the case of nitrogene.\nAlthough lattice ripples should not significantly affect the intrinsic SOC in nitrogene, they can generate a small random spin\u2013orbit fields leading to faster spin decoherence, in a similar way as it takes place graphene41. Fortunately, lattice rippling can be to a large extent eliminated by encapsulation of the host layer by, e.g., hexagonal boron nitride45,46.\nspin\u2013orbit coupling plays an important role in contemporary solid state physics, spintronics and topological quantum computing. Apart from these areas of physics, it has also been intensively studied in cold atoms systems. Therefore, in the next few lines we briefly compare SOC in crystalline solids with SOC in Bose gases.\nIn crystalline solids, SOC originates from the crystal potential, in which an electron is moving. In the rest frame of the electron, the electric field induced by the crystal potential acts as an effective, momentum dependent Zeeman field acting on the electron spin. The strength of SOC in a band is determined by the chemical\nFigure\u00a04.

The Fermi energy is measured with respect to the valence (conduction) band maximum (minimum).\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:3201 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07215-2\ncomposition of the crystal (materials made of heavier elements display stronger SOC effects than those made of light elements) and the topology of the band structure, and to some extent may be modified externally, e.g., by electric fields47, strain48, proximity effects49 or twisting50. The form of the spin\u2013orbit interaction is dictated by the symmetry of the crystal; for instance, the famous Bychkov\u2013Rashba28 and Dresselhaus51 types of SOC result from broken structure and bulk inversion symmetry, respectively.\nIn cold bosons systems, SOC is realized by coupling the motion of an atom to its internal (hyperfine) pesudospin states, corresponding to the electron\u2019s spin up and spin down states52\u201356. Implementation of such coupling, called synthetic SOC54, requires an extra effort of dressing atomic states with lasers, but offers a full control of this interaction at will57. By a proper combination of laser fields and atomic pseudo-spin states, a variety of SOCs can be created and dynamically modified54,57,58. For example, Lin et\u00a0al.54, realized one dimensional SOC, corresponding to equal contributions of Bychkov\u2013Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC in conventional systems; Wu et\u00a0al.57 implemented a scheme allowing for a controllable transition from 1D to 2D SOC. More exotic forms of SOC having no counterparts in real materials, such as, a 3D analogue of Rashba SOC59,60, are also possible, making cold atoms systems a powerful platform for exploring spin\u2013orbit coupling and many body physics. Like in conventional materials, in bose gases, SOC is essential to the emergence of fascinating physical phenomena, e.g., a degenerate ground state of spin\u2013orbit coupled Bose\u2013Einstein condensates61, spatial separation of BEC54,62,63, quantum phase transitions64, or the existence of topologically non-trivial phases57,60. These few examples are a small sample of SOC-induced phenomena in cold atoms systems.
