    "abstractText": "Background The marine thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus marinus can degrade many polysaccharides which makes it interesting as a future cell factory. Progress using this bacterium has, however, been hampered by limited knowledge on media and conditions for biomass production, often resulting in low cell yields and low productivity, highlighting the need to develop conditions that allow studies of the microbe on molecular level. This study presents development of defined conditions that support growth, combined with evaluation of production of carotenoids and exopolysaccharides (EPSs) by R. marinus strain DSM 16675. Results Two defined media were initially prepared: one including a low addition of yeast extract (modified Wolfe\u2019s medium) and one based on specific components (defined medium base, DMB) to which two amino acids (N and Q), were added. Cultivation trials of R. marinus DSM 16675 in shake flasks, resulted in maximum cell densities (OD620 nm) of 2.36 \u00b1 0.057, cell dry weight (CDW) 1.2 \u00b1 0.14 mg/L, total carotenoids 0.59 \u00d7 10 mg/L, and EPSs 1.72 \u00b1 0.03 mg/L using 2 g/L glucose in DMB. In Wolfe\u2019s medium (supplemented by 0.05 g/L yeast extract and 2.5 g/L glucose), maximum OD620 nm was 2.07 \u00b1 0.05, CDW 1.05 \u00b1 0.07 mg/L, total carotenoids 0.39 \u00d7 10 mg/L, and EPSs 1.74 \u00b1 0.2 mg/L. Growth trials at 5 g/L glucose in these media either failed or resulted in incomplete substrate utilization. To improve reproducibility and increase substrate utilization, a screening of macroelements (e.g. phosphate) in DMB, was combined with use of trace elements and vitamins of the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium. The resulting defined minimal R. marinus medium, (DRM), allowed reproducible cultivations to a final OD620nm of 6.6 \u00b1 0.05, CDW 2.85 \u00b1 0.07 mg/L, a maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) of 0.26 h \u22121, total carotenoids 0.77 \u00d7 10 mg/L and EPSs 3.4 \u00b1 0.17 mg/L in cultivations supplemented with up to 5 g/L glucose. Conclusion A minimal defined medium (DRM) was designed that resulted in reproducible growth and an almost doubled formation of both total carotenoids and EPSs. Such defined conditions, are necessary for systematic studies of metabolic pathways, to determine the specific requirements for growth and fully characterize metabolite",

Cultivation trials of R. marinus DSM 16675 in shake flasks, resulted in maximum cell densities (OD620 nm) of 2.36 \u00b1 0.057, cell dry weight (CDW) 1.2 \u00b1 0.14 mg/L, total carotenoids 0.59 \u00d7 10\u20133 mg/L, and EPSs 1.72 \u00b1 0.03 mg/L using 2 g/L glucose in DMB. In Wolfe\u2019s medium (supplemented by 0.05 g/L yeast extract and 2.5 g/L glucose), maximum OD620 nm was 2.07 \u00b1 0.05, CDW 1.05 \u00b1 0.07 mg/L, total carotenoids 0.39 \u00d7 10\u20133 mg/L, and EPSs 1.74 \u00b1 0.2 mg/L. Growth trials at 5 g/L glucose in these media either failed or resulted in incomplete substrate utilization. To improve reproducibility and increase substrate utilization, a screening of macroelements (e.g. phosphate) in DMB, was combined with use of trace elements and vitamins of the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium. The resulting defined minimal R. marinus medium, (DRM), allowed reproducible cultivations to a final OD620nm of 6.6 \u00b1 0.05, CDW 2.85 \u00b1 0.07 mg/L, a maximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) of 0.26 h\n\u22121, total carotenoids 0.77 \u00d7 10\u20133 mg/L and EPSs 3.4 \u00b1 0.17 mg/L in cultivations supplemented with up to 5 g/L glucose.\nConclusion A minimal defined medium (DRM) was designed that resulted in reproducible growth and an almost doubled formation of both total carotenoids and EPSs. Such defined conditions, are necessary for systematic studies of metabolic pathways, to determine the specific requirements for growth and fully characterize metabolite production.\nKeywords Thermophile, Rhodothermus marinus DSM 16675, Exopolysaccharides, Carotenoids, Defined medium, Medium development\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022, corrected publication 2023.

            "text": "Extremophiles, including thermophiles, have been offered as sources of stable and active enzymes at elevated temperature. Despite the interest in extremophiles for this purpose, only a limited number of model organisms for growth and metabolite production, have been reported [1]. The chemoorganotrophic aerobe Rhodothermus marinus has been attracting interest due to its thermostable enzymes and its ability to produce carotenoids and exopolysaccharides (EPSs) [2, 3], and the genome sequence of strain DSM 4252T is available [4]. The type strain of R. marinus was first isolated from a submarine (2\u20133\u00a0m depth) hot spring in Isafjardardjup, NW Iceland [5]. Cultivation parameters of strain DSM 4252T have however been difficult to follow due to aggregation of the cells, and genetic tools have not been developed for this strain due to the presence of restriction enzymes [6]. Another native strain, R. marinus DSM 16675 (also known as R. marinus PRI 493, MAT 493 and ISCAR-493), also isolated from an Icelandic biotope, has more frequently been used for research due to its lower degree of cell aggregation and its deficiency in restriction enzymes, which allowed introduction of genetic materials and subsequent strain development [3, 7].\nR. marinus DSM 16675 is able to grow in several complex media such as Lysogeny broth (LB), marine broth, and the ATCC medium 1598 or 1599 [8]. These media have been used for pre-cultures of R. marinus and to produce carotenoids and EPSs, which are two major metabolites of this microorganism. However, in order to study the metabolic pathways and to determine the specific requirements for growth and metabolites production of R. marinus DSM 16675, a chemically defined medium is needed [9]. The aim of this study was to optimize a defined minimal medium for R. marinus DSM 16675 in order to allow studies of the growth kinetics, achieve higher cell density, and monitor metabolites formation using a sole carbon source."

            "text": "Inoculum preparation of\u00a0R. marinus DSM 16675 using glucose as\u00a0the\u00a0sole carbon source After reviving the \u2212 80\u00a0 \u00b0C glycerol stocks of strain DSM16675 on ATCC 1599-agar plates, a two-step inoculum preparation procedure in liquid medium was used, in which the inocula were produced in baffled shake flasks using 2\u00a0 g/L glucose. The cells were transferred from the agar plates to the desired liquid medium, grown to the exponential growth phase and then transferred to a fresh medium, in order to increase the inoculum size and obtain high levels of viable cells in a short time. Inoculum preparation is often an overlooked step, that can have an impact on the outcome of the cultivation process e.g. in\nterms of productivity [10]. In this work, transfer in the early exponential phase was important for cell viability (data not shown), and the repeated liquid culture inoculation procedure was important to allow use of an inoculum from a liquid medium of identical composition as the medium used in the cultivation.\nGrowth of\u00a0R. marinus DSM 16675 in\u00a0two defined media: defined medium base (DMB), and\u00a0modified Wolfe\u2019s medium A modification of the ATCC medium 1599 (replacing the Tryptone and Yeast extract with the amino acids N and Q) [11], here termed: defined medium base (DMB), and a modified Wolfe\u2019s medium with low amounts of yeast extract [12] (Table\u00a0 1) have, with some variations, been used to cultivate R. marinus DSM 4252T in the past.\nThe cell densities obtained using these media have however been low, and cell proliferation has not always been obtained, indicating some type of deficiency. Moreover, the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium, contained small amounts of yeast extract, which is a drawback when a defined medium is needed. These two available types of media nevertheless provided a starting point for screening. To obtain cultivation data, DMB and modified Wolfe\u2019s medium were used in shake flask cultivations supplemented with glucose as carbon source at two levels: 2 and 5\u00a0g/L for DMB medium and 2.5 and 5\u00a0g/L glucose for modified Wolfe\u2019s medium, respectively. It should be noted that there is no growth without supplementing a carbon source and glucose was used as the main source of carbon in these cultivations. Without addition of glucose, the amino acids N and Q in low concentrations, or low supplementation of yeast extract in DMB and Wolfe\u2019s medium, respectively, are the only available carbon sources. Consequently, no or very limited growth could be observed (no measurable growth curve) without glucose, as carbon limitation was reached very early.\nCultivation in DMB medium (Table\u00a01) with 2\u00a0g/L glucose resulted in repeatable growth, a maximum cell density (OD620\u00a0 nm) of 2.36 \u00b1 0.057 (1.2 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0 mg/L CDW) after 14\u00a0 h cultivation, a maximum specific growth rate (\u00b5max) of 0.22\u00a0 h\u22121 and complete consumption of glucose (Fig.\u00a01). Despite repeated inoculations, cultivations in DMB medium with 5\u00a0 g/L glucose gave inconsistent results, and it was difficult to start cell proliferation.\nIn parallel, shake flask cultivations of R. marinus DSM 16675 were carried out in modified Wolfe\u2019s medium (Table\u00a01) with and without yeast extract (0.05\u00a0g/L) and at 2.5 or 5\u00a0g/L glucose supplementation (Fig.\u00a02). The results showed a similar specific growth rate when yeast extract supplementation was used (\u03bcmax of 0.24\u00a0 h\u22121, Fig.\u00a0 2A1, A2), while it decreased to a \u03bcmax of 0.17\u00a0 h\u22121 and 0.14\u00a0 h\u22121\nrespectively, in the cultivations without this supplementation (Fig.\u00a02B1, B2).\nThe maximum cell density was not affected significantly by the yeast extract addition, resulting in final OD620\u00a0nm of 2.07 \u00b1 0.05 (1.05 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0 mg/L CDW) after 22\u00a0 h with yeast extract (Fig.\u00a02A1) and 2.35 \u00b1 0.29 (1.2 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0mg/L CDW) after 30\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02B1) without yeast extract. In both cases 2.5\u00a0 g/L glucose supplementation was used. With 5\u00a0 g/L glucose, the cell density obtained was 3.5 \u00b1 0.17 (1.75 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0mg/L CDW) after 24\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02A2) with yeast extract, and 2.88 \u00b1 0.13 (1.35 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0 mg/L CDW) after 36\u00a0 h without yeast extract (Fig.\u00a0 2B2). Overall, the final\ncell mass did not respond to the increased addition of carbon source, showing limitations of other nutrients and also substrate inhibition at high concentration, as the glucose consumption was incomplete after 36\u00a0h."

Highest EPSs production in DMB was in the stationary phase, after 24\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a03). The EPSs production in the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium with yeast extract supplementation (Fig.\u00a0 4) was in the same range as the EPSs monitored for DMB, but highest EPSs production occurred later in the cultivation (after 36\u00a0h). Also, it was shown that a higher glucose concentration (5\u00a0g/L) did generally not boost the production, resulting in lower yield and productivity. Moreover, production was slightly decreased when yeast extract was excluded from the cultivation.\nGrowth of R. marinus DSM 16675 in the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium supplemented with 5\u00a0g/L glucose without yeast extract showed a longer lag phase, and also resulted in a lower final cell density and less consumed glucose (1.77\u00a0 g/L) compared to the medium containing yeast extract (2.82\u00a0 g/L consumed glucose) during 36\u00a0 h of cultivation. It seems, however, that glucose was consumed primarily for production of EPSs, rather than for\ncell growth which can explain the corresponding yield and productivity in the medium supplemented with 5\u00a0g/L glucose without yeast extract.\nOverall, the carotenoid production was higher in the DMB medium compared to the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium. The yield and productivity of EPSs in DMB with 2\u00a0g/L glucose was slightly higher than in the Wolfe\u2019s medium. Due to these facts, the DMB medium was chosen for a screening design, aiming at increasing glucose consumption and growth at higher initial glucose\nconcentration, allowing higher cell density and/or production of the two targeted metabolites.\nThree step medium design combined with\u00a0cultivation experiments"

            "text": "To adapt the DMB medium for growth at higher concentration of the carbon source, a one factor at a time screening strategy [14] was applied, using 5\u00a0 g/L glucose. In the first step, the concentration of four macroelements (CaSO4, MgCl2, PO43\u2212, and NH4Cl) were set at two levels (Table\u00a03). Only one component was set at a higher level at a time while keeping the others at the concentrations in the original DMB medium (Table\u00a01).\nFive experiment sets were designed, including the original DMB medium (Table\u00a01) as a control, which was used in the three step inoculum preparation with the initial glucose concentration of 2\u00a0g/L and in the cultivation experiment (as control) with initial glucose concentration of 5\u00a0g/L. In all cases the glucose concentration in the medium was determined at different time points in each cultivation (Fig.\u00a05A).\nAs seen in (Fig.\u00a0 5A), all four experiments resulted in growth and glucose consumption, which was not the case in the original DMB medium. The consumption of glucose in the medium containing either a high level of NH4Cl or high level of CaSO4, was faster than at the other two conditions (high phosphate or high MgCl2). Assuming a linear approximation in certain intervals, high level NH4Cl resulted in a consumption rate of 0.11\u00a0g/L/h during the first 6\u00a0 h and reached a glucose level of 1.4\u00a0 g/L after 12\u00a0h (with the rate 0.4\u00a0g/L/h in the 6\u00a0h \u2212 12\u00a0h interval) and glucose was completely consumed after 24\u00a0 h. High level of CaSO4 resulted in a 6\u00a0h lag-phase, but after that glucose was consumed at a high rate (approximated to 0.64\u00a0g/L/h), reached 0.63\u00a0g/L after 12\u00a0h and was completely consumed after 24\u00a0h.\nGlucose consumption was slower using a high level of phosphate or MgCl2, but both cultivations had similar\ntrends in the substrate consumption rate, which began after 12\u00a0 h of cultivation and reached 0.26\u00a0 g/L with the rate of 0.3\u00a0g/L/h (high phosphate) and 0.97\u00a0g/L with the rate of 0.27\u00a0 g/L/h (high MgCl2), respectively. The cells did not grow in the control medium (DMB at 5\u00a0 g/L), indicating that a higher level of at least one of the macroelements is needed to allow growth at increased concentration of the carbon source. CaSO4 and NH4Cl had the strongest effects on glucose utilization, but the high levels did in both cases cause precipitation in the medium, complicating measurements of cell density. Hence, phosphate or MgCl2 were considered to be more beneficial components to modify.\nSix parallel experiments were also performed using high levels of two components at a time (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1) and keeping others at the concentration of the original DMB medium in order to screen the effect of two factor combinations on R. marinus DSM 16675 glucose consumption (Fig.\u00a05B).\nThe Fig.\u00a0 5B showed that combination of high level of phosphate solution with high level of CaSO4 and NH4Cl had similar effect on glucose consumption as when using them at high level, separately (Fig.\u00a05A). Also, the combination of high level of MgCl2 with the other variables in high level had negative impact on glucose consumption by R. marinus DSM 16675. These results indicated that the growth of R. marinus DSM 16675 was not improved by combination of two variables at high level compared to using them at high level, separately. The reason might be due to increased precipitation due to the combination of two compounds at high concentration (instead of only one). Based on these results and in order to select components that minimized the risk of precipitation in the medium, DMB with a high level of phosphate (DMB-P) was chosen for further screening.\nEvaluation of\u00a0the\u00a0importance of\u00a0ferric citrate and\u00a0amino acids on\u00a0growth and\u00a0glucose consumption In the second step of the screening, the effect of the presence/absence of ferric citrate (12.24\u00a0 g/L) and the two\namino acids N and Q (1% w/v, respectively) in DMB-P with 5\u00a0g/L glucose was evaluated in four sets of R. marinus DSM 16675 cultivation experiment: (i) with both amino acids and ferric citrate (control) (ii) without the amino acids, (iii) without ferric citrate and (iv) without both amino acids and ferric citrate (Fig.\u00a05C).\nAs seen in (Fig.\u00a0 5C), the four cultivations resulted in very similar growth and glucose consumption curves, but with somewhat faster glucose consumption rate in presence of the amino acids. The maximum rate of glucose consumption of R. marinus DSM 16675 with and without ferric citrate, separately, was 0.43\u00a0 g/L/h and 0.48\u00a0g/L/h, with a final cell density (OD620\u00a0nm) of 5.26 and 5.86, respectively. Without amino acids, the glucose consumption was slightly lower (0.36\u00a0g/L/h, and 0.39\u00a0g/L/h without both amino acids and ferric citrate) while the final cell density varied more (4.75 without amino acids,\nand 5.65 \u00b1 0.21 without both amino acids and ferric citrate). The simplest version (DMB-Pmin), without ferric citrate and the amino acids N and Q, was selected for further design of the minimal medium as the variations were relatively small when included."

            "text": "The developed medium (DMB-Pmin) showed improvement over the original DMB. However, repeated trials using the developed medium (DMB-Pmin), showed that the repeatability was poor. Eleven cultivations were performed with three steps inoculum preparation (1 step on agar plate and 2 steps in liquid medium) and the qualitative repeatability (meaning the % of inoculations that resulted in cell proliferation) of the 1st step of inoculum preparation (in liquid medium) was 73%, the qualitative repeatability of the 2nd inoculation step was 62.5% (of\nthose successfully proliferated in the 1st step), and for the shake flask cultivation step growth was obtained in 40% of the cultures inoculated from the 2nd step. This indicated that there may be a deficiency of elements needed at very low concentrations, e.g. trace elements or vitamins, after repeated cultivations. The trace element and vitamin solutions of the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium contain more compounds than the corresponding DMB medium solutions. Therefore, the trace element and vitamin solutions originally used in the DMB-Pmin medium were replaced with those of the Wolfe\u2019s solutions (Tables\u00a04 and 5).\nAs seen in (Fig.\u00a06), replacement of trace elements and vitamins solutions in the medium (now termed DRM (Defined Rhodothermus Medium) resulted in a small\nincrease in final cell density (OD620nm = 6.6 \u00b1 0.05), while the maximum specific growth rate (\u03bcmax) was 0.26\u00a0 h\u22121, which is in the same range as observed for both DMB (0.22\u00a0 h\u22121) and modified Wolfe\u2019s medium with yeast extract supplementation (0.24\u00a0 h\u22121), and the same as in DMB-Pmin. The glucose consumption profile was also similar in DMB-Pmin and DRM (Fig.\u00a06). Repeated cultivation trials, using DRM were successful, allowing cell proliferation after repeated inoculations in the same medium (data not shown).\nConsumption of glucose by R. marinus DSM 16675 in DRM medium started immediately with the rate of 0.05\u00a0 g/L/h during the first 4\u00a0 h of cultivation, and then increased significantly to the rate of 0.43\u00a0 g/L/h for 8\u00a0 h\nand then decreased to 0.12\u00a0g/L/h until the end of cultivation (Fig.\u00a0 6). The apparent growth rate was not uniform (decreased after 12\u00a0 h, but then increased again) which indicates either production of metabolites by the cells (reducing cell division) or aggregation. The apparent R. marinus DSM 16675 growth rate increased again after 17\u00a0 h of cultivation after which the optical density decreased. This might be due to aggregation or cell lysis, that could be caused by either EPSs production or lack of some nutrients such as NH4Cl (nitrogen source) since there was still glucose in the medium. The component, NH4Cl, was not added to the medium at high level due to precipitation problem but can be added gradually during a fed-batch cultivation mode.\nIn DMB-Pmin, glucose consumption started after 2\u00a0 h with the rate of 0.14\u00a0g/L/h and then after 6\u00a0h of cultivation increased significantly with the rate of 0.4\u00a0g/L/h for 8\u00a0h and then decreased to 0.14\u00a0g/L/h till the end of cultivation. The maximum consumption rate of glucose in both media was in the same range.\nThe possibility of R. marinus DSM 16675 to grow in DRM supplemented with higher concentration of glucose than 5\u00a0 g/L, was also tested (10, 15 and 20\u00a0 g glucose/L). R. marinus DSM 16675 grew in all cultures which means that there was no inhibitory effect of high concentration of sugars on cell growth (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2). The maximum cell density (OD620\u00a0 nm) and overall glucose consumption were, however, similar in all the cultivations which might be due to lack of other nutrients that can be added in a fed-batch mode.\nProduct formation comparison and\u00a0correlation between\u00a0growth and\u00a0product formation in\u00a0the\u00a0original DMB and\u00a0developed DRM media The total carotenoids and EPSs produced by R. marinus DSM16675 in the DRM medium are shown in (Fig.\u00a0 7). The highest total carotenoids concentration (0.77 \u00d7 10\u20133\u00a0mg/L) produced by R. marinus DSM 16675 was obtained in the DRM medium supplemented with 5\u00a0g/L glucose at 18\u00a0h cultivation.\nEPSs production in DRM was also higher than in the other defined media, with the highest EPSs production (3.4 \u00b1 0.17\u00a0mg/L) found after 24\u00a0h with the yield of 0.7 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0mg EPSs/g consumed glucose and a volumetric productivity of 0.13 \u00b1 0.006\u00a0 mg/L/h. Both the carotenoid- and EPSs production were higher in DRM than in the DMB medium that was used as the starting point for the development.\nRegression analysis between the CDW of R. marinus DSM 16675 and the produced metabolites in the DMBmedium at 2\u00a0g/L glucose and modified Wolfe\u2019s medium containing yeast extract supplemented with 5\u00a0 g/L glucose, showed moderate correlation between production of carotenoids and EPSs with increasing CDW (Table\u00a06) while in modified Wolfe\u2019s medium with and without yeast extract supplemented with 2.5\u00a0 g/L glucose and without yeast extract supplemented with 5\u00a0 g/L, showed strong correlation between production of and EPSs with increasing CDW (Table\u00a06).\nThe CDW of the R. marinus DSM 16675 cultivated in DRM medium supplemented with 5\u00a0g/L glucose strongly correlated with the carotenoids concentration while the EPSs production was less well correlated. This is not surprising, as it is a consequence of EPSs production continuing into the stationary phase.\nThe final concentration of macro-elements and additives in the DRM and the preparation conditions are shown in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S3, respectively."

The spectrum was similar to the FT-IR spectrum of EPSs produced by R. marinus DSM 16675 grown in marine broth and showed the same functional groups as previously identified [2]. Briefly, the IR spectra exhibited a broad peak at around 3303\u00a0 cm\u22121 (range 3600\u20133200\u00a0 cm\u22121) for O\u2013H stretching vibration of the polysaccharide. The peak at 1635\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponded to a C=O stretching vibration of the N-acetyl group or protonated carboxylic. Also, at 1540\u00a0 cm\u22121 a peak was observed which was assigned to the N\u2013H deformation vibration of an amine group. The peak at 1521 was assigned to the secondary amid group. Another peak at 1412\u00a0 cm\u22121 could be attributed to the symetric stretching of the COO\u2212 group. The peak at 1219\u00a0 cm\u22121 was corresponded to an O\u2013S\u2013O group that is an evidence of sulfate esters. The strong absorption at 1050\u00a0 cm\u22121 in the range of 1200\u20131000\u00a0 cm\u22121 which is anomeric region, was attributed to C\u2013O\u2013C and C\u2013O groups in polysaccharides and suggested that a monosaccharide in the EPSs had a\npyranose ring.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Development of a defined minimal medium for growth of R. marinus DSM 16675 is important for studies of metabolic pathways in the microorganism, to control consumption of the carbon source, and to introduce changes during process development. R. marinus can utilize several mono-(glucose, galactose) [5], di-(lactose, maltose, sucrose) [2] and polysaccharides (xylan) [15] as sole carbon source. The results of previous cultivation studies of R. marinus DSM 16675 on complex media supplemented with glucose as carbon source have shown that glucose may not be the most preferred carbon source for R. marinus DSM 16675 [8], and may also not be the most favored substrate for EPSs production [16]. One reason for this might be due to the thermal lability of glucose at high temperature as seen in the growth profile of the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus [17]. However, as glucose is the most established carbon source for analysis of metabolic routes, and often the first choice in defined media carbon source supplementation, it was chosen as the sole carbon source during the development of a defined minimal medium for R. marinus DSM 16675. In the first inoculum preparation from the agar plate to the liquid defined medium supplemented with 2\u00a0g/L glucose, it took a long time to reach the final cell density, OD620\u00a0 nm = 2. The second and third inoculum preparations resulted in cell proliferation in shorter time, indicating adaptation to the conditions.\nThe existing defined medium, DMB, was optimized by changing the concentration of one of the four medium components at a time: CaSO4, MgCl2, phosphate (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4) or NH4Cl. The subsequent growth rates and glucose uptake rates were determined and an increased concentration of any of these components resulted in complete consumption of glucose (5\u00a0 g/L) and better growth compared to the original medium. A genome-scale metabolic model of R. marinus [18] was used to estimate the required concentration\nof the main medium components for optimized growth and to facilitate interpretation of the results obtained here. The model was used to predict the growth rates, using default model constraints, and the resulting fluxes of the three metabolites: phosphate, sulfate and ammonium were compared to the in\u00a0 vivo data obtained here. The in\u00a0 vivo fluxes were approximated from Fig.\u00a0 7, by calculating the complete consumption of the available metabolites in the medium by the obtained cell mass over the time that the cells were in growth phase (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S5). This analysis indicated that the original DMB medium contained barely enough phosphate to obtain maximum growth, which supports the decision to increase the phosphate concentration in the DRM medium. The analysis also indicated that the ammonium concentration in the DMB medium was too low, which supported the in\u00a0vivo experiments where glucose was taken up faster with a higher ammonium concentration in the medium. Also, Dudman et\u00a0al. [19] described that the nitrogen source increased the growth of Rhizobium meliloti, an EPSs producing bacterium, in defined medium, but the DMB medium with increased NH4Cl resulted in precipitation problems. This was most likely caused by the combined concentrations of NH4Cl, MgCl2, and phosphate that have the tendency to make a struvite complex (MgNH4PO4\u00b76H2O) in aqueous solutions [20]. For this reason, the ammonium concentration was not increased in the DRM medium.\nThe sulfate concentration used in the DMB medium was estimated to be sufficient, according to model simulations. However, in\u00a0vivo growth of R. marinus in DMB medium with 10 times less sulfate did result in poor growth (data not shown, as growth experiments using different concentrations of sulfate were performed in a different lab with other minor medium changes). The calculated sulfate flux based on the model, indicated that the 10 times lower sulfate concentration was indeed too low to obtain maximum growth, strengthening the reliability of the model simulations. The highest glucose uptake rate in\u00a0vivo was obtained using a higher concentration of CaSO4. It is known that Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ ions are necessary for utilization of the substrate and production of polysaccharides as cofactors [21\u201323]. However, the solubility of calcium salts in aqueous solutions is low and higher concentration of CaSO4 caused precipitation of the salt in the medium, making a higher amount difficult to include in soluble form. In conclusion, the medium with higher levels of phosphate solution (DMBP) was chosen for the batch cultivation studies displayed here since no precipitation was observed in the medium and the glucose was almost completely consumed after 24\u00a0 h of R. marinus DSM 16675 cultivation. Further\nsupplementation based on the simulations can be considered for feeding during cultivations in stirred tanks.\nIn the second step of medium screening, the added amino acids (N and Q) and ferric citrate were removed from the medium. The utilization rate of the glucose as carbon source by R. marinus DSM 16675 in DMB-P without amino acids was lower than that in the corresponding medium containing amino acids. On the other hand, the results indicated that R. marinus DSM 16675 growth was not strictly dependent on presence of the two amino acids. Moreover, a medium without the two amino acids might be beneficial for industrial use in future, as it will result in less expensive components. Hence, depending on the application, amino acids can be added or removed from the medium.\nIron is, in general, essential for bacteria due to its application in cellular respiration and DNA synthesis. In contradiction to this, R. marinus DSM 16675 grew better in the DMB-P without ferric citrate. The absence of this micronutrient might, however, be a reason for the lack of repeatability of the DMB-Pmin, as growth failed after several re-inoculations in the medium. Use of this element at high concentration might be toxic or inhibitory, and has been reported to have a negative effect on cell growth [24, 25]. Bacteria, in general, can take up ferrous iron (Fe2+) via a ferrous ion internalization system [26]. Therefore, ferric iron (Fe3+) should be converted to Fe2+ to simplify the uptake. This could be possible by R. marinus ferredoxin (GenBank: AF515798.1) [27] or ferric reductase (GenBank: ACY47438.1) [4]. High concentration of Fe2+ is, however, still toxic for the cells due to its tendency to react with oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which subsequently, can damage the proteins, DNA, and membrane lipids [25]. The concentration of iron as ferric citrate in DMB was 0.06\u00a0g/L and in the DMB trace elements solution, the concentration of ferrous iron chloride was 1\u00a0 g/L. Removal of ferric iron citrate and replacement the DMB trace elements solution by the Wolfe\u2019s trace elements solution might have increased the bioavailability of iron for the R. marinus DSM 16675 to uptake at a low concentration [28], as iron was added as Fe2+ at a very low concentration (FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.1\u00a0g/L) in Wolfe\u2019s trace elements solution (Table\u00a0 4). Another possibility is that R. marinus might utilize innate immunity [29], restricting iron to very low concentrations, preventing its uptake [30].\nWolfe\u2019s trace elements solution and vitamins solution was evaluated to investigate cell proliferation when repeatedly using the resulting final medium (termed DRM). Wolfe\u2019s trace elements solution contains Mg2+, SO42+, Ca2+, K+, and NaCl which were not present in the DMB trace element solutions, but as these components were supplied as medium ingredients, they might not be\nnecessary. The Zn2+ is a cofactor for many enzymes and may be a valuable addition to the trace elements solution (Table\u00a04), making only small amounts necessary.\nThe Wolfe\u2019s vitamins solution (Table\u00a05) contains all the vitamins present in the DMB vitamins solutions, but also include folic acid, riboflavin, and thioctic acid. Moreover, a higher amount of the vitamin solution (5\u00d7) is used. Folic acid, a B-vitamin, is necessary for production of some amino acids [31] and cannot be replaced by any other vitamins or chemicals. The p-aminobenzoic acid is necessary for biosynthesis of folic acid [32]. The concentration of p-aminobenzoic acid in Wolfe\u2019s vitamins solutions (5\u00a0mg/L) was higher than that of the DMB vitamins solutions (4\u00a0mg/L), and additional folic acid (2\u00a0mg/L) was added to the Wolfe\u2019s vitamins solution, which may be advantageous for growth in a minimal medium. Riboflavin is a precursor of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in oxidative metabolisms in most bacteria [33]. It can be a replacement of iron as enzyme cofactor flavin-dependent enzymes, due to iron restriction as described above and subsequently, downregulation of the non-essential iron-dependent enzymes (iron-sparing) aiming at keeping iron for fundamental functions [28]. Also, thioctic acid (lipoic acid) was added to the vitamin solution since it is an essential cofactor for oxidative metabolism [34, 35] in aerobic bacteria. Based on this, the change of vitamin solution, may be an important factor for the increased repeatability of the R. marinus cultivations.\nBacterial secondary metabolites are non-essential products where the yield mainly depends on the cultivation niche and medium ingredients [36]. The bioactive carotenoids can have a protective role against radiation, oxidation, desiccation and high temperature by reinforcing the mechanical strength, flexibility, rigidity to the cell membrane and lowering the susceptibility to lipid peroxidation [37\u201340]. The experiments conducted were considering the optimum conditions for R. marinus DSM 16675 without relating to the external light source, indicating that the total carotenoids production was related to the cell biomass production. The positive correlation of total carotenoids production with CDW in the media used here, supports this hypothesis in the present study (Table\u00a06).\nThe yield of EPSs by the R. marinus DSM 16675 was higher in the modified Wolfe\u2019s medium, than when yeast extract was supplied to the same, but longer lag phase was seen, and glucose consumption level was lower (Table\u00a0 2, Figs.\u00a0 6 and 7) indicating an imbalanced nutritional status. The consumption of external carbon source (glucose) by the R. marinus DSM 16675 in DRM, however, had a positive influence on both total carotenoids\nand EPSs production (Fig.\u00a0 7), but may have resulted in conditions that stressed the bacterial cells.\nRhodothermus marinus DSM 16675 has the capability to produce a variety of carbohydrate degrading enzymes allowing utilization of different mono, di, oligo, and polysaccharides including its own EPSs, when carbon availability is low. Hence, EPSs productivity may vary dependent on nutrient availability. The apparent EPSs production started at the exponential phase in DRM with 5\u00a0 g/L glucose supplementation. However, it cannot be excluded that the reason might be competition between cell growth and EPSs production, and better availability of medium components for EPSs production at the stationary phase may be beneficial [41]."

[11] and the salts of ATCC1599, a defined medium base (DMB) was made (Table\u00a0 1). The DMB was prepared with 20\u00a0mL of filter-sterilized l-glutamine (Gln, 1% w/v) and 20\u00a0mL of filter-sterilized l-asparagine (Asn, 1% w/v). The concentration of nitriloacetic acid was increased to 2\u00a0g to avoid of small precipitation that happened by adding of 1.32\u00a0g (the original value) to the medium solution. The aqueous glucose stock solution (100\u00a0g/L) was prepared and filter-sterilized. All the filtersterilized stock solutions were sterilized using 0.2\u00a0 \u00b5m sterile polypropylene syringe filters. Every time freshly prepared medium was made, a final glucose concentration of 2 or 5\u00a0g/L was used, and the final pH was adjusted to 7.2 using 6\u00a0M NaOH.\nThe modified Wolfe\u2019s medium [12, 13] was prepared as described in (Table\u00a01). The modified Wolfe\u2019s medium was prepared without and with yeast extract (0.05\u00a0g/L), separately. All the filter-sterilized stock solutions were sterilized using 0.2\u00a0 \u00b5m sterile polypropylene syringe filters. Freshly prepared medium was used in all cultivations, with a final glucose concentration of 2.5 or 5\u00a0g/L and the final pH was adjusted to 7.2 using 6\u00a0M NaOH."

The samples were taken every 2\u00a0 h for further analysis.\nThe glucose concentration in all media at the 2nd and 3rd step of inoculum preparation was 2\u00a0g/L except for the final optimized medium in which cells could manage to grow at 5\u00a0g/L glucose.\nThree step screening of\u00a0the\u00a0effect of\u00a0medium component concentrations by\u00a0a\u00a0one factor at\u00a0a\u00a0time strategy DMB was used as medium to screen the influence of substrate consumption or cell growth by varying the concentration of macroelement medium components using a modified one-factor-at-a-time screening strategy [14].\nIn the first step of screening, four factors from the medium macroelements were selected, and screened in cultivations of R. marinus DSM 16675 (Table\u00a0 3). Two sets of experiments were performed. In one set of experiments one of the selected components (Table\u00a0 3) was set at high level keeping the other selected components at low level. The remaining medium components were added as described for DMB (Table\u00a01). Glucose concentration was 2\u00a0g/L in the medium for preparation of inoculum at 2nd and 3rd step of inoculum preparation, and 5\u00a0 g/L in all cultivation experiments. The original DMB medium (Table\u00a0 1) was used as control. In another set of experiments, 6 parallel experiments were performed using high levels of two components at a time, keeping other selected components at low level, and the other medium components at the original level. The cultivations were performed as single experiments at 65\u00a0\u00b0C with constant shaking of 200\u00a0rpm and 10% v/v inoculum using 50\u00a0mL falcon tubes containing 25\u00a0mL of culture medium. Samples were taken after 0, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h of cultivation for further analysis.\nIn the second step of screening, four sets of experiments were performed, again using DMB with the glucose concentration of 2\u00a0g/L for the inoculum preparation. The culture medium was the optimum medium chosen from the first screening step (DMB-P), which was used as control in this step. The other three cultivations contained the same medium without (a) ferric citrate, (b) without amino acids (l-glutamine and l-asparagine), and (c) without both ferric citrate and amino acids. The cultivations were performed in duplicate at 65\u00a0 \u00b0C with constant shaking of 200\u00a0 rpm and 10% v/v inoculum in 1\u00a0 L baffled shake flasks containing 100\u00a0 mL of culture medium. Samples were taken every 2\u00a0h of cultivation for further analysis. This, resulted in additional modification (DMB-Pmin).\nIn the third step, the trace elements solution and vitamins solution were simply replaced by the Wolfe\u2019s trace elements and Wolfe\u2019s vitamins solution (Tables\u00a04 and 5) [12, 13] in the DMB-Pmin (lacking ferric citrate and the amino acids N and Q). This medium was termed DRM (Defined Rhodothermus medium). Cultivation of R.\nmarinus DSM 16675 was carried out in duplicate in 1\u00a0L baffled shake flask containing 100\u00a0mL of DRM, in presence of 5\u00a0 g/L glucose. The cultivation was performed at 65\u00a0 \u00b0C with constant shaking of 200\u00a0 rpm and 10% v/v inoculum (prepared in similar medium with the glucose concentration of 5\u00a0g/L) samples were taken every 2\u00a0h of cultivation for further analysis."

After incubation for 1\u00a0h with constant shaking on a rocking table at room temperature, the cells were separated by centrifugation at 16,000\u00d7g for 3\u00a0 min and then the absorbance of the supernatant was measured by a UV quartz cuvette (Hellma) in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Pharmacia biotech, Ultrospec 1000) at 450\u00a0nm. Acetone as lysis solution was used as control.\nThe major carotenoid in R. marinus DSM 16675 is salinixanthin as described by Ron et\u00a0 al. [3]. Therefore, the concentration of the total carotenoids from R. marinus DSM 16675 can be estimated using the Beer\u2013Lambert equation and then plotted versus cultivation time:\nwhere C is the concentration of the carotenoid (g/L), A is the measured absorbance, \u025b is the extinction coefficient at specific wavelength [L/(mol \u00d7 cm)], and d is the width of the cuvette (usually 1\u00a0cm).

As eluents ultrapure water, 2\u00a0mM NaOH, and 200\u00a0mM NaOH were used with three separate pumps. Separation occurred at 23\u00a0min of running time by 62.5% ultrapure water and 37.5% of 2\u00a0mM NaOH mixture with an isocratic flow of 0.5\u00a0mL/min. The column was reinforced each time with 200\u00a0mM NaOH for 2\u00a0min at 0.5\u00a0mL/min flow rate. ED40 electro-chemical detector was used to detect the glucose consumption and monosaccharide content of EPSs.\nDetermination of glucose concentration as a remaining substrate in the culture medium was done by filtering the cell-free culture medium through a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm polypropylene filter into a plastic vial after proper dilution and analysis by HPAEC-PAD.\nThe EPSs were extracted and analyzed by a method described by Sardari et\u00a0 al. [2]. One milliliter of sample was pelleted down using centrifuge at 13,000\u00a0 rpm for 3\u00a0 min. After adding the fourfold volume of ethanol (99.5%) to the cell-free supernatant, the crude EPSs was precipitated by keeping the samples at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u20132\u00a0days.
