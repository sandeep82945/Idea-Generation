    "abstractText": "Background: Portable electroencephalogram (EEG) systems are often used in health care applications to record brain signals because their ease of use. An electrooculogram (EOG) is a common, low frequency, high amplitude artifact of the eye blink signal that might confuse disease diagnosis. As a result, artifact removal approaches in single EEG portable devices are in high demand. Materials: Dataset 2a from the BCI Competition IV was employed. It contains the EEG data from nine subjects. To determine the EOG effect, each session starts with 5 min of EEG data. This recording lasted for two minutes with the eyes open, one minute with the eyes closed, and one minute with eye movements. Methodology: This article presents the automated removal of EOG artifacts from EEG signals. Circulant Singular Spectrum Analysis (CiSSA) was used to decompose the EOG contaminated EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Next, we identified the artifact signal components using kurtosis and energy values and removed them using 4-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Results: The proposed approach was evaluated on synthetic and real EEG data and found to be effective in eliminating EOG artifacts while maintaining low frequency EEG information. CiSSA-DWT achieved the best signal to artifact ratio (SAR), mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and correlation coefficient (CC) of 1.4525, 0.0801, 18.274, and 0.9883, respectively. Comparison: The developed technique outperforms existing artifact suppression techniques according to performance measures. Conclusions: This advancement is important for brain science and can contribute as an initial pre-processing step for research related to EEG signals.",

EEG signals are often employed in applications being the brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) system, which extracts the EEG signal information and forwards it to a physical system as a command signal. Several approaches for extracting EEG components for band identification in BCI applications have been presented [6,7]. Biological artifacts, namely electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyogram (EMG), usually contaminate recorded EEG data. The EOG artifact is caused by eye blinking or movement and contaminates the EEG signal. In this work, we referred to the EOG artifact as an eye blink artifact since it is an unregulated, instinctive behavior that occurs every five seconds. The EEG low frequency spectrum (0.5\u201312 Hz) is generally contaminated by the eye blink artifact [8]. Because of this, the informational value of the EEG data is affected and its removal is important. Therefore, removing EOG artifacts is a vital task to be performed before analyzing the EEG data [9].\nSensors 2023, 23, 1235. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23031235 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors"

            "text": "In Mannan et al. [10\u201312], various single and multi-channel approaches were established. By combining overlap segmented adaptive singular spectrum analysis (Ov-ASSA) and adaptive noise canceler (ANC), Noorbasha et al. [13] established a single channel artifact elimination system with clear improvements in epilepsy identification. A unique approach, designated as singular spectrum analysis, independent component analysis, and stationary wavelet transform (SSA-ICA-SWT) [14], was introduced according to the combination of SSA and ICA with a SWT, and it produced the good artifact elimination work different to current methods such as SSA, SSA-ANC, and SSA-ICA. Researchers have been particularly interested in blind source separation (BSS), which does not require any prior knowledge of EOG and is useful for removing artifacts from multichannel contaminated EEG data [15]. To eliminate artifacts from multichannel EEG recordings, BSS approaches such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), ICA were applied [16\u201319]. In comparison to the CCA approach, the ICA methodology has been widely used to eliminate eye blink artifacts from EEG recordings [17,19]. For successful removal of eye blink artifacts from multi- channel EEG data, numerous various methods were used with ICA [20\u201322]. The drawback of ICA is that there needs to be a very large number of channels employed to collect the data relative to the underlying artifactual sources. To suppress the artifact from EEG data, the artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) approach was developed in Chang et al. [23]. The effectiveness of the approach is controlled by the parameter. Despite doing a comprehensive analysis to identify the cut-off value, choosing it incorrectly might cause the EEG data to be lost [23,24]. The need for at-home healthcare observation has lately grown as a result of an increase in chronic illnesses as well as population aging [25]. Portable EEG devices have been used in several studies for a variety of purposes, including mental state investigation in stroke sufferers, driver fatigue, sleep disorders, and event related potential (ERP)-based BCI applications [26,27]. Traditional ERP analysis treats ERPs as being time-locked to the commencement of a motor or sensory stimulus. ERPs are distinct variations in the brain\u2019s electrical potential. The examination of ERP signals is useful for memory, language, and attention research in psychology. An ERP is obscured in single trials by background EEG activity and artifact contamination of the recordings. Hence, a common ERP analysis calls for averaging the data over several trials to reveal the ERP signal of interest [28]. The use of single-trial ERP analysis is growing, and a variety of techniques are being used to denoize ERPs in order to eliminate artifacts and underline EEG activity [29]. Denoizing techniques include Wiener filtering and autoregressive modeling. Because wavelets more effectively manage the nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of ERPs, they are becoming more widely used for this application. Wavelets offer a helpful time-frequency decomposition for ERP research, but they are unable to remove undesired EEG activity. In these circumstances, wavelet denoizing could add false ERP waves [29]. Wavelets cannot be used before artifact-contaminated trials have been eliminated, which means that valuable EEG samples are lost. The main barrier to such denoizing is ocular artifacts, which appear in the same low frequency regions as the ERP signals and skew the ERP activity [30]. To reduce cognitive load on the patient, portable EEG devices by fewer EEG channels, particularly single EEG channel devices, have recently been designed [31,32]. As a result, multichannel ICA and ASR approaches cannot be employed to suppress eye blink artifacts in EEG recordings by a single channel due to collecting the data relative to the underlying sources. As a result, new approaches for processing EEG data that tailored are required. One way of processing EEG data by single channel is to apply an adaptive filter (AF). He et al. [33] were the first to discuss the benefit of AF to eliminate eye blink artifacts from EEG data but it needs reference signals to eliminate artifacts from EEG single channel data. In Peng et al. [34], AF and DWT are combined to address this issue. In this method, the contaminated EEG signal is employed to produce the reference signal for AF-DWT. The AF then removes the eye blink artifact from the EEG data using the predicted eye blink artifact signal as a reference signal. The reference signal for the AF is computed\nusing DWT with a contaminated EEG signal in this technique. Hence the adaptive filter uses the predicted eye blink artifact signal as a reference signal to eliminate the eye- blink artifact from the EEG signal. The Savitzky\u2013Golay (SG) filter has recently been used to predict the reference signal required by an AF [35]. To reduce eye blink artifacts from single channel EEG, the variational mode extraction (VME) and DWT approaches were recently coupled [36]. The EOG artifact period is initially determined using VME in this manner. The EOG of the EEG signal is then filtered using the DWT method. Although the nonartifact segments of the EEG signal were unaffected by this approach, the EOG component is removed in part from the contaminated EEG signal. An ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) using adaptive noise, which uses data-driven decomposition to suppress eye blink artifacts from EEG signal, is also described [37\u201339]. The EEG signal\u2019s non-artifact portions are altered by this technique. A subspace-based technology called SSA is employed to extract low frequency, oscillatory, and noisy elements from single time series data [40,41]. This approach has been used recently to handle biological signals [42\u201344]. It was first addressed in [45] whether SSA might be conformed to eliminate eye blink artifacts from EEG data of single channel. In conventional SSA, however, determining the required signal eigenvectors is an important phase. As a result, in [46], new criteria for identifying the eigenvectors that are used to reconstruct the required signal were presented. SSA was used amid an AF in [46] to improve the AF performance over the technique in [34]. Additionally, single channel EEG recordings have been processed to ICA using SSA [47]. SSA was newly used as a smoothing filter to reduce the EOG phenomenon from an EEG signal [48]. The circulant singular spectrum analysis (CiSSA), which is based on circulant matrixes, can be used to analyze each and every signal in a time series, and it inherently ties the frequency of interest with the specific principal components (PCs) in [49]. Because their eigenstructure has been defined as a function of frequency, their eigenvectors and eigenvalues may be naturally associated with any specific frequency. The circulant matrixes have proven to be acceptable in this specific setup. As part of the overall setup, CiSSA also uses circulant matrixes to select the eigenvectors and eigenvalues related to each frequency [50]. The CiSSA was used to decompose the EOG artifacts linked EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF\u2019s) are related to low frequency artifacts. By comparing the threshold value with the kurtosis and energy, the initial IMFs can be separated from the remainder, and the remaining IMFs may be combined together to apply inverse CiSSA (ICiSSA). Next, we used a four-level DWT of mother wavelet db4 to decompose the EOG-related IMFs into approximate and detailed coefficients, to make zero approximate coefficients due to low frequency EOG-related components, and applied an inverse DWT (IDWT) to reconstruct the signal. The resultant signal is an EOG free EEG signal and also obtain excellent correlation coefficient (CC), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and signal to artifact ratio (SAR). On synthetic and real single channel EEG data, the work of the proposed framework (CiSSA-DWT) is examined. The findings show that it outperforms existing methods and current data- driven decomposition methods. The rest of the article is structured in this manner: The proposed framework is detailed in Section 2. Performance metrics are specified in Section 3. Simulation findings are described in Section 4, discussed in Section 5, and the conclusions are presented in Section 6."

For each subject, two sessions on various days were recorded. There are six runs in each session, separated by brief rest periods. 48 trials (12 for each of the 4 possible classes) make up one run, for a total of 288 trials each session. Approximately 5 min of EEG data are collected at the start of each session to estimate the EOG influence.\nThis recording was divided into three blocks: 2 min with eyes open, 1 min with eyes closed, and 1 minute with eye movements as shown in Figure 1. All signals were recorded monopolarly, with the left mastoid serving as reference and the right mastoid as ground. In addition to the 22 EEG channels, three mono-polar EOG channels were recorded [51].\nSignal Acquisition\nThe EEG signals were sampled at 250 Hz and band pass filtered (with the 50-Hz notch filter enabled) between 0.5 and 100 Hz. The sensitivity of the amplifier was set to 1 mV. The EOG channels are provided for the subsequent application of artifact processing methods and must not be used for classification."

We use EEG signals of 2500 samples each and a sampling frequency of 250 Hz to acquire data from the mendeley database [55]. As shown in Figure 5, the true EEG signal was combined with a synthetically created eye blink artifact (EOG) in order to create a contaminated EEG signal for the simulation experiment. At p = 1, Figure 5c depicts additive mixing of real EEG and EOG artifacts, resulting in a synthetically formed contaminated EEG signal . Moreover, we present EOG free EEG signal and comparison performance of the proposed method in Figure 5d and Figure 5e, respectively. The EOG artifact is predicted in the proposed model from a single channel contaminated EEG signal using a novel approach (CiSSA-DWT) based on kurtosis and energy values. The initial phase of CiSSA in the proposed model is to create eigenvalues and vectors. The artifact component is then evaluated using diagonal averaging, which is followed by a grouping procedure. In general, the EOG component is found in the first one or two IMFs. Equations (8) and (10) were used to calculate the kurtosis and energy values of all IMFs in the proposed model. As an EOG artifact, the kurtosis and energy values of those IMFs exceed the threshold. For further decomposition, we add all of the EOG\u2019s associated IMFs, which are then fed into a four-level DWT. The DWT produces both approximate and detailed coefficients. We removed the EOG artifact by eliminating the approximation coefficients, which are low frequency components. The inverse transformation of DWT of detailed coefficients was used to reconstruct the signal. By applying inverse CiSSA to all artifact-free components, the clean EEG signals finally reconstructed and Table 1 shows the mean values of RRMSE and CC.

The performance of the recommended approach is compared to the performance of other current methods utilising the RRMSE and CC values acquired with reference to the ground truth eye blink artifact. This comparison is shown in Table 4. Under all circumstances, that is to say, p = 0.5, 1, 1.25, and 1.5, the recommended method produces mean RRMSE and CC values that are distinct from the RRMSE and CC values produced by the EEMD-ICA, the SSA-ICA, and the in [56] method. The estimated eye blink artifacts from either synthetic or actual EEG data cannot be retrieved using the previous method at either the beginning or the conclusion of the change-over points. Tables 5 and 6 and a Figure 8 give comparable comparisons between the MAE and SAR values generated by the proposed method and the values derived from real EEG data, respectively. We were able to attain higher values for performance measures in comparison to other methods that were already in use [37,46] .\nOn the other hand, we evaluated the data-driven decomposition methods, such as SSADWT, Auto-SSA-DWT, EMD-DWT, VMD-DWT, and HVD-DWT, based on the performance metrics presented in Table 5. These methods include SSA-DWT, Auto-SSA-DWT, EMDDWT, VMD-DWT, and HVD-DWT. SSA is a non-parametric method that is used in the process of signal extraction based on singular value decomposition (SVD). The requirement to calculate the frequency of components after they have been removed is a drawback of the SSA method. IMFs are meant to be extracted using EMD all the way through the filtering and iteration steps. This results in the method having restrictions in several different areas, such as the frequency resolution and the effect of the sampling frequency. VMD separates the Fourier spectrum in order to retrieve the individual signal components in an organized fashion. In the same way that different components cannot be distinguished using the Fourier spectrum, VMD is unable to do so as well. As a result, this method is constrained in the same way as the Fourier spectrum is [60]. The HHT is a method for obtaining instantaneous frequency data and decomposing a signal into what are known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a trend. Additionally, the HHT can be used to determine a linear trend. It is designed to work effectively with data that is both nonstationary and nonlinear. Because mode mixing is one of the core problems with EMD, the theoretical foundation\nof HHT is completely empirical. They also outline some of the outstanding unresolved concerns with HHT, such as the unfavorable impacts of the EMD, issues with spline, the optimal choice of IMF, and uniqueness [38]. To extract individual components from nonstationary signals, Feldman invented a technique that he called the Hilbert Vibration Decomposition (HVD) [61]. The method is analogous to EMD in the sense that it continues to use an iterative recursive decomposition process on the residual signal from the step before it [60]. The Hilbert transform, often known as the HT, is an essential part of the HVD approach, as the name of this technique suggests. For the purpose of signal decomposition of EEG data, Sharma et al. [62,63] employed the sliding window transform (SWT) and sliding mode-SSA (SM-SSA) [64]. In [65], Multivariant variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and PCA were used for EOG artifact elimination and attained the CRC value of 0.632. The CiSSA methodology that has been developed is far more separable than other decomposition methods, which makes it much simpler to organize the elemental series in order to generate the various signals. CiSSA is a more automated process, and the components that it creates are more distinct. We conclude by making a few observations that should be taken into account in future work:\n\u2022 The machine learning algorithms are not entirely explored in this research domain. Therefore, the scope of machine learning and deep learning approaches in ocular artifact removal from the EEG signal should be expanded. \u2022 Hybrid approaches should be enhanced with some additional processing stages to eliminate all the types of artifacts present in the EEG signal, as hybrid yields promising results and is growing in this area of research. \u2022 Advancements should be made to prior algorithms to develop a uniform criterion for the validation of EEG signals acquired in clinical studies.\nExperiment on Parameters Tuning\nCiSSA and DWT tuning parameters, such as embedding dimension (L) and level of decomposition, are critical. Figures 9 and 10 show the results of testing the recommended approach for various values of this parameter. As a result, L = 18 and four-level DWT decomposition yielded a superior result, and these parameters were used throughout the study. When compared to DWT tuning parameter CiSSA is important because the parameters variance is very small on synthetic and real EEG data performance metrics of DWT as shown in Figures 9 and 10."

To estimate EOG artifacts, two simple aspects of the EEG signal were used, and the CiSSA approach was used to eliminate EEG remnants from the calculated EOG artifact. The suggested approach eliminates the EOG artifact without affecting the original EEG components, according to the results. Because two features, kurtosis and energy, are effective at distinguishing the EEG and EOG components, the suggested technique was able to eliminate the EOG artifact from the EEG signals by fine-tuning its parameters. A comparison of the proposed technique to current and existing EOG artifact removal methods shows that it is better in terms of precise filtering of EOG artifacts. The proposed approach (CiSSA-DWT) can be used for EEG preprocessing in applications that just use a few or single frontal EEG channels.\nAuthor Contributions: J.Y.: Methodology, Software, Validation, Investigation, Writing\u2014original draft.
