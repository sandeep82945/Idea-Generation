            "text": "Evidence from previous studies supports the concept that spinal cord injury (SCI) induced neuropathic pain (NP) has its neural roots in the peripheral nervous system. There is uncertainty about how and to which degree nociceptors and mechanoreceptors contribute. Sensorimotor activationbased interventions (e.g. treadmill training) have been shown to reduce NP following experimental SCI, suggesting transmission of pain-alleviating signals through mechanoreceptors. At the same time, nociceptors have been shown to become hyperexcitable early after SCI and peptidergic axons sprout into deeper laminae of the below injury level dorsal horn. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively understand the relative contribution of each pathway in respect to NP presentation in a moderate mouse contusion SCI model. After genetic ablation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expressing mechanoreceptors before SCI mechanical allodynia was reduced. The identical genetic ablation after SCI did not yield any change in pain behavior. CGRP sprouting into lamina III/IV below injury level as a consequence of SCI was not altered by either mechanoreceptor ablation. Moreover, detection of hyperexcitability in nociceptors, not in mechanoreceptors, in skin-nerve preparations of contusion SCI mice 7 days after injury makes a substantial direct contribution of mechanoreceptors to NP maintenance unlikely. SNS reporter mice allowing specific visualization of the entire nociceptor population confirmed significant sprouting of respective neurons into laminae III/IV as early as 5 days post-injury. Genetic ablation of SNS-Cre mice severely affected their overall health condition, which precluded them to undergo experimental SCI and subsequent further analysis. Complementing animal data, quantitative sensory testing in human SCI subjects indicated reduced mechanical pain thresholds, whereas the mechanical detection threshold was not altered. Taken together, early mechanoreceptor ablation modulates pain behavior, most likely through indirect mechanisms. Hyperexcitable nociceptors with consecutive peptidergic fiber sprouting in the dorsal horn are confirmed as the likely main driver of SCI-induced NP. Future studies need to focus on injury-derived factors triggering early onset nociceptor hyperexcitability, which could serve as targets for more effective therapeutic interventions.\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "Neuropathic pain (NP) represents a frequent concomitant condition in individuals suffering\nfrom spinal cord injury (SCI). Available treatments are insufficiently effective and frequently associated with significant side effects. Therefore, the identification of mechanisms underlying SCIassociated NP and subsequent development of targeted pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions represent important aims to ultimately help improve the quality of life of SCI survivors.\nOver many years of research, several neuroanatomical regions have been identified as potential\nsites of NP initiation and transmission. There is the actual injury site characterized by a variable degree of both overall spinal cord tissue damage and in particular a varying lesion with respect to ascending sensory pathways \u2013 the spinothalamic and the lemniscal tract. However, in recent years secondary alterations in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) below injury level have come more and more into focus. One key observation, confirmed in a number of studies, was the detection of nociceptor spontaneous activity and hyperexcitability found in dorsal root ganglia (DRG)-derived nociceptor cultures as well as analyses in skin-nerve preparations following experimental contusion SCI (1).\nWe wondered whether hyperexcitable nociceptors are no longer properly controlled by\nappropriate mechanoreceptor input due to SCI-induced para- or tetraparesis with resulting inability to stand or walk, thus depleting physiological sensory input from the skin and joints into the dorsal horn. Accordingly, a number of studies were conducted, which showed that sensorimotor activation through treadmill training in mice with moderate thoracic contusion SCI reduced pain behavior, which was associated with reversal of structural rearrangements below injury level in the dorsal horn, namely reduction of peptidergic nociceptor sprouting into laminae III-IV (2-4). These findings raised a number of questions, which led us to a comprehensive analysis of mechanoreceptor and nociceptors.\nDo mechanoreceptors which transmit sensory input provided by sensorimotor activation (e.g.\ntreadmill training) into the dorsal horn keep by these means nociceptor firing in check? Ablation of mechanosensory neurons in mice undergoing SCI would allow us to address this question. Specific\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Previously we could demonstrate that increased CGRP-positive peptidergic fiber sprouting in lamina III/IV below injury level following thoracic contusion SCI in mice can be reduced by sensorimotor activation (2, 3). Unfortunately, genetic ablation of CGRP-positive nociceptors was not successful (Armin Blesch, personal communication). Alternatively, C and A\u03b4 nociceptive fibers were specifically ablated targeting sensory neuron specific (SNS; Nav1.8) expressing neurons, which allowed to probe their functional contribution to mechanical allodynia following PNS injury (6).\nCan we identify potential drivers of SCI-induced NP in the DRG? As previously described,\nactivity in nociceptors is likely the most important driver of NP in SCI (1). This assumption was primarily based upon DRG-derived nociceptor cultures taken from SCI animals, which indicated nociceptor hyperexcitability. While planning this study, such changes have not been reported yet in ex vivo skin-nerve preparations from below injury level, which are considered to be a better approximation towards pathophysiological events in the living animal compared to DRG cultures.\nThe relevance and comparability of animal SCI models in respect to the situation in human SCI\nsubjects is very important. Of course, identical analyses are not applicable to human subjects for obvious reasons. However, quantitative sensory testing (QST), which stands for a battery of noninvasive psychophysical measures, allows to assess the function of the somatosensory system and - more specifically - hypersensitivity towards pain and mechanical stimuli (7), thus matching preclinical assessments of nociceptors (SNStdTomato transgenic mice for morphological analysis in the dorsal horn, electrophysiological properties of nociceptors ex vivo in wildtype SCI mice) and mechanoreceptors (ablation in TrkBiDTR transgenic mice, electrophysiological properties of mechanoreceptors ex vivo in wildtype SCI mice).\nThe main aim of the present study was to comprehensively understand the initiation of NP\nsignals and related structural rearrangements in the dorsal horn below injury level.

Findings were correlated with non-invasive psychophysical measures (QST) reflecting the state of pain/touch hypersensitivity in SCI subjects up to 1 year after injury. Furthermore, genetic ablation of mechanoreceptors and nociceptors in respective transgenic mice was employed to investigate its relevance in pain behavior and structural rearrangement in the dorsal horn. Pre-SCI ablation of TrkB-expressing mechanoreceptors initially reduces mechanical allodynia but is not sustained. However, hyperexcitability was identified at 7 days post-SCI in nociceptors, not in mechanoreceptors, which in connection with rearranged peptidergic nociceptive fibers in lamina III/IV of the dorsal horn pave the way towards NP susceptibility and eventually NP manifestation."

The motor function was scored 1 day post-injury to confirm an adequate injury and weekly starting 7 days post-injury. Each hind paw was scored individually and averaged to get a single score for each animal per testing day. A score of 0 reflects complete hindlimb paralysis without ankle movement, whereas a score of 9 indicates normal locomotion. The BMS was used to evaluate sensorimotor function to ensure proper recovery of motor function for sensory testing, which requires the animals to show weight support (BMS \u2265 3).\nMechanical sensitivity testing: To evaluate changes in mechanical sensitivity after injury and ablation of specific sensory neuronal subpopulations, von Frey hair filaments with ascending diameter and force (0.16 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g, 1.4 g; Touch Test Sensory Evaluators; North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA) were applied to the hindpaws of mice as described before (2, 3).

To avoid stimulus-induced sensitization of the hind paw, up to 12 animals were tested in parallel and hind paws were stimulated in an alternating manner. Mechanical sensitivity towards each filament is defined as paw withdrawal frequency (number of positive responses divided by the number of stimuli) and expressed as the average for both hindpaws. Each animal was tested on 2 consecutive days before surgery and the mean was defined as the pre-operative baseline response rate. To investigate nocifensive response duration (removal, licking and shaking) of a subcohort of wildtype mice (SCI n= 4, sham n=4), video recording of the response towards the 0.16 g and 1.4 g von Frey filament was performed pre-operatively and 7 days post-injury (iPhone XR, 1080p HD, 240 fps, slow-motion function, 4.16 ms/frame).

Animals have the active choice between a naturally preferred dark environment or pain relief in a more aversive light environment (10). Here, it was employed to address the aversive quality of pain and thereby supraspinal processing of nociception as previously described (3). In short, animals were placed in the middle of the chamber and the time spent on the dark side of the chamber was measured. An initial 10 min exploration phase (baseline) without any stimulus was followed by a 15 min testing phase (3x 5-min blocks) in which the hindpaws were stimulated using a 0.16 g von Frey filament every 15 sec when the mouse was present on the dark side of the chamber. The left and right hindpaws were stimulated in an alternating manner.\nThermal sensitivity testing: Thermal sensitivity was assessed according to Hargreaves\u2019 method using the plantar test (Hargreaves Apparatus; Ugo Basile) as previously described (2, 3). In short, an infrared laser beam (190 \u00b1 1 mW/cm2) was presented to the plantar surface of the hindpaws and the time (sec) until withdrawal was recorded resulting in the response latency to the heat stimulus (11). To avoid tissue damage, a 15-sec cut-off time, as well as a delay of at least 1 min between two trials for the same paw and mice, was introduced. In each animal, the mean of four trials for the left and right hindpaws was used to express thermal sensitivity and testing was always performed after mechanical sensitivity was assessed. Similar to von Frey testing, the mean latency of 2 consecutive testing days before surgery or any other intervention determined the baseline of the animals (preoperatively; pre-intervention).\nTissue Processing and morphological analysis All animals were euthanized with an overdose of anesthesia cocktail (ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine) and transcardially perfused with 0.9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (2). The spinal column was dissected, post-fixed in 4 % PFA for 1 h at room temperature, and briefly rinsed with ddH2O followed by a 5 min washing in 0.1 M\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The lesion site (T11; if applicable), the L4-L6 spinal cord, as well as L4-L6 DRG were identified using anatomical landmarks (12), embedded in Tissue-Tek\u00ae O.C.T compound (Sakura Finetek, Germany) followed by serial sectioning (spinal cord, 16 and 25 \u00b5m coronal; DRG, 10 \u00b5m) directly on to slides as previously described (2, 3).\nEriochrome Cyanine staining: The lesion size of injured animals was analyzed by quantifying the spared tissue at the lesion epicenter. Two consecutive series were stained for myelin using Eriochrome-Cyanine (EC) as previously described (2, 3). Tissue sparing at the lesion epicenter (smallest area of spared white matter) was quantified by outlining areas with light and dark blue staining and expressed as the percent of cross-sectional area calculated by dividing the white matter area by the total cross-sectional area. Imaging and analysis was performed blinded to group identity using ImageJ.\nImmunohistochemistry: Immunohistochemical labeling was performed on slides with serial sections of the lumbar spinal cord (L4-L6) and the corresponding L4-L6 DRG. Slides were dried for 30 min at room temperature, encircled with a liquid blocker and rinsed in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Sections were blocked and permeabilized by incubating in TBS/0.25 % Triton TX-100/5 % donkey serum followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in TBS/ 0.25 % Triton TX-100/1 % donkey serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. On day 2, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), rinsed, dried and cover-slipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) (3). For each animal, images of the left and right dorsal horn of three labeled sections with an intersection distance ranging from 700-1400 \u00b5m were taken at 20 x magnification with the same resolution, lens aperture, and exposure time using a XC30 camera mounted on an Olympus BX53 microscope with epifluorescence illumination and appropriate filter cubes.

The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-CGRP (Immunostar, 24112; 1:200), rabbit anti-protein kinase C\u03b3 (PKC\u03b3 [C19], Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-211; 1:200), guinea pig antiNeuN (Millipore, ABN90; 1:2000) and goat anti-human HB-EGF (R&D Systems, AF-259-NA; 1:40). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit and donkey anti-goat (all Life Technologies; 1:300), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:300), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:300).\nQuantification of labeling density in the spinal cord: The termination pattern of peptidergic-and nonpeptidergic fiber was analyzed in lamina III-IV of the dorsal horn as previously described (3). In short, an analysis box was placed in the center of the dorsal horn adjoining the ventral border of lamina IIi which was identified by PKC\u03b3-labeling. The dorsoventral extent of lamina IIi was used as a reference for the dimensions of the region of interest (ROI) analysis box. Images were processed by setting a labeling threshold minimizing background and accurately reflecting CGRP- and Tomatopositive fiber labeling. Labeling density was expressed as percentage of positive labeling within the analysis box and the values for three sections per animal were averaged. Quantification of labeling density was performed blinded to group identity using ImageJ.\nQuantification of ablated DRG neurons: In TrkBiDTR L4-L6 DRG quantification of HB EGF+ in NeuN+ neurons was used to evaluate the proportion of neurons expressing DTR (DTR+/NeuN+)."

The sural nerve was led through a small hole into the adjacent mineral oil filled recording chamber. The nerve was teased into thin bundles that were laid on a silver wire recording electrode connected to a differential amplifier (Digitimer, modules NL104, NL125/NL126) and nerve fiber activity was recorded with the Powerlab 2 4SP system and Labchart 7.1 software (AD Instruments). The receptive fields of single nerve fibers were located by manually probing the skin using von Frey hair filaments. To distinguish between A\u03b2-fibers, A\u03b4-fibers and C-fibers, action potentials were evoked by electrical stimulation of the receptive fields and the axonal conduction velocities were calculated by dividing the distance between the stimulation electrode and the recording electrode by the delay between the onset of electrical stimulation and the arrival of the action potential at the recording electrode. Nerve fibers with a conduction velocity greater than 10 m/s were classified as A\u03b2-fibers, fibers with a CV between 1 and 10 m/s as A\u03b4/fibers and fibers with a CV < 1m/s as Cfibers. To further distinguish between nociceptors and mechanoreceptors, the mechanical activation thresholds were determined with von Frey hair filaments. Finally, to determine the action potential firing rates and adaptation patterns at different stimulus strengths, the receptive fields were stimulated with ramp-and-hold stimuli applied with a linear piezo actuator (Nanomotor\u00ae, Kleindiek) equipped with a force measurement system (FMS-LS, Kleindiek) to measure the exact force of the applied stimulus."

QST represents a comprehensive protocol for assessing the sensory system and is reported to give indication of sensory tract integrity concerning both the peripheral and the central nervous system. For the classification of existing pain problems in individuals with SCI all participants received the clinical assessment EMSCI Pain Assessment Form (EPAF) that is in accordance with international guidelines and recommendations for the clinically documentation and assessment of pain in SCI (15). All indivuduals received this assessment in the three mentioned time points (1 , 3 and 12 months).\nIn consideration of the methodological approach for the animal model, special focus was set on\nthe evaluation of the mechanical detection threshold (MDT) representing a test for A-fibers\n(mechanoreceptors) and the mechanical pain threshold (MPT) to function as indicator for A-fibers\n(nociceptors) (16-18). While MDT was performed via modified von Frey hair filaments (contact area 0.5 mm in diameter; Optihair2-Set, Marstock Nervetest, Germany) applying forces from 0.25-512 mN, starting with 8 mN, MPT was assessed by means of (weighted) pin prick examination (contact area 0.25 mm in diameter) applying forces from 8 to 512 mN, starting with 8mN (18).\nDedicated areas being tested as to alterations of sensory function were the dermatomes L4\n(medial right shin, mid-way between knee and ankle) and L5 (dorsum of the foot, third metatarsal phalangeal joint).

            "text": "Pre-injury ablation of TrkB-expressing mechanosensory neurons reduces NP behavior following mouse contusion SCI We hypothesized that low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), responsible for light touch, mediate beneficial sensory input provided by natural locomotor activity or in an enhanced setting such as treadmill training (4, 26-28). Therefore, we investigated the contribution of TrkB-expressing LTMRs (identified as A\u03b4-LTMRs, D-hair, and rapidly adapting A\u03b2 mechanoreceptors, A\u03b2-RAMs) to SCI-induced mechanical allodynia by ablating TrkB-expressing LTMRs in TrkBCreERT2:AviliDTR (TrkBDTR) mice.\nFirst, to determine the contribution of TrkB-expressing sensory neurons to established signs of\nSCI-induced neuropathic pain, respective neurons were genetically ablated 14 days following thoracic contusion SCI using diphtheria toxin (DTX), when mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia have already developed (Fig.1A). Prior to SCI, tamoxifen administration did not affect mechanical and thermal sensitivity (data not shown) and as expected all SCI animals developed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 7 days post-injury (Fig. 1E-G, I, Two-way RM ANOVA, time differences p<0.0001). Genetic ablation resulted in a 97% reduction in TrkB+/DTR+ neurons (Fig. 1B-D; t-test p<0.0001 DTX vs. saline). Despite the high ablation efficiency, no significant effect of post-SCI ablation on mechanical hypersensitivity was observed. Statistical analysis indicated no overall group differences comparing the response rates for the small diameter von Frey hair filaments (0.04 g - 0.16 g) between saline-injected control and ablated SCI animals (Fig. 1 E-G, Two-way RM ANOVA Group: 0.04 g, p=0.54; 0.07 g, p=0.27; 0.16, g p=0.06). In line with this observation, supraspinal processing assessed by the place escape/avoidance paradigm (PEAP) also showed no difference between groups in response to the 0.16 g filament (Fig. 1 H, Twoway RM ANOVA p=0.23 for group differences). Post-SCI ablation did not affect response rates measured using larger diameter innocuous von Frey hair filaments (Suppl.

Fig. 1 B-C; Two-way RM ANOVA, group differences 0.6 g, p=0.04; 1.4 g, p=0.01). TrkB-expressing LTMR ablation did not affect motor recovery (Fig. 1 J). Following SCI, significant thermal hypersensitivity (Hargreaves\u2019 method) was observed for all SCI animals irrespective of ablation (Fig. 1 I, Two-way RM ANOVA, baseline vs 7 dpi p<0,0001, group differences p=0.02, no significant Sidak pairwise comparisons). No significant differences in white matter sparing (lesion size) were observed between saline-injected controls and ablated SCI mice (Suppl. Fig. 2 A; t-test p=0.52). Taken together, these results suggest that TrkB-expressing sensory neurons do not play a role in already developed and stably present mechanical allodynia following SCI. Second, to determine the role of TrkB-expressing sensory neurons in the initiation of SCI-induced neuropathic pain, neurons were ablated prior to SCI. This resulted in an effective reduction of >90 % of DTR+ neurons in lumbar DRG (L4-L6) (Fig. 2 B-D; t-test p<0.0001 DTX vs. saline control group). Without injury no differences in mechanical or thermal sensitivity were observed (Fig. 2 E-G, I, Suppl. Fig. 1 D-F). All SCI animals of the saline-injected control group showed mechanical hypersensitivity at 7 days post-injury compared to pre-SCI values using small-diameter von Frey filaments (Fig. 2 E-G). Interestingly, a significant group effect was observed (Fig. 2 E-G; Two-way RM ANOVA group differences: 0.04 g, p=0.004; 0.07 g, p=0.008; 0.16 g, p=0.013). However, TrkBablated SCI animals (DTX group) showed a lower response rate than the control group only at 21 days post-injury indicating a small but significant effect of pre-injury ablation of TrkB-expressing sensory neurons on SCI-induced mechanical allodynia. In line with the lack of group differences to the 0.16 g von Frey hair filament at the end of the experiment, the PEAP indicated SCI-induced mechanical allodynia in both groups (Fig. 2 H, Two-way RM ANOVA group differences p=0.49). Pre-SCI ablation did not affect response rates measured using larger diameter (0.4 g - 1.4 g) von Frey hair filaments (Suppl. Fig. 1 D-F, Two-way RM ANOVA, group differences 0.4 g, p=0.11; 0.6 g, p=0.11; 1.4 g, p=0.13).

Additionally, differences in sensory behavior of saline-injected and ablated SCI animals cannot be attributed to difference in white matter sparing (lesion size) (Suppl. Fig. 2 B, t-test p=0.69). Taken together, only pre-injury \u2013 not post-injury - ablation of TrkB-expressing mechanosensory neurons reduces SCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Regardless of the ablation timing (post- or pre-SCI), CGRP-density in laminae III-IV of the lumbar dorsal horn was not reduced in respective transgenic SCI mice compared to the non-ablated SCI control group (Fig. 3 A-F). Therefore, SCI-induced maladaptive structural changes regarding sprouting of CGRP-expressing fibers were not influenced by ablation of TrkB-expressing sensory neurons and existed while mechanical allodynia was present.\nSprouting of nociceptive fibers parallels the development of SCI-induced mechanical allodynia To determine the distribution and sprouting pattern of all nociceptive (peptidergic and nonpeptidergic) neurons as opposed to only CGRP expressing peptidergic nociceptors, the temporal dynamics of nociceptive fiber sprouting in response to SCI and its relation to the development of NP was investigated. We therefore took advantage of a previously described sensory neuron specific (SNS; Nav1.8) Cre-driver line showing recombination in all nociceptive neurons of the DRG in combination with additional CGRP staining. This labeling and staining combination ensures that the observed SCI-induced structural changes are not specifically Nav1.8- or CGRP- dependent (Suppl Fig. 3). The previously established SNStdTomato mice (6, 29) were examined for nociceptive fiber sprouting (3, 5, 7 and 21 days post-injury) and NP behavior before and 7, 14 and 21 days post-injury. These timepoints were chosen based on motor deficits as a consequence of SCI allowing the assessment of sensory changes only after weight support is re-gained (7 days post-injury; BMS 3-4), whereas at 21 days post-injury NP is fully established (2, 3). As expected, following a moderate T11 spinal cord contusion injury mice developed mechanical allodynia (0.16g von Frey hair filament) as early as 7 days post-injury that persisted through 21 days\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Hypoalgesia to noxious stimuli (0.6 g and 1.4 g von Frey hair filaments) developed and persisted as well (Fig. 4 A). Further, thermal hyperalgesia (Hargreaves\u2019 method) started as early as 7 days post-injury and persisted through 21 days post-injury (Suppl. Fig. 4 A-B). All SCI animals were confirmed to have significant hindlimb motor deficits by BMS at all timepoints compared with Sham animals (Suppl. Fig. 4 C). In line with the motor deficits, quantification of white matter sparing indicated greater than 50% loss of white matter and gray matter damage at the lesion epicenter (Suppl. Fig. 4 D-E). To understand if SCI-induced aberrant structural changes arise prior to and may be responsible for the development of NP, nociceptive fiber sprouting was compared at 3, 5, 7 and 21 days post-injury. While at 3 days post-injury, no difference was observed comparing Sham and SCI mice (Fig. 4 B, C, G-H), at 5 days post-injury tdTomato- and CGRP-labeling density in laminae III-IV of the lumbar (L4-L6) dorsal horn was increased by approximately 70% in the SCI group and persisted through 21 days post-injury (Fig. 4 B, D-H One-way ANOVA p<0.0001; 5, 7 and 21 dpi Fischer least significant difference, FLSD p\u22640.0001). To further shed light on nociceptive neurons contributing to SCI-induced pain behavior, nociceptive Nav1.8-expressing neurons were genetically ablated in SNS Cre::R26iDTR (SNSiDTR) mice (Suppl. Fig. 5). However, ablation of nociceptive neurons through intraperitoneal injection of DTX in SNSiDTR mice induced seizures in some animals (n=3), which had to be sacrificed, while others died within hours (n=3).\nExperimental contusion SCI induces nociceptor, but not mechanoreceptor, hyperexcitability To identify the key neuronal population (nociceptors or mechanoreceptors) driving nociceptive fiber sprouting in the dorsal horn and mechanical allodynia as correlate of NP behavior, ex vivo skin-nerve preparations were investigated.\nSingle-unit teased fiber recordings from ex-vivo hindpaw skin-nerve preparations revealed that\nC- and A\u03b4-fiber nociceptive sensory afferents displayed decreased mechanical activation thresholds\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Thus, a significantly higher proportion of C-fiber nociceptors responded to forces smaller than 125 mN (Fig. 5 E, multiple Chi-Squared tests). Moreover, C-fiber nociceptors fired significantly more action potentials in response to mechanical ramp-and-hold stimuli (Fig. 5 F, multiple Mann-Whitney tests) and exhibited continuous action potential firing after removal of the stimulus (Fig. 5 G-I, multiple Mann-Whitney tests). These afterdischarges were also observed in A\u03b4-fiber nociceptors (Fig. 5 G and H). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of A\u03b4-fiber nociceptors responded to forces at 17.5 and 22.5 mN (Fig. 5 C, multiple Chi-squared tests); however, they did not fire more action potentials in response to mechanical ramp-and-hold stimuli (Fig. 5 D, multiple Mann-Whitney tests). Most importantly, no significant changes in the mechanical activation thresholds or the action potential firing rates were observed after SCI in the three major classes of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (RA A\u03b2-LTMRs, SA A\u03b2-LTMRs, DH A\u03b4-LTMRs, Fig. 5J\u2013M). Therefore, a midthoracic contusion SCI induces hyperexcitability of peripheral nociceptive fibers but not mechanoreceptors of the hindpaw.\nDoes prolonged nocifensive behavior such as removal, licking and shaking correlate with the\nextension of the firing past stimulus removal? Indeed, almost a doubling of the response duration of the SCI mice to the 0.16 g filament was observed at 7 days post-injury (Fig. 6 A, t-test p=0.03). Also the response rate for these mice was significantly increased 7 days post-injury (Fig. 6 B, Two-way RM ANOVA, group differences, p=0.03). Therefore, the continued firing observed in nociceptors appears to be behaviorally expressed by prolonged nocifensive behavior in SCI mice.\nNociceptor hypersensitivity is observed in SCI subjects up to one year post-injury The best approximation towards the relevance in nociceptors versus mechanoreceptors in initiating/maintaining hyperexcitability and NP presentation, quantitative sensory testing (QST) was employed. QST was performed 1, 3 and 12 months post-injury in 17 conveniently sampled individuals with SCI varying in age (18 \u2013 75 years), sex (male, n=13; female, n=4), cause of injury (traumatic, n=11; ischemic, n=5; or hemorrhagic, n=1), initial classification according to the ASIA\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "Results from the present study improve our understanding of initiation and maintenance of NP\nsignals in traumatic SCI. NP ameliorating effects of mechanoreceptor ablation depend on the timing of ablation in relation to the time of injury. Only pre-SCI mechanoreceptor reduces pain behavior, suggesting a potentially NP inducing role. Replicating previously published evidence, nociceptors become hyperexcitable early after SCI. Respective signals are likely further augmented by early structural rearrangement of nociceptive nerve endings in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord below injury level, which help to maintain NP over time.\nThe finding that pre-SCI ablation of mechanoreceptors - not post-SCI ablation - reduces pain\nbehavior, points toward a NP inducing rather than a NP maintaining effect. This is supported by the absence of mechanoreceptor hyperexcitability in hindpaw skin-nerve preparation 7 days after thoracic contusion SCI in mice. A recent publication investigating hyperexcitability in DRG in a skin-DRGspinal cord preparation 1 day after mouse contusion injury made the identical observation of absent mechanoreceptor hyperexcitability (30). Central branches of mechanoreceptors form the lemniscal tract, which reach from their entry point into the spinal cord below injury level all the way to and across the spinal cord injury site. There is a vast body of evidence describing molecular changes in DRG neurons caused by lemniscal tract lesions (31, 32), which not only underlie the poor regenerative capacity of these axons, but may also be causally linked to nociceptor hyperexcitability. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) released within DRG has been reported to signal nociceptor hyperexcitability after SCI (33). Whether this a consequence of lemniscal tract injury or related to systemic signals released after SCI irrespective of specific lemniscal tract injury has yet to be determined. A previous study, which would argue against the concept of retrograde signaling along the injured lemniscal tract to trigger NP behavior, reported reduced mechanical allodynia in a rat thoracic lateral hemisection SCI model after subsequent (1 day later) rostral dorsal column (containing the lemniscal tract/central branches of mechanosensory neurons) transection (34).

Not only are there no major changes in respect to pain behavior compared to non-ablated SCI mice, but enhanced peptidergic nociceptor sprouting in the dorsal horn post-SCI was also not altered by mechanoreceptor ablation. Nevertheless, we and others have identified a robust pain relieving effect of sensorimotor activity such as treadmill training (2, 3, 35, 36). Of course, other pain reducing mediators of activity/exercise have been identified, which do not rely on neural transmission through mechanoreceptors. For example, in a spinal nerve ligation model of NP, endogenous opioid content was increased in the brainstem following treadmill training, whereas such effects were reversed by opioid receptor antagonists (37). Following direct injury to the PNS - spared nerve injury (common peroneal and tibial nerve ligated and cut, sural nerve left intact) \u2013 identical transgenic mice, in which TrkB expressing mechanoreceptors were ablated - did not develop pain behavior (mechanical allodynia) (5). Of course, following experimental SCI, there is no direct mechanical injury to the peripheral branch of DRG neurons, which could account for the observed differences.\nOne week following moderate thoracic contusion SCI in mice, nociceptors were identified to\nbe hyperexcitable in skin-nerve preparations (lower activation thresholds and afterdischarges). These findings are in line with studies in cultured DRG neurons (38-41) and confirm recent evidence in skin-nerve-DRG-spinal cord preparations taken 1 day post-injury in a moderate mouse contusion SCI model (30). Moreover, the observation of afterdischarges in nociceptors represents the likely correlate of prolonged hindpaw nocifensive behavior (licking, shaking, holding) in response to lighter von Frey hair filaments in SCI contused mice 7 days post-injury and goes beyond reflexive movements thus suggesting a supraspinal pain response.\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

In a PNS injury model (spared nerve injury), late ablation of nociceptors in SNSiDTR mice fully abrogated mechanical allodynia of disorganized reinnervated tibial nerve regions (6). Unfortunately, the poor health condition of SNSiDTR mice in our hands with the presentation of seizures was not sufficient to inflict contusion SCI and a prolonged survival period on these animals. In SNStdTomato we observed a leaky reporter expression (42) that based on breeding records could be traced back to Rosa26LSL-tdTomato mice. SNStdTomato animals exhibiting a wrong reporter expression presented with red paws and removed from the study. Even inner organs appeared red following transcardial perfusion. Of course, in SNSiDTR mice the leaky expression would not be visible, because instead of the tdTomato reporter, the iDTR cassette was inserted into the Rosa26 locus and driven by the CAG promoter.\nIn subjects suffering from subacute traumatic SCI, hypersensitivity to mechanical pain stimuli\nwas observed, which in principle is supported by preclinical findings of nociceptor hyperexcitability and dorsal horn nociceptor sprouting. Of course, in human subjects systematic assessment options are limited, which do not allow to clearly identify neuroanatomical regions (DRG, dorsal horn), where signals for NP are initiated and maintained. The observed hypersensitivity to mechanical pain stimuli was identified in SCI patients with and without NP. This points again towards co-factors such as the integrity of ascending sensory pathways within the spinal cord, which together with DRG hyperexcitability and dorsal horn nociceptor sprouting define NP presentation. Standardized sensory examination according to International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) in subacute traumatic and ischemic SCI patients observed within the European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) revealed relative preservation of the spinothalamic tract (pinprick sensation), which predisposes for NP presentation (unpublished observation). In clinically sensorimotor complete SCI subjects (AIS-A), an instrumented analysis with contact-heat evoked measurements (CHEPS) also identified partial preservation of the spinothalamic tract to be associated with NP (43).\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Nociceptors are confirmed as the main drivers of NP maintenance, which is highlighted by the hyperexcitability of nociceptors, nociceptor sprouting in the dorsal horn following experimental SCI complemented by nociceptor hypersensitivity in human SCI subjects. Hyperexcitability inducing factors, either transmitted systemically or retrogradely along injured axons (central branch of mechanoreceptors) into/towards DRG have yet to be defined. According to this understanding, the term \u201ccentral NP\u201d used to describe SCI-induced NP should be reconsidered. Of course, the initial trigger results from the central nervous system injury. However, the most likely driver of SCI-related NP sits in the peripheral nervous system showing also many similarities to pathophysiological changes observed following direct peripheral nerve injury."
