The synthetized carbon materials were tested for the\nelectrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A higher fraction of chitosan in the precursor led to a decrease in meso- and nano-porosity of the formed porous carbons, while their\nactivity towards H2O2 generation increased. The nitrogen species derived from chitosan seem to play a very important role.

Currently, H2O2 is produced on an industrial scale via the anthraquinone-mediated reduction of oxygen (O2) known as the autooxidation or AO-process for short.12 The main drawbacks of the AO-process are the excessive use of organic solvents, its complexity, and organic contamination of H2O2.11 Most use cases of H2O2, require aqueous solutions of up to 9% by weight.7 Alternative routes for H2O2 have been proposed, such as direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2, thereby eliminating the separation step in production. However, in practice, the gas mixture (H2/O2) needs to be diluted, in order to avoid the risk of explosion. Moreover, only pure O2 in excess can be used, but not air, hence, increasing costs of production and making upscaling difficult, at the current state of the art.13 Alternatively, the electrochemical reduction of O2 can generate H2O2 directly, avoiding the aforementioned issues.14 The O2 reduction reaction (ORR) can proceed via the two-electron pathway and generate H2O2, or alternatively via the four-electron pathway\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22777\u201322788 | 22777\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

To make electrochemical production of H2O2 economical, the amount of electricity consumed per mol of H2O2 produced needs to be minimized.7 Cost reduction and efficient use of electricity is possible with a suitable cathode catalyst that is able to achieve high faradaic efficiencies over an extended period and at high current densities.18,19 Over the years, many catalyst materials were tested for the electrochemical H2O2 production, including: pure metal surfaces,20 various alloys,21 single atom catalysts22,23 and carbon-coated metal nanoparticles.24 The main issue with noble metal catalysts is their availability. Many are scarce and at the same time difficult to extract and scale.25 Additionally, even minute residues of heavy metals, such as mercury16 can be problematic in long-term applications in some elds, such as agriculture.\nOrganic waste and biomass, as nature-derived materials and being low cost and abundant, are recently and intensively studied for clean energy storage and conversion applications.26 Carbon materials can be produced from organic waste products, thereby providing a sustainable source of catalyst material.27 As the production of municipal waste increases,28 the topic of waste recycling and valorisation is crucial for enabling sustainable development.29 For instance, the recycling of waste from corn stover,30 oats husks,31 tire rubber,32 eggshells,33 sugarcane processing residue,34 bamboo35 and coffee waste36\u201338 have been considered as possible pathways to produce various carbon materials. Coffee waste, for example, is characterized by high organic content, in the form of polysaccharides, fatty and amino acids, polyphenols and various minerals.36 Therefore, the wide consumption of coffee39 coupled with its high organic content make it a suitable candidate precursor for carbon materials with variable properties, such as sustainable catalyst materials. Chitin is a naturally abundant polysaccharide, primarily found in crustaceans, with a similar structure and function to cellulose. Chitosan on the other hand, is a Ndeacetylated derivative of chitin. Both chitin and chitosan possess a higher nitrogen content than synthetically substituted cellulose.40 High nitrogen content of chitosan coupled with its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity41 make chitosan an excellent starting material to produce nitrogendoped (N-doped) carbons, especially since it is abundant and a by-product of the food industry.42 Recent work conducted by Khan et al., showed that chitosan, in the presence of a codopant, in this case graphitic nanoparticles, can enhance the selectivity of the chitosan derived N-doped carbon material towards the two-electron O2 reduction and generate peroxide.43 Chitosan-derived N-doped electrocatalysts obtained by direct\n22778 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22777\u201322788\npyrolysis of chitosan or chitosan/1,10-phenanthroline could successfully electrogenerate H2O2 in amounts high enough for its direct application in Fenton-based electrochemical water treatment.44 When such a catalyst is doped with Fe aer the rst pyrolysis step, a catalyst with improved Fe\u2013Nx catalytic sites and high selectivity towards the 4e\u2212 ORR can be obtained.45\nIn the present work, we studied the inuence of the chitosan : coffee ratio of blends and of the biopolymer : KOH ratio used for activation on the porous structure formation and chemical composition of a series of N-doped porous carbons obtained by pyrolysis. The synthetized carbon materials were tested in electrocatalytic processes, namely, the oxygen reduction to H2O2. The focus was set on developing a facile procedure, which enables the production of high surface area porous carbons which are able to favour the two-electron reaction pathway of the ORR. The complex correlations between the synthesis conditions, material characteristics and their efficiency to the H2O2 generation were discussed in depth."

The RRDE had a collection efficiency N = 0.25. The electrolyte used was aqueous 0.1 M HClO4 prepared from 70% HClO4 (ROTIPURAN\u00aeSupra) by dilution with Milli-Q water (18.2 MU). The catalyst ink was prepared by suspending the catalyst powder in a solution containing 70% isopropanol (99.5%, Roth\u00ae), 29.6% Milli-Q water and 0.4% Naon\u00ae (5 wt% Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae).

These differences in the specic surface areas of the carbonized materials may also be a consequence of the differences in the porous structures of the biopolymeric precursors used: while the porous chitosan obtained by freeze-drying from hydrogels has generally a microporous cellular structure,48 the coffee waste, though more porous, exhibits a poorly developed mesoporosity.49 A higher KOH ratio in the precursor mixture seems to favour the formation of even higher specic surface areas. This agrees with the ndings of Tseng et al.,50 who were able to demonstrate that by increasing the KOH/char ratio when a chemical activation is performed the micropore development will be favoured, leading to the formation of carbons with higher specic surface areas.\nThe agglomerate size in 70% isopropanol\u201330% water, relevant for the electrode preparation, was estimated to be between ca. 300 and 600 nm (see ESI Fig. SI5\u2020).\nThe Raman spectra of the N-doped carbons are presented in Fig. 3.

The samples with the highest nitrogen content (S5) and (S3) also exhibit the highest disorder degree. Exception seems to be the sample (S6) which exhibits high disorder but the nitrogen content is much lower. However, deconvolution of the broad signal peaks into multiple strongly overlapping bands can be done only with considerable statistical uncertainty, so these values need to be taken tentatively.53\nClearly, the nitrogen amount in the pyrolyzed materials is strongly dependent on the used precursors: the pyrolyzed chitosan contains the highest amount of nitrogen (Table 2). For some of the samples the oxygen could not be detected by CHNO method but was observed by XPS suggesting that there may be oxygen in the sample bound in complexes, which may be present in the samples as impurities. Note, the ratio of chitosan : coffee of the biopolymer used for the preparation of sample S3 is 4 : 1, i.e., higher than those used for sample S4, that is, 2 : 1, cf. Table 1.\nFig. 4 presents the N 1s XPS spectra of the nitrogen-doped carbons obtained in the frame of this work. As the position and the intensity of the N 1s peaks of the nitrogen-doped carbons prepared by thermal decomposition of biopolymerbased precursors may be affected by different conguration effects like hydrogenation, oxidation or protonation, the deconvolution of the spectra and the assignment of the peaks is difficult. The recorded spectra exhibited peaks around 398.5 eV, 400.2 eV, 400.6 eV and 402 eV which based on specialized\nwork.

Additionally, the distribution of the nitrogen species within the analysed N-doped carbons is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe XPS results conrmed that the materials prepared from precursors with a higher chitosan content contained higher amounts of total nitrogen trapped inside the carbon lattice. The relationship between certain nitrogen species and catalyst performance is discussed later in this work.\nSince it is well-known that the presence of trace amounts of metals can inuence the selectivity of carbon-based catalysts for the ORR,57\u201359 time-of-ight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been employed in order to analyze traces of transition metals within the catalytic powders, which, e.g., could stem from the natural precursor materials coffee and chitosan or from the preparation procedure in general,60,61 ToFSIMS in this respect offers a high surface and detection sensitivity, which makes it well suited for ppm level metal analysis of surfaces and near-surface layers.\nAt rst, near-surface analysis of samples S1 to S6 employing an O2\n+ ion source for sputtering has been performed. This ensures a particularly high sensitivity for the detection of electropositive elements, such as transition metals.62 As the matrix elements of the samples result in a rich and complex mass spectrum, the analysis here focuses on the lower mass range, i.e., on metals from the rst transition series, in order to ensure proper peak identication. Note, this includes common trace elements in coffee and chitosan as reported in the literature.60,61 Table 3 lists respective secondary ion intensities normalized by the intensity of the C+ mass peak. Virtually no mass peaks of metals from the rst transition series were detected on the Kapton tape reference sample.\nFor further reference also normalized intensities of the N+ and Si+ mass peaks are shown in Table 3. These ion intensities show a reasonable linear relationship to the corresponding atomic ratios obtained from the XPS analysis (Table SI2\u2020), suggesting that matrix effects, which in many cases complicate the ToF-SIMS analysis, are weak.62,63 For this reason, the normalized secondary ion intensities here, in rst approximation, are considered to represent a measure of the relative concentration ratios. In good agreement with the XPS data, the normalized intensity of the N+ mass peak shows an increasing trend with increasing chitosan content of the precursor\n22782 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22777\u201322788\nmaterial. As evident from the data, however, the normalized intensity of the mass peaks of most transition metals shows no clear correlation with the coffee to chitosan mixture ratio. One notable exception being the normalized intensity of the Cr+ mass peak, which increases with increasing chitosan content of the precursor material in S2\u2013S5. Note, samples S2\u2013S5 are prepared following the same overall procedure, cf. Table 1, hence no matrix effects as a result from varying preparation conditions are expected. Also, the samples prepared from 100% coffee, S1 and S2, yield a higher normalized intensity the Cu+ mass peak, when compared with S5, prepared from 100% chitosan, and S3, S4 and S6, prepared from material containing higher amounts of chitosan.\nFor semiquantitative MCs+ analysis complementary measurements employing a Cs+/Xe+ ion source has been carried out.64 This yields MCs+ secondary ions of the transition metals, M. Also Si in this analysis yields SiCs+ secondary ions. Respective secondary ion intensities of the SiCs+ mass peak are used for normalization. Generally, IMCs+/ISiCs+ intensity ratios are less affected by matrix effects and hence scale with corresponding relative concentration ratios M/Si.64 Unambiguous peak identication, however, is challenging in the higher mass range. Also mass interferences limit the analysis. The FeCs+ mass peak, for example, overlaps with the Si2Cs + mass peak. Isotope patterns can help to identify such mass interferences and allow for proper peak identication. The intensities of SiCs+, 29SiCs+, 30SiCs+ mass peak, for example, are in good agreement with the natural isotope pattern of Si, which clearly allows one to identify the SiCs+ mass peak. Mass interferences, however, cannot generally be discerned and ruled out in the high mass range, particularly for monoisotopic elements, e.g., Mn and Co. For these reasons IMCs+/ISiCs+ intensity ratios here are considered as upper bounds. In order to calculate upper bounds of the concentration of the transition metals these intensity ratios are multiplied with the atomic concentration of Si from the corresponding XPS analysis, i.e. about 1 at%. Table 4 lists respective upper bounds of the transition metal concentrations for samples S2 and S5, which are prepared from 100% coffee and 100% chitosan, respectively. Most values are in the range 10\u20131000 ppm range. The upper bounds for Mn are close to 1 at%. No Mn is detected in the XPS analysis suggesting, as discussed above, that the Mn+ mass peak indeed signicantly interferes with mass peaks of other secondary ion species, e.g., CsKO+.\nAs expected, ToF-SIMS analysis of the near-surface region of the catalytic materials reveals the presence of some metals of the rst transition series, i.e., Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and Cu are identied via their isotope patterns. Normalized intensities of the N+ and Si+ mass peaks show a reasonable linear relationship to the corresponding atomic ratios obtained from the XPS analysis, suggesting that (i) matrix effects are weak and (ii) normalized secondary ion intensities represent relative measures of the concentration ratios. In good agreement with the XPS data, the normalized intensity of the N+ mass peak shows an increasing trend with increasing chitosan content of the precursor material. Also, the normalized intensity of Cr+ mass peak correlates with the chitosan amount used in the precursor material and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Fig. 5.\nTo determine the selectivity of N doped porous carbons towards 2-electron oxygen reduction to H2O2 rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were conducted and the results are presented in Fig. 6. Where Fig. 6a shows the CVs of each sample in an Ar saturated electrolyte from 0 to 0.9 V recorded at 100 mV s\u22121, done as a preconditioning step. Additionally, the CVs in the non-faradaic region allow the determination of the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the various samples. While S1, S2 and S6 show higher surface areas (SBET)\n22784 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22777\u201322788\nthan S4, S3 and S5 (cf. Fig. 1), the CV response and Cdl are the same order of magnitude for all materials (Fig. SI1 and SI2\u2020). To determine the selectivity of N-doped porous carbons towards two-electron ORR to H2O2 RRDE measurements were conducted. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to study H2O2 formation in a O2 saturated electrolyte; the corresponding disk current which arises from the O2 reduction is shown in Fig. 6c (bottom), whereas the Pt ring current originates from oxidation of H2O2 (Fig. 6c, top). The faradaic efficiency of N-doped porous carbons at various potentials is presented in Fig. 6b. Out of the N-doped porous carbons tested, sample S6 showed the highest FE of 69 \u00b1 2% at \u22120.2 V. This value is nearly 15% higher than that for samples S1 and S2 which were derived only from coffee (i.e., no chitosan used). Such a difference in the FE of the conversion to H2O2 suggests the importance of chitosan doping in the synthesis of carbon catalysts for H2O2 generation. Furthermore, the highest ring currents were achieved by S5, S4, S6 and S3, whereas lower ring currents were generated by S1 and S2.\nThe existence of multiple nitrogen functional groups in the N-doped carbon material makes it difficult to decouple which catalytic sites are active during catalysis, and moreover under which conditions.65,66 Nonetheless, a quasi linear relationship between the amount of pyridinic nitrogen in our carbons and FE [%] was obtained as shown in Fig. 7.\nEffects of different nitrogen groups on the ORR have been studied with computational methods over the years, in an attempt to decouple the various effects different nitrogen groups have on the ORR. However, the focus of these studies was usually the four-electron pathway, and only recently the two-electron pathway has attracted more interest by researchers.67,68\nRecent experimental work done by the groups of Strasser69,70 and Fornasiero71 has tried to shed more light on the complicated interface during ORR. By measuring the nitrogen content of the carbons before and aer the ORR at different pH, it was observed that the amount of pyridinic nitrogen diminishes aer the ORR in low pH. This observation was explained by a protonation effect that occurs on the pyridinic nitrogen atom which inuences the ORR pathway, thus making pyridinic nitrogen active for the ORR to H2O2 in acidic pH, but not in neutral or basic pH, where other nitrogen functional groups have a more pronounced effect on the ORR pathway.69\u201371\nDepending on the effective catalytic activity of pyridinic nitrogen on one hand and metal-containing structural entities on the other hand transitionmetals might well contribute to the overall catalytic performance of the samples.57,72 In view of the higher concentration of pyridinic nitrogen these species could dominate the catalytic performance of the samples prepared with the addition of chitosan. In addition, transition metals might explain the catalytic performance of those samples prepared from 100% coffee.\nTable 5 summarizes the faradaic efficiencies and partial current densities of all tested samples at \u22120.2 V. Again, it is shown that the carbon samples that contained chitosan as a nitrogen source show higher faradaic efficiency. The faradaic efficiency might also correlate with the degree of disorder (cf.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Additionally, higher specic surface area suggests an improved accessibility of the active centres, which may also lead to improved electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the partial current densities per geometric surface area, jH2O2,geom which were calculated from eqn (2) do not show signicant differences. When normalized per electrochemical surface area (ECSA) gained form the double layer charging experiments (Table S1\u2020), jH2O2,DL, we observe that S5 has a markedly higher partial current density, notably this carbon also has a low BET surface area.\nWhile most applications of hydrogen peroxide require diluted solutions,73,74 it is still desirable to be able to achieve higher concentrations in real-world devices. However, this is highly dependent on the design of the cell.75 To gain insight into the long-term performance of our porous carbon materials we\nneration at \u22120.2 V of porous carbon-based samples\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Similarly, to our results in the three-electrode set up, samples S6 and S5 showed the best performance, with 1662.5 mmolmgcat \u22121 cm2 h\u22121 and 1757.5 mmolmgcat \u22121 cm2 h\u22121 of H2O2 produced, respectfully (Fig. SI3\u2020). The slight difference in total amount of H2O2 produced per catalyst loading could be explained by a difference in the electrochemical surface area of the samples.\nThe inversely proportional dependence of the selectivity for the two-electron pathway of SBET is at rst glance in contrast to some previously observed effects for commercial carbon black materials, where micropore volume promoted the reaction18 (although it is well-known that mesopores also display a promoting effect76). However, the carbons investigated in that work did not contain a substantial amount of nitrogen groups, that is ca. 50\u20132000 ppm only, while the best performing carbons in this work contain several at% N (cf. Table 2), i.e., several orders of magnitude more. In this regard special attention needs to be paid to the nitrogen groups introduced by the addition of chitosan. The exact role of different nitrogen functionalities in carbon are still somewhat under debate.19 This is due to several factors, such as: the inuence of even minor metal contamination,77,78 effects of loading,79 hydrophobicity,80 difficulty synthesizing carbons with a single site type, differences between as-synthesized materials and materials in operando, etc. Zhao et al.81 showed that the overall amount of N does not in itself determine ORR activity, but that pyridinic and quaternary N lead to a lower overpotential for ORR, although in their work they used the RDE and only observed the overall ORR. Shari et al.82 found that the four-electron process proceeded mostly on quaternary N, while pyridinic sites favoured the two-electron pathway on heat-treated N-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Several other researchers also noted the positive effect of pyridinic nitrogen to improve the selectivity for the 2-electron process.10,71 DFT calculations by Chen et al.83 identify several types of graphitic-N sites as active for the fourelectron process. Nonetheless, e.g., Artyushkova et al.54 have considered that pyrrolic N serves as an active site for the rst step of the oxygen reduction reaction, while it was assumed that pyridinic N reduces H2O2 further to water but in a lower amount."
