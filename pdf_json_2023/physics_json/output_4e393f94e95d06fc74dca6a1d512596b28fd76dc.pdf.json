    "abstractText": "The rational regulation of catalyst active sites at atomic scale is a key approach to unveil the relationship between structure and catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a strategy for the controllable deposition of Bi on Pd nanocubes (Pd NCs) in the priority order from corners to edges and then to facets (Pd NCs@Bi). The spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-STEM) results indicated that Bi2O3 with an amorphous structure covers the specific sites of Pd NCs. When only the corners and edges of the Pd NCs were covered, the supported Pd NCs@Bi catalyst exhibited an optimal trade-off between high conversion and selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene under ethylene-rich conditions (99.7% C2H2 conversion and 94.3% C2H4 selectivity at 170 \u25e6C) with remarkable long-term stability. According to the H2-TPR and C2H4-TPD measurements, the moderate hydrogen dissociation and the weak ethylene adsorption are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. Following these results, the selectively Bideposited Pd nanoparticle catalysts showed incredible acetylene hydrogenation performance, which provides a feasible perspective to design and develop highly selective hydrogenation catalysts for industrial applications.",

            "text": "The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is essential for the industrial removal of trace acetylene impurities in an ethylene-rich stream produced from the cracking process [1\u20134]. Herein, two key issues should be addressed. One is that the included acetylene can deactivate the Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts during subsequent polymerization [5]. The other is that the over\u2013hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane greatly reduces the commercial value. Owing to its high hydrogenation activity, Pd is regarded as the most optimum candidate for acetylene hydrogenation [6]. However, Pd-based catalysts usually suffer from low selectivity to ethylene, especially at high acetylene conversions, and poor long\u2013term stability due to the formation of green oil. The poor selectivity of Pd catalysts is due to the superior hydrogen dissociation capacity and strong ethylene adsorption [7]. Numerous efforts, including site-isolation strategies and local environmental regulations for regulating the electronic and/or geometric structures of Pd, have been made to improve the selectivity by incorporating a second metal to form Pd-based intermetallic compounds, alloys and single\u2013atom catalysts [8\u201319]. However, these strategies are mostly achieved at the expense of catalytic activity. More importantly, due to the limitations of synthetic methods, the regulation of Pd active sites is usually accomplished through nonselective doping, which results in an excessive poisoning of the active sites. Consequently,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2335. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052335 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2335 2 of 11\nit remains challenging to selectively regulate the Pd active sites for an optimum catalytic performance because of the inherent trade-off between high catalytic activity and selectivity. Acetylene semi-hydrogenation over Pd catalysts is well-known to be structuresensitive [20]. Different types of active sites, including corners, edges and facets, have diverse effects on the catalytic performance [21\u201324]. To guide the design of catalysts with a high catalytic performance, it is crucial to precisely regulate the active sites and selectively expose specific active sites to gain an in-depth understanding toward the structure-activity relationship of the Pd catalysts. Bismuth-modification has recently been reported as an effective strategy to improve the selective hydrogenation performance of Pd catalysts [25\u201328]. In this work, we have achieved the selective deposition of Bi on Pd nanocubes (Pd NCs) from the corners to the edges and then to the facets (Pd NCs@Bi) by regulating the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio. The as-synthesized nanocrystals were further loaded on \u03b1-Al2O3 to form the Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts. The selective deposition on the corners and edges of Pd NC endows the catalyst with the unique properties of moderate hydrogen dissociation and weak ethylene adsorption, leading to an optimal trade-off between high conversion and selectivity for selective acetylene hydrogenation. The catalyst exhibits 94.3% C2H4 selectivity at 99.7% C2H2 conversion and good long-term stability under the simulated reaction conditions of front-end acetylene hydrogenation."

Schematically, Pd NCs with an average size of 20 nm were synthesized via the liquid phase synthesis method (Figures S1a and S2). Figure 1a shows the lattice fringes of the Pd NCs with an interplanar d-spacing of 1.94 \u00c5, which corresponds to the (200) plane of fcc Pd [29]. The subsequent deposition of Bi on the Pd NCs was accomplished by reducing Bi3+ ions to Bi using NH3\u00b7BH3 as the reductant and Pd NCs as the seeds (Figure S1b). The inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-OES) results indicate that the actual Bi-to-Pd molar ratio is consistent with the feeding ratio (Table S1). According to the literature, the newly formed atoms should preferentially grow along the corners and edges of the pre-deposited metal, followed by the location of the facets to minimize the surface free energy [22,30].

            "text": "Pd molar ratio is 0.5 (Figures 1d and S7a\u2013c). The line-scanning analysis results further demonstrate that Bi is primarily distributed at the corners and edges of the Pd NCs (Figure S7d). Furthermore, the HRTEM images of Pd NCs@Bi1 show that the surface of the PdNCs is entirely covered by Bi when the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio is 1 (Figures 1e and S8a\u2013c). It is further proven through line-scanning analysis that Bi completely covers the Pd NCs, forming core-shell-like structures (Figure S8d). These results clearly prove that the precise deposition of Bi on the Pd NCs in the order of the corners, edges and facets can be achieved by adjusting the Bi concentration.\nTo further clarify the microstructures of Pd NCs@Bi, spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-STEM) was employed. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the bulge-like structures in Pd NCs@Bi0.5 show lattice distances of ca. 2.35 and 1.94 \u00c5, which are attributed to the (400) and (321) planes of the BiPd3 structure (Pmma (51) space group, orthorhombic structure) [26,31]. According to the literature and recent studies by our group, we speculate that the formation of the BiPd3 structure is the result of the interdiffusion of Bi and Pd in the radial direction due to strong interaction [32,33]. More importantly, it can be seen more clearly that the BiPd3 structure is covered by an amorphous phase (Figure 2c). The element mapping confirms that Pd and Bi are evenly dispersed within the bulge-like structures, which is also consistent with the BiPd3 structure, and Bi is also observed on the amorphous phase outside the BiPd3 structure (Figure 2d). Meanwhile, the XPS analysis of \u03b1-Al2O3-supported Pd NCs@Bi0.5 (Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3) shows that Bi2O3 is the dominant structure (Figure S9), which implies that the amorphous phase is Bi2O3. This could be attributed to the easy oxidation of metal Bi in the air [34]. The results above demonstrate that the deposition of Bi on Pd NCs forms a BiPd3 structure, which is subsequently covered by Bi2O3. Hence, the site-specific deposition of Bi can be considered as the selective coverage of Bi2O3 at the predetermined position of the Pd NCs. Additionally, the site-specific deposition of Bi can also be achieved on Pd NCs with a 7 nm size (Figure S10). As displayed in the HRTEM images of Pd7nm NCs@Bi0.5, the bulge-\nFigure 1.

The illustrations in the upper right corners represent the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio. The diagram below represents corresponding models of Pd NCs@Bi.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2335 3 of 11\nNotably, the reducibility of the reductants is also vital for the selective deposition of Bi on Pd NCs. When the NaBH4 with strong reducibility was used as the reductant, some Bi were dispersed as nanoparticles instead of deposition on Pd NCs (Figure S3). In contrast, when weakening the reducibility of NH3\u00b7BH3 with NaOH (NH3\u00b7BH3-NaOH), the surface of the Pd NCs was coated by an amorphous phase, and selective deposition was not observed (Figure S4). According to the theory proposed by Xia, the growth pathway of atoms on seed has a strong dependence on the ratio between the rates for atom deposition and surface diffusion (i.e., Vdeposition/Vdiffusion), where Vdiffusion is a thermodynamic parameter and Vdeposition is related to the reducibility of the reductant [30]. Given that the samples were prepared at room temperature, the low value of Vdiffusion allowed for the effect of Bi surface diffusion to be ignored. Consequently, the selective deposition of Bi at various locations on the Pd NCs could be controlled by changing the Bi-to-Pd feeding ratio and selecting the appropriate reductant. The morphology of the Pd NCs@Bi was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As is shown in Figure 1b, the bulge-like structures (red dashed circles in Figure S5a\u2013c) appear at the corners of the Pd NCs as the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio is 0.06. The line-scanning analysis results show that only Pd signals are detected at the locations of the Pd NCs, whereas strong Bi signals appear near the bulge-like structures (Figure S5d), indicating that Bi is significantly dispersed at the corners of Pd NCs. By further increasing the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio, it is evident that the bulge-like structures for Pd NCs@Bi0.25 are present at all the corners of the Pd NCs (Figure 1c and Figure S6a\u2013c). The line-scanning images reveal that Bi is predominantly distributed at the corners of the Pd NCs (Figure S6d). As shown in the HRTEM images of Pd NCs@Bi0.5, the bulge-like structures are clearly visible at both the corners and the edge of the Pd NCs as the Bito-Pd molar ratio is 0.5 (Figure 1d and Figure S7a\u2013c). The line-scanning analysis results further demonstrate that Bi is primarily distributed at the corners and edges of the Pd NCs (Figure S7d). Furthermore, the HRTEM images of Pd NCs@Bi1 show that the surface of the PdNCs is entirely covered by Bi when the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio is 1 (Figure 1e and Figure S8a\u2013c). It is further proven through line-scanning analysis that Bi completely covers the Pd NCs, forming core-shell-like structures (Figure S8d). These results clearly prove that the precise deposition of Bi on the Pd NCs in the order of the corners, edges and facets can be achieved by adjusting the Bi concentration. To further clarify the microstructures of Pd NCs@Bi, spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-STEM) was employed. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the bulge-like structures in Pd NCs@Bi0.5 show lattice distances of ca. 2.35 and 1.94 \u00c5, which are attributed to the (400) and (321) planes of the BiPd3 structure (Pmma (51) space group, orthorhombic structure) [26,31]. According to the literature and recent studies by our group, we speculate that the formation of the BiPd3 structure is the result of the interdiffusion of Bi and Pd in the radial direction due to strong interaction [32,33]. More importantly, it can be seen more clearly that the BiPd3 structure is covered by an amorphous phase (Figure 2c). The element mapping confirms that Pd and Bi are evenly dispersed within the bulge-like structures, which is also consistent with the BiPd3 structure, and Bi is also observed on the amorphous phase outside the BiPd3 structure (Figure 2d). Meanwhile, the XPS analysis of \u03b1-Al2O3-supported Pd NCs@Bi0.5 (Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3) shows that Bi2O3 is the dominant structure (Figure S9), which implies that the amorphous phase is Bi2O3. This could be attributed to the easy oxidation of metal Bi in the air [34]. The results above demonstrate that the deposition of Bi on Pd NCs forms a BiPd3 structure, which is subsequently covered by Bi2O3. Hence, the site-specific deposition of Bi can be considered as the selective coverage of Bi2O3 at the predetermined position of the Pd NCs. Additionally, the site-specific deposition of Bi can also be achieved on Pd NCs with a 7 nm size (Figure S10). As displayed in the HRTEM images of Pd7nm NCs@Bi0.5, the bulge-like structures are found at the corners of the 7 nm sized Pd NCs, which is further confirmed by the line-scanning profile (Figure S11).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2335 4 of 11\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 11\nlike structures are found at the corners of the 7 nm sized Pd NCs, which is further confirmed by the line-scanning profile (Figure S11).\nFigure 2.

Catalytic Performance in Acetylene Hydrogenation The selective deposition of Bi on Pd NCs provides the foundation for an in-depth\ncomprehension of the structure-activity relationship of Pd catalysts in acetylene-selective hydrogenation reactions. The Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by a conventional sol immobilization method [35] using \u03b1-Al2O3 as the support. The actual content of Pd in the Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts is approximately 0.2 wt%, determined by ICP-OES (Table S2). Due to the low loading of Pd and Bi in the catalysts, only Al2O3 diffraction peaks were observed in the corresponding XRD patterns (Figure S12). The catalytic performances of Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 in the acetylene hydrogenation were evaluated under the excess ethylene atmosphere, simulating the front-end conditions.\nConsistent with the literature results, the Pd NCs/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits 100% C2H2 conversion and \u2212315% C2H4 selectivity at 70 \u00b0C, indicating an uncontrollable over-hydrogenation capability of the Pd catalysts, accompanied by temperature runaway [36]. The Bi/Al2O3 catalyst shows no catalytic activity for acetylene hydrogenation, which is consistent with our previous report [36]. This means that the precise coverage of Bi on the Pd NCs is the selective poisoning to the active site of Pd NCs [37]. Therefore, increasing the Bi-to-Pd molar ratio could improve the poisoning degree. Herein, the degree of Bi deposition is defined as the poisoning degree. Interestingly, the catalytic performance varied significantly when the poisoning degree changed. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the Pd NCs@Bi0.06/Al2O3 catalyst with poisoning on the corners of the Pd NCs shows 10.1% C2H4 selectivity at 100% C2H2 conversion, which infers a fundamental improvement compared to the catalytic performance of the Pd NCs/Al2O3 catalyst. Importantly, as the poisoning degree increases, the C2H2 conversion gradually decreases, and the C2H4 selectivity increases at the same reaction temperature, which exhibits the typical trade-off between high catalytic activity and selectivity. Figure 3c compares the C2H4 selectivity of all catalysts at the 95% C2H2 conversion. The C2H4 selectivity continues to increase with the increasing poisoning degree. Specifically, when the corners and edges of the Pd NCs are poisoned, the Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3 catalyst achieves the best catalytic performance, namely 99.7% C2H2 conversion and 94.3% C2H4 selectivity at 170 \u00b0C. This result confirms that moderately poisoning the corners and edges while preserving the facet sites of Pd NCs is responsible for the selective acetylene hydrogenation. It is noteworthy that the Pd NCs@Bi1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits only 41.2% C2H2 conversion, even at 170 \u00b0C, due to an\nFigure 2. Microstruct re of Pd NCs@Bi0.5.

Strong hydrogen dissociation ability for Pd catalysts tends to generate excess active hydrogen atoms, which migrate to the subsurface region of Pd to form the \u03b2-PdHx [40]. The \u03b2-PdHx is considered the active species for over-hydrogenation by forming the high coordination Pd sites [41]. As shown in Figure 4b, the H2-TPR test shows the characteristic peak of \u03b2-PdHx at around 65\u00b0C for the Pd NCs/Al2O3 catalyst, while for the Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3 catalyst, such a peak is not observed. The results of DRIFTS and H2-TPR suggest that selectively poisoning the corner and edges of Pd NCs decreases the Pd\u2013Pd coordination number and weakens the hydrogen dissociation ability, thereby inhibiting the formation of the \u03b2-PdHx. Note that the characteristic peak of \u03b2-PdHx is also not observed for Bi/Al2O3, likely due to the absence of a hydrogen dissociation capability.\nThe C2H4-TPD characterization can be used to further investigate the selective poisoning on the ethylene adsorption/desorption behaviors. Figure 4c shows the characteristic peaks at about 50 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C for the Pd NCs/Al2O3 catalyst. The peak at approximately 50 \u00b0C could be attributed to the \u03c0-bonded ethylene, which is weakly adsorbed and benefits the desorption of ethylene. The peak centered around 120 \u00b0C represents the strong di-\u03c3-bonded ethylene, which is unfavorable for desorption and results in the over-hydrogenation of ethylene into ethane [34,42]. For the Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3 catalyst, the peak of di-\u03c3-bonded ethylene is not observed, and only the characteristic peak of \u03c0-bonded ethylene remains. This suggests that it is hard to over-hydrogenate ethylene to ethane over the Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3 catalyst, which is consistent with the result of the catalytic performances (Figure 3a,b). This result is further confirmed by the ethylene hydrogenation experiment (Figure 4d). Due to the weak adsorption of ethylene, the Pd NCs@Bi0.5/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits lower than 5% C2H4 conversion, whereas the C2H4 conversion for Pd NCs/Al2O3 is over 80% in the whole test temperature. These results demonstrate that by precisely controlling the deposition of Bi on specific locations of the Pd NCs to poison the corner and edge sites, a moderate hydrogen dissociation capacity and weak ethylene adsorption could be obtained to achieve the optimal compromise between high catalytic activity and selectivity.\nFigur 4.

The selective deposition of Bi on Pd NCs has be accomplished with 7 nm sized Pd NCs (Figure S11). Accordingly, it is investigated whether the site-specific deposition of Bi on Pd7nm NCs can regulate the catalytic performance of Pd7nm NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts. The Pd7nm NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized using the same method as the Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 catalysts, with 0.2 wt% Pd content, measured by ICP-OES (Table S2). Figure S14 shows that as the degree of the Bi deposition increases, the C2H2 conversion decreases and the C2H4 selectivity increases at the same reaction temperature, which is consistent with the results of Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3. Notably, to achieve the best catalytic performance of Pd7nm NCs@Bi/Al2O3, a higher Bi-to-Pd molar ratio compared to Pd NCs@Bi/Al2O3 is required. This may be attributed to the larger specific surface area of the smaller Pd NCs. The Pd7nm NCs@Bi1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic performance, with 97.8% C2H4 selectivity at 98.2% C2H2 conversion. These results suggest that the effect of the site-specific deposition of Bi on the catalytic performance can be applied to Pd NCs of both 20 nm and 7 nm dimensions. These results can provide insight into the relationship between active sites and catalytic performance and, more importantly, provide ideas for designing catalysts for industrial production. The selective deposition of Bi on Pd NCs of various sizes raises the question of whether it can also be applied to Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) with irregular morphology. To this end, a facile stepwise reduction method was proposed to synthesize the selectively Bi-deposited Pd nanoparticle catalysts (Pd NPs@Bi-based catalysts, Figure S15). According to the ICP-OES analysis, the catalysts contain 0.2 wt% Pd (Table S2). Surprisingly, the Pd NPs@Bi-based catalysts showed an outstanding catalytic performance: 96.4% C2H4 selectivity at 99.9% C2H2 conversion for Pd NPs@Bi1/Al2O3 and 93.8% C2H4 selectivity at 99.7% C2H2 conversion for Pd NPs@Bi0.8/CaCO3 (Figure S16). Moreover, these results also imply that the support could be more irrelevant to the catalytic performance, which facilitates the screening of suitable support for industrial catalysts."

A thermocouple sleeve with an external diameter of 6 mm was inserted into the quartz reactor to detect the real-time temperature of the catalyst bed during the reaction. Therefore, the temperature in the catalytic reaction test represents the real-time temperature of the catalyst bed. The as-prepared catalysts were treated in 10 vol % H2/Ar at 200 \u25e6C for 1 h prior to catalytic experiments. The total flow rate of the reaction gas was set to 60 mL/min, with a space velocity of 120,000 mL h\u22121 g\u22121, and was then pumped into the quartz reactor for on-line detection. The gas products were analyzed by the gas chromatography equipped with an FID detector. Note that the carbon balance was >99% and oligomers production is negligible due to the hydrogen-rich atmosphere and short contact time. The C2H2 conversion and C2H4 selectivity were calculated as:\nC2H2 conversion = [C 2H2]inlet \u2212 [C 2H2]outlet\n[C 2H2]inlet \u00d7100% (1)\nC2H4 selectivity = [C 2H2]inlet \u2212 [C 2H2]outlet \u2212 [C 2H6]outlet\n[C 2H2]inlet \u2212 [C 2H2]outlet \u00d7100% (2)"

            "text": "In summary, the selective deposition of Bi on Pd NCs has been achieved to allow Bi2O3 cover in the priority order from the corners to edges and then to the facets of Pd NCs. Benefitting from the moderate hydrogen dissociation against the formation of hydride and the weak ethylene adsorption, the supported Pd NCs@Bi catalyst with covered corners and edges exhibits 94.3% C2H4 selectivity at 99.7% C2H2 conversion and good long\u2013 term stability for acetylene hydrogenation. By broadening the research perspectives, the selectively Bi-deposited Pd nanoparticle catalysts prepared by a facile stepwise reduction method show >93% C2H4 selectivity at >99% C2H2 conversion. This design strategy offers a distinctive perspective in the precise modulation of the active sites for the rational design of highly selective catalysts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28052335/s1.
