Quark vectors are used to define sequences of subspaces Vp,j of L2(R) which fulfill almost all conditions of a multiresolution analysis. Under some special conditions on the parameters they even satisfy all those properties. Moreover we prove that quarks and quarklets possess modulation matrices which fulfill the perfect reconstruction condition. Furthermore we show the existence of generalized dual quarks and quarklets which are known to be at least compactly supported tempered distributions from S \u2032(R). Finally we also verify that quarks and quarklets can be used to define sequences of subspaces Wp,j of L2(R) that yield non-orthogonal decompositions of L2(R).",

            "text": "In this paper our subjects of interest are B-spline quarks and associated quarklets. We investigate how they fit into the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets. Originally quarkonial decompositions have been introduced by Triebel in [34], see also [9]. The quarks and quarklets we are concerned with in this paper have been constructed in the last decade by Dahlke, Keding and Raasch, see [8]. Later their properties have been studied in detail in [6], [10], [30] and [16]. The quarks are cardinal B-splines that are multiplied with some monomial of degree p \u2208 N0. The associated quarklets are constructed by means of biorthogonal compactly supported Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau spline wavelets, where the primal generators are cardinal B-splines. For the theory of such biorthogonal wavelets we refer to Section 6.A in [5]. Roughly speaking our quarklets \u03c8p are linear combinations of translated cardinal B-splines that are multiplied with some monomial of degree p \u2208 N0. Precise explanations can be found in the Definitions 2.2 and 2.3 below. One important motivation to study quarks and quarklets are some very interesting applications in the context of the numerical treatment of elliptic partial differential equations. Here adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) are well-established tools. The classical h-FEM\nThis work has been supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grants DA360/24-1 and RA2090/3-1.\n\u22c6 : Corresponding author. a: Philipps-Universita\u0308t Marburg, Fachbereich Mathematik und Informatik, Hans-Meerwein Str. 6, Lahnberge, 35043 Marburg, Germany. b: Universita\u0308t Siegen, Department Mathematik, Walter-Flex-Str. 3, 57068 Siegen, Germany.

A combination of both methods is also possible and called hp-FEM. For an overview of FEM we refer to [3], [14] and [29]. There also exist adaptive numerical schemes based on wavelets that are guaranteed to converge with optimal order, see for example [4]. Those strategies can be interpreted as h-methods. Therefore the question arises whether it is possible to design hp-versions of adaptive wavelet schemes. This issue directly leads to our quarklets. Some first results concerning adaptive quarklet methods can be found in [6], [8], [10] and [30]. In the present paper it is our main goal to discover the connections between quarklets and the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets. Some first findings concerning this topic already have been made in [30] and [10]. So it is already known that quark vectors are refinable, see Proposition 3.7. Moreover it was observed that quarks and quarklets are connected via decomposition relations, see Lemma 6.1. Using these results as a starting point in this paper we will see that our quarklets fit into the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets very well. So (beside others) we obtained the following findings.\n(I) Quark vectors can be used to define sequences of subspaces Vp,j of L2(R) which fulfill almost all conditions of a multiresolution analysis. Under some special conditions on the parameters they even have all properties of a multiresolution analysis. Then quark vectors can be interpreted as multiscaling functions with multiplicity p + 1. For the details we refer to Section 3 and Theorem 3.12.\n(II) Quarks and quarklets possess modulation matrices that fulfill the perfect reconstruction condition. For that we refer to Section 4 and Theorem 4.11.\n(III) There exist generalized dual quarks and quarklets which are at least compactly supported tempered distributions from S \u2032(R). Here generalized means that due to the perfect reconstruction property there exists a dual modulation matrix which implies a vector refinement equation that has a distributional solution. We also can give a formula to describe the generalized duals. Moreover under some very special conditions on the parameters it is possible to prove additional smoothness and integrability properties for the duals. More information can be found in Section 5 and Lemma 5.6.\n(IV) Quarks and quarklets can be used to define sequences of subspaces Wp,j of L2(R) that yield non-orthogonal decompositions of L2(R). It is also possible to rewrite the spaces Wp,j by using modified quarklets with additional orthogonality properties to obtain an alternative decomposition of L2(R). For that we refer to Section 6, see Theorem 6.6 and Theorem 6.17.\nThe authors are confident that the findings from this paper also can be used to push forward the research concerning adaptive quarklet approximation. Some of the results of this article seem to allow the conclusion that when it comes to practical applications it is better to work with quarklets that are based on B-splines with odd m \u2208 N. Here m is as in (2.1). Some findings that substantiate this hypothesis can be found in Lemma 3.10. Another outcome of this paper which seems to be valuable for the numerical application of the quarklets is the discovery of the modified quarklets \u03a8\u22c6, see Definition 6.15. Due to their additional orthogonality properties they already have been used to improve the results concerning adaptive quarklet tree approximation at least in the case of Haar quarklets, namely m = 1, see [7].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a precise definition of the quarks and quarklets. In Section 3 we show how the quarks can be used to construct a\nmultiresolution analysis. Section 4 explains how quarks and quarklets fit into the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets. Here we prove that quarks and quarklets fulfill the perfect reconstruction condition. In the course of Section 5 we prove the existence of generalized dual quarks and quarklets. Moreover we collect some elementary properties of them. Finally in Section 6 we illustrate how quarklets can be used to find a (non-orthogonal) decomposition of L2(R). Furthermore we describe a method to orthogonalize the quarklets.\nFirst of all we fix some notation. As usual N denotes the natural numbers, N0 the natural numbers including 0, Z the integers, R the real numbers and C the complex numbers. Let S(R) be the collection of all Schwartz functions on R endowed with the usual topology and denote by S \u2032(R) its topological dual, namely the space of all bounded linear functionals on S(R) endowed with the weak \u2217-topology. For 0 < r \u2264 \u221e by Lr(R) we denote the usual Lebesgue spaces. Given a function f \u2208 Lr(R) we use the symbol \u2016f |Lr(R)\u2016 for the associated quasi-norm. For f \u2208 L1(R) we define its Fourier transform via\n(Ff)(\u03be) := 1\u221a 2\u03c0\n\u222b\nR\nf(x)e\u2212ix\u03bedx.\nThe symbol F\u22121 refers to the inverse transform. Recall that both F and F\u22121 also can be defined on S \u2032(R). For f, g \u2208 L2(R) we define the inner product\n\u3008f, g\u3009L2(R) := \u222b\nR\nf(x)g(x)dx.\nGiven a set of functions G \u2282 L2(R) by G we mean the L2\u2212closure of G. For a finite set of functions f1, . . . , fn \u2208 L2(R) their closed linear span\nV = span {fl(\u00b7 \u2212 k) : 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n, k \u2208 Z} \u2282 L2(R)\nis defined by\nV = {\nn \u2211\nl=1\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nal(k)fl(\u00b7 \u2212 k) : al \u2208 l0(Z) } . (1.1)\nThereby l0(Z) is the space of all sequences that have only finitely many nonzero elements. If a function f is at least n-times differentiable, then we denote the n-th derivative by f (n). The symbols C,C1, c, c1 . . . denote constants that depend only on the fixed parameters. Unless otherwise stated their values may vary from line to line. When we write a \u223c b we mean that there are constants 0 < C1 \u2264 C2 <\u221e such that a \u2264 C1b \u2264 C2a."

            "text": "In this section we present a precise definition of quarks and quarklets. For that purpose in a first step we recall the definition of cardinal B-splines. Cardinal B-splines are defined recursively by N1 := \u03c7[0,1) and for m \u2208 N with m > 1 by\nNm := Nm\u22121 \u2217N1 = \u222b 1\n0 Nm\u22121(\u00b7 \u2212 t)dt. (2.1)\nThose functions possess some very nice properties. They are collected in the following lemma.\nLemma 2.1. Let m \u2208 N and x \u2208 R. Then for the cardinal B-splines the following properties hold.\n(i) We can write Nm(x) = 1\n(m\u22121)! \u2211m k=0(\u22121)k\n(\nm k\n)\nmax{0, (x \u2212 k)}m\u22121.\n(ii) For m \u2265 2 the recursion formula Nm(x) = xm\u22121Nm\u22121(x) + m\u2212xm\u22121Nm\u22121(x\u2212 1) holds.\n(iii) For m \u2265 3 the derivatives satisfy N \u2032m(x) = Nm\u22121(x)\u2212Nm\u22121(x\u2212 1).\n(iv) The B-splines are compactly supported with suppNm = [0,m].\n(v) We have \u2211 k\u2208ZNm(x\u2212 k) = 1.\n(vi) The cardinal B-splines are refinable with Nm(x) = \u2211m k=0 2 1\u2212m\n(\nm k\n)\nNm(2x\u2212 k).\nThose properties are well-known. Let us refer to [11], see Chapters 5.2 and 5.3. One can also consult [2] and Section IX in [1]. In what follows for fixedm \u2208 N we will work with the symmetrized cardinal B-spline \u03d5(x) := Nm(x+ \u230am2 \u230b). We observe supp\u03d5 = [\u2212\u230am2 \u230b, \u2308m2 \u2309]. The symmetrized cardinal B-spline shows up in the following definition where we explain the so-called quarks.\nDefinition 2.2. Let m \u2208 N and p \u2208 N0. Then the p-th cardinal B-spline quark \u03d5p is defined by\n\u03d5p(x) := ( x \u2308m2 \u2309 )p Nm ( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b ) . (2.2)\nThe quarks will be very important for us in order to define the quarklets. Their properties have been studied in [8].\nIt is shown in [5] by Cohen, Daubechies and Feauveau, that for a given m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 \u2265 m and m+ m\u0303 \u2208 2N there exists a compactly supported spline wavelet \u03c8 (sometimes called CDF-wavelet) with\n\u03c8 = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nbk\u03d5(2 \u00b7 \u2212k) (2.3)\nwith expansion coefficients bk \u2208 R. Only finitely many of them are not zero. Moreover \u03c8 has m\u0303 vanishing moments and the system\n{ \u03d5(\u00b7 \u2212 k) : k \u2208 Z } \u222a { 2 j 2\u03c8(2j \u00b7 \u2212k) : j \u2208 N0 , k \u2208 Z }\nis a Riesz basis for L2(R). To construct such a \u03c8 we have to work with a compactly supported dual generator \u03d5\u0303 associated to the primal generator \u03d5 that fulfills\n\u3008\u03d5, \u03d5\u0303(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\u3009L2(R) = \u03b40,k, k \u2208 Z. (2.4)\nConnected with that it is possible to construct another compactly supported wavelet \u03c8\u0303 \u2208 L2(R) with\n\u03c8\u0303 = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nb\u0303k\u03d5\u0303(2 \u00b7 \u2212k). (2.5)\nHere only finitely many of the b\u0303k \u2208 R are not zero. Moreover \u03c8\u0303 has m \u2208 N vanishing moments. For j \u2208 N0 and k \u2208 Z let us write\n\u03c8j,k = 2 j 2\u03c8(2j \u00b7 \u2212k) and \u03c8\u0303j,k = 2 j 2 \u03c8\u0303(2j \u00b7 \u2212k). (2.6)\nFor k \u2208 Z we put \u03c8\u22121,k = \u03d5(\u00b7 \u2212 k) and \u03c8\u0303\u22121,k = \u03d5\u0303(\u00b7 \u2212 k). Then both function systems are biorthogonal in the following sense\n\u3008\u03c8j,k, \u03c8\u0303j\u2032,k\u2032\u3009L2(R) = \u03b4j,j\u2032\u03b4k,k\u2032 , j, j\u2032 \u2208 N0, k, k\u2032 \u2208 Z. (2.7)\nFurthermore for each f \u2208 L2(R) we have\nf = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u3008f, \u03c8\u0303\u22121,k\u3009L2(R)\u03c8\u22121,k + \u2211\nj\u2208N0,k\u2208Z\n\u3008f, \u03c8\u0303j,k\u3009L2(R)\u03c8j,k\n= \u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u3008f, \u03c8\u22121,k\u3009L2(R)\u03c8\u0303\u22121,k + \u2211\nj\u2208N0,k\u2208Z\n\u3008f, \u03c8j,k\u3009L2(R)\u03c8\u0303j,k (2.8)\nwith convergence in L2(R). For details and proofs concerning the above construction we refer to Section 6.A in [5]. Now we can use the CDF-wavelets \u03c8 to define the quarklets.\nDefinition 2.3. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m+ m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Then the p-th quarklet \u03c8p is defined by\n\u03c8p := \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nbk\u03d5p(2 \u00b7 \u2212k). (2.9)\nHere the bk are the same as in (2.3).\nIt can be shown that the quarks and quarklets inherit some important properties of the B-splines and B-spline wavelets, respectively. In particular Jackson and Bernstein estimates can be proved and the quarklets possess the same amount of vanishing moments. For details concerning this topic we refer to [8]."

            "text": "It is one of the main goals of this paper to investigate how the quarks and quarklets are connected with the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets. For that purpose in a first step we deal with the quark vector\n\u03a6 := (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T (3.1)\nwith p \u2208 N0, where the quarks are as in Definition 2.2. We want to find out whether \u03a6 can be used to construct a multiresolution analysis. Let us start with recalling the definition of L2\u2212stability for function vectors.\nDefinition 3.1. Let F = (f1, . . . , fn) T \u2208 (L2(R))n be a function vector. Then we say that F is L2\u2212stable, if there are constants 0 < C1 \u2264 C2 <\u221e such that\nC1\n\u221e \u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nvTk vk \u2264 \u2225 \u2225 \u2225\n\u221e \u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nvTk F (\u00b7 \u2212 k) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 L2(R) \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 2 \u2264 C2\n\u221e \u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nvTk vk\nholds for any vector sequence {vk}k\u2208Z \u2208 l2(Z)n. Here l2(Z)n denotes the set of sequences of vectors vk \u2208 Cn with \u2211\u221e k=\u2212\u221e v T k vk <\u221e.\nThere exist several possibilities to equivalently describe the L2\u2212stability from Definition 3.1. One of them is given in the following result.\nLemma 3.2. Let f1, . . . , fn \u2208 L2(R) be compactly supported. Then the integer translates of f1, . . . , fn are L2\u2212stable if and only if for any \u03be \u2208 R the sequences ((Ffl)(\u03be+2\u03c0\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208Z with l = 1, . . . , n are linearly independent.\nThis result can be found in [19], see Theorem 4.1. Let us also refer to Section 1.2 in [27]. When we deal with a single function Lemma 3.2 becomes easier. Indeed in that case we observe the following.\nLemma 3.3. Let f \u2208 L2(R) be compactly supported. Then the integer translates of f are L2\u2212stable if and only if for all \u03be \u2208 R we have\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208Z\n|(Ff)(\u03be + 2\u03c0\u03b1)|2 > 0.\nThis result can be found in [19], see Theorem 3.3. Let us mention that if f \u2208 L2(R) is compactly supported, then we have f \u2208 L2(R), see the remark before Theorem 2.1 in [19] for a definition and explanations. Now we are well prepared to recall what a multiresolution analysis in the context of multiwavelets is, see also Definition 6.10 in [23].\nDefinition 3.4. Let {Vj}j\u2208Z be a sequence of closed subspaces of L2(R). Then this sequence is called a multiresolution analysis (MRA) if the following properties are fulfilled.\n(i) For all j \u2208 Z we have Vj \u2282 Vj+1.\n(ii) It is \u22c3\nj\u2208Z Vj = L2(R).\n(iii) It is \u22c2 j\u2208Z Vj = {0}.\n(iv) We have f \u2208 Vj if and only if f(\u00b7 \u2212 2\u2212jk) \u2208 Vj for all j, k \u2208 Z.\n(v) We have f \u2208 Vj if and only if f(2\u00b7) \u2208 Vj+1 for all j \u2208 Z.\n(vi) For some r \u2208 N there exists an L2\u2212stable function vector G = (g1, . . . , gr)T that consists of r functions of L2(R) such that V0 = span {gl(\u00b7 \u2212 k), l \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, k \u2208 Z}. The vector G is called multiscaling function of multiplicity r.\nTo incorporate the quarks into the setting of multiresolution analyses let us define the following subspaces of L2(R). Here we follow [8] and [30].\nDefinition 3.5. Let j \u2208 Z and p \u2208 N0. Then we define the spaces\nVp,j := span {2 j 2\u03d5q(2j \u00b7 \u2212k) : 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p, k \u2208 Z} \u2282 L2(R).\nHere the functions \u03d5q are the quarks from Definition 2.2.\nRemark 3.6. It is well-known that the sequence {V0,j}j\u2208Z is a multiresolution analysis in the sense of Definition 3.4 with multiplicity r = 1. For that we refer to [5], see in particular Section 6.A.\nNow let p \u2208 N0. In what follows we want to investigate whether the sequences {Vp,j}j\u2208Z form multiresolution analyses in the sense of Definition 3.4. For that purpose we examine whether the properties listed in Definition 3.4 are fulfilled step by step. Initially let us recall that the cardinal B-spline quarks are refinable in the following sense.\nProposition 3.7. Let m \u2208 N and p \u2208 N0. Then the quark vector (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T is refinable. More precisely there exist (p+1)\u00d7 (p+1) refinement matrices Ak such that for all x \u2208 R the two-scale matrix refinement equation\n\n  \u03d50(x) ...\n\u03d5p(x)\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nAk\n\n  \u03d50(2x\u2212 k) ...\n\u03d5p(2x\u2212 k)\n\n  (3.2)\nholds. The matrices Ak are given by\n(Ak)q,l := 1\n2q\u22121\n( \u2308m 2 \u2309 )l\u2212q ak\n(\nq \u2212 1 l \u2212 1\n)\nkq\u2212l with q, l \u2208 {1, . . . , p + 1}.\nHere for k \u2208 Z with \u2212\u230am2 \u230b \u2264 k \u2264 \u2308m2 \u2309 it is\nak = 2 1\u2212m\n(\nm\nk + \u230am2 \u230b\n)\n.\nThis result can be found in [8], see Proposition 5. Now we are well-prepared to formulate the first main result of this section. It tells us that the spaces Vp,j from Definition 3.5 fulfill most of the properties which can be found in Definition 3.4.\nTheorem 3.8. Let m \u2208 N and p \u2208 N0. Then the sequence {Vp,j}j\u2208Z of spaces from Definition 3.5 fulfills the properties (i)-(v) from Definition 3.4.\nProof. Step 1. At first we prove that property (i) from Definition 3.4 is fulfilled. More precisely we show that for all j \u2208 Z we have Vp,j \u2282 Vp,j+1. However this is a simple consequence of Proposition 3.7 and follows from formula (3.2) by standard arguments.\nStep 2. Next we verify that the properties (iv) and (v) from Definition 3.4 are fulfilled. Obviously they are direct consequences of the definition of the spaces Vp,j, see Definition 3.5.\nStep 3. Now we prove that property (ii) from Definition 3.4 is fulfilled. With other words we show that it holds \u22c3\nj\u2208Z Vp,j = L2(R). The proof is based on the fact that {V0,j}j\u2208Z is a multiresolution analysis, see Remark 3.6. Let us start with the obvious observation \u22c3\nj\u2208Z Vp,j \u2282 L2(R). Therefore it remains to prove \u22c3 j\u2208Z Vp,j \u2283 L2(R). Definition 3.5 implies \u22c3\nj\u2208Z Vp,j \u2283 \u22c3 j\u2208Z V0,j . Moreover we know that the sequence {V0,j}j\u2208Z is a multiresolution analysis, see Remark 3.6. Consequently we get\n\u22c3\nj\u2208Z\nVp,j \u2283 \u22c3\nj\u2208Z\nV0,j = L2(R).\nHence this step of the proof is complete. Let us remark that property (ii) from Definition 3.4 also can be proved by using Theorem 11.22 from [23].\nStep 4. To complete the proof we show that property (iii) from Definition 3.4 holds. That means we verify \u22c2\nj\u2208Z Vp,j = {0}. For that purpose we observe that our spaces Vp,j fit into the theory developed in [20]. So the desired result follows directly from Theorem 2.2 in [20]. The spaces Vp,0 are the smallest closed shift-invariant subspaces of L2(R) that are containing \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T , see Definition 3.5. Moreover \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T is a finite set of functions from L2(R) that generates Vp,0. Furthermore the spaces Vp,j are the 2j\u2212dilates of Vp,0. Consequently Theorem 2.2 from [20] can be applied and the result follows. Finally let us mention that there exists an alternative method to prove property (iii) from Definition 3.4 which is based on Theorem 11.23 from [23].\nIt remains to investigate whether the spaces Vp,j satisfy property (vi) from Definition 3.4. For that purpose we have to examine the L2\u2212stability of the quark vectors \u03a6. To this end taking into account Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3 we require the Fourier transforms of the quarks.\nLemma 3.9. Let m \u2208 N and l \u2208 N0. Then for all \u03be \u2208 R the Fourier transforms of the quarks are given by\n(F\u03d5l)(\u03be) = il(2\u03c0) m 2\n(\nei(\u230a m 2 \u230b\u2212m 2 )\u03be (sin( \u03be2)\n\u03be 2\n)m)(l) .\nProof. To prove this result we calculate\n(F\u03d5l)(\u03be) = F (( x \u2308m2 \u2309 )l Nm ( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b )) (\u03be)\n= 1 \u2308m2 \u2309l F ( xlNm ( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b )) (\u03be) = il 1\n\u2308m2 \u2309l ( F [ Nm ( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b )] (\u03be) )(l)\n= il 1 \u2308m2 \u2309l ( ei\u230a m 2 \u230b\u03be(FNm)(\u03be) )(l)\n= il(2\u03c0) m 2\n1 \u2308m2 \u2309l ( ei\u230a m 2 \u230b\u03be[(FN1)(\u03be)]m )(l) .\nThe Fourier transform of N1 := \u03c7[0,1) is well-known. We find\n(F\u03d5l)(\u03be) = il(2\u03c0) m 2\n(\nei(\u230a m 2 \u230b\u2212m 2 )\u03be (sin( \u03be2)\n\u03be 2\n)m)(l) .\nThe proof is complete.\nFirst of all we study the L2\u2212stability of individual quarks. Then we observe the following.\nLemma 3.10. Let m \u2208 N and p \u2208 N0. The quarks \u03d5p are as in Definition 2.2.\n(i) Then concerning L2\u2212stability of the integer translates we observe the following.\np = 0 p = 1 p = 2 p = 3\nm = 1 stable stable stable stable m = 2 stable unstable stable stable m = 3 stable stable stable stable m = 4 stable unstable stable unstable\n(ii) Let m \u2208 N and p = 0. Then the integer translates of \u03d50 are L2\u2212stable.\n(iii) Let m \u2208 N be odd and p = 1. Then the integer translates of \u03d51 are L2\u2212stable.\n(iv) Let m \u2208 2N and p = 1. Then the integer translates of \u03d51 are not L2\u2212stable.\nThis result can be proved by using Lemma 3.9 and Lemma 3.3. With other words we have to compute the zeros of the Fourier transforms of the quarks. Since this business is quite technical we postpone the details and present them in the Appendix Section 7. Now we continue by investigating the L2\u2212stability of quark vectors \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T .\nLemma 3.11. Let p \u2208 N0 and m \u2208 N. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T .\n(i) Let p = 0. Then \u03a6 is L2\u2212stable.\n(ii) Let m = 1 (Haar case) and p \u2208 N0. Then \u03a6 is L2\u2212stable.\n(iii) Let m > 1 and p > 0. Then \u03a6 is not L2\u2212stable.\nProof. To prove this result we use Lemma 3.2. Moreover we apply some findings from Lemma 3.10.\nStep 1. At first we prove (i). Since here we only work with a single function this directly follows from Lemma 3.10.\nStep 2. Now we prove (ii). For that purpose we use Theorem 5.1 from [19]. Let l(Z) be the linear space of all sequences. For all sequences \u03bb0, . . . , \u03bbp \u2208 l(Z) we define the linear mapping\nL\u03d50,\u03d51,...,\u03d5p : (\u03bb 0, . . . , \u03bbp) 7\u2192\np \u2211\nl=0\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u03bblk\u03d5l(\u00b7 \u2212 k).\nTheorem 5.1 in [19] implies that if L\u03d50,\u03d51,...,\u03d5p is injective, then for all \u03be \u2208 R the sequences ((F\u03d5l)(\u03be + 2\u03c0\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208Z with l = 0, . . . , p are linearly independent. Then the L2\u2212stability follows from Lemma 3.2. Now because of m = 1 we have \u03d5l(x) = x l\u03c7[0,1)(x). Therefore we also find \u03d5l(x\u2212k) = (x\u2212k)l\u03c7[k,k+1)(x). Consequently when we want to know whether L\u03d50,\u03d51,...,\u03d5p is injective, it is enough to look at a fixed k \u2208 Z. For example we can work with k = 0. Let p \u2208 N. The mapping\nL\u2217\u03d50,...,\u03d5p : (\u03bb 0 0, . . . , \u03bb p 0) 7\u2192\np \u2211\nl=0\n\u03bbl0x l\u03c7[0,1)(x)\nis injective because of the different polynomial degrees for each l \u2208 {0, . . . , p}. Therefore we can use Theorem 5.1 in [19] and Lemma 3.2 to complete this step of the proof.\nStep 3. Now we prove (iii) for even m. Here we use Lemma 3.2. We show that there exists \u03be \u2208 R such that the sequences ((F\u03d5l)(\u03be+2\u03c0\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208Z with l = 0, . . . , p are not linearly independent. In each case we find that ((F\u03d51)(2\u03c0\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208Z is a vector that only contains zeros. So the result follows from Lemma 3.2.\nStep 4. Next we prove (iii) for m \u2208 N odd with m \u2265 3 and p > 0. For the proof we use a generalization of the Strang-Fix conditions, see Theorem 4.2 in [18] and its proof. Of course the cardinal B-spline Nm is compactly supported and refinable, see Lemma 2.1. Moreover for m \u2265 3 it belongs to the Sobolev space W 11 (R). It is (FNm)(0) 6= 0, see Lemma 3.9. Consequently Theorem 4.2 from [18] and the observation in its proof can be applied. With other words we have (F\u03d50)(t)(2\u03c0k) = 0 for t \u2208 {0, 1} and k \u2208 Z \\ {0}. Therefore for t = 0 the sequence\n(. . . , (F\u03d50)(\u22124\u03c0), (F\u03d50)(\u22122\u03c0), (F\u03d50)(0), (F\u03d50)(2\u03c0), (F\u03d50)(4\u03c0), . . .) (3.3)\nhas the form (. . . , 0, 0, c0,m, 0, 0, . . .). For t = 1 we calculate\n0 = ( F (\nNm\n( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b )))(1) (2\u03c0k)\n= \u2212i\u2308m 2 \u2309 ( F ( x\n\u2308m2 \u2309 Nm\n( x+ \u230am 2 \u230b ))) (2\u03c0k)\n= \u2212i\u2308m 2 \u2309(F\u03d51)(2\u03c0k)\nwith k \u2208 Z \\ {0}. Hence the sequence\n(. . . , (F\u03d51)(\u22124\u03c0), (F\u03d51)(\u22122\u03c0), (F\u03d51)(0), (F\u03d51)(2\u03c0), (F\u03d51)(4\u03c0), . . .) (3.4)\nhas the form (. . . , 0, 0, c1,m, 0, 0, . . .). Combining (3.3) and (3.4) an application of Lemma 3.2 yields that the integer translates of \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51)\nT are not L2\u2212stable. Therefore the claim follows.\nNow we summarize our previous findings by the following theorem. It is the main result of this section.\nTheorem 3.12. Let m \u2208 N and p \u2208 N0. The sequence {Vp,j}j\u2208Z of spaces from Definition 3.5 fulfills the properties (i)-(v) from Definition 3.4. Let in addition either m = 1 or p = 0. Then the sequence {Vp,j}j\u2208Z is a multiresolution analysis according to Definition 3.4 with a multiscaling function of multiplicity p+ 1.\nProof. This result follows from Theorem 3.8 and Lemma 3.11."

            "heading": "4 The Perfect Reconstruction Property",
            "text": "One of the goals of this paper is to identify suitable dual quarks and quarklets. To this end in what follows we show that the quarks \u03a6 and the quarklets\n\u03a8 := (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T (4.1)\nsatisfy the so-called perfect reconstruction property. To see this at first let us recall some basic concepts concerning the theory of multiwavelets. The starting point of the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets is the existence of a refinable function vector F = (f1, f2, . . . , fN )\nT \u2208 (L2(R))N with N \u2208 N. Recall that this vector is called refinable if for \u2212\u221e < k0 \u2264 k1 < \u221e there exists a sequence of matrices {Ak}k1k=k0 such that for all x \u2208 R we have\n\n  f1(x) ...\nfN(x)\n\n  =\nk1 \u2211\nk=k0\nAk\n\n  f1(2x\u2212 k) ...\nfN (2x\u2212 k)\n\n  . (4.2)\nBy applying the Fourier transform we obtain \n  (Ff1)(\u03be) ...\n(FfN )(\u03be)\n\n  =\n1\n2\nk1 \u2211\nk=k0\nAke \u2212ik \u03be 2\n\n  (Ff1)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(FfN )( \u03be2 )\n\n  . (4.3)\nWe put z = e\u2212i \u03be 2 and define the symbol matrix of F via\nA(z) := 1 2\nk1 \u2211\nk=k0\nAkz k. (4.4)\nThen (4.3) can be rewritten as \n  (Ff1)(\u03be) ...\n(FfN )(\u03be)\n\n  = A(z)\n\n  (Ff1)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(FfN )( \u03be2 )\n\n  . (4.5)\nA key issue of the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets is the search for a second refinable function vector F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )\nT \u2208 (L2(R))N which is biorthogonal (or dual) to F in the following sense.\nDefinition 4.1. Let F = (f1, f2, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N and F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )T \u2208 (L2(R)) N be two function vectors. Then they are called biorthogonal if for all k \u2208 Z\n( \u3008fi(\u00b7), f\u0303j(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\u3009L2(R) )\ni=1,...,N ;j=1,...,N = \u03b40,kIdN . (4.6)\nHere IdN is the identity matrix of size N \u00d7N .\nFor \u2212\u221e < k2 \u2264 k3 < \u221e the refinability of F\u0303 yields the existence of a sequence of matrices {A\u0303k}k3k=k2 such that for all x \u2208 R we have\n\n  f\u03031(x) ...\nf\u0303N(x)\n\n  =\nk3 \u2211\nk=k2\nA\u0303k\n\n  f\u03031(2x\u2212 k) ...\nf\u0303N (2x\u2212 k)\n\n  . (4.7)\nAgain we can define the symbol matrix via\nA\u0303(z) := 1 2\nk3 \u2211\nk=k2\nA\u0303kz k. (4.8)\nConsequently (4.7) can be rewritten as\n\n  (F f\u03031)(\u03be) ...\n(F f\u0303N )(\u03be)\n\n  = A\u0303(z)\n\n  (F f\u03031)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F f\u0303N )( \u03be2 )\n\n  . (4.9)\nThe biorthogonality of F and F\u0303 yields an interesting connection between the symbols A(z) and A\u0303(z) which finally leads to the perfect reconstruction condition. It is given in the following well-known result, see Theorem 1 in [35].\nLemma 4.2. Let F = (f1, f2, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N with N \u2208 N be a function vector such that (4.2) is fulfilled. Let F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N be a second function vector such that (4.7) holds. For z = e\u2212i \u03be\n2 we define the symbols A(z) and A\u0303(z) via (4.4) and (4.8). If F and F\u0303 are biorthogonal, then we have\nA(z)A\u0303(z) T +A(\u2212z)A\u0303(\u2212z) T\n= IdN . (4.10)\nFor a given function vector F a popular method to find a biorthogonal vector F\u0303 is to look for a matrix A\u0303(z) such that (4.10) holds. For details concerning this topic we refer to [31] and [32]. Now let us turn to the quarks. We already know that the quark vector \u03a6 is refinable, see Proposition 3.7. Therefore the question arises whether there exists a dual vector \u03a6\u0303 such that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are biorthogonal. However it turns out that in many cases there cannot exist a vector \u03a6\u0303 consisting of L2(R) functions such that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are biorthogonal in the L2\u2212sense. So there is the following result. Theorem 4.3. Let m > 1 and p > 0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)\nT be the quark vector. Then there does not exist any function vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p)\nT \u2208 (L2(R))p+1 such that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are biorthogonal in the sense of Definition 4.1.\nProof. To prove this result we use Lemma 11.21 from [23]. It tells us that if \u03a6, \u03a6\u0303 \u2208 (L2(R))\np+1 are biorthogonal, they have stable shifts. However in Lemma 3.11 we learned that if m and p are as in Theorem 4.3, the quark vector \u03a6 is not L2\u2212stable.\nIn what follows we have two goals. On the one hand we want to find out whether in the remaining case m = 1 and p \u2208 N0 which is not covered by Theorem 4.3 there exists a vector \u03a6\u0303 consisting of L2(R) functions such that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are biorthogonal. On the other hand we intend to investigate whether for arbitrary m and p there exists a vector \u03a6\u0303 that is dual to \u03a6 in a more general way. We already mentioned that one possible way to answer such questions is to look for a matrix A\u0303(z) such that (4.10) is fulfilled. Before we start with this we have to incorporate the quarklets \u03a8 into our considerations. For that purpose we have to extend our definition of biorthogonality.\nDefinition 4.4. We call F = (f1, f2, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N and F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )T \u2208 (L2(R)) N a pair of biorthogonal function vectors if for all k \u2208 Z the equation (4.6) holds. Moreover W = (w1, w2, . . . , wN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N and W\u0303 = (w\u03031, w\u03032, . . . , w\u0303N )T \u2208 (L2(R))N will be said to be a pair of biorthogonal function vectors associated with F and F\u0303 , if for all k \u2208 Z we have\n( \u3008fi(\u00b7), w\u0303j(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\u3009L2(R) )\ni=1,...,N ;j=1,...,N = 0N\nand (\n\u3008wi(\u00b7), f\u0303j(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\u3009L2(R) )\ni=1,...,N ;j=1,...,N = 0N\nand (\n\u3008wi(\u00b7), w\u0303j(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\u3009L2(R) )\ni=1,...,N ;j=1,...,N = \u03b40,kIdN .\nHere 0N is the zero matrix.\nOf course Definition 4.4 is an extension of Definition 4.1. So similar as in Lemma 4.2 biorthogonality yields an interesting property concerning the corresponding symbol matrices which can be found in the following lemma.\nLemma 4.5. Let F = (f1, f2, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N and F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )T \u2208 (L2(R)) N be a pair of compactly supported biorthogonal multiscaling functions that satisfy (4.2) and (4.7). The matrices A(z) and A\u0303(z) are given by (4.4) and (4.8). Moreover let W = (w1, w2, . . . , wN )\nT \u2208 (L2(R))N and W\u0303 = (w\u03031, w\u03032, . . . , w\u0303N )T \u2208 (L2(R))N be a pair of biorthogonal multiwavelets associated with the multiscaling functions F and F\u0303 . We have\n\n  w1(x) ...\nwN (x)\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nBk\n\n  f1(2x\u2212 k) ...\nfN (2x\u2212 k)\n\n \nand \n  w\u03031(x) ...\nw\u0303N (x)\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nB\u0303k\n\n  f\u03031(2x\u2212 k) ...\nf\u0303N(2x\u2212 k)\n\n  .\nWe put\nB(z) = 1 2 \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nBkz k and B\u0303(z) = 1\n2\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nB\u0303kz k. (4.11)\nThen for all z \u2208 C with |z| = 1 we have\nX(z)X\u0303(z) T :=\n(\nA(z) A(\u2212z) B(z) B(\u2212z)\n)\n\n\nA\u0303(z) T\nB\u0303(z) T\nA\u0303(\u2212z) T B\u0303(\u2212z) T\n\n = Id2N . (4.12)\nProof. This result can be found in [35], see Theorem 1. Here we also can refer to (1.2) in [12] or to formula (7.10) in [23].\nThe matrices X(z) and X\u0303(z) T\nfrom Lemma 4.5 are called modulation matrices. The equation (4.12) describes the so-called perfect reconstruction property which is essential in the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets, see [23], [31] and [32]. Therefore in what follows we investigate whether for the quarks and quarklets the condition of perfect reconstruction is fulfilled. Once we have found a matrix X\u0303(z) for the quarks and quarklets it can be used to look for duals. Let us start with writing down the matrix X(z) for our case.\nLemma 4.6. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Then the matrix\nX(z) :=\n(\nA(z) A(\u2212z) B(z) B(\u2212z)\n)\nfrom Lemma 4.5 has the form\nX(z) =\n(\n1 2\n\u2211\nk\u2208ZAkz k 1 2\n\u2211\nk\u2208ZAk(\u2212z)k b(z)Idp+1 b(\u2212z)Idp+1\n)\n.\nHere the Ak are the same as in Proposition 3.7. It is b(z) := 1 2\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z bkz k, where the bk\nare the same as in Definition 2.3.\nProof. The shape of the upper part of the matrix follows from (4.4) and Proposition 3.7. For the lower part recall that B(z) is given by (4.11) with matrices {Bk}k\u2208Z defined via\n\n  \u03c80(x) ...\n\u03c8p(x)\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nBk\n\n  \u03d50(2x\u2212 k) ...\n\u03d5p(2x\u2212 k)\n\n  .\nFrom Definition 2.3 we know\n\u03c8p = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nbk\u03d5p(2 \u00b7 \u2212k).\nConsequently we find Bk = bkIdp+1.\nExample 4.7. Let m = m\u0303 = 1 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81) T . Then we have\nX(z) =\n\n  \n1 2 + 1 2z 0\n1 2 \u2212 12z 0\n1 4z\n1 4 + 1 4z \u221214z 14 \u2212 14z\n1 2 \u2212 12z 0 12 + 12z 0\n0 12 \u2212 12z 0 12 + 12z\n\n   .\nIt is already known that for the quarks and quarklets the modulation matrix X(z) is invertible. There is the following result, see Proposition 4.14 in [30].\nLemma 4.8. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . For z \u2208 C with |z| = 1 we define T (z) := A(z)b(\u2212z) \u2212 b(z)A(\u2212z). Then T (z)\u22121 exists and the matrix X(z) from Lemma 4.6 is invertible with\nX(z)\u22121 =\n(\nb(\u2212z)T (z)\u22121 \u2212T (z)\u22121A(\u2212z) \u2212b(z)T (z)\u22121 T (z)\u22121A(z)\n)\n.\nHere we also can refer to [10], where a slightly different notation was used.\nExample 4.9. Let m = m\u0303 = 1 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81) T . Then the matrix X(z) is given in Example 4.7. For the inverse matrix X(z)\u22121 we obtain\nX(z)\u22121 = 1\n2\n\n   z\u22121 + 1 0 \u2212z\u22121 + 1 0 \u221212z\u22121 \u2212 12 2z\u22121 + 2 12z\u22121 + 12 \u2212z\u22121 + 1 \u2212z\u22121 + 1 0 z\u22121 + 1 0 1 2z \u22121 \u2212 12 \u22122z\u22121 + 2 \u221212z\u22121 + 12 z\u22121 + 1\n\n   .\nIn what follows we will prove that the matrix X(z)\u22121 can be interpreted as dual modulation matrix X\u0303(z), see (4.12). For that purpose we need some preparations.\nLemma 4.10. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Let z \u2208 C with |z| = 1. We use the notation from Lemma 4.8. Then the following assertions are true.\n(i) The matrix T (z) is of lower triangular shape. It only consists of Laurent polynomials and fulfills T (\u2212z) = \u2212T (z).\n(ii) The matrix T (z)\u22121 is of lower triangular shape. It only consists of Laurent polynomials and fulfills T (\u2212z)\u22121 = \u2212T (z)\u22121.\n(iii) It is b(z)T (\u2212z)\u22121 = \u2212b(z)T (z)\u22121 and \u2212T (\u2212z)\u22121A(z) = T (z)\u22121A(z).\nProof. Step 1. At first we prove (i). The lower triangular shape of T (z) has already been observed in [30], see the proof of Proposition 4.14. It is clear that both A(z) and b(z) only consist of Laurent polynomials. Concerning the last statement we observe\n\u2212T (z) = \u2212[A(z)b(\u2212z) \u2212 b(z)A(\u2212z)] = A(\u2212z)b(z) \u2212 b(\u2212z)A(z) = T (\u2212z).\nTherefore the claim follows. Step 2. Now we prove (ii). The fact that T (z)\u22121 is of lower triangular shape follows from the lower triangular shape of T (z). It already has been observed in the Appendix of [10] that T (z)\u22121 only consists of Laurent polynomials. Moreover we can use (i) to find\nT (\u2212z)\u22121 = [\u2212T (z)]\u22121 = (\u22121)\u22121T (z)\u22121 = \u2212T (z)\u22121.\nSo the proof of (ii) is complete. Step 3. Now we prove (iii). For that purpose at first we observe b(z)T (\u2212z)\u22121 = \u2212b(z)T (z)\u22121. This directly follows from (ii). So we have proved the first part of the assertion. To continue we have to show \u2212T (\u2212z)\u22121A(z) = T (z)\u22121A(z). Let us write T (\u2212z)\u22121A(z) = D(z). Then the entry di,j(z) of D(z) has the form\ndi,j(z) =\np+1 \u2211\nk=1\n(T (\u2212z)\u22121)i,k(A(z))k,j = \u2212 p+1 \u2211\nk=1\n(T (z)\u22121)i,k(A(z))k,j .\nHere we also used (ii). Consequently we can conclude\n\u2212T (\u2212z)\u22121A(z) = T (z)\u22121A(z).\nThe proof is complete.\nNow we are well-prepared to show that quarks and quarklets fulfill the perfect reconstruction condition.\nTheorem 4.11. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Let z \u2208 C with |z| = 1. Let X(z) be as in Lemma 4.6. Then X(z) is invertible and for the inverse we observe\nX(z)\u22121 = X\u0303(z) T =\n\n\nA\u0303(z) T\nB\u0303(z) T\nA\u0303(\u2212z) T B\u0303(\u2212z) T\n\n .\nHere we put\nA\u0303(z) T = b(\u2212z)T (z)\u22121 and B\u0303(z) T = \u2212T (z)\u22121A(\u2212z). (4.13)\nIn other words the perfect reconstruction condition (4.12) is fulfilled. Moreover there exist finitely supported matrix sequences {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z and {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z such that\nA\u0303(z) = 1 2 \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nA\u0303kz k and B\u0303(z) = 1\n2\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nB\u0303kz k. (4.14)\nProof. For the proof we can collect the things we did before. That X(z) is invertible follows from Lemma 4.8. The special structure of X(z)\u22121 was shown in the Lemmas 4.8 and 4.10. It remains to prove that the matrices A\u0303(z) and B\u0303(z) can be decomposed into sequences {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z and {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z. For that purpose we have to examine (4.13). From Lemma 4.10 we know that T (z)\u22121 only consists of Laurent polynomials. Moreover it is b(z) = 12 \u2211 k\u2208Z bkz k and A(z) is defined as in Lemma 4.6. It is known that sums and products of Laurent polynomials again are Laurent polynomials. Hence A\u0303(z) and B\u0303(z) only consist of Laurent polynomials. Let z \u2208 C with |z| = 1. Then for each Laurent polynomial we observe\np(z) =\nn2 \u2211\nk=n1\nakzk =\nn2 \u2211\nk=n1\nakzk =\nn2 \u2211\nk=n1\nak(z) k =\nn2 \u2211\nk=n1\nakz \u2212k.\nHere we used that since |z| = 1 we have z = z\u22121. Hence also A\u0303(z) and B\u0303(z) only consist of Laurent polynomials. Thus there exist matrix sequences {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z and {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z such that (4.14) holds.\nExample 4.12. Let m = m\u0303 = 1 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81) T . Then for A\u0303(z) and B\u0303(z) we obtain\nA\u0303(z) = ( 1 2z + 1 2 \u221214z \u2212 14\n0 z + 1\n)\nand B\u0303(z) = ( \u221212z + 12 14z + 14 0 \u221212z + 12 ) .\nConsequently the matrix sequences {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z and {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z are given by\nA\u03030 =\n(\n1 \u221212 0 2\n)\nand A\u03031 =\n(\n1 \u221212 0 2\n)\nand\nB\u03030 =\n(\n1 12 0 1\n)\nand B\u03031 =\n(\n\u22121 12 0 \u22121\n)\n.\nFor k \u2208 Z \\ {0, 1} we have A\u0303k = B\u0303k = 02. Here 02 is the zero matrix."

            "text": "In Section 4 we have seen that quarks and quarklets fulfill the perfect reconstruction property. Moreover we obtained a dual modulation matrix X\u0303(z). This knowledge can now be used to establish results concerning the existence and the properties of generalized dual quarks and generalized dual quarklets. For that purpose we apply some results from the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets which we recall in the following. Here the subsequent definition will be important.\nDefinition 5.1. We say that a square matrix satisfies Condition E, if it has a simple eigenvalue of 1, and all other eigenvalues are smaller than 1 in absolute value.\nCondition E is very important within the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets, see for example [27] or [23]. It can be used to formulate the following result which is already known.\nLemma 5.2. Let A\u0303(z) be defined via (4.8) with z = e\u2212i \u03be2 . Then the following assertions are true.\n(i) The matrix refinement equation (4.7) has a compactly supported distributional solution vector F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )\nT \u2208 (S \u2032(R))N if and only if A\u0303(1) has an eigenvalue of the form 2n with n \u2208 N0.\n(ii) Let 1 be the only eigenvalue of A\u0303(1) of the form 2n with n \u2208 N0. Then the matrix refinement equation (4.7) has a unique compactly supported distributional solution (up to a constant) F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N )\nT with ((F f\u03031)(0), (F f\u03032)(0), . . . , (F f\u0303N )(0))T = v if and only if 1 is a simple eigenvalue of A\u0303(1) and v = A\u0303(1)v. In particular we have\n\n  (F f\u03031)(\u03be) ...\n(F f\u0303N )(\u03be)\n\n  =\n\u221e \u220f\nj=1\nA\u0303(e\u2212i2\u2212j\u03be)\n\n  (F f\u03031)(0) ...\n(F f\u0303N )(0)\n\n  . (5.1)\n(iii) Assume that the function vector F\u0303 = (f\u03031, f\u03032, . . . , f\u0303N ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N is compactly\nsupported, refinable and L2\u2212stable. Then A\u0303(1) satisfies Condition E.\nProof. All results can be found in [27], see Theorems 1-3. Let us also refer to [21] and [23], see Chapter 11.\nNow we can use Lemma 5.2 to prove the existence of generalized dual quarks. More precisely there is the following result.\nLemma 5.3. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Let {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z be the matrix sequence from Theorem 4.11 with (4.8). Then the matrix refinement equation\n\n  \u03d5\u03030 ... \u03d5\u0303p\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nA\u0303k\n\n  \u03d5\u03030(2 \u00b7 \u2212k) ...\n\u03d5\u0303p(2 \u00b7 \u2212k)\n\n  (5.2)\nhas a compactly supported distributional solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p) T \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1.\nProof. To prove this result we use part (i) of Lemma 5.2. That means we have to compute the eigenvalues of A\u0303(1). Recall that we have\nA\u0303(z) T = b(\u2212z)T (z)\u22121.\nWe know that T (z)\u22121 has lower triangular shape, see Lemma 4.10. Moreover b(z) is a Laurent polynomial. Consequently to calculate the eigenvalues of A\u0303(1) we have to know the diagonal entries of T (z)\u22121. We already have seen that also T (z) is of lower triangular shape with diagonal entries\n(T (z))q,q = 2 \u2212q+1z,\nsee the proof of Proposition 4.14 in [30]. Here we have q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p+1}. Hence T (z)\u22121 has diagonal entries of the form\n(T (z)\u22121)q,q = 2 q\u22121 1\nz .\nNow let us turn to the Laurent polynomial b(z). From the theory of biorthogonal wavelets (see for example Section 2.1 in [30] or Remark 3.6 in [10]) we know that b(\u2212z) can be written in the form\nb(\u2212z) = za\u0303(z) = z 1 2 \u2211\nk\u2208Z\na\u0303kzk = z 1\n2\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\na\u0303kz k.\nHere the numbers a\u0303k \u2208 R are well-known and explicitly given in [30], see Theorem 2.7. Let us also refer to Section 6.A in [5]. Recall that we are interested in A\u0303(1). We observe\nb(\u22121) = a\u0303(1) = 1 2 \u2211\nk\u2208Z\na\u0303k.\nFortunately this sum is well-known from the theory of CDF-wavelets, see Section 6.A on page 541 in [5]. Here with a slightly different notation we learn b(\u22121) = a\u0303(1) = 1. Hence we get\nA\u0303(1) = T (1)\u22121T .\nRecall that T (1)\u22121 is a lower triangular matrix with diagonal entries (T (1)\u22121)q,q = 2 q\u22121. Consequently for the diagonal entries of A\u0303(1) we observe\n(A\u0303(1))q,q = (T (1)\u22121 T )q,q = (T (1) \u22121)q,q = 2 q\u22121.\nSince T (1)\u22121 is a lower triangular matrix A\u0303(1) is an upper triangular matrix. Consequently A\u0303(1) has p+ 1 eigenvalues of the form\n\u03bb1 = 1, \u03bb2 = 2, . . . \u03bbp+1 = 2 p.\nTherefore for all p \u2208 N0 there is an eigenvalue of the form 2n with n \u2208 N0. Hence we can apply part (i) of Lemma 5.2. So the claim follows.\nNext we want to study the properties of the generalized dual quarks \u03a6\u0303 we found in Lemma 5.3.\nLemma 5.4. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N with p 6= 0 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p)T . Let {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z be the matrix sequence from Theorem 4.11 with (4.8). Then the compactly supported distributional solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p)\nT \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 of the matrix refinement equation (5.2) is not L2\u2212stable.\nProof. We prove this result via contradiction. Assume that the solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p)\nT \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 also belongs to (L2(R))p+1 and is L2\u2212stable. Then we can apply part (iii) of Lemma 5.2. Therefore we find that A\u0303(1) has a simple eigenvalue 1 and the moduli of all its other eigenvalues are less then 1. From the proof of Lemma 5.3 we know that A\u0303(1) has p+ 1 eigenvalues of the form\n\u03bb1 = 1, \u03bb2 = 2, . . . \u03bbp+1 = 2 p.\nSince p > 0 consequently 2 is an eigenvalue of A\u0303(1). But this is a contradiction.\nUnfortunately it turns out that in most of the cases the generalized dual quarks which are collected in the vector \u03a6\u0303 are not biorthogonal to \u03a6 in the sense of Definition 4.1.\nTheorem 5.5. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N with p 6= 0 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p)T . Then the compactly supported distributional solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p)\nT \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 of the matrix refinement equation (5.2) is not biorthogonal to \u03a6 in the sense of Definition 4.1.\nProof. We prove this result by contradiction. Assume that the solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p) T belongs to (L2(R)) p+1 and \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are biorthogonal. Now because of \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T \u2208 (L2(R))p+1 we can apply Lemma 11.21 from [23]. It tells us that \u03a6\u0303 is L2\u2212stable. But this is a contradiction to Lemma 5.4.\nNevertheless it is possible to describe the generalized dual quarks explicitly via an infinite product.\nLemma 5.6. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Let {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z be the matrix sequence from Theorem 4.11 with (4.8). Let v be a right eigenvector of 2\u2212pA\u0303(1) corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. By Dp we denote the p-th distributional derivative operator. Then the matrix refinement equation (5.2) has a compactly supported distributional solution vector \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p)\nT \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 which is given by \n  \u03d5\u03030 ... \u03d5\u0303p\n\n  = DpF\u22121\n[ \u221e \u220f\nj=1\n2\u2212pA\u0303(e\u2212i2\u2212j\u03be)v ] .\nProof. For the proof we use some ideas from [21], see Theorem 2.5. At first let us recall that A\u0303(1) has p+ 1 eigenvalues of the form\n\u03bb1 = 1, \u03bb2 = 2, . . . \u03bbp+1 = 2 p.\nNow we put A\u03030(z) := 2\u2212pA\u0303(z). Since A\u0303(1) is an upper triangular matrix also A\u03030(1) is an upper triangular matrix. For the diagonal entries we find\n(A\u03030(1))q,q = 2q\u22121\u2212p.\nHere we have q \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p+ 1}. Consequently A\u03030(1) has p+ 1 eigenvalues of the form\n\u00b51 = 2 \u2212p, \u00b52 = 2 \u2212p+1, . . . \u00b5p+1 = 1.\nHence we can apply part (ii) of Lemma 5.2. Let v be a right eigenvector of A\u03030(1) corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Then there exists a unique compactly supported distribution vector (up to a constant) F\u0303 = (f\u03030, f\u03031, . . . , f\u0303p)\nT with ((F f\u03030)(0), (F f\u03031)(0), . . . , (F f\u0303p)(0))T = v such that\n\n  (F f\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n(F f\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  = A\u03030(e\u2212i\n\u03be 2 )\n\n  (F f\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F f\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  .\nMoreover we have \n  (F f\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n(F f\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  =\n\u221e \u220f\nj=1\nA\u03030(e\u2212i2 \u2212j\u03be)\n\n  (F f\u03030)(0) ...\n(F f\u0303p)(0)\n\n  =\n\u221e \u220f\nj=1\nA\u03030(e\u2212i2 \u2212j\u03be)v\nwith pointwise convergence. With other words we have \n  f\u03030 ...\nf\u0303p\n\n  = F\u22121\n[ \u221e \u220f\nj=1\nA\u03030(e\u2212i2 \u2212j\u03be)v\n]\n.\nSince the distributions f\u0303q\u22121 \u2208 S \u2032(R) are compactly supported, the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem yields that the F f\u0303q\u22121 are entire analytic functions of at most polynomial growth. Now let Dp be the p-th distributional derivative operator. Then we put\n\u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p) T := DpF\u0303 := (Dpf\u03030,D pf\u03031, . . . ,D pf\u0303p) T .\nThen of course \u03a6\u0303 \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 consists of compactly supported distributions. We observe \n  (F\u03d5\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  = C1\n\n  \u03bep(F f\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n\u03bep(F f\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  and\n2p\u03be\u2212p\nC1\n\n  (F\u03d5\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  =\n\n  (F f\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F f\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  .\nMoreover we have \n  (F\u03d5\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  = C1\u03be pA\u03030(e\u2212i \u03be 2 )\n\n  (F f\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F f\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  = 2pA\u03030(e\u2212i \u03be 2 )\n\n  (F\u03d5\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  .\nNow recall that we have A\u03030(z) = 2\u2212pA\u0303(z). Consequently we obtain \n  (F\u03d5\u03030)(\u03be) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)(\u03be)\n\n  = A\u0303(e\u2212i \u03be2 )\n\n  (F\u03d5\u03030)( \u03be2 ) ...\n(F\u03d5\u0303p)( \u03be2 )\n\n  .\nTherefore we get \n  \u03d5\u03030 ... \u03d5\u0303p\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nA\u0303k\n\n  \u03d5\u03030(2 \u00b7 \u2212k) ...\n\u03d5\u0303p(2 \u00b7 \u2212k)\n\n  .\nMoreover our construction yields that \u03a6\u0303 can be written as\n\n  \u03d5\u03030 ... \u03d5\u0303p\n\n  = Dp\n\n  f\u03030 ...\nf\u0303p\n\n  = DpF\u22121\n[ \u221e \u220f\nj=1\n2\u2212pA\u0303(e\u2212i2\u2212j\u03be)v ] .\nSo the proof is complete.\nUsing the results we obtained up to now it is also possible to define generalized dual quarklets. For instance this can be done in the following way.\nDefinition 5.7. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Moreover {A\u0303k}k\u2208Z is the matrix sequence from Theorem 4.11. Let \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p) T \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 be the compactly supported distributional solution vector of the matrix refinement equation (5.2) given in Lemma 5.6. Furthermore {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z is the matrix sequence from Theorem 4.11. Then we define the generalized dual quarklets \u03a8\u0303 = (\u03c8\u03030, \u03c8\u03031, . . . , \u03c8\u0303p) T via\n\n  \u03c8\u03030 ...\n\u03c8\u0303p\n\n  =\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nB\u0303k\n\n  \u03d5\u03030(2 \u00b7 \u2212k) ...\n\u03d5\u0303p(2 \u00b7 \u2212k)\n\n  . (5.3)\nIt is not difficult to see that the properties of the generalized dual quarklets are similar to those of the generalized dual quarks. More precisely we know the following.\nLemma 5.8. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Moreover \u03a8\u0303 = (\u03c8\u03030, \u03c8\u03031, . . . , \u03c8\u0303p)\nT are the dual quarklets from Definition 5.7. Then all \u03c8\u0303q with q \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p} are compactly supported distributions from S \u2032(R).\nProof. From Definition 5.7 we know that the generalized dual quarklets \u03a8\u0303 = (\u03c8\u03030, \u03c8\u03031, . . . , \u03c8\u0303p) T are given by (5.3). In Lemma 5.6 we learned that \u03a6\u0303 = (\u03d5\u03030, \u03d5\u03031, . . . , \u03d5\u0303p) T \u2208 (S \u2032(R))p+1 consists of compactly supported distributions. The matrix sequence {B\u0303k}k\u2208Z is given in Theorem 4.11. Here we observed that\nB\u0303(z) = 1 2 \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nB\u0303kz k and B\u0303(z) T = \u2212T (z)\u22121A(\u2212z).\nFrom Proposition 3.7 we know that A(z) consists of a finite number of matrices Ak. In Lemma 4.10 we learned that T (z)\u22121 only consists of Laurent polynomials with finitely many non-vanishing coefficients. Consequently the same holds true for T (z)\u22121A(\u2212z). Therefore the claim follows.\nRemark 5.9. Recall that for p 6= 0 in Theorem 5.5 we learned that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are not biorthogonal in the usual L2\u2212sense, see Definition 4.1. However there might be a chance that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are dual in a more general way at least in some special cases. So we know that our quarks \u03a6 belong to the Sobolev space (Hs(R))p+1 for s < m \u2212 12 , see Lemma 3 in Chapter 2.3.1 in [28]. Consequently it arises the question whether also \u03a6\u0303 belongs to a Sobolev space (Ht(R))p+1 for some t \u2208 R, possibly with t < 0. One possible way to deal with this problem is to use the theory developed in [15]. More precisely in [15] we can apply Theorem 6.3.3 on page 517 in combination with (5.6.44) and Theorem 5.8.4 on page 461. Proceeding that way for example in the special case m = m\u0303 = 1 with p = 1 and \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51) T we obtain \u03a6\u0303 \u2208 (H\u22121(R))2. However maybe this result is not sharp, see\n[15]. To obtain optimal results for arbitrary parameters m, m\u0303 and p much more effort is necessary. This will be the subject of future research. Finally one can ask whether \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are dual in the sense of dual Sobolev spaces, see Chapter 4.6 on page 327 in [15] for a definition. However duality can not hold in the case m > 1 and p > 0 because of the lack of stability, see the proof of Theorem 6.4.5 in [15]. So biorthogonality would imply L2\u2212stability of \u03a6, what contradicts Lemma 3.11."

            "heading": "6 Quarklet Multiscale Decomposition",
            "text": "In this section we want to find out whether quarks and quarklets provide a multiscale decomposition of L2(R). The starting point will be the spaces Vp,j, see Definition 3.5. We want to know whether there exist complement spacesWp,j generated by the quarklets such that Vp,j+1 = Vp,j\u2295Wp,j. Here in general \u2295 can not be expected to be an orthogonal sum. But it might be a non-orthogonal algebraic direct sum. One first step towards the answer is the following lemma. Here we see that each vector of fine quarks has a decomposition into quarklets and quarks on a coarse level.\nLemma 6.1. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Put \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Let \u033a \u2208 {0, 1}. Then there exist sequences of (p + 1)\u00d7 (p+ 1) matrices {C\u033a+2k}k\u2208Z and {D\u033a+2k}k\u2208Z such that\n\u03a6(2 \u00b7 \u2212\u033a) = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nC\u033a+2k\u03a6(\u00b7 \u2212 k) + \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nD\u033a+2k\u03a8(\u00b7 \u2212 k).\nMoreover the length of the reconstruction sequences {C\u033a+2k}k\u2208Z and {D\u033a+2k}k\u2208Z scales linearly with p.\nThis result can be found in [30], see Theorem 4.15 and Theorem 4.16. A similar observation also was made in [10]. In order to prove the desired decomposition of L2(R) it is advantageous to introduce the concept of sub-symbol and polyphase matrices.\nDefinition 6.2. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m+ m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . The matrices A(z) and B(z) as well as the matrix sequences {Ak}k and {Bk}k are as in Lemma 4.6.\n(i) Then for \u033a \u2208 {0, 1} we define the sub-symbol matrices A\u033a(z2) and B\u033a(z2) by (\nA\u033a(z2) )\nq,l :=\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n(A2k+\u033a)q,lz 2k\nand (\nB\u033a(z2) )\nq,l :=\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n(B2k+\u033a)q,lz 2k\nwith q, l \u2208 {1, . . . , p+ 1}.\n(ii) We define the polyphase matrix P (z) via\nP (z) :=\n(\nA0(z2) A1(z2) B0(z2) B1(z2)\n)\n.\nDefinition 6.2 was inspired by Proposition 3.1 in [10]. The polyphase matrix plays a crucial role in the theory of biorthogonal multiwavelets, see Chapter 7.7 in [23] and [13]. It can be written in terms of the modulation matrix, see Proposition 3.3 in [10] for the quarklet case.\nLemma 6.3. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m + m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p) T and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . Then the polyphase matrix P (z) is invertible for all z \u2208 C with |z| = 1. In other words it has full rank of 2p + 2.\nProof. For the proof at first we observe that we can write\nP (z) = X(z)E(z)\nwith X(z) as in Lemma 4.6 and\nE(z) := ( Idp+1 1 z Idp+1\nIdp+1 \u22121z Idp+1\n)\n.\nThis is proved in [10], see Proposition 3.3. There we also find that E(z) is invertible for all z \u2208 C with |z| = 1. Moreover we know that X(z) is invertible, see Lemma 4.8. Consequently we find that also the polyphase matrix P (z) is invertible.\nIn what follows the spaces Wp,j generated by the quarklets will be important.\nDefinition 6.4. Let j \u2208 Z and p \u2208 N0. Then we define the spaces\nWp,j := span {2 j 2\u03c8q(2j \u00b7 \u2212k) : 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p, k \u2208 Z} \u2282 L2(R).\nHere the functions \u03c8q are the quarklets from Definition 2.3.\nThe spaces Wp,j can be used to obtain the desired decomposition of L2(R). One important intermediate step toward this result can be found in the following lemma.\nLemma 6.5. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m+ m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and j \u2208 Z.\n(i) Then we have Vp,j+1 = Vp,j +Wp,j.\n(ii) Let in addition either m = 1 or p = 0. Then we also have\nVp,j+1 = Vp,j \u2295Wp,j.\nHere \u2295 denotes the (non-orthogonal) algebraic direct sum.\nProof. For the proof we only consider the case j = 0. Then the general case follows by standard arguments.\nStep 1. At first we prove Vp,1 \u2282 Vp,0 +Wp,0. For that purpose let f \u2208 Vp,1. Then f can be approximated in L2(R) via functions of the form\ng =\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ncl,q\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l)\nwith appropriate {cl,q}l\u2208Z,q\u2208{0,1,...,p} \u2282 C. From Lemma 6.1 we know that for \u033a \u2208 {0, 1} and q \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p} we can find sequences {ek,r,\u033a}k\u2208Z,r\u2208{0,1,...,p},\u033a\u2208{0,1} \u2282 C and {dk,r,\u033a}k\u2208Z,r\u2208{0,1,...,p},\u033a\u2208{0,1} \u2282 C such that\n\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212\u033a) = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\np \u2211\nr=0\nek,r,\u033a\u03d5r(\u00b7 \u2212 k) + \u2211\nk\u2208Z\np \u2211\nr=0\ndk,r,\u033a\u03c8r(\u00b7 \u2212 k).\nFor l \u2208 Z similar representations can be found for \u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l). Consequently we can write\ng =\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ncl,q\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l)\n=\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ncl,q\n(\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\np \u2211\nr=0\nel,q,k,r\u03d5r(\u00b7 \u2212 k) + \u2211\nk\u2208Z\np \u2211\nr=0\ndl,q,k,r\u03c8r(\u00b7 \u2212 k) )\n=\np \u2211\nr=0\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u03b1k,r\u03d5r(\u00b7 \u2212 k) + p \u2211\nr=0\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u03b2k,r\u03c8r(\u00b7 \u2212 k)\nfor appropriate {el,q,k,r}l,q,k,r \u2282 C, {dl,q,k,r}l,q,k,r \u2282 C, {\u03b1k,r}k,r \u2282 C and {\u03b2k,r}k,r \u2282 C. Therefore we conclude f \u2208 Vp,0 +Wp,0.\nStep 2. Now we prove Vp,0 + Wp,0 \u2282 Vp,1. Let f \u2208 Vp,0 + Wp,0. Then f can be approximated in L2(R) via functions of the form\ng =\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ndl,q\u03d5q(\u00b7 \u2212 l) + p \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ncl,q\u03c8q(\u00b7 \u2212 l)\nwith appropriate {dl,q}l\u2208Z,q\u2208{0,1,...,p} \u2282 C and {cl,q}l\u2208Z,q\u2208{0,1,...,p} \u2282 C. We use Proposition 3.7 to find\ng =\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\nal,q\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l) + p \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\ncl,q\u03c8q(\u00b7 \u2212 l)\nwith {al,q}l\u2208Z,q\u2208{0,1,...,p} \u2282 C. Then Definition 2.3 yields\ng =\np \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\nal,q\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l) + p \u2211\nq=0\n\u2211\nl\u2208Z\nbl,q\u03d5q(2 \u00b7 \u2212l)\nwith {bl,q}l\u2208Z,q\u2208{0,1,...,p} \u2282 C. Consequently we find f \u2208 Vp,1. Step 3. Now we prove (ii). For that purpose let in addition either m = 1 or p = 0. Recall that for p = 0 the desired result is already well-known, see Section 6.A in [5]. So it remains to deal with the case m = 1. Here at first from Lemma 3.11 we learn that the integer shifts of \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)\nT are L2\u2212stable. Consequently we can use similar arguments as described in Section 1 in [13], see also Section 4 in [25]. Since the integer shifts of \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)\nT are L2\u2212stable and because of Definition 3.5 our spaces Vp,0 fit into the setting described at the beginning of Section 4 in [25]. Therefore we can use the arguments from [25], see formula (4.3), to find that the integer shifts of\n\u03d50(2x), \u03d51(2x), . . . , \u03d5p(2x), \u03d50(2x\u2212 1), \u03d51(2x\u2212 1), . . . , \u03d5p(2x\u2212 1) (6.1)\nare a Riesz basis for Vp,1. Those are 2p + 2 functions. Next from Definition 2.3 and Proposition 3.7 we conclude that\n{\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p, \u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p} \u2282 Vp,1.\nWe observe that the integer shifts of the 2p+ 2 functions\n\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p, \u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p (6.2)\nare L2\u2212stable. To see this we can use Theorem 4.3 in [19]. It can be applied since the functions in (6.1) have stable integer translates. Recall that all involved functions belong\nto L2(R), see the remark before Theorem 2.1 in [19] for a definition and explanations. Moreover that the corresponding polyphase matrix P (z) from Definition 6.2 is nonsingular for all z \u2208 C with |z| = 1 has already been observed in Lemma 6.3. Consequently the L2\u2212stability of (6.2) follows. Let us remark that this result also can be obtained by using Theorem 5.1 from [19] and Lemma 3.2. However proceeding that way one has to carry out some rather technical computations. In a next step Theorem 3.1 from [25] yields\nspan {\u03d50(\u00b7 \u2212 k), . . . , \u03d5p(\u00b7 \u2212 k), \u03c80(\u00b7 \u2212 k), . . . , \u03c8p(\u00b7 \u2212 k) : k \u2208 Z} = Vp,1.\nConsequently we are in the setting described in [13], see page 143. So like there we can conclude that Vp,1 is the algebraic direct sum of Vp,0 andWp,0. This follows from Definition 6.4 which is similar to that from [13].\nNow we are well-prepared to prove the desired decomposition of L2(R) using the spaces Wp,j.\nTheorem 6.6. Let m \u2208 N and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m \u2264 m\u0303 and m+ m\u0303 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0.\n(i) We have\nL2(R) = . . . +Wp,\u22122 +Wp,\u22121 +Wp,0 +Wp,1 +Wp,2 + . . .\n= Vp,0 +Wp,0 +Wp,1 +Wp,2 + . . . .\n(ii) Let in addition either m = 1 or p = 0. Then we have\nL2(R) = \u2295\nj\u2208Z\nWp,j = Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j.\nHere \u2295 denotes the (non-orthogonal) algebraic direct sum.\nProof. We only proof (ii). The proof of (i) can be done with similar methods using Lemma 6.5.\nStep 1. At first we prove that for all J \u2208 N we have\nVp,0 \u2295 J \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j \u2282 L2(R). (6.3)\nTo see this we use Lemma 6.5 several times. Then we get\nVp,0 \u2295 J \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j = Vp,1 \u2295 J \u2295\nj=1\nWp,j = . . . = Vp,J+1 \u2282 L2(R)\ndue to Definition 3.5. This shows (6.3). Step 2. Next we prove\nL2(R) \u2282 Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j. (6.4)\nFor that purpose we apply Theorem 3.8 and Lemma 6.5 to find\nL2(R) = \u22c3\nj\u2208Z\nVp,j = \u22c3\nj\u22651\nVp,j = \u22c3\nj\u22651\nVp,j\u22121 \u2295Wp,j\u22121.\nIterating this argument we get\nL2(R) = \u22c3\nj\u22651\nj\u22121 \u2295\nn=0\nWp,n \u2295 Vp,0 \u2286 \u221e \u2295\nn=0\nWp,n \u2295 Vp,0.\nSo the proof of (6.4) is complete. Step 3. It remains to show that we have\n\u2295\nj\u2208Z\nWp,j = Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j. (6.5)\nTo see this Lemma 6.5 yields that for all J \u2208 Z \\ N0 we have\nVp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j = Vp,J \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=J\nWp,j.\nSending J to \u2212\u221e and using Theorem 3.8, see (i) and (iii) in Definition 3.4, finally (6.5) follows. This also completes the proof of Theorem 6.6.\nOne very important application of quarks and quarklets is to use them for the numerical approximation of functions. For that purpose it seems to be advantageous if the functions that generateWp,j are orthogonal. Therefore in what follows we increase the orthogonality of those spaces at least for m = 1. To this end we can use some results from [22]. Here the concept of minimality (sometimes also called g-minimality) plays an important role. For that let us refer to page 2 in [22], see also Definition 2.4 in [33].\nDefinition 6.7. Let F = (f1, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N with N \u2208 N be a finite vector of nontrivial functions. Then we use the following definitions.\n(i) We put S(F ) := span {fl(\u00b7 \u2212 k) : k \u2208 Z, fl \u2208 F} \u2282 L2(R).\n(ii) For any fl \u2208 F with 1 \u2264 l \u2264 N we put F (l) := F \\ {fl}.\n(iii) We say that F is minimal (or g-minimal) if for any 1 \u2264 l \u2264 N we have fl 6\u2208 S(F (l)). Minimality can be interpreted as a generalization of L2\u2212stability.\nLemma 6.8. Let F = (f1, . . . , fN ) T \u2208 (L2(R))N be a multiscaling function of multiplicity N according to Definition 3.4, item (vi). If F is L2\u2212stable, it is also minimal. Proof. Let F = (f1, . . . , fN )\nT \u2208 (L2(R))N be L2\u2212stable. We proceed by contradiction and assume that F is not minimal. Consequently there exists at least one l \u2208 {1, . . . , N} such that fl \u2208 S(F (l)). With other words there is a representation\nfl(x) = \u2211\nn\u2208{1,...,N} n 6=l\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\ncn,kfn(x\u2212 k). (6.6)\nUsing the definition of L2\u2212stability, namely Definition 3.1, we find\n0 = \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 fl \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u2208{1,...,N} n 6=l\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\ncn,kfn(\u00b7 \u2212 k) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 L2(R) \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 2\n\u2265 C1 ( 1 + \u2211\nn\u2208{1,...,N} n 6=l\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n|cn,k|2 )\n\u2265 C1 with C1 > 0. However this is a contradiction.\nLet us remark that minimality does not imply L2\u2212stability, see [24]. Now it is not difficult to see that minimality is valid for our quarklet vector \u03a8 for m = 1.\nLemma 6.9. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 + 1 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Then the set \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T is minimal.\nProof. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 + 1 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. We already have seen that the integer shifts of the p+ 1 functions\n\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p\nare L2\u2212stable, see formula (6.2) in Step 3 of the proof of Lemma 6.5. Using Lemma 6.8 we find that those functions are also minimal.\nLet us remark that it is also possible to prove Lemma 6.9 by checking Definition 6.7. The proof is then based on the different polynomial degrees of the involved functions. In what follows to apply the theory from [22] we also need the subsequent definition.\nDefinition 6.10. Let f, g \u2208 L2(R). Then for all x \u2208 R we put\n[f, g](x) := \u2211\nk\u2208Z\nf(x+ 2\u03c0k)g(x + 2\u03c0k).\nNow we are prepared to provide a describtion for the orthogonal projection onto Wp,0. In the following result we use the convention 00 = 0.\nTheorem 6.11. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 + 1 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p) T . By iteration we define \u03c8\u22c60 := \u03c80 and for 1 \u2264 q \u2264 p\nF\u03c8\u22c6q := F\u03c8q \u2212 q\u22121 \u2211\nl=0\n[F\u03c8q,F\u03c8\u22c6l ] [F\u03c8\u22c6l ,F\u03c8\u22c6l ] F\u03c8\u22c6l .\nThen for any f \u2208 L2(R) the orthogonal projection PWp,0(f) of f onto Wp,0 is given by\nF(PWp,0(f)) = p \u2211\nq=0\n[Ff,F\u03c8\u22c6q ] [F\u03c8\u22c6q ,F\u03c8\u22c6q ] F\u03c8\u22c6q .\nMoreover for all 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p the [F\u03c8\u22c6q ,F\u03c8\u22c6q ] are rational trigonometric functions (see Section 3 in [22] for a definition).\nProof. This result is an easy consequence of Lemma 2.1 in [22], see also Lemma 2.13 in [33]. It is important that the set \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p)\nT is minimal, see Lemma 6.9. The last statement follows from Theorem 3.1 in [22]. Here we used that the quarklets are compactly supported.\nThe functions \u03c8\u22c6q we obtained in Theorem 6.11 have some pleasant properties. Some of them are collected below.\nLemma 6.12. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 + 1 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0 and \u03a8\u22c6 = (\u03c8\u22c60 , \u03c8 \u22c6 1 , . . . , \u03c8 \u22c6 p)\nT \u2208 (L2(R))p+1 be the functions defined in Theorem 6.11. Then the following assertions are true.\n(i) For all 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p we have \u03c8\u22c6q \u2208Wp,0.\n(ii) For all 0 \u2264 q, r \u2264 p with q 6= r we observe \u3008\u03c8\u22c6q , \u03c8\u22c6r \u3009L2(R) = 0.\nProof. Step 1. At first we prove (i). This follows directly from Proposition 2.2 in [22]. We use that the set \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8p)\nT is minimal, see Lemma 6.9. Recall that we have Wp,0 = S(\u03a8).\nStep 2. Now we prove (ii). For that purpose at first we use the Plancherel Theorem. Then we find\n\u3008\u03c8\u22c6q , \u03c8\u22c6r \u3009L2(R) = \u222b\nR\n\u03c8\u22c6q (x)\u03c8 \u22c6 r (x)dx\n=\n\u222b\nR\n(F\u03c8\u22c6q )(\u03be)(F\u03c8\u22c6r )(\u03be)d\u03be\n= \u2211\nk\u2208Z\n\u222b 2\u03c0k+2\u03c0\n2\u03c0k (F\u03c8\u22c6q )(\u03be)(F\u03c8\u22c6r )(\u03be)d\u03be\n=\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\n(F\u03c8\u22c6q )(\u03be + 2\u03c0k)(F\u03c8\u22c6r )(\u03be + 2\u03c0k)d\u03be.\nNext we apply Definition 6.10. We obtain\n\u3008\u03c8\u22c6q , \u03c8\u22c6r \u3009L2(R) = \u222b 2\u03c0\n0 [F\u03c8\u22c6q ,F\u03c8\u22c6r ](\u03be)d\u03be.\nFormula (2.4) in Proposition 2.2 in [22] yields [F\u03c8\u22c6q ,F\u03c8\u22c6r ](\u03be) = 0 almost everywhere on [0, 2\u03c0]. Consequently we get \u3008\u03c8\u22c6q , \u03c8\u22c6r \u3009L2(R) = 0 . The proof is complete.\nLet us give an example to illustrate how the functions \u03c8\u22c6q look like.\nExample 6.13. Let m = m\u0303 = 1 and p = 3. That means we work with \u03a8 = (\u03c80, \u03c81, \u03c82, \u03c83) T . Then for \u03a8\u22c6 we find\n\u03c8\u22c60 = \u03c80 =\n{\n1, x \u2208 [0, 1/2), \u22121, x \u2208 [1/2, 1),\n\u03c8\u22c61 = \u03c81 \u2212 1\n2 \u03c8\u22c60 =\n{\n2x\u2212 12 , x \u2208 [0, 1/2), \u22122x+ 32 , x \u2208 [1/2, 1),\n\u03c8\u22c62 = \u03c82 \u2212 \u03c8\u22c61 \u2212 1\n3 \u03c8\u22c60 = \u03c82 \u2212 \u03c81 +\n1 6 \u03c80 =\n{\n4x2 \u2212 2x+ 16 , x \u2208 [0, 1/2), \u22124x2 + 6x\u2212 136 , x \u2208 [1/2, 1).\nFor q = 3 we have\n\u03c8\u22c63 = \u03c83 \u2212 3\n2 \u03c82 +\n3 5 \u03c81 \u2212 1 20 \u03c80 =\n{\n8x3 \u2212 6x2 + 65x\u2212 120 , x \u2208 [0, 1/2), \u22128x3 + 18x2 \u2212 665 x+ 6320 , x \u2208 [1/2, 1).\nNotice that the branches of the resulting functions remind on the Legendre polynomials transplanted onto the subintervals.\nRemark 6.14. Notice that for m = 1 the modified quarklets collected in \u03a8\u22c6 are linear combinations of the original quarklets \u03a8, see also Example 6.13. Therefore the functions \u03c8\u22c6q possess at least the same number of vanishing moments as the original quarklets \u03c8q. For results concerning vanishing moments of quarklets we refer to [8].\nWe can use the modified quarklets from \u03a8\u22c6 to rewrite the spaces Wp,j in a more convenient way. For that purpose let us give the following definition.\n-0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 -3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 1: \u03c8\u22c62 for m = m\u0303 = 1. -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 2: \u03c8\u22c63 for m = m\u0303 = 1.\nDefinition 6.15. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303 + 1 \u2208 2N. Let j \u2208 Z and p \u2208 N0. Let \u03a8\u22c6 = (\u03c8\u22c60 , \u03c8 \u22c6 1 , . . . , \u03c8 \u22c6 p) T be the functions defined in Theorem 6.11. Then we define\nW \u22c6p,j := span {2 j 2\u03c8\u22c6q (2 j \u00b7 \u2212k) : 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p, k \u2208 Z} \u2282 L2(R).\nMoreover for each 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p we put\nW \u22c6\u22c6q,j := span {2 j 2\u03c8\u22c6q (2 j \u00b7 \u2212k) : k \u2208 Z} \u2282 L2(R). It is not difficult to see that the spaces Wp,j and W \u22c6 p,j are equal.\nLemma 6.16. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303+ 1 \u2208 2N. Let j \u2208 Z and p \u2208 N0. Then we have\nW \u22c6p,j = \u02c6\u2295p\nq=0 W \u22c6\u22c6q,j =Wp,j.\nHere \u2295\u0302 stands for the orthogonal direct sum. Proof. To prove this result we use Proposition 2.3 from [22]. Recall that we have S(\u03a8\u22c6) = W \u22c6p,0 and S(\u03c8 \u22c6 q ) =W \u22c6\u22c6 q,0. The set \u03a8 is minimal, see Lemma 6.9. Consequently the assertion of Lemma 6.16 follows when we apply Proposition 2.3 from [22].\nUsing the spaces from Definition 6.15 we can reformulate Theorem 6.6.\nTheorem 6.17. Let m = 1 and m\u0303 \u2208 N with m\u0303+ 1 \u2208 2N. Let p \u2208 N0. Then we have\nL2(R) = \u2295\nj\u2208Z\nW \u22c6p,j = \u2295\nj\u2208Z\n\u02c6\u2295p\nq=0 W \u22c6\u22c6q,j\nand\nL2(R) = Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nW \u22c6p,j = Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\n\u02c6\u2295p\nq=0 W \u22c6\u22c6q,j.\nHere \u2295 denotes the (non-orthogonal) algebraic direct sum. Moreover \u2295\u0302 stands for the orthogonal direct sum.\nProof. To prove this result on the one hand we use Theorem 6.6. There we obtained\nL2(R) = \u2295\nj\u2208Z\nWp,j = Vp,0 \u2295 \u221e \u2295\nj=0\nWp,j.\nOn the other hand we apply Lemma 6.16. Now a combination of both observations completes the proof.\nRemark 6.18. Let m = 1 and p \u2208 N. Then there exists an alternative way to construct a vector \u03a6\u0306 \u2208 (L2(R))p+1 which is biorthogonal to the quark vector \u03a6 = (\u03d50, \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5p)T in the sense of Definition 4.1. For that purpose we define the Gramian matrix G which is given by\nG := ( [F\u03d5i\u22121,F\u03d5j\u22121] )\ni=1,...,p+1;j=1,...,p+1 .\nSince for m = 1 the quark vector \u03a6 is L2\u2212stable, see Lemma 3.11, the existence of G\u22121 follows. For that we refer to [17], see Section 2.2.9. Now we introduce a function vector \u03a6\u0306 given by\n\u03a6\u0306 := F\u22121[G\u22121F\u03a6].\nIt has been shown in [26], see Proposition 2.1, that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0306 are biorthogonal in the sense of Definition 4.1. Here we also can refer to Theorem 2.2.14 in [17]. An advantage of this approach is that we have \u03a6\u0306 \u2208 (L2(R))p+1 and that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0306 are dual in the usual L2\u2212sense. Moreover using the usual procedure now it is possible to construct a biorthogonal quarklet system. However the resulting quarklet functions do not coincide with \u03a8 and are not compactly supported, but they are decaying exponentially at least."

Step 2. Now we apply Lemma 3.3. Since the quarks are compactly supported functions from L2(R) this is possible. We use different combinations of m \u2208 N and l \u2208 N0 and check whether we have\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208Z\n|(F\u03d5l)(\u03be + 2\u03c0\u03b1)|2 > 0 (7.1)\nfor all \u03be \u2208 R or not. For that purpose we use the results from Step 1. If we find a 2\u03c0 periodic zero then (7.1) cannot be fulfilled for all \u03be \u2208 R. If there is no 2\u03c0 periodic zero then (7.1) holds. So we can use Lemma 3.3 to complete the proof.\nFunding.
