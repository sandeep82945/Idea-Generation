1. **Investigate the use of other deep learning architectures for DON level classification.** The authors used a 1D-CNN architecture in this study, but other architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), may also be effective for this task.

2. **Explore the use of other spectral imaging techniques for DON level classification.** The authors used hyperspectral imaging in this study, but other techniques, such as multispectral imaging or fluorescence imaging, may also be effective for this task.

3. **Develop a system for real-time DON level classification.** The authors' method is currently only able to classify DON levels in offline settings. However, it could be adapted for real-time classification by using a more powerful computer or by using a cloud-based computing platform.

4. **Investigate the use of DON level classification for other applications.** The authors focused on using DON level classification for barley kernels in this study. However, their method could also be used for other applications, such as classifying DON levels in wheat kernels or corn kernels.

5. **Develop a method for quantifying DON levels using spectral imaging.** The authors' method can only classify DON levels into two or three categories. However, it could be extended to quantify DON levels by using a regression model.
