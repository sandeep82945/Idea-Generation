Among these reduction products, ammonia (NH3) holds particular significance due to its utility in nitrogen-based fertilizers and its versatile applications in various industrial processes. Platinum-based catalysts have exhibited promise in\nenhancing the rate and selectivity of these reduction reactions. In this study, we employ density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the catalytic potential of Pt nanoparticle (PtNP)-supported\nZrO2 for the conversion of NO3 to NH3. The most favorable pathway for the NO3 reduction to NH3 follows a sequence, that is, NO3 / NO2 / NO / ONH / ONH2/HNOH / NH2/NH / NH2 / NH3, culminating in the production of valuable ammonia. The introduction of low-state Fe and Co dopants\ninto the ZrO2 support reduces energy barriers for the most challenging rate-determining hydrogenation step in NOx reduction to NH3, demonstrating significant improvements in catalytic activity. The incorporation of dopants into the ZrO2 support results in a depletion of electron density within the Pt cocatalyst resulting in enhanced hydrogen transfer efficiency during the hydrogenation process. This\nstudy aims to provide insights into the catalytic activity of platinum-based ZrO2 catalysts and will help design new high-performance catalysts for the reduction of atmospheric pollutants and for energy\napplications."

These emissions, combined with particulate matter, contribute to the occurrence of severe smog in northern regions of China, posing a serious threat to public health.2,3 Among the NOx gases, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an inorganic air pollutant that poses signicant harm to human health, animals, and the environment.1,4,5 While natural events such as volcanic eruptions, lightning strikes, and forest res also contribute to NOx emissions, the most substantial sources are human activities, including combustion processes, transportation, and industrial operations.1 When NO2 is exposed to sunlight, it undergoes photolysis, breaking down into nitrogen monoxide (NO) and atomic oxygen, O(3P). The atomic oxygen then combines with molecular oxygen to form tropospheric ozone.6 This process plays a crucial role in the formation of photochemical smog, which consists of a harmful mixture of toxic chemicals resulting from the interaction between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Exposure to photochemical smog, including elevated levels of tropospheric ozone, can have detrimental effects on the respiratory system and overall lung health.5,7\nOn the other hand, over the past century, the widespread use of articial nitrogen fertilizers has signicantly increased food\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509 | 34497\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Eutrophication and acidication of water resources are among the issues caused by the excessive presence of high-valence-state nitrate, which is highly toxic to both humans and the environment.8,9 To mitigate these problems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set strict guidelines recommending a maximum nitrate concentration of 50 mg dm\u22123 in drinking water.10 Unfortunately, the contamination of underground water sources due to the excessive emission of nitrate ions has become a widespread issue caused by factors such as fertilizer runoff, stock farming, and industrial wastewater.11,12 To combat this problem, there is a growing need to develop efficient methods for converting toxic nitrate into valuable ammonia. Ammonia, with its low-valence-state, is not only an essential component for nitrogen-based fertilizers but also serves as a key chemical in the production of articial bers.13\u201315 Currently, the synthesis of ammonia involves the energy-intensive Haber\u2013Bosch process, which requires high pressures and temperatures.16 In contrast, the conversion of toxic nitrate into ammonia in a catalytic reduction process holds signicant scientic and practical importance. By developing a catalytic system for the reduction of nitrate, it becomes possible to convert harmful nitrate compounds into valuable ammonia. This process offers several benets, including its potential contribution to the ecosystem, improvement of human health, and facilitation of sustainable social development.\nPhotocatalysis offers a promising and sustainable approach to facilitate the process.17,18 Various photocatalysts, including TiO2, SrTiO3, and BiOCl, have been investigated for their ability to catalyze the reduction of NO3\n\u2212 into NH3.19\u201321 Furthermore, the deposition of metal particles, such as Cu, Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd, has been extensively employed to enhance both the catalytic performance and visible light absorption characteristics of Catalysts/TiO2.22\u201325 This strategy effectively suppresses electron\u2013 hole recombination and promotes photocatalytic activity. For example, Yamauchi et al. successfully achieved high NH3 selectivity of approximately 78% in the photocatalytic reduction of NO3 \u2212 by depositing alloyed CuPd nanoparticles on TiO2.25 However, the electron-rich nature of TiO2 tends to promote the undesired oxidation of NO2 to NO3\n\u2212 species rather than the desired reduction to nitrogen-containing compounds. This is due to the ability of TiO2 to stabilize intermediate NO2 adsorbates and facilitate their oxidation through a bifunctional charge exchange mechanism. The stabilization of surface-NO3 \u2212 and NO3 \u2212 ion pair congurations on TiO2 further supports the notion that TiO2 may be more favorable for NO2 oxidation reactions rather than its reduction to nitrogen-containing compounds.\nMulticomponent catalyst systems, which comprise two or more interdependent components, have gained recognition as promising materials for achieving higher catalytic activities. One approach involves the utilization of oxide-supported metals, which operate through the interfacial effect at the interfaces between the oxide and metal components.26\u201329 Signicant efforts have been devoted to the exploration of active metals for these multicomponent catalyst systems, ranging\n34498 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509\nfrom precious platinum-group metals to nonprecious transition metals. The objective is to identify suitable catalysts that can effectively promote the desired chemical reactions. Meanwhile, there is a wide range of oxide supports available for catalyst systems, including ZnO, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2, CeO2, Ga2O3, MgO, Cr2O3, and Nb2O5. In these systems, metals are commonly recognized as the active sites. The properties of metals, such as particle size, dispersion, specic surface area, and alloy components, along with their interactions with the supports, have been extensively discussed in various reviews and perspective articles. These studies aim to establish correlations between these metal and support properties and the catalytic performance of the systems.30\u201337\nZirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is highly valued as both a catalyst and support material for various reactions due to its exceptional thermal stability, excellent redox properties, and the presence of acid\u2013base sites on its surface. It has been successfully utilized in reactions such as CO2 methanation,38,39 water\u2013gas shi,40,41 and NO2 selective catalytic reduction.42,43 Particularly noteworthy is the powerful catalytic activity exhibited by transition metal oxides dispersed on the surface of ZrO2 in NO reduction reactions. Studies have shown that Cu/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate high NO conversion to N2 at low temperatures, utilizing a nitrous oxide (N2O) intermediate in the NO\u2013CO reaction.44 ZrO2, as a support material, outperforms CeO2 in reducing the energy barrier for NO dissociation.45 Additionally, ZrO2 offers ample sites for NOx adsorption, which is benecial for NO reduction.46,47 Notably, a study by Koga et al. discovered that a cZrO2 (110) ultrathin lm covering a Cu surface exhibited remarkable activity in NOx reduction.48\nAmong metal supports, Pt is widely recognized as a versatile catalyst and nds extensive use in both experimental studies and industrial applications. It serves as a cocatalyst in various photocatalytic reduction reactions, including water splitting for hydrogen production,49\u201352 CO2 reduction,53\u201355 and NO3\n\u2212 reduction processes.56\u201358 Additionally, Pt is extensively employed in electrocatalytic NO3\n\u2212 reduction processes aimed at producing NH3. Previous studies by Dima and Figueiredo, as well as their colleagues, demonstrated the catalytic activity of pure Pt electrodes in the reduction of NO3\n\u2212 in acidic solutions, proposing adsorbed NO as the reactive intermediate in NH3 formation.57,58 Moreover, Cerron-Calle et al. achieved a remarkably high NH3 selectivity of 94% by utilizing alloyed CuPt catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3\n\u2212 reduction.56 Considering Pt's excellent ability to provide surface-active H* in photocatalysis and catalyze NO3 \u2212 reduction in electrocatalysis, it is reasonable to speculate that Pt/ZrO2 would serve as an excellent model system for investigating the photocatalytic reduction of NO3\n\u2212 to NH3. Although signicant experimental progress has been made in the eld of nitrate reduction to ammonia, there are still gaps in our understanding of the underlying mechanistic details, rate-determining steps, and catalyst regulation strategies. One particular area of debate revolves around the conversion of nitric oxide (NO) into ammonia (NH3), which is considered a crucial intermediate in the process. Clayborne et al. proposed a pathway where NH3 is formed through the intermediate NOH*. According to their suggested mechanism, the favorable\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Their proposed pathway starts with the conversion of NO to HNO, then H2NO, and nally NH3.60 Additionally, Cuesta et al. put forward the idea that the intermediate HNOH* plays a pivotal role in NO reduction, suggesting a pathway of NO to NOH (HNO), then HNOH, and ultimately NH3.61\nClearly, there is ongoing debate and multiple proposed pathways for the conversion of NO to NH3 in nitrate reduction. To improve the efficiency of this process, it is imperative to dedicate further efforts towards understanding the complete reaction mechanism, including the energetics and intermediates involved. Advancements in this area will contribute to rening the catalyst design and optimization strategies, ultimately leading to enhanced nitrate reduction efficiency and the production of valuable ammonia.\nThus, in this context, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the process of NO3\n\u2212 reduction to NH3 on a Pt nanoparticle (PtNP)/ZrO2 composite model. Our previous research (under review) involved extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, which allowed us to determine the PtNP/ZrO2(111) composite structures (Fig. S2\u2020).62 Based on the stability, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and water-splitting reaction (WSR) activities, Pt11/ZrO2 was chosen for current study. First, we examined the reaction energetics of various elementary steps within different potential pathways of NO3\n\u2212 reduction. Through this analysis, we identied the most favorable pathway and determined the rate-determining steps. Next, we explored the effect of charge density modulation on the NO3\n\u2212 reduction activity by manipulating the PtNP's charge density on the ZrO2 support. By understanding the trend in activity variation, we proposed a strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of PtNP/ZrO2 by doping ZrO2 with a suitable element, such as Fe and Co. This proposed modication was supported by our calculated results, which indicated a signicant reduction in reaction barriers and an increase in energy gains. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the NO3\n\u2212 reduction mechanism on PtNP/ZrO2 catalysts, offering a potential avenue for improving catalytic performance through targeted modications. The ndings from this study will contribute to the understanding and development of advanced catalyst materials for efficient NO3 reduction, with potential applications in automotive emission control systems and industrial processes. Ultimately, the utilization of Pt nanoparticle-based ZrO2 catalysts holds promise for mitigating the adverse effects of NO3/ NO2 pollution and promoting cleaner and healthier environments."

The van der Waals (vdW) interactions were accounted by using Grimme's third-generation dispersion correction together with Becke\u2013Johnson damping function (D3BJ).68 The Pt11/ZrO2 structure was chosen for this investigation based on the results presented in our previous study which explored the effect of size of nanoparticle size on the catalytic activity determining Pt11 to be the optimal nanoparticle size.62 The size of nanoparticles can signicantly inuence catalyst activity. Smaller nanoparticles may have fewer active sites, potentially limiting their catalytic efficiency, while larger nanoparticles might suffer from decreased charge transfer efficiency, potentially hindering their performance due to increased surface recombination. Our ndings suggest that Pt11/ZrO2 strikes a balance between these factors. It provides an adequate surface area with numerous active sites, facilitates efficient charge transfer, andminimizes surface recombination, yielding the best catalyst activity.\nFor geometry optimizations, a maximum gradient threshold of 0.03 eV \u00c5\u22121 was employed. The convergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent loop were 10\u22126 eV which is benchmark in many studies. Relativistic effects, including spin\u2013orbit coupling, were considered using the zero-order regular approximation (ZORA) method. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to represent the repeating unit cell structure, with a (111) surface model constructed using a 3 \u00d7 3 supercell containing two ZrO2 trilayers (O\u2013Zr\u2013O layer). A vacuum spacing of 15 \u00c5 was set between the slabs, and a Monkhorst\u2013Pack scheme with a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 k-point sampling was used to sample the Brillouin zone.69 Dipole correction was applied in all calculations. The bottom ZrO2 trilayer was held xed at its bulk positions, while the top ZrO2 trilayer and the adsorbents were allowed to fully relax to reach their equilibrium structures. To determine the stable representative conguration of Pt11 cluster on ZrO2, we employed AIMD simulations. The simulations utilized Nose\u0301\u2013Hoover thermostats in the canonical (NVT) ensemble for over 20 ps, achieving equilibrium around 10 ps. Structural congurations were selected at 1 ps intervals from the equilibrated trajectory and fully optimized to minimize all forces. Out of 10 potential structural candidates, we determined optimal Pt11/ZrO2 structures based on their lowest energy.\nTransition states associated with the water-splitting reactions were determined by systematically exploring the potential energy surface (PES) along the relevant reaction coordinates. The PES was scanned to identify the highest energy point, which was then optimized to obtain the transition state structure.70 The forces threshold for the transition state search was set to 0.05 eV \u00c5\u22121. To validate the transition states, it was ensured that they exhibited only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate.71,72 The vibrational modes were calculated using similar methods as for optimizations.

We positioned the Na+ cation of the NaNO3 molecule uniformly on the opposite (bottom) layer of the ZrO2 slab and allowed it to relax (Fig. 1 and S1\u2020). Bader charge calculations (Table S1\u2020) reveal that the Pt11 cluster possesses an overall positive charge of +0.72 jej, with an average charge of +0.067 jej on each Pt atom within the cluster. When negatively charged NO3\n\u2212 species are introduced, the total charge decreases by 0.48 jej, leading to a net charge of \u22120.22 jej on the cluster. This charge is subsequently neutralized by the presence of Na+ ions, restoring the total charge to +0.72 jej. In essence, the cluster's charge is initially reduced by the introduction of NO3\n\u2212, but it returns to its original positive state due to the compensating effect of Na+ ions. Based on the adsorption\n34500 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509\nenergies and stability of various adsorption congurations of NO3\n\u2212 on different adsorption sites, we identied the most stable adsorption structure for NO3 \u2212 (Eads (NO3 \u2212) = \u22121.52 eV) relative to a desorbed NO3 \u2212 in the gas phase, with Na+ positioned on the opposite layer which is presented in Fig. 1. In this adsorption conguration, NO3\n\u2212 forms specic bonds with Zr atoms on the ZrO2 surface. Two O\u2013Pt (O\n1\u2013Pt1 and O2\u2013 Pt1) bonds were formed with the same Pt atom, with bond lengths of 2.196 \u00c5 and 2.461 \u00c5, respectively. Furthermore, considering the unique properties of the ZrO2 surface, such as its high thermal stability and acid\u2013base characteristics, we simulated the subsequent reduction of NO3\n\u2212 under conditions where reactive hydrogen species (H*) are adequately available on the ZrO2 surface in the form of water molecules which release protons.\n3.1. *NO3 \u2212 reduction to *NO2 We investigated the process of *NO3 \u2212 reduction to *NO2 by analyzing three possible pathways for breaking the rst N\u2013O bond in NO3\n\u2212* (as shown in Fig. 2). The rst pathway is direct NO*3 dissociation (referred to as direct NO3\n\u2212 dis., represented by the red curve). In this pathway, *NO3\n\u2212 dissociates directly into *NO2 and *O by overcoming an energy barrier of 0.76 eV, with a signicant exothermic reaction energy of \u22120.67 eV. The second pathway, denoted as O2N\u2013OH* dissociation (HO\u2013NO2 dis., represented by the blue curve), involves the capture of a hydrogen specie (H*) by *NO3 to form *O2N\u2013OH on the surface of the catalyst. Importantly, the rst hydrogenation steps are mostly characterized by an extremely low energy requirement, rendering it spontaneous. Subsequently, the formed O2N\u2013OH* species dissociates into NO2* and OH* with a barrier of 0.62 eV, accompanied by a substantial energy release of \u22120.94 eV.\nO3 on Pt11/ZrO2 composite.

It was observed that the distance of the breaking N\u2013O bond in the direct NO3 direct dissociation pathway (*O2N/O: 1.765 \u00c5) is signicantly longer compared to that in the HO\u2013NO2 dissociation pathway (*O2N/ OH2: 1.481 \u00c5). Based on both the reaction energetics and the transition-state structures, it can be concluded that the H*assisted HO\u2013O2N dissociation pathway is more favorable (0.37 vs. 0.76 eV) than the direct NO3 dissociation pathway on the ZrO2 surface. The calculated difference in the activation energies between both pathways is probably due to the fact that the transition states (*O2N/OH2: 1.481 \u00c5) found in O2N\u2013OH dissociation pathway are early transition states because they resemble more the reactants and according to the Hammond postulate the early transition states are generally characteristic of fast exothermic reactions.73 On the other hand, the transition states (*O2N/O: 1.765 \u00c5) found in the NO3 direct dissociation\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509 | 34501\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This nding is consistent with previous reports indicating the preference for the H*-assisted pathway in the reduction of *NO3.74,75\n3.2. *NO2 reduction to *NO\nThe pathways for the dissociation of the second N\u2013O bond in NO2 were investigated next. Three possible routes were considered: the NO2 direct dissociation pathway, and two H*assisted dissociation pathways, as depicted in Fig. 3. In the NO2 direct dissociation pathway (red curve), breaking the N\u2013O bond requires overcoming a substantial energy barrier of 1.17 eV. Although the formation of *NO and O* releases energy (\u22120.28 eV), the initial bond breaking step is energetically demanding. In the *H-assisted dissociation pathways, we explored the\nFig. 3 (Top) reaction energy profile for the conversion pathway of NO2 i NO2 direct dissociation.

ZrO2 layers are represented by\n34502 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509\ninvolvement of H* in facilitating the dissociation process. It was observed that the O-end of NO2* readily captures H* and forms *NO\u2013OH on the Pt surface with a small energy change of 0.09 eV. Subsequently, the dissociation of *NO\u2013OH into *NO and *OH occurs with a large barrier of 0.68 eV and a signicant energy release of \u22120.56 eV. The overall pathway is calculated to be exothermic with a large free energy of the reaction of \u22120.65 eV.\nA third possible pathway involves the capture of a second proton by the *NO\u2013OH species that is formed in the second pathway, leading to the formation of a water molecule called *NO\u2013OH2. In the subsequent step, the water molecule (H2O) undergoes detachment, with a reaction energy barrier of 0.42 eV, as it passes through the transition state *NO/H2O. This step is calculated to be exothermic, releasing an energy of 0.30 eV. Overall, this pathway exhibits a signicant energy\nnto NO.

Based on the energy proles in Fig. 3, it is evident that the most favorable pathway for the reduction of *NO2 involves the sequential steps of *NO2 + *H2/ *ON\u2013OH2 + */ *NO + *OH2. This pathway, which generates NO* as a key intermediate, is consistent with experimental ndings reported by Chen et al.76\nDuring the NO3 \u2212 reduction process, the hydrogenation of *NO2 plays a crucial role in the overall reaction. This hydrogenation occurs through an interesting mechanism known as the hydrogen shuttling model (HSM), wherein hydrogen is transferred via a nearby water molecule, acting as a bridge between *NO2 and surface H*. This unique mechanism, allows for efficient hydrogenation reactions, however, in our case, the H is adsorbed on the surface quite strongly and hence can't be abstracted easily by the water molecule. Thus, the transition states could not be located for HSM mechanism. Therefore, we adopted the direct hydrogenation mechanism as the preferred approach for calculating the reaction energetics of hydrogenation steps in our work. This choice allows for a more accurate understanding of the hydrogenation reactions involved in the NO3\n\u2212 reduction on the ZrO2 surface, enhancing our insights into the overall reaction mechanism and aiding in the development of efficient catalysts for nitrate reduction.\n3.3. NO* reduction to *NH3\nIn order to elucidate the mechanism and address the conicting views regarding the conversion of NO* to NH3 in experiments, we conducted comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore all possible pathways of NO* reduction to NH3 with an aim to gain insights into the intricate pathways involved in this reduction process and determine the\nFig. 4 Reaction energy profile for the conversion pathway of *NO into * NO2 direct dissociation.

The reduction of NO* to NH3 primarily entails two fundamental types of reactions: deoxygenation, involving the removal of oxygen, and nitrogen hydrogenation. The key challenge lies in determining the most favorable sequence of deoxygenation and hydrogenation steps. In Fig. 4, we present a summarized diagram illustrating the calculated energetics of the potential elementary steps, and the corresponding structures are presented in Fig. 5. Each of the four possible pathways is discussed below.\n3.3.1 Direct NO* dissociation pathway. The direct dissociation of NO* into N* and O* exhibits a high energy barrier of 1.32 eV (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the N* species can be sequentially hydrogenated to NH3*. Notably, the NHx* species (x= 1, 2) preferentially captures a hydrogen atom directly to form NHx+1* rather than via the hydrogen shuttling mechanism (HSM). The rst hydrogenation of N* to *NH proceeds with a release of 0.14 eV of energy. Subsequent hydrogenation from *NH / *NH2 / *NH3 proceeds with activation energy barriers of 0.13 eV and 0.38 eV, respectively.\n3.3.2 HN\u2013O* dissociation pathway. The nitrogen end of NO* tends to undergo hydrogenation, forming HNO* via direct proton transfer with an exothermic reaction energy of \u22120.16 eV. However, the N\u2013O bond in HNO* remains signicantly strong, requiring a large dissociation reaction barrier of 0.91 eV to generate NH* and O*. Both of these product species remain attached to the Pt surface.\n3.3.3 H2N\u2013O* dissociation pathway. In contrast, when the nitrogen end of NO* is doubly hydrogenated to form H2N\u2013O, the subsequent cleavage of N\u2013O bond in H2N\u2013O becomes easier requiring a relatively smaller activation energy barrier of 0.48 eV comparing with larger D\u2021G of 0.91 and 1.32 eV in HN\u2013O* dissociation and direct NO* dissociation pathways, respectively.\nN + O*.

The hydrogenation of the oxygen end in HNO* proceeds with a minimal barrier of 0.13 eV, forming the HNOH* intermediate. Subsequently, the N\u2013O bond in HN\u2013OH* can be broken, leading to the formation of *NH and *OH species with a comparable (with H2N\u2013O* dissociation pathway requiring 0.48 eV) energy barrier of 0.46 eV and releasing a large energy of \u22120.81 eV. Although, this is apparently a more favourable pathway for the cleavage of N\u2013O bond, however, the hydrogenation of O-end also requires a small barrier of 0.18 eV which is signicantly lower in case of hydrogenation of N-end of NO. Finally, two successive hydrogenation steps can convert NH* into NH3*.\n3.3.5 N\u2013OH* dissociation pathway. Alternatively, the hydrogenation of NO* can occur through the oxygen end. The resulting NOH* species can either break the N\u2013OH bond to form N* and OH* with a large energy barrier of 0.72 eV and an energy release of \u22120.68 eV or the N-end of N\u2013OH undergo hydrogenation and then follow the NH\u2013OH* dissociation\n34504 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34497\u201334509\npathway which requires a smaller reaction barrier (0.46 vs. 0.72) to break the N\u2013O bond compared to this pathway.\nThus, based on the above discussion and comparing the relative stability of intermediates, and products and the reaction energy barriers, the most favorable pathway for the cleavage of N\u2013O bond and conversion on PtNP/ZrO2 is either *NO / *NOH / HNOH* / HN + OH* or NO* / *ONH / H2NO* / H2N* + O*. The two calculated pathways compete with each requiring activation energy of 0.46 and 0.48 eV, respectively with comparable reaction exothermicity (0.66 vs. 0.59 eV). The calculated pathways are consistent with the nitrate reduction mechanism reported on the Pd surface by Shin et al.77\n3.3.6 Overall picture. The most favorable overall pathway is presented in Fig. 6. The rate-determining step in this study is determined to be the cleavage of the N\u2013O bond, which demands the highest activation energy. Among the potential pathways, direct NO dissociation stands as an unfavorable option due to its signicantly elevated activation energy of 1.32 eV. In contrast, the more feasible route involves N\u2013O bond cleavage\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Alternatively, when the nitrogen end of the NO group is initially hydrogenated, succeeded by N\u2013O bond cleavage, NHx (x= 1, 2) species emerge. The rst hydrogenation step at the nitrogen end occurs spontaneously, devoid of a barrier, while the second hydrogenation step demands a modest energy input of 0.24 eV, resulting in the creation of *O\u2013NHx (x = 1, 2) intermediates. Subsequently, the rupture of the N\u2013O bond in the formed *ONH2 intermediate requires an activation energy of 0.48 eV. A third pathway, in which both the nitrogen and oxygen ends of NO are rst hydrogenated, followed by N\u2013O bond cleavage, presents an activation energy barrier of 0.46 eV. Consequently, the three pathways compete based on the activation energy barrier for the rate-determining step: N\u2013O bond cleavage requiring 0.59, 0.48, and 0.46 eV for the rst, second, and third pathways, respectively. The second and third pathways emerge as the most favorable options, with the third path exhibiting a slightly smaller activation energy barrier for N\u2013O cleavage, thus holding particular promise.\nTo provide a comprehensive understanding of the NO3 \u2212 reductionmechanism to NH3 on the catalyst surface, we present the complete pathway in Fig. 6. It is evident that the overall process is highly exothermic, indicating that the reaction releases a signicant amount of energy. Throughout the mechanism, we observe four notable energy barriers, as indicated by the red arrows.\nThe initial hydrogenation of N is energetically favorable without any barriers. The process of breaking the N\u2013O in *Nx\u2013 OHx (x = 0, 1, 2) intermediates leading to the formation of both *NHx and *OHx (x = 0, 1, 2) species requires signicantly lower barriers. The resulting NHx (x = 0, 1, 2) intermediate then undergoes hydrogenation to ultimately yield ammonia (*NH3). Thus, considering the small reaction barriers and the large thermodynamic driving force, the production of *NH is\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nexpected to be a facile process. However, the subsequent hydrogenation step, *NH2 + H / *NH3, however, requires energy barriers of 0.86 eV. The large energy barrier for the hydrogenation leading to the formation of *NH3 corresponds to the most energetically demanding steps in the entire mechanism and is, therefore, considered the rate-determining step (Fig. 6) in the formation of NH3 aer the cleavage of N\u2013O bond. These ndings suggest that the hydrogenation of NH2* on the Pt surface is challenging, consistent with previous reports in the literature.78,79 Breaking the N\u2013O bond in NO onmetal surfaces is known to have a notably high activation barrier, around 1.7 eV.80\u201382 This means that under typical electro- and photochemical conditions, it is practically impossible to initiate this dissociation process. However, when NO is partially hydrogenated to form NOH*, the activation barrier to break the N\u2013O bond is signicantly lower, at approximately 0.9 eV. As further hydrogenation occurs, the activation barrier for dissociating HNOH* is even more reduced, reaching about 0.7 eV.59,80\u201383 In simpler terms, the process becomes easier as you add hydrogen atoms. Notably, our calculated results demonstrate signicantly lower activation energy barriers compared to those reported in the literature. Precisely, our calculations indicate that the direct N\u2013O dissociation requires approximately 0.76\u20131.32 eV, and as the degree of hydrogenation increases, the activation energy barriers decrease further to approximately 0.62\u20130.98 eV for NH\u2013 OH intermediates and 0.37\u20130.42 eV for NO\u2013OH2 intermediates. These results are in line with those reported in literature, including the initial hydrogenation steps requiring very little energy.59,80\u201384"

This charge redistribution signicantly impacts the catalytic performance of the deposited Pt metal.88,89 To modulate this metal-support interaction and alter the charge density of the Pt particles, we propose the promising approach of doping the ZrO2 support with low-valence-state metals, that is, iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co).\nBy substituting Zr4+ cations with Fe2+ and Co2+ ions in the ZrO2 lattice, we can effectively modify the charge distribution in the PtNP/ZrO2 system. This strategic modication aims to induce electron density depletion in both the ZrO2 support and the Pt cocatalyst, ultimately enhancing charge transfer and separation processes, which are crucial for improved catalytic activity. Experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this doping approach in enhancing the catalytic performance of ZrO2-based catalysts.90\u201394 Introducing Fe or Co into the ZrO2 lattice promotes electron density depletion in the Pt cocatalyst, leading to more efficient charge transfer and enhanced catalytic activity. Bader charge analyses indicate that the introduction of Fe2+ and Co2+ dopant ions cause the Pt11 cluster to gain a charge of +0.54 jej and +0.46 jej, respectively, compared to the undoped Pt11/ZrO2 (See Table 1 in SI).\nTo investigate the impact of Fe and Co doping on the PtNP/ ZrO2 catalyst, we constructed model catalysts, denoted as Fe #1\u2013 Pt/ZrO2 and Co #1\u2013Pt/ZrO2, where Fe or Co was introduced as dopants, presented in Fig. 7. The dopants were placed away from the Pt cluster to focus solely on charge density regulation without introducing other effects. The dopants were placed at two other positions as well denoted as Fe/Co#2\u2013Pt/ZrO2 and Fe/ Co#3\u2013Pt/ZrO2 and so on, as presented in Fig. S3,\u2020 however, this change of doping position has a negligible effect on the energetics.\nTo validate the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a thorough investigation of the energetics associated with key steps in the catalytic cycle, specically focusing on the *NO3 dissociation, and *NH2 hydrogenation processes. We compared the results for the undoped Pt11 catalyst with those of the doped catalysts, Fe#1\u2013Pt/ZrO2 and Co\n#1\u2013Pt/ZrO2. Our analysis revealed that the *NO3 dissociation over Fe #1\u2013Pt/ZrO2 and Co #1\u2013Pt/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited similar energetics to the undoped Pt11\ncatalyst. This implies that the introduction of Fe or Co dopants had minimal impact on the *NO3 dissociation step. However, a signicant improvement in the reaction barriers and energies was observed for the *NH2 hydrogenation steps, which are the rate-determining steps in the catalytic cycle, upon Fe and Co doping. The incorporation of Fe or Co dopants led to a promotion of approximately 0.20 eV in the energetics of the *NH2 hydrogenation steps, resulting in a more favorable and efficient catalytic process.\nThe observed improvements in the *NH2 hydrogenation step upon Fe and Co doping provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of our rational design. The introduction of Fe or Co dopants into the ZrO2 support induces electron density depletion in the Pt cocatalyst, facilitating the delivery of hydrogen to H-acceptor intermediates during the hydrogenation process, thereby promoting the overall catalytic activity. Importantly, similar reductions in hydrogen adsorption energy have been observed over other positively charged metals, such as Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Rh, corroborating the general principle for enhancing hydrogenation activity through charge density modulation.95 It is crucial to note that due to the promotional effects of Fe and Co doping, the rate-determining *NH2 hydrogenation step exhibits a relatively reduced energy barrier of 0.69 eV. This reduction underscores the effectiveness of doping in facilitating efficient hydrogenation during the nitrate-toammonia conversion over Pt-based catalysts. These ndings emphasize the potential for enhanced catalytic performance and more sustainable ammonia production through the strategic use of doping techniques.\nIn the realm of catalysis, it is established that the coverage effect holds the potential to modify the bonding characteristics through interactions between adsorbed molecules. This phenomenon can notably inuence the overall catalytic activity, particularly when dealing with materials that possess a substantial coverage of intermediate species.96 In our study, we have also investigated the potential impact of the coverage effect on nitrate reduction, particularly focusing on the key ratedetermining intermediate *NH2. To assess the inuence of adjacent *NH2 on the surface, we calculated the reaction energetics of crucial processes involving dissociation and hydrogenation. By comparing the energetics obtained in the absence and presence of coadsorbed *NH2, to explore the possible consequences of the coverage effect. The results, as shown in Table S2,\u2020 revealed several important ndings. Firstly, for both *NO3 and *NO2 dissociation, the optimal pathway remains unchanged, occurring via the intermediates *NO2\u2013H2O and *NO\u2013OH rather than through direct dissociation. Secondly, although *NH2 hydrogenation is mildly inhibited by the presence of neighboring *NH2, the critical rate-determining *NH2 hydrogenation step exhibits a notable effect, with a reduced barrier height of 0.11 eV and an increase in reaction energy by \u22120.13 eV (Table S2\u2020). These ndings suggest that the reaction mechanism may not be signicantly altered when considering the coverage effect, and moreover, improved activity can be anticipated due to the enhanced energetics of the ratedetermining step at high coverage. Regarding the formation of byproducts, our results indicate that the key intermediates\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The following major conclusions were drawn:\n(I) We identied the most favorable pathway for H*-assisted NO3 reduction on PtNP/ZrO2 as *NO3 / *NO2 / *NO / *ONH / *ONH2/HNOH / *NH2/NH / *NH2 / *NH3. Among the various reaction dissociation pathways, the cleavage of N\u2013O bond and *NH2 hydrogenation were found to have the highest barriers of 0.45 and 0.69 eV upon metal doping, respectively, indicating that N\u2013O cleavage and *NH2 hydrogenation are the rate-determining steps of the overall pathway.\n(II) We observed distinct trends in the reaction energetics of dissociation and hydrogenation steps signicantly inuenced by metal-support interaction, driving charge redistribution at the interface. In light of this, we proposed a novel approach to modulate this metal-support interaction and to deplete the electron density of Pt by introducing low-valence-state metals, namely iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co), into the ZrO2 support.\n(III) We validated the effectiveness of the design strategy by demonstrating a signicant promotion of approximately 0.20 eV in both the reaction barriers and energies of the ratedetermining *NH2 hydrogenation steps for Fe\u2013Pt/ZrO2 or Co\u2013 Pt/ZrO2 compared to undoped PtNP/ZrO2. This was attributed to the depletion of electron density within the Pt cocatalyst resulting in enhanced delivery of hydrogen to H-acceptor intermediates during the hydrogenation process, contributing to improved catalytic activity.\nThis study provides valuable insights into the catalytic activity of platinum-based ZrO2 catalysts and their potential for reducing atmospheric pollutants, particularly NO3, to valuable ammonia.
