Valence and arousal are fundamental, and a key question\u2013the focus of the present study\u2013is the relationship between them. Valence is sometimes thought to be independent of arousal, but, in some studies (representing too few societies in the world) arousal was found to vary with valence. One common finding is that arousal is lowest at neutral valence and increases with both positive and negative valence: a symmetric Vshaped relationship. In the study reported here of self-reported affect during a remembered moment (N = 8,590), we tested the valence-arousal relationship in 33 societies with 25 different languages. The two most common hypotheses in the literature\u2013independence and a symmetric V-shaped relationship\u2013were not supported. With data of all samples pooled, arousal increased with positive but not negative valence. Valence accounted for between 5% (Finland) and 43% (China Beijing) of the variance in arousal. Although there is evidence for a structural relationship between the two, there is also a large amount of variability in this relation.\nKeywords: valence, arousal, subjective experience, structure of affect, culture"

Yet, psychology has not achieved an agreed upon descriptive structure of affect. Valence and arousal have often been identified as fundamental properties of affect, but the relationship between the two has not been agreed upon or examined across the globe. The present study focuses on momentary affect. We asked, in 33 different samples, two basic questions: How are valence and arousal related to each other in subjective experience? Does this relationship vary across societies? The study examined these questions by asking participants to report their feelings in \u201ca clearest moment\u201d during the previous day."

            "text": "Valence (also known as pleasure-displeasure or hedonic tone) is an elementary dimension of conscious affective feeling (Reisenzein, 1992; Wundt, 1897/1998) and the most commonly found fundamental property of affect (Larsen & Diener, 1992; Yik et al., 1999, 2002, 2011) \u2013 indeed, sometimes the only factor found in self-reports of affect (Williams et al., 1989). Still, controversy remains as to whether valence is one bipolar dimension or two separate dimensions (for progress on this issue, see Larsen et al., 2001; Russell, 2017; Russell & Carroll, 1999; Yik, 2007). Arousal (also known as activation, energy, or tension) often emerges as a second factor in self-reported affect (Yik et al., 2002) and was prominent in earlier psychological writings (e.g., Berlyne, 1960; Cannon, 1927; Schachter & Singer, 1962). Self-reported arousal is related to a range of factors from food to personality to neurochemistry (Thayer, 1989)."

            "text": "How valence and arousal are related to each other has received less attention, but is essential, nonetheless. There are hints that arousal increases with intensity of both positive and negative valence in certain conditions. For instance, arousal is a V-shaped function of valence in studies of visual scenes (Lang, 1994; Mattek\net al., 2017), in some emotion lexicons ( Coso et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2017), and in sentiment analysis of social media data (Chen & Yik, 2022). Perhaps the V-shape occurs generally in all subjective experience. Alternatively, the valence-arousal relationship might vary with domain, or with culture and language, or with individuals. When attempting to map valence to certain brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and arousal to other regions such as the amygdala, researchers have reported inconsistent findings across studies (Colibazzi et al., 2010; Lindquist et al., 2012; Posner et al., 2009). Any variability in the valence-arousal relationship might explain this inconsistency in studies of the neural basis of affect. In short, the valence-arousal relationship in self-reported subjective experience needs to be better understood. Several relationships between valence and arousal in self-reported affect have been suggested and tested (Kuppens et al., 2013, 2017). Prominent theoretical models are displayed in Figure 1.\nModel 1: Independence\nValence is often assumed to be independent of arousal in selfreported affect (e.g., Barrett & Russell, 1999; Carver & Scheier, 1990; Larsen & Diener, 1992; Yik et al., 2011). In this model, how pleasant or unpleasant one is feeling provides no information about how aroused one is feeling and vice versa.\nModel 2: Linear Relation\nA second model posits a linear relationship, i.e., in the extreme, valence equals arousal. On one version of this model\u2013positive correlation version\u2013affect is one dimension ranging from sadness (negative valence, low arousal) to excitement (positive valence, high arousal). An interesting possibility is that this model applies mainly to Western societies as reflected in a preference for highly aroused pleasant affect (Tsai et al., 2006).\nThe alternative version of this model\u2013negative correlation version\u2013is that affect is one dimension ranging from tension (negative valence, high arousal) to calmness (positive valence, low arousal). This model was assumed in the psychoanalytic theory in which pleasure was thought to originate from the release of tension and in the behaviorist theory that reinforcement is the reduction of drive. An interesting possibility is that this model applies mainly to Asian societies as reflected in a preference for deactivated pleasant affect (Tsai et al., 2006).\nModel 3: Symmetric V-Shaped Relation\nIn this model, arousal is minimal at neutral valence and then increases with (or is) the intensity of positive and, separately, of negative valence. The relation is symmetric with positive and negative valence having an equal intercept on the arousal axis and slope values equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Model 3 is commonly thought of as the V-shaped relationship shown in Figure 1. Here, we also allow Model 3 to include an inverted Vshaped relationship. Model 3 resonates with Gray\u2019s (1987) theory of two independent motivational systems\u2013behavioral activation and inhibition\u2013in which arousal is the intensity of each system and with Thayer\u2019s (1989) theory of two different types of arousal, one positive and one negative.\nModels 4\u20136: Asymmetric V-Shaped Relation\nModels 4 through 6 are based on the evaluative space model (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994). These models are similar to Model 3, but with asymmetries. Model 4 adds a positivity offset: positive valence begins at a higher level of arousal than does negative valence. That is, the curves for positive and negative valence have different intercepts on the arousal axis.\nModel 5 adds a different asymmetry: differences in the slopes for positive versus negative valence. For instance, Ito and Cacioppo (2005) argued that arousal increases more strongly with negative valence than it does with positive valence (something that they called negativity bias). The opposite can in principle also occur, namely that arousal increases more strongly with positive valence. Both intercept and slope asymmetries appear in Model 6.\nVALENCE AND AROUSAL IN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE 3\nT hi s do cu m en ti s co py ri gh te d by\nth e A m er ic an\nPs yc ho lo gi ca lA\nss oc ia tio\nn or\non e of\nits al lie d pu bl is he rs .\nT hi s ar tic le is in te nd ed\nso le ly\nfo r th e pe rs on al us e of\nth e in di vi du al us er\nan d is no tt o be\ndi ss em\nin at ed\nbr oa dl y.\nCultural Variations in the Valence-Arousal Relationship\nIn addition to the different theoretical models, the empirical evidence in favor of or against these models has been inconsistent as well (see Kuppens et al., 2013, for a detailed discussion). Part of this inconsistency may arise because the relation between valence and arousal may differ with the stimulus condition, with the culture or language, or even with the person examined. Indeed, Kuppens et al. (2013) tested the six theoretical models by deploying multilevel regression models that incorporate both a nomothetic (i.e., population) structure and idiographic variations in the nomothetic structure (i.e., individual differences modeled as random effects). They found support for asymmetric V-shaped relationships (Models 5 and 6) in eight samples of English speakers at the nomothetic level, but the relationship at the population level was weak and showed large variations at the idiographic level, implying perhaps the valence-arousal relationship can vary from one sample to the next. To complement the data from English-speaking societies, Kuppens et al. (2017) examined data from another five societies. In contrast to prior findings, Kuppens et al. supported a symmetric Vshaped relationship (Model 3) in all but Hong Kong (Model 1). The slope was steepest for Western cultures (Canada, Spain) but\nless steep (Japan, Korea) to almost flat (Hong Kong) for Eastern cultures.\nClearly more cross-cultural data are needed. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to test the six models on a large crosscultural network involving 33 samples. They span six continents and cover the global regions identified by Schwartz (2006)."

Valence and arousal have been measured in various ways such as with the SelfAssessment Manikin (Bradley & Lang, 2007) or the Affect Grid (Russell et al., 1989). Kuppens et al. (2013) used items tapping pleasure, displeasure, high arousal, and low arousal. In the present study, we adopted Kuppens et al.\u2019s method by asking the participants to report their affect using affect items covering pleasant, unpleasant, activated, and deactivated. We then tested structural invariance of the two constructs, namely valence (defined by pleasant and unpleasant items) and arousal (defined by activated and deactivated items), across the 33 samples.\nThe instructions for self-reported affect in the past studies have been problematic. Sometimes, the participant was asked about his\nFigure 1 Six Possible Relations Between Valence and Arousal\nNote. Model 1 is the independence model: Valence is independent of arousal. In Model 2, a linear relation is assumed allowing for valence to increase linearly with arousal. Model 3 assumes a symmetric V-shaped relation so that arousal may increase with the intensity of positive, and separately, of negative valence. Model 4 permits an asymmetric relation with different intercepts so that positive valence may begin at a higher level of arousal than does negative valence. In Model 5, an asymmetric V-shaped relation with different slopes is assumed; arousal may increase more strongly with negative compared with positive valence or vice versa. Model 6 combines Models 4 and 5 resulting in an asymmetric V-shaped relation with different intercepts and different slopes."

Participants were sometimes asked to rate their feelings during a specific type of remembered episode or their reactions to a set of stimuli such as tunes or pictures; such ratings have restricted variance and likely lack the social complexity of everyday life. In other cases, participants simply responded to a questionnaire, with questions such as \u201cHow are you feeling right now?.\u201d The variance in such ratings is likely restricted because all participants are in the same circumstance, such as filling out a questionnaire, or perhaps sitting in a boring lab. Here we focus on momentary affect. To capture everyday momentary feelings, experience sampling would be ideal, although it can be costly becoming a stumbling block to large-scale cross-cultural projects. An alternative to experience sampling is to measure affect in a broader range of moments. In the present study, a \u201cremembered moments\u201d questionnaire (RMQ) was used in which participants recalled a clear moment from the day before (see Yik et al., 2002; see the day Reconstruction Method developed by Kahneman et al., 2004). The moments from the RMQ method are likely to be varied and representative of experiences outside the lab. Of course, memory is fallible, and so the RMQ is designed to have the participant select a well-remembered moment."

A standardized translation and back-translation procedure was used to prepare different language versions. For each language, we recruited two bilinguals; the first bilingual translated the English items into the target language and the second bilingual independently back-translated the items into English. Discrepancies between the original and back-translated English versions were identified, discussed, and reconciled.\nParticipants were asked to complete nine questionnaires including the one reported in this article; average completion time was 35 min. Most data were collected online using Qualtrics (25 samples), with a few samples using the paper-pencil method (four samples), or both methods (four samples).

Another 48 were eliminated because they used the same response option for all items for at least two of the nine questionnaires.\n4 Male and female versions were developed for the affect measure in 14 of 25 languages where there are masculine and feminine adjectives.\nVALENCE AND AROUSAL IN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE 5\nT hi s do cu m en ti s co py ri gh te d by\nth e A m er ic an\nPs yc ho lo gi ca lA\nss oc ia tio\nn or\non e of\nits al lie d pu bl is he rs .\nT hi s ar tic le is in te nd ed\nso le ly\nfo r th e pe rs on al us e of\nth e in di vi du al us er\nan d is no tt o be\ndi ss em\nin at ed\nbr oa dl y.\n(multilevel) model that allows for these dominant patterns across all participants from all samples (N = 8,590). This model allows us to identify what an overall, pancultural relation between valence and arousal would look like, how much of the total variance such a pancultural model could explain the degree to which each sample might deviate from this overall model.\nStep 1: Measurement Invariance\nTo evaluate the invariance of measures for valence and arousal across the 33 samples, we tested configural invariance (factor loadings and intercepts freely estimated across groups) and metric invariance (factor loadings constrained to be equal across groups) to ensure the meaning of the latent construct was equal across groups. For details of the procedure, please refer to the online Supplemental Materials 3. Figure 2 presents the final model consisting of 11 items with two correlated residuals. The model fit of the metric invariance model was compared with the configural model. Metric invariance across the samples is indicated when imposing invariant factor loadings leads to no more than .02 decrease in comparative fit index (CFI), no more than .03 increase in root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Rutkowski & Svetina, 2014), and no more than .02 increase in standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; Chen, 2007). The changes of the fit measures between the two models were small (DCFI = .018, DRMSEA = .003, DSRMR = .033) indicating that the factor loadings are equal across groups and thus metric invariance holds. Therefore, the comparison of the linear valence-arousal relation across the samples can be carried out. Significant positive covariances were observed in all 33 samples, with covariances ranging from .19 (Finland) to .86 (Indonesia) in the metric invariance model. For details, please refer to the online Supplemental Materials 4 and 5. This step resulted in the identification of the items to define a valence score and an arousal score per participant.\nStep 2: Calculation of the Final Valence and Arousal"

            "text": "The theoretical and mathematical models used to capture the various possible relations between valence and arousal make use of a neutral valence midpoint (forming the deflection point of any asymmetric relation). Consequently, it was not possible to use the factor scores from the abovementioned final factor analytic model\nas input for the analyses modeling the relation between valence and arousal, as the point at which the factor scores equal zero cannot be assumed to reflect neutral valence. To circumvent this problem, using the 11 items in Figure 2, we calculated valence and arousal scores per participant by subtracting the average of the negative valence items from the average of the positive valence items, and the low arousal item from the average of the high arousal items, respectively (similar approach was used by Kuppens et al., 2013, 2017).\nStep 3: Best Fitting Model for Each Sample\nWe first examined the relationship between these valence and arousal scores within each sample. In each sample, we fit six different statistical regression models in which arousal was modeled as a function of valence in correspondence with the theoretical relations from Figure 1. The models we fit to the data, however, allowed more variation of values than those shown in Figure 1. For example, the \u201cModel 3\u201d we fit to the data allowed an inverted V as well as the V-shape shown in Figure 1; the \u201cModel 5\u201d we fit to the data allowed various slope values as well as the steeper slope for negative valence shown in Figure 1. In addition, for more flexibility, we included an additional nonparametric model (Model 7) that does not make prior parametric assumptions (see Kuppens et al., 2013, for more details on the statistical models).\nTo select the model that provides the most appropriate fit to the data in each sample, we relied on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and posterior model probabilities derived from the BIC (Raftery, 1995). The best fitting model has the lowest BIC score and highest posterior model probability (see Kuppens et al., 2013). For each sample, the seven models were estimated, separately, and the best fitting model was selected. Table 1 presents the model selection indices and Table 2 the best fitting model for each sample. Figure 3 shows the plotted data between valence and arousal together with the best fitting model separately for each sample.\nNo one model showed the best fit in all 33 samples: different samples were best characterized by different models. However, only four models emerged as best fitting. Model 2 emerged in 14 samples, with arousal increasing linearly with valence. In the remaining 19 samples, models including an asymmetry were selected: 16 samples included a V-shape relationship with a steeper slope for positive valence (Model 5), two included a higher intercept for positive valence (Model 4), and one included both a lower intercept and a steeper slope for positive valence (Model 6)."

In about half of the samples, slopes differed by valence: Positive valence uniformly showed a strong positive slope with arousal, but negative valence showed slopes ranging from negative to flat to positive. The finding of the main support for Models 2 and 5 should be understood against the background of the large variations in the valence-arousal relationship within each sample (as evident in the scattered data points in the 33 plots in Figure 3). As shown in the next-to-last column of Table 2, the variance accounted for by the best fitting model was often low, with R2 values ranging from .05 (Model 2 for Finland) to .43 (Model 5 for China Beijing). Thus, explanatory power of even the best fitting model in which\narousal is a function of valence was often low, and within each sample there remains much variation around the overall relation.\nStep 4: One Model for All 33 Samples\nWe next evaluated the possibility of one pancultural model to describe the relation between valence and arousal. As a first step in exploring this possibility, we collapsed the data across samples. With the pooled data of 8,590, we fit the seven theoretical models to the data. The results are shown in the first line of Table 1. Our version of Model 5 (in which we allowed empirically determined values for the two slopes) provided the best fit. Another consideration also favored Model 5: Within each separate sample, both\nTable 1 Summary of Model Selection Indices When Arousal is Modeled as a Function of Valence\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7\nIndependence Linear relation Symmetric V Asymmetric V with different intercepts\nAsymmetric V with different\nslopes\nAsymmetric V with different intercepts, different slopes Nonparametric\nRegion/samplea BIC PostP BIC PostP BIC PostP BIC PostP BIC PostP BIC PostP BIC PostP\nFull data set 33,532.27 .00 31,805.94 .00 32,422.25 .00 31,843.74 .00 31,554.87 .99 31,563.24 .01 31,586.78 .00 Africa and the Middle East Nigeria 620.66 .00 572.08 .01 569.05 .05 563.71 .79 568.34 .08 568.77 .06 573.76 .01 Oman 815.38 .00 774.73 .70 777.57 .17 782.70 .01 778.43 .11 783.70 .01 784.42 .01 Uganda 699.26 .00 601.22 .69 633.63 .00 607.67 .03 603.69 .20 607.62 .03 606.51 .05 Confucian China (Beijing) 822.59 .00 717.84 .01 770.85 .00 727.10 .00 709.39 .89 714.74 .06 715.54 .04 China (Hong Kong) 1,035.41 .00 960.35 .00 986.77 .00 955.55 .01 946.10 .88 950.68 .09 954.02 .02 Japan 1,013.45 .00 989.64 .75 1,001.35 .00 997.95 .01 992.33 .20 997.85 .01 996.71 .02 South Korea 1,056.80 .00 1,028.53 .00 1,015.52 .11 1,019.60 .01 1,012.20 .58 1,014.01 .24 1,016.77 .06 East Europe Croatia 899.84 .00 860.07 .17 869.86 .00 859.48 .23 858.07 .46 863.19 .04 861.14 .10 Czech Republic 1,942.60 .00 1,848.63 .09 1,915.72 .00 1,874.53 .00 1,844.70 .62 1,846.88 .21 1,848.73 .08 Estonia 856.17 .00 823.89 .26 833.50 .00 824.47 .20 822.73 .47 827.49 .04 828.67 .02 Poland 1,560.32 .00 1,507.40 .42 1,545.42 .00 1,508.94 .19 1,507.97 .31 1,511.87 .04 1,512.82 .03 Romania 931.11 .00 856.26 .74 929.75 .00 891.14 .00 860.75 .08 859.13 .18 864.75 .01 Russia 987.44 .00 961.12 .05 969.14 .00 956.93 .43 956.93 .43 961.13 .05 962.65 .02 Serbia 883.41 .00 815.00 .00 834.88 .00 809.00 .03 802.19 .90 807.23 .07 819.26 .00 Slovakia 1,007.14 .00 966.60 .03 980.91 .00 965.23 .07 960.18 .82 965.65 .05 966.57 .03 English-speaking Australia 940.79 .00 906.05 .88 922.22 .00 920.66 .00 911.57 .06 917.02 .00 911.49 .06 Israel 833.46 .00 781.06 .30 799.38 .00 789.53 .00 779.68 .61 784.92 .04 785.02 .04 New Zealand 1,671.69 .00 1,631.36 .10 1,645.39 .00 1,640.11 .00 1,627.38 .75 1,631.84 .08 1,632.16 .07 United Kingdom (England) 790.38 .00 748.26 .45 781.11 .00 759.26 .00 748.27 .45 753.51 .03 752.37 .06 United States 994.00 .00 968.94 .76 981.48 .00 972.87 .11 972.65 .12 976.76 .02 985.19 .00 Latin America Brazil 918.63 .00 865.85 .72 902.75 .00 886.33 .00 868.28 .21 872.85 .02 871.15 .05 Colombia 1,066.42 .00 937.70 .20 1,018.39 .00 962.68 .00 935.13 .74 940.73 .04 943.28 .01 South Asia Indonesia 1,392.45 .00 1,266.55 .12 1,344.17 .00 1,298.72 .00 1,262.66 .84 1,268.51 .04 1,280.67 .00 Vietnam 925.21 .00 882.56 .80 902.38 .00 900.27 .00 887.39 .07 891.48 .01 886.38 .12 West Europe Belgium 723.13 .00 700.96 .03 698.10 .12 697.02 .20 694.84 .60 700.05 .04 702.99 .01 Finland 840.68 .02 834.17 .63 836.12 .24 841.25 .02 838.41 .08 841.80 .01 843.66 .01 France 1,093.98 .00 1,063.91 .01 1,069.29 .00 1,060.92 .04 1,054.67 .86 1,059.75 .07 1,061.59 .03 Germany 837.19 .00 803.55 .50 825.45 .00 804.26 .35 807.75 .06 808.91 .03 808.30 .05 Greece 1,208.86 .00 1,122.73 .00 1,151.27 .00 1,128.22 .00 1,101.11 .43 1,100.56 .57 1,111.10 .00 Iceland 1,228.70 .00 1,204.55 .03 1,200.01 .33 1,203.51 .06 1,199.24 .49 1,203.68 .05 1,204.39 .04 Italy 933.98 .00 866.30 .50 909.68 .00 886.42 .00 866.56 .44 871.18 .04 873.62 .01 Spain 807.61 .00 766.31 .03 769.99 .00 764.73 .06 759.36 .85 764.64 .06 774.81 .00 Switzerland 862.32 .00 827.23 .84 849.61 .00 837.45 .01 831.08 .12 836.52 .01 834.10 .03\nNote.

Nonetheless, Model 2 can be thought of as a special case of Model 5: Model 2 adds the constraint that the slope of negative valence is equal in magnitude to the slope of positive valence. Model 5 is thus the more general model, and the frequency of finding an asymmetry in slope values led us to Model 5.5 Thus, Model 5 is the best candidate for a nomothetic structure of affect. The version of Model 5 that fit the total sample is shown in the thick black line of Figure 4. As can be seen in this figure, this version features a positive slope for positive valence, and an almost flat slope for negative valence. To account for between-sample differences in this overall relation, a multilevel extension of Model 5 was also estimated. The multilevel framework allowed us to model an overall, population-average relation between valence and arousal across the data from all 33 samples (i.e., the fixed effects structure), and at the same time to estimate sample-specific deviations from this average relation (i.e., the random effects structure). Indeed, the fixed effects pertaining to the intercept\nand slope values of this population average-model reveal the shape of the average model across all samples, and the random effects pertaining to the intercepts and slopes allow for variation between samples. Table 3 shows the numerical estimates of the model, and Figure 5 displays the estimated fixed effects part of the model, portraying the population average model across all 33 samples, together with sample-specific deviations. Across all data, the marginal R2 of this model (i.e., the proportion of variance explained by the fixed effects alone) equals .19, and the conditional R2 (i.e., the proportion of\nTable 2 Overview of Best Fitting Model for the Relation Between Valence and Arousal (in Comparison With the Fixed Effects Part of the Multilevel Extension of Model 5)\nRegion/samplea Best model Relation Higher intercept Steeper slope R2 for the best fitting model R2 based on the fixed effects of Model 5b\nAfrica and the Middle East Nigeria 4 Asymmetric V Positive valence \u2014 .21 .18 Oman 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .14 .14 Uganda 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .24 .25 Confucian China (Beijing) 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .43 .43 China (Hong Kong) 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .31 .31 Japan 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .11 .12 South Korea 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .19 .17 East Europe Croatia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .18 .18 Czech Republic 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .21 .21 Estonia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .18 .18 Poland 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .13 .14 Romania 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .30 .29 Russia 4 Asymmetric V Positive valence \u2014 .16 .16 Serbia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .33 .33 Slovakia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .21 .21 English-Speaking Australia 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .15 .14 Israel 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .27 .27 New Zealand 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .12 .12 United Kingdom (England) 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .21 .23 United States 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .11 .12 Latin America Brazil 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .22 .23 Colombia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .41 .41 South Asia Indonesia 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .33 .32 Vietnam 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .13 .12 West Europe Belgium 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .18 .18 Finland 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .05 .05 France 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .16 .15 Germany 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .16 .16 Greece 6 Asymmetric V Negative valence Positive valence .33 .31 Iceland 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .12 .12 Italy 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .27 .28 Spain 5 Asymmetric V \u2014 Positive valence .22 .21 Switzerland 2 Linear/positive \u2014 \u2014 .16 .16\na Global regions were identified by Schwartz (2006). b See Table 3 for the multilevel extension of Model 5.\n5 Model 6 was also a reasonable candidate to explore as a pancultural model for all samples. After all, Model 6 is the most general of the models. Model 6 is equivalent to Model 5 but allows different intercepts for positive and negative valence (viz., an offset). The offset occurred in the best fitting model for only three of the 33 samples, and in one of those the value of the intercept was opposite to that predicted by Cacioppo and Berntson (1994). Offset thus seemed to be an unlikely feature of the general model we sought."

Allowing sample-specific deviations in these parameters increases this value to 25% of the total variance. The multilevel extension of Model 5 underscores three points about the population-average, pancultural model. First, as shown in Table 3 and in the thick black line in Figure 5, the intercept of the model is close to the arousal midpoint (i.e., not significantly different from zero). Second, the model contains different slopes for positive and negative valence. Specifically, the slope of negative valence is flat whereas the slope of positive valence was significantly steeper than the slope for negative valence. Three, despite this overall relation, there is variation among the samples in the parameters (see also the thin lines in Figure 5). The appearance of variation was confirmed by the sizable sample-specific deviations from the fixed effects structure as indicated by the variance components of the multilevel model. There is considerable variation across samples for the intercept, the negative valence slope, and the positive valence slope. Finally, one may wonder how allowing for sample-specific deviations (as in the sample specific models or the multilevel model reported above) compares to an approach that would assume the\nexact same relation between valence and arousal in every sample. To evaluate this possibility, we estimated the proportion of explained variance per sample if one would fit the same model dictated by the fixed effects portion of Model 5 (with a positive slope for positive valence and a flat slope for negative valence; see Table 3 and the bold line in Figures 4 and 5) to the data from each sample. To do so, we examined the squared correlation between the observed arousal values and the arousal values predicted by the fixed effects component of the multilevel model. The R2 values are reported in the last column of Table 2. The possibility of a single model with no sample-specific parameters was supported by the similarity of these R2 values to those from the separate different models per country (the last second column of Table 2)."

Such a general model is useful for many purposes. If, of a group of participants, all we know is that they are human, then this version of Model 5 is a good basis for the description of their momentary affect: When they are feeling pleasant, they tend to be feeling activated; When they are feeling unpleasant, they could be feeling activated, deactivated, or in between. More generally, the average global relationship between valence and arousal is asymmetric, with an almost flat slope for negative valence that is joined to a positive slope for positive valence. Model 5 is the prime candidate for a universal pancultural account of the general relation between valence and arousal. The flat slope for negative valence might possibly be explained, in part, by two reasons. One was related to memory recall. Our participants tended to remember positive valence, and this effect is vividly evident in all 33 plots in Figure 3.7 In the most extreme case, people in Oman almost never recalled any negative valence. Certainly this does not mean that they never experience anything negative. Rather they did not report negative valence. Positivity bias in memory recall was well documented in the literature supporting the prevalence of pleasant (vs. unpleasant) events (see Botzung et al., 2010). Others have found that the affect associated with unpleasant memories fades faster than that associated with pleasant memories (see Ritchie et al., 2015). The intersection between memory recall and the valence-arousal model should be included in future research directions. The second reason for the flat slope could be related to the word choice. In English, most of the words used to anchor arousal appear\nto be positive (e.g., \u201cdetermined\u201d and \u201caroused\u201d). The positivity of these words could bias our results to show that arousal and positive valence are correlated, but arousal and negative valence are not. When we chose the words to define arousal in English, we sought to focus on those saturated with arousal and relatively independent of valence. (To maintain the independence of valence and arousal in the translations, detailed instructions were given to the translators in the remaining 24 languages.) To test the positivity bias of the arousal words, we estimated the correlations between the four high arousal items (\u201cdetermined\u201d, \u201caroused\u201d, \u201chyperactivated\u201d, and \u201cactivated\u201d) and the positive valence score in each of the 33 samples: The mean correlation was .32 (SD = .15) for \u201cdetermined\u201d, .35 (SD = .20) for \u201caroused\u201d, .41 (SD = .09) for \u201cactivated\u201d, and .30 (SD = .14) for \u201chyperactivated\u201d (in the United States sample, the corresponding values were .06, .32, .27, and .13.) These positive correlations might be due to the co-occurrence of higher arousal with positive valence, or to a semantic relationship such that these four high arousal words have some component of positive valence, or to the memory bias discussed above. Our results lent some potential support that word choice is one possible explanation for our global model, but co-occurrence of positive valence and arousal is also possible. The differences in correlations across the four arousal items (.30 to .41) are consistent with both factors influencing the results. So, for now, we can conclude that positive valence is positively correlated with arousal. It remains for future research to\nFigure 4 Relationship Between Valence and Arousal Based on an Overall, Nonmultilevel Model 5\n7 The 1,589 subjects fell in the negative valence region where the correlation between valence and arousal was .02 (p = .40)."

A more precise model is possible for each separate sample.\nThat is, as also shown in Figure 5, we also found evidence for differences among the 33 samples\u2014differences that can be represented simply by three parameters: (a) the value of arousal at neutral valence, (b) the slope of arousal as a function of positive valence, and (c) the slope of arousal as a function of negative valence. Specifying values for each of these three parameters for a specific sample provides a better fitting model of affect. Why each parameter takes on the value it does for a given sample remains to be seen, however. This question rises to the top of the list of important directions for future research. Of course, simply sampling differences might have occurred, but more interesting possibilities are differences between samples in terms of personality, culture, language, geography, and social differences.\nOne possibility\u2013suggested by results shown in Figure 3\u2013is that more than these three parameters are needed because the relationship of valence to arousal varies even more with sample when modeled separately. As shown in Figure 3, for example, the best fitting model for both Nigeria and Russia has a positivity offset and a positive slope of arousal as a function of the intensity of negative valence\u2014a combination of features not seen in the best fitting model for any other society. The best fitting model for 19 samples has an inflection point such that the arousal slope changes from negative to positive valence, and yet no inflection point occurred for the other 14 samples. Such differences are more likely than the three parameters of Figure 5 to be due to sampling differences, and yet they are hints of interesting possibilities. In these cases, replicability is the first question.\nCertain negative conclusions are also warranted. In no sample did the independence model (Model 1 of Figure 1) provide the best fit. This finding in itself is important, as it indicates that the model most commonly presupposed in measures of self-reported affect is only an approximation. On the other hand, for no sample\nTable 3 Results of the Multilevel Extension of Model 5\nFixed effects Random effects (variance components)\nParameter Estimate SE t (df = 8,446) p SD 95% CI\nIntercept .10 .07 1.49 .137 .32 [.21, .43] Negative valence slope .03 .03 1.08 .279 .08 [.03, .14] Positive valence slope .55 .03 18.94 ,.001 .13 [.07, .18]\nNote.

In other words, the consistently low values of R2 for even the best fitting model in each sample and the overall model in all 8,590 participants support a fair amount of independence between valence and arousal. In addition, for the single best average model of Figures 4 or 5, arousal was independent of negative valence. That average model or the version with three parameters must therefore be interpreted against the background of the low degree of predictive strengths of the best fitting model within each sample. Therefore, these prevalent relationships seen here should be interpreted in a probabilistic rather than deterministic manner. For any individual, any combination between valence and arousal remains possible. Further, we found no evidence indicating a need for highly complex models to represent the relation between valence and arousal. Of the seven models examined, only four emerged as the best fit for even one sample. Even more telling, in no sample did the nonparametric Model 7 provide the best fit. The relation between valence and arousal within and between samples can be represented by simple principles. We offer the simple model seen in Figures 4 or 5, with three parameters to represent sample differences, as the most promising account consistent with current evidence."
