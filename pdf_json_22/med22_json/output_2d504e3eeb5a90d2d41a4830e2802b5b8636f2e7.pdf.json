In the era of systemic therapy, combination therapy with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has become mainstream. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) as a local treatment has also shown a strong anti-tumor effect. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HAIC, PD-1 inhibitors plus TKIs for u-HCC.\nMethods: This retrospective study included patients with initially u-HCC between October 2020 to April 2022 who had received at least one cycle of therapy with HAIC, PD-1 inhibitors plus TKIs. The primary outcome included overall response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), surgical conversion rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-related adverse events.\nResults: A total of 145 patients were included in the study. The median treatment cycle of HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors were 3 and 4, respectively. According to the modified RECIST criteria, the best ORR was 57.2% (83/145), 9 had achieved complete response (CR), DCR was 89.7% (130/145). Median time to achieve CR or PR was 65 days. Surgical conversion rate was 18.6% (27/ 145), seven patients (7/27,25.9%) achieved pathological complete response (pCR). The median follow-up was 12.5 months (4.5-20 months), and the\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Oncology\nmedian PFS was 9.7 months. Subgroup analysis showed that Child-pugh A patients had higher DCR (92.2% vs 79.3%, p=0.041) than Child-pugh B patients, as well as increased successful conversion rate (22.4% vs 3.4%, p=0.019). Patients without vascular invasion and extrahepatic metastases showed higher PR (63.4% vs 43.3%, p<0.05) and ORR (73.2% vs 50.0%, p<0.05) than those with vascular invasion. The ORR (73.2% vs 45.5%, p<0.05) and DCR (95.1% vs 78.8%, p<0.05) were also significantly better than those of patients with extrahepatic metastases. HAIC regimen was not related to efficacy (All p>0.05). The incidence rate of grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs was 17.7% without fatal events.\nConclusion: The triple combination therapy of HAIC and PD-1 inhibitors plus TKIs for patients with initially unresectable HCC exhibited satisfactory efficacy with tolerable toxicity.\nKEYWORDS\nunresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, programmed cell death protein-1, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, conversion therapy"

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still the most common kinds of malignant tumors worldwide, although the morbidity is decreasing stably in China (1). The prognosis of HCC remains poor, and approximately 830000 newly deaths every year (2). Although progress has been made in early screening for HCC, the majority have lost the chance of cure at the time of diagnosis. These so called \u201cunresectable HCC\u201d (u-HCC) have worse prognosis with the median overall survival (OS) ranging from 1 to 2 year (3).\nSystemic therapy is the preferred option for u-HCC patients with the advent of sorafenib, but the objective response rate (ORR) remains far from satisfactory. With the publications of REFLECT, RESORCE, CELESTIAL and REACH-2 study, more novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been the alternative modality of sorafenib, such as lenvatinib, apatinib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab, but the outcomes remain poor with the ORR of 4% to 18.8% (4). Trial of CheckMate040 has ushered the era of immunotherapy for HCC in the recent years, but phase III CheckMate459 trials of PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy for HCC have all failed to meet the primary endpoints (5). Dual combination regimen, such as lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, camrelizumab plus apatinib, and sintilimab plus anlotinib, have yielded promising clinical efficiency and safety, but the prognosis for those u-HCC patients is still unsatisfactory with the median OS of 20.1 to 20.4 months (6\u20138).\nIMbrave150 trial has not only opened the era of molecular target and immunotherapy, but also shed light on the triple combination of local regional therapy, TKIs, and\n02\nimmunotherapy. In the trial of IMbrave150, about 40% patients received previous transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) before enrollment (9). In the recent years, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been identified to be alternative strategy of TACE in the management of advanced HCC, which has the advantage over TACE for those with extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion (10, 11). Combination of HAIC and sorafenib has exhibited significant survival benefit compared with sorafenib or HAIC alone, but the 2-year survival rate remains low (12, 13).\nIn addition, \u201cconversion therapy\u201d has been well concerned in the field of HCC, which needs amore aggressive strategy. In the past two years, triple therapy of TACE/HAIC, TKIs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been tried with encouraging results, but most of the studies were retrospective with small sample size. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the triple regimen of HAIC, PD-1 inhibitors and TKIs for u-HCC patients in a retrospective study of single-center."

In addition, IMbrave150 also gave birth of an aggressive treatment for u-HCC, triple modality of arterial directed therapy (ADT), ICIs, and TKIs. Zheng, et al (16) firstly reported the combination treatment of TACE+sorafenib+ICIs for 29 u-HCC patients, and results showed that the triple therapy exhibited significant advantage over TACE+sorafenib in terms of DCR (81.82% vs. 55.17%, p = 0.046). This finding was verified by the subsequent studies and was also confirmed in the latest systematic review.\nRecently, HAIC-based combination therapy has received increasing attention due to encouraging tumor response rates and patient survival rates. Table 5 depicted all the published reports of combination of HAIC and TKIs plus ICIs. The\nFrontiers in Oncology\n- ,\n06\npublished studies were almost come from small size sample of 25 to 84, and the results varied greatly from each study with the CR ranging from 0% to 48%, ORR from 40% to 96%, and DCR from 77.6% to 100%, respectively (17\u201321). This divergence might be contributed to the difference in study population (macrovascular invasion or not, extrahepatic metastasis or not) and therapy regimen (sorafenib, apatinib or lenvatinib, toripalimab, sintilimab, pembrolizumab or camrelizumab). In the present study of 145 patients in a single center, the corresponding CR, ORR, and DCR were 6.1%, 57.2% and 89.7%, respectively. And the median PFS was 9.7 months in the whole cohort, but with 18.6% achieved successful conversation. These findings were coincident with previous studies, but limitations were: 1) the heterogneity of study population, 51.7% were present with macrovascular invasion and 22.8% were with extrahepatic metastasis; 2) the divergence of liver function, the ALBI ranged from grade 1 to 3 regard less of 80% grading ChildPugh A.\nThe underlying mechanism of the synergistic antitumor effect of the HAIC plus TKI and PD-1 might be as follows: 1) HAIC induces tumor antigen exposure through persistent highconcentration chemotherapeutic drug penetration, increases antigenicity through immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, and improves the tumor immune microenvironment to reduce off-targets, thereby enhancing the efficacy of systemic therapy (22); 2) chemotherapy drugs may activate adaptive immunity by increasing leukocyte antigen expression and enhancing T cell stimulation, and restore immune surveillance by disrupting signal transduction and immunosuppression (23); 3) combination of PD-1 inhibitor and anti-VEGF drug may promote normalization of blood vessels breaks the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors and convert cold tumors into"

Liver function is the premise of all treatments, and triple therapy means higher requirements for liver function (25). In the present study, we found that Child-pugh A patients had higher DCR (92.2% vs\nTABLE 3A Subgroup analysis according to liver function (Child-pugh A vs Child-pugh B).\nChild-pugh A (n = 116) Child-pugh B (n = 29) p value mRECIST\nBest response (n, %)\nCR 9 (7.8) 0 (0) 0.205\nPR 60 (51.7) 13 (44.8) 0.506\nSD 38 (32.7) 10 (34.5) 0.860\nPD 9 (7.8) 6 (20.7) 0.041\nORR (CR+PR) 69(59.5) 13 (44.8) 0.154\nDCR (CR+PR+SD) 107 (92.2) 23 (79.3) 0.041\nConversion rate (n, %) 26 (22.4) 1 (3.4) 0.019\nfronti\nmRECIST, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease; ORR, objective response rate; DCR, disease control rate.\nersin.org\n79.3%, p=0.041) than Child-pugh B patients, as well as increased successful conversion rate (22.4% vs 3.4%, p=0.019). These findings indicated that liver function must be taken as an important decision-making factor of triple therapy.\nMacrovascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis are both two aggressive hallmarks of HCC, and patients combined with macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis generally mean adverse prognosis (4). Systematic therapy is the\nFrontiers in Oncology 09\npreferred option for patients with macorvascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic metastasis, although many novel modalities such as surgical resection combined with local regional therapy have been tried with encouraging results (26, 27). In the present study, subgroup analysis showed that patients with macrovascular invasion have significantly lower rates PR and ORR (both p<0.05) compared with the patients with no macrovscular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis, and similar disadvantage was observed in patients with extrahepatic metastasis in terms of ORR and DCR (both p<0.05). These results suggested that the current modality might not be appropriate for this population. Considering that tumor thrombus is much more sensitive to radiotherapy (RT), RT-based comprehensive treatment might be ideal option for patients with macrovascular invasion (28). As is known to all, good local control (LC) is positively correlated with improved prognosis, and RT or radiofrequency ablation offer superior LC to ADT for patients with metastasis, such as oligometastasis in lung, brain, and bone. As one saying goes, one size does not fit for all. In future, more modalities combined with local treatment and systematic therapy should be worth trying for u-HCC.\nAs for the choice of the HAIC regimen, there is still no answer. The oxaliplatin-based FOLFOX regimen is currently the mainstream HAIC chemotherapy regimen in China (29), which could regulate the function of immune response, thereby improving the ability of dendritic cells to recognize tumor cells, activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to attack tumor cells, and leading to tumor immune death (30). While evidences revealed that RALOX was not inferior to FOLFOX in efficacy but with shorter infusion period, which might improve\nFIGURE 5 Summary of treatment-related adverse events."

In the present study, we found that there was no significant differences between the two HAIC regimen in CR, ORR, DCR, and successful conversion rate (all p>0.05), which was coincident with previous studies (32). But considering feasibility and compliance, RALOX could be taken as an alternation for selected patients, especially for those with poor performance status.\nSafety is a key concern for the triple therapy protocol. In this study, the most common AEs were impaired liver function, myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain. Although the vast majority of patients experienced treatment-related AEs, grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs was 17.7% and no deaths were reported. But this does not mean that we can relax our vigilance. Late onset AEs deserve much more attentions, especially to those related to ICIs. In addition, high rates of impaired liver function damage also indicated the\nneed of adequate liver reserve function for triple therapy, and patients with impaired liver function should be excluded or taken much more carefully.\nThere were several limitations in this study. Firstly, this was a retrospective, single center, and single-arm study. Although our sample size was large, we did not provide a control group, which is what we need to do next. Second, our treatment regimens were not uniform as depicted in other published studies, which may have some impact on efficacy. Third, median OS could not be derived due to short follow-up time, the choice of subsequent treatment regimens could also have an impact on OS. Fourth, the number of patients in the subgroup analysis may be insufficient, and the conclusions drawn may not be accurate. Prospective randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes are needed to verify the efficacy of triple therapy, and Table 6 lists ongoing clinical trials."

In future, cross-regional centers RCTs with a larger sample size will be helpful in clarifying the role of the triple modality for unresectable HCC."
