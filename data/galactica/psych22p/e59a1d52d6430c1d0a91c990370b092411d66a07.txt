In contrast, more engagement in PAwas negatively associated with depressive symptoms in European adults. Moreover, PA seems to moderate the association between the time spent TV watching and depression symptoms. Public health policies promoting mental health should include reducing time spent TV watching and the increase of PA as a mean to promote mental health among adults living in Europe.
