Although previous studies showed that warmer temperatures may be associated with increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates, unmeasured factors may explain the observed relationship. We conducted a ten-year ecological analysis to evaluate whether temperature change was associated with AMR across 30 European countries, considering predictors that can determine a geographical gradient. Using four data sources, we created a dataset of: annual temperature change (FAOSTAT database); AMR proportions for ten pathogen–antibiotic combinations (ECDC atlas); consumption of antibiotics for systemic use in the community (ESAC-Net database); population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and governance indicators (World Bank DataBank). Data were obtained for each country and year (2010–2019) and analyzed through multivariable models. We found evidence of a positive linear association between temperature change and AMR proportion across all countries, years, pathogens, and antibiotics (β = 0.140; 95%CI = 0.039; 0.241; p = 0.007), adjusting for the effect of covariates. However, when GDP per capita and the governance index were included in the multivariable model, temperature change was no longer associated with AMR. Instead, the main predictors were antibiotic consumption (β = 0.506; 95%CI = 0.366; 0.646; p < 0.001), population density (β = 0.143; 95%CI = 0.116; 0.170; p < 0.001), and the governance index (β = −1.043; 95%CI = −1.207; −0.879; p < 0.001). Ensuring the appropriate use of antibiotics and improving governance efficiency are the most effective ways of counteracting AMR.  1. conclusions Although previous studies suggested a link between climate change and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria—with the potential for higher AMR rates as temperatures rise—it remains uncertain whether the relationship between temperature and AMR is merely due to coincidental geographical gradients influenced by other unmeasured factors. Our ecological analysis focused on temperature change, and not simply on mean local temperature, to evaluate its association with AMR proportions across European countries and over a ten-year period (2010–2019). Compared to previous studies, we used a larger amount of information on AMR, including data on ten combinations between three pathogens and six antibiotic classes. To help unravel the relationship between temperature and AMR, our analysis also included additional predictors that had not been previously considered, such as the GDP per capita and a governance index. In line with previous findings, we initially demonstrated a positive linear association between temperature change and AMR proportion, adjusting for the effect of country, time, population density, antibiotic consumption, and the interaction between time and temperature change. However, when GDP per capita and the governance index were included in the multivariable model, temperature change was no longer associated with AMR. Accordingly, no correlation was evident when considering ten-year changes in temperature and AMR, with countries experiencing greater temperature changes that did not necessarily show a greater change in AMR. Antibiotic consumption, population density, and the governance index remained the main factors contributing to AMR. While AMR proportions increased with increasing antibiotic consumption and population density, the governance had an opposite effect. In fact, AMR proportions decreased with an increasing governance index. For this reason, ensuring the appropriate use of antibiotics and improving governance efficiency are still the most effective ways to counteract AMR.
