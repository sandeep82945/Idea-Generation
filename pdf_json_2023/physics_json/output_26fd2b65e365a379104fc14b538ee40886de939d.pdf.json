However, excessive melanin production and accumulation lead to various skin pigmentation disorders, including melasma, freckles, and dark spots2. Hyperpigmentation profoundly affects an individual\u2019s physical appearance and self-assurance in social interactions. Presently, the treatment of hyperpigmentation entails the utilization of whitening agents, chemical peels, and laser therapy3. Among these modalities, common topical treatment with effective skin lightening/whitening agents is still necessary due to the resistant and relapsing nature of hyperpigmentation4. Indeed, various commercially available lightening agents, such as kojic acid, hydroquinone, retinoids, have proven to be effective for topical management; however, most of them caused undesirable side effects, including possible carcinogenicity and dermatitis4\u20136. Moreover, hydroquinone and kojic acid are prohibited in most countries. Consequently, the need to discover safer and more effective melanogenic inhibitors persists.\nThailand is renowned for its agricultural prominence, and Nephelium lappaceum L. (known as rambutan), is one of the economically significant crops in Thailand. In addition to commercial fresh fruits, rambutan is industrially processed into can, juice, jam, jelly, and spread7. This processing produces a large amount of seed\nOPEN\n1Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. 2Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut\u2019s University of Technology, Thonburi 10140, Thailand. *email: khanitha.p@chula.ac.th\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:22004 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49351-3\nwaste, a yearly average 1900 tons discarded8. There is growing concern about agricultural wastes that contain bioactive compounds. Previous phytochemical investigations demonstrated various phenolic compounds were found in rambutan seed, some of which exhibited antioxidant, antimicrobial, and nitric oxide inhibition9\u201311.\nTo enhance the economic value of such kind of waste with a growing preference for natural products within the cosmetic industry, rambutan roots-derived phenolics and their melanin and tyrosinase inhibition have been studied. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the synergistic effect of the combination of the potential compounds and melanin-inhibiting whitening agents and/or tyrosinase inhibitors, due to research on synergistic interaction of two or more compounds attracted great interest in recent years12. In addition to greater impact on biological activity, synergy can also influence the physicochemical properties of compounds or mixtures, including solubility and absorption efficiency13. Finally, the chemical stability of both these substances will be examined within cosmetic formulations."

As a positive control, arbutin, a widely recognized tyrosinase inhibitor frequently employed as a cosmetic whitening agent, was utilized14. Among them, compound 3 exhibited the most potent anti-melanogenic activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while no significant toxicity was observed (Fig.\u00a02C). It provided an IC50 value of 23.0 \u00b1 1.3\u00a0\u00b5M, indicating compound 3 was about 35-fold more potent than positive control arbutin (IC50 = 807.6 \u00b1 2.9\u00a0\u00b5M) (Table\u00a01). The remaining three compounds 1\u20132 and 4 could also suppress melanin production in B16F10 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 134.8 \u00b1 2.1, 190.5 \u00b1 2.2, and > 200\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A,B,D). From these data, some structure\u2013activity relationships could be seen. The position of the rhamnose moiety might play an important role in melanin inhibition and cytotoxicity. Attachment of rhamnose at the C-7 position to kaempferol core skeleton as in 3 exerted a remarkably potent melanin reduction, whereas the C-3 existence of rhamnose in 2 caused much decrease in anti-melanogenic activity but increase in cellular toxicity. In addition, it was implied that the presence of a glucosyl moiety at C-3 position as in 4 made the compound loss of both melanin suppression and toxicity. Surprisingly, Tang et\u00a0al. previously reported that kaempferol itself did induce melanin production and melanocyte growth15. The results indicated that the existence of the sugar moiety is required for melanin inhibition of the kaempferol core skeleton."

Hence, inhibiting tyrosinase represents a crucial strategy in addressing disorders associated with pigmentation. In this study, the inhibitory activity of the compound on tyrosinase was evaluated through the employment of a mushroom tyrosinase assay. Based on the anti-melanin activity, compound 3 was chosen for subsequent investigation owing to its pronounced melanin inhibition activity, in addition to the absence of discernible cytotoxicity even after 72\u00a0h of treatment with concentrations as high as 1000\u00a0\u00b5M. Most notably, its anti-melanogenic activity exhibited a 35-fold superiority to that of arbutin. Compound 3 exhibited strong anti-tyrosinase activity, with an IC50 value of 25.3 \u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u00b5M, comparable to kojic acid (positive control) and much potent than arbutin (active ingredient in commercial skincare products) (Table\u00a02). This heightened activity might be attributed to the hydroxyl groups present in kaempferol, which facilitate binding to the enzymatic site of tyrosinase. Consequently, this binding impedes the catalytic oxidation of L-DOPA to L-DOPA quinone via catecholate activity17.\nSynergistic Impact of arbutin and kaempferol\u20117\u2011O\u2011\u03b1\u2011l\u2011rhamnopyranoside (3) Recent research findings have revealed the application of arbutin, a hydroquinone compound, and kojic acid as potent tyrosinase inhibitors within the realm of cosmetic formulations.

Furthermore, when kojic acid is utilized at concentrations exceeding 1%, it has the potential to elicit skin irritations, contact dermatitis, and increased vulnerability to sunburn, particularly in individuals possessing sensitive skin conditions20. The synergistic effect is a phenomenon that arises when two or more substances collaborate to yield an aggregated impact surpassing the cumulative effect of their individual properties. Moreover, the synergistic effects may extend to influence the physicochemical characteristics of compounds or mixtures, such as solubility12,13. Due to lower side effects, arbutin, a natural \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside of hydroquinone, has gained widespread employment as a depigmentation agent within the cosmetic industry. In current study, compound 3 was selected to be synergistically combined with arbutin to investigate their collective impact on suppressing tyrosinase activity and inhibiting melanin production in B16F10 cells. Various combinations of compound 3 and arbutin were prepared, utilizing ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 to reveal a notable reduction in melanin content within B16F10 cells (Fig.\u00a03). Treatment with compound 3 and arbutin mixtures resulted in reductions of 39.4%, 63.1%, 68.0%, and 71.5% in melanin content, respectively. These sample mixtures were further subjected to evaluation of their anti-tyrosinase activity, which manifested as a reduction in inhibitory percentages of 23.5%, 27.3%, 37.0%, and 49.6%, respectively (Table\u00a03). The calculation of combination index (CI) values revealed that the mixtures comprising compound 3 and arbutin exhibited synergistic effects, as evidenced by CI values below 1.0 (Table\u00a03). Notably, treatment with a 1:40 mixture of compound 3 and arbutin demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effects on melanin production in B16F10 cells, resulting in a remarkable reduction of up to 75.6%. These findings indicated that the combined mixture of compounds exhibits enhanced efficacy as melanin inhibitors compared to their individual extracts. Additionally, Table\u00a03 provides a summary of the percentage inhibition of tyrosinase activity and the corresponding CI values of the mixtures. The results indicated that the mixtures of compound 3 and arbutin also displayed a synergistic effect, as indicated by CI values below 1.0."

Moreover, it displayed remarkable anti-tyrosinase activity comparable to that of kojic acid, making it a promising candidate as an active ingredient in skin whitening products. Our study also demonstrated a synergistic compatibility effect when combining compound 3 and arbutin in specific proportions, assessed using the CI value to evaluate synergism. The results revealed a synergistic effect (CI < 1) between compound 3 and arbutin in inhibiting melanin production in B16F10 cells and tyrosinase inhibition using L-tyrosine as a substrate. Consequently, we selected compound 3 and arbutin as active ingredients for inclusion in cosmetic formulations. Furthermore, formulation F1 demonstrated excellent stability under all accelerated storage conditions, and the quantitative analysis confirmed that the levels of compound 3 and arbutin in the formulation remained above 90% after one month of storage.
