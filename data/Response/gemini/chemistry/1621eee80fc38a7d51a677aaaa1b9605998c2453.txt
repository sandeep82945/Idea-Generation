1. **Investigate the effect of deamidation on the functional properties of other plant proteins.** The current study focused on pea proteins, but it would be interesting to see if similar results could be obtained with other plant proteins, such as soy, wheat, or rice proteins. This would help to determine the generality of the findings and the potential for using deamidation to improve the functional properties of a wide range of plant proteins.


2. **Explore the use of deamidation to improve the nutritional value of plant proteins.** Deamidation can increase the content of glutamic acid in proteins, which is an essential amino acid that is often limiting in plant proteins. Therefore, deamidation could be a potential strategy for improving the nutritional value of plant proteins and making them more comparable to animal proteins.


3. **Investigate the effect of deamidation on the allergenicity of plant proteins.** Some plant proteins, such as soy and wheat proteins, can be allergenic to some individuals. Deamidation has been shown to reduce the allergenicity of some proteins, so it would be interesting to see if it could also reduce the allergenicity of plant proteins. This could make plant proteins more suitable for use in food products for people with food allergies.


4. **Develop new food products using deamidated plant proteins.** The improved functional properties of deamidated plant proteins could be used to develop new food products with improved texture, flavor, and nutritional value. For example, deamidated plant proteins could be used to make plant-based meat alternatives, dairy alternatives, or protein-fortified beverages.


5. **Study the long-term stability of deamidated plant proteins.** The current study only looked at the short-term stability of deamidated plant proteins. It would be important to study the long-term stability of these proteins to ensure that they are safe and effective for use in food products. This could involve studying the changes in the functional properties of deamidated plant proteins over time, as well as the potential for microbial growth or spoilage.
