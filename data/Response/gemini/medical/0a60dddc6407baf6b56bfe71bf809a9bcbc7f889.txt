1. **Investigate the potential benefits of using ECMO in combination with other therapies for severe respiratory failure.** For example, ECMO could be used in combination with lung transplantation, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This could help to improve patient outcomes by providing more comprehensive support for the lungs and other organs.


2. **Develop new strategies for managing complications associated with ECMO.** Common complications of ECMO include bleeding, infection, and thrombosis. New strategies for managing these complications could help to improve patient safety and outcomes.


3. **Study the long-term effects of ECMO on patients.** There is limited data on the long-term effects of ECMO on patients. Studies are needed to investigate the potential risks and benefits of ECMO in the long term.


4. **Develop new technologies to improve the performance of ECMO.** New technologies could help to make ECMO more effective, safer, and easier to use. For example, new oxygenators could be developed that are more efficient and less likely to cause complications.


5. **Conduct research to better understand the mechanisms of respiratory failure.** This could help to identify new targets for therapy and improve the overall management of respiratory failure.
