            "text": "Depression and anxiety are important indicators of mental health and have become the main risk factors of physical and mental health in the 21st century. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2019 study showed that the two most disabling mental disorders are depression and anxiety. Among adolescents, depression and anxiety disorders were ranked fourth and sixth in the list of leading causes of burden worldwide in 2019 [1]. This proves that depression and anxiety are prevalent and significant psychiatric disorders among young adults [2\u20135].\nChinese college students have unique characteristics and face different pressures from other\ngroups. Some of the challenges they face are related to acquiring knowledge and gaining skills in college; cultivating intimacy during college, avoiding loneliness, and experiencing the realization of love; and adapting to college life. Since the reasons behind why they may suffer from anxiety and depression are different from that of other populations, this research specifically focus on the mental health of this group.\nDepression and anxiety have profound negative implications on college students. First,\ndepression and anxiety adversely affect academic performance [6\u20139], thereby resulting in increased college dropout rates [10\u201312]. Second, college students who experience depression and anxiety may not be able to properly cope with interpersonal relationships [13\u201315], such as establishing friendly peer relationships, maintaining harmonious family relationships, and upholding good teacher-student relationships. Third, a cross-sectional study of medical students predicted that the prevalence of major depressive disorders is associated with the presence of chronic diseases and major life events [16]. Another systematic review showed that anxiety among nursing students can have adverse effects on motivation, communication, learning, clinical practice, and the overall academic performance, which can result in their causing harm to patients [17]. Moreover, depression among college students is associated with physical illness, decreased physical activity, and increased levels of smoking [18] and substance abuse [19]. Furthermore, depression and anxiety have been found to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [20, 21]. A previous study on Chinese college students found that moderate-to-severe depression was positively correlated with declining lung function [22]. Given the substantial burden of depression and anxiety on individuals and society, it is crucial to understand college students\u2019 development to promote preventive strategies and treatment.\nPrevious studies on anxiety and depression among college students have primarily focused\non the prevalence, influencing factors, and possible adverse effects of such disorders. However, relatively few studies have observed the relationship between anxiety and depression. A crosssectional study conducted among 4882 Chinese medical college students demonstrated a significant association between the two [23]. Moreover, previous studies on the relationship between social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder have consistently represented a temporal precedence for social anxiety disorder relative to major depressive disorder [24, 25]. Therefore, in its exploration of the association and underlying mechanisms of anxiety and depression among college students, the current study assumes that there exists a time sequence relationship between them.\nAdditionally, anxiety can be used as a predictor of sleep quality, since students with anxiety\nare more likely to experience sleep problems [26\u201328]. One study showed that anxiety may affect sleep quality through the gray matter volume of the right insula [28]. Additionally, sleep quality is known to be correlated with depression among young adults, particularly college students [26, 28]. Several studies have found poor sleep quality to be correlated with remarkably high levels of depression among college students [29\u201332]. Furthermore, a longitudinal observational study found a bidirectional relationship between the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268773 June 2, 2022 2 / 13\ninnovation and Entrepreneurship Project (202010368003).\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n(PSQI) global score and mental health problems, and found that baseline anxiety scores were correlated with the PSQI global score. The same study also showed that poorer baseline sleep quality was positively associated with depression, which provides some evidence for the relationship between anxiety symptoms and sleep quality, as well as the relationship between sleep quality and the development of depression [30]. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be a reason why sleep quality can act as a mediator of college students\u2019 symptoms of anxiety and depression, since it regulates the levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticotropin releasing hormone [33]. Additionally, there are 5-HT neurons located in the dorsal raphe nucleus project to the hypothalamus, and 5-HT is an excitatory neurotransmitter of corticotropin releasing hormones, which can excite the pituitary adrenocortical system [34]. Researches have predicted an association between 5-HT, sleep, anxiety, and depression [35\u2013 37]. In view of this, we assume that anxiety can reduce college students\u2019 sleep quality, which contributes to a high risk of depression.\nAdditional researches have shown that quality of life (QoL) may also contribute to the rela-\ntionship between anxiety and depressive symptoms. First, studies have consistently shown that QoL is negatively affected by anxiety among medical students [38, 39]. Furthermore, there is evidence that shows a strong correlation between QoL and depression [40, 41]. Another national cross-sectional study used a multivariate analysis to show that higher mental summary scores were protective against depressive symptoms and, better physical health was associated with a decreased risk of depression; the same study also found that QoL was itself associated with depressive symptoms [42]. Moreover, another study predicted that the severity of anxiety symptoms is linked to greater health-related QoL impairment in college students; and that impaired mental health is more intensely correlated with depression than physical functioning impairment [43]. In light of the current evidence, we infer that anxiety symptoms will reduce QoL, and decreased QoL can lead to the occurrence of depressive symptoms among college students. Accordingly, we assumed that QoL could mediate anxiety and depression in our research.\nMoreover, existing researches on sleep quality and QoL have found that college students\nwith a history of sleep problems are more likely to experience a decreased QoL [44, 45]. Another study indicated that lower quality of sleep was significantly associated with other physical and psychological problems [46]. Furthermore, several researchers have identified a close association between sleep problems and QoL [47, 48].\nIn light of existing research and the previously mentioned gap in the literature, the goal of\nthis study was to determine the association between anxiety and depression among college students. Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of sleep quality and QoL in the relationship between anxiety and symptoms of depression using a path analysis."

The GAD-2 is used to assess the\nfrequency to which college students have experienced core anxiety symptoms during the past 2 weeks. It is comprised of 2 items (i.e. \u201cFeeling nervous, anxious, or on edge\u201d and \u201cNot being able to stop or control worrying\u201d). Responses are given on a 4-point Likert scale (not at all = 0; several days = 1; more than half the days = 2; nearly every day = 3), higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms, and a score\ufffd 3 is considered acceptable cut-point in screening for GAD. In the current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.863.\nThe 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) [51, 52]. The PHQ-2 is used to assess\nthe frequency to which college students have experienced depressed symptoms during the past 2 weeks. It is comprised of 2 items (i.e. \u201cLittle interest or pleasure in doing things\u201d and \u201cFeeling down, depressed, or hopeless\u201d). Responses are also given on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268773 June 2, 2022 4 / 13\nThe total score ranges from 0 to 6, and a score\ufffd 3 is considered reasonable cut-point in screening for PHQ. In the current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.763.\nThe Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [53, 54]. The PSQI consists of 19 items and is\nused to evaluate sleep quality during the last month. This measure estimates 7 components of sleep, namely, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each component is evaluated on a four-point Likert scale with the total scores ranging from 0 to 21, and the higher scores, the poorer sleep quality.\nThe Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) [55, 56]. The SF-36 is a valid measure to examine\nQoL among general and specific populations. It contains 36 items, including 8 dimensions, namely, Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), Body Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Validity (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). In addition, the first four dimensions constitute Physical Component Summary (PCS), and the last four dimensions constitute Mental Component Summary (MCS). Each item is scored separately and then converted to form a 0\u2013100 scale, with greater scores illustrating the good quality of physical or mental health conditions. In the current study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.752."

The results showed that anxiety affected depression both directly and indirectly via sleep quality and QoL. Furthermore, sleep quality and QoL partially mediated the effects of anxiety on symptoms of depression. Specifically, anxiety was associated with poorer sleep quality, poorer sleep quality was associated with lower QoL, and a lower QoL predicted increased depression.\nIn accordance with previous research, we found that anxiety was associated with sleep qual-\nity, QoL, and depression. A previous study showed that anxiety may affect sleep quality through the gray matter volume of the right insula [28]. A study among medical students showed that students with anxiety symptoms experienced functional impairment in the psychological, social, and environmental domains of QoL [38]. Another study found that individuals with social anxiety disorder were more likely to score lower in the social, educational, and occupational domains, which might contribute to a poorer QoL [58]. One possible explanation for this strong association between anxiety and depression may be the similarity of their symptoms, which can include sleep problems, restlessness, and fatigue.\nA different study indicated that the higher the anxiety level of college students, the stronger\nthe excitability of the brain nerves, and the more difficult it is for individuals to fall asleep. In turn, the psychological pressure caused by struggling to fall asleep aggravated the degree of anxiety and finally led to individuals reducing their subjective evaluation of self-sleep quality [59]. Circadian rhythm may also play a vital role in the association between sleep quality and\nTable 3.

For example, previous studies have demonstrated that circadian rhythm impacts affective disturbances, such as bipolar disorder and depression [60, 61]. During adolescence, the evening chronotype undergoes a dramatic change, which indicates vulnerability to emotional difficulties [62]. Additionally, the HPA axis is regarded as a physiological link between mental health and sleep problems [63\u201365]. A plausible explanation for the median effects of sleep quality may be that anxiety symptoms can disrupt college students\u2019 normal sleep patterns, which results in a higher risk of depression.\nIndividuals with anxiety symptoms can experience both physical and psychological symptoms that interfere with school, work, and daily life [66]. The adverse effects of anxiety symptoms could result in low life satisfaction for individuals [67] and a productivity loss in society [68].

Negative emotions, such as anxiety, lead to a decline in mental health; and subsequently affect QoL, which, in turn, results in bad emotions, including depression.\nCollege students worry about studying, success, and future plans, and they may experience\nthe negative effects of anxiety as a result. Moreover, college students with anxiety symptoms often suffer from sleep problems due to circadian rhythms and the HPA axis. Since students with poor sleep quality are often lacking energy during the day, they may grow dependent on coffee, which makes them unable to fall asleep at night. Thus, they may kill time by using electronic devices at night. In short, coffee consumption and the use of electronic devices late at night will worsen their quality if sleep [48]. This will affect not only their quality of physical and mental life, but also \\social relations, thereby reducing social QoL [45, 47, 70]. Irregular work, rest and insomnia will lead to a decline in sleep quality (which will lead to inattention while working and studying during the day), decrease in social activities (more likely to cause depression), and seriously affect the psychological state. These adverse psychological states further affect the QoL and daily life of college students [71].\nThe findings from the present study have significant clinical implications for psychologists\nwho work with college students, as it provides evidence showing that higher anxiety levels lead to poorer sleep quality, lower QoL, and higher levels of depression. These findings provide preliminary support for targeting sleep quality and QoL in preventative interventions, particularly for college students with a higher propensity for anxiety. These results suggest that addressing sleep quality and QoL during the early stages of anxiety may prevent the onset of depression.\nHowever, the current study has some limitations. First, the cross-sectional approach makes it impossible to infer causality. Future longitudinal studies are essential to confirm the predictive role of sleep quality and QoL in mediating the relationship between anxiety and depression among college students. Second, other confounding factors such as family situations, lifestyle, and eating habits were not explored in the current study.\nIn summary, our research found that sleep quality and QoL had a mediating effect on the\nrelationship between anxiety and depression. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention among college students with anxiety, especially those with poorer sleep quality and lower QoL. Therefore, it is important for universities to take the initiative to identify students who are at a risk of developing psychological states and take steps to help support them from an early stage."
