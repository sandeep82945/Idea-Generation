    "abstractText": "This study evaluated the toxicity associated with radiation techniques on curative reirradiation (re-RT) in patients with thoracic recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). From 2011 to 2019, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 63 patients with salvage re-RT for in-field or marginal recurrence of NSCLC at two independent institutions. Re-RT techniques using X-ray beams and proton beam therapy (PBT) were also included. Re-RT had a 2-year overall survival (OS) and local progression-free survival of 48.0% and 52.0%, respectively. Fifteen patients experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity after re-RT. The complication rates were 18.2% (4/22) and 26.8% (11/41) in PBT patients and X-ray patients, respectively. Airway or esophageal fistulas occurred in seven patients (11.1%). Fistulas or severe airway obstruction occurred in patients with tumors adjacent to the proximal bronchial tree and esophagus, who underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) or concurrent chemotherapy, and with a higher dose exposure to the esophagus. In conclusion, salvage re-RT was feasible even in patients with local recurrence within the previous RT field. PBT showed similar survival outcomes and toxicity to those of other techniques. However, thoracic re-RT should be performed carefully considering tumor location and RT regimens such as the fraction size and concurrent chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide [1]. Of all lung cancer patients, 85% are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [2]. The treatment options for NSCLC include surgery, radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or multimodal therapy, depending on the clinical stage and the patient\u2019s condition. RT combined with chemotherapy is the core treatment strategy for locally advanced NSCLC [3,4]. However, after curative treatment, 3\u201320% of patients experience thoracic recurrence despite the absence of distant metastasis [5]. As a treatment for locoregional recurrence, salvage surgery is recommended for patients with a history of RT. However, patients are usually diagnosed with advanced stages or inoperable conditions. In these cases, despite the high risk of treatment-related complications, salvage re-irradiation (re-RT) can be carefully considered [5\u20137]. Advancements in RT techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT), have led to the practice of thoracic re-RT in the clinical setting. In terms of clinical results, re-RT for locoregional recurrent NSCLC\nLife 2022, 12, 292. https://doi.org/10.3390/life12020292 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\nLife 2022, 12, 292 2 of 10\nshows a 2-year overall survival (OS) of 30\u201340%, with a grade \u22653 lung toxicity rate of 0\u201320% [8]. PBT has less risk owing to its unique characteristic, the Bragg peak. However, its outcome is similar to that of conventional RT or IMRT, and some studies have even reported higher toxicity rates of >40% [9]. Previously, our study on salvage PBT including 37 patients who underwent re-RT showed a 2-year OS of 79.2% and a grade 3 or higher toxicity rate of 18.9% [5], which included out-field thoracic recurrences. In this study, we aimed to compare the toxicity between PBT and RT techniques using X-ray as salvage re-RT for the in-field or marginal recurrence of NSCLC patients."

The patients were initially diagnosed with NSCLC and underwent RT with curative intent. The patterns of failure after initial RT were considered as the inclusion criteria and were defined as follows: in-field failure, wherein the geometric center of the recurrent mass is within the 50% isodose line, and marginal failure, wherein it is within 25\u201350% of the isodose line [5,8]. Moreover, patients who underwent re-RT with curative intent were included in the study. Patients who had undergone palliative re-RT, received a biologically effective radiation dose with an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy (BED10) <60 Gy or an equivalent dose at a fractionation of 2 Gy (EQD2) <50 Gy (n = 17), or adjuvant re-RT after salvage surgery were excluded (n = 1). Finally, 63 patients were included in the study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Samsung Medical Center (No. 2021-01-019), and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the IRB because of the retrospective nature of the study."

As target delineation for re-RT, the gross tumor volume included all suspicious malignant lesions, while the internal target volume was delineated based on the respiratory phases of four-dimensional CT. The clinical target volume (CTV) was expanded with a 5\u20137 mm margin from the ITV and was modified according to the anatomical boundary of the adjacent organs, if necessary. The planning target volume or block margin was determined based on the RT modalities: 5 mm for IMRT, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and PBT; and 1.0\u20131.5 cm for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). RT doses were administered in various fractionated schedules based on the treatment conditions, including the estimated risk of esophagitis: 60\u201370 Gy with 2\u20132.2 Gy per fraction for concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 50\u201366 Gy with 2\u20138 Gy per fraction for RT alone, and 48\u201360 Gy with 12\u201315 Gy per fraction for SBRT [3,5,10,11]. Generally, the dose fractionation schedules did not differ between XRT and PBT or between the two centers. We also geometrically reviewed the re-RT plans for all patients. The centrality of the re-RT target was defined as follows: peripheral, distant from the organs at risk (OARs) such as the proximal bronchial tree, trachea, or esophagus; central, within 2 cm from the OARs; and ultracentral, abutted to the OARs. For dosimetric analyses, the doses for initial RT and re-RT were merged and calibrated based on the anatomy shown on simulation CT at re-RT using the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) version 6.2.0.7 (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden). The dose distribution from the initial RT was deformed according to the results of the simulation CT at re-RT using deformable image registration, and the final dose distribution from the initial and re-RT was calculated using the RayStation TPS. The radiation oncologists and two experienced medical physicists (E.C. and K.J.) confirmed that cumulative dosimetry worked properly for all patients.\nLife 2022, 12, 292 3 of 10"

Although the clinical outcome such as OS and LPFS were comparable to other studies, severe RT-related complications were not significantly different in RT techniques, 26.8% with the XRT and 18.2% with PBT. Although patients with out-field recurrence were excluded, the results of this study were comparable with those of other studies, as summarized in our previous study [5]. The administration of thoracic re-RT was carefully considered, as it can potentially cause severe complications. Frequently, patients had a maximum dose exposure at the OARs even before re-RT, while radiation-resistant recurrent tumors require high-dose RT of 60\u201366 Gy for curative treatment [13]. A study on PBT reported a grade \u22653 toxicity rate of 42% [14], while other studies showed tolerable toxicity rates. The risk factors for thoracic re-RT include the time interval between the initial RT and re-RT, tumor volume, tumor location, and dose exposure to critical organs [15]. Bronchial or esophageal fistulas (7/63, 11.1%) or airway obstruction (3/63, 4.8%) were reported in our study. No significant difference was observed between the time interval and tumor volume; the relationship between these two factors remains unclear in some previous studies [16]. Regarding tumor location, most events occurred in the adjacent proximal bronchi and esophagus (Figure 1). Chao et al. reported the risk of centrally located tumors in the region of thoracic re-RT [9]; McAvoy et al. also showed that the rates of cardiac and pulmonary toxicity increased in central tumors within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree [9,16]. Additionally, tumors in the esophagus are as important as those in the bronchial tree as broncho-esophageal fistulas commonly develop; one patient developed an esophageal fistula outside of the at-risk area within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree. This means that the location of tumors in the esophagus and proximal bronchial tree should be assessed to determine the need for re-RT. Therefore, centrally located or adjacent tumors should be considered relative contraindications for salvage re-RT. Another risk factor is dose exposure to critical organs. However, there are no definite guidelines for the dose constraints of thoracic RT. Most patients with esophageal fistulas received Dmax >65 Gy at re-RT and a cumulative Dmax >110 Gy. Additionally, the volume of irradiation, such as V50, showed a similar pattern. In 3D-CRT patients, it was difficult to control the OAR dose, and this seemed to cause more esophageal complications. Other studies also reported that a higher dose exposure or a higher radiation dose was related to the occurrence of esophageal complications [16]. Although the cut-off value could not be clearly established due to the rare occurrence of some adverse events, the esophageal dose\nLife 2022, 12, 292 8 of 10\nin the re-RT plan and its cumulative dose are important factors that need to be evaluated. Volumetric parameters such as V20 or V5 and mean lung dose are usually used regardless of RT and RT status. Some studies have confirmed that a high volume or high dose of these parameters is a risk factor [16]. However, severe lung complications, such as bronchial fistula or obstruction, were not related to the usual parameters in this study. This means that critical injury during thoracic re-RT occurred in patients who received high doses of radiation in serial organs such as the bronchus and esophagus, and not the whole lungs. Therefore, thoracic re-RT was carefully performed in patients with tumors of the bronchial tree and esophagus with a dose limitation, although the constraints should be studied using a larger population. Other factors require consideration to ensure safe re-RT. Salvage re-RT was performed heterogeneously, which included various RT fraction sizes [17] and techniques. SBRT has been considered in patients with small and localized tumors in the peripheral lung [18,19]. A hypofractionated schedule has been commonly administered, which was 39% in a multiinstitutional study on PBT [17]. These studies suggest that hypofractionated schedules are safe and effective. However, these are inconclusive because the cases were very limited in terms of tumor extent and location. In our study, two cases of lung complications were reported in five patients who underwent SBRT as re-RT. Furthermore, some patients received concurrent chemotherapy [13]. One-third of our patients also underwent concurrent chemotherapy. However, the benefits of concurrent chemotherapy have not been confirmed for salvage re-RT. In this study, most patients with esophageal fistulas received concurrent chemotherapy at re-RT, although the p-value was 0.070. A multi-institutional prospective study also reported higher treatment toxicities with concurrent chemotherapy (53% vs. 16%, p = 0.003) [9]. Therefore, at re-RT, all settings, including RT regimens or concurrent chemotherapy, should be carefully evaluated. Regarding the choice of re-RT technique, it remains uncertain whether PBT has better clinical outcomes, which has only been reported in a few studies with relatively small sample sizes [5,8,9,13,17]. Generally, PBT is associated with similar or higher treatment toxicity [5,20\u201322]. However, PBT exhibits strong physical and biological properties. PBT plans can spare relatively low-dose areas using the Bragg peak compared with IMRT. Hypofractionated RT may be a safe re-RT technique for patients with early recurrent stages; those with poor lung function or underlying lung disease might benefit from this technique [23]. In this study, lung complications were mostly observed in XRT patients, and most of the dosimetric lung parameters were better in the PBT group. Furthermore, the relative biological effectiveness of proton beams is approximately 1.1, which is still promising for increasing local control under the same disease conditions in terms of radioresistance [24]. We believe that PBT would be beneficial in some selected cases, but further studies are needed to confirm this. This study had some limitations. Despite the collaboration between the two institutions, this study was retrospective in nature. Furthermore, the study population was relatively small, which was similar to that of other re-RT studies. Extremely rare toxicity-related events occurred in this study, which cannot be used for specific analyses. Unfortunately, the initial and salvage treatments were heterogeneous. Hence, a well-organized, prospective, larger-sized study is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of specific RT techniques for re-RT."
