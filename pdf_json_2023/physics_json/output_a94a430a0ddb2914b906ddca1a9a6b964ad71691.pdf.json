            "text": "2 Fluorinated amino acids are a promising entry point for incorporating new-to-Nature chemistries in biological 3 systems. Hence, novel methods are needed for the selective synthesis of these building blocks. In this study, 4 we focused on the enzymatic synthesis of fluorinated alanine enantiomers. To this end, the alanine 5 dehydrogenase from Vibrio proteolyticus and the diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from Symbiobacterium 6 thermophilum were applied to the in vitro production of (R)-3-fluoroalanine and (S)-3-fluoroalanine, 7 respectively, using 3-fluoropyruvate as the substrate. Additionally, an alanine racemase from Streptomyces 8 lavendulae, originally selected for setting an alternative enzymatic cascade leading to the production of these 9 non-canonical amino acids, had an unprecedented catalytic efficiency in the -elimination of fluorine from 10 the monosubstituted fluoroalanine. The in vitro enzymatic cascade based on the dehydrogenases of V. 11 proteolyticus and S. thermophilum included a cofactor recycling system, whereby a formate dehydrogenase 12 from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (either native or engineered) coupled formate oxidation to NAD(P)H formation. 13 Under these conditions, the reaction yields for (R)-3-fluoroalanine and (S)-3-fluoroalanine reached >85% on 14 the fluorinated substrate and proceeded with complete enantiomeric excess. Moreover, the selected 15 dehydrogenases were also able to catalyze the conversion of trifluoropyruvate into trifluorinated alanine, as 16 a first-case example of biocatalysis with amino acids carrying a trifluoromethyl group. 17\nINTRODUCTION 1 2 The extensive array of chemicals essential to our contemporary society is predominantly supplied by the 3 chemical industry. These chemicals include polymers, agrochemicals and pharma molecules, the production 4 of which largely depends on traditional synthetic chemistry. Conventional approaches for the synthesis of 5 these compounds often employ processes and reagents leading to significant environmental hazards, notably 6 through the generation of toxic by-products and waste streams [1,2]. With increasing environmental 7 awareness, there is a growing interest in leveraging Nature and biosynthesis as alternative sources for 8 fulfilling chemical production needs [3,4]. The molecular diversity in the biosphere is considered nearly 9 boundless, yet only a small portion of these biomolecules has been explored so far [5]. Nonetheless, the 10 connection between industrially-relevant chemicals and naturally-occurring products is remarkably limited [6]. 11 A key factor contributing to this disparity is the industrial reliance on synthetic compounds containing chemical 12 elements, e.g. fluorine (F) [7] and other halogen atoms [8], which are not typically found in natural biological 13 systems [9,10]. Establishing a biotechnological alternative to chemical synthesis requires the rational design 14 of biosynthetic pathways and degradation routes either as enzymatic cascades in vitro [11,12] or as part of 15 living organisms [13], enabling them to execute new-to-Nature chemistries [14,15]. 16 17 Amino acids represent an attractive target for bioproduction due to their wide industrial exploitation [16]. The 18 twenty standard proteinogenic amino acids, while relatively simple in structure, are fundamental components 19 of all naturally-occurring polypeptides. Furthermore, the D-enantiomers of some amino acids are essential in 20 the formation of the bacterial peptidoglycan [17] and are involved in the biosynthesis of natural peptide 21 antibiotics [18]. In this sense, introducing the D-enantiomers of non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) into the 22 chemistry of living bacterial cells represents an effective approach to substantially enhance the chemical 23 diversity of cellular structures [19-21], but the biocatalysis toolbox for their production is somewhat limited 24 [22,23]. Among the broad group of NCAAs, fluorinated amino acids (FAAs), which contain one or more F 25 atoms, have considerable potential for engineering new chemistries. The small size of the F atom renders 26 FAAs structurally similar to their natural analogues, making them largely indistinguishable by the cellular 27 machinery [24]. Currently, most FAAs are produced through chemical synthesis [25], although some of them 28 can be obtained enzymatically in vitro [24,26]. Notably, 4-fluoro-L-threonine is a naturally-occurring FAA 29\nproduced by Streptomyces cattleya and other actinomycetes [27]. To date, research approaches for the 1 production of FAAs have primarily focused on the L-enantiomers, exploring their effects when incorporated 2 into individual proteins or at the cellular proteome-level. However, the impact of D-enantiomers of FAAs on 3 the cellular metabolism remains largely unexplored and, to best of our knowledge, there are no reports on 4 the biosynthesis of these compounds at chiral purity. 5 6 Alanine (Ala) represents an interesting model for studying the biosynthesis FAAs. The synthesis of Ala occurs 7 through a single enzymatic step involving the reductive amination of pyruvate (Pyr). Owing to the small size 8 of the methyl substituent in this amino acid, the proximity of the F substituent to the amino group allows strong 9 electron-withdrawing effect of the halogen atom to influence the amino group [28], thus making Ala a 10 particularly interesting case study. In terms of structure, glycine is the only amino acid that is simpler than 11 Ala. However, fluorinated derivatives of glycine at the C position have been found to be unstable, 12 undergoing rapid defluorination [29]. To date, examples on the bioproduction of 3-fluoroalanine (FAla) have 13 been limited to the L-enantiomer [(R)-FAla], which can be obtained through the action of either L-Ala 14 dehydrogenases or -transaminases on 3-fluoropyruvate (FPyr) [30-32]. The subsequent formation of the 15 D-enantiomer [(S)-FAla] could theoretically be achieved through the action of an alanine racemase (Scheme 16 1). However, this type of enzyme is inhibited by FAla [33], which contributes to the known antibacterial 17 properties of some FAAs. An alternative approach could involve the use of meso-diaminopimelate 18 dehydrogenases, enzymes that have garnered interest due to their broad substrate specificity and ability to 19 produce target compounds with high enantiomeric excess [34,35]. meso-Diaminopimelate dehydrogenases 20 have proven useful for the biosynthesis of different D-amino acids, including D-Ala [34] and D-phenyalanine 21 [36]. Yet, there are no available reports of their activity on fluorinated derivatives of Pyr or in the production 22 of FAAs\u2014in contrast with the increasing need of synthetic tools to produce these building blocks towards 23 establishing novel chemistries. 24 25 In this work, we explored the enzymatic production of mono- and tri-fluorinated Ala from FnPyr (with n = 1 or 26 3). To this end, we recombinantly produced an alanine dehydrogenase from Vibrio proteolyticus (VpALDH) 27 and a diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH). The kinetics of 28 these two enzymes against FPyr and 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvate (F3Pyr) were determined in vitro, together with 29\nthe enantiomer distribution of the corresponding FnAla produced. An efficient NAD(P)H regeneration cycle, 1 based on a NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Pseudomonas sp. 101 and an engineered 2 derivative that exhibits increased specificity for NADP+, was implemented to support high-yield bioproduction 3 of FAla. This approach boosted the reaction yields to ~90% and 18 mM for the D-enantiomer and ~100% and 4 20 mM for the L-enantiomer of the FAA. Furthermore, an alanine racemase from Streptomyces lavendulae 5 (SlAlaR), originally selected as a candidate for assembling these enzymatic cascades, was found to possess 6 an unexpectedly high defluorinating activity on FAla via -elimination. Taken together, the results discussed 7 in this article represent a first-case report on the enzymatic synthesis of both a fluorinated D-amino acid and 8 a trifluorinated version of Ala. 9\n10 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 11 12 Rationale behind enzyme selection, production and purification for establishing in vitro synthesis of 13 fluorinated amino acids 14 15 In this study, the selection of enzymes was based on their potential to enhance the production of fluorinated 16 alanine (FAla), with an initial round of biocatalyst selection informed by examples in the primary literature. 17 Alanine dehydrogenase, derived from Vibrio proteolyticus (VpALDH, a NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase), was 18 chosen due to its well-documented ability to maintain >70% substrate specificity for 3-fluoropyruvate (FPyr) 19 in comparison to its non-fluorinated analogue, pyruvate (Pyr) [31]. The diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from 20 Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH, a NADP+-dependent enzyme), on the other hand, was selected 21 based on its known substrate promiscuity [34]. The Ala racemase of Streptomyces lavendulae (SlAlaR) was 22 picked owing to its reported resistance to inactivation by D-cycloserine (4-amino-3-isoxazolidinone) [37]\u2014a 23 molecule that, similarly to FAla, can inhibit AlaR by forming an adduct with the pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) 24 cofactor and a key catalytic lysine residue in the active site [38]. The particular architecture of the active site 25 of SlAlaR led to the hypothesis that this enzyme variant should be resistant to D-cycloserine inhibition, hence, 26 it was hypothesized that this AlaR variant might also exhibit increased tolerance towards FAla, an essential 27 requirement in this study (Scheme 1). Additionally, an Ala racemase from Escherichia coli (EcAlaR) was 28 adopted as a reference, since its inhibition by FAla has been previously characterized [39]. Finally, a NAD+-29\ndependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (NAD-PseFDH) and an engineered 1 variant with increased NADP+ preference [40] were incorporated in the designs towards efficient regeneration 2 of NAD(P)H, cofactors required by both VpALDH and StDAPDH. All the enzymes were successfully produced 3 in E. coli BL21(DE3) from the corresponding synthetic DNA fragments and purified to homogeneity through 4 one-step Ni2+-nitriloacetic (NTA) affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1) 5 showed that all the proteins were isolated with a high degree of purity. 6 7 Synthesis of FAla and F3Ala from the corresponding pyruvate substrates by two dehydrogenases 8 from Vibrio proteolyticus and Symbiobacterium thermophilum 9\n10 The initial observation that alanine dehydrogenases (ALDH) are capable of producing (R)-FAla through the 11 reductive amination of FPyr was documented in the seminal work of Ohshima et al. [30]. Notwithstanding, 12 this study predominantly focused on the affinity of this enzyme for halogenated substrates, yet a 13 comprehensive kinetic characterization of VpALDH was missing not only in the original report but also in 14 subsequent studies employing this enzyme as a biocatalyst [31,41,32]. Similarly, the broad substrate 15 specificity of StDAPDH has been underscored in the report by Gao et al. [34], yet experimental assays 16 specifically targeting FPyr have not been conducted for this enzyme or for any other biocatalyst within the 17 meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase family. Furthermore, there is a dearth of studies exploring the 18 enzymatic conversion of F3Pyr into the corresponding trifluorinated Ala\u2014a new-to-Nature building block with 19 potential for a range of biocatalysis applications [42]. To bridge this knowledge gap, particularly regarding 20 the production of FAla via reductive amination, and to evaluate the potential application of this process in 21 vivo, an in-depth analysis of the kinetics of both enzymes was executed in vitro. The experimental design 22 involved using Pyr, FPyr and F3Pyr as substrates. The enzymatic activities were quantified through 23 continuous spectrophotometric monitoring of NAD(P)H oxidation according to the enzymatic reaction in the 24 reductive substrate amination direction, as indicated for pathways involving either ALDH (Scheme 1) or 25 DAPDH (Scheme 2). The kinetic data were analyzed through the canonical Michaelis-Menten model (Fig. 26 1A). 27\nVpALDH showed a similar affinity for the non-fluorinated and the monofluorinated Pyr substrate (Km = 0.29 1 and 0.18 mM, respectively; Table 1), but the presence of F mediated a dramatic decrease in the 2 dehydrogenase activity (i.e. only ca. 5% of the Vmax was retained when using FPyr as substrate). This result 3 seems to contradict the >70% specific activity on FPyr previously reported for this enzyme [31], probably 4 attributable to differences in the assay setup (e.g. substrate concentration). The Vmax value attained in our 5 present study, however, is close to the ~6% reported for the ALDH enzyme from Helicobacter aurati when 6 acting on fluorinated Pyr [32]. One way or the other, kcat/Km values were reduced by >10-fold (from ca. 597 7 to 46 s\u20131 mM\u20131) when FPyr was used as the substrate. F3Pyr, on the other hand, had a strong detrimental 8 effect on both the substrate affinity (Km = 121 mM) and the activity (ca. 0.05 U mg\u20131) of VpALDH (Table 1). 9 The strong negative impact on the enzyme activity might be due to the polarizing effect of the three F atoms 10 (in the CF3 group), which are expected to substantially modify the formal distribution of charges in their 11 molecular surroundings [43]. Conversely, the loss of substrate affinity might seem more surprising, since the 12 small size of F is not predicted to alter the intramolecular structure significantly or cause steric hindrances at 13 the catalytic pocket [9]. However, the analysis of the crystal structure of the ALDH enzyme of Mycobacterium 14 tuberculosis indicates that the stabilization of Pyr in the active site depends on the formation of specific 15 hydrogen bonds and charge interactions through three conserved amino acid residues [44], a conformational 16 architecture that might be disturbed by the polarizing effect of the three F substituents in F3Pyr. The catalytic 17 residues involved in these interactions (Arg15, Lys75 and His96) were confirmed to play the same stabilizing 18 role in the Gk3448ALDH enzyme of Geobacillus kaustophilus [45], and they are all conserved in VpALDH 19 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Prompted by these results, we also analyzed the catalytic performance of 20 StDAPDH under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 1A). The affinity of StDAPDH for the non-fluorinated, native 21 substrate was ca. 23-fold lower than that of VpALDH; the kcat values were similarly lower for the 22 dehydrogenase of S. thermophilum. In general, the trend observed in the Km and Vmax values evaluated in 23 the presence of fluorinated substrates was similar to the results obtained for the VpALDH enzyme. The effect 24 of FPyr was especially noticeable at the activity level, while the affinity was kept within the same order of 25 magnitude. The kcat/Km was reduced by ca. 1,000-fold in the presence of FPyr (ca. 7\u00d710\u20133 s\u20131 mM\u20131). 26 Moreover, in this case, the reduction of both affinity and activity when using F3Pyr as the substrate was too 27 strong to allow for the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters (Table 1). 28\nTo facilitate a direct and quantitative assessment of the formation of the target fluorinated products, serving 1 as a supplementary method to the in vitro assays (Fig. 1A), individual reactions were prepared under the 2 same conditions described above and analyzed by both 19F-NMR (Fig. 1B and 1D) and high-resolution LC-3 MS(MS) (Fig. 1C). In the case of the 19F-NMR assays, the dynamics of both substrate depletion and product 4 generation in the reactions were continuously monitored in real-time. This combined analytical approach 5 provided a deeper understanding of the reaction kinetics and enabled the direct visualization of the 6 transformation of the substrates within the reaction milieu. Both FPyr and F3Pyr could be easily identified by 7 19F-NMR (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B, respectively). In general, the chemical shifts and the multiplet 8 patterns observed in these samples matched the expected signals for both FAla and F3Ala, regardless of the 9 selected enzyme (VpALDH or StDAPDH, Fig. 1D). FAla formation, evaluated as the time-resolved intensity of 10 the F-signal in the samples, reached a plateau around 40 min of incubation for both enzymes (Fig. 1B). 11 Conversely, the transformation of F3Pyr followed a linear kinetic over 2 h, with a significantly lower conversion 12 rate mediated by the action of StDAPDH (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the lower rates observed for this substrate 13 prevented the reactions to reach equilibrium within the duration of the assay. These results recapitulate the 14 experimental observations in the assays where product formation was inferred from the rates of NADH 15 oxidation (Table 1). 16 17 To further verify the chemical identity of the expected FAAs, the samples were also submitted to LC-MS(MS) 18 analysis in positive-heated electrospray ionization (HESI) mode (Fig. 1C). While no significant signal could 19 be detected in the blank (control) experiments, the reaction samples displayed signals with an experimental 20 m/z fitting the predicted values for FAla and F3Ala\u2014for FAla (C3H6FNO2), m/z = 108.045-108.046 and for 21 F3Ala (C3H6F3NO2), m/z = 144.026-144.027 (Fig. 1C). The predicted masses for both enzymes and 22 substrates were likewise confirmed in these assays. An MS(MS) validation was successfully carried out for 23 every condition except for F3Ala production by StDAPDH, due to limited signal intensity. The full MS(MS) 24 spectra for the conversion of FPyr into FAla by both VpALDH and StDAPDH are presented in Supplementary 25 Fig. S4A and S4B, respectively; while the MS(MS) spectrum for the transformation of F3Pyr by VpALDH is 26 shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. The 19F-NMR spectra further confirmed the identity of the target fluorinated 27 products, with relative intensities considerably higher for FAla than F3Ala (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, the spectra 28 for the trifluorinated product were acquired using 4 times more scans in order to increase the signal intensity. 29\nInterestingly, the analysis of the performance of StDAPDH against F3Pyr as a substrate revealed the formation 1 of side products with signal intensities within the range of (or even higher than) that expected for F3Ala (Fig. 2 1D). Both the chemical shift and the singlet nature of these signals are suggestive of the presence of a \u2013CF3 3 group. Since these fluorinated side products are virtually absent in the equivalent reaction mixture with 4 VpALDH as the biocatalyst, they are hypothesized to be the result of an alternative catalytic fate in the active 5 site of StDAPDH [46,47]. 6 7 An alanine racemase from Streptomyces lavendulae displays a secondary dehalogenation activity on 8 fluorinated amino acid analogues 9\n10 As indicated in the previous section, VpALDH had the best catalytic efficiency for the reductive amination of 11 FPyr, with a kcat/Km ca. 7,000-fold higher than StDAPDH (Table 1). However, (R)-FAla is the predicted product 12 for the VpALDH activity, which requires the action of a racemase to convert the enantiomer product into (S)-13 FAla. Hence, an experimental screening was established to investigate if SlAlaR is able to both escape the 14 inhibition mediated by FAla while catalyzing the formation of the desired enantiomer. As a first step, the 15 SlAlaR and EcAlaR racemases were assayed against its natural substrate, L-Ala, by coupling the reaction to 16 the Pyr-dependent formation of L-lactate (Supplementary Scheme S1). The reaction was monitored by 17 following the rate of NAD+ generation, which indicated that both SlAlaR and EcAlaR were active under these 18 conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B, respectively). Next, a similar spectrophotometric assay was 19 designed to couple the activity of AlaR with the oxidation of NADH in a different configuration (Fig. 2A). In 20 this case, the activity of VpALDH on FPyr was combined with SlAlaR and a D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, a 21 commercially-available DAAO from porcine kidney). DAAO displays specific activity on the D-enantiomer, 22 and this enzyme was expected to regenerate FPyr while producing H2O2 as byproduct of the deamination 23 reaction. Owing to the formation of this byproduct, which could potentially inhibit the enzymes if the peroxide 24 concentration increases above a threshold level, a catalase from bovine liver was added to the reaction 25 mixture. In these tests, NADH was added in excess (1 mM) in comparison to the FPyr concentration (0.5 26 mM) as a strategy to study the functionality of SlAlaR through the formation of NAD+ while preventing any 27 cofactor limitation. The underlying reasoning was that the reaction could only proceed to completion (i.e. 28 NADH exhaustion) only if the DAAO activity effectively replenished FPyr (Scheme 3). Control experiments 29\nwere prepared with either no enzymes added, VpALDH alone and also combining VpALDH and SlAlaR but 1 without DAAO. The latter assay was set to account for the potential -elimination activity of the AlaR enzyme, 2 which would lead to the release of non-fluorinated Pyr, thus creating an alternative regeneration cycle (Fig. 3 2A). Equivalent reaction mixtures, using an excess of FPyr (5 mM), were prepared as additional controls 4 (Supplementary Fig. S7). In these reactions, all NADH seemed to be consumed at similar rates in < 40 min 5 across the experimental conditions tested. 6 7 Surprisingly, in the reactions where FPyr was the limiting substrate, the combination of VpALDH and SlAlaR 8 was sufficient to reach similar NADH oxidation levels as those observed in assays containing VpALDH, SlAlaR 9 and DAOO (Fig. 2B). As expected, NAD+ formation was rather limited in assays containing VpALDH alone 10 (ca. half of the NADH was oxidized over the first 30 min of the test, indicative of the conversion of FPyr into 11 FAla without any further transformation taking place). These results suggested that the -elimination activity 12 of SlAlaR had to be much higher than the levels reported for its orthologue from E. coli, an AlaR enzyme 13 thoroughly characterized in vitro [39,48]. To further substantiate this hypothesis, the dynamics of the 14 fluorinated substrate (FPyr) and potential product(s) thereof were monitored by 19F-NMR in assays combining 15 VpALDH and SlAlaR (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S8). This time-resolved experiment revealed a steady 16 release of free fluoride (F\u2013) from the substrate that essentially mirrored the decrease in the FPyr-related F-17 signal, while the amount of FAla remained at background levels throughout the 2 h assay. 18 19 To explore the extent of the defluorination capacities of SlAlaR, a direct assay was prepared by testing the 20 activity of this enzyme against the pure enantiomers, i.e. (R)-FAla and (S)-FAla. Equivalent reactions were 21 prepared with EcAlaR to be used as a reference, on the basis of the well-characterized inhibition of this 22 enzyme in the presence of either FAla enantiomer. In these assays, the -elimination activity of the AlaR 23 racemases was evaluated through the quantification of the released Pyr by HPLC, which is stoichiometric 24 with respect to the formed F\u2013 via -elimination. The HPLC profile of these reactions indicated that Pyr was 25 indeed formed in the reactions containing SlAlaR, while residual amounts of the non-fluorinated product could 26 be detected in the assays with EcAlaR (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, (R)-FAla and (S)-FAla were transformed by 27 SlAlaR into Pyr at ca. 32% and 43% conversion yields, respectively (Fig. 2E). Conversely, EcAlaR had a very 28\nlow level of -elimination activity (paired to the inhibitory effect of fluorinated substrates), and only <0.5% 1 substrate conversion was detected for both FAAs. 2 3 The number of catalytic cycles per enzyme unit () was also explored for the two racemase enzymes under 4 study (Fig. 2F). Two biocatalyst concentrations (0.02 and 0.1 M) were used in these assays in order to 5 cover a 5-fold range of enzyme/substrate ratios, and the  values were determined as molecules of product 6 per molecule of enzyme. Under these assay conditions, Pyr formation was below the experimental limit of 7 detection when EcAlaR was used at 0.02 M. When the biocatalyst concentration was increased to 0.1 M, 8 EcAlaR mediated  = 400 cycles for (S)-FAla and  = 300 cycles for (R)-Fala (Fig. 2F). SlAlaR, on the other 9 hand, reached  = 34,000-42,000 cycles for (S)-FAla and  = 28,000-31,000 cycles for (R)-FAla when the 10 racemase was assayed at 0.02 and 0.1 M, respectively (Fig. 2F). Therefore, SlAlaR had an overall 100-fold 11 increased capacity of mediating FPyr defluorination as compared to EcAlaR. In this sense, the number of -12 elimination cycles prior irreversible inactivation by FAla (both enantiomers) has been experimentally 13 determined for EcAlaR [39] and other microbial racemases from Salmonella [38,49] and Pseudomonas 14 species [50]. In all these documented cases,  = 800 cycles (or even lower), which is substantially lower 15 than our experimental results for SlAlaR on this FAA. Although the in vitro assay adopted throughout this 16 study was merely designed to measure the number of catalytic cycles per unit of enzyme under selected 17 experimental conditions, our results would indicate that SlAlaR exhibits an unprecedent defluorination 18 capacity. This observation may have a functional connection to the fact that Streptomyces species are known 19 to host reactions for fluorometabolite biosynthesis [51], which require exquisite biochemical [52] and 20 physiological adaptations [53] to avoid toxicity. Based on the results described in this section, SlAlaR was 21 deemed unsuitable to racemize (R)-FAla as required to produce D-FAAs\u2014but it might be repurposed as a 22 biodehalogenation tool in future research. 23 24 In vitro NAD(P)H regeneration supports continuous production of FAla enantiomers with high yields 25 and purity 26 27 The main technical limitation for the enzymatic production of FAla from FPyr is the high cost of the redox 28 cofactor. Hence, cofactor regeneration strategies were contemplated in an attempt to improve the yield of 29\nthe target FAA in a cost-effective fashion. In this sense, energy- and redox-cofactor regeneration cycles have 1 been successfully included as part of enzymatic cascades in vitro to boost catalytic efficiency and product 2 formation [54-56]. One of the first approaches implemented to solve this stoichiometric bottleneck for FAA 3 synthesis was proposed by Ohshima et al. [30], and it consisted of coupling NADH regeneration to formate 4 oxidation by means of a FDH enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Not only is formate a low-cost, readily 5 available additive, but the product of the auxiliary reaction is CO2, which is spontaneously eliminated from 6 the reaction mixture by evaporation. While this setup works reasonably well with NADH, NADP+ reduction by 7 FDH is notoriously difficult. Previous attempts to modify the cofactor specificity of these dehydrogenases 8 came at the cost of a dramatic loss of affinity on the carbon substrate (Km = 1,000 mM for formate) [57]. In 9 this work, the FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 was selected to support redox cofactor cycling (Scheme 4). 10 Importantly, an engineered version of this enzyme can efficiently use NADP+ as the cofactor while retaining 11 ~15% of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type dehydrogenase against formate [40]. Thus, NAD-PseFDH (i.e. 12 the original enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. 101) was used to regenerate NADH to support the synthesis of 13 (R)-FAla from FPyr, catalyzed by VpADLH (Fig. 3A). Similarly, NADP-PseFDH was adopted to regenerate 14 NADPH for the production of (S)-FAla, catalyzed by StDADPH (Fig. 3A). A separate set of in vitro assays 15 confirmed the high specificity for either cofactor of the purified NAD-PseFDH and NADP-PseFDH enzymes 16 (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B, respectively). Both NH4Cl and formate were added to these cascade 17 reactions at high concentration (200 mM) to shift the equilibrium towards the reductive amination. The 18 corresponding reactions were analyzed in terms of total product formation and enantiomeric distribution. In 19 this case, a derivatization step with the commercially-available Marfey's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-20 5-L-alanine amide, FDAA) was incorporated into the experimental design to enable the separation of the two 21 FAla enantiomers by reversed-phase chromatography (Fig. 3B). Calibration curves, prepared with the 22 authentic (R)- and (S)-FAla standards treated with the Marfey\u2019s reagent (Supplementary Fig. S10A and 23 S10B, respectively), were run in parallel for each set of experiments. 24 25 Analysis of the HPLC profiles indicated that this methodology allowed for the determination of chiral purity 26 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, both VpALDH and StDAPDH had a specific pattern of product formation, mediating the 27 selective synthesis of (R)-FAla and (S)-FAla, respectively. High-conversion yields were detected for both 28 enzymes, with ~100% and ~90% conversion of FPyr into the target FAA products by VpALDH and StDAPDH, 29\nrespectively (Fig. 3D). These product yield values were similarly high when comparing reactions incubated 1 for either 12 or 24 h, suggesting that the excess of NH4Cl and formate was sufficient to keep the reaction 2 equilibrium shifted in the reductive amination direction. Moreover, the enantiomeric excess was 100% for 3 both enzymes (Fig. 3D), with no significant detection of the alternative enantiomer form of the FAA\u20144 underscoring the very selective nature of the reaction catalyzed by either dehydrogenase. Under these 5 conditions and upon an incubation of 24 h, (R)-FAla was produced at 20 mM in the enzymatic cascade 6 containing VpALDH, whereas the concentration of (S)-FAla reached 18 mM when StDADPH was used as the 7 biocatalyst. These values highlight the functionality of the FDH-based regeneration system, without which 8 the maximal production levels would be constrained by the amount of reduced cofactor added (1 mM). 9 Furthermore, the FAla yields on substrate obtained in this study rank among the highest reported for FAAs, 10 while the specific formation of the D-enantiomer had not been reported thus far. While these results were 11 somewhat within the range expected for VpADLH [30], the high performance of StDADPH underscores the 12 potential of this enzyme (and other diaminopimelate dehydrogenases) as a promising candidate for 13 supporting the enzymatic production of halogenated D-amino acids. 14 15 CONCLUSIONS 16 17 The present study provides new insights on the enzymatic production of fluorinated versions of Ala through 18 reductive amination. As the biocatalysis toolbox for the production of alternative building blocks, e.g. NCAAs, 19 continues to expand [58-60], approaches for the selective production of FAA enantiomers (especially, Ala 20 [61]) are increasingly needed. In this work, a kinetic characterization of StDADPH against FPyr and VpALDH 21 against both FPyr and F3Pyr showed that the monofluorinated substrate decreased the reaction rate with 22 little effect on the enzyme affinity, whereas the trifluorinated version of Pyr exhibited a strong detrimental 23 impact on both affinity and reaction velocity. The production of FAla was combined with the simultaneous 24 regeneration of the reduced cofactor through the oxidation of inexpensive formate by NAD(P)-PseFDH. The 25 implementation of this efficient regeneration system led to high conversion yields and enantiomeric purity for 26 both (S)-FAla and (R)-FAla. SlAlaR was determined to be an enzyme with an unexpected high efficiency in 27 dehalogenating FAla through -elimination, suggesting potential applications in the field of bioremediation 28 [62]. Taken together, our results provide novel approaches to the synthesis of non-canonical building blocks 29\nfor life [24], which constitutes a decisive step to engineering living cells with alternative lifestyles and functions 1 [63]. 2 3 METHODS 4 5 Chemicals and reagents. (S)-3-Fluoroalanine and (R)-3-fluoroalanine were purchased from BLD 6 Pharmatech Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Trifluoropyruvic acid was acquired from Fluorochem Ltd. (Glossop, UK), 7 isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Biosynth AG (Staad, Switzerland). All 8 other reagents were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. 9\n10 DNA synthesis, protein production and purification. The list of proteins produced and purified in this 11 study comprise an Ala dehydrogenase from Vibrio proteolyticus (VpALDH, UniProt ID O85596), a 12 diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH, UniProt ID Q67PI3), an 13 Ala racemase from Streptomyces lavendulae (SlAlaR, UniProt ID Q65YW7), an Ala racemase from 14 Escherichia coli (EcAlaR, UniProt ID P0A6B4), a NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from 15 Pseudomonas sp. 101 (i.e. NAD-PseFDH) and its site-specific engineered variant (originally named FDH V9) 16 [40], which is characterized by a shifted specificity towards NADP+ as a cofactor [64]. For the sake of 17 simplicity, the latter was termed NADP-PseFDH throughout this study. The gene fragments encoding VpALDH, 18 StDAPDH, SlAlaR and EcAlaR were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli K12 (and other Gram-negative 19 bacteria) as explained elsewhere [65] and synthesized de novo by Twist Bioscience (San Francisco, CA, 20 USA). Plasmids pZ-ASL [40] carrying either the coding sequence of the parental NAD-PseFDH or its 21 engineered version were kindly provided by the Bar-Even group (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant 22 Physiology, Golm, Germany). The selected genes were incorporated into a modified pET28a(+) vector 23 (NovagenTM, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) encoding the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavage site instead of the 24 conventional recognition motif for thrombin protease; the relevant coding sequences were amplified by PCR 25 from the synthetic DNA and the final constructs were obtained through uracil excision (USER) cloning [66]. 26 To this end, USER-primers were designed using the AMUSER tool [67]; the native START codon of the 27 genes indicated above was removed and the DNA sequence was modified to encode a protein carrying a N-28 terminal His6\u00d7-tag followed by the TEV site. The codon-optimized gene sequences and the oligonucleotides 29\nneeded for USER assembly are listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; the cloning procedures used in 1 this study followed well-established protocols [68-71]. Chemically-competent E. coli DH5 pir cells [72] 2 were used for routinary gene cloning and plasmid construction, and the resulting constructs were sequence-3 verified prior to be transferred into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) [F\u2013 \u2013 ompT hsdSB(rB\u2013, mB\u2013) gal 4 dcm (DE3); Thermo Fisher Co., San Jose, CA, USA] for protein production. 5 6 Protein production experiments started with the preparation of 10-mL precultures by inoculating single 7 colonies of the corresponding recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) strains. Precultures were prepared in 2\u00d7YT 8 medium [73] supplemented with 50 g mL\u20131 kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with agitation at 9 200 rpm. Then, a 5-mL aliquot of the precultures was used to start 500-mL cultures set in 2-L baffled 10 Erlenmeyer flasks, using 2\u00d7YT medium supplemented with 50 g mL\u20131 kanamycin. These cultures were 11 incubated under the same conditions indicated above until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5-0.7 12 was reached, whereupon the cultures were cooled down to 4\u00b0C with no further shaking. Protein expression 13 was induced by adding IPTG to the cultures at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The induced cultures were 14 incubated at 20\u00b0C and 200 rpm for 18 h, then harvested by centrifugation (4,000\u00d7g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and stored 15 at \u201320\u00b0C until further processing. Cell lysis was done by sonication, resuspending the frozen bacterial pellets 16 in 10 mL of buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate pH = 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole) and then 17 submitting the suspension to 2 rounds of ultrasound treatment using a Vibra-CellTM instrument (model 18 VCX130; Sonics & Materials Co., Newtown, CT, USA) equipped with a 6-mm probe (ref. 630-0422). The 19 procedure consisted of two 7 min-series of sonication at 50% amplitude through 30 s/30 s ON/OFF cycles 20 while keeping the samples on ice to prevent overheating. The lysates were then treated with 2.5 U mL\u20131 21 Pierce\u2122 universal nuclease for cell lysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.) at room temperature with gentle 22 shaking for 30 min, followed by 20 min centrifugation at 12,000\u00d7g and 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris. The resulting 23 supernatants were filtered through 0.2 m-membranes and the His6\u00d7-tagged enzymes were purified by 24 means of immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography [74]. Purification was performed using 1 mL of 25 Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid (NTA) resin (HisPurTM Ni-NTA resin, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.) loaded onto 10 mL-26 Pierce\u2122 disposable columns. The resin was equilibrated in 10 mL of buffer A, then the corresponding clear 27 lysate was passed through the resin, followed by a washing step with 20 mL of buffer A. The bound proteins 28 were eluted by applying 4 mL of buffer B (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH = 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM 29\nimidazole). The next step consisted of exchanging the buffer to C (20 mM sodium phosphate pH = 7.5, 300 1 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) by centrifuging the purified enzyme preparations (4,000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0C) using AmiconTM 2 Ultra-15 centrifugal filters of 10 kDa-pore size (Merck-MilliPoreSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). The absorbance 3 at 280 nm (A280) of purified enzyme preparations was measured in a NanoDrop\u2122 2000 spectrophotometer 4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.) and the protein concentration was determined based on the respective 5 theoretical molecular weight and the molar extinction coefficient (). The purity of the recombinant enzymes 6 was validated by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the enzyme preparations were stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. 7 8 Enzyme assays and assembly of in vitro enzyme cascades. Unless otherwise stated, the enzymatic 9 activities were determined by following the oxidation of the NAD(P)H cofactor over time. Samples were 10 prepared in triplicates in a final volume of 200 L and vigorously mixed with the assay mixture. The 11 absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was monitored in 50 s-intervals at 30\u00b0C in an EPOCH2 microplate reader 12 (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Enzymatic activities were determined by comparison with the 13 corresponding blank experiments, without any catalyst added. The composition of the different reaction 14 mixtures included 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH = 8.0), 200 mM NH4Cl and 0.1 g L\u20131 bovine serum albumin. 15 The initial concentration of FnPyr, enzyme and NAD(P)H was adjusted depending on the specific 16 requirements of the assay. NADH and NADPH were added to assays containing VpALDH and StDAPDH, 17 respectively. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was added at 50 M to assays including an AlaR enzyme. Thus, the 18 kinetics for VpALDH were determined using 0.5 mM NADH and a substrate range of 0-2.5 mM for Pyr; 0-10 19 mM for FPyr and 0-800 mM for F3Pyr. The kinetics for StDAPDH were analyzed against Pyr (0-100 mM) and 20 FPyr (0-120 mM) using 0.5 mM NADPH in all cases. Kinetic data were fit to the classical Michaelis-Menten 21 kinetic model using SigmaPlot 15.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Reaction samples to be 22 analyzed by LC-MS or NMR were prepared with an increased concentration of NAD(P)H of 2 mM in order to 23 boost the final amount of fluorinated product(s). 24 25 In LC-MS analyses, the enzymatic production of FAla was assayed by using 10 mM FPyr and 0.05 M 26 VpALDH or 20 M StDAPDH, as indicated in the specific experiment. The biosynthesis of F3Ala was performed 27 by mixing 100 mM F3Pyr with 8 M VpALDH or 150 M StDAPDH. The reactions were incubated at 800 rpm 28 and 30\u00b0C for 2 h, before stopping the assay by adding methanol at a final concentration of 50% (v/v). In the 29\ncase of StDAPDH and when using F3Pyr as the substrate, the reaction time was extended to 20 h. For NMR 1 analyses, the synthesis of FAla was carried out by using 10 mM FPyr and 0.05 M VpALDH or 20 M 2 StDAPDH. The enzymatic production of F3Ala was performed with 100 mM F3Pyr and 8 M VpALDH or 150 3 M StDAPDH. In all cases, deuterated water (D2O) was added at 10% (v/v). The reaction progression was 4 monitored by recording the spectra over time at 30\u00b0C as described in the text. 5 6 An enzyme cascade was designed to assay the activity of SlAlaR against (R)-FAla (Scheme 3). VpALDH and 7 SlAlaR were combined (each at 0.05 M) with 1 U mL\u20131 D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) from porcine kidney 8 (Merck product no. A5222) and 2 U mL\u20131 catalase from bovine liver (Merck-MilliPoreSigma, ref. C1345). 9 NADH was added at a final concentration of 1 mM, and FPyr was used as a substrate either at 0.5 mM 10 (limiting concentration compared to NADH) or 5 mM (excess concentration compared to NADH). 11 12 The ability of SlAlaR and EcAlaR to -eliminate F atoms was assayed directly against (S)-FAla and (R)-FAla 13 as the substrates. Two different amounts of enzyme, i.e. 0.02 M and 0.1 M, were added to 10 mM of each 14 FAla isomer. Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C and 800 rpm for 18 h and stopped by the end of the 15 incubation through the prompt addition of formic acid at 5% (v/v). The elimination of F was analyzed by HPLC 16 through the quantification of the released Pyr, stoichiometric with respect to F\u2013 formed. The number of 17 catalytic cycles per unit of biocatalyst was calculated using two different amounts of enzymes (i.e. 0.02 M 18 and 0.1 M) and comparing the amount of molecules of product measured with the number of molecules of 19 AlaR added to the assay. 20 21 Continuous enzymatic production of FAla in vitro. Production of FAla from FPyr using either VpALDH or 22 StDAPDH was combined with (NAD/NADP)-PseFDH and formate as a regeneration system for NAD(P)H 23 (Scheme 4). FPyr was added at 20 mM, whereas the initial concentration of formate and NH4Cl was set to 24 200 mM. For the production of (R)-FAla, VpALDH (5 M) was combined with NAD-PseFDH (5 M) and 1 mM 25 NADH. For the production of (S)-FAla, StDAPDH (50 M) was combined with NADP-PseFDH (5 M) and 1 26 mM NADPH. The reaction samples were incubated at 800 rpm and 30\u00b0C for 12 and 24 h and stopped by 27 freezing the reaction mixtures at \u201380\u00b0C. In all cases, the production and the enantiomeric distribution of FAla 28 on each condition were determined by HPLC. The HPLC analysis required a previous derivatization using 29\nthe Marfey's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide, FDAA), which reacts with primary amines 1 allowing for the separation of amino acid enantiomers by reverse-phase chromatography. The reaction 2 samples were diluted 1:25 prior to derivatization, which was performed by following the manufacturer\u2019s 3 instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). 4 5 HPLC analysis. The -elimination of F through the activity of either SlAlaR or EcAlaR against FAla was 6 analyzed by HPLC, based on the formation of Pyr. The analysis was performed on a Dionex UltiMateTM 3000 7 HPLC system equipped with a RefractoMax 521 refractive index detector (IDEX Health & Science LLC, Oak 8 Harbor, WA, USA). Samples were loaded onto an AminexTM HPX\u201087X ion exclusion (300\u00d77.8 mm) column 9 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) kept at 30\u00b0C, and the mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 at 10 0.6 mL min\u20131 with isocratic elution applied for 18 min [75]. A calibration curve of sodium pyruvate was 11 prepared from 0.2 to 12 mM in each set of measurements. Similarly, the production and enantiomeric 12 distribution of FAla was assessed by HPLC after derivatizing the samples. The analysis was performed on a 13 Dionex UltiMateTM 3000 HPLC system equipped with a Dionex UltiMateTM 3000 Diode Array Detector; 14 absorbance was continuously monitored at 310 nm. The quantification of FAla was based on a calibration 15 curve of the corresponding pure enantiomers in a range of concentrations from 0.08 to 1.25 mM. Samples 16 were loaded onto a Supelco\u2122 Discovery\u2122 HS F5-3 (15 cm\u00d72.1 mm, 3-m) column (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) kept 17 at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase was composed of 10 mM ammonium formate (pH = 3) and acetonitrile; an 18 isocratic elution with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile was applied for the first 0.5 min, then the concentration of 19 acetonitrile was increased to 60% (v/v) over a 6.5 min-gradient. The mobile phase was kept at 60% (v/v) 20 acetonitrile for 2.5 min and then the system was re-equilibrated to the initial conditions applying an isocratic 21 gradient of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile for 2.5 min. The flow was set to 0.7 mL min\u20131 for the entire run. Data 22 processing was carried out using the Chromeleon\u2122 Chromatography Data System (CDS) software 7.2.9 23 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). 24 25 Mass spectrometry analysis. LC-MS(MS) analysis was performed using an UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC binary 26 system coupled to an Orbitrap FusionTM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). Compound 27 separation was achieved using a WatersTM Acquity UPLC BEH Amide (10 cm\u00d72.1 mm, 1.7-m) column 28 equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH amide guard column kept at 40\u00b0C. The mobile phases consisted of 29\nMilliQTM water and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (buffer A), and acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (buffer B) at 1 a flow rate of 0.35 mL min\u20131. The elution was done through an initial step composed by 85% buffer B, held 2 for 0.8 min, followed by a linear gradient to 50% buffer B over 3.2 min and held for 1 min and then linearly 3 increased for 1 min to 30% buffer B before going back to initial conditions (the re-equilibration time was 3 4 min). The injection volume was set at 1 L. The MS(MS) measurements were done in positive-heated 5 electrospray ionization (HESI) mode with a voltage of 3,500 V acquiring in full MS/MS spectra (data 6 dependent acquisition-driven MS/MS) with a m/z range of 50\u2013500. The MS1 resolution was set at 120,000 7 and the MS2 resolution was set at 30,000. Precursor ions were fragmented by stepped high-energy collision 8 dissociation (HCD) using collision energies of 20, 40 and 55 eV. The automatic gain control (AGC) target 9 value was set at 4\u00d7105 for the full MS and 5\u00d7104 for the MS/MS spectral acquisition. Data analysis was 10 performed using the FreeStyle 1.8 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co.). 11 12 NMR analysis. 19F-NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker Avance IIITM HD spectrometer (Bruker Corp, 13 Billerica, MA, USA) operating at a magnetic field B = 18.8 T (19F = 752.83 MHz) and equipped with a 5-mm 14 TCI 2H/19F-13C-15N CryoProbe [76]. All samples were measured at 30\u00b0C unless otherwise noted. Each 15 sample (400 L) was added to a 5-mm NMR tube, shaken and quickly transferred to the spectrometer. For 16 each spectrum in the time series, 100 free induction decay signals were recorded using a /6 excitation pulse 17 and 3 s of interscan delay, yielding a data point for every 5 min; 20-Hz sample rotation was applied during 18 the measurements to increase mixing. Data analysis (including baseline correction and peak integration) was 19 performed using the TopSpin 4.1.3 NMR software (Bruker Corp.). Due to the overlap between the multiplet 20 signals from the FAla and FPyr, the total FAla signal intensity was determined by peak simulation of the most 21 deshielded peak (calibrated to \u2013228.760 ppm) of the ddd multiplet and multiplying this value by 8. The 22 resulting FAla signal intensity was then subtracted from the full integral covering both FAla and FPyr 23 multiplets to obtain the FPyr signal intensity. For the F3Ala samples, simple peak integration was applied 24 (using equal-sized integral regions) to extract the F3Ala and F3Pyr signal intensities [77]. 25 26 Data and statistical analysis. All the experiments reported were independently repeated at least three times 27 (as indicated in the corresponding figure or table legend), and the mean value of the corresponding parameter 28\n\u00b1 standard deviation is presented unless indicated otherwise. Data analysis was performed with Prism 8 1 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) unless differently specified. 2 3 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 4 5 M.N.D acknowledges the support received from the European Union's Horizon2020 Research and innovation 6 programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 713683 (COFUNDfellowsDTU) and 7 from the VELUX Foundation under the Villum Experiment program (project No. 40979).
