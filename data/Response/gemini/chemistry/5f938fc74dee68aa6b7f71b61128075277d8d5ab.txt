1. **Investigate the effects of varying the length and composition of the appended peptide blocks on the optical properties of ALucs.** This could be done by creating a series of ALucs with different lengths and compositions of appended peptide blocks and characterizing their BL intensities, spectra, and colors. This information could be used to design ALucs with specific optical properties for different applications.


2. **Explore the use of ALucs in bioassays and molecular imaging.** The new ALucs could be used to develop new bioassays and molecular imaging probes for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and cell biology. For example, ALucs could be used to create single-chain molecular strain probes that could be used to study protein-protein interactions in living cells.


3. **Investigate the catalytic mechanism of ALucs.** The exact mechanism by which ALucs catalyze the oxidation of coelenterazine is not fully understood. Future studies could use a variety of techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and computational modeling, to investigate the catalytic mechanism of ALucs. This information could be used to design ALucs with improved catalytic activity and specificity.


4. **Develop new ALucs with improved properties.** The new ALucs described in this paper have a number of desirable properties, such as high BL intensity, broad color range, and good stability. However, there is still room for improvement. Future studies could focus on developing ALucs with even higher BL intensity, broader color range, and improved stability.


5. **Explore the use of ALucs in other applications.** ALucs have the potential to be used in a variety of other applications, such as optogenetics, gene therapy, and drug delivery. Future studies could explore these applications and develop new ways to use ALucs to improve human health and well-being.
