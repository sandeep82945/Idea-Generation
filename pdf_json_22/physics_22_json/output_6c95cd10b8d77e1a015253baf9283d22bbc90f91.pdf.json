    "abstractText": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) is a novel detection technique that can provide global ionospheric products with high vertical resolution, high precision, and low cost. In recent years, China has launched the FY3 series of meteorological satellites carrying the first RO payload to simultaneously receive GPS (Global Positioning System) and BDS (BeiDou Navigation System) signals. In the accuracy assessment of RO products observed by GNOS (GNSS Occultation Sounder), the maximum F2-layer electron density (NmF2) of GPS occultation and BDS occultation have a standard deviation (std) of less than 20% in comparison with that of ionosondes. The std of F-layer worst-case ionospheric scintillation index ( 4 ) between COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) and FY3/GNOS is less than 0.1. The above results prove the high precision of FY3 ionospheric RO products. The RO products have been applied to preliminary scientific research and applications, e.g., the process of main phase and recovery phase of magnetic storms revealed by the NmF2 observed by FY3C/GNOS, the premidnight dynamics of F-layer strong scintillation during magnetic storms revealed by GNOS scintillation data, the ionospheric perturbation driven by Tonga volcano eruption revealed by FY3/GNOS, applications of the RO data for the research of sporadic E layers, evaluation of IRI model in statistics and ionospheric climatological characteristics, etc. With the successive network observation and continuous deployment of FY3 meteorological satellites, the continuous improvement of GNOS payload and the BDS system, massive high-precision ionospheric RO products will be developed and show more significant value.",

The above results prove the high precision of FY3 ionospheric RO products. The RO products have been applied to preliminary scientific research and applications, e.g., the process of main phase and recovery phase of magnetic storms revealed by the NmF2 observed by FY3C/GNOS, the premidnight dynamics of F-layer strong scintillation during magnetic storms revealed by GNOS scintillation data, the ionospheric perturbation driven by Tonga volcano eruption revealed by FY3/GNOS, applications of the RO data for the research of sporadic E layers, evaluation of IRI model in statistics and ionospheric climatological characteristics, etc. With the successive network observation and continuous deployment of FY3 meteorological satellites, the continuous improvement of GNOS payload and the BDS system, massive high-precision ionospheric RO products will be developed and show more significant value.\nIndex Terms\u2014Accuracy assessment, FY3, GNOS, ionospheric\nradio occultation, scientific application\nI.

As a novel detection technique, GNSS RO can obtain the three-dimensional structure of the global atmosphere and ionosphere in a long-term, stable, and economical way. Also, it has advantages of self-calibration, global coverage, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution[1, 2]. Based on the Abel integral transform inversion method of geometricaloptical approximation, the atmospheric refraction index can be inferred from the bending angle. The profiles of a series of ionospheric parameters can be obtained on a global scale such as electron density, total electron density content, and ionospheric scintillation index. GNSS RO products have shown significant research value and wide application prospects in many fields, such as ionospheric climatology study[3], space weather monitoring[4-7], ionospheric data assimilation model[8-10], atmospheric ionospheric coupling studies[11-14], etc.\nIn 1995, the United States launched the GPS/MET (Global Positioning System/Meteorology) project with a GPS receiver on its low-orbiting minisatellite. This project demonstrated the feasibility of the GNSS RO technology for detecting the atmosphere and ionosphere theoretically and technically for the first time and promoted the development and implementation of other RO projects[15, 16]. Subsequently, Germany launched the CHAMP (Challenging Mini-satellite Payload) satellite for occultation sounding in 2001[2, 17]. In 2002, The United States and Germany jointly launched the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) mission, which aims to enable simultaneous atmospheric and ionospheric occultation detection with CHAMP[18, 19]. In 2006, the United States and Taiwan implemented COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate). It is a RO constellation composed of six LEO satellites, and each satellite is equipped with a GPS occultation receiver[20]. The success of these projects has contributed to the continuous improvement of the ionospheric radio occultation detection system.

Based on the high scientific significance and research value of the COSMIC-1 occultation constellation, COSMIC-2 was successfully implemented in 2019[24].\nChina launched C (FY3C), D (FY3D), and E (FY3E) satellites of the Fengyun-3 (FY3) series in 2013, 2017, and 2021, respectively. In the next 10 years, three follow-up satellites (F, G, R) of the Fengyun-3 series will be deployed to establish a continuous observation network of at least four satellites, as shown in Fig.1[25]. FY3C is a sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellite launched in September 2013. Its orbital altitude and inclination are 836 km and 98.8\u00b0, respectively.\nCompared with other international radio occultation projects that can only receive GPS signals, FY3C carries the first occultation receiver capable of receiving both GPS and BDS (BeiDou Navigation System) signals. The payload, named GNOS (GNSS Occultation Sounder), was developed by the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NSSC, CAS). It receives about 700 radio occultation events per day on average (200 BDS + 500 GPS)[26]. It has now been in orbit for more than eight years, exceeding its scheduled five-year working life and is in extra-long service. The FY3D satellite was launched in November 2017, with orbital parameters similar to those of the FY3C. Its GNOS payload has been improved based on the FY3C in the antenna field of view and the number of occultation observation channels, and it can now receive about 250 BDS and about 600 GPS occultation events on average per day[27]. In addition, FY3C can only realize ionospheric scintillation observation of GPS signals, while FY3D adds the ionospheric scintillation monitoring of BDS so that it can detect ionospheric scintillation of BDS and GPS simultaneously[28]. Launched on July 5, 2021, the FY3E satellite is in a polar orbit with a local descent node time of about 6:00 p.m. The GNOS-II payload on FY3E adds observational support to the Galileo system. Moreover, GNOS-II can provide global ocean wind speed distribution based on the GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique, in addition to atmospheric and ionospheric observations[29].\nFig.2. shows the global distribution of GPS/BDS electron density profiles observed by FY3C and FY3D. The red dot and blue dot represent the BDS occultation event and GPS occultation event, respectively. The above products can be obtained through NSMC (National Satellite Meteorological Centre). As of March 5, 2022, the website provides L1-level\nand L2-level ionospheric products from June 1, 2014, to the present.\nFig. 2. The distribution of GPS/BDS ionospheric radio occultation events detected by FY3C/D from January 1, 2019, to January 12, 2019.\nThis paper focuses on the accuracy assessment and application progress of ionospheric data products observed by FY3/GNOS RO technique. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the accuracy assessment of the FY3 ionospheric RO products. Section 3 summarizes the application progress in FY3 RO products; Section 4 concludes this paper and gives an outlook."

The corresponding assessment of ionosonde and COSMIC has been carried out to verify the precision of its GPS/BDS EDP products.\nYang et al. statistically compared and analyzed FY3C/GNOS GPS EDP from October 1, 2013, to September 30, 2014, with ionosondes in the corresponding period[30]. After quality control and spatial-temporal matching, 745 pairs of NmF2 data matching pairs between the GPS RO and the ionosondes were obtained. As shown in Fig.3, the comparison results indicate that the correlation coefficient, bias, and std (standard deviation) of NmF2 differences between FY3C/GNOS and the ionosonde are 0.96, 6.71%, and 18.03%, respectively. Meanwhile, the statistical results in Fig. 4 show that the correlation coefficient, bias, and std of the height of the NmF2 (hmF2) between FY3C/GNOS and the ionosonde are 0.85, 4.68 km, and 25.96 km, respectively.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Since GNOS is also compatible with BDS GNSS signals, the assessment of BDS EDP is conducted as follows. Yang et al. compared the BDS NmF2 from October 1, 2013, to October 10, 2015, with that of the ionosonde data[31]. The correlation coefficient, bias, and std of NmF2 between BDS and the ionosondes are 0.96, 10.21%, and 19.61%, respectively. The statistics results are presented in Fig.5.\nThe statistical comparison of the EDP data between FY3C/GNOS and ionosondes has shown their accuracy consistency. The EDP data of FY3C/GNOS and the spacebased COSMIC was exploited to explore the deviation between them. Bai et al. matched the NmF2/hmF2 of FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC from February 4, 2016, to February 4, 2017[32]. The results indicate that the correlation coefficient of NmF2 between FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC is 0.95, the std of NmF2 between them is 17.48%, and the two parameters of hmF2 are 0.91 and 18.01 km, respectively. The above results further confirm that the FY3C/GNOS RO product is comparable to other international RO products in terms of accuracy."

            "text": "Ionospheric scintillation refers to the phenomenon of random fluctuations in the amplitude/phase of the signal crossing the ionosphere[33, 34]. This phenomenon causes signal loss and cycle slips and makes it difficult for the receiver to lock onto the carrier phase, affecting the GNSS-based applications[35]. Therefore, monitoring and warning of ionospheric scintillation is important to ensuring the stable operation of communication, navigation, and positioning systems.\nBai et al. evaluated the detection accuracy of GPS ionospheric scintillation observed by FY3C/GNOS with COSMIC[36]. First, the F-layer worst-case scintillation index ( 4\n) was extracted, and then the spatial-temporal matching 4\nbetween FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC during the geomagnetic quiet period, i.e., from Jan 1, 2014, to Jan 09, 2015, was statistically analyzed. Fig. 7 shows the statistics of the deviations of 4\npairs for all day, nighttime, and daytime. The results indicate that during the whole day, the bias and std of 4\ndifferences are 0.004 and 0.063, respectively. And the std at nighttime is larger than that at daytime. This may be due to irregularities in the electron density that vary over time after midnight and the disparity in the spatial-temporal matching criteria. The results prove that the GPS ionospheric scintillation detected by FY3C/GNOS has high precision, which provides support for constructing the BDS scintillation detection system on the FY3D satellite.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Modified from [36]. The FY3C/GNOS can only support the acquisition of the GPS scintillation, while the FY3D satellite launched in 2017 adds support for BDS scintillation detection and thus enables simultaneous observation of GPS and BDS ionospheric scintillations. Therefore, we conduct a statistical comparison of 4\nbetween FY3D-BDS and FY3D-GPS/COSMIC-GPS to obtain the detection accuracy of ionospheric scintillation of FY3D-BDS. In Fig. 8, the upper graph shows the statistical distribution of 4\ndeviation between FY3D-GPS and FY3D-BDS, and the lower graph shows that between COSMIC and FY3D-BDS. The results indicate that the std of 4 differences between FY3D-GPS/COSMIC-GPS and FY3DBDS are lower than 0.1, which proves the high-precision of BDS scintillation observed by FY3D-GNOS. Similar to FY3C/GNOS, the 4\ndeviation between FY3DGPS/COSMIC-GPS and FY3D-BDS at daytime is lower than that at nighttime."

The St. Patrick's Day super geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 17, 2015, was the strongest magnetic storm of the 24th solar cycle, and its impact on ionospheric morphology was studied based on the ionosonde or other observation methods[37-41].\nBai et al. presented the variation process of different phases of this magnetic storm with the NmF2 data of FY3C/GNOS in\nFig. 9[42]. It can be seen in Fig. 9(a) that in the pre-storm period, the high values of NmF2 during the daytime are mainly concentrated in the magnetic equatorial region, and the NmF2 is relatively low in the high magnetic latitudes. In the main phase of the storm, there are significant NmF2 disturbances in some areas, such as the South Atlantic area and the South Pacific area, but all return to the pre-storm level during the recovery phase by 22 March. At nighttime in Fig. 9(b), the NmF2 shows a suppressed trend in East Asia in the main phase. Also, during the magnetic storm, the mean NmF2 observed by FY3C/GNOS exhibits a nearly consistent trend with that of the ionosonde in two zones in Fig. 10, and the NmF2 error bars are shown in Fig. 11. The NmF2 of FY3C/GNOS and ionosonde decreases during the magnetic storm and increases in the recovery phase, i.e., the negative magnetic storm characteristics, which shows the decent response capability of FY3C/GNOS NmF2 to global magnetic storm events.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Fig. 12 shows the nighttime ionospheric scintillation distribution ( 4 \u22650.3) and the trajectory of the\nFY3C satellite during the main and recovery phases of the storm on March 17 and 18. Fig. 13 shows the nighttime variation of the spatial distribution of scintillation index observed by FY3C/GNOS before and after the magnetic storm. During the main phase, both the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the northern Indian Ocean exhibit significant scintillation, but the scintillation in East Asia and Africa is suppressed. In the late recovery phase (March 20-23), the scintillations in the Indian region, Africa, and the American recover to pre-storm levels, but the scintillations in Eastern Asia are still not active enough. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that the ionospheric electron density irregularities observed by C/NOFS (Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System) occur mainly in the longitude interval of 50\u00b0-100\u00b0E and 140\u00b0-\n220\u00b0E before midnight, which is highly consistent with the\noccurrence interval of the ionospheric scintillation observed by FY3C/GNOS, as shown in Fig. 12.

The IRI (International\nReference Ionosphere) model absorbs a variety of space-based and ground-based global ionospheric data, and it has been recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the standard ionospheric model[44, 45]. FY3/GNOS ionospheric RO data can be used as a thirdparty data source for comparative analysis of the IRI-2016 model in terms of data accuracy and climatological characteristics.\nBai et al. compared URSI NmF2, BSE hmF2, and newly added AMTB hmF2 and SHU hmF2 generated by the IRI-2016 model with ionospheric RO (IRO) data including FY3C/GNOS and COSMIC from 2017 to 2019 in statistics and ionospheric climatology[46]. The comparison results indicate that the NmF2 predicted by IRI-2016 URSI is almost consistent with that of IRO, with a systematic bias of less than 10%. Compared to the BSE/AMTB option, the SHU option estimates hmF2 more closely to IRO data.\nThe study also divided NmF2 and hmF2 into 3\u00b0\u00d76\u00b0 grids in four seasons to evaluate seasonal variations of IRI-2016 ionospheric climatological features. For example, in the NmF2 climatological comparison, Fig. 17 shows the seasonal average of NmF2 of IRI-2016 and IRO at daytime and nighttime in DS month (\u00b145 days of the December Solstice). It can be seen that in the summer hemisphere at nighttime, the NmF2 of IRO and IRI-2016 exhibit southern MSNA (Mid-latitude Summer Nighttime Anomaly) features. In hmF2 climatological comparison, Fig. 18 shows the seasonal average of hmF2 of IRO and IRI-2016 (BSE, AMTB, SHU) in JS month (\u00b145 days of the June Solstice), and the hemispheric asymmetry of hmF2 at daytime and nighttime can be observed. The comparison results of climatological features show that IRI-2016 URSI\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The globally distributed IRO observations may provide a scientific reference for IRI-2016 prediction in the ocean region. Besides, the BSE/AMTB/SHU hmF2 of IRI-2016 exhibits typical hemispheric asymmetry like IRO hmF2. The SHU option proves the validity of its data fusion because it is also consistent with the IRO data in minor hmF2 features such as day-night reversal."

Since the GNSS radio occultation technique can achieve global detection, the study of the Es layer is not limited to the area where the ground-based observatory is located, and a more comprehensive understanding of the variability of the Es layer can be obtained.\nYang et al. utilized the GPS RO data detected by FY3C/GNOS from June 2014 to May 2015, to statistically analyze the SNR disturbance at a sampling frequency of 50 Hz and then studied the morphology of the Es-layer[49]. The\nperturbations of the Es-layer in the mid-latitudes in the summer hemisphere are higher than those in the winter hemisphere, and the perturbation is significantly stronger near the latitude of 40\u00b0.\nAs shown in Fig. 19, near the height of 100 km, Es perturbation reaches its peak at 10:00 LT and 22:00 LT. The occurrence rate of Es-layer in the summer hemisphere is higher than that in the winter hemisphere, as shown in Fig. 20.

Unlike volcanoes on land, shock waves from submarine eruptions are more unique and rare. The ionospheric TEC perturbation generated by the Tonga eruption has been studied based on ground-based observational data[50-53], and this work investigates the ionospheric perturbation with space-based NmF2 data observed by FY3D/GNOS. Fig. 21 shows the distribution of daytime NmF2(1200-1600LT) within a 30o area around the epicenter before and after the eruption of Tonga volcano, and the average NmF2 near the epicenter is indicated in the upper right corner of each graph. As shown in Fig. 22, under the influence of\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This work demonstrates the effective response of space-based RO data to natural hazards like volcanic eruptions (earthquakes), and thus expands the effective application of FY3 RO data."

            "text": "The FY3/GNOS realized the world's first GPS and BDS compatible ionospheric RO observation, which provide a foundation for the development of further multi-GNSS RO missions such as subsequent FY3 series. This work firstly presents a review of the accuracy assessment for the EDP and scintillation products of FY3C/FY3D, where these products achieve a precision comparable to other similar products. Then the review of a series of scientific application studies of FY3C/FY3D ionospheric products are presented, including\nmagnetic storm studies, ionospheric model evaluation, Es-layer research, etc. The above studies can provide scientific references for the data validity and offer effective support for improving the quality of the subsequent RO data. Furthermore, they can provide a guidance to improve future occultation sounding payloads, thus contributing to the commercial application of the GNOS ionospheric RO products. However, the scientific research and application value of ionospheric occultation products of FY3 series still need to be further explored.\nThe FY3E satellite launched in 2021 will be grouped with the FY3C and FY3D in a three-satellite network with an orbital layout of dawn, dusk, morning, and afternoon, forming the coverage of an all-day observation period. With the continued deployment of subsequent satellites in the Fengyun-3 series and the continuous improvement of GNOS payload, a large number of high-precision ionospheric RO products will be available, offering data support for international ionospheric research, such as space weather monitoring, the mechanism of Es layer formation, ionospheric thickness study, ionospheric climatological research, etc. Besides, with the official opening of the BDS-3 system, the coverage and spatial-temporal resolution of ionospheric RO events will be significantly improved. The fusion of RO data between different GNOS payloads will be beneficial to real-time space weather monitoring and the construction of ionospheric climate models."
