            "text": "Suppose that the superconducting material is homogeneous, isotropic and occupies a region \u2126 \u2282 R3. Within \u2126 there is a magnetic field B\u2212, and a current J\u2212, which satisfy the London equations given by:\n\u2207\u00d7B\u2212 = J\u2212 , and \u2207\u00d7 J\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bb2L B\u2212 . (1.1)\nThe constant \u03bbL is called the London penetration depth. For physical materials it lies in the 10 \u2212 200 nanometer range. A solution to these equations can be expressed, within \u2126, via the Stratton-Chu formula, as an integral over the boundary of \u2126 (denoted by \u0393) using the Green\u2019s function\ng i \u039bL\n(x,y) = e \u2212 |x\u2212y| \u03bbL\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| . (1.2)\nFrom this formula it follows that the solution falls off like e\u2212 dist(x,\u0393) \u03bbL , which, for physically reasonable values of \u03bbL, means that the solutions are almost zero outside of a very thin neighborhood of \u0393.\nSince \u2207 \u00b7 \u2207 \u00d7 V = 0 for any vector field V , (1.1) implies that\n\u2207 \u00b7B\u2212 = \u2207 \u00b7 J\u2212 = 0 . (1.3)\nIn the complementary region there is a static magnetic field Btot, which satisfies the usual magneto-static equations\n\u2207\u00d7Btot = 0 and \u2207 \u00b7Btot = 0 in \u2126c. (1.4)\nWhile J\u2212 is supported in a thin neighborhood of \u0393, there is no current sheet on the boundary of \u2126, and so the physically reasonable boundary conditions are that\nB\u2212 = Btot on \u0393 , (1.5)\ni.e., the magnetic field is continuous across the boundary. This boundary condition and \u2207\u00d7Btot = 0 imply that B\u2212 is a closed vector field on the manifold \u0393 and thus satisfies\n\u2207\u0393 \u00b7 ( n\u00d7B\u2212 ) = 0 on \u0393 . (1.6)\nHere \u2207\u0393\u00b7 denotes the surface divergence operator on the boundary \u0393 and n is the outward pointing unit normal (pointing into \u2126c) to \u0393. The London equation shows that J\u2212 \u00b7 n = 0 is equivalent to \u2207\u0393 \u00b7n\u00d7B\u2212 = 0. This theory, at least in the static case, seems to be widely\naccepted, see [2], though it is restricted to circumstances where the induced fields in the superconductor remain below the critical level.\nIn the standard \u201cscattering\u201d problem for this set-up there is an incoming magneto-static field Bin, so that, in \u2126c, Btot = Bin + B+, where B+ is an outgoing field satisfying the radiation condition \u2223\u2223\u2223B+(x)\u2223\u2223\u2223 = o(|x|\u22121). (1.7) The boundary conditions in (1.4) are then given by\nB\u2212 = (B+ +Bin) on \u0393. (1.8)\nIf the domain \u2126 is non-contractible, then this problem does not have a unique solution. If \u0393 has genus g, then there are g A-cycles {A1, . . . , Ag}, which bound surfaces {SA1 , . . . , SAg} contained within \u2126, and g B-cycles {B1, . . . , Bg}, which bound surfaces {SB1 , . . . , SBg} contained in \u2126c, see Fig. 1 for the genus 1 case.\nSince \u2212n \u00d7 n \u00d7 B is a closed vector field on \u0393, its integrals over cycles on \u0393 depend only on the homology class of the cycle. It follows from the boundary condition, and Stokes theorem that\u222b\nBj B\u2212 \u00b7 d` = \u222b Bj (B+ +Bin) \u00b7 d` = \u222b SBj \u2207\u00d7 (B+ +Bin) \u00b7 n dS = 0. (1.9)\nOn the other hand the fluxes aj = \u222b Aj B\u2212 \u00b7 d` = \u222b SAj \u2207\u00d7B\u2212 \u00b7 n dS = \u222b SAj J\u2212 \u00b7 n dS, for j = 1, . . . , g, (1.10)\nare not determined a priori, and in fact, constitute additional data that must be specified to get a uniqueness theorem."

            "text": "Before proceeding to the uniqueness theorem we consider a minimal parametrization for solutions to this system of equations. The bounded domain \u2126 always has a trivial 2-\ndimensional cohomology group, and therefore B\u2212 = \u2207\u00d7A\u2212, with A\u2212 a solution of\n\u2212\u2206A\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bb2L A\u2212. (2.1)\nWe then define J\u2212 = \u2207(\u2207 \u00b7 A\u2212) \u2212 1 \u03bb2L A\u2212. With these choices, B\u2212 and J\u2212 satisfy the equations (1.1) and (1.3) . The set of vector fields satisfying (2.1) depend on 3 functions defined on \u0393, for example \u2212n \u00d7 (n \u00d7A\u2212) and \u2212\u2207 \u00b7A\u2212. Using the gauge freedom A\u2212 \u2192 A\u2212 +\u2207\u03c6\u2212, where \u03bb2L\u2206\u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212 = 0, we can reduce this to two functions on the boundary.\nThere are g outgoing harmonic vector fields defined in \u2126c, denoted by {BH1 , . . . ,BHg }, which satisfy \u2207\u00d7BHj = \u2207 \u00b7BHj = 0 for x \u2208 \u2126c, and BHj \u00b7 n = 0, for x \u2208 \u0393, j = 1, 2, . . . g. An arbitrary vector field B+, satisfying \u2207\u00d7B+ = \u2207 \u00b7B+ = 0 has a unique representation as\nB+ = \u2207f+ + g\u2211 j=1 hjB H j , (2.2)\nwhere \u2206f+ = 0. Thus outgoing solutions to magneto-static problems depend on 1-function of mean 0 on \u0393 (\u2202nf+), and the g real numbers {h1, . . . , hg}.\nWe now state and prove a uniqueness theorem for this problem.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that (B\u2212,J\u2212), and B+ satisfy (1.1) and (1.4) respectively and the homogeneous boundary conditions\nB\u2212 = B+ on \u0393 , (2.3)\nalong with the conditions \u222b Aj B\u2212 \u00b7 d` = 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , g. (2.4)\nIf, in addition, B+ is an outgoing solution, then (B\u2212,J\u2212) \u2261 (0, 0) in \u2126 and B+ \u2261 0, in \u2126c.\nProof. We use integration parts. Using equation (1.1) and Stokes theorem we see that\u222b \u2126 [ 1 \u03bb2L |B\u2212|2 + |J\u2212|2 ] dV = \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7B\u2212 \u00b7 J\u2212dS. (2.5)\nThe hypotheses of the theorem imply that B+ has no projection onto the harmonic vector fields BHj , j = 1, 2, . . . g, and thus there exists a harmonic function f defined in \u2126c such that B+ = \u2207f. Therefore, as B+ is outgoing,\u222b\n\u2126c |B+|2dV = \u222b \u2126c |\u2207f |2dV = \u2212 \u222b \u0393 fB+ \u00b7 ndS , (2.6)\nNote the extra negative sign since the normal is pointing into \u2126c. Because B\u2212 = B+ on the boundary, we see that\u222b\n\u0393 n\u00d7B\u2212 \u00b7 J\u2212 = \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7\u2207f \u00b7 J\u2212dS\n= \u222b\n\u0393 [\u2212f\u2207\u00d7 J\u2212 \u00b7 n+\u2207\u00d7 (fJ\u2212) \u00b7 n]\n= 1 \u03bb2L \u222b \u0393 fB+ \u00b7 n.\n(2.7)\nCombining these various computations we see that\u222b \u2126 [ 1 \u03bb2L |B\u2212|2 + |J\u2212|2 ] dV + 1 \u03bb2L \u222b \u2126c |B+|2dV = 0, (2.8)\nfrom which the conclusion is immediate.\nThe theorem shows thatBin(x) for x on \u0393 along with the g real parameters {a1, . . . , ag}, uniquely determine a solution to the \u201cscattering\u201d problem for a superconductor. Note that this theorem leaves open the possibility that there is g-parameter family of purely outgoing solutions. In the next section we will see that such solutions do in fact exist. In the physically important toroidal case, this theorem implies that the static current distribution in a superconducting torus is determined by its flux across SA.\nThis uniqueness result, in the simply connected case, appears in [2]."

In order for these fields to satisfy the relevant PDEs it is necessary that\n\u2207 \u00b7A\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bbL \u03c6\u2212, \u2207 \u00b7 \u03b8\u2212 = 1 \u03bbL \u03a8\u2212 , (4.3)\nand \u2207 \u00b7A+ = \u2206\u03a8+ = 0. These latter conditions are automatic for\n\u03a8+ = S0[q+] and A+ = S0[l+H ] , (4.4)\nwhere S0 is the single layer potential defined in Section 3, and l+H is a harmonic vector field on \u0393.\nLet k = i/\u03bbL. For the interior fields we set\nA\u2212 = Sk[l\u2212] , \u03b8\u2212 = Sk[m\u2212] , \u03c6\u2212 = Sk[r\u2212] , and , \u03a8\u2212 = Sk[q\u2212] , (4.5)\nwhere l\u2212 and m\u2212 are vector fields, which are tangent to \u0393. For the equations in (4.3) to hold it is only necessary that\n\u2207\u0393 \u00b7 l\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bbL r\u2212 and \u2207\u0393 \u00b7m\u2212 = 1 \u03bbL q\u2212 , (4.6)\nwhere\u2207\u0393\u00b7 is the surface divergence operator. These relations force q\u2212 and r\u2212 to be functions of mean zero on \u0393. As we show below, this is not generally true of q+. With this in mind we set\nm\u2212 = 1 \u03bbL \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 q \u2212 ,\nl\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bbL\n[ \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 r \u2212 + l\u2212H ] .\n(4.7)\nHere \u2207\u0393 is the surface gradient operator, which is the adjoint of the surface divergence operator on the space of L2 functions with respect to the induced metric on the surface; \u2206\u0393 is the Laplace Beltrami operator on \u0393; and l\u2212H is a harmonic vector field on \u0393. The inverse of \u2206\u0393 should be interpreted as inverse on functions of mean zero. This is essentially what is done in [3], and therefore we can follow the computations there to work out the form of the boundary integral equations.\nUsing the jump relations and identities for layer potentials discussed in Section 3, the limiting values of B\u0303\u2212, B+ and J\u2212 for x \u2208 \u0393 are given by\nB\u0303 \u2212 = q\n\u2212n+ n\u00d7 l\u2212\n2 \u2212 1 \u03bbL Sk[m\u2212] + p.v.\n( \u2207Sk[q\u2212] +\u2207\u00d7 Sk[l\u2212] ) ,\nB+ = \u2212q +n+ n\u00d7 l+H 2 + p.v.

(4.13)\nIn terms of the Debye sources we see that\u222b \u0393 \u03bbLB\u0303 \u2212 \u00b7 n dS = \u222b \u0393 ( \u2212\u03b8\u2212 + \u03bbL\u2207\u03a8\u2212 + \u03bbL\u2207\u00d7A\u2212 ) \u00b7 n dS\n= \u222b\n\u2126\n( \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b8\u2212 + \u03bbL\u2206\u03a8\u2212 ) dV = 0 , and\u222b\n\u0393 \u2212B+ \u00b7 n dS = \u2212 \u222b \u0393 ( \u2207\u00d7A+ +\u2207\u03a8+ ) \u00b7 n dS = \u222b \u0393 q+ dS .\n(4.14)\nThe last equality follows by using the jump relation for the integral defining \u2207\u03a8+, and the fact that it is a closed vector field in \u0393c. Thus, we see that\u222b\n\u0393 q+dS = \u222b \u0393 Bin \u00b7 n dS . (4.15)\nTo obtain the final equation we use instead the condition that J\u2212 \u00b7n = 0. Since \u03bbL\u2207\u00d7 B\u0303 \u2212 = J\u2212, this will imply that \u2207\u0393 \u00b7n\u00d7 B\u0303\n\u2212 = J\u2212 \u00b7n/\u03bbL = 0. In the Debye representation the condition J\u2212 \u00b7 n = 0 takes the form:\n\u2212 r \u2212\n2 \u2212 S \u2032 k[r\u2212]\u2212 n \u00b7\n( Sk[m\u2212] +\u2207\u00d7 Sk[l\u2212] ) = 0 , (4.16)\nIt is clear that equations (4.10), (4.12), and (4.16) are a Fredholm system of second kind for (q\u2212, q+, r\u2212). These together with the PDEs will enforce the conditions that the normal components of total B-fields are continuous across \u0393, as are the topologically trivial components of the Hodge decomposition of the tangential components. This still leaves the harmonic components, which are in turn related to the two harmonic vector fields (l+H , l \u2212 H).\nThe harmonic vector field l\u2212H is, a priori, arbitrary, belonging to a 2g-dimensional space. We first need to impose the conditions\u222b\nBj\nB\u0303 \u2212 \u00b7 d` = 0 for j = 1, . . . , g, (4.17)\nsince B is continuous across the boundary and B+ satisfies \u2207\u00d7B+ = 0 in \u2126c. The harmonic vector field l+H is selected from a g\u2212dimensional subspace V+ \u2282 ker\u2207\u0393\u00b7, complementary to common null-space of the linear functionals defined by the flux of the associated vector fields \u2207\u00d7A+ over the A-cycles. Thus if l+H \u2208 V+ and\u222b\nBj\n( \u2207\u00d7A+ ) \u00b7 d` = 0 for = 1, . . . , g, then l+H = 0. (4.18)\nHere \u2207\u00d7A+ for x on \u0393 is defined as the limit from \u2126c. These integrals are all zero if the limit is taken in (4.4) is taken from \u2126; hence, using the jump relations for \u2207\u00d7A+, we see that \u222b\nAj \u2207\u00d7A+ \u00b7 d` = \u2212 \u222b Aj n\u00d7 l+H \u00b7 d` . (4.19)\nHence for V+ we can take the g\u2212dimensional subspace of l+H \u2208 H1(\u0393) such that integrals of n\u00d7 l+H \u00b7 d` over the B\u2212cycles vanish.\nWith this understood, we augment the Fredholm system above with the following 4g conditions \u222b\nAj\n\u03bbLB\u0303 \u2212 \u00b7 d` = \u222b Aj\n[B+ +Bin] \u00b7 d` = aj ,\u222b Bj B\u0303 \u2212 \u00b7 d` = \u222b Bj n\u00d7 l+H \u00b7 d` = 0 , (4.20)\nfor j = 1, 2, . . . g. These additional conditions ensure that the topologically non-trivial parts of the Hodge decompositions of \u2212n\u00d7 n\u00d7 [B+ +Bin] and \u2212n\u00d7 n\u00d7 \u03bbLB\u0303\n\u2212 agree. Taken together, these equations imply the continuity of the B-fields across \u0393. Remark 2. There are other choices that can be made in the definition of the sources m\u2212, l\u2212, in terms of the scalar sources and harmonic vector fields. Indeed, we can let\nm\u2212 = 1 \u03bbL\n[ \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 q \u2212 + \u03c3mn\u00d7\u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 ( q+ \u2212 1\n|\u0393| \u222b \u0393 q+ ) +m\u2212H ]\nl\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bbL\n[ \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 r \u2212 + \u03c3`n\u00d7\u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 ( q+ \u2212 1\n|\u0393| \u222b \u0393 q+ ) + l\u2212H ] ,\n(4.21)\nwith \u03c3`, \u03c3m arbitrary constants. The harmonic vector fields m\u2212H and l \u2212 H need to satisfy the\ncondition \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7 l\u2212H \u00b7m \u2212 H dS = 0 . (4.22) This means that either we fix one of the sources to vanish and then the other is an arbitrary harmonic vector field, or we can select a Lagrangian subspace L which is a subset of the harmonic vector fields and both m\u2212H , l \u2212 H \u2208 L. A subspace, L, is Lagrangian if its dimension is half the dimension of space of harmonic vector fields and any pair l1, l2 \u2208 L satisfy\u222b \u0393 n\u00d7 l1 \u00b7 l2 dS = 0 . (4.23)\nIn Section 7.2, we briefly explore the effect that \u03c3m, \u03c3` have on the conditioning of the resultant system of integral equations."

            "text": "We have shown that the Debye source representation results in a system of Fredholm equations of second kind, but we still need to show that this representation has a trivial nullspace. That is we need to show that if we are given data (q\u2212, r\u2212, l\u2212H , q+, l + H) so that the equations (4.10)\u2013(4.20) are all satisfied with right hand sides equal to zero, then the data itself must be zero. In this context we will assume that the incoming data Bin satisfies\u222b\nAj\nBin \u00b7 d` = 0 for j = 1, . . . , g. (5.1)\nThis can always be arranged by adding an outgoing harmonic vector field to Bin. It follows from these assumptions that for x on \u0393, Bin = 0, therefore the fields B\u00b1 satisfy the homogeneous conditions\nB+ = B\u2212 on \u0393\u222b Aj B\u2212 \u00b7 d` = 0 for j = 1, . . . , g. (5.2)\nSince B+ is outgoing, we proved above that these conditions imply that (J\u2212,B\u2212) = (0, 0) in \u2126, and B+ = 0 in \u2126c.\nTo show that the Debye representation is injective, we first considerB+ = \u2207\u00d7A++\u2207\u03a8+ in \u2126c. The fact that this field vanishes shows that\u222b\nAj\n\u2207\u00d7A+ \u00b7 d` = 0, for j = 1, . . . , g. (5.3)\nRecall that A+ = \u222b \u0393 g0(x,y)l+H(y)dS, (5.4)\nwhere l+H \u2208 V+. The subspace V+ \u2282 H1(\u0393) is defined so that the conditions satisfied by \u2207\u00d7A+ imply that l+H \u2261 0, see (4.18). Thus we see that \u2207\u03a8+ = 0 for x \u2208 \u2126c, where\n\u03a8+(x) = \u222b\n\u0393 g0(x,y)q+(y)dS. (5.5)\nThus \u03a8+(x) is constant, for x \u2208 \u2126c, and tends to zero at infinity, it is therefore identically zero in \u2126c. The function \u03a8+(x) is also harmonic in \u2126 and continuous across \u0393, so therefore identically zero in \u2126 as well. The jump formula for \u2202n\u03a8+ across \u0393 shows that q+ \u2261 0. This leaves the sources (q\u2212, r\u2212, l\u2212H).\nThe fields (J\u2212,B\u2212) vanish in \u2126; we let (J\u22121 ,B \u2212 1 ) denote the fields in \u2126c defined by\nthese sources via (4.2) and (4.5).

(5.7)\nTo show that the sources are zero, we let \u2126cR = \u2126c \u2229 BR, and observe that the equations satisfied by (J\u22121 ,B\n\u2212 1 ) imply that\u222b\n\u2126cR \u2207 \u00b7 (J\u22121 \u00d7B \u2212 1 ) = \u2212 \u222b \u2126cR [ 1 \u03bb2L |B\u22121 | 2 + |J\u22121 |2 ] .

From the jump relations we see that \u2206\u22121\u0393 q\u2212 is constant, and therefore 0. Since the components of the Hodge decomposition are orthogonal this also implies that \u2206\u22121\u0393 r\u2212 = 0 and l \u2212 H = 0. Since \u2206\u0393 is injective on functions of mean zero we see that q\u2212 = r\u2212 = 0, which completes the proof that the Debye representation is injective."

By this we mean that the external field B+ is found by applying the Biot-Savart operator to J\u2212. To establish this we need some notation, and further uniqueness results.\nWe begin with a uniqueness theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let \u2126 \u2282 R3 be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Suppose that B \u2208 C0(R3), satisfies\n\u2207\u00d7B = 0, \u2207 \u00b7B = 0 in R3 \\ \u0393 (6.1)\nand B(x) = O(|x|\u22121), as x\u2192\u221e, then B \u2261 0.\nProof. The first observation is that B must actually be a smooth harmonic vector field in all of R3. A simple integration by parts argument shows that B is a distributional solution to \u2206B = 0, and so, by elliptic regularity it is a classical solution. Since \u2207\u00d7B = 0 in R3 it follows that\nf(x) = \u222b x\n0 B \u00b7 d` (6.2)\nis a well defined function that satisfies\n\u2207f = B, \u2206f = 0 and |f(x)| = O(| log |x||) as |x| \u2192 \u221e. (6.3)\nThe sharp form of Liouville\u2019s theorem implies that f is constant, which completes the proof of the theorem.\nAs a corollary we see that the solution to the following transmission problem, with given J\u2212 in \u2126 and Bin on \u0393 has a unique solution\n\u2207\u00d7B\u2212 = J\u2212, \u2207 \u00b7B\u2212 =0 in \u2126 , \u2207\u00d7B+ = 0, \u2207 \u00b7B+ =0 in [\u2126]c with |B+(x)| = O(|x|\u22121) , B\u2212 \u2212B+ = Bin on \u0393\n(6.4)\nis unique as well. The second order of business is the Biot-Savart formula.\nTheorem 3 (Biot-Savart Law). Suppose that J satisfies \u2207 \u00b7 J = 0 in \u2126 and J \u00b7 n = 0 on \u0393. Let\n\u03b8(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV , (6.5)\nthen except on \u0393, \u2207\u00d7 \u03b8 = J\nProof. For any x not in \u0393,\n\u2207\u00d7 \u03b8 = \u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = \u2207\u2207 \u00b7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212\u2206 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV\n= \u2207 \u222b\n\u2126\n( \u2207y \u00b7 ( J\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| ) \u2212 \u2207y \u00b7 J(y)4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| ) dV + J\n= J +\u2207 \u222b\n\u0393\nJ \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| \u2212 \u2207 \u222b \u2126 \u2207y \u00b7 J(y) 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = J .\n(6.6)\nThis establishes the Biot-Savart law, and makes explicit the hypotheses needed to make it hold.\nTo complete this circle of ideas we find the formula expressing a divergence free vector field B in a domain \u2126 in terms of \u2207\u00d7B and appropriate boundary data.\nTheorem 4. Let B be a divergence free vector field defined in the smoothly bounded domain \u2126. Suppose that \u2207\u00d7B = J , with \u2207\u00d7B \u00b7 n = \u2207\u0393 \u00b7 n\u00d7B = 0 on \u0393. In this case\nB = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV +Bt +Bn , (6.7)\nwhere Bt = \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS and Bn = \u2207 \u222b \u0393 B \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS (6.8)\nare harmonic vector fields in \u0393c.\nRemark 3. Recall that a vector field A is a harmonic vector field if it satisfies the equations\n\u2207\u00d7A = \u2207 \u00b7A = 0. (6.9)\nThis of course implies that \u2212\u2206A = (\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u2212\u2207\u2207\u00b7)A = 0, and on a closed compact manifold these conditions are equivalent, but, in a domain with boundary, the former is a stronger condition.\nWe let H2R(\u2126c) denote the vector space of outgoing harmonic vector fields in \u2126c that satisfy B \u00b7 n = 0 on \u0393. For these vector fields (6.7) implies that\nB(x) = \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS for x \u2208 \u2126 c . (6.10)\nIt is a consequence of Hodge theory that H2R(\u2126c) ' H2dR(\u2126c,\u0393), which is a vector space of dimension g, if \u0393 has genus g. An element of this vector space is completely determined by the periods \u222b\nAj\nB \u00b7 d` for j = 1, 2 . . . , g. (6.11)\nThis shows that H2R(\u2126c) is another g\u2212dimensional vector space that could be used for V+ in the definition of A+.\nProof. As before we begin with the formula \u2212\u2206 \u222b\n\u2126\nB 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = (\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u2212\u2207\u2207\u00b7) \u222b\n\u2126\nB\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = B(x) . (6.12)\nWe need to compute the curl and the divergence of the integral. We see that \u2207x \u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nB 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = \u222b\n\u2126\n\u2207y \u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u2207y \u00d7 ( B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| ) dV\n= \u222b\n\u2126\n\u2207y \u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212 \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS ,\n(6.13)\nand\n\u2207x \u00b7 \u222b\n\u2126\nB 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV = \u222b\n\u2126\n\u2207y \u00b7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u2207y \u00b7 ( B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| ) dV\n= \u222b\n\u2126\n\u2207y \u00b7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212 \u222b \u0393 B \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS .\n(6.14)\nThe result then follows by combining (6.12) to (6.14), and that B is divergence free in \u2126. All that is left to show is that Bt and Bn are harmonic vector fields in \u0393c. Trivially, \u2207 \u00b7Bt = 0, and \u2207\u00d7Bn = 0. Furthermore\n\u2207 \u00b7Bn = \u2206 \u222b\n\u0393\nB \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS = 0 , (6.15)\nsince 1/|x\u2212y| is a harmonic function for x \u2208 \u0393c. All that remains to show is that\u2207\u00d7Bt = 0. To this end, observe that\n\u2207\u00d7Bt = \u2212(\u2207\u2207 \u00b7 \u2212\u2206) \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS\n= \u2212\u2207\u2207 \u00b7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS ,\n(6.16)\nsince 1/|x\u2212 y| is a harmonic function. Thus, it suffices to show that\n\u2207 \u00b7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS = 0 . (6.17)\nTo this end observe that\n\u2207 \u00b7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS = \u222b \u0393 \u2207\u0393 \u00b7 n\u00d7B 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y| dS = 0 (6.18)\nObserve that the first term in (6.18) is precisely the Biot-Savart law, but note that the solution to \u2207 \u00d7 B = J , \u2207 \u00b7 B = 0 in \u2126 with J \u00b7 n = 0 on \u0393 is not generally given by the Biot-Savart formula alone, but may require the addition of a harmonic vector field determined by the boundary values of B.\nThis finally brings us to the main result of this section.\nTheorem 5. Suppose that B \u2208 C0(R3) solves (6.4). If Bin extends to \u2126 as a solution to \u2207\u00d7Bin = 0,\u2207 \u00b7Bin = 0, then, for x \u2208 \u2126c we have that\nB+(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\u2212(y) 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV (6.19)\nThat is, the outgoing field is generated by the currents within the superconductor.\nProof. The proof is based on Theorem 2, the foregoing computations, and the jump formul\u00e6 for the boundary integrals in (6.8), see [1]. Because B+ is outgoing, we observe that (6.7) can be applied to represent B+ for x \u2208 \u2126c :\nB+(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B+ 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS \u2212\u2207 \u222b\n\u0393\nB+ \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS . (6.20)\nHere the signs are reversed because we are representing a field in \u2126c, and we orient \u0393 as the boundary of \u2126. The formula in (6.20) also defines a harmonic field in \u2126. It follows from the jump relations for these integrals that this field has zero boundary data and is therefore zero in \u2126. We can similarly represent Bin(x) for x \u2208 \u2126 in this form:\nBin(x) = \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7Bin 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS +\u2207 \u222b\n\u0393\nBin \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS . (6.21)\nFinally we represent B\u2212 for x \u2208 \u2126 as\nB\u2212(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7B\u2212 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS +\u2207 \u222b\n\u0393\nB\u2212 \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS (6.22)\nUsing the boundary condition, B\u2212 = B+ +Bin along \u0393, and the fact, noted above, that the B+-contribution will be zero for x \u2208 \u2126, gives\nB\u2212(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u0393\nn\u00d7Bin 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS +\u2207 \u222b\n\u0393\nBin \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS . (6.23)\nIf we define B\u0303 +(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\u2212\n4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV for x \u2208 \u2126 c, (6.24)\nthen B\u0303+ is harmonic and outgoing in \u2126c. The fact that the Biot-Savart term is continuous across \u0393 along with equations (6.21) and (6.23) imply that, for x0 \u2208 \u0393, we have:\nlim x\u2192x\u22120 B\u2212(x)\u2212 lim x\u2192x+0\nB\u0303 +(x)\n= lim x\u2192x\u22120\n[ \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u222b \u0393 n\u00d7Bin 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS +\u2207 \u222b \u0393 Bin \u00b7 n 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dS ] = Bin(x0).\n(6.25)\nThe conclusion of the theorem now follows from the corollary of Theorem 2.\nAs a corollary of the proof we see that if Bin \u2261 0, then we have the representation formula\nB(x) = \u2207\u00d7 \u222b\n\u2126\nJ\u2212(y) 4\u03c0|x\u2212 y|dV (6.26)\nholding globally throughout R3. This fact can also be deduced directly from Theorem 2, since the field defined in (6.26) is easily seen to be a solution to (6.4) with Bin = 0."

The reduction in order of convergence for the stellarator is in part explained by the loss of an order of convergence in computing the harmonic vector fields as noted in [6, 7].\nIn Table 2, we tabulate the errors \u03b51, \u03b52, and niter on the stellarator for \u03bbL = 1, 10\u22121, and 10\u22121/3. As we show in a subsequent paper, see [4], the second kind Fredholm system approaches a mixed first kind-second kind Fredholm system of equations as \u03bbL \u2192 0. Thus, the increase in number of GMRES iterations required for the solution to converge to the same residual is expected. The loss of accuracy for \u03b52 as \u03bbL is increased can be in part attributed to the quadrature error owing to the more singular nature of the kernels of the layer potentials. However, with a sufficiently fine mesh, for a fixed \u03bbL, we observe the expected convergence behavior of O(h8 + \u03b5)."

In this section, we study how the condition number of the resultant Fredholm system is impacted by the choice of these parameters. On the unit sphere, one can analytically compute the action of the system of integral equations on the spherical harmonics. Moreover, owing to symmetry of the problem defined on the sphere, the action of the integral operator only depends on degree of the spherical harmonic and is independent of the order. Detailed analyses for the spectra of various layer potentials on the sphere are discussed in [9] for example.\nWe wish to explore the effect of \u03c3m, \u03c3` on the conditioning of the system where\nm\u2212 = 1 \u03bbL\n[ \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 q \u2212 + \u03c3mn\u00d7\u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 ( q+ \u2212 1\n|\u0393| \u222b \u0393 q+ )]\nl\u2212 = \u2212 1 \u03bbL\n[ \u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 r \u2212 + \u03c3`n\u00d7\u2207\u0393\u2206\u22121\u0393 ( q+ \u2212 1\n|\u0393| \u222b \u0393 q+ )] ,\n(7.9)\nSuppose that the linear system is written as map from map from [\u03c1\u2212, \u03c1+, \u00b5\u2212, q\u2212, q+, r\u2212] to\nthe boundary conditions ordered in the following manner on the sphere\n(\u2206\u2202\u2126 +W)S20 [\u03c1\u2212]\u2212 q\u2212 = 0 (\u2206\u2202\u2126 +W)S20 [\u03c1+]\u2212 q+ = 0 (\u2206\u2202\u2126 +W)S20 [\u00b5\u2212]\u2212 r\u2212 = 0\n\u2212S0 [ \u2207\u0393 \u00b7 n\u00d7 n\u00d7 ( \u03bbLB\u0303 \u2212 \u2212B+ )] = \u2212S0[\u2207\u0393 \u00b7 n\u00d7 n\u00d7Bin](\n\u03bbLB\u0303 \u2212 \u2212B+ ) \u00b7 n = Bin \u00b7 n\nJ\u2212 \u00b7 n = J in \u00b7 n ,\n(7.10)\nSuppose that Ynm(\u03b8, \u03c6) is the spherical harmonic of degree n and orderm.

(7.14)\nIn practice, to improve the conditioning of system of Fredholm equations, typically the system is preconditioned with D\u22121 which is done for the following as well. Let sj,n, j = 1, 2, . . . 6 denote the singular values of D\u22121An. Let\nsmax = max j=1,2,...6 n\u22650 sj,n , and min j=1,2,...6 n\u22650 sj,n (7.15)\nThe condition number of the system of equations denoted by \u03ba is then given by \u03ba = smax/smin. In Fig. 3, we plot \u03ba as a function of \u03c3m and \u03c3` for \u03bbL = 1, 10\u22121, 10\u22122. As we can see from the figures, for all values of \u03bbL, the system seems to be optimally conditioned when \u03c3m = \u03c3` = 0.\nRemark 4. Since the system of equations is a second kind Fredholm equation, one can show that D\u22121An \u2192 I as n \u2192 \u221e. Thus in practice, one can truncate the computation of smax and smin to n \u2264 nmax(\u03bbL)."

In Fig. 4, we plot the surface current J\u2212 on the stellarator with \u03bbL = 1, 10\u22121, and 10\u22121/3. For \u03bbL = 1, 10\u22121, we discretize the stellarator withNpatches = 600 8th order patches, and for \u03bbL = 10\u22121/3, we discretize the stellarator with Npatches = 2400 8th order patches. In Fig. 5, we plot the current J\u2212 \u00b7 n inside the cross section of the stellarator on the XZ plane at y = 0. Here n = (0, 1, 0). The current decays in the interior as O(e\u2212d(x,\u2202\u2126)/\u03bbL) as expected.\nIn Fig. 6, we plot a static current, and the corresponding magnetic fields in the genus 2 torus with \u03bbL = 1. Both the current fluxes aj , j = 1, 2, were set to 1. The torus is contained in a bounding box of size 4\u00d74\u00d74. A high order representation of the geometry was obtained by using the surface smoothing algorithm of [10] on a second order triangulation of a genus 2 domain formed by merging two hollow rectangular parallelepipeds. The geometry was discretized with Npatches = 2496, 9th order triangles. The errors \u03b51, \u03b52 for the analytic solution test discussed in Section 7.1 are \u03b51 = 1.4\u00d7 10\u22125, and \u03b52 = 2.5\u00d7 10\u22124."

            "heading": "8 Conclusions",
            "text": "In this note we have studied the standard scattering problem for a static, low-field, type-I superconductor using the standard London equation formulation within the superconducting material. Amongst other things, we have shown that, for a superconductor of genus g > 0, the fluxes through the A-cycles can be specified arbitrarily and uniquely determine a current distribution and a corresponding external, outgoing magnetic field. Moreover this field can be obtained by applying the Biot-Savart formula to the current within the superconductor.\nWe have shown that, for any \u03bbL > 0, the Debye source formulation provides boundary integral equations, which are Fredholm equations of second-kind, that can be solved for an arbitrary incoming field and fluxes through the A-cycles. In numerical examples, we demonstrate the practical efficacy of this method, provided \u03bbL is not too small. In real applications \u03bbL is typically quite small, and the equations given in this paper will become very difficult to solve. In a second paper, see [4], we show that these equations have limits, in the strong operator sense, as \u03bbL \u2192 0+. The limiting system of equations is nearly decoupled and consists of Fredholm equations, some of first kind and some of second kind. These equations can easily be solved and will provide an effective means to accurately approximate the solutions to (1.1), (1.4), (1.5) in physically reasonable cases."
