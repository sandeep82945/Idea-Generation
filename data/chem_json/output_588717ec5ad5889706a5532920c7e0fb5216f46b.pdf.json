    "abstractText": "In this study, a graphitic carbon nitride and chitosan oligomers (g-C3N4\u2013COS) nanocarrier assembly, which was obtained by cross-linking with methacrylic anhydride (MA), was synthesized and characterized. Its characterization was carried out using infrared spectroscopy, elemental and thermal analyses, and transmission electron microscopy. The new nanocarriers (NCs), with an average particle size of 85 nm in diameter and a 0.25 dispersity index, showed photocatalytic activity (associated with the g-C3N4 moiety), susceptibility to enzymatic degradation (due to the presence of the COS moiety), and high encapsulation and moderate-high release efficiencies (>95% and >74%, respectively). As a proof of concept, the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of the NCs was tested for rhodamine B degradation and the reduction of uranium(VI) to uranium(IV). Regarding the potential of the nanocarriers for the encapsulation and delivery of bioactive products for crop protection, NCs loaded with Rubia tinctorum extracts were investigated in vitro against three Vitis vinifera phytopathogens (viz. Neofusicoccum parvum, Diplodia seriata, and Xylophilus ampelinus), obtaining minimum inhibitory concentration values of 750, 250, and 187.5 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. Their antifungal activity was further tested in vivo as a pruning wound protection product in young \u2018Tempranillo\u2019 grapevine plants that were artificially infected with the two aforementioned species of the family Botryosphaeriaceae, finding a significant reduction of the necrosis lengths in the inner woody tissues. Therefore, g-C3N4-MA-COS NCs may be put forward as a multifunctional platform for environmental and agrochemical delivery applications.",

            "text": "Engineered nanocarriers (NCs) have substantially contributed to the development of precision medicine [1], and, more recently, they are also finding applications in agriculture as a promising route to increase crop production while reducing the environmental impact associated with food production and crop protection [2]. For agricultural purposes, the main characteristic of any nanocarrier is to exhibit controlled release properties and site-specific delivery, i.e., the release of the active ingredient should respond to the stimuli produced by the pest and/or the surrounding environment [3]. Nonetheless, other features are also highly desirable: good physical and chemical properties, stability in different media, a high adsorption capacity, ease of modification to tune the surface characteristics such as charge and permeability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and competitive production costs [2].\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15248981 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981 2 of 18\nThe state-of-the-art of micro- and nanocarriers used for the encapsulation of agrochemicals have been covered in several recent review papers [3,4], which showed that naturally sourced polymers, such as chitosan (36%), alginate (23%), and plant-based proteins (16%); synthetic polymers (35%); and inorganic materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks and calcium carbonate) are the among the options that have been explored for the construction of NCs. Concerning the preferred option (viz. chitosan), the agronanochemicals for crop protection based on this natural polymer would feature several attractive properties, as discussed in the review by Maluin and Hussein [5]. The encapsulation of the active ingredients in chitosan NCs shields the toxic effect of the free agrochemicals on the plant and minimizes the negative impacts on the environment and human health, it increases the uptake due to the enhanced penetration of the nanometer-sized particles on the plant cell wall and cuticle, and it minimizes the wastage and leaching of the active ingredients due to the controlled release properties and high bioavailability of the nanoformulations. Further, chitosan features amphiphilic and bioadhesive properties, enhances solubility and stability, and its use can result in synergistic effects. Chitosan may also be used for nutrient encapsulation, i.e., for the preparation of nanofertilizers [6], and it elicits immune-modulatory activity. In this regard, it should be clarified that chitin has a pathogenassociated molecular pattern, which can be detected by the LysM/CERK1 transmembrane chitin receptor in the plant cells, and its sensing triggers an intracellular defense immune response (involving the activation of kinases and up-regulation of defense-related genes, such as plant defensin PDF1.2) [2]. For environmental remediation purposes, chitosan can be used as a flocculant and coagulant, and as an adsorbent for the removal of pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, dyes, antibiotics, and biological contaminants from wastewater [7]. The development of cross-linked chitosan-based systems for drug delivery usually relies on tripolyphosphate (TPP), glutaraldehyde (GLA), ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, epichlorohydrin, polyethyleneimine, and phenylalanine chemical cross-linkers [8], although some of them (e.g., GLA) are considered to be toxic and can inactivate macromolecular drugs [9], while the others (e.g., TPP) face aggregation and dissolution stability problems [10]. The aforementioned issues can be overcome by using anhydride methacrylate (MA) as an alternative cross-linker. MA has been commonly used to modify the chemical structure of various natural polymers and biomolecules\u2014including polysaccharides\u2014with a significant coupling efficiency under mild reaction conditions [11], without affecting the biocompatibility of the final product [12]. The carbon\u2013carbon double bonds of the methacryl groups can react with hydroxyl- and amino-groups, leading to the covalent attachment of methacryloyl moieties, which can be used in subsequent cross-linkage reactions. Modification with MA has been reported to improve the encapsulation of the bioactive compounds [13] and to enhance the water solubility and the capacity of the gel and scaffold formation of chitosan [14]. Concerning NCs preparation, MA has been successfully used as a cross-linking agent in lignin\u2013bio-based amine NCs [15] and lignin\u2013chitosan oligomers-based NCs [16]. To exploit the susceptibility of MA to act as a link between the related chemical species, resulting in a ternary complex with transporter properties, and to broaden the profile of the analogous complexes, in this study, we have explored the feasibility of the synthesis and behavior of the graphene carbon nitride-methacrylate-chitosan oligomers (g-C3N4-MA-COS) system as a nanocarrier. Regarding the inclusion of the g-C3N4 moiety in the g-C3N4-MA-COS assembly, it should be noted that carbon nitride has gained extensive attention due to its excellent physicochemical properties, attractive electronic band structure, and low cost. Concerning the functions enabled by g-C3N4 toward the end applications of the multifunctional NCs, g-C3N4 nanosheets have been shown to be a suitable functional component for bioactive product delivery due to their low toxicity, excellent biocompatibility, high penetration into tissues ability, photosensitive and pH-sensitive properties, efficiency in drug encapsulation\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981 3 of 18\n(associated with their large surface area), and positive effect on the release of encapsulated compounds [17]. Regarding the environmental applications, g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are very efficient for pollutant degradation and bacterial disinfection [18,19]. The use of g-C3N4 in combination with chitosan has precedents in, for instance, the work by Gupta and Gupta [20] on chitosan hydrogels that were embedded with gC3N4/ZnO nanoparticles for ciprofloxacin removal or in the chitosan films incorporated with curcumin-loaded hollow g-C3N4 nanoparticles (prepared using nanosized silica template) for bananas preservation that was reported by Ni et al. [21]. pH-sensitive NCs based on a composite of chitosan/agarose/g-C3N4 were also investigated by RajabzadehKhosroshahi et al. [17] as a drug delivery system for anticancer curcumin release, in which glyoxal was used to cross-link chitosan and agarose (2:1, w/w). Likewise, a system based on Pd nanoparticles embedded in micro-sized chitosan-g-C3N4 hybrid spheres (0.9 mm in diameter) was reported by Y\u0131lmaz Baran et al. [22] for the treatment of environmental pollutants in the aqueous medium, although in this case the chitosan-g-C3N4 mixture spheres were obtained through a spherification process of chitosan (using GLA), in which g-C3N4 did not intervene. Hence, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, the actual cross-linkage between chitosan and g-C3N4 to form NCs has not been explored to date. In the work presented herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of multifunctional NCs based on the chemical cross-linkage of COS and g-C3N4 using MA. To assess the presumed versatility of these g-C3N4-MA-COS NCs, environmental remediation (with two paradigmatic pollutants, rhodamine B dye and uranium(VI)), and biorationalbased antimicrobial delivery applications in agriculture (against three emerging grapevine pathogens) were also investigated."

To prepare the nanocarriers with the encapsulated R. tinctorum extract, 105 mg of the lyophilized extract that was to be encapsulated was added to the g-C3N4-MA-COS solution to obtain a g-C3N4:COS:R. tinctorum 0.5:1:0.25 weight ratio.

All of the experiments were performed in triplicate, and each replicate consisted of three plates per treatment/concentration. Regarding the inhibition of mycelial growth, which was tested against D. seriata and N. parvum, it was determined by dilution in agar, according to the EUCAST antifungal susceptibility testing standard procedures [34], incorporating aliquots of stock solutions (of NCs, either empty or loaded with R. tinctorum) onto a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium to obtain concentrations in the range of 62.5\u20131500 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121. Fungal mycelium plugs ( = 5 mm) were transferred from the margins of one-week-old D. seriata or N. parvum PDA cultures to plates incorporating the concentrations mentioned for each treatment (three plates per treatment/concentration with two replicates each). The plates were then incubated at 25 \u25e6C in the dark for one week. A PDA medium without any modification was used as control. The mycelial growth inhibition was estimated according to the formula: ((dc \u2212 dt)/dc) \u00d7 100, where dc and dt represent the mean diameters of the control fungal colony and the treated fungal colony, respectively. The effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) were estimated using the PROBIT analysis in IBM SPSS Statistics v.25 (IBM; Armonk, NY, USA)."

Each plant was grown in a 3.5 L plastic pot with a mixed substrate of peat and sterilized natural soil (75:25), incorporating slow-release fertilizer when it was necessary throughout the study period. One week after potting, the young grafted plants were \u2018wounded\u2019 on the trunk at two sites per stem (separated >5 cm), which were below the grafting point and without reaching the root crown. Thus, slits of approx. 15 mm diameter and 5 mm deep were made using a scalpel.

Twenty-eight replicates (plants) were set up for each pathogen, along with four positive controls per pathogen, plus four negative controls (incorporating only the treatment). The plants were kept in a greenhouse with drip irrigation and anti-weed mesh for five months. At the end of the experiment, the plants were removed and two transverse sections of each inoculated stem, between the grafting point and the root crown, were prepared and sectioned longitudinally. The effects of the inoculated fungi were evaluated by measuring the lengths of the longitudinal vascular necroses in each direction from the point of inoculation and comparing them with those observed in the controls. For each inoculation point, a single necrosis length value was obtained by averaging the four necrosis length measurements/wound (upper left, bottom left, upper right, and bottom right). Finally, the two mentioned fungi were re-isolated from the measured lesions and morphologically identified to fulfill Koch\u2019s postulates."

In the case of physical entrapment, no changes or minimal changes in the vibrational spectrum compared to the parent compounds would be expected, whereas in chemical entrapment, spectral changes might occur due to a possible chemical interaction between the extract components and the NCs [44]. Given that the encapsulation of R. tinctorum in the NCs resulted in no shifts of the characteristic bands of the FTIR spectra, thus suggesting that there was no modification or interaction between the \u2018shell\u2019 assembly and the phytochemicals, it may be safely assumed that the extract was physically entrapped (encapsulated) within the NCs, which is in agreement with other works [45,46]."

[48] for a chitosan/TiO2@g-C3N4 nanocomposite membrane (0.0238 min\u22121), although it should be noted that operative conditions were different (30 mg\u00b7L\u22121 RhB, pH = 2, and a 30 W LED lamp in the former study, and 5 mg\u00b7L\u22121 RhB and 100 W LED lamp in the latter one), so comparisons should be made with caution. If a comparison with pristine (non-doped) g-C3N4 was made, the reported k value would be intermediate between those of g-C3N4 and high-surface-area porous g-C3N4 (0.014 and 0.131 min\u22121, respectively) reported by Dong and Zhang [31]. It is worth noting that the indicated degradation rate would also be highly influenced by the pH value (six in our case for consistency reasons, provided that it is the usual choice in U(VI) reduction experiments) given that it substantially increases with the decrease in the pH values [49]. As for uranium(VI) reduction, no examples of composites consisting of g-C3N4 and chitosan have been reported in the literature, so a comparison with g-C3N4-only experiments was provided instead. The removal rate (k = 0.15 min\u22121) was intermediate between those of the bulk pristine g-C3N4 (0.04/0.06 min\u22121) and the highly mesoporous g-C3N4 samples (0.27 min\u22121) prepared using silica NPs (~12 nm) as a template [32,50] and it was comparable to other values obtained for pristine g-C3N4 and different g-C3N4/co-catalyst systems, although k values in the 0.05\u20130.42 min\u22121 range have been reported [51]. Again, although the pH was the same in all of the aforementioned studies, different initial concen-\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981 13 of 18\ntrations of U(VI) and photocatalyst:U(VI) ratios were employed, so comparisons are made merely by way of guidance."

            "text": "With regard to the antibacterial activity, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no data on the efficacy of the R. tinctorum extract against X. ampelinus are available. Nonetheless, previous studies in which the bactericidal activity of COS has been evaluated against the same isolate showed that the bacterial growth was completely inhibited at 1500 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 [52\u201355], which is a similar MIC to the one that was obtained in this work for the empty g-C3N4-MACOS NCs. As for the antifungal activity, a comparison of the EC50 and EC90 concentrations (i.e., the concentrations at which mycelial growth was inhibited by 50 and 90%, respectively) obtained for the R. tinctorum-loaded NCs versus those obtained for the unencapsulated R. tinctorum extract, which was previously reported in [26] against the same fungal isolates, is presented in Table 4. If the actual bioactive product weight is considered (ca. 14 wt%, according to elemental analysis results), the corrected EC50 and EC90 values would be noticeably lower than those that were obtained with the unencapsulated R. tinctorum extract. Although such a finding would support the hypothesis that the controlled release properties of the NCs would minimize wastage and leaching of the active ingredients, it should be taken as a first approximation given that the contribution of COS to the antifungal activity has been discarded (a simplification supported by its noticeably higher EC90 values, viz. 1180 and 1327 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 against D. seriata and N. parvum, respectively [56]).\nRegarding the in vivo results, it should be noted that the protective effect was limited by the assayed dose (i.e., the previously in vitro-determined MICs were 250 and 750 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 for D. seriata and N. parvum, respectively), which suggests that a higher concentration would be needed to achieve full protection (in terms of reduction of vascular necrosis) in the field tests against the two pathogens."

            "heading": "4.4. Mechanism of Action",
            "text": "With regard to the photocatalytic activity, it should be only ascribed to the g-C3N4 moiety. In the case of RhB degradation, the photocatalytic pathway includes N-de-ethylation, chromophore structure cleavage, ring-opening, and mineralization processes [57]. Although hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) generated via the electron-induced multistep reduction of O2 (induced by the light irradiation of g-C3N4) have generally been considered to be the main reactive oxidation species [58], more recent works have suggested that photogenerated superoxide (O2\u2022 or HOO\u2022) species would play a major role in the photocatalytic process [57]. In relation to the U(VI) photocatalytic reduction mechanism, it is not fully understood, but Zhang et al. [51], based on a thorough review of the state-of-the-art, suggested two possible mechanisms:\nUO2+2 + e \u2212 \u2192 UO+2 , UO + 2 + e \u2212 \u2192 U4+, (1)\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981 14 of 18\nUO2+2 + 4H + + 2e\u2212 \u2192 U4+ + 2H2O, (2)\nwith an associated redox potential (vs. NHE) that was in the +0.062 to +0.31 range in the case of Equation (1) (single photogenerated electron reduction process) and between +0.267 and +0.57 in the case of Equation (2) (in the presence of acidity and two photogenerated electrons). Concerning the antimicrobial applications, it should be noted that antimicrobial activity has been reported for both g-C3N4 and COS. In the case of g-C3N4, it is ascribed to photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [59], while in the case of COS, different mechanisms of action have been proposed [60], including the interaction of the positively charged COS with negatively charged phospholipid components (which results in increased membrane permeability and the leakage of cellular contents), the deprivation to fungi of trace elements that are essential for normal growth due to COS chelating action, and the inhibition of mRNA synthesis due to its binding to fungal DNA (which affects protein and enzyme production). However, as shown in the in vitro studies, the effectiveness of the empty NCs against the assayed pathogens would be very limited as they have high MIC values. Thus, the influence of the g-C3N4-MA-COS shell on the antimicrobial activity may be regarded as being negligible in comparison to that of the encapsulated product, and the role of the NCs in these potential applications would be mainly restricted to the targeted delivery of the bioactive products. In this regard, in a similar fashion to previously reported lignin-based NCs, which successfully inhibited the growth of ligninolytic enzymes-producing microorganisms by releasing encapsulated fungicides [15], the presence of the COS moiety in the NCs studied herein may be useful to selectively release the encapsulated bioproducts (in this case, R. tinctorum extract) against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Such a release would be triggered upon the interaction with the chitosanase produced by the microorganisms, which would degrade the g-C3N4-MA-COS shell and selectively release its content. For instance, in the case of N. parvum, the chitosanolytic activity of the fungus is well established, and endo-chitosanase (GH75, R1GTL6) has been shown to have a central role in the host infection mechanism [61]. It should also be noted that, albeit they are less specific and have a lower efficiency, chitinases and cellulases also break down chitosan [62], and these enzymes are widely present in Botryosphaeriaceae and other wood-degrading fungi [63], suggesting that there is a wide applicability of the NC-based treatments. Finally, concerning the R. tinctorum antimicrobial activity, it may be ascribed to a combined effect of both the anthraquinones and phenols present in the extract [26]."

            "text": "The data presented herein support the rationale that the nanocarriers consisting of naturally or synthetically sourced polymers and inorganic materials can enhance the stability and performance of a broad range of active ingredients, which is in agreement with Pinto et al. [3]. However, despite their promising efficacy, the questions of economy and scalability must still be addressed in subsequent studies to determine whether these NCs may be scalable and transformable into economically viable solutions to solve present and future agricultural problems (i.e., technical constraints concerning the production of NCs for use in agriculture should be correlated with the economical boundaries which limit the production costs and configure the potential revenues for the producers [2]). Further, the issues related to safety assessment, evaluation standards, registration policies, and public concern should also be addressed, as noted by An et al. [64]. Concerning the NCs\u2019 prospective practical use, it is worth noting that the current level of knowledge does not yet allow a fair and unbiased assessment of the pros and cons that will arise from the use of nano-based systems for the encapsulation of bioactive products and their use in agriculture. Nonetheless, one may be optimistic about the applicability of NCs such as the ones presented in this work given that at the moment there are already over 200 products commercialized worldwide that can be classified as nano-based products\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8981 15 of 18\nin agriculture and that the nanotechnology market in the agricultural sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of ca. 28% [4]."

            "text": "In this work, methacrylate anhydride was shown to be an efficient cross-linking agent to bind g-C3N4 and COS in a weight ratio of 0.5:1, leading to the formation of monodisperse nanocarriers with a mean size of 85.5 \u00b1 21.3 nm. Regardless of whether the g-C3N4-MACOS assembly is considered to be the result of grafting one of its moieties onto the other or a polymeric scaffold, the photocatalytic activity and the behavior as carriers for the targeted delivery of bioactive products have been demonstrated. Due to the presence of the gC3N4 moiety, the nanocarriers were able to efficiently photodegrade RhB and photoreduce U(VI) with rate constants of 0.025 and 0.15 min\u22121, respectively, which are higher than those of bulk pristine g-C3N4. In turn, the presence of the COS moiety allowed a selective release of encapsulated R. tinctorum extract against certain grapevine phytopathogens. The in vitro results supported the more efficient use of the bioactive product, with MIC values that are noticeably lower than those which were obtained with the unencapsulated extract. Moreover, the application of the extract-loaded NCs as a pruning wound protection product in young \u2018Tempranillo\u2019 grapevine plants that were artificially infected with N. parvum and D. seriata resulted in a significant reduction in the necrosis lengths. Therefore, g-C3N4-MACOS nanocarriers may hold promise as a multifunctional platform as they are more versatile than conventional chitosan-based nanoparticles are for environmental and agrochemical delivery applications."
