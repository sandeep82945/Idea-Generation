    "abstractText": "Green advocacy has been the focus of both practitioners and theorists for decades. However, little attention has been paid to employee green advocacy despite its significance to employee green behaviors and the environmental sustainability of organizations. In an effort to contribute to this nascent field, this study investigates what promotes employee green advocacy and its psychological mechanisms. Based on cognitive consistency theory, we propose that green human resource management (GHRM) can influence employees\u2019 organization-based self-esteem, which motivates them to engage in employee green advocacy to sustain their positive self-image and avoid possible cognitive disorders. Perceived organizational support moderates the relationship between GHRM and employee organization-based self-esteem. Data from a sample of 135 employees and their chief human resource officer (CHO) supported our hypotheses. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",

            "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the winter of 2020 was the warmest winter dating back to the 1880s [1], leaving people worried about the continuous deterioration of the natural environment [2,3]. To protect the environment, green advocacy has been proposed as an important way to encourage people to behave proenvironmentally [4\u20138]. Researchers mainly focus on general green advocacy for the public or customers, with little knowledge about employee green advocacy [9\u201316]. Employee green advocacy refers to the degree to which employees openly discuss environmental issues, communicate various views, and share green knowledge and skills within organizations in order to persuade co-workers to engage in pro-environmental behaviors [17,18]. Studies found that employee green advocacy is beneficial in creating a pro-environmental climate, improving environmental performance, and ultimately achieving organizational sustainable development [17,19\u201322], which further highlights the importance for organizations to encourage employee green advocacy [18,23]. However, limited studies have explored the antecedents of employee green advocacy, including leader green behavior [17] and employee perceived corporate social responsibility [24,25]. Green human resource management (GHRM), the human resource management aspects of environmental management [26], was indicated to facilitate green behaviors of employees through influencing their psychological states such as organizational commitment, psychological green climate, and pro-environmental psychological capital [21,23,27,28]. We choose GHRM to further explore its effect on employee green advocacy as well as the underlying psychological mechanism.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1807. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031807 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1807 2 of 19\nIn building a model linking GHRM and employee green advocacy, we focus on the literature of GHRM and green advocacy, respectively, to posit a mediating role of organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) and a moderating effect of perceived organizational support (POS). OBSE is defined as the degree to which organizational members believe that they can meet their needs by functioning in the organization [29]. Or in other words, OBSE means the evaluations of ones\u2019 self-value within the organization [30]. According to cognitive consistency theory, individuals tend to engage in behaviors consistent with their self-cognition to maintain a consistent evaluation of self-image and reduce possible cognitive disorders [31]. We posit that GHRM contributes to the OBSE of employees by signaling their high self-value within organizations, and employees with high OBSE tend to take actions to prove and enhance their value. Prior research proposed that whether individuals initiate advocacy depends on their perceived personal accountability [32\u201335]. GHRM improves employees\u2019 OBSE, promoting their faith in themselves. Employees are more likely to feel accountable for the environment and encourage others to behave proenvironmentally. Thus, we regard OBSE as the potential psychological mechanism of employee green advocacy. The moderating mechanism, POS, is the extent to which individuals believe that their organization values their contributions and cares for their well-being [36,37]. According to cognitive consistency theory, individuals have the tendency of maintaining a consistent understanding of things [31]. When people get consistent information about one specific thing from different sources, they will feel comfortable and reinforce their view towards it; however, when they get inconsistent information, they will be psychologically uncomfortable because of the lack of cognitive consistency and will take measures to diminish the cognitive disorder [38,39]. As both GHRM and POS help employees perceive being valued by the organization, we posit the interaction of GHRM and POS will help employees possess the cognitive consistency that they are valued by the organization and are competent for the job, which could exert an enhanced impact on their OBSE [29]. On the contrary, if employees perceive low POS in the process of GHRM, they will perceive inconsistent messages of their self-worth from GHRM and low POS. The contradictory recognition will cause them cognitive disorder. To mitigate the cognitive dissonance, employees may change their views of being valued and competent, which will consequently weaken their OBSE [29]. As illustrated above, we propose POS functions as a moderator in the relationship between GHRM and OBSE. Our research model is illustrated in Figure 1.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

            "text": "Cognitive consistency theory includes congruity perspective, which indicates that individuals have cognitive consistency toward things [39], and cognitive dissonance perspective, which argues that human may possess cognitive disorders because of conflicting knowledge from different sources [38,41]. An important and unique feature of cognitive consistency theory is its emphasis on individual\u2019s consistency cognition [31]. Individuals\u2019 cognition is literally influenced by mutual interaction of information from different sources [42]. Individuals tend to perform certain behaviors to keep their cognition consistent and avoid potential cognitive disorders [31]. Cognitive consistency theory not only explains the reasons why individuals perform specific behaviors from a psychological level, but also focuses on how individuals\u2019 psychological status and behaviors can be influenced when individuals are exposed to messages from different sources [42]. Using cognitive consistency theory, we can better understand employees\u2019 behaviors within organizations [31]. Employees are exposed to many informational resources that may shape their cognition within organizations. For example, organizational supportive practices can convey the important messages to employees that they are valued and supported by their organizations [43]. In this circumstance, employees will gradually build up front self-cognition. To sustain their positive self-cognition within organizations, employees would like to do something beneficial to the organizations [31]. Employee green advocacy is a kind of green behavior that contributes to improving organizations\u2019 environmental performance [17]. Based on cognitive consistency theory, this study wants to explore the factors that influence employee green advocacy. First, we want to explore the impact of GHRM on employee green advocacy. GHRM practices align organizations\u2019 environmental strategies with employees\u2019 pro-environmental participation [44]. To some extent, GHRM can not only reflect the implementation of environmental strategies but also directly affect employee pro-environmental awareness and action [21]. Thus, information derived from GHRM progress seem to be vital for employees to evaluate themselves [21]. Second, we expect GHRM can positively affect employee green advocacy via their OBSE. OBSE reflects a kind of positive self-cognition of individuals [29]. GHRM practices show the important role organizations place on their employees in enhancing green performance [21]. Employees are more likely to perceive that they are valued by organizations and build up front self-cognition via participating in GHRM practices. To sustain their positive self-cognition within organizations, employees would like to engage in green activities (green advocacy) [17,20,21]. Third, we propose that the interaction of GHRM and POS, as two distinguished information resources, may saliently influence employees\u2019 self-cognition: OBSE. POS, directly representing care from organizations to employees [45], determines employees\u2019 judgment of the organization\u2019s intention to implement GHRM [46]. If the levels of GHRM and POS are both high, their synergy will benefit employees\u2019 positive cognition, their OBSE. However, if the levels of GHRM and POS are different (for example, the level of GHRM is high but the level of POS is low), employees will develop inconsistent cognition of themselves, doubting if they are truly valued by organizations. Therefore, cognitive consistency theory can sufficiently explain the mechanism of our research model."

            "heading": "2.2. Green Human Resource Management and OBSE",
            "text": "Defined as the environmental aspect of management, GHRM aims at improving environmental performance and eventually contributing to environmental sustainability of organizations [44,47]. GHRM includes five major initiatives: green recruitment and selection, green training and development, green performance management, green pay and reward, and green involvement [26,44,47\u201351]. Presumed to be positively influenced by GHRM in this study, OBSE reflects the evaluation of one\u2019s self-worth in the organization [30]. Based on the literature of OBSE, we know that organizational members with high OBSE are usually the ones who recognize their self-worth and gain trust from other organi-\nzational members for their competence as organizational members [52\u201354]. We propose the implementation of GHRM can satisfy employees\u2019 OBSE, the specific psychological needs of employees within organizations. Next, we will discuss the relationship between the five GHRM practices and employees\u2019 OBSE to investigate the relationship between GHRM and OBSE.\n2.2.1. Green Recruitment and Selection and OBSE\nGreen recruitment and selection is defined as the process of seeking appropriate candidates with green values, knowledge, skills, and behaviors instrumental to the environmental management system within the organization [26,55]. Candidates chosen by green recruitment and selection will easily realize that their environmental knowledge and skills will be needed and valued by the organization. As OBSE reflects one\u2019s self-perceived value within organizations [29], we suppose the more employees believe organizations value themselves, the higher OBSE they will possess.\n2.2.2. Green Training and Development and OBSE\nGreen training and development is a process that not only helps employees realize the environmental effect of their organization\u2019s activities [56,57], but also cultivates employees with knowledge and skills related to environmental management [58]. Both providing employees with opportunities to participate in green training and focusing on their green career development will strengthen their sense of being valued by the organization and facilitate the crystallization of their OBSE [29].\n2.2.3. Green Performance Management and OBSE\nTo achieve better green performance, companies utilize a green performance management system to assess environmental performance of employees [59,60]. Green performance management refers to the process in which corporations adopt corporate-wide environmental performance standards to assess employees\u2019 utilization, conservation, and waste of resources [59]. Set in a green performance management system [26,44], green goals and performance indicators represent the high expectations from the organization and managers to employees. As the expectations from others are proved to play a shaping role in individuals\u2019 OBSE [61], a green performance management system positively contributes to the OBSE of employees [61]. In addition, Korman [61] believes that the evaluation from others, especially the evaluation from important persons in the organization, will have a significant impact on an individual\u2019s OBSE. As a part of green performance management [60], leader feedback represents leaders\u2019 evaluations of employees and thus may influence employees\u2019 OBSE markedly.\n2.2.4. Green Pay and Reward and OBSE\nGreen pay and reward is the practice of providing employees with rewards for their efforts and achievement in realizing green goals set in green performance management systems [60,62]. Presented in many forms, such as monetary-based rewards, non-monetary based rewards, recognition-based rewards, and positive rewards [26,44,60], green pay and reward signals that organizations value employees who commit to achieving green goals and contributing to environmental sustainability of the organization [26,60]. With such a hint, green pay and reward will contribute to employees\u2019 OBSE. Moreover, green pay and reward reflects the organizations\u2019 positive evaluations of green efforts of employees, which is also beneficial to the OBSE of employees [29].\n2.2.5. Green Involvement and OBSE\nAs Renwick et al. [26] described, green involvement refers to a process that managers provide opportunities to subordinates to participate in environmental management and address environmental problems emerging in the organization. Through green involvement,\nemployees are more able to raise novel ideas contributing to environmental management and express their own opinions of approval of or disagreement with decisions concerning organizational green issues [19,55]. Therefore, green involvement, in which employees\u2019 ideas and suggestions are respected and may be adapted to a great extent [55], can help employees enhance their OBSE by making them feel that their competence is admitted by the organization [29]. Summarizing the above arguments, we believe that GHRM can positively influence employee OBSE and propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1 (H1). GHRM will be positively associated with employees\u2019 OBSE."

            "heading": "2.3. The Mediating Role of Organization-Based Self-Esteem",
            "text": "Following Kim et al.\u2019s [17] conceptualization, we define the term employee green advocacy as the extent to which employees openly discuss environmental issues, communicate diverse opinions, and share green knowledge within the organization in order to encourage other organization members to engage in pro-environmental behaviors and eventually contribute to organizational environmental sustainability. Different from \u201cecohelping\u201d that focuses on helping co-workers in environmental aspects, employee green advocacy lays emphasis on persuading and calling on colleagues to engage in environmental behaviors [17,63]. Based on cognitive consistency theory, we propose that the OBSE of employees has a salient effect on their green advocacy. According to cognitive consistency theory, individuals will actively engage in behaviors consistent with their self-cognition to maintain a consistent evaluation of self-image and reduce possible cognitive disorders [31]. In other words, if employees perceive that they are valued by the organization (OBSE), they will commit behaviors beneficial to the organization to prove and strengthen their value. We posit GHRM practices motivate employees to engage in green advocacy partly through satisfying their emotional needs of OBSE. The possible positive relationship between GHRM and OBSE has been discussed in the previous section. We also suppose employees with strong OBSE, who have already recognized their high self-value within the organization, tend to continue doing things valuable to the organization, to sustain and enhance their value, and to avoid cognitive disorders of themselves [31]. Because employee green advocacy conforms to organization\u2019s green values and is constructive to the sustainable development of the organization [17,64,65], it is reasonable for employees who already perceived their high self-value within organizations (strong OBSE) to prove their value by engaging in green advocacy to sustain their positive self-cognition consistency. Moreover, studies indicate that the reason why individuals initiate advocacy concerns their perceived personal accountability [32\u201335]. Employees who believe that they are accountable in specific areas are more likely to be the advocates of this field [32,33]. As illustrated above, GHRM improves employee OBSE, promoting employees\u2019 faith in themselves. Employees who believe in their environmental accountability are more likely to encourage coworkers to behave pro-environmentally and become green advocates within organizations.\nAs illuminated above, the following hypotheses were formulated:\nHypothesis 2 (H2). Employees\u2019 OBSE will be positively associated with their green advocacy.\nHypothesis 3 (H3). Employees\u2019 OBSE plays a mediating role in the relationship between GHRM and employee green advocacy."

            "heading": "2.4. The Moderating Role of Perceived Organizational Support",
            "text": "POS is defined as the extent to which individuals believe that the organization they work for values their contributions and cares for their well-being [36,37,66]. We will discuss the moderating role of POS in the relationship between GHRM and OBSE according to the five dimensions of GHRM in the following section.\nWe suppose if organizations show care and attention to pro-environmental applicants (high POS) in the green recruitment and selection process, applicants will be more convinced that their green values are consistent with the organizations\u2019 and they are the ones needed by the organizations, thus they are more likely to build up OBSE [29,67,68]. In addition, when employees perceive high POS during their green training and development, on account of social exchange, they will study green knowledge and sharpen green skills more passionately to be more competent for green work than those feeling less support [66,69,70]. Such a sense of competence in their work favors their OBSE enhancement [29]. In the process of green performance management, if organizations set green performance standards in a more humanized way and care about employees\u2019 feelings when sharing appraisal results with them (high POS), such as praising employees with good performance while encouraging those with poor performance, these practices will fulfill employees\u2019 socioemotional needs of being trusted and respected [71], further improve their confidence in themselves, and contribute to their OBSE [29]. Following performance management, when organizations reward employees with what they desire (high POS), employees will be more willing to believe that they are cherished by the organization and will strengthen their OBSE [29]. In the process of green involvement, we posit that if organizations allow employees to be involved in organizational green issues and attach importance to their suggestions (high POS), employees will be more convinced that they are truly trusted by the organization and evaluate their OBSE to a higher level [29]. To summarize, we argue that high POS advances the promoting effect of GHRM on OBSE, whereas low POS weakens the promoting effect of OBSE by GHRM. Cognitive consistency theory indicates that individuals\u2019 cognition towards something tends to be consistent [31]. When individuals get similar cognition of something from different sources, it will strengthen their conclusions towards it. In contrast, if they get inconsistent cognition about something from several sources, they will possess a psychological discomfort and will take measures to narrow cognitive disorders [38,39]. Obviously, GHRM and POS are two different sources for employees to evaluate themselves. We posit that if employees evaluate themselves positively from the sources of both GHRM and POS, they will possess a consistent cognition of themselves. Such cognitive consistency will strengthen their view that they are competent for their work, which will improve their OBSE. However, if employees get a positive evaluation of themselves from the source of GHRM while getting a negative one from the source of POS, they will draw contradictory conclusions about themselves and will have cognitive disorders. An important observation of the cognitive consistency theory is that consistency is regained by changing the elements in the discordant relationship or reducing the importance of discordant elements [38,42]. To reduce the psychological discomfort brought by cognitive disorders and regain cognition consistency, employees may change their mind of thinking highly of themselves and regard the idea that they are competent for work as invalid, which is deleterious to their OBSE [29]. Above all, the theory-driven line of reasoning leads to the derivation of our fourth hypothesis as follows:\nHypothesis 4 (H4). POS moderates the relationship between GHRM and OBSE. When employees possess a higher degree of POS, they are more likely to build up stronger OBSE after the implementation of GHRM, compared to employees with a lower degree of POS."

            "text": "It is important to understand the great role of Chinese employees in helping protect the environment. First, corporate environment management has received much attention in China owing to growing public concerns and governmental pressures on environmental protection [72]. Employees\u2019 green awareness and actions can contribute greatly to corporate environmental performance [73]. Thus, it is practical to investigate the factors affecting employees\u2019 green action. Second, the environmental management experience in Chinese\ncorporations can provide references for other countries, especially for developing countries. China is the largest developing and manufacturing country in the world [74]. However, the rapid economic growth has caused great environmental damage due to the massive use of high-pollution natural resources (e.g., fossil fuel and coal). Thus, in order to reduce the environmental threats, Chinese government makes great efforts (e.g., issued the Environment Protection Law in 2014) on reducing the pollution caused by development [75]. Under this circumstance, Chinese corporations put environmental management into practice to pursue sustainable development [72]. Such experience is typical and helpful for corporations in other developing countries that may meet the similar environmental problems. Therefore, we tested our hypotheses in the Chinese context. Considering the availability of data collection, we invited 145 MBA students from universities in eastern China and their Chief Human Resource Officers (CHO, one employee matched with one CHO) to complete our questionnaires. These MBA students are also employees from 145 different companies in China, and the MBA programs they took are not full-time courses. In other words, they can work as usual but take MBA courses on the weekends. In addition, the majority of participants are less than 40 years old. It is vital to investigate how corporations cultivate employees\u2019 green awareness and actions at a relatively young age. Compared to older employees, younger employees are less likely to prioritize emotionally meaningful social goals; they tend to place greater emphasis on knowledge gathering and career development [76]. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors that affect younger employees\u2019 pro-environmental actions (which are also pro-social actions). We collected data at two different times to reduce the homologous errors [77]. We invited CHO to complete questionnaires including GHRM on the Time 1 survey. At Time 2, about 2 months later, employees were invited to assess their OBSE, POS, and green advocacy. They were also required to fill in their background information (demographic information like age, education; other information like organizational tenure, employment type, and organizational size). Participants were informed that the survey was only for academic purposes with strict confidentiality. After deleting mismatched questionnaires, we had a final sample of 135 sets of paired data with a total response rate of 93%. Table 1 shows the demographic composition of the sample. As shown in Table 1, the majority (88.6%) of the participants were formal workers, and a large proportion (55.5%) of them were within the age range of 30\u201339 years. Concerning education information of employees, 41.4% were of or above undergraduate education, whereas 58.6% were below the undergraduate education. As for the organizational tenure of employees, 30.5% were above 3 years and under 5 years, and 29.1% were above 5 years and under 10 years. For the organizational size, 39.3% of participants reported that their organizations contained more than 50 employees but fewer than 100 employees."

The questionnaires were first prepared in English and then translated into Chinese by a professional translation service company according to the back-translation strategy to ensure that the semantics before and after translation remained the same [78]. Before releasing the formal survey, some MBA students were invited to evaluate whether the questionnaires were understandable. After that, we did a minor revision of the wording. Unless otherwise specified, all measures in this study were evaluated by a 5-point Likertscale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) as described below. More detailed items of constructs of variables of this study are given in Appendix A.\n3.2.1. Control Variables\nWe controlled for employee\u2019s demographic variables like age, education, and other variables like organizational tenure (years employees worked in the organization), organizational size (the number of employees in the organization), and employment type (formal\nemployee or temporary employee). Because employees with longer tenure usually have greater opportunities to engage in social interactions that strengthen their emotional links with co-workers and increase their confidence to engage in green advocacy [24,79], it is advisable to control for the potential influence of the organizational tenure of employees. In addition, formal employees are more committed to the organization they work in than temporary employees [80], so they are more likely to engage in activities that are consistent with organizational value, like green advocacy. Therefore, we added employment type into control variables. Moreover, we controlled for organizational size because it may exert a great impact on employee green advocacy [17,81].\n3.2.2. Green Human Resource Management (GHRM)\nGHRM was rated by the CHOs using 18 items developed by Tang et al. [44]. The items consist of green recruitment and selection, green training, green performance management, green pay and reward, and green involvement. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.957.\n3.2.3. Employee Green Advocacy\nEmployee green advocacy was rated using the three items developed by Kim et al. [17]. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.922.\n3.2.4. Organization-Based Self-Esteem (OBSE)\nOBSE was rated on 10 items taken from the scale developed by Pierce et al. [29]. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.971.\n3.2.5. Perceived Organizational Support (POS)\nPOS was measured using six items adapted from the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS, Eisenberger et al. [37]). This shortened version of the SPOS has been used in previous research [82,83]. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.808."

A total of four factors with characteristic root values greater than 1 were separated out.

Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to establish the distinctiveness of GHRM, employee green advocacy, POS, and OBSE. Three item parcels for the OBSE scale and two item parcels for the POS scale were used, and these parcels were created using a factor loading strategy based on a preliminary analysis at the item level (i.e., having one strong loading, on weak loading, and one or two moderate loading in each parcel) [91]. Moreover, we first used five item parcels for the GHRM scale according to the five dimensions of GHRM [44], given the number of items compared with the study\u2019s sample size, and then we parceled the five parcels into three according to the factor loading strategy noted above to get a better fitting degree. As shown in Table 2, our four-factor measurement model was the best-fitting. The expected four-factor model (a priori model) was compared with four plausible alternative models, and the CFA results show that the expected four-factor model was the best-fitting model in comparison with the alternative models (see Table 2), which provided a reasonable fit to the data, supporting the unidimensionality of our measures: comparative fit index = 0.993; Tucker\u2013Lewis index = 0.989; root mean square error of approximation 90% confidence interval = 0.000, 0.081."

In order to protect the environment and realize environmental sustainability, green advocacy was proposed decades ago to persuade people to behave in an environmentally friendly manner [4,7,25]. The majority of research concerning green advocacy focused on ecologists [13,99], social groups, and non-profit organizations [12,15]. Limited studies paid attention to employee green advocacy, and few of them explored the psychological mechanism of it [17,24,25]. In order to fill this gap, our study introduces OBSE as the psychological mediation functioning in the relationship between GHRM practices and green advocacy, proposing and validating empirically the first psychological mechanism of employee green advocacy. Second, this study not only enlarges studies of green advocacy, but enriches GHRM literature by exploring the positive relationship among GHRM, OBSE, and employee green advocacy. The results of this study respond to calls from Tang and her colleagues [40], who indicate the great importance of exploring more mediating mechanisms in the relationship between GHRM and its related outcome variables. Moreover, prior research concerning GHRM outcomes focuses mainly on organizational performance [44,100,101] and less on employees\u2019 behaviors and attitudes [102]. This study provides OBSE, a kind of psychological attitude of employees, and employee green advocacy, a specific variety of employee behaviors, as outcomes of GHRM, enriching studies concerning GHRM. Finally, we enrich the POS literature by examining the moderating role of POS in the relationship between GHRM and OBSE. The salient relevance between POS and OBSE is widely acknowledged by large studies [96\u201398]. However, most of the studies discuss the direct linkage between POS and OBSE [96\u201398]. Little research explores the possible moderating role of POS in influencing OBSE. Our study tries to fill this gap by indicating that POS plays a moderating role in the relationship between GHRM and OBSE."

Given the pressure from stakeholders to realize environmental sustainability [59,103],\nmanagers could encourage employee green advocacy to improve environmental performance [23,104,105]. Our study indicates that employee green advocacy will flourish when the initiatives of GHRM are implemented and when employees\u2019 OBSE is improved, which provides a new method for managers to bolster employee green advocacy. The results of our study suggest that managers could stimulate employee green advocacy by enacting GHRM and facilitating employees\u2019 OBSE [17,21]. Second, managers are recommended to implement GHRM practices to improve their environmental performance. Specifically, organizations could implement green recruitment and selection by taking employees\u2019 environmental values and capabilities into consideration when recruiting and selecting suitable candidates. Organizations could also put green training into practice, enriching employees\u2019 environmental awareness and cultivating employees\u2019 green knowledge and skills. Setting a transparent green performance management system and evaluating employees\u2019 green performance fairly are also sensible ways for organizations to not only improve employees\u2019 green performance but promote them to become green advocates. Moreover, rewarding employees with monetary and non-monetary benefits for employees\u2019 achievement in realizing green goals (green pay and rewards), and providing opportunities to subordinates to participate in environmental management (green involvement) are also recommended. Above all, these specific GHRM practices will help organizations to fully stimulate the willingness and competence of employees to participate in green advocacy. Further, organizations should pay attention to employees\u2019 OBSE, their psychological condition. To achieve organizations\u2019 long-term development, it is necessary for managers to care about not only organizations\u2019 performance but also employees\u2019 psychological condition [106\u2013108]. This study reminds managers of the significance of OBSE, one of the main psychological factors that makes life meaningful [109], by linking it with employee green advocacy. An advisable way is provided in this study for companies to satisfy employees\u2019 OBSE. Results present that employees\u2019 OBSE can be enhanced by the interaction of GHRM and POS, indicating that managers should value employees\u2019 contributions and care about their well-being in the process of GHRM to reinforce employees\u2019 OBSE. Finally, organizations are supposed to provide support to employees given the importance of POS. Our study emphasized the significance of POS by exploring the vital role it plays in the relationship between GHRM and OBSE. Managers could take various measures to provide support to employees [46]. For example, in the process of green performance management, one of the practices of GHRM, managers could give reasonable feedback to employees, helping them find obstacles prohibiting them from realizing green goals set in a green performance management system and giving them advice about how to solve those problems. Besides, in the process of green involvement, another practice of GHRM, managers could give employees autonomy to engage in green issues and encourage them to deal with green problems with that autonomy [110]. Such instrumental feedback and empowerment could make employees feel that they are supported by the organization, thus contributing to the outcome of GHRM and the improvement of employees\u2019 OBSE."

Second, based on cognitive consistency theory, this study proposed one potential factor (GHRM) and the psychological mechanism (OBSE) that influence employee green advocacy. However, the antecedents and psychological mechanisms that facilitate employees to\nengage in green advocacy could be varied. Future research is suggested to explore and test more potential factors and psychological mechanisms that have impacts on employee green advocacy from different perspectives.
