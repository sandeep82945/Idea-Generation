    "abstractText": "Happiness is a debatable abstract concept as it is a term without any exact or precise way of measurement and evaluation and the current COVID-19 pandemic has affected the students with their happiness leading to a decrease in learning. The present study aimed to determine the factors that affect the students\u2019 happiness during online learning brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. 622 senior high school students who underwent online learning were given a questionnaire composed of 45 questions grouped into 10 factors under autonomy, competence, and relatedness that were based on the self-determination theory. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized in this research to determine the causal relationships between latent variables construct. SEM showed that autonomy was the most significant factor to students\u2019 happiness because students can cope with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The second variable was relatedness because continuous communication and support are evident among respondents. Lastly, competence was found to be a negative predictor because students are knowledgeable when it comes to the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the first study that utilized the self-determination theory approach in the happiness context during the COVID-19 pandemic, the study can provide areas for better innovation in online learning given that there is no definite timeline for this pandemic. Moreover, the education sector may take into consideration students\u2019 autonomy and relatedness to help increase happiness leading to satisfaction and continue online learning despite the COVID-19 pandemic.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe World Health Organization (2020) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic in during March 2020 forcing the suspension of establishments, some closed [1]. Among the suspension were schools and universities to protect students from the virus spread. The suspension of schools and universities highly affected the education system, forcing students to shift from traditional face-to-face learning to fully online [2]. Online learning changed the students\u2019 attitudes, motivation, understanding, and even added worry [2]. This is\nManuscript received October 18, 2021; revised February 7, 2022. Ardvin Kester S.

Moreover, this led to a decrease in students\u2019 appreciation and mental health well-being [3], [4].\nThe high level of behavioral changes added a psychological burden and led students to be unhappy [5]. With the psychological burden, sixty (60) percent of students said that the pandemic had brought them more emotional and financial stress [6]. The study of Redden (2020) also found that the current unhappy condition and the mental health of the students negatively affected their academic performance [6]. Terada (2020) stated that though some students are equipped with resources to continue, not everyone has the same opportunity [7]. Terada (2020) added that universities are not accommodating those who are not able seeing that learning decreased about 44% in reading and 66% lose in mathematics [7]. Moreover, Kuhfeld (2020) stated that access to technology would play a crucial role to equalize learning across all aspects [8]. This would add stress and unhappy feeling towards students and would lead to a decrease in their well-being.\nThe well-being of students is one of the most important factors to consider at this time. Yoo and Kim (2019) studied the relationship between students\u2019 overall perception of the educational environment and their subjective happiness [9]. The results showed that the students\u2019 overall perception was more positive for the educational environment, while there was no difference in the subjective perception of happiness found between phases. However, their study was not conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Badri et al. (2018) discussed the happiness of students about their social relationships at school and at home [10]. However, there is now the problem of separation of school, social interaction, and psychological aspects that plays a big role in students\u2019 learning [2]. Yang (2020) identified the factors that worsen and protects happiness or emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic [11]. The factors were the fear of contracting the disease, extent of potential harm, and relational concerns.\nDespite the availability of several studies regarding happiness in different aspects in other countries, there is a lack of academic research addressing students\u2019 happiness in online learning. Prior research has focused on happiness across different factors such as age, gender and religion, wealth, children and parenting styles, persons with disabilities, and education [12]-[17]. On the other hand, there were few articles about how happiness can be affected when\n555doi: 10.18178/ijiet.2022.12.6.1653\nthere is a crisis [11]. However, factors affecting students\u2019 happiness on online learning during a pandemic were rarely discussed. This topic plays an essential role since it can provide information in increasing the happiness of students. This may lead to a positive output towards learning and eventually lead to satisfactory academic achievement. Therefore, it is necessary to measure student\u2019s happiness on online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe objective of this study was to analyze the factors that affect students\u2019 happiness among Senior High School students on online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with the three main factors: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The result of this study can provide areas for better innovation in online learning given that there is no definite timeline for the pandemic. Moreover, this study can provide universities with factors for consideration in offering fully online learning that students may be happy with even after the pandemic. Therefore, universities may also use the result as a way to promote or use this as marketing strategy."

            "text": "Fig. 1 represents the Theoretical Research Framework of the current study. Structural Equation Modeling was utilized to obtain the relationships between the latent variables [18].\nThe goal was to assess the factors affecting students\u2019 happiness on online learning among Senior High School students during the general community quarantine (GCQ) of the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework was based on the self-determination theory.\nSelf-determination theory (SDT) is a general theory of human personality and motivation that is concerned with how the individual interacts with the social environment and relies on it [19]. SDT discusses the three basic, intrinsic, and psychological needs. Legault (2017) discussed that all individuals strive for and need autonomy (the need to feel free and self-directed), competence (the need to feel efficient), and relatedness (the need to communicate closely with others) in order to thrive and develop [19]. Thus, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH1. Autonomy had a significant direct effect on happiness. H2. Competence had a significant direct effect on\nhappiness.\nH3. Relatedness had a significant direct effect on\nhappiness.\nA. Autonomy\nThe study considers different measurements under autonomy: (1) Quality of Education, (2) Coping Ability, (3) Class Schedule, (4) Separation of Home and Academic Tasks, (5) School Workload, and (6) Internet Quality.\nQuality of Education is vital to autonomy as students have the need to learn all that they can as early as they are able to. Verspoor (1989) stated that there was a growth of children enrolled in developing countries throughout the world [20]. Therefore, providing students with access to education is said to be the main goal of the educational sectors across the world. Unfavorable economic catastrophes such as this pandemic may result in scarcity of resources which further jeopardize the ability of developing countries to provide quality education to their students, most especially in state-run academic facilities.\nCoping Ability of the respondents were taken into consideration as the pandemic has brought several problems that only the respondents may know how to deal with. With recent reports of students taking their lives because of problems, this factor will be able to determine the extent of what they can deal with before asking for professional help [21]. Dunkel-Schetter and Lobel (1990) stated that students experience high levels of stress in the domains of friendships, romantic relationships, family relationships, financial affairs, and academic work [22].\nClass Schedules may differ from countries and school to school. Building a complete schedule for a whole institution is work that requires a lot of attention and manpower. This is because considering factors such as instructor\u2019s schedules, student\u2019s classes, abilities, and much more need time to be accomplished. Alvarez-Valdes et al. (2001) has proposed a solution to the problem of creating schedules, but a concern is that different countries have different timetables and abilities of students [23]. Another note is that time is of the essence during this pandemic, with the added factor of internet traffic, platform availability, and network availability of all students.\nSeparation of Home and Academic tasks helps students balance their responsibilities at home and at school. The overlap of these two may lead to unfinished tasks as the respondent may not know which among these should be prioritized given that both are equally important. Not being able to do these may garner them a consequence either from school or those with them at home. In an article by Hishon (2020), working at home is the new normal and has become a challenge to a lot of people. This is because there has been a thin line create in the separation of work and home. In addition, Hishon (2020) added that there should be an emphasis given to the importance of being able to separate tasks at home and school.\nSchool Workload may vary depending on the type of school, academic level, grade level, and many other factors on both the institution and students\u2019 end. A student\u2019s workload is defined as the content, difficulty, and number or weight of tasks needed to be accomplished within a certain time frame. A heavy workload may lead to students being unable to rest as they need to spend more time doing these tasks. During this pandemic, the workload of some students\nwas adjusted according to what the institution sees fit, given that all interactions are conducted online.\nInternet Quality is one of the biggest factors to consider during online learning [24]. Taking the Philippines as an example, a country that utilizes online learning with poor internet quality. Hallare (2020) stated that the Philippines is ranked 110th out of 139 countries in terms of mobile data speed with an average of 18.49 megabits per second (mbps) [24]. The Philippines is also ranked 103rd out of 176 countries for fixed broadband speed with an average of 28.69 mbps. Students experience data lagging and disconnection in their classes adding to the burden brought by the pandemic. If online learning needs to continue further, the internet quality and access of students will be a vital factor.\nB. Competence\nKnowledge regarding the Pandemic helps the respondents and the public gain greater awareness thus, reducing fear of the spread of the disease. Johnson and Hariharan (2017) took note of the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the general public during the A-H1N1 Influenza pandemic [25]. The same situation may closely be applied to today\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic.\nC. Relatedness\nRelationship to Parents is seen as a great factor that affects the respondent\u2019s happiness since parents are those who impact on the student the most. As the general community quarantine continues, parents and children spend longer time\ntogether. Therefore, giving space to be able to talk and communicate is essential. Parents can shape the behavior and happiness of their children depending on how they respond to negative emotions shown by children.\nRelationships to Peers, better known as friendships, provide a safe space for children to openly express emotions without worrying how they will be treated at home. Miller-Slough and Dunsmore (2020) stated that friendship evolves during the adolescent stage [26]. The desirable source of emotional support and influence among friends can be positioned alongside parents to build a better relationship."

            "text": "A. Participants\nThe current study utilized convenience sampling due to the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was utilized, distributed through social media to assess online learning happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic among senior high school students [27], [28]. During the academic year 2020-2021, a convenience sampling of 622 senior high school students from different schools was considered. The voluntary responses of 199 male students and 423 female students were included for data analysis. Table I shows the descriptive statistics of the respondents.\nB. Questionnaire\nIn accordance with our theoretical research framework, a self-administered questionnaire was drafted for this study to evaluate the factors affecting students\u2019 happiness on online learning during the GCQ of COVID-19 pandemic (Table II). The questionnaire consisted of 11 sections: (1) Demographic Information (gender, age, type of school, type of school, grade level, and strand), (2) Quality of Education, (3) School Workload, (4) Class Schedule, (5) Knowledge regarding the Pandemic, (6) Separation of Home and Academic Tasks, (7) Internet Quality, (8) Coping Ability, (9) Relationship of Parents, (10) Relationship to Peers, and (11) Happiness.\nC. Structural Equation Modeling\nThis study utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to explore the causal relationships between factors affecting the students\u2019 happiness on online learning among Senior High School students during the general community quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic. SEM, also known as path analysis, is a multivariate method used to test hypotheses regarding the influences among the interacting variables [18]. It is effective in dealing with the lack of measurement errors and issues that self-report data may give [29]."

            "text": "From the results, Autonomy was found to have the highest direct significant effect on students\u2019 happiness on online learning during the COVID19 pandemic (\u03b2: 0.592; p = 0.032). Coping Ability, Separation of Home and Academic Tasks, Class Schedule, and School Workload were factors considered. These four underlying factors gave information about the happiness the students received about school-related tasks. From the final model, it was seen that students are able to cope when problems occur. Students are able to finish the task without asking for the extension of\ndeadlines, able to accomplish all tasks given throughout the week. Moreover, students are also able to work without any distractions at home and at the same time finish household chores. Lastly, it was seen that students were able to fix their own pace and schedule for all the tasks given. The results are supported by Dunkel-Schetter and Lobel (1990) wherein they stated that students experience high levels of stress especially under the domain of academic work and having ways to cope up is a key to their better being [22].\nHowever, Bezuidenhout (2015) stated that there is a significant implication to changing roles and resulting workloads for the students\u2019 well-being and mental health, especially in academics [34]. Hussein (2020) stated that the line between work and home is currently very thin that it is difficult to distinguish the difference [35]. As students try to balance doing their tasks at home and school, a heavy combined workload of these may lead to neglect of one of the responsibilities at hand. Therefore, autonomy would play a crucial role when students will struggle when pressure between household and academic chores increases.\nInterestingly, Competence was seen to be a negative predictor of student's happiness on online learning during the COVID19 pandemic (\u03b2: -0.185; p = 0.018). As students gain more knowledge on the status and cases of COVID19, it tends to lessen the level of their happiness as worry and fear step in. It was seen that students who are updated with the happenings of the COVID-19 pandemic are willing to learn more by reading about the current pandemic. Moreover, students tend to share information with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic to help raise awareness. Johnson and Hariharan (2017) supports the findings, emphasizing that organizations and social media companies prioritize news and happenings regarding the COVID19 pandemic [25]. This leads to information uptake of students with the current scenario. Therefore, the increased knowledge of the current COVID-19 leads to worry and unhappiness.\nThis result may affect the academic performance of students. According to Esani (2020), the current state of students is highly effective toward learning due to stress, anxiety, and unhappiness [2], [11]. Students\u2019 satisfaction with their learning and academic status is a vital role as it affects their education. This may lead to a decrease in their satisfaction, feel unhappy, and may affect their academic status [36], [37].\nRelatedness has a direct significant effect on students\u2019 happiness on online learning during the COVID19 pandemic (\u03b2: 0.305; p = 0.008). The relationship with parents and peers affect the happiness of students as they tend to spend most of their time during quarantine with their parents and families, meanwhile, friends are able to connect with each other forming a support group for problems that may not be discussed openly with parents and family.\nIt was seen from the indicators that the respondents have a great relationship with their parents. There is constant communication and understanding. The students are also found to be comfortable staying in their homes. Moreover, it was seen that students have control over their own happiness while maintaining good communication with friends. They also rely on their happiness to the people around them. Miller-Slough and Dunsmore (2020) stated that the\nadolescent stage is when friendship and relationships evolve [26]. The emotional support of friends and family is developed during this stage and would be a factor for the children\u2019s happiness. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, socialization has been considered as a challenge. Therefore, it would be advisable that constant relationship building through support and communication is a key to happiness.\nOverall, the results showed that if students maintain social interaction even online, the satisfaction and feeling of happiness would be present. However, if students would not be able to express themselves and communicate effectively, this would lead them to feel unhappy. Since the respondents can maintain substantial internet during online classes, this will not cause any disruption. However, if technology would not be available, students will not be able to catch up with those who are continually advancing with education as schools are not accommodating those who are not able [7]. The understanding of COVID-19 pandemic also plays a crucial role in student\u2019s happiness. The more students would understand the situation, the more they can adapt to the current state and system of education.\nA. Theoretical Contributions\nSelf-determination theory (SDT) covers human personality and motivation that is concerned with how individuals interact with the social environment and rely on it. Though not many studies utilized the Self-determination theory for measuring happiness, this theory was used to assess the students' happiness on online learning among Senior High School students during the general community quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic. The theory was utilized structural equation modeling to explore the causal relationships among the variables autonomy (A), competence (C), relatedness (R), and happiness (H). Moreover, this is the first study exploring human happiness during the COVID-19 that is in line with the online learning platform applied to students. From the results of this study, it was seen that autonomy and relatedness played an important role in happiness. This could be applied in other studies as a reference to measuring happiness.\nB. Practical Implications\nIn this study, there were more participants that are positive about the online learning during the general community quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study implied that the factors Autonomy and Relatedness had a significant effect on happiness. Even so, students need assistance and guidance from their family, friends, and their universities as the COVID-19 pandemic is still present. The reason why Competence was found to be significant is that the news about the COVID-19 pandemic is available online such as advertisements, social media platforms, and the news. Moreover, students need more support during the online learning of the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage the pursue to continue with online learning after the senior high school level. Furthermore, a healthy mindset and some mental health webinars are essential to promote happiness among students.\nThe findings could be helpful to the education sectors for them to assess what the effects of online education on the\nstudents are. It could also serve as a guide to create programs like webinars about time management and mental health awareness. Through this study, they can come up with a plan that could help everyone with the new online platform.\nThe teachers, school administrations, and offices will also benefit from this study in terms of understanding the well-being of their students. Guidance counselors will also benefit from the study for them to figure out the factors regarding the happiness of students and how they can give advice. Students will benefit from this study since they will be aware of the factors that might affect their happiness. Future researchers could benefit from this study as a basis for the effectiveness of online learning for students.\nC. Limitations and Future Research\nThis study utilized convenience sampling, consisted of students who are attending a private school. Future studies should include and compare public and private students as they are also utilizing online education. Moreover, the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore the distribution of the survey was online. There may be differences with the results of the survey was conducted face-to-face. Lastly, the performance of the students was not correlated, therefore the results of this study were solely based on the participants\u2019 current emotions."

Hence, the implementation of several preventive measures such as community quarantines to avoid the spread of the virus. The current study incorporated Self-Determination Theory to evaluate the factors affecting the student\u2019s happiness on online learning among Senior High School students during the general community quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA total of 622 senior high school students participated in the online questionnaire which consists of 45 questions. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling was utilized in this study to obtain the relationships of the variables. The happiness of students on online learning during the general community quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident within the following factors: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Results showed that autonomy was the most significant factor to students\u2019 happiness because students are able to cope with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The second variable was relatedness because continuous communication and support are evident among respondents. Lastly, competence was found to be a negative predictor because students are knowledgeable when it comes to the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs the first study that utilized the self-determination theory approach in the happiness context during the COVID-19 pandemic, the study can provide areas for better innovation in online learning given that there is no definite timeline for this pandemic.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\u2015The authors declare no conflict of interest\u2016\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\u2015Conceptualization, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; methodology, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; software, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; validation, M.K.C.P., T.M.A., A.S.P. and L.M.B.S.; formal analysis, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; investigation, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; resources, M.K.C.P., T.M.A., A.S.P. and L.M.B.S.; data curation, M.K.C.P., T.M.A., A.S.P. and L.M.B.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.K.C.P., T.M.A., A.S.P. and L.M.B.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; visualization, Y.T.P; supervision, A.K.S.O. and Y.T.P.; project administration, Y.T.P.; funding acquisition, Y.T.P.
