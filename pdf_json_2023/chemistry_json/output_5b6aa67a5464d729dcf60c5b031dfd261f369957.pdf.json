    "abstractText": "[1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives have been reported to possess important biological activities and may serve as attractive pharmacophores in the drug discovery process. [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a-1l) were evaluated for inhibitory potential for isozymes of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). CAs have been reported to carry out reversible hydration of CO2 into HCO3 , secretion of electrolytes, acid\u2013base regulation, bone resorption, calcification, and biosynthetic reactions. Whereas ALPs hydrolyze monophosphate esters with the release of inorganic phosphate and play an important role in bone mineralization. Both enzymes have been found to be over-expressed and raised functional activities in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The discovery of dual inhibitors of these enzymes may provide a synergistic effect to cure bone disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Among the test compounds, the most potent inhibitors for CA-II, CA-IX, and CA-XII were 1e, 1g, and 1a with IC50 values of 0.44 \u00b1 0.19, 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.32 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcM, respectively. [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a\u20131l) were approximately 4 folds more potent than standard CA inhibitor acetazolamide. While in the case of ALPs, the most potent compounds for b-TNAP and c-IAP were 1b and 1e with IC50 values of 0.122 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.107 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM, respectively. Thus, synthesized derivatives proved to be 100 to 800 times more potent as compared to standard inhibitors of b-TNAP and c-IAP (Levamisole and L-phenyl alanine, respectively). In addition, selectivity and dual inhibition of [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives confer precedence over known inhibitors. Molecular docking and molecular simulation studies were also conducted in the present studies to define the type of interactions between potential inhibitors and enzyme active sites.",

Whereas ALPs hydrolyze monophosphate esters with the release of inorganic phosphate and play an important role in bone mineralization. Both enzymes have been found to be over-expressed and raised functional activities in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The discovery of dual inhibitors of these enzymes may provide a synergistic effect to cure bone disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Among the test compounds, the most potent inhibitors for CA-II, CA-IX, and CA-XII were 1e, 1g, and 1a with IC50 values of 0.44 \u00b1 0.19, 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.32 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5M, respectively. [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a\u20131l) were approximately 4 folds more potent than standard CA inhibitor acetazolamide. While in the case of ALPs, the most potent compounds for b-TNAP and c-IAP were 1b and 1e with IC50 values of 0.122 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.107 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M, respectively. Thus, synthesized derivatives proved to be 100 to 800 times more potent as compared to standard inhibitors of b-TNAP and c-IAP (Levamisole and L-phenyl alanine, respectively). In addition, selectivity and dual inhibition of [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives confer precedence over known inhibitors. Molecular docking and molecular simulation studies were also conducted in the present studies to define the type of interactions between potential inhibitors and enzyme active sites.\nKeywords Carbonic anhydrase, Alkaline phosphatase, [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives, Simulation studies, DFT studies\n*Correspondence: Jamshed Iqbal drjamshed@cuiatd.edu.pk Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Carbonic anhydrases (CAs; EC: 4.2.1.1) are a family of pervasive Zn2+ metalloenzymes found in almost all living organisms, from prokaryotic cells to more complex eukaryotes. CAs catalyze the reaction of reversible hydration of CO2 via two-step reactions to yield HCO3\u2212 and a proton [1]. To date, 16 distinct mammalian CA isozymes having specific activity, physiological roles, kinetic properties, tissue specificity, sub-cellular localization, and susceptibility to various inhibitors have been identified. Carbonic anhydrase I, II, III, VII, and XIII are cytosolic isozymes; CA-IV, IX, XII, and XIV are trans-membrane; CA-VA, and VB are present in mitochondrial.CA-VI is a secretory protein commonly found in saliva and breast milk [2]. Cell surface CA-IX and XII isoforms have high expression in cancerous cells and are responsible for cell adhesion, proliferation, and mutagenesis. CA-IX has minimal expression in normal tissues, whereas it was found to be over-expressed on the cell surface of solid tumors. High expression of CA-IX and CA-XII in hypoxic tumors, coupled with the poor prognosis and the aggressive phenotype, make them candidate targets for cancer therapy [3].\nAlkaline phosphatases (APs, EC: 3.1.3.1), belong to the family of ecto-nucleotidases, are metalloenzymes having two Zn2+ and one Mg2+ ions present in active sites for optimal activities of enzymes [4]. Alkaline phosphatases are classified into two categories; tissue-specific APs and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Tissue-specific APs are further subdivided into placental (PLAP), intestinal (IAP), and germ cell (GCAP) [5]. APs catalyze nucleotides and release inorganic phosphate (Pi). APs can hydrolyze a range of substrates, i.e., glucosephosphates, phosphatides, and inorganic phosphates [6]. APs are assumed to be imperative in differentiating osteoblasts adipocytes and produce adenosine by sequential de-phosphorylation [6\u20138]. TNAP is predominantly found in bone and other mineralizing tissues as it regulates mineralization and bone formation [9]. Decreased levels of TNAP lead to skeletal hypo-mineralization [10]. Overexpression of TNAP causes mineral deposition in soft tissues and also causes osteoarthritis [11]. IAP regulates the accumulation of lipids and is involved in adipogenesis. Moreover, it protects against bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [12]. In the duodenum, the gastric proton is neutralized with secreted bicarbonate to generate carbon dioxide and water, whereas IAP and cytosolic CAs are responsible for maintaining homeostasis [13]. Selective inhibition of IAP inhibits bacterial growth [14].\nAlkaline phosphatase and carbonic anhydrases are involved in mineral deposition in bone which may lead to rheumatoid arthritis [15]. It has been reported that CA-IX and CA-XII over-express in the inflamed\nsynovium of patients having juvenile idiopathic arthritis [16, 17]. The raised activity of serum alkaline phosphatase has also been observed in patients affected with rheumatoid arthritis [18, 19]. Inhibition of both enzymes may have a synergistic effect in treating this pathological condition. Designing and synthesis of compounds that inhibit both enzymes can be very fruitful for treating arthritis [20]. Figure\u00a0 1 shows that CA and ALP are involved in bone mineralization.\nNaphthyridine derivatives are reported to exhibit antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and anti-cancerous activities [22, 23]. Nalidixic acid was reported as the first antimicrobial agent in 1962. According to the literature [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives are potential antihypertensive molecules. Some heterocyclic condensed [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives were also reported as antimicrobial agents [24, 25]. In short, the\u00a0 spectrum of activities of these\u00a0 derivatives\u00a0 includes antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities [25, 26]. These derivatives are also reported to show immune-modulatory and anti-cancerous activity [27]. In the current studies, the role of [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives was investigated for inhibitory potential against CA-II, IX, XII, and also for b-TNAP and c-IAP. The experimental results were subjected to molecular docking and MD simulations to study the possible interactions among active site amino acids and inhibitors."

This methodology was found to be operationally simple, versatile, and highly efficient. This synthesis scheme allows the introduction of different functional groups without the need for any specific catalyst or other additives. Sonogashira coupling reaction was used to synthesize the starting material (3-alkynyl-2-([1H]-pyrrol-1-yl)pyridines) of the chemical reaction. Under the best-optimized conditions, triethylamine (3\u00a0eq.) as a base and PdCl2 (0.03\u00a0eq.) as a catalyst were used in acetonitrile at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h. This optimized reaction gave the desired products an efficient yield of about 88%. In the final step of the synthesis scheme, cyclization was 3-alkynyl-2-([1H]-pyrrol-1-yl)pyridines was done in the presence of xylene and PtCl2 as a catalyst to synthesize [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a-1l). For the structural elucidation of these compounds, various spectroscopic techniques were used, including 1HNMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, MS, and HRMS [28]. These synthesized series of [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives were further screened for enzymatic activities."

Clinically used acetazolamide (AZM) was used as a positive inhibitor of CA. All compounds had excellent inhibition activity in low micromolar concentrations (Table\u00a01).\nData obtained from the inhibition of CA-II suggests that one of the most potent compound was 1e with IC50 (\u00b5M) \u00b1 SEM value of 0.44 \u00b1 0.19. The potency of this series was due to the substitution of R group. The most potent inhibitor of CA-II among the screened compounds, was found to be 1g that possess a methoxy substitution at meta position of benzene ring, Ig has IC50 value of 0.10 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0\u00b5M. In compound 1e butane was attached at pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine ring resulting in maximum inhibition. While in the case of compounds 1d and 1i the toluene was present which significantly decreased its inhibitory action with loss of activity, the substitution of anisole in 1f was also causing a decrease in inhibition as in 1b. Inhibition of fluorobenzene-substituted compounds was dependent on fluorine. In compound 1c fluorine at para- position was exhibiting more inhibition with IC50 \u00b1 SEM value of 0.90 \u00b1 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M, than ortho- position in compound 1j IC50 \u00b1 SEM value of 2.14 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0 \u00b5M. There was no significant change with the substitution of benzene or tert-butylbenzene. Only three compounds 1d, 1f, and 1i have shown less than 50% inhibition due to substitution of toluene and methoxy phenol.\nTable 1 In vitro assay results of compound 1a-l against h-CAII, h-CAIX, and h-CAXII.

Compound 1g exhibited its activity due to the presence of OMe group at meta position of the ring. Further substitution of this R effected the inhibition. The compound 1c has fluorobenzene with fluorine at position para position. If this fluorine is transferred from para to ortho position as in case of compound 1j, the IC50 is elevated to 1.65 \u00b1 0.98\u00a0 \u00b5M. Substitution of anisole with fluorobenzene had not much effect on its inhibition, while substitution of thiophene or tert-butylbenzene at the same position decreased inhibition drastically. Interestingly substituting pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine ring with butane in 1e also showed effective inhibition with an IC50(\u00b5M) \u00b1 SEM value of 1.61 \u00b1 0.26\u00a0 \u00b5M. Only two compounds 1b and 1k have shown inhibition of less than 50%.\nAll compounds were potent inhibitors of CA-XII. The most potent was 1a as in the case of CA-XII with IC50 (\u00b5M) \u00b1 SEM value of 0.32 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0 \u00b5M. Compound 1i is inactive against CA-II, while it shows significant activity against the other two isozymes. Similarly, compound 1d is inactive against CAII while showing marked activity against CA-IX and CA-XII (Table\u00a02).\nCompound 1b was most potent in the case of b-TNAP with IC50 \u00b1 SEM of 0.12 \u00b1 0.06\u00a0 \u00b5M, where Bu is substituted at para position of the ring. 1b was found to be 160 times more potent as compared to the standard inhibitor of TNAP, Levamisole (IC50 = 19.21 \u00b1 0.001\u00a0\u00b5M). Compound 1f exhibited a slight increase in IC50 because of substitution of methoxy phenyl at same position. IC50 was increased to 0.14 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0\u00b5M. Compounds 1l, 1e and 1k showed relatively close IC50 values of 0.24 \u00b1 0.06, 0.32 \u00b1 0.11, and 0.36 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. IC50 value of compound 1k is due to the substitution of the furan ring. In compound 1e free pentane is substituted at pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine ring which is responsible for its activity. In compound 1l activity is attributed to cyclohexane substituted at pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine ring. Substitution with fluorine as in the case of 1j, toluene in 1i and anisole in 1h resulted in loss of activity.\nCompound 1e expressed the highest potency against cIAP as butane is fused with a naphthyridine ring with an IC50 xvalue of 0.10 \u00b1 0.02\u00a0\u00b5M and found to be 800 times more potent as compared to L-phenyl alanine, a standard inhibitor for IAP. Any other substitution resulted in the elevation of IC50 value as shown in compound 1c substitution of fluorine at benzene ring increased IC50 value to 5.80 \u00b1 1.90\u00a0 \u00b5M. Substitution of anisole resulted in a loss of activity in 1h. In compound 1h anisole is substituted which resulted in a complete loss of activity. Activity in compound 1d is due to the substitution of toluene\nat pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine ring, having an IC50 of 0.30 \u00b1 0.20\u00a0 \u00b5M. Compound 1g exhibited an IC50 value of 0.35 \u00b1 0.21\u00a0\u00b5M due to substitution of methoxy phenyl at benzene ring attached to pyrrolo[1, 8]-Naphthyridine nucleus.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations For the last 30\u00a0years, among most popular techniques for doing ab\u00a0 initio calculations on the structure of atoms, molecules, crystals, surfaces, and their interactions is density functional theory (DFT). These calculations are used to understand the electronic behavior of a compound which helps in predicting the chemical reactivity. All the DFT calculations of this study [1, 8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a\u20131l) were performed using B3LYP functional theory and 6-31G basis set. The 6-31G is a medium basis set most commonly used for compounds with atoms up to Argon [41]. Using Gaussian software, a number of parameters, including the dipole moment, molecular polarizability, and optimization energy, were determined for all the derivatives [42]. The optimization energy of a compound is the amount of energy required to get the most stable configuration, i.e. lower the optimization energy of a compound higher its stability, which may be represented by its optimized structures. The optimized structures of all the derivatives are given in Fig.\u00a02."

            "text": "The energy of any compound for its highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, i.e., HOMO and LUMO, can be used to determine the range of chemical properties related to its electronic distribution [43, 44]. Any molecule with a high HOMO value appears to be an excellent electron donor; electron acceptors have higher LUMO values. Determining local reactivity at various sites in a compound was made more accessible with the help of the overall FMO calculation. A compound\u2019s HOMO/LUMO energy difference significantly indicates its reactivity profile. Any compound with a more significant energy gap tends to be less reactive, as indicated by the high hardness value of the compound. According to the DFT results, all 12 compounds were highly reactive, evident from their lowest average energy gap, i.e., \u0394Egap = \u2212\u00a00.136, which is almost common for all derivatives. The \u0394Egap results for all the other compounds are positive and are given in the Table\u00a03, along with other parameters. The dipole moment of any substance is related to the charge segregation in a molecule and helps to find its active sites. The higher value of dipole moment speaks for its more polar character with maximum reactive points. According to the DFT results, the derivative 1g has the highest dipole moment value, i.e., 3.07D, which is consistent with both in\u00a0vitro and in silico studies. The lowest dipole moment value of 1j is also relevant to other studies. In the same high polarizability value of compound 1g augments the DFT findings. The structure of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for all the compounds are shown in Fig.\u00a03 below, while the polarizability, dipole moment, energy, and relative energy gap are calculated and presented in the Table\u00a03."

The chemical formula (ELUMO-EHOMO)/2) can be used to determine the chemical hardness of a chemical system based on its stability and reactivity. The high value of hardness for a compound is related to its least reactivity and high stability. The ability of an atom in a molecule to draw protons towards itself is known as electronegativity, which is quantified by the formula X = -(EHOMO + ELUMO)/2). The electrophilicity index measures a molecule\u2019s capacity for accepting electrons by utilizing its electronic chemical potential and chemical hardness.
