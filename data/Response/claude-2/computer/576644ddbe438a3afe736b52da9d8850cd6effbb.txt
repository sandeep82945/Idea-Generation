 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop new static and dynamic test case features that could improve the detection performance of machine learning models for flaky tests. The paper showed the performance was still quite limited, so better features could help.

2. Investigate why the detection performance of the machine learning models varied so much between projects. Understanding this could lead to improvements in the models or the data encoding. 

3. Explore causal relationships between test case metrics and flakiness through controlled experiments. This could elevate flaky test detection to more reliable root causing.

4. Evaluate the application of CANNIER to other rerunning-based flaky test detection techniques, such as DEFLAKER. This could reduce their overhead.

5. Build a comprehensive flaky test detection and repair tool by combining CANNIER for detection with existing automated repair techniques. This could significantly improve developer productivity.
