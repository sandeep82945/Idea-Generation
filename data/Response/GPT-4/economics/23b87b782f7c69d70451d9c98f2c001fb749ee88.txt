Comparative Analysis Across Industries: Conduct comparative studies on the effectiveness of inter-network connections and intra-network cohesion across different sectors beyond pharmaceuticals, such as technology, automotive, or renewable energy. This could help understand if the findings from the pharmaceutical industry are applicable across the board or if industry-specific factors significantly influence the innovation ecosystem's structure and performance.

Impact of Digital Transformation on R&D Collaborations: Investigate how digital transformation and the adoption of advanced technologies (e.g., AI, IoT, blockchain) influence the configuration and performance of R&D collaborations. This research could focus on the ways digital tools facilitate or hinder knowledge acquisition and transfer, and how they impact the structural and relational configurations of innovation networks.

Longitudinal Studies on the Evolution of Innovation Ecosystems: Perform longitudinal studies to track the evolution of innovation ecosystems over time, focusing on how relationships and network configurations adapt in response to external pressures such as global crises, technological advancements, or regulatory changes. This could provide insights into the dynamics of collaborative learning and the sustainability of various network configurations.

Role of Cultural and Institutional Factors in R&D Collaborations: Explore the impact of cultural and institutional differences on the effectiveness of inter-organizational R&D collaborations. This research could examine how varying norms, values, and regulations across regions or countries influence the formation and success of collaborative networks, focusing on knowledge acquisition and innovation outcomes.

Micro-level Analysis of Individual Contributions to Collaborative Innovation: Shift focus towards a micro-level analysis that examines the roles of individual scientists, engineers, and managers within the R&D collaboration networks. This could involve studying how personal networks, expertise, and leadership styles contribute to the overall knowledge acquisition performance of the innovation ecosystem. Understanding the individual-level dynamics could complement the broader network-level insights and provide a more holistic view of the innovation process.
