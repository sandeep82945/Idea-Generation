These systems are called \u2018heartbeat\u2019 stars (Thompson et al. 012 ) because of the resemblance between the light curve and an lectrocardiograph. Thanks to the precise and nearly uninterrupted bservations from the Kepler satellite, the number of identified eartbeat stars has increased greatly as 172 systems are now listed n the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalogue (KEBC, Kirk et al. 2016 ; ttp:// keplerebs.villanova.edu/ ). Recently, more than 200 heartbeat tars have been found in TESS data (IJspeert et al. 2021 ; Ko\u0142aczekzyma \u0301nski et al. 2021 ; Hambleton, pri v ate communication), and 991 n OGLE data (Wrona et al. 2021 ). The presence of many eccentric binaries was predicted by Hut\n1981 ), who found, from a theoretical analysis, that if the ratio of the rbital to rotational angular momentum is sufficiently high ( 7), the ime-scale of decreasing the orbital eccentricity by tidal dissipation s much longer than the changes of other binary parameters. Hut 1981 ) predicted the rotation rate in such a binary system to settle nto pseudo-synchronization with an eccentric orbit, in which the ngular rotation velocity of the primary star should be close to (but lightly slower than) the orbital angular velocity of the secondary at he periastron (much faster than the mean motion). Such eccentric inaries should correspond to heartbeat stars. A Fourier transform amplitude spectrum (FT hereafter) of the ight curve of a heartbeat star reveals a long series of equally spaced rbital frequency harmonics caused by the strongly non-sinusoidal\nE-mail: saio@astr.tohoku.ac.jp\nw c\nu\nPub\night curve. In addition, it often shows amplitudes at frequencies ssociated with stellar spots and pulsations (oscillations).\nAssuming that a peak (or a tight group of peaks) and harmonics eparated from the orbital peaks in an FT are caused by a spot, r spots, on the rotating stellar surface, Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) btained the rotation periods for stars in 24 heartbeat systems. or 18 of them with eccentricities e v aluated in the literature, they ompared the rotation periods obtained with pseudo-synchronous otation periods that are determined from the orbital period and ccentricity (Hut 1981 ). Zimmerman et al. found that rotation periods f many heartbeat binaries are about 3 2 times the pseudo-synchronous otation periods, contrary to the prediction of Hut ( 1981 ).\nAmong the peaks that Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) adopted as otational modulations due to surface spots, there are cases in which he signature is not a single peak but a group of peaks spread o v er a ertain range of frequencies. Zimmerman et al. adopted the central requency of the peak distribution as the rotation frequency, assuming he group to be caused by spots on different latitudes in the presence f latitudinal differential rotation. Instead, we assume in the present paper such a group of frequencies o be caused by r modes (global Rossby waves influenced by uoyancy). The strong tidal forces would disturb the rotational flow n the stellar envelope, which would, in turn, generate Rossby waves nd hence their global modes, i.e. r modes, would be formed as iscussed in Saio et al. ( 2018 ) and Saio ( 2018 ). The presence of modes in binary stars is not limited to highly eccentric binaries ike heartbeat stars, but is common in close binaries associated with trong tidal forces. For example, Saio ( 2020 ) found r-mode signatures n \u223c700 stars among \u223c800 eclipsing binary samples of the KEBC ith orbital periods between 0.4 and 5 d and having Kepler light urves longer than three Kepler Quarters. The r-mode features in an FT of the light curve of a star are seful to estimate the rotation rate as discussed in Saio ( 2019 , 2020 ).\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) lished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nT v s a i\n2\n2\nK l C Q f t p f t r o T t a\no ( l e K c m l\nB o\nw a b F T d I s f\n2\nA K w\n1\n2\nd 3\na f\nFigure 1.

( 2017 ) and dditional heartbeat stars whose orbital eccentricities are obtained n the literature.\nM E T H O D O F ANALYSIS\n.1 Kepler long-cadence data to Fourier amplitude spectra\nepler long-cadence photometric data of heartbeat stars were downoaded from the KASOC (Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations enter) website. 1 Flux data (corrected by KASOC) for each Kepler uarter were converted into magnitude, and the mean of the data or each Quarter was subtracted from the original data. Then, using he software PERIOD04 (Lenz & Breger 2005 ) Fourier analyses were erformed for the combined data for all the available Kepler Quarters or each binary system. 2 We use amplitude spectra, which are referred o as FTs. All pre-whitening to produce FTs of the residuals after emoving orbital harmonic series was done using PERIOD04 . All of ur FTs are in the low-frequency range where r modes are visible. he long-cadence Kepler data have a Nyquist frequency a bit greater han 24 d \u22121 , but we do not show the higher frequency ranges as they re not rele v ant to the discussion in this paper.\nWe explain how we proceeded with our analysis with the example f the heartbeat star KIC 8164262, on which Hambleton et al. 2018 ) performed detailed analysis. KIC 8164262 has a relatively ong orbital period of 87.457 17 d (from the KEBC) and a large ccentricity of 0.886 (Hambleton et al. 2018 ). Fig. 1 shows FTs for IC 8164262. The upper panel shows the FT of the original light urve. The equally spaced (by f orb = 0.014 34 d \u22121 ) lines at f orb and any harmonics are caused by the rapid (strongly non-sinusoidal) ight variation during periastron. The orbital effects were remo v ed by using PERIOD04 (Lenz &\nreger 2005 ), in which the orbital effects were expressed as a sum f jmax sinusoidal variations\njmax \u2211 j= 1 A j sin [2 \u03c0( jf orb ( t \u2212 t 0 ) + \u03c6j )] , (1)\nith amplitude A j and phase \u03c6j , where t and t 0 are time in days nd a fiducial one, respectively. Period04 determines iteratively the est set of ( A j , \u03c6j ) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 jmax to minimize the residuals. or KIC 8164262, we have included 100 harmonics ( jmax = 100). 3 he sum of the sinusoidal series was subtracted from the original ata. The FT of the residual data is shown by the red line in Fig. 1 . n accordance with the results of Hambleton et al. ( 2018 ), our FT hows small peaks around 0.28 d \u22121 as well as peaks at the rotational requency 0.335 d \u22121 and its harmonic.\n.2 R-mode frequency ranges\nlthough Hambleton et al. ( 2018 ) identified the frequencies of IC 8164262 around 0.28 d \u22121 as g modes (retrograde to the rotation), e regard these frequencies, which are lower than the rotation\nhttps:// kasoc.phys.au.dk/ For KIC 3230227 and KIC 11403032, the de-trended long-cadence data were ownloaded from KEBC, because lower noise levels in the FTs were obtained. For each case, we adopted jmax large enough that no harmonic of significant mplitude was left in the FT, or that any such harmonic was at far higher requency than the r modes so did not affect the analysis of those.\nk e\nw f s d s\nrequency, as r modes. Those oscillations are global modes of Rossby aves influenced by buoyancy, whose frequency range expected in he observer\u2019s frame is given as\nf rot\n[ 1 \u2212 2 ( m + | k| \u2212 1)( m + | k| ) ] < \u03bd( m, k, n ) < mf rot (2)\nith azimuthal order m ( > 0 for r modes; in this paper, we adopt he convention that m > 0 corresponds to retrograde modes in he co-rotating frame), latitudinal order k ( \u2264\u22121 for r modes), and adial order n ( > 0) (see e.g. Saio et al. 2018 , for details). Even | k | orresponds to a pulsation mode whose light variation on the surface s symmetric with respect to the equator, while odd | k | corresponds o an antisymmetric one. The number of latitudinal nodal lines are k + 2 | for even r modes and | k | for odd r modes.\nIn the co-rotating frame, the r-mode frequency, \u03bdco ( m , k , n ), ecreases with increasing radial order n , as for g modes. Ho we ver, ince the frequency in the observer\u2019s frame is given as \u03bd( m , k , ) = | \u03bdco ( m , k , n ) \u2212 mf rot | and \u03bdco ( m , k , n ) < mf rot , \u03bd( m , k , n ) ncreases (getting closer to mf rot ) with increasing n . For this reason, he period spacing of r modes increases with increasing period, which s opposite to the period spacings of prograde g modes, as is well nown in \u03b3 Dor stars (e.g. Van Reeth, Tkachenko & Aerts 2016 ; Li t al. 2019 ).\nIf we assume that all of the r modes have equal kinetic energy, e can calculate the visibility distribution as a function of pulsation requenc y, by inte grating the pulsation amplitude across the stellar urface (see Saio et al. 2018 , for details). Examples of the visibility istribution for a model of KIC 8164262 with f rot = 0.335 d \u22121 are hown in Fig. 1 (lower panel), in which the solid and dashed curves\nMNRAS 511, 560\u2013571 (2022)\na U a f\no k s i m t r 0 W p f w\nv f a fi w s S\n2\nH m t m d p\nP\nU 2 2 o p s o P 2\nf o e d i a e l w a\n4\nK m\na p w 2 2 m a e\n3 S\nI v A T\n3\nH s a T m 0 f w\nw p m b f\nr H f 0 s w t C H t o b e a o\n3\nT ( o v 4\nM\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/511/1/560/6502360 by U niversity of C entral Lancashire user on 08 February 2022\nre for even ( k = \u22122) and odd ( k = \u22121, \u22123) modes, respectively. nsurprisingly, odd-mode visibility is smaller for a larger inclination ngle. In this figure, r-mode frequency ranges have values less than rot for m = 1 r modes, and are between f rot and 2 f rot for m = 2 r modes.\nThe most visible feature of r modes in an FT is a frequency group bserved somewhere between 2 3 f rot and f rot ; i.e. even r modes of ( m , ) = (1, \u22122). This is a general property of r modes as discussed in ection 3 of Saio et al. ( 2018 ). The expected visibility distribution s normalized arbitrarily at the maximum of the ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) ode visibility for all the cases in this paper. The frequency at he maximum visibility within the frequency range depends on the otation frequency; it is close to 2 3 f rot for slow rotations (say f rot < .2 d \u22121 ), while it increases to \u223c0.9 f rot for f rot = 0.6 d \u22121 in our sample. e try to fit both maximum visibility and frequency range. If it is not ossible, we give priority to fit the visibility range assuming that the requency at maximum visibility may be affected by the tidal effect hich is not included. Fig. 1 shows that the \u223c0.28 d \u22121 frequencies are consistent with the isibility distribution for r modes of ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) for the rotation requency f rot = 0.335 d \u22121 , which itself agrees with the frequency t one of the peaks generated by a stellar spot. In other words, by tting a frequency group with the visibility distribution of r modes, e can obtain the rotation rate even if in the FT no peak caused by pots is present. More discussion on KIC 8164246 will be given in ection 3.1.\n.3 Pseudo-synchr onous r otation periods\nut ( 1981 ) found that in an eccentric binary with orbital angular moentum that is much larger than the rotational angular momentum, he orbital motion and stellar rotation attain pseudo-synchronization uch faster than attaining synchronous circularization. Hut ( 1981 ) erived an analytic relation among the pseudo-synchronous rotation eriod P ps-rot , the orbital eccentricity e , and the orbital period P orb as\nps \u2212rot = ( 1 + 3 e 2 + 3 8 e 4 ) ( 1 \u2212 e 2 )3 / 2\n1 + 15 2 e 2 + 45 8 e 4 + 5 16 e 6 P orb . (3)\nsing parameters of KIC 8164262, e = 0.886 (Hambleton et al. 018 ) and P orb = 87.457 d in the abo v e equation, we obtain P ps-rot = .976 d, while f rot = 0.335 d \u22121 corresponds to a rotation period f 2.985 d which is very close to P ps-rot , indicating the system is seudo-synchronous. We note, ho we ver, that P ps-rot is sometimes very ensitive to the eccentricity, e , because equation (3) involves high rder terms of e ; for example, Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) obtained ps-rot = 4.22 d for KIC 8164262, using e = 0.857 (Shporer et al. 016 ). 4\nIn this paper, we select 20 heartbeat binaries which show r-mode requency groups in the FT, and whose orbital eccentricities are btained in the literature. Comparing these r-mode features with xpected r-mode frequenc y ranges for assumed rotation rates we etermine the rotation frequency of the primary star and compare t with the corresponding P ps-rot . Model parameters for each case re selected mainly referring to the parameters given in Berger t al. ( 2020 ); we have chosen a mass taking into account the uminosity, then chosen an evolutionary stage which is consistent ith the ef fecti ve temperature. Model parameters need not be very ccurate because the predicted visibility distribution of r modes for\nIn this paper, we adopt e = 0.886 obtained by Hambleton et al.

In our present paper, we adopt odels with dif fusi v e o v ershooting of h os = 0.01, in which mixing t distance z from the conv ectiv e-core boundary is proportional to xp [ \u22122 z/( h os H p )] with pressure scale height H p .\nR - M O D E FITS F O R SOME H E A RT B E AT TARS\nn this section, we show the fitting of frequency groups with r-mode isibility for four selected cases, while the rest are shown in the ppendix.

( 2018 ) carried out a detailed analysis of the heartbeat tar KIC 8164262 to obtain the binary orbital parameters as well s stellar parameters of the primary and secondary components. hey found many tidally excited oscillations whose frequencies are ultiples of the orbital frequenc y. The y also found a low frequency, .335 d \u22121 , with its harmonic, which they identified as the rotation requency, and three low-amplitude frequencies around 0.28 d \u22121 , hich they regarded as retrograde g modes. Adopting 0.335 d \u22121 as the rotation frequency for a 1.70-M model\nith (log T eff , log R ) = (3.837, 0.386), which are consistent with the arameters obtained by Hambleton et al. ( 2018 ), we obtained rode visibility for m = 1 and 2 (Fig. 1 ). The three frequencies found y Hambleton et al. ( 2018 ) around 0.28 d \u22121 are located within the requency range of r modes with ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122).\nAlthough not obvious in this figure, a small hump caused by modes with ( m , k ) = (2, \u22122) is visible around 0.6 d \u22121 in fig. 7 of ambleton et al. ( 2018 ), which confirms the r-mode interpretation\nor the humps in KIC 8164262. As mentioned abo v e, the eccentricity .866 \u00b1 0.003 obtained by Hambleton et al. ( 2018 ) yields a pseudoynchronous rotation period of 2.98 \u00b1 0.12 d, which is consistent ith the rotation period 2.985 d. The rotation period with the radius of he model corresponds to an equatorial rotation velocity of 41 km s \u22121 . ombining this velocity with vsin i = 23 \u00b1 1 km s \u22121 obtained by ambleton et al. ( 2018 ) yields an inclination angle of 34 \u25e6 between he rotation axis and the line of sight, which is, in turn, inclined to the rbital axis by about 30 \u25e6 (Hambleton et al. 2018 ). The misalignment etween the rotation and the orbital axes is possible in the binary volution theory of Hut ( 1981 ), in which the time-scale of the lignment is comparable to or slightly longer than the time-scale f the pseudo-synchronization (see fig. 4 of Hut 1981 ).\n.2 KIC 9899216\nhe orbital period of the heartbeat binary KIC 9899216 is 10.916 d KEBC). Fig. 2 shows FTs for KIC 9899216. The FT derived from the riginal data (upper panel) is dominated by features caused by light ariations associated with the orbital motion. After pre-whitening 0 orbital harmonics from the original data, we obtain the FT of the esidual data that is shown by the red line in the lower panel of Fig. 2 ; clear frequency group has emerged around 0.55 d \u22121 ( \u22486/ P orb ). Its requency range is fitted with r modes of ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) at a otation frequency of 0.60 d \u22121 ( P rot = 1.67 d). This is the fastest otation among our sample of heartbeat stars.\nTable 1. Observational and model parameters, and obtained rotation periods.

An r-mode visibility distribution for a 2.30-M model t a rotation frequency of 0.23 d \u22121 is shown in a similar way to ig. 1 . This star has the main group of peaks at \u223c0.18 d \u22121 and, as for any other cases, a secondary group of amplitudes that is formed y harmonics and combination frequencies among the main group f frequencies, which are shown by cyan lines in Fig. 3 .

Instead, we fit he frequency group with ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) r modes at a rotation requency of 0.165 d \u22121 ( P rot = 6.06 d) (Fig. 4 ). The rotation period btained is similar to the pseudo-synchronous rotation period, while t is smaller than the result of Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) by a factor f \u223c1.5. SUMMARY O F T H E RESULTS\nhe results for each heartbeat system and the adopted model arameters are summarized in Table 1 . The obtained rotation periods re compared with the pseudo-synchronous rotation periods in Fig. 5 . his figure shows that for the majority of the heartbeat systems in our amples, the rotation periods of primary stars are comparable to the orresponding pseudo-synchronous rotation, confirming the theory eveloped by Hut ( 1981 ). [The rotation periods of KIC 11403032 and IC 4372379 are comparable to the corresponding orbital periods see Fig. 6 )]. Our result is, ho we ver, dif ferent from the result of Zimmerman t al. ( 2017 ), which concluded that the rotation periods tend to e approximately 3 2 times the corresponding pseudo-synchronous\nNRAS 511, 560\u2013571 (2022)\nFigure 6.

The difference comes from Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) ssuming that the centre of the main frequency group in the Fourier pectrum of a star is the rotation frequency, while we fit the group with m , k ) = (1, \u22122) r modes assuming a rotation frequency larger than the requency of the main frequency group. Thus, the rotation frequency or period) obtained by Zimmerman et al. ( 2017 ) is systematically ower (or longer) than our value which is, in most cases, consistent ith pseudo-synchronous rotation. More specifically, as discussed in ection 2.2, the frequency range of the ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) r modes in he observer\u2019s frame is between 2 3 f rot and f rot ; or the period range is etween 3 2 P rot and P rot . The left-hand panel of Fig. 6 shows that in the heartbeat stars with rbital periods longer than 8 d pseudo-synchronization is roughly ttained in all but KIC 10334122 (with large error bars), while all four ystems of our sample with P orb 8 d have rotation periods longer han the corresponding P ps-rot . Among the four systems with shorter rbital periods, KIC 4372379 and KIC 11403032, which have small ccentricities of 0.342 and 0.288, respectively, have rotation periods omparable to the orbital periods (see the right-hand panel of Fig. 6 ); n particular, the rotation of KIC 4372379 is almost synchronous with he orbital motion. The rotation periods of the other heartbeat stars in his figure are smaller than the corresponding orbital periods, which s because the angular velocity of the pseudo-synchronous rotation is omparable to the orbital angular velocity at periastron (Hut 1981 ). t is not clear to us why pseudo-synchronization does not occur in he relatively short-period systems with the orbital periods shorter han 8 d.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nmong the heartbeat stars observed by the Kepler satellite and ollected by Kirk et al. ( 2016 ), we have selected 20 stars whose Ts show densely gathered groups of frequencies that are consistent ith the visibility distribution of r modes, which have frequency anges that depend on the rotation rate. For each star, we have btained a rotation frequency by fitting the visibility distribution\nf ( m , k ) = (1, \u22122) r modes in a model whose parameters are onsistent with these given by Berger et al. ( 2020 ). The rotation eriod thus obtained is, in most cases, found to be consistent with he pseudo-synchronous rotation supporting the orbital evolution heory developed by Hut ( 1981 ). Scrutinizing in more detail, we ound that the rotation periods of all but one (KIC 10334122 with arge error bars) heartbeat binaries in our samples with P orb > 8 d re close to the pseudo-synchronous rotation period. Conversely, all our heartbeat stars with P orb < 8 d have rotation periods considerably arger than the pseudo-synchronous period. It is not clear at present he reason why the critical orbital period occurs at 8 d for the pseudoynchronization of heartbeat stars. This problem of understanding the ngular momentum transfer rate versus orbital period is particularly nteresting, given that the rotation rates in these shorter orbital period ystems are sub-synchronous, so angular momentum transfer from he orbit to rotation must continue for the system to reach pseudoynchronisation.\nATA AVAI LABI LI TY\nhe data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request o the corresponding author.\nEFERENCES\nerger T.

After removing dense orbital peaks (upper panel), a lear group of frequencies at \u223c0.2 \u22120.3 d \u22121 (red line) is apparent lower panel), to which we fit the frequency range of ( m , k ) = (1, 2) r modes in a 1.80-M model at a rotation frequency of 0.30 d \u22121 P rot = 3.33 d). The rotation period is consistent with the pseudoynchronous rotation period. Because of the very long orbital period, any orbital harmonic frequencies lie within r-mode frequency anges so that the amplitudes of these r modes might be enhanced by idal effects. 5 KIC 5960989\nhe orbital period of the heartbeat binary KIC 5960989 is 50.722 d KEBC), while the eccentricity 0.810 \u00b1 0.016 is adopted in Table 1 y avaraging the results of Shporer et al. ( 2016 ) and Dimitrov t al. ( 2017 ). Using these orbital parameters in equation (3), we btain P ps-rot = 3.80 \u00b1 0.50 d. Fig. A5 (lower panel) shows an T for KIC 5960989. Also shown are visibility distributions of modes in a 1.7-M model (see Table 1 ) at a rotation freuency, f rot = 0.22 d \u22121 , which is chosen for the frequency range of m , k ) = (1, \u22122) r modes to be consistent with the frequency group round 0.16 d \u22121 .

Cheng et al. ( 2020 ) obtained an orbital eccentricity of 0.734 for IC 6117415. Using that value of eccentricity and the orbital period 9.742 d in equation (3), we obtain P ps-rot = 2.502 d, which is omparable to the rotation period 2.33 d that corresponds to the ssumed rotation frequency f rot = 0.43 d \u22121 . Cheng et al. ( 2020 ) lso obtained an orbital inclination of 83 . \u25e62 and a projected rotation elocity of vsin i = 19 \u2212 20 km s \u22121 for KIC 6117415. Since our odel predicts an equatorial rotation velocity of 41 km s \u22121 , the nclination of the rotational axis should be about 30 \u25e6, which is nclined to the orbital axis by about 50 \u25e6. (Such a misalignment is lso found in KIC 8164262 as discussed in Section 3.1.) For the otational inclination of 30 \u25e6 (blue line in Fig. A6 ), amplitudes of m , k ) = (1, \u22121) r modes near to 0 d \u22121 are predicted to be larger (under he energy equipartition assumption) than observed, which could ndicate the antisymmetric r modes to be less strongly excited.
