Risk dynamic early warning is of great importance for financing risk decision-making. Intellectual property (IP) pledge financing is an effective way to alleviate the financial difficulties for technologically smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is very important to study the financing risk decision-making because of its higher risk compared with other mortgage loans. Based on Kalman filter, we establish the pledge financing risk decision-making model and extract the key variables affecting financing risk by principal component analysis. We test the model with 88 listed SMEs. *e results show that the average error between the predicted and the real values is 8.5% and the overall recognition accuracy of the model is 89.1%. *e risk decision-making model has high discriminant accuracy and can provide evidence to risk decision-making. a risk decision-making model based on kalman filter for Intellectual Property Pledge is is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

In this paper, we established the pledge financing risk decision-making model based on Kalman filter, because of cumulative and time-varying characteristics of financing risks, and extracted the key variables affecting financing risk by principal component analysis method. Listed SMEs are tested and analyzed, and we found the following: (1)*e average error between the predicted and the real values is 8.5%, so the model has higher fitting precision. (2) *e rate of a risky company wrongly judged to be a healthy company is 9.4%. Conversely, the rate is 12.5% for a healthy company wrongly judged to be a risky company. *e overall recognition accuracy of themodel is 89.1%. (3) *e risk decision-making model has high discriminant accuracy and can provide evidence to risk decisionmaking. In this paper, we only established the pledge risk decisionmaking model based on Kalman filter. As we all know, the risk of IP pledge is a very complex problem.
