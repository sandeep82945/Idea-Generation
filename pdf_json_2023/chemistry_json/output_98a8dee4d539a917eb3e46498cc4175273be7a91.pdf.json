    "abstractText": "There is a clinical need for conceptually new treatments that target the excessive activation of inflammatory pathways during systemic infection. Thrombin-derived C-terminal peptides (TCPs) are endogenous anti-infective immunomodulators interfering with CD14-mediated TLR-dependent immune responses. Here we describe the development of a peptide-based compound for systemic use, sHVF18, expressing the evolutionarily conserved innate structural fold of natural TCPs. Using a combination of structureand in silicobased design, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, biophysics, mass spectrometry, cellular, and in vivo studies, we here elucidate the structure, CD14 interactions, protease stability, transcriptome profiling, and therapeutic efficacy of sHVF18. The designed peptide displays a conformationally stabilized, protease resistant active innate fold and targets the LPS-binding groove of CD14. In vivo, it shows therapeutic efficacy in experimental models of endotoxin shock in mice and pigs and increases survival in mouse models of systemic polymicrobial infection. The results provide a drug class based on Nature \u0301s own anti-infective principles.",

Bond 2,8, Sandra Lindstedt3,4 & Artur Schmidtchen 1,9\nThere is a clinical need for conceptually new treatments that target the excessive activation of inflammatory pathways during systemic infection. Thrombin-derived C-terminal peptides (TCPs) are endogenous anti-infective immunomodulators interfering with CD14-mediated TLR-dependent immune responses. Here we describe the development of a peptide-based compound for systemic use, sHVF18, expressing the evolutionarily conserved innate structural fold of natural TCPs. Using a combination of structure- and in silicobased design, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, biophysics, mass spectrometry, cellular, and in vivo studies, we here elucidate the structure, CD14 interactions, protease stability, transcriptome profiling, and therapeutic efficacy of sHVF18. The designed peptide displays a conformationally stabilized, protease resistant active innate fold and targets the LPS-binding groove of CD14. In vivo, it shows therapeutic efficacy in experimental models of endotoxin shock in mice and pigs and increases survival in mouse models of systemic polymicrobial infection. The results provide a drug class based on Nature\u00b4s own anti-infective principles.\nSystemic bacterial infections are characterized by activation of the innate immune system, initiated by simultaneous recognition of multiple pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous danger signals by various pattern recognition receptors, such as CD14 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs)1, 2. TLR signaling and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) trigger a cascade of events leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, involving a massive release of cytokines, acute phase proteins, and reactive oxygen species1,3\u20136. This dysregulated inflammation causes organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a characteristic feature of sepsis7. Sepsis contributes significantly tomortality in intensive care units, resulting in substantial healthcare costs8. Globally, it affects a staggering number of individuals, with approximately 50million cases reported each year. Age-standardizedmortality rates reveal that sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of all deaths, resulting in approximately 11 million fatalities annually9,10.\nReceived: 29 March 2023\nAccepted: 14 September 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Division of Dermatology and Venereology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden. 2Bioinformatics Institute (BII), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore 138671, Singapore. 3Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden. 4Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden. 5SARomics Biostructures AB, Medicon Village, SE-22381 Lund, Sweden. 6BioMS - Swedish National Infrastructure for Biological Mass Spectrometry, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden. 7Division of Mass Spectrometry, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden. 8Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543, Singapore. 9Dermatology, Skane University Hospital, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden. 10These authors contributed equally: Ganna Petruk, Manoj Puthia. e-mail: ganna.petruk@med.lu.se\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nEfforts to treat sepsis solely by eliminating the invading pathogen have proven insufficient, as sepsis mortality remains high despite antibiotic treatment. It is crucial to note that antibiotics do not specifically target the excessive and harmful activation of inflammatory cascades triggered by bacteria and bacteria-derived PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nConsequently, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials employing other therapeutic compounds have been conducted in sepsis patients. However, apart from activated protein C, these all failed to significantly improve survival. Subsequently, activated protein C was withdrawn from the market due to lack of efficacy11\u201313. Importantly, systemic inflammation, which underlies sepsis symptoms, remains inadequately addressed, necessitating the development of alternative therapeutic approaches to improve clinical outcomes.\nInjury and infection are serious threats to the survival of an organism, and nature has therefore evolved powerful natural peptidebased mechanisms for controlling excessive bacterially-induced inflammation. Peptides derived from the C-terminus of thrombin (TCPs), initially discovered in human wounds14, control both bacterial infections and the associated inflammatory responses15\u201317 via transient and multiple interactions with Gram-positive and negative- bacteria and their PAMPs, and subsequent interference with CD14-mediated TLR signaling15\u201317, neutrophil chemotaxis18, and excessive contact activation17.\nSupported by preclinical data demonstrating that the TCP GKY25 (with sequence GKYGFYTHVFRLKKWIQKVIDQFGE) effectively treats infections and excessive inflammation in murine and porcine wounds, improving healing19,20, GKY25 is currently undergoing clinical development as a topical treatment for various wound indications21. The observation that GKY25 also reduces inflammation and mortality in animal models of systemic endotoxin shock and bacterial infection14,17 indicates that the drug concept could have clinical applications far beyond wound healing. However, like many peptide-based therapeutics, GKY25 is susceptible to proteases19,20. While generation of an endogenous \u201cpeptidome\u201d is advantageous in wounds19,22, yielding an overall boosting of natural host defense mechanisms19, such degradation is less preferable after systemic administration as it would require prohibitively large doses and frequent administration, and complicate the clinical and regulatory development work.\nWith this background, we therefore set out to use structural, functional, and evolutionary information for the development of a peptide-based drug class aimed for systemic use, expressing the evolutionarily conserved innate structural fold of natural TCPs in their active stabilized form. Employing a combination of structure and in silico-based design strategies, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), molecular modeling, and biophysical, cellular, and in vivo studies, we describe the successful development of a peptide-based compound, here denoted sHVF18, that specifically targets the LPSbinding grove of CD14, enabling inflammation modulation. sHVF18 is protease-resistant, ameliorates inflammation and lung damage in mouse and pig models of endotoxin shock, and reduces mortality in mouse models of systemic polymicrobial infection."

            "text": "Design strategy for TCP peptide mimics Stapling can significantly increase proteolytic resistance, target affinity, cell permeability, and plasma half-lives in vivo23\u201325. One recent approach involves peptide hydrocarbon stapling, which can stabilize secondary structure with a side-chain covalent hydrocarbon bridge26. The TCP-sequence KKWIQK binds to the LPS-binding hydrophobic pocket sequence of CD14, with the TCP-region overlappingwith amino acid residues involved in LPS interaction (RLKKWIQK)15. We decided to adopt a strategy enabling the preservation and boosting of TCP\u2019s core action towards a dual LPS and CD14 interaction, enabling multimodal\ncontrol of inflammation14\u201317,19,27. Based on structural and functional clues, together with in silico analyses of stapling positions and CD14 binding energies, stapling of Q17 and D21 was found to be optimal to generate a site mimicking the active conformation of LPS-bound and CD14 interacting TCPs, such as GKY25 and HVF1815 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). CD analysis of stapled GKY25 (sGKY25) indicated a structural conformation similar to the linear counterpart in complex with LPS (Supplementary Fig. 2a). sGKY25showed an improved protease resistance at its C-terminal part, comprising the HVF18 sequence (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c, Supplementary\nTable 1). Moreover, the peptide exhibited a significantly improved inhibitory activity on LPS-stimulated THP1-XBlue-CD14 reporter cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d). However, it also displayed significant hemolysis and, in connection to this, also a reduced anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated whole blood (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f), which precluded further development. Next, a two-pronged approach was adopted to generate anewgenerationof stapledTCPs (Fig. 1b). First, as a covalent link at the N-terminus in position 1 and 5 was compatible with CD14 binding (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and could protect from aminopeptidases, this feature was added to sGKY25. Second, as proteolysis of sGKY25 indeedgenerated a sHVF18 sequence,we concluded that this protected part could constitute an attractive mimic, as it contained the critical features governingpeptide efficacy15. In addition, we also synthesized N-terminally truncated variants, including the minimal CD14 interacting region KKWIQK (sKKW13). We analyzed the hemolytic effects in human blood and on red blood cells (RBC) and anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated human blood (Fig. 1c, d). The correlation between this peptide\u2019s respective IC50 for cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) in LPS-stimulated blood and its hemolytic activity on isolated RBCs is shown in Fig. 1e. Taken together, sHVF18 demonstrated the lowest IC50 values of the variants (around 5 \u00b5M), and the low RBC hemolysis was reflected by the low hemolysis in blood by the peptide at 50\u2013100 \u00b5M. Hence, by defining the therapeutic index in human blood as the ratio between toxicity and efficacy, sHVF18 showed an over 10-fold improvement.\nBiophysical and biochemical characterization of sHVF18 Circular dichroism (CD) yields information on peptide secondary structure. We found that sHVF18, in contrast to linear HVF18, yielded a significant \u03b1-helical signal compatible with its predicted conformation at the peptide\u2019s C-terminal stapled end. Both the linear and stapled peptides showed similar \u03b1-helical signals in the presence of LPS (Fig. 2a). It is well established that the \u03b1-helical secondary structure affects peptide hydrophobicity, and thus interactions with reversed phase matrices28\u201331. Correspondingly, analysis of linear and stapled HVF18 using reversed-phasehigh-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed a longer retention time for sHVF18 (9.42min) when compared with linear HVF18 (8.03min), confirming that structural \u201clocking\u201d increased the hydrophobic binding region of sHVF18 (Supplementary Fig. 3a).\nWe next determined the effects of various proteases on the two peptides using a combination of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b), RP-HPLC (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2c and Supplementary\nTable 2). The results showed that sHVF18 had improved resistance against the actions of human neutrophil elastase (HNE), P. aeruginosa elastase (PE), aswell as trypsin (Try). Analysis by LC-MS/MSofHNE and PE-treated peptides demonstrated a significant difference in fragmentation, with no identified sHVF18 fragments after 30min and 3 hof digestion (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2). The conformational stability of sHVF18 was further analyzed by exposure of the peptide to 80 \u00b0C followed by CD analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4). We found that sHVF18 still presented an \u03b1-helical spectrum with two characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm. The conformational flexibility of HVF18 after stapling was evaluated using HDX-MS32. The results reported in Fig. 2d (left panels) show that HVF18 becomes fully deuterated already\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 2\nat the 30-s label time, as indicated by an observed uptake of 9 deuterons (D) with no further increase at longer labeling times, which is typical for high flexible or disordered species, with little or no secondary structure involving hydrogen bonds present to protect from the exchange. Conversely, for the stapled peptide, the deuterium uptake increases with time (from 2D at 30-s to 6D at 9000-s), which most likely can be attributed to increased conformational stability (Fig. 2d, right panels, Supplementary Data 1)."

            "heading": "NMR analysis of sHVF18 structure",
            "text": "To gain further insight into the stapled peptide conformation, we performed a detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of sHVF18. Initial experiments, as well as TOCSY, NOESY, ROESY, 13CHSQC, and 15N-SOFAST-HMQC spectra for peptide in 50% TFE, are described in Supplementary Note 2. The secondary structure of sHVF18 was estimated (Fig. 2e). The 3D structural ensemble of sHVF18 was calculated using distance restraints derived fromNOE cross peaks and dihedral angle restraints derived from backbone chemical shifts. The peptide forms anL-shaped structurewith two\u03b1-helices, consisting of residues V2-L5 and K11-G17. The N-terminal and C-terminal\u03b1-helices are structurally well-defined, but there is significant variability in the orientation of the two \u03b1-helices with respect to one another (Fig. 2f). When the structure of sHVF18 in TFE is compared to HVF18 in the presence of LPS, it is possible to observe a similar L-shaped tertiary structure, with a pairwise backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 2g). The main differences are seen for the N-terminal part of HVF18, where the \u03b1-helix seen in sHVF18 is not\nobserved. This may, however, be due to TFE inducing sHVF18 into a more helical structure than LPS induces in HVF18, as shown by CD (Supplementary Fig. 9). In sHVF18, the N-terminal part of sHVF18 seems to be more ordered than in HVF18. The C-terminal \u03b1helix in HVF18 ranges over residues I9-G17, which is two amino acids longer than sHVF18. A more detailed look at the NOEs acquired for sHVF18 and a comparison of these to the distances in the HVF18 structure ensemble reveals some differences for residues L5, K7, W8, I9, and K11. This was not unexpected, given the different NMR conditions and structural constraints imposed by stapling.\nEffects of peptide stapling on CD14 and LPS interactions We previously showed that HVF18 has a higher affinity for CD14 than observed for GKY25, whereas the reciprocal applies to the two peptides\u2019 interactions with LPS15,17. The restriction of HVF18 motion upon binding to CD14 is expected to cause a loss of configurational entropy and, thus, a penalty in binding affinity33.\nBased on this assumption, designing a conformationally locked peptide should, therefore, lead to an affinity gain for CD14. To study this, we exploitedmicroscale thermophoresis (MST), a highly sensitive technique for probing interactions between components in solution. As predicted, the Kd of sHVF18 to CD14was significantly reducedwhen compared with linear HVF18 and GKY25, even in the presence of salt (Fig. 3a). The higher affinity of sHVF18 to CD14 is reflected by the peptide\u2019s significantly increased inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation in LPSstimulated THP1-XBlue-CD14 reporter cells (Fig. 3b). A similar activity increase was observed for the TLR-agonists LTA and PGN from\nFig. 1 | Selection of the stapled peptide with improved anti-inflammatory activity. a Selection criteria for stapling positions. b Illustration of peptide sequences. c The heatmaps show the hemolytic activity of the peptides on whole blood or erythrocytes (RBCs).

Briefly, measuring the exchange rate of amide bond hydrogens as the increase of mass upon exposure to deuterated buffer by mass spectrometry can provide information regarding structure, protein-protein interactions, allosteric effects, intrinsic disorder, and conformational change. In this case, if a ligand interacts with CD14, the potential interaction sites can be identified based on their lower uptake of deuterium (protection) than observed for the protein alone34. TheX-ray crystal structure for soluble humanCD14 has previously been solved, and a binding site for LPS proposed, with the main interaction traced to four functionally important regions delineated by amino acid residues 26\u201332, 41\u201344, 56\u201364, and 78\u20138335. The\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 5\nHDX data presented here support these LPS binding sites, and protection was mainly observed in the N-terminal rim residues, spanning F38-L106, followed by protection at longer label times for the region L123-W160 and downwards, indicative of a conformational change in CD14 upon LPS binding. (Supplementary Fig. 11). Interestingly, the HDX data also showed that sHVF18 (and HVF18) appears to interact mainlywith theN-terminal regionofCD14 (blue areas covedby redbox in Fig. 3c, and Supplementary Fig. 12). When LPS and sHVF18 were added simultaneously to CD14, the protection at the delineated LPS binding site decreased, and was significant only at 30\u2013300 s (Fig. 3c, and Supplementary Fig. 13). While the similarity in N-terminal engagement between LPS and peptide is indicative of competitive binding, the decreased protection observed when both are added simultaneously could be due to LPS-sHVF18 interactions.\nTo further investigate the mode of interaction of sHVF18 with CD14 as well as LPS, we first addressed the CD14 binding and performed unbiased in silico docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The structure of the sHVF18 peptide solved using NMR spectroscopy described above was first docked onto the structure of human CD14. To sample as many potential docking poses as possible, no intermolecular restraints were applied during the peptide-protein docking protocol. The majority (11 out of 17) of docking poses were located at the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (Supplementary\nFig. 14a), previously proposed to be the binding site for LPS and linear TCPs15. We first performed 200 ns simulations for each of the 11 docking poses around the N-terminal pocket, and encouragingly the peptide remained bound to the protein in all simulations (Supplementary Fig. 14b). The most representative structure across all simulated poses was then determined using clustering analysis, and was found to comprise ~90% of all frames. This representative structure was then subject to extended 1 \u00b5s simulations (details inMethods). The sHVF18 peptide remained bound throughout three independent repeats simulations, with the N-terminal residues consistently anchored to the binding site (Supplementary Fig. 14c). In contrast, the flexible C-terminus was more mobile, as indicated by higher RMSD values.Measurement of the per-residue solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for the peptide revealed the highest SASA values for the C-terminal E18 residue (SupplementaryFig. 14d), in agreementwith the increased flexibility of the C-terminus. Further clustering analysis of these longer trajectories highlight extensive interactions with residues on theN-terminal rimof CD14 that facilitate sHVF18 binding during the simulations including D44, F49, V74, Y82, L89 and L105 (Fig. 3d). The key residues involved in binding are similar to those previously proposed for linear TCPs and for LPS8. The residues on sHVF18 that are involved in binding include K6, K7, W8 and K11, which form the evolutionarily conserved TCP motif KKWIQK that has previously been shown to cross-link with CD1415. Contact analysis revealed stretches of residues on the N-terminal rim of CD14 that made significant interactions with sHVF18, primarily residues 42-53, 69-77, 81-90 and 104-110 (Fig. 3e). Our independently performed docking and simulations are consistent with the above HDX-MS data showing deuterium exchange protection for CD14 peptides spanning residues F38-L106 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). We note that our HDX-MS results also\nsuggest some allosteric effects of sHVF18 binding on CD14, although longer simulations would be required to observe these effects in silico (Supplementary Note 3). We acknowledge that while our HDX and in silico data provide a guide to the potential binding site of sHVF18 on CD14,more detailed structural studiesmay resolve a higher-resolution binding pose of the peptide.\nAs mentioned above, our HDX data also demonstrate weakened protection of the putative binding site in the presence of both LPS and sHVF18, suggesting LPS-sHVF18 interactions. We thus performed coarse-grained (CG)MD simulations of sHVF18 in the presence of lipid A (the primary bioactive lipid-containing component of LPS) (Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Note 4). We found that similar to the linear peptide8, sHVF18 spontaneously adsorbed onto the surface of a lipid A aggregate. We also repeated these CGMD simulations with an E. coli rough Ra LPS lipid aggregate, and observed similar binding of sHVF18 (Supplementary Fig. 16, Supplementary Note 4). In agreement, a microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding assay revealed that sHVF18 binds to LPS with a Kd of 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5M, while its linear variant binds with a Kd of 4.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5M (Supplementary Fig. 17). Thus, the observed LPS-sHVF18 binding is consistent with the weakened protection of the binding site on CD14 in presence of LPS (Fig. 3).\nOur results were further verified by atomistic MD simulations showing similar interactions of sHVF18 to a lipid A micelle (Supplementary Fig. 18, Supplementary Note 4). We performed structural analysis to compare the structures derived fromourMD simulations of lipid A-bound sHVF18 to the NMR structure of the peptide in 50% TFE. Clustering analysis highlights similar structural features, for example, two short stretches of alpha helices on the N- and C-termini of the peptide, and a more dynamic N-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 18a). Additionally, the backbone RMSD of the peptide after least square fitting to the NMR ensemble remained low across our simulation trajectories at around 0.5 nm (Supplementary Fig. 18b), while the peptide retainedmost of its helicity throughout (Supplementary Fig. 18c). This structural analysis thus suggests that the TFE-derived NMR structure is similar to the physiologically relevant LPS-bound state of the peptide. Taken together, our in silico docking and simulations provide further support that sHVF18 binds to CD14 at the same site as LPS, thus interfering with LPS binding and onward transfer, while simultaneously being able to neutralize LPS aggregates in solution. It is noteworthy that residues in the evolutionarily conserved TCP innate sequenceKKWIQK interactwith both CD14 and LPS in our simulations, emphasizing the significance of structurally stabilizing this particular region by addition of the peptide staple.\nEffects of sHVF18 on LPS responses in experimental mouse model We next wanted to evaluate the efficacy of sHVF18 in two endotoxininduced inflammation models. In the first model, the purpose was to explore whether sHVF18 could suppress LPS-induced local subcutaneous inflammation invivo aswell as to compare the effects relative to the linear peptide side-by-side. Using mice reporting NF-\u03baB activation, we found that subcutaneous injection of LPS yielded a local inflammatory response, which was abrogated by sHVF18 during the\nFig. 3 | Effects of stapling on CD14 binding. a Representative binding curves betweenCD14 andGKY25,HVF18or sHVF18, in thepresenceor the absenceofNaCl, obtained by MST.

The linear peptide did not show any inhibitory effects at the same dose (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 19a). We next used a \u201cclassical\u201d systemicmodel of endotoxin-induced shock. C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a sublethal dose of LPS and treated (i.p.) after 30min with increasing doses of sHVF18. We observed a significant reduction in plasmaTNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, andMCP-1\nlevels by sHVF18 in thedose range20\u2013100 \u00b5gafter 20h (Supplementary\nFig. 19b). sHVF18 (50 and 100 \u00b5g) and an additional shorter treatment time of 8 hwere then selected to study both cytokine and lung changes. Both concentrations of sHVF18 yielded a significant reduction of cytokine levels (Fig. 4b). Moreover, histological analyses of lungs from LPStreated animals demonstrated a significant inflammatory infiltrate and\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 7\nincreased pulmonary leakage of proteins and red blood cells, while lungs of sHVF18-treated animals showed significantly less of these LPSinduced pathological effects (Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary Fig. 19c). SEM analysis showed that sHVF18 markedly normalized lung architecture (Fig. 4e) compatible with the histological analysis.\nEffects of sHVF18 on the transcriptome of mice stimulated with LPS To understand the molecular targets of sHVF18 in vivo, we decided to use the reductionist LPS-induced mouse endotoxemia model described above and examined the effects of 50 \u00b5g sHVF18 treatment on the transcriptional response. We performed RNA-seq of lung tissue after 8 and 20h LPS treatment in the presence or absence of sHVF18. Sample quality was ensured with an even sequencing depth (27.35 \u00b1 1.3million reads) and a high percentage of reads aligning to the genome (Supplementary Fig. 20a). Samples from mice treated with only buffer (control) showedminimal variability with very few genes differentially expressed between 8 h and 20h (Supplementary Fig. 20b). LPS induced a strong transcriptional response with 4209 and 5381 genes differentially expressed compared to controls (FDR adjusted pvalue < 0.01 and |logFC | > 1) after 8 and 20h, respectively. The most enriched gene ontology (GO) terms included \u201cInterferon response\u201d and \u201cResponse to virus\u201d (Fig. 5a). Transcription factor target analysis of significantly enriched genes in LPS-treated animals indicated activation of IRF- and NF-\u03baB driven signatures (Fig. 5b, red ridges). In contrast, the transcriptional response to LPS was markedly blunted in the presence of sHVF18 with only six and 1930 genes differentially expressed 8 and 20h after co-administration, respectively (compared to 8 h control, Supplementary Fig. 20b). Consistentwith this, a core set of inflammatory genes displayed high activity in LPS-treated animals whereas LPS + sHVF18 treated animals were remarkably downregulated (Fig. 5c) and showed much lower activation of LPS-induced transcription factors (Fig. 5b, blue ridges). Twenty hours after coadministration of LPS, sHVF18 and LPS + sHVF18, a three-way Venn diagram (Fig. 5d) showed that 3971 genes were uniquely regulated by LPS, largely overlapping with the response at 8 h. One-thousand-fivehundred-forty-three were shared between LPS and LPS + sHVF18 and this gene set essentially related to a residual LPS response, with GOterms such as \u201cResponses to interferon-gamma\u201d and \u201cPositive regulation of cytokine production\u201d being enriched. Finally, genes only regulated in LPS + sHVF18 (n = 359) were related to organelle fission, the centromeric chromosome region and humoral immunity, indicating a potential host-modifying response. Peptide alone had a very modest response, with only 31 genes regulated in total with noobvious common theme.\nWe alsowanted to specifically interrogate sepsis-related pathways and downloaded 14 gene sets related to sepsis from the \u201cimmunologic signature gene sets\u201d database (MSigDB, version 7.3). In LPS-treated animals (8 h), we saw an upregulation of nine of these 14 gene sets (p < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 21), which was confirmed by plotting the\nleading-edge genes for these gene sets in a volcano plot (Supplementary Fig. 22a), clearly indicating a strong upregulation of sepsisrelated genes. In stark contrast, when we tested these gene sets in LPS + sHVF18 treated animals (8 h), none were significant and plotting the previously identified sepsis genes in a volcano plot (Supplementary\nFig. 22b) confirmedminimal regulation of these genes in the presence of sHVF18 + LPS.\nEffects of sHVF18 on survival in an experimental sepsis mouse model The observation that sHVF18 was able to target multiple sepsis-related genes, such as LCN2, TNIP1, NFkB1& 2, SNX10, TNFAIP3,MMP14, BCL3, SERPINE1, SOD2, IL6RA, and ICAM1, prompted us to use a more complex in vivo model, i.e., the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis (Supplementary Fig. 23a). Themouse CLPmodel is the most widely used model for experimental induction of systemic inflammation during a polymicrobial infection and is currently considered a gold standard in research since it, with certain limitations, mimics the nature and evolution of severe sepsis in humans36,37. Usually, CLP-associated lung injury develops within 18 to 72 h. It is characterized by hypoxemia, neutrophilic inflammation, and interstitial and alveolar edema, leading to the deterioration of animal status and mortality. In this sepsis model, intraperitoneal sHVF18 treatment significantly improved animal survival (Supplementary Fig. 23b).\nEffects of sHVF18 in a porcine endotoxin-induced ARDS model Efficacy studies in large animal models are an important step in preclinical drug development and translational studies. We, therefore, investigated the therapeutic effects of sHVF18 in an established preclinical porcine model of ARDS38,39. ARDS was induced by injecting E. coli LPS intravenously (study outlines are presented in Fig. 6a). All pigs developed hemodynamic instability and required inotropic support following LPS administration (inotropic support refers to the use of agents of dobutamine and norepinephrine with the clinical purpose of maintaining hemodynamic stability). This hemodynamic instability and the differences between treated and non-treated pigs over the time course of the experiment are shown by the PaO2 FiO2\n\u22121 ratio (Fig. 6b), cardiac output (Fig. 6c), urine output (Fig. 6d), norepinephrine (NA, Fig. 6e), and lactate levels (Fig. 6f). Central venous pressure was low, indicating that the deterioration of the oxygenation capacity was secondary to acute lung injury and not due to cor pulmonale.\nFollowing intravenous administration of sHVF18, the treated animals stabilized in their hemodynamics and required significantly less inotropic support compared to the non-treated animals. sHVF18treated animals did not deteriorate as much as non-treated animals in the PaO2 FiO2\n\u22121 ratio (Fig. 6b), and only one of the five treated animals had mild ARDS while the rest did not classify as ARDS (according to Berlin\u2019s definition of ARDS40). At the endpoint of the experiment, lung tissue samples were taken from the right lower lobe and were\nFig. 4 | Effects of the stapled peptide on endotoxin responses in experimental mouse models. a A representative in vivo inflammation imaging by IVIS in NF-\u03baB reporter mice.

            "text": "Infectious diseases and systemic complications such as sepsis account for millions of deaths worldwide each year. The decreasing effectiveness of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents because of resistance development is an increasing problem. The need for innovative and effective treatments is therefore urgent. Current drug lead development has typically focused on developing drug candidates characterized by a single target, usually with high, nanomolar, affinities. For this, screening of vast amounts of chemical libraries has often been used, in combination with structure activity-based drug design in iterative processes in order to generate suitable high affinity compounds with the desired mode of action and low toxicity41. An example is TAK 242 (resatorvid), a small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 signaling, initially developed as an anti-sepsis agent specifically disrupting theTLR4-TIRAP interactionwith high selectivity and capableof inhibiting inflammatory mediator production at nanomolar levels42\u201344. Moreover, in order to speed up the drug development process and reduce the costs and time for clinical studies, drug repurposing has been employed45, resulting in drug candidates such as simvastatin46 and several oncology drugs47. However, finding drug candidates that bind single targets selectively and at high affinity has been questioned, suggesting it is far more productive to aim for several targets at the same time (themulti-target, polypharmacological drug approach)48,49. Interestingly, biological systems are generally governed by a multitude of weak and/or transient interactions (dissociation constant: Kd >\u03bcM), either working alone or in concert50. It is therefore notable that the evolutionarily conserved TCP innate fold, containing the sequence KKWIQK, participates not only in specific CD14 binding at micromolar levels, but also interacts with LPS. Moreover, TCPs modulate responses to other bacterial products such as lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and bacterial DNA27, inhibit contact activation17, and dampen neutrophil chemotaxis18, illustrating a promiscuous interactionwithvarious targets. TCPs can thereforebeviewed as natural \u201ctransient drugs\u201d, having a high off/low on rate, multivalency, and multiple targets15,50. The transient drug action can indeed explain the observation that TCPs down-modulate excessive responses to bacteria and bacterial products such as LPS, without completely abrogating inflammation, as it also has a physiologically relevant function in infection clearance and wound healing. Indeed, such phenomena can explain the therapeutic effects in experimental animal models of systemic bacterial infection and endotoxic shock, where treatment with TCPs reduced cytokine responses and animal mortality14,17 as well as in wound infection models, where TCP GKY25 cleared wound infection, normalizing healing19,20.\nThe major achievement in this work is therefore the successful design of a peptide-based mimetic of the TCP innate fold, providing a drug class based onNature\u2019s own anti-infective strategies. From a drug design perspective, we demonstrate that an approach based on a combination of structure-based design, evolutionary considerations, and molecular simulations is effective in generating several promising drug leads. The finding that peptide variants down to 13 amino acids showed anti-inflammatory effects, confirmed the dependence of the\nstructural innate TCP fold for drug activity. From this generated set, the optimal sHVF18 was selected based on a favorable therapeutic index. The mode of action of the designed sHVF18 was demonstrated using a broad arsenal of biochemical, biophysical, in silico, cellular and in vivo studies. Microscale thermophoresis, HDX-MS, and computational modeling showed that sHVF18 binds with high affinity to the N-terminal hydrophobic LPS binding pocket of human CD14. Indeed, HDX-MS data elegantly confirmed the in silico predictions for CD14 binding, both methods identifying the LPS-binding N-terminal region of CD14 as a target for sHVF18. This is in agreementwith recent reports describing the pathway for the transfer of lipid A from CD14 to TLR4/ MD-251, which highlights that sHVF18s binding near the hydrophobic cavity could either impede the transfer of the lipid or occlude the interface between the receptor proteins. The dose needed for sHVF18 to achieve these effects is much lower than for the original HVF18, illustrating the successful development of sHVF18 as a drug concept for systemic use. Moreover, while the endogenous HVF18 sequence is proteolytically degraded, sHVF18 showed increased resistance to proteases52. As proteolysis is a hallmark of systemic infection and sepsis53, reduced degradation of sHVF18 in a highly proteolytic environment during infection may hence further improve the pharmacological profile and reduce peptide dose and treatment frequency.\nMany drugs in preclinical development that show a promising target profile and toxicity in vitro fail in later in vivo development stages. It is therefore notable that the therapeutic potential of sHVF18 is supported by experimental data from both small and large animal models. LPS-induced microvascular lung injury in mice is a common experimental model reflecting ARDS development during sepsis54. In mice subjected to LPS-induced shock, we found that LPS-induced upregulation of multiple sepsis-related genes in lung tissue and cytokine levels in plasmaare reducedby sHVF18 treatment. It is particularly notable that the peptide shows a broad target profile, downmodulating multiple sepsis-related pathways. Moreover, sHVF18 normalizes lung tissue architecture with visibly less oedema and fibrin deposits in the alveolar spaces, compatible with a reduction of inflammation induced coagulation, as previously described for the endogenousTCPGKY2517. In contrast to the LPS-model, themouseCLP model is more complex, yielding systemic inflammation triggered by fecal Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The fact that sHVF18 treatment significantly improves animal survival is therefore compatible with the peptide\u2019s broad targeting of bacterial products from these bacterial groups along with inhibition of CD14.\nHemodynamic derangements and lung damage is a hallmark of human sepsis, and the use of the porcine LPS model of ARDS38,39 was therefore employed to enable an important translation to human studies. In this model, the excessive systemic inflammation is expressed as a sudden decrease in blood pressure, need for inotropic support, and reduced blood oxygenation and urine production. Analysis of lung biopsies confirmed the presence of acute lung injury, consistent with ARDS. sHVF18-treated pigs had an overall better outcome and became more hemodynamically stable over time with a reduced need for adrenaline after sHVF18 administration, and blood oxygenation and urine output were increased. sHVF18 thus ameliorated the symptoms of systemic inflammation and hindered the development of severe states of ARDS in this pig model.\nFig. 5 | Effect of sHVF18on transcriptomeprofiling inmice stimulatedwithLPS. a Linkage plot of genes and enriched GO-terms in LPS-treated animals after 8 h identifies a prototypical LPS response. b Ridgeplot showing expression distributions of core enriched transcription factor targets 8 h after LPS treatment (red) and for LPS + sHVF18 (blue) compared to controls (buffer only).

This regulation is greatly reduced in the presence of sHVF18. c Heatmap of core enriched genes identified in lungs from mice treatedwith buffer only (control), LPS, or LPS + 50\u03bcgmL\u22121, after 8 and 20h for\ngene sets identified as differentially regulated.Mice stimulated with LPS showed an upregulation of inflammatory genes, which are abrogated by sHVF18 treatment at 8 h and, to a lesser extent, at 20h. d Venn diagram of the number of overlapping genes differentially expressed (P value < 0.01 and |logFC | > 1 were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjami-Hochbergmethod) for LPS, LPS + sHVF18, or sHVF18 alone compared to control at 20 h. P values was calculated using a linear two-sided model. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed for overenriched GO terms and presented as linkage plots as in a.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 10\nCollectively, these results demonstrate a successful approach of transforming an innate structural fold into a peptide-based drug targeting TLR-driven systemic inflammation and moreover, show the therapeutic potential of sHVF18 in the reductionist endotoxin model and the more complex systemic polymicrobial infection model in mice. Themarked therapeutic effects in theporcine LPS-inducedARDS model further indicate the therapeutic potential of the transient drug concept based on TCP\u00b4s innate fold. While the herein described in vivo models offer valuable preclinical data, translating these findings to human studies on infected patients presents challenges. Animal models, while necessary and important in preclinical development, may not fully replicate the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 11\ncomplexity of human bacterial infections and the development of systemic inflammation in various sepsis endotypes. Furthermore, the variability in human patient populations, including genetic backgrounds, coexisting conditions, and compromised immune systems, can impact treatment response and drug efficacy. The timing of peptide treatment and the stage of sepsis development are also crucial factors affecting therapeutic interventions. To address these limitations, it is essential to investigate variables such as peptide pharmacokinetics, timing of dosing, metabolism, and toxicity, and characterize treatment effects in infection models that represent selected sepsis endotypes. This comprehensive approach will help overcome these challenges and determine whether sHVF18, with its multimodal and broad action, can provide a therapeutic opportunity for effectively targeting excessive systemic inflammation and ARDS during bacterial infections in patients."

The approach utilized a combination of structure-based design, evolutionary considerations, and molecular simulations to generate several promising drug leads. The generated leads were then analyzed for hemolysis, and antiinflammatory activity in cell models and human blood, and the optimal sHVF18 was selected based on a favorable therapeutic index. Protease resistance was assessed using gel electrophoresis analysis and mass spectrometry, and the structure of sHVF18 was elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, HDX-MS, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The interaction with the target receptor CD14 and its hydrophobic LPS-binding pocket was assessed using a combination of microscale thermophoresis, HDX-MS, and computational modeling. sHVF18 efficacy in vivo was demonstrated using local subcutaneous LPS-induced inflammation in NF-\u03baB reporter mice and endotoxin-induced shock in C57BL/6 mice. The systemic endotoxin model was utilized to study the transcriptional response and define inflammatory pathways targeted by sHVF18 treatment. Effect of sHVF18 on animal survival was shown in the complex cecal ligation andpuncture (CLP)model of sepsis. Since hemodynamic and kidney derangements, as well as lung damage, are hallmark features of human sepsis, these parameters were studied in a porcine LPS model of septicemia-induced ARDS to provide preclinical efficacy data that enables translation to human studies."

Spectra were processed using nmrPipe with squared cosine apodization and zero-filling in both dimensions. Spectrawere analyzed and assigned using CCPNMR v2.4. Spin systems were identified using a combination of NOESY and TOCSY spectra, where NOESY cross-peaks were used to assign inter-residue connections.\nStructure calculation: The 3D structure of the stapled peptide sHVF18 was determined using distance and dihedral angle restraints from assigned NOE cross-peaks and chemical shifts obtained for sample (d) described in NMR spectroscopy. Distance restraints from NOE cross-peaks for sHVF18 were generated and calibrated using the CCPNMR suite58. Only NOE cross-peaks with unambiguous assignments were considered for the structure calculations. Dihedral angle restraints were generated using the DANGLE software in the CCPNMR software suite, where dihedral angle restraints are generated based on chemical shift data from backbone atoms. Initially, extended peptide structures of sHVF18 were generated using in-house software. The initial structure was energy-minimized and equilibrated in a vacuum. For the amino acids constituting the stapled peptide, the amino acids were generated as separate non-natural amino acids and parametrized for GROMACS using ACPYPE59. After energy minimization, bond restraints were applied for the Ce of each amino acid of the staple and the covalent bondwas generated using inbuilt functions in GROMACS. Structure calculations were made using the GROMACS molecular dynamics suite60 using the AMBER99SB force field. Solvation of sHVF18 was done using 1594 water atoms with TIP3P topology. The charge of the systemwas set to zero by adding three chloride atoms to the system. The initial stapled peptide structure was prepared for structure calculations by energy minimization followed by short equilibration simulations at constant volume or pressure. Structure calculations were then performed in an iterative fashion, where 15 structures of the peptide were calculated using distance and dihedral angle restraints and then evaluated using the CCPNMR suite, where restraints were reassigned or removed. Restraints with correct assignment upper bond violations were iteratively recalibrated by applying a soft upper bond restraint. This was repeated until a converged structure ensemblewas reached, of which ten structures out of 60were chosen as a representative ensemble based on Ramachandran backbone dihedral angles, distance restraint violations and a converged backbone RMSD. The structure quality of the ensemble structure was evaluated using in-house software and the MolProbity software suite61.\nThe NMR data have been deposited to the wwPDB.

HDX-MS analysis was performed using automated sample preparation on a LEAP H/D-X PAL\u2122 platform interfaced to an LC-MS system, comprising anUltimate 3000micro-LC coupled to anOrbitrap Q Exactive Plus MS. The samples comprised recombinant deglycosylated CD14 (2.4mgmL\u22121) in 20mMTris, 100mMNaCl, 10% glycerol, at pH 7.5 with andwithout ligands, HVF18, sHVF18, LPS. The peptides and LPS were prepared fresh in milli-Q water using short cycles of ultrasonication. The interaction samples were prepared to have a molar ratio of 1:10 (CD14:ligands), assuming amolecularweight of 2.2 kDa for peptides and 10 kDa for LPS.\nUnbound/Apo state CD14 samples constituted 2 \u00b5L and 2 \u00b5LMilli-Q water and interaction analysis samples, 2 \u00b5L CD14 mixed with 2 \u00b5L ligand, samples were diluted with 26 \u00b5L 25mM Tris, pH(read) 7.5 or HDX labeling buffer of the same composition prepared in D2O, pH(read) 7.1. HDX labeling was carried out for t = 0, 30, 300, 3000 and 9000 s at 20 \u00b0C. The labeling reaction was quenched by dilution of 25 \u00b5L labeled sample with 30 \u00b5L of 1% TFA, 0.4M TCEP, 4M urea, pH 2.5 at 1 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b5L of the quenched sample was directly injected and subjected to online pepsindigestion at 4 \u00b0C (in-housemade immobilizedpepsin column, 2.1 \u00d7 30mm). The online digestion and trapping were performed for 4min using a flow of 50 \u00b5Lmin\u22121 0.1% formic acid, pH 2.5. The peptides generated by pepsin digestion were subjected to online SPE on a PepMap300 C18 trap column (1 \u00d7 15mm) andwashed with 0.1% FA for 60 s. Thereafter, the trap column was switched in line with a reversed-phase analytical column, Hypersil GOLD, particle size 1.9 \u00b5m, 1 \u00d7 50mm, and separation was performed at 1 \u00b0C using a gradient of 5\u201350% B over 8min, and then from50 to90%B for 5min, themobile phaseswere0.1% formic acid (A) and 95% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (B). Following the separation, the trap and column were equilibrated at 5% organic content until the next injection. The needle port and sample loop were cleaned three times after each injection with mobile phase 5%MeOH/ 0.1%FA, followed by 90% MeOH/0.1%FA and a final wash of 5%MeOH/ 0.1%FA. After each sample and blank injection, the pepsin column was washed by injecting 90 \u00b5L of pepsin wash solution 1% FA /4M urea /5% MeOH. A full blank was run between each sample injection. Separated peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus MS, equipped with a HESI source operated at a capillary temperature of 250 \u00b0Cwith sheath gas 12, Aux gas 2, and sweep gas 1 (au). Data-dependent MS/MS HCDwas used for the identification of pepsin-generated peptides. For HDX analysis, MS full scan spectra at a setting of 70K resolution, AGC 3e6, Max IT 200ms and scan range 300\u20132000 were collected."

Similar results were obtained as in our previous study, whereby the peptide binds favorably to the N-terminal pocket of CD1415. The structure of the top-scoring docking pose was selected as a template for model GKY25. The N-terminal GKYGFYT residues were modeled using Modeller version 9.21, and the model with the lowest discrete optimized protein energy score63 was chosen.\nThe GKY25-CD14 complex was solvated with TIP3P water and 0.15M NaCl salt using the CHARMM-GUI Solution Builder64. The steepest descent energy minimization and a 125 ps equilibration simulation, whereby positional restraints with force constant (Fc) of 400 kJmol\u22121 nm\u22122 were applied to the backbone atoms of the protein and peptide, was performed following the standard CHARMM-GUI protocols65. The final snapshot after equilibration was extracted, and the binding energy between GKY25 and CD14 was estimated using the Molecular mechanics Poisson\u2212Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method66. A hydrophobic staple was added to the GKY25 peptide by mutating residues at positions i and i + 3 to alanine and linking them with two pentene segments using the CHARMM-GUI Solution Builder64. The complex composed of GKY25 bound to CD14 was then subjected to the same solvation, minimization, and equilibration procedures as described above, after which their binding energies were determined using MMPBSA. A similar protocol was utilized for the addition of a staple at positions i and i + 4. The difference in binding energies to the non-stapled GKY25 was then calculated.\nMolecular dynamics simulation of CD14 and sHVF18 All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to understand the dynamics of sHVF18 binding to CD14. The starting coordinates for sHVF18 were obtained from NMR spectroscopy and further modeled using CHARMM-GUI Solution Builder1. The hydrophobic staple was added by mutating residues 10 and 14 to alanine and linking them with two pentene segments. To model the binding of sHVF18 to CD14, we performed an unbiased proteinprotein docking using the ClusPro web server7. No intermolecular\nrestraints were applied during the docking protocol. A total of 17 docking poses were generated, with 11 poses found at the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CD14 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), similar to our previous study8. These 11 poses were then subjected to a short MD simulation to test the stability of peptide binding. Peptide-bound CD14 was solvated with TIP3P water molecules, and 0.15 M NaCl salt was added to neutralize the system. Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent method, and a short 125 ps equilibration simulation, whereby positional restraints with Fc of 400 kJ mol\u22121 nm\u22122 were applied to the backbone atoms, was conducted following the standard CHARMM-GUI protocols9. A 200-ns MD simulation was performed for each pose using GROMACS 202110 and the CHARMM36m force field67. The temperature of the system was maintained at 310 K by coupling to the Nos\u00e9Hoover thermostat12,13, while the pressure was maintained at 1 atm by isotropic coupling to the Parrinello-Rahman barostat14. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to compute the electrostatic interactions, while the van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.2 nmwith a force switch function applied between 1.0 to 1.2 nm. All covalent bonds with hydrogen atomswere constrained using the LINCS algorithm15, and a 2 fs integration time step was used.\nWe then determined whether sHVF18 remained bound to CD14 in each predicted binding pose by calculating the minimum distance between the peptide and the protein (Supplementary Fig. 14b). To determine the most probable binding pose, we concatenated all 11 simulation trajectories, and performed clustering analysis using the GROMOS method with an RMSD cut-off of 0.4 nm. The central structure of themost populated cluster (representing around 90% of the trajectories) was selected for further MD simulations. Three independent 1-\u00b5s simulations with different initial velocities were performed for this structure using the same protocol described above. As a control, three independent 1 \u00b5s simulations of CD14 without the bound sHVF18 peptide were conducted using the same protocols.\nMolecular dynamics simulation of lipid A and Ra LPS with sHVF18 A multiscale MD simulation approach was used to understand how sHVF18 interacts with LPS via its lipid A anchor. The NMR structure of sHVF18 was converted to coarse-grained (CG) representation using theMARTINI 2.2 force field with an elastic network using the standard ElNeDYn parameters applied to maintain the secondary and tertiary structures.16 The hydrophobic staple was introduced via two additional beads linking the backbonebeads of residues 10 and 14. TheCG parameters were validated by comparing the average distances between the backbone beads of all residues to equivalent distances of C\u03b1 atoms from atomistic simulations of the peptide in solution (Supplementary Fig. 24). A large lipid A aggregate was generated by randomly placing 60 lipid A molecules into solution and allowing them to self-assemble during a 1 \u00b5s simulation. As divalent cations are required to cross-link the phosphate head groups of adjacent lipid A molecules, neutralizing Ca2+ ions was included in the simulation. The Ca2+ bound lipid A aggregate from the end of this simulation was then positioned inside a larger box, whereby 30 copies of the sHVF18 peptides were added at a minimum distance of 2 nm away from the surface of the lipid aggregate. The system was re-solvated with standard MARTINI water particles and neutralized with an additional 0.15M NaCl salt. Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent method. A 50 ns equilibration simulation was conducted whereby positional restraints with force constants of 1000 kJmol\u22121 nm\u22122 and 500 kJmol\u22121 nm\u22122 were applied to the peptide backbone and to lipid A, respectively. Three independent 10 \u00b5s production runs were then conducted. The temperature was maintained at 310 K using the velocity-rescaling thermostat17, while the pressure\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6097 15\nwas maintained at 1 atm by isotropic coupling to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat. Electrostatic interactions were computed using the reaction field method, while the van der Waals interactions were truncated using the potential shift Verlet scheme, with a 1.1 nm short-range cutoff applied to both. A 10-fs integration time step was used for the CG simulations.\nWe repeated our CG simulation with E. coli rough Ra LPS molecules (lipid A plus 10 core sugars). We placed 60 copies of Ra LPS molecules randomly into solution and allowed it to self-assemble into a large LPS aggregate during a 1 \u00b5s simulation. Similar to our lipid A simulations, Ca2+ ions were included in the system to intercalate between LPS headgroups. The Ca2+-bound LPS aggregate was extracted from the end of the simulation and 30 copies of sHVF18 were added at least 2 nm from the surface of the lipid aggregate. The system underwent the same solvation, energy minimization and equilibration protocols as described above for sHVF18 simulations with lipid A. Similarly, three independent 10 \u00b5s production simulations were performed.\nTo validate the results from our CG simulations, we performed atomistic simulations of a similar lipidA-peptide system.A small lipid A aggregate was generated by placing 12 lipids A molecules in solution and running a 200ns simulation to allow them to self-assemble. The coordinates and parameters for E. coli lipid A were obtained from the CHARMM-GUI9. Similar to the CG system, divalent Ca2+ ions were added. The Ca2+ bound lipid A aggregate was then extracted from the final snapshot of the simulation, and a single sHVF18 peptide was placed ~2 nm from the surface of the lipid aggregate. The system was re-solvated with TIP3P water molecules and neutralized with 0.15M NaCl salt. Energy minimization, equilibration and production runs were performed using the parameters described above for atomistic simulations of the CD14-peptide complex, except that the peptide was not subject to distance and dihedral angle restraints in these simulations to avoid further bias. Three independent replicates of 1 \u00b5s production simulations were conducted. Simulations were visualized using VMD18, and analyses of trajectories were performed using GROMACS 202110."

The tidal volume (Vt) was kept at 6\u20138mLkg\u22121. The Eq. (2) was used to determine the dynamic compliance.\nCdyn = VT\n\u00f0peakpressure PEEP\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nFurther, an arterial line (Secalon-TTM, Merit Medical Ireland Ltd, Galway, Ireland) was inserted in the right common carotid artery. A pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo V and Introflex, Edwards Lifesciences Services GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany) was placed in the right internal jugular vein.\nTo induce an ARDS according to the Berlin criteria40 E. coli LPS (O111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used intravenously, as previously described38,39. Prior to administration, LPS was diluted in saline solution (2 \u00b5g kg\u22121 min\u22121). As a result of the LPS administration, all animals developed hemodynamic instability and required continuous inotropic support, provided as an infusion of norepinephrine (40 \u00b5gmL\u22121, 0.05\u20132 \u00b5g kg\u22121min\u22121; PfizerAB, Sollentuna, Sweden) and dobutamine (2mgmL\u22121, 2.5\u20135 \u00b5g kg\u22121 min\u22121; Hameln Pharma Plus GmbH, Hameln, Germany). Ringer\u2019s acetate (Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden) was used to compensate for fluid loss. The different ARDS stages were defined based on themeasured PaO2 FiO2 \u22121 ratio, according to the Berlin definition of ARDS40: Mild ARDS for a ratio between 201\u2013300mmHg, moderate ARDS for a ratio between 101\u2013200mmHg, and severe ARDS for a ratio \u2264100mmHg. The ARDS\nstate was considered as confirmed when two separate arterial blood gasmeasurements, taken within a 15-min interval, fell within the Berlin definition\u2019s PaO2 FiO2\n\u22121 range. In the treated cohort, each animal received two intravenous doses of sHVF18 solution (12mg in 50mL) over the course of 30min, administrated using the central venous catheter in the superior vena cava. Three hours was the predetermined endpoint; if any animal died before this endpoint, the last observed time point was considered the endpoint for the data analysis.\nArterial blood gas analysis in pigs Arterial blood from pigs was collected every 30min and analyzed with an ABL 90 FLEX blood gas analyzer (Radiometer Medical ApS, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Denmark). According to clinical standards, the measurements were normalized to a blood temperature of 37 \u00b0C."
