    "abstractText": "Understanding how crystallographic orientation influences the electrocatalytic performance of metal catalysts can potentially advance the design of catalysts with improved efficiency. Although single crystal electrodes are typically used for such studies, the one-at-a-time preparation procedure limits the range of secondary crystallographic orientations that can be profiled. This work employs scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) together with co-located electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a screening technique to investigate how surface crystallographic orientations on polycrystalline copper (Cu) correlate to activity under CO2 electroreduction conditions. SECCM measures spatially resolved voltammetry on polycrystalline copper covering low overpotentials of CO2 conversion to intermediates, thereby screening the different activity from low-index facets where H2 evolution is dominant to high-index facets where more reaction intermediates are expected. This approach allows the acquisition of 2500 voltammograms on approximately 60 different Cu surface facets identified with EBSD. The results show that the order of activity is (111) < (100) < (110) among the Cu primary orientations. The collection of data over a wide range of secondary orientations leads to the construction of an \u201celectrochemical\u2212crystallographic stereographic triangle\u201d that provides a broad comprehension of the trends among Cu secondary surface facets rarely studied in the literature, [particularly (941) and (741)], and clearly shows that the electroreduction activity scales with the step and kink density of these surfaces. This work also reveals that the electrochemical stripping of the passive layer that is naturally formed on Cu in air is strongly grain-dependent, and the relative ease of stripping on low-index facets follows the order of (100) > (111) > (110). This allows a procedure to be implemented, whereby the oxide is removed (to an electrochemically undetectable level) prior to the kinetic analyses of electroreduction activity. SECCM screening allows for the most active surfaces to be ranked and prompts in-depth follow-up studies.",

Consequently, the eCO2RR activity trends among the numerous high-index Cu crystals that exist on real catalysts remain to be fully explored. Single crystal studies have produced activity and selectivity trends for Cu grain indexes, albeit with notable disparity.16\u221219\nMoreover, recent reports evidence effects of electrode preparation,19 pH,20 electrolyte species,21 and in situ morphological dynamics22,23 on eCO2RR.

To rapidly access the electrochemical characteristics of a wide variety of crystallographic sites, we introduced \u201cpseudosingle crystal\u201d electrochemistry,24 using high-resolution scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM)25\u221227 to map out the voltammetry (with several thousand spatially resolved voltammograms easily achievable)28,29 on a polycrystalline surface, whose crystallographic structure is determined by colocated electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). In this way, electrochemical analysis of multiple crystallographic orientations and grain boundaries, found on a polycrystalline metal surface, is achieved30,31 as demonstrated by studies of an increasing diversity of systems.24,28,32\u221238 Recent studies have used the combination of SECCM and EBSD to resolve CO2 electroreduction activity at grain boundaries of Au,39\u221241 and SECCM alone has been used to study CO2 electroreduction at tin/reduced graphene oxide interfaces.42\nIn this work, we employed hopping-mode voltammetric SECCM28 to collect spatially resolved linear sweep voltammograms in aqueous KHCO3 on polycrystalline copper, under typical eCO2RR conditions, with each measurement localized to a \u223c 600 nm-wide spot (defined by the diameter of the SECCM droplet cell). The potential range studied herein is dominated by the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on Cu lowindex facets7,19 but may include eCO2RR intermediates on the stepped and kinked high-index facets.4,19,43 The original studies of Hori1 and later computational studies44 propose a correlation between the onset potential at 5 mA cm\u22122 on different Cu surfaces and their performance for producing CH4. The current density is in the range of the SECCM studies, so local voltammetric analyses serve as a preliminary indicator of eCO2RR activity. As part of our study, we also provide a local electrochemical assay of the naturally formed (upon ambient air exposure) adlayer on different Cu facets. The SECCM configuration is particularly attractive for this analysis as it presents a way to acquire voltammetric measurements immediately after the electrolyte droplet has contacted the Cu surface, which allows analysis of the surface oxide close to the initial state. We then advance protocols to remove the surface oxide at each pixel in the SECCM scan in order to study the electrocatalytic activity at clean Cu surfaces. The considerable amount of data acquired with SECCM (up to 2500 LSVs over about 60 different grains in a single map) enabled the construction of \u201celectrochemical stereographic triangles\u201d32 in which electrocatalytic activity of individual grains is presented with respect to their crystallographic orientations, on a 2D projection which is qualitatively similar to an inverse pole figure (IPF) representation, thereby offering a holistic view of structure\u2212activity that reveals insightful trends across the low-index grains and many high-index crystallographic orientations. This study serves to demonstrate the use of pseudo-single crystal SECCM\u2212EBSD for screening and identifying promising surface features on an electrocatalyst for further investigation.\n\u25a0 MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of the Working Electrode and Chemical Reagents. The working electrode/substrate was prepared by embedding a polycrystalline Cu foil (3 mm thickness, size 10 \u00d7 10 mm, Goodfellow, U.K., 99.95%) in a circular carbon block with a hot compression mounting machine (SimpliMet,\nBuehler, USA). The exposed Cu surface was then polished using an AutoMet 300 polishing machine (Buehler, USA), on polishing pads (ChemoMet and TexMat C, Buehler, USA) with 9, 3, and 0.06 \u03bcm polishing suspensions (MetaDi Supreme Diamond and MasterMet colloidal silica suspension, Buehler, USA). In order to remove minor surface deformation after\nmechanical polishing and to prepare a high-quality flat surface for electrochemical measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the polycrystalline Cu sample was subjected to vibratory polishing in a non-crystallizing colloidal silica polishing suspension (MasterMet 2, Buehler, USA) at ca. 70% vibration amplitude using a VibroMet 2 instrument (Buehler, USA). The polished Cu substrate was then washed with soapy water, followed by rinsing with a copious amount of deionized water and isopropanol to remove the polishing suspension, before being blown dry with argon. The last stage of the sample preparation for the SECCM experiments was surface cleaning with broad Ar+ ion beam milling (IM4000Plus, HITACHI, Japan). Between experiments, the polycrystalline Cu substrate was stored in a desiccator equipped with a vacuum pump at room temperature (22 \u00b0C). Potassium chloride (KCl, Honeywell, 99.5%) and potassium\nbicarbonate (KHCO3, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) were used as supplied by the manufacturer. All solutions were prepared with deionized water (ELGA PURELAB systems; resistivity = 18.2 M\u03a9 cm at 25 \u00b0C).\nNanopipettes, Electrolytes, and Quasi-Reference Counter Electrodes. Nanopipettes were fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (GC120F-10, Harvard Apparatus; capillary dimensions: outer diameter, 1.2 mm; inner diameter, 0.69 mm; and length, 100 mm) with a CO2 laser puller (Sutter Instruments P-2000). The pulling parameters were as follows: line 1 with HEAT 330, FIL 3, VEL 30, DEL 220, and PUL\u2212 and line 2 with HEAT 330, FIL 3, VEL 40, DEL 180, and PUL 120. The nanopipette tip opening was \u223c200 nm in diameter.40 The nanopipette probe was filled with the 10 mM KHCO3 electrolyte, and a silicone oil layer was added on the top of the electrolyte solution in the tip to minimize evaporation from the back during prolonged scanning.45 Note that the pH of the electrolyte solution was 5.77 when saturated with CO2 and 8.04 when purged with Ar. AgCl-coated Ag wire was used as a quasi-reference counter electrode (QRCE), which was fabricated by electrochemically oxidizing Ag wire (0.125 mm diameter) in saturated KCl solution.46 The QRCE was calibrated routinely (before and after the SECCM measurements) in 10 mM KHCO3 with respect to a commercial leakless Ag/AgCl electrode (3.4 M KCl, ET072, eDAQ, Australia), resulting in a stable potential of +215 \u00b1 5 mV compared to the standard. Hence, all electrochemical results in this work are presented versus Ag/AgCl (3.4 M KCl), referred to as Ag/AgCl. The prepared QRCE was inserted in the back of the nanopipette and positioned ca. 3\u22124 cm away from the tip end.46\nScanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy. A homebuilt SECCM workstation was used for all the SECCM experiments, as detailed in previous studies29,47,48 and discussed in brief below. The nanopipette probe was mounted on the z-piezoelectric stage [P-753.2 LISA, Physik Instrumente (PI), Germany] and moved into the initial position using xymicropositioners (M-461-XYZ-M, Newport, US) and a stepper motor (8303 Picomotor Actuator, Newport, US).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6579\nThe sample was positioned at the center of a plastic environmental cell49 that allowed atmospheric control (CO2 or argon) (Figure 1A). The cell was made from a 6.5 cm-wide polypropylene air-tight container (HPL 931, Lock & Lock, South Korea) with 100 cm3 volume. A gas inlet port was made on the side of this cell by fitting a two-way Omnifit connector (Kinesis, UK) into a drilled hole with epoxy seal (SigmaAldrich, UK). CO2 or Ar was humidified to \u223c60% relative humidity by continuously flowing (80 mL min\u22121) through deionized water in a threaded midget bubbler (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). The humified gas was delivered to the inlet channel via tetrafluoroethylene tubing. As the gas flux was maintained, the cell of 100 cm3 volume should be theoretically filled in <2 min if airtight. However, the cell was purged for an ample time of 1 h prior to the experiment to ensure efficient saturation of the cell, and the flow was maintained throughout the experiment. With the cell saturated, saturation of the nanodroplet is facilitated by the short diffusion path (the radius of the nanodroplet is \u2248300 nm, vide inf ra) for the gas species. A ca. 10 mm-wide hole in the lid of the environmental jacket allowed translation of the tip to the appropriate position on the polycrystalline sample and gas outflow. Part of the cell lid was cut out and replaced with a 30 mm-diameter circular cover\nglass (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) and sealed in place, to enable visualization of the tip position in the area of interest on the Cu surface with a high-resolution optical camera (Pixelink, US; CompactTL 8\u00d7 telecentric lenses, Edmund Optics, UK). Further details can be found elsewhere.49 The entire environmental cell was mounted on the x\u2212y piezoelectric positioner (P-733.2 XY, PI, Germany). All instrumentation used for tip positioning and current amplification was enclosed within an aluminum Faraday cage, equipped with vacuum-sealed panels (Kevothermal) and aluminum heat sinks, to minimize electrical and mechanical noise and maintain thermal equilibrium during SECCM scanning. The entire setup was placed on an optical breadboard with an active vibration isolation frame (PBI52515, PFA51507, Thorlabs, UK). SECCM was deployed in the scan hopping mode,28,29 as shown in Figure 1B, to acquire spatially resolved linear sweep voltammograms on polycrystalline Cu. The hopping mode allowed for a point-by-point interrogation of the Cu substrate at an array of pre-defined locations within a grid. The potential, Eapp, was applied at the QRCE in the SECCM probe with respect to ground, and the current (isurf) flowing at the substrate at ground was measured using a home-built\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6580\nelectrometer. The substrate was thus at a potential Esurf = \u2212Eapp versus the QRCE in the tip. The voltammetric protocol is illustrated in Figure 1C\u2212E: (i) The tip was translated to the surface with Esurf held at \u22120.5 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.4 M KCl), which was carefully chosen to avoid the initiation of eCO2RR or other reduction/ oxidation,50,51 including HER.52 A current change of 1.2 pA was used as a feedback parameter for stopping the nanopipette approach (i.e., meniscus contact). (ii) Esurf was then immediately stepped to \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl and held at that potential for 150 ms. As discussed later, the reduction pulse served to reduce the native surface oxides and hydroxides on the Cu surface.53 (iii) An LSV measurement was immediately recorded by sweeping Esurf from \u22120.5 to \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl (sweep rate \u03c5 = 1 V s\u22121). Lastly, (iv) the tip was withdrawn from the surface and moved to the next scan position (Figure 1B). The tip position was recorded synchronously during the whole scan and used to generate a complementary topographical map, from the z position at each of the meniscus contact coordinates. Figure 1F shows that LSV collected with the pulse protocol incorporated does not show features associated with the native oxide layer on Cu. The substrate current, isurf, was measured every 4 \u03bcs, averaged 257 times, to give a data acquisition rate of 1028 \u03bcs per point. Data acquisition and instrument control were carried out with an FPGA card (PCIe-7852R) controlled by a LabVIEW 2016 interface (National Instruments, USA) running on Warwick electrochemical scanning probe microscopy (WEC-SPM) software (www.warwick.ac.uk/ electrochemistry/wec-spm). The droplet footprint was imaged with field emission SEM (FE-SEM) after scanning, and the dimensions of the wetted areas (geometric areas of the \u201ceffective\u201d working electrode) were used to normalize the current measurements such that voltammograms, maps, and movies could be presented as current density, mA cm\u22122.\nElectron Backscatter Diffraction. EBSD measurements were performed on the samples after SECCM analysis. A Zeiss SIGMA FE-SEM instrument (Zeiss, Germany) with a Nordlys EBSD detector (Oxford Instruments, U.K.) was used. EBSD images were collected at 20 keV accelerating voltage, with the sample tilted at 70\u00b0 to the detector. Note that the penetration depth is typically \u223c70 nm on Cu for the acceleration voltage employed in this work.54 Therefore, activity correlations in this work are with the \u201cbulk\u201d orientation of the grains, which we consider to be reasonable for the ex situ evaluation of the postcatalyst structure, noting that Cu electrocatalysts are expected to be dynamic during eCO2RR.22,23 The znormal direction IPF (IPFz) color maps were extracted from AZtech software linked with the instrument controls (AZtech, Oxford Instruments, UK). Following EBSD characterization, the AZtechICE software package (Oxford Instruments, UK) and Tango program in CHANNEL 5 software (Oxford Instruments HKL, Denmark) were used to interrogate the acquired EBSD data to extract the grain boundary lines and average grain parameters (e.g., the Euler angles for deriving the average Miller indexes) of grains that were relevant for correlation with SECCM data.\n\u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Electroreduction Activity Versus Crystallographic Orientation among Low-Index Facets. We consider the onset potential region (from \u22120.5 to \u22121.05 V vs Ag/AgCl) where on low-index Cu facets, HER is dominant, while the products HCOO\u2212 and CO account for less than 2% of the current density.43,53,55 Recent work evidences that only HER was observed on Cu(100) single crystals until steps and defects were incorporated.19 Thus, initial consideration of only lowindex facets allows us to test and confirm the SECCM screening method.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6581\nFigure 2 presents the results of an SECCM scan (100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm area) on polycrystalline Cu, acquired under a CO2saturated atmosphere with a 200 nm-diameter nanopipette probe filled with the 10 mM KHCO3 electrolyte. The pulseLSV scanning protocol discussed in the Materials and Methods section was used. Each pixel therefore contains an LSV measurement made by sweeping the surface potential from \u22120.5 to \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl at a voltammetric scan rate of 2 V s\u22121, compiled as a sequence of equipotential surface current density maps for the entire potential range from \u22120.5 to \u22121.05 V (268 frames) provided in Supporting Information, Movie S1. From the current density map at Esurf = \u22121.05 V (Figure 2A), clear and consistent grain-to-grain contrast can be observed. The activity reflects closely the crystallographic orientation shown by the IPFz color map from the EBSD analysis in Figure 2B. The SEM image (Supporting Information, Figure S1B), collected alongside the EBSD map, shows that the droplet footprints are uniform (with mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the diameter = 605 \u00b1 61 nm). Topography maps obtained synchronously with the SECCM measurements (Supporting Information, Figure S1C,D) indicate an overall variation of topography of the order of tens of nanometers, which is on the scale expected from the dimension of the suspension employed in the last stage of the polishing procedure (0.06 \u03bcm), as described in the Materials and Methods section (vide supra). The substantial difference in electroreduction activity among the low-index grains, herein\ndefined as the grains within 10\u00b0 of the projection coordinates33\n(vide inf ra) of (100), (110), and (111) orientations, is clear from the average linear sweep voltammograms in Figure 2C and the bar chart in Figure 2D. The selection of these grains is discussed in the next section. Also, the precise Euler angles, hkl indexes, and measures of deviation from the ideal low-index poles are supplied in Supporting Information, Table S1A, line 1\u22123. The eCO2RR activity for the low-index planes is in the order of (110) > (100) > (111) (Figure 2D), with values of current density at Esurf = \u22121.05 V of 4.49 \u00b1 0.21, 3.00 \u00b1 0.68, and 2.15 \u00b1 0.13 mA cm\u22122, respectively. As the overwhelmingly dominant reaction is HER, the trend of activity in neutral/ alkaline media can be considered to be a subtle balance between the hydrogen binding energy and the energetics of water dissociation.52,56\u221258 The order of the reported adsorption energies of H on preferred sites on low-index Cu facets using a six-slab model59 agrees with the order of electroreduction activity of Cu(110) > (100) > (111) in accordance with the position of Cu on the ascending side of the volcano plot (Figure 2C, D). On the basis of water dissociation, the decreasing order of water dissociation activity on clean low-index Cu facets is (110) > (100) > (111),60 with Cu(110) having the lowest activation energy barrier among the low-index facets.52,60\u221262\nElectroreduction Activity Versus Grain Orientation among High-Index Facets.We now extend our data analysis to secondary orientations within the SECCM scan area in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6582\nFigure 2, where there are approximately 60 different grains identified at the spatial scale of EBSD. Compared to low-index facets, there is an increased proportion of eCO2RR intermediates on high-index facets in the onset potential region, which is robustly justified by computational44 and experimental63 reports and is consistent throughout the literature.2,7,44,53,64\u221266\nTo visualize differences in orientation between such grains, a two-dimensional projection was employed, representing the grains with a conformation analogous to the IPFz. Full details of the method development and calculation are published elsewhere.32 Data from Figure 2A are plotted in Figure 3, according to the surface crystallography, with the low-index grains in the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal system, (100), (110), and (111), discussed in the previous section, shown, respectively, in red, green, and blue in the corners of the plot. The average Euler angles, hkl index, coordinates on the twodimensional projection, electroreduction current density, and number of linear sweep voltammograms collected on each grain with SECCM are detailed in Supporting Information, Section S4, Table S1. Figure 3 is essentially a scatter plot in which each point represents average electroreduction activity at individual grains. The x\u2212y coordinate of each point corresponds to the crystal orientation, the size is determined by the number of LSV measurements (pixels) collected on the grain, and the color of the point scales with electrochemical\nactivity, that is, the measured current density at E = \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl. A significant observation in Figure 3 is that grains within 5\u00b0 deviation from the low-index poles(100) and (111), especiallyshow comparable electroreduction activity to the nearby low-index orientation. Outside of these regions, much larger electroreduction current densities are generally recorded on the high-index orientations. In a control scan, collected under Ar, where the reaction is restricted to the HER (Supporting Information, Figure S2, Movie S2, and Table S1B), less current was observed on the secondary facets within the triangular projection compared to surfaces closer to the (100) and (111) poles (see further details in Supporting Information, section S6). The latter two orientations had the lowest activity of all the surfaces assessed under CO2. Note further that the points on the bisection line in Figure S2 have the lowest activity, whereas under eCO2RR conditions, this is the region of the highest activity. Also, the overall lower current density observed in the CO2 scan (<10 mA cm\n\u22122, Figure 3) compared to Ar (up to 20 mA cm\u22122, Figure S2) is due to the inhibition of HER in CO2 atmospheres.\n63,67 Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the trend observed under CO2 for the high-index facets shown in Figure 3 is mainly attributable to the generation of eCO2RR products in line with the original work of Hori68 and more recent work, which has shown that such high-index structures can readily\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6583\ntransform in operando to produce highly active stepped surfaces.19 As emphasized below, a key feature of the SECCM screening method is the possibility of assessing unusual surface indexes present on polycrystalline Cu which have not been assessed before. The inset of Figure 3 also established the correlation of the\nmeasured electroreduction current density with the density of broken bonds estimated for the grains in the triangular projection. See Section S5 of the Supporting Information for the details of the calculation. To delve more deeply into the surface structure\u2212electrochemical activity, we identified significant points on the plot (each marked with a circle) and associated them with corresponding model crystal structures (shown in brackets beside the selected point), as displayed in Figure 4. Figure 4A shows the measured electroreduction current density of the grains between (100) and (111), which are characterized by Miller indices (m11), where 1 < m. Upon transiting from (111) toward (100), first, an increasing number of (100) steps are added to the (111) terraces.1,4,69 This holds up to (311), after which the structure inverts, and (111) steps on (100) terraces are observed.69\nElectroreduction activity can be seen to rise with increasing (111)-step density, that is, from (100) to (511) and also with increasing (100)-step density: from (111) to (522). This suggests that the most stepped high-index grains are most active for electroreduction. Specifically, Cu(511), which is\nidentified as the orientation with the highest reduction current density on this path (Figure 4A), has one (111) step every three atoms along the (100) terrace {i.e., analogous to Cu[S][3 (100) \u00d7 (111)]}. Interestingly, Cu(511) is about 50% more active than its counterpart, Cu(211), which has similar step density but with (100) steps on (111) terraces {i.e., Cu[S][3 (111) \u00d7 (100)]}. This suggests that (100) steps are more active compared to (111) steps. This trend is consistent with the variation in electrode potential and C2 product yield in current-controlled experiments at \u22125 mA cm\u22122 current density in a series of single crystal electrodes.68\nIn Figure 4B, the trend of activity from (100) to (110), with Miller indices (0n1), where 0 < 1 < n, is presented. Upon moving from (100) toward (110), steps of (110) are gradually added to the (100) terraces. This (110) step is unique as it is composed of kinks, unlike steps of (111) and (100), up to a maximum kink density of the (210) surface.4,68,69 Electroreduction activity can be seen to increase in the same manner as described above. In contrast, structures between (210) and (110) have (100) steps and (110) terraces. Cu(740) is in this category and is where we observed the highest electroreduction current density within the grain selection considered. For all three boundary axes, the two contributing low-index planes have the lowest activity, except for orientations on the (111)\u2212(110) axis for which (110) is most active. We deduce that enhanced electroreduction activity is observed at high-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6584\nindex facets and scales with the step density and surface roughness. The grains with the overall highest electroreduction current density are Cu(941) and Cu(741) (identified with blue circles in Figure 3), which are about 7\u22128\u00b0 shifted from the middle of the (100)\u2212(110) axis toward the center of the triangle. A dashed line that originates from (100) and bisects the (111)\u2212 (110) axis at point (441) is drawn on the grain orientation projection in Figure 3. With reference to Figure 4C, starting from the stepped (441) index, the kink density increases gradually along this line such that the points in the middle of the stereographic triangle, in the vicinity of (741) and (941) orientations, present complex atomic arrangements.69 The 3D rigid ball models of the two orientations show the most closely packed arrangement of the kink atoms. Further along the zone axis, the surface becomes smoother, approaching the (100) surface. Thus, introducing kinks to stepped surfaces is critical to their catalytic performance, in agreement with a previous report on eCO2RR for a series of high-index single crystal platinum electrodes.70 Interestingly, Cu surfaces similar to (741) and (941) have received little attention in experimental and density functional theory studies, although the data presented herein suggest that they are worthy of further analysis as high-activity surfaces. Fingerprinting the Native Surface Layer on Polycrystalline Cu with Voltammetric SECCM. In this section, we clarify the importance of the pulse phase in the SECCM protocol detailed in the Materials and Methods section for stripping the native passive layer on the Cu surface. This work also illustrates how SECCM can be used to assay the electrochemical properties of surface layers on electrodes. Presented in Figure 5 are the results of a 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm2 SECCM LSV scan in a CO2 environmental cell for which the potential pulse phase was omitted. Figure 5A shows isurf at Esurf = \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl, taken from a potentiodynamic movie for the entire potential range of Esurf = \u22120.45 to \u22121.05 V versus Ag/AgCl (Supporting Information, Movie S3). A corresponding co-located EBSD map is presented in Figure 5B. By comparing Figure 5A with Figure 5B, surface grain dependency of the electrochemical response is evidenced. Figure 5C shows the average linear sweep voltammograms (N = 13, 78, and 39) selected from the grains closest to the primary low-index orientations, (100), (111), and (110), marked as i, ii, and iii, respectively, in Figure 5A,B. It is clear from Figure 5C that the entire voltammetric profiles are unique for each low-index grain. Distinct reduction peaks attributable to the stripping of the native hydroxide layer of Cu (vide infra) are observed on the linear sweep voltammograms for Cu(100) and Cu(111) at \u22120.78 and \u22120.88 V versus Ag/ AgCl, respectively (Figure 5C,D). However, a reduction peak is not observed on grain (110); the reduction current density magnitude continues to increase within the potential range studied. This is because the potential region for native hydroxide stripping on Cu(110) overlaps with the voltammetric onset of CO2 reduction/hydrogen evolution.\n12,71 The grain dependency of the peak position is consistent for the whole scan and can be supported by maps of the peak potential (Figure 5E) and crystallographic orientations obtained from EBSD (Figure 5B). To further understand the reduction, we studied the native layer stripping in an argon atmosphere with four sequential cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles at a single point on the Cu surface (Figure 6).33 In the first cycle, a characteristic\nreduction peak at \u22120.78 V was observed, similar to the average curve on Cu(100) (Figure 5C). On the second and subsequent cycles, the reduction peak disappeared, and (quasi)reversible Cu surface redox processes occurred between \u22120.25 and \u22120.40 V.12 This rules out the possible correlation of the reduction peak at \u22120.78 V with reduction processes of electrochemically formed CuO and Cu2O. Moreover, the reduction peak at \u22120.78 V is related to the initial state of the surface rather than a reversible adsorption/desorption of electrolyte species (e.g., HCO3 \u2212, SO4 2\u2212, etc.).11,72,73 It is also noteworthy that the peak is observed in a CO2 (Figure 5) and argon (Figure 6) environment. The reduction process from \u22120.78 to \u22120.88 V has been\nidentified as the reduction of soluble precursors, namely, Cu(OH)2, on Cu surfaces.\n53,74\u221276 Cu(OH)2, together with Cu2O and CuO, is the product of native oxidation of Cu in an ambient atmosphere.51 Up to 2.5 nm-thick Cu2O and Cu(OH)2 can be formed on Cu surfaces within 1 h when exposed to ambient air, while CuO formation is much slower.51 The charge density of the peak in the first CV cycle in Figure 6 is about 657 \u03bcC cm\u22122 which corresponds to \u223cfew monolayers of the native oxide. The presence of Cu(OH)2 on as-prepared Cu and its removal by electrochemical reduction potential were further corroborated with Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement (See Supporting Information, Section S7). As seen from the results of Figure 6 and the surface\ncomposition characterization, the maps shown in Figure 5 reveal the crystallographic orientation dependence of the reduction potential of the native Cu(OH)2 adlayer on lowindex Cu surfaces: (100) > (111) > (110). The surface oxides are removed at potentials more positive than the onset of HER and eCO2RR on Cu, especially on Cu(100) and Cu(111). There is debate as to whether the product selectivity for eCO2RR reduction (at more negative potentials than in this work) is from participation of remnant oxide species16,77 or from structural/morphological transformations that accompany the reduction of the oxide layers.17,53,78 Our electrochemical results lend credence to the latter hypothesis, as the oxide signal is not observed after the first cycle. If the oxide does remain, it is at an electrochemically undetectable level.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650 ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 6578\u22126588\n6585\n\u25a0 CONCLUSIONS We have implemented a pseudo-single crystal screening approach, engaging co-located voltammetric SECCM and EBSD, to reveal surface structure\u2212activity correlations for eCO2RR at multiple sites across a polycrystalline Cu surface. Focusing on the onset potential region, we observed the activity trend to be (111) < (100) < (110) among the lowindex facets, under CO2 electroreduction conditions. However, product analysis from past studies suggests that H2 evolution is the dominant process on the primary orientations of Cu. For high-index facets, eCO2RR is more significant, and analyses of ca. 60 different grains across the secondary orientations, collectively visualized on a stereographic triangle, unambiguously reveal that the density and nature of steps and kinks introduced to the Cu catalyst surface are critical to achieving enhanced eCO2RR activity. The electroreduction current scales with the density of broken bonds of the surfaces. The overall activity trend is as follows: (111) < (100) < Cu(S)[n (111) \u00d7 (111)] < (110) < Cu(S)[n (111) \u00d7 (100)] < Cu(S)[n (100) \u00d7 (111)] < Cu(S)[n (100) \u00d7 (110)] < Cu(S)[n (441) \u00d7 (100)]. The most active orientations among the grains studied in this work are Cu(941) and Cu(741), which are highly kinked step surfaces located in the middle of the stereographic triangle. These Cu(941) and Cu(741) surfaces, derived from stepped Cu(441)a member of the Cu(S)[n (111) \u00d7 (111)] category and rarely studied for electroreduction performance, may be crucial to achieving improved electroreduction activity on Cu and are worth further study. Lastly, the electrochemical stripping of the native Cu(OH)2 passive layer was shown to be facet-controlled, and the order of relative ease of stripping from easiest is (100) > (111) > (110). This fingerprinting phenomenon further presents evidence of the important role played by crystallographic facets in the electrochemical behavior of Cu electrocatalysts. Altogether, this study enables the screening and analysis of a large number of surface structures, identifying candidate surfaces for further study and providing information that could be used to aid the rational design of improved catalysts for CO2 reduction. This study motivates a broader exploration of structural engineering as a method to improve electrocatalytic performance. A further direction will be the implementation of on-line product analysis and instrumental coupling of SECCM with in situ surface spectroscopy techniques to enable selectivity measurements in the study of complex reaction systems like eCO2RR.\n\u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT *s\u0131 Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c01650.\nAdditional methods; electrochemical movie captions; SEM images and SECCM topography maps of areas scanned with SECCM; hkl detail of grains in SECCM scan area: estimation of density of broken bonds; results of the SECCM scan under argon; XPS results; and SI references (PDF) Electrochemical movie for the eCO2RR scan in a CO2purged environmental cell (AVI) Electrochemical movie for the HER scan in a Ar-purged environmental cell (AVI) Electrochemical movie for native adlayer stripping (AVI)\n\u25a0 AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Authors\nMinkyung Kang \u2212 Institute for Frontier Materials Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria 3125, Australia; Email: m.kang@deakin.edu.au Patrick R.
