    "abstractText": "We study an asymmetric dark matter model with self-interacting dark matter consisting of a Dirac fermion \u03c7 coupled to a scalar or vector mediator, such that the reaction \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 is well described by perturbation theory. We compute the scattering cross section \u03c3, the transfer cross section \u03c3T , and the viscosity cross section \u03c3V for this reaction. As one part of our study, we give analytic and numerical comparisons of results obtained with the inclusion of both t-channel and u-channel exchanges and results obtained in an approximation that has often been used in the literature that includes only the t-channel contribution. The velocity dependences of these cross sections are studied in detail and shown to be in accord with observational data.",

INTRODUCTION\nThere is compelling evidence for dark matter (DM), comprising about 85% of the matter in the Universe. Cold dark matter (CDM) has been shown to account for the observed properties of large-scale structure on distance scales larger than \u223c10 Mpc [1\u20137]1,2 (reviews include [8\u201313].) Some possible problems with fitting observational data on length scales of \u223c1\u201310 kpc were noticed with early CDM simulations that lacked baryon feedback [14\u201316]. These included the prediction of greater density in the central region of galaxies than was observed (the core-cusp problem), a greater number of dwarf satellite galaxies than were seen (the missing satellite problem), and the so-called \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem pertaining to star formation in dwarf satellite galaxies. This led to the consideration of models in which dark matter particles have significant selfinteractions. The extension of cold dark matter N-body simulations to include baryon feedback can ameliorate\nthese problems with pure CDM simulations [17\u201328]. Nevertheless, cosmological models with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) are of considerable interest in their own right and have been the subject of intensive study [14], [29\u201377]. Other candidates for dark matter, such as primordial black holes [78], mirror dark matter [31,79,80], warm dark matter [81\u201384], ultralight (pseudo)scalar dark matter [85,86], and dark matter in the context of extra-dimensional models [87,88] have also been studied but will not be discussed here. A general estimate shows what size the cross section for scattering of dark matter particles, denoted generically as \u03c3, should be in order to alleviate problems with CDM simulations lacking baryon feedback. It is necessary that there should be one or more DM-DM scatterings over the age of the Universe. The rate of DM-DM scatterings is given by\n\u0393 \u00bc\n\u03c3\nmDM\nvrel\u03c1DM; \u00f01:1\u00de\nwhere mDM denotes the mass of the DM particle.

In this paper we consider SIDM models in which the dark matter is comprised of a spin-1=2 Dirac fermion \u03c7, interacting with a mediator, generically denoted \u03be. Both the DM fermion and the mediator are taken to be singlets under the Standard Model (SM). We study two versions of this model, namely one in which the mediator field is a real scalar, \u03d5, and another in which the mediator is a vector field, \u03be \u00bc V. In both versions, we work in the context of an asymmetric dark matter (ADM) theory (for a review, see, e.g., [42]). Thus, by the time at which large-scale structure formation begins, a net asymmetry has built up in the number density of \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0304 particles. By convention, we take this asymmetry to be such that the number density of \u03c7 particles is dominant over that of \u03c7\u0304 particles. We assume parameter values such that the lowest-order perturbative calculation of the cross section gives a reliable description of the physics, so we do not need to deal with nonperturbative effects and bound states of dark matter particles. We compute the scattering cross section \u03c3, the transfer cross section \u03c3T , and the viscosity cross section \u03c3V for this reaction. As one part of our study, we give analytic and numerical comparisons of results obtained with the inclusion of both t-channel and u-channel exchanges and results obtained in an approximation that has often been used in the literature that includes only the t-channel contribution. Our new results provide improved accuracy for fitting models with self-interacting dark matter to observational data. In the version of our SIDM model with a real scalar mediator \u03be \u00bc \u03d5, we take the interaction between \u03c7 and \u03d5 to be of Yukawa form, as described by the interaction Lagrangian\nLy \u00bc y\u03c7 \u00bd\u03c7\u0304\u03c7 \u03d5: \u00f01:3\u00de\nIn the second version, the DM fermion \u03c7 is assumed to be charged under a U\u00f01\u00deV gauge symmetry with gauge field V and gauge coupling g. Since only the product of the U\u00f01\u00deV charge of \u03c7 times g occurs in the covariant derivative in this theory, we may, without loss of generality, take this charge to be unity and denote the product as g\u03c7 . The corresponding interaction Lagrangian is\nL\u03c7\u0304\u03c7V \u00bc g\u03c7 \u00bd\u03c7\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03c7 V\u03bc: \u00f01:4\u00de\nA Higgs-type mechanism is assumed to break the U\u00f01\u00deV symmetry and give a mass mV to the gauge field V. For compact notation, we use the same symbol, \u03b1\u03c7 , to denote y2\u03c7=\u00f04\u03c0\u00de for the case of a scalar mediator and g2\u03c7=\u00f04\u03c0\u00de for the case of a vector mediator. For our study, it will be\nconvenient to have one reference set of parameters, and for this purpose we will use the values\nm\u03c7 \u00bc 5GeV; m\u03be \u00bc 5MeV; \u03b1\u03c7 \u00bc 3\u00d710\u22124; \u00f01:5\u00de\nwhere, as above, \u03be denotes \u03d5 or V in the two respective versions of the model. Thus, this model makes use of a light mediator. Motivations for this choice are discussed below. Wewill also calculate cross sections for a range of values of the coupling, \u03b1\u03c7 , and the mediator mass,m\u03be, and show how the results compare with those obtained with the reference set of values in Eq. (1.5). Note that the \u03c7 mass term is of Dirac form, Lm\u03c7 \u00bc m\u03c7 \u03c7\u0304\u03c7; we do not consider Majorana mass terms for \u03c7 here. Self-interacting dark matter models of this type have been shown to ameliorate problems with excessive density on the scale of \u223c1 kpc in the cores of galaxies and to improve fits to morphological properties of galaxies and, on larger length scales extending to several Mpc, also improve fits observational data on clusters of galaxies [14], [29\u201377]. Self-interacting dark matter models with scalar and/or vector mediators are motivated by the fact that these yield DM-DM scattering cross sections that decrease as a function of the relative velocities vvel of colliding DM particles, as is desirable to fit observational data. The reason for our restriction to a vectorial gauge interaction in Eq. (1.4) is that the generalization of this to a chiral gauge theory, with an interaction L \u00bc qLg\u00bd\u03c7\u0304L\u03b3\u03bc\u03c7L V\u03bc \u00fe qRg\u00bd\u03c7\u0304R\u03b3\u03bc\u03c7R V\u03bc in which the charges qL \u2260 qR would lead to triangle gauge anomalies unless one added further DM fermions to cancel these. To maintain maximal simplicity, we have thus restricted this version of the model to the vectorial interaction (1.4). The relative velocities of DM particles on all of the scales relevant for galactic and cluster properties are nonrelativistic. Consequently, an approach that has often been used is to model the scattering in terms of a quantum-mechanical problem with a potential of the type that would result in the nonrelativistic limit starting from the t-channel exchange of the mediator. In [64], an analysis was given of the full quantum field theoretic scattering of DM particles in the case of reaction with incident \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7\u0304. However, Ref. [64] did not consider in depth the reaction\n\u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u00f01:6\u00de\nthat is relevant to an ADM model. In passing, we note that our analysis is equally applicable for symmetric dark matter models; however, in this case, the reaction (1.6) only contributes in part to the DM-DM scattering, the other process being \u03c7\u0304 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u0304 \u00fe \u03c7, which was considered extensively in Ref. [64]. Here we focus on the reaction (1.6).\n063013-2"

            "text": "In this section we explain the reasons for our choice of parameter values (1.5) in our model. First, in asymmetric dark matter models, with the asymmetries in the dark matter and the baryons being of similar magnitude, it is plausible that\nmDM mp \u2243 \u03c1DM \u03c1b \u2243 5; \u00f02:1\u00de\nwhere \u03c1b is the average cosmological baryon density, and mp is the proton mass [42]. This leads to the choice m\u03c7 \u2243 5 GeV. (It should be noted that the simple relationship can be avoided in specific models, depending on the mechanisms that are assumed for the generation of the \u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u0304 number asymmetry [42], but it will suffice for our present purposes.) Second, as discussed above, SIDM fits to small-scale structure yield \u03c3=mDM \u223c 1 cm2=g. Now, we will show that in our model, \u03c3=m\u03c7 \u2243 2\u03c0\u03b12\u03c7m\u03c7=m4\u03be . Setting this equal to 1 cm2=g determines the mediator mass m\u03be to be\nm\u03be \u00bc \u03b1\u03c7 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1=2\nm\u03c7\n5 GeV\n1=4\nMeV: \u00f02:2\u00de\nThird, in order to effectively annihilate away the symmetric component of the dark matter in the early Universe in the ADM model, one requires a sizable cross section for \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 \u2192 \u03be\u03be. Note that, from Eq. (2.2), it follows that m\u03be is naturally smaller than m\u03c7 , so that this process is kinematically allowed. The depletion of the symmetric component of the DM in the early Universe is satisfied when [39,40,42]\nh\u03c3vreli\u03c7\u0304\u03c7\u2192VV \u2243 2\u03c0\u03b12\u03c7 m2\u03c7 \u2273 0.6 \u00d7 10\u221225 cm3=s; \u00f02:3\u00de\nwhere we have anticipated thatmV \u226a m\u03c7 ; this then yields a lower bound on the SIDM coupling strength. Combining this with a similar analysis for \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 \u2192 \u03d5\u03d5, one obtains the lower bound\n\u03b1\u03c7 \u2273 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 m\u03c7 5 GeV : \u00f02:4\u00de\nAs stated before, for simplicity, we assume parameter values such that lowest-order perturbative calculations are sufficient to describe the scattering. From Eq. (A3) in Appendix A, this perturbativity condition requires that \u03b1\u03c7m\u03c7=m\u03d5 \u226a 1. Using the constraints in Eqs. (2.1), (2.2), (2.4), and (A3), we then choose the values of the parameters in Eq. (1.5). Because the DM particle \u03c7 and the mediator are SM-singlets, these choices for their masses are in accord with bounds on DM particles and mediators from current data (for summaries of bounds, see, e.g., [89\u201391]).\nAlthough we use the particular set of values of the parameters in Eq. (1.5) for much of our analysis, we also perform cross section calculations for a substantial range of allowed values of \u03b1\u03c7 and m\u03c7 in Sec. VI. These calculations show how our results would change with different (allowed) values of parameters. Importantly, our choices for m\u03c7 and m\u03be, which are motivated from the above considerations, also lead to the desired velocity dependences for the SIDM cross sections in the model that are of the right order to fit observational data."

            "text": "In this section we review some basic kinematics relevant for our cross section calculations. Since the number density of \u03c7\u0304 fermions is much smaller than that of \u03c7 fermions after the \u03c7\u0304 fermions have annihilated away in the ADM framework, the dominant self-interactions of the \u03c7 DM particles arise from the reaction (1.6). We take \u03b1\u03c7 to be sufficiently small that the \u03c7-\u03be interaction can be well described by lowest-order perturbation theory. This entails the condition that there be no significant Sommerfeld enhancement of the scattering. In the case of a vector mediator, the reaction (1.6) involves a repulsive interaction of the \u03c7 particles, so there is obviously no Sommerfeld enhancement. Our choice of parameters (1.5) also guarantees the reliability of the lowest-order perturbative calculation in the scalar case, as is discussed further in Appendix A. At tree level, there are two graphs contributing to the \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 reaction, involving exchange of the mediator in the t-channel and u-channel, with a relative minus sign between the two terms in the amplitude, resulting from the fact that these two graphs are related by the interchange of identical fermions in the final state.

For our discussion, it will be useful to distinguish the terms in d\u03c3=dt arising from\nPjM\u00f0t\u00dej2, PjM\u00f0u\u00dej2, andP\u00bdM\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de \u00feM\u00f0u\u00de M\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 2PRe\u00bdM\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de . We denote these as d\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de=dt, d\u03c3\u00f0u\u00de=dt, and d\u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de=dt, respectively.

(4.3) are d\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de=dt and d\u03c3\u00f0u\u00de=dt, while the third term with curly brackets is d\u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de=dt. Since the amplitude (4.1) is antisymmetric under interchange of identical particles in the final state, and equivalently under interchange of the t-channel and u-channel terms, it follows that the square of the amplitude is symmetric under this interchange. This symmetry under the interchange t \u2194 u is evident in the RHS of Eq. (4.3). The center-of-mass cross section, \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM, is related to d\u03c3=dt as\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00bc \u03bb\u00f0s;m 2 \u03c7 ; m2\u03c7\u00de\n4\u03c0s d\u03c3 dt \u00bc \u03b22\u03c7s 4\u03c0 d\u03c3 dt : \u00f04:4\u00de\nIn terms of the center-of-mass scattering angle \u03b8, the symmetry of the RHS of Eq. (4.3) under the interchange t \u2194 u is expressed as the symmetry\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00f0\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u00de: \u00f04:5\u00de\n063013-4\nBecause of the identical particles in the final state, a scattering event in which a scattered \u03c7 particle emerges at angle \u03b8 is indistinguishable from one in which a scattered \u03c7 emerges at angle \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8. The total cross section for the reaction (1.6) thus involves a symmetry factor of 1=2 to compensate for the double-counting involved in the integration over the range \u03b8 \u2208 \u00bd0; \u03c0 :\n\u03c3 \u00bc 1 2\nZ d\u03a9\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n: \u00f04:6\u00de\nOwing to the symmetry (4.5), this is equivalent to a polar angle integration from 0 to \u03c0=2:\n1\n2\nZ 1\n\u22121 d cos \u03b8 d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00bc Z 1\n0\nd cos \u03b8 d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n: \u00f04:7\u00de\n[Recall that if the final state consisted of n identical particles, the factor 1=2 in Eq. (4.6) would be replaced by 1=n!.] In addition to the differential cross section \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM, other related (center-of-mass) differential cross sections have been used in the study of the effects of self-interacting dark matter, motivated by earlier analyses of transport properties in gases and plasmas (e.g., [92] and references therein). A major reason for this was the desire to define a differential cross section that yields a useful description of the thermalization effect of DM-DM scattering, particularly in the case where the mass of the mediator particle is much smaller than the mass of the DM particle. In this case, to the extent that the scattering angle \u03b8 is close to 0 for distinguishable particles or close to 0 or \u03c0 for indistinguishable particles, the DM particle trajectories are not significantly changed by the scattering. To give greater weighting to large-angle scattering that thermalizes particles in a gas or plasma, researchers [92] have used the transfer (T) differential cross section,\nd\u03c3T d\u03a9 \u00bc \u00f01 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u00de d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00f04:8\u00de\nand the viscosity (V) differential cross section,\nd\u03c3V d\u03a9 \u00bc \u00f01 \u2212 cos2\u03b8\u00de d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n; \u00f04:9\u00de\n(Although the same symbol, V, is used for the vector mediator and viscosity, the context will always make clear which meaning is intended.) For the same reason, namely that these describe thermalization effects better than the ordinary cross section, the transfer and viscosity cross sections have been used in studies of DM-DM scattering (e.g., [31,41] and subsequent work). Given the invariance of \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM under the transformation \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 and the fact that cos \u03b8 is odd under this transformation, it follows that the integral of the product of cos \u03b8 times \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM vanishes. Hence, the total cross section is equal to the total transfer cross section:\n\u03c3 \u00bc 1 2\nZ d\u03a9\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00bc 2\u03c0 2\nZ 1\n\u22121 d cos \u03b8 d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00bc 2\u03c0 2\nZ 1\n\u22121 d cos \u03b8\u00f01 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u00de d\u03c3 d\u03a9\nCM\n\u00bc \u03c3T: \u00f04:10\u00de\nAs was noted in [92], the transfer differential cross section does not correctly describe the scattering in the case of identical particles, since it does not maintain the \u03b8 \u2194 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 symmetry in the reaction. However, given Eq. (4.10), the resultant integral over angles is equal to the integral of the ordinary (unweighted) cross section, i.e., \u03c3T \u00bc \u03c3. The viscosity differential cross section, with its angleweighting factor of \u00f01 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8\u00de \u00bc sin2 \u03b8 does maintain the \u03b8 \u2194 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 symmetry in the scattering of identical particles. In passing, we note that another type of differential cross section has also been considered that weights large-angle scattering [45], namely \u00f01 \u2212 j cos \u03b8j\u00de\u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM; this also maintains the \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 symmetry of reaction (1.6).) In the nonrelativistic (NR) limit \u03b2\u03c7 \u226a 1, the kinematic invariants have the property that s \u226b fjtj; jujg; m2\u03c7 \u226b fjtj; jujg; and s \u2192 \u00f02m\u03c7\u00de2.

(4.11), since it interchanges the first and second terms arising, respectively, from jM\u00f0t\u00dej2 and from jM\u00f0u\u00dej2, and leaves the third term arising from \u22122Re\u00f0M\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de\u00de invariant. Since all of the \u03c7-\u03c7 relative velocities vrel in the relevant observational data are nonrelativistic, we will henceforth specialize to this case, taking the subscript NR to be implicit in the notation. Since self-interacting dark matter has been studied extensively before, it is appropriate to discuss how our current results compare with and complement previous work. In [Eq. (25) of] the review [54] on SIDM, the differential cross section in the center of mass for elastic DM self-scattering was given (in the same perturbative Born regime \u03b1\u03c7m\u03c7=m\u03d5 \u226a 1 as we use here) as\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9 \u00bc \u03b1 2 \u03c7m2\u03c7 \u00bdm2\u03c7v2rel\u00f01 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u00de=2\u00fem2\u03d5 2 \u2261 \u03c30\u00bdr sin2\u00f0\u03b8=2\u00de \u00fe 1 2 ;\n\u00f04:14\u00de\nwhere we transcribe the result from [54] in our notation in the second term of Eq. (4.14). As is evident, this corresponds to the t-channel contribution in our full result (4.11). However, the true differential cross section for the DM self-scattering \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 must include not just the t-channel contribution but also the u-channel contribution, as we have done here. A subsequent study in [70] gave results from a semiclassical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the quantum mechanical problem of a DM particle scattering from a Yukawa potential and noted identical-particle effects. Our work is complementary to [70], since we perform a full quantum field theory calculation with analysis of both t-channel and u-channel contributions, rather than just solving a quantum-mechanical potential scattering problem. See also [77]. Regarding the range of values of the ratio r in Eq. (4.13), it is important to note that even in the nonrelativistic regime \u03b2rel \u226a 1, it is not necessarily the case that the ratio r is small. With the illustrative mass values in Eq. (1.5), and taking into account that for vrel \u223c 3 \u00d7 103 km=s (i.e., \u03b2rel \u223c 10\u22122) for DM particles in galaxy clusters, it follows that r \u223c 102 in this case. In contrast, for the analysis of DM self-interactions on length scales of order a few kpc within a galaxy, if vrel \u223c 30 km= sec (i.e., \u03b2rel \u223c 10\u22124), then r \u223cO\u00f010\u22122\u00de. It is interesting to elucidate how the various contributions to the cross section from jM\u00f0t\u00dej2, jM\u00f0u\u00dej2, and 2Re\u00f0M\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de\u00de behave as a function of r. We find that in the r \u226a 1 regime relevant for the analysis of galactic data on the 1\u201310 kpc scale, the terms contributing to \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM have the property that the t-channel term jM\u00f0t\u00dej2 and the u-channel term jM\u00f0u\u00dej2 give equal contributions, while the t-u interference term 2Re\u00f0M\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de\u00de\ngives a contribution equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to that from jM\u00f0u\u00dej2. As we denoted the three terms contributing to d\u03c3=dt, we similarly label the three terms contributing to \u00f0d\u03c3=d\u03a9\u00deCM and the resultant total cross section with superscripts (t), (u), and \u00f0tu\u00de, so that the respective contributions to the total cross section are\n\u03c3\u00f0i\u00de \u2261 1 2\nZ d\u03c3\u00f0i\u00de\nd\u03a9\nCM\nd\u03a9; i \u00bc t; u; tu; \u00f04:15\u00de\nand\n\u03c3 \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de \u00fe \u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de: \u00f04:16\u00de\nWe calculate\n\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de \u00bc 2\u03c0\u03c30 1\u00fe r \u00f04:17\u00de\nand\n\u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de \u00bc \u22124\u03c0\u03c30 ln\u00f01\u00fe r\u00de r\u00f02\u00fe r\u00de ; \u00f04:18\u00de\nso that\n\u03c3 \u00bc 4\u03c0\u03c30\n1 1\u00fe r \u2212 ln\u00f01\u00fe r\u00de r\u00f02\u00fe r\u00de : \u00f04:19\u00de\nFor fixed \u03c30, the total cross section \u03c3 is a monotonically decreasing function of the ratio r. Concerning the individual contributions to \u03c3, we observe that\n\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de \u00bc \u2212\u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de \u00bc 2\u03c0\u03c30 at r \u00bc 0; \u00f04:20\u00de\nso that for small r, there is a cancellation between the interference term \u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de and the u-channel term \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de (or equivalently, the t-channel term, since \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de). In contrast, for large r, \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0u\u00de decrease as 2\u03c0\u03c30=r, while \u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de decreases more rapidly, as \u03c3\u00f0tu\u00de \u223c \u22124\u03c0\u03c30 ln r=r2.

For the (nonrelativistic) large-r regime, the ratio (4.24) has the expansion\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 2 1 \u2212 ln r r \u00fe ln r \u2212 1 r2 \u00feO ln r r3\nfor NR regime and r \u226b 1: \u00f04:26\u00de\nThus, in this large-r regime relevant for fits to observational data on galaxy clusters, the full \u03c7-\u03c7 scattering cross section is larger by approximately a factor of 2 then the result obtained by keeping only the contribution from the t-channel. In order to compare the full calculation including contributions from both the t-channel and u-channel with a calculation that only includes the t-channel, we plot \u03c3 versus \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de in Fig. 2 as a function of vrel. For this purpose, we use the illustrative values of masses and couplings in Eq. (1.5). In accordance with our result (5.2) below, we subsume the cases of a scalar and a vector mediator together and denote m\u03be as the mass of \u03d5 or V. We note again that with these values, there is no significant Sommerfeld enhancement of the cross section, justifying our use of the lowest-order (tree-level) perturbatively computed amplitude in the scalar case. Separately, there is no Sommerfeld enhancement in the vector case since the scattering is repulsive. The dependence of the differential cross sections on the angle \u03b8 is shown in the comparative Fig. 2(d). As is evident from Fig. 2, for the range of relative velocities vrel \u2272 102 km=s relevant for dark matter scattering in the interior of galaxies and dwarf spheroidal satellites, \u03c3 is close to \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de, but as vrel increases beyond about 102 km=s, although both \u03c3 and \u03c3\u00f0t\u00de decrease, the full cross section is larger than the result obtained by keeping only the t-channel contribution. This trend continues to values vrel \u223cO\u00f0103\u00de km=s relevant to dark matter effects in galaxy clusters. One should note that even for a fixed vrel, there is considerable diversity in the values of \u03c3=mDM inferred from fits to galactic and cluster data (e.g., [50,53,73,93] and references therein). The curves marked QMdist in Fig. 2 are the results that one would obtain in a quantum mechanical approach with a potential for the\ndifferent situation with distinguishable particles (see Appendices). We show results for a specific set of vrel values in Table I."

[34]] is what one would get for the DM self-scattering if one did the calculation for nonidentical particles and hence only included the t-channel contribution and did not include the 1=2 factor for identical particles in the final state in performing the integral over d\u03a9. That is,\n\u03c3T;TYZ;FKY \u00bc 2\u03c3\u00f0t\u00deT : \u00f04:32\u00de\nTo compare the full transfer cross section with the result obtained by just including the t-channel contribution, we examine the ratio\n\u03c3T\n\u03c3\u00f0t\u00deT \u00bc\nr\u00bd 1 1\u00fer \u2212 ln\u00f01\u00fer\u00de r\u00f02\u00fer\u00de\n\u00bd\u2212 1 1\u00fer \u00fe ln\u00f01\u00fer\u00der\n: \u00f04:33\u00de\nFor small r, this ratio has the expansion\n\u03c3T \u03c3\u00f0t\u00deT \u00bc 1\u00fe r 3 \u00fe r\n2\n9 \u00feO\u00f0r3\u00de for r \u226a 1: \u00f04:34\u00de\nFor large r, we find\n\u03c3T \u03c3\u00f0t\u00deT \u223c r ln r \u2212 1 for r \u226b 1: \u00f04:35\u00de\nThus, although both our \u03c3T and the result \u03c3T;FKY;TYZ decrease with vrel (and thus with r, for fixed m\u03c7 and m\u03be), our result decreases substantially less rapidly for large r. With our parameters, this large-r regime includes values of vrel \u223cO\u00f0103\u00de km=s typical of galaxy clusters. For example, at vrel \u00bc 3 \u00d7 103 km=s [corresponding to r \u00bc 102 with our choices form\u03c7 andm\u03be in Eq. (1.5)], the ratio (4.33) has the value 26, or equivalently, \u03c3T=\u03c3T;FKY;TYZ \u00bc 13, a substantial difference from unity. Therefore, in performing fits to observational data, if one uses the transfer cross section, we would advocate the use of Eq. (4.30) rather than the result in Eq. (A1) of Ref. [40] for the large-r regime, since they differ substantially. In Fig. 2(b) we plot \u03c3T in comparison with \u03c3 \u00f0t\u00de T over the same range of vvel and thus also \u03b2rel as for the regular CM cross section. The fact that the true \u03c3T decreases considerably less rapidly than the t-channel contribution used in [34,40] is evident in this figure. This is also apparent in Table I.\nC.

            "text": "In summary, in this paper we have studied a model with self-interacting dark matter consisting of a Dirac fermion \u03c7 coupled to a scalar or vector mediator such that the reaction \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 is well described by perturbation theory. An asymmetric dark matter framework is assumed for this study. We have computed the scattering cross section for this reaction including both t-channel and u-channel contributions and have analyzed how the results with inclusion\nof contributions from both of these channels compare with a calculation that has often been used in the literature that only includes the t-channel contribution. Our results elucidate the interplay between the terms jM\u00f0t\u00dej2, jM\u00f0u\u00dej2, and the interference term \u22122Re\u00f0M\u00f0t\u00de M\u00f0u\u00de\u00de in both the differential and total cross sections. We find a particularly strong deviation at large r from results in the literature for the transfer cross section \u03c3T that include only t-channel contributions. With the illustrative values of the dark matter\n063013-11\nfermion mass m\u03c7 , the mediator mass m\u03be, and the coupling \u03b1\u03c7 used here, the region of large r corresponds to DM velocities vrel \u223c 103 km=s, which occur in galaxy clusters. Further, we have studied how our cross section calculations vary for a range of mediator mass m\u03be and DM-mediator coupling \u03b1\u03c7 . Our analytic and numerical calculations should be useful in fits to observational data. A self-interacting dark matter model of the type considered here remains an appealing approach to accounting for this data on scales ranging from 1\u201310 kpc in galaxies to several Mpc in galaxy clusters."

            "text": "In this appendix we discuss further some aspects of the \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7 \u00fe \u03c7 reaction. We comment first on the relation between our full quantum field theoretic calculation and the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical analysis in the nonrelativistic limit, where one considers scattering of the \u03c7 particle in a potential. This relation is relevant since the velocities that occur, both on length scales of galaxies (vrel \u223c 30\u2013200 km=s), and on length scales relevant for galaxy clusters [vrel \u223cO\u00f0103\u00de km=s], are all nonrelativistic. A standard reduction of a two-body problem of the scattering of two different particles a and b expresses this in terms of an effective one-body problem in which a particle with the reduced mass \u03bc \u00bc mamb=\u00f0ma \u00femb\u00de undergoes a scattering due to an isotropic potential V. For the equalmass situation under consideration here, the particle has \u03bc \u00bc m\u03c7=2 and velocity vrel \u00bc 2v\u03c7, and hence momentum p \u00bc \u03bcvrel \u00bc \u00f0m\u03c7=2\u00de\u00f02v\u03c7\u00de \u00bc m\u03c7v\u03c7 \u00bc jp\u20d7\u03c7 j, where jp\u20d7\u03c7 j was given in Eq. (3.3). The corresponding magnitude of the wave vector is k \u00bc p=\u210f\u2261 p in our units with \u210f \u00bc 1. A common approach is to use the Born approximation to describe a sufficiently weak scattering process. The condition for the Born approximation to be valid in the quantum mechanical analysis of potential scattering takes two different forms depending on jp\u20d7j. In both cases, it is essentially the condition that the scattered wave is a small perturbation on the incident plane wave. We use the fact that in this quantum mechanical approach, the interaction mediated by \u03be exchange is represented by a potential,\nV\u00f0x\u20d7\u00de \u00bc V\u00f0jx\u20d7j\u00de \u00bc V0 e\u2212m\u03bejx\u20d7j\nm\u03bejx\u20d7j \u00f0A1\u00de\nwith\nV0 m\u03be \u00bc \u03b1\u03c7 : \u00f0A2\u00de\nWe define the distance jx\u20d7j\u2261 d. The range of this potential is \u223ca \u00bc 1=m\u03be. The condition for the validity of the Born approximation takes the following two forms [94], depending on the value of ka \u00bc p=m\u03be \u00bc \u03b2\u03c7m\u03c7=m\u03be \u00bc ffiffi r p =2, where r is the ratio (4.13). For r \u226a 1, the condition is that the kinetic energy 1=\u00f02\u03bca2\u00de should be much larger than the potential energy \u223cV0, i.e., 2\u03bca2V0 \u226a 1. Substituting a \u00bc 1=m\u03be and the expression for V0 in Eq. (A2), this is the inequality\n2\u03bcV0 m2\u03be \u00bc \u03b1\u03c7m\u03c7 m\u03be \u226a 1: \u00f0A3\u00de\nFor r \u226b 1, the condition is \u00f0V0a=\u03b2rel\u00de ln\u00f02ka\u00de \u226a 1, which can be rewritten as\n\u03b1\u03c7 \u03b2rel ln\u00f0 ffiffirp \u00de \u226a 1: \u00f0A4\u00de To show that our parameter choices in Eq. (1.5) satisfy these conditions, we first consider values of vrel \u223c 30 km=s relevant for SIDM dynamics within galaxies. Then \u03b2rel \u00bc 10\u22124 so r \u00bc \u00f0\u03b2relm\u03c7=m\u03be\u00de2 \u00bc 10\u22122. Since this is \u226a 1, condition (A3) is applicable. We have \u03b1\u03c7m\u03c7=m\u03be \u00bc 0.3 for our choices of parameters in Eq. (1.5). For a value of vrel \u223c 3 \u00d7 103 km=s relevant for galaxy clusters, \u03b2rel \u00bc 10\u22122, so r \u00bc 102, and hence condition (A4) applies. For this value of vrel, the left-hand side of the inequality (A4) is 0.069, which is\u226a 1. Thus, as stated in the text, with our choices of \u03b1\u03c7 , m\u03c7 , and m\u03be and for the values of vrel of relevance to SIDM effects on scales ranging from 1\u201310 kpc in the core of a galaxy to several Mpc for clusters of galaxies, our restriction to the Born regime is justified."

In a quantum mechanical analysis, one writes the full wave function as consisting of an incident term (choosing the initial direction of propagation to be along the z axis, with no loss of generality) plus the spherical wave due to the scattering by the potential.

The scattering amplitude f\u00f0\u03b8\u00de can be expanded in terms of partial waves as\nf\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc 1 k X\u221e l\u00bc0 \u00f02l\u00fe 1\u00deAlPl\u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de; \u00f0B2\u00de\nwhere Pl\u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de is the Legendre polynomial and\nAl \u00bc ei\u03b4l sin \u03b4l \u00f0B3\u00de\nis the quantum mechanical scattering amplitude in the l\u2019th partial wave, with phase shift \u03b4l. The differential scattering cross section is then\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9 \u00bc jf\u00f0\u03b8\u00dej2\n\u00bc 1 k2 X\u221e l;l0\u00bc0 \u00f02l\u00fe1\u00de\u00f02l0 \u00fe1\u00deAlA l0Pl\u00f0cos\u03b8\u00dePl0 \u00f0cos\u03b8\u00de:\n\u00f0B4\u00de\nGiven a potential V\u00f0x\u20d70\u00de, the Born approximation to f is\nf \u00bc \u2212 \u03bc 2\u03c0\nZ d3x\u20d70e\u2212ik\u20d7 0\u00b7x\u20d70V\u00f0x\u20d70\u00deeik\u20d7\u00b7x\u20d70 \u00f0B5\u00de\nwhere k\u20d7 and k\u20d70 are the wave vectors of the incident and scattered waves. This is evidently the Fourier transform of V\u00f0x\u20d70\u00de with respect to the momentum transfer q\u20d7 \u00bc k\u20d7 \u2212 k\u20d70, with magnitude\nq\u2261 jq\u20d7j \u00bc 2k sin\u00f0\u03b8=2\u00de: \u00f0B6\u00de Consider the Yukawa potential (with d \u00bc jx\u20d7j):\nV\u00f0d\u00de \u00bc \u03b1\u03c7 e\u2212m\u03bed\nd : \u00f0B7\u00de\nA standard calculation yields the scattering amplitude\nfYuk\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc\u2213 2\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7m2\u03be \u00fe q2 : \u00f0B8\u00de\nFor our application to \u03c7-\u03c7 scattering, the reduced mass is \u03bc \u00bc m\u03c7=2 and k \u00bc \u00f0m\u03c7=2\u00devrel, i.e., q \u00bc m\u03c7vrel sin\u00f0\u03b8=2\u00de. Therefore, from Eq. (B4), in the Born approximation,\nd\u03c3 d\u03a9\nYuk\n\u00bc \u03b1 2 \u03c7m2\u03c7\n\u00f0m2\u03be \u00fem2\u03c7v2relsin2\u00f0\u03b8=2\u00de\u00de2\n\u00bc \u03c30\u00f01\u00fe rsin2\u00f0\u03b8=2\u00de\u00de2 ; \u00f0B9\u00de\nwhere we have used the definitions of \u03c30 and r in Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13). Comparing Eq. (B9) with Eq. (4.11), one sees that if one were to approach the calculation without proper use of the antisymmetrization of the quantum mechanical wave function, then the Yukawa potential would correspond to inclusion of only the t-channel contribution to the full quantum field theoretic amplitude. Finally, applying the definitions of transfer and viscosity cross sections, given in Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9) yields the corresponding cross sections for this Yukawa potential:\n\u03c3CM;Yuk \u00bc 4\u03c0\u03c30 1\u00fe r ; \u00f0B10\u00de\n\u03c3T;Yuk \u00bc 8\u03c0\u03c30 r \u2212 1 1\u00fe r\u00fe ln\u00f01\u00fe r\u00de r ; \u00f0B11\u00de\n\u03c3V;Yuk \u00bc 16\u03c0\u03c30 r2\n\u22122\u00fe \u00f02\u00fe r\u00de ln\u00f01\u00fe r\u00de\nr\n: \u00f0B12\u00de\nThus, these are the cross sections that one would get in a quantum mechanical treatment if one did not take account of the necessity of antisymmetrizing the wave function under exchange of identical fermions. The calculation in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for identical fermion scattering must, of course, respect the Pauli exclusion principle. In other words, the wave function for the \u03c7-\u03c7 system should be completely antisymmetric, i.e., should have the form of a Slater determinant, namely\n\u03a8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 2 p \u03c71\u00f0x1\u00de \u03c72\u00f0x1\u00de\u03c71\u00f0x2\u00de \u03c72\u00f0x2\u00de\n: \u00f0B13\u00de From here, it is evident that the normalization factor 1= ffiffiffi 2 p in the Slater determinant wave function is equivalent to the factor1=2 in the formula for the scattering cross section (4.6). The antisymmetrization in the Slater determinant is the quantum mechanical equivalent of the inclusion of both the t-channel and the u-channel diagrams in the quantum field theoretic calculation. Thus, a quantum mechanical treatment with proper antisymmetrization for scattering of identical fermions gives the same result as the (nonrelativistic limit of the) quantum field theoretic calculation. We have presented the results for these cross sections for the Born regime in the text, as Eqs. (4.19), (4.30), and (4.38).\n063013-13\n[1] G. R. Blumenthal, S. M. Faber, J. R. Primack, and M. J.
