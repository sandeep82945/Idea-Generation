    "abstractText": "A new nano\u2010antibiotic was synthesized from the conjugation of multi\u2010walled carbon nanotubes with levofloxacin (MWCNT\u2010LVX) through covalent grafting of drug with surface\u2010modified carbon nanotubes in order to achieve an effective, safe, fast\u2010acting nano\u2010drug with the minimal side effects. This study is the first report on the evaluation of in vitro cell viability and antibacterial activity of nano\u2010antibiotic along in addition to the in vivo antibacterial activity in a burn wound model. The drug\u2010loading and release profile at different pH levels was determined using an ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometer. MWCNT\u2010LVX was synthesized by a simple, reproducible and cost\u2010effective method for the first time and characterized using various techniques, such as scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller analysis, and so forth. The noncytotoxic nano\u2010 antibiotic showed more satisfactory in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus compared to Pseudomona aeruginosa. The novel synthetic nano\u2010drug possessed high loading capacity and pH\u2010sensitive release profile; resultantly, it exhibited very potent bactericidal activity in a mouse S. aureus wound infection model compared to LVX. Based on the results, the antibacterial properties of the drug enhanced after conjugating with surface\u2010modified MWCNTs. The nano\u2010antibiotic has great industrialization potential for the simple route of synthesis, no toxicity, proper drug loading and release, low effective dose, and strong activity against wound infections. In virtue of unique properties, MWCNTs can serve as a controlled release and delivery system for drugs. The easy penetration to biological membranes and barriers can also increase the drug delivery at lower doses compared to the main drug alone, which can lead to the reduction of its side effects. Hence, MWCNTs can be considered a promising nano\u2010carrier of LVX in the treatment of skin infections.",

This study is the first report on the evaluation of in vitro cell viability and antibacterial activity of nano\u2011antibiotic along in addition to the in vivo antibacterial activity in a burn wound model. The drug\u2011loading and release profile at different pH levels was determined using an ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometer. MWCNT\u2011LVX was synthesized by a simple, reproducible and cost\u2011effective method for the first time and characterized using various techniques, such as scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller analysis, and so forth. The noncytotoxic nano\u2011 antibiotic showed more satisfactory in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus compared to Pseudomona aeruginosa. The novel synthetic nano\u2011drug possessed high loading capacity and pH\u2011sensitive release profile; resultantly, it exhibited very potent bactericidal activity in a mouse S. aureus wound infection model compared to LVX. Based on the results, the antibacterial properties of the drug enhanced after conjugating with surface\u2011modified MWCNTs. The nano\u2011antibiotic has great industrialization potential for the simple route of synthesis, no toxicity, proper drug loading and release, low effective dose, and strong activity against wound infections. In virtue of unique properties, MWCNTs can serve as a controlled release and delivery system for drugs. The easy penetration to biological membranes and barriers can also increase the drug delivery at lower doses compared to the main drug alone, which can lead to the reduction of its side effects. Hence, MWCNTs can be considered a promising nano\u2011carrier of LVX in the treatment of skin infections.\nThe introduction of antibiotics induced a radical decline in the rate of morbidity and mortality at the beginning of the twentieth century1. However, inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics caused the prevalence of antibiotic tolerance and resistance\u00a0in the past decades2. The global crisis of antimicrobial resistance currently threatens both the effective prevention and treatment of a wide range of bacterial infectious diseases3. With no effective antibiotics, the medical world can once again return to the \u201cpre-antibiotic era\". Consequently, the production of novel antibacterial agents or the application of innovative strategies to improve the pharmacokinetic and reduce resistance to available antibacterial drugs is of paramount importance.\nDiscovering new drugs is time-consuming and laborious. However, enhancing the efficacy of the existing antibacterial agents can accelerate the process of drug development through different techniques such as the combination therapies or the application of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems4,5. The nanomaterials have attracted particular interest from various research groups due to their ideal physical and chemical properties, proper drug targeting efficiency, enhanced uptake, and suitable bio-distribution5.

However, the hydrophobic nature, poor dispersibility, and toxicity effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can limit their applications in biomedical studies9. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the surface chemistry can be modified using different functionalization approaches and also the dispersity and biocompatibility need to be enhanced under physiological conditions9,10. Moreover, the decreased toxicity of the functionalized MWCNTs has been confirmed in previous research studies4,11.\nOxidation of MWCNTs with strong acids is known to be among the most promising and frequently employed approaches for surface modification10. This technique produces the carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNT-COOH) as efficient nano-platforms to immobilize multiple molecules by covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions12,13. The functionalized MWCNTs with large surface areas possess a high loading capacity for various ligands such as peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and drugs14. Moreover, they can be taken up by various tissues and cells without causing any damage, and depending on the types of surface functional groups, the loaded ligands can also be transferred15. The cellular internalization of CNTs contains three different mechanisms: endocytosis, phagocytosis, and direct translocation across the plasma membrane15. Studies have affirmed the effects of coating on the surface of CNTs in their internalization into mammalian cells14,15.\nThe chemically modified MWCNTs have been also extensively studied for their various biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and potent anticancer activities16\u201318. The crisis of both antibiotic tolerance and resistance encouraged many researchers to investigate antibacterial drug delivery systems by MWCNTs19\u201322. Also, the evaluation of the antibacterial effects of the carriers themselves (MWCNTs) and their functionalized forms was noticed by research groups.\nA number of investigations have confirmed that the functionalization of MWCNTs improves their dispersion in aqueous media, resulting in the enhanced antibacterial activity, e.g. functionalizing with amino acids (arginine and lysine)23 and surfactants (polysorbates, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide)24,25.\nAzizi-Lalabadi et\u00a0al. have reviewed the antimicrobial activity of carbon nanomaterials and reported that MWCNTs with the surface factors (\u2013OH and \u2013COOH) do not display any bacteriostatic properties26. However, some studies have presented the proper bacteriostatic effects of the composites, including MWCNTs and silver nanoparticles against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which can related to a powerful synergistic effect between MWCNTs and silver nanoparticles26. They also introduced the low-density polyethylene-based nanocomposites containing MWCNTs with antimicrobial activity against E. coli26. Nonetheless, the study of Ding and coworkers displayed the higher antibacterial activity of individually dispersed oxidized MWCNTs compared to aggregated raw MWCNTs27. Their study confirmed the importance of dispersion of MWCNTs in the antibacterial effect of CNTs.\nThe antimicrobial activity of pristine and functionalized MWCNTs with mono-, di-, and triethanolamine (MEA, DEA, and TEA) against multiple bacterial species demonstrated the direct impact of functional group type on antimicrobial properties of mentioned nanotubes (MWCNT-TEA > MWCNT-DEA > MWCNT-MEA > pristine MWCNT)28. The results of these surveys are powerful evidence approving the key role of functional groups in antimicrobial activities of MWCNTs. The functionalization of MWCNTs with an antibiotic can also ameliorate its antibacterial activity. Spizzirri et\u00a0al. have synthesized bioconjugates using gelatin, MWCNTs, and fluoroquinolones and demonstrated that the hybrid nanomaterials greatly enhance antimicrobial activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli29.\nSelecting a suitable antibiotic in the drug delivery system has particular importance and can promote antimicrobial activity by a suitable synergistic effect between drug and nano-carrier. Levofloxacin (LVX) is a broadspectrum, third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic with demonstrated activity against Gram-positive, Gramnegative, and anaerobic bacteria, which is mostly used for the treatment of many types of infections such as respiratory tract infections, post-inhalational anthrax, bacterial conjunctivitis, genitourinary infections, and skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs)30,31. SSSIs are an important issue in healthcare with a significant burden in infectious disease which is responsible to high rate of hospitalization. LVX with its once daily dose, great safety profile and easy transition to oral therapy is an proper selection to treat the full gamut of skin and skin structure infections.\nLevofloxacin, as\u00a0a safe and effective medicine, received FDA approval in the United States in 199631. LVX inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two critical\u00a0enzymes\u00a0for the transcription, replication, and repair of bacterial DNA32. This antibiotic is considered a preferable drug for the management of burn-associated infections33. However, due to its widespread application, resistant bacterial strains began to emerge under numerous clinical conditions34.\nIn developing countries, burns are recognized as one of the most common injuries with a high mortality rate35. Burns weaken the immune system and make the patient more susceptible to\u00a0various infections as damaged skin cannot protect the body against microbes36. Therefore, a proper wound care is very important for reducing the risk of infection. The combination therapy\u00a0with systemic and topical antibiotics, in comparison to systemic antibiotics alone, is more effective in the prevention of wound infection. Notably, topical antibiotics have the advantage of delivering high concentrations of\u00a0antibiotics to the affected area, whereas systemic antibiotics need adsorption and then distribution throughout the body37. Due to blood vessel damage, systemic antibiotics cannot pass through the bloodstream and penetrate burn wounds38. Hence, the application of topical antibiotics is more common than systemic antibiotics39.\nThe current innovative study aimed to design and synthesize a new nano-antibiotic based on the covalent functionalization of MWCNTs with levofloxacin. For the enhancement of the aqueous dispersity and biocompatibility of nano-antibiotics, MWCNTs were connected to LVX by the amino-PEG2-amine linker (Fig.\u00a01). The in\u00a0vitro loading, release profile, and in\u00a0vitro antibacterial activity of nano-drug against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were evaluated, as well. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of nano-antibiotic was assessed on the fibroblast cell line using the MTT assay. In the end, the topical delivery of the antibiotic against the S. aureus skin infection\u00a0mouse model was examined."

Briefly, the bands of LVX were reported as follows: 3268\u00a0 cm\u22121 (OH), 2959\u20132803\u00a0 cm\u22121 (CH2, CH3), 1722\u00a0 cm\u22121 (C=O acid, stretching vibration of the COOH), 1622\u00a0 cm\u22121 (C=O ring), and 839\u00a0 cm\u22121 (C\u2013F). Aromatic hydrocarbons showed absorptions in the regions 1585 and 1404\u00a0 cm\u2212140. The observation of a relative increase in the carbonyl band\u2019s intensity at 1626 and 1679\u00a0 cm\u22121 confirms the formation of new amide bonds, MWCNT-NH2 and LVX. Their interaction was also resulted in a broad band at 3412\u00a0 cm\u22121 (3100\u20133600\u00a0 cm\u22121 region), which can be related to \u2013OH stretching vibration of LVX and \u2013NH\u2013 stretching vibration of amide groups. The existence of a weak bond at 1715\u00a0 cm\u22121 can be assigned to the carbonyl band of LVX. The mentioned peaks (3412 and 1715\u00a0 cm\u2212-1) in drug-loaded formulation may be related to the non-covalent interaction of the\u00a0drug with the nano-carrier (MWCNT-NH2). Out-of-plane wagging at 650\u00a0 cm-1 is the characteristic of primary amines.\nRaman analysis and X\u2011ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Figure\u00a0 3a shows the Raman spectra of MWCNT-COOH and MWCNT-LVX. Two main peaks in the Raman spectra were appeared at 1344.20 and 1570.97\u00a0 cm\u22121, known as D and G bonds, respectively. The\u00a0 D band is related to disordered carbon atoms of MWCNTs corresponding to SP3 hybridization, and the\u00a0G band shows the SP2 hybridization of carbon atoms in the graphene sheets. Area ratio of the D and G bonds (ID/IG) can be used to assess the amount of defects in the nanoparticle structure. ID/IG ratio increased for MWCNT-LVX (ID/IG = 1.168), which affirms the successful conversion of MWCNT-COOH to MWCNT-LVX. In the absence of amorphous carbon, the increase of ID is related to the elevation of carbon containing SP3 hybridized and implies the successful functionalization reaction.\nFigure\u00a03b displays XRD spectroscopy patterns of MWCNT-COOH, MWCNT-NH2, and MWCNT-LVX. The XRD patterns of the oxidized CNTs and the functionalized CNTs have diffraction peaks at corresponding positions, indicating that MWCNT-NH2 and MWCNT-LVX still have the same tubular structure compared to MWCNT-COOH without any change in the lattice spacing. The intense peak at \u03b8 = 26\u00b0 is indexed as the (002) reflection of the hexagonal graphite structure and the peak around 43\u00b0 is resulted to the (100) graphitic planes. The XRD pattern clearly confirms the formation of nano-carrier (MWCNT-NH2) due to decreased intensity of peaks. The diffraction pattern of MWCNT-LVX showed the broad peak at 26\u00b0 was deconvoluted into two peaks; the first peak centered at 2\u03b8 = 26.04\u00b0, and the other peak centered at 26.34\u00b0, clearly confirms the formation of nano-drug.\nField emission scanning electron microscopy (FE\u2011SEM). The surface morphology of the modified and functionalized MWCNTs was investigated using FE-SEM. The FE-SEM image of MWCNT-COOH indicated its smooth, long, tortuous, and agglomerated\u00a0structures (Fig.\u00a04-Ia). However, the MWCNT-LVX showed a lower degree of entanglement and agglomeration in addition to rugged appearances compared to MWCNTLVX. This observation is indicative of defect creation in nanotubes wherein the functional groups and drug were loaded, resulting in the appearance of irregular and branched sites on the MWCNTs surface (Fig.\u00a04-Ib and Ic). Figure\u00a04-Id validated fully coated surfaces, good dispersion, and well-organized assembly of MWCNTs-LVX.\nFigure\u00a02.

Additionally, qualitative information about the distribution of various chemical elements in the nano-drug is presented in Fig.\u00a04-IIIa and b. Thereafter, the elemental map analysis revealed a good dispersion of C, N, O, and F atoms on the surface of MWCNT-LVX.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphologies and distributions of MWCNTs were investigated using TEM technique. TEM images (Fig.\u00a05-Ia-d) verified the tubular morphology of acid-treated MWCNTs, as well as the smooth and homogeneous surface. As shown in Fig.\u00a05-Ia, at\u00a0magnification of 1\u00a0\u03bcM, MWCNT-COOH has\u00a0large\u00a0agglomerates. Figure\u00a05-IIa, b, c, and d show the TEM images of MWCNT-LVX with different magnifications (1000, 300, 200, and 80\u00a0nm, respectively). The adhesion of LVX (shown with black dots in Fig.\u00a05-IIc and d) is probably occurred by various interactions, including non-covalent interactions (\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonds) with CNTs and covalent grafting with amine groups on MWCNTs-NH2. As shown in Fig.\u00a05-IIa, at\u00a0magnification of 1\u00a0\u03bcM, MWCNT-LVX has been completely dispersed. TEM images confirmed the structural integrity and a suitable distribution of LVX in the coated MWCNT-LVX.\nBrunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area analysis. In this study, the BET method was applied to describe the specific surface area based on the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. The BET surface areas, the total volume, and the mean diameter of the oxidized MWCNTs and PEGylated MWCNTs loaded with LVX were given in Table\u00a01. The study of the porous structure of samples showed the decreased pore diameter, pore volume, and surface area in MWCNT-LVX compared to MWCNT-COOH. The surface area, and pore volume play a key role in the adsorption of different bioactive molecules41. As can be seen in Table\u00a01, MWCNTCOOH has a surface area of 73.033 m2/g, and its total pore volume is 1.015 cm3/g. It was found that the BET surface area and the total pore volume of the MWCNT-LVX synthesized by the coupling of the modified oxidized MWCNTs (MWCNT-NH2) with LVX decreased, which may be due to a change in its morphology. These results proved the successful drug loading on MWCNT-COOH.\nCHN elemental analysis. As tabulated in Table\u00a02, the high percentages of H and N atoms in MWCNTNH2 were related to the correct functionalization of MWCNT-COOH. Additionally, increased nitrogen\u00a0content in MWCNT-NH2 confirmed a successful amidation reaction. The high percentages of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents in MWCNT-LVX could arise from the conjugation of LVX with amine-modified\u00a0MWCNTs. Resultantly, the successful synthesis of nano-antibiotic could be validated.\nDrug loading, in vitro drug release, and release kinetics mechanism. The standard curve of LVX solution is shown in Fig.\u00a06a. The drug entrapment of 90% and loading efficiency (LE) of 80% were reported for MWCNT-LVX. These results demonstrated the great loading capacity of MWCNTs. LVX could most probably bind to nanotubes by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, hydrophobic-hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and covalent interactions.\nFigure\u00a05.

Nano-antibiotic had a slow-release at pH 7.4 before 72\u00a0h; however, the release rapidly increased between 72 to 120\u00a0h. This phenomenon indicates that pH 7.4 is not suitable for drug delivery, as compared to pH 5.5. Furthermore, the curve at pH 10.5 demonstrated no efficient release.\n0\n0.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.004\n0.005\n0.006\n0.007\n0.008\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\nD ru\ng R\nel ea\nse (m\ng/ m\nL)\nTime of release (hr)\npH 5.5\npH 10.5\npH 7.4\ny = 29.182x + 0.045 R\u00b2 = 0.9981\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1\nA bs\nor ba\nnc e\n(3 40\nnm )\nConcentration (mg/mL)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160L og\nc um\nul at\niv e\n% d\nru g\nre le\nas e\nTime (hr)\nFirst order\npH 5.5\npH 7.4\npH 10.5\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nC um\nul at\niv e\n% d\nru g\nre le\nas e\nSquare root of time (hr)\nHiguchi model\npH 5.5\npH 7.4\npH 10.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nLo g\ncu m\nul at\niv e\n% d\nru g\nre le\nas e\nLog time (hr)\nKorsmeyer-Peppas model\npH 5.5\npH 7.4\npH 10.5\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160C um\nul at\niv e\nRe le\nas e\n(% )\nTime (hr)\nZero order\npH 5.5\npH 7.4\npH 10.5\na\nb\nc\nFigure\u00a06.

Korsmeyer-Peppas model showed the best fit and highest correlation at pH 5.5. The value of n factor in this model reflects the possible release mechanisms of drug according to\u00a0super case-II transport, which affirms the surface loss as a controlling factor of drug release. However, the kinetic analysis of drug release profile in neutral media showed that the drug-delivery system predominantly released LVX in a first-order manner with R2 value of 0.9418 (Table\u00a03). This kinetics states that alteration in concentration regarding time change is dependent on only concentration. Kinetics release in pH 10.5 did not follow any model.\nAfter an in\u00a0vitro drug release test, the FTIR spectra of all dried samples were again recorded and confirmed the differences in the functional groups in MWCNT-LVX at pH 5.5 after seven days (unpublished data). This result was in line with ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) data, though the least differences were obtained at pH 10.5.\nIn vitro antibacterial tests. As can be seen in Table\u00a0 4, the antibacterial effect of MWCNT-LVX on S. aureus at acidic pH was more appropriate than neutral and alkaline media. All wells corresponding to MWCNTNH2 and MWCNT-COOH were turbid, indicating no inhibition of bacterial\u00a0growth. Meanwhile, a\u00a0minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) test revealed no\u00a0bacterial\u00a0growth for MWCNT-LVX at pH 5.5, which confirmed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results (Table\u00a04). The control wells confirmed the complete bacterial\u00a0growth at various pHs.\nMTT assay. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 7, nano-carriers (MWCNT-NH2 with 89.83% and MWCNT-COOH with 86.98% viability) manifested very low toxicity in their highest dose. The percentages of viable cells increased in cell lines exposed to MWCNT-LVX (cell viability > 95%) relative to the amidated and oxidized CNTs, which can be justified by proper surface modifications in MWCNT- LVX conjugate. Cell viability at different concentrations of MWCNT-LVX (31.25, 62.50, 125, and 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was in the narrow range of 95.61\u201396.60%. These results confirmed the noncytotoxic effect of nano-antibiotic.\nIn vivo therapeutic efficacy of MWCNT\u2011LVX. Figure\u00a08 presents the bactericidal effects of MWCNTLVX on a burn infection model caused by S. aureus. Accordingly, MWCNT-LVX at 312.5, 156.25, and 78.125\u00a0\u03bcg/ mL concentrations showed no growth of bacterial colonies throughout the treatment.

            "text": "The current study aimed to design and synthesize a new nano-antibiotic based on the covalent functionalization of MWCNTs with LVX by the formation of the amide bonds. LVX, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is administered systemically for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated skin or skin structure infections, including burn injury43. According to the guidelines of each country, 500\u2013750\u00a0mg of oral or intravenous LVX once daily for 7\u201314\u00a0days is recommended44. This interesting candidate has several side effects, such as phototoxicity, gastrointestinal disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, tendinitis, and stimulation of the\u00a0central nervous system45,46. On the other hand, its dose adjustment is crucial in patients with impaired renal function.The topical administration of LVX can eliminate its adverse effects by decreasing required dose as a function of drug concentration in the site of infection, as well as by minimizing the first-pass effect.\nIn the past, invasive\u00a0burn wound\u00a0infections would have easily led to sepsis and death47. Although the introduction of antimicrobials played an essential role in\u00a0reducing\u00a0the mortality\u00a0rate, burn infections still can lead to a significant delay in wound healing, formation of deep scars, rejection of skin graft, prolonged hospitalization, and increased economical costs48. Early burn wound infections are related to Gram-positive bacteria, especially staphylococci that is located in hair follicles and sweat glands that strongly colonize the wound surface within the first 48 hours49,50. Gram-negative bacteria, like P. aeruginosa from an environmental source and/or the patient\u2019s endogenous gastrointestinal flora, is considered as another important cause of burn wound infections49.

However, the most common causative pathogens in complicated skin infections is S. aureus but not P. aeruginosa, with the prevalence of 46 and 11%, respectively33.\nSystemic and topical antibiotic therapies are effective in the prevention and treatment of wound infections. The failure of systemic antibiotics to prevent and treat burn wound infections is frequently described by the avascular nature of the eschar, the thickness of eschar, and the early extension of burn wounds38,51. On the other side, systemic antibiotics are widely related to resistance mechanisms, which can consequently endanger the treatment process52. Therefore, the antimicrobials are often administered topically in the forms of ointment, cream, dressings, or solutions; accordingly, they can contribute to a high and sustained concentration of the drug at the site of the infection due to its increased skin permeability53,54. Despite the potential benefits of topical antibiotic therapy, the sub-optimal outcomes are still unexploited55. Thus the necessity of innovation in the topical drug delivery field is amplified.\u00a0For this purpose, a variety of new nano-drug delivery systems has been introduced56. An ideal nano-carrier for topical drug administration should be non-toxic and biodegradable with drug controlled and sustained release ability57. In order to achieve maximum efficiency in nano-delivery systems, the proper drugcandidate selection is also of paramount importance. Nano-formulation of LVX has previously been considered by scientists for its broad-spectrum activity against various pathogens, its easy entrance to the infected sites, low dosing, and tolerable toxicity58. LVX is a hydrophilic drug that can be rapidly absorbed within the first 2 hours59, and its integration into the nano-carriers can lead to a slower release rate, thus enhancing activity.\nThe prepared nano-formulations of LVX could improve its activity against various bacterial pathogens like S. aureus58\u201362. Levofloxacin-loaded PLGA particles presented drug LEs of ~ 70% with a sustained release profile at pH 7.4 for up to 4\u20136\u00a0weeks, which inhibited the biofilm formation of S. aureus and deteriorated established biofilm58. According to the study of Montanari and coworkers, the incorporation of LVX into self-assembled hyaluronan-cholesterol nanohydrogels (LVX-NHs) displayed an activity similar to free LVX against extracellular S. aureus60. However, the intracellular antibacterial activity of LVX-NHs greatly enhanced by this drug delivery system in S. aureus-infected keratinocytes. In the same study, %50 release of LVX was observed in LVX-NHs over 5 h60. In a study conducted by Valizadeh et\u00a0al. (2021), a sesame oil nanoemulsion containing LVX was prepared, which showed some beneficial effects on various phases of the wound healing process in the diabetic ulcers of a S. aureus model61.\nCurrently, CNTs are broadly applied for the target-specific drug delivery of various pharmaceutical ingredients62,63. CNTs possess a unique feature due to their facile transport through cellular membranes64. The conjugation of drugs with CNTs can ultimately facilitate its transfer into bacterial cells, which then leads to high local drug concentration65. Siafaka et\u00a0al. (2019) prepared various LVX-loaded nanomaterials and reported LVX-loaded MWCNT had an antibacterial activity similar to LVX against S. aureus22. They identified a direct interaction between LVX and pristine MWCNTs by van der Waals forces with low drug loading (10.1%) and 40 and 100% sustained release after 2 and 24\u00a0h, respectively22. According to the mentioned studies22,58\u201361, various nano-carriers showed a range of medium to good results for the drug delivery of LVX to bacterial infections. Indeed, the selection of a suitable functional group in the nano-formulations of drugs has a crucial role and\u00a0directly affects their biological activity and physico/chemical properties66.\nPolyethylene glycols usually act as one of the most important linkers between MWCNT-COOH and ligands due to their great biocompatibility and wide applications in biomedical areas, especially drug delivery systems13,14. The PEGylation of CNTs increases their dispersity and cellular uptake, while diminishing their toxicity. Therefore, in the present study, MWCNT-LVX conjugate was synthesized based on the covalent functionalization of PEGylated MWCNTs (MWCNT-NH2) with LVX (Fig.\u00a01). The large surface area of MWCNTs permitted extremely high\u00a0drug\u00a0loading\u00a0efficiency by various interactions of LVX on the inner and outer surface of PEGylated MWCNTs (MWCNT-NH2) to construct a new nano-drug formulation, namely, MWCNT\u2013LVX (Fig.\u00a05). The BET surface area analysis could also confirm this claim (Table\u00a01). Most likely, the aromatic rings in LVX enhanced its interaction with the\u00a0polyaromatic surface of MWCNTs via hydrophobic and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions67. Hydrogen-bonding also played a significant role in the adsorption of drug by CNTs with interaction between complementary hydrogen-bonding donor and hydrogen-bonding acceptor moieties68. Additionally, the covalent attachment of LVX to the nanotubes walls occurred through the amidation of MWCNT-NH2 with carboxylic group of LVX; consequently, a high drug loading (LE = 80%) and a considerable decrease in toxicity compared to free LVX was observed.\nNotably, the backbone amide linker strategy in drug delivery systems, as a great method, is mostly used to release the active medications in the tissues, organs, and cells, as documented in literature69,70. Indeed, various proteolytic enzymes can slowly hydrolyze protease\u2010sensitive linkers, such as amide bonds, and then release drugs over a long period of time70. In the skin microbiome, commensal and pathogenic species mainly secrete proteases71. The secreted proteases from skin commensals participate in homeostatic bacterial coexistence, while pathogenic bacterial proteases are applied as virulence factors, which consequently lead to the breached integrity of the epithelial layer. Regardless of their profits and losses, these enzymes can hydrolyze amide or peptide bonds and then assist in releasing the drug from its nano-formulation on the skin.\nDrug release\u00a0behavior\u00a0is a crucial\u00a0factor in drug delivery systems. Actually, the sustained release of antimicrobial agents can help to prevent wound infection and facilitate wound healing by enhancing high local concentrations of drugs and reducing systemic toxicity72.\nThere have been some evidences about the relation between pH and wound healing73,74. Healthy skin has an acidic pH, which after burn injury, it rises to an alkaline pH. Increasing pH values in the wound surface and exudates after the burn decrease the number of normal bacterial flora but increase the number of varied species of pathogenic bacteria in the wound surface, which consequently leading to the impairment of wound healing. Some bacteria also produce ammonia, which in itself is necrotizing, and which can damage tissue oxygenation by increasing the pH74.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:10064 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14206-w\nIn burn wounds infected by S. aureus, the pH of wound exudate increases prior to the onset of clinical signs of local burn infection. It has also been identified that antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus enhances when the pH value of culture plate diminishes to 5.5 compared with a pH 7.075. Therefore, performing a rapid treatment with the continuous release of antibiotics can keep the acidic pH range and accelerate the wound healing process.\nIn our study, pH-controlled LVX delivery using MWCNT-LVX at pHs 5.5, 7.4, and 10.5 showed a pHtriggered response. A sustained and complete drug release in a gradual manner was obtained at pH 5.5 for MWCNT-LVX until the fifth day (Fig.\u00a06b). As shown in Fig.\u00a06b, the 6 and 24\u00a0h release of LVX were found to be ~ 25 and 50% in acid media (pH 5.5). LVX was also released in a slow and controlled manner at pH 7.4 after the fourth day, which was significantly less than at pH 5.5. Indeed, the noncovalent attachment of LVX to the surface-engineered MWCNTs involves hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonding interactions are weakened at low pH (5.5) and a higher amount of drug can be released76. On the other hand, the amide bonds between LVX and MWCNT-NH2 are probably hydrolyzed steadily in addition to proteolytic processes in acidic media, and the drug could be released over a long time. Based on the results, likely, none of these release processes have occurred in basic media (pH 10.5; Fig.\u00a06b). It can be concluded that MWCNTs enable the delivery of bioactive agents in a pH-triggered and/or pH-responsive manner. Besides, a single dose of nano-antibiotic (MWCNTLVX) can maintain high local drug concentration for several days and reduces multiple dose administration. The reduced dose assists in the prevention of adverse side effects and diminishes the healthcare costs associated with poisonings, which was also validated by Daughton et\u00a0al.77.\nCNTs tend to agglomerate, making their dispersion problematic in biological media. However, in the current study, MWCNT-LVX was easily dispersed in different solutions compared to CNT-NH2 and CNT-COOH. Perhaps, the covalent grafting of LVX on nanotube surfaces offers a wide menu for surface functionalization along with steric stabilization78.\nThe morphological study (Figs.\u00a04 and 5) represented the loading of drug on the external and internal surfaces of MWCNTs, while the nano-drug had preserved their tubular shapes even after the coating process with drug. In general, The FE-SEM images (Fig.\u00a04) showed different surface morphology of MWCNT-LVX compared to MWCNT-COOH. The rough and groovy surface of nano-antibiotic, compared to the smooth surface of MWCNT-COOH, might be due to the place of the drug on the surface functionalized MWCNTs by its noncovalent and covalent attachments. Considering the level of magnification achieved, FE-SEM did not show the proper dispersion of the functionalized nanotube ropes. However, TEM with high magnification could affirm the dispersion of the functionalized MWNTs, supporting the assumption that nanotube ropes via functionalization were well separated. According to the TEM analysis (Fig.\u00a05), the long and hollow tubular structures of the oxidized MWCNTs (MWCNT-COOH) were visible and interlocked with each other (Fig.\u00a05I). However, after the coating of the modified MWCNTs (MWCNT-NH2) with respective drug, a layer of the\u00a0drug loaded on the MWCNT surfaces was observed, when compared to the uncoated MWCNT-COOH (Fig.\u00a05II).\nThe internal cavities of MWCNTs provided high drug loading capacity. As seen in Fig.\u00a05I and II, in contrast to unloaded MWCNT-COOH, the hollow tubes were blocked in MWCNT-LVX by some particles, indicating the loading of drugs into these cavities. This phenomenon could be justified by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, hydrophobichydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and covalent interactions of LVX on the external and internal surfaces of MWCNTs. The FE-SEM and TEM images demonstrated that the coating is relatively uniform.\nThe possible toxicity of CNTs remains another major concern in biomedical applications. However, in this regard, Kolosnjaj-Tabi et\u00a0al. (2010) reported the safety of oral CNTs in a dose of up to 1000\u00a0mg/kg79. The available safety data also confirmed the low toxicity of CNTs through various exposure pathways80. Indeed, several parameters such as size, length, dispersibility, functionalization, administration doses, and trace metal contaminants can affect the toxicity of CNTs80,81. In the present study, the cytotoxicity results proved that PEGylated nanotube coating with LVX could tremendously improve the biocompatibility of MWCNT-LVX in comparison to MWCNT-NH2 and MWCNT-COOH.\nFunctionalization of pristine MWCNTs with carboxyl and amino groups led to diminishing MWCNTs toxicity82,83. These functionalized MWCNTs, however, exhibited a stronger tendency to form big agglomerates in protein-rich biological media82. In our study, for the preparation of the stock suspensions, the method of sonication was performed to disperse the samples in a cell culture medium, in which the nano-drug could just sufficiently be dispersed. The formation of large agglomerates of carboxylated and PEGylated-functionalized MWCNTs can be related to their increased toxicity compared to MWCNT-LVX.\nIn this study, the synthetic nano-antibiotic showed a suitable in\u00a0vitro bactericidal activity against S. aureus in comparison with P. aeruginosa at different pH levels (Table\u00a04). The MWCNT-LVX also indicated more satisfactory results against S. aureus at acidic pH, similar to the skin environment. Excellent result was observed in an in\u00a0vivo study when the nano-antibiotic solution was topically administered on S. aureus-infected burn wounds.\nThe bacterium S. aureus is able to adapt rapidly to host cells, especially immune cells, in order to increase its survival in unsuitable conditions, which in turn can lead to the failure in infection treatment. In our study, MWCNT-LVX\u00a0disrupted S. aureus\u00a0survival more effectively than LVX alone, which might be related to high drug loading and the slow release of LVX on the skin\u2019s acid mantle. Indeed, fresh burn wounds with acidic pH resulted in a sustained release of LVX and conclusively potent activity against S. aureus. In addition, there is emerging evidence of the internalization of MWCNTs in bacteria cells65,84,85. LVX exerts its antimicrobial activity via the inhibition of type II topoisomerases and ultimately through the inhibition of bacterial DNA replication against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The conjugation of LVX with MWCNTs can facilitate its transfer into bacterial cells by its internalization, giving rise to the high local concentration of LVX and its rapid bactericidal activity.\nNo skin damage or inflammation was observed in wounds treated with MWCNT-LVX, not even in the deepest layers, confirming the high safety of the new nano-antibiotic. Based on the results, we can speculate that if MWCNT-LVX is absorbed through the skin to the systemic blood circulation, it does not have any toxicity at its\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:10064 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14206-w\nlow effective dose. The results of the present study, including high drug loading, proper release profile, nontoxicity and great in\u00a0vivo antibacterial activity, showed the superiority of our study over other studies surveyed the antibacterial activity of some nano-formulations of LVX58\u201362.\nHowever, future studies will be needed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of this nano-drug on other pathogens to confirm its high efficacy. Additionally, other studies are required to be performed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and the ultimate fate of this new nano-antibiotic in the human body."

            "text": "An antibacterial nano-conjugate was successfully synthesized based on the covalent grafting of modified multiwalled CNTs with LVX, which is the\u00a0first report on this conjugation. Amino-PEG2-amine linker between MWCNT and drug enhanced the aqueous dispersity and biocompatibility of this nano-antibiotic. High drug loading and the pH-sensitive release of LVX with a suitable antibacterial activity in acidic media were observed, which affirmed MWCNT-NH2 as a promising drug delivery tool for antibacterial agents. A potent antibacterial activity was also found following\u00a0the topical\u00a0administration\u00a0of the nano-antibiotic solution on S. aureus-infected burn wounds. This new nano-antibiotic with improved biocompatibility and no toxicity can be a potential candidate for the control and treatment of wound infections\u00a0induced by S. aureus as a topical drug delivery system. Despite numerous surveys and the hopeful results on drug nano-formulations for the therapeutic management of infections, few formulations have been offered for clinical trials so far. In the field of drug delivery research, achieving an efficient delivery system with high safety, low cost, and easy manufacturing is an desirable goal. According to the results of this study, MWCNT-LVX with a simple route of preparation, no toxicity, high drug loading capacity, low effective dose, and potent activity against wound infections possess high industrialization potential. However, further studies are needed to be conducted to place such nano-formulations in the pharmaceutical market."

All methods were carried out in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines and regulations88. All experiments were reported in conformity with ARRIVE guideline 2.0.\nFunctionalization of MWCNTs. The functionalization of oxidized carbon nanotube (MWCNT-COOH) was performed according to a previous method with some modifications89. MWCNT-COOH (200\u00a0mg) along with excess thionyl chloride (30\u00a0mL) as a reagent and solvent were sonicated for 30\u00a0min\u00a0within\u00a0an ultrasonic\u00a0bath, and then the reaction mixture was refluxed at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The obtained product, acyl\u00a0chloride-functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-COCl) was then filtered under vacuum by a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter (Whatman) and washed with dry THF (3 \u00d7 50\u00a0mL) to remove the excess of thionyl chloride. The corresponding acyl chloride without further purification was immediately mixed with 1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane (2.5\u00a0mL) in 75\u00a0mL of dry THF and refluxed at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h to praper amine-functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-NH2). Subsequently, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered under vacuum on a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm PTFE filter. Finally, the resulting\u00a0precipitate (MWCNT-NH2) was washed with dry THF (3 \u00d7 50\u00a0mL) and then dried in a vacuum oven for 4\u00a0h at 50\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a09).\nSynthesis of nano\u2011antibiotic (MWCNT\u2011LVX).

The solid product (MWCNT-LVX) was washed with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50\u00a0mL) and methanol (3 \u00d7 50\u00a0mL) and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 8 h90.\n14\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:10064 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14206-w\nLoading LVX on PEGylated MWCNTs. The calibration curve of LVX was plotted based on the maximum wavelength of (\u03bbMax) 290\u00a0nm using a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (R2 = 0.9981, y = 29.182x + 0.045). Next, MWCNT-LVX and its blank sample\u00a0(without\u00a0loaded\u00a0drug) were prepared similarly according to the synthesis procedure of nano-antibiotic as\u00a0mentioned\u00a0above. After 24\u00a0h, both the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 2000\u00a0rpm (CMF 15KR, Tigra, Poland) for three times until the supernatant became colorless. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm PTFE membrane filter, and solid residues were then washed with ethyl acetate and methanol (50 \u00d7 3\u00a0mL each). Then the total\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0filtrate\u00a0plus\u00a0wash solutions were collected and measured. The absorbance of the solution was determined at 290\u00a0nm using a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (Cecil\u00a0CE\u00a01021, UK). Finally, the drug entrapment efficiency (EE) and LE were obtained using the following formulas91:\nFigure\u00a09.

To investigate the drug release of MWCNT-LVX under acidic, neutral, and basic environments, PBS was prepared at pHs 5.5, 7.4, and 10.5. Nano-drug (2.5\u00a0mg) was dispersed in dialysis bags (12\u201314\u00a0kDa MWCO, 23\u00a0mm flat width, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1\u00a0mL of PBS. Accordingly, each dialysis bag was separately immersed in 50\u00a0mL of PBS (pHs 5.5, 7.4, 10.5) and then stirred at room temperature at a speed of 80\u00a0rpm.\u00a0At various time intervals between 2 and 144\u00a0h, 1\u00a0mL of each sample was taken out to test LVX concentration at 290\u00a0nm (Cecil\u00a0CE\u00a01021, UK).

The antibacterial activity of nano-antibiotic was determined using MIC and MBC tests according to Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)94. Two different strains of pathogenic bacteria, including S. aureus (ATCC 25,923) and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27,853), were prepared from Microbial Collection (Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran) and cultured on blood agar at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight to obtain single and pure colonies. Subsequently, the optical density (OD) of bacterial suspensions were measured in the range of 600\u2013625\u00a0nm using a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer to attain 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards and then diluted (~ 106\u00a0CFU/mL). The aqueous suspensions (10\u00a0mg/mL) of MWCNT-LVX, MWCNTNH2, and MWCNT-COOH, in addition to LVX solution (1\u00a0mg/mL) were prepared. The test compounds (100 \u03bcL) were added to the first row of 96-well plates containing 100 \u03bcL of MHB, then mixed and transferred to the second row. This procedure was repeated till the last well, from which 100 \u03bcL was removed. Finally, 100 \u03bcL of the microbial suspension was added to all wells. After\u00a0incubation at 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 18 and 36\u00a0h, the turbidity of the wells were assessed, and the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration with no visible bacterial growth. For\u00a0the MBC test, 100 \u03bcL of the MIC well was streaked on the MHA plates and incubated at 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0h. The MBC value was defined as the lowest bactericidal concentration without any bacterial colony growth on the agar plate. These tests were separately performed for both strains at different pHs 5.5, 7.4, and 10.5 in triplicate.\nCell viability assay. Cell viability was evaluated on mouse fibroblast cell line L929 (NCBI C161 was obtained from the National\u00a0Cell Bank\u00a0of\u00a0Iran\u00a0[NCBI], Pasteur Institute of Iran) using MTT colorimetric assay95. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated in 90% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00a0 \u00b0C. Briefly, 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well in 100 \u03bcL of RPMI1640 medium were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, for the cells adhesion. Afterward, the culture medium was replaced with 90 \u03bcL of the samples (MWCNT-LVX [250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL]), MWCNT-NH2 [250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL], or MWCNT-COOH [250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL]) and 10 \u03bcL of FBS. The control wells contained only RPMI1640 and FBS. After 48\u00a0h, the supernatants were changed with 100 \u03bcL of MTT solution (0.5\u00a0mg/mL), and the plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the reaction solutions were removed, and the formazan crystals dissolved in isopropanol (100 \u03bcL). The plate was finally incubated on a shaker for 15\u00a0min, and the absorbance was measured at 570\u00a0nm using a microplate reader. This experiment was performed in sextuplicate, and the cell viability was calculated using the following expression:\nIn vivo antimicrobial activity of MWCNT\u2011LVX. A total of 25 female NMRI strain mice (aged almost eight weeks with bodyweight of about 30\u201335\u00a0 g) were purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Iran and kept for one week under standard conditions (24 \u00b1 2\u00a0 \u00b0C and 52% humidity) with adequate food and water. Mice were randomly divided into five equal groups, including three treatment groups and two control groups. Afterward, the S. aureus (ATCC 25,923) suspensions (approximately 105\u00a0CFU/mL) were cultured on blood agar. Mice were then anesthetized intraperitoneally [ketamine/xylazine, (5/1\u00a0mg/kg)]. Subsequently, their dorsal hair was shaved, cleaned, and disinfected with 70% (v/v) ethanol. Burn wounds (the second-degree) were created by a cylindrical metal rod (10\u00a0mm diameter, 50\u00a0g weight) which was heated to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and then pressed for 5\u00a0s on the dorsal thoracic region in the low part of the mouse body about 1\u00a0cm away from the vertebral column in the right side. The criteria to diagnosis of second degree burn were determined by major following indications including alteration of skin colour to brown, skin roughness and ruffling on the surrounding the burn wound. The injured mice were immediately placed in separate cages. After 1\u00a0h, all burn wounds were inoculated with 100 \u03bcL of the bacterial suspension (105\u00a0CFU/mL) and treated with 100 \u03bcL of LVX (0.488\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, positive control) and different concentrations of MWCNT-LVX aqueous solutions (312.5, 156.25, and 78.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) at 1\u00a0h post-infection. MWCNT-LVX solutions were dispersed completely by sonication before topical administration. The volume of the whole solution was transferred to the wound in two steps (2 \u00d7 50 \u03bcL) without any wastage. The group with no treatment was considered as a negative control. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were humanely killed, and the burned skin lesions were removed using sterile surgicassors and homogenized in 1\u00a0mL of sterile PBS. The tissue samples were serially diluted six-fold, and then all six dilutions were cultured on blood agar plates. After incubation for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, the number of colonies was counted, and the results were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of CFU/mL per skin sample96.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 22). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests followed by Tukey post-hoc test. Data were reported as a mean value with its standard deviation indicated (mean \u00b1 SD), and p-values \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nReceived: 28 October 2021; Accepted: 2 June 2022"
