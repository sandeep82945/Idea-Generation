In this study, we used Eucommia ulmoides leaf superfine powder as an additive in the fermentation of glutinous rice (Semen Oryzae Glutinosae) to develop a new healthcare product, Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine. The fermentation conditions were optimized, and the nutrient value was evaluated through analyses of metabolites, functional compositions, antioxidant capacity, and antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive abilities. The metabolic analysis demonstrated that Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine contained a large number of flavonoids and other metabolites. Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine had higher contents of flavonoid (729.0 \u00b1 0.11\u00b5g/g), free amino acids (55.0 \u00b1 0.37\u00b5g/g), polyphenol (150.0 \u00b1 0.43\u00b5g/g), and polysaccharide (0.25 \u00b1 0.03\u00b5g/g) than traditional sweet rice wine, with increases of 14.7, 2.6, 6.8, and 6.3 times, respectively. In addition, an analysis of antioxidant capacity in vitro revealed that Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine had a high level of activity in scavenging 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals, as well as in reducing iron, indicating that it was a strong antioxidant. Furthermore, Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine had a high cholate binding capacity and could significantly inhibit \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. In conclusion, this study developed a new application of Eucommia leaf in sweet rice wine fermentation and brewed Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine with strong antioxidant activity and positive antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic, and antihyperlipidemic e ects in vitro. This study suggests new opportunities for the wider use of Eucommia ulmoides leaves and adds variety to sweet rice wine.\nKEYWORDS\nEucommia ulmoides leaves, sweet rice wine, flavonoids, metabolome, antioxidant activity, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, antihypertensive\nFrontiers inNutrition 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is a plant of the family Eucommiaceae, which belongs to only one genus and is a perennial dioecious deciduous tree (1). Eucommia ulmoides leaf is a dried leaf of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (2). Eucommia ulmoides leaves are used in both medicine and food and are known for their health benefits and high nutrient content (3). Polyphenols and flavonoids are some of the main effective components of Eucommia ulmoides leaves (4, 5). They are good functional food additives and have good antitussive, expectorant, liver protection, antioxidation, and antiaging effects (6, 7). Flavonoids are a type of plant pigment that has a variety of health benefits. Since the human body cannot produce these compounds, it is important to get them from plant sources. Jia et al. extracted flavonoids from Eucommia ulmoides leaves and proved that the flavonoids in Eucommia ulmoides leaves had a stronger scavenging effect on hydroxyl free radicals and superoxide anions (8). Therefore, Eucommia ulmoides leaves have strong antioxidant activity due to the presence of flavonoids. In pharmacological studies, Eucommia ulmoides leaves contain cyclopropanoids, lignans, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and ketocompounds; thus, they have a variety of health benefits, such as hypoglycemic, hypotensive, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antiaging activities (9\u201311).\nSweet fermented rice wine, a traditional food in China, is made from steamed glutinous rice (Semen Oryzae Glutinosae) and fermented with sweet koji (12). The low-sugar contents of sweet fermented rice wine are easily absorbed by the human body and can quickly replenish energy and strengthen the stomach and the spleen (13). There are currently numerous healthcare products on the market that combine Chinese medicinal ingredients with sweet rice wine used for both medicinal and culinary purposes. Fu et al. used Taizi ginseng and glutinous rice as the main raw materials, and the brewed Taizi ginseng and glutinous rice sweet wine have a unique taste and rich nutritional value (14). It has the advantage of enhancing immune function, acting as an anti-fatigue agent, and increasing appetite (15, 16). Li et al. developed Pueraria lobata glutinous rice wine, which protects myocardial cells and improves memory and antioxidation (17). These studies suggest that the development of sweet rice wine that is good for health has greatly improved the nutritional value of traditional sweet rice wine.\nIn recent years, Eucommia ulmoides bark and Eucommia ulmoides gum have been widely developed and applied; however, the utilization rate of Eucommia ulmoides leaf is alarmingly low (18). Eucommia ulmoides leaves have been used in gruel, tea, and beverages (19, 20). However, the production of Eucommia ulmoides leaf health products is conducted in a relatively blind manner, the quality of the products is poor, and the variety of the products is inadequate (21). In addition, people\nhave increasingly paid attention to the use of non-natural antioxidant products such as drugs and food additives. As a natural plant with multiple functions, developing products from Eucommia ulmoides leaves is significant. Based on this fact, in this study, Eucommia ulmoides leaf superfine powder and glutinous rice were used as raw materials for fermentation, the fermentation processes were optimized, and the nutritional value was evaluated to obtain a functional food with a unique flavor. We believe that this study can not only improve the nutritional value of sweet fermented rice wine but also show that Eucommia ulmoides leaves can be effectively utilized. In addition, we wish to provide a new perspective on the healthy development of the Eucommia ulmoides industry."

Then, we drained the soaked glutinous rice and steamed it in a steamer for 30min. Second, the glutinous rice was dispersed in pure water and allowed to cool to approximately 35\u25e6C, after which a certain proportion of Eucommia leaf superfine powder and koji was added to the glutinous rice and stirred well. We flattened the glutinous rice balls in a fermenter, then poked a hollow in the middle of the container with a stick and filled it with a certain proportion of pure water.

The three components were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the chromatograms of the standards were obtained (Supplementary Figure 2). As shown in Figure 5, the chromatogram revealed that chlorogenic acid and catechin were not detected in the traditional sweet rice wine. For catechins, people pay the most attention to tea leaves.

Antioxidant capacity of the new product in vitro\nThe in vitro antioxidant properties of the new product were evaluated from four aspects: DPPH free radical, superoxide anion (O2-\u00b7), hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) scavenging rate, and ironreducing ability. As shown in Figure 6, Eucommia powder tea soup, the new product, traditional sweet rice wine, and ascorbic acid (Vc) all exhibited scavenging ability for those free radicals. It can be seen from the figure that, with the increase in the sample amount, the scavenging effects of Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine on DPPH, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals increased significantly, showing a certain dose-effect relationship. Among the four samples, the new product had the highest DPPH free radical scavenging ability, which was 94.80\u00b1 0.79% (Figure 6A). When the sample amount of the new product was in the range of 0.1mL to 0.5mL, the scavenging effect of O2-\u00b7increased significantly with increasing sample amount (p < 0.001).

When the sample volume was 1.0mL, the reducing power reached 1.36 times that of Vc (p < 0.001), indicating that the new product had effective reducing power (Figure 6D).

Therefore, the product development of Eucommia ulmoides leaves has good prospects. In this study, a new healthcare product, Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine, was developed. The Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine fermentation procedure was optimized to maximize the retention of the wine flavor, fragrance, and antioxidant components of Eucommia ulmoides leaves. Ultimately, a fermentation temperature of 32\u25e6C, a fermentation time of 36 h, an additional amount of koji of 1% (g), and Eucommia superfine leaf powder of 2% (g) were determined to be the best conditions for the fermentation process. This process yields sweet rice wine with a special flavor. The total number of colonies of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and other health indicators in the new product all reached the national standards for fermented wine.\nFlavonoids are a large class of polyphenol oxides and a class of structurally diverse secondary metabolites (33, 34). Numerous pharmacological studies demonstrated the antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory functions of flavonoids (35). Plant metabolomic analysis allows us to study the relationship between metabolites produced by biological\nFrontiers inNutrition 10 frontiersin.org\nprocesses and plant properties (36). Li et al. used UPLC-MS to analyze the metabolites in the different parts of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. and found a large number of flavonoids in the Eucommia ulmoides leaves (37). The findings of this study were consistent with this conclusion; 126 flavonoids with upregulated contents were determined in the metabolites of the new product, among which quercetins had the highest content, such as isoquercitrin, spiral side, hyperin, quercetin7-O-glucoside, quercetin-7-O-rutinoside, and quercetin-3-Osambubioside. Quercetin compounds are considered natural for cancer treatment (38, 39).\nAdditionally, the flavonoids with relatively different contents in the new product are also kaempferol, including nicotiflorin and astragalin. Studies found that nicotiflorin has protective effects against memory dysfunction, energy metabolism failure, and oxidative stress in patients with multiple cerebral infarctions (40). As a bioactive phytochemical with potential therapeutic activity, astragalin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, cardio-protective, anticancer, antiulcer, and antidiabetic properties, and its mechanism of\naction as a candidate drug has been studied by an increasing number of people in the past 2 years (41). These results indicated that, after the optimal fermentation process, the Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine retained a large number of active substances with antioxidant properties.\nIn recent years, numerous studies showed that the enhancement of free radical activity causes many clinical diseases and that the decrease in the body\u2019s antioxidant capacity is mostly due to the increase in the number of free radicals in the body. Eucommia ulmoides leaves contain a variety of antioxidant components, which can be developed as natural plant antioxidants and are also a hot topic in food and medicine research at present (42). In this study, DPPH, O2-, \u00b7OH, and FRAP were used to determine the free radical scavenging capacity of the new product. The new product showed high antioxidant activity, and the DPPH free radical scavenging capacity and iron-reducing capacity were higher than those of the antioxidant Vc. The scavenging rates of O2-\u00b7 and \u00b7OH were lower than that of Vc; however, the new product also presented strong scavenging rates as a kind of food.

Studies showed\nthat the total phenol content in Eucommia ulmoides leaves correlates well with its antioxidant activity (43). Liu et al.\nFrontiers inNutrition 12 frontiersin.org\nextracted polysaccharides from Eucommia ulmoides leaves and found that they had significant scavenging effects on DPPH free radicals, OH free radicals, and ABTS free radicals (44). The results of this study were consistent with the above conclusions. The new product contains a high concentration of flavonoids, and its strong antioxidant activity is mainly attributed to the presence of flavonoids, polysaccharides, polyphenols, rutin, and other compounds.\nCurrently, triple H (hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) has become a major health management problem throughout society. The inhibition of digestive enzyme (\u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase) activity is an important way to control hyperglycemia. As a large category of nonessential dietary ingredients, phenolic substances have many pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, as well as chelating digestive enzymes (45\u201347). In addition, studies found that quercetin and rutin can reduce the risk of diabetes (48\u201350). In this study, the contents of polyphenol and rutin in the new product were 150 \u00b1 0.43\u00b5g/g and 4.77 \u00b1 0.08\u00b5g/g, respectively, and many upregulated quercetin compounds are also shown in the new product. An inhibition experiment with digestive enzymes suggested that Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine had effective inhibitory activities on \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase. At a concentration of 0.1 mL/mL, the inhibitory rates were 71.24 \u00b1 2.20% and 73.23 \u00b1 1.89%, respectively, which reached 79.8% and 85.3% of acarbose, indicating that it had high hypoglycemic activity. This conclusion confirms that the high content of polyphenols, quercetin, and rutin in the Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine may be the reason for its strong antihyperglycemic effect.\nFIGURE 9 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of traditional sweet rice wine, new product, and captopril (n = 3). ***p < 0.001.\nMoreover, polyphenols can reduce hyperlipidemia by binding with bile acids, and flavonoids could decrease cholesterol, free fatty acids, and low-density lipoprotein, indicating that the latter also greatly modulates the effect on hyperlipidemia (51\u201353). The results of this study demonstrated that the flavonoid content in the new product was as high as 729 \u00b1 0.11\u00b5g/g, which was 14.7 times that of traditional sweet rice wine. In the antihyperlipidemic experiment, Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine has shown a positive binding capacity for both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate, with a higher binding capacity for sodium glycocholate. At a concentration of 1.2 mL/mL, the binding capacity reached 71.25 \u00b1 4.56%, which was much higher than that of traditional\nFrontiers inNutrition 13 frontiersin.org\nsweet rice wine (33.59 \u00b1 2.31%). This phenomenon may be related to the high content of polyphenols and flavonoids in Eucommia ulmoides leaves. ACE is a key enzyme that can cause hypertension symptoms and lead to various diseases (54). Inhibition of ACE can effectively reduce hypertension. Flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in Eucommia ulmoides leaves can effectively reduce hypertension (55). The chlorogenic acid content in the new product was 0.90 \u00b1 0.01\u00b5g/g, while it was not detected in the traditional sweet rice wine. This study suggested that Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine had a certain inhibitory effect on the ACE enzyme, which was lower than that of the drug control captopril but certainly higher than that of the traditional sweet rice wine.\nIn conclusion, our results proved that flavonoids and polyphenols are abundant components in Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine. The existence of these components provides Eucommia leaf sweet rice wine with strong antioxidant activity and positive hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and hypotensive effects."
