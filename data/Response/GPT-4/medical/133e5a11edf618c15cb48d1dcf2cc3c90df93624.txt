Longitudinal Studies on Risk Compensation Post-HPV Vaccination: Given the cross-sectional nature of the current study, longitudinal research could more accurately measure changes in sexual behavior over time among MSM after receiving the HPV vaccine. This would help to assess the duration and impact of any risk compensation behaviors and provide more definitive evidence on the causal relationships between HPV vaccination, risk perception, and sexual behaviors.

Intervention Strategies to Mitigate Risk Compensation: Designing and evaluating intervention programs that specifically aim to mitigate risk compensation behaviors among MSM who receive the HPV vaccine. These interventions could focus on enhancing condom use self-efficacy, correcting misconceptions about the HPV vaccine's protective effects, and reinforcing the importance of continued safe sex practices despite vaccination.

Comparative Studies Across Different Populations and Regions: Conducting comparative studies to explore if and how risk compensation intentions and behaviors differ across various populations and regions, including different age groups, socioeconomic statuses, and cultural contexts. Such studies could provide insights into the influence of social and cultural factors on risk compensation behaviors post-HPV vaccination.

Impact of Partner Communication and Relationship Dynamics on Risk Compensation: Investigating how communication between partners and the dynamics of their relationships influence risk compensation intentions and behaviors among MSM after HPV vaccination. Understanding the role of intimacy, trust, and mutual decision-making in condom use could inform targeted interventions to support healthy relationship dynamics and safe sexual practices.

Effectiveness of Different HPV Vaccination Messaging Strategies: Exploring the effectiveness of various communication and education strategies on HPV vaccination and risk compensation behaviors among MSM. This research could identify the most effective ways to convey information about the benefits and limitations of the HPV vaccine, addressing misconceptions and emphasizing the importance of continued safe sex practices to prevent other STIs.
