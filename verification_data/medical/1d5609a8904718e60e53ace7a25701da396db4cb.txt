The text does not explicitly mention future research directions in a direct manner. However, it discusses various aspects of phage 0105phi7-2's characteristics, its unique properties, and its implications for phage therapy and understanding phage evolution. Given the detailed exploration of phage 0105phi7-2, including its propagation, physical and chemical properties, and genomic features, the paper implicitly suggests several areas for future research:

1. **Exploration of Phage Diversity and Propagation**: The paper highlights the novel characteristics of phage 0105phi7-2, suggesting that understanding the full spectrum of phage diversity requires addressing the eccentricities of phage propagation. This implies a need for future research to develop methods for isolating and propagating phages with unique or challenging growth requirements.

2. **Investigation of Phage-Bacteria Interactions in Biofilms**: The hypothesis that phage 0105phi7-2 evolved in a biofilm environment and its unique mode of propagation in semi-solid media suggest that future studies could explore the interactions between phages and bacterial hosts within biofilms more deeply.

3. **Study of Phage Persistence in Therapeutic Contexts**: The paper discusses the low persistence of phage 0105phi7-2 in murine blood and its implications for phage therapy. This suggests a direction for future research to identify and understand the factors that contribute to phage persistence and how they affect the efficacy of phage therapy.

4. **Functional Analysis of Orfans and Genome Organization**: The genome of phage 0105phi7-2 contains a significant number of orfans and genes of unknown function. Future research could focus on elucidating the roles of these genes in the phage lifecycle, host interaction, and phage assembly.

5. **Development of Efficient Screening Methods for Phage Therapy**: The paper mentions the potential for developing criteria based on electrical surface charge density (Ïƒ) to screen out low-persistence phages for therapeutic applications. This suggests a need for research into efficient screening methods that can improve the selection of phages for phage therapy.

While these directions are derived from the discussions and findings presented in the paper, explicit statements regarding future research directions are not provided in the quoted text.
