1. **Investigate the impact of sperm and oocyte parameters on fertilization outcomes using a larger dataset.** The current study did not include detailed IVF laboratory parameters of sperm and oocytes due to data limitations. Future research could collect this information to examine the association between sperm and oocyte quality and fertilization disorders. This could help identify additional factors that contribute to TFF/LFR and improve the accuracy of the prediction model.


2. **Develop a personalized risk prediction tool for TFF/LFR based on the Bayesian network model.** The BN model developed in this study can be used to create a personalized risk prediction tool for TFF/LFR. This tool could be integrated with electronic health records to compute patients' probabilities of TFF/LFR based on their individual characteristics and medical history. This information could be used to guide clinical decision-making and improve the outcomes of IVF/ICSI treatment.


3. **Explore the use of machine learning algorithms to identify new predictors of TFF/LFR.** The BN model used in this study was based on known clinical factors. Future research could apply machine learning algorithms to identify new predictors of TFF/LFR that may not be captured by traditional statistical methods. This could lead to the development of more accurate and comprehensive prediction models.


4. **Investigate the cost-effectiveness of using the BN model to guide clinical decision-making.** The BN model developed in this study has the potential to improve the outcomes of IVF/ICSI treatment by helping clinicians identify patients at high risk of TFF/LFR. Future research could evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the BN model to guide clinical decision-making. This could help determine whether the benefits of using the model outweigh the costs.


5. **Conduct a prospective study to validate the BN model in a different population.** The BN model developed in this study was validated in a single-center retrospective cohort. Future research could conduct a prospective study to validate the model in a different population. This would help to confirm the generalizability of the model and its applicability to a wider range of patients.
