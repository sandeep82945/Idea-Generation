    "abstractText": "IMPORTANCE The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (age, <50 years) continues to increase globally within high-income countries. OBJECTIVE To examine and compare rates of synchronous neoplasia found in patients at colonoscopic diagnosis of early-onset CRC with rates found at diagnosis of average-onset CRC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multisite retrospective and cross-sectional study conducted at Mayo Clinic sites and in the Mayo Clinic Health System from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022, 150 randomly selected patients with early-onset CRC were identified from the electronic health record and matched with 150 patients with average-onset CRC based on sex and colonoscopic indication. Patients with known hereditary syndromes, past history of CRC, or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Colonoscopic findings (polyp size, number, site) and related histopathologic findings (adenoma, advanced adenoma, sessile serrated polyp) were analyzed in association with cancer clinicopathologic features and molecular data (mismatch repair status, KRAS, and BRAFV600E). RESULTS Among 300 patients (156 men [52%]), the median age at diagnosis was 43 years (IQR, 39-47 years) for those with early-onset CRC and 67 years (IQR, 57-76) for those with average-onset CRC. Overall, 85% of patients were symptomatic at CRC diagnosis. Cancer stage, grade, molecular features, body mass index, and family history did not differ significantly between these groups. Among patients with colon cancer, the overall prevalence of synchronous neoplasia was similar, yet advanced adenomas were 3 times more frequent in those with early-onset vs average-onset cancers (31 of 75 [41%] vs 10 of 75 [13%]; P < .001). This difference was not associated with cancer stage or primary location. Among patients with rectal cancer, nonadvanced adenomas were less frequent among the early-onset group than the average-onset group (21 of 75 [28%] vs 36 of 75 [48%]), and although the prevalence of advanced adenomas was similar (11 of 75 [15%] vs 14 of 75 [19%]), they were more commonly located in the rectum (early onset, 5 of 11 [45%] vs average onset, 1 of 14 [7%]). Patients with early-onset cancer of the colon were significantly more likely than those with earlyonset cancer of the rectum to have a synchronous advanced adenoma (31 of 75 [41%] vs 11 of 75 [15%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, synchronous advanced adenomas were more commonly found in patients with early-onset colon cancer compared with average-onset colon cancer, and they were distributed throughout the colon. In contrast, advanced adenomas were not increased in patients with rectal cancer and, when detected, were predominantly located in the rectum. JAMA Network Open. 2023;6(7):e2324038. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.24038 Key Points Question At colonoscopic diagnosis of colorectal cancer, do patients with earlyonset vs average-onset of disease have different rates of synchronous colorectal neoplasia? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 300 patients, patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, had significantly higher rates of synchronous advanced adenomas compared with patients with average-onset cancers. Meaning The finding of increased synchronous advanced adenomas among patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, suggests widespread field cancerization in the former, indicating biological differences by primary tumor site. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

            "text": "IMPORTANCE The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (age, <50 years) continues to increase globally within high-income countries.\nOBJECTIVE To examine and compare rates of synchronous neoplasia found in patients at colonoscopic diagnosis of early-onset CRC with rates found at diagnosis of average-onset CRC.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multisite retrospective and cross-sectional study conducted at Mayo Clinic sites and in the Mayo Clinic Health System from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022, 150 randomly selected patients with early-onset CRC were identified from the electronic health record and matched with 150 patients with average-onset CRC based on sex and colonoscopic indication. Patients with known hereditary syndromes, past history of CRC, or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Colonoscopic findings (polyp size, number, site) and related histopathologic findings (adenoma, advanced adenoma, sessile serrated polyp) were analyzed in association with cancer clinicopathologic features and molecular data (mismatch repair status, KRAS, and BRAFV600E).\nRESULTS Among 300 patients (156 men [52%]), the median age at diagnosis was 43 years (IQR, 39-47 years) for those with early-onset CRC and 67 years (IQR, 57-76) for those with average-onset CRC. Overall, 85% of patients were symptomatic at CRC diagnosis. Cancer stage, grade, molecular features, body mass index, and family history did not differ significantly between these groups. Among patients with colon cancer, the overall prevalence of synchronous neoplasia was similar, yet advanced adenomas were 3 times more frequent in those with early-onset vs average-onset cancers (31 of 75 [41%] vs 10 of 75 [13%]; P < .001). This difference was not associated with cancer stage or primary location. Among patients with rectal cancer, nonadvanced adenomas were less frequent among the early-onset group than the average-onset group (21 of 75 [28%] vs 36 of 75 [48%]), and although the prevalence of advanced adenomas was similar (11 of 75 [15%] vs 14 of 75 [19%]), they were more commonly located in the rectum (early onset, 5 of 11 [45%] vs average onset, 1 of 14 [7%]). Patients with early-onset cancer of the colon were significantly more likely than those with earlyonset cancer of the rectum to have a synchronous advanced adenoma (31 of 75 [41%] vs 11 of 75 [15%]; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, synchronous advanced adenomas were more commonly found in patients with early-onset colon cancer compared with average-onset colon cancer, and they were distributed throughout the colon. In contrast, advanced adenomas were not increased in patients with rectal cancer and, when detected, were predominantly located in the rectum.\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(7):e2324038. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.24038\nKey Points Question At colonoscopic diagnosis of colorectal cancer, do patients with earlyonset vs average-onset of disease have different rates of synchronous colorectal neoplasia?\nFindings In this cross-sectional study of 300 patients, patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, had significantly higher rates of synchronous advanced adenomas compared with patients with average-onset cancers.\nMeaning The finding of increased synchronous advanced adenomas among patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, suggests widespread field cancerization in the former, indicating biological differences by primary tumor site.\n+ Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.\nOpen Access.

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cancer and is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.1 Although the incidence of CRC continues to decrease among adults older than 50 years, likely due to population-based screening with colonoscopy,1-4 the incidence among adults younger than 50 years has steadily increased by 2% annually since the 1990s.5 Early-onset CRC, defined as diagnosis at an age younger than 50 years, currently accounts for 10% of all cases of CRCs5,6 and is estimated to account for 1 in 10 cases of colon cancer and 1 in 4 cases of rectal cancer by 2030.7 Primary tumors in early-onset CRC are located predominantly in the distal colon and rectum compared with average-onset CRC,8-10 with rectal cancer being most frequent in the US.8-10 Patients with early-onset CRC often experience a delay in diagnosis,9,11 which may account for their more advanced stage at presentation, although a more aggressive biology is suggested.9 Most cases of early-onset CRC are sporadic, and a prospective study of early-onset CRCs identified germline variants in 16% of patients, of whom approximately one-half had Lynch syndrome.12\nAlthough synchronous adenomas are often present at diagnosis among patients with CRC, sparse data exist for patients with early-onset CRC.13-15 Such data can provide insight into field cancerization16 and risk of metachronous neoplasia.17 In a study of 1522 patients with CRC, synchronous colorectal neoplasms were observed in 505 patients (33%).13,14 Colonoscopy enables the removal of established CRC precursor lesions, including adenomas, advanced adenomas, and sessile serrated lesions.18 Patients with an advanced adenoma had a 2.5-fold greater risk of subsequent development of CRC compared with those without an adenoma.19 Serrated lesions can progress through the serrated neoplasia pathway characterized by a variant in BRAF (V600E) (OMIM 164757), disruptions in Wnt signaling, and widespread CpG island methylation.20,21\nWe examined synchronous neoplasia at colonoscopic diagnosis of early-onset CRC compared with average-onset CRC given the potential insights into field cancerization and risk of metachronous CRC. We sought to test the hypothesis that patients with early-onset CRC may have lower rates of synchronous neoplasia given that adenoma prevalence increases substantially with age.22,23 We also examined synchronous neoplasia in association with primary cancer location (ie, colon vs rectum) given differences in their biology, which may affect findings at colonoscopy.8,9"

The patient list was exported, random numbers were generated and assigned for each case, and cases were sorted numerically using Excel software, version 2021 (Microsoft Corp). Each patient\u2019s EHR was then reviewed based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria until we met the projected sample size (see Statistical Analysis). Eligible patients had optical (high-definition white light) colonoscopy to the cecum with at least fair bowel preparation, with diagnosis of CRC confirmed by histopathologic findings. Exclusion criteria included patients with inflammatory bowel disease, known familial adenomatous polyposis or Lynch syndrome, 10 or more polyps at index colonoscopy, or prior CRC. A total of 150 patients with earlyonset CRC were matched with patients with average-onset colon cancer (n = 75) and rectal cancer (n = 75) based on sex and indication for colonoscopy because these factors are known to influence colonoscopic findings.24,25 Matching cases for patients with early-onset CRC were identified by consecutive review of a list of randomly selected patients with average-onset CRC until an equivalent number of matched cases was obtained. The relative proportion of early-onset to average-onset CRC cases was similar across study sites.

The study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for observational studies.\nData on synchronous neoplasia size, number, and location in the colorectum were abstracted from colonoscopy and related pathology reports that recorded histopathologic interpretation of biopsy or polypectomy specimens. Synchronous neoplasia included adenomas, advanced adenomas ( 1 cm, villous histologic characteristics, and/or high-grade dysplasia) and sessile serrated polyps. Hyperplastic polyps were excluded from the study analysis given their lack of neoplastic potential.21 Data were collected for DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status (deficient [dMMR] vs proficient [pMMR]) and BRAFV600E or KRAS (OMIM 190070; variant vs wild type [WT]) on primary CRCs. Where available, results of multigene germline testing data were also abstracted, and germline testing had been performed for patients with dMMR early-onset CRC to exclude Lynch syndrome.\nClinicopathologic variables, including sex (female vs male), primary tumor site (right [proximal to the splenic flexure] vs left), tumor grade (G3 vs G1/2), and TNM disease stage (I-IV), were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) and family history of CRC (first- and second-degree relatives) were abstracted from the EHR. Symptoms at diagnosis of CRC were also recorded."

Indications for colonoscopy were diagnostic, surveillance, and screening in 79% (n = 118), 11% (n = 16), and 11% (n = 16) of cases, respectively. Among patients with colon cancer, 118 (79%) exhibited symptoms at diagnosis. Among patients with early-onset colon cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding (24 of 59 [41%]), mostly hematochezia, followed by abdominal pain (18 of 59 [31%]) were the most common symptoms at cancer diagnosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly more common compared with patients with average-onset colon cancer (Table 1).

We hypothesized that patients with early-onset CRC may have fewer synchronous neoplasms. Among patients with colon cancer, we found that the overall number of adenomas and their left colon predominance were similar for both age groups. However, there was a 3-fold increase (41% vs 13%) in advanced adenomas among patients with early-onset compared with average-onset colon cancer whose distribution favored the left colon; this increase was not associated with cancer stage, clinicopathologic variables, or limited molecular markers. Of note, 85% of patients in the overall cohort were symptomatic at diagnosis of CRC. Among patients with early-onset colon cancer, adenomas with high-grade dysplasia were found in 20% of patients compared with 0% of patients with average-onset colon cancer. These data suggest accelerated carcinogenesis and extended field cancerization in early-onset colon cancer cases. Of 31 patients with early-onset colon cancer found to have advanced adenomas, 17 had germline testing data, and 3 patients had PGVs (1 each in BRCA1, EPCAM [monoallelic], and MUTYH [monoallelic] genes). The observed exon 5 deletion in EPCAM has not been associated with epigenetic silencing of MSH2, and the monoallelic MUTYH variant is associated with only a modest increase in CRC risk.27 Among the 10 patients with average-onset colon cancer and advanced adenomas, 3 had germline testing data, and 1 had a monoallelic MUTYH variant. Although germline data were available for only a subset of patients, such data do not suggest an explanation for the increase in advanced adenomas among patients with early-onset vs average-onset colon cancer.\nColon and rectal cancers were analyzed separately given their purported biological differences and the fact that most cases of early-onset cancers arise in the rectum in the US population.8-10 In\nTable 2.

Among patients with early-onset rectal cancer and advanced adenoma, 4 of 11 had germline testing, and no PGVs were found, as was also the case for 5 of 14 patients with average-onset rectal cancer and advanced adenomas. Comparing patients with early-onset colon cancer vs rectal cancer revealed that only patients with colon cancer were significantly more likely to have synchronous advanced adenomas. Our finding of high rates of synchronous colorectal neoplasia indicates the necessity to perform complete colonoscopy when possible, at diagnosis of early-onset CRC, or after surgery in cases with obstruction. Increased advanced adenomas among patients with colon cancer, but not among patients with rectal cancer, underscores an elevated risk of synchronous CRC.28\nRegarding risk factors for CRC, the number of first- and second-degree relatives with CRC did not differ significantly between patients with early-onset vs average-onset CRC. Although obesity appears to be a risk factor for development of CRC,29-31 BMI32-34 did not differ between patients with early-onset CRC and patients with average-onset CRC in our study. In tumor tissue, KRAS and BRAFV600E variant frequencies were similar for patients with early-onset CRC and patients with average-onset CRC, which is consistent with results for next-generation sequencing in a consecutive series of 759 patients with early-onset vs average-onset CRCs, in which their somatic tumor genomes were indistinguishable.8\nFigure 1.

Multiple etiologic factors, including dietary, lifestyle, microbial, and genetic variables, exert their influence and interactions to contribute to field cancerization and susceptibility to neoplastic development and progression. Future research in early-onset CRC is needed to identify endogenous and environmental exposures that can influence the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and microbiome or metabolome in addition to host immunity."

Accordingly, patients with early-onset colon cancer are at increased risk of synchronous and metachronous CRC, and future studies that examine rates of metachronous neoplasia are needed. Among patients with early onsetrectal cancer, however, synchronous neoplasia was not increased compared with those with average-onset rectal cancer, suggesting differences in their pathobiology.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: June 2, 2023.\nPublished: July 18, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.24038\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2023 Emiloju OE et al.
