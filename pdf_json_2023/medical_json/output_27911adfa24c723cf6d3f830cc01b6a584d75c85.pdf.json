    "abstractText": "As a zoonotic virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) poses a serious threat to human health and the breeding industry. Regarding the mechanism and complications of tissue inflammation caused by JEV, such as encephalitis and orchitis, there is no effective drug treatment currently, and the mechanism of occurrence has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of the inflammatory pathway caused by JEV. As one of the key proteins regulating cell death, BCL2 antagonist/killer (BAK) is also a necessary prerequisite for the release of cellular inflammatory factors. We found that after JEV infection, BAK-knockdown cells died less than normal cells, and the transcription levels of inflammatory factors such as TNF, IFN\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 and their corresponding regulatory genes were also significantly reduced. By further verifying protein expression on the cell death pathway, it was found that pyroptotic activation and virus titer were also significantly reduced in BAK.KD cells, suggesting that JEV proliferation might be related to BAKinduced cell death. From our data, we could conclude that JEV utilized the BAK-promoted pyroptotic pathway to release more virions after the final Gasdermin D-N (GSDMD-N) protein pore formation for the purpose of JEV proliferation. Therefore, the study of the endogenous cell death activator protein BAK and the final release pathway of JEV, is expected to provide some new theoretical basis for future research on the screening of targeted drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by JEV.",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. It is mainly found in Asian countries and causes serious brain diseases, especially in children and the elderly [1,2]. JEV is classified into five genotypes based on genetic differences [3]. Bats and birds are the natural hosts of JEV, and pigs and cattle are the amplification hosts of JEV [4,5]. Therefore, the impact of JEV on animal husbandry, especially pig farming, is particularly significant. The currently prevalent strain in Asia is the type III strain, but according to epidemiological surveys, the type I strain has gradually replaced the original strain [4]. With the replacement of new JEV strains, the virulence of their antigens may also change, so it is necessary to further clarify the pathogenic genetic mechanism of the virus to ensure the development of new target gene therapy [6]. In addition to causing animal nervous system diseases, JEV can also cause reproductive disorders in pigs, such as piglet abortion, stillbirth, and fetal mummification [7\u20139]. When the JEV in pigs reaches a certain level, it triggers a storm of inflammatory cytokines in the body, resulting in various tissue inflammatory diseases, such as encephalitis and orchitis [9]. In order to investigate whether there was an inflammatory correlation between virusinduced testicular inflammation and kidney inflammation, and whether the kidney could\nViruses 2023, 15, 974. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15040974 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 974 2 of 17\nalso induce an inflammatory storm, pig kidney epithelial cells (PK-15) were selected as the research object in this study. Tissue inflammation caused by viruses is mainly a kind of pathological damage [6]. The virus stimulates cells to produce a large number of cytokines, causing the body\u2019s immune system to overreact, killing normal cells and infected cells [10]. As we know, the BCL2 antagonist/killer (BAK) is one of the key proteins in cell death and has been shown to play a key role in the viral regulation of cell death and inflammatory activation [11]. Taking pyroptosis as an example, when cells are stimulated by death signals, BAK can shed the \u03b12 helix structure and complete activation [12], aggregate in the form of oligomers in the outer mitochondrial membrane to form pores, release second messengers, such as ROS, mtDNA, and cytochrome c; and then activate proteins on subsequent death pathways [13,14]. When released into the cytoplasm, they activate proteins of the cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease (caspase) family [15], which associate with other pro-death proteins, such as ASC and NLRP3, to form inflammasomes [16]. Completely cleavage and activate caspase-1, promote terminal inflammatory factor IL-1\u03b2, etc., activate cell pyroptotic porin GSDMD [17,18]. However, regardless of whether it is stimulated by the virus or not, in BAK-mediated downstream death mechanisms, once pyroptosis and apoptosis occur simultaneously, the disease will often be aggravated. When cell apoptosis is dominant and a small part of cell pyroptosis occurs, diseases such as autophagy and a loss of cardiac function will occur, while when cell pyroptosis is dominant, tissue inflammation diseases such as atherosclerosis and sepsis will appear [19\u201321]. Therefore, judging the type of cell death, exploring the mechanism of virus-induced cell death and the purpose of its utilization are great breakthrough points in the current disease treatment. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to obtain BAK.KD cells, and it was identified that the expression of the BAK protein was significantly reduced. Based on the findings, JEV promoted BAK-mediated MOMP at peak viral titers while activating the Caspase1-NLRP3-GSDMD-mediated pyroptotic pathway and releasing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IFN, and TNF. In contrast, this pathway was significantly inhibited in BAK.KD cells, and the viral load of JEV was greatly reduced, suggesting that BAKmediated pyroptosis might be involved in JEV proliferation. This is also the question that this study aims to explore. In conclusion, JEV also exhibits the ability to modulate inflammatory cytokine pathways when infecting non-neuronal cells. Moreover, when the virus life cycle reaches assembly and release, JEV may induce BAK activation to promote cell pyroptosis and release inflammatory factors while releasing JEV, so as to achieve the purpose of virus proliferation. The final GSDMD protein inhibitor treatment demonstrated a proliferative effect of pyroptosis on JEV proliferation. This may provide a new idea for the targeted therapy of JEV tissue inflammation in the future, and also provide a certain theoretical basis for inhibiting virus death and virus release."

Then, the genes of infected cells were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing, and we found that the impact score of BAK gene transcription was higher in JEV-infected cells. To further explore the mechanism of influence, we chose to knockdown BAK. Using the online CRISPR editing website (http://crispr.mit.edu/, accessed on 17 September 2019), a pair of sgRNAs targeting the porcine BAK gene were designed, and the BAK.KD cell line with one base missing in the original sequence was obtained (Figure 1B). BAK.KD cells were tested and validated (Figure 1C), demonstrating a significantly reduced level of BAK protein expression (p < 0.001). Although there might still be a small amount of BAK protein, a significant reduction in the level of JEV gene replication had been found in BAK.KD cells. We also constructed a BAK eukaryotic expression plasmid and exogenously induced BAK expression. During BAK gene complementation, JEV gene duplication was found to increase with BAK (Figure 1D). PK-15 and BAK.KD cells were then incubated with EDU for 2 h under the same conditions. No significant differences were found in the percentage of EDU-positive cells under fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that BAK.KD did not have differential effects on cell proliferation (Figure 1E). Subsequently, BAK.KD and normal cells were infected with JEV virus titers at MOI = 1, and the growth curves of JEV were measured. The results are shown in Figure 1F, the viral copy number of JEV in normal cells peaked at 48 h, and the proliferation of JEV was significantly inhibited in BAK.KD. Meanwhile, at the protein level (MOI = 1, 48 hpi), it was also shown (Figure 1G) that the JEV E protein was significantly inhibited. It was observed that the BAK could affect the proliferation of JEV.\nViruses 2023, 15, 974 7 of 17Viruses 2023, 15, x 8 f 18\nViruses 2023, 15, 974 8 of 17\nwas transfected into cells for BAK gene complementation experiments.

            "text": "According to virus genome copy numbers, we chose 24 h and 48 h as the time points for detecting gene changes in order to detect changes in the transcriptional levels of BAKrelated cytokine genes after JEV infection. We detected the relative content of JEV E genes in infected cells (Figure 2A) and found that the proliferation rate of JEV in BAK.KD was much lower than that of normal cells, which was consistent with the trend of the virus\u2019s growth curve. The results of inflammatory gene detection are shown in Figure 2B. During the 24 h period of JEV infection, the inflammatory factors in the cells show an upward trend. However, the transcription levels of cytokine genes measured at 48 h changed significantly, including caspase family proteins, interleukin family, interferon and other pathway proteins, indicating that the JEV infection induced cellular autoimmune responses, resulting in a large number of inflammatory responses. After infection with JEV, the gene transcription levels of caspase-3 and caspase-8 showed an upward trend in both normal cells and BAK.KD cells, but whether this is related to JEV-induced apoptosis needs further verification. In addition, under the stimulation of JEV infection, the transcription level of BAK gene in normal cells significantly increased, but after the knockdown of the BAK gene, the transcription level of the JEV E gene significantly decreased. It was speculated that BAK might promote the proliferation of JEV. Furthermore, we found that a reduced BAK expression might lead to increased BAX expression to complement BAK function and activate subsequent pathways. Although the transcription of other related inflammatory cytokines increased, it was still far below the normal cellular level and was significantly suppressed. It was also shown that in the late stage of JEV proliferation, it promoted cell death by inducing BAK (mainly BAK protein).\nViruses 2023, 15, 974 9 of 17i , , x 10 of 18\nFigure 2.

            "text": "Since its discovery, the infection hosts of JEV include humans and large livestock, and the pathological diseases are diverse, which brings a huge burden to social health and agricultural development, so it has received extensive attention [24]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the molecular mechanism of JEV-induced cell inflammation and the impact of JEV on inflammation in other tissues. During infection, a large number of cells rupture and die, and the release of inflammatory factors has been identified as one of the important causes of tissue inflammation [25]. BAK-regulated MOMP is a key point that ultimately leads to cell death, including apoptosis and pyroptosis (Figure 6). This regulation plays an important role in tumor development and neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases [26]. When BAK is activated by the apoptotic signal, it will aggregate into oligomers, form pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane, and then release ROS and cytochrome C [27,28]. Once these factors enter the cytoplasm, they activate the caspase family of proteins, cascading the activation of the final cell death pathway. The activation of BAK is strongly associated with the final cell death pathway, especially after viral infection [29]. It has been found that a variety of viruses infect cells, and BAK can be used to regulate the time and scale of cell death, thereby achieving virus proliferation [30]. While this may be just the tip of the iceberg of cellular utilization by viruses, it also highlights the important role of BAK in influencing the life cycle of certain viruses. Our results showed that the activation of BAK in normal cells promoted the release of cellular inflammatory factors, while the viral load and inflammatory cytokines in BAK.KD cells significantly decreased, indicating that BAK promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines. In other words, pyroptosis might promote JEV proliferation. In this study, we successfully constructed a BAK.KD cell line. The fluorescence quantification of gene changes in JEV-infected normal and BAK.KD cells was determined in different time periods. These data showed that JEV could stimulate the activation of NF\u03baB upstream genes IRF3 and IRF7, and the upstream genes of interferon pathway RIG-1\nViruses 2023, 15, 974 14 of 17\nand TLR7; the caspase family, such as caspase-1 and caspase-9; and other genes significantly increased after infection in normal cells, indicating that the inflammatory responses of cells did become stimulated after JEV infection. However, after the JEV infection of BAK.KD cells, these genes were significantly repressed to varying degrees. Considering that the presence of BAX after BAK knockdown may complement the pro-apoptotic function of BAK, as well as the activation of other inflammatory pathways, it is reasonable to explain the reason for the upward trend of inflammatory factors in BAK.KD cells [27,31]. By measuring the gene expression of BAK and BAX, we found that the amount of the BAK gene was lower in BAK.KD cells, while the expression of BAX changed little in normal cells and increased significantly in BAK.KD cells, confirming our suspicion. Meanwhile, by exogenously expressing BAK and BAX, we found that BAX did not have much difference in JEV gene replication, so we paid more attention to the induction of BAK. Viruses 2023, 15, x 16 of 18\nFigure 6. When JEV enters the release phase of the life cycle, JEV can promote BAK activation to activate the MOMP process. Subsequently, the release of ROS promotes the combination of procaspase-1, ASC, and pro-NLRP3 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome, forming an activated form of caspase-1. Then, caspase-1 activates inflammatory factors such as IL-1\u03b2 and cleaves the N-segment of the GSDMD protein. Finally, the GSDMD-N protein aggregates on the cell membrane to form pores, releasing IL-1\u03b2 and virions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.W. and W.X.; Methodology, W.X., K.Y. and Y.Z.; Soft-\nware, Y.W.; Validation, W.X. and Q.Z., Y.L. and S.Z.; Formal Analysis, S.D.; Reviewing and editing,\nR.W. and W.X.; Funding acquisition, S.C. and Q.Y.
