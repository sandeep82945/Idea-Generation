Comparative Studies of CDFHCD with Current PDAC Therapies: Future research could involve conducting comparative studies of the CDFHCD complex against current standard PDAC treatments, such as FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxel. These studies could evaluate not only efficacy in terms of tumor reduction and survival rates but also compare side effect profiles and quality of life outcomes for patients.

Mechanism of Action and Molecular Pathways: While the paper outlines the effects of CDFHCD on cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and CSC markers, deeper investigations into the precise molecular mechanisms by which CDFHCD exerts its anticancer effects could be enlightening. This could include studies on its interaction with specific signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and others relevant to PDAC progression and resistance mechanisms.

Clinical Trials of CDFHCD in PDAC Patients: Moving forward towards clinical application, initiating phase I/II clinical trials to assess the safety, optimal dosing, and preliminary efficacy of CDFHCD in PDAC patients would be a critical next step. These trials could help translate the promising in vitro and in vivo results into a clinical setting, providing valuable data on how CDFHCD performs in human subjects.

Development of Targeted Delivery Systems for CDFHCD: Enhancing the delivery of CDFHCD specifically to pancreatic cancer cells could further improve its therapeutic index. Research could focus on developing nanoparticle-based delivery systems, including liposomes or polymeric nanoparticles, which could be functionalized with targeting moieties to selectively deliver CDFHCD to PDAC cells or the tumor microenvironment.

Combination Therapies Involving CDFHCD: Investigating the potential synergistic effects of combining CDFHCD with other anticancer agents or treatment modalities (such as radiation therapy) could uncover effective combination therapies for PDAC. Studies could focus on identifying combinations that effectively target multiple pathways involved in PDAC progression, resistance, and metastasis, potentially leading to more effective treatment strategies.
