INTRODUCTION\nExactly solvable spin Hamiltonians such as toric codes (TC) in two and three dimensions [1\u20133] and the X-cube model in three dimensions [4\u20136] have been studied extensively. The multi-spin interactions that define various exactly solvable spin models seem at first novel, but in fact have well-defined roots in their corresponding parent lattice gauge theories (LGT) [7\u20139]. The mutually commuting operators in the LGT - also known as generators - become, through Higgsing, the stabilizer operators in the spin Hamiltonian. Various rank-1 and rank-2 U(1) LGTs and their Higgsed spin models have been analyzed, and it was shown that the parent theory of the TC is the rank-1 U(1) LGT, while that of the X-cube model is the rank-2 U(1) LGT [8]. The elementary excitations of the toric code are the electric and magnetic quasiparticles exhibiting mutual anyonic statistics, while those of the X-cube model are the fractons and lineons. Fractons are immobile but deconfined in the sense that a single fracton cannot move without extra energy cost, but a four-fracton cluster can be expanded arbitrarily without extra energy. Lineons are subdimensional quasiparticles that can only move freely along a specific axis and are also deconfined [4].\nIn an attempt to extend the realm of exactly solvable spin models, two of the present authors proposed a model [10] exhibiting features akin to those of the threedimensional toric code (3DTC) as well as the X-cube model. The new model is obtained from the 3DTC by including an additional twelve-spin interaction which, in\n\u2217Electronic address: hanjemme@gmail.com\nthe context of the X-cube model, acts as a fracton operator. Excitations in this new model consist, at first sight, of the two kinds of elementary excitations of the 3DTC, augmented by the fracton excitation similar to that in the X-cube model. In a previous publication [10] these excitations were dubbed freeons, fluxons, and fractons, respectively, and hence we will call the overall model \u2018F3 model\u2019. It was also shown [10] that the model is exactly solvable only for the Z3 Hilbert space at the links of the lattice, and the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the model is 33, same as the GSD of the Z3 3DTC. In other words, the F3 model remains in the same phase as the 3DTC despite the addition of the local fracton operators. A physical way to understand this is that fractons that are deconfined in the X-cube model become confined in the F3 model because fluxons act as \u2018gluons\u2019 between fractons with energy that increases linearly with separation. The confinement of fractons in the F3 model is an indication that the low-energy field theory of the F3 model is more likely to resemble that of 3DTC than that of the X-cube model. We will show that this is indeed the case.\nNeither the parent LGT of the F3 model nor its lowenergy field theory was properly understood in the previous work [10]. We show in this paper that the F3 model is the descendant of the hybrid rank-1 and rank-2 U(1) LGTs. The field theory of the F3 model is constructed accordingly. In Sec. II we review the rank-1 and rank-2 U(1) LGTs, their descendant exactly solvable spin models, and the corresponding effective field theories (EFTs). Although the discussions in this section overlap with several works in the past, we find it useful to collect known results and present them in a unified fashion, thus paving the way for the development of EFT of the F3 model. Some new insights as well as new results about the toric\n2 code and X-cube model in three dimensions are obtained. In Sec. III we adopt the strategies developed in Sec. II and apply them to the F3 model. The parent LGT of the F3 model is properly identified and is shown to lead to the F3 stabilizer Hamiltonian upon Higgsing. The gauge transformation properties of the various gauge fields are clarified and subsequently exploited to derive the field theories of the matter fields and the gauge fields pertinent to the F3 model. Section IV gives the summary. Several technical themes are delegated to the appendices."

(2.3)\nImportantly, we have the commutativity of the two generators\n[\n(\u2207 \u00b7E)i , B a j\n]\n= 0, (2.4)\nfollowing from their definitions. The Hamiltonian produced from Higgsing such rank-1 U(1) LGT is precisely the 3DTC. The Higgsing is given by\nXa,i = exp(\u22122\u03c0iE a i /p), Za,i = exp(iA a i ) (2.5)\nfor a = 1, 2, 3 corresponding to a = x, y, z, respectively. The generalized Pauli operators X,Z obey the commutation algebra\nZX = \u03c9XZ (\u03c9 = e2\u03c0i/p) (2.6)\nfor integer p \u2265 2. The Zp 3DTC [2] is defined as\nH3DTC = \u2212 \u2211\ni\n(Ai + C x i + C y i + C z i ), (2.7)\nwhere\nAi = 1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(ai) j Cai =\n1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(cai ) j\nai = X1,iX \u22121 1,i\u2212x\u0302X2,iX \u22121 2,i\u2212y\u0302X3,iX \u22121 3,i\u2212z\u0302 cxi = Z2,iZ3,i+y\u0302Z \u22121 2,i+z\u0302Z \u22121 3,i cyi = Z3,iZ1,i+z\u0302Z \u22121 3,i+x\u0302Z \u22121 1,i czi = Z1,iZ2,i+x\u0302Z \u22121 1,i+y\u0302Z \u22121 2,i . (2.8)\nElectric quasiparticle is the excitation of Ai while magnetic quasiparticles labeled as ma (a = x, y, z) are the excitations of Cai . The EFT for 3DTC is the well-known BF theory, but the treatment of the EFT for the matter fields, i.e., electric and magnetic excitations, is not given with equal care in the literature. Here we derive the EFTs of both matter and gauge fields for the 3DTC and derive the corresponding continuity equations. Furthermore, a tight-binding realization of the e-particle and m-particle is given by invoking the gauge principle. The effective action of the e quasiparticles is the usual one,\nLe = i\u03c8 \u2020 e\u2202t\u03c8e \u2212\n1\n2me |De\u03c8e|\n2, (2.9)\nwith De\u03c8e = (\u2207 \u2212 iA)\u03c8e. Its form is dictated by the requirement of invariance under the gauge transformation \u03c8e \u2192 e\nif\u03c8e and A \u2192 A + \u2207f . The mass me is introduced by hand. The EFT of the ma quasiparticles is more involved,\nLm = i\u03c8 \u2020 m \u00b7 \u2202t\u03c8m \u2212\n1\n2mm\n\u2211\na<b\n|Dabm\u03c8 a m\u03c8 b m| 2, (2.10)\nwith \u03c8m = (\u03c8 x m, \u03c8 y m, \u03c8 z m) representing the three species of magnetic quasiparticles. The covariant derivative Dabm must be chosen to comply with the rule of gauge invariance, as follows (no sum on a, b):\nDabm\u03c8 a m\u03c8 b m = \u03c8 a m\u2202a\u03c8 b m \u2212 \u03c8 b m\u2202b\u03c8 a m\n\u2212 i \u2211\nc\n\u01ebabcE c\u03c8am\u03c8 b m. (2.11)\nThe gauge invariance of the action under \u03c8am \u2192 e iga\u03c8am and Ea \u2192 Ea+ \u2211\nbc \u01ebabc\u2202bg c can be readily checked. The\n3 action is quartic in the fields and implies that the quasiparticles are inherently interacting. It is well-known that magnetic excitations in the 3DTC always form loops [2], which one can now understand as a consequence of the strongly interacting nature of the magnetic quasiparticles.\nSome conservation laws of electric and magnetic quasiparticles follow from the matter action:\n\u2202t\u03c1 e +\u2207 \u00b7 je = 0,\n\u2202t\u03c1 ma +\n\u2211\nb\n\u2202b[j m]ab = 0. (2.12)\nExplicit expressions of the charge and current densities in terms of the matter fields can be found in the Appendix A. The electric part of the conservation law is nothing out of the ordinary. For the magnetic part, a vector of charges \u03c1m = (\u03c1mx , \u03c1my , \u03c1mz) and the corresponding antisymmetric tensor current [jm]ab give rise to an unusual form of continuity equation. In fact, one can write the current tensor in a vector form j = ([jm]yz, [jm]zx, [jm]xy), introduce the vector charge density \u03c1m = (\u03c1mx , \u03c1my , \u03c1mz), and simplify the continuity equation of the magnetic particles:\n\u2202t\u03c1 m +\u2207\u00d7 j = 0. (2.13)\nA natural corollary of this equation is that \u2202t(\u2207 \u00b7 \u03c1 m) = 0, consistent with the fact that magnetic excitations in 3DTC only form closed loops. The construction of EFTs for the matter parts of the 3DTC and the corresponding continuity equations are not treated in the literature, and we presented them in some detail here.\nThe Lagrangian reflecting the commutation relation of the gauge fields (Aai , E b j ) and the conservation laws in Eq. (2.12) is the three-dimensional BF theory. The action can be cast in the four-vector continuum notation (\u01eb0123 = +1) [11]:\nLBF = p\n2\u03c0 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd\n1 2 E\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u00b5A \u03bd \u2212A \u00b7 je \u2212 1 2 E\u03b1\u03b2 [jm] \u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(2.14)\nwhere A and je are four-vectors, A = (A0,A), je = (\u03c1e, je), and E\u03b1\u03b2 and [jm] \u03b1\u03b2\nare antisymmetric tensors whose definitions are written out in Appendix A. The four-current densities of electric and magnetic quasiparticles are denoted je and [jm]\u00b5\u03bd , respectively. The commutation relation and the gauge transformations of the Aa and Eab are\n[Aa(r),Ebc(r\u2032)] = 2\u03c0i\np \u01ebabc\u03b4\n3(r \u2212 r\u2032)\nA(r) \u2192 U \u2020AA(r)UA = A(r) +\u2207f(r)\nEab(r) \u2192 U \u2020EE ab(r)UE = E ab(r)\u2212 \u2202ag b(r) + \u2202bg a(r), (2.15)\nand the gauge transformations of the temporal components A0 and Ea0 are\nA0(r) \u2192 A0(r) + \u2202tf(r)\nEa0(r) \u2192 Ea0(r)\u2212 \u2202ag 0(r) + \u2202tg a(r). (2.16)\nAccordingly, A \u00b7 je and 12E \u03b1\u03b2 [jm] \u03b1\u03b2 transform under the gauge transformations as\nA \u00b7 je \u2192 A \u00b7 je + \u2211\n\u00b5\n\u2202\u00b5f [j e]\u00b5\n1 2 E\u03b1\u03b2 [jm]\u03b1\u03b2 \u2192 1 2 E\u03b1\u03b2 [jm]\u03b1\u03b2 + 1 2 (\u2212\u2202\u03b1g \u03b2 + \u2202\u03b2g \u03b1)[jm]\u03b1\u03b2 .\n(2.17)\nApplying integration by parts to the two equations in Eq. (2.17) leads to the conservation laws of e and m quasiparticles as well as the identity \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c1m = 0. The BF action for the 3DTC is well-known, but the approach that starts from the explicit construction of the matter Lagrangian followed by the identification of various conservation laws is new, and we outline the derivation in Appendix A. We can construct a lattice version of the matter field action of the 3DTC by following the gauge principle. For the electric quasiparticle, the usual Peierls substitution\n[\u03c8e] \u2020 i+a\u0302[\u03c8e]ie iAai (2.18)\nyields gauge-invariant hopping of the electric operator \u03c8e. On the other hand, the gauge transformations of the E field and magnetic quasiparticle operators \u03c8m = (\u03c8xm, \u03c8 y m, \u03c8 z m) on the lattice are given by\nEabi \u2192 E ab i \u2212 g b i+a\u0302 + g b i + g a i+b\u0302 \u2212 gai ,\n[\u03c8m]i \u2192 (e igxi [\u03c8xm]i, e igyi [\u03c8ym]i, e igzi [\u03c8zm]i), (2.19)\nand the corresponding gauge-invariant hopping terms must take the form\n[\u03c8xm] \u2020 i+y\u0302 [\u03c8 y m] \u2020 i [\u03c8 x m]i[\u03c8 y m]i+x\u0302e iExyi ,\n[\u03c8ym] \u2020 i+z\u0302 [\u03c8 z m] \u2020 i [\u03c8 y m]i[\u03c8 z m]i+y\u0302e iEyzi , [\u03c8zm] \u2020 i+x\u0302[\u03c8 x m] \u2020 i [\u03c8 z m]i[\u03c8 x m]i+z\u0302e iEzxi (2.20)\nand their Hermitian conjugates. No single-particle hopping is allowed for magnetic particles; only their correlated hopping involving two species of m quasiparticles at a time is allowed under the gauge principle."

(2.23)\nOne can easily prove the commutativity [(DE)i, B a j ] = 0.\nThe Hamiltonian produced from Higgsing the rank-2 U(1) LGT is the X-cube model. Before introducing the Higgsing formula, we need to redefine the notation of tensor fields. There are, in fact, only three independent components in the tensors Aab and Eab and they can be mapped to vector fields\n(Ayzi , A xz i , A xy i ) \u2192 (A x i , A y i , A z i ) (Eyzi , E xz i , E xy i ) \u2192 (E x i , E y i , E z i ). (2.24)\nThen, the Higgsing of the rank-2 U(1) LGT is performed by (a = x, y, z or a = 1, 2, 3)\nXa,i = exp(iA a i ), Za,i = exp(2\u03c0iE a i /p). (2.25)\nCompared to the Higgsing formula used in Eq. (2.5) for the toric codes, the roles of X and Z operators have been switched in Eq. (2.25). This is by design and will be crucial in constructing the hybrid (F3) model. The Zp X-cube model [4] is defined as\nHXC = \u2212 \u2211\ni\n(Axi + A y i + A z i + Bi). (2.26)\nThe mutually commuting Hermitian projectors Aai and Bi are represented as\nA a i =\n1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(aai ) j Bi =\n1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(bi) j , (2.27)\nusing a set of mutually commuting unitary operators (axi , a y i , a z i , bi) in the p-dimensional Hilbert space of spins constructed as\na x i =X3,iX \u22121 3,i\u2212y\u0302X \u22121 2,iX2,i\u2212z\u0302, a y i =X1,iX \u22121 1,i\u2212z\u0302X \u22121 3,iX3,i\u2212x\u0302, a z i =X2,iX \u22121 2,i\u2212x\u0302X \u22121 1,iX1,i\u2212y\u0302,\nbi =Z1,i+y\u0302+z\u0302Z \u22121 1,i+y\u0302Z \u22121 1,i+z\u0302Z1,i\n\u00d7Z2,i+x\u0302+z\u0302Z \u22121 2,i+x\u0302Z \u22121 2,i+z\u0302Z2,i \u00d7Z3,i+x\u0302+y\u0302Z \u22121 3,i+x\u0302Z \u22121 3,i+y\u0302Z3,i. (2.28)\nIn particular, axi a y i a z i = 1 following fromB x i +B y i +B z i = 0 of the parent LGT.\nThe two types of elementary excitations in the X-cube model are called la-quasiparticles (a = x, y, z) and fractons. The la-quasiparticles are the excitations of the A a i operators while fractons are those of the Bi operator defined in Eq. (2.27). The integer-valued charges of laquasiparticles and fractons are denoted by \u03c1la and \u03c1f , and are respectively determined as the eigenvalues of the operators\nA a i (n) =\n1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(\u03c9\u2212naai ) j , Bi(n) =\n1\np\np\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\n(\u03c9\u2212nbi) j .\n(2.29)\nThe eigenstate |\u03c8la\u3009 with a la quasiparticle is defined as Aai (\u03c1 la)|\u03c8la\u3009 = |\u03c8la\u3009 and Bi(\u03c1 f )|\u03c8f \u3009 = |\u03c8f \u3009 defines the eigenstate with a fracton excitation. In other words, |\u03c8la\u3009(|\u03c8f \u3009) is an eigenstate of a a i (bi) with eigenvalue \u03c9\u03c1 la (\u03c9\u03c1 f ).\nThe term lineon is used to refer to the excitation in the X-cube model that can move freely only in a particular direction. They can be defined in terms of the la-quasiparticles just defined, as the eigenstates satisfying\n(x) :Axi (0)|\u03c8x\u3009 = A y i (\u2212\u03c1 x)|\u03c8x\u3009 = A z i (\u03c1 x)|\u03c8x\u3009 = |\u03c8x\u3009 , (y) :Axi (\u03c1 y)|\u03c8y\u3009 = A y i (0)|\u03c8y\u3009 = A z i (\u2212\u03c1 y)|\u03c8y\u3009 = |\u03c8y\u3009 , (z) :Axi (\u2212\u03c1 z)|\u03c8z\u3009 = A y i (\u03c1 z)|\u03c8z\u3009 = A z i (0)|\u03c8z\u3009 = |\u03c8z\u3009 .\n(2.30)\nThe x, y, z lineons denoted by (x), (y), (z) with charges \u03c1x, \u03c1y, \u03c1z are respectively defined as having the eigenvalues (0,\u2212\u03c1x, \u03c1x), (\u03c1y, 0,\u2212\u03c1y), and (\u2212\u03c1z, \u03c1z, 0) of the la-quasiparticles. In other words, lineons are composite excitations consisting of a pair of la-quasiparticles. Hence the la-quasiparticles are the more fundamental excitations and we proceed to construct field theories for them, with the lineon dynamics emerging as a natural by-product.\nThe matter field Lagrangian of fractons and la-\n5 quasiparticles can be derived as\nLf = i\u03c8 \u2020 f\u2202t\u03c8f \u2212\n1\n2mf\n\u2211\na<b\n|Dabf \u03c8f | 2,\nLl = i\u03c8 \u2020 l \u00b7 \u2202t\u03c8l \u2212\n1\n2mm\n\u2211\na\n|Dal \u03c8l| 2, (2.31)\nwhere \u03c8f and \u03c8l = (\u03c8 x l , \u03c8 y l , \u03c8 z l ) represent the fracton and the three species of la-quasiparticle fields, respectively. The covariant derivatives are given as\nDabf \u03c8f = \u03c8f\u2202a\u2202b\u03c8f \u2212 \u2202a\u03c8f\u2202b\u03c8f + i \u2211\nc\n|\u01ebabc|A c\u03c8f\nDxl \u03c8l = \u03c8 z l \u2202x\u03c8 y l \u2212 \u03c8 y l \u2202x\u03c8 z l + iE x\u03c8yl \u03c8 z l D y l \u03c8l = \u03c8 z l \u2202y\u03c8 x l \u2212 \u03c8 x l \u2202y\u03c8 z l + iE y\u03c8xl \u03c8 z l Dzl \u03c8l = \u03c8 x l \u2202z\u03c8 y l \u2212 \u03c8 y l \u2202z\u03c8 x l + iE z\u03c8xl \u03c8 y l . (2.32)\nOne can readily check their gauge covariance under \u03c8f \u2192 eif\u03c8f , \u03c8 a l \u2192 e iga\u03c8al , as well as A ab \u2192 Aab \u2212 \u2202a\u2202bf and Eab \u2192 Eab + \u2211\nc \u01ebabc(\u2202cg b \u2212 \u2202cg a). Various covariant derivatives given here, while straightforward to show, were not derived previously. The continuity equations of la-quasiparticles and fractons follow from the matter Lagrangians (2.31) as\n\u2202t\u03c1 f \u2212\n\u2211\na<b\n\u2202a\u2202b[j f ]ab = 0\n\u2202t\u03c1 la +\n\u2211\nbc\n\u01ebabc\u2202c[j l]c = 0. (2.33)\nHere \u03c1f and \u03c1la are respectively the densities of fractons and la-quasiparticles, and [j\nf ]ab and jl, respectively a symmetric tensor and a vector, represent the current density of the fracton and la-quasiparticles. These conservation laws, first mentioned in Ref. 5, are rigorously derived from the matter field Lagrangian in Eq. (2.31). Charge and current density expressions in terms of matter fields are written in Appendix B. The EFT of the XC model can be constructed by incorporating the conservation laws of quasiparticles by means of Lagrange multipliers:\nLXC = p\n2\u03c0\n\u2211\nabc\n|\u01ebabc| 1\n2 Aab\u2202tE\nc \u2212 1\n2\n\u2211\nab\nAab[jf ]ab \u2212E \u00b7 jl\n+ p\n2\u03c0 Ea0\n(\n\u2211\nbc\n\u01ebabc\u2202cA ab \u2212\n2\u03c0\np \u03c1la\n)\n+A0 ( p\n2\u03c0\n\u2211\nabc\n|\u01ebabc| 1\n2 \u2202a\u2202bE\nc \u2212 \u03c1f ) . (2.34)\nThe sum is over spatial indices. The commutation relation and the gauge transformation of the Aab and Ea in Eq. (2.34) are\n[Ea(r), Abc(r\u2032)] = |\u01ebabc| 2\u03c0i\np \u03b43(r \u2212 r\u2032)\nAab(r) \u2192 Aab(r) + \u2202a\u2202bf Ea(r) \u2192 Ea(r)\u2212 \u01ebabc\u2202ag c, (2.35)\nWe have given the derivation of the Lagrangian (2.34) starting from the matter Lagrangian and the subsequent conservation laws in Appendix B. The Lagrangian appears identical to the one given in Ref. 5, but there is a subtle difference in the way the constraints are enforced. In order to properly embed the conservation laws of la-quasiparticles and fractons as well as the identity \u2211\na \u03c1 la = 0 in the Lagrangian, the gauge transformations\nof A0 and Ea0 must be\nA0(r) \u2192 A0(r) + \u2202tf(r)\nEa0(r) \u2192 Ea0(r) + \u2202tg a(r) + g0(r). (2.36)\nConservation laws of la-quasiparticles and fractons follow from requiring gauge invariance of the Lagrangian. In particular, the gauge transformation involving g0 gives the term g0 \u2211\na \u03c1 la , which leads to the constraint\n\u2211\na \u03c1 la = 0. 1\nThe lattice model for fracton fields \u03c8fi can be constructed from the gauge principle. Given that fracton fields couple to A which transforms as Aabi \u2192 A ab i \u2212 fi\u2212a\u0302\u2212b\u0302 + fi\u2212a\u0302 + fi\u2212b\u0302 \u2212 fi [Eq. (2.21)], we write down the gauge-invariant hopping of the fractons as\n(\u03c8f )\u2020 i\u2212b\u0302 (\u03c8f )\u2020i\u2212a\u0302\u03c8 f i\u2212a\u0302\u2212b\u0302 \u03c8fi e iAabi (2.37)\nand its Hermitian conjugate. The fracton motion clearly preserves the center-of-mass, or the dipole moment. Note that this is a three-dimensional extension of the quadrupole model studied in the context of quadrupole topological insulators [12, 13]. The la-quasiparticles coupled to the E\nab fields which transform as in Eq. (2.21) have the gauge-invariant hopping terms\n(\u03c8lx)\u2020i (\u03c8 ly )\u2020i+z\u0302\u03c8 lx i+z\u0302\u03c8 ly i e iExyi ,\n(\u03c8ly )\u2020i (\u03c8 lz )\u2020i+x\u0302\u03c8 ly i+x\u0302\u03c8 lz i e iEyzi , (\u03c8lz )\u2020i (\u03c8 lx)\u2020i+y\u0302\u03c8 lz i+y\u0302\u03c8 lx i e iEzxi (2.38)\nand their Hermitian conjugates. The first line, for instance, clearly shows that a z-lineon motion is made by the coordinated motion of the lx and ly quasiparticles in the opposite directions along the z-axis. The lattice formulation of the fracton and lineon dynamics coupled to the rank-2 gauge fields was not discussed previously, while their derivation is quite straightforward from the gauge principle as shown above."

            "text": "There are two types of terms in the X-cube model, and we ask if any of them can be added onto the 3DTC without violating the exact solvability. One sees readily that the addition of the magnetic field terms aai from the Xcube model [Eq. (2.28)] to the 3DTC poses a problem because they in general fail to commute with the magnetic flux operators cai in the 3DTC: [a a i , c a\u2032\nj ] 6= 0. The Gauss\u2019s law operator Bi of the X-cube model obviously commutes with the magnetic fields Cai of the 3DTC as they are built out of the same Z operators. On the other hand, the Bi\u2019s commute with the Gauss\u2019s law operator Ai of the 3DTC only if the local Hilbert space dimension is p = 3 since commuting the two operators results in the phase \u03c93, which equals one only for p = 3 or its multiple. This is the compatibility condition between the Gauss\u2019s laws of the rank-1 and rank-2 U(1) LGTs. When the compatibility condition is fulfilled, we obtain a new, exactly solvable spin Hamiltonian\nHF3 = \u2212 \u2211\ni\nAi \u2212 \u2211\ni\nBi \u2212 \u2211\ni,a\nCai , (3.1)\nwhich is the F3 model [10]. This model is the sum of the 3DTC (Ai and C a i ) and the Gauss\u2019s law Bi of the X-cube model. The quasiparticle excitations associated with Ai,Bi and C a i were respectively dubbed the freeon, fracton, and the fluxon, hence the F3 model. One can think of F3 as the 3DTC modified by the presence of the cube term \u2212 \u2211\ni Bi. Despite the additional term, the logical operators of the F3 model are identical to those of the 3DTC and consequently they share the same GSD. This observation will permeate the field-theoretic discussion that follows as well. We can derive the F3 model by Higgsing the gauge theory of two vector gauge fields Ai and Ei which satisfy the commutation relation [Aai , E b j ] = i\u03b4ij\u03b4ab. One can identify the three \u201cmutually commuting\u201d generators, (\u2207\u00b7 A)i, (\u2207\u00d7E)i, and (DE)i, given by\n(\u2207 \u00b7A)i \u2261 \u2211\na\n(Aai \u2212A a i\u2212a\u0302)\n(\u2207 \u00d7E)i \u2261 \u2211\nb,c\n\u01ebabc(E b i \u2212 E b i+c\u0302)\n(DE)i \u2261 E z i+x\u0302+y\u0302 \u2212 E z i+x\u0302 \u2212 E z i+y\u0302 + E z i\n+ Exi+y\u0302+z\u0302 \u2212 E x i+y\u0302 \u2212 E x i+z\u0302 + E x i + Eyi+x\u0302+z\u0302 \u2212 E y i+x\u0302 \u2212 E y i+z\u0302 + E y i . (3.2)\nOne can recognize the first two generators as those of the rank-1 LGT in Eq. (2.3), except for the reversal of the roles A \u2194 E. The rank-2 U(1) generator (DE)i is taken from Eq. (2.23). In fact, we do not have strict commutativity of all three operators since the explicit\ncalculation shows\n[(\u2207 \u00b7A)i, (DE)j ] = 3i(\u03b4ij + \u03b4i,j+x\u0302+y\u0302 + \u03b4i,j+x\u0302+z\u0302\n+ \u03b4i,j+y\u0302+z\u0302 \u2212 \u03b4i,j+x\u0302 \u2212 \u03b4i,j+y\u0302\n\u2212 \u03b4i,j+z\u0302 \u2212 \u03b4i,j+x\u0302+y\u0302+z\u0302). (3.3)\nNevertheless, we can show that the commutativity is recovered after the Higgsing, thus justifying the use of \u201cmutually commuting\u201d operators in parenthesis. The Higgsing formula is given by\nXa,i = exp(iA a i ), Za,i = exp(2\u03c0iE a i /p). (3.4)\nOne can easily identify\nexp((\u2207 \u00b7A)i) \u2261 ai\nexp(2\u03c0i(DE)i/p) \u2261 bi\nexp(2\u03c0i(\u2207\u00d7E)ai /p) \u2261 c a i (3.5)\nas the ai, bi, c a i operators of the F3 model. By virtue of Eq. (3.3), we see that the commutator [(\u2207 \u00b7A)i, (DE)j ] equals +3i,\u22123i or 0, and therefore [ai, bj ] = 0 provided p = 3.

Since the generators do not commute, [(\u2207 \u00b7 A)i, (DE)j ] 6= 0, neither do the unitary operators UAUE 6= UEUA. An explicit calculation shows\n7 [ \u2211\nj\nf0j (DE)j , \u2211\ni\ngi(\u2207 \u00b7A)i] = \u22123i \u2211\ni\ngi[f 0 i + f 0 i\u2212x\u0302\u2212y\u0302 + f 0 i\u2212y\u0302\u2212z\u0302 + f 0 i\u2212z\u0302\u2212x\u0302 \u2212 f 0 i\u2212x\u0302 \u2212 f 0 i\u2212y\u0302 \u2212 f 0 i\u2212z\u0302 \u2212 f 0 i\u2212x\u0302\u2212y\u0302\u2212z\u0302]\n= \u22123i \u2211\ni\nf0i [gi + gi+x\u0302+y\u0302 + gi+y\u0302+z\u0302 + gi+z\u0302+x\u0302 \u2212 gi+x\u0302 \u2212 gi+y\u0302 \u2212 gi+z\u0302 \u2212 gi+x\u0302+y\u0302+z\u0302].

We thus obtain valid definitions of unitary operators UA and UE with [UA, UE] = 0 under the (mild) restriction on the gauge functions f0i or gi. Such a restriction is lifted when we turn off f0i = 0 and the model becomes identical to 3DTC. These transformation rules (and the constraint on the gauge functions) will play a vital role in identifying the field theory description of the F3 model."

            "text": "The F3 model was derived from the hybrid of the rank1 and rank-2 U(1) LGTs. We now apply the gauge principle to derive the appropriate EFT of the F3 model. There are three types of quasiparticle excitations in the F3 model called the freeons, fractons, and fluxons, which are the excitations of the Ai, Bi, and C a i operators. We will use e, f , m to express the quantities related to freeons, fractons, fluxons, respectively. First of all, the gauge transformation ofA andE in the continuum field theory follows directly from the lattice transformation rules given in Eq. (3.6)\nAa(r) \u2192 U \u2020AA a(r)UA\n= Aa(r)\u2212 1\n2\n\u2211\nbc\n|\u01ebabc|\u2202b\u2202cf 0(r)\u2212 (\u2207\u00d7 f(r))a\nE(r) \u2192 U \u2020EE(r)UE = E(r)\u2212\u2207g(r). (3.10)\nThe two unitary operators\nUA = exp\n[\ni\n\u222b\nd3r ( f0(r)DE(r) + f(r) \u00b7\u2207\u00d7E(r) )\n]\nUE = exp\n[\ni\n\u222b\nd3rg(r)\u2207 \u00b7A(r)\n]\n, (3.11)\nf = (fx, fy, fz), are the continuum descendants of the lattice operators given in Eq. (3.7). In particular, we have DE = \u2202x\u2202yE z + \u2202y\u2202zE x + \u2202x\u2202yE\nz. As in the lattice consideration, the two unitary operators commute provided we choose either \u2202x\u2202y\u2202zf 0(r) = 0 or\n\u2202x\u2202y\u2202zg(r) = 0. Such condition is fulfilled by choosing f0 or g to be the sum of functions that depend on at most two of the coordinates but not on all three. The freeon field \u03c8e transforms as U \u2020 E\u03c8eUE = e\nig\u03c8e under the constraint\n\u2207 \u00b7A = \u03c1e = \u03c8 \u2020 e\u03c8e. (3.12)\nIt behaves in the same way as the electric quasiparticle in the 3DTC with the matter field Lagrangin in Eq. (2.9) and the continuity equation \u2202t\u03c1\ne +\u2207 \u00b7 je = 0. The other quasiparticles, i.e. fracton and three species of fluxons, can be grouped as \u03c8\u00b5 (\u00b5 = 0 for fracton, \u00b5 = x, y, z for fluxons) and transform as\n\u03c8\u00b5 \u2192 U \u2020A\u03c8 \u00b5UA = e if\u00b5\u03c8\u00b5 (3.13)\nunder the constraints\nDE(r) = \u03c1f , \u2207\u00d7E = \u03c1m (3.14)\nwhere \u03c1m = (\u03c1mx , \u03c1my , \u03c1mz). A gauge-invariant Lagrangian can be constructed as\nLf = i \u2211\n\u00b5\n(\u03c8\u00b5)\u2020\u2202t\u03c8 \u00b5 \u2212\n1\n2m\n\u2211\na<b\n|Dab\u03c8|2 (3.15)\nwith the covariant derivatives given by\nDxy\u03c8 = \u03c8x\u03c8y\u03c80\u2202x\u2202y\u03c8 0 \u2212 \u03c8x\u03c8y\u2202x\u03c8 0\u2202y\u03c8 0\n+ (\u03c80) 2 [\u03c8x\u2202x\u03c8 y \u2212 \u03c8y\u2202y\u03c8 x + iAz\u03c8x\u03c8y]\nDxz\u03c8 = \u03c8x\u03c8z\u03c80\u2202x\u2202z\u03c8 0 \u2212 \u03c8x\u03c8z\u2202x\u03c8 0\u2202z\u03c8 0\n+ (\u03c80) 2 [\u03c8z\u2202z\u03c8 x \u2212 \u03c8xf\u2202x\u03c8 z + iAy\u03c8y\u03c8z]\nDyz\u03c8 = \u03c8y\u03c8z\u03c80\u2202y\u2202z\u03c8 0 \u2212 \u03c8y\u03c8z\u2202y\u03c8 0\u2202z\u03c8 0\n+ (\u03c80) 2 [\u03c8y\u2202y\u03c8 z \u2212 \u03c8z\u2202z\u03c8 y + iAx\u03c8y\u03c8z]. (3.16)\nThey are quartic in the matter fields and involve the interaction between fractons and fluxons. (The Lagrangian itself is octic in the matter fields.) Once the fracton field is turned off by taking \u03c80 = 1, we recover the covariant derivative of the 3DTC given in Eq. (2.11), which again reveals the 3DTC root of the F3 model. The conservation laws following from the Lagrangian in Eq. (3.15) are\n\u2202t\u03c1 f = \u2202x\u2202yj z + \u2202x\u2202zj y + \u2202y\u2202zj x,\n\u2202t\u03c1 m = \u2207\u00d7 j. (3.17)\n8 The quasiparticle density and the current operators are given by\n\u03c1f = (\u03c80) \u2020 \u03c80\n\u03c1m = ((\u03c8x)\u2020\u03c8x, (\u03c8y)\u2020\u03c8y, (\u03c8z)\u2020\u03c8z)\njx = 1\n2mi\n[\n(\u03c8y)\u2020(\u03c8z)\u2020(\u03c80) \u2020 (\u03c80) \u2020 Dyz\u03c8 \u2212 h.c.\n]\njy = 1\n2mi\n[\n(\u03c8z) \u2020 (\u03c8x) \u2020 (\u03c80) \u2020 (\u03c80) \u2020 Dxz\u03c8 \u2212 h.c.\n]\njz = 1\n2mi\n[\n(\u03c8x) \u2020 (\u03c8y) \u2020 (\u03c80) \u2020 (\u03c80) \u2020 Dxy\u03c8 \u2212 h.c.\n]\n. (3.18)\nFirst of all, note that \u2202t\u03c1 m = \u2207 \u00d7 j is identical to the conservation of magnetic charges in Eq. (2.13). Furthermore, the constraint \u03c1m = \u2207 \u00d7 E given in Eq. (3.14) implies \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c1m = 0, i.e. the magnetic excitations must form closed loops. Time derivatives of both fracton (\u03c1f ) and the fluxon (\u03c1m) densities are related to the same current density vector j in Eq. (3.17), which goes to show that fractons and fluxons are not independent entities in the F3 model, but are intertwined objects through the definitions of the current operators j given above and the continuity equation given in Eq. (3.17). Having established the EFT of the freeon, fracton, and fluxon matter fields, we proceed to construct the gauge field Lagrangian. The starting point, as usual, is the constraints relating the matter and the gauge degrees of freedom:\n(\u2207 \u00b7A)i = 2\u03c0\np \u03c1ei , (\u2207\u00d7E)i = \u03c1 m i , (DE)i = \u03c1 f i .\n(3.19)\nTaking the time derivatives on both sides of the equations and invoking the continuity equation of freeons in Eq. (2.12), and of fluxons and fractons in Eq. (3.17), we obtain three relations\n(\u2207 \u00b7 \u2202tA)i = \u2212(2\u03c0/p)(\u2207 \u00b7 j e)i\n(\u2207 \u00d7 \u2202tE)i = (\u2207\u00d7 j)i\n\u2202t(DE)i = (\u2202x\u2202yj z + \u2202y\u2202zj x + \u2202x\u2202zj y)i (3.20)\nthat are solved by\n\u2202tAi = \u2212 2\u03c0\np jei \u2202tEi = ji. (3.21)\nLuckily the second and the third equations in Eq. (3.20) share the same solution, providing consistency to the whole approach we take. The Lagrangian that embodies both Eqs. (3.19) and (3.21) is readily constructed:\nLF3 = Ei \u00b7 \u2202tAi +Ai \u00b7 ji + 2\u03c0\np Ei \u00b7 j\ne i\n+ p\n2\u03c0 E0i\n( \u2207 \u00b7A\u2212 2\u03c0 p \u03c1e ) i +A0i \u00b7 ( \u2207\u00d7E \u2212 \u03c1m ) i\n+A0i\n( DE\u2212 \u03c1f )\ni . (3.22)\nSeveral Lagrange multipliers, (E0, A0,A0), are introduced to implement the Gauss constraints relating the gauge fields to the matter fields. By redefining A\u2192 \u2212A and \u2212(2\u03c0/p)E \u2192 E, one can rewrite the F3 Lagrangian as\nLF3 = p\n2\u03c0 E \u00b7 \u2202tA\u2212A \u00b7 j \u2212E \u00b7 j\ne\n\u2212 p\n2\u03c0 E0\n( \u2207 \u00b7A+ 2\u03c0 p \u03c1e ) \u2212A0 \u00b7 ( p 2\u03c0 \u2207\u00d7E + \u03c1m )\n\u2212A0 ( p\n2\u03c0 DE+ \u03c1f\n)\n= LBF \u2212A 0 ( p\n2\u03c0 DE+ \u03c1f\n)\n, (3.23)\nclearly showing LF3 as the action of the 3D toric code LBF given in Eq. (2.14), supplemented with an additional constraint through the Lagrange multiplier A0. The constraint in turn ties the fracton density \u03c1f to the local configuration of the E through the relation DE+\u03c1f = 0. Note that there is no other term in the effective action that depends on the fracton degrees of freedom. The current j is also defined as a fracton-fluxon composite object as seen in Eq. (3.18). All these features are indications that fracton dynamics is \u2018parasitic\u2019 to that of fluxons, and the overall dynamics resembles that of 3D toric code. The commutation relation and the gauge transformation of the A and E in Eq. (3.23) are\n[Aa(r), Eb(r\u2032)] = 2\u03c0i\np \u03b4ab\u03b4\n3(r \u2212 r\u2032)\nAa(r) \u2192 U \u2020AA a(r)UA\n= Aa(r) + 1\n2\n\u2211\nbc\n|\u01ebabc|\u2202b\u2202cf 0(r) + (\u2207 \u00d7 f(r))a\nE(r) \u2192 U \u2020AA a(r)UA = E(r) +\u2207g(r) (3.24)\nwhere UA and UE are\nUA = exp\n[\n\u2212 ip\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nd3r ( f0(r)DE(r) + f(r) \u00b7\u2207\u00d7E(r) )\n]\nUE = exp\n[\n\u2212 ip\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nd3rg(r)\u2207 \u00b7A(r)\n]\n. (3.25)\nThe gauge transformations of A0, A0, and E0 are\nA0(r) \u2192 A0(r) + \u2202tf(r) +\u2207f \u2032(r)\nA0(r) \u2192 A0(r) + \u2202tf 0(r)\nE0(r) \u2192 E0(r) + \u2202tg a(r). (3.26)\nConservation laws of quasiparticles in Eq. (3.17) as well as the identity \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c1m = 0 follow from requiring the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian in Eq. (3.23) under the gauge transformations in Eqs. (3.24) and (3.26). This completes the derivation of the EFT for the F3 model. We only need to discuss the lattice model for fractonfluxon matter fields \u03c8\u00b5i because the lattice model for the freeon field is simply the expression in Eq. (2.18). Considering the transformation of A field given in Eq. (3.6),\n9 the appropriate gauge-invariant hoppings are\n(\u03c80)\u2020i\u2212y\u0302(\u03c8 0)\u2020i\u2212z\u0302\u03c8 0 i\u2212y\u0302\u2212z\u0302\u03c8 0 i (\u03c8 z)\u2020i\u2212y\u0302(\u03c8 y)\u2020i\u03c8 z i \u03c8 y i\u2212z\u0302e iAxi\n(\u03c80)\u2020i\u2212z\u0302(\u03c8 0)\u2020i\u2212x\u0302\u03c8 0 i\u2212z\u0302\u2212x\u0302\u03c8 0 i (\u03c8 x)\u2020i\u2212z\u0302(\u03c8 z)\u2020i\u03c8 x i \u03c8 z i\u2212x\u0302e\niAyi\n(\u03c80)\u2020i\u2212x\u0302(\u03c8 0)\u2020i\u2212y\u0302\u03c8 0 i\u2212x\u0302\u2212y\u0302\u03c8 0 i (\u03c8 y)\u2020i\u2212x\u0302(\u03c8 x)\u2020i\u03c8 y i \u03c8 x i\u2212y\u0302e iAzi\n(3.27)\nand their Hermitian conjugate. By comparing to Eq. (2.20) and Eq. (2.37), one can see that the fracton part \u03c80 hops in the manner of a fracton in the X-cube model, while \u03c8a (a = x, y, z) hop as the three magnetic charges in the 3D toric code. As seen in Eq. (3.2), the same E field is used to define both the fluxon and the fracton charges, but these two charges are tightly bound and move as composite objects, as the above tight-binding model clearly shows. This, as well as the effective field theory of the F3 model given as the sum of the BF model plus a constraint as in Eq. (3.23) indicates that both F3 and the toric code share the same universal physics."

We show that the F3 model follows from Higgsing the hybrid of rank-1 and rank-2 U(1) lattice gauge theories in three dimensions. By consistently applying the gauge principle, we are able to derive the matter and the gauge field Lagrangian for the F3 model in the continuum and also in the lattice form. It turns out the effective field theory of the F3 model is that of the 3D toric code modified by a term, and describe the same universal physics. As a by-product, we construct the matter field Lagrangians both in the continuum and in the lattice form for the well-known 3D toric code and the X-cube model as well."
