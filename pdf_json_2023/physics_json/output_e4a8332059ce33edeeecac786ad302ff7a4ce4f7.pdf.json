Many knowledge-based (KB) computational approaches have been developed to predict beneficial mutations, but their accuracy leaves room for improvement. Thermodynamic integration (TI) is an alchemical free energy algorithm that offers an alternative technique for identifying beneficial mutations, but its performance has not been evaluated. In this study, we developed an efficient TI protocol with high accuracy for predicting binding free energy changes of antibody mutations. The improved TI method outperforms KB methods at identifying both beneficial and deleteriousmutations. We observed that KBmethods have higher accuracies in predicting deleterious mutations than beneficial mutations. A pipeline using KB methods to efficiently exclude deleteriousmutations and TI to accurately identify beneficial mutations was developed for high-throughput mutation scanning. The pipeline was applied to optimize the binding affinity of a broadly sarbecovirus neutralizing antibody 10-40 against the circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant. Three identified beneficial mutations show strong synergy and improve both binding affinity and neutralization potency of antibody 10-40. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the three mutations improve the binding affinity of antibody 10-40 through the stabilization of an altered binding mode with increased polar and hydrophobic interactions. Above all, this study presents an accurate and efficient TI-based approach for optimizing antibodies and other biomolecules.\nKEYWORDS\nthermodynamics integration, antibody design, antibody 10-40, SARS-CoV-2, molecular dynamics simulation\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Antibodies are immune system proteins that recognize versatile foreign- and self-biomolecules. Antibody biotherapeutics have been growing fast for the treatment and prophylaxes of infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (1\u20133). Compared to small molecule drugs, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have multiple advantages such as high potency and specificity, metabolic stability, and low antigenicity (4). Many therapeutic antibodies require further improvement in specificity and binding affinity through mutagenesis of antibody residues at or close to the antigen binding site (5\u20137). Computational algorithms, promising for the cost-efficient identification of beneficial amino acid mutations, are now in high demand (8). Currently, many physicsand knowledge-based (KB) algorithms have been developed for structure-based antibody optimization (9, 10). Most computational approaches score the effects of mutations by computing the relative binding free energy (RBFE) difference between the wildtype and mutant states (7, 10\u201313). Despite many antibodies being successfully optimized by computational approaches (7, 14\u201316), the predicted RBFE has a weak correlation with experimental data (17), resulting in a low success rate of identifying affinityenhancing mutations.\nThermodynamic integration (TI) is an attractive alchemical free energy (AFE) algorithm that predicts RBFE of small molecule ligands with high accuracy (Pearson\u2019s r ~0.8 and root mean square error (RMSE) ~1kcal/mol) (18, 19). Whether TI can be applied to protein design has not been thoroughly investigated. TI uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and statistical mechanics to detect free energy alterations in biomolecule systems caused by mutations in a small subset of atoms (20). Briefly, TI uses an alchemical transformation to gradually mutate the selected residue to another amino acid through multiple steps in the presence and absence of a receptor, with a coupling parameter l (ranging from zero to one) controlling the pathway of transformation. The free energy difference between states, DG0TI, is calculated by integrating the generalized force along the transformation pathway. TI then uses the thermodynamic cycle to compute the RBFE difference (DDG) between the wildtype and mutant states. With the improvement in the force field and sampling algorithm, TI performs comparably to another AFE methodology, free energy perturbation (FEP) (18, 19), which has been sophisticatedly optimized in commercial software FEP+ (9, 21). But FEP+ is not open-source and cannot be parallelized on a large scale (due to tokens).\nAFE algorithms have advantages over KB algorithms in calculating the RBFE of protein-protein interaction by more precisely describing many factors contributing to the interaction energy. For example, contributions of remote conformational modulation, protein flexibility, solvation, water-mediated interaction, cofactors, post-translational modifications, and ions are poorly approximated or not incorporated by KB algorithms. TI and other physics-based methodologies solve the above issues by monitoring energy changes of proteins and cofactors in an explicit solvent environment with molecular mechanistic force fields, capturing protein dynamics with high accuracy. Thus, TI has the\nFrontiers in Immunology 02\npotential for a robust and accurate prediction of the RBFE of protein mutations.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, continues to evolve new variants that evade immune recognition (22, 23). Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that can tolerate viral mutations are critical for therapeutics and vaccine efficacy (24, 25). 10-40, a nAb isolated from a COVID-19 convalescent donor, broadly neutralizes sarbecoviruses by recognizing a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike to block cellular entry (26). 10-40-like or class nAbs - originates from a similar V(D) J recombination and binds a similar epitope - represent one major component of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine elicited antibodies that can broadly neutralize sarbecoviruses (27). However, compared to nAbs targeting other RBD sites, all isolated 10-40-like antibodies show relatively weak potency against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants of concern (26, 28). Whether the neutralization potency of 10-40-like antibodies can be improved against the circulating omicron subvariants is unclear.\nIn this study, we developed a TI protocol with a substantially improved accuracy for predicting beneficial mutations, which is superior to KB methods. A pipeline incorporating both TI and KB methods was established to perform saturation mutagenesis. The pipeline successfully identified beneficial mutations that improve both the binding affinity and neutralization potency of antibody 10-40. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed the structural basis of the synergistic effects of three beneficial mutations. This study developed and validated a TI-based approach for antibody improvement."

            "text": "the relative binding affinity of antibody mutations\nTo evaluate the performance of TI on predicting the RBFE of antibody mutations, we applied the conventional TI protocol (19) with 12 l windows and the single topology approach, developed on small molecule ligand/receptor systems, to predict the RBFE of 38 mutations from three antibody/antigen systems (Figures 1A, B). Briefly, the TI protocol performs energy minimization, heating from 100K to 298K, system relaxation, equilibration, and production of MD (See details in Methods). The experimentally determined structures were used as the starting structures for mutagenesis and energy minimization (Table S1). The last snapshot of the previous step was used as the starting coordinate of the next step.\nThe 38 mutations include a balanced number of beneficial and detrimental mutations, all of which are within or peripheral to the epitope-paratope interface (Table S1). The analysis revealed that when mutating to negatively charged amino acids, the mutated residue forms clash with positively charged ions in the solution at one or a few l windows, resulting in large jumps in the l-derivative of the total energy (dV/dL) and the inaccurate prediction of the\nfrontiersin.org\nRBFE (Figures 1C, S1A). The incorporation of the recently developed smooth step function (18), which weighs dV/dL using a specified formula, substantially reduces the energy spike and improves the predicted RBFE (Figure S1B). Despite that, the predicted RBFEs of some mutations still deviated from the experimental RBFEs by more than 1.5kcal/mol. Further analysis showed that the predicted RBFEs with large errors tend to harbor l windows with significant dV/dL deviation between the antibodybound and -unbound systems (Figure 1D). Excluding such l windows [identified using deviation from mean dV/dL by one standard deviation (SD)] further improved the prediction performance (Figure S1C). By incorporating the above strategies, the conventional TI protocol was applied to predict the RBFE of the 38 mutations with 5 nanosecond (ns) production run per lwindow. The results showed that the performance of the conventional TI protocol converges in 3 to 4ns of MD simulation, which is\nFrontiers in Immunology 03\ncomparable to the convergence time for predicting small molecule RBFE (19).\nThe conventional TI protocol showed a Pearson\u2019s r of approximately 0.55 and a root mean square deviation (RMSE) of approximately 1.8kcal/mol (Figures 1E, F), which is not comparable to its performance on a small molecule RBFE prediction and is not ideal for antibody design. Because antibody/antigen complexes have system sizes much larger than small molecule/receptor complexes, we suspect that the conformation sampling of the antibody/antigen complexes may be inadequate using conventional MD. Thus, we applied the Hamilton replica exchange MD (HREMD) (29, 30), which allows for the exchange of intermediate states between adjacent l windows during MD simulation to enhance sampling convergence. The results showed that HREMD substantially improved the performance of TI (Pearson\u2019s r 0.74 and RMSE 1.05kcal/mol with 3ns MD) (Figures 1E, F).\nB C\nD E F\nA\nFIGURE 1 Diagram and the performance of thermodynamics integration protocols.

(C) Clash between Na+ and S56DL (PDBID: 2BDN) in MD with the conventional TI protocol leads to a large free energy spike (see Figure S1A). (D) HREMD TI protocol contains l windows with large dV/dL deviation between antigen- bound and unbound MD runs. (E) Correlation of experimental measured binding free energy change (DDG) and DDG predicted by conventional and HREMD TI protocols with different MD simulation lengths. (F) Root mean square error (RMSE) between experimental measured DDG and DDG predicted by conventional and HREMD TI protocols with different MD simulation lengths.\nfrontiersin.org\nWe further used the one antibody-antigen system (human MCP-1/antibody 11K2, 2BDN, Table S1) to examine the impacts of MD length (up to 10ns), the number of l windows, and the sizes of the waterbox on the accuracy of the HREMD TI protocol. The results showed that comparable DDG RMSEs were obtained with 3ns and 10ns MD (Figure S1D), suggesting that a longer MD may not improve the accuracy. Increasing the number of l windows from 12 to 16 reduced both Pearson\u2019s r and RMSE. Changing the size of the waterbox from 6\u00c5 to 10\u00c5 increased Pearson\u2019s r but reduced RMSE (Figure S1D). By considering both the computation time and accuracy, HREMD TI with 3ns MD, 12 l windows, and 6\u00c5 waterbox were performed for the downstream studies.\nThe above performance was evaluated by averaging the RBFEs of each mutation from two independent TI runs. Our analysis showed that each single run can still reach high accuracy (3ns HREMD Pearson\u2019s r 0.72 and 0.65) with a mean deviation of 0.90kcal/mol between runs. This suggests that a single TI run has a reasonable accuracy, which can be used for mutational screening and will save substantial computation time.\nAbove all, we found that our strategies significantly improved the performance of TI on antibody/antigen complexes and identified settings optimal for both the accuracy and efficiency of HREMD TI, which will be used for downstream studies.\nThe performance of the HREMD TI protocol on a large dataset\nTo further examine the accuracy of the HREMD TI protocol, we established a curated dataset of 225 point mutations from 15 antibody/antigen complexes from both public databases (SKEMPI and AB-BIND: 171 mutations from 10 complexes) and literature (54 mutations from 5 complexes) (6, 10, 31, 32) (Table S1). These antibody/antigen complexes were chosen because each has mutations to diverse types of amino acids and has both favorable and deleterious mutations. In total, 55 favorable (DDG< -0.5kcal/ mol) and 119 deleterious mutations (DDG>0.5kcal/mol) were included. The cutoff of 0.5kcal/mol was used to account for the uncertainty of experimental binding affinity measurements (9). A total of 36 mutations are from antigens and the rest are from antibodies. Mutations both within and away from the binding interfaces were included (Table S1).\nThe result showed a single run HREMD TI to have a high accuracy (Pearson\u2019s r 0.74 and RMSE 1.00kcal/mol) (Figure 2A). Among the 225 mutations, 51 mutations were predicted by HREMD TI to have DDG absolute error greater than 1.3kcal/mol. Further dV/dL distribution analysis revealed 21 of the 51 mutations to have single or multiple lwindows significantly deviating between the antibody-bound and -unbound systems (identified using deviation from mean dV/dL by one SD). The exclusion of the deviated l windows improved the RMSE of the 21 mutations from 5.35 to 2.81kcal/mol (Figure S2C), confirming the effectiveness of the strategy in improving prediction accuracy.\nWe then compared the performance of HREMD TI to five KB algorithms [FoldX (12), Rosetta (33), ddG-predictor (34), SAAMBE-\nFrontiers in Immunology 04\n3D (13), and mmCSM-AB (10)]. For the 225 mutation dataset, the comparison revealed that HREMD TI performed the best, followed by SAAMBE-3d and mmCSM-AB (Figure 2B). Because the mutations from SKEMPI and AB-BIND were used to train the machine learning algorithms ddG-predictor, SAAMBE-3D, and mmCSM-AB, we compared their performance using the 54 literature mutations collected from in vitro and in vivo antibody maturation studies. The result showed that the correlation coefficients of ddG-predictor, SAAMBE-3D, and mmCSM-AB substantially decreased to approximately 0.2. The performance of FoldX is comparable between the 225 and 54 datasets (Figure 2B) as well as a previous study with a larger testing dataset (17). To further compare the performance of TI to FEP+, we predicted the RBFE of 21 VRC01 mutations against the gp120 resurfaced stabilized core 3 (RSC3), which showed an accuracy comparable to FEP+ (Figure S2E) (9).\nBecause the goal was to identify beneficial mutations for antibody improvement, we further compared the accuracies of the KB and TI algorithms in predicting beneficial and deleterious mutations. The analysis showed that all algorithms predicted deleterious mutations with higher success rates than beneficial mutations (Figure 2B). HREMD TI achieved the best accuracy at predicting beneficial mutations while KB methods classified many beneficial mutations as neutral. HREMD TI also performed better at predicting the RBFEs of non-interface mutations than KB methods (Figure 2C), suggesting that TI can be used to explore a larger mutational space.\nThe high success rate of KB methods at predicting deleterious mutations suggests that KB methods can be used to exclude deleterious mutations in the mutation screening process. Thus, the high efficiency of the KB method and the high accuracy of the HREMDTImethod can be integrated to identify beneficial mutations.\nImproving the binding affinity of antibody 10-40\nTo validate our hypothesis that KB and TI methods can be combined to efficiently find beneficial mutations via saturation mutagenesis, we established a pipeline to improve the binding affinity of antibody 10-40 against the RBD from the circulating omicron subvariant BA5 (RBDBA5), without impairing the binding affinity against the wildtype RBD (RBDD614G) (Figure 3A). Because the 10-40/RBDBA5 complex structure is unavailable and a conformation change is observed at epitope positions of 370 to 376 in the antibody- free state (35), we modeled the 10-40/RBDBA5 complex and performed 20ns MD simulation. The complex structure from the last snapshot of the MD simulation was used for screening beneficial mutations against RBDBA5. Using the experimentally determined structure of 10-40/RBDD614G and the MD-generated 10-40/RBDBA5, the pipeline first used FoldX and Rosetta to perform saturation mutagenesis at all 28 paratope positions to identify neutral and beneficial mutations to both RBDD614G and RBDBA5 (see methods). TI was then applied to the obtained list of mutations to exclude deleterious mutations to RBDD614G and to identify beneficial mutations to RBDBA5. Ten\nfrontiersin.org\nmutations, including four predicted to be deleterious or neutral by TI but to be beneficial by FoldX and/or Rosetta and six of the top predictions beneficial to RBDD614G and/or RBDBA5 by TI, were synthesized and their binding affinities against RBDD614G and RBDBA5 were measured (Figure 3B; Table S3).\nThe surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement showed that four of the six beneficial mutations (S32HH, R100bIH, R100bLH, and Q53FL) predicted by TI enhanced the binding affinity to RBDBA5 without substantially impairing the binding affinity to RBDD614G (Figure 3B). The deleterious mutations predicted by TI were also validated by the SPR results, suggesting that TI can identify false positives predicted by FoldX and Rosetta (Table S3). Interestingly, TI predicted that adding S32HH and Q53FL to R100bIH further improves the binding affinity of antibody 10-40 to RBDBA5 (Table S3). We then produced the combination mutants, and the SPR measurement revealed a strong synergy between the three mutations, with the triple mutations improving RBDBA5\u2019s binding affinity by over 5,000-fold (Figure 3B). Overall, the TI predictions correlated with experimental data with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of approximately 0.6 (Figure 3C).\nFrontiers in Immunology 05\nThe structural basis of the synergistic effects between S32HH, R100bIH, and Q53FL\nTo understand the mechanism of synergy between S32HH, R100bIH, and Q53FL, we performed MD simulations of antibody 10-40 with individual and combination mutation complexed with both RBDBA5 and RBDD614G. Overall, compared to the wildtype 10- 40/RBDD614G complex, the three mutations induced both local and global conformation changes to recognize RBDBA5 but not RBDD614G (Figures 4A, S2B). Consequentially, for each mutation, we observed altered polar interactions in the 10-40/RBDBA5 complex (Figure 4A right).\nThe three mutations did not change the buried accessible surface area (bASA) between antibody 10-40 and RBDD614G except the R100bIH and S32HH double mutant (Figure 4B), whose paratope bASA increased by approximately 100\u00c52, which is coincident with the 2.7-fold increase in binding affinity (Figure 3B). Surprisingly, for the 10-40/RBDBA5 complex, the three mutations induced similar conformational changes (Figure S2B),\nB\nC\nA\nFIGURE 2 Comparison of the performance of TI and five knowledge-based computational methods.

Furthermore, individual and combinations of S32HH, R100bIH, and Q53FL stabilized multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between paratope and epitope in the 10-40/RBDBA5 complex but not the 10-40/RBDD614G complex (Figures 4D, E, S2C, D). Above all, S32HH, R100bIH, and Q53FL induced similar conformational changes for RBDBA5 recognition. The increased bASA and polar interactions are consistent with the improved binding affinity. The synergy between the three mutations is probably through additive stabilization of the altered binding mode."

We found that the incorporation of HREMD and the statistical correction strategies to TI increase the accuracy of a single TI run, which substantially shortened the time to screen a large number of mutations. It takes about 24 GPU hours to calculate the RBFE of one mutation in the 10-40/RBD complex on an NVIDIA GTX 1080TI GPU, while the most accurate FEP+ protocol (100ns MD per l window) takes approximately a week (9, 21). The run time of TI could be shortened to approximately 12 hours or less using the most advanced GPUs. Thus, the improved TI protocol alone or in combination with KB methods could be broadly applied to in silico mutational scanning.\nFrontiers in Immunology 07\nThis study reveals that the smooth step function reduces the \u201cparticle collapse problem\u201d and the \u201clarge gradient-jump problem\u201d effectively in the softcore potential (18). Despite that, this study further shows that large dV/dL deviation between antigen-bound and unbound systems is observed at certain l windows. Excluding such l windows for the calculation of RBFE tends to reduce the RMSE of TI prediction, suggesting that a comparison of dV/dL distribution may be a method to examine the reliability of TI prediction. However, the causes of large dV/dL deviation and its association with prediction error remain unclear. As shown in Figure S1C, mutations with large dV/dL deviation issues tend to enrich small-to-large and charge-changing mutations. We suspect that multiple factors including residual \u201clarge gradient-jump problem\u201d, sampling convergence, and mutation-specific structural\nB C\nD E\nA\nFIGURE 4 The structural basis of antibody 10-40 binding affinity improvement by S32HH, R100bIH, and Q53FL.

Our TI protocol provides scripts to show the sampling convergence and issues of a TI run by examining the HREMD exchange rate (Figure S4A, a higher rate is better) (36), dV/dL distribution (Figure S4B), and dV/dL deviation between antigenbound and unbound systems (Figure S4C). In future studies, we will examine whether the optimization of the smooth step function could reduce the prediction error. Ongoing efforts also include a further reduction of the deviation between independent TI repeats by incorporating advanced techniques (e.g., temperature REMD and Arbitrary Degree of Freedom) to HREMD (18). While a single TI run shows an accuracy high enough for mutation screening, averaging over multiple TI runs will be optimal in cases where high accuracy is demanded.\nThe improved TI method expands the mutational space sampled during in silico mutational scanning. Many antibody/ antigen interactions involve post-translational modifications (PTMs) (e.g., N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and tyrosine sulfation). With the improved glycan force field and tools available to easily generate force field parameters for PTMs, the TI method provides a tool to optimize PTM interactions, which cannot be handled by most KB methods. Despite the fact that the performance of TI on other biomolecule systems is still under evaluation, we expect that the current protocol will be fairly accurate for optimizing interactions between diverse biomolecules.\nMost KB algorithms [e.g. FoldX (12), mmCSM-AB (10), and SAAMBE-3D (13)] train empirical or statistical models to calculate free energy changes (e.g. electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and solvation) upon mutation. The dataset used for model training are databases including SKEMPI (37), AB-BIND (38), and PROXiMATE (39), which contain binding affinity of approximately 7,000 protein mutations measured by experimental assays. Our results indicate that KB methods have a high accuracy at\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nfinding deleterious rather than beneficial mutations, probably because the training databases contain imbalanced numbers of beneficial and detrimental mutations (only approximately 10% beneficial mutations and approximately 50% alanine mutations). While computational approaches have been used to balance the training dataset for mmCSM-AB (10), this study reveals that their accuracy still has room for improvement. One pitfall is that the sample size of the available beneficial mutations unseen by KB methods for evaluating their performance is small. Accumulation of more mutational data, especially beneficial mutations, from in vivo and in vitro affinity maturation studies will be a critical and limiting factor for evaluating and advancing KB methods. Nonetheless, the high accuracy of the KB methods at identifying deleterious mutations is still very useful in protein design. We demonstrate that the incorporation of both KB and TI methods, by taking advantage of the high efficiency of KB methods and the high accuracy of TI, is effective at finding beneficial mutations. This study provides proof-of-concept validation by combining FoldX, Rosetta, and TI. The incorporation of other KB methods will be an important next step to improve the accuracy of the KB-TI strategy.\nThe development of highly potent 10-40-like antibodies is an important goal of anti-sarbecovirus therapeutics and vaccine design (28). This study reveals that the substantial binding affinity improvement of antibody 10-40 does not increase the neutralization potency of the omicron variant to a very low level. One hypothesis is that the spike trimer of the omicron variants evolves to have more RBD protomers in the down conformation (35), which buries the 10-40 epitope inside the spike trimer. In such cases, both in vivo and in vitro affinity maturation may not result in substantial potency improvement. Thus, this study suggests that epitope inaccessibility may be a roadblock to further improving the potency of 10-40-like antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants by in silico design or vaccination.\nB\nC\nA\nFIGURE 5 Pseudovirus neutralization potency of antibody 10-40 mutants.

Next, a 100ps simulation in the Isothermal\u2013isobaric (NPT) ensemble was performed to adjust the density of the system, followed by five short simulations (each 200ps, canonical NVT ensemble) to gradually reduce the solute restraint to zero. Next, we equilibrated the system for each l window (0.00922, 0.04794, 0.11505, 0.20634, 0.31608, 0.43738, 0.56262, 0.68392, 0.79366, 0.88495, 0.95206, and 0.99078) using a strategy described previously (19).

Finally, 3ns or 5ns HREMD or independent production run was performed with energy information saved and state exchange attempts between adjacent l windows every 2ps. Both equilibration and production runs were performed in the NVT ensemble with Langevin dynamics to control temperature and with a 1fs time step. The mutated residues were included in the softcore region with the smoothstep softcore potential for dV/dl calculation. For predicting DDG of combination mutations, the mutations were introduced sequentially to the antibody with the last snapshot of the TI simulation of the former mutation used as input structure for the TI run of the latter mutation.\nWe used the trapezoidal rule to analyze the TI gradients (dV/ dl) from the production run with the first 0.5ns excluded as equilibration. The cumulative average of dV/dl values over time was plotted to check sampling convergence, with TI runs not converged discarded. For each TI run, mean dV/dl and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for each l window. A l window was excluded if its mean dV/dl of the unbound TI run deviates from the mean dV/dl of the bound TI run by over one SD, and vice versa.

TI was applied to exclude deleterious mutations against RBDD614G and RBDBA5. TI- identified beneficial mutations that were then ranked by the RBFE. Cysteine mutations were excluded due to their high reactivity with free cysteines in a cell culture medium (47). Mutations resulting in the Nglycosylation site (NXS/T motif, X cannot be Pro) were also excluded.\nMolecular dynamics simulation and trajectory analysis\nAntibody 10-40 mutations were introduced to the 10-40Fab/ RBDD614G complex (PDB IDs: 7SD5) and the modeled 10-40Fab/ RBDBA5 complex (see above) for MD simulations to study their effects on antibody and antigen interactions. A published antibody MD simulation pipeline was used to perform MD simulation (41).

Briefly, for each MD production run, snapshots of the first 100ns were discarded as equilibration. Each snapshot was superimposed to the first snapshot using Ca atoms of the heavy and light chain variable domains and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was calculated to determine simulation convergence (48). For each snapshot, we quantified the sampled distributions of the torsion and tilting angles and distance between VH and VL using ABangle recompiled in R (49), elbow angle by PyMOL, buried ASA, and hydrogen bond networks between domain interfaces using PISA (46).

The PCR products were denatured and then reannealed. The nonmutated methylated parental plasmid was digested with DpnI (NEB), and the remaining plasmids were transformed into E. coli cells. For each transformation, five colonies were selected at random and grown overnight in 5 ml LB + Ampicillin medium at 37\u00b0C.

Heat-inactivated sera or antibodies were first serially diluted in a medium in 96-well plates in triplicate, starting at 1:100 dilution for sera and 10 \u00b5gmL\u22121 for antibodies. Pseudoviruses were then added and the virus\u2013sample mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Vero-E6 cells were then added at a density of 3 \u00d7 104 cells per well and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for approximately 10 h. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using SoftMax Pro v.7.0.2 (Molecular Devices). Neutralization curves and IC50 values were derived by fitting a nonlinear five-parameter dose-response curve to the data in GraphPad Prism v.9.2."
