    "abstractText": "In today\u2019s business world, organizations tend to overlook that employees face suffering caused by work and non-work-related events that can negatively impact business organizations in the long run. One way to address this challenge is through leadership acknowledging and alleviating employees\u2019 suffering to ensure a company\u2019s success. However, research on compassion and leadership in business settings is still relatively scarce. In this study, we aim to extend the organizational compassion literature by addressing our research question: \u201cWhat are paradoxes induced by compassionate leader behavior in the workplace in the context of social hierarchy?\u201d. We conducted a qualitative exploratory study based on 12 semi-structured interviews with six dyads of leaders and their direct subordinates from small, medium, and large firms representing different industries. The findings of our study indicate that compassionate leader behavior goes hand-in-hand with paradoxical situations that both leader and member face in the workplace, supporting the proposition that compassion as a social, interpersonal process is complex and multi-faceted. Our analysis identified 6 compassion paradoxes that spring from compassion from a leader towards a member. Our study differentiates from other research of compassion paradoxes in the sense that it also focuses on the interplay between leader and member. From that perspective, the findings of our study indicate that social hierarchy is playing a crucial role and exacerbating some paradoxical tensions. This consideration implies that to be effective, compassionate leaders need to have or develop the ability to continuously transcend those compassion paradoxes, as well as support their members in transcending the paradoxes they find themselves dealing with. Thus, the findings of our study contribute to management literature in the field of Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) by highlighting compassion as a critical element of dyadic leader-subordinate relationships that could be reinforced by systematically building more competence in leaders and members to navigate the tensions emerging from the identified compassion paradoxes. Additionally, we provide limitations and recommendations for further research, along with several theoretical and practical implications of the results, which are particularly relevant for practitioners such as managing directors, leaders, employees, human resource managers, academics, and business and HR consultants.",

One way to address this challenge is through leadership acknowledging and alleviating employees\u2019 suffering to ensure a company\u2019s success. However, research on compassion and leadership in business settings is still relatively scarce. In this study, we aim to extend the organizational compassion literature by addressing our research question: \u201cWhat are paradoxes induced by compassionate leader behavior in the workplace in the context of social hierarchy?\u201d. We conducted a qualitative exploratory study based on 12 semi-structured interviews with six dyads of leaders and their direct subordinates from small, medium, and large firms representing different industries. The findings of our study indicate that compassionate leader behavior goes hand-in-hand with paradoxical situations that both leader and member face in the workplace, supporting the proposition that compassion as a social, interpersonal process is complex and multi-faceted. Our analysis identified 6 compassion paradoxes that spring from compassion from a leader towards a member. Our study differentiates from other research of compassion paradoxes in the sense that it also focuses on the interplay between leader and member. From that perspective, the findings of our study indicate that social hierarchy is playing a crucial role and exacerbating some paradoxical tensions. This consideration implies that to be effective, compassionate leaders need to have or develop the ability to continuously transcend those compassion paradoxes, as well as support their members in transcending the paradoxes they find themselves dealing with. Thus, the findings of our study contribute to management literature in the field of Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) by highlighting compassion as a critical element of dyadic leader-subordinate relationships that could be reinforced by systematically building more competence in leaders and members to navigate the tensions emerging from the identified compassion paradoxes. Additionally, we provide limitations and recommendations for further research, along with several theoretical and practical implications of the results, which are particularly relevant for practitioners such as managing directors, leaders, employees, human resource managers, academics, and business and HR consultants.\nKEYWORDS\ncompassion, compassionate leadership, compassionate leader, compassionate behavior, suffering, social hierarchy, dyadic study, compassion at work\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY Jason Kanov, Western Washington University, United\u00a0States\nREVIEWED BY Kelcey Stratton, University of Michigan, United\u00a0States Monica Worline, University of Michigan, United\u00a0States Matthew Mars, University of Arizona, United\u00a0States\n*CORRESPONDENCE C\u00e9lia Rousset rousset.celia@gmail.com\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nRECEIVED 30 November 2022 ACCEPTED 11 October 2023 PUBLISHED 31 October 2023\nCITATION Krause V, Rousset C and Sch\u00e4fer B (2023) Uncovering paradoxes of compassion at work: a dyadic study of compassionate leader behavior.

            "text": "Human suffering, both within and outside organizations, seems inevitable. Defined as \u201cthe severe or protracted distress people experience when an instance of pain or injury (emotional, physical, or otherwise) disrupts one\u2019s basic personhood\u201d (Kanov, 2021, p.86), suffering springs from many sources. It can come from illness, injury, or even the death of loved ones (Harvey, 2001), from toxic interactions with line managers, colleagues, or customers (Frost, 2003), and also from organizational processes (Maitlis and Ozcelik, 2004) or even from carrying out the \u201cnecessary evils\u201d of work organizations (Molinsky and Margolis, 2005). This list of potential sources of suffering shows how pain (and subsequently suffering) is an unavoidable human experience. These psychologically painful experiences can be\u00a0very costly, not only for the individual who is suffering, but also for the organizations who employ them. In 2003, the Grief Recovery Institute conducted a study showing that companies lose more than $75 billion annually in lost productivity, lost business, and poor performance due to grief-inducing experiences (James et\u00a0al., 2003). Furthermore, companies today are exposed to tremendous pressure, such as the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and are forced to react rapidly to such externalities (Oruh et\u00a0al., 2021). In contrast to short-notice incidents, organizations are also going through profound transformations through medium- and long-term perspectives in the hope of remaining relevant within their markets. These transformations also create a considerable amount of \u201cpain\u201d in organizations, which then face even more significant challenges to keep their employees engaged and committed (Elias, 2009). Hence, suffering and its associated economic impact will continue to rise in the upcoming years. More than 20 years ago, Frost (1999) stressed that leaders are more and more challenged to deal with the suffering of subordinates, regardless of industry and company size. Today, this remains more true than ever.\nDuring the last decades, researchers have identified different constructs dealing with pain and suffering (e.g., empathy or empathetic response, emotional social support, and prosocial behavior) (Bacharach et\u00a0al., 1996; Lim and DeSteno, 2016). One such construct is Compassion \u2014from the Latin compati, meaning \u201cto suffer with.\u201d Even though there are many different definitions of compassion within the organizational research context, a vast and steadily growing number of organizational scholars have drawn on the definition of compassion provided by Dutton et\u00a0al. (2014). Within their model of the \u201cInterpersonal Process of Compassion,\u201d they define compassion as a human experience comprising of the following key elements: (1) noticing suffering, (2) feeling empathetic concern, (3) sensemaking, and (4) acting to alleviate the suffering (Kanov et\u00a0al., 2004; Dutton et\u00a0 al., 2014). We\u00a0 also utilize Dutton\u2019s definition of interpersonal compassion, as it allows us to differentiate compassion from other constructs (such as empathy, emotional social support, or prosocial behavior).\nWhile studying compassion is relatively new to the field of organizational behavior, several studies show that compassion at work makes a difference. Frost et\u00a0 al. (2000) demonstrated that compassionate behavior can boost people\u2019s ability to function as productive employees. Further scholars found evidence that compassion also increases attachment and commitment to the organization (Grant et\u00a0al., 2008; Lilius et\u00a0al., 2008). Dutton et\u00a0al. (2002) show that compassionate behavior can strengthen emotional\nconnections at work, and Lilius et\u00a0al. (2008) outline that it can call up positive emotions and reduce anxiety. Especially in demanding transformation processes, the potential benefits of compassion highlight an alternative for organizations and their leaders in dealing with the increasing amount of suffering, as \u201ccompassion offers a potential solution for creating healthier organizations\u201d (Shuck et\u00a0al., 2019, p.\u00a0558). Lilius et\u00a0al. (2012) conducted a literature review on compassion in the field of Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) and summarized the benefits of organizational compassion, the processes supporting compassion (Dutton et\u00a0 al., 2002, 2006), the organizational conditions for compassion (Kanov et\u00a0al., 2004), and the mechanisms of support such as compassionate policies, routines, and systems (Dutton et\u00a0al., 2002, 2007; Kanov et\u00a0al., 2004; Frost et\u00a0al., 2006; Lilius et\u00a0al., 2008).\nAdditionally, multiple studies have explicitly investigated the role of leaders within the context of compassion and have shown that leaders are highly relevant in legitimizing the influence of compassion in organizations (see for example Worline and Dutton, 2017). ZoghbiManrique-de-Lara and Viera-Armas (2019) found that ethical leadership was significantly and positively linked to compassion and peer-focused citizenship, suggesting that leaders who act morally more easily move their members to become sensitized to their peers\u2019 suffering. Other researchers have called to integrate compassion into previous leadership models, such as servant leadership, as a skill to respond to suffering (Davenport, 2015). More specifically, initial research in the field of compassionate leadership provided the first evidence that compassion does matter in leadership and that it impacts psychological well-being, employee engagement, and turnover intent (Shuck et\u00a0al., 2019).\nHowever, despite the growing interest in other fields, research on compassionate leadership can still be\u00a0considered rather scarce and needs further investigation from multiple perspectives. The current state of literature in the field of compassionate leadership and its limited empirical research is summarized best by Shuck et\u00a0al. (2019) as follows:\n\u201cThe specific function of compassion related to leader behavior in a work setting remains an underexamined topic across the HRD field as well as in related fields, such as management and organization development. (\u2026) Beyond a limited number of pioneering articles, very little work can empirically comment on how compassion \u2013 a behavior that a leader might model \u2013 could influence performance within any setting\u201d (Shuck et\u00a0al., 2019, p.\u00a0538)."

            "heading": "2. Context and objective of our study",
            "text": "Recently, the definition of workplace compassion and the merely positive connotation of compassion has been criticized (Simpson et\u00a0 al., 2014a,b). Former definitions posited that compassion is expressed by leaders towards their members and is described essentially from the perspective of the (powerful) giver and less from the (grateful) receiver (Kanov et\u00a0al., 2004; Frost et\u00a0al., 2006; Dutton et\u00a0al., 2007; Lilius et\u00a0al., 2008). Simpson et\u00a0al. (2014a) underline this observation by pointing out that \u201cin the dominant definition the subjectivity of the giver is privileged over the experience of the\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nreceiver\u201d (Simpson et\u00a0al., 2014a, p.\u00a0354). Those definitions neglect sociological and political dynamics since they are framed from a concrete psychological position in a unidirectional manner and hence limit the range of the compassion phenomena due to the greater importance of the power relationship of the giver compared to the receiver.\nIn addition to the rather unidirectional framing of compassion, the previous definitions did not regard compassion as a socially constructed phenomenon intertwined with inherent power dynamics, where those involved may encounter both favorable and unfavorable consequences. On the contrary, many scholars investigating the effects of workplace compassion take an absolutist view on compassion as a virtuous and exclusively positively coined construct (Simpson et\u00a0al., 2014a,b). In this context, Caza and Carroll (2012) claim that in the \u201clarge majority of POS article [\u2026] the positive phenomenon was described as inherently valuable, but also having the happy side effect of enhancing profits\u201d (p.\u00a0 973). From a genealogical perspective, Simpson et\u00a0al. (2014a) argue that within the social and organizational context, power/knowledge relations and, therefore, analytical, rational, and calculative actions are unavoidable since contemporary leaders tend an organizational arena, wherein \u201cemployees may be\u00a0vicariously treated as the floc \u2013 whose obedience is to be\u00a0 cultivated compassionately\u201d (Simpson et\u00a0 al., 2014a, p.\u00a0 355). Overall power dynamics and adverse outcomes in compassion relations are often underdeveloped and underresearched (e.g., Frost, 1999; Frost et\u00a0al., 2000, 2006; Kanov et\u00a0al., 2004; Dutton et\u00a0al., 2006; Lilius et\u00a0al., 2011, 2012). The experiences of both leaders and members in compassion relations will likely be\u00a0multifaceted, complex, continuous, and open to varied interpretations. Consequently, researchers call for more research to investigate organizational compassion through the lens of power dynamics and effects, taking the perspective of both leader and members, and considering the question of who benefits from what knowledge.\nTherefore, we\u00a0are responding to multiple calls for more research in the domain of compassionate leadership behavior by analyzing the complex interplay between leader and member. In this context, we\u00a0 follow the argumentation of previous research (see examples above) outlining that organizational compassion is rather multifaceted and ambiguous in implication and does not only have positive connotations. With our study, we\u00a0aim to show that organizational compassion is also affected by social hierarchy and may lead to paradoxical situations. We\u00a0refer to social hierarchy as the differences in power and status among organizational actors (Bunderson and Reagans, 2011). In this context, we\u00a0analyze the dyadic relationship between leader and member, including both perspectives. Drawing on the work of Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2019) and Simpson et\u00a0al. (2022), we\u00a0also presume that the combination of compassion and leadership results in paradoxical challenges (Simpson and Berti, 2020; Tomkins, 2020), evoking the paradoxical poles of certain elements in the compassion context. Organizational scholars describe paradoxes as persistent mutually interdependent but contradictory tensions (Smith and Lewis, 2011). Exploring compassionate leadership through a paradox lens while taking into consideration both the perspective of leader and member constitutes an important contribution as the compassion literature has shown so far limited (empirical) investigation about the tensions experienced by compassionate leaders and their receivers. Doing so could lead to a better understanding of how compassionate leadership works in practice, both for developing theory and for\nidentifying practical guidelines for leaders who wish to bring compassion into their leadership practice. Motivated by that, we\u00a0state our research question as follows:\nWhat are paradoxes induced by compassionate leader behavior in the workplace in the context of social hierarchy?"

            "text": "The initial study underlying this article set out to deepen our understanding of the effects of compassionate behavior in leadermember settings towards business outcomes in a dyadic study. Thus, we\u00a0conducted 12 semi-structured, interrogative, dyad interviews with a sample of employees from different companies of different sizes and different industries. To this extent, our sample can be\u00a0described as a convenience sample from a diverse background of four, only partially overlapping large professional networks (Etikan, 2016).\nTo identify dyads of leaders and direct subordinates in business organizations, we\u00a0followed a purposive sampling approach to filter our sample (Palinkas et\u00a0al., 2015; Bell et\u00a0al., 2022). We\u00a0defined a \u201cleader\u201d as taking managerial responsibility for at least one employee. We\u00a0considered leaders and subordinates from different industries and small, medium, and large-sized firms to cover the relevant phenomena as broadly as possible, thereby ensuring heterogeneity in the sample. We\u00a0 required leaders to have at least 1 year of work experience to maximize in-depth insight into their role as leaders and compassionate behavior. We\u00a0also required the focal dyad to exist for at least 1 year to allow for a relationship to develop, as compassion can also be\u00a0related to how well people know each other (Gilbert, 2015). Subsequently, subordinates also needed at least 1 year of work experience to share sufficient practical experience.\nBased on these criteria, we\u00a0contacted leaders and subordinates from 26 companies in the researchers\u2019 networks throughout Germany. Seven contacts gave no feedback and five declined to participate due to time constraints. Two were unwilling to participate as they did not fulfill the above-described criteria and ascribed their reluctance to a perceived weak relationship and insufficient exchange that would make difficult to answer any dyadic questions. In total, 12 contacts agreed to in-depth interviews. The final sample is, thus, composed of 12 participants from six dyads consisting of four women and eight men aged between 22 and 59. To ensure anonymity and openness, we\u00a0conducted the interviews of each individual of each dyad separately. Four dyads stem from large enterprises, one dyad stems from a medium-sized enterprise, and one dyad from a small-sized company, representing six different sectors. The relationship duration of the dyads ranges from 1 to 3 years. The members\u2019 (M) professional experience ranges from one to 14 years, while the leaders\u2019 (L) management experience ranges from 1.5 to 16 years. The participants work in different areas such as International Marketing (M01; L01), Equities (M02; L02), Sales and Distribution (M03; L03), Project Management and Video Production (M04; L04), UX Design (M05; L05), and Marketing Communication (M06; L06). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom and Microsoft Teams, with activated cameras. The average duration of the interviews conducted in German was 43:00 min.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Our initial study aimed at studying the phenomenon of compassionate leadership in business organizations in a broader, open-ended way through the investigation of the effects of compassion in leadership, the individual reasons for compassionate behavior, and the limits and challenges of compassion in leadership in the organizational context, while providing deeper insights into the dyads\u2019 dynamics. Therefore, we\u00a0based the questions of our semi-structured interview guideline on the existing compassion literature and LMX theory (Liden et\u00a0al., 1997). The team prepared the guide according to the rules of Lindgren et\u00a0al. (2020), emphasizing an open-but-targeted form of questioning (Miles et\u00a0 al., 2020). Due to the study setup, we\u00a0developed separate guides for leaders\u2019 and members\u2019 interviews. They included statements concerning confidentiality between the dyad members, prohibiting the researchers from sharing insights from previous interviews with the second part of the dyad to promote openness even in sensitive cases (Eisikovits and Koren, 2010). The guidelines were tested thoroughly in advance through two test interviews with both a leader and a member and were subsequently slightly adapted (Miles et\u00a0 al., 2020). The final interview guides consisted of an introduction, a main part comprising 12 questions for leaders and 11 for subordinates, and a conclusion. In addition to an icebreaker question, the first block of questions aimed at introducing the topic. After asking participants how they would define compassion, we\u00a0 also provided a working definition to ensure a common understanding during the interview. For simplicity, we\u00a0 used an updated definition from Gilbert, who defines compassion as a \u201csensitivity to suffering in self and others with a commitment to try to alleviate and prevent it\u201d (Gilbert, 2014). The second block of questions sought to explore the status quo of compassion in leadership within the participants\u2019 business organizations. The questions strived to identify the general attitude toward compassion and cover all aspects of the compassion process, especially expressing, noticing, and responding to suffering. The last block addressed drivers and barriers to compassionate behavior in leaders."

            "text": "The interviews were recorded, fully transcribed, and initially underwent a structured deductive content analysis. While the initial intent of our study was to deepen our understanding of the effects of compassionate behavior in leader-member settings towards business outcomes in a dyadic study, we\u00a0narrowed our focus during the data analysis and review process leading to this article. In our preliminary analyses, two insights came to light: (a) the relevance of social hierarchy-relations and (b) the paradoxical situations which can arise in the context of compassionate behavior in organizations. In line with iterative approaches in qualitative analysis (see Srivastava and Hopwood, 2009; Miles et\u00a0al., 2020), we\u00a0decided to follow those insights and shifted towards inductive content analysis. From that point on, our qualitative analysis was conducted interactively with comparisons between the data and the literature (Corbin and Strauss, 2008). We\u00a0first started by scanning our interviews for evidence of paradoxical tensions as defined by Smith and Lewis (2011). In particular, we\u00a0were looking for evidence of poles that \u201cseem logical in isolation, but absurd and irrational when appearing simultaneously\u201d (Lewis, 2000). In this\nendeavor, we\u00a0also made sure to distinguish paradox from dilemmas, which require a difficult choice between competing alternatives that each have advantages and disadvantages, but that can be\u00a0resolved temporarily by integrating contradictory elements (Clegg and Cunha, 2017). Dilemmas become paradoxical only when options are contradictory and interrelated such that any choice between them is temporary and tension will resurface (Smith and Lewis, 2011). After a first run through the data to reveal paradoxical tensions, we\u00a0then went back to the data and conducted the first level of coding by analyzing the data to identify and code core themes with the intention to identify discrete types of paradox. This analysis generated six main categories. Going back and forth between data and literature, we\u00a0compared our findings with the literature to identify and classify similarities and differences (Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007).\nThe overall data analysis was run by two researchers independently who, in case of unclarity or conflicting categorization of information between both researchers, consulted a third researcher who acted as a neutral \u201cjudge\u201d to ensure a high level of objectivity. In addition to that, within the data analysis process, all coders were also screening for examples of compassion which leader and member (dyad) referred to similarly. This allowed us to directly compare (1) the behavior of leader and member in a given situation, (2) their perception of provided and received compassion, as well as (3) the shared views or expectations in the exact same situation. Our dyadic research approach therefore enabled us to analyze the two sides of most situations which were described during the interviews."

            "text": "\u201c[\u2026] suffering is anything that describes a deviation from the norm that pulls me down personally and/or negatively affects me, in every respect. Suffering among my employees can be\u00a0manifold. The classic is suffering at work caused by the job, but also suffering at work can be\u00a0caused by a private situation, and suffering can be\u00a0caused by a private situation. [\u2026] But I\u00a0think I\u00a0have less to do with the latter now, because there is relatively little I\u00a0can do about it. What I\u00a0can control are all the sufferings that ultimately condition the work or influence the work\u201d (L06).\nAs this leader eloquently shares, suffering can spring from many sources, and impact \u2013 or not \u2013 the workplace. This reality is creating a tension between what belongs to the private and what belongs to the professional life. Indeed, our interviewees often pointed out the line between private and professional being blurred:\n\u201cif something is really completely in the personal space, you\u00a0might want to separate it[\u2026]. That could include if there\u2019s anything going on with my girlfriend. That\u2019s something I\u00a0would tend to keep private. But I\u00a0think the line is rather a bit blurred. So, if my grandmother were to die now [\u2026] that would certainly also be\u00a0 emotional, personal and intimate suffering. And I\u00a0would probably share that anyway, at least to the extent that I\u00a0want to communicate it so that others can better classify my situation \u2013 and thus also with my supervisor\u201d (M02).\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nNot surprisingly, in our sample, our interviewees raised the point that the boundary varies from one person to the next. One leader for example states that some people \u201care also very conservative and do not really want to reveal anything about themselves\u201d (L02), while others state very clearly that compassionate leadership means for them that they are also able and allowed to share private information (M03).\nAs stated by L06, people will bring suffering from home to work (but also vice versa), and the line between private and professional becomes blurred. According to our analysis, expressing and responding to this suffering in the workplace leads to six paradoxical tensions (see Table\u00a0 1). Interestingly, even though we\u00a0 did not deliberately look for paradoxical tensions for each step of the Interpersonal Compassion Process, 5 out of those 6 can be\u00a0mapped to that process, while the last one relates to the leader-member relationship. The Table\u00a01 provides an overview of those categories, and how they map to this process.\nIn the following sub-sections, we\u00a0will present those paradoxical tensions and illustrate them with quotes from our interviews. Each quote is labeled to a particular interviewee, with \u201cM\u201d indicating a \u201cmember,\u201d \u201cL\u201d indicating a \u201cleader,\u201d and the subsequent number representing the corresponding dyad. Finally, we\u00a0will also present our findings relevant to another paradox of strategic versus selfless compassion that Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2019) identified."

            "text": "When suffering, the employees we\u00a0interviewed often mentioned a paradoxical dilemma they face when deciding if they should express their suffering or not, especially in the context of the hierarchical relationship with their supervisor. One of them explains:\n\u201cit\u2019s always a bit of a balancing act: To what extent do I\u00a0show myself vulnerable or somehow sensitive, weak? To what extent do I\u00a0allow a person who is superior to me and who, if necessary, can and may also make decisions about my further professional future, to have insight into how I\u00a0am\u00a0doing emotionally or what any of my problems are. Of course, this is always a matter of consideration\u201d (M04).\nThe desire to show a strong professional self is linked to the concept of impression management, defined as the process by which people control the impressions others form of them (Leary and Kowalski, 1990). On the other hand, showing vulnerability implies deliberately disclosing sensible, potentially damaging information (Nienaber et\u00a0al., 2015). In the context of suffering and compassion, while followers expect a certain level of compassionate leadership behavior, they need to first express that suffering, requiring them to show their vulnerable private self and (potentially) eroding their strong professional self, which they think they need to retain their jobs and not create additional suffering (immediately or in the future).\nOne of the leaders interviewed displayed a good understanding of how vulnerable employees can feel when sharing their suffering:\n\u201cAnd if the other person smashes you\u00a0or shows no understanding, then I\u00a0imagine it like a snail that just gets out of the shell and at that moment pulls itself back into the house very, very quickly, and then getting out again is relatively difficult\u201d (L06).\nThe need to control the impression others form of them led some of the members interviewed to carefully consider which suffering they would share or not to not be\u00a0perceived too weak for a current or prospective job:\n\u201cIf there are any psychological problems now, I\u00a0would perhaps also be\u00a0cautious, because regardless of the corporate culture, I\u00a0believe psychological suffering can also be\u00a0taken up as excessive demands and also weakness and as a lack of qualifications for the job. I\u2019d probably really hold back on that. [\u2026] All suffering that goes in the direction of being overwhelmed at work and also being overwhelmed by a lack of qualifications\u00a0- I\u00a0would consider whether I\u00a0share it that way\u201d (M03). \u201cAt the moment when one reveals private problems or personal problems that may now have to do not only with work processes, but with personal feelings or circumstances, one naturally makes oneself vulnerable, which of course in the case of [\u2026] a promotion [\u2026], this can make you\u00a0look weaker than someone else possibly\u201d (M04).\nOur interviewees also point out the risk that being vulnerable and sharing their suffering might impact how performance is reviewed \u2013 positively or negatively, consciously or unconsciously:\n\u201cWhen it comes to performance reviews, a leader with compassion and with different relationships with employees no longer evaluates 100% objectively\u201d (M03). \u201cTo be\u00a0honest, I\u00a0believe that if something like this happens too often, that at some point you\u00a0can also assess the person a little less. So, I\u00a0think it can change perception\u201d (M05).\nOne leader also recognizes that performance evaluation can be\u00a0a challenging exercise, indicating that it can be\u00a0 difficult to\nTABLE\u00a01 Analysis categories: identified paradoxes mapped to the interpersonal compassion process.\nInterpersonal process of compassion (Dutton et\u00a0al., 2014) Paradoxes identified in our study\nA sufferer\u2019s experienced and\nexpressed suffering\nParadox of showing the vulnerable, private\nself versus showing the strong, professional\nself\nA focal actor noticing suffering Paradox of probing (pro-)actively but\nrespecting boundaries\nA focal actor feeling empathic concern Paradox of compassion requiring empathy\nand understanding, yet leaders need to show\ndiscernment so as not to be\u00a0exploited or\nmanipulated A focal actor and sufferer engaging in sensemaking\nA focal actor acting\ncompassionately\nParadox of the imperative for compassion to\nanswer one person\u2019s suffering versus the\nimperative for equality and fairness to other\nteam members\nParadox of weakness versus courage\nNon applicable\nParadox of the impact on the leader- member\nrelationship: distance (hierarchy) versus\ncloseness (interpersonal bonds)\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\ncompartmentalize and disregard some sensitive topics they are aware of and that are affecting their employees\u2019 performance.\n\u201cYou have to differentiate very strongly between the classic performance that you\u00a0have to evaluate as a supervisor and you\u00a0have to differentiate that from possible compassion, problems or whatever kind of thing you\u00a0have knowledge of. Because you\u00a0are responsible for evaluating performance purely from the job description. Quite simply, it becomes clear when an employee is sick and can only work three days a week. Then I\u2019m only allowed to evaluate these three days and I\u2019m not allowed to evaluate the 5 days where I\u00a0say, \u201cHe\u2032s not there for 2 days.\u201d And that\u2019s ultimately how it is with the topic. If I\u00a0am\u00a0aware of a topic that has been openly brought to my attention, then I\u00a0must hide it in the classic evaluation, but I\u00a0have to evaluate the pure work performance. This is sometimes difficult\u201d (L03).\nInterestingly, our interviews indicated that the coin can be\u00a0flipped, and strength can be\u00a0experienced when sharing vulnerability.\n\u201cAnd that was a very concrete example, where the feedback came that this person had been thinking about this vulnerability or this supposed weakness to talk, but then to make it known, and that then helped the person extremely to draw strength, because she did not have to hide it, but was able to deal with it openly towards me\u201d (L03).\nIn addition, the experience of compassion has been indicated by an employee as a way to go past their fear of being vulnerable, thereby creating a virtuous circle:\n\u201cI think through the compassionate behavior of my leader, I\u00a0 am\u00a0 encouraged to communicate better and share more. And because of that, there are fewer situations where you\u00a0 are just dissatisfied, but you\u00a0 do not change anything about it, because you\u00a0do not even get to share it because you\u00a0think: \u201cWell, I\u2019d rather not say anything, because that could be\u00a0 used against me or be\u00a0interpreted negatively\u201d (M04)."

I\u00a0think you\u00a0must hold back and think carefully about when you\u00a0can hook in and when you\u00a0cannot. And ultimately, I\u00a0believe that compassionate leadership is right at the moment when you\u00a0turn the offer into a conversation. And if that is accepted, then you\u00a0 can devote yourself to it. But if that is not accepted, the offer, then it is actually none of my business, that is a private story\u201d (L04).\nMost of the employees we\u00a0interviewed insisted on the fact that they expect their leaders to ask and probe when they notice their\nsuffering, especially as sometimes it can be\u00a0easier for them to continue a conversation about their suffering initiated by their leader rather than start one. Also, they expect their leaders to observe and intervene if necessary:\n\u201cAnd then, if necessary, to ask back. Or at some point, for example, in a different professional context, when my boss also notices that things were not going well or maybe he\u00a0noticed that I\u00a0was somehow different than usual. Then maybe ask \u201cwhat is it?\u201d\u201d (M01).\nThis perception is mostly aligned with the leaders we\u00a0interviewed, but they place an equally important responsibility on the employee to share (or not), as illustrated by those leaders:\n\u201c[Being] compassionate is to perceive [suffering], that\u2019s the first thing. The fact that you\u00a0 perceive: \u201cOkay, something seems to be\u00a0 wrong.\u201d and then also as a manager to have an ear there, sometimes to ask a question, just to listen [\u2026]. And then it is also up to the respective employee himself to decide how deeply and what he\u00a0actually gives of himself \u201d (L03). \u201cAnd you\u00a0also make a comment: \u201cAh, you\u00a0are not in such a good mood today.\u201d And then you\u00a0usually observe: What is the reaction of the person? And either the one goes into the conversation [\u2026] or he\u00a0does not say anything. But I\u2019m not one to drill now. So, people have to reveal themselves\u201d (L01).\nThe example above hints at the concern to invade too much the space of their members (or their \u201cemotional world\u201d as stated by L04 as the start of this sub-section). Because the nature and experience of suffering is so individual, most of the leaders we\u00a0interviewed tend to take a more cautionary approach and prefer to leave it to their employee\u2019s initiative to initiate a conversation. As illustrated in the example below, in some cases leaders can also feel a tension between listening and asking for more details:\n\u201cThere are limits where employees are more likely to want to keep the private private and he\u00a0also kept private for a while. But only when it became so big and had so much influence on professional life, only then has he\u00a0communicated it to his supervisor, although we\u00a0also have this buddy relationship. Nevertheless, he\u00a0wanted to keep it more private. I\u00a0think that also shows that there are definitely limits and I\u00a0respected that to a certain extent, that he\u00a0does not want to talk too much about it and I\u00a0have not asked for every single detail \u2013 there is definitely a limit\u201d (L02).\nOne leader in particular also feared that if they would probe too much \u2013 even if guided by the desire to help their employee \u2013 they might be\u00a0perceived as abusive in their position of hierarchical superior:\n\u201cIf I\u00a0become abusive and interfere in very special, private problems or create pressure or ask: \u201cNow come, now tell me about it, I\u00a0notice it very clearly.\u201d [\u2026] The danger is definitely there that you\u00a0get too close to people. So not as a leader, but that you\u00a0just bring the aura into the aura that everyone considers their privacy. I\u00a0think indiscreet behavior is multi-layered, annoying and also disrespectful and as such it can also be\u00a0 understood as a lack of respect or as arrogance\u201d (L04).\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nTo manage this tension between the expectation to notice the suffering and ask about it without invading the privacy of their members, one leader uses his value of respect as a North Star: \u201c[You] need to have a clear respect for the individual \u2013 when someone signals that they do not want to go one step further, to accept that\u201d (L03)."

This paradoxical tension is also reflected in our interviews with the members who express their clear expectation toward leaders to be\u00a0empathetic and understanding, while recognizing that same risk of exploitation and manipulation.\nIndeed, on one hand, employees in our sample expect their leaders to take them seriously and feel their suffering. As a matter of fact, all members interviewed define compassionate leadership as their leader showing a deep understanding and empathy for their issues and suffering. They expect their leaders to put themselves in their shoes and show a genuine interest for them, sometimes even to show forgiveness for a temporary dip in motivation or performance. Even when there is no obvious solution to solve their problem or alleviate their suffering, the minimum they want is to be\u00a0heard and seen:\n\u201cWhat I\u00a0would always expect is at least to get the feeling of being taken seriously. There does not always have to be\u00a0 a solution to everything, but I\u00a0want to have the feeling that I\u00a0can express my problems without her saying \u201cBut that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d or \u201cjust pull yourself together\u201d [\u2026]. Because at the moment when I\u00a0see this as a problem and go so far as to communicate it, I\u00a0expect my counterpart to take it seriously. As I\u00a0 said, there is not always an immediate solution for everything, or possibilities to implement this as one would like to wish or hope for. But I\u00a0always expect that at least this will be\u00a0taken seriously\u201d (M04).\nThis member goes further and shares an example when they felt they were not taken seriously when they shared that they were overwhelmed with the amount of work they had:\n\u201cI was actually flattened that it was dismissed that way and that\u2019s this certain situation, where in retrospect a lot of things come up\nand in the second you\u00a0are so surprised. It\u2019s also unpleasant to admit something like that you\u00a0cannot do it anymore. But the fact that it is then made so small, so to speak, and really wiped away, I\u00a0was really overwhelmed to address it further, because I\u00a0was simply irritated, I\u00a0have to admit. [\u2026] So, you\u00a0can always wipe away a lot of such problems. That\u2019s the feeling I\u00a0had rather. In this respect, I\u00a0 did not have the impression that he\u00a0 had really acknowledged this\u201d (M04).\nAt the same time, while employees want to be\u00a0taken seriously, they also recognize that their leaders\u2019 compassion could be\u00a0exploited:\n\u201cIt can also be\u00a0exploited if a leader is too compassionate. If people say: \u201cI\u2019m not feeling so well today\u201d and the manager says: \u201cYes, then you\u00a0close the computer and lie down\u201d \u2013 of course, this can also be\u00a0exploited if someone says: \u201cI do not feel like working today. I\u2019ll say I\u2019m sick,\u201d or something. [\u2026] It can also be\u00a0that there are people in the team who say: \u201cOh, our boss, he\u2019s very compassionate. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand if I\u00a0have to visit my mother now because I\u00a0have not seen her for 2 years since the lockdown.\u201d And in the middle of the most stressful phase of the campaign (\u2026) So I\u00a0think this exploitation is an issue\u201d (M06).\n4.4. Paradox #4: imperative for compassion towards one sufferer versus the imperative for equality and fairness toward the rest of the team\nWithin their Paradoxical Leadership Behavior (PLB) framework, Zhang et\u00a0 al. (2015) define the paradox for leaders of \u201ctreating subordinates uniformly while allowing individualizations.\u201d This paradox refers to the challenge for leaders of providing their members with \u201cidentical privileges, rights, and status without displaying favoritism\u201d (p.\u00a0542), while ensuring members are not depersonalized or deprived of their unique identity. In the frame of compassion, actions to alleviate suffering might create a temporary situation where members benefit from different privileges and rights. When addressing the suffering of one of their team members, the leaders we\u00a0interviewed pointed out the difficulties in answering the needs of this person in a tailored manner and alleviating them while ensuring equality and fairness with the rest of the team. On one hand, providing an individualized response was often perceived by our interviewees as necessary to alleviate the suffering of the sufferer. On the other hand, they also defined equality as being fairly treated, not seeing favoritism behaviors, and as everybody having the equal chance to receive compassion from their leaders. This paradox also resonates with 2 organizational compassion paradoxes proposed by Simpson and Berti (2020): Accept unfairness versus promotes fairness, and unjust versus just. For the former, the scholars base their paradox on the research of Thompson (2007) and Du Gay (2008) who argue that compassionate administration is an arbitrary and unfair expression of favoritism. For the latter, they base their paradox on the research by Batson et\u00a0al. (1995) indicating that compassion leads to decisions that conflict with justice.\nSome of our interviewees recognize the risk of perceived favoritism, which can create tensions within a team:\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\n\u201cThis can also have the effect of saying, \u201cThe boss prefers someone.\u201d You\u00a0feel unfairly treated. Of course, this can be\u00a0the case \u2013 especially when a new employee comes along and sees: \u201cThey already have a long-standing working relationship. Would I\u00a0get so much sympathy from the boss if I\u00a0said my dog was sick now?\u201d\u201d (M06). \u201cIt\u2019s also a bit of a question: How much compassion do you\u00a0show to whom? So as soon as you\u00a0do not show everyone the same amount of compassion, because you\u00a0 may like some better than others \u2013 happens as a leader sometimes \u2013 then of course you\u00a0quickly have such a favorite that people say: \u201cMan, [\u2026] she\u2019s his darling anyway, she can do whatever she wants; cough, then you\u00a0can stay at home for 2 weeks. And then it\u2019s all up to us again\u201d (L06).\nSome recognize that the quality of the relationship between a leader and a member might influence the level of compassion displayed:\n\u201cThe question is: are all employees shown the same amount of compassion? This is not always the case. Some more than others, depending on how far the personal relationship between the supervisor and the employee is. [\u2026] So, inequality arise and also the feeling that in the worst case some people do not take advantage of it now, but they constantly need this compassion, so to speak, because something is constantly not working, where you\u00a0can ask yourself: Why is it always the case with you\u00a0that something in your life does not work, and then you\u00a0always have to bring it with you\u00a0to work?\u201d (M05).\nIn some cases, when leaders have to deal with confidential information, it can be\u00a0even more difficult to ensure that the rest of the team does not see any favor treatment:\n\u201cThere was a person who had a case of cancer in the family [\u2026] and not everyone in the team should know. And of course, the team should not think that the person is now favored when he\u00a0or she may not have to perform or do quite as much as the others\u201d (L05).\nIn other cases, a respondent suggested that the inequality might simply arise from the fact that people would tend to describe their suffering differently, thereby leading to different solutions to address that suffering:\n\u201cThe disadvantage may be\u00a0that employees feel treated unequally with each other with the solutions that are presented [\u2026] which may actually depend on how the respective person describes their problem or possibly even comes up with suggestions for solutions [themselves]. But that there might be\u00a0an imbalance and people feel disadvantaged\u201d (M04).\nEven when the rest of the team is fully behind the actions of the leader to alleviate the suffering of another team member, it can create a feeling of inequality, especially as often the rest of the team needs to work harder to support that person. A leader comments:\n\u201cOn the other hand, the number of projects is not decreasing. But if you\u00a0have two hands less, you\u00a0have to ask your other people to do more \u2013 and of course beyond their regular working hours \u2013 and to do so with pleasure\u201d (L06).\nAnother interesting micro-discourse from a team member goes in a similar direction, highlighting the contradictory feelings that this paradox can evoke, starting with envy towards the sufferer followed by guilt as a secondary emotion, while suffering themselves from the consequences of the solutions and the perceived unfairness:\n\u201cI know a colleague who has gone through some crisis every week, with his relationships and family, and which I\u00a0 also find quite terrible. But that was really a big burden for the team. I\u00a0know how the conversations took place between my boss and the person. But for a short time, I\u00a0thought to myself [\u2026]: We\u00a0would all like to have so much freedom from time to time, just not to work, not to finish a project after all, because you\u00a0just get more time. And that was also at the expense of other employees, who then had to finish it on top, or who always had to argue why things are not there, which is not always pleasant. So once is not once, but from the fifth, sixth time it just gets difficult at some point\u201d (M05).\nIn this case, the member goes further in describing the felt unfairness due to the fact that the attention of their leader was only directed to a few people and who consequently felt left aside:\n\u201cI was just unlucky. Well, I\u00a0think so, maybe I\u00a0had just insinuated that I\u00a0get along well with everyone anyway. That\u2019s why I\u00a0do not have any problems at all. And other colleagues who were not as powerful were more likely to get this help because they thought: \u201cOh, they are not quite as stable,\u201d so you\u00a0have to look at them. [\u2026] So, it felt very unfair to me because every employee was now given very personal advice, but I\u00a0had the feeling that there were just a few that were overlooked. Some because you\u00a0say: \u201cOh, they are not that important anyway.\u201d Some where you\u00a0say: \u201cYes, they can do it on their own anyway.\u201d (..) I\u00a0did not think that was fair or balanced\u201d (M05).\nInterestingly, the corresponding leader in this situation seemed oblivious to the fact that some of his team members felt overlooked in this situation:\n\u201cOf course, I\u00a0do not differentiate in such a way that it appears that I\u00a0prefer someone. Rather, the employees then see that everyone has the same amount of attention, communication, or time together in the one-on-ones. Or we\u00a0have time together. So, you\u00a0should definitely not have favorite employees\u201d (L05).\nAccording to our interviews, this tension is exacerbated by the fact that suffering is very individual and subjective. Therefore by default, not everybody would have the same threshold, or feel the same amount of suffering in comparable situations.\n\u201cEveryone defines suffering differently for themselves. One of them may have grown up with the hamster and the other says: \u201cYes okay, my grandma died, but I\u2019m not going to act like that now, I\u2019m pulling myself together now.\u201d It\u2019s totally different, but at that moment both are equally bad for the respective person\u201d (M06).\nThis also led the leaders to doing some sensemaking to try and preserve equality in the team, and to accommodate for the fact that different employees might communicate differently and suffer differently:\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\n\u201cAnd there is always so much talk about Generation Z, that they are so demanding. And if they do not like something, they complain right away. And they are so idealistic. I\u00a0 think you\u00a0 have to differentiate again, whether employees sometimes go through stressful phases, they should also consciously. And some things they just have to swallow. That\u2019s how I\u00a0would look at it\u201d (L02).\nTo resolve that tension, some explain that it is important to refocus the group and take a perspective:\n\u201cAnd it cannot be\u00a0that someone thinks: \u201cOkay, he\u00a0has advantages\u201d by showing compassion and being a little closer to the person, that the others think I\u00a0prefer him. So, this must not happen, but it must remain in a context where everyone sees: Okay, it is now about the situation and not about the compassion in the context of a favor, but to help the person in the moment\u201d (L01)."

            "text": "Sadly, leaders in our interviews shared that in their organization their compassion is often perceived as weakness by top management, which can sometimes even stand in the way of career advancement.\n\u201cI have more of a problem in the other direction that I\u2019m too soft. My superiors tell me: \u201cYou\u2019ll only become a real manager once you\u00a0fire your first employee. [\u2026] there is definitely a risk that [\u2026] I\u00a0 will not be\u00a0 seen as a hard manager who can also enforce things\u201d (L02).\nThis tension with upper management is also quite clear for some members, who describe the challenges leaders face when they act in a compassionate manner:\n\u201cIt comes across as weakness for some \u2013 not perhaps for the people in the team, but just one level higher \u2013 if compassion is shown, that it may be\u00a0counted as a sign of weakness [\u2026]. I\u2019ve experienced that too. [My supervisor] is very compassionate. In the upper tiers it is already thin. There is often little understanding or [\u2026] no proactive questioning: \u201cHow are your teams doing?\u201d And in case of doubt, you\u00a0are also quickly there with termination agreements\u201d (M06).\nThose results align with the \u201cSign of weakness versus Requires courage\u201d paradox that Simpson and Berti (2020) identify as part of their proposed organizational compassion paradoxes. They base this proposal on the research of Koerner (2014) stating that \u201cfor the giver of compassion in organizational settings, courage is typically associated with relational power imbalances, manifesting in actions that threaten relationships with more powerful individuals\u201d (p.\u00a0444).\nThis lack of alignment on values with the organization can create a lot of frustrations for leaders who are trying to alleviate the suffering of their employees out of altruism but also with the intention to maintain the performance level of the organization. Sometimes, the frustration is made even bigger by the fact that the organization is\nsending a message feigning compassion but that, in action, leaders are often left alone.\n\u201cIn general, an employer does not make it easy for you\u00a0to release an employee, to create freedom for him \u2013 for this, generally large companies are not created. They do not really want flexibility, but actually a large company wants to know at all times where the employee is, what he\u00a0 is doing and why he\u00a0is doing it. The more you\u00a0demand from the employer [\u2026] the more difficult it will be\u00a0in the end. You\u00a0often get very, very frustrated \u2013 and that would be\u00a0the second emotion \u2013 because you\u00a0hit a wall again or it did not go any further. [\u2026]. You feign a lot of compassion, you\u00a0have that in your corporate targets, you\u00a0have it anchored in your values [\u2026] But I\u00a0do not think most big companies live that. And you\u00a0realize relatively quickly, as soon as you\u00a0want to take advantage of a value like this and need help, the fun is over relatively quickly. It\u2019s always about performance, business, topics, goals, KPIs \u2013 that\u2019s upheld. Most companies are compassionate as long as it does not affect their KPIs. I\u00a0do not think any company would put an employee above its own corporate goals\u201d (L06).\nOther leaders agree that it is unrealistic that a company would put an employee above its corporate goals and call for a balanced approach in order to \u201cunderstand the goals of the employee when there is a conflict of goals, and try to resolve it in communication, that you\u00a0bring both company goals and employee goals into harmony \u201c(L05). To solve that tension, some of the leaders we\u00a0interviewed are calling to transcend that paradox and really bring compassion as a core value in organizations.\n\u201cI am\u00a0also a company representative and have to make sure that the performance of the company is as it should be; that the pace we\u00a0need is maintained and that the topics that are relevant to us in business are driven forward. The more suffering my employees have and the more aches and pains, the less they will be\u00a0able to maintain this pace, the less they will be\u00a0able to maintain the standard, the less the quality will correspond to what everyone imagines. That\u2019s why compassion must also play a role from a company\u2019s point of view, otherwise you\u00a0burn people and you\u00a0do not get your topics on the street. And then, you\u00a0 can see it in KPIs and sales figures. Then you\u00a0shoot yourself in the foot. In the short term this may work, but in the long term/medium term, I\u00a0do not think it works\u201d (L06).\n4.6. Paradox #6: impact on leader\u2013 member relationship: distance (hierarchy) versus closeness (interpersonal connection)\nThe blurred line between professional and private life induced by suffering and compassion in the workplace also impacted the relationship between the leaders and members we\u00a0interviewed. The experience of compassion tended to bring leaders and members \u201ccloser,\u201d leading them to question how close is appropriate. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2015) identified a similar paradox in their conceptualization of paradoxical leadership and argue that leaders are challenged by the need to maintain distance \u2013 through vertical structural relationships\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nand differentiation in status, rank, authority and powers \u2013 while simultaneously forming interpersonal bonds (and therefore minimizing status distinctions).\nOne leader interviewed recognized clearly that addressing the suffering of employees in the workplace and taking an interest in their emotions and distress can create a tension for other leaders who would rather remain in the role of the distant and aloof superior:\n\u201c[Showing compassion to employees brings] flatter hierarchies automatically. [\u2026] I\u00a0also know other bosses who are very concerned about hierarchies. They would certainly also perceive that they consciously build up a distance and do not want to hear the personal issues not to let this closeness arise since it comes with a responsibility that you\u00a0 may have to take on, but this is additionally burdensome\u201d (L04).\nEven the leaders we\u00a0 interviewed who were convinced by the benefits of compassion at work recognized that there were some risks in getting too close to their members, including a risk of losing respect or authority.\n\u201cWhen a problem arises, [\u2026] you\u00a0also give the employees the space to become abusive towards me and then the necessary respect \u2013 not because of my age or position, but simply because of the company structure and the fact that there are always decision-makers, you\u00a0take very much out of me and sometimes cross a border\u201d (L04). \u201cThe limit is really reached when I\u00a0no longer have authority and the employees no longer do what I\u00a0want. But at the end, the employee has to do what I\u00a0want. He\u00a0is welcome to give me input and share his opinion, but if I\u00a0then say: \u201cNo, we\u2019ll do it this way now,\u201d then that has to happen. And I\u00a0think if I\u00a0do not have the authority anymore that he\u00a0 does not do it, that would be\u00a0 a limit where it becomes difficult\u201d (L02).\nGoing beyond the concept of Zhang et\u00a0al. (2015), our findings also outlined the experience of the member. Interestingly, some members also identified clear risks associated with a close relationship with their leaders, including the fact that it can make difficult conversations even harder to conduct.\n\u201cEverything that has to do with my direct job and also with success is absolutely appropriate to be\u00a0interested in it as a boss. And showing interest in personal matters is great, also appropriate, but there you\u00a0must not forget: You\u00a0still have to keep your professional distance. You\u00a0cannot think of your colleagues or your boss as your closest friend. Of course, it can happen that you\u00a0build it up outside the office, but in the end it\u2019s still about the success of the company. And if you\u00a0build up a personal relationship, they might be\u00a0setbacks. And my boss once gave an example that he\u00a0had to decide on a person he\u00a0had to dismiss. He\u00a0also told me that he\u00a0was sleepless in bed because it was extremely difficult\u201d (M03).\nAnother interesting micro-discourse illustrates well the tightrope members walk between the necessary distance and desired closeness with their leader, and how it could impact the work result:\n\u201cAt some point you\u00a0fall too far out of this professional context. When you\u00a0realize you\u00a0have a great relationship of trust there, that you\u00a0may\nno longer have only through this professional relationship, but at some point it will go into your private life in a certain form [\u2026] and then I\u00a0could imagine that the boundaries will become blurred [\u2026]. My boss is totally empathetic, helpful, courteous \u2013 yes, these are actually exactly the qualities I\u00a0expect from this compassion \u2013 then I\u00a0think to myself: \u201cOh yes, actually we\u00a0get along well and should meet sometimes..\u201d Then maybe there are some discrepancies [\u2026]. And then, of course, it reflects one-to-one on the professional relationship and I\u00a0think then you\u00a0can often misinterpret topics, or interpret too much into them. And of course, this can also worsen a work result\u201d (M01).\nThey add on, commenting on how closeness can bring confusion in terms of hierarchy levels, as well as difficulties to engage in difficult conversations such as salary negotiations.\n\u201cI think then it would just be\u00a0too much of a friendly relationship for me. And in a friendly relationship, I\u00a0think, you\u00a0are still on one level, but in a professional situation, my manager is of course superior to me. I\u00a0 think, it\u2019s just difficult \u2013 also from a communication perspective \u2013 that you\u00a0 still maintain this. He\u00a0(leader) is actually above you, but actually behaves like me on one level, but there are also various topics where this superordinate and subordinate is absolutely relevant. For example, when I\u2019m talking about salary negotiations and I\u00a0just find it difficult, if you\u00a0are too much on this friendly basis [\u2026]. I\u00a0think, it\u2019s very difficult to discuss with your management, at a serious, constructive level\u201d (M01)."

            "heading": "4.7. Strategic versus selfless compassion: a theoretical paradox?",
            "text": "Within their research, Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2019) emphasized paradoxical tensions between compassionate motives that are selfless and strategic. They define selfless compassion as springing from internal ethical virtues or conscience, whereas strategic compassion describes the value or organizational compassion as a contributor to enhanced organizational performance, productivity, and profitability. Within our study, we\u00a0also found evidence for those two motivations existing simultaneously in the leaders we\u00a0interviewed. Indeed, on one hand leaders mentioned that they are driven by ideals of humanistic values, personal determination, and prior experience in one\u2019s own personal and professional environment regarding suffering. Acts of selflessness appeared especially in situations where suffering occurred in a very personal context of the member, such as the illness of children, indications of burnout, or very strong and deep relations and commitment to the team/team members. For instance, one of the leaders provides an example:\n\u201cI took away one topic completely [from the member] during the time when the children [of the member] were ill, and I\u00a0simply said: \u201cWatch out\u00a0- if anything happens, be\u00a0it a child suffering, you\u00a0have to go to the doctor\u201d [..] then I\u00a0simply jump in. We\u00a0do a short update beforehand [..] get me on board, I\u00a0go to meetings, I\u00a0 take over certain activities in the meantime, we\u00a0 do a short handover afterward\u201d (L06).\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nThis leader also adds that \u201ccompassion is important and it\u2019s a given.\u201d Interestingly, his member confirms the statements and the selflessness of his leader by extending the scope of incidents:\n\u201cFor example, if the child is sick, then he\u00a0says: You\u00a0take care of the child. If I\u00a0have too much work, then he\u00a0says: \u201cGive something, tell me what, and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Or [\u2026] when he\u00a0notices that we\u00a0have been working so late again in the evening, he\u00a0says: \u201cOn Friday, we\u00a0finish work at two o\u2019clock\u201d\u201d (M06).\nThis example shows that the act of selflessness is recognized and is not intentionally expected but appreciated by the member.\nAt the same time, leaders in our interviews outlined that they also behave compassionately towards their members for strategic reasons, noting an increase in member performance, productivity, motivation, job satisfaction, commitment, and retention to the company. For instance, some leaders stress the link between compassion and performance:\n\u201cCompassion is definitely an issue that is important because it ultimately increases employee performance and satisfaction. [...] I\u00a0 think satisfaction is important for employee retention. Thus, I\u00a0would always say: show compassion, be\u00a0empathetic. That increases employee satisfaction and performance. And that\u2019s also measured in our company\u201d (L02). \u201cIt\u2019s simply performance enhancement. I\u00a0really mean it. An employee who feels comfortable, who feels understood, even sometimes in other situations will perform three times better than an employee who does not feel understood\u201d (L03).\nIn most of our six dyads, leaders highlight the strategic impetus of their compassionate behavior but often also link it to personal reasons/ motivations. For example, one leader explains his compassionate behavior from a strategic and personal perspective:\n\u201cThat is multi-layered. I\u00a0am\u00a0also quite honest about that. On the one hand, I\u2019m a very pragmatic person: My task is to ensure that work performance is maintained. On the other hand, because I\u00a0have been through a lot, through a relatively early death of my father, when I\u00a0was 15 [...]. In my time, a lot has happened in my immediate environment and a lot has happened to me\u00a0- I\u00a0have a lot behind me. I\u00a0 think that\u2019s when you\u00a0 become sensitive to something like that\u201d (L04). I want to actively do something about it, because it is important to me personally. [..] I\u00a0want to change something about it because I\u00a0care about it for my team and for the success of the company (L06).\nOne of the most striking outcomes in our study revealed all six members interviewed are aware their corresponding leaders show compassionate behavior rather due to strategic motives than pure selflessness. This underlines the fact that employees in our study are evaluating the compassionate behavior of their leaders critically and that they are aware of the primarily non-altruistic behavior of their leaders when it comes to alleviating their suffering. For most of the members interviewed, this compassionate leadership behavior is acceptable. Regardless of the motive behind the compassion, what they eventually expect is for their suffering to be\u00a0noticed, responded to, empathized with, and appraised accordingly both at the workplace\nand partially in personal terms when it has an impact on the work performance of the member.\n\u201cOf course, you\u00a0can say that this is simply altruism. At the same time, I\u2019m also sure that this increases team performance because suffering employees are not performant employees. And, of course, the bond with the employer. When I\u00a0feel in good hands. So, when things get tight, when I\u00a0know: Okay, my employer will take care of it at this point, is helpful. Then maybe I\u2019ll stay longer with my employer\u201d (M05).\nOther members confirm the strategic intentions of their leaders and attribute it to an organizational and team point of view:\n\u201cAI believe that there are always financial considerations involved because otherwise, an employee who is really in a crisis will effectively leave. [...]. It is perhaps not only a problem for the employee himself [...], but also for the whole team, because an employee who is in a crisis also influences the team\u201d (M05).\nFinally, some members raise the positive effects of their leader\u2019s compassionate behavior for the organization but also for themselves, even if strategic motives cause it:\n\u201cI think that\u2019s also very important in terms of performance. If you\u00a0 feel good, you\u00a0 work more productively. Then it\u2019s also very important when it comes to proactive problem solving: If you\u00a0show compassion, you\u00a0 also work more transparently, you\u00a0 address problems more readily. In the end, it\u2019s also more beneficial for the company, that\u2019s for sure\u201d (M03).\nIn addition, our findings add a different facet to the \u201cstrategic\u201d motive of compassion. Indeed, our interviewees revealed that the strategic decision to show compassion can be\u00a0self-serving. Effectively, beyond increasing organizational performance, some leaders indicated that acting to alleviate the suffering of their employees can be\u00a0necessary for their own image and reputation in the organization, to ensure their own personal success as manager.\n\u201cAbove all, it is usually the case that what others may perceive as suffering is relatively easy for you\u00a0to solve \u2013 in 80 percent of the cases it is just somehow a snap of your fingers, it does not hurt you. And in the end, it always pays off. So, let us put it selfishly: Showing compassion as a boss always pays off in the end [\u2026] the topic of loyalty or motivation is of course what you\u00a0 want to buy as a boss\u201d (L06).\nInterestingly, even this self-serving dimension of advancing the leaders\u2019 goals is apparent for some members as well:\n\u201cUltimately, happy employees are also just effective employees. So, also believe that it is in his (leader) interest if I\u00a0 suffer less, and presumably also work better. Ultimately, he\u00a0also wants his team to advance his goals\u201d (M01).\nSome members also refer to a feeling of indebtedness towards their leaders that pushes them to do a good job in return of their leader\u2019s compassionate behavior:\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\n\u201cIf he\u00a0shows compassion, she will also hope that I\u00a0will be\u00a0open to him and that I\u00a0will not come up with any excuses in any form for any topics and then perhaps feel obliged in a different way, because I\u00a0also know he\u00a0will also respond to me. Then I\u00a0also make sure that I\u00a0do a good job during the time when I\u2019m there\u201d (M06).\nTherefore, our results first indicate that leaders in our study could be\u00a0driven to behave compassionately (or not) in the workplace due to a leadership strategy to guarantee results. The recognition and full acceptance of this reality by members in our sample indicates a mutual understanding that compassion within the relation between leader and member does not need to follow pure selfless motives to alleviate the prevailing suffering. From our interviews, it seems that leaders need to balance 3 areas: serving up (upper management, company goals), serving others (members, often out of altruistic, humanistic motives), and serving oneself (maintaining position through results, career development), and that those 3 areas might have an influence on the decision to act in a compassionate manner. However, we\u00a0did not find evidence that any of our interviewees felt a paradoxical tension emerging from those opposing motives behind compassionate behavior. Instead, most of them rather presented those different motives as the different sides of a coin or as different facets of their motivation. They often referred first to their personality and values, giving them a certain sensitivity to others\u2019 suffering and triggering an emotional motivation to act to alleviate that suffering, then they added the more rational and strategic reasons that legitimize a response in the workplace context. Therefore, even though those various motivations might be\u00a0theoretically paradoxical, the actual presence of a paradoxical tension as defined by Smith and Lewis (2011) is ambiguous in our data. For this reason, we\u00a0 did not include this dimension as a paradox that leaders and members face when leaders demonstrate compassionate behavior in the workplace."

Little research so far has shown interest in the perspective of the receiver of compassion. This has recently been criticized by researchers (see for example Simpson et\u00a0 al., 2014a,b) who called for further attention to the receiver\u2019s experience. In our analysis, 1 out of 6 paradoxes is faced by the member/receiver, 4 out of 6 are faced by the leader/ giver, and 1 is faced by both. To our knowledge, some paradoxes are new and have not yet been explored in literature. Some paradoxes have been recently explored by other researchers and our study builds on them (for example Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015; Simpson and Berti, 2020).

Our study differentiates from other research of compassion paradoxes in the sense that it also focuses on the interplay between leader and member.

In particular, we\u00a0argue that social hierarchy plays an important role in 4 out of the 6 paradoxes identified.\n5.1.2.1. Showing the vulnerable, private self versus showing the strong professional self when expressing suffering\nOur findings have shown that members sometimes face a difficult decision when considering sharing their suffering or not. Indeed, the person who is the most able to offer them a solution to respond to their suffering is also the person who is evaluating their performance and making, or at least facilitating, career decisions. In that sense, members can feel that their leaders have \u201cpower-over\u201d them (G\u00f6hler, 2013), meaning that they have the capacity to enforce their will over others. This accentuates the fear of being perceived as vulnerable, weak, too demanding, incapable, thereby impacting the decision of expressing suffering. Once compassion has been received, this can also lead members to feel indebted toward their leaders and that they need to work harder to compensate (Clark, 1987, 1998; Clegg, 1989; Schmitt and Clark, 2006; Simpson et\u00a0al., 2014b). Even though our study has not shown evidence of leaders consciously manipulating their members into such position, research has shown that givers of compassion might unconsciously engender a sense of diminished agency as dependency, obligation, indebtedness, and even emotional enslavement (Szasz, 1994; Stirrat and Henkel, 1997; Simpson and Berti, 2020)."

Indeed, in the frame of compassion, actions to alleviate suffering might create a temporary situation where members benefit from different privileges and rights. In a sense, we\u00a0could argue that when practicing compassion, leaders might choose equity over equality. The decision for equity, however, might conflict with the expectations of team members. Scholars have hypothesized that organizational culture would determine which distribution principle (equity, equality, or need) group members would use to allocate resources (Mannix et\u00a0 al., 1995). Other scholars have shown that conflicts can stem from equality violations and result in nondirected conflict that is symptomatic of decreased social cohesiveness (Kabanoff, 1991).\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Our findings indicate that leaders find themselves sandwiched between their employees and their own managers, sometimes including different sets of expectations. Although previous research indicates that compassion is a quality of leaders that leads to a higher perceived leadership competency and to being acknowledged as a successful leader (Kellett et\u00a0al., 2002; Mahsud et\u00a0al., 2010; Melwani et\u00a0al., 2012), some of the leaders participating in this study fear the opposite. Indeed, they are themselves embedded in a web of hierarchy and need to constantly watch out to maintain their status in the organization. This status is naturally deeply influenced by the organizational context since compassion is shaped not only by personal and relational contexts, but also through norms and values exhibited at the organizational level (Dutton et\u00a0al., 2014; Kanov et\u00a0al., 2017; Yoon, 2017). The attitudes of managers in our interviews are particularly criticized in such contexts, leading to some participants fearing their compassionate behavior might impact their career development. This represents the dimension of courage, which is associated with relational power imbalances, manifesting in actions that threaten relationships with more powerful individuals (Koerner, 2014; Simpson and Berti, 2020). Worse, sometimes the leaders in our sample found themselves stuck between two narratives: the official narrative of the organization who claims to be\u00a0human-centric and compassionate, and the unofficial narrative that showing compassion and vulnerability equal weakness. This echoes Simpson and Berti (2020) who state that \u201ein social contexts characterized by a prominence of power abuse upheld by systemic power that normalizes social relations as taken for granted, compassionate action can involve challenging existing inequities, placing the giver in a vulnerable position of great risk, and necessitating a great deal of personal courage\u201d (Simpson and Berti, 2020, p.\u00a0444)."

            "text": "The results of our study have shown that the fact whether the leader-member relationship is considered and intended to be\u00a0more distant (focused on hierarchy) or close (focused on interpersonal connection) depends on contextual and personal factors. In this context, the Leader-Member-Exchange theory (LMX) as a developmental and dynamic process focuses on the dyadic relationship quality between leader and follower as a social exchange process (Graen and Uhl-Bien, 1995). According to Graen and Scandura (1987) leaders are developing different working relationships with their members and the relationship quality with the member is influencing the effectiveness of the leader. Studies have shown that high-quality relationships, driven by communication, trust or mutual respect and support, correlate with important outcomes such as job satisfaction, commitment or high work performance (Fairhurst and Chandler, 1989; Liden and Maslyn, 1998). Interestingly, the LMX theory does not provide any insights on how the degree of distance or closeness might impact the quality of the relationship between member and leader (and therefore effectiveness and performance). It could be\u00a0argued that close relationships are beneficial for both leaders and members. However, the results of our study in the context of \u201cdistance versus closeness\u201d have revealed contradictory insights. On the one hand, particular members are looking for establishing close, interpersonal relationships by also sharing private information and granting their leader access to their private life. On the other hand,\ncertain members are clearly distinguishing between the private and professional spheres and therefore define distant and close relationships differently. A similar logic applies for leaders. Additionally, while the participants we\u00a0interviewed hinted at the fact that compassion brought them closer with their leader or member, some of them recognized some potential difficulties that could stem from this proximity, especially around professional respect, which incidentally is also a LMX dimension. This indicates that compassion at work brings both leaders and members to act in a field of tensions stemming from the maintenance of the hierarchical structure and the partly necessary interplay between the private and professional sphere."

            "text": "So far, there is no consensus among researchers about what compassionate leadership truly is. Some argue that compassionate leader behavior is merely a skill of servant leadership (Davenport, 2015). Others have attempted to define its core dimensions that would set it apart from other leadership styles (see Shuck et\u00a0al., 2019). Worline and Dutton (2017) differentiate between leading with compassion (which \u201centails using a leader\u2019s interpersonal skills to alleviate suffering in work interactions with followers,\u201d p.174) and leading for compassion (which \u201cinvolves becoming a high-level compassion architect,\u201d p.182). The latest research around compassion paradoxes adds a new dimension to what it could mean to be\u00a0a compassionate leader. Even though paradoxes cannot be\u00a0resolved, they can be\u00a0transcended so that an individual or organization can embrace the inherent tensions simultaneously (Smith and Lewis, 2011). Since those tensions are inherent to organizations where \u201ccompeting demands cannot be\u00a0resolved but rather continually resurface\u201d (Smith et\u00a0al., 2017, p.\u00a0307), some researchers such as Simpson and Berti encourage us to approach the transcendence of organizational compassion as an ongoing accomplishment. This consideration implies that to be\u00a0 effective, compassionate leaders need to have or develop the ability to continuously transcend those compassion paradoxes, as well as support their members in transcending the paradoxes they find themselves dealing with. This is especially important since, quite ironically, the paradoxes inherent to compassion practices in organizations are sometimes causing some suffering in leaders and members. We\u00a0would argue that this even creates a deeper responsibility for organizations and their leaders to act towards the facilitation of the transcendence of those paradoxes, since the potential suffering they create might be\u00a0preventable (Kanov, 2021).\nThere is no consensus today on how to transcend a paradox. Poole and van de Ven (1989) argued that \u201cit is possible that the paradox may stem from conceptual limitations or flaws in theory or assumptions. To overcome these limitations it is necessary to introduce new concepts or a new perspective\u201d (p.\u00a0567). Based on yin-yang philosophy, Zhang et\u00a0al. (2015) encourage us to see paradoxes as \u201cstructurally and individually ambidextrous,\u201d arguing that the two sides \u201ccoexist, like yin and yang, depending on and complementing one another to jointly support leader effectiveness in people management\u201d (p.541). More recently, Simpson and Berti (2020) argued for an ongoing model in which \u201ceach day, the tensions will present themselves, providing an opportunity to make them salient and deploy cognitive, discursive, and socio-material transcendence strategies to enact wise compassion courageously supported by generative power-to, both systemic and individual.\u201d\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nWe believe that transcending the compassion paradoxes in the workplace by introducing new terms and theory will allow for the humility to accept that those paradoxes will not be\u00a0solved once and for all but will have to be\u00a0navigated each day. In turn, this might pave a way towards changing the system and equipping leaders and members systematically to develop their competence further in handling those inevitable tensions that arise from putting the human at the center (Poole and van de Ven, 1989). As we\u00a0have learned through this study and others, compassion in the workplace is challenging because it is a human, subjective experience. The degree of attention to suffering expected by leaders and members, the expected response, and many other elements vary from one individual to another. Compassion has many faces and cannot be\u00a0reduced to a box to be\u00a0ticked, otherwise we\u00a0would risk for it to be\u00a0 (perceived as) fake or manipulative. However, if we\u00a0 were to develop a new framework that recognizes compassion at work as the new \u201cnormal,\u201d including a corresponding structure and processes, and at the same time recognize that leadership today is all about handling paradoxes, we\u00a0 believe that it would allow to develop healthier and more effective practices of compassion in the workplace."

            "text": "This study is based on a qualitative research approach, entailing limitations. Collecting and analyzing our data, we\u00a0 followed a rigorous methodology and considered quality criteria. The sequential dyadic approach reduces to some extent the risk of social desirability bias, as participants are aware that their statements can be\u00a0 cross-referenced. We\u00a0 explicitly granted both anonymity and confidentiality, explaining no information would be\u00a0shared with the other part of the dyad. Using carefully worded, open questions, we\u00a0 assured participants no answer was wrong, thus increasing reliable output. Our sample was derived from our wider network and not from a general population. During the recruitment process of the participants, it was observed that potential participants who had positive relationships with their professional counterparts were more willing to participate in this study than those with less positive relationships. While our interviews did reveal (intended) negative (side) effects of compassionate behavior in leader-member dyads and overall organizations, dyads with a lower relationship quality could even stress this aspect more prominently.\nMoreover, our sample lacks diversity regarding the gender ratio of the leaders, as the dyads are characterized by male leaders only. Since theory indicates that personal characteristics, such as gender, have an impact on compassionate behavior (Goetz et\u00a0 al., 2010; Dutton et\u00a0al., 2014; Peticca-Harris, 2019; Banker and Bhal, 2020), this may have influenced the findings of the study. According to the interview data, one employee even suggested that organizations dominated by men can have a deleterious effect on compassionate behavior. Although the researchers considered a homogenous distribution in the recruiting process of the participants, the final sample is dominated by men. Therefore, future research should ensure a larger sample size with an equal ratio of male and female leaders. A comparison of males\u2019 and females\u2019 perspectives may provide further interesting insights. Since the sample consists only of German leaders and employees from an individualistic cultural\nbackground, it lacks cultural diversity and limits the findings to Western culture. Thus, further research should also consider participants from different cultures to provide a valuable contribution to research. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the interviews were conducted, coded and analyzed in the native language of the interviewees (German).\nDue to the small sample size of 12 participants, the results have limited generalizability in the context of business organizations (Malterud et\u00a0al., 2016). Thus, it seems reasonable to further validate the results of this study by increasing study-size or even turning to a longitudinal study design. Moreover, even though our original interview guideline was not initially designed for covering paradoxes in compassion, future research can build on our results and adapt the interview guideline provided by us accordingly. While our sample was limited in size and to several industries, future research still should consider examining larger samples of leaders and employees from additional industries to investigate the negative (side) effects of compassionate leadership. Further, there is evidence from the interviews that the type of organization, its culture, and its size may be\u00a0 linked to the level of suitability for leader compassion and the influence of power on the relationship. Finally, data collection through the interviews was limited by the current COVID-19 situation and, therefore, could only be\u00a0conducted via video conferences, which could have affected the results. Although the study suggests that working from home due to the pandemic has an impact on compassion between leaders and employees, the scope of this study did not encompass the role of the pandemic. Therefore, this could be\u00a0an interesting additional aspect for further research."

            "text": "This study contributes to the understanding and critical reflection of paradoxical tensions induced by compassion in the workplace by revealing new paradoxes faced by leader and member. It includes both leaders\u2019 and members\u2019 perspectives and addresses the call for further research into how firms can authentically reduce employees\u2019 suffering and promote their well-being (Frost, 1999; Peus, 2011). As previous research mostly involves theoretical studies, this study contributes by following an explorative empirical approach with the focus on dyads, therefore providing insights and perspectives that have not yet been examined by existing management literature. More precisely, we\u00a0produce initial evidence for new compassion paradoxes inherent to compassion leader behavior at work, as well as confirm and develop on previously identified paradoxes (Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al., 2019; Simpson and Berti, 2020). Drawing upon the previous works of Simpson et\u00a0al. (2014b), Ara\u00fajo et\u00a0al. (2019), and Simpson et\u00a0al. (2022), we\u00a0find indications that leaders often show compassion towards their members not only out of selfless reasons but due to strategy and rationality, calculating the resulting organizational effects, such as an increased commitment and willingness to raise efforts or stay with the team. As all of our six dyads revealed such calculations (either existing, perceived, anticipated), this raises the question to what extent\u201d compassionate leadership\u201d can be\u00a0seen as such and how to delimit it from other forms of leadership. While compassion is more traditionally associated with altruistic motives, future research on organizational\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org\ncompassion might want to acknowledge openly and from the beginning the more strategic aspects motivating compassion behavior in the workplace.\nAt the same time, several dyads showed the potential of overutilizing leaders\u2019 compassionate behavior by members, leaving leaders in the paradoxical situation that showing too much (authentic) compassion will lead to more stress-related suffering by other members. Moreover, our study revealed that members also own certain power and therefore might abuse and exploit the compassionate behavior of their leaders to their benefits \u2013 and to the detriment of the organization. Future research should explore deeper the dynamics between leader and member, and shed some more light about the power members have over their compassionate leaders. In addition, since our results also showed that power dynamics are prevalent and are being used even in strong dyadic relationships, it would be\u00a0 of high interest to investigate to which extent the issue of power plays an even more crucial and dominant role when researching weak relationships. We\u00a0 also found indications of leaders allegedly showing compassion which, in fact, belittled and patronized their members or even highlighted their deficiencies. The analysis of our dyads provided limited evidence, but some interviewees reported such situations from previous job experiences. While compassionate leadership does yield a lot of positive results, scholars need to control for negatives in empirical studies. Future research thus cannot continue to solely focus on the positive aspects of compassion but has to include a focus on trade-offs and ambiguous or even paradoxical situations. Addressing power issues in particular will be\u00a0 particularly important in order to facilitate the emergence of real compassionate leadership (Simpson et\u00a0al., 2014b; Simpson and Berti, 2020). Finally, future studies could focus on bringing to life a new model for compassion at work to transcend the current inherent paradoxes."

            "text": "Our study raises several issues which leaders and members should consider when giving or receiving compassion at work.\nFirst, the paradoxes induced by compassion at work need to be\u00a0acknowledged. Pretending they do not exist might create false expectations and ironically, more suffering. Instead, we\u00a0encourage organizations and their leaders to make these tensions salient and engage in dialogue about them. In this acknowledgement, we\u00a0would also encourage all participants to challenge the \u201ceither \u2013 or\u201d mindset towards a \u201cboth \u2013 and\u201d mindset, where they can see the two sides of a coin, like yin and yang, depending on and complementing one another to jointly support bringing more compassion at work.\nSecond, leadership development programs, independent of a focus on compassionate leadership, should raise awareness among participants concerning dealing with tensions and partially paradoxical situations when showing compassion. Since one of the most critical aspects for leaders is to deal with extreme emotionality of members in certain situations, these programs should also aim at upskilling leaders to react, respectively, to those situations. Moreover, leadership programs also should address how leaders can avoid manipulative or overreaching behavior, offering or even forcing unrequested compassionate behavior upon their members.\nComparably, leaders\u2019 sensitivity to the dangers of being perceived as patronizing or even belittling their members must be\u00a0raised in such programs. Equipping leaders with the ability to communicate the advantages of compassionate behavior as well as drawbacks for the entire team when misused by the members also should be\u00a0included to raise the overall awareness for appropriate organizational behavior.\nThirdly, leaders and organizations must be\u00a0aware of the changing perception of compassion over time, which is not only initiated by organizational members but can underlie public perceptions. Thus, practitioners must frequently reflect upon the appropriateness of compassionate behavior shown at any point to avoid a negative backlash of presumed positive behavior. Even more importantly, organizations and its leaders at all levels should reflect on the risk of advertising a compassionate culture without living it practically."

We\u00a0 also argued that the amount of suffering in the workplace is likely to continue to increase as companies deal with external and internal challenges in their pursuit of remaining relevant and successful. While compassion has proven to be\u00a0a natural answer to suffering and has shown to bring many organizational benefits, little is yet known about the role leaders have to play in bringing more compassion to the workplace and how the dynamics between leaders and members in the context of compassion are structured.\nThrough the analysis of the perceptions and actions of both leaders and members in a dyadic empirical setting, we\u00a0could reveal novel insights in the context of compassionate leader behavior by identifying six compassion paradoxes faced by leader and members. Our analysis also focused on the impact of social hierarchy in the workplace on compassion paradoxes. Finally, our research findings bring us to argue that finding a way to transcend the compassion paradoxes instead of only balancing them, might help resolve the tensions inherent to those paradoxes more sustainability and build more competence for compassion in the workplace.\nResearchers and practitioners can play an important role in transcending these paradoxes and we\u00a0describe some levers that can be\u00a0utilized to create an environment where compassion can flourish so that organizations and their people can reap the benefits of alleviating and preventing suffering in the workplace.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\u00a0made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nAuthor contributions\nCR: conceptualization, writing \u2013 original draft, data analysis, writing, and governance.
