    "abstractText": "Lichenicolous fungi are parasites of lichens. Many of these fungi are referred to as \u201cblack fungi\u201d. A diversity of these black fungi include species that are pathogenic to humans and plants. A majority of black fungi reside in the phylum Ascomycota within the sub-classes Chaetothyriomycetidae and Dothideomycetidae. To explore the diversity of lichenicolous \u201cblack fungi\u201d associated with lichens in China, we conducted several field surveys in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province between 2019 and 2020. We recovered 1,587 fungal isolates from the lichens collected during these surveys. During the preliminary identification of these isolates using the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS), partial large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU), and small subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU), we identified 15 fungal isolates from the genus Cladophialophora. However, these isolates had low sequence similarities with all known species from the genus. Therefore, we amplified additional gene regions, such as, translation elongation factor (TEF) and partial \u03b2-tubulin gene (TUB), and constructed a multi-gene phylogeny using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference. In our datasets, we included type sequences where available for all Cladophialophora species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that none of the 15 isolates belonged to any of the previously described species in the genus. Therefore, using both morphological and molecular data, we classified these 15 isolates as nine new species within the genus Cladophialophora: C. flavoparmeliae, C. guttulate, C. heterodermiae, C. holosericea, C. lichenis, C. moniliformis, C. mongoliae, C. olivacea, and C. yunnanensis. The outcome from this study shows that lichens are an important refugia for black lichenicolous fungi, such as those from Chaetothyriales.",

Many of these fungi are referred to as \u201cblack fungi\u201d. A diversity of these black fungi include species that are pathogenic to humans and plants. A majority of black fungi reside in the phylum Ascomycota within the sub-classes Chaetothyriomycetidae and Dothideomycetidae. To explore the diversity of lichenicolous \u201cblack fungi\u201d associated with lichens in China, we\u00a0 conducted several field surveys in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province between 2019 and 2020. We\u00a0recovered 1,587 fungal isolates from the lichens collected during these surveys. During the preliminary identification of these isolates using the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS), partial large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU), and small subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU), we\u00a0identified 15 fungal isolates from the genus Cladophialophora. However, these isolates had low sequence similarities with all known species from the genus. Therefore, we\u00a0amplified additional gene regions, such as, translation elongation factor (TEF) and partial \u03b2-tubulin gene (TUB), and constructed a multi-gene phylogeny using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference. In our datasets, we\u00a0included type sequences where available for all Cladophialophora species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that none of the 15 isolates belonged to any of the previously described species in the genus. Therefore, using both morphological and molecular data, we\u00a0classified these 15 isolates as nine new species within the genus Cladophialophora: C. flavoparmeliae, C. guttulate, C. heterodermiae, C. holosericea, C. lichenis, C. moniliformis, C. mongoliae, C. olivacea, and C. yunnanensis. The outcome from this study shows that lichens are an important refugia for black lichenicolous fungi, such as those from Chaetothyriales.\nKEYWORDS\nAscomycota, biodiversity, Chaetothyriomycetidae, lichens, multi-gene phylogeny, Yunnan Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region"

            "text": "\u201cBlack fungi\u201d are characterized by dark-colored mycelia due to the buildup of melanin in their cell walls (Ametrano et\u00a0 al., 2019). This melanization of the cell wall allows them to colonize extreme habitats, such as rock surfaces and lichen thalli (Gostin\u010dar et\u00a0al., 2012). These groups of fungi can also have an assortment of thallus morphologies, such as yeast, pseudo-filamentous, and filamentous (Gostin\u010dar et\u00a0 al., 2012). When co-cultured with compatible algae, several black fungi show an earlier stage of lichenization, such as the formation of lichen-like fungal plectenchyme (Brunauer et\u00a0al., 2007; Muggia and Grube, 2018). A majority of black fungi reside in the phylum Ascomycota within the sub-classes Chaetothyriomycetidae and Dothideomycetidae (Harutyunyan et\u00a0 al., 2008). One such genus is Cladophialophora, from the order Chaetothyriales.\nCladophialophora is a genus of asexual dematiaceous (darkly pigmented) fungi. This genus of fungi is distinguished by branched or unbranched chains of conidia with hyaline conidial scars produced through blastic conidiogenesis (Sutton et\u00a0al., 2009; Obase et\u00a0al., 2016; Khan and Sohnle, 2019). Currently, Cladophialophora includes about 45 accepted species with diverse ecological habitats. Species of Cladophialophora has been isolated from an assortment of substrates, such as plants, soil, sports drinks, human, and lichens (Obase et\u00a0al., 2016; Usui et\u00a0 al., 2016; Tang et\u00a0 al., 2017). At least 11 of them are human pathogens, with three being plant pathogens (Obase et\u00a0al., 2016). Several species, including C. megalosporae, C. normandinae and C. parmeliae, were isolated from different lichen species, and were considered lichenicolous fungi (Harutyunyan et\u00a0al., 2008; Diederich, 2010; Diederich et\u00a0al., 2013, 2018).\nLichenicolous fungi usually reside within lichens as parasites, and many are broad-spectrum pathogens, saprotrophs, or commensals (Lawrey and Diederich, 2003; Diederich et\u00a0 al., 2018). So far, approximately 2000 obligatory lichenicolous species and over 60 facultative lichenicolous species have been identified (Diederich et\u00a0al., 2018). These species are categorized into 10 classes, 55 orders, 115 families, and 397 genera (Diederich et\u00a0al., 2018). Around 50 lichenicolous fungi have been reported from China. It is estimated that the number of lichenicolous fungal species can exceed over 425\u00a0in China (Hawksworth and Mariette, 2003; Kondratyuk et\u00a0al., 2013, 2016a,b, 2017, 2020).\nTo explore the fungal diversity associated with lichens, we\u00a0conducted several field surveys in two climatic zones of China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, between 2019 and 2020. During these surveys, we\u00a0collected various species of lichens from these regions. We\u00a0isolated an assortment of fungi from the medullary tissues of these lichens. Preliminary morphological and molecular identification of these fungi using the ITS gene region, we\u00a0 identified 15 isolates of black fungi. Further molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these isolates belonged to the genus Cladophialophora, but did not represent any of the previously described species. Therefore, we\u00a0classified these 15 isolates as nine new species within the genus Cladophialophora."

Each lichen thallus was individually stored in paper bags at 4\u00b0C inside a cooler box and brought back to the laboratory for fungal isolations.\nAll lichen thalli were repeatedly rinsed with sterile denoised water and surface sterilized for 10 min under UV lamp. Using a Leica Zoom 2000 stereo microscope, the upper cortex of the thallus was scraped off and pieces of medullary tissues were rinsed in sterile deionized water. These tissue pieces were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Co., Ltd., China) amended with 0.05% streptomycin (Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., China).\nAll Petri plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 days in darkness. Mycelia emerging from medullary tissue pieces were sub-cultured onto fresh PDA plates. After that, pure cultures were obtained using single hyphal tip technique. All the ex-holotype cultures of new fungal species described in this study were deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC), Beijing, China. The holotype specimens were deposited in the Institute of Microbiology (HMAS), Beijing, China (Accession numbers are listed in Table\u00a0 1).

Individual gene regions were phylogenetically analyzed using the method described below, followed by the compilation and analysis of a concatenated dataset.\nPhylogenetic analyses of single gene and concatenated datasets were done using three approaches. These were maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI). Software for ML and BI analyses were accessed through the CIPRES Science Gateway v. 3.31 (Miller et\u00a0al., 2011). The best evolution models of each dataset were estimated using jModelTest2 (Darriba et\u00a0al., 2012). ML analyses were conducted using RAxML-HPC2 with GTR + GAMMA as the substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replications (Stamatakis, 2014). MrBayes v. 3.2.7 (Ronquist et\u00a0 al., 2012) was used for the BI analyses with the best substitution model TIM1 + I + G for SSU, TIM2ef + I + G for ITS, TrN + I + G for LSU, TPM2uf + I + G for TUB, TrNef+G for TEF, and SYM + I + G for concatenated data set. Four MCMC chains were run from a random starting tree. Twenty million generations were run with trees sampled at every 100 generations, resulting in 200,000 trees. Tracer v. 1.72 was used to determine the chain convergence and the effective sample size values. We\u00a0discarded a quarter of sampled trees (50,000) during burn-in. Posterior probabilities were calculated from the remaining trees.

Henceforth, we\u00a0 used the ML tree emerging from the analyses of concatenated dataset for delineation of Cladophialophora species recovered in this study (Figure\u00a01). This concatenated data included 63 taxa (Table\u00a01) and 3,199 characters, SSU 1\u2013913, ITS 914\u20131,651, LSU 1652\u20132,487, TUB 2488\u20132,955, and TEF 2956\u20133,199. Bootstrap values \u226575% and posterior probability \u22650.90 were considered reliable (Figure\u00a01, Supplementary Figures S1\u2212S5).\nIn the concatenated tree, Cladophialophora isolates CGMCC3.20360, CX08B15, CGMCC3.20359, and CGMCC3.24219 formed a monophyletic lineage that emerged as the sister to a clade that included Cladophialophora tengchongensis and Taxon 4 (see below). Among these four isolates, the monophyly of CGMCC3.20360 and CX08B15 (Taxon 1) received significant statistical support (ML/ MP/BI: 97/99/0.99; Figure\u00a0 1). Isolate CGMCC3.20359 (Taxon 2) emerged as the sister taxon to Taxon 1 (Figure\u00a01). CGMCC3.24219 (Taxon 3) was sister to the clade that included Taxon 1 and Taxon 2 (Figure\u00a01). Even though the monophyly of these four isolates obtained considerable branch support in the concatenated tree, there was still a significant difference in the gene regions between the taxa (Figure\u00a02).\nIsolates CX19Da and CGMCC3.20428 (Taxon 4) emerged as the sister taxa to C. tengchongensis in concatenated tree (Figure\u00a0 1). However, this relationship varied between the single gene trees (Supplementary Figures S1\u2212S5). We\u00a0were unable to amplify the TEF of the isolate CGMCC3.20428, as well as the SSU, LSU, TUB, and TEF of CX19Da. In ITS sequences, there were three base pairs differences between isolates of Taxon 4.\nIn the concatenated tree, four isolates of Taxon 5 (CGMCC3.20425, CX37A11, CX39A4, and CX39D4) emerged as a monophyletic lineage with significant branch support (ML/MP/BI: 100/100/1) and sister to a clade that included Taxon 1, 2, 3, 4, and C. tengchongensis (Figure\u00a01). However, the latter relationship did not receive significant branch support. Hence, it varied between the single gene trees (Supplementary Figures S1, S2, S4). Additionally, between the isolates of Taxon 5, we\u00a0detected some polymorphisms. There were a 16-bp differences in TUB between the pairs CX39A4/CGMCC3.20425 and CX39D4/CGMCC3.20425.\nIn the concatenated, ITS, and TEF trees, isolate CGMCC3.20305 (Taxon 6) emerged as sister to C. nyingchiensis (Figure\u00a0 1, Supplementary Figures S1, S5). This relationship was statistically significant (ML/MP/BI: 91/\u2212/0.97).\nIn the concatenated tree, isolates CGMCC3.20424 and CGMCC3.20362 (Taxon 7) formed a monophyletic clade with high statistical support values (ML/MP/BI: 100/100/1) and emerged as the sister to C. multiseptata with moderate statistical support (ML/MP/BI: 75/\u2212/1; Figure\u00a01). However, this relationship was inconsistent across the single gene trees (Supplementary Figures S1\u2212S5). We\u00a0 also identified some polymorphism between the isolates CGMCC3.20424 and CGMCC3.20362 (ITS 6, SSU 1, TEF 3, TUB 1).\nIn the concatenated tree, CGMCC3.20361 (Taxon 8) did not group with any known species of Cladophialophora (Figure\u00a01). This relationship was echoed in the LSU, SSU, and TEF trees (Supplementary Figures S2, S3, S5), but in the ITS and TUB trees, Taxon 8 formed a monophyletic clade with C. bromeliacearum\n(Supplementary Figures S1, S4). None of these relationships received significant branch support.\nCGMCC3.20346 (Taxon 9) emerged as a sister taxon to C. potulentorum and C. australiensis in concatenated tree (Figure\u00a01). However, this relationship was inconsistent across the single gene trees (Supplementary Figures S1\u2212S5)."

            "text": "In this study, 15 Cladophialophora isolates were recovered from nine lichen species collected from Yunnan Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Analyses of morphological characteristics and molecular data using phylogenetic approaches revealed that these 15 isolates belonged to nine novel species from the genus. Consequently, these species were classified as C. flavoparmeliae, C. guttulate, C. heterodermiae, C. holosericea, C. lichenis, C. moniliformis, C. mongoliae, C. olivacea, and C. yunnanensis.\nThe phylogenetic analyses in this study were carried out using five gene regions, namely ITS, SSU, LSU, TUB, and TEF. For the majority of previously identified Cladophialophora species, only sequences for ITS and LSU are available. Sequences of SSU, TUB, and TEF were available for 23, 8, and 15 species, respectively. This is why the tree topologies of the single-gene and the concatenated datasets differed substantially. During the phylogenetic analyses, we\u00a0also realized that ITS and LSU were sufficient for discriminating a majority of Cladophialophora species. This is most likely why several newly described species, such as C. aquatica (Boonmee et\u00a0 al., 2021), C. cabanerensis (Crous et\u00a0al., 2020), and C. tumbae (Kiyuna et\u00a0al., 2018), were based on these two gene regions. However, it was challenging for us to discriminate closely related species, such as C. holosericea, C. olivacea, and C. guttulate, without using sequences from protein-coding gene regions. For example, the ITS sequence was insufficient for distinguishing C. olivacea from C. holosericea. Similarly, LSU alone was unable to differentiate between C. olivacea and C. guttulate. TEF, on the other hand, was able to differentiate all three species. In the future, considering to amplify protein-coding gene regions, such as TEF and TUB, in addition to ITS and LSU would positively influence the taxonomy of Cladophialophora.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 14 frontiersin.org\nIn the phylogeny, 46 species of Cladophialophora with available DNA sequences in GenBank were included. However, in the MycoBank, there are currently 54 species listed under this genus. Among the species excluded from this study, C. brevicatenata [MB 412793], C. hachijoensis [MB 412796], and C. kellermaniana [MB 412797], have been reclassified as Tyrannosorus hanlinianus (Shen et\u00a0 al., 2020), Pseudocladosporium hachijoense (Braun, 1998), and Alternaria malorum (Braun et\u00a0al., 2003), respectively. We\u00a0compared the micro-morphological characteristics of C. cladoniae [MB 800397], C. hawksworthii [MB 800398], C. megalosporae [MB 800399], and C. normandinae [MB 800400] with those of our nine species. These four Cladophialophora species have conidiomata (Diederich et\u00a0al., 2013), a characteristic that was absent from our species. However, we\u00a0 were unable to compare the morphology of C. bennettii [MB 491905] to our species due to the unavailability of publication information for this species in any of the recognized databases, such as MycoBank and Index Fungorum. This evidence shows that all nine new species identified in this study were previously undocumented.\nThe species of Cladophialophora formed three distinct clades in the phylogenetic tree constructed using the concatenated dataset. Among these, C. hostae, C. scillae, and C. behniae formed the basal clade. Based on some previous studies, the phylogenetic position of this clade within Cladophialophora is controversial because these species might represent a new family (Gueidan et\u00a0al., 2014; Quan et\u00a0al., 2020). Similarly, the clade that included C. proteae, C. eucalypti, C. pucciniophila, C. modesta, C. sylvestris, C. humicola, and C. minutissima might not also include fungi from Cladophialophora. In a recent study, fungi from this clade grouped into various other families within Chaetothyriales (Quan et\u00a0 al., 2020). We\u00a0 opted to include these species in our phylogenetic studies because they are still classified as Cladophialophora. However, based on the data from this study and previous research, we\u00a0propose a full taxonomic revision of the genus Cladophialophora.\nA majority of Cladophialophora species, including those described in this study, emerged as a monophyletic clade with significant branch support values. This clade also included the type species, C. carrionii. Previously, based on SSU, LSU, and RPB1 sequence data, this clade included two phylogenetic groups: the Carrionii-clade and the Bantiana-clade (Badali et\u00a0al., 2008; de Hoog et\u00a0al., 2011). However, in a recent phylogeny of Chaetothyriales using ITS and LSU data, the existence of these clades was disputed (Quan et\u00a0al., 2020). In this study, a phylogenetic tree constructed using a concatenated dataset showed the existence of the Carrionii-clade and the Bantiana-clade, but without significant branch support. Aside from that, the species composition of these clades did not completely overlap with that of Badali et\u00a0al. (2008). This suggests that Carrionii-clade and Bantianaclade are not well defined and should be\u00a0used with caution.\nAmong the isolates of the species identified in this study, polymorphism was detected between sequences for the same gene region, for example, C. lichenis and C. yunnanensis. Sun et\u00a0al. (2020) and Badali et\u00a0 al. (2009) while describing C. nyingchiensis and C. carrionii, respectively, also reported this trend. There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. These fungi have multiple copies of the ITS and TUB genes, as do many other fungi (Fourie et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2014). Alternatively, these sequence differences between the isolates might also be\u00a0the product of cryptic species. This is because multiple copies of TEF in fungi have yet to be\u00a0reported. However, TEF sequences varied by 20 bp among C. nyingchiensis\nisolates (Sun et\u00a0al., 2020). This dilemma may be\u00a0resolved in the future by species discovery and the recovery of additional isolates of identified species.\nLichenicolous fungi can exclusively parasitize the mycobiont (mycoparasites), the photobiont (phycoparasites), or sometimes both by forming haustoria (Lawrey and Diederich, 2003; Diederich et\u00a0al., 2018). Irrespective of their host choice, lichenicolous fungi can be\u00a0further classified into two types. These are slow-growing species that cause no or minor symptoms in their hosts, and fast-growing ones that are highly pathogenic to lichens (Harutyunyan et\u00a0al., 2008). Based on these facts, we\u00a0hypothesize that all nine Cladophialophora species described in this study were of the former type. The relationship between these nine species and their lichen host is either biotrophic or commensal (Lawrey and Diederich, 2003). This explains why we\u00a0saw no symptoms on the lichen from which we\u00a0 isolated these fungi. However, infection trials are necessary to confirm their interaction with their hosts.\nResults of this study indicated that Cladophialophora is an important lineage of lichenicolous fungi. However, a majority of lichen-associated species are yet to be\u00a0discovered. We\u00a0still do not know the precise role of these fungi and black fungi as a whole in lichen thallus. The lack of symptoms in the lichen thalli where these fungi were isolated suggests that these fungi can also be\u00a0saprophytes or stress-associated latent pathogens that only exhibit symptoms when the host lichen is subjected to stress (L\u00fccking et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, a large number of guttles in the hyphae of all Cladophialophora species identified in this study, especially C. guttulate. Therefore, there is scope for evaluating the potential to use these fungi in the production of microbial oil."
