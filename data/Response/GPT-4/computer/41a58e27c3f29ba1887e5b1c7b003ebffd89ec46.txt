Integration with Real-time Monitoring Systems: Developing an integrated system that combines the proposed segmentation method with real-time network monitoring platforms. This system would automate the detection and analysis of network incidents as they happen, enabling quicker responses to network disruptions and performance degradation. Research could focus on minimizing computational overhead to ensure the method's scalability in real-time applications.

Adaptive Thresholding for Cluster Segmentation: Exploring adaptive algorithms for determining the dendrogram cut-off threshold for hierarchical clustering segmentation. Since the optimal threshold can vary depending on the dataset's characteristics, an adaptive approach that analyzes the dataset's structure in real-time to adjust the threshold could yield more accurate clustering and segmentation results.

Cross-Layer Analysis for Enhanced Network Insights: Extending the segmentation method to perform cross-layer analysis by incorporating additional network metrics (e.g., packet loss, jitter) alongside delay measurements. This approach could uncover more complex correlations and causations behind network incidents, offering a more comprehensive understanding of network behavior.

Machine Learning Models for Pattern Prediction: Utilizing machine learning techniques to predict changes in network delay patterns based on historical segmentation results. By training models on segmented delay data, future research could aim to forecast potential network issues before they occur, improving preemptive measures against network failures.

Comparative Studies on Different Linkage Methods: Conducting in-depth comparative studies of various linkage methods (beyond complete and Ward linkage) used in hierarchical clustering for network delay segmentation. This research could identify which linkage methods are most effective under different network conditions and dataset characteristics, potentially leading to the development of a hybrid approach that dynamically selects the most suitable linkage method based on the data being analyzed.
