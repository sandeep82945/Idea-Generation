Here we describe a neuraminidase-targeting monoclonal antibody, FNI9, that potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of all group 1 and group 2 IAVs, as well as Victoria/2/87like, Yamagata/16/88-like and ancestral\u00a0IBVs. FNI9 broadly neutralizes seasonal IAVs and IBVs, including the immune-evading H3N2 strains bearing an N-glycan at position 245, and shows synergistic activity when combined with anti-haemagglutinin stemdirected antibodies. Structural analysis reveals that D107 in the FNI9 heavy chain complementarity-determinant region 3 mimics the interaction of the sialic acid carboxyl group with the three highly conserved arginine residues (R118, R292 and R371) of the neuraminidase catalytic site. FNI9 demonstrates potent prophylactic activity against lethal IAV and IBV infections in mice. The unprecedented breadth and potency of the FNI9 monoclonal antibody supports its development for the prevention of influenza illness by seasonal and pandemic viruses.\nSeasonal influenza viruses represent major causes of severe respiratory tract infections resulting in 300,000\u2013600,000 deaths per year worldwide3. IAVs have a vast host tropism that includes different animal species such as swine, bats and various wild birds, which represent the primary reservoir of these viruses. This wide tropism fosters viral evolution and leads to zoonotic infections as well as pandemics4. IBVs predominantly circulate in humans and display lower genetic diversity but can cause severe disease especially in children and high-risk individuals5.\nIAV and IBV infectivity relies on two glycoproteins expressed on the viral envelope that work in concert6. Haemagglutinin (HA) binds to the sialic acid (SA) receptor and is pivotal for endosomal membrane fusion, leading to virus uncoating7. Neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-destroying enzyme that cleaves SA, facilitating the release of viral particles from infected cells8. NA is also crucial for penetration of the virus through the mucus layer by cleaving decoy receptors that are abundantly present in mucins9,10. Owing to their complementary roles, HA and NA activities must be finely balanced to allow viral entry and egress from host cells11,12.\nDespite the lower abundance on the viral envelope than HA8,13, NA represents a key target for neutralizing antibodies. The protective role of\nanti-NA antibodies has been documented following the 1968 pandemic in which the H3N2 virus carried an NA antigenically related to the previously circulating H2N2 virus14. In addition, more recent studies have demonstrated that serum antibodies with NA inhibition (NAI) activity are an independent correlate of protection against IAV infection15\u201317. Besides blocking the interaction of the enzymatic pocket with SA receptors, NA antibodies can also promote Fc-mediated protection in vivo18. Although NA neutralizing antibodies can be induced by natural infection, the anti-NA immunity elicited by current influenza vaccines is weak, mainly due to the low abundance and poor stability of the NA antigen, and to the lack of standardization of the amount of NA in approved vaccines19.\nIn view of the antigenic diversity of IAVs and IBVs, the identification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) covering both viruses and their variants remains challenging. Several anti-HA stem neutralizing mAbs that recognize the antigenically distant groups 1 and 2 HAs of IAVs have been identified. When tested in a therapeutic setting, these mAbs showed no or only limited efficacy20,21. However, one of these mAbs is currently being tested in a phase II prophylactic study22. Anti-NA mAbs with broad reactivity may represent a complementary and possibly synergistic approach to anti-HA stem mAbs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06136-y\nReceived: 19 September 2022\nAccepted: 26 April 2023"

Here we identify a mAb, designated FNI9, which displays an unprecedented breadth and potency against both IAVs and IBVs via receptor mimicry. These findings together with the synergy with HA stem-directed mAbs support the development of FNI9 for the prevention of influenza illness by seasonal and pandemic viruses.\nIsolation of pan-influenza anti-NA mAbs Sera from almost 200 healthy individuals were screened for the presence of IgG cross-reacting antibodies to non-human circulating group 1 (N4) and group 2 (N3 and N9) NAs transiently expressed on the surface of mammalian cells (Fig.\u00a01a). One donor, designated \u2018I\u2019, with high reactivity against these NA antigens was selected. More than 10 million peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived IgG+ memory B cells from this donor were interrogated using a N1-based baiting strategy (N1 from H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004) and 14,625 cells were sorted and then seeded as single cells in co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells. Culture supernatants were screened for inhibition of N1 sialidase activity by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). As ELLA also identifies antibodies that inhibit NA activity by steric hindrance, we further screened the NAI activity of the antibodies in the cell supernatants using the 2\u2032-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate to select mAbs that directly target the enzymatic pocket of group 1 (N1) and group 2 (N2) NAs. Fourteen mAbs (designated FNI mAbs) were identified and found to belong to a single clonal family diversified by a high load of somatic mutations. These antibodies use IGHV1-69 and IGK3-15 genes and are characterized by heavy chain complementarity-determinant region 3 (HCDR3) that is 21 amino acids long (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a\u2013e and Supplementary Table\u00a01).\nThree mAbs\u2014FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19\u2014stood out for their binding to a broad panel of cell-surface-displayed seasonal and animal circulating IAV and IBV NAs (Fig.\u00a01a,b, Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Table\u00a02). To confirm their broad NAI activity, the three mAbs were tested in a MUNANA assay with N1, N2 and IBV NA antigens (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b). The previously described broadly neutralizing anti-NA mAb 1G01 (ref. 24) was also included as a positive control. FNI9 and FNI19 displayed NAI activity similar to 1G01 to N1 and N2 NAs but stronger inhibition of enzymatic activity to the IBV NAs. FNI17 demonstrated the weakest NAI activity versus N2 antigens but the strongest inhibition of IBV NAs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b).\nWe next assessed FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 mAbs for their neutralizing activity against a panel of seasonal IAV and IBV strains spanning more than 80 years of NA antigenic evolution (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Table\u00a03). The three FNI mAbs efficiently neutralized all IBVs tested, with FNI17 showing the highest potency in line with the NAI results. Conversely, 1G01 mAb neutralized only a fraction of IBVs tested, consistent with its reported limited coverage of IBV strains24. Potent neutralization was observed for all the mAbs to seasonal H1N1 strains (Fig.\u00a02a). Of note, 1G01, but not FNI mAbs, was affected by the oseltamivir-resistant mutation H275Y27 (Fig.\u00a02a), which was present in up to 68% of H1N1 seasonal strains pre-2009 H1N1 pandemic28. Although all anti-NA mAbs efficiently neutralized the H3N2 strains isolated before 2015, the activity of FNI17 and 1G01 was strongly impaired by the most recent H3N2 isolates (Fig.\u00a02a). Since the 2014/2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, a new N-linked glycosylation site at position 245 was introduced on the N2 NA as a result of the S245N and S247T substitutions (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c). This glycan, which is located at the entry of the NA enzymatic pocket, has been present since then in all seasonal H3N2 viruses, and has been shown to reduce the activity of antibodies targeting the catalytic site29,30.\nTo dissect the effect of the N245 glycan on antibody activity, we produced a panel of three N2 antigens derived from H3N2 strains isolated before and after 2015 together with their counterparts in which the glycosylation site was either introduced or removed (Supplementary Table\u00a04). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed that FNI17 Fab has weaker affinity than FNI9, FNI19 and 1G01 towards N2 antigens even when the glycan N245 was not present, and glycosylation further decreased its binding (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Table\u00a04). Although the 1G01 Fab displayed the highest binding affinity in the absence of the glycosylation, the presence of the N245 glycan severely dampened 1G01 binding to all N2 antigens tested (Fig.\u00a02b). Despite\u00a0the N245 glycan being associated with decreased binding to N2, FNI9 and FNI19 retained nanomolar binding affinity (Fig.\u00a02b). Consistent with SPR results, all mAbs showed similar inhibition of N2 enzymatic activity when the N245 glycan was not present, but the introduction of the glycosylation resulted in a marked decrease of NAI activity by FNI17 and 1G01 compared to FNI9 and FNI19 (Fig.\u00a02c). Our results for 1G01 are in line with those recently reported31, indicating a decrease in NAI activity by this mAb to N2 bearing the N245 glycan, albeit 1G01 in\u00a0vivo protection was retained at the single dose tested. Overall, FNI9 and FNI19 mAbs were found to be the most active to contemporary H3N2 strains carrying the N245 glycosylation as well as to oseltamivir-resistant strains.\n592 | Nature | Vol 618 | 15 June 2023"

Of note, FNI9 showed the highest NAI activity against N9 from H7N9 among the clonally related antibodies. FNI mAbs displayed comparable NAI activity to pseudoparticles decorated by low pathogenic avian influenza viruses N3, N4 or N5, with the latter not being sensitive to the 1G01 mAb (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03b). Finally, the FNI9 mAb demonstrated broad inhibitory activity across a panel of pseudoparticles presenting NAs from enzootic IAVs circulating in swine and dogs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). Besides inhibiting enzymatic activity and viral replication in vitro, FNI9 induced complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity, mediated the lysis of infected cells by human primary natural killer cells (antibodydependent cell cytotoxicity) and promoted antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis by monocytes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04).

            "text": "To elucidate the structural basis for the FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 broad neutralizing activity, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of their Fabs in complex with NA from H3N2 A/Tanzania/ 205/2010 at 2.9 \u00c5, 2.3 \u00c5 and 3.1 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively (Supplementary Table\u00a05). The overall topology of the FNI9\u2013NA complex adopts a C4 symmetry, with each NA protomer bound to a Fab (Fig.\u00a03a). FNI9, FNI17 and FNI19 all adopt the same binding mode (Fig.\u00a03b), inserting the HCDR3 into the enzymatic pocket where residues R106 and D107 establish multivalent salt bridges with the NA active site residues R118, D151, R292 and R371 (ref. 35) (Fig.\u00a03c).\nThese four NA active site residues also form the primary interactions with SA, suggesting that the broad neutralizing activity of FNI mAbs is the result of receptor molecular mimicry (Fig.\u00a03d,g), similar to the binding mode of oseltamivir (Fig.\u00a03e,g). By contrast, 1G01 interactions within the enzymatic pocket are distinct from those observed for the SA receptor, oseltamivir and the FNI mAbs (Fig.\u00a03f). Of note, both 1G01 and FNI mAbs\u00a0also interact with E227, which contributes to form the NA active site framework (Fig.\u00a03c,f). Owing to the functional constraints associated with the SA receptor interactions, the key contact residues of the FNI mAbs are highly conserved across IAV and IBV\nNAs (Fig.\u00a03h,i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05). Moreover, in\u00a0vitro resistance studies with live virus as well as deep mutational scanning via an NA library expressed in mammalian cells revealed a very limited number of NA mutations capable of reducing, but not abrogating, the binding or activity of FNI mAbs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Table\u00a04). Of note, most of these mutations were only retrieved after several rounds of viral passages, are associated with a decrease in the NA sialidase activity and are extremely rare in human and animal isolates, suggesting a fitness cost for the corresponding virus mutants and a high barrier to resistance for this class of anti-NA antibodies (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06).\nTo obtain a more detailed understanding of the binding epitopes of FNI mAbs, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FNI\u2013NA complexes were performed using the complete glycans revealed by peptide mapping liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07). Although the analysis of the static structures shows similar binding energies for the FNI9\u2013NA and FNI17\u2013NA complexes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a), the MD-derived total dynamic binding energy predicts that FNI9 is a stronger binder (\u2212370 MOE (molecular operating environment)\u00a0kcal per mol) than FNI17 (\u2212250 MOE kcal per mol) for NA from the H3N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 strain (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08b,c), in line with binding affinity measurements (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Table\u00a04). The interactions are balanced across more residues in the FNI9\u2013NA complex than in the FNI17\u2013NA complex both in the epitope (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08d) and in the paratope (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08e), providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the superior binding of FNI9.\nWe next investigated the structural basis for the reduced binding affinities to N2 antigens bearing the N245 glycan. Two-dimensional classification of the cryo-electron microscopy data showed the presence of N2 tetramers carrying the N245 glycan saturated with three or four FNI9 Fabs (6.08% with three FNI9 Fabs and 91.20% with four\na\nd\n242/252 loop\n+FNI9\n\u2013FNI9\nN245\nFNI9\nN2\nN2 +Glyc245 +/\u2013FNI9c\nS245 \u2013FNI9\n+FNI9\n242/252 loop\nN2\nFNI9\nN2 \u2013Glyc245 +/\u2013FNI9b\n+Glyc245\n242/252 loop\nFNI9\n\u2013Glyc245\nN245\nN2\nN2 +/\u2013Glyc245 \u2013FNI9\n91.20% 6.08% 1.39%\nFNI9 FNI17 FNI19\n22.97% 77.03% 0.68%6.05%93.27%\n4 Fabs 3 Fabs 0 Fab 1 Fab 0 Fab 0 Fab3 Fabs4 Fabs\nFig. 4 | FNI mAbs induce a conformational change in the 242/252 loop when N245 is glycosylated. a, 2D and 3D classifications and percentages of classes of FNI9\u2013NA (N2 A/Hong Kong/2019) showing four, three and zero Fabs bound to the tetramer (the condition with a single Fab bound is not shown: 1.33%), FNI17\u2013NA (N2 A/Tanzania/2010 with S245N and S247T) showing one and zero Fabs bound to the NA tetramer, and FNI19\u2013NA (N2 A/Hong Kong/2019) with zero, three and four Fabs bound to the NA tetramer. b, N245 glycosylated (+Glyc245; grey) and non-glycosylated (\u2212Glyc245; brown) NAs reveal very similar conformations of the 242/252 loop in the unbound state.

These data are consistent with the lower binding affinity and neutralizing activity of FNI17 than FNI9 and FNI19 versus the N2 antigens and viruses bearing the N245 glycan (Fig.\u00a02a,b).\nStructural analysis revealed that the conformation of the 242/252 loop, which contains the N245AT247 glycosylation motif, is not influenced by the presence or absence of the N245 glycan (Fig.\u00a04b). In N2 NA structures without the glycan, there is no clash with the antibody and the 242/252 loop adopts virtually indistinguishable conformations in both bound and unbound states (Fig.\u00a04c). By contrast, following binding of the FNI9 antibody, both the 242/252 loop and the N245 glycan undergo a dramatic conformational change to avoid a clash between the Fab and the glycan (Fig.\u00a04d). The energy required for the induced fit of loop 242/252 could underlie the differences in affinity and neutralizing activity of the FNI mAbs against the recent N2 NAs."

            "text": "To assess the in\u00a0vivo activity of FNI9 in a mouse model, we produced a murinized IgG2a form of this mAb (muFNI9) and a N297Q mutant (muFNI9(N297Q)) that lacks FcRs and complement C1q binding36. For comparison, we also produced the same murinized versions of MEDI8852, a broadly IAV neutralizing anti-HA stem antibody34. The four mAbs were prophylactically administered via intravenous injection to BALB/c mice 24 h before lethal challenge with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Mice receiving muFNI9 were completely protected from loss of body weight down to 0.9 mg kg\u22121 and displayed limited loss of body weight at 0.3 mg kg\u22121, with all the animals recovering throughout 14 days (Fig.\u00a05a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). Administration of muMEDI8852 conferred full protection from body weight loss down to 3 mg kg\u22121; whereas moderate-to-significant body weight loss was observed at 0.9 and 0.3 mg kg\u22121, respectively (Fig.\u00a05b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). When the same antibodies were tested with the N297Q mutation,\nmuFNI9(N297Q) displayed protection comparable with that of the parental antibody at all the doses tested (Fig.\u00a05c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). By contrast, muMEDI8852\u00a0bearing\u00a0N297Q showed a marked decreased activity at limiting doses (0.9 and 0.3 mg kg\u22121), consistent with previous findings on the role of effector function in protection by anti-HA stem-directed antibodies37 (Fig.\u00a05d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). Overall, these data indicate that FNI9 has strong prophylactic activity against lethal infection with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34, which does not appear to be dependent on Fc-mediated effector functions at the doses tested.\nNext, we observed that mice prophylactically administered with an ineffective dose of MEDI8852 combined with FNI mAbs in a 1:1 ratio were overall better protected from morbidity than those receiving only the same amount of FNI mAbs contained in the mix, suggesting that the activity of anti-HA stem antibodies can benefit from the association with NA-inhibiting antibodies (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09b).\nGiven the similarity in the mechanism of action, we compared the prophylactic activity of a single injection of FNI9 with daily administration of oseltamivir in BALB/c mice lethally challenged with a panel of IAVs and IBVs (Fig.\u00a05e\u2013h). Daily administration of oseltamivir at 10 mg kg\u22121 (ref. 38) reduced viral titre by approximately 1 log against IAVs (H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 or H3N2 A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016) and no further viral titre reduction was observed by doubling the dose (20 mg kg\u22121) of the small molecule. Conversely, FNI9 at 3 and 0.9 mg kg\u22121 reduced lung viral titres by 4 and 3 logs after challenge with H1N1 A/ Puerto Rico/8/34 and by 3 and 2 logs after challenge with H3N2 A/ Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 that carries the N245\u00a0glycan (Fig.\u00a05e,f). A viral lung titre reduction comparable with the one provided by oseltamivir was obtained with both IAVs when FNI9 was administered at 0.3 mg kg\u22121 (Fig.\u00a05e,f).\nIn line with the lower in\u00a0vitro potency and clinical efficacy against IBVs than IAVs39,40, oseltamivir did not show significant activity to IBVs B/Victoria/504/2000 (B/Yamagata/16/88-like virus) and B/Brisbane/ 60/2008 (B/Victoria/2/87-like virus). Conversely, administration of FNI9 significantly reduced viral lung titres to B/Victoria/504/2000 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 down to 0.3 mg kg\u22121 (Fig.\u00a05g,h).

            "text": "The effectiveness of current influenza vaccines is often suboptimal due to mismatch with circulating seasonal strains, immunological imprinting and limited immunogenicity, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals2,41. Previous studies have shown that NA-directed antiviral drugs are effective in prophylaxis42,43, albeit their use in this setting is limited by their short half-life and potential selection of escape mutants. Furthermore, anti-NA serum antibodies have been shown to independently correlate with protection from IAV infection15,44. In comparison with other previously described anti-NA mAbs23,24, the FNI9 mAb presented in this study displays larger breadth and higher potency across seasonal IAVs and IBVs, including contemporary H3N2 strains. The SA receptor molecular mimicry exploited by the FNI9 mAb might provide an additional layer of protection from viral escapes, as the key interacting residues in the epitope are evolutionarily conserved in human and animal IAVs and IBVs and most of the NA mutations retrieved from in\u00a0vitro resistance studies are associated with a fitness cost for the virus. Of note, molecular mimicry of the SA receptor was also observed for anti-HA mAbs45, which displayed limited breadth. The features of the FNI9 mAb combined with half-life extension through Fc modifications46 support its development as a single dose per\u00a0season prophylaxis against influenza.\nThe synergistic activity observed when\u00a0FNI9 is combined with the MEDI8852 mAb is consistent with previous reports on the synergy between oseltamivir and anti-HA stem mAbs34. In addition, other studies have shown that anti-NA mAbs can increase the Fc-mediated protection by anti-HA stem mAbs47,48. We therefore speculate that FNI9 efficacy could be further increased by synergy with endogenous anti-HA stem antibodies elicited by previous infections or vaccinations.\nCollectively our findings support the notion that NA is an important target for influenza prophylaxis and justify ongoing efforts to produce recombinant stabilized NA immunogens49,50 to elicit broadly reactive NAI antibodies, thus contributing to the development of a universal influenza vaccine."

The plates were incubated for 2.5\u20135 h at 37 \u00b0C, then the reaction was stopped with MUNANA stop solution (0.2 M glycine/\n50% Et-OH, pH 10.7) and the NA activity was measured by fluorescence using Cytation5 (excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm).\nSPR assays to measure binding of Avi-tagged NA proteins by Fabs Measurements were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument. A CM5 chip with covalently immobilized anti-Avi tag polyclonal antibody (A00674-40, GenScript) was used for surface capture of NA proteins bearing the Avi tag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE). Running buffer was filtered with HEPES-buffered saline with added P-20 and calcium chloride (HBS P+ CaCl2: 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% w/v P-20 and 10 mM CaCl2).

Experiments were performed with a fourfold dilution series of monomeric Fabs (800, 200, 50 and 12.5 nM) and were run as single-cycle kinetics.\nData were double-reference subtracted and fit to a binding model using Biacore Insight software. The 1:1 binding model with a constant Rmax was used to estimate the kinetic parameters. For each ligand (NA protein), a constant Rmax, which is the maximum of all Rmax values for all Fab analytes from the default 1:1 binding analysis, was applied, under the assumption that all Fabs have the same Rmax for a specific NA protein ligand. The consistent capture level of each ligand over all cycles (within 8%) justifies this assumption. The experiment was performed twice with two technical replicates for each ligand (NA protein). Kd values were reported as the average of two replicates. For measurements in which the dissociation constant Kd is slower than the detection range of the instrument (Kd < 10\n\u22126 s\u22121), the binding affinity (Kd) is denoted as less than 0.01 nM.\nVirus titration and in\u00a0vitro neutralization assays Virus titres were determined by FFU assay on MDCK-LN cells, using immunofluorescence staining.

For the CA09 study, there were eight passages of virus and a final concentration of 64\u00d7 the IC50 of FNI9 (3,200 ng ml\n\u22121). For identification of genomic mutations, viral genomic RNA was extracted using the Zymo QuickRNA Viral Kit (R1034) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the RNA concentration was\nmeasured using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Q10210, Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III One-Step RT\u2013PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (12574018, Invitrogen) using the MBTuni-12 (5\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGCAAAAGCAGG-3\u2032) and MBTuni-13 (5\u2032-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG-3\u2032) primers, and the PCR fragments were purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter). Next, the amplicons were fragmented using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E6177L, NEB), then adaptors and indexes were added using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (7335L, NEB). DNA samples were purified using NEBNext Sample purification beads and then quantified using the Qubit DNA HS Assay kit (Q32854, Invitrogen), and verified using a D500 tape station (G2964AA, Agilent). Finally, the samples were diluted and pooled, then sequenced using a MiSEQ analyser with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (MS-102-3003) and PhiX Control v3 (FC-110-3001). The NA mutations I223R and S247N first appeared in passages 6 and 7, respectively, and each reached 50% of the total next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads by passage 8."

Seven-to-eight-week-old BALB/c female mice (Charles River Laboratories) received a single dose of muFNI9, muMEDI8852, muFNI9(N297Q), muMEDI8852(N297Q) or vehicle control on day \u22121 via intravenous injection, 24 h before infection, based on day \u22122 individual body weight. On day 0, animals (n = 6 per group) were infected intranasally with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (VR-95PQ, ATCC). Mice were monitored once daily from days 0\u20133, and twice daily from days 4\u201314. Body weight was measured daily from day 4 to day 14, and serum was collected at day 0 (pre-infection) for mAb quantitation.\nThe prophylactic activity of MEDI8852 and FNI17 mAbs administered singly or in a 1:1 combination on the response to H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 infection or human MEDI8852, FNI19 and muMEDI8852 and muFNI9 mAbs on the response to H3N2 A/Hong Kong/1/1968 was assessed in BALB/c female mice at 0.25 or 0.125 mg kg\u22121. Body weight loss and survival from days 0 through to day 14 post-infection were used as major end point. The area of the negative peaks, defined as the area between the body weight line of each animal over the 14 days and the 0% body weight loss baseline, was calculated using GraphPad prism 9 and used to compare the prophylactic activity of the anti-HA stem, anti-NA and the combination of the two mAbs.\nThe prophylactic efficacy of FNI9 to influenza B/Victoria/504/2000 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 was assessed in 7\u20138-week-old BALB/c female mice by administering a single dose of FNI9 or vehicle control on day \u22121 via intravenous injection, 24 h before infection.

Animals were infected intranasally with influenza B/Victoria/ 504/2000 or influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 (ViraPur) virus on day 0. Serum was collected 2 h before infection on day 0 for IgG quantitation. Animals were euthanized on day 3 and lung and body weights were recorded. Infectious virus titres were measured in lung homogenate supernatants collected on day 3 (PFU per gram of lung) using a plaque assay.\nThe in\u00a0vivo prophylactic studies involving human FNI9 IgG mAb and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/Singapore/INFHH-16-19/2016 viruses were performed in compliance with federal laws and institutional guidelines and have been approved by the Washington University in St. Louis IACUC. Seven-to-nine-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomized based on age before antibody treatment and virus infection. Anti-NA mAbs were administered as a single intravenous injection 24 h before\nvirus infection. For oseltamivir treatment, the mice were orally dosed with 10 mg kg\u22121 of oseltamivir phosphate 2 h before infection and then once daily for 5 days.

TCID50 titres were calculated using the Spearman\u2013Karber formula.\nIgG quantification was performed using an electrochemiluminescencebased immunoassay. Standard curve and quality controls were diluted in BALB/C mouse serum (Biovit) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in aliquots until needed for the quantitation assay. Reagents and samples were equilibrated to room temperature for at least 30 min. Sera, standard curve and QCs were then centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min before use. For the murine mAbs quantification, multi-array 96-well standard plates (Meso Scale Discovery) were coated with NA protein (N9) or HA protein (H5) at 4 \u03bcg ml\u22121 or 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121, respectively. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, then washed with PBS\u20130.05% Tween (PBS-T) and blocked with casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher) at room temperature for 2 h. Sera were diluted 1:20 with BALB/C mouse serum, followed by a 1:50 (for anti-NA mAb) or 1:100 (for anti-HA mAb) dilution with casein, that was performed for standard curve and QCs as well. Plates were washed with PBS-T, then 50 \u03bcl of diluted samples, standard curve and QCs were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse-SULFO TAG (Meso Scale Diagnostics) was used for detection at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 for FNI9 and 0.75 \u03bcg ml\u22121 for muMEDI8852 to the plates previously washed with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h. After final washes with PBS-T, 150 \u03bcl of MSD Read buffer was added per well, and plates were read on an MESO Quickplex SQ 120. Human mAbs were quantified with the same method but using an anti-LS antibody for capture and anti-CH2-SULFO TAG for detection.\nDeep mutational scanning profiling A deep mutational scanning approach was used to determine how NA amino acid mutations affect mAb binding. A cell-surface display library based on N1 A/California/07/2009 was generated with all variants for 170 select amino acids included. The mutated residues include epitope residues within 8.0 \u00c5 distance from bound Fabs obtained from cryo-EM (FNI17\u2013Fab and FNI19\u2013Fab in complex with N2 A/ Tanzania/205/2010; this study) and crystal structures (FNI3\u2013Fab with N2 A/Tanzania/205/2010 (unpublished), 1E01\u2013Fab (PDB: 6Q20), Mem5\u2013Fab (PDB: 2AEP) and B10\u2013Fab (PDB: 6N6B)). In addition, residues with known sequence variation in GISAID in the past 20 years for H1N1 and H5N1 were included.\nLibrary construction, lentivirus production, next-generation sequencing and data deconvolution were performed by the Genetic Perturbation Platform (GPP) of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. A detailed description of each of these methods has been previously described81. For library synthesis, the lentiviral vector pMT025 encoding the wild-type N1 A/California/07/2009 open reading frame with the addition of a C-terminal minimal HA tag via a 2\u00d7G4S linker was synthesized and used as a template to generate the variant library pool. The full-length variant pool with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking adapters containing NheI and MluI, respectively, was synthesized at Twist Biosciences. Following restriction digest cloning and pDNA amplification, the variant composition of the pDNA library was assessed by NGS using the Illumina Nextera XT platform. All 3,472 designed variants were detected, and the\ndistribution of the variants was approximately log-normal with a 1.3-fold standard deviation in the read counts across the variants. Lentiviral particles were produced according to protocols available through the GPP (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols). The library was transduced into FreeStyle 293-F Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a MOI of approximately 0.3 and maintained at an average representation of 2,000 cells per variant.\nFor the screen, mAb binding to cell-surface-displayed NA was determined by flow cytometry. mAbs were directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through free amine conjugation to enable fluorescence-based detection. 293-F cells containing the NA variant library were harvested 5\u20137 days after puromycin selection, washed in PBS containing 3% BSA and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mAbs for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then sorted in technical duplicate on two separate sorters (BD Aria Fusion or Sony MA900). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A minimum of 60 million cells were prepared for FACS per technical replicate. 293-F cells expressing the NA variant library were sorted by FACS into negative, low and high mAb-binding bins, and the distribution of variants in each bin was determined by NGS as described below. The NA open reading frame includes a minimal C-terminal HA tag, which was also screened against using the Alexa Fluor 488 anti-HA.11 epitope tag antibody (BioLegend) to determine how mutations at each of the 170 selected residues affect general protein expression. For each screen, a minimum of 5 million unsorted library cells were collected to serve as unsorted controls.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from sorted samples and unsorted controls with the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (with the following modification: 0.3 M NaCl was added to the lysis buffer and incubation at 56 \u00b0C extended to 4 h) and the QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen), respectively. Genomic DNA was prepared for NGS as previously described81. In brief, the open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers (forward: 5\u2032-ATTCTCCTTGGAATTTGCCCTT-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-CATAGCGTAAAAGGAGCAACA-3\u2032) and processed for NGS using the Illumina Nextera XT kit. Samples were sequenced using the Nextseq2000 sequencing platform to obtain paired-end reads with 2 \u00d7 150 cycles. Sequence data processing and variant calling using the mutant detection software ASMv1.0 was performed as previously described81. Normalized reads for each sample are log2 transformed. log2 fold-change values comparing the negative sorted bin to the unsorted pool and the low-binding and high-binding FACS-sorted bins for each library variant were computed and then averaged both for the anti-HA tag and the anti-NA antibody. Potential escapes were defined as those having an HA tag signal close to the silent mutations (maximum of two standard deviations away from the mean of the silent mutations) and having an anti-NA signal close to the stop codon mutations (maximum of three standard deviations away from the mean of the stop codon mutations)."

            "text": "All experiments involving animals reported in Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d,g,h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09 were approved by the Burleson Research Technologies, Inc. (BRT) Animal Care and Use Committee (study number: BRT20220306, BRT 2022072 and BRTQ20220307) and by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (PHS assurance number D16-00898). The BRT has been accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International. The IACUC chair who approved the protocols was also the Lead Veterinarian for these studies, and together with the Study Director was kept apprised of body weight loss and clinical observations for these studies daily. In addition, both the Lead Veterinarian and the Study Director personally checked on the status of study mice throughout each of the studies.\nOn the basis of extended experience with the influenza model at the BRT, specific weight loss limits were not set for the study reported in Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09 (BRT20220306 and BRTQ20220711), as mice with 30% (or greater) body weight loss had normal cage activity levels indicated by the ability to climb to access the food hoppers and build nests and to interact with cage mates as expected. In addition, mice with weight loss that exceeded 30% were shown to be able to recover from infection in this model. In such scenarios, the BRT would not euthanize the mouse but instead would wait until the next observation period to reassess behaviour along with any further body weight loss. At each observation period, both the Lead Veterinarian and the Study Director specifically checked for animals that met euthanasia requirements as listed in both the study protocol and the IACUC protocol.\nGiven the nature of the study and the weight loss involved, measures were undertaken to minimize pain, distress and discomfort as much as possible, including providing DietGel to aid in providing hydration and nutrition from the time of infection through to day 14, increased frequency of animal observations (twice daily, at least 5 h between observations on days 4\u201314 and on other days if adverse clinical signs were observed), daily body weight and clinical observation updates provided to the Study Director and veterinarian, and humane euthanasia if animals were deemed unlikely to recover from infection.\nIn addition to protocol-driven euthanasia requirements, although body weight loss was not used as an end point, it was used to further evaluate the mice and help to inform euthanasia decisions. If, for example, body weight loss was high and was not stabilizing and/or if body weight loss was high and other clinical signs (especially a strong decrease in movement or activity) were observed, animals were immediately humanely euthanized as either scenario was generally a good indication that the mouse was unlikely to recover from infection.\nProcedures, facilities and housing were in compliance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were euthanized at 3 days post-infection (Fig.\u00a05g,h; BRT 2022072) or throughout a 14-day observation period (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09; BRT20220306 and BRTQ20220711) according to the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2020 edition and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.\nAll experiments involving animals reported in Fig.\u00a05e,f were approved by Washington University in St. Louis IACUC (Animal Welfare Assurance D16-00245). All facilities involving animal research were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Procedures, facilities and housing were in compliance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were euthanized at 4 days post-infection according to the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2020 edition and in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.\nA power analysis (80%) with type 1 error set at 5% based on an estimated effect size and historical data were used to determine animal numbers for experiments and to keep the number of animals used to a minimum."
