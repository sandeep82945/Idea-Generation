            "text": "The Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry theory, proposed in 1923, establishes that an acid and a base react by exchanging a proton to form their conjugated base and acid.1,2 This theory has been widely used in science to predict and explain the chemistry when mixing an acid and a base. The acid\u2013base reaction is typically represented by the following chemical equation,\nHA + B % A + HB+ (1)\nwhere HA and B are the acid and base, respectively, and A and HB+ their conjugated forms. The double arrow in eqn (1) denotes the presence of chemical equilibrium between the species, which is strictly dened by the thermodynamics of the reaction.3,4 Hence, according to the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory, a solution containing an acid and a base can only exist as a mixture of the four components, where the ratio between\nniversity, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803,\nlogy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New tgers.edu\n(ESI) available: Additional details in spectra of the mixtures at different\nterated samples. Computed frequency tion of the hydrogen bond angle and 784a\n006\nthe reactants and products is dened by the equilibrium constant. It is possible to argue that the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry theory should only be used in the context of aqueous solutions and the difference in the acidity constants of HA and HB+, dened as DpKa\u00bc pKa(HB+) pKa(HA), directly represents the equilibrium or equivalently the propensity of the reaction to shi in either direction. Instead, for binary mixtures of non-aqueous solvents the reaction should be expressed in terms of the autoprotolysis of the components,\nA + HB+ % HA + B (2)\nwhere HA and B are the conjugate acid and base of the ionic species, respectively. In this case, the equilibrium constant is expressed as KS \u00bc [HA][B] (see ref. 5) because the KS values can be directly determined from potentiometric studies without requiring the pKas of the components in the different solvents.6 As the DpKa in aqueous solutions, the pKS (or equivalently KS) describes the propensity of the binary mixture to being ionized. Hence, a system with a large positive (negative) value of pKS will have very low (high) concentration of the neutral species.\nThe pKS formalism has been used to predict the ionic conductivity of many molecular liquids and solutions, but it fails to explain cases such as the mixture of acetic acid and 1- methylimidazole.7 In aqueous solutions, acetic acid is a weak acid with a pKa of 4.75,8 and 1-methylimidazole is a weak base with a pKb of 6.99,8 and their mixture reacts spontaneously.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

However, the acetic acid and 1-methyl imidazole mixtures have high ionic conductivities comparable to strong acids, and they have been referred to as pseudo-protic ionic liquids because of the lack of ionization.7,9 Note that this behaviour is not limited to the selected acid\u2013base pair and has been observed in other binary mixtures.10\nThis article reports a previously uncharacterized chemical species formed between acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole that can serve as a molecular framework for explaining the fascinating physico-chemical behaviour of similar acid\u2013base mixtures. Here the hydroxyl group of the acetic acid directly interacts with the unsubstituted nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring, forming an acid\u2013base hydrogen bonded complex (top right panel of Fig. 1). Notably, the hydrogen bond in this acid\u2013base pair has a signicantly reduced distance between the O and N atoms, and leads to a different potential energy surface in which the acidic hydrogen atom participating of the hydrogen bond is more delocalized (Fig. 1). This quantum mechanical phenomenon is similar to the effect of reducing the length for a quantum particle conned in a 1D square potential (i.e., particle in the box).\nHydrogen atom delocalization has oen been observed in short and strong hydrogen bonds in the active site of enzymes,11\u201314 excess proton and conformationally rigid molecules in solutions,15\u201319 but the hydrogen bond complex observed in this work is highly intriguing because the donor and acceptor are two different molecules in solutions where the dynamical\nFig. 1 Geometries and potential energy surfaces along the O\u2013H stretch coordinate of an acetic acid dimer (left) and an acid\u2013base complex (right) from ab initio computations in gas phase.

It also reveals that electronic and nuclear quantum effects help delocalize the proton conferring an additional stabilization energy to the acid\u2013base complex.\nFinally, the formation of a molecular species, rather than ionic species, with a delocalized hydrogen atom in a mixture of simple acids and bases challenges the traditional and current knowledge of acid\u2013base chemistry, since in those theories the acidic hydrogen can only be localized either close to the acid or the base, but not shared in between the two participating moieties. In other words, the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry theory does not contemplate the possibility of a molecular species in which the hydrogen is shared between an acid and a base."

            "text": "The lack of a chemical reaction between acetic acid and 1- methylimidazole is readily seen in the IR spectra of the acid\u2013 base mixtures (Fig. 2a). Across the entire range of molecular ratios spanning XHA of 0.1 to 0.67, the band corresponding to the asymmetric stretch of acetate, usually located at 1560 cm 1,20 is not observed (Fig. S1\u2020). Instead, the addition of acetic acid to 1-methylimidazole leads to the appearance of at least one very broad band between 2200 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 (blue and red zones in Fig. 2a). This broad band is very visible in the IR spectrum at low molar fractions of the acid (XHA < 0.1) or the base (XHA > 0.9, Fig. S2\u2020), but is absent in the pure acid or base. The intensity of the new IR peak presents a signicant temperature dependence (Fig. S3\u2020), strongly suggesting that the broad band correspond to the complex and that the complex is directly related to acetic acid. This is because at higher temperature the amount of acid\u2013base complex and its IR signature are reduced while the acetic acid and its corresponding band(s) are increased in agreement with the temperature dependence of a hydrogen bonded system.21 In line with the previous results and their interpretation, the new IR band (blue region in Fig. 1a) also shows linear dependence with the acid concentration (Fig. S2\u2020). In addition, a substitution of the acidic hydrogen in acetic acid with deuterium results in a broad band at 1900 cm 1 from the 2300 cm 1 of the pure deuterated acid (Fig. S4\u2020), showcasing the isotopic dependence of the transition frequency of the complex band, or equivalently, the large participation of the O\u2013H stretch in this vibrational mode. Overall, the dependence of the IR features with temperature, acid concentration and the isotopic nature of acidic hydrogen is consistent with broad peak containing the vibrational signature of a one-to-one acid\u2013base complex formed between the acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole (Fig. 1). It is possible to argue that this broad band is a mixed vibrational state involving the out of plane C\u2013O\u2013H bend and O\u2013H stretch,22\u201324 and does not come purely from the hydrogen bonded acid\u2013base complex. However, the deuterated sample has broad band at much lower frequency, which suggest that this mode contains a large portion of the O\u2013H stretch and the band is a characteristic IR feature of the complex.\nChem.

It is important to note that ionic species are not directly detected in these mixtures via IR spectroscopy, which is in good agreement with previous studies7,25 and supports the hypothesis of no traditional acid\u2013base reaction even when the mixture of has an excess enthalpy of 7 kJ mol 1.6,7,25\nThe hypothesis that the experimental IR features originates from the formation of an acid\u2013base complex is further validated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. These simulations reveal the presence of many different hydrogen bonded structures in the acid\u2013base mixtures. However, in all the investigated concentrations, 1-methylimidazole always forms a one-to-one hydrogen bonded complex with acetic acid (Fig. 1). The AIMD simulations also conrm that the complex is formed by the direct interaction of the hydroxyl group of the acid with the unsubstituted nitrogen of the imidazole ring via a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2b). Notably, it is observed that the acid\u2013 base pair forms a hydrogen bond with a distance shorter than 2.7 A\u030a, irrespective of the molar fraction of the acid (Fig. 2b), showcasing that the acid\u2013base complex has a short hydrogen\n7000 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 6998\u20137006\nbond at all concentrations. While this hydrogen bond keeps the participating molecules at short distances, the complex appears to have a large number of possible conformations stemming from the almost free thermal rotation of the acid and the base around the hydrogen bond (Fig. 2c). In addition, the hydrogen bonded complexes are not isolated, but generally participating in extended hydrogen bond networks with up to three other acid or base molecules.26\nThe assignment of the IR bands to the formation of the acid\u2013 base complex is conrmed by the IR spectrum computed from the AIMD simulations of the mixture with XHA \u00bc 0.67. In good agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 2a, d and S5\u2020), the theoretical IR spectrum presents at least one band in the 2200\u2013 3500 cm 1 region. The decomposition of the simulated IR spectrum shows that the spectral components below 2750 cm 1 originate from 1-methylimidazole and the high frequency component at 3100 cm 1 arises from acetic acid (Fig. 2d). This assignment validates our hypothesis that the formation of the 1- methylimidazole\u2013acetic acid complex gives rise to some of the IR bands seen experimentally in the 2200\u20133500 cm 1 region of the IR spectra. It is important to note that IR spectrum in the AIMD does not contain mixed states, which strengthens the hypothesis that the IR signatures in the 2200\u20133500 cm 1 region arise from the complex. Moreover, it is likely that the O\u2013H\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Overall, the strong resemblance between the simulated and the experimental IR spectra (Fig. 2a, d and S5\u2020) strongly indicates that AIMD simulations properly capture the molecular structures of the complexes because the vibrational modes are very sensitive to their local molecular environment.27 Thus far, the experimental and theoretical data evidence the formation of short hydrogen bonds as a result of the formation of the complex between acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole, which are observed through their spectral signatures in the IR region.\nRecently, the link between short hydrogen bonds and the appearance of broad vibrational bands at lower frequencies (1000\u20132000 cm 1) than the hydroxyl stretch ( 3500 cm 1) was demonstrated for the excess proton in solutions.28\u201332 For example, a study on the acid aqueous solutions revealed that molecular species, such as the Zundel cation, present broad IR peaks in the same spectral regions arising from vibrational modes directly linked to the shuttling of the excess proton.33,34 Hence, the broad bands in the IR spectra (Fig. 2a) are attributed to the acidic hydrogen shuttling modes of the complex upon the formation of a short hydrogen bond between acetic acid and 1- methylimidazole. This relation is further conrmed from ab initio frequency calculations of the vibrational modes for representative congurations deduced from the AIMD simulations.\nFig. 3 Vibrational mode analyses of representative acid\u2013base complexes from ab initio calculations in gas phase. (a) Structures of the complexes composed of acetic acid hydrogen bonded to 1-methylimidazole (left) and their IR vibrational modes. Left and right panels correspond to two different angular conformations of the complex as depicted on the top. Note that the IR absorption peaks are from harmonic frequency calculations, and they are only intended to illustrate the absorption in the broad 2200\u20133000 cm 1 region. (b) Atomic displacement for the proton shuttling mode of the complex. The left, center and right modes have an associated frequency of ca. 1600 cm 1, 1700 cm 1 and 2200 cm 1, respectively.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nThe computed vibrational modes of 6 representative congurations of clusters in gas phase (Fig. 3a) show that all of the complexes exhibit strong vibrational absorptions in the 2200\u20133000 cm 1 region, in agreement with the experimental and simulated IR spectra from AIMD (Fig. 2a and c). Moreover, all these vibrational modes involve atomic motions directly related to the shuttling of the acidic hydrogen atom in the acetic acid molecule (Fig. 3b). The vibrational mode computations of clusters also reveal the presence of two distinct groups. The rst group corresponds to the hydrogen shuttling modes of the acidic hydroxyl group directly interacting with 1-methylimidazole and has transition frequencies below 2750 cm 1 (blue lines in Fig. 3a). In contrast, the second group has transition frequencies between 2750 cm 1 and 3100 cm 1 (red lines in Fig. 3a) and is associated with hydrogen shuttling modes that involve exclusively acetic acid molecules further along the chains of the hydrogen bond network (Fig. 3a). Remarkably, the vibrational modes with displacements of the hydrogen atom parallel to the hydrogen bond (Fig. 3b) have very large transition dipoles (greater than 3000 km mol 1), while the shuttling modes with perpendicular displacements of the hydrogen atom have more typical transition dipoles ( 500 km mol 1).27 The uncharacteristically large transition dipole of the hydrogen shuttling mode explains its mixing with other modes and overtones.22\u201324\nNormal mode computations of clusters in gas phase also reveal that the broadness of the hydrogen shuttling bands (Fig. 2a) might arise from the dependence of the vibrational transition frequencies on the geometry of the complex. More specically, the hydrogen shuttling frequency is strongly dependent on the angle between the planes of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor (Fig. 2) due to a concomitant shortening of the complex hydrogen bond (Fig. S6\u2020). As a result, the large number of angular conformations adopted by the acid\u2013 base pair causes the hydrogen shuttling mode to span in a 250 cm 1 region (Fig. S7\u2020). Hence, the exceedingly large transition dipoles and frequency of the hydrogen shuttling modes in the acid\u2013base complex make these shuttling modes easily observed via IR spectroscopy, and the strong dependence of their transition frequencies with the geometrical arrangement of the complex along with its thermally allowed distribution of angles are likely to contribute to the broad bandwidth of these shuttling modes.\nPrevious studies on the excess proton in aqueous solutions demonstrated that the broad vibrational bands in the IR spectra were directly associated with the changes in the potential energy surface of the proton shuttling coordinate.31,35 The same effect is observed here for the potential energy surfaces of the hydrogen shuttling coordinate in isolated cluster of both the acid dimer and the acid\u2013base complex (Fig. 4a and b). In the case of the acetic acid dimer, the potential energy surface has a single minimum with a curvature of 439 kcal (A\u030a 2 mol 1). In contrast, when acetic acid forms a hydrogen bond with 1- methylimidazole, the potential energy surface shows a second minimum with a low barrier of 5 kcal mol 1 for transferring the proton between the donor and acceptor atoms, and the curvature in its global minimum reduces to 270 kcal (A\u030a 2\nChem.

While the associated frequency for the hydrogen shuttling changes from 3320 cm 1 in the acid dimer to 2600 cm 1 in the acid\u2013base complex, or from 2410 cm 1 to 1890 cm 1 upon deuteration, and evidences the variations in the curvature of the potential energy surfaces, the shape of the potential surfaces explains why the acid\u2013base complex results in a short hydrogen bond. Unlike the case of the acetic acid dimer (Fig. 4a), the acid\u2013base pair (Fig. 4b) presents a hydrogen transfer barrier ( 5 kcal mol 1) comparable to the zero-point energy of the O\u2013H stretch mode ( 4 kcal mol 1), which allows the delocalization of the hydrogen atom in the potential well. Moreover, the hydrogen delocalization is heightened by hydrogen bonding to an additional acetic acid, as seen in the decrease of the proton transfer barrier by 4 kcal mol 1 in potential energy surface for such complex (Fig. 4c) indicating that electronic effects also play a role in the delocalization process.\nThe special characteristics of hydrogen bond in the acid\u2013 base pair are also evaluated from the free energy surfaces of proton shuttling from the AIMD simulations. In the absence of a hydrogen bonded 1-methylimidazole, the shuttling of the\n7002 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 6998\u20137006\nacidic hydrogen in an acid dimer (HAc$HAc, Fig. 4d) has two local minima with a barrier of 4 kcal mol 1, indicating that the proton is positioned close to one of the two acid molecules forming a normal hydrogen bond. In contrast, the free energy landscape for the shuttling of the acidic hydrogen is drastically altered when 1-methylimidazole is part of the hydrogen bond network. In this case, the barrier for proton shuttling (MIm$H$Ac of Fig. 4e) is four times lower ( 1 kcal mol 1) than in the pure acid. Consequently, the acidic hydrogen in the acid\u2013base complex has a much larger probability of being delocalized within the hydrogen bond than in those of the acid\u2013acid pairs.\nGiven the quantummechanical nature of the hydrogen atom (i.e., nuclear quantum effects) and the extent of the delocalization deduced from the AIMD free energy surfaces, the hydrogen atom delocalization is investigated via ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (AI-PIMD) simulations, which include both electronic and nuclear quantum effects.36\u201338 The resulting AIPIMD free energy surfaces show that the hydrogen shuttling potential in the acid\u2013base complex is almost barrier-less (Fig. 4e). Although a similar decrease in the barrier is observed for the other hydrogen bond pairs, the hydrogen\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

These results demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects of the acidic hydrogen atom play a signicant role in the energetics of the acid\u2013base complex. In particular, the quantum nuclear effects lower the hydrogen shuttling barrier, and consequently, favour the delocalization of the hydrogen atom within the hydrogen bond.\nThe energetic stabilization of chemical species via nuclear quantum effects is not new and has been proposed to play a major role in the formation of the Watson\u2013Crick base pair.39 The presence of signicant non-classical effects in the acid\u2013 base complex arises from the quantum kinetic energy penalty as a result from localizing a quantum particle, such as the hydrogen atom.12 Hence, a decrease of the energy barrier in the hydrogen shuttling potential not only results in a reduction of the energy penalty in the system, but also leads to a substantial expansion of the region where the hydrogen atom can be positioned; i.e., delocalization.\nThe delocalization of the acid hydrogen in the acetic acid and 1-methylimizadole mixtures is also deduced from the 1H NMR spectra of the different solutions because one of the most distinctive features of delocalized hydrogen atoms in short hydrogen bonds is their far downeld 1H NMR chemical shis.12 Typically, the 1H chemical shi for the hydroxyl group of an acid is around 12 ppm.40 However, when an acidic hydrogen atom is delocalized within a strong hydrogen bond, the 1H nucleus is further deshielded resulting in a 1H chemical shis well above 14 ppm and sometimes close to 20 ppm.41,42 This extreme behaviour in the chemical shi of the delocalized hydrogen is also found in the acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole samples, where the addition of 1-methylimidazole shis the chemical shi of the acid proton from 12 ppm in the pure acid to 15\u201316 ppm in the mixture (Fig. 5). It is important to note that the observed chemical shi is an average of the chemical shi of the possible species, in this case delocalized and nondelocalized acidic hydrogen atom, due to the ultrafast times\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nscale of the chemical exchange of the process as compared to the NMR time resolution.43 The observed chemical shis for the hydroxyl proton are in good agreement with the formation of species where the hydrogen atom is delocalized, or equivalently, largely deshielded.\nMixtures containing deuterated acetic acid also display a large 2H chemical shis of the deuterium atom, though they are slightly lower than the corresponding 1H samples (Fig. 5). The large chemical shi of the 2H nucleus conrms the delocalization of the acidic deuterium atom, where their lower chemical shi as compared to 1H evidences the quantum mechanical effect driven exclusively by a change in the zeropoint uctuations rather than changes in the interaction potential between the deuterium atom and the carboxylate group.44 Computations of the NMR chemical shi for the acidic hydrogen atom in very dilute (XHA \u00bc 0.02) and concentrated (XHA \u00bc 0.67) solutions conrm the large downeld shi in the 1H NMR region of the acid hydrogen seen in the experimental data (Fig. 5). Hence, the NMR data further validates our hypothesis that the hydrogen delocalization occurs in the mixture of acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole because of the presence of a strong hydrogen bond in the acid\u2013base complex."

            "text": "This work showcases an intriguing and previously uncharacterized chemical species in acid and base mixtures that stems from the direct and strong hydrogen bond interaction between acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole, which is not predicted by traditional theories of acid\u2013base chemistry. Unlike conventional hydrogen bonded complexes, this acid\u2013base pair forms a short hydrogen bond where the acidic hydrogen atom is delocalized or shared between the donor and acceptor groups. This species with a delocalized acidic hydrogen has distinctive features in the IR and 1H NMR spectra. In particular, it has a broad vibrational absorption band in the 2250\u20133000 cm 1 region and an exceedingly large downeld chemical shis of one of the 1H nuclei in the complex. The spectroscopic signatures of the complex are assigned, via simulations of the system, to the shuttling vibrational mode and the 1H nuclei of the acidic hydrogen, respectively. More importantly, the IR and NMR features evidence substantial changes in the potential energy surface (i.e., curvature and lengthening of the O\u2013H bond) associated with the formation of a strong hydrogen bond in the acid\u2013base complex, where the hydrogen atom is delocalized. In addition, it is also established from the theory that both nuclear and electronic quantum mechanical effects play a signicant role in dening the structure and energetic of acetic acid and 1- methylimidazole hydrogen bonded complex. Overall, our studies on the mixtures of acetic acid and 1-methylimidazole highlight the importance of quantum mechanical electronic and nuclear effects in dening acid\u2013base chemistry of this pair. However, it is likely that many other acid and base pairs have this interesting behavior. To this end, this study showcases the experimental tools needed (i.e., IR and NMR spectroscopies) and their corresponding signatures for determining the occurrence of proton delocalization in such systems.\nChem.

Periodic boundary conditions were applied for all the systems. The simulations were performed with a time step of 0.5 fs in the canonical ensemble at 321 K. In the AIMD simulations, the Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat53,54 was used to control the temperature. In the AI-PIMD simulations, each atom was represented by 6 ring polymer beads using the path integral generalized Langevin equation method.55 The AIMD simulations were performed for a total of 300 ps for the mixtures with XHA of 0.02, 0.67 and 0.86. The simulation lengths were 140 ps and 150 ps for the systems with XHA of 0.99 and 1.00, respectively. The AI-PIMD simulations were performed for 50 ps. Note that the PBE density functional was used in the quantum chemistry calculations and rst principles simulations for their relatively low computational costs, although GGA functionals could overdelocalize the electrons and protons in hydrogen bonded systems.56 However, calculations of the potential energy surfaces using the BLYP density functional57,58 and the D2 dispersion correction46 showed that the two density functionals closely match each other (ESI\u2020).\nFirst principle free energy landscapes\nThe free energy surfaces for transferring the proton in a hydrogen bond were computed for both AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations used different R and n axis. For a hydrogen bond between two acetic acids, R was dened as the O\u2013O distance and n as the difference between the two O\u2013H distances, n \u00bc dO1H dO2H, while for a hydrogen bond between acetic acid and 1- methylimidazole, R was the O\u2013N distance and n \u00bc dOH dNH. Here, a pair was considered hydrogen bonded if R # 3.5 A\u030a and the O\u2013H\u2013O or O\u2013H\u2013N angle is equal to or above 135 . The free energies were computed as F \u00bc kBT ln P(n, R), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the simulation temperature, and P(n, R) is the probability of observing a hydrogen bond with the hydrogen atom at n and the O\u2013O or O\u2013N distance at R."
