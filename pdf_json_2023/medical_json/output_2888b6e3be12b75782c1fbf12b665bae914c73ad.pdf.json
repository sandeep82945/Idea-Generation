    "abstractText": "Background Baylisascaris schroederi is the most common and harmful intestinal parasitic nematode of giant pandas, causing ascariasis. Although drug deworming is the main measure to control ascariasis in captive giant pandas, prolonged and repeated use of deworming drugs might induce resistance in nematodes and drug residues in giant pandas. Therefore, developing a safe and effective vaccine might provide a novel strategy to prevent ascariasis in captive giant pandas. Methods Four highly expressed secretome genes encoding excretory and secretory proteins of B. schroederi, including transthyretin-like protein 46 (BsTLP), uncharacterized protein (BsUP), hypothetical protein 1 (BsHP1), and hypothetical protein 2 (BsHP2) and four functional genes [(encoding Galectin (BsGAL), glutathione S-transferase (BsGST), fatty acid-binding protein (BsFABP), and thioredoxin peroxidase (BsTPX)] were identified based on genome and transcriptome databases of B. schroederi and used to construct recombinant proteins via prokaryotic expression. Kunming mice were vaccinated subcutaneously twice with the recombinant proteins (50 \u03bcg/mouse) mixed with Quil A adjuvant with a 2-week interval and then orally challenged with 3000 infective eggs. The immunoprotective effects of the eight recombinant proteins on mice were assessed comprehensively using surface lesion histology scores of the mouse liver and lung, larval worm reduction, serum antibody levels (IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a), and cytokine production [interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10]. Results Mice vaccinated with recombinant (r)BsUP (76.5%), rBsGAL (74.7%), and rBsHP2 (71.5%) showed a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in the larval worm rate compared with that in the adjuvant control. Besides, the surface lesions in the liver and lung of the vaccinated mice were alleviated. Serum levels of total IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, and cytokines, including IL-10, IL-5, and IFN-\u03b3, were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those in the control group. Conclusions The results showed that candidate three vaccines (rBsUP, rBsGAL, and rBsHP2) could provide effective protection against egg infection in mice associated with a mixed Th1/2-type immune response.",

Kunming mice were vaccinated subcutaneously twice with the recombinant proteins (50 \u03bcg/mouse) mixed with Quil A adjuvant with a 2-week interval and then orally challenged with 3000 infective eggs. The immunoprotective effects of the eight recombinant proteins on mice were assessed comprehensively using surface lesion histology scores of the mouse liver and lung, larval worm reduction, serum antibody levels (IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a), and cytokine production [interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10].\nResults Mice vaccinated with recombinant (r)BsUP (76.5%), rBsGAL (74.7%), and rBsHP2 (71.5%) showed a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in the larval worm rate compared with that in the adjuvant control. Besides, the surface lesions in the liver and lung of the vaccinated mice were alleviated. Serum levels of total IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, and cytokines, including IL-10, IL-5, and IFN-\u03b3, were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those in the control group.\nConclusions The results showed that candidate three vaccines (rBsUP, rBsGAL, and rBsHP2) could provide effective protection against egg infection in mice associated with a mixed Th1/2-type immune response.\nKeywords Recombinant proteins, Baylisascaris schroederi, Giant panda, Immunoprotective effect, Mouse model"

            "text": "The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a living fossil in the animal kingdom and is a world-famous rare animal. According to the 4th Giant Panda survey in China [1], the wild population comprises only 1864 giant pandas, and there were 699 captive giant pandas in 2022. Baylisascaris schroederi is the most common and harmful type of intestinal parasitic nematode in giant pandas *Correspondence: Guangyou Yang guangyou1963@126.com 1 Department of Parasitology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China\n[2], which can cause ascariasis, with symptoms of malnutrition, wasting, anemia, anorexia, and intestinal dysfunction. Larval migration can also lead to severe liver, lung, bile duct, and pancreatic lesions and\u00a0even\u00a0death of giant pandas [3]. This roundworm lays many eggs, which have strong viability in the environment, often causing repeated infection of hosts [4]. The infection rate of B. schroederi in wild pandas can be as high as 100%, and that of captive pandas can reach > 25% [5]. Anthelmintics (ivermectin, albendazole, and pyrantel pamoate) are the most important means of controlling ascariasis in captive giant pandas [6]; however, their repeated and long-term use can lead to nematode drug resistance [7]. Therefore, new methods have been sought urgently to prevent and control giant panda ascariasis, including developing an ascariasis vaccine. Following the infection of mice with infective eggs of\u00a0 B. schroederi, larvae hatched and penetrated the intestinal wall to migrate to the liver via the portal vein system. By day 7, the larvae left the intestine, and the second-stage larval counts peaked in the liver. Some larvae entered the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while only a few migrated to other organs such as the kidney and brain. By day 18, the larvae developed into third-stage larvae by the second molt in the liver. The third-stage larvae primarily parasitize the liver and can survive in the liver for over a year but not more than 2 months in the lungs [8]. B. schroederi differs from Toxocara canis and Baylisascaris procyonis because it does not accumulate in the muscles or nervous systems of mice and does not cause severe neurological diseases [9\u201311]. Similar to Ascaris suum, Ascaris lumbricoides, and T. canis infected-mouse models, B. schroederi could only develop into third-stage larvae in mice [12\u201315]. The mouse model has been proven to be an important and valid tool for screening candidate vaccines against B. schroederi. Four immunodominant antigens (Ag1, Ag2, Ag3, and PYP) were identified in the sera of B. schroederiinfected mice and induced partial immune protection in a mouse model by vaccination [13, 16\u201318]; however, no commercial vaccines are currently available.\nExcretory/secretory proteins (ESPs) are active molecules directly released by parasites into host body fluids and tissues, playing a pivotal role in parasite infection, parasitism, immune\u00a0 evasion, and host immune regulation [19]. ESPs can directly interact with the host immune system to trigger antigen\u2013antibody responses; therefore, ESPs have been regarded as a source of ideal candidate vaccines and immunodiagnostic antigens [20]. The advancement of omics technology has promoted the study of numerous parasites ESPs. These studies have demonstrated that ESPs possess the potential for protective immunity, which has accelerated the development of parasite vaccines [21]. Recently, 1639 secretome\ngenes were predicted and analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline based on the genome and transcriptome data of B. schroederi [22]. In the present study, four highly expressed secretome genes encoding ESPs [transthyretinlike protein 46 (BsTLP), uncharacterized protein (BsUP), hypothetical protein 1 (BsHP1), and hypothetical protein 2 (BsHP2)] and four functional genes [encoding galectin (BsGAL), glutathione S-transferase (BsGST), fatty acidbinding protein (BsFABP), and thioredoxin peroxidase (BsTPX)] showing the potential of early diagnosis and candidate vaccines of B. schroederi were selected and expressed via prokaryotic expression system [23\u201329]. The immunoprotective effects of the eight recombinant proteins in mice against infection by B. schroederi were evaluated by worm\u00a0burdens, liver and lung surface lesion histology scores, humoral immune response, and cellular immune response. Our study provides potential candidate vaccines to prevent and control panda ascariasis."

            "text": "Recombinant subunit vaccines are easy to produce, cheap, and low-side-effect vaccines that use DNA recombination technology to produce the protective antigen of pathogens. These types of vaccines are safe and are the most widely used vaccines in humans and animals [35]. To date, recombinant subunit vaccines\nhave been studied in nematodes, such as A. suum, T. canis, Necator americanus, Haemonchus contortus, and Trichinella spiralis, among which the recombinant vaccine against hookworm has entered the clinical trial stage [36]. Antigens with better immune protection effects have been screened from A. suum recombinant proteins, mainly including As16 [14], As24 [37], and As37, among which As37 might be a pan-worm candidate vaccine [38]. T. canis recombinant antigens rTcCad and rTcVcan reduced lung larvae by 54.3% and 53.9%, respectively, after immunization of mice [15], while rTcVcan formulated with Quil A adjuvant increased the protection rate of mice to 73% and also reduced 95% of the eggs in dog feces\nFig. 5 Results of specific antibody responses induced by B. schroederi antigens (rBsTPX, rBsGST, rBsFABP, rBsTLP, rBsHP2, rBsHP1, rBsGAL, and rBsUP) in mice. A\u2013H B. schroederi-specific IgG before primary immunization (Time 0) at 7 days after the primary immunization (Time 1), 7 days after the second immunization (Time 2), 7 days after challenge (Time 3), and 14 days after challenge (Time 4).

(Treatment with adjuvant only formed the control group; significance analysis: ns no significant difference, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001)\n(See figure on next page.)\n[39]. T. spiralis enzymes, such as TsAPP/TsCX and Ts-Adsp, can reduce adult worms by 63.9\u201371.1% and muscle larvae by 62.1\u201368.5% in mice after recombinant production and immunization [40, 41]. Vaccination with recombinant HcTTR and Hc32 for goats can result in the reduction of worm burdens [42, 43]. Canine hookworm recombinant antigens have been studied in different animal models [44], and immunization of animals with ASP [45], ASP-2 [46], GST [27], and CP-1 [47] reduced intestinal adult worm and fecal eggs counts. Phase 1 clinical trials of Ac-APR-1 and AcGST-1 have been carried out\u00a0 in Brazil, Africa, and the US [36, 48, 49]. A clinical trial of the combination of the two vaccines has been conducted in Gabon [50]. Therefore, the commercialization of the nematode recombinant subunit vaccine has good prospects.\nPrevious studies assessed the reduction rate of early larvae in the liver and lungs of mice at day 7 post-infection [18]. To comprehensively evaluate the protective effect of the vaccine against L3 larvae in the B. schroederi-infected mouse model, we chose day 20 post-infection to measure the reduction rate of L3 larvae and observe the pathological changes in the liver and lungs. This was based on the developmental time and main parasitic organs of the L3 larvae [8]. Previous studies showed that the candidate antigens of B. schroederi (PYP, Ag1, Ag2, and Ag3) displayed 62.9\u201371.2% protection after immunizing mice three times with Freund\u2019s adjuvant [13, 16\u201318]. By contrast, our antigens (HP2, HP1, GAL, and UP) formulated with Quil A provided and increased protection from 71.5% to 76.5% via a two-time injection in a mouse model. More importantly, we improved the protective effect of the vaccine and reduced the number of immunizations. Antigens combined with different adjuvants may cause different immune protection [38]. Totally, Quil A has been widely used in the veterinary field as a new-generation adjuvant with the characteristics of stimulating a long-lasting humoral and cellular immune response at low concentrations [39]. In this study, the Quil A mixed with recombinant antigen formulation could stimulate significant humoral and cellular immune responses. No side effects or allergies were observed in all mice during the experiment, consistent with our antigen allergy and toxicity prediction results. After screening the effective antigen, we will continue to investigate the cocktail vaccine for the screen of a better protective effect. To further verify the persistence and safety of the recombinant antigen with Quil A, the long-lasting\nantibody-level experiment of the vaccine and allergy study on guinea pigs will be conducted.\nParasite-secreted GST was involved in parasite survival, repair of host-induced damage, and modulation of host immunity [51] and showed better protective effects in T. spiralis [52], hookworms [48] and filarial worms [53]. In this study, the protective effect of GST was poor, which might be related to species differences. TPX, a member of the cysteine peroxidase-like family, protects worms from host reactive oxygen species [54]. Research on TPX candidate vaccines has been carried out in T. spiralis [29], filarial worms [55], and trematodes [56]. No protective effect was exhibited in the TPX group of B. schroederi, which might be related to the exposure of the epitope of TPX between species and interaction between antibodies. FABP plays a critical role in worm lipid transport, and is often used as a target to block lipid synthesis in parasites in vaccine research [57]. GAL is a lectin family member and participates in various key biological processes [58]. It can stimulate the host\u2019s immune response during parasite infection [59]. TLP belongs to the transthyretinlike family, is widely distributed in nematode excretion and secretion products, and has strong immunogenicity [60]. In this study, immunization with FABP, GAL, and TLP showed better protection, consistent with the good protective effect of FABP [28], GAL [26], and TLP [42] as candidate vaccine antigens in other parasites. Hypothetical proteins are conserved proteins that have been studied in parasites as candidate vaccines and drug targets [61, 62]. Excretory-secretory antigens have been validated as vaccine candidates in various nematodes [63]. At the same time, HP1, HP2, and UP are all highly expressed excreted/secreted antigens of unknown function [22], which are unique to B. schroederi and showed good protective effects in the mouse models. Some candidate antigens selected in this study have high sequence similarities with homologous antigens of other parasites but have shown differential protective effects in animal models [23\u201325]. Interestingly, we also found that the number of epitopes was not directly related to the protective effect of antigen. We speculated that the vaccine\u2019s protective effect might be associated with the conformation of the epitopes [64]. Therefore, the protective mechanisms and functions between different parasites are worthy of further study.\nIn this study, all antigens produced high levels of antigen-specific antibody IgG after immunization compared with that of the control group. Seven antigens (GST, FABP, TLP, HP2, HP1, GAL, and UP) induced a mixed antibody response after mouse immunization. Studies have shown that a mixed Th1/Th2 response might be\nmore conducive to protective immunity than a polarized response [37, 38, 65].\nIL-4 and IL-10 can regulate the damage caused by the Japanese roundworm larval migration when acting synergistically. IL-10 may participate in the control of inflammation, and IL-4 might promote tissue\u00a0repair and wound healing by mediating macrophage and eosinophil responses [66, 67]. In this study, the levels of IL-10 were significantly increased when mice were immunized with HP2, HP1, UP, GAL, and TLP. At the same time, IL-4 only displayed a significant response to the GAL antigen compared with the adjuvant group, although IL-4 in the HP2, HP1, UP, and TLP groups did not reach a significant level; however, the levels were still higher than those of the other antigens. The scores for the surface lesions of the liver and lungs of the mice vaccinated with five antigens were lower. Eosinophils are important to regulate worm infection [33]. IL-5 is regarded as a potent regulator of formation, differentiation, maturation, activation, recruitment, and survival of eosinophils [68] and induces B cell differentiation and antibody secretion. After infection by worms, IL-5 can enhance eosinophil activation and kill larvae at the site of infection by releasing toxic eosinophil granules [69]. Nematode vaccine studies have shown a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response characterized by high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5 [37, 38, 65]. In the present study, the difference in IL-5 production after vaccination with TPX was not significant, and it also did not show protection; the other antigens produced significant IL-5 and significantly reduced the burden of larvae. Therefore, IL-5 might be an important cytokine against helminth infection. None of the eight vaccine groups induced significant IL-2, similar to the conclusion that the A. suum vaccine candidate did not induce IL-2; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear [33]. There was no significant difference in IFN-\u03b3 levels induced by HP1 and FABP, but there were significant differences for other antigens. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages and induces the production of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which has toxic effects on parasite metabolic processes [70]. The reduction of parasites was related to a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, mainly characterized by high levels of specific antibodies (IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a) and significantly elevated cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, and IL-10)."

            "text": "Eight prokaryotically expressed recombinant proteins (rBsTPX, rBsGST, rBsFABP, rBsTLP, rBsHP2, rBsHP1, rBsGAL, and rBsUP) were used to immunize mice (50\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) twice, which were then challenged with B. schroederi eggs. The results showed that the worm reduction rates induced by rBsHP2, rBsGAL, and rBsUP were 71.5%, 74.7%, and 76.5%, respectively.\nMoreover, the numbers and severity of liver and lung surface lesions were significantly decreased. The reduction of parasites and changes in liver and lung tissue lesions are related to a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, as manifested by high levels of specific IgG, IgE, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a and marked upregulation of cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-5. The recombinant proteins rBsHP2, rBsGAL, and rBsUP might be potential candidate vaccines against B. schroederi infection. Simultaneously, our study can provide a reference for the next step to study the protective effect of the cocktail vaccine in the mouse model.\nAbbreviations Bs Baylisascaris schroederi TPX Thioredoxin peroxidase GST Glutathione S-transferase FABP Fatty acid-binding protein TLP Transthyretin-like protein 46 HP2 Hypothetical protein 2 HP1 Hypothetical protein 1 UP Uncharacterized protein GAL Galectin IgG Immunoglobulin G IgE Immunoglobulin E IgA Immunoglobulin A IFN-\u03b3 Interferon gamma IL Interleukin\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the staff at Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding for their helping to collect the samples of B. schroederi.
