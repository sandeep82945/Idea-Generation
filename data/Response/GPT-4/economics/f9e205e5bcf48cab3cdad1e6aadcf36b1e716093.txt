Exploring the Role of Gender and Social Relations in Farm Decision-Making Under Climate Change: Investigate how gender and social relations influence the decision-making processes of farmers, particularly in the context of adapting to climate change. This research could uncover social dynamics and barriers that affect adaptation strategies, potentially leading to more tailored and effective policy interventions.

Assessment of Different Governance Levels on Farm Adaptation Strategies: Analyze how different governance levels, from local to international, impact the adaptation strategies of farmers to climate change and extreme weather events. This study could identify gaps in policy coordination and opportunities for enhancing support mechanisms that facilitate more resilient agricultural practices.

Longitudinal Studies on the Psychological and Socio-economic Impacts of Learning and Adaptation in Farming Communities: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess how individual learning and adaptation to climate change over time affect the psychological well-being and socio-economic status of farmers and their communities. This research could provide insights into the long-term efficacy of adaptation measures and the mental health implications of increased workload due to adaptation efforts.

Comparative Analysis of Adaptation Strategies Across Different Agricultural Contexts and Climatic Zones: Compare the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies employed by farmers in different agricultural contexts and climatic zones, focusing on organic and extensive farming, technological adoption, and irrigation practices. This comparative analysis could highlight context-specific adaptation needs and opportunities for cross-learning between regions.

Developing and Testing Innovative Socio-technical Solutions for Reducing Workload and Enhancing Farm Resilience: Design and test new socio-technical solutions, such as collaborative farming models, smart agriculture technologies, and labor-sharing platforms, aimed at reducing the workload on farmers while increasing farm resilience to climate change. This research could lead to the development of practical tools and platforms that support sustainable and resilient agricultural practices.
