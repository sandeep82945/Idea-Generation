Longitudinal Studies on the Sustainability of EF Improvements: Conduct longer-term follow-up studies to assess the sustainability of executive function improvements in children with CP. Investigate whether the observed improvements in core EFs (inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility) persist beyond 9 months, and identify factors that contribute to sustained improvements or eventual declines.

Exploration of Higher-order EFs and Daily Life Applications: Develop and test interventions specifically designed to improve higher-order executive functions and the application of EF improvements in daily life scenarios for children with CP. This could involve integrating more real-life tasks, social interactions, and problem-solving activities within the intervention programs.

Dose-Response Relationship: Investigate the optimal dose and intensity of cognitive interventions for improving EFs in children with CP. Future studies could explore varying lengths and intensities of interventions to determine the most effective dosage for improving both core and higher-order EFs.

Comparative Effectiveness of Different Intervention Modalities: Compare the effectiveness of home-based computerized interventions with other intervention modalities, such as face-to-face therapy, group interventions, or hybrid models that combine various approaches. This research could also explore the benefits of integrating physical activity with cognitive interventions.

Personalization and Adaptation of Interventions: Research into personalized and adaptive intervention programs that tailor the difficulty level and types of tasks to the individual needs and progress of each child. Studies could also examine the impact of incorporating parents and caregivers more actively into the intervention process to enhance motivation, adherence, and outcomes.
