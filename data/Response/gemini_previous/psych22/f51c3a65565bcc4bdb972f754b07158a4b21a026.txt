1. **Investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the production of different SDBs in bonobos.** This could be done using neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI or EEG, to measure brain activity while bonobos are performing cognitive tasks or exposed to emotional stimuli. This would help to identify the specific brain regions that are involved in the production of different SDBs and to understand how these regions interact with each other.


2. **Examine the relationship between SDBs and other measures of emotional arousal in bonobos.** This could include physiological measures, such as heart rate and cortisol levels, as well as behavioral measures, such as facial expressions and body postures. This would help to determine whether SDBs are a reliable indicator of emotional arousal in bonobos and to identify the specific emotions that are associated with different SDBs.


3. **Investigate the effects of different environmental factors on the production of SDBs in bonobos.** This could include factors such as social context, physical environment, and diet. This would help to understand how the environment can influence the production of SDBs and to identify the factors that are most likely to trigger these behaviors.


4. **Compare the production of SDBs in bonobos to other closely related species, such as chimpanzees and gorillas.** This would help to identify the similarities and differences in the production of SDBs across species and to understand the evolutionary origins of these behaviors.


5. **Investigate the potential use of SDBs as a tool for assessing the welfare of bonobos in captivity.** This could involve developing a standardized protocol for observing and recording SDBs in bonobos and then using this protocol to assess the welfare of bonobos in different captive settings. This would help to identify the factors that are most likely to contribute to poor welfare in bonobos and to develop strategies for improving their welfare.
