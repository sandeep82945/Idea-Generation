    "abstractText": "Small for gestational age (SGA) is typically defined as birth weight< 10th percentile for age. Limited data are available regarding the growth of SGA preterm infants in relation to feeding type. We aimed to study SGA preterm infants fed fortified mother\u2019s own milk (MOM) or preterm formula (PF) on growth patterns and catch-up growth at discharge and 2-year corrected age (CA). Our retrospective cohort study included data from medical records and follow-up questionnaires about SGA preterm infants born at< 37 weeks fed on MOM (n 40) and PF (n 40). Weight, length/height and head circumference (HC)were collected at birth, discharge and at 2-year CA, and\u0394 z-scores were calculated. TheMOMgroup had significantly larger negative change in weight and length z-scores between birth and discharge, and smaller positive change in HC z-score (\u20130\u00b747 (SD 0\u00b741) v. \u22120\u00b725 (SD 0\u00b736), P= 0\u00b701; \u22120\u00b763 (SD 0\u00b775) v. \u22120\u00b727 (SD 0\u00b775), P= 0\u00b703; 0\u00b713 (SD 0\u00b767) v. 0\u00b741 (SD 0\u00b755), P= 0\u00b704, respectively). Almost half of theMOM-fed infants experienced poor length growth by discharge comparedwith 22 % of PF-fed infants (P= 0\u00b703). By 2-year CA, both groups had similar positive change inweight andHC z-scores, but MOM-fed infants had a slower increase in height z-score (0\u00b764 (SD 1\u00b730) v. 1\u00b733 (SD 1\u00b733), P= 0\u00b702), and only 40 % had achieved catch-up height compared with 68 % of the PF group (P= 0\u00b702). Our study indicates that fortified MOM-fed SGA preterm infants may need extra nutritional support in the first 2 years of life to achieve height growth potential.",

SGA is typically defined as birth weight< 10th percentile for age. Others define SGA as birth weight below the 3rd or 5th percentile, or less than \u20132 SD of expected birthweight for gestational age (GA)(2\u20134). Fetal growth restriction occurs due to several factors, including placental insufficiency, genetics, inadequate nutrition, deprived social-environmental states and maternal health issues(4). SGA preterm infants have a two to fourfold elevated risk of mortality compared with non-SGA preterm infants. Moreover, they are prone to multisystem complications, such as anaemia, respiratory failure, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus(4,5).\nNutrition plays an essential role in the first 1000 d of a preterm infant\u2019s life, with critical health consequences on growth, morbidity and cognitive development(4). Mother\u2019s ownmilk (MOM) is the\nfirst choice to feed preterm infants(4\u20136), the advantages include improved immune defence and gastrointestinal function, reduction in the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis, and improved long-term neurodevelopment outcomes compared to feeding with preterm formula (PF)(7,8). However, preterm infants\u2019 nutritional needs are beyond what is provided in human milk(9). Therefore, fortifying humanmilkwith a humanmilk fortifier is recommended for preterm infants with a birth weight< 1800 g(10). When MOM and donor milk are not available, the recommendation is to feed preterm infants with PF that supply has a higher nutrient density than standard infant formula. PF appear to match the nutritional needs of preterm infants, and they support good growth(11); however, limited data are available regarding growth patterns of SGA preterm infants.\nOur aim was to study growth patterns of SGA preterm infants fed fortified MOM or PF at two time points: discharge and 2-year corrected age (CA) follow-up.\n* Corresponding author: Ruth Birk, email ruthb@ariel.ac.il\nAbbreviations: CA, corrected age; GA, gestational age; HC, head circumference; KMC, Kaplan Medical Center; MOM, mother\u2019s own milk; PF, preterm formula; SGA, small for gestational age; VLBW, very low birth weight."

In addition, a follow-up telephone questionnaire was conducted with parents in 2020(average age of the children in 2020 was 4\u00b78 years). The questionnaire included standard questions that are also asked at the Israeli follow-up health clinics, such as information regarding duration of breast-feeding, type of formula and timing of introduction of complementary food.\nThis study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines, and all procedures involving human were approved by the KMC\u2019s Ethics Committee (0130-19-KMC).

Exclusion criteria included mixed feeding (MOM\u2264 80 % or PF\u2264 80 % of daily volume) (n 89), lack of matching (n 10), mortality (n 5), congenital malformations (n 4) and genetic syndrome (n 3). After applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, we included eighty SGA preterm infants and excluded 111 SGA preterm infants. Using MedCalc software, the sample size was calculated to be at least seventy SGA preterm infants, thirty-five in each groupwith 80 %power and a significance level of P-value< 0\u00b705 to detect 50 % difference between groups.\nFeeding type was defined based on standardised reporting of neonatal nutrition and growth (StRoNNG)(13). We divided the data into two groups: the MOM group included forty preterm infants primarily fed with MOM (volume of feeds> 80 %) and the PF group included forty preterm infants primarily fed with PF (volume of feeds> 80 %). Each preterm infant from the MOM group was matched to a preterm infant from the PF group. The criteria were birth week (SD1 week), birth weight (SD100 g) and birth year. Follow-up data, including anthropometric measures at 2-year CA and eligible questionnaires, were available for seventy-five infants (see flow chart in Fig. 1)."

All measurements were done with standardised equipment and techniques by professionals that were trained in measuring preterm infants and toddlers. Expected growth was defined as the change in z-score on the Fenton growth chart between \u22120\u00b78 and 0\u00b78 frombirth to discharge(15).We also classified poorweight growth andmalnutrition as a decline of> 0\u00b78 SD inweight-for-age z-scores, poor linear growth and malnutrition as a decline of > 0\u00b78 SD in length-for-age z-score and poor HC growth as a decline of> 1 SD in HC-for-age z-score(16\u201319). Rapid weight growth was defined as \u0394 z-score> 1 SD at discharge(20). Catchup growth in weight, height or HC at 2-year CA was defined as \u0394 z-score> 0\u00b767 SD(21,22). Weight gain velocity g/kg/day was calculated according to the equation: [(W2\u2212W1)/ ([(W2\u00feW1)/2]/1000)/number of days](23). Clinical and demographic data such as maternal age, deliverymode, maternal morbidities, ethnicity, intra-uterine growth restriction, day of full enteral feeding, postnatal weight loss, day of birth weight regain, days of hospitalisation and neonatal morbidities were also extracted from medical records."

However, previously published findings regarding non-SGA preterm infants, type of feeding and growth parameters at discharge are partially consistent with our results. A small prospective observational study (n 32) on fortified MOM-fed non-SGA very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants found a significant decrease in weight z-score from birth to discharge compared with PF-fed non-SGA VLBW preterm infants. No differences were detected between the groups for \u0394 length or \u0394 HC z-scores(28). Similarly, fortified-MOM or donor milk-fed nonSGA VLBW preterm infants (n 462, GA\u2264 32 week) were found to have significant reduction in weight z-score from birth to discharge compared with PF-fed preterm infants. Length and HC were not examined(29). Contrary to these studies, a retrospective cohort study (n 466, GA< 37 weeks, birth weight< 2200 g) showed that low birth weight preterm infants fed with fortified breast milk (MOM and donor milk) had a higher weight z-score and lower decrease in HC z-score at discharge compared with PF-fed infants. No differences in weight z-scores were found in VLBW preterm infants fed the different feeding types(30). The differences in z-scores outcomes between the studies could be due to several reasons, including studied populations (nonSGA, VLBW preterm infants), differences in the breast milk type (MOM or donor) and the amount of breast milk (exclusive or any). Our research demonstrates that SGA preterm infants have a unique growth pattern that is affected by feeding type, and expressed by length and not only by weight and HC.\nWe demonstrated that feeding SGA preterm infants from birth with MOM was associated with poorer length growth at discharge compared with PF feeding. Length is an important indicator of both nutritional adequacy and normal growth. Linear growth is dependent on fat-free mass accretion and adequate protein and micronutrient intake(31,32). Weight measurement alone without length measurements can lead to mis-identification of weight gain or loss, highlighted by previous feedings on preterm infants at term which exhibit less lean and similar fat mass at discharge compared with term infants(32). Furthermore, length was also been associated with brain development and neurodevelopmental outcome(33,34). Recently, expert neonatal dietitians panel recommended using \u2018decline\nin length z-score\u2019 as one of the indicators for identifying neonatal malnutrition or delayed growth in preterm infants(16). Accordingly to this, our study findings showing poorer length growth at discharge of SGA preterm infants fed MOM compared with PF along may indicate signs of malnutrition that could require further enrichment of MOM during hospitalisation, although this could pose a challenge due to the current nutritional protocol. Alternatively, length should be monitored routinely, however should not be a major indicator to malnutrition in this special group of SGA preterm infants and warrant more research.\nAt 2-year CA, both groups exhibited similar increases in weight and HC z-scores. However, the change in height z-score was different between the two groups, possibly suggesting that the improvement in weight and HC growth of the MOM-fed group was at the expense of height growth. This indicates possible prolonged effects of feeding type on height growth potential. Similarly, Toftlund et al. reported in a small sub-cohort that PF-fed SGApreterm infants exhibit rapid growth, whereasMOMfed (with or without fortifier) SGA preterm infants experienced an increase in weight and height over a longer period of time(20). A recent large observational study on SGA and non-SGA VLBW preterm infants demonstrated slower growth in\u0394weight andHC z-scores at discharge among MOM fed compared with PF fed. However, these differences were not observed at age 10(35). Also, in non-SGA preterm infants, an observational cohort study on two large cohorts (LIFT and EPIPAGE) showed greater loss in weight z-score at discharge in MOM-fed preterm infants compared with PF-fed preterm infants. However, at 2-year CA, weight, height and HC z-scores were significantly higher in MOM fed compared with PF fed(36). The EPIPAGE study also found that breast-feeding at discharge was associated with a lower incidence of short stature at 5 years of age(37). Taken together, although there are differences in methodology between the various studies, it can be concluded that MOMfed SGA preterm infants achieve weight, HC and height goals over longer period than FP-fed SGA preterm infants. However, the question related to the time frame taken to achieve this catch-up is still not entirely clear and depends on feeding type and birth status.\nIn our study, at 2-year CA the height difference still remained, whereas the PF group exhibited significant linear catch-up growth compared with the MOM group. Poor catch-up growth is affected by prematurity, SGA status, genetics and nutrition and is associated with low IQ and short stature(38). Possible explanation for the difference in height catch-up growth is the amount of protein in the diet. It has been reported that protein content in humanmilk decreases throughout lactation and varies between mothers(39,40). Also, human milk contains less protein compared with formula and might contribute to slower growth rate(40). According to the \u2018early protein hypothesis\u2019, the higher protein content in infant formula compared with human milk could stimulate the production of Insulin growth factor (IGF)-I and insulin which promotes growth(41). In later infancy (\u223c 9 months of age), term infants who were still breastfed showed lower levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and insulin than infants no longer breastfed(42,43). Nevertheless, it is important to mention that MOM is the gold standard for feeding preterm infants.\nWeight catch-up growth 27 69 31 86 0\u00b71 \u0394 weight z-score> 0\u00b767 SD Height catch-up growth 15 40 24 68 0\u00b702* \u0394 height z-score> 0\u00b767 SD HC catch-up growth 17 43 25 71 0\u00b705* \u0394 HC z-score> 0\u00b767 SD\nMOM, mother\u2019s own milk; PF, preterm formula; HC, head circumference.

Studies have shown that poor HC growth in SGA preterm infants may lead to neurodevelopmental impairments outcome(44,45). Although the increase was slower in MOM group, still 98 % of the SGA preterm infants in the study were in the normal range, which may predict positive neurodevelopmental outcomes.\nAt 2-year CA, the increase in HC z-score was similar in both groups, with PF-fed group showing non-significant trend to higher rate of HC z-score catch-up. Thus, feeding type probably has no effect on HC growth at 2-year CA.\nRegarding the nutritional gastrointestinal feeding acceptability, during hospitalisation, significantly less episodes of regurgitation were observed in the MOM group than in the PF group, presumably due to the unique MOM composition which includes digestive enzymes, growth factors, hormones and prebiotic factors which benefit the immature gastrointestinal functions(46). Even though there were more episodes of regurgitation among the PF group, our findings indicate that it did not affect their growth compared with the MOM group.\nOur study has several limitations: the feeding information during hospitalisation and post-discharge until the age of 3 months was controlled and thus is detailed and extensive. However, other un-recognised nutritional factors in the feeding post-discharge could have influenced growth. Additionally, parents have fulfilled the questionnaires several years after discharge. Our study has several advantages: we studied a unique population that is hardly investigated, the study population data were fully documented and we studied all the anthropometric parameters. Also, KMC\u2019s NICU follows a standardised and controlled feeding protocol with the same medical staff and dietitian over the years which reduce bias.\nIn summary, our study points to a link between the feeding type and the rate of linear catch-up growth at discharge and at 2- year CA. SGA preterm infants warrant special attention and closer monitoring of their nutrition before and after discharge to support growth, particularly in MOM-fed infants. Furthermore, supporting earlier birth weight regain should be the focus. This might assist in increasing the height z-score at 2-year CA in MOM-fed SGA preterm infants. Further research is needed to determine the best approach to fortify MOM or to set specific standards to this population in order to achieve optimal growth of SGA preterm infants during the NICU period and at post-discharge period."

            "text": "The early growth of the SGA preterm infants is regulated by complex interplay between genetic, environmental, nutritional and endocrine factors, coupled with therapeutic interventions. Our\nfindings indicate that feeding type in SGA preterm infants has an effect on growth in all anthropometric parameters at discharge, whereas at 2-year CA the effect remains only on height growth. Feeding with fortified MOM during hospitalisation compared with PF leads to significant larger decrease in weight and length z-scores and smaller increase in HC z-score at discharge. Feeding SGA preterm infants with unfortified MOM for at least 3 months post-discharge is associated with slower increase in height z-score and delayed height catch-up growth at 2-year CA, suggesting possible prolonged effects on growth potential influenced by feeding type.\nDue to differences found in this study, close nutritional monitoring of SGA preterm infants beyond the age of 2 years is warranted."
