    "abstractText": "Being mentally tough while evaluating oneself in a compassionate way is still a difficult path for performers. Self-compassion, characterized by the ability to be kind to oneself, to see one\u2019s experiences as part of the larger human experience and have a balanced awareness to one\u2019s emotions and thoughts, was recently studied as a stepping stone to performance optimization and personal development. Despite a mistrust of this concept in the sports world, various studies show its benefits within athletes. A major question remains the environment that fosters or hinders the development of self-compassion: when role models extend compassionate attitudes, does it allow performers to respond in more self-compassionate ways? The relationship between self-compassion, mental toughness, and social environment is still unclear and is an important direction for future research within performers. This semi-systematic literature review aims at proposing an overview of the state of the art regarding self-compassion, mental toughness, and the influence of performer\u2019s, and social environments. Sixteen studies were retrieved. We conclude that the number of multi-day intervention programs and longitudinal studies should be increased. The studies should also consider assessing the specific aspects of performance culture and settings. In addition, overall performance-specific measures could be developed to assess general levels of self-compassion. The development of a theoretical framework explaining how self-compassion affects a performer, the role of their entourage and its link to other psychological resources, such as mental toughness, could help to better understand this concept.",

Self-compassion, characterized by the ability to be\u00a0kind to oneself, to see one\u2019s experiences as part of the larger human experience and have a balanced awareness to one\u2019s emotions and thoughts, was recently studied as a stepping stone to performance optimization and personal development. Despite a mistrust of this concept in the sports world, various studies show its benefits within athletes. A major question remains the environment that fosters or hinders the development of self-compassion: when role models extend compassionate attitudes, does it allow performers to respond in more self-compassionate ways? The relationship between self-compassion, mental toughness, and social environment is still unclear and is an important direction for future research within performers. This semi-systematic literature review aims at proposing an overview of the state of the art regarding self-compassion, mental toughness, and the influence of performer\u2019s, and social environments. Sixteen studies were retrieved. We\u00a0conclude that the number of multi-day intervention programs and longitudinal studies should be\u00a0increased. The studies should also consider assessing the specific aspects of performance culture and settings. In addition, overall performance-specific measures could be\u00a0developed to assess general levels of self-compassion. The development of a theoretical framework explaining how self-compassion affects a performer, the role of their entourage and its link to other psychological resources, such as mental toughness, could help to better understand this concept.\nKeywords: self-compassion, mental toughness, social environment, performing arts, sport\nINTRODUCTION\nPerformance, in different manner, is often at the heart of our daily activities, whether at work (e.g., Van Daalen et\u00a0 al., 2009) or in our personal lives (e.g., DeGroot and Vik, 2021). It is even more present in the domains of sport and performing arts. Promoting athletes\u2019 and, more broadly, performers\u2019 (i.e., artists, musicians, dancers) mental health is a significant\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887099\narea of scientific research in sport and performance sciences to enable high-performance over time (Donohue et\u00a0al., 2018; Van Slingerland et\u00a0al., 2019). How can athletes and performers be\u00a0accompanied in developing their mental health and personal resources to cope with this challenging world and maintain high-performance level? What key approaches could help to nurture successful, resilient performers and consider their mental health and well-being?\nAthletes must often, if not constantly, give their best and do their utmost to achieve high performances. Physical preparation, practicing their sporting skills, nutritional follow-up, and the planning and management of their training sessions are all frequently put forward as essential elements in their struggles to achieve great things (Baker et\u00a0 al., 2003; Macquet and Skalej, 2015). Over the last few decades, but especially in the last 10 years, mental training and sport psychology have become integral parts of an athlete\u2019s preparation and support. Mental training and sport psychology aim to prepare athletes to handle the stress, pressure, and emotions they are confronted to. It helps them learn about themselves to better cope with challenges (Ong and Harwood, 2018).\nThe mental toughness of high-level performers is often put forward when discussing their performances (Bauman, 2016; Gucciardi and Hanton, 2016; Morais and Gomes, 2019). Athletes or their relatives frequently turn to sports psychologists or mental trainers with the request to become mentally tough or develop this toughness (Gee et\u00a0 al., 2010). Indeed, mental toughness is often considered an essential personal characteristic of top performers, consisting of aspects of psychological individuality including positive cues resulting from personal resources (e.g., self-efficacy, optimism) (Gucciardi et\u00a0 al., 2017). However, mental toughness is often followed by harmful beliefs. High-performance environments foster conditions in which a performer\u2019s personal resources, such as those encompassed by mental toughness (e.g., overcoming obstacles, perseverance), become so highly valued that athletes may be\u00a0 less likely or willing to seek help for mental health issues (Gucciardi et\u00a0 al., 2017). Furthermore, athletes\u2019 mental toughness is influenced by their social environment and surroundings (Antonini Philippe et\u00a0 al., 2016; Bean et\u00a0 al., 2019). Research has investigated the mechanisms linking elements of coach-created environments to certain positive and negative indicators of athletes\u2019 wellbeing and mental toughness (Gagne, 2003; Reinboth and Duda, 2004). Similarly, weak social support appears to be\u00a0a significant risk factor in overall mental health (Rice et\u00a0 al., 2016).\nAlso, to perform at their best, performers not only have to remain mentally strong, but they need to understand the mistakes and difficulties they encounter to find solutions to move forward. Sport psychology research, to cope with difficulties, was interested, for example, in the concepts of resilience (e.g., Sorkkila et\u00a0 al., 2019), grit (e.g., Newland et\u00a0 al., 2020) or, more recently, self-compassion (Doorley et\u00a0al., 2022). Self-compassion was showed to have significant impact on athletes\u2019 motivation and capacity to bounce back after difficult times (e.g., injuries, failure). However, research in this field is relatively new; therefore, we\u00a0 still have to understand what influences and helps develop self-compassionate competencies.\nThrough a semi-systematic review, defined as a review methodology for \u201ctopics that have been conceptualized differently and studied by various groups of researchers within diverse disciplines [\u2026] and useful for detecting themes, or common issues within a specific research discipline\u201d (Snyder, 2019), this article will investigate the concepts of mental toughness, selfcompassion within performers and the links with their social environment. Mental toughness and self-compassion are also being studied in the world of performing arts and, as proven by some authors, bridges can be\u00a0 built between the world of sport, performing arts, music, and dance (Pecen et\u00a0 al., 2018). Therefore, the word performers, in this article, includes athletes, musicians and dancers.\nMental Toughness, Self-Compassion, and the Social Environment: A Winning Combination for Performers\u2019 Well-Being and Performances Experiences of failure, leading to emotional distress, which are inherent to high-performance fields, can be\u00a0 detrimental to performers\u2019 future performances and mental health. As previously mentioned, high-performance activities are often symbolized by courage, grit, and mental toughness (Baltzell et\u00a0al., 2020). However, this mental toughness can have detrimental elements (Gucciardi et\u00a0 al., 2017). One emerging concept being studied and highlighted as a counterbalance and complement to mental toughness is self-compassion (Baltzell et\u00a0 al., 2020). Self-compassion, or treating oneself with kindness (Neff, 2003a), \u201ccan help performers deal with failure and can serve as a buffer against negative emotional psychological reactions\u201d (Ceccarelli et\u00a0 al., 2019, p.\u00a0 1). Neff examined the positive psychological functions of self-compassion and reported that self-compassionate individuals were more likely to think positively, have greater self-awareness, and make accurate selfappraisals (Neff et\u00a0 al., 2007; Neff, 2009; Neff and Germer, 2013). Self-compassion is defined by a supportive attitude toward oneself and includes being kind to oneself, common humanity, and mindfulness (Neff, 2003b). Common humanity is defined as seeing one\u2019s experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separate and isolating (Baltzell, 2016). Mindfulness corresponds to the ability to take a step back from our overarching emotions and thoughts and \u2018be in the moment.\u2019 Researchers working in the field of sport psychology have begun to address this concept with athletes (Ferguson et\u00a0 al., 2015; Mosewich et\u00a0 al., 2019), finding links between self-compassion and performance-related factors. Athletes with relatively high levels of self-compassion perform better and cope more effectively with sport stressors (Baltzell, 2016). Athletes with higher levels of self-compassion have also been shown to be\u00a0 relatively more positive, more persistent, less ruminative, and more willing to take responsibility (Ferguson et\u00a0 al., 2015). Finally, they also seem to have relatively greater experience in self-discipline along with less body shame (and thus less body monitoring), less fear of failure, less fear of negative evaluations, and less social physical anxiety (Mosewich et\u00a0 al., 2011; Baltzell, 2016). However, some athletes have\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887099\nassumptions about self-compassion, such as that if they were more compassionate with themselves, they would lose their intrinsic motivation and feel sorry for themselves (Baltzell et\u00a0 al., 2020). When athletes are more compassionate with themselves, it is easier for them to \u2018tolerate\u2019 the (primarily negative) emotions they go through when faced with undesirable experiences in their sport (Reis et\u00a0 al., 2015). More research into this concept is therefore essential as it has enormous potential in improving well-being and performance. Furthermore, it is interesting to look at performers in a broader sense (including dancers and musicians) because self-compassion among these populations has received little attention to date (Tarasoff et\u00a0 al., 2017; Kveton-Bohnert, 2018; Johnson, 2020).\nMoreover, in the last 20 years, different authors have been interested in how a performer\u2019s social environment can affect their performances and well-being (Jowett and Poczwardowski, 2007; Antonini Philippe et\u00a0 al., 2011; Wachsmuth et\u00a0 al., 2020). When talking about the social environment\u2019s influence, we\u00a0 assume the way performers perceive and appraise their environment, interactions and conditions often conveyed by coaches through the creation of a certain type of environment (e.g., autonomy supportive, compassionate). Studies have revealed that developing caring environment and compassion for self and others have a range of benefits on psychological processes (Neff, 2011; Jazaieri et\u00a0 al., 2013; Keltner et\u00a0 al., 2014) and social relationships (Penner et\u00a0al., 2004; Crocker and Canevello, 2012; Neff and Beretvas, 2013; Neff and Pommier, 2013). Research in sport psychology has highlighted that when role models show an accepting attitude toward performers, regardless of outcomes, these positive interactions also encourage athletes to respond in more self-accepting ways (Ingstrup et\u00a0al., 2017). A coach or a parent\u2019s attitude can maximize a performer\u2019s potential in terms of performance as well as toward their personal and psychological development (self-esteem, selfconfidence, motivation). According to the study by Pecen et\u00a0al. (2018), performers, among their many challenges, may also face difficulties from within their social environment, such as a bad or abusive coach, manipulative parents, dangerous advice, sexual harassment, or abuses of power and positions of influence. Coaches and parents are instrumental in creating social environments that can influence an athlete\u2019s physical growth and, psychological and subjective well-being (Jowett and Cockerill, 2003; Blanchard et\u00a0 al., 2009; Bartholomew et\u00a0 al., 2011)."

            "text": "Previous literature reviews have focused on the concept of self-compassion within sport or physical activity in general. R\u00f6thlin et\u00a0 al. (2019) did a scoping review of the published evidence on self-compassion research in competitive sport. They answered the question about whether self-compassion is beneficial to competitive athletes. They were interested in the methodologies used in self-compassion studies. Overall, the review highlighted self-compassion\u2019s benefits and revealed how\nit influenced well-being, reduced feelings of shame and selfcriticism, and improved the ability to deal with failures. However, few of these studies investigated personal and social variables. Some highlighted that when athletes have the impression that they are supported socially (e.g., by teammates), self-compassion tends to increase. It seems that social and personal variables can be\u00a0either the antecedents or consequences of self-compassion. Also, a gap underlined in that scoping review were that studies rarely analyzed real-time reactions to failure and stress.\nAnother literature review on self-compassion and physical activity was conducted by Wong et\u00a0 al. (2021), focusing on self-care and differing from R\u00f6thlin et\u00a0 al.\u2019s (2019) study in that it looked at the general population rather than highlevel performers. The authors highlighted that self-compassion was a trait allowing a positive and healthy self-care engagement. Self-compassionate individuals were more likely to practice positive thinking, possessed greater self-awareness, and made more accurate self-appraisals. Self-compassion can also be\u00a0 a coping strategy when facing a failure to transform negative or neutral emotions into more positive ones. The authors stated that participating in physical activities was a way to release negative psychological symptoms and improve mental health. Self-compassion seems to enhance people\u2019s physical health and health-related behaviors. Wong et\u00a0 al. (2021) wanted to study the relationship between physical activity and self-compassion. Their main question was: how does physical activity relate to self-compassion? The results\u2019 studies highlighted that self-compassion was associated with selfregulation and thus much likely to process goal settings, behavior evaluation and action-taking. This regulatory behavior, found among highly compassionate people, also applies to evaluations of physical health conditions and yet leading to physical activity-related acts and hence leading to a stronger intrinsic motivation in physical activity engagement (Magnus et\u00a0 al., 2010; Cox et\u00a0 al., 2019), as well as exercise re-engagement after exercise failure or exercise setbacks (Semenchuk et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nThe present semi-systematic review focuses on the impact and influences between social environments and the psychological competencies of self-compassion and mental toughness within performance settings (sport, music, and dance). It aims to demonstrate the degrees of association and causality between self-compassion, mental toughness, and the social environment within a context of high performance (sport and performing arts)."

            "text": "Can mental toughness and inner kindness toward oneself work together to support mental health and performance? Despite differences, it seems that mental toughness and self-compassion share many commonalities (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2019; Johnson, 2020; Stamatis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021). To the best of our knowledge, Wilson et\u00a0al. (2019) were the first to explore the compatibility of these two concepts with regards to athletic performance.\nTheir results suggested that mental toughness and selfcompassion were indeed compatible, complementary concepts (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2019; Johnson, 2020; Stamatis et\u00a0al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021). Self-compassion helped performers cope with difficult situations, whereas mental toughness seemed to be\u00a0helpful in maintaining high motivation, concentration, and resilience (Wilson et\u00a0 al., 2019; Stamatis et\u00a0 al., 2020). Wilson et\u00a0 al. (2019) suggested that if a person cannot move on after facing adversity, they may not be\u00a0able to maintain an attitude of mental toughness. Therefore self-compassion is crucial to performers.\nThe participants in the studies investigating these two concepts were mainly women (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2019; Stamatis et\u00a0al., 2020). Both quantitative (Stamatis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021) and qualitative (Wilson et\u00a0 al., 2019) methods were used to investigate the relationship between self-compassion and mental toughness. Researchers (Wilson et\u00a0 al., 2019; Johnson, 2020; Stamatis et\u00a0al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021) emphasized the importance of working on and developing mental toughness and self-compassion to equip performers to face the challenges they will encounter while allowing them to take care of their mental health. In some athletes, a high level of mental toughness but a low level of self-compassion can lead to difficulties in controlling their emotions in difficult moments (Maranan and Lopez, 2021). Self-compassion can then be\u00a0 useful, filling these gaps by helping these performers to develop an open, understanding attitude toward themselves. Researchers have also looked at parallel concepts such as athletic identity or communication (Maranan and Lopez, 2021).\nAccording to the participants in Wilson et al.\u2019s (2019) study, on the one hand, mental toughness was expressed through perseverance (the capacity to continue despite the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887099\ndifficulties encountered), presence (the capacity to re-focus on what one is doing), perspective-taking and the capacity to prepare oneself for a demanding situation (e.g., competition). On the other hand, despite a lack of understanding of the concept, self-compassion would allow one to develop personal coping resources by feeling that one was not alone and that others sometimes experienced similar situations (i.e., common humanity). In addition, mindfulness\u2014an important aspect of self-compassion\u2014 allows performers to keep their attention on the present moment and avoid being caught up in thoughts and emotions (Johnson, 2020; Stamatis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021). Finally, self-compassion was mainly used through positive internal discourse.\nSelf-compassion seems to help performers develop their mental toughness by allowing them to develop an understanding of what is happening to them, re-evaluate the situation, and then move on (Wilson et\u00a0 al., 2019; Stamatis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021). Some participants also perceived self-compassion as necessary because without it, performers could not be\u00a0self-aware, supportive, and compassionate enough (with themselves) to deal with the difficult emotions they faced. Self-compassion protected them from the potential pitfalls of a sporting culture of mental toughness that encouraged resilience but emotional avoidance (Johnson, 2020). Self-compassion may lead to mental toughness by developing a better understanding of self-regulation strategies, for example, and thereby help become mentally tough. Moreover, acceptance of injury-related physical limitations (e.g., reduced training intensity and duration) was also important, as it contributed to greater self-awareness.

However, there remains a lack of clear guidelines on how athletes, coaches, or parents can proceed to accompany or develop these psychological skills in practice.

For example, mental toughness components\u2019 might be\u00a0 useful during competition and self-compassion afterward. The way these psychological processes (e.g., self-compassion, goal setting, perseverance) should be\u00a0 used seems to vary depending on the situation (e.g., during competition, afterward) and the performer itself (e.g., personal characteristics, or need at one specific moment).

Ballet training should incorporate strategies to build resilience, mindfulness, and self-compassion, which would help dancers develop a healthy inner voice and a growth mindset to sustain them throughout their training and careers. This included fostering self-agency, autonomy, optimism, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose and meaning, self-acceptance, and positive relations with others. Ways to enhance ballet training to promote intrinsic satisfaction and resilience using mindful learning and a growth mindset were discussed through the lens of positive and humanistic psychology. The goal was to improve dancers\u2019 training to forestall unnecessary suffering and enhance well-being and wholeness. 7. Crozier et\u00a0al. (2019) Aims: Explore the relationship between athletes\u2019 selfcompassion and their teammates\u2019 perceived selfcompassion. Results: Athletes\u2019 self-compassion was related to their perceptions of how often their teammates were selfcompassionate. Coaches and sport psychologists should encourage athletes to build awareness about how their cognition and behavior relate to others\u2019 cognitions and behaviors. 8. Hilliard et\u00a0al. (2019) Aims: Examine the moderating role of self-compassion on the relationship between public stigma and self-stigma, and how self-stigma was associated with attitudes toward seeking counseling. Results: Self-compassion was not found to moderate the relationship between public stigma and self-stigma. However, public stigma was positively associated with selfstigma, and self-stigma was negatively associated with attitudes toward counseling. A multigroup analysis found no differences between males and females in this model. The study\u2019s results had implications for professionals working with college-student athletes, suggesting that efforts should aim to reduce stigma and examine alternative factors that might improve attitudes toward seeking help with mental health. 13.

A performer\u2019s social environment is often created by their coach as well as by their peers and parents (Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020). The coach appears to have a crucial role to play in the development of skill of self-compassion (Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020). Fontana et\u00a0al. (2017) highlighted the link between perceptions that an environment was caring and the level compassion one\nmight feel for peers, teammates, or a coach. For others, compassion seems to be\u00a0 influenced by a caring environment (Fontana et\u00a0 al., 2017; Crozier et\u00a0al., 2019). Some researchers have also highlighted the negative correlation between ego-centric environments and how forgiving one might be\u00a0toward teammates who make mistakes or failure (Fontana et\u00a0 al., 2017). In contrast, the link between self-compassion and a caring atmosphere is not as clear (Fontana et\u00a0 al., 2017; Hilliard et\u00a0 al., 2019). Some studies have highlighted the need to develop a self-compassion tool specific to the world of performers because, to date, Neff\u2019s (2003b) scale to detect self-compassion in the general population might be\u00a0 interpreted by them as self-pity, depending on the items (Fontana et\u00a0al., 2017).\nSome studies have focused on implementing intervention programs to help coaches and/or performers develop skills in mindfulness and self-compassion (Baltzell et\u00a0al., 2015; Scott et\u00a0al., 2021). Data have highlighted that these different types of themes could have impacts on coaches: increased sensitivity to their athletes\u2019 feelings, increased knowledge and awareness of their own feelings, and improved coach\u2013athlete relationships (Baltzell et\u00a0 al., 2015; Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020), as well as increased skills in self-compassion and well-being (Scott et\u00a0al., 2021). Athletes appear to be\u00a0 more effective at recovering emotionally after a difficult situation and feel more care and warmth for themselves and their peers. Creating compassionate environments seems to enable athletes to create better adaptation mechanisms (Scott et\u00a0al., 2021).\nTABLE\u00a02 | Continued\nReferences* Research question 1. What associations can be\u00a0made between mental toughness and self-compassion?\nResearch question 2. What kind of influence do social environments have on the development of selfcompassion?\n14. Scott et\u00a0al. (2021) Aims: Consider how Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) TripleImpact Competitor (TIC) workshops could be\u00a0used to help create positive climates for recreational sport club athletes, and examine how perceptions of a positive team climate related to indices of psychological well-being among sport club athletes. Results: Athletes\u2019 perceptions of a caring and task-oriented climate were significantly and positively related to their hope, happiness, and self-kindness. Results suggested that the PCA TIC training was an inexpensive strategy that could foster positive environments within university sport club teams and assist in programs promoting indices of psychological well-being among club sport athletes. 15. Diehl (2021) Aims: Explore how college-student athletes experience and cope with shame-inducing events in their sport and understand the impact of various intrapersonal (selfcompassion) and interpersonal (team climate) factors as potential resources or barriers to shame resilience for US college-student athletes. Results: (1) Sport-based shame may negatively impact sport competence and experience; (2) the internalization of the performance ethic (i.e., worth based on outcome success) may lead to sport-based shame; and (3) self-compassion may represent an intrapersonal shame-coping strategy for sport-based shame. In addition, one qualitative-dominant divergent finding revealed that interpersonal support (empathic accuracy, situational feedback, and task/mastery team climates) might lead to intrapersonal shame resilience for college-student athletes.\n*The numbers in front of the references correspond to the numbers in Table\u00a01.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887099\nStudies looking at self-compassion or its development through the creation of a compassionate environment have mainly focused on performers\u2019 perspectives (Fontana et\u00a0 al., 2017). Coaches, as well as the performers circle of acquaintances (e.g., parents, peers), have been studied less (Baltzell et\u00a0al., 2015; Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020) and it would be\u00a0interesting to investigate coaches\u2019 influence and ability to develop compassionate environments for performers\u2019 performance and well-being. Social support and the creation of supportive and compassionate environments do, however, appear to effect self-compassion (Graham-Williams, 2013; Jeon et\u00a0 al., 2016), despite the mixed results revealed by Fontana et\u00a0 al. (2017). Social support and the creation of supportive environments can improve a performer\u2019s coping skills and contribute to more positive emotions and greater perceived self-worth (Graham-Williams, 2013; Jeon et\u00a0 al., 2016; Crozier et\u00a0al., 2019; Frentz et\u00a0al., 2020; Diehl, 2021). Individuals\u2019 attitudes toward themselves are influenced by the evaluations of significant others.\nStudies with athletes show that the feeling of social support (Jeon et\u00a0 al., 2016) or perceiving teammates to be\u00a0 highly selfcompassionate (Crozier et\u00a0al., 2019) increases well-being. Other situational features, such as the motivational atmosphere, are not correlated with self-compassion (Fontana et\u00a0al., 2017). Thus, studies investigating self-compassion should consider these aspects to be\u00a0 potential moderators (e.g., whether athletes in teams demonstrating little self-compassion, great concerns about perfectionism, or low levels of social support would benefit markedly from greater self-compassion)."

            "text": "To date, some research on self-compassion has been done among dancers (Graham-Williams, 2013; Ingstrup et\u00a0 al., 2017; Tarasoff et\u00a0 al., 2017; Kveton-Bohnert, 2018). However, to the best of our knowledge, only one study focusing on selfcompassion has been carried out in the music field (Kelley and Farley, 2019). It is, therefore, important to consider these few studies considering broader research in the field of performance psychology. These performers face many challenges\u2014as do athletes\u2014that need to be\u00a0 overcome and learning environments are likely to be\u00a0 a key location where performers can be\u00a0equipped with skills such as self-compassion and mental toughness.\nResearch in the field of the performing arts has focused primarily on dance, highlighting the deleterious role that their working environments sometimes have on dancers\u2019 well-being and level of self-compassion (Graham-Williams, 2013; Tarasoff et\u00a0 al., 2017). Researchers point out that the environments in which dancers practice and perform subject them to a form of constant evaluation that is not conducive to looking at oneself with compassion and kindness, leading to detrimental effects on one\u2019s self-image (Kveton-Bohnert, 2018). Researchers have provided evidence that a musician or dancer\u2019s level of selfcompassion can be\u00a0 improved using therapeutic means that can lead to better mental health outcomes (Tarasoff et\u00a0 al., 2017; Kveton-Bohnert, 2018; Kelley and Farley, 2019). The results of these studies were like those exploring self-esteem in the performing\narts or self-compassion among athletes. Graham-Williams (2013) looked at dance education methods and their influence on dancers\u2019 levels of self-compassion. The results were not significant but teaching with a focus on compassion and caring nevertheless seemed to have beneficial effects on those performers\u2019 well-being.\nThe field of performing arts is still under-researched. It would seem important, when studying self-compassion and mental toughness, to include musicians, dancers, and performers to create a bridge between the worlds of sport and the performance arts, which are not so different from each other in many respects."

            "text": "This semi-systematic literature review examined the relationships between self-compassion, mental toughness, and the influence of social environments on performers (athletes, dancers, and musicians). The review showed that self-compassion was positively correlated with social support and was a good complement to mental toughness. But it also showed that there was a lack of knowledge about this concept in the field of the performing arts (dance and music). Moreover, the results highlighted the importance of looking at why self-compassion does or does not develop and, more importantly, how to help performers and those around them develop it.\nMost of the studies covered in this review examined the potential benefits of self-compassion on well-being and social relationships. Few, however, examined the influence of selfcompassion on sports and artistic performance. Developing studies highlighting the links between self-compassion and performance could improve acceptance of ideas about this concept among these populations.\nThe literature reviewed showed that the positive relationships between self-compassion, mental toughness, and social environments exists in populations of athletes (Fontana et\u00a0 al., 2017; Wilson et\u00a0 al., 2019; Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020; Johnson, 2020; Stamatis et\u00a0al., 2020; Maranan and Lopez, 2021). Studies suggest that self-compassion is a psychological resource that should be\u00a0 developed alongside mental toughness and that the use of either concept depends on the context and setting. Selfcompassion and mental toughness are related but distinct concepts, and they have been insufficiently studied together from the perspective of mental health or performance in sport and the arts. Both help to enhance performance and well-being by supporting performers as they attempt to manage stress, regulate thoughts and emotions, focus and re-focus their attention, and persevere despite setbacks.\nThe interacting effects of mental toughness and selfcompassion on mental health are, therefore, an unresolved issue that deserves further investigation. Are they buffering, reinforcing, or antagonistic effects? Optimal mental health in sport may not only be\u00a0 about mental toughness and selfcompassion, but also about the timing and context of their application. One hypothesis would be\u00a0 to adapt the concept of self-compassion to the world of sport by competency through mental toughness, two concepts to be\u00a0 studied in parallel (Adam et\u00a0 al., 2021). Self-compassion would also help\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887099\nperformers overcome feelings of stigmatization over their vulnerabilities by allowing them to seek help. The research reviewed showed that more self-compassionate athletes reported seeking the help they thought necessary more frequently than their less self-compassionate peers (Scott et\u00a0 al., 2021). Future studies should include more representative samples from a wider range of performers (i.e., athletes, dancers, and musicians) to investigate the potential effects of different performance cultures.\nThis review sought to provide an overview of the current literature on self-compassion, mental toughness, and the social environment in the worlds of sport (athletes) and performing arts (dancers and musicians). We\u00a0 conclude that the number of multi-day intervention programs and longitudinal studies should be\u00a0 increased. These studies should consider assessing the specific aspects of performance culture and settings that could alter the effectiveness of these interventions. In addition, overall performance specific measures could be\u00a0 developed to assess general levels of self-compassion. The development of a theoretical framework explaining how self-compassion affects a performer, the role of their entourage and its link to other psychological resources, such as mental toughness, could help to better understand this concept. The development of selfcompassion has also proven to be\u00a0 an important driver in the search for psychological help (Heath et\u00a0 al., 2017) in the general population. Indeed, it could be\u00a0 hypothesized that developing a compassionate and caring environment around performers would help them to develop self-compassion which, as shown in various research studies, improves well-being and performance (Jeon et\u00a0 al., 2016; Frentz et\u00a0 al., 2020; Scott et\u00a0 al., 2021). It could also lead to performers being more open to seeking psychological help when needed (Adam et\u00a0al., 2021). This might make it possible to better prevent certain psychological shifts or difficulties (e.g., doubting their personal\ncapabilities, feeling bad about themselves) that performers currently keep silent for fear of appearing weak.\nIt is also important to emphasize the practical implications of applying self-compassion to the worlds of sport and the performing arts. Based on the current literature, self-compassion seems to be\u00a0particularly useful when trying to increase performers\u2019 well-being or help them better deal with stress, failure, and setbacks. Athletes\u2019 skepticism about self-compassion should also be\u00a0 taken seriously. Interventions intended for performers should first check whether participants have concerns about the concept, explain clearly why self-compassion has the potential to improve performance (e.g., by helping athletes deal with failure), demonstrate the links between self-compassion and mental toughness, and acknowledge that current research is still ongoing on how to apply self-compassion in performance contexts. Moreover, further research should be\u00a0 carried out to design interventions adapted to performers\u2019 entourages (i.e., coaches, parents), stakeholders who play crucial roles in the development of psychological skills such as self-compassion and mental toughness."
