1. **Investigate the effects of different porphyrin structures on cell migration.** The study used two porphyrins, free-base porphyrin and manganese (III) metallated porphyrin, but there are many other porphyrin structures that could be explored. Different porphyrin structures may have different effects on cell migration, and it would be interesting to see how these effects vary.


2. **Examine the effects of porphyrins on cell migration in different cancer cell lines.** The study only looked at the effects of porphyrins on cell migration in HT29 and CCD 841 CoTr cells. It would be interesting to see if the effects of porphyrins on cell migration are consistent across different cancer cell lines.


3. **Investigate the effects of porphyrins on cell migration in vivo.** The study was conducted in vitro, but it would be important to see if the effects of porphyrins on cell migration are also observed in vivo. Animal models of cancer could be used to study the effects of porphyrins on tumor growth and metastasis.


4. **Explore the mechanisms by which porphyrins inhibit cell migration.** The study did not investigate the mechanisms by which porphyrins inhibit cell migration. Further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms. This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as gene expression profiling, proteomics, and microscopy.


5. **Develop porphyrin-based therapies for cancer.** The findings of this study suggest that porphyrins could be used to develop new therapies for cancer. Porphyrins could be used to target cancer cells and inhibit their migration, thereby preventing metastasis. Further research is needed to develop porphyrin-based therapies that are safe and effective for use in humans.
