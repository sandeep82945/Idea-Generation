            "text": "The collision phenomenon is one of the most basic features of plasma gas dynamics, where the interactions between particles are taking place along with exchanges of momentum or kinetic energy. The nature of plasmas depends on the simultaneous interactions between the particles and the Coulomb forces are often directly involved in the collisions. There are two major collision types depending on whether the Coulomb forces are directly involved in the collision process: one is the non-Coulomb collisions, taking place between neutral particles, and between a neutral particle and a charged particle; the other is the Coulomb collisions taking place between charged particles. The non-Coulomb collisions describe the transient interactions of the particles in the distance equal to the size of the particle in weakly ionized plasmas [1]. The Coulomb collisions can describe the scattering of charged particles in the long-range of Debye length [2]. In both the collisions, there are still the elastic collision and the non-elastic collision [3]. The transport phenomena in plasmas, such as diffusion, heat conduction, and viscosity etc. are closely related to the collision effects [4-9], because the transport coefficients describing the transport processes are generally expressed with the average collision frequencies of the plasmas. The collision frequency is the average number of collisions experienced by each particle unit time, so the average collision frequency usually depends on the velocity distribution function of the particles in the plasmas [10]. Especially, for some nonequilibrium and complex plasmas, because the velocity distribution functions of particles are often not Maxwellian, the average collision frequencies in the plasmas are generally different from those in the Maxwell-distributed plasmas. Non-Maxwell velocity distributions are universal in nonequilibrium complex systems. In nonextensive statistical mechanics, the complex plasma system being at a nonequilibrium stationary state can be described by a power-law q-distribution [11-14]. In the cases of many astrophysical and space plasmas, the velocity distributions appeared reasonably Maxwellian at low energies but had a \u2018superthermal\u2019 power-law tail at high energies, which were a large deviation from a Maxwellian distribution. The non-Maxwell velocity distributions in the astrophysical and\nspace complex plasmas was observed, and in 1968, Vasyliunas introduced a non-Maxwellian empirical function (the kappa-distribution or Vasyliunas distribution) to fit the magnetic layer plasma measured by OGO1 and OGO3 satellite with high-energy tail characteristics [15]. In the same year, Montgomery et al, based on the observation of solar wind electronics, indicated that the solar wind electron velocity distribution has a high-speed tail of non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. Now nonextensive statistical mechanics has been widely used to research various complex systems, such as astrophysical and space plasmas [16-19], self-gravitating systems [20-23], and chemical reaction systems [24-25]. It has also been employed to study high-energy physics [26], anomalous diffusion [27], and even biological systems [28] etc. Here we focus on the average collision frequencies in the non-equilibrium complex plasmas with non-Maxwellian velocity distributions, such as those in the astrophysical and space plasmas. Complex plasma with a variety of non-Maxwellian velocity distributions has caused widespread concern in recent years. Especially, the non-Maxwellian velocity distributions have significant effects on transport processes of particles in complex plasmas. Recently, the average collision frequencies of electron-neutral-particle were studied for the weakly ionized plasma with the power-law q-distribution in nonexyensive statistics [9], with Vasyliunas\u2013Carins distribution, with the two-parameter (r,\u03c3) distribution and the three-parameter (\u03b1, r, \u03c3) velocity distribution [29], respectively. For the highly ionized plasmas, the collision frequencies of electron-electron, ion\u2013ion and electron-ion were studied for the power-law q-distribution in nonextensive statistics in Ref. [30]. These works have an important impact on our exploration and understanding of the transport properties in complex plasmas. The highly ionized plasmas can exist in the stellar interiors [31], in the Sun\u2019s corona, Sun\u2019s atmosphere [32], and in vast regions of interstellar space around the hot stars [33] etc. In this work, we study the average collision frequencies of electron-ion, electron-electron and ion-ion in the complex plasma with the two-parameter (r, \u03c3) and three-parameter (\u03b1, r, \u03c3) non-Maxwellian distributions, respectively, and then analyze the roles of these parameters in the average collision frequencies. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the types of the non-Maxwell velocity distributions. In Section 3, we study the collision frequencies of the charged particles in the complex plasmas with the non-Maxwellian distributions. In Section 4, we make the numerical analyses on the average collision frequencies. Finally in Section 5, we give the conclusion."

            "text": "The most basic one of non-Maxwell distributions is the well-known kappa-distribution observed in astrophysical and space plasmas [15], expressed by\n( )\n2/3 ( 1)2\n21 2\n2 3 ( 1) 1( ) 1 2 Bk Tf N m w\n\u03ba\n\u03ba \u03ba\n\u03c0 \u03ba\u03ba \u03ba \u03ba \u2212 \u2212 + \u23a1 \u23a4 \u23a1\u0393 +\u239b \u239e= \u2212 +\u23a2 \u23a5 \u23a2\u239c \u239f \u0393 \u2212\u239d \u23a0\u23a3 \u23a6 \u23a3 vv \u23a4 \u23a5 \u23a6 , (1)\nwhere v is velocity, kB is Boltzmann constant, N is number density, m is mass of the particle, is temperature of the plasma, is a characteristic speed with the most probable\nspeed\nB\n\u03ba T\n1/2 0[( 3/ 2) / ]w w\u03ba \u03ba= \u2212\n0 2 /Bw k T= m , and \u03ba >3/2 is the parameter describing the deviation from a thermal equilibrium. Only when we take \u03ba\u2192\u221e, the kappa-distribution (1) becomes to a Maxwellian distribution and the system reaches to a thermal equilibrium. Theoretically, the kappa-distribution is found to be exactly equivalent to the power-law q-distribution in nonextensive statistics if one makes the parameter transformation [34],\nand 2 (7 5 )T q= \u2212 T 11( 1)q \u03ba\u2212\u2212 = + , (2)\nwhere T is the temperature of the q-distribution and q is the nonextensive parameter. is not\nonly the temperature in the kappa-distribution, but it is also the physical temperature of the q-distribution in nonextensive statistics. Based on this parameter transformation, the \u03ba-distributed complex plasmas can be well studied under the framework of nonextensive statistics.\nT\nCompared to traditional Maxwellian distribution, the kappa-distribution better fits some of the observation data of the astrophysical and space plasmas, however, more and more complex non-Maxwell velocity distributions had been studied in complex plasmas. In this respect, Summers et al [35] introduced the generalized Lorentzian distribution, Qureshi et al [36] introduced the generalized two-parameter (r, \u03c3) distribution and Abid et al introduced the two-parameter (\u03b1, \u03ba) distribution [37]. Later, these two-parameter distributions were applied to different processing of plasmas, such as the parallel propagating electromagnetic modes of hot magnetized plasma [38], the dust surface potential in the multi-ion dusty plasma [19], and a fit to the data of the magneto sheath electron and the solar wind proton data [39] etc. The two-parameter ( , )r \u03c3 distribution in nonequilibrium complex plasmas can be written for jth plasma species (e.g., electrons and ions) [29, 36] as\n12 ,\n, 3/2 2 3 , ,\n3 1( ) 1 , 4 1\nr\nr j j r j\nr Tj r Tj\nE N f\nX v X v\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\u03c0 \u03c3 \u2212+\u23a1 \u23a4\u239b \u239e \u23a2 \u23a5= + \u239c \u239f\u239c \u239f\u2212\u23a2 \u23a5\u239d \u23a0\u23a3 \u23a6 v v (3)\nwhere Nj is the particle number density, vj is the velocity, ( )1/2/Tj B j jv k T m= is the thermal velocity, Tj is temperature, mj is mass and\n3 2 2\n, ( 1) ( ) ,\n3 31 2 2 2 2\nr\nrE\nr r\n\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2212 +\u2212 \u0393\n= \u239b \u239e \u239b\u0393 \u2212 \u0393 +\u239c \u239f \u239c+ +\u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u239e \u239f \u23a0\n(4)\n, 1\n1\n3 33 2 2 2 2 .\n5 5( 1) 2 2 2 2\nr r\nr rX\nr r\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3+ \u239b \u239e \u239b \u239e\u0393 \u0393 \u2212\u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f+ +\u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u23a0= \u239b \u239e \u239b\u2212 \u0393 \u2212 \u0393\u239c \u239f \u239c+ +\u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u239e \u239f \u23a0\n(5)\nThe two parameters r and \u03c3 have significantly determined deviation of the plasma from the thermal equilibrium. When we take and0r \u2192 1\u03c3 \u03ba= + , the ( , )r \u03c3 distribution (3) reduces to the kappa-distribution function, when we take ,0r \u2192 \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e , the ( , )r \u03c3 distribution (3) becomes a Maxwellian distribution. Based on the normalization and the definition of temperature in the above distribution function, the parameters andr \u03c3 must satisfy the conditions: 1\u03c3 > and (1 ) 5 / 2r\u03c3 + > . Generally, if we increase the value of only and keep the value ofr \u03c3 unchanged, the contribution of high energy particles decreases, but the shoulder of the distribution curve becomes wider. Similarly, if we increase the value of \u03c3 only and keep the value of fixed, the result is the same [37]. r A large number of studies have shown that there are many linear and nonlinear space plasma phenomena that can be explained by non-Maxwellian distributions of plasmas, such as those in the solar wind [40], in the magnetocaloric [39] and auroral regions [41,42]. And at the same time, people are looking for more generalized distribution functions to understand the space plasma physics. In 2017, a three-parameter (\u03b1, r, \u03c3) velocity distribution was introduced [43]: \u03b1 is the rate of energetic particles on the shoulder, is the energetic particles on a broad shoulder,r \u03c3 is the\nsuperthermality on the tail of velocity distribution curve of plasma species. The three-parameter distribution can understand the observed space plasma phenomena more accurately. The three-parameter (\u03b1, r, \u03c3) velocity distribution function is a more complex non-Maxwell distribution, which can be expressed for the jth plasma species [29,43,44] as\n14 2 , ,\n, , 3 3/2 4 2 , ,\n3 1( ) 1 1 , 4 1\nr\nj j jr r j\nTj r Tj r Tj\nN f\nv X v X v\n\u03c3\n\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c1 \u03b1\n\u03c0 \u03c3 \u2212+\u23a1 \u23a4\u239b \u239e \u239b \u239e \u23a2 \u23a5= + +\u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f\u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f\u2212\u23a2 \u23a5\u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u23a0\u23a3 \u23a6 v v v \uff086\uff09\nwhere [44], ( ) ( ) 3 2 2 , , 3\n, 2 2 2 2\n( ) , (1 9 )( 1) 1r\nr r r r \u03b1 \u03c3 \u03c3 3 \u03c3\u03c1 \u03b7 \u03b1 \u03c3 \u03c3+ + + \u0393 = + \u2212 \u0393 \u2212 \u0393 + \uff087\uff09\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 3 3 7 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 , 2 25 5 2 2 2 2 .r r r rr r r \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03b7 \u03c3 + + + + + + \u0393 \u2212 \u0393 \u0393 \u2212 \u0393 = \u0393 \u2212 \u0393 \uff088\uff09\nThis velocity distribution function has three parameters \u03b1, r and \u03c3, satisfying the condition 1\u03c3 > , 0\u03b1 > and (1 ) 5 / 2r\u03c3 + > . Actually, the three-parameter distribution function (6) consists of many\ndifferent distribution functions. For example, when we take 0\u03b1 = , it becomes the two-parameter ( , )r \u03c3 distribution, when we take 0\u03b1 \u2192 and , it reduces to the 0r \u2192 \u03c3 -distribution in nonextensive statistics, when we take and0r \u2192 \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e , it reduces to Cairns- distribution [45], when we take and0r \u2192 1\u03c3 \u03ba= + , it reduces to Vasyliunas-Cairns distribution [46], when we take 0\u03b1 \u2192 , and 0r \u2192 1\u03c3 \u03ba= + , it becomes the kappa-distribution, and when we take 0\u03b1 \u2192 , and0r \u2192 \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e , it recovers to a Maxwellian distribution."

            "text": "The effective radius of the electrostatic interactions at normal temperatures is about hundred times that of the collisions between a charged particle and a neutral particle, so the Coulomb collisions play a main role in the highly ionized plasma [47]. When the incident charged particle is deflected by the Coulomb collisions of target charged particles, small-angle scatterings produce a superposed 90-degree net deflection of the incident particle long before the deflection of a single large-angle close collision, therefore the collision frequency of charged particles in the highly ionized plasma needs to be calculated on the basis of the Coulomb scattering model. Since Coulomb electrostatic interactions between charged particles are long-range interactions, the Coulomb scattering model is effectively applied to highly ionized plasma studies. The Coulomb collision in the highly ionized plasma consists of two different transport properties: the velocity space transport and the physical space transport. In the velocity space transport, the momentum exchange and the energy exchange correspond to the different Coulomb cross sections, respectively [2]. When the charged particles are incident in the plasma, the momentum relaxation of the incident particles represents the total loss of the incident particle directional momentum. The test particle method can be used to calculate the momentum relaxation collision frequency of the incident tape electric particles, wherein the Coulomb cross section of the tested particles is a function of the relative velocity of the test particles and the target particles [1]. In fact, the test particles in the highly ionized plasma are not affected by the target particle electric field of the distance exceeding Debye length [2]. For the momentum relaxation of the test particle j, the momentum relaxation collision frequency in the background of field charged particles k can be expressed [3,48] as\n2 2 4\n2 2 3 0\nln ,\n4 k j k\njk jk jk\nN Z Z e m v \u03bd \u03c0\u03b5 \u039b = \uff089\uff09\nwhere / ( )jk j k j km m m m m= + is the reduced mass, jk jv = \u2212v vk is an absolute value of the relative velocity, jZ e is the charge of an j-particle, kZ e is the charge of an k-particle, 0\u03b5 is the vacuum dielectric constant, is the number density of k-particles, and ln\u039b is the Coulomb scattering factor determined by the Debye length. In Eq. (9), the collision frequency \u03bd kN jk is a function of the relative velocity vjk , and therefore, the average collision frequency will depend on the velocity distribution of charged particles in the plasma under consideration. Namely, the average collision frequency is that\n2 2 4 3\n2 2 0\nln ,\n4 k j k jk jk jk\nN Z Z e v\nm \u03bd \u03c0\u03b5 \u2212\u039b= \uff0810\uff09\nIn the conventional statistical physics framework, the charged particles are in the thermodynamic equilibrium state and have a Maxwellian velocity distribution, so the average collision frequency of electron-ion collision is calculated [3] as\n2 4\n2 1/ 2 3/ 2 0\n2 ln ,\n12 ( ) i i ei\ne B e\nN Z e m k T \u03bd \u03b5 \u03c0 \u039b = \uff0811\uff09\nand the average collision frequency of electron-electron collision or ion-ion collision is calculated as\n4 4\n2 1/ 2 3/2 0\nln , , .\n12 ( ) j j jj\nj B e\nN Z e j e i\nm k T \u03bd \u03b5 \u03c0 \u039b = = \uff0812\uff09\nEq. (11) and Eq. (12) show that the average collision frequency of the electron-ion collision is different from the average collision frequency of electron-electron, ion-ion collision in a Maxwellian velocity distribution. But for nonequilibrium complex plasmas, the system is not in the thermal equilibrium state and the velocity distributions are not Maxwellian one, the average collision frequency needs to be recalculated on the basis of the velocity distribution functions of charged particles.\n3.1.1 The average collision frequency of electron-ion in the two-parameter (r, \u03c3) distribution According to Eq. (10), the average collision frequency of electron\u2013ion in the plasma with the two-parameter (r, \u03c3) distribution is calculated by\n( ) 4 4\n3 2 2 , 0 ln, . 4 i i ei ei r ei N Z er m v \u03c3 \u03bd \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b5 \u2212\u039b= \uff0813\uff09\nIn Eq. (13), the integration calculation on the average value 3 ,ei r v \u03c3 \u2212 of the relative velocity of electron-ion collision in the two-parameter (r, \u03c3) distribution is divergent.

The expressions of the average collision frequencies of electron-ion, electron-electron and ion-ion in the plasma with the two types of non-Maxwell velocity distributions are derived respectively. The average collision frequencies for the charged particles in the two-parameter (r, \u03c3 ) distribution are given by Eqs.

We find that all the average collision frequencies in the complex plasmas depend strongly on the two-parameters (r, \u03c3 ) and the three-parameters (\u03b1, r, \u03c3 ) in the non-Maxwell velocity distributions and thus show their significant deviations from those in the plasma with a Maxwellian velocity distribution. These results will have important effects on the transport coefficients and their properties of charged particles in the highly ionized complex plasmas with the non-Maxwell distributions."
