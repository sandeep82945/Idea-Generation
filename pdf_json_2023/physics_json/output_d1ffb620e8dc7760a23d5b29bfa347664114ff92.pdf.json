    "abstractText": "The filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, in which sexual reproduction remains to be discovered, proliferates mainly via asexual spores (conidia). Therefore, despite its industrial importance in food fermentation and recombinant protein production, breeding beneficial strains by genetic crosses is difficult. In Aspergillus flavus, which is genetically close to A. oryzae, structures known as sclerotia are formed asexually, but they are also related to sexual development. Sclerotia are observed in some A. oryzae strains, although no sclerotia formation has been reported in most strains. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying sclerotia formation in A. oryzae may contribute to discover its sexual development. Some factors involved in sclerotia formation have been previously identified, but their regulatory mechanisms have not been well studied in A. oryzae. In this study, we found that copper strongly inhibited sclerotia formation and induced conidiation. Deletion of AobrlA encoding a core regulator of conidiation and ecdR involved in transcriptional induction of AobrlA suppressed the coppermediated inhibition of sclerotia formation, suggesting that AobrlA induction in response to copper leads not only to conidiation but also to inhibition of sclerotia formation. In addition, deletion of the copper-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene and its copper chaperone gene partially suppressed such coppermediated induction of conidiation and inhibition of sclerotia formation, indicating that copper regulates asexual development via the copper-dependent SOD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that copper regulates asexual development, such as sclerotia formation and conidiation, via the copper-dependent SOD and transcriptional induction of AobrlA in A. oryzae.",

Therefore, despite its industrial importance in food fermentation and recombinant protein production, breeding beneficial strains by genetic crosses is difficult. In Aspergillus flavus, which is genetically close to A. oryzae, structures known as sclerotia are formed asexually, but they are also related to sexual development. Sclerotia are observed in some A. oryzae strains, although no sclerotia formation has been reported in most strains. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying sclerotia formation in A. oryzae may contribute to discover its sexual development. Some factors involved in sclerotia formation have been previously identified, but their regulatory mechanisms have not been well studied in A. oryzae. In this study, we\u00a0 found that copper strongly inhibited sclerotia formation and induced conidiation. Deletion of AobrlA encoding a core regulator of conidiation and ecdR involved in transcriptional induction of AobrlA suppressed the coppermediated inhibition of sclerotia formation, suggesting that AobrlA induction in response to copper leads not only to conidiation but also to inhibition of sclerotia formation. In addition, deletion of the copper-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene and its copper chaperone gene partially suppressed such coppermediated induction of conidiation and inhibition of sclerotia formation, indicating that copper regulates asexual development via the copper-dependent SOD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that copper regulates asexual development, such as sclerotia formation and conidiation, via the copper-dependent SOD and transcriptional induction of AobrlA in A. oryzae.\nKEYWORDS\nFilamentous fungi, Aspergillus oryzae, Copper, Conidiation, Sclerotia formation, Superoxide dismutase, AobrlA\n1. Introduction\nAspergillus oryzae is a filamentous fungus, and numerous strains of A. oryzae are industrially used for the fermentation of traditional Japanese foods, such as sake, miso, and soy sauce. A. oryzae is also used industrially to produce recombinant proteins (Ward, 2012) and recently expected as a host for the production of heterologous secondary metabolites (Alberti et\u00a0al., 2017). Owing to its industrial importance, the establishment of crossbreeding techniques via sexual development is expected to be\u00a0useful in generating beneficial strains. However, sexual reproduction remains to be\u00a0discovered in A. oryzae (Wada et\u00a0al., 2012), and it proliferates"

Therefore, the discovery of sexual reproduction in A. oryzae, which generates genetically diverse strains, would greatly enhance its potential industrial applications.\nAsexual filamentous fungi, such as A. oryzae, mainly proliferate via asexual spores called conida. The regulation of conidiation has been well established in Aspergillus nidulans. Conidiation is initiated by the transcriptional induction of the gene for the transcription factor brlA, sequentially activating the downstream genes for transcription factors abaA and then wetA, which are required for proper conidiation (Park and Yu, 2012). These components of the conidiation regulatory pathway are conserved and are also required for conidiation in A. oryzae (Ogawa et\u00a0 al., 2010). In addition to conidiation, several filamentous fungal species belonging to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota asexually develop a hardened mycelial aggregation called the sclerotium, which survives for long periods under unfavorable environmental conditions (Georgiou et\u00a0al., 2006; Dyer and O\u2019Gorman, 2012). In some Aspergillus species, the sclerotium is closely related to the formation of sexual reproductive structures (Kwon-Chung and Sugui, 2009), and functions as a repository for sexual reproductive structures in Aspergillus flavus, which is genetically close to A. oryzae (Horn et\u00a0al., 2009; Gibbons et\u00a0al., 2012). Therefore, the sclerotium would be\u00a0expected to play a crucial role in sexual reproduction of A. oryzae, if it exists. However, no sclerotia formation has been reported in most A. oryzae industrial strains (Murakami, 1971), and understanding of its regulatory mechanisms will be\u00a0required to enhance sclerotia formation, which probably contributes to the discovery of sexual reproduction of A. oryzae.\nUnlike conidiation, the knowledges about the regulatory mechanism of sclerotia formation are limited. However, several environmental factors have been shown to be\u00a0involved in sclerotia formation, such as temperature, light, oxygen availability, humidity, pH, and medium composition (Dyer and O\u2019Gorman, 2012). Oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in sclerotia formation (Georgiou et\u00a0al., 2006). Sclerotia formation in A. oryzae is also known to be\u00a0affected by environmental conditions; malt extract medium has been used to induce sclerotia formation and potato dextrose medium has been used to induce conidiation (Nakamura et\u00a0al., 2016). In addition, AoRim15 which is homologous to Rim15, a stress-responsive kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is involved in sclerotia formation in A. oryzae (Nakamura et\u00a0al., 2016), suggesting that certain environmental stresses are involved in sclerotia formation. Although the involvement of oxidative stress-responsive pathways in sclerotia formation has been well studied (Georgiou et\u00a0al., 2006), little is known about the genetic basis underlying the regulation of sclerotia formation. In A. oryzae, two transcription factors, EcdR and SclR, are involved in sclerotia formation (Jin et\u00a0 al., 2011a,b). Deletion of ecdR stimulates sclerotia formation and inhibits conidiation (Jin et\u00a0al., 2011a). In contrast, deletion of sclR leads to loss of the ability to from sclerotia and dense conidial formation (Jin et\u00a0al., 2009, 2011b). However, the pathways regulating sclerotia formation that these transcription factors act upon remain unclear. In addition, these phenotypes caused by deletion of ecdR and sclR suggest the relationship between the regulatory mechanisms of sclerotia formation and conidiation.\nCopper functions as a cofactor for some enzymes and participates in quite diverse cellular processes, including\nrespiration (cytochrome c oxidase), detoxification of ROS (superoxide dismutase (SOD); (Ruiz et\u00a0 al., 2021), nitrogen utilization (nitrite reductase; Long et\u00a0 al., 2015), iron uptake (ferroxidase; Schrettl et\u00a0al., 2004), and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (laccase; Upadhyay et\u00a0al., 2013). In some Aspergillus species, copper is known to be\u00a0required for conidial pigmentation (Chang et\u00a0 al., 2019). Moreover, genetic evidence for the involvement of copper in asexual development such as conidiation and sclerotia formation has been established in filamentous fungi. Deletion of Afmac1, encoding a copper-binding transcription factor, results in a conidiation defect in Aspergillus fumigatus (Kusuya et\u00a0al., 2017). The copper transporter BcCcc2 is required for sclerotia formation in Botrytis cinerea (Saitoh et\u00a0al., 2010). In addition to this genetic evidence, the effects of copper treatment on sclerotia development have also been reported. Copper has been suggested to inhibit sclerotia formation in the A. oryzae G15 strain (Long et\u00a0al., 2017) and in an Aspergillus strain (Rogers and Li, 1985). In contrast, copper induces sclerotia formation in Penicillium thomii (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2014). These findings support the conclusion that copper is involved in the asexual development of filamentous fungi. However, high concentrations of copper (> 80 \u03bcM) used in these studies possibly cause toxic effects such as oxidative stress (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2014), and physiological effects of copper on asexual development have not been investigated.\nIn this study, we\u00a0found that trace amounts of copper (1.6 \u03bcM) strongly induced conidiation and inhibited sclerotia formation in A. oryzae, and demonstrated that sclerotia formation is inhibited by AoBrlA, which is critical for conidiation. In addition, the copperdependent SOD AoSod1 functions in induction of copper-mediated conidiation and in inhibiting of sclerotia formation. These results suggest that activation of SOD by copper leads to the stimulation of AobrlA, resulting in the induction of conidiation and inhibition of sclerotia formation."

Stereomicroscopic observation also showed sclerotia formation and sparsely formed conidiophores on the YG agar medium (Figure\u00a01B). In contrast, sclerotia formation was hardly detected, and dense conidiophore formation was observed on YG agar medium supplemented with the trace elements solution, which are often used to prepare media for Aspergillus nidulans (Fukuda et\u00a0al., 2009; Figures\u00a01A,B). Supplementation with trace elements solution significantly increased the conidiation efficiency without affecting growth (p < 0.01; Figures\u00a0 1C,D). These results suggest the involvement of a component(s) of the trace elements solution in asexual development of A. oryzae. When the components of the trace elements solution were separately added to the YG medium, supplementation with 1.6 \u03bcM CuSO4\u00b75H2O was found to strongly inhibit sclerotia formation and induce conidiation without affecting the growth, similar to what was observed upon supplementation with the trace elements solution (Figures\u00a01C\u2013E). Supplementation with 1.6 \u03bcM CuCl2 had indistinguishable effects on development (Figure\u00a0 1F). These results indicate that trace copper affects asexual development on YG agar medium. To investigate the effects of copper on media other than YG medium, CuSO4\u00b75H2O was added to ME agar medium, on which sclerotia formation is induced (Nakamura et\u00a0 al., 2016). Sclerotia formation was also inhibited on this medium, and conidiation was induced by supplementing CuSO4\u00b75H2O to the ME agar medium as well as YG agar medium (Supplementary Figure S4).

In several Aspergillus species, activation of the central regulatory pathway, composed sequentially of brlA, abaA, and wetA, plays critical roles in conidiation (Park and Yu, 2012). AobrlA, AoabaA, and AowetA homologous to these genes are also required for proper conidiation in A. oryzae (Ogawa et\u00a0al., 2010). The sspA gene, which is homologous to ssp1 that encodes a major protein present in the mature sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotium (Li and Rollins, 2009), was upregulated in A. oryzae mutants that form an increased number of sclerotia (Jin et\u00a0 al., 2011a,b). In concordance with the developmental changes caused by copper, such as the induction of conidiation and inhibition of sclerotia formation, the mRNA levels of AobrlA, AoabaA, and AowetA were strongly upregulated, and that of sspA was downregulated by copper supplementation (Figure\u00a02).

Considering the inhibitory function of AoBrlA in sclerotia formation, EcdR may be\u00a0 involved in the inhibition of sclerotia formation by copper. As expected, the ecdR deletion mutant displayed numerous sclerotia and hardly formed conidia on the YG agar medium containing copper (Figure\u00a04A). According to such developmental phenotypes, AobrlA, AoabaA, and AowetA were not induced, and sspA was not repressed in the ecdR deletion mutant grown on media supplemented with copper (Figure\u00a04B). These results indicate that EcdR regulates the expression of AobrlA to inhibit sclerotia formation and induce conidiation in response to copper.\n3.6. Copper-dependent superoxide dismutase is involved in the copper-mediated developmental regulation\nAs the presence of trace copper affects conidiation and sclerotia formation, we\u00a0hypothesized that proteins related to copper homeostasis are involved in developmental regulation. As the copper-binding proteins with roles in copper homeostasis in A. fumigatus and yeasts have been previously listed (Wiemann et\u00a0al., 2017), potential homologs to these copper-binding proteins were identified in the proteins encoded in the genome sequence of A. oryzae. In this study, copper transporters were\nnot examined, but rather the focus was on determining the intracellular response to copper. The predicted copper-binding transcription factors AO090003000161 and AO090701001154 and a predicted Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) AO090020000521 were identified by BLASTp analyses, and they were designated as AoAceA, AoMacA, and AoSod1, respectively (Table\u00a01). Although proteins homologous to the copper-binding transcription factor CufA and the copper metallothionein CmtA of A. fumigatus were not found by BLASTp analysis, nucleotide sequences predicted to encode these proteins were found by tBLASTn analysis. The cufA homologous gene was predicted at Chr5:1,300,4491,301,358 with two introns, and the cmtA homologous gene was predicted at Chr7:2,741,077-2,741,532 with two introns. Therefore, we\u00a0designated these genes as AocufA and AocmtA, respectively (Table\u00a01).\nTo investigate the involvement of such copper-binding proteins in the copper-mediated regulation of asexual development, deletion mutants of the genes encoding them were constructed and incubated on YG agar medium with or without copper.

In the presence of copper, the Aosod1 deletion mutant formed numerous sclerotia (Figure\u00a05A), whereas the other deletion mutants did not form sclerotia (Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting that AoSod1 inhibits sclerotia formation. In S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus, activation of Sod1 requires the copper chaperone Ccs1/CcsA, which introduces copper ions into Sod1 (Skopp et\u00a0al., 2019; Du et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, a copper chaperone for AoSod1 might be\u00a0involved in the inhibition of sclerotia formation in A. oryzae. BLASTp analysis using the CcsA sequence of A. fumigatus showed AO090011000670 as its homologous protein in A. oryzae, which was designated as AoCcsA. The AoccsA deletion mutant formed numerous sclerotia in the presence of copper, as did the Aosod1 deletion mutant (Figure\u00a0 5A). In addition, the conidiation efficiencies of the Aosod1 and AoccsA deletion mutants were reduced compared with that of the wild-type strain in the presence of copper (Figure\u00a05B). Enhanced sclerotia formation and decreased conidiation of the Aosod1 and AoccsA deletion mutants were suppressed by reintroducing these genes (Supplementary Figures S6B,C). These results indicate that AoSod1 and AoCcsA are involved in inhibition of sclerotia formation and induction of conidiation in response to copper. On the other hand, since conidiation was still induced by supplementation with copper in the Aosod1 and AoccsA deletion mutants (Figure\u00a05B), factors other than AoSod1 and AoCcsA may be\u00a0involved in the induction of conidiation by copper. To investigate how AoSod1 and AoCcsA mediate conidiation and sclerotia formation, a transcriptional analysis of AobrlA, AoabaA, AowetA, and sspA was performed under the condition of being supplemented with copper. In the Aosod1 and AoccsA deletion mutants, the mRNA levels of AobrlA, AoabaA, and AowetA were downregulated (p < 0.01), and those of sspA were significantly induced (p < 0.05; Figure\u00a05C).

            "text": "In the present study, we\u00a0found that trace copper regulates asexual development in A. oryzae. Induction of conidiation by copper was observed in the A. oryzae strains, as well as in A. sojae and A. luchuensis strains (Figure\u00a01 and Supplementary Figure S5). Conidiation defects have been reported in deletion mutants of Afmac1, which encodes a copper-responsive transcription factor in A. fumigatus (Kusuya et\u00a0al., 2017) and Bcccc2, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase in B. cinerea (Saitoh et\u00a0al., 2010). These findings suggest that copper induces conidiation in filamentous fungi. In contrast, copper strongly inhibited the sclerotia formation in A. oryzae (Figure\u00a0 1). High concentrations of copper have also been reported to inhibit sclerotia formation in A. oryzae G15 strain (Long et\u00a0al., 2017) and an Aspergillus strain (Rogers and Li, 1985). These findings indicate the inhibitory effects of copper on sclerotia formation in A. oryzae. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of copper on sclerotia formation, copper has been reported to induce sclerotia formation in P. thomii (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2014), and the Bcccc2 deletion abolished sclerotia formation in B. cinerea (Saitoh et\u00a0al., 2010). Therefore, the effects of copper on sclerotia formation vary in filamentous fungi.\nThe deletion mutant of AobrlA, which plays a critical role in conidiation, showed enhanced sclerotia formation and increased expression of sspA in the presence of copper (Figure\u00a03), indicating that AoBrlA has inhibitory functions in sclerotia formation. The enhanced sclerotia formation in the AobrlA deletion mutant was suppressed by the reintroduction of AobrlA, supporting the inhibitory functions of AoBrlA in sclerotia formation. Additionally, in A. flavus which is genetically close to A. oryzae, deletion of fluG results in delayed induction of brlA and increased sclerotia formation (Chang et\u00a0 al., 2012), and brlA is downregulated under the sclerotial state (Wu et\u00a0al., 2014). These findings also support the interpretation that AoBrlA has inhibitory functions in sclerotia formation in A. oryzae. However, it was previously reported that deletion of AobrlA did not enhance sclerotia formation under the condition where sclerotia formation was induced (Ogawa et\u00a0al., 2010). Considering these findings, AoBrlA is thought to function as an inhibitor of sclerotia formation in the presence of trace copper but not in the condition inducing sclerotia formation (Figure\u00a0 6). Moreover, the expression of AobrlA was induced in response to copper (Figure\u00a02), suggesting that copper stimulates the expression of AobrlA to induce conidiation and inhibit sclerotia formation (Figure\u00a06).\nThe ecdR deletion mutant formed a large number of sclerotia, even in the presence of copper (Figure\u00a04A), indicating that EcdR is required for the copper-mediated inhibition of sclerotia formation. As EcdR was suggested to be\u00a0 an inducer of AobrlA at the early stage of conidiation (Jin et\u00a0al., 2011a), it is suggested that copper stimulates transcriptional induction of AobrlA by EcdR to induce conidiation and inhibit sclerotia formation (Figure\u00a06). However, it is unclear how copper affects induction of AobrlA by EcdR. As copper supplementation did not affect ecdR expression (Figure\u00a02), coppermediated developmental regulation does not seem to be\u00a0dependent on a transcriptional change of ecdR.\nThe absence of cupper-dependent SOD AoSod1 and its copper chaperone AoCcsA inhibited conidiation and downregulated the\nFIGURE\u00a05 AoSod1 and AoCcsA are involved in copper-mediated developmental regulation.

In addition, deletion of Aosod1 and AoccsA resulted in enhanced sclerotia formation in the presence of copper (Figure\u00a05A), which is thought to be\u00a0caused by the downregulation of AobrlA. SOD scavenges ROS (Staerck et\u00a0al., 2017), and deletion of sodA and ccsA leads to increased ROS accumulation in A. fumigatus (Du et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, it is suggested that copper may stimulate AoSod1 to scavenge intracellular ROS, and that intracellular ROS accumulation in the absence of AoSod1 or AoCcsA may inhibit AobrlA induction in A. oryzae, resulting in inhibited conidiation and an induction of sclerotia formation (Figure\u00a06). The possible induction of sclerotia formation by ROS accumulation led to the speculation that oxidative stress affects sclerotia formation. However, treatment with oxidative stress-inducing agents did not stimulate sclerotia formation in the presence of copper (Supplementary Figure S8). This result is consistent with a previous report that treatment with the oxidative stress agent did not activate sclerotia formation (Papapostolou et\u00a0al., 2014). Although the effects of copper and Aosod1 deletion on ROS accumulation remain unclear, complex mechanisms besides ROS may be\u00a0involved in the copper-mediated inhibition of sclerotia formation.\nTo date, the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in asexual development caused by environmental cues have not been well elucidated in A. oryzae. The present study demonstrating that trace copper mediates regulation of asexual development by inducing SOD and AobrlA will be\u00a0greatly helpful in understanding such mechanisms in A. oryzae. As the involvements of these factors in sclerotia formation have not been reported, this study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of sclerotia formation. Therefore, our findings are expected to contribute to the enhancement of sclerotia formation and the ongoing search for sexual reproduction in A. oryzae."
