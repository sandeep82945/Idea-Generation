    "abstractText": "We propose a cryptography-inspired model for nonlocal correlations. Following the celebrated De BroglieBohm theory, we model nonlocal boxes as realistic systems with instantaneous signalling at the hidden variable level. By introducing randomness in the distribution of the hidden variable, the superluminal signalling model is made compatible with the operational no-signalling condition. As the design mimics the famous symmetric key encryption system called One Time Pads (OTP), we call this the OTP model for nonlocal boxes. We demonstrate utility of this model in several esoteric examples related to the nonclassicality of nonlocal boxes. In particular, the breakdown of communication complexity using nonlocal boxes can be better understood in this framework. Furthermore, we discuss the Van Dam protocol and show its connection to homomorphic encryption in cryptography. We also discuss possible ways of encapsulating quantum realizable nonlocal correlations within this framework and show that the principle of Information Causality imposes further constraints at the hidden variable level. Present work thus orchestrates the results in classical cryptography to improve our understanding of nonlocal correlations and welcomes further research to this connection.",

            "text": "A Cryptography Inspired Model for Non-local Correlations: Decrypting the Enigmas\nGovind Lal Sidhardh1, 2 and Manik Banik1 1Department of Physics of Complex Systems, S.N. Bose National Center for Basic Sciences,\nBlock JD, Sector III, Salt Lake, Kolkata 700106, India. 2Department of Physics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA 27708\nWe propose a cryptography-inspired model for nonlocal correlations. Following the celebrated De BroglieBohm theory, we model nonlocal boxes as realistic systems with instantaneous signalling at the hidden variable level. By introducing randomness in the distribution of the hidden variable, the superluminal signalling model is made compatible with the operational no-signalling condition. As the design mimics the famous symmetric key encryption system called One Time Pads (OTP), we call this the OTP model for nonlocal boxes. We demonstrate utility of this model in several esoteric examples related to the nonclassicality of nonlocal boxes. In particular, the breakdown of communication complexity using nonlocal boxes can be better understood in this framework. Furthermore, we discuss the Van Dam protocol and show its connection to homomorphic encryption in cryptography. We also discuss possible ways of encapsulating quantum realizable nonlocal correlations within this framework and show that the principle of Information Causality imposes further constraints at the hidden variable level. Present work thus orchestrates the results in classical cryptography to improve our understanding of nonlocal correlations and welcomes further research to this connection.\nIntroduction.\u2013 Violation of Bell inequality drastically revolutionizes our world-view [1] (see also [2\u20134]). An inputoutput correlation with spatially separated input settings cannot have a local hidden variable model whenever it violates a Bell inequality, provided the input settings are independent of the hidden variable. This nonlocal behavior creates an apparent tension with the well-regarded no-signaling (NS) principle [5]. However, by introducing randomness into the hidden variable model, a peaceful coexistence between these two concepts becomes possible. A celebrated example is De Broglie-Bohm theory [6\u20138], which accommodates both nonlocality and NS by adhering randomness in the distribution of nonlocal variable [9].\nWhile Bell\u2019s theorem offers a fundamentally new outlook of the physical world, a better appreciation of the Bell inequality emerged when it was realized that the non-local quantum correlations inherent in entangled particles could be utilized as cryptographic keys [10]. Subsequently, this intuition underwent a more detailed analysis leading to a comprehensive establishment on a solid foundation [11\u201314]. A number of experiments involving entangled quantum systems establish our world to be non-local [15\u201324] (see also [25] for the list of other important Bell tests). Later, it is realized that nonlocality is not a feature specific to quantum theory only. Popescu & Rohrlich come up with a hypothetical NS correlation [26], now familiar as PR box, which turns out to be more non-local than quantum theory [27]. Such a post-quantum non-local correlation has preposterous consequences. For instance, the existence of the PR box in a world leads to the collapse of communication complexity, as any non-local binary function could be evaluated with a constant amount of communication when assisted with such correlations [28\u201330]. In addition, such correlations have also been shown to violate the principle of Information Causality (IC), a generalization of NS principle [31] (see also [32\u201334]).\nNaturally, the following questions arise: Is it possible to provide an intuitive \u2018explanation\u2019 that elucidates the striking\nfeatures of non-local correlations [35]? How does communication complexity become trivial with PR correlation, which is otherwise a NS resource!? Why do some non-local correlations violate IC while others are perfectly compatible with it? Interestingly, in this work, we show that cryptography once again plays a benevolent role in addressing these questions. Inspired by basic ideas in cryptography, we develop a model that provides simple explanations for the aforesaid striking features of non-local correlations. From a foundational standpoint, our model shares similar features with the De BroglieBohm theory, as we model non-local boxes as \u2018realistic\u2019 systems with instantaneous signaling at the hidden variable level. The superluminal signaling mechanism is designed in such a way that it does not result in signaling at the operational level. Since the design is closely linked to the famous symmetric key encryption model called One Time Pads (OTP) [36], we refer to this as the OTP-model for non-local correlations. Before delving into the utility of this model, in the following, we will first formally introduce it and analyze some of its generic aspects.\nOTP-box.\u2013 The idea of cryptography has been instrumental in the development of the current information era [37]. At its core, cryptography studies the faithful transmission of information, secured away from the access of an eavesdropper. This is achieved by encrypting the information in such a way that the data transmitted through a public channel contains (ideally) zero information about the original message unless decrypted by a key. For instance, OTP is a symmetric encryption scheme where the sender and the receiver share the same key. The key here is a bit string which is long as of the message to be encrypted and is randomly sampled and, crucially, only used once. The encryption step is simply to \u2018XOR\u2019 the message with the key, i.e., Encrypt = Message \u2295 key. The encrypted message is then sent over to the receiver, who will decrypt the message again by \u2018XOR\u2019-ing with the same key, i.e., Decrypt = Encrypt \u2295 key = Message. As analyzed by Shannon, the security of this protocol is ensured when the ar X iv :2\n30 7.\n03 39\n5v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n7 J\nul 2\n02 3\n2\nkey is sampled uniformly randomly from the set of strings {0, 1}m, where m is the bit-length of the message [38].\nImportantly, as long as the receiver does not have the key, the OTP system is equivalent to a non-signaling scenario in the sense that the receiver gets no information about the message the sender intends to send. This is precisely the observation that prompted our model. Nature can, in principle, perform \u2018secure\u2019 instantaneous signaling as long as no one has access to the key a priori. To mathematically capture the connection between NS correlations and OTP-based crypto-system, we start with formally defining an OTP-box.\nDefinition 1. An OTP-box, shared between two parties (say Alice and Bob), is a black box defined by the tuple {X,Y,A,B,\u039b, p, g, f}, where X = [m], Y = [n], A = [2] = B are sets denoting Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s inputs and outputs, respectively; g : X \u2192 A, f : X\u00d7Y \u2192 B, are functions that define how the inputs are mapped to the outputs; \u03bb \u2208 \u039b = {0, 1} is the hidden variable that is inaccessible to the agents using the black box and is distributed according to a probability distribution {p(\u03bb)}. Moreover, the input-output correlation P that the agents observe outside the box is given by, P (a, b|x, y) = \u2211 \u03bb p(\u03bb)\u00d7 \u03b4(a, g(x)\u2295\u03bb)\u00d7 \u03b4(b, f(x, y)\u2295\u03bb), where \u03b4( , ) is the Kronecker delta.\nA quick inspection reveals the inspiration for the definition. In the language of OTP encryption, one may think of \u03bb \u2208 {0, 1} as the key in the encryption protocol. The OTP box does the following: depending on the input x, Alice receives the output g(x) \u2295 \u03bb. Since Alice knows g(x), she effectively has access to the key. Bob\u2019s output can be understood as the function f(x, y), but encrypted according to \u03bb as b = f(x, y) \u2295 \u03bb (see Fig.1). Within the black box, the information of Alice\u2019s input is instantaneously communicated to Bob\u2019s end, albeit inaccessible to Bob outside the box. Indeed,\nthe physics inside the box can be different as long as it is compatible with the physics outside. To summarise, it is as if the box itself is performing an OTP encryption of some function of the inputs and distributing the outputs to the parties. As we will show now, such crypto-systems satisfy NS property for a particular key distribution.\nLemma 1. The input-output correlation obtained from an OTP-box satisfies NS if and only if the distribution of the hidden variable within the black box (the key) is uniform, i.e., p(\u03bb) = 1/2.\nWe defer the proof of this Lemma to the Appendix. From now onwards, we will only consider those OTP-boxes that result in NS correlations. An OTP-box for a NS correlation (violating Bell inequality) can be thought of as a discrete version of the deterministic De Broglie-Bohm model; and interestingly, Lemma 1 here is analogous to the Signal-locality theorem as in the case of original De Broglie-Bohm theory [9].\nBefore proceeding further, let us discuss an explicit example of NS correlation that allows such an OTP model. For that we consider arguably the most famous 2, 2-input & 2, 2- output PR correlation, PPR(a, b|x, y) := 12\u03b4(a\u2295b, xy), where a, b, x, y \u2208 {0, 1}. An OTP model that reproduces this correlation is given by g(x) = 0 and f(x, y) = xy, and accordingly, Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s outputs from the OTP-box are a = \u03bb and b = xy\u2295 \u03bb respectively. According to Lemma 1, \u03bb being sampled with uniform probability from the set {0, 1} ensures NS outside the OTP-box. As Jeffrey Bub [39] points out, however, there is a fundamental difference between PR box and its underlying deterministic OTP-box. In a PR box, the temporal order of the inputs is irrelevant, and the correlations arise as a global feature of the statistics. In contrast, the temporal order of the inputs is relevant in OTP-box to determine its output values, which thus requires the assumption of a preferred foliation in space-time.\nOTP model for all the nonlocal vertices of 2, 2-input & 2, 2- output NS polytope follows immediately as these vertices are nothing but local relabelling of the aforesaid PR correlation [40]. In fact, one can consider more generic NS correlations with m-input on Alice\u2019s side and n-input on Bob\u2019s side, with each input having binary outputs. A nonlocal vertex of the m,n-input & 2, 2-output NS polytope will be called a fulloutput vertex if, in the marginal distributions, all possible outputs occur with nonzero probability for all the inputs. Notably, if for one of Alice\u2019s inputs, an m,n-input NS box only gives one output, one can simulate the box with a (m\u2212 1), n-input full-output NS box that simply ignores the redundant input. Our next result asserts the OTP model for all the full-output nonlocal vertices of m,n-input & 2, 2-output NS polytope.\nTheorem 1. All the full-output nonlocal vertices of m,ninput & 2, 2-output NS correlations allow an OTP model.\nProof of this theorem is provided in the Appendix. At this point, we recall that quantum correlations lie within the NS polytope. Therefore, to include quantum realizable and physically interesting NS correlations within OTP model frame-\n3 work, we proceed to introduce a generalized notion of the OTP-box.\nDefinition 2. A noisy OTP-box (N-OTP-box) is defined by the tuple {X,Y,A,B,\u039b1,\u039b2, p, g, f}, where X = [m], Y = [m], A = [2] = B are sets denoting Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s input and output sets respectively; g : X \u2192 A, f : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 B are functions that define how the inputs are mapped to the outputs; \u03bb1 \u2208 \u039b1 = {0, 1} = \u039b2 \u220b \u03bb2 are hidden variables that are inaccessible to the agents using the black box and is distributed according to p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2). Moreover, the input-output correlation P observed by the agents outside the N-OTP-box is given by, P (a, b|x, y) = \u2211 \u03bb1,\u03bb2\np(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) \u00d7 \u03b4(a, g(x) \u2295 \u03bb1) \u00d7 \u03b4(b, f(x, y)\u2295 \u03bb2).\nA generalization of Lemma 1 ensures the input-output correlation obtained from an N-OTP-box to be NS whenever p(\u03bb2) = \u2211 \u03bb1\np(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) = 1/2. Note that N-OTP-boxes reduce to the corresponding OTP-boxes when p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) = 1 2\u03b4(\u03bb1, \u03bb2), i.e., the variables \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are perfectly correlated. In the absence of perfect correlation between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, an N-OTP-box can be interpreted as follows: output at Bob\u2019s end is f(x, y) but encrypted by the key \u03bb2, i.e. f(x, y) \u2295 \u03bb2. However, unlike the perfect case, the output at Alice\u2019s end (\u03bb1) is not exactly the key to Bob\u2019s encrypted output but correlated to it. Consequently, Bob cannot perfectly decrypt the value of f(x, y). As shown in the following result (proof provided in the Appendix) this noisy box leads to the construction of the OTP model for non-extremal NS correlations.\nTheorem 2. All isotropic 2, 2-input & 2, 2-output NS correlations allow an N-OTP model.\nAs the basic tenets of the OTP model framework are developed and the model is generalized to some extent, we now move on to showcase the benefits of this model in explaining and understanding some of the striking features of non-local correlations.\nCollapse of communication complexity: Nonlocal correlations can significantly reduce the communication complexity of distributed computing [30]. Given an m-bit string x to Alice and an n-bit string y to Bob, any arbitrary binary function f(x, y) : {0, 1}m \u00d7 {0, 1}n 7\u2192 {0, 1} can be computed by Bob with just 1-bit of communication from Alice to Bob provided they have access to nonlocal correlations. But how can this be possible!? How can a task requiring m-bit of communication be perfectly done with a 1-bit channel when assisted with nonlocal correlations, which are otherwise NS? Is there a simple, intuitive way to explain this phenomenon?\nThe OTP model framework offers an innate explanation for this puzzle. Let as a resource Alice and Bob are given an OTP-box where g(x) = 0 and f(x, y) = f(x, y). From Lemma 1, this simply means that they are given the appropriate NS correlation. Alice and Bob input x and y in their respective parts of the box. According to the symmetric encryption scheme of the OTP-box, Bob\u2019s output is the encrypted version of the function f(x, y), i.e., b = f(x, y)\u2295 \u03bb,\nwhereas Alice output is the key a = \u03bb. This solves the puzzle as to how Alice and Bob can compute a function that requires communication of m-bit with just 1-bit of communication and a NS box. The information of x reaches Bob\u2019s end through superluminal signaling at the hidden variable level. The output of the box is, however, encrypted and hence useless to Bob. But Alice has the key! Alice now sends the key (\u03bb) through a 1-bit communication channel, which allows Bob to decrypt the value of the function f(x, y), irrespective of the length of the string x. In summary, we can say that the key is used by the agents to unlock the power of superluminal signaling at the hidden variable (ontic) level.\nVan Dam protocol: In the earlier section, we have seen that an arbitrary binary function f(x, y) : {0, 1}m \u00d7 {0, 1}n 7\u2192 {0, 1} can be computed by Bob with just 1-bit of communication from Alice provided the communication line is assisted with an appropriate m,n-input & 2, 2-output nonlocal correlation. Win van Dam has shown that the same goal can be achieved with 1-bit communication and 2, 2-input & 2, 2-output PR box, if many copies of the PR box is preshared between Alice and Bob [28]. This is quite surprising when compared with quantum correlations. Quantum entanglement is known to reduce the amount of classical information that Alice and Bob need to exchange to evaluate certain distributed functions [41], whereas for other functions entanglement provides no advantage. An example of latter is the Inner Product function IPn : {0, 1}n \u00d7 {0, 1}n 7\u2192 {0, 1}, which is defined as IPn(x, y) := \u2295ni=1xi \u00b7 yi [42]. Van Dam\u2019s proof that PR correlation makes communication complexity vacuous goes in two steps \u2013 Step-I: all possible distributed functions can be expressed in a way that coincides with the inner product problem for two parties, and Step-II: with PR correlations the IP problem (and hence all problems) can be solved with 1-bit of communication from Alice to Bob [28]. At this point we recall a cryptographic concept called homomorphic encryption [43]. Homomorphic encryption allows performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it and hence without compromising the security of the data. Our next result (proof provided in Appendix) provides a new outlook of Van Dam protocol from a homomorphic encryption point of view. Proposition 1. The Van Dam protocol for distributed computing of arbitrary binary functions with trivial communication complexity can be understood as an application of the homomorphic nature of OTP encryption with respect to XOR operation.\nCasting Van Dam\u2019s protocol as homomorphic encryption thus provides a better understating of distributed computations with nonlocal correlation. Accordingly, the puzzling feature of the breakdown of communication complexity with PR box can be better appreciated in the OTP framework. In the same line, a few more relatively immediate observations are in order. Observation 1. Employing homomorphic encryption, it turns out that all the OTP boxes resulting in NS correlation can be\n4 simulated by PR boxes. Observation 2. All 2-output NS correlations can be simulated with PR boxes and shared randomness. Moreover, the number of PR boxes required grows linearly with the number of inputs at Bob\u2019s end. The principle of Information Causality: While nonlocality in PR correlation is quite strong, making communication complexity trivial, nonlocality in quantum theory is docile enough to ensure \u2018nontrivial communication complexity\u2019 [29]. Lately, a novel principle called Information Causality (IC) was proposed, which can capture this limited nonlocality of quantum theory and can identify post-quantum nonlocal correlations. IC limits Bob\u2019s information gain about a previously unknown to him dataset of Alice to be at most m bits when Alice communicates m classical bits to Bob, and he is allowed to use local resources that might be correlated with Alice [31]. A necessary condition of IC can be obtained by considering random access code (RAC) task [44\u201346], where Alice receives a random string x \u2208 {0, 1}n, and Bob randomly aims to guess yth bit xy of Alice\u2019s string. In the presence of an NS correlation, if Alice communicates m-cbits to Bob, then according to IC the efficiency of the aforesaid task is upper bounded by In \u2264 m, where In := \u2211n k=1 I(xk = \u03b2|y = k). Here, I(xk = \u03b2|y = k) denotes Shannon\u2019s mutual information between the kth bit of Alice, and Bob\u2019s guess \u03b2. Interestingly, IC reproduces the Cirel\u2019son bound [27], i.e., any nonlocal correlation yielding Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) [15] value more than 2 \u221a 2 violates IC.\nA natural question is: how is this limited nonlocal feature of quantum correlation captured in our OTP model framework? Nonlocality, in our model, is achieved by a careful interplay between ontic-level signaling and randomness. Consequently, limited nonlocality can be accounted for in two ways: (i) either messing around with the randomness, which boils down to noisy encryption, or (ii) reducing the amount of ontic-level signaling. We will examine both these approaches in reproducing quantum correlations, particularly focusing on the class of isotropic correlations.\n(i) Quantum correlations as noisy encryption: As shown in Theorem 2, isotropic correlations in 2, 2-input & 2, 2-output scenario allow an N-OTP model. As motivated in the definition of the N-OTP box, the limited non-locality found in nature can be explained through noisy encryption. More precisely, we can interpret it as follows: there is a well-defined value of the encryption key \u03bb within the box, but nature is \u2018peculiar\u2019 in such a way that it does not provide perfect access to the key to the agent outside the box (in this case Alice). The key \u03bb\u2032 accessed by Alice is not identical to the key \u03bb within the box; rather, they are correlated. A simple calculation ensures that the necessary condition of IC is satisfied when the mutual information between the true key \u03bb and the obtained key \u03bb\u2032 is upper bounded by 0.5 bit. Although this could be a way of obtaining quantum-realizable nonlocal correlation, the approach might look rather arbitrary and ad hoc.\n(ii) Quantum correlations through limited ontic-level signalling: A more natural approach to explain limited nonlo-\ncality would be to limit the extent of instantaneous signaling at the ontic level. After all, the idea of instantaneous signaling itself sounds far too radical. Let us try to come to terms with it by making it less powerful. For this, we may model the instantaneous communication within the box as a classical binary bit-flip channel, with flipping probability (1 \u2212 \u00b5). The remainder of the OTP-box remains the same. In this case, the input-output correlation obtained by the agents outside the box reads as: P (ab|xy) = \u00b5 12 [ \u2211 \u03bb \u03b4(a, \u03bb)\u03b4(b, xy \u2295 \u03bb)] +\n(1\u2212\u00b5) 12 [ \u2211\n\u03bb \u03b4(a, \u03bb)\u03b4(b, (x\u2295 1)y\u2295 \u03bb)]. We can now use the standard RAC protocol to verify that OTP boxes of this kind always violate the IC principle, except when \u00b5 = 0.5, corresponding to no communication at all. In other words, perfect encryption, with noisy ontic-level signaling, violates IC. By perfect encryption, we mean that Alice has perfect access to the key that is used to encrypt the function f(x, y) at Bob\u2019s end.\nDiscussions.\u2013 In summary, we have constructed a hidden variable model for nonlocal correlations. From a foundational point of view, our model is analogous to the De Broglie-Bohm model that allows instantaneous signaling at the hidden variable/ontic level. Interestingly by introducing suitable randomness in the distribution of the ontic variables, the model becomes NS at the operational level. In other words, the model displays an elegant interplay between ontic-level signaling and randomness, i.e., distribution of the ontic variable. Randomness essentially solves the tension between ontic-level signaling and the operational NS principle by \u2018toning down\u2019 the power of ontic-level signaling at the operational level. From a cryptographic point of view, our model can also be seen as a symmetric key encryption system called One Time Pads. This, in turn, helps us to explain the breakdown of communication complexity with PR correlation and provides a better understanding of Van Dam\u2019s protocol in terms of homomorphic encryption. As it turns out, the ontic variables in our model play the role of the encryption key, and the randomness in its distribution is designed in such a way that one can, nevertheless, unlock some power of the ontic-level signaling, leading to an advantage in nonlocal computation. In addition to its foundational implication, this shows an instance of the utility of the connection we presented between encryption and nonlocal boxes. We further believe that the results in classical cryptography can be used to greatly improve our understanding of nonlocal correlations and also in designing new protocols that can exploit this nonlocality. We also discussed possible ways of obtaining the limited nonlocal behavior of quantum correlations within this cryptographic ontic model framework. As it turns out, by making the ontic-level signaling noisy, one cannot recover quantum correlations. This suggests that within the OTP framework, noisy encryption is necessary for quantum realisability. That is, the randomness at Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s end cannot be highly correlated. This is an added constraint imposed on the randomness by IC, in addition to the \u2018uniform marginals\u2019 constraint imposed by NS.\nApart from trivializing communication complexity, postquantum nonlocal correlations are also known to exhibit some\n5 other exotic features. For instance, in the zero-error communication scenario where the aim is to transmit messages through this channel with no probability of confusion [47], the assistance of quantum entanglement can improve the zero-error classical capacity of a noisy channel [48, 49]. However, in assistance with entanglement, it is not possible to send a message without any confusion if the channel has no unassisted capacity, which otherwise will imply a violation of causality! Quite strikingly, there exist NS correlations that can yield positive zero-error capacity even for channels with no unassisted capacity [50]. An OTP model explanation might provide a better understanding of this phenomenon. Another esoteric problem where we expect this model to provide insights into is nonlocality distillation [51\u201353]. Similar to the wellunderstood problem of entanglement distillation, the task of nonlocality distillation is to create a highly nonlocal box, starting from a number of weakly nonlocal boxes. We believe that the existing literature on cryptography over noisy channels can provide insights into nonlocality distillation when one thinks of nonlocal quantum correlations as OTP-boxes with noisy encryption. Finally, we note that this connection between nonlocality and cryptography is not only limited to OTP encryption, and therefore, qualitatively different encryption schemes may also add to our understanding of nonlocality.\nAcknowledgments: We gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with Mir Alimuddin, Ananya Chakraborty, Snehasish Roy Chowdhury, Guruprasad Kar, Amit Mukherjee, Sahil Gopalkrishna Naik, Ram Krishna Patra, and Samrat Sen.

For our purposes, only two main observations suffice: (i) all the entries of a full-output vertex are either \u20180\u2019 or \u20181/2\u2019; (ii) for a full-output vertex, Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s outputs are either strictly correlated or strictly anti-correlated.

            "text": "Proof. The simplest example of homomorphic encryption is the OTP encryption, which is homomorphic with respect to modular addition, i.e., it is additively homomorphic. For instance, consider the (encrypted data, key) pairs (e = z\u2295\u03bb, \u03bb) and (e\u2032 = z\u2032 \u2295 \u03bb\u2032, \u03bb\u2032). XOR-ing operation on the encrypted data and the key yields: (e\u2295 e\u2032 = z \u2295 \u03bb\u2295 z\u2032 \u2295 \u03bb\u2032, \u03bb\u2295 \u03bb\u2032) \u2261 (e\u2295e\u2032 = (z\u2295z\u2032)\u2295(\u03bb\u2295\u03bb\u2032), \u03bb\u2295\u03bb\u2032). Thus, post-computation, the new key decrypts the new encrypted data. In other words, it is possible to perform modular addition of the data without decrypting it first.\nComing to think of it, this is precisely what happens in Van Dam\u2019s protocol. In the distributed computing scenario Van Dam considered, Alice is given some string x \u2208 X \u2261 {0, 1}m and Bob is given another string y \u2208 Y \u2261 {0, 1}n. Their task is to compute some arbitrary binary function f(x, y) that is apriori known to the players. Let us now express Van Dam\u2019s protocol in the OTP-box model. For every possible yi \u2208 Y \u2261 {0, 1}n, Alice inputs f(x, yi) into a PR box, and thus requiring a total of |Y | = 2n PR boxes. Bob, on the other hand, inputs \u20181\u2019 into the ythdec PR box, where ydec is the decimal representation of the binary string \u2018y\u2019. Bob inputs \u20180\u2019 into all the remaining PR boxes. Modeled as an OTP box, the outputs at Bob\u2019s end are the encrypted information f(x, yi)\u03b4(i, ydec)\u2295\u03bbi. Here, \u03b4(i, ydec) is Bob\u2019s input into the ith PR box. Now, note that \u2295if(x, yi)\u03b4(i, ydec) = f(x, y). Thus, if Bob can decrypt the output of each PR box, Bob can compute f(x, y). But this requires Alice to send each \u03bbi to Bob. Fortunately, the additive-homomorphism of OTP encryption comes to the rescue!! Bob knows that OTP encryption is homomorphic with respect to XOR-ing operation. He thus blindly XORs all the encrypted bits to obtain the bit \u2295i(f(x, yi)\u03b4(i, ydec) \u2295 \u03bbi) = (\u2295if(x, yi)\u03b4(i, ydec)) \u2295 (\u2295i\u03bbi) = f(x, y) \u2295 (\u2295i\u03bbi). Meanwhile, Alice computes the new key \u03bb = \u2295i\u03bbi and sends this bit to Bob. The homomorphism then allows Bob to decrypt the value of the function f(x, y).\nAPPENDIX-E: IC AND N-OTP MODEL\n(i) Quantum Correlations from noisy encryption: Isotropic correlations, expressed as an N-OTP box, has the form:\nP (ab|xy) = \u2211 \u03bb1,\u03bb2 \u03b4(a, \u03bb1) \u03b4(b, xy \u2295 \u03bb2) p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2),\nwhere p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) has uniform marginals, and consequently we have p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) = 12p(\u03bb2|\u03bb1) = 1 2 (\u00b5\u03b4(\u03bb1, \u03bb2) + (1 \u2212 \u00b5)\u03b4(\u03bb1, \u03bb2)), with \u00b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. Let us use this correlation as an assistance to the c-bit communication line from Alice to\nBob to play 2 7\u2192 1 RAC task, where Bob wishes to perfectly guess one of the two bits of the string x0x1 given to Alice. Following the standard RAC protocol, Alice inputs x0 \u2295 x1 into her end of the box. The output at Alice\u2019s end is a = \u03bb1 and she communicates a \u2295 x0 = \u03bb1 \u2295 x0 over to Bob. Bob inputs y \u2208 {0, 1} into his end of the box if he want\u2019s to know the (y + 1)th bit of Alice. Bob receives the output b = (x0 \u2295 x1)y \u2295 \u03bb2 from the box and accordingly guesses z = b\u2295 (x0 \u2295 \u03bb1) = (x0 \u2295 x1)y \u2295 \u03bb2 \u2295 x0 \u2295 \u03bb1 = x0y \u2295 x1y \u2295 \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb2. It is clear that whenever \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are perfectly correlated, Bob can perfectly guess both bits of Alice\u2019s string, which implies a violation of the IC principle. Now we have\nP (x0, z|y = 0) = \u2211 P (x0, x1, z, \u03bb1, \u03bb2|y = 0)\n= \u2211 P (z|x0, x1, \u03bb1, \u03bb2, y = 0)P (x0, x1, \u03bb1, \u03bb2|y = 0)\n= \u2211 \u03b4(z, x0 \u2295 \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb2)P (x0, \u03bb1, \u03bb2|y = 0)\n= 1\n2\n\u2211 \u03b4(z, x0 \u2295 \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb2)p(\u03bb1, \u03bb2)\n= \u00b5\n2 \u03b4(z, x0) + 1\u2212 \u00b5 2 \u03b4(z, x0).\nAccordingly the Shannon entropy takes the form:\nH(X0, Z|Y = 0) = \u2212 \u2211 x0,z P (x0, z|y = 0) log(P (x0, z|y = 0)) = 1 + h(\u00b5),\nwhere, h(\u00b5) := \u2212\u00b5 log\u00b5\u2212(1\u2212\u00b5) log(1\u2212\u00b5). It is immediate that H(X0|Y = 0) = H(Z|Y = 0) = 1. Therefore, the mutual information is given as:\nI(X0 : Z|Y = 0) = H(X0|Y = 0) +H(Z|Y = 0) \u2212H(X0, Z|Y = 0) = 1\u2212 h(\u00b5).\nSame is the case when y = 1, and therefore, I2 = 2\u2212 2h(\u00b5). Now, IC is violated if I2 = 2 \u2212 2h(\u00b5) > 1. Thus, IC is violated if h(\u00b5) < 12 , corresponding to high correlation between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. Moreover, one can immediately show that I(\u03bb1 : \u03bb2) = 1 \u2212 h(\u00b5). Thus, in terms of mutual information between the two variables, IC will be violated if I(\u03bb1 : \u03bb2) > 1/2.\n(ii) Quantum correlations from noisy ontic-signalling: Here, the output correlations is given by\nP (ab|xy) = \u00b5 2 \u2211 \u03bb \u03b4(a, \u03bb)\u03b4(b, xy \u2295 \u03bb)\n+ 1\u2212 \u00b5 2 \u2211 \u03bb \u03b4(a, \u03bb)\u03b4(b, xy \u2295 \u03bb).\nUnlike earlier, the keys here are perfectly correlated, but the hidden variable communication c is noisy. Following the same protocol as before, one can see that Bob\u2019s output is given as z = cy \u2295 x0. Thus, it is immediate that whenever y = 0, the output z is fully correlated with x0. That is I(x0 : z|y = 0) =\n7 1. Now, when y = 1, the answer z equals x1 with probability \u00b5 and it will be wrong with probability 1\u2212 \u00b5. That is, I(x1 : z|y = 1) = 1 \u2212 h(\u00b5). Thus, we have I2 = 2 \u2212 h(\u00b5) >= 1 always violating IC principle, unless \u00b5 = 0.5.\n[1] J. S. Bell; On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox, Physics Physique Fizika 1, 195 (1964). [2] J.
