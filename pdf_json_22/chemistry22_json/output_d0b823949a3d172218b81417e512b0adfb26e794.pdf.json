Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been used as a first-line treatment for patients harboring with EGFR mutations in advanced NSCLC. Nevertheless, the drug resistance after continuous and long-term chemotherapies considerably limits its clinical efficacy. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop new chemotherapeutic agents and treatment strategies to conquer the drug resistance. FGFC1 (Fungi fibrinolytic compound 1), a type of bisindole alkaloid from a metabolite of the rare marine fungi Starchbotrys longispora. FG216, has exhibited excellent fibrinolytic and antiinflammatory activity. However, the potent efficacy of FGFC1 in human cancer therapy requires further study. Herein, we demonstrated that FGFC1 selectively suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells with EGFR mutation. Mechanistically, FGFC1 treatment significantly induced the apoptosis of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells H1975 in a dose-dependent manner, which was proved to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging ROS not only alleviated FGFC1-induced apoptosis but also relieved the decrease of phospho-Akt. We further confirmed that FGFC1 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of protein EGFR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in H1975 cells. Notably, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) could promote the accumulation of ROS and the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins induced by FGFC1. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that FGFC1 can inhibit EGFR and its downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through directly binding to EGFR, which displayed a much higher binding affinity to EGFRT790M/L858R than EGFRWT. Additionally, FGFC1 treatment also inhibited the migration and invasion of H1975 cells. Finally, FGFC1 effectively inhibited tumor growth in the nude mice xenograft model of NSCLC. Taken together, our results indicate that FGFC1 may be a potential candidate for erlotinib-resistant NSCLC therapy.\nKeywords: FGFC1, non-small cell lung cancer, erlotinib-resistant, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS, EGFR/PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway\nEdited by: Cyril Corbet,\nFonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS), Belgium\nReviewed by: Ruilong Sheng,\nUniversity of Madeira, Portugal Hou-Wen Lin, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China Pasquale Pisapia,\nUniversity of Naples Federico II, Italy\n*Correspondence: Wenhui Wu whwu@shou.edu.cn Ning Liu\nnliu@shou.edu.cn\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nPharmacology of Anti-Cancer Drugs, a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Pharmacology\nReceived: 25 August 2021 Accepted: 15 December 2021 Published: 19 January 2022\nCitation: Yan S, Zhang B, Feng J, Wu H, Duan N, Zhu Y, Zhao Y, Shen S, Zhang K, Wu W and Liu N (2022) FGFC1 Selectively Inhibits ErlotinibResistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer via Elevation of ROS Mediated by the\nEGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway.

            "text": "Lung cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the most common type of cancer accounts for about 80\u201385% of all lung cancer cases, which makes it a global health concern (Ke et al., 2015; Siegel et al., 2020). Compared with the steady improvement in survival rates for most other types of cancer, advances in treatments for NSCLC have made relatively little progress, and the 5-year survival rates of NSCLC patients remains less than 20% (Cheng et al., 2016).\nSomatic mutations of the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are major drivers of NSCLC development and are detected in approximately 30\u201365% of NSCLC patients in Asia (Paez et al., 2004). The most common mutations of the EGFR gene found in NSCLC are deletions in exon 19 and the L858R mutation in exon 21, resulting in activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways, such as phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has been proved to play an important role in the development, differentiation, survival and drug resistance of NSCLC (Wee and Wang, 2017). Thus, selective targeted EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely developed and used for the treatment of NSCLC (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), which has remarkable therapeutic effects against NSCLC patients with EGFRmutations. For example, firstgeneration EGFR-TKIs erlotinib (Minna and Dowell, 2005) and gefitinib (Cohen et al., 2003) showed an encouraging response rate to NSCLC with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations). Unfortunately, more than 80% of patients harboring EGFR mutation who initially respond to EGFR-TKI will gradually develop acquired resistance within about 1 year of treatment, mostly due to an additional mutation T790M in exon 20 of EGFR (Chan et al., 2006). Currently, numerous TKIs have been designed to directly target T790M mutant NSCLC cells, however, there is still a challenge for them to be used clinically owing to their poor selectivity or potential toxicity (Yang and Tam, 2018). Consequently, novel effective therapeutic agents that can overcome EGFR-TKI resistance should be identified and developed to treat NSCLC, which will ultimately prolong the overall survival time of NSCLC patients.\nAn essential step for killing resistant NSCLC is mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been proved to play a crucial role in the apoptotic cell death induced by anti-cancer agents (Joseph et al., 2017). Young et al. (2016) reported that Simvastatin can induce mitochondrial apoptosis to overcome gefitinib resistance with EGFR T790M mutation NSCLC cells. As well known, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation is closely related to the mitochondrial pathway, which is confirmed to be the cause and/or consequence of the mitochondrial dysfunction (Kim et al., 2021). High levels of ROS triggers oxidant stress, which leads to cellular damages, tumor progression, and chemotherapy resistance (Brozovic et al., 2010). Several studies have demonstrated that ROS triggers overoxidation of theMet residue of EGFRT790M with direct or indirect involvement in TKI-acquired resistance, and shuts down the EGFR downstream PI3K/Akt survival pathway (Paulsen et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2016).\nHowever, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can not only be mediated by ROS but also regulate ROS in turn to affect tumor growth. Zhang et al. (2021) have provided clear evidence that dieckol effectively inhibits the human OS MG-63 cells growth by triggering the ROS accumulation via down-regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2021). In addition, the hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling is usually associated with resistance to different targetedmediated therapies (Jabbarzadeh Kaboli et al., 2020). Based on the above, inhibiting the PI3K pathway could induce apoptosis and overcome resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFRmutant lung cancer cells (Donev et al., 2011; Gadgeel and Wozniak, 2013; Wang et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2021).\nUp to now, about 63% of the existent anti-tumor agents are natural products (Newman and Cragg, 2016). Recently, marine natural products (MNPs) have been valuable sources for novel drug discovery due to their unique chemical diversity and excellent biological activity (Khalifa et al., 2019). As reported in our previous studies, we obtained a series of MNPs FGFC1, FGFC2, FGFC3, and FGFC4 from a metabolite of the rare marine fungi Starchbotrys longispora. FG216 (Wang et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016). Among them, FGFC1{Fungi fibrinolytic compound (R)-2,5-bis((2R,3R)-2-((E)-4,8-dimethylnona-3,7-dien-1-yl)-3,5dihydroxy-2-methyl-7-oxo-3,4,7,9-tetrahydropyrano[2,3-e] isoindol-8(2H)-yl)pentanoic acid} (Figure 1A), has been shown to have fibrinolytic activity and anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo (Sawada et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018; Suzuki et al., 2018). However, its anti-cancer activity in NSCLC remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects and possible mechanisms of FGFC1 against erlotinib-resistant EGFRT790M/L858R-driven NSCLC. We found that FGFC1 selectively exhibited significant anti-cancer effects on erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells in vitro and reduced their tumorigenicity in vivo. FGFC1 induced H1975 apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and cumulatively elevated levels of intracellular ROS. These therapeutic efficacies were associated with the binding ability of FGFC1 to EGFRT790M/L858R and inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signaling pathway, which was important for driving tumorigenesis of NSCLC and TKI resistance. Collectively, our results provide new possibilities that FGFC1 can be used as a lead compound for the treatment of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation and L858R activating mutation."

Figure 1C summarized the IC50 values of FGFC1 in the 5 cell lines. Compared with the normal cell line and other three cancer cell lines, PC9 was the most sensitive to FGFC1 with an IC50 value of 7.45 \u00b1 0.57 \u03bcM.Whereas, HCT116, HeLa, B16, and 293T were relatively less sensitive with IC50 values of 182.94 \u00b1 12.03 \u03bcM, 134.21 \u00b1 9.82 \u03bcM, 132.98 \u00b1 10.74 \u03bcM, and 138.44 \u00b1 10.05 \u03bcM, respectively.

As shown in Figure 1D, the morphological observation of cells exhibited that the space between PC9 cells was significantly increased and their appearance had evidently changed. Exposure to a low concentration FGFC1, the pseudopodia of PC9 cells extended and the shape was elongated from the epithelial shape to the spindle shape. The cell morphology visibly changed, and the number of viable cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner. However, barely any morphological changes were observed in other cell lines, indicating that FGFC1 selectively induced PC9 cell death.

Interestingly, FGFC1 exhibited substantially stronger cytotoxicity in erlotinib-resistant H1975 cells (IC50 9.22 \u00b1\n0.84 \u03bcM) than A549 (IC50 116.79 \u00b1 9.47 \u03bcM), H1299 (IC50 109.51 \u00b1 8.69 \u03bcM), and BEAS-2B (134.45 \u00b1 12.32 \u03bcM) (Figures 1E,F). When exposed to FGFC1, as observed in PC9 cells, H1975 cells also showed significant morphological alterations under a phase-contrast microscope. The viable cell numbers decreased in a dose-dependent manner as well. On the other hand, no remarkable changes were seen in EGFR wild type cells including A549, H1299 and BEAS-2B cells (Figure 1G). In addition, we also found that FGFC1 treatment remarkably increased the LDH leakage of H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner (100.67, 145.68, 198.51, and 321.96% following 48 h treatment with FGFC1, respectively), not in A549 and H1299 cells (Figure 1H). Furthermore, we examined the effect of FGFC1 on cell colony formation. The results from experimental colony formation assays indicated that FGFC1 was able to reduce the number and size of the colonies of H1975 cells in a dosedependent manner compared with A549 cells (Figures 1I,J). Consequently, these results demonstrated that except for erlotinib-sensitive PC9 cells, FGFC1 could selectively inhibit the growth of erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells, which harbors L858R/T790M double mutation of EGFR. Due to T790M might be the most important mutation, leading to the development of TKI resistance (Rajappa et al., 2019), next we mainly evaluated the effects of FGFC1 on EGFRT790M mutant NSCLC cells."

As presented in Figure 2A, compared to the EGFR wild type\nFIGURE 7 | The proposed mechanism of the effect of FGFC1 on NSCLC cells.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 76469915\ncells A549 and H1299, the application of FGFC1 had a significant dose-dependent effect upon increasing the apoptotic proportion of H1975 cells. A distinct increase was observed in the percentage of H1975 apoptotic cells (4.35, 11.28, 17.14, and 29.8% following 48 h treatment with FGFC1, respectively) (Figure 2B). In addition, the expression levels of apoptosis-related protein PARP, caspase 3, Bax, and Bcl-2 from these cells were examined by immunoblotting analysis. Our results suggested that FGFC1 dose-dependent promoted the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, PARP, and Bax, while it markedly dosedependent inhibited the expression levels of Bcl-2. (Figures 2C,D). In contrast, limited effects were observed in EGFR wild type A549 and H1299 cells, which confirmed the selective inhibitory effects of FGFC1 on apoptosis in H1975 cells. These results clearly suggested that FGFC1 effectively induced erlotinibresistant H1975 cell death by promoting their apoptosis.\nFGFC1 Enhanced Mitochondrial Dysfunction and ROS Generation to Induce Apoptosis in H1975 Erlotinib-Resistant NSCLC Cells Considering the pivotal role of mitochondria in orchestrating the apoptotic pathway, we investigated the effect of FGFC1 on the MMP. The decrease of MMP was a detection index in the early phase of apoptosis and indicated mitochondrial dysfunction. Reduced red fluorescence and increased green fluorescence were regarded as the MMP collapsed. As shown in Figure 3A, compared with EGFR wild type A549 and H1299 cells, FGFC1 induced a significant loss of MMP in H1975 cells in a dosedependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence results confirmed that H1975 cells treated with FGFC1 displayed a clear shift in JC1 staining of the mitochondria from red to green in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3B). Moreover, FGFC1 incubation could dose-dependently increase the protein level of cytochrome C in H1975 cells (Supplementary Figure 1). These results signified that FGFC1 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction in H1975 erlotinib-resistant cells. Next, we examined the changes of cellular ROS levels in the above cell lines. As expected, the ROS levels were increased dose dependently after FGFC1 treatment in H1975 cells (13.2, 23.8, 39.7, and 50.3%, respectively) compared with control A549 and H1299 cells. (Figures 3C,D). Additionally, excessive intracellular ROS can deplete cellular GSH (Rahman et al., 2019). Figure 3E showed that FGFC1 indeed reduced the GSH content in H1975 cells dose dependently (100, 77.8, 52.37, and 32.67% following 24 h treatment with FGFC1, respectively), whereas the GSH depletion was not significantly observed in A549 and H1299 cells. Finally, to determine the role of ROS in FGFC1-treated cellular apoptosis, we pre-incubated NSCLC cells with the ROS scavenger NAC to demonstrate the effect of FGFC1 treatment and determine whether NAC could attenuate apoptosis induced by FGFC1. The result of flow cytometry showed that NAC significantly inhibited the accumulation of ROS induced by FGFC1 in H1975 cells (Figures 3F,G). Bcl-2, Bax, cleavedcaspase 3, and PARP protein expression were detected by western blot assay. As shown in Figures 3H,I, suppression\neffects on Bcl-2 and the apoptotic effects (indicated by the levels of cleaved-caspase 3, PARP, and Bax) were attenuated in the NAC and FGFC1 combined treatment group compared with the FGFC1 treatment alone group. Additionally, our western blot analysis also revealed that FGFC1 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, which has been proved to be suppressed by ROS (Palanivel et al., 2014). And this phosphorylation suppression effect was attenuated in the NAC and FGFC1 combined treatment group (Figures 3H,I), which indicated that FGFC1 might trigger anti-proliferation effect via Akt signaling pathway. Consequently, we concluded that FGFC1treatment-induced cell apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production in NSCLC cells, and Akt signaling was involved in this process."

Firstly, cells were treated either with FGFC1 or erlotinib for 24 h. As shown in Figures 4A,B, FGFC1 dosedependently suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in H1975 cells, while the levels of total EGFR, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR remained unaltered. Meanwhile, as a parallel control, we also examined the protein levels of these phosphorylation kinases in A549 and H1299 cells, but no evident inhibition was observed. As expected, erlotinib significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in PC9 cells, whereas there is no obvious effect in H1975 cells (Figures 4C,D). Furthermore, we used an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, LY294002, in order to determine whether or not FGFC1 was able to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. H1975 cells were exposed to FGFC1 and LY294002 alone or in combination for 24 h. The results clarified that co-treatment with FGFC1 and LY294002 has significantly suppressed Bcl-2 and the phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR than with either drug alone group. Conversely, a significant increase in the expression of cleaved-caspase 3, cleavedPARP, and Bax protein was observed in the combination treatment group (Figures 4E,F). Meanwhile, we also evaluated the levels of ROS in H1975 cells after treatment with FGFC1 and LY294002 alone or in combination for 24 h. As presented in Figures 4G,H, compared with the FGFC1 or LY294002 treatment alone group, the accumulation of ROS was significantly increased in the FGFC1 and LY294002 combined treatment group. Collectively, LY294002 markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of FGFC1 on the phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and increased FGFC1-induced ROS generation and cell apoptosis.

As shown in Figure 5A, the wound-healing assay showed that FGFC1 significantly suppressed the migration capacity of H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 5A,C). While at the same concentration gradient, FGFC1 exhibited a slight inhibition in A549 and H1299.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "EGFR mutations result in the activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways, which contribute to the progression of many human cancers, including lung cancer (Hsieh et al., 2013). Overexpression of EGFR exists in more than 45% of NSCLC cases, which has been considered as a predictor of low survival rate and poor outcome of NSCLC patients. In recent years, a series of TKIs targeting EGFR have been developed and approved for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. Unfortunately, the progression of cancer resulting from acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is a critical obstacle in the treatment with NSCLC.\nTherefore, identification and development of novel drugs targeting EGFR T790M with good curative effects and limited side effects have great clinical significance. In the present study, we provided evidence for the first time that FGFC1 possessed selective anti-cancer activity against EGFR-mutant PC9 and H1975 NSCLC cells. It is known that H1975 cells harbor the L858R-activating and T790M resistant mutations of EGFR and are erlotinib-resistant. Subsequently, we revealed the inhibitory effect mechanism of FGFC1 on H1975 NSCLC cells both in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that FGFC1 was a potential target molecule for overcoming T790M resistance.\nInhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells is a critical aspect while determining the approaches to treat cancer (Wang et al., 2018). In this study, we investigated the effects of FGFC1 on different cancer cell lines, including lung cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, and normal renal epithelial cells. CCK-8 assay demonstrated that FGFC1 revealed a selective cytotoxic effect on NSCLC cells PC9, it was relatively safe for normal renal epithelial cells 293T and other cancer cells (Figures 1B\u2013D). This data indicated that FGFC1 exerted certain selectivity to NSCLC with EGFR mutations. Thus, we further explored the effects of FGFC1 on various NSCLC cells with different EGFR status. In addition to PC9, a surprising finding was discovered. FGFC1 also exerted significantly inhibitory effect on erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells proliferation, while only slightly inhibitory effect on EGFR wild type cells A549 and H1299 (Figures 1E\u2013H).\nSince cell apoptosis is an importantmechanism in the induction of cell death, we subsequently elucidated cellular apoptosis after FGFC1 treatment. We examined whether FGFC1 could induce cell apoptosis of erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, using EGFR wild-type cell lines (A549 and H1299) as a parallel control. Annexin V and PI staining revealed that compared with control cells, FGFC1\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 76469917\nselectively induced apoptosis in H1975 erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells (Figures 2A,B). Consistent with these results, we clarified that the FGFC1 treatment can significantly promote the expression levels of cleaved-PARP, cleaved-caspase-3, and Bax, whereas induced a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl-2 (Figures 2C,D). Thus, our results indicated that FGFC1 could selectively kill the erlotinibresistant H1975 NSCLC cells.\nThe mitochondrion is an important organelle involved in cell death (Green and Kroemer, 2004), and it is also a central processor in the processes of energy metabolism, cell signal transduction, and apoptosis regulation (Li et al., 2021). When apoptosis of cells was induced by external factors, a decrease in MMP causes apoptotic factors to release from mitochondria into the cytosol, which further triggers caspase-dependent or caspaseindependent apoptotic pathways. Many studies have displayed that triggering mitochondria-mediated apoptosis becomes an available method for therapy of resistant cancer. In addition, mitochondria dysfunction could cause the generation of intracellular ROS (Kim et al., 2021), which is confirmed to be involved in the drug resistance related to EGFR and its downstream pathway (Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Excessive ROS produced by external stimuli was not conducive to the survival of cells, thus causing the accumulation of ROS and cell apoptosis (Yuan et al., 2019). Moreover, previous reports have corroborated that ROS played an important role in regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, which is highly associated with migration, Invasion, and tumorigenesis. Chen et al. (2019) have reported that Glutathione Peroxidase 1 could induce the drug-resistant NSCLC apoptosis through ROS-mediated PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway. Wu et al. (2020) have demonstrated that tormentic acid could induce anti-cancer effects in cisplatinresistant cervical cancer via ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway. Additionally, it also has been proved that chemical-induced ROS generation was mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Ji et al. (2019) have indicated that 2\u2032,4\u2032-Dihydroxy-6\u2032-methoxy-3\u2032,5\u2032dimethylchalcone-induced ROS generation causing cell apoptosis was via suppression PI3K/Akt pathway. Yen et al. (2012) have clarified that Arsenic-induced cell apoptosis was regulated by PI3K/ Akt pathway-mediated ROS. Herein, we showed that FGFC1 induced the dysfunction of mitochondrial, leading to the accumulation of intracellular ROS and GSH depletion in H1975 cells (Figures 3A\u2013E). Moreover, NAC preconditioning could alleviate FGFC1-induced ROS accumulation and block the upregulation of intrinsic pro-apoptotic proteins induced by FGFC1, suggesting that FGFC1 triggered apoptosis of erlotinibresistant H1975 NSCLC cells via inducing the mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation (Figures 3F\u2013I). Additionally, given the close relationship between ROS and PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhang and Yang, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2021), thenwe researched the effect of FGFC1 on this pathway. The results showed that FGFC1 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, whereas NAC indeed alleviated the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation induced by FGFC1 (Figure 3H), demonstrating that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway might be involved in the FGFC1-induced cell apoptosis.\nThe PI3K/Akt signaling, an important pathway downstream of EGFR, has been demonstrated that aberrant activation of it could promote TKI resistance in NSCLC (Toulany and\nRodemann, 2015). Therefore, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway might overcome TKI resistance effectively. Here, we showed that FGFC1 could selectively inhibit the expressions of p-EGFR, p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR in erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells (Figures 4A,B). The LY294002 and FGFC1 combined treatment group was found to have aggravated the accumulation of ROS and cell apoptosis through enhancing the inhibitory effects of FGFC1 on the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (Figures 4E\u2013H). The data clarified that FGFC1 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells via negative regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of ROS accumulation regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway still need to be further studied. To identify the direct target of FGFC1, we subsequently conducted molecular modeling and found that FGFC1 had a great potential to target EGFRT790M/L858R (Figures 4I,J). In addition, tumor metastasis is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths, accounting for 90% of deaths (Pritchard et al., 2011; Zeeshan and Mutahir, 2017). Studies have reported that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation was associated with enhanced invasive and migratory in NSCLC (Fu et al., 2015; P\u00e9rez-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2015). Our data verified that FGFC1 could remarkably inhibit the migratory and invasive abilities of H1975 cells, selectively (Figure 5).\nFinally, we assessed the anti-cancer effects of FGFC1 in vivo. Erlotinib has been used as the first-line TKIs in NSCLC clinical treatments. As parallel control, we compared the anti-cancer effects of the FGFC1 and erlotinib by reduced tumor weight and size when the tumor-bearing animals were treated with them. To our satisfaction, FGFC1 had no significant toxicity effect on mice body weight and tissue histology. FGFC1 (10 mg/kg) showed more potent anti-cancer properties in suppressing H1975 solid tumors compared with vehicle (5% DMSO in PBS) or erlotinib (10 mg/kg) groups, which was consistent with studies in vitro (Figure 6). Additionally, immunohistochemical results of study in vivo further confirmed that FGFC1 suppressed erlotinibresistant NSCLC xenograft tumor growth through decreasing p-EGFR and Ki67 expression.\nBased on our present results, we have proposed an outline of FGFC1 anti-cancer mechanism in Figure 7. Our overall results demonstrated that FGFC1 could effectively interact with mutated EGFR and consequently selectively kill erlotinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, FGFC1 can efficiently inhibit the cell viability by leading mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of ROS in vivo, and down-regulation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, FGFC1 might be an effective anticancer candidate in the clinical settings of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC. The preliminary molecular mechanism of FGFC1 on the erlotinib-resistant NSCLC was revealed and provided a sound rationale for future investigation in the clinical setting."
