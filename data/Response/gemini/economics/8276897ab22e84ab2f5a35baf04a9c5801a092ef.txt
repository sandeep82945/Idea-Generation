1. **Investigate the impact of the dual household registration system on the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The paper suggests that the dual household registration system, which restricts the movement of rural residents to urban areas, may be a contributing factor to the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization. Future research could explore this relationship in more detail, examining how the system affects the flow of people and land between rural and urban areas.
2. **Examine the role of the dual land system in the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The paper also suggests that the dual land system, which gives the state ownership of urban land and collective ownership of rural land, may be a contributing factor to the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization. Future research could explore this relationship in more detail, examining how the system affects the availability and affordability of land for urban development.
3. **Analyze the impact of the asymmetrical tax distribution system between financial rights and administrative rights on the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The paper suggests that the asymmetrical tax distribution system, which gives local governments more responsibility for providing public services than they have revenue to fund, may be a contributing factor to the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization. Future research could explore this relationship in more detail, examining how the system affects the ability of local governments to invest in infrastructure and other public services that are essential for urban development.
4. **Develop policy recommendations to address the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The paper concludes by suggesting that the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Future research could develop policy recommendations to address this problem, such as reforming the dual household registration system, the dual land system, and the asymmetrical tax distribution system.
5. **Conduct a comparative study of the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China and other countries.** The paper focuses on the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China. Future research could conduct a comparative study of this imbalance in China and other countries, examining the similarities and differences in the causes and consequences of the imbalance.
