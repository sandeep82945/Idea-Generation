On the other hand, only a strong investment in quality control measures allows the production of WSIs adequate for precision diagnosis. These two effects, connecting reciprocally the digital transformation and quality, can be understood as two sides of the same coin, increasing (or decreasing) in parallel. It is never enough to emphasize that both quality and efficiency, with full respect by turnaround time, are the main contributors to the reputation of the pathologist.\nDifficulties related to the unavailability of disruptive laboratory instruments or laboratory information systems dedicated to the modern tissue processing represent one of the major obstacles to the digital transformation. Industry leaders in pathology instruments and software are key players in the success of the global digital transformation. The frequent stagnation in the investment on updated instruments that occur in some institutions and the consistent low value attributed to pathology departments do not wield a stimulation effect in industry regarding breakthroughs. It is easy to understand that this circle of low investment tends to deaccelerate evolution in pathology, a tendency that may be disrupted by each institution supported by adequate reimbursement policies.\nOther factors that may contribute to the failure of digital transformation are easy to anticipate. The digital transformation depends on financial resources, requires informatic expertise to its implementation, and, importantly, requires persistent action, from both pathologists and laboratory technicians. Making the beginning of the digital transformation to depend only on the scanner acquisition and/or informatic support is to postpone the adoption. The digital transformation is a laborious and time-consuming process that requires pathologists to adjust together with laboratory technicians, the most efficient and automatized design of each workstation (accessioning, macroscopy station, embedding, cutting, staining, coverslipping, scanning, reporting, complementary techniques, and others) as well as establishing the digital storage design and policy according to the local regulations. Working together with laboratory technicians at the bench has become a strange task to many pathologists. Pathology has evolved based on the growing complexity of the diagnostic process that dominates the scene, asphyxiating the interest on the immutable technical environment. An active approximation of the pathologist to the laboratory life is not easily substituted by the intervention of other groups that will contribute to other steps of the global process of transformation (informatic experts, molecular biologists, managers, others). So, admitting the possibility of available funds for the digital transformation, the solution is still not at hand for all institutions if we keep in mind that world-wide pathology is suffering from workforce shortage.\nThe optimism associated with the usage of computational pathology tools, namely artificial intelligence (AI),\nis growing among pathologists [9]. Generated in-house or commercially available, computational pathology tools have the promise to decrease the pathologist\u2019s workload, to facilitate the execution of repetitive tasks such as identification and quantification, and to predict outcomes, among other announced benefits. These seductive AI tools may be used in WSI files and have been adopted by some pathology laboratories prior to the digital transformation. It is not unusual to encounter a scenario where only the glass slides to be evaluated by AI are scanned. These selected glass slides are often prepared as the remaining ones in the daily routine, without any special quality stress. Nevertheless, the performance of AI tools is heavily dependent on the quality of the WSI, and the quality of the respective glass slides as well. Poor quality WSIs may introduce serious bias into the output of the AI tools [10]. Other practical factors related with AI tools usage such as difficulties in integration with the laboratory information system, sustained validation procedures, decisions on the reporting of conflicting data, and long-term preservation of records may intensify the improper usage of this technology. Ultimately, the adoption of computational pathology tools without a previous solid digital transformation is an unacceptable short cut that denies the possibility to elevate pathology into another stage and to definitely postpone evolution of pathology.\nHere is presented the ultimate challenge to pathology evolution that needs to be embraced by all of us, as part of a cohesive and responsible community, that purges for the best patient care.\nAuthor contribution CE own opinion paper.\nFunding Open access funding provided by FCT|FCCN (b-on).
