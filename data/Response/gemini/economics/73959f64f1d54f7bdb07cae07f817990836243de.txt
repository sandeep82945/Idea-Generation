1. **Investigate the impact of EToU tariff on the overall electricity grid.** This could be done by simulating the EToU tariff on a large-scale power system model and analyzing the effects on factors such as peak demand, load factor, and system reliability.


2. **Develop new optimization algorithms for EToU tariff management.** The ACO and PSO algorithms used in this study are just two examples of optimization algorithms that can be applied to EToU tariff management. Other algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search, could also be explored.


3. **Investigate the potential for EToU tariff to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.** This could be done by analyzing the impact of EToU tariff on the demand for electricity from different sources, such as fossil fuels and renewable energy.


4. **Develop new methods for forecasting electricity demand under EToU tariff.** This is important for utilities to be able to accurately predict the demand for electricity and ensure that they have enough generation capacity to meet that demand.


5. **Investigate the potential for EToU tariff to be used in other countries.** The EToU tariff is currently used in Malaysia, but it could potentially be used in other countries as well. This would require research to determine the specific design of the EToU tariff that would be most effective in each country.
