Exploration of Other Proteolytic Enzymes for Lysozyme Modification: The study focused on pepsin and trypsin for the enzymatic modification of lysozyme. Future research could explore other proteolytic enzymes, such as papain or chymotrypsin, to compare their efficiency in releasing bioactive peptides from lysozyme. This could potentially identify enzymes that produce peptides with different or enhanced antibacterial, antioxidative, or other beneficial properties.

Structural and Functional Characterization of Isolated Bioactive Peptides: The bioactive peptides generated from lysozyme modification exhibit promising antibacterial and antioxidative activities. Detailed structural characterization of these peptides, using techniques such as mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, could help in understanding the relationship between their structure and function. This could lead to the design of peptides with optimized activities for specific applications in medicine, food preservation, and cosmetics.

Synergistic Effects with Other Antimicrobial Agents: Investigating the combined effect of modified lysozyme peptides with other antimicrobial agents could unveil synergistic properties that enhance the antibacterial activity against a broader spectrum of pathogens, including resistant strains. Such studies can lead to the development of more effective antimicrobial therapies and preservation methods.

Application in Food Preservation and Packaging: Given the enhanced antibacterial and antioxidative properties of the modified lysozyme, its application in food preservation and packaging deserves exploration. Research could focus on incorporating the modified lysozyme into edible films or coatings to extend the shelf life of perishable food items while maintaining their safety and quality.

Evaluation of In Vivo Efficacy and Safety: While the study demonstrated the in vitro antibacterial and antioxidative activities of the modified lysozyme, assessing its efficacy and safety in vivo is crucial for its application in healthcare and food industries. Future research could involve preclinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic potential, toxicity, and metabolism of the bioactive peptides in animal models, paving the way for clinical trials.
