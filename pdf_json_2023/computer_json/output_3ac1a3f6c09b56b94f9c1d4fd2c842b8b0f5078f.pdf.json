In the initial phase, a status quo survey was carried out among the consortium members, which shows which digital infrastructures are already in use and which functions are considered particularly important by the teachers. This paper shows the first results of the short survey via online questionnaire and discusses the challenges derived from it. Due to the non-homogeneous infrastructure and software use, there are neither the teaching-learning platform nor digital communication applications tools that are used equally by all six European higher education institutions. However, the consortium pursues the idea of specifying a limited tool pool order to strengthen the user experience and usability of teachers and students with different interdisciplinary backgrounds and digitalization expertise.",

This project\u2019s timeline is from 9/2020-8/2024 and six European higher education institutions from Austria, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Slovenia are participating. The project aims to address the challenge of demographic change in Europe by developing an interdisciplinary, compatible, and future-oriented master program within the framework of the European Approach for Quality Assurance of Joint Program (EQAR) [1]. Active aging aims to find new ways to engage older people in society before and even after retirement and thus enable them to continue to lead a meaningful life and even support economic, social, and natural sustainability [2]. An age-friendly society means creating environments that are truly age-friendly and inclusive and knows about the valuable contribution of older people to strengthen future human development. This requires action in many sectors: health, long-term care, transport, housing, labor, social protection, climate change, information, and communication as well as digital transformation, and many more [3].\nThe project\u2019s major challenge, among others, is to create a transnational online learning environment that is user-friendly for teachers and learners alike and contains all\n1 Corresponding Author: Daniela Elisabeth Str\u00f6ckl, Faculty of Engineering and IT, Carinthia University\nof Applied Sciences, Austria; E-mail: D.Stroeckl@fh-kaernten.at.\nbuilding."

Therefore, a user-centered development approach was chosen, which allows the active integration of needs and wishes of the future target group, at least on the teacher level. Thus, an initial online short questionnaire was developed to elicit these from the project partners. The participants had two weeks to complete the questionnaire to give the development team of the virtual learning platform initial indications for the development.\nTable 1 presents the entire online questionnaire. The six questions used as well as the selected answer options are based on the experience of the project team members."

            "text": "The survey was sent out to the six partner universities. For some universities, the responses were submitted at the personal level, while others discussed offline in advance and then submitted a collective \"opinion\". Responses: Karelia UAS: four returns, Carinthia UAS and University of Ljubljana: each three returns, University College Cork, University of Lisbon and Athens with each one returns.\nresponses as the same information was provided for the same institution (No.). For this reason, the results of these questions are also shown below in a normalized version (NNo.) in order to show the use of individual platforms in the correct relationship.\nIn Q02 most participants selected the use of the learning management platform Moodle (No. Selected 11, normalized No 3); both in the total number and in the normalized number (one selection per university). One person selects Canvas, and additionally, one participant indicated under \"Other\" that Moodle is not used directly but via a collaborative LTI connection. Nevertheless, Moodle is not used across the board in the participating European universities; platform technologies such as Canvas or Open Class are also used.\nThe answers of Q03 are shown in Table 2. The most important functions of a learning platform in the opinion of the questionnaire participants are that there is the possibility of easily sharing different learning materials, closely followed by an existing communication option. Reasons for this are seen above all in the fact that students have thereby a smaller inhibition threshold to communicate with their lecturers and fellow students - online team building possibility. The functions \"multimedia capability\" and \"evaluation\" were also frequently mentioned; on the one hand that multimedia content can be used more easily for teaching purposes or alternative teaching methods like flipped classroom and on the other that evaluation offers added value for students, particularly through meaningful feedback.\nResults of Q04 are shown in Table 3. Zoom is commonly in use and preferred by the survey participants because of easy use and functionality. MS Teams is often used\nplatform. A platform rarely used even with integration with Moodle as a feature was BigBlueButton. Options like GoToMeeting, Skype4Business, Zoho or Jitsi were not selected.\nIn Table 4 (Q05) the different key features lecturers prefer in the virtual classroom are mentioned. Key features most selected were file and screen sharing, breakout rooms to engage students easily and ease the online group discussions and work. For asynchronous or flipped classroom lecture types, recording is also necessary.\nThe last question QO6 was about the used plagiarism detection systems in the universities. Commonly used is the software Turnitin (No. 7, NNo. 4) but not every university uses it; the Urkund system is also used by two individual universities."

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "Based on the results of the online survey, it was found that even among the small cohort of universities, there is no uniform selection, especially at the level of the technologies used. The universities draw from the full range of digital possibilities and apply them. Even though the trend is generally moving strongly towards open-source applications in the public sector, also based on the Open Source Software Strategy 202-2023 of the European Commission [4], nothing of this could be detected in the survey. For example, the use of the various virtual meeting tools shows that Zoom or Microsoft Teams is clearly preferred by the teachers, since the operation and selection of functions is suitable for their teaching concepts. Conversely, this means that a common teaching and learning platform or a uniform concept in terms of the user-friendliness of the Joint Online Master will also raise the question of costs for licenses and usage rights. What does not emerge from the survey, however, is the prior experience of using other technologies. Thus, there could be a bias in favor of familiar tools in which people feel confident enough to use for teaching. In addition, some universities have clear guidelines about which tools and platforms can and cannot be used in teaching, which makes it difficult to work together and find a common tool pool.\ngamification seem to play no or only a very minor role in teaching so far. It could be further surveyed whether e.g. game-based online offers are not considered useful or applicable or whether it is rather a matter of barriers and fears regarding the development and application of such methods. It should also be critically noted that the online survey has a very limited view of the instructors especially in the questions about personal preferences and does not consider the students' wishes at all. In this phase, important parameters for teaching and learning design such as user experience, learning experience or joy of use could not be surveyed. However, since this is only a survey of initial tendencies in the consortium, the development team considered this to be sufficient or to provide the initial basis for concept proposals and subsequent discussions."

            "heading": "5. Conclusions",
            "text": "The first information regarding the landscape of digital teaching and learning platforms of the partner universities clearly shows that there is a non-homogeneous structure. This means that the development of a uniform tool usage strategy is made more difficult, or compromise solutions must be used. In EMMA the partners decided to go with a singlehost structure and if needed to connect the other systems via LTI methodology. [5]\nIn any case, this survey shows only initial trends in its extent. Subsequent surveys\nwith teachers and students, especially due to their interdisciplinary backgrounds, of the partner universities are needed in order to design and build an applicable and enjoyable teaching and learning platform. These conclusions will feed into the e-MeBe (eWellbeing and Mental Health in Older Adults) project, also funded by Erasmus+. In this project, which started at the end of 2022, the questionnaire will be extended and deepened and likewise the opinion of the students will be added in order to not only survey the technical infrastructure of the teaching and learning platform, but to enable and create an innovative concept of learning experience."
