    "abstractText": "Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused significant economic damage and forced a slew of limitations to be placed by regulatory bodies worldwide. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus continuously mutates over time, it\u2019s crucial to understand how well the vaccines are effective against a new variant. Objectives To measure COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against ICU admission with the Omicron variant in Saudi Arabia regions. Methods and materials A retrospective cohort study was conducted of vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals who tested positive during Omicron dominant period (Jan 1, 2020Jun 11, 2022). We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar time to assess the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness while controlling for age and gender. Results A total of 14103 individuals who were divided into fully vaccinated included 8388 (59.5%) individuals, partially vaccinated included 1851 (13.5%) individuals, and un-vaccinated included 3864 (27.4%) individuals. Higher age was associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.04). Three doses are associated with a lower risk of ICU admission compared to the single dose (HR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.20). By studying the distribution of Omicron infection among different regions, Al-Madinah Al-Monawarah had the highest proportion at 60.23 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 57.05, 63.53). In contrast, Al-jouf had the lowest proportion at 4.51 per 100,000 population (95%CI: 2.891, 6.713). The vaccination status was significantly different in different regions, as the highest proportion of fully vaccinated participants inhabited in Tabouk region, with 71.8% of its cases. Out of all regions, Najran had the highest proportion of ICU admission among Omicron cases with 20% (95% CI: 9.94%, 34.22%). While the lowest rates existed in Riyadh with 0.86% (95%CI: 0.61%, 1.17%). Conclusion We found that a booster significantly enhanced protection against severe COVID-19. The partially vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were at significantly higher risk of ICU admission when compared to the fully vaccinated participants. Furthermore, in future, it is worth investigating the effectiveness of a booster when other potential factors (e.g., region, comorbidities, etc.) are included, particularly among future variants of COVID-19.",

We used a Cox proportional hazards model based on calendar time to assess the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness while controlling for age and gender.\nResults A total of 14103 individuals who were divided into fully vaccinated included 8388 (59.5%) individuals, partially vaccinated included 1851 (13.5%) individuals, and un-vaccinated included 3864 (27.4%) individuals. Higher age was associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.04). Three doses are associated with a lower risk of ICU admission compared to the single dose (HR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.20). By studying the distribution of Omicron infection among different regions, Al-Madinah Al-Monawarah had the highest proportion at 60.23 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 57.05, 63.53). In contrast, Al-jouf had the lowest proportion at 4.51 per 100,000 population (95%CI: 2.891, 6.713). The vaccination status was significantly different in different regions, as the highest proportion of fully vaccinated participants inhabited in Tabouk region, with 71.8% of its cases. Out of all regions, Najran had the highest proportion of ICU admission among Omicron cases with 20% (95% CI: 9.94%, 34.22%). While the lowest rates existed in Riyadh with 0.86% (95%CI: 0.61%, 1.17%).\nConclusion We found that a booster significantly enhanced protection against severe COVID-19. The partially vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were at significantly higher risk of ICU admission when compared to the fully vaccinated participants. Furthermore, in future, it is worth investigating the effectiveness of a booster when other potential factors (e.g., region, comorbidities, etc.) are included, particularly among future variants of COVID-19.\nKeywords Covid-19, ICU admission, Omicron variant, Vaccines\n*Correspondence: Shaymah Aldawish shima.daweesh@gmail.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Despite the numerous government interventions, the emergence of the Omicron variant created a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID19, more than had been reported with all other variants [1]. On November 9, 2021, Omicron (B.1.1.529) was discovered for the first time in South Africa. It was immediately designated as the fifth variant of concern (VOC). Omicron has a large number of mutations in the spike region, and the appearance of this variant poses a great challenge worldwide because of its high transmission rate and number of mutations [2\u20134].\nThe current COVID-19 vaccines were made from an ancestral SARSCoV-2 virus strain. There are considerable concerns about the protective effect of these currently available vaccines against the Omicron variant that is antigenicity distinct from its ancestor virus. According to laboratory data, vaccinated individuals had a significantly reduced neutralizing antibody response to the Omicron variant compared to the original Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, although the booster increased the response to the Omicron variant [5\u20138]. Early laboratory findings suggest that the original vaccines have a lower vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the Omicron variant infection, as the level of neutralizing antibodies is correlated with the protection against reinfection and with the effectiveness of the vaccine [9, 10].\nStudies conducted on the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine showed that primary immunization with two doses of either vaccine has limited protection against infection and symptomatic disease in individuals infected with the Omicron variant. However, after initial vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccine or BNT162b2 vaccine, administration of a booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine has been shown to provide some protection, but this protection has decreased over time [11, 12]. Additionally, assessing VE against omicron hospitalization has become more challenging due to the attenuated intrinsic severity and its high prevalence of infection [13].\nPrevious findings found that there is a reduction in VE of two doses of mRNA vaccines, including mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer), against infection with BA.1 omicron subvariant compared with earlier VOCs12. However, another study shows that the VE of three doses against hospitalization with BA.1 was initially higher, but its waned quickly. Of concern, the VE of BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariant was found to be decreased compared to BA.1 subvariant [14\u201317].\nIn December 2020, Saudi Arabia approved BNT162b2 (Pfizer) as the country\u2019s first vaccine. Saudi Arabia later approved the ChAdox1 nCoV-19 of the\nOxford-AstraZeneca in February 2021 [18]. Since the approval of these vaccines happened on short notice and happened speedily to prevent the spread of new COVID19 variants, there is an inherent need to research the efficiency of different vaccines continuously and whether they can still be effectively used against the other variants. A published study found VE was lower against Omicron infection symptoms than Delta. The effectiveness declined by 36% after two months of the second dose and then turned to 1% after six months of the second dose. However, the booster dose increased the effectiveness to 61% after seven days [19].\nClinical studies in Saudi Arabia described therapy and admission in intensive care units, clinical features, and the epidemiology of COVID-19 [20\u201322]. Most of these studies were conducted earlier, leaving clear research gaps in other waves and the emergence of the Omicron variant [23, 24].\nSome researchers have shown that \u201cthe available seroprevalence of COVID-19 studies indicate pockets of infection among the certain population and certain provinces\u201d in Saudi Arabia [25]. Overall, findings from this research will help healthcare officials to detect strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement in the equitable distribution of vaccines, training competency for the vaccination program, and overcoming obstacles that prevent the effective administration of vaccines.\nThis research aims to investigate the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines against ICU hospitalization during the Omicron Surge in Saudi Arabia."

            "text": "The BA.1 subvariant of Omicron was responsible for the initial Omicron outbreaks around the world. However, BA.1 has been quickly replaced by BA.2 within months,\nand later by BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4/5). As of early September 2023, the subvariants of Omicron are circulating, including EG.5, XBB.1.5, and XBB.1.16, and are considered the dominant nationwide. Subsequently, these characteristics of Omicron affect how it spreads and responds to treatments and vaccinations [28\u201330].\nIn early December 2021, the first case of Omicron was reported in Saudi Arabia with a highly transmissible nature and risk of immune evasion. However, since the beginning of COVID-19 in early March 2020, the government in Saudi Arabia implemented a comprehensive response to prevent the pandemic surge involving travel restrictions, lockdowns of schools and universities, and suspension of attendance, followed by a complete curfew. Moreover, the Umrah was suspended, and the booking of Hajj was restricted to local COVID-19 recovered cases [31\u201333].\nWe conducted a cohort study including 14,103 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 living in KSA, aiming to estimate the distribution of Omicron variant in different regions of Saudi Arabia and to determine the effectiveness of different types of vaccines with the Omicron variant. In\nthe current study, 59.48% were fully vaccinated (> 7\u00a0days after of two or more doses), 13.12% were partially vaccinated (> 14\u00a0 days after first dose through day 7 after second dose), and 27.40% were unvaccinated (days from cohort entry until receipt of first vaccine dose) [26]. Unvaccinated individuals were significantly younger than the vaccinated and partially vaccinated population with p < 0.001, as well the largest proportion of the unvaccinated group were non-Saudi with p < 0.001.\nThe high coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among the Saudi population is translated to the effort of the government in implementing a ranged distribution plan for vaccination targeting the largest size of the population of each city, prioritizing cities of high population as the\ncapital Riyadh, followed by Jeddah, Dammam, Madinah, and Makkah. [34].\nIn the present study, simple and multiple logistic regression is used to study the association between vaccination status and ICU admission while controlling for age and gender. In unvaccinated participants were 2.7 times higher of being admitted to the ICU compared to the fully vaccinated participants. This is in line with a study published recently they found hospitalization rates were 10.5 times higher in unvaccinated persons and 2.5 times higher in vaccinated persons with no booster dose [35]. However, some studies found the protection against Omicron depends on the type of vaccine, in a large cohort research in Singapore involving over 2.5 million people aged 30 or older. These data demonstrate that booster mRNA vaccine protection against severe COVID-19 was persistent over six months independent of vaccine combination, and 3-dose of inactivated vaccine type gave more protection than 2-dose but less protection than 3-dose mRNA [36].\nAlso, Cox regression is conducted to see the effect of number of doses on ICU admission while adjusted for\nStatistical significance at P value < 0.05"

Similar results have been observed in previous literature they found those under 40\u00a0 years old represent a small proportion of the total number of most severe COVID-19 cases in Europe [37]. Our finding found that there is no difference between males and females in regard to ICU admission. In contrast, an early finding revealed that men are more at risk for a worse outcome [38].\nAt the same time, the risk of admission to the ICU is decreased with a higher number of doses. This analysis shows that the booster and two doses effectively reduce the risk of ICU admission due to Omicron infection, compared to one dose by 91% and 43%, respectively. This finding is similar to the Qatari study, they found that booster is effective by 76.5% (95% CI, 55.9%-87.5%) against Omicron-related hospitalization and death [16].\nWe also studied the distribution of the Omicron variant across different regions of Saudi Arabia. The first conducted study for Omicron-infected patients was in a single medical center in Saudi Arabia. This was achieved by AlBahrani et\u00a0 al., showing that the rate of hospitalization (14%) was lower than previously reported in the first and second wave of COVID-19. Nonetheless, the hospitalization rate was inversely correlated with the number of vaccination doses with least admission (5.4%) among fully vaccinated patients. They reported a rate of ICU admission 3.5% and 2% mechanical ventilation rate [1].\nIn the current study, the vaccination status was significantly different in different regions as the highest\nproportion of fully vaccinated participants inhabited Tabouk with 71.8% followed by Asir region with 64% then the Eastern region with 62.8% of its population.\nRegarding Omicron infection, Al-Madinah Al-Monawarah had the highest number of cases followed by Riyadh region, then Makkah Al-Mokarramah region. It is worth mentioning that during the study period (Jan 2022- Jun 2022), Saudi Arabia has lifted all COVID-19 restrictions on Hajj and Umrah for local and international pilgrims. The announcement was made after the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah released Ramadan 2022 Operational Plan of the two holy mosques [39]. This might explain the highest number of cases, especially in Al-Madinah and Makkah.\nThe disparity in ICU among regions may include several factors; the literature indicates the association between socio-demographic factors and variations in COVID-19 outcomes. Likewise, many studies have reported the relationship between comorbidities and severe COVID-19 [40\u201342]. For example, the fact that Najran had the highest rate of ICU admission could relate to advanced age and comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), cardiovascular disease, and obesity, which was discussed previously in a national study [43]. Whereas demographics factors and comorbidities are related to regional variation, other factors, such as disparities in income, access to healthcare resources, education levels, and overall population health, are associated with the COVID-19 outcome in different regions [44\u201346]."

            "text": "One of the limitations in this study is the data was only limited to the samples received by PHA as a part of surveillance. Also, the assessment of differences in behavior or adherence to the COVID-19 precautions are unaccounted among vaccination groups in this study. For example, those who were unvaccinated may be less likely to wear a mask or take precautions. So, this could either lead to overestimation or underestimation. However, this limitation is minimized because of the high willingness and rate of vaccination in Saudi Arabia.\nTo eliminate confounders, we adjusted for age and sex, but we did not account for other factors that may have influenced the outcomes, such as comorbidity, obesity, smoking and occupation. However, given the study\u2019s observational nature, residual confounding remains possible despite adjustment for several potential confounders.\nWe did not estimate the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness against death, symptomatic infections or organ injury because we assessed only patients who have been admitted to ICU."
