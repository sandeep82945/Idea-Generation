We are interested in the linear Boltzmann equation:\n(1.1)\n{ h\u2202tu+ v \u00b7 h\u2202xu\u2212 \u2202xV \u00b7 h\u2202vu+QH(h, u) = 0 u|t=0 = u0\nin a semiclassical framework (i.e in the limit h\u2192 0), where h is a semiclassical parameter and corresponds to the temperature of the system. Here we denoted for shortness \u2202x and \u2202v the partial gradients with respect to x and v. This equation is used to model the evolution of a system of charged particles in a gas on which acts an electrical force associated to the real valued potential V that only depends on the space variable x. The interactions between the particles are modelled by the linear operator QH which is called collision operator. Here the unknown is the function u : R+ \u2192 L1(R2d) giving the probability\n1\ndensity of the system of particles at time t \u2208 R+, position x \u2208 Rd and velocity v \u2208 Rd. For our purpose, we introduce the square roots of the usual Maxwellian distributions\n\u00b5h(v) = e\u2212\nv2 4h\n(2\u03c0h)d/4 and Mh = e\u2212 V 2h\u00b5h.(1.2)\nIn many models, we have\nQH(h,M2h) = 0 and Q\u2217H(h, 1) = 0(1.3) so in particular M2h is a stable state of (1.1). In order to do a perturbative study of the time independent operator near M2h, we introduce the natural Hilbert space\nH = { u \u2208 D\u2032 ; M\u22121h u \u2208 L2(R2d) } .\nIt is clear from the Cauchy Schwarz inequality that H is indeed a subset of L1(R2d) provided that e\u2212\nV 2h \u2208 L2(Rdx). In view of (1.3) and the definition of H, it is more convenient to work with the new\nunknown f = M\u22121h u : R+ \u2192 L2(R2d) for which the new equation becomes\n(1.4)\n{ h\u2202tf + v \u00b7 h\u2202xf \u2212 \u2202xV \u00b7 h\u2202vf +Qh(f) = 0 f|t=0 = f0\nwhere Qh = M\u22121h \u25e6QH(h, \u00b7) \u25e6Mh. Our study will be focused on the new time independent operator\nPh = v \u00b7 h\u2202x \u2212 \u2202xV \u00b7 h\u2202v +Qh = Xh0 +Qh\nfor some specific choices of the collision operator Qh, where the notation X h 0 will stand for the operator v \u00b7 h\u2202x \u2212 \u2202xV \u00b7 h\u2202v, but also for the vector field (x, v) 7\u2192 h(v,\u2212\u2202xV (x)). There are plenty of different collision operators studied in the literature, their main properties being that these are symmetric integral operators acting as multiplicators in the position variable x and canceling the Maxwellian distribution. Our work is in particular motivated by the study of the mild relaxation operator introduced in [19] and given by H0(1 +H0) \u22121 with H0 the harmonic oscillator in velocity defined by\nH0 = \u2212h2\u2206v + v2 4 \u2212 hd 2 .(1.5)\nIn this spirit, the collision operators we will be working with will always be bounded and self-adjoint so, (Xh0 , C\u221ec (R2d)) being essentially skew-adjoint, the operator Ph (endowed with the appropriate domain) is maximal accretive and (1.4) is well-posed. More generally, some interesting cases of collision operators are given by functions of H0 (see for instance [9, 13\u201315,19]) which is the setting that we will adopt.\nThis paper is concerned with the spectral study of the operator Ph. This type of questions has recently known some major progress on the impulse of microlocal methods. In the case of the linear Boltzmann equation (1.4), the use of hypocoercive techniques in 2015 in [20] enabled to get some resolvent estimates and establish a rough localization of the small spectrum of Ph which consists of exponentially small eigenvalues in correspondance with the minima of the potential V . This type of result is similar to the one obtained for example for the Witten Laplacian by Helffer and Sjo\u0308strand in [7] in the 1980\u2019s. Such a localization already leads to return to equilibrium and metastability results which can be improved as the description of the small spectrum becomes more precise. For example, sharp asymptotics of the small eigenvalues of the Witten Laplacian were obtained later in the 2000\u2019s in [2] and [6] and later again for Kramers-Fokker-Planck type operators by He\u0301rau et al. in [10]. In these papers, the idea was to exhibit a supersymmetric structure for the operator and then study both the derivative acting from 0-forms into 1-forms and its adjoint with the help of basic quasimodes. In [19], Robbe managed to show that the\nBoltzmann equation (1.4) with mild relaxation enjoys such a supersymmetric structure. However, in that case, the matrix appearing in the modification of the inner product does not obey good estimates with respect to the semiclassical parameter h. This is why our goal here will be to give precise spectral asymptotics for the operator Ph through a more recent approach which consists in directly constructing a family of accurate quasimodes for our operator in the spirit of [12] and [1].\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. In a first time, we want to prove a result similar to the one obtained by Robbe in [20] but for a large class of collision operators. The second goal is to provide complete asymptotics of the small eigenvalues of Ph as it was done in [6] for the Witten Laplacian or in [10, 11] with recent improvements by Bony et al. in [1] in the case of Fokker-Planck type differential operators. We manage to establish such results for the equation (1.4) for a class of pseudo-differential collision operators presenting nice symbol properties as well as a factorized structure.\n1.2. Setting and main results. For d\u2032 \u2208 N\u2217 and Z \u2208 Cd\u2032 , we use the standard notation \u3008Z\u3009 = (1 + |Z|2)1/2. In this paper, we will treat the case of collision operators of the form\nQh = \u033a(H0)\nwith \u033a satisfying the following:\nHypothesis 1.1. The function \u033a : R+ \u2192 R+ vanishes at the origin and for all t \u2265 0,\n\u033a(t) \u2265 1 C t \u3008t\u3009 .\nMoreover, it admits an analytic extension to {Re z > \u2212 1C } for which there exist \u033a\u221e \u2208 R+ and \u03b1 > 0 such that \u033a(z) = \u033a\u221e +O(\u3008z\u3009\u2212\u03b1).\nIn particular, Qh will be bounded uniformly in h and self-adjoint. An example of such collision operator is the mild relaxation operator introduced in [19] and given by H0(1 + H0)\n\u22121. In order to state the consequences of Hypothesis 1.1, let us introduce a few notations of semiclassical microlocal analysis which will be used in all this paper. These are mainly extracted from [21], chapter 4. We will denote \u039e \u2208 Rd\u2032 the dual variable of X and use the semiclassical Fourier transform Fh(f)(\u039e) = \u222b\nRd \u2032\ne\u2212 i hX\u00b7\u039ef(X) dX.\nWe consider the space of semiclassical symbols\nS\u03ba ( \u3008(X,\u039e)\u3009k ) = { ah \u2208 C\u221e(R2d \u2032 ) ; \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 N2d\u2032 , \u2203C\u03b1 > 0 such that |\u2202\u03b1ah(X,\u039e)| \u2264 C\u03b1h\u2212\u03ba|\u03b1|\u3008(X,\u039e)\u3009k }\nwhere k \u2208 R and \u03ba \u2208 [0, 1/2]. Note that those symbols are allowed to depend on h; however, in order to shorten the notations, we will drop the index h in the rest of the paper when dealing with semiclassical symbols. Given a symbol a \u2208 S\u03ba(\u3008(X,\u039e)\u3009k), we define the associated semiclassical pseudo-differential operator for the Weyl quantization acting on functions u \u2208 S(Rd\u2032) by\nOph(a)u(X) = (2\u03c0h) \u2212d\u2032 \u222b\nRd \u2032\n\u222b\nRd \u2032\ne i h (X\u2212X \u2032)\u00b7\u039ea (X +X \u2032 2 ,\u039e ) u(X \u2032) dX \u2032d\u039e\nwhere the integrals may have to be interpreted as oscillating integrals. We will denote \u03a8\u03ba(\u3008(X,\u039e)\u3009k) the set of such operators. In our setting, we will denote \u03be (resp. \u03b7) the dual variable of x (resp. v). We also need to introduce the notion of analytic symbols. For our purpose, we almost always consider symbols that do not depend on the variable \u03be.\nDefinition 1.2. For \u03c4 > 0, let us introduce the set\n\u03a3\u03c4 = {z \u2208 C ; |Im z| < \u03c4}d \u2282 Cd. For k \u2208 R, we denote S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) the space of symbols ah \u2208 S0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) independent of \u03be such that:\n(i) For all (x, v) \u2208 R2d, ah(x, v, \u00b7) is analytic on \u03a3\u03c4 (ii) For all \u03b2 \u2208 N2d, there exists C\u03b2 > 0 such that |\u2202\u03b2(x,v)ah| \u2264 C\u03b2\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009kon R2d \u00d7 \u03a3\u03c4 .\nWe will also use the notation ah = OS0\u03c4 (\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)(h N ) to say that for all \u03b1 \u2208 N3d, there exists C\u03b1,N such that |\u2202\u03b1ah| \u2264 C\u03b1,N hN \u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k on R2d \u00d7 \u03a3\u03c4 .\nHere again, we will drop the index h in the notations of analytic symbols. Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we see that item (i) from Definition 1.2 implies that for all \u03b2 \u2208 N2d and (x, v) \u2208 R2d, the functions \u2202\u03b2(x,v)a(x, v, \u00b7) are also analytic on \u03a3\u03c4 . Besides, the Cauchy formula implies that for any \u03c4\u0303 < \u03c4 , \u03b1 \u2208 Nd and \u03b2 \u2208 N2d, there exists C\u03b1,\u03b2 such that\n|\u2202\u03b1\u03b7 \u2202\u03b2(x,v)a| \u2264 C\u03b1,\u03b2\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k on R2d \u00d7 \u03a3\u03c4\u0303 i.e up to taking \u03c4 smaller, item (ii) from Definition 1.2 can be extended to \u03b2 \u2208 N3d. Let us introduce a slightly unusual notion of \u201dexpansion\u201d where the coefficients are allowed to depend on h: we will say that\na \u223ch \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjaj(1.6)\nin S0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) (resp. in S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k)) if (aj)j\u22650 \u2282 S0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) (resp. (aj)j\u22650 \u2282 S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k)) is a family of symbols which may depend on h and are such that for all N \u2208 N,\na\u2212 N\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nhjaj = OS0(\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)(h N )\n( resp. OS0\u03c4 (\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)(h N ) )\nFinally, we also have the usual notion of classical expansion for a symbol: a \u223c\u2211j\u22650 hjaj in S0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) (resp. in S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k)) means that a \u223ch \u2211 j\u22650 h jaj in S 0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) (resp. in S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k)) and the (aj)j\u22650 are independent of h. We now extend these notions to matrix valued symbols: if\nM = (mp,q) 1\u2264p\u2264n1 1\u2264q\u2264n2\nis a matrix of functions such that each mp,q \u2208 S\u03ba(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) (resp. mp,q \u2208 S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k)), we say that M \u2208 Mn1,n2 ( S\u03ba(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) ) ( resp. M \u2208 Mn1,n2 ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) )) and we denote\nOph(M) = ( Oph(mp,q) ) 1\u2264p\u2264n1 1\u2264q\u2264n2 .\nThe notation\nM = O Mn1,n2 ( S0(\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)\n)(hN ) ( resp. M = O\nMn1,n2 ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009 k) )(hN )\n)\nmeans that for all (p, q) \u2208 J1, n1K \u00d7 J1, n2K, the symbol mp,q is OS0(\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)(hN ) (resp. OS0\u03c4 (\u3008(x,v,\u03b7)\u3009k)(h N )). Furthermore, the notions of expansions M \u223ch \u2211 n\u22650 h nMn and M \u223c \u2211 n\u22650 h\nnMn in Mn1,n2 ( S0(\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) ) ( resp. Mn1,n2 ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(x, v, \u03b7)\u3009k) )) are straightforward adaptations of the ones for scalar symbols. These notions enable us to introduce a new class of collision operators which appears to be more general that the one given by Hypothesis 1.1. Let us denote bh the twisted derivative\nbh = h\u2202v + v/2(1.7)\nso that in particular with the notation (1.5) we have H0 = b \u2217 hbh.\nHypothesis 1.3. There exists \u03c4 > 0 and a symmetric matrix of analytic symbols\nMh(x, v, \u03b7) = ( mp,q(x, v, \u03b7) ) 1\u2264p,q\u2264d \u2208 Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) )\nsending R3d into Md(R) and such that, with the notation (1.7), the collision operator Qh satisfies a) Qh = b \u2217 h \u25e6Oph(Mh) \u25e6 bh\nb) Mh \u223c\u2211n\u22650 hnMn in Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) ) c) For all (x, v, \u03b7) \u2208 R3d, Mh(x, v, \u03b7) =Mh(x, v,\u2212\u03b7)\nd) For all (x, v, \u03b7) \u2208 R3d, M0(x, v, \u03b7) \u2265 1C \u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122 Id.\nSince the (Mn)n do not depend on h, we easily get that these matrices of symbols are also even in \u03b7, symmetric, independent of \u03be and with values in Md(R); so in particular item d) makes sense. This will enable us to establish Lemma 2.1 which is sometimes reffered to as microscopic coercivity (see for instance [5]). As announced, we have the following Lemma which is proven in Appendix A:\nLemma 1.4. Hypothesis 1.1 implies Hypothesis 1.3.\nWe will also make a few confining assumptions on the function V , assuring for instance that the bottom spectrum of the associated Witten Laplacian is discrete. In particular, our potential will satisfy Assumption 2 from [12] and Hypothesis 1.1 from [20].\nHypothesis 1.5. The potential V is a smooth Morse function depending only on the space variable x \u2208 Rd with values in R which is bounded from below and such that\n|\u2202xV (x)| \u2265 1\nC for |x| > C.\nMoreover, for all \u03b1 \u2208 Nd with |\u03b1| \u2265 2, there exists C\u03b1 such that |\u2202\u03b1xV | \u2264 C\u03b1. In particular, for every 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d, the set of critical points of index k of V that we denote U (k) is finite and we set\nn0 = #U (0).(1.8) Finally, we will suppose that n0 \u2265 2.\nThe last assumption comes from the fact that when n0 = 1, the so-called small spectrum of the operator Ph (i.e its eigenvalues with exponentially small modulus) is trivial, so there is nothing to study. It is shown in [16], Lemma 3.14 that for a function V satisfying Hypothesis 1.5, we have V (x) \u2265 |x|/C outside of a compact. In particular, under Hypothesis 1.5, it holds e\u2212V/2h \u2208 L2(Rdx). Moreover, in our setting, Xh0 is a smooth vector field whose differential is bounded on R\n2d, so the operator Xh0 endowed with the domain D = {u \u2208 L2(R2d) ; Xh0 u \u2208 L2(R2d)} is skew-adjoint on L2(R2d) and the set S(R2d) is a core for this operator. Therefore, (Ph, D)\u2217 = (\u2212Xh0 + Qh, D) and (Ph, D) is m-accretive on L\n2(R2d). We can now state our first result which consists in giving a rough localization of the small spectrum\nof Ph that we prove in Section 2.\nTheorem 1.6. Assume that Hypotheses 1.3 and 1.5 are satisfied and recall the notation (1.8). Then the operator (Ph, D) admits 0 as a simple eigenvalue. Moreover, there exists c > 0 and h0 > 0 such that for all 0 < h \u2264 h0, Spec(Ph) \u2229 {Re z \u2264 ch2} consists of exactly n0 eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity) that are exponentially small with respect to 1/h and for all 0 < c\u0303 \u2264 c, the resolvent estimate\n(Ph \u2212 z)\u22121 = O(h\u22122) holds uniformly in {Re z \u2264 ch2}\\B(0, c\u0303h2). Finally, except for 0, the real parts of these small eigenvalues are positive.\nThis result can be seen as a generalization of Theorem 3.0.2 from [19] (up to the h2 instead of h) as we saw that the mild relaxation operator (which is the collision operator studied in this reference) satisfies our hypotheses. In our case we get a localization of order h2 because we adopt a simpler proof based on hypocoercivity (inspired by [20]) than the one presented in [19].\nIn order to study the long time behavior of the solutions of (1.4), we need a precise description of the small spectrum of Ph. To this aim, we construct in Sections 3 and 4 in the spirit of the WKB method a family of accurate quasimodes localized around the minima of V that enables us to establish sharp\nasymptotics of the small eigenvalues of Ph. This leads in Section 5 to the following Theorem which is the main result of this paper. For the sake of simplicity, we make in the statement an additionnal assumption (Hypothesis 3.10) on the topology of the potential V that could actually be omitted (see [17] or [1]).\nTheorem 1.7. Suppose that Hypotheses 1.3, 1.5 and 3.10 are satisfied and denote m a global minimum of V . According to Theorem 1.6, we can associate to each m \u2208 U (0)\\{m} a non zero exponentially small eigenvalue of Ph that we denote \u03bb(m, h). These eigenvalues satisfy the following formula:\n\u03bb(m, h) = he\u22122 S(m) h det(HessmV )\n1/2\n2\u03c0 Bh(m)\nwith S defined in Definition 3.6 and Bh(m) admitting a classical expansion whose first term is \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2M0(s, 0, 0)\u03bds2 \u00b7 \u03bds2\nwhere the map j is also defined in Definition 3.6, the matrix M0(s, 0, 0) is introduced in Hypothesis 1.3 and the vector \u03bds2 \u2208 Rd is defined in Proposition 4.7.\nWhen Hypothesis 1.3 is replaced by Hypothesis 1.1, we can give a slightly more precise statement. In that case, denoting \u00b5s the only negative eigenvalue of HesssV , the first term of Bh(m) is\n1\n2\n\u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2 ( \u2212 \u033a\u2032(0) + \u221a \u033a\u2032(0)2 \u2212 4\u00b5s ) .\nIndeed, under Hypothesis 1.1, it is shown in Appendix A, more precisely in (A.13) that M0(s, 0, 0) = \u02dc\u033a(0) Id = \u033a\u2032(0) Id. Thanks to Proposition 4.7, we then have\nHesssV \u03bd2 = \u2212\u033a\u2032(0)2(1 + \u03bd22 )\u03bd22 \u03bd2 and consequently\n\u03bd22 = \u2212 1\n2 + \u221a \u033a\u2032(0)2 \u2212 4\u00b5s 2\u033a\u2032(0)\nso the statement follows. Finally, Section 6 consists in using the sharp localization obtained in Theorem 1.7 in order to discuss the phenomena of return to equilibrium and metastability for the solutions of (1.4). More precisely, we are able to give a sharp rate of convergence of the semigroup e\u2212tPh/h towards P1, the orthogonal projector on Ker Ph : denoting \u03bb\n\u2217 a non zero eigenvalue of Ph whose real part is minimal, we establish that the rate of return to equilibrium is essentially given by Re\u03bb\u2217/h:\nCorollary 1.8. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.7, there exists h0 > 0 such that for all 0 < h \u2264 h0, t \u2265 0 and N \u2265 1, there exists CN > 0 such that\n\u2016e\u2212tPh/h \u2212 P1\u2016 \u2264 CNe\u2212tRe\u03bb \u2217(1\u2212CNh N )/h.\nMoreover, if \u03bb\u2217 does not share its expansion given by Theoerm 1.7 with another eigenvalue of Ph (in particular it is a simple eigenvalue), then \u03bb\u2217 is real and we even have\n\u2016e\u2212tPh/h \u2212 P1\u2016 \u2264 Ce\u2212t\u03bb \u2217/h.\nBesides, in the spirit of [1], we also show the metastable behavior of the solutions of (1.4):\nCorollary 1.9. Suppose that the assumptions of Theorem 1.7 hold true. Let us consider some local minima m1 = m, m2, . . . , mK such that\nS ( U (0) ) = {+\u221e = S(m1) > S(m2) > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > S(mK)}\nfor the map S from Definition 3.6. For 2 \u2264 k \u2264 K, denote Pk the spectral projection associated to the eigenvalues that are O ( e\u22122 S(mk) h ) . Then for any times (t\u00b1k )1\u2264k\u2264K satisfying\nt\u2212K \u2265 h\u22121| ln(h\u221e)| and t\u2212k \u2265 | ln(h\u221e)|e2 S(mk+1) h for k = 1, . . . ,K \u2212 1\nas well as\nt+1 = +\u221e and t+k = O ( h\u221ee2 S(mk) h ) for k = 2, . . . ,K\none has e\u2212tPh/h = Pk +O(h \u221e) on [t\u2212k , t + k ].\nIn other words, we have shown the existence of timescales on which, during its convergence towards the global equilibrium, the solution of (1.4) will essentially visit the metastable spaces associated to the small eigenvalues of Ph.\nThe results presented in this paper should be reasonably easy to adapt to the case of collision operators satisfying Hypothesis 1.3 with the space S0 replaced by S\u03ba for \u03ba \u2208 [0, 1/2[ (we should get some expansions in powers of h1\u22122\u03ba instead of just h). Another perspective would then be to study the critical case \u03ba = 1/2 which should in particular cover the linear relaxation collision operator corresponding to the linear BGK model\nQh = h(1\u2212\u03a0h)(1.9) where \u03a0h denotes the orthogonal projection on Eh = \u00b5h L 2(Rdx)(1.10)\nand for which Robbe gave a first localization of the small spectrum of the associated operator Xh0 +Qh in [20].\n2. Rough description of the small spectrum\nThroughout the paper, we assume that Hypotheses 1.3 and 1.5 hold true. This implies in particular that Qh is bounded uniformly in h and self-adjoint in L\n2(R2d). Let us begin with a Lemma which consists in comparing our collision operator with the one introduced in (1.9) and studied in [20]. This will in particular enable us to use some computations from [20] later on.\nLemma 2.1. There exists h0 > 0 such that for all 0 < h < h0,\nQh \u2265 h\nC (1\u2212\u03a0h)\nwhere \u03a0h is the projection introduced in (1.9). In particular, Qh is non negative.\nProof. Since the space Eh defined in (1.10) is contained in KerQh, it is enough to prove that \u3008Qhu, u\u3009 \u2265 h C \u2016u\u20162 for u \u2208 E\u22a5h . Let u \u2208 E\u22a5h and recall the notations H0 and H1 from (1.5) and (A.4). Let us consider an approximate square root A of (1 +H1) given by\nA = Oph\n(( 1 + v2/4 + \u03b72 + h(1\u2212 d/2) )1/2 Id ) \u2208 \u03a80 ( \u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009 ) .\nBy symbolic calculus, we easily have A2 = 1 +H1 + h 2R1 with R1 \u2208 \u03a80 ( \u3008(v, \u03b7)\u30092 ) . Besides, the symbol of A is clearly elliptic so A is invertible and its inverse is also a pseudo-differential operator satisfying A\u22122 = (1 + H1) \u22121 + h2R2 with R2 \u2208 \u03a80 ( \u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122 ) (see for instance [4], chapter 8). Thus, using the factorization from Hypothesis 1.3 and the self-adjointness of A, we get\n\u3008Qhu, u\u3009 = \u2329 AOph(M h)AA\u22121bhu , A \u22121bhu \u232a .\nNow according to Hypothesis 1.3 and symbolic calculus again, the principal symbol of AOph(M h)A is elliptic so we can use the G\u030aarding inequality to write\n\u3008Qhu, u\u3009 \u2265 1\nC\n\u2329 A\u22122bhu , bhu \u232a\n\u2265 1 C\n\u2329 b\u2217h(1 +H1) \u22121bhu , u \u232a \u2212 h 2\nC\n\u2223\u2223\u2329b\u2217hR2 bhu , u \u232a\u2223\u2223.\nStill using symbolic calculus, we get b\u2217hR2 bh = O(1) so applying (A.5) we finally have\n\u3008Qhu, u\u3009 \u2265 1\nC\n\u2329 H0(1 +H0) \u22121u , u \u232a \u2212O(h2)\u2016u\u20162\nand the conclusion comes from the fact that the spectrum of H0(1+H0) \u22121|E\u22a5 h is contained in [h/C,+\u221e[.\nWe can already prove that 0 is a simple eigenvalue of (Ph, D) and that the other eigenvalues have positive real part. It is easy to check that Mh defined in (1.2) is in KerPh. Now let \u03bb \u2208 R and let us prove that for u \u2208 Ker (Ph\u2212 i\u03bb), one has u \u2208 CMh. Since Xh0 is skew-adjoint and Qh is self-adjoint and non-negative, we have\n0 = Re\u3008(Ph \u2212 i\u03bb)u, u\u3009 = \u2016Q1/2h u\u20162\nso in particular u \u2208 Ker Qh = Eh according to Lemma 2.1. Therefore, u = w\u00b5h with w \u2208 L2(Rdx) and using that \u00b5\u22121h X h 0 u = i\u03bbw does not depend on v, we get in the sense of distributions \u2202x(e\nV/2hw) = 0 which yields the desired result.\n2.1. Hypocoercivity. Let us now use the dilatation operators\nSh :    L2(R2d) \u2192 L2(R2d) u 7\u2192 h\u2212d/2u ( .\u221a\nh , .\u221a h\n) Th :    L2(Rdx) \u2192 L2(Rdx) u 7\u2192 h\u2212d/4u ( .\u221a\nh\n)\nthat were introduced in [20] in which these were combined with a scaling of \u03a0h to conjugate Ph to a nonsemiclassical operator with h-dependent potential. In our case, it will enable us to use some computations and results already established in [20].\nLemma 2.2. Denoting X0 = v \u00b7 \u2202x \u2212 \u2202xVh(x) \u00b7 \u2202v where Vh = h \u22121V ( \u221a h \u00b7),\nQ\u03031 = h \u22121S\u22121h QhSh\nand Dom(P ) = {u \u2208 L2(R2d) ; X0u \u2208 L2(R2d)}, P = X0 + Q\u03031, one has\n(hP , Dom(P )) = (S\u22121h PhSh , S \u22121 h D).\nMoreover,\n(hP , Dom(P ))\u2217 = (S\u22121h P \u2217 hSh , S \u22121 h D).\nProof. We have for u \u2208 L2(R2d) hX0u = S \u22121 h X h 0 Shu so using that Sh is bounded we get Dom (P ) = S \u22121 h D. Consequently,\n(hP , Dom(P )) = (S\u22121h PhSh , S \u22121 h D)\nand the result for the adjoint follows immediately.\nWe also recall the notations of the following differential operators from [9] and [20]:\na = \u2202x + \u2202xVh 2\n; b = \u2202v + v\n2 and \u039b2 = a\u2217a+ b\u2217b+ 1.\nThe operator (\u039b2, C\u221ec (R2d)) is essentially self-adjoint. The Schwartz space S(R2d) is included in the domain of its self-adjoint extension (\u039b2, D(\u039b2)) which is invertible. We can then define the operator L = \u039b\u22122a\u2217b, which is bounded uniformly in h (see [20], Lemma 2.7), as well as the perturbation h\u03b5(L+ L\u2217) = O(h) where \u03b5 > 0 will be chosen small enough later. Besides, notice that a\u2217a = \u2212\u2206x + |\u2202xVh|2/4 \u2212\u2206Vh/2 =: \u2206Vh/2 is the Witten Laplacian in x associated to the potential Vh/2 and that\n\u2206hV/2 := hTha \u2217aT\u22121h\n= \u2212h2\u2206x + |\u2202xV |2/4\u2212 h\u2206V/2\nis the semi-classicalWitten Laplacian associated to the potential V/2. The small spectrum of this operator was first studied by Helffer and Sjo\u0308strand in [7] and we now know that we can construct an orthonormal family (\u03d5j)1\u2264j\u2264n0 \u2282 C\u221ec (Rdx) of quasimodes associated to this operator given by\n\u03d5j = \u03c7je \u2212\nV \u2212V (xj)\n2h\nwhere xj is one of the local minima of V and \u03c7j is a cut-off function localizing around xj . Recall the notation \u00b5h from (1.2) and let us now define the families of functions\nghj = \u03d5j\u00b5h and gj = S \u22121 h g h j\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0. These are actually quasimodes for our operators Ph and P \u2217h :\nLemma 2.3. The family (ghj )1\u2264j\u2264n0 is orthonormal and there exists \u03b1 > 0 such that for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0,\nPhg h j = OL2(e \u2212\u03b1h ), P \u2217hg h j = OL2(e \u2212\u03b1h ).\nMoreover, Phg h j and P \u2217 hg h j are in S(R2d) \u2286 D and we have\nP \u2217hPhg h j = OL2(e \u2212\u03b1h ), PhP \u2217 hg h j = OL2(e \u2212\u03b1h ).\nProof. The proof is the same as the one of Lemma 2.4 from [20] since with the notation (1.10) and Lemma 2.1 we also have Eh = Ker Qh.\nOne of the key results of this section is that the real part of the perturbation of our operator is bounded from below on a subspace of finite codimension given by the orthogonal of the quasimodes:\nProposition 2.4. Denote N\u00b1h,\u03b5 the bounded self-adjoint operator Id \u00b1 \u03b5h(L + L\u2217). There exists \u03b5 > 0 and h0 > 0 such that for all h \u2208]0, h0] and u \u2208 S(R2d) \u2229 (gj)\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 , one has\nRe\u3008N+h,\u03b5Pu, u\u3009 \u2265 h\nC \u2016u\u20162\nas well as\nRe\u3008N\u2212h,\u03b5P \u2217u, u\u3009 \u2265 h\nC \u2016u\u20162.\nProof. One has for u \u2208 S(R2d), using the fact that X0 is skew-adjoint:\nRe\u3008N+h,\u03b5Pu, u\u3009 = Re\u3008Pu,N+h,\u03b5u\u3009 = Re\u3008Q\u03031u,N+h,\u03b5u\u3009+Re\u3008X0u,N+h,\u03b5u\u3009 = \u2016Q\u03031/21 u\u20162 + h\u03b5Re\u3008Q\u03031u, (L+ L\u2217)u\u3009+ h\u03b5Re\u3008X0u, (L+ L\u2217)u\u3009 = \u2016Q\u03031/21 u\u20162 + h\u03b5Re\u3008Q\u03031u, (L+ L\u2217)u\u3009+ h\u03b5Re\u3008[L,X0]u, u\u3009 = I + hII + hIII\nNote that if we replace P by P \u2217 and N+h,\u03b5 by N \u2212 h,\u03b5, we get I \u2212 hII + hIII. Besides, it is also proven in [20] that\n[L,X0] = A+ \u039b\u22122a\u2217a\nwhere A is also bounded uniformly in h. Since \u2016Qh\u2016 \u2264 C and Qh \u2265 hC (1\u2212\u03a0h) according to Lemma 2.1, we get \u2016Q\u03031\u2016 \u2264 Ch and Q\u03031 \u2265 1C (1\u2212\u03a01).

It only differs from Proposition 2.5 in [20] by a factor h in the estimate. This comes from the fact that in our case, Q\u03031 = O(h \u22121) and not O(1) (because Qh = O(1) and not O(h)) so we have to use a perturbation of order h (the operator N\u00b1h,\u03b5) to obtain the gain in \u2016(1 \u2212 \u03a01)u\u20162 in (2.1). As a consequence, the gain in \u2016\u03a01u\u20162 from (2.2) is of order h and not of order 1.\nCorollary 2.5. There exists c > 0 and h0 > 0 such that for all h \u2208]0, h0], u \u2208 D\u2229 (ghj )\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 and z \u2208 C uith Re z \u2264 ch2\n\u2016(Ph \u2212 z)u\u2016 \u2265 ch2\u2016u\u2016 and \u2016(P \u2217h \u2212 z)u\u2016 \u2265 ch2\u2016u\u2016.\nProof. Recall that N+h,\u03b5 = 1 + O(h). Hence, for u \u2208 D \u2229 (ghj )\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 , we have by putting u = Shw and using that Sh is unitary\n\u2016(Ph \u2212 z)u\u2016\u2016u\u2016 \u2265 1\n2 \u2016(Ph \u2212 z)u\u2016\u2016N+h,\u03b5w\u2016\n\u2265 1 2 Re\u3008(Ph \u2212 z)u, ShN+h,\u03b5w\u3009 = 1\n2 Re\u3008N+h,\u03b5(hP \u2212 z)w,w\u3009\n\u2265 h 2\nC \u2016u\u20162 \u2212 Re z\u2016N+h,\u03b5\u2016\u2016u\u20162\n\u2265 h 2\n2C \u2016u\u20162\nif Re z \u2264 h2/2C. The same proof holds when replacing P by P \u2217 and N+h,\u03b5 by N\u2212h,\u03b5.\n2.2. Resolvent estimates and first localization of the small eigenvalues. Using Lemma 2.3, it is clear that for u \u2208 Span ( (ghj )1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) and A \u2208 {Ph, P \u2217h , P \u2217hPh, PhP \u2217h} we have\n\u2016Au\u20162 = O(e\u2212 2\u03b1h )\u2016u\u20162. Now if we denote P the orthogonal projection on Span ( (ghj )1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) , we get by using Corollary 2.5 that for z \u2208 C such that Re z \u2264 ch2 and u \u2208 D \u2016(Ph \u2212 z)u\u20162 = \u2016(Ph \u2212 z)(Id\u2212 P)u+ (Ph \u2212 z)Pu\u20162\n= \u2016(Ph \u2212 z)(Id\u2212 P)u\u20162 + \u2016(Ph \u2212 z)Pu\u20162 + 2Re\u3008(Ph \u2212 z)(Id\u2212 P)u, (Ph \u2212 z)Pu\u3009 \u2265 c2h4\u2016(Id\u2212 P)u\u20162 + |z|2\u2016Pu\u20162 \u2212O(e\u2212\u03b1h )\u2016u\u20162 + 2Re\u3008(Ph \u2212 z)(Id\u2212 P)u, (Ph \u2212 z)Pu\u3009.\nThe last term equals\n2Re [ \u3008(Id\u2212 P)u, P \u2217hPhPu\u3009 \u2212 z\u3008(Id\u2212 P)u, PhPu\u3009 \u2212 z\u0304\u3008(Id\u2212 P)u, P \u2217hPu\u3009 ] = (1 + |z|)O(e\u2212\u03b1h )\u2016u\u20162.\nTherefore choosing c\u0303 \u2264 c, there exists h0 > 0 such that for h \u2264 h0 and z such that c\u0303h2 \u2264 |z| \u2264 ch2\n\u2016(Ph \u2212 z)u\u20162 \u2265 ( |z|2 +O(e\u2212\u03b1h ) ) \u2016u\u20162 \u2265 c\u0303 2h4\n2 \u2016u\u20162.\nOnce again, the same estimate holds with P \u2217h instead of Ph and since the annulus we are working on is invariant by complex conjugation we also have\n\u2016(Ph \u2212 z)\u2217u\u2016 \u2265 c\u0303h2\n2 \u2016u\u2016 .\nTherefore, we get the following resolvent estimate on the annulus centered in 0 and of radiuses c\u0303h2 and ch2:\n\u2016(Ph \u2212 z)\u22121\u2016 = O(h\u22122) for c\u0303h2 \u2264 |z| \u2264 ch2.(2.3) We can now consider the spectral projection\n\u03a00 = 1\n2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n|z|=ch2 (z \u2212 Ph)\u22121dz(2.4)\nand its range that we denote H . This operator will yield some information on Spec(Ph) \u2229B(0, ch2) and therefore enable us to prove the main statement from Theorem 1.6.\nThe main point is that H is of dimension n0. It can be obtained by a direct adaptation of the proof of Proposition 3.1 from [20]. Hence Spec(Ph) \u2229 B(0, ch2) which is the same as Spec(Ph|H) consists of n0 eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity). Here again, our result slightly differs from the one in [20] as we do not rule out the possibilities that Ph|H contains some Jordan blocks and that some of its eigenvalues are not real. It only remains to prove that these are exponentially small with respect to 1/h. We begin by noticing that thanks to Lemma 2.3, we have (z \u2212 Ph)ghj = zghj + O(e\u2212 \u03b1 h ) and (z \u2212 P \u2217h )ghj = zghj +O(e\u2212 \u03b1 h ) from which we easily deduce\n\u03a00g h j = g h j +O(e \u2212\u03b1h ) and \u03a0\u22170g h j = g h j +O(e \u2212\u03b1h ).(2.5)\nIn particular, (\u03a00g h j )1\u2264j\u2264n0 is almost orthonormal so for u = \u2211 uj\u03a00g h j \u2208 H , we have\n\u2016u\u20162 = ( 1 +O(e\u2212\u03b1/h) ) n0\u2211\nj=1\n|uj|2.\nTherefore it is enough to prove that Ph is exponnentially small on (\u03a00g h j )1\u2264j\u2264n0 . But thanks to the resolvent estimate (2.3), it is easy to see that \u03a00 = O(1) and since Ph and \u03a00 commute, we get the desired result.\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 1.6, it only remains to show the existence of the resolvent on {Re z \u2264 ch2}\\B(0, c\u0303h2) as well as the estimate in O(h\u22122).\nLemma 2.6. Denote \u03a0\u03020 = 1\u2212\u03a00. For all u \u2208 L2(R2d), we have \u03a0\u03020u = w + r whith w \u2208 (ghj )\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 and r \u2208 Span ( (ghj )1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) satisfying r = O(e\u2212 \u03b1 h )\u2016\u03a0\u03020u\u2016. Proof. First we take for r the orthogonal projection of \u03a0\u03020u on Span ( (ghj )1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) . Then we notice that using (2.5), we get\n\u3008ghj , \u03a0\u03020u\u3009 = \u3008\u03a0\u0302\u22170ghj , \u03a0\u03020u\u3009 = O(e\u2212 \u03b1 h )\u2016\u03a0\u03020u\u2016\nwhich implies the announced estimate. Lemma 2.7. For all r\u2032 \u2208 Span ( (gj)1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) , we have N\u00b1h,\u03b5r\n\u2032 \u2208 Dom(P \u2217) = Dom (P ). Moreover, the restrictions to the finite dimensional subspace Span ( (gj)1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) of the operators PN\u00b1h,\u03b5 and P \u2217N\u00b1h,\u03b5 are all O(1).\nProof. For the first statement, it is sufficient to show that for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0, the functions Lgj and L\u2217gj are both in Dom (P ). But we have in the sense of distributions\nX0Lgj = [X0, L]gj + LX0gj(2.6)\nand we saw in the proof of Proposition 2.4 that [X0, L] is a bounded operator on L 2(R2d) so it is then clear that X0Lgj \u2208 L2(R2d) i.e Lgj \u2208 Dom(P ). The same goes easily for L\u2217gj . For the second statement, using Lemma 2.3 and the fact that Q\u03031 = O(h\n\u22121), it suffices to notice that for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0, (2.6) implies that X0Lgj and X0L \u2217gj are both O(1) as we saw that L and [X0, L] are O(1).\nProposition 2.8. Consider P\u0302h the restriction of Ph to \u03a0\u03020D acting on \u03a0\u03020L 2(R2d). Then for all z \u2208 C such that Re z \u2264 ch2, the resolvent (P\u0302h \u2212 z)\u22121 exists and we have the uniform estimate (P\u0302h \u2212 z)\u22121 = O(h\u22122).\nProof. We actually prove that the result of Proposition 2.4 remains true when replacing the set (gj)\n\u22a5 1\u2264j\u2264n0 \u2229 Dom(P ) by S\u22121h \u03a0\u03020D. We will deduce that the result of Corollary 2.5 also remains true when taking u \u2208 \u03a0\u03020D instead of (ghj )\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 \u2229D, which is precisely the statement that we want to prove. Let u \u2208 D, using the notations from Lemma 2.6 we have\nRe \u3008PS\u22121h \u03a0\u03020u,N+h,\u03b5S\u22121h \u03a0\u03020u\u3009 = Re \u3008PS\u22121h w,N+h,\u03b5S\u22121h w\u3009+Re \u3008PS\u22121h w,N+h,\u03b5S\u22121h r\u3009 +Re \u3008PS\u22121h r,N+h,\u03b5S\u22121h w\u3009+Re \u3008PS\u22121h r,N+h,\u03b5S\u22121h r\u3009 .\nNow let us denote w\u2032 = S\u22121h w \u2208 (gj)\u22a51\u2264j\u2264n0 \u2229 Dom(P ) and r\u2032 = S \u22121 h r \u2208 Span ( (gj)1\u2264j\u2264n0 ) . We can use Proposition 2.4 as well as Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7 to get\nRe \u3008N+h,\u03b5PS\u22121h \u03a0\u03020u, S\u22121h \u03a0\u03020u\u3009 = Re \u3008Pw\u2032, N+h,\u03b5w\u2032\u3009+Re \u3008w\u2032, P \u2217N+h,\u03b5r\u2032\u3009+Re \u3008N+h,\u03b5Pr\u2032, w\u2032\u3009+Re \u3008Pr\u2032, N+h,\u03b5r\u2032\u3009\n\u2265 h C \u2016w\u20162 \u2212O\n( \u2016w\u2016 \u2016r\u2016 ) \u2212 O(e\u2212\u03b1h \u2016r\u2016)\n\u2265 h 2C \u2016S\u22121h \u03a0\u03020u\u20162.\nAs usual, all of the above remains true with P \u2217 and N\u2212h,\u03b5 instead of P and N + h,\u03b5 so the proof is now complete.\nEnd of Proof of Theorem 1.6 : Let z \u2208 C satisfying Re z \u2264 ch2 and |z| \u2265 c\u0303h2 and recall the notation H = Ran\u03a00. We already know from Proposition 2.8 that P\u0302h \u2212 z is invertible, but it is clearly also the case of Ph|H \u2212 z since Ph|H = O(e\u2212\u03b1/h). Therefore Ph \u2212 z is invertible and we have\n(Ph \u2212 z)\u22121 = (P\u0302h \u2212 z)\u22121\u03a0\u03020 + (Ph|H \u2212 z)\u22121\u03a00.(2.7) Besides, we easily have for such z that \u2016(Ph|H \u2212 z)u\u2016 \u2265 1C h2\u2016u\u2016 which combined with (2.7), Proposition 2.8 and the fact that \u2016\u03a00\u2016 = O(1) yields the estimate (Ph \u2212 z)\u22121 = O(h\u22122).\n3. Accurate quasimodes\n3.1. General form. Let us denote\nW (x, v) = V (x) 2 + v2\n4 the global potential on R2d. Before we can construct our quasimodes, we need to recall the general labeling of the minima which originates from [6] and was generalized in [11], as well as the topological constructions that go with it. In our case, it has to be done for the global potential, i.e the function W . However, by the definition of W , a strong connection between these constructions for W and the ones for V will appear, leading to simplifications. In order to give a proper statement about this connection, let us construct the labelings for both W and V . To this aim, we consider d\u2032 \u2208 N\u2217 and a smooth Morse function Y on Rd \u2032\nbounded from below, having at least two local minima and such that |\u2207Y | \u2265 1/C outside of a compact. According to Hypothesis 1.5, one can for instance take Y = V/2 or Y = W and recall that as we discussed following Hypothesis 1.5, it implies that Y (X) \u2265 |X |/C outside of a compact. We also denote U (k),Y the critical points of Y of index k. For shortness, we will write \u201dCC\u201d instead of \u201dconnected component\u201d.\nLemma 3.1. If X \u2208 U (1),Y , then there exists r0 > 0 such that for all 0 < r < r0, X has a connected neighborhood Ur in B(X, r) such that Ur \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} has exactly 2 CCs.\nProof. Let X \u2208 U (1),Y ; according to the Morse Lemma, there exists a connected neighborhood Ur of X , r\u2032 > 0 and \u03d5 : Ur \u2192 B(0, r\u2032) a smooth diffeomorphism such that\nY \u25e6 \u03d5\u22121 = Y (X) + 1 2 \u3008HessXY \u00b7, \u00b7\u3009.\nBesides, it is easy to see that\nUr \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} = \u03d5\u22121 ( {y \u2208 B(0, r\u2032) ; \u3008HessXY y, y\u3009 < 0} )\nand {y \u2208 B(0, r\u2032) ; \u3008HessXY y, y\u3009 < 0} has exactly 2 CCs.\nLemma 3.2. Let X \u2208 Rd\u2032 and suppose there exists r0 > 0 such that for every neighborhood U of X in B(X, r0), the set U \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} is not connected. Then X \u2208 U (1),Y . Proof. First we clearly have that \u2207Y (X) = 0 since otherwise one could use the implicit function theorem to find a neighborhood U of X in B(X, r0) such that U \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} is connected. It is also clear that X /\u2208 U (0),Y so let us assume by contradiction that X \u2208 U (k),Y with k \u2265 2. Then using the Morse Lemma as in the proof of Lemma 3.1, we would once again get that X has a neighborhood U in B(X, r0) such that U \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} has the same number of CCs as {y \u2208 B(0, r) ; \u3008HessXY y, y\u3009 < 0} which is connected since k \u2265 2. Hence X has to be in U (1),Y .\nIn view of the result from Lemma 3.1 and following the approach from [6, 11], we give the following definition:\nDefinition 3.3. a) We say that X \u2208 U (1),Y is a separating saddle point and we denote X \u2208 V(1),Y if for every r > 0 small enough, the two CCs of Ur \u2229 {Y < Y (X)} are contained in different CCs of {Y < Y (X)}.\nb) We say that \u03c3 \u2208 R is a separating saddle value if \u03c3 \u2208 Y (V(1),Y ). c) Finally, we say that a set E \u2282 Rd\u2032 is critical if there exists \u03c3 \u2208 Y (V(1),Y ) such that E is a CC of\n{Y < \u03c3} satisfying \u2202E \u2229 V(1),Y 6= \u2205. Lemma 3.4. Let m, m\u2032 two distinct local minima of Y . The real number\n\u03c3 = sup { a \u2208 R ; m and m\u2032 are in two different CCs of {Y < a} }\nis well defined and {Y < \u03c3} has at least two CCs \u2126 \u220b m and \u2126\u2032 \u220b m\u2032. Moreover, \u03c3 is a separating saddle value and \u2126, \u2126\u2032 are critical.\nProof. We can assume that Y (m) \u2264 Y (m\u2032) so taking a := infA Y where A is a well chosen annulus centered in m\u2032, we see that\n{ a \u2208 R ; m and m\u2032 are in two different CCs of {Y < a} } 6= \u2205(3.1)\nand it is then clear that \u03c3 is well defined. Besides, if (\u03c3n)n\u22651 is an increasing sequence in the set from (3.1) that converges towards \u03c3 and \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 Rd\u2032 is a continuous path linking m and m\u2032, then\n\u03b3([0, 1]) \u2229 ( R d\u2032\\{Y < \u03c3} ) = \u22c2\nn\u22651\n\u03b3([0, 1]) \u2229 ( R d\u2032\\{Y < \u03c3n} )\nis non empty by compactness so we can consider \u2126 \u220b m and \u2126\u2032 \u220b m\u2032 two different CCs of {Y < \u03c3}. To prove that \u03c3 is a separating saddle value, we will actually show that there exists a CC of {Y < \u03c3} that we denote \u2126\u2032\u2032 which is not \u2126 and satisfies \u2126 \u2229 \u2126\u2032\u2032 6= \u2205. Assume by contradiction that there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that (\u2126 + B(0, \u03b5))\\\u2126 is included in {Y \u2265 \u03c3}. In that case, the points of (\u2126 + B(0, \u03b5))\\\u2126 on which Y takes the value \u03c3 are local minima of Y which is a Morse function, so there are finitely many such points. Thus, up to taking \u03b5 smaller, we can assume that\n\u0393 := dist(\u00b7,\u2126)\u22121({\u03b5}) \u2286 {Y > \u03c3}. Hence there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that the minimum of Y on \u0393 is \u03c3 + \u03b4. Since any continuous path linking m and m\u2032 has to cross \u0393, m and m\u2032 are in two different CCs of {Y < \u03c3 + \u03b4/2}. This contradicts the maximality of \u03c3 and proves the existence of \u2126\u2032\u2032. Hence, Lemma 3.2 implies that \u2126 \u2229 \u2126\u2032\u2032 \u2286 U (1),Y and then \u2126 \u2229\u2126\u2032\u2032 \u2286 V(1),Y follows obviously from the definition of V(1),Y .\nThanks to Lemma 3.4, we know that V(1),Y 6= \u2205. Let us then denote \u03c32 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \u03c3N where N \u2265 2 the different separating saddle values of Y and for convenience we set \u03c31 = +\u221e. We call labeling of the minima of Y any injection l : U (0),Y \u2192 J1, NK \u00d7 N\u2217. If l(m) = (k, j), we denote for shortness m = mk,j . We are going to introduce the usual labeling of the minima for a potential Y (see for instance [6,11,12]). We adopt a slightly unusual point of view in order to facilitate the establishment of the correspondence between the constructions for W and the ones for V/2 that we will state later on. For \u03c3 \u2208 R \u222a {+\u221e}, let us denote CY\u03c3 the set of all the CCs of {Y < \u03c3}. Given a labeling l of the minima, we denote for k \u2208 J1, NK U (0),Yk = l\u22121(J1, kK \u00d7 N\u2217) \u2229 {Y < \u03c3k} and we say that the labeling is adapted to the separating saddle values if for all k \u2208 J1, NK, each element of l\u22121({k}\u00d7N\u2217) is a global minimum of Y restricted to some CC of {Y < \u03c3k} and the map T Yk : U (0),Y k \u2192 CY\u03c3k sending m \u2208 U (0),Yk on the element of CY\u03c3k to which it belongs is bijective. In particular, l\u22121({k} \u00d7 N\u2217) is contained in U (0),Yk . Such labelings exist, one can for instance easily check that the usual labeling procedure presented in [11] is adapted to the separating saddle values.\nLemma 3.5. Under an adapted labeling of the minima of Y , for any 2 \u2264 k \u2264 N , the elements of T Yk ( l\u22121({k} \u00d7 N\u2217) ) are critical.\nProof. Let mk,j \u2208 l\u22121({k} \u00d7 N\u2217). There exists a CC of {Y < \u03c3k\u22121} that we call E which is such that T Yk (mk,j) \u2286 E and E contains some mk\u2032,j\u2032 \u2208 E for 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 k \u2212 1 and j\u2032 \u2208 N\u2217 by bijectivity of T Yk\u22121. Therefore, mk\u2032,j\u2032 and mk,j are in the same CC of {Y < \u03c3k\u22121} but are not both in T Yk (mk,j) this time by bijectivity of T Yk . Applying Lemma 3.4 to mk\u2032,j\u2032 and mk,j , we obtain a separating saddle value \u03c3\u0303 which is the maximal real number such that mk\u2032,j\u2032 and mk,j are in two different CCs of {Y < \u03c3\u0303}. Therefore we get \u03c3\u0303 = \u03c3k so T Y k (mk,j) is one of the CCs of {Y < \u03c3\u0303} called \u2126 and \u2126\u2032 in Lemma 3.4 and which are critical.\nDefinition 3.6. Given an adapted labeling, we can now define the following mappings:\n\u2022 EY : U (0),Y \u2212\u2212\u2192 P(Rd\u2032) mk,j 7\u2212\u2212\u2192 T Yk (mk,j).\n\u2022 jY : U (0),Y \u2192 P ( V(1),Y \u222a {s1} )\ngiven by jY (m) = s1 where s1 is a fictive saddle point such that Y (s1) = \u03c31 = +\u221e; and for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 N , jY (mk,j) = \u2202EY (mk,j) \u2229 V(1),Y which is not empty according to Lemma 3.5 and included in {Y = \u03c3k}.\n\u2022 \u03c3 Y : U (0),Y \u2192 Y (V(1),Y ) \u222a {\u03c31} m 7\u2192 Y (jY (m))\nwhere we allow ourselves to identify the set Y (jY (m)) and its unique element in Y (V(1),Y )\u222a{\u03c31}. \u2022 SY : U (0),Y \u2212\u2212\u2192]0,+\u221e]\nm 7\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c3Y (m)\u2212 Y (m). Let us now state a Lemma that will enable us to show that, roughly speaking, the previous constructions for Y = V/2 are the projections onRdx of the ones for Y =W . First, we give the following easy observation.\nRemark 3.7. By definition of W , we have V/2 = W (\u00b7, 0). Moreover, if (x0, v0) \u2208 {W < \u03c3}, then {x0} \u00d7B(0, |v0|) \u2286 {W < \u03c3}.\nFor shortness, we denote C\u03c3 = CV/2\u03c3 and C\u0303\u03c3 = CW\u03c3 as well as U (k) = U (k),V/2 and U\u0303 (k) = U (k),W (we do similarly with V or Uk instead of U). Notice that U\u0303 (k) = U (k) \u00d7{0}. We introduce the natural projection \u03c0x : R 2d \u2192 Rdx sending (x, v) on x that we also consider as a map from P(R2d) to P(Rdx).\nLemma 3.8. For all \u03c3 \u2208 R, the projection \u03c0x sends C\u0303\u03c3 in C\u03c3. Moreover, the map \u03c0x : C\u0303\u03c3 \u2192 C\u03c3 is bijective.\nProof. The proof of the first statement is an easy consequence of Remark 3.7. For the second statement, let x \u2208 E \u2208 C\u03c3 and denote E\u0303 the element of C\u0303\u03c3 containing (x, 0). By the first statement, we necessarily have \u03c0x(E\u0303) = E so we have shown the surjectivity. Now let E\u03031, E\u03032 \u2208 C\u0303\u03c3 such that \u03c0x(E\u03031) = \u03c0x(E\u03032) = E1. Let also (x1, v1) \u2208 E\u03031 and (x2, v2) \u2208 E\u03032. Since x1, x2 \u2208 E1, there exists a path (\u03b3(t), 0) from (x1, 0) to (x2, 0) contained in {W < \u03c3}. Thus, the concatenation of the paths (x1, (1\u2212 t)v1), (\u03b3(t), 0) and (x2, tv2) yields a path linking (x1, v1) and (x2, v2) in {W < \u03c3}. Hence E\u03031 = E\u03032 and we get the injectivity.\nProposition 3.9. a) We have V\u0303(1) = V(1)\u00d7{0}. In particular, V/2 and W have the same separating saddle values.\nb) A set E\u0303 \u2208 C\u0303\u03c3 is critical if and only if \u03c0x(E\u0303) is critical. c) A labeling ((m, 0)k,j)k,j is adapted to W if and only if (mk,j)k,j is adapted to V/2.\nMoreover, given an adapted labeling, the mappings from Definition 3.6 satisfy\nEV/2(mk,j) = \u03c0x ( EW (mk,j , 0) ) and jW (mk,j , 0) = j V/2(mk,j)\u00d7 {0}.\nProof. Let E\u0303 \u2208 C\u0303\u03c3. Thanks to Remark 3.7, we easily have (x, 0) \u2208 \u2202E\u0303 \u21d0\u21d2 x \u2208 \u2202 ( \u03c0x(E\u0303) ) .(3.2)\na): We already know that U\u0303 (1) = U (1) \u00d7 {0}. Besides, we easily deduce from (3.2) and Lemma 3.8 that (s, 0) \u2208 U\u0303 (1) is in the closure of two distinct CCs of {W < W (s, 0)} if and only if s \u2208 U (1) is in the closure of two distinct CCs of {V < V (s)} so the first item is proven. b): This is also a straightforward consequence of (3.2) and Lemma 3.8 combined with item a). c): Let E\u0303 \u2208 C\u0303\u03c3k . By Remark 3.7, we easily have (m, 0) is a global minimum of W |E\u0303 \u21d0\u21d2 m is a global minimum of V |\u03c0x(E\u0303).(3.3)\nBesides, since U\u0303 (0)k = U (0) k \u00d7 {0}, we have that \u03c0k defined as \u03c0x : U\u0303 (0) k \u2192 U (0) k is bijective. We can then conclude as\nTWk = \u03c0 \u22121 x \u25e6 T V/2k \u25e6 \u03c0k(3.4)\nwhere \u03c0x denotes the bijective map from Lemma 3.8. The last statement is a direct consequence of (3.4), (3.2) and item a).\nFrom now on, we fix a labeling (mk,j)k,j adapted to V . Note that \u03c3 V/2(m) = \u03c3W (m, 0) and SV/2(m) = SW (m, 0). For shortness, we will denote in the rest of the paper j = jV/2, \u03c3 = \u03c3V/2 and S = SV/2. However, be careful that we choose to denote E = \u03c0\u22121x \u25e6 EV/2 so that the range of E is in P(R2d). Following [2, 6, 11, 12], we can now state our last assumption that allows us to treat the generic case. As mentionned in the introduction, this assumption could actually be omitted (see [17] or [1]) but this would introduce additionnal difficulties that are not the main concern of this paper.\nHypothesis 3.10. For all m \u2208 U (0), we have a) m is the only global minimum of V |EV/2(m) b) for any m\u2032 \u2208 U (0)\\{m}, the sets j(m) and j(m\u2032) do not intersect.\nAccording to Proposition 3.9 and (3.3), this hypothesis is equivalent to the facts that (m, 0) is the only global minimum of W |E(m) and jW (m, 0) \u2229 jW (m\u2032, 0) = \u2205 which is what we use in practice.\nRecall the notation (1.6) and let us extend our notions of asymptotic expansions to smooth functions that are not necessarily symbols. Throughout the paper, for d\u2032 \u2208 N\u2217, \u2126 \u2286 Rd\u2032 and a \u2208 C\u221e(\u2126) a function depending on h and such that for all \u03b2 \u2208 Nd\u2032 we have \u2202\u03b2a = OL\u221e(1), we will denote a \u223ch \u2211 j\u22650 h jaj , where (aj)j\u22650 \u2282 C\u221e(\u2126) are allowed to depend on h, provided that for all \u03b2 \u2208 Nd \u2032\nand N \u2208 N, there exists C\u03b2,N such that\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2202\u03b2 ( a\u2212 N\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nhjaj )\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u221e,\u2126 \u2264 C\u03b2,NhN .\nIt implies in particular that \u2202\u03b2aj = OL\u221e(1). We will also say that a \u2208 C\u221e(\u2126) admits a classical expansion on \u2126 and we will denote a \u223c\u2211j\u22650 hjaj if a \u223ch \u2211 j\u22650 h\njaj and the (aj) are independent of h. From now on, the letter r will denote a small universal positive constant whose value may decrease as we progress in this paper (one can think of r as 1/C). For x \u2208 Rd, we denote B0(x, r) = B(x, r)\u00d7B(0, r) \u2286 R2d. We essentially follow the quasimodal construction from [1]. We will also denote\nHW = h \u22121Xh0 =\n( v\n\u2212\u2202xV\n) .\nLet m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}; for each s \u2208 j(m) we introduce a function \u2113s,h that will appear in our quasimodes. Note that thanks to item b) from Hypothesis 3.10, each \u2113s,h corresponds to a unique m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}. Our goal will be to find some functions \u2113s,h such that our quasimodes are the most accurate possible. In order to begin the computations that will yield the equations that the function \u2113s,h should satisfy, we will for the moment assume that it satisfies the following:\n(3.5) a) \u2113s,h is a smooth real valued function on R2d whose support is contained in B0(s, 3r) b) \u2113s,h admits a classical expansion \u2113s,h(x, v) \u223c\u2211hj\u2113sj(x, v) on B0(s, 2r) c) \u2113s0 vanishes at (s, 0) d) (s, 0) is a local minimum of the function W + (\u2113s0)\n2/2 which is non degenerate e) the functions \u03b8m,h (which depends on \u2113\ns,h) and \u03c7m that we will introduce in (3.7)-(3.10) are such that \u03b8m,h is smooth on a neighborhood of supp \u03c7m.\nOnce we will have found the desired function \u2113s,h, we will see in Proposition 5.2 that these assumptions are actually satisfied. Denote \u03b6 \u2208 C\u221ec (R, [0, 1]) an even cut-off function supported in [\u2212\u03b3, \u03b3] that is equal to 1 on [\u2212\u03b3/2, \u03b3/2] where \u03b3 > 0 is a parameter to be fixed later and\nAh = 1\n2\n\u222b\nR\n\u03b6(s)e\u2212 s2 2hds =\n\u222b \u03b3\n0\n\u03b6(s)e\u2212 s2 2h ds = \u221a \u03c0h\u221a 2 (1 +O(e\u2212\u03b1/h)) for some \u03b1 > 0.(3.6)\nWe now define for each m \u2208 U (0)\\{m} a function \u03b8m,h as follows: if (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, r) \u2229 {|\u2113s,h| \u2264 2\u03b3} for some s \u2208 j(m),\n\u03b8m,h(x, v) = 1\n2\n( 1 +A\u22121h\n\u222b \u2113s,h(x,v)\n0\n\u03b6(s)e\u2212s 2/2hds ) (3.7)\nwhereas we set\n\u03b8m,h = 1 on ( E(m) +B(0, \u03b5) ) \\ ( \u2294\ns\u2208j(m)\n( B0(s, r) \u2229 {|\u2113s,h| \u2264 2\u03b3} )) (3.8)\nwith \u03b5(r) > 0 to be fixed later and\n\u03b8m,h = 0 everywhere else.(3.9)\nNote that \u03b8m,h takes values in [0, 1]. Denote \u2126 the CC of {W \u2264 \u03c3(m)} containing m. The CCs of {W \u2264 \u03c3(m)} are separated so for \u03b5 > 0 small enough, there exists \u03b5\u0303 > 0 such that\nmin { W (x, v) ; d ( (x, v),\u2126 ) = \u03b5 } = \u03c3(m) + 2\u03b5\u0303.\nThus the distance between {W \u2264 \u03c3(m) + \u03b5\u0303} \u2229 ( \u2126 + B(0, \u03b5) ) and \u2202 ( \u2126 + B(0, \u03b5) ) is positive and we can consider a cut-off function\n\u03c7m \u2208 C\u221ec (R2d, [0, 1])(3.10) such that\n\u03c7m = 1 on {W \u2264 \u03c3(m) + \u03b5\u0303} \u2229 ( \u2126+B(0, \u03b5) )\nand\nsupp\u03c7m \u2282 ( \u2126 +B(0, \u03b5) ) .\nTo sum up, we have the following picture:\n\u2022j(m)\u2022m\n\u03b8m,h = 1\n\u03b8m,h = 0\n\u2126\nsupp \u03c7 m\n\u03b8m,h given by (3.7)\nWe also denote Wm(x, v) =W (x, v) \u2212 V (m)/2 and it is clear that on the support of \u2207\u03c7m, we have\nWm \u2265 S(m) + \u03b5\u0303. Our quasimodes will be the L2-renormalizations of the functions\nfm,h(x, v) = \u03c7m(x, v)\u03b8m,h(x, v)e \u2212Wm(x,v)/h ; m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}(3.11)\nand for m = m,\nfm,h(x, v) = e \u2212Wm(x,v)/h \u2208 KerPh.\nNote that these functions belong to C\u221ec (R2d) thanks to our assumption on the (\u2113s,h)s\u2208j(m) and that for m 6= m, we have\nsupp fm,h \u2286 E(m) +B(0, \u03b5\u2032)(3.12)\nwhere \u03b5\u2032 = max(\u03b5, r).\n3.2. Action of the operator Ph. Let us fix m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}. We will denote\nW\u0303m,h =Wm + \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n(\u2113s,h)2/2(3.13)\nand\n\u03c8m,h(x, v, v\u2032) =\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u2202vW\u0303m,h(x, v \u2032 + t(v \u2212 v\u2032))dt.(3.14)\nRemark 3.11. Using Hypothesis 1.3, it is easy to see that b\u2217hOph(M h) = Oph(g h), with\ngh = (\u2212i t\u03b7 + tv/2)Mh \u2212 h 2 (t\u2207v \u2212 i 2 t\u2207\u03b7)Mh \u2208 M1,d\n( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22121) )\nwhere\nt\u2207vMh = ( d\u2211\nk=1\n\u2202vkmk,j ) 1\u2264j\u2264d\nand t\u2207\u03b7 is defined similarly.\nProposition 3.12. Let fm,h be the quasimode defined in (3.11). With the notations introduced in (3.6) and (3.13), one has\nPhfm,h = h\n2 A\u22121h \u03c9\nm,h e \u2212W\u0303 m,h h 1jW (m)+B0(0,2r) +OL2\n( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h )\nwhere \u03c9m,h is a function bounded uniformly in h and defined on jW (m) +B0(0, 2r) by\n\u03c9m,h = \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n( HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113s,h + Is,h )\nwith Is,h(x, v) given for (x, v) \u2208 jW (m) +B0(0, 2r) by the oscillatory integral\n(2\u03c0h)\u2212d \u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u22642r\ne i h \u03b7\u00b7(v\u2212v \u2032)gh ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8m,h(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u2202v\u2113 s,h(x, v\u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7.\nProof. In order to lighten the notations, we will drop some of the exponents and indexes m, s and h in the proof. By (3.5), we have on the support of \u03c7 that \u03b8 is smooth and\n\u2207\u03b8 = A \u22121 h\n2\n\u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\ne\u2212(\u2113 s)2/2h\u03b6(\u2113s)\u2207\u2113s 1B0(s,r).\nHere we have to put the indicator function because \u03b6(\u2113)\u2207\u2113 might have some support in B0(s, 3r)\\B0(s, r). We can then begin by computing\nXh0 f = hHW \u00b7 \u2207f = hHW \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8 \u03c7e\u2212Wm/h + hHW \u00b7 \u2207\u03c7 \u03b8e\u2212Wm/h(3.15)\n= h\n2 A\u22121h \u03c7e\n\u2212W\u0303/h \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n\u03b6(\u2113s)HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113s 1B0(s,r) +O ( he\u2212 S(m)+\u03b5\u0303 h ) .\nsince Wm \u2265 S(m) + \u03b5\u0303 on the support of \u2207\u03c7. Now we can use Remark 3.11 to write Qh(f) = hOph(g) ( (\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h + (\u2202v\u03c7)\u03b8e \u2212Wm/h ) (3.16)\n= h\n2 A\u22121h\n\u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\nOph(g) ( \u03b6(\u2113s)\u03c7e\u2212W\u0303/h\u2202v\u2113 s 1B0(s,r) ) +O ( he\u2212 S(m)+\u03b5\u0303 h )\nsince g \u2208 S(\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22121) and thus Oph(g) is bounded uniformly in h. But since g does not depend on \u03be, we have for s \u2208 j(m)\n(2\u03c0h)dOph(g) ( \u03b6(\u2113)\u03c7e\u2212W\u0303/h\u2202v\u2113 1B0(s,r) ) (x, v) =\n\u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u2264r\ne i h \u03b7\u00b7(v\u2212v \u2032)g ( x, v + v\u2032 2 , \u03b7 )\n\u00d7 \u03c7(x, v\u2032)\u03b6 ( \u2113(x, v\u2032) ) e\u2212W\u0303 (x,v \u2032)/h\u2202v\u2113(x, v \u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7 1B(s,r)(x).(3.17)\nLet us now treat separately the cases |v| \u2265 2r and |v| < 2r . When |v| \u2265 2r, we have |v\u2212 v\u2032| \u2265 r so we can apply the non stationnary phase to the integral in \u03b7 to get that for all x \u2208 B(s, r) and N \u2265 1, there exists CN > 0 such that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u2264r\ne i h\u03b7\u00b7(v\u2212v \u2032)g ( x, v + v\u2032 2 , \u03b7 ) \u03c7(x, v\u2032)\u03b6 ( \u2113(x, v\u2032) ) e\u2212W\u0303 (x,v \u2032)/h\u2202v\u2113(x, v \u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 CNhN |v|\u2212N e\u2212 S(m) h\nwhere we used item d) from (3.5), the fact that Wm(s, 0)+ \u2113 2 0(s, 0)/2 = S(m) and the estimate |v\u2212 v\u2032| \u2265 |v|/2. Hence we have shown that Qhf 1{|v|\u22652r} = O ( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h ) and Phf 1{|v|\u22652r} = O ( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h ) .(3.18)\nNow for the case |v| < 2r, let us denote Js1(x, v) the RHS of (3.17). Proceeding as in [18] in order to take the e\u2212W\u0303 (x,v\n\u2032)/h in front of the oscillatory integral,we get that for any x \u2208 B(s, r), Js1(x, v) = e \u2212W\u0303 (x,v)/hJs2(x, v)(3.19)\nwhere\nJs2(x, v) =\n\u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u2264r\ne i h\n( \u03b7\u2212i\u03c8(x,v,v\u2032) ) \u00b7 ( v\u2212v\u2032 ) g ( x, v + v\u2032 2 , \u03b7 ) \u03c7(x, v\u2032)\u03b6 ( \u2113(x, v\u2032) ) \u2202v\u2113(x, v \u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7 1B(s,r)(x)\nand \u03c8 is the function defined in (3.14). For K \u2282 {1, . . . , d} and z \u2208 Cd, denote zK = (zj)j\u2208K . We also denote for d\u2032 \u2208 N and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d\u2032\nej = (\u03b4k,j)1\u2264k\u2264d\u2032 \u2208 Nd \u2032 (3.20)\nthe elements of the canonical basis of Cd \u2032\n. Now notice that \u03c8 is a smooth function and that using the expansion of \u2113 and (3.13), we get on B0(s, 2r)\u00d7 {|v\u2032| \u2264 2r},\n\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032) = v + v\u2032\n4 +\n\u222b 1\n0\n( \u21130\u2202v\u21130 ) (x, v\u2032 + t(v \u2212 v\u2032))dt+O(h).\nIn particular, we can choose r small enough so that |\u03c8| < \u03c4 on B0(s, 2r) \u00d7 {|v\u2032| \u2264 2r}. Besides, since g \u2208 S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22121), we have for all K \u2282 {1, . . . , d} and k \u2208 {1, . . . , d}\\K that the symbol\n\u03b7k 7\u2192 g ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\n\u2211\nj\u2208K\n[\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)]jej\n)\nhas an analytic continuation to {|\u03b7k| < \u03c4} for any x \u2208 B(s, r), v, v\u2032 \u2208 B(0, 2r) and \u03b7 \u2208 Rd. Hence, one can use the Cauchy formula which combined with the decay of g yields \u222b\nR\ne i h\n( \u03b7k\u2212i[\u03c8(x,v,v \u2032)]k ) (vk\u2212v \u2032 k)g ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\n\u2211\nj\u2208K\n[\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)]jej ) d\u03b7k =\n\u222b\nR\ne i h\u03b7k(vk\u2212v \u2032 k)g ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7+i\n\u2211\nj\u2208K\u222a{k}\n[\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)]jej ) d\u03b7k.\nApplying this successively for each component of \u03b7 on the integrals in Js2 finally gives J s 2 = J s 3 where\nJs3(x, v) =\n\u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u2264r\ne i h \u03b7\u00b7(v\u2212v \u2032)g ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u03c7(x, v\u2032)\u03b6 ( \u2113(x, v\u2032) ) \u2202v\u2113(x, v \u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7 1B(s,r)(x).\nCombined with (3.17) and (3.19), this yields for |v| < 2r\n(2\u03c0h)dOph(g) ( \u03b6(\u2113)\u03c7e\u2212W\u0303/h\u2202v\u2113 1B0(s,r) ) (x, v) = e\u2212W\u0303 (x,v)/hJs3(x, v).(3.21)\nTherefore, setting on jW (m) +B0(0, 2r)\n\u03c9\u0303 = \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n( \u03c7\u03b6(\u2113s)HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113s 1B0(s,r) + (2\u03c0h)\u2212dJs3(x, v) ) ,\nwe have according to (3.15), (3.16), (3.18) and (3.21)\nPhf = h\n2 A\u22121h \u03c9\u0303 e\n\u2212W\u0303/h1jW (m)+B0(0,2r) +O ( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h ) .\nHence it is sufficient to check that on jW (m) +B0(0, 2r)\n(\u03c9\u0303 \u2212 \u03c9)e\u2212W\u0303/h = O ( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h ) .\nThis can be done easily using again the non stationary phase on an h-independent neighborhood of (s, 0) on which \u03c7\u03b6(\u2113) \u2212 1 vanishes since item d) from (3.5) implies that e\u2212W\u0303/h = O(e\u2212(S(m)+\u03b4)/h) outside of this neighborhood for some \u03b4 > 0.\nRemark 3.13. Since P \u2217h = \u2212Xh0 +Qh, it is clear from the previous proof that\nP \u2217hfm,h = h\n2 A\u22121h\n\u2217 \u03c9m,h e \u2212W\u0303 m,h h 1jW (m)+B0(0,2r) +OL2\n( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m) h )\nwith \u2217 \u03c9m,h = \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n( \u2212HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113s,h + Is,h ) .\n4. Equations on \u2113s,h\nFrom now on, we also fix s \u2208 j(m). Lemma 4.1. The function \u03c9m,h admits the classical expansion \u03c9m,h \u223c\u2211j\u22650 hj\u03c9mj on B0(s, 2r) where\n\u03c9m0 = HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113s0 +M0 ( x, v, i (v 2 + \u2113s0 \u2202v\u2113 s 0 ))( v + \u2113s0\u2202v\u2113 s 0 ) \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113s0\nand for j \u2265 1,\n\u03c9mj = HW \u00b7 \u2207\u2113sj +M0 ( x, v, i (v 2 + \u2113s0 \u2202v\u2113 s 0 )) (v + 2\u2113s0\u2202v\u2113 s 0) \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113sj(4.1)\n+ i \u2113s0 ( tv + \u2113s0 t(\u2202v\u2113 s 0) ) D\u03b7M0 ( x, v, i(v/2 + \u2113s0\u2202v\u2113 s 0) )( \u2202v\u2113 s j ) \u2202v\u2113 s 0\n+M0\n( x, v, i (v 2 + \u2113s0 \u2202v\u2113 s 0 )) \u2202v\u2113 s 0 \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113s0 \u2113sj\n+ i ( tv + \u2113s0 t(\u2202v\u2113 s 0) ) D\u03b7M0 ( x, v, i(v/2 + \u2113s0\u2202v\u2113 s 0) )( \u2202v\u2113 s 0 ) \u2202v\u2113 s 0 \u2113 s j +Rj(\u2113 s 0, . . . , \u2113 s j\u22121)\nwhere Rj : ( C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) )j \u2192 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) and D\u03b7 denotes the partial differential with respect to the variable \u03b7.\nProof. Once again, we drop some of the exponents and indexes m, s and h in the proof. Denote B\u221e(0, 2r) = {v\u2032, \u03b7 \u2208 R2d ; max(|v\u2032|, |\u03b7|) < 2r}. The first terms of \u03c90 and \u03c9j are both easily obtained thanks to the expansion of \u2113 on B0(s, 2r). Hence it remains to get an expansion of g(x, v/2 + v\u2032/2, \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)) that we will then be able to combine with the stationnary phase to get an expansion of the whole term Is,h of \u03c9. Let us start with an expansion of \u03c8 : the expansion of \u2113 yields\n\u2202vW\u0303 \u2212 v/2 \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhj j\u2211\nk=0\n\u2113k\u2202v\u2113j\u2212k on B0(s, 2r)\nso using (3.14), we get\n\u03c8 \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhj\u03c8j on B0(s, 2r)\u00d7 {|v\u2032| \u2264 2r}\nwhere\n\u03c80(x, v, v \u2032) =\nv + v\u2032\n4 +\n\u222b 1\n0\n( \u21130\u2202v\u21130 ) (x, v\u2032 + t(v \u2212 v\u2032))dt(4.2)\nand for j \u2265 1,\n\u03c8j(x, v, v \u2032) =\n\u222b 1\n0\nj\u2211\nk=0\n( \u2113k\u2202v\u2113j\u2212k ) (x, v\u2032 + t(v \u2212 v\u2032))dt.(4.3)\nBesides, since Mh \u223c \u2211n\u22650 hnMn in Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) ) , we deduce thanks to Proposition C.2 and\nRemark 3.11 that g also has a classical expansion g \u223c \u2211n\u22650 hngn in M1,d ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22121) ) , where the (gn) are given by\ng0(x, v, \u03b7) = ( \u2212 i t\u03b7 + tv\n2\n) M0(x, v, \u03b7)(4.4)\nand\ngn(x, v, \u03b7) = ( \u2212 i t\u03b7 + tv\n2\n) Mn(x, v, \u03b7) \u2212 1\n2 (t\u2207v \u2212\ni\n2 t\u2207\u03b7)Mn\u22121(x, v, \u03b7)(4.5) for n \u2265 1. According to Corollary C.6, we have\ngn\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjgn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) on B0(s, 2r)\u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r)\nwith\ngn,0(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) = gn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) ) (4.6)\nand for j \u2265 1\ngn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) = iD\u03b7gn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) )( \u03c8j(x, v, v \u2032) ) +R1j (\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121)(4.7) where R1j : ( C\u221e(B0(s, 2r))\n)j \u2192 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)). Using the expansion of g itself and Proposition C.1, we get\ng ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u223ch \u2211\nn\u22650\nhngn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n)\non B0(s, 2r)\u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r) so we can use Proposition C.3 which yields\ng ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhj j\u2211\nn=0\ngn,j\u2212n(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7)(4.8)\non B0(s, 2r) \u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r). Thus, using the expansion (4.8) that we just got, the one of \u2202v\u2113, and the one for an oscillatory integral given by the stationnary phase (see for instance [21], Theorem 3.17) as well Proposition C.3, we finally get\nIs,h \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjIj on B0(s, 2r),(4.9)\nwhere\nIj(x, v) = \u2211\nn1+n2+n3+n4=j\n1\nin1n1!\n( \u2202v\u2032 \u00b7 \u2202\u03b7 )n1( gn2,n3(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7)\u2202v\u2113n4(x, v \u2032) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 v\u2032=v\n\u03b7=0\n.\nWe can already use (4.6) to deduce the expression of \u03c90 by noticing that according to (4.2), \u03c80(x, v, v) = v/2 + \u21130\u2202v\u21130. For j \u2265 1, the terms of Ij in which the function \u2113j appears are obviously the one given by n4 = j, but also the one given by n3 = j according to (4.7). Indeed, in that case, we have using (4.3) that\ng0,j(x, v, v, 0) = i\u21130D\u03b7g0 ( x, v, i(v/2+\u21130\u2202v\u21130) )( \u2202v\u2113j )\n+ iD\u03b7g0 ( x, v, i(v/2 + \u21130\u2202v\u21130) )( \u2202v\u21130 ) \u2113j +R 2 j (\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121)\nwhere R2j : ( C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) )j \u2192 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)).

The term Rj(\u2113 s 0, . . . , \u2113 s j\u22121) from Lemma 4.1 is real valued. Moreover, it satisfies Rj(\u2113 s 0, . . . , \u2113 s j\u22121) = \u2212Rj(\u2212\u2113s0, . . . ,\u2212\u2113sj\u22121).\nIn view of the results from Proposition 3.12 and Lemma 4.1, we want to find \u2113 such that on B0(s, 2r),\nHW \u00b7 \u2207\u21130 +M0 ( x, v, i (v 2 + \u21130 \u2202v\u21130 ))( v + \u21130\u2202v\u21130 ) \u00b7 \u2202v\u21130 = 0(4.12) and for j \u2265 1 [ HW + ( 0\nM0\n( x, v, i ( v 2 + \u21130 \u2202v\u21130 )) (v + \u21130\u2202v\u21130) + \u21130 U\n)] \u00b7 \u2207\u2113j(4.13)\n+\u2202v\u21130 \u00b7 U \u2113j +Rj(\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121) = 0 where U was introduced in (4.10). Note that Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 ensure that the fact that the (\u2113j)j\u22650 are real valued is compatible with equations (4.13).\n4.1. Solving for \u2113s0. Denote p(x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) = i\u03be \u00b7 v \u2212 i\u03b7 \u00b7 \u2202xV + (\u2212i t\u03b7 + tv/2)M0(x, v, \u03b7)(i\u03b7 + v/2) the principal symbol of the whole operator Ph and p\u0303(x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) = \u2212p(x, v, i\u03be, i\u03b7) its complexification. After computing the Hamiltonian of p\u0303 which vanishes at (s, 0, 0, 0), we find that its linearization at this point is the matrix\nF =   0 Id 0 0 \u2212HesssV 0 0 2M0(s, 0, 0)\n0 0 0 HesssV 0 12M0(s, 0, 0) \u2212Id 0\n  .\nOne can easily check that for any eigenvector (x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) of F associated to an eigenvalue \u03bb, the vector (\u2212x, v, \u03be,\u2212\u03b7) is an eigenvector associated to \u2212\u03bb so the spectrum of F is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. Moreover, writing\nF =  \n0 0 Id 0 0 0 0 Id Id 0 0 0 0 Id 0 0\n   \n0 0 0 HesssV 0 12M0(s, 0, 0) \u2212Id 0 0 Id 0 0\n\u2212HesssV 0 0 2M0(s, 0, 0)\n \nand noticing that\nF ( {v = \u03b7 = 0} ) \u2229 {v = \u03b7 = 0} = KerF \u2229 {v = \u03b7 = 0} = {0},\nwe see that F satisfies the assumptions of Lemma B.1. Therefore, F has no eigenvalues in iR so it has 2d eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity) in {Re z > 0} while the 2d others are in {Re z < 0}. Therefore we can apply the stable manifold theorem to get that the stable manifolds associated to Hp\u0303 given in a neighborhood of (s, 0, 0, 0) by\n\u039b\u00b1 = { (x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) ; lim\nt\u2192\u2213\u221e etHp\u0303(x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) = (s, 0, 0, 0)\n}\nare both of dimension 2d and for all \u03c1\u00b1 \u2208 \u039b\u00b1, we have Hp\u0303(\u03c1\u00b1) \u2208 T\u03c1\u00b1\u039b\u00b1(4.14)\nand for t > 0, \u2225\u2225e\u2213tHp\u0303\u03c1\u00b1 \u2212 (s, 0, 0, 0) \u2225\u2225 \u2264 Ce\u2212t/C\u2016\u03c1\u00b1 \u2212 (s, 0, 0, 0)\u2016.\nMoreover, we have (see for instance [4] Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3) that\np\u0303(\u039b\u00b1) = {0}(4.15) and \u039b\u00b1 are Lagrangian manifolds. In order to get some parametrization for those manifolds, we follow the steps of [10], Lemma 8.1.\nLemma 4.4. The tangent spaces T(s,0,0,0)\u039b\u00b1 that we denote for shortness Ts\u039b\u00b1 are transverse to both {(s, 0)} \u00d7 R2d and R2d \u00d7 {(0, 0)}.\nProof. We provide an adaptation of the proof from [10] as some simplifications appear in our case. Since we are working in the linearized case, we can assume that p\u0303 coincides with its quadratic approximation at (s, 0, 0, 0) and for commodity we will work with the variable xs = x \u2212 s instead of x. Note that if a is a quadratic form, its Hamiltonian Ha is then linear and we denote Fa the associated matrix. We then decompose p\u0303 = p2 + p1 \u2212 p0 where\np2 =M0(s, 0, 0)\u03b7 \u00b7 \u03b7, p1 = v \u00b7 \u03be \u2212HesssV xs \u00b7 \u03b7 and p0 = 1\n4 M0(s, 0, 0)v \u00b7 v.\nIt is clear that p2 + p0 is positive semi-definite, moreover, the subspace {v = \u03b7 = 0} on which p2 + p0 vanishes satisfies {v = \u03b7 = 0} \u2229 F\u22121p1 ( {v = \u03b7 = 0} ) = {0}. Thus the quadratic form\nq\u0303 = (p2 + p0) + (p2 + p0) \u25e6 Fp1 is positive definite. Let us denote L\u00b1 = \u039b\u00b1 \u2229 {xs = v = 0}. To prove that L\u00b1 = {0}, it is sufficient to establish that q\u0303 = 0 on L\u00b1. In order to do so, we will show that L\u00b1 is an Fp1 -invariant subspace on which p2 + p0 = 0. Indeed, it is clear that p0 = p1 = 0 on L\u00b1 and thanks to (4.15) we deduce that p2 also vanishes on L\u00b1 so in particular p2 + p0 = 0 on L\u00b1. It also implies that L\u00b1 is included in {\u03b7 = 0} so Fp2 |L\u00b1 = 0. Besides, we clearly have Fp0 |L\u00b1 = 0 so Fp1 coincides on L\u00b1 with Fp\u0303 which leaves \u039b\u00b1 invariant according to (4.14). Since it is easy to see that {xs = v = 0} is also invariant under Fp1 , we can conclude as announced that L\u00b1 = {0}. The proof that \u039b\u00b1 \u2229 {\u03be = \u03b7 = 0} = {0} is similar.\nSince \u039b\u00b1 are Lagrangian manifolds such that Ts\u039b\u00b1 are transverse to {(s, 0)} \u00d7 R2d, there exist \u03c6\u00b1 \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r),R) vanishing together with their gradients at (s, 0) and such that\n\u039b\u00b1 = {( (x, v,\u2207\u03c6\u00b1(x, v) ) ; (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, 2r) } .\nTherefore, Ts\u039b\u00b1 coincide with the graphs of the matrices Hess(s,0)\u03c6\u00b1 which are then invertible according to Lemma 4.4. Now we need a result similar to the one of Proposition 8.2 in [10].\nLemma 4.5. The Hessian matrix of \u00b1\u03c6\u00b1 at (s, 0) is definite positive.\nProof. The proof is simply an adaptation of the one found in [10]. Here again we will assume that p\u0303 coincides with its quadratic approximation at (s, 0, 0, 0) and work with the variable xs = x\u2212 s instead of x. For \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1], let us denote\np\u0303\u03b4 = (1 \u2212 \u03b4)p\u0303+ \u03b4 ( \u03be2 + \u03b72 \u2212 (x2s + v2) )\n= p\u03b42 + (1\u2212 \u03b4)p1 \u2212 p\u03b40 where\np\u03b42 = (1 \u2212 \u03b4)p2 + \u03b4(\u03be2 + \u03b72) and p\u03b40 = (1\u2212 \u03b4)p0 + \u03b4(x2s + v2).\nNote in particular that p\u03030 = p\u0303 and that p\u03031 = ( \u03be2+\u03b72\u2212(x2s+v2) ) corresponds to the well know Schro\u0308dinger case (see for instance [4], chapter 3). Besides, we have that\nFp\u0303\u03b4 =  \n0 0 Id 0 0 0 0 Id Id 0 0 0 0 Id 0 0\n   (1\u2212 \u03b4)  \n0 0 0 HesssV 0 12M0(s, 0, 0) \u2212Id 0 0 Id 0 0\n\u2212HesssV 0 0 2M0(s, 0, 0)\n + 2\u03b4 Id  \nso Lemma B.1 easily yields that the eigenvalues of Fp\u0303\u03b4 cannot cross iR for some \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1]. Moreover, it is clear that for \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1], the quadratic form p\u03b42 + p\u03b40 is positive definite, so the results of Lemma 4.4 are true for the 2d-dimensional Lagrangian planes\n\u039b\u03b4\u00b1 = { (xs, v, \u03be, \u03b7) ; lim\nt\u2192\u2213\u221e etFp\u0303\u03b4 (x, v, \u03be, \u03b7) = 0\n}\nfor all \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1]. In particular, there exist \u03c6\u03b4\u00b1 \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r),R) such that\nTs\u039b \u03b4 \u00b1 = \u039b \u03b4 \u00b1 = {( xs, v,Hess(s,0)\u03c6 \u03b4 \u00b1 ( xs v )) ; (xs, v) \u2208 R2d } .\nHence the graph of Hess(s,0)\u03c6 \u03b4 \u00b1 is given by Ts\u039b \u03b4 \u00b1 which also corresponds to the sum of the generalized eigenspaces of Fp\u0303\u03b4 associated to eigenvalues in {\u00b1Re z < 0} and therefore depends continuously on \u03b4. Besides, by Lemma 4.4, Hess(s,0)\u03c6 \u03b4 \u00b1 is invertible for all \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1] and we know from the Schro\u0308dinger case that \u00b1Hess(s,0)\u03c61\u00b1 > 0 so necessarily \u00b1Hess(s,0)\u03c6\u00b1 > 0.\nAt this point, one can proceed as in [1], Lemma 3.2 to establish the following Lemma.\nLemma 4.6. There exists \u2113s0 \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r),R) such that for (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, 2r),\n\u03c6+(x, v) =W (x, v)\u2212W (s, 0) + \u2113s0(x, v) 2\n2 .\nIn particular, \u2113s0 vanishes at (s, 0). Moreover, {\u2113s0 6= 0} is dense in B0(s, 2r).\nThis function also appears to solve (4.12) as we see in the next Proposition.\nProposition 4.7. The function \u2113s0 from Lemma 4.6 is a solution of (4.12) in B0(s, 2r). Moreover, the\nvector \u2207\u2113s0(s, 0) that we denote \u03bds = ( \u03bds1 \u03bds2 ) is not 0 and satisfies \u03a6s\u03bds = ( \u2212M0(s, 0, 0)\u03bds2 \u00b7 \u03bds2 ) \u03bds, where\n\u03a6s = ( 0 \u2212HesssV Id M0(s, 0, 0) ) .\nIn particular, since \u03a6s is invertible, \u03bds2 6= 0. Finally,\ndet ( Hess(s,0) ( W + (\u2113s0) 2\n2\n)) = 2\u22122d \u2223\u2223 det(HesssV ) \u2223\u2223.\nProof. The proof is the same as in [1], Lemma 3.3 after matching the notations by setting \u039b(s) = \u03a6s, b0 = HW ,\nA0(s) = ( 0 0 0 M0(s, 0, 0) ) and B(s) = ( 0 Id \u2212HesssV 0 ) .\n4.2. Solving for ( \u2113sj ) j\u22651 . Once again we drop some exponents s for shortness. Now that \u21130 is given by Lemma 4.6 and Proposition 4.7, we can solve the transport equations (4.13) by induction, so we suppose that \u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121 are given and we want to find a solution \u2113j to (4.13). Denote\nU\u0303 = HW +\n( 0\nM0\n( x, v, i ( v 2 + \u21130 \u2202v\u21130 )) (v + \u21130\u2202v\u21130) + \u21130U\n) \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r))\nand \u03b1 = \u2202v\u21130 \u00b7 U \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) where U was introduced in (4.10). The function \u2113j must satisfy (U\u0303 \u00b7 \u2207+ \u03b1)\u2113j = \u2212Rj(\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121) so we are intersted in the operaor L = U\u0303 \u00b7 \u2207+ \u03b1 that we decompose as L = Ls0 + L> with\nLs0 = U\u0303 s0 ( x\u2212 s v ) \u00b7 \u2207+ \u03b1s0\nwhere U\u0303 s0 is the differential of U\u0303 at (s, 0) and \u03b1 s 0 = \u03b1(s, 0), that is\nU\u0303 s0 =\n( 0 Id\n\u2212HesssV + 2M0(s, 0, 0)\u03bds2 t\u03bds1 M0(s, 0, 0)(Id + 2\u03bds2 t\u03bds2)\n)\nand\n\u03b1s0 =M0(s, 0, 0)\u03bd s 2 \u00b7 \u03bds2 .(4.16) As usual, we will often omitt the exponents s in the notations. Notice that if we denote Pnhom the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree n in the variables (x \u2212 s, v), we have L0 \u2208 L (Pnhom) and for P \u2208 Pnhom, L>P (x, v) = O ( (x\u2212 s, v)n+1 ) near (s, 0).\nLemma 4.8. The negative eigenvalue \u2212\u03b1s0 of the matrix \u03a6s from Proposition 4.7 is its only one (counting multiplicity) in {Re z \u2264 0}. Moreover, all the eigenvalues of U\u0303 s0 have positive real part and the operator Ls0 is invertible on Pnhom. Proof. It is sufficient to prove the first statement. Indeed, if \u2212\u03b10 is the only eigenvalue of \u03a6 in {Re z \u2264 0}, we can then remark that\ntU\u03030 = \u03a6+ 2\n( 0 \u03bd1\nt\u03bd2M0(s, 0, 0) 0 \u03bd2 t\u03bd2M0(s, 0, 0)\n)\nand since the last term has its range included in C\u03bd and sends \u03bd on 2\u03b10\u03bd, the matrix of tU\u03030 in a basis (\u03bd, b2, . . . , b2d) in which \u03a6 becomes triangular is also triangular and has on its diagonal the eigenvalues of \u03a6 except for \u2212\u03b10 which is replaced by +\u03b10. Hence Spec(U\u03030) = Spec(tU\u03030) \u2282 {Re z > 0} and we can conclude thanks to Lemma A.1 from [1]. Let us then prove that \u2212\u03b10 is the only eigenvalue (counting multiplicity) of \u03a6 in {Re z \u2264 0}. We proceed as in [1], Lemma 2.6. For t \u2208 [0, 1], consider the matrix\n\u03a6t = 2HesssW ( (1\u2212 t)Id \u2212tId tId tM0(s, 0, 0) + (1 \u2212 t)Id )\nwhich trivially satisfies the assumptions of Lemma B.1 for t \u2208 [0, 1). It is also the case of \u03a61 as \u03a61(x, 0) = (0, x). Hence for every t \u2208 [0, 1], \u03a6t has no eigenvalues in iR and since these eigenvalues depend continuously on t, we get that\n# ( Spec\u03a61 \u2229 {Re z < 0} ) = # ( Spec\u03a60 \u2229 {Re z < 0} ) .\nBut \u03a60 = 2HesssW has exactly one negative eigenvalue (with multiplicity) while all the others are positive since s \u2208 U (1), so we have indeed showed that \u2212\u03b10 is the only eigenvalue of \u03a6 = \u03a61 (counting multiplicity) in {Re z \u2264 0}.\nOne can then proceed as in [1], section 3.3 (see also [4], chapter 3), i.e use Lemma 4.8 to find an approximate solution of (4.13) using formal power series and then refine it into an actual solution using again Lemma 4.8 as well as the characteristic method. We then get the following result.\nProposition 4.9. For all j \u2265 1, there exists \u2113sj \u2208 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) solving (4.13). Moreover, \u2113sj is real valued in view of Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3.\n5. Computation of the small eigenvalues\nNow that we have found (\u2113j)j\u22650 \u2282 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r),R) solving (4.12) and (4.13) with \u21130 vanishing at (s, 0), we can use a Borel procedure to construct \u2113 \u2208 C\u221e(R2d,R) supported in B0(s, 3r) and satisfying \u2113 \u223c\u2211j\u22650 \u2113j on B0(s, 2r).\nRemark 5.1. The properties a)-c) from (3.5) are satisfied by both the functions \u2113s,h and \u2212\u2113s,h. Moreover, by Lemma 4.3, (\u2212\u2113sj)j\u22650 also solve (4.12) and (4.13).\nWe are now in position to prove that all the properties from (3.5) are satisfied.\nProposition 5.2. We can choose the signs of the functions (\u2113s,h)j(m) such that (3.5) holds true and the coefficients from the classical expansion of \u2113s,h solve (4.12) and (4.13).\nProof. Recall that by item b) from Hypothesis 3.10, each function \u2113s,h corresponds to a unique m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}. Thanks to Lemmas 4.5 and 4.6, it is clear that item d) from (3.5) is satisfied by both \u2113s,h and \u2212\u2113s,h. Hence according to Remark 5.1, it is sufficient to prove that the signs of (\u2113s,h)j(m) can be chosen so that \u03b8m,h is smooth on a neighborhood of supp \u03c7m. From (3.7), (3.8) and (3.9) we see that the only parts on which it is not clear that \u03b8m,h is smooth are\nF1 = \u2294\ns\u2208j(m)\n( {|\u2113s0| \u2264 2\u03b3} \u2229 \u2202B0(s, r) ) , F2 = \u2294\ns\u2208j(m)\n( B0(s, r) \u2229 {|\u2113s0| = 2\u03b3} )\nand F3 = \u2202 ( E(m) +B(0, \u03b5) ) \\ ( \u2294\ns\u2208j(m)\n( B0(s, r) \u2229 {|\u2113s0| \u2264 2\u03b3} )) .\nLet s \u2208 j(m) and (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, r)\\{(s, 0)} such that \u2113s0(x, v) = 0. Using Lemma 4.6, we see that if r > 0 is small enough,\nW (x, v) \u2212W (s, 0) = \u03c6+(x, v) > 0(5.1) because (s, 0) is a non degenerate local minimum of \u03c6+. Hence, {\u2113s0 = 0} \u2229 B0(s, r) \u2282 {W \u2265 \u03c3(m)}. Now assume by contradiction that for any r > 0, the function \u2113s0 takes both positive and negative values on E(m)\u2229B0(s, r). Then according to Lemma 3.1, the two CCs of Ur \u2229 {W < \u03c3(m)} are both included in E(m) (the one on which \u2113s0 > 0 and the one where \u2113 s 0 < 0). This is a contradiction with the fact that s \u2208 V(1). Therefore \u2113s0 has a sign on E(m)\u2229B0(s, r) and we can choose it so that \u2113s0 is a positive function on E(m) \u2229B0(s, r). By uniform continuity, we can then choose \u03b5(\u03b3) > 0 small enough so that((\nE(m) +B(0, \u03b5) ) \u2229B0(s, r) ) \u2286 { \u2113s0 \u2265 \u2212\u03b3 } .(5.2)\nSimilarly, if we denote \u2126s the other CC of {W < \u03c3(m)} which contains (s, 0) on its boundary, we have since (s, 0) is not a critical point of \u2113s0 that this function is negative on \u2126s \u2229B0(s, r) and((\n\u2126s +B(0, \u03b5) ) \u2229B0(s, r) ) \u2286 { \u2113s0 \u2264 \u03b3 } .(5.3)\nChoosing once again \u03b5(r) small enough, we can even assume that ( E(m) +B(0, \u03b5) \u2229 \u2126s +B(0, \u03b5) ) \u2286 B0(s, r).(5.4)\nWe first prove that F1 does not meet the support of \u03c7m. Recall that \u2126 denotes the CC of {W \u2264 \u03c3(m)} containing m. For s \u2208 j(m), we can deduce from (5.1) that if (x, v) \u2208 \u2202B0(s, r) such that \u2113s0(x, v) = 0, then (x, v) /\u2208 \u2126. Hence |\u2113s0| must attain a positive minimum on \u2202B0(s, r) \u2229\u2126, so we can choose \u03b3(r) > 0 such that \u2202B0(s, r) \u2229 {|\u2113s0| \u2264 2\u03b3} does not intersect \u2126. It follows that we can choose \u03b5(\u03b3) > 0 such that\nF1 \u2286 ( R 2d\\\u2126+B(0, \u03b5) ) \u2286 ( R 2d\\supp\u03c7m ) .\nNow we show that \u03b8m,h is smooth on F2 \u2229 (\u2126 + B(0, \u03b5)): let s \u2208 j(m) and (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, r) \u2229 {\u2113s0 = 2\u03b3} \u2229 (\u2126 + B(0, \u03b5)). According to (5.3) and the fact that \u2113s,h = \u2113s0 + O(h), there exists a small ball B centered in (x, v) such that\nB \u2282 ( B0(s, r) \u2229 {\u2113s,h > \u03b3} \u2229 ( E(m) +B(0, \u03b5) )) .\nThus \u03b8m,h = 1 on B and \u03b8m,h is smooth at (x, v). Similarly, for (x, v) \u2208 B0(s, r) \u2229 {\u2113s,h = \u22122\u03b3} \u2229 (\u2126 + B(0, \u03b5)), we can show that \u03b8m,h = 0 in a neighborhood of (x, v). It only remains to prove that, as for F1, the set F3 does not meet the support of \u03c7m. First we remark that thanks to (5.2), we can forget the absolute value in the definition of F3:\nF3 = \u2202 ( E(m) +B(0, \u03b5) ) \\ ( \u2294\nj(m)\n( B0(s, r) \u2229 {\u2113s0 \u2264 2\u03b3} )) .\nIf (x, v) \u2208 F3\u2229B0(s, r), we have that \u2113s0(x, v) > 2\u03b3 so using (5.3), we see that (x, v) is outside \u2126s+B(0, \u03b5). Since it is not in (E(m) + B(0, \u03b5)) either, it is outside \u2126 + B(0, \u03b5) which contains the support of \u03c7m. Now if (x, v) \u2208 F3\\ ( jW (m)+B0(0, r) ) , (5.4) implies that (x, v) is outside \u222aj(m)(\u2126s+B(0, \u03b5)) so it is also outside \u2126 +B(0, \u03b5) for \u03b5 small enough and the proof is complete.\nLemma 5.3. Let m \u2208 U (0)\\{m} and denote f\u0303m,h = fm,h/\u2016fm,h\u2016 where fm,h was defined in (3.11). With the notation (4.16), we have that\n\u3008Phf\u0303m,h, f\u0303m,h\u3009 = he\u22122 S(m) h det(HessmV )\n1/2\n2\u03c0 B\u0303h(m) \u2208 R\nwith B\u0303h(m) admitting a classical expansion whose first term equals \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2 \u03b1s0.\nProof. Since Xh0 is a skew-adjoint differential operator and fm,h is real valued, we have\n\u3008Xh0 fm,h, fm,h\u3009 = 0. Besides, we know from (3.16) that\nbhfm,h = h(\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h +OL2(h \u221ee\u2212S(m)/h)(5.5)\nso we easily deduce from the fact that (\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h = OL2(e \u2212S(m)/h) and the boundedness of Oph(M h) that\n\u3008Qhfm,h, fm,h\u3009 = h2 \u2329 Oph(M h) ( (\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h ) , (\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h \u232a +O ( h\u221ee\u2212 2S(m) h ) .\nSince we have with the notation (3.13)\n(\u2202v\u03b8)\u03c7e \u2212Wm/h = A\u22121h 2 e\u2212W\u0303m/h\u03c7 \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n\u03b6(\u2113s)\u2202v\u2113 s 1B0(s,r)\nand using (3.21) with M instead of g, we get that\n\u3008Phfm,h, fm,h\u3009 = h2\n4 A\u22122h\n\u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n\u222b\nB0(s,r)\ne\u22122W\u0303m(x,v)/h\u03c7\u03b6(\u2113s)I\u0303s(x, v) \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113s d(x, v)(5.6)\n+O ( h\u221ee\u22122 S(m) h ) .\nwhere I\u0303s(x, v) = (2\u03c0h)\u2212d \u222b\nRd\n\u222b\n|v\u2032|\u2264r\ne i h\u03b7\u00b7(v\u2212v \u2032)\u03c7(x, v\u2032)\u03b6 ( \u2113s(x, v\u2032) ) M ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u2202v\u2113 s(x, v\u2032) dv\u2032d\u03b7.\nMimicking the proof of Proposition C.5, one can show that \u03b6(\u2113) admits a classical expansion whose first term is \u03b6(\u21130). Besides, since M and \u03c8 also have a classical expansion, we could use the stationnary phase\n(see for instance [21], Theorem 3.17) as well Proposition C.3 to get an expansion of I\u0303 similar to the one obtained in (4.9). Thus, we get that I\u0303 \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113 \u223c \u2211 k\u22650 h kak where\na0(x, v) = \u03c7(x, v)\u03b6 ( \u21130(x, v) ) M0 ( x, v, i (v 2 + \u21130 \u2202v\u21130 )) \u2202v\u21130(x, v) \u00b7 \u2202v\u21130(x, v).\nHence, using the fact that on B0(s, r),\nW\u0303 \u2212 S(m) =Wm + \u211320 2 \u2212 S(m) + (\u21132 2 \u2212 \u2113 2 0 2 ) ,\nit is clear that\ne2S(m)/h \u222b\nB0(s,r) e\u22122W\u0303 (x,v)/h\u03c7\u03b6(\u2113)I\u0303(x, v) \u00b7 \u2202v\u2113 d(x, v) \u223ch(5.7) \u2211\nk\u22650\nhk \u222b\nB0(s,r)\ne\u22122 Wm(x,v)+\u2113\n2 0(x,v)/2\u2212S(m) h e\u2212 (\u21132\u2212\u211320)(x,v)\nh \u03c7\u03b6(\u2113)ak d(x, v).\nWe would like to apply Proposition C.7 so we need to check that the assumptions are satisfied. First, Hess(s,0)(Wm+\u2113 2 0/2) is definite positive by Lemma 4.5. Besides, h\n\u22121(\u21132\u2212\u211320) admits a classical expansion whose first term is 2(\u21131\u21130). Therefore, using the expansion of \u03b6(\u2113) as well as Proposition C.5, one easily gets that the function\ne\u2212 (\u21132\u2212\u211320) h ( \u03b6 \u25e6 \u2113 )\nadmits a classical expansion whose first term is e\u22122(\u21131\u21130) ( \u03b6 \u25e6 \u21130 ) . Thus, according to Propositions C.7 and 4.7, there exists (bk,j) such that\n| det(HesssV )|1/2 (2\u03c0h)d\n\u222b\nB0(s,r)\ne\u22122 Wm(x,v)+\u2113\n2 0(x,v)/2\u2212S(m) h e\u2212 (\u21132\u2212\u211320)(x,v) h \u03c7\u03b6(\u2113)ak d(x, v) \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjbk,j\nwhere bk,0 = ak(s, 0). Hence, using (5.6), (5.7) and Proposition C.3, we deduce that\n4A2h(2\u03c0) \u2212dh\u2212d\u22122e2S(m)/h\u3008Phfm,h, fm,h\u3009 \u223c\n\u2211\nk\u22650\nhkck(5.8)\nwith\nc0 = \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2M0(s, 0, 0)\u03bds2 \u00b7 \u03bds2 = \u2211\ns\u2208j(m)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2 \u03b1s0.\nSimilarly, thanks to item a) from Hypothesis 3.10, one can use Proposition C.7 as we already did to see that there exists (c\u0303k)k\u22650 such that\ndet(HessmV) 1/2\n(2\u03c0h)d \u2016fm,h\u20162 \u223c\n\u2211\nk\u22650\nhkc\u0303k(5.9)\nwith c\u03030 = 1. The conclusion follows from (5.8), (3.6) and (5.9).\nLemma 5.4. Let m \u2208 U (0)\\{m}. Using the notations from Lemma 5.3, we have i) \u2016Phf\u0303m,h\u20162 = O(h\u221e\u3008Phf\u0303m,h, f\u0303m,h\u3009) ii) \u2016P \u2217h f\u0303m,h\u20162 = O(h\u3008Ph f\u0303m,h, f\u0303m,h\u3009).\nProof. To prove i), first remark that thanks to (3.15)-(3.18) we have \u222b\nR2d\\(jW (m)+B0(0,2r))\n|Phfm,h(x, v)|2d(x, v) = O ( h\u221ee\u22122 S(m) h ) .(5.10)\nBesides, we saw that thanks to Proposition C.7 and Lemma 4.5, we have for s \u2208 j(m), \u222b\nB0(s,2r)\ne\u22122 W\u0303 (x,v) h d(x, v) = O ( hde\u22122 S(m) h ) .\nMoreover, the function \u03c9 from Proposition 3.12 is OL\u221e(B0(s,2r))(h \u221e) by Lemma 4.1 and the construction of the (\u2113s,h)s\u2208j(m). Hence, by Proposition 3.12, \u222b\nB0(s,2r)\n|Phfm,h(x, v)|2d(x, v) = O ( h\u221ee\u22122 S(m) h ) .(5.11)\nThe conclusion follows from (5.10), (5.11) as well as (5.9) and Lemma 5.3. The proof of ii) can be obtained similarly with the use of Proposition C.7 and Remark 3.13 after noticing that \u2217 \u03c9 also admits a classical expansion whose first term vanishes on jW (m).\nFrom now on, we denote\n\u03bb\u0303m,h = \u3008Phf\u0303m,h, f\u0303m,h\u3009 = \u3008Qhf\u0303m,h, f\u0303m,h\u3009(5.12)\nfor which we computed a classical expansion in Lemma 5.3.\nLemma 5.5. For m and m\u2032 two distinct elements of U (0), we have\ni) \u3008Phf\u0303m,h, f\u0303m\u2032,h\u3009 = O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0303m,h\u03bb\u0303m\u2032,h )\nii) There exists c > 0 such that \u3008f\u0303m,h, f\u0303m\u2032,h\u3009 = O(e\u2212c/h)\nProof. i): The result is obvious when one of the two minima is m. Recall the labeling of the minima that we introduced rigth before Hypothesis 3.10 as well as the map \u03c0x from Lemma 3.8. Let us first suppose that m = mk,j and m\n\u2032 = mk,j\u2032 with j 6= j\u2032 and k 6= 1 and denote E = E(m) and E\u2032 = E(m\u2032). In particular \u03c3(m) = \u03c3(m\u2032). Thanks to (3.12) and the fact that Ph is local in x, we have\nsuppPhf\u0303m,h \u2286 ( \u03c0x(E) \u00d7 Rdv ) +B(0, \u03b5\u2032) and supp f\u0303m\u2032,h \u2286 ( E\u2032 +B(0, \u03b5\u2032) )\nso up to taking \u03b5\u2032 small enough, it is sufficient to show that \u03c0x(E)\u00d7 Rdv and E\u2032 do not intersect. Since our labeling is adapted, E and E\u2032 are two distinct CCs of {W < \u03c3(m)} so by Lemma 3.8, \u03c0x(E) \u00d7 Rdv and E\u2032 are two disjoint open sets. Thus, using successively Remark 3.7 and (3.2), we get\n\u03c0x(E)\u00d7 Rdv \u2229 E\u2032 = ( \u2202 ( \u03c0x(E) ) \u00d7 Rdv ) \u2229 \u2202E\u2032\n\u2286 ( \u2202 ( \u03c0x(E) ) \u00d7 {0} ) \u2229 \u2202E\u2032 \u2286 ( \u2202 ( \u03c0x(E) ) \u2229 \u2202 ( \u03c0x(E \u2032) )) \u00d7 {0}.\nwhich is empty thanks to Lemma 3.2 and item b) from Hypothesis 3.10. Let us now treat the case m = mk,j and m \u2032 = mk\u2032,j\u2032 with k, k \u2032 \u2265 2 and k 6= k\u2032. We can suppose that k < k\u2032 (i.e \u03c3(m) > \u03c3(m\u2032)) because we can work with P \u2217h instead of Ph if needed. We decompose Phf\u0303m,h as in (3.15) and (3.16) and once again we use (3.12) to get\nsupp f\u0303m\u2032,h \u2286 ( E\u2032 +B(0, \u03b5\u2032) ) \u2286 { W < \u03c3(m) + \u03c3(m\u2032)\n2\n}\nas well as the fact that Ph is local in x to get a localization of the support of the first term from (3.16):\nsupp ( Oph(g) ( (\u2202v\u03b8m)\u03c7me \u2212Wm/h )) \u2286 (( j(m) +B(0, r) ) \u00d7 Rdv ) \u2286 { W > \u03c3(m) + \u03c3(m\u2032)\n2\n}\nasW increases with the norm of v. Hence, the support of the first term from (3.16) does not meet the one\nof f\u0303m\u2032,h. The same goes easily for the first term of (3.15). For the second term of (3.15), its support is contained in the support of \u2207\u03c7m which is itself contained in {W \u2265 \u03c3(m)+ \u03b5\u0303} so it clearly does not meet the support of f\u0303m\u2032,h. It only remains to treat the second term from (3.16), i.e Oph(g) ( \u03b8m(\u2202v\u03c7m)e \u2212Wm/h ) . To this aim, notice that (5.5) yields bhfm\u2032,h = OL2(e \u2212S(m\u2032)/h) and since by the support properties of\n\u2207\u03c7m we also have \u03b8m(\u2202v\u03c7m)e\u2212Wm/h = OL2(h\u221ee\u2212S(m)/h), we get using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the boundedness of Oph(M)\u2329\nOph(g) ( \u03b8m(\u2202v\u03c7m)e \u2212Wm/h ) , fm\u2032,h \u232a = \u2329 Oph(M) ( \u03b8m(\u2202v\u03c7m)e \u2212Wm/h ) , bhfm\u2032,h \u232a\n= O ( h\u221ee\u2212 S(m)+S(m\u2032) h )\nwhich proves the first item. ii): Here we can suppose that V (m) \u2265 V (m\u2032). Let us first treat the case where V (m) = V (m\u2032). Then according to item a) from Hypothesis 3.10, E and E\u2032 are two disjoint open sets. Hence, as we saw earlier, Lemma 3.2 and item b) from Hypothesis 3.10 imply that E \u2229 E\u2032 = \u2205. The conclusion then follows from (3.12). If V (m) > V (m\u2032), then item a) from Hypothesis 3.10 implies that (m, 0) is the only global minimum of W |E+B(0,\u03b5\u2032). Therefore using (3.12), we can easily compute\n\u3008fm,h, fm\u2032,h\u3009 = \u222b\nE+B(0,\u03b5\u2032)\n\u03b8m\u03b8m\u2032\u03c7m\u03c7m\u2032e \u2212 2V \u2212V (m)\u2212V (m\n\u2032)+v2 2h d(x, v) = O ( e\u2212 V (m)\u2212V (m\u2032) 2h ) .\nThe conclusion immediately follows from (5.9).\nLet us consider once again the spectral projection introduced in (2.4). We saw in particular that \u03a00 = O(1).\nLemma 5.6. For any m \u2208 U (0), we have\n\u2016(1\u2212\u03a00)f\u0303m,h\u2016 = O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0303m,h ) and \u2016(1\u2212\u03a0\u22170)f\u0303m,h\u2016 = O ( h\u22123/2 \u221a \u03bb\u0303m,h ) .\nProof. We simply recall the proof from [12]: we write\n(1\u2212\u03a00)f\u0303m,h = 1\n2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n|z|=ch2\n( z\u22121 \u2212 (z \u2212 Ph)\u22121 ) f\u0303m,hdz\n= \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n|z|=ch2 z\u22121(z \u2212 Ph)\u22121Phf\u0303m,hdz.\nWe can then conclude using Lemma 5.4 and the resolvent estimate from Theorem 1.6. The proof for the adjoint is almost identical.\nLemma 5.7. The family (\u03a00f\u0303m,h)m\u2208U(0) is almost orthonormal: there exists c > 0 such that\n\u3008\u03a00f\u0303m,h,\u03a00f\u0303m\u2032,h\u3009 = \u03b4m,m\u2032 +O(e\u2212c/h). In particular, it is a basis of the space H = Ran\u03a00 introduced in (2.4). Moreover, we have\n\u3008Ph\u03a00f\u0303m,h,\u03a00f\u0303m\u2032,h\u3009 = \u03b4m,m\u2032 \u03bb\u0303m,h +O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0303m,h\u03bb\u0303m\u2032,h ) .\nProof. The proof is the same as the one of Proposition 4.10 in [12].\nLet us re-label the local minimam1, . . . ,mn0 so that (S(mj))j=1,...,n0 is non increasing in j. For shortness, we will now denote\nf\u0303j = f\u0303mj ,h and \u03bb\u0303j = \u03bb\u0303mj ,h\nwhich still depend on h. Note in particular that according to Lemma 5.3, \u03bb\u0303j = O(\u03bb\u0303k) whenever 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2264 n0. We also denote (u\u0303j)j=1,...,n0 the orthogonalization by the Gram-Schmidt procedure of the family (\u03a00f\u0303j)j=1,...,n0 and\nuj = u\u0303j\n\u2016u\u0303j\u2016 .\nIn this setting and with our previous results, we get the following (see [12], Proposition 4.12 for a proof).\nLemma 5.8. For all 1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 n0, it holds\n\u3008Phuj , uk\u3009 = \u03b4j,k\u03bb\u0303j +O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0303j \u03bb\u0303k ) .\nIn order to compute the small eigenvalues of Ph, let us now consider the restriction Ph|H : H \u2192 H . We denote u\u0302j = un0\u2212j+1, \u03bb\u0302j = \u03bb\u0303n0\u2212j+1 and M the matrix of Ph|H in the orthonormal basis (u\u03021, . . . , u\u0302n0). Since u\u0302n0 = u1 = f\u03031, we have\nM = ( M\u2032 0 0 0 ) where M\u2032 = ( \u3008Phu\u0302j, u\u0302k\u3009 ) 1\u2264j,k\u2264n0\u22121\nand it is sufficient to study the spectrum of M\u2032. We will also denote {S\u03021 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < S\u0302p} the set {S(mj) ; 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n0} and for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p, Ek the subspace of L2(R2d) generated by {u\u0302r ; S(mr) = S\u0302k}. Finally, we set \u031fk = e \u2212(S\u0302k\u2212S\u0302k\u22121)/h for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 p and \u03b5j(\u031f) = \u220fj k=2\u031fk = e\n\u2212(S\u0302j\u2212S\u03021)/h for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 p (with the convention \u03b51(\u031f) = 1).\nProposition 5.9. There exists a diagonal matrix M#h admitting a classical expansion whose first term is\nM#0 = diag\n( \u2211\ns\u2208j(mn0\u2212j+1)\ndet(Hessmn0\u2212j+1V ) 1/2\n2\u03c0| det(HesssV )|1/2 \u03b1s0 ; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0 \u2212 1\n)\nsuch that\nh\u22121e2S\u03021/hM\u2032 = \u2126(\u031f) ( M#h +O(h \u221e) ) \u2126(\u031f)\nwhere \u2126(\u031f) = diag ( \u03b51(\u031f)IdE1 , . . . , \u03b5p(\u031f)IdEp ) .\nRemark 5.10. In the words of Definition 6.7 from [1], the last Proposition implies that h\u22121e2S\u03021/hM\u2032 is a classical graded symmetric matrix.\nProof. According to Lemma 5.8, we can decompose M\u2032 = M\u20321 +M\u20322 with\nM\u20321 = diag(\u03bb\u0302j ; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0 \u2212 1) and M\u20322 = ( O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0302j \u03bb\u0302k )) 1\u2264j,k\u2264n0\u22121 .\nWe will take M#h = h \u22121e2S\u03021/h\u2126(\u031f)\u22121M\u20321\u2126(\u031f)\u22121 which is clearly diagonal, so we just need to check that it has the proper classical expansion and that h\u22121e2S\u03021/h\u2126(\u031f)\u22121M\u20322\u2126(\u031f)\u22121 = O(h\u221e). It is easy to compute\nh\u22121e2S\u03021/h\u2126(\u031f)\u22121M\u20321\u2126(\u031f)\u22121 = h\u22121diag ( e2S\u0302j\u2032/h\u03bb\u0302j ; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0 \u2212 1 )\nwhere 1 \u2264 j\u2032 \u2264 p is such that S\u0302j\u2032 = S(mn0\u2212j+1). Hence Lemma 5.3 yields\nh\u22121e2S\u03021/h\u2126(\u031f)\u22121M\u20321\u2126(\u031f)\u22121 = diag ( det(Hessmn0\u2212j+1V ) 1/2\n2\u03c0 B\u0303h(mn0\u2212j+1) ; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n0 \u2212 1\n)\nwhere B\u0303h(mn0\u2212j+1) was introduced in Lemma 5.3 and admits a classical expansion whose first term is \u2211\ns\u2208j(mn0\u2212j+1)\n| det(HesssV )|\u22121/2 \u03b1s0\nso M#h has the desired expansion. Similarly, still using Lemma 5.3, one easily gets\n\u2126(\u031f)\u22121M\u20322\u2126(\u031f)\u22121 = ( O ( h\u221e \u221a \u03bb\u0302j \u03bb\u0302k \u03b5j\u2032(\u031f) \u22121\u03b5k\u2032(\u031f) \u22121 ))\n1\u2264j,k\u2264n0\u22121\nwhere 1 \u2264 j\u2032 \u2264 p and 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 p are such that \u221a \u03bb\u0302j \u03b5j\u2032(\u031f) \u22121 and \u221a \u03bb\u0302k \u03b5k\u2032(\u031f) \u22121 are both O( \u221a h e\u2212S\u03021/h) so the proof is complete.\nProof of Theorem 1.7. According to Remark 5.10, it now suffices to combine the result of Proposition 5.9 with Theorem 4 from [1] which gives a description of the spectrum of classical graded almost symmetric matrices. Indeed, using the notations from this reference, we have for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p that\nJ \u25e6 Rj ( M#h +O(h \u221e) ) = J \u25e6 Rj ( M#h ) +O(h\u221e)\nand the result comes easily since M#h is diagonal. Therefore, we have actually proved that Bh(m) from Theorem 1.7 and B\u0303h(m) from Lemma 5.3 have the same classical expansion.\n6. Return to equilibrium and metastability\nThe goal of this section is to prove Corollaries 1.8 and 1.9. We assume that the hypotheses of Theorem 1.7 are satisfied and we choose m\u2217 among the elements of U (0)\\{m} for which S is maximal such that the expansion of det(Hessm\u2217V ) 1/2Bh(m \u2217) is minimal. According to Lemma 5.3 and Theorem 1.7, one can think of \u03bbm\u2217,h as the non zero eigenvalue of Ph with the smallest real part modulo O(h \u221ee\u22122S(m\n\u2217)/h). We will denote P1 the orthogonal projection on Ker Ph and for shortness \u03bb \u2217 instead of \u03bbm\u2217,h.\nProof of Corollary 1.8. We follow the proof of Theorem 1.11 in [12]. We have that\n\u2016e\u2212tPh/h \u2212 P1\u2016 \u2264 \u2016e\u2212tPh/h\u03a00 \u2212 P1\u2016+ \u2016e\u2212tPh/h(1\u2212\u03a00)\u2016. and thanks to Proposition 2.8 and Proposition 2.1 from [8], we easily get\ne\u2212tPh/h(1\u2212\u03a00) = O(e\u2212cht). Thus it suffices for the first statement to prove that\n\u2016e\u2212tPh/h\u03a00 \u2212 P1\u2016 \u2264 CN e\u2212Re\u03bb \u2217(1\u2212CNh N )t/h.\nWe recall that thanks to the resolvent estimates from Theorem 1.6, \u03a00 = O(1) and since P1 is an orthogonal projection on Ker Ph, we have that\ne\u2212tPh/h\u03a00 \u2212 P1 = e\u2212tPh/h(\u03a00 \u2212 P1) and (\u03a00 \u2212 P1) = O(1). Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that\n\u2016e\u2212tPh/h|Ran(\u03a00\u2212P1)\u2016 \u2264 CNe\u2212Re\u03bb \u2217(1\u2212CNh N )t/h.(6.1) Besides, we saw in Section 2 that Ker Ph = CMh where Mh was defined in (1.2) and since the operator \u03a00 from (2.4) satisfies \u03a0 \u2217 0Mh = Mh, we get that M\u22a5h is invariant under \u03a00 so Ran(\u03a00\u2212P1) = H \u2229M\u22a5h . Thus, with the notations from Proposition 5.9 and according to (6.1), it only remains to show that\n\u2016e\u2212tM\u2032/h\u2016 \u2264 CNe\u2212Re\u03bb \u2217(1\u2212CNh N )t/h.\nThis can be done following the steps of [12], proof of Theorem 1.11 as with the notation (5.12) we have Re\u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb\u0303m\u2217,h(1 + CNhN ). The only difference is that here we have to apply the resolvent estimates given by Theorem 4 from [1] instead of the ones given by Theorem A.4 from [12]. For the last statement, we now asume that for m \u2208 U (0)\\{m\u2217}, the expansion of \u03bb(m, h) given by Theorem 1.7 differs from the one of \u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb(m\u2217, h). In that case, it is clear that \u03bb\u2217 is a simple eigenvalue but it also happens to be a real one. Indeed, using the fact that Xh0 and bh are differential operators with real coefficients and that Mh is real valued and even in the variable \u03b7, we get that \u03bb is an eigenvalue of Ph if and only if \u03bb is an eigenvalue of Ph. The rest of the proof is then also similar to the end of the proof of Theorem 1.11 from [12].\nFinally, the proof of Corollary 1.9 is a straightforward adaptation of the one of Corollary 1.6 from [1]. (Note that our notations t\u2212k and t + k differ from that in [1]).\nAcknowledgements.

Proof of Lemma 1.4\nLet us begin by showing that there exists a self-adjoint operator A sucht that\n\u033a(H0) = b \u2217 h \u25e6A \u25e6 bh.(A.1)\nSince \u033a(0) = 0, there exists an analytic function \u02dc\u033a such that \u033a(z) = z \u02dc\u033a(z) and | \u02dc\u033a(z)| \u2264 C\u3008z\u3009\u22121. Using Cauchy\u2019s formula, one easily gets that for all z0 \u2208 {Re z > \u2212 12C } and f an analytic function on {Re z > \u2212 1C } satisfying f(z) = O(\u3008z\u3009\u2212\u03b2) for some \u03b2 > 0, we have that\nf(z0) = \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\nf(z)(z0 \u2212 z)\u22121dz.(A.2)\nWorking with a Hilbert basis of eigenfunctions of H0, this identity yields\nf(H0) = \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\nf(z)(H0 \u2212 z)\u22121dz.(A.3)\nBesides, denoting\nbh =   b1h ... bdh   ,\nwe have bhH0 = (b j hH0)1\u2264j\u2264d and using the identity b j hH0 = b \u2217 hbhb j h + hb j h, we get bhH0 = H1bh where\nH1 =   H0 + h . . .\nH0 + h\n  .(A.4)\nIn particular, if u is an eigenfunction of H0 associated to a positive eigenvalue, the function bhu is an eigenfunction of H1 associated to the same eigenvalue and therefore H0(H0 \u2212 z)\u22121 = b\u2217h(H1 \u2212 z)\u22121bh.(A.5) It follows using (A.3) with f = \u02dc\u033a that (A.1) holds with A = \u02dc\u033a(H0 + h)\u2297 Id:\n\u033a(H0) = H0 \u02dc\u033a(H0) = b \u2217 h \u25e6 \u02dc\u033a(H0 + h)\u2297 Id \u25e6 bh.\nWe can improve the integrability in the integral representation of \u02dc\u033a(H0 + h) by writing\n\u02dc\u033a(z) = \u02dc\u033a(z) 1 + z + \u033a(z)\u2212 \u033a\u221e 1 + z + \u033a\u221e 1 + z\nwhich yields always thanks to (A.3)\n\u02dc\u033a(H0 + h)\u2297 Id = \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\n\u02dc\u033a(z)\n1 + z (H1 \u2212 z)\u22121dz(A.6)\n+ \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\n\u033a(z)\u2212 \u033a\u221e 1 + z (H1 \u2212 z)\u22121dz + \u033a\u221e(H1 + 1)\u22121.\nBesides, it is well known (see for instance [4]) that the resolvent (H1 \u2212 z)\u22121 is a pseudo-differential operator and we denote its symbol Rz(v, \u03b7). Thanks to [3], we even have the explicit expression Rz(v, \u03b7) = Gz(v 2/2 + 2\u03b72) Id where Gz is an entire function defined by\nGz(\u00b5) = 2h \u22121\n\u222b 1\n0\n(1\u2212 s)\u2212 zh (1 + s) zh+d\u22122e\u2212 sh\u00b5ds = 2 \u222b h\u22121\n0\n(1\u2212 h\u03c3)\u2212 zh (1 + h\u03c3) zh+d\u22122e\u2212\u03c3\u00b5d\u03c3.\nLet us then set in view of (A.6)\nMh(v, \u03b7) = \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\n\u02dc\u033a(z)\n1 + z Rz(v, \u03b7)dz + \u22121 2i\u03c0\n\u222b\n{Re z=\u2212 12C }\n\u033a(z)\u2212 \u033a\u221e 1 + z Rz(v, \u03b7)dz(A.7)\n+ \u033a\u221eR\u22121(v, \u03b7)\nand we now want to show that Mh is a matrix of symbols matching the properties listed in Hypothesis 1.3. To this purpose, we need to study more carefully the function Rz for z fixed such that Re z \u2264 \u22121/2C. We already saw that it is analytic in both variables v and \u03b7. Now if we take (v, \u03b7) \u2208 Rd \u00d7 \u03a3\u03c4 and put \u00b5 = v2/2 + 2\u03b72, we get that \u00b5 belongs to the sector\nD\u03c4 = {\u00b5 \u2208 C ; |Im\u00b5| \u2264 Re\u00b5+ 4d\u03c42}. One can then easily adapt Theorem 10 from [3] to show that for n \u2208 N and \u00b5 \u2208 D\u03c4 , we have\n|\u2202n\u00b5Gz(\u00b5)| \u2264 C \u222b h\u22121\n0\n\u03c3n(1\u2212 h\u03c3)\u2212Re z/h(1 + h\u03c3)Re z/he\u2212Re\u00b5\u03c3d\u03c3(A.8)\n\u2264 C \u222b +\u221e\n0\n\u03c3ne\u2212(Re\u00b5\u22122Re z)\u03c3d\u03c3 \u2264 Cn\u3008\u00b5\u3009\u2212(n+1)\nsince Re\u00b5 \u2212 2Re z > 0 for \u03c4 small enough. From (A.8) we can already conclude that Mh \u2208 Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) ) . Thus \u02dc\u033a(H0 + h) \u2297 Id = Oph(Mh) with Mh sending R2d in Md(R) as H0 is selfadjoint. Moreover, since Rz is diagonal and even in the variable \u03b7, it is also the case of M h. It only remains to prove that Mh satisfies items b) and d) from Hypothesis 1.3. In order to avoid some tedious computations, instead of proving the whole expansion from item b), we only show that Mh admits a principal term M0 in Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) ) from which we will deduce that item d) is satisfied. One easily gets for Re z \u2264 \u22121/2C and \u00b5 \u2208 D\u03c4 fixed by dominated convergence that\nlim h\u21920 Gz(\u00b5) = 2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u03c3(2z\u2212\u00b5)d\u03c3 = 1\n\u00b5/2\u2212 z =: G 0 z(\u00b5).(A.9)\nWe would like to get some estimates of the derivatives \u2202n\u00b5 (Gz \u2212G0z) in O(h\u3008\u00b5\u3009\u2212n\u22121) on D\u03c4 uniformly in z \u2208 {Re z \u2264 \u22121/2C} in order to apply the formula (A.7) to those.

By (A.11), each boundary term is O(h\u2212n\u3008z\u3009k\u30082z \u2212 \u00b5\u3009\u2212(k+1)eRe (2z\u2212\u00b5)/Ch) while the remaining integral term satisfies\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 (\u00b5\u2212 2z)n+1 \u222b h\u22121/2\n0\n\u2202n+1\u03c3 gz,h(\u03c3)e \u03c3(2z\u2212\u00b5)d\u03c3 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 Cnh n+1\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008z\u3009j |2z \u2212 \u00b5|n+1\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c3j\u22121\u3008\u03c3\u3009je\u03c3Re(2z\u2212\u00b5)d\u03c3\n\u2264 Cnh\u3008\u00b5\u3009\u2212(n+1)\nthanks to (A.12). Thus, we have shown that for n \u2208 N, \u00b5 \u2208 D\u03c4 and Re z \u2264 \u22121/2C, |\u2202n\u00b5 (Gz \u2212G0z)(\u00b5)| \u2264 Cnh\u3008\u00b5\u3009\u2212(n+1).\nPutting R0z(v, \u03b7) = G 0 z(v 2/2 + 2\u03b72) Id and defining M0(v, \u03b7) as in (A.7) with Rz replaced by R 0 z, we deduce that |\u2202\u03b1(Mh \u2212M0)(v, \u03b7)| \u2264 C\u03b1h\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122 on Rd \u00d7 \u03a3\u03c4 so item b) from Hypothesis 1.3 holds true. Finally, by definition of M0 and thanks to (A.9) and (A.2), we have\nM0(v, \u03b7) = \u02dc\u033a ( v2/4 + \u03b72 ) Id \u2265 1\nC \u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122 Id(A.13)\nby assumption on \u033a. Therefore item d) from Hypothesis 1.3 holds true and the proof is complete.\nAppendix B. Linear algebra Lemma\nWe use the following lemma which is inspired by [1], Lemma 2.6.\nLemma B.1. Let M \u2208 Md\u2032(C) such that M = S(A + T ) with S hermitian and invertible, A skewhermitian and T hermitian positive semidefinite. Suppose moreover that\nM(KerT ) \u2229KerT = KerM \u2229KerT = {0}. Then M has no spectrum in iR.\nProof. Let \u03bb \u2208 R and X \u2208 Ker [M \u2212 i\u03bb], we first show that X \u2208 Ker T . Since T is hermitian positive semidefinite, it is sufficient to show that \u3008TX,X\u3009 = 0. Using the properties of S, A and T we have\n\u3008TX,X\u3009 = Re \u2329 (A+ T )X,X \u232a\n= Re \u2329 S\u22121S(A+ T )X,X \u232a = Re ( i\u03bb \u2329 S\u22121X,X \u232a)\n= 0\nso X \u2208 Ker T . Thanks to the assumption, it only remains to prove that X \u2208 Ker M . This can be done easily by noticing that MX = i\u03bbX \u2208M(KerT ) \u2229KerT so MX = 0 by assumption.\nAppendix C. Asymptotic expansions\nLet d\u2032 \u2208 N\u2217. Here we use the convention\u2211\u22121j=0 aj = 0 for any sequence (aj)j\u22650 in a vector space. For K \u2286 Rd\u2032 , the notation a = OC\u221e(K)(hN ) (respectively a = OL\u221e(K)(hN )) means that for all \u03b2 \u2208 Nd \u2032 , there exists C\u03b2,N such that \u2016\u2202\u03b2a\u2016\u221e,K \u2264 C\u03b2,NhN (resp. there exists CN such that \u2016a\u2016\u221e,K \u2264 CNhN ). We will also use the notations from Definition 1.2 and (1.6).\nProposition C.1. Let m \u2208 N\u2217 ; d1, . . . , dm \u2208 N\u2217 and for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, Kj \u2282 Rdj some compact sets. Let a smooth function\n\u03c6h :\nm\u220f\nj=1\nKj \u2192 K \u2282 \u03a3\u03c4\nsuch that \u03c6h = OC\u221e( \u220fm j=1Kj) (1). Consider gh \u223ch \u2211 n\u22650 h ngn in S 0 \u03c4 (1) or in C\u221e(K) if \u03c6h actually takes values in Rd. Then\ngh \u25e6 \u03c6h \u223ch \u2211\nn\u22650\nhn(gn \u25e6 \u03c6h)\nin C\u221e(\u220fmj=1Kj).\nProof.

Proposition C.2. Since the matrix Mh from Hypothesis 1.3 satisfies Mh \u223c \u2211n\u22650 hnMn in Md ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122) ) , the vector of symbols gh defined in Remark 3.11 also admits a classical expansion\ngh \u223c\u2211n\u22650 hngn in M1,d ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22121) ) , where the (gn) are given by\ng0(x, v, \u03b7) = ( \u2212 i t\u03b7 + tv\n2\n) M0(x, v, \u03b7)\nand\ngn(x, v, \u03b7) = ( \u2212 i t\u03b7 + tv\n2\n) Mn(x, v, \u03b7) \u2212 1\n2 (t\u2207v \u2212\ni 2 t\u2207\u03b7)Mn\u22121(x, v, \u03b7)\nfor n \u2265 1. Proof. We have\ngh = (\u2212i t\u03b7 + tv/2)Mh \u2212 h 2 (t\u2207v \u2212 i 2 t\u2207\u03b7)Mh\nand the last term clearly admits the expansion\n\u2212 \u2211\nn\u22651\nhn 1\n2 (t\u2207v \u2212\ni 2 t\u2207\u03b7)Mn\u22121\nin S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v, \u03b7)\u3009\u22122). For the first term of gh, it suffices to notice that for any N \u2208 N, ( \u2212 i t\u03b7 + tv\n2\n) O\nMd ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v,\u03b7)\u3009 \u22122) )(hN ) = O M1,d ( S0\u03c4 (\u3008(v,\u03b7)\u3009 \u22121) )(hN ).\nProposition C.3. Let K a compact set in Rd \u2032 and a \u223ch \u2211 n\u22650 h\nnan in C\u221e(K) such that for all n \u2265 0, an \u223ch \u2211 j\u22650 h jan,j in C\u221e(K).

Let K a compact set in Rd \u2032 and a \u2208 C\u221e(K) such that for all \u03b2 \u2208 Nd\u2032 , there exists a\u03b2,j \u2208 C\u221e(K) such that \u2202\u03b2a \u223c \u2211 j\u22650 h ja\u03b2,j in L \u221e(K). Then a\u03b2,j = \u2202 \u03b2a0,j, i.e\na \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhja0,j in C\u221e(K).\nProof. For simplicity, we take d\u2032 = 1. Let us denote aj = a0,j . By induction, it is sufficient to prove the result for \u03b2 = 1, i.e prove that a1,j = a \u2032 j . Here again, it suffices to prove the case j = 0 which we can then apply to the function h\u22121(a\u2212 a0) and so on. Let x in the interior of K and t \u2208 R\u2217 in a neighborhood of 0. We look at the differential fraction\na0(x+ t)\u2212 a0(x) t = a(x+ t)\u2212 a(x) t + O(h) t\n= a\u2032(x) + t\n\u222b 1\n0\n(1 \u2212 s)a\u2032\u2032(x+ st)ds+ O(h) t\n= a1,0(x) +O(h) + t\n\u222b 1\n0\n(1\u2212 s)a\u2032\u2032(x + st)ds+ O(h) t\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 h\u21920 a1,0(x) + t\n\u222b 1\n0\n(1\u2212 s)a2,0(x+ st)ds.\nTaking now the limit t\u2192 0, we get a\u20320(x) = a1,0(x) which was the desired result.\nProposition C.5. Recall the notation (4.11) and let K \u2282 Rd\u2032 a compact set, \u03a8 : K \u2192 D(0, \u03c4)d a smooth function such that \u03a8 \u223c\u2211j\u22650 hj\u03a8j in C\u221e(K) and b an analytic function on \u03a3\u03c4 .

Proof. We first prove that (C.1) holds in L\u221e(K). Doing a Taylor expansion of b, we have for N \u2208 N\u2217 that\nb \u25e6\u03a8 = b \u25e6\u03a80 + N\u22121\u2211\n|\u03b2|=1\n\u2202\u03b2b \u25e6\u03a80 \u03b2!\n(\u03a8 \u2212\u03a80)\u03b2 +O ( (\u03a8 \u2212\u03a80)N )\n= b \u25e6\u03a80 + N\u22121\u2211\n|\u03b2|=1\n\u2202\u03b2b \u25e6\u03a80 \u03b2!

Besides, the derivatives of b \u25e6 \u03a8 are linear combinations of products of some derivatives of \u03a8 with some \u2202\u03b3b \u25e6 \u03a8 where \u03b3 is a integer multi-index. Hence the expansion of \u03a8 in C\u221e(K) and the result that we\njust proved applied to \u2202\u03b3b \u25e6 \u03a8 instead of b \u25e6 \u03a8 yield that for all \u03b2 \u2208 Nd\u2032 , \u2202\u03b2(b \u25e6 \u03a8) admits a classical expansion in L\u221e(K) whose coefficients are smooth. Therefore, Proposition C.4 enables us to conclude that (C.1) holds in C\u221e(K).\nCorollary C.6. Using the notations from the proof of Lemma 4.1, we have\ngn\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjgn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) on B0(s, 2r)\u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r)\nwith\ngn,0(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) = gn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) )\nand for j \u2265 1\ngn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) = iD\u03b7gn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) )( \u03c8j(x, v, v \u2032) ) +R1j (\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121)\nwhere R1j : ( C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)) )j \u2192 C\u221e(B0(s, 2r)).\nProof. Since \u03c8(s, 0, 0) = O(h), we can suppose that r was chosen small enough so that (x, v, v\u2032, \u03b7) 7\u2192 \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032) sends B0(s, 2r)\u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r) in D(0, \u03c4)d Hence we can use Proposition C.5 to get that\ngn\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c8(x, v, v\u2032)\n) \u223c \u2211\nj\u22650\nhjgn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) on B0(s, 2r)\u00d7B\u221e(0, 2r)\nwith\ngn,0(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) = gn ( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) )\nand for j \u2265 1\ngn,j(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7) =\nj\u2211\n|\u03b2|=1\ni|\u03b2|\n\u03b2! \u2202\u03b2\u03b7 gn\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) ) \u2211\ns\u2208S\u03b2,j\n\u220f\nk\u2208K\u03b2\n( \u2211\na\u2208A\u03b2,s,k\n\u03b2k\u220f\nl=1\n( \u03c8al ) k\n) (C.3)\nwhere K\u03b2 = supp \u03b2 = {k \u2208 J1, dK ; \u03b2k 6= 0}, S\u03b2,j = {s \u2208 Nd ; supp s = K\u03b2, |s| = j and s \u2265 \u03b2} and A\u03b2,s,k = {a \u2208 (N\u2217)\u03b2k ; |a| = sk}. Now, we see thanks to (C.3) that the terms of gn,j(x, v, v\u2032, \u03b7) for which |\u03b2| = 1 yield\niD\u03b7gn\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , \u03b7 + i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) )( \u03c8j(x, v, v \u2032) )\nwhile the terms for which |\u03b2| > 1 only feature the functions \u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121.\nFinally, we state the version of Laplace\u2019s method for integral approximation that we use in this paper.\nProposition C.7. Let x0 \u2208 Rd \u2032 , K a compact neighborhood of x0 and \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221e(K) such that x0 is a non degenerate minimum of \u03d5 and its only global minimum on K. Let also ah \u223c \u2211 j\u22650 h\njaj in C\u221e(K) and denote H \u2208 Md\u2032(R) the Hessian of \u03d5 at x0. The integral\ndet(H)1/2 (2\u03c0h)d\u2032/2\n\u222b\nK\nah(x)e \u2212\n\u03d5(x)\u2212\u03d5(x0)\nh dx\nadmits a classical expansion whose first term is given by a0(x0).\nAppendix D. Proof of Lemma 4.3\nAccording to the proof of Corollary C.6 and the end of the proof of Lemma 4.1 from which we keep the notations, we have the following expression for Rj :\nRj(\u21130, . . . , \u2113j\u22121)(x, v) = \u2211\nn1+n2+n3+n4=j\nn3,n4 6=j\n1\nin1n1!\n( \u2202v\u2032 \u00b7 \u2202\u03b7 )n1( gn2,n3(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7)\u2202v\u2113n4(x, v \u2032) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 v\u2032=v\n\u03b7=0\n(D.1)\n+\nj\u2211\n|\u03b2|=2\ni|\u03b2|\n\u03b2! \u2202\u03b2\u03b7 g0\n( x, v + v\u2032 2 , i (v 2 + \u21130(x, v) \u2202v\u21130(x, v) ))\n\u00d7 \u2211\ns\u2208S\u03b2,j\n\u220f\nk\u2208K\u03b2\n( \u2211\na\u2208A\u03b2,s,k\n\u03b2k\u220f\nl=1\n( \u03c8al(x, v, v) ) k ) \u2202v\u21130(x, v)\n+ iD\u03b7g0 ( x, v, i(v/2 + \u21130(x, v) \u2202v\u21130(x, v)) ) j\u22121\u2211\nk=1\n( \u2113k\u2202v\u2113j\u2212k ) (x, v) \u2202v\u21130(x, v).\nUsing Lemma 4.2 and (C.3), it is clear that the last two terms of Rj(\u21130, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2113j\u22121) given by (D.1) and the terms of the first sum for which n1 = 0 are real valued. For the rest of the first term, we start by noticing that one can establish by induction that for n1 \u2265 1,\n( \u2202v\u2032 \u00b7 \u2202\u03b7 )n1 = \u2211\np\u2208J1,dKn1\n\u2202 \u03b3(p) v\u2032 \u2202 \u03b3(p) \u03b7(D.2)\nwhere using the notation (3.20), we define \u03b3(p) = \u2211n1 k=1 epk (note that |\u03b3(p)| = n1). Besides, we have for 0 \u2264 n2 \u2264 j and p \u2208 J1, dKn1\n\u2202\u03b3(p)\u03b7 gn2,0(x, v, v \u2032, 0) = \u2202\u03b3(p)\u03b7 gn2\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) ) \u2208 in1Rd(D.3)\naccording to Lemma 4.2 and in the case j \u2265 2, for 1 \u2264 n3 \u2264 j \u2212 1 \u2202\u03b3(p)\u03b7 gn2,n3(x, v, v \u2032, 0)(D.4)\n=\nn3\u2211\n|\u03b2|=1\ni|\u03b2|\n\u03b2! \u2202\u03b2+\u03b3(p)\u03b7 gn2\n( x, v + v\u2032\n2 , i\u03c80(x, v, v\n\u2032) ) \u2211\ns\u2208S\u03b2,n3\n\u220f\nk\u2208K\u03b2\n( \u2211\na\u2208A\u03b2,s,k\n\u03b2k\u220f\nl=1\n( \u03c8al ) k\n) \u2208 in1Rd\nwhere we used (C.3) and Lemma 4.2 once again. The combination of (D.2), (D.3) and (D.4) enables us to conclude that the term\n\u2211\nn1+n2+n3+n4=j\nn1 6=0;n3,n4 6=j\n1\nin1n1!\n( \u2202v\u2032 \u00b7 \u2202\u03b7 )n1( gn2,n3(x, v, v \u2032, \u03b7)\u2202v\u2113n4(x, v \u2032) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 v\u2032=v\n\u03b7=0\nfrom (D.1) is also real so Rj(\u2113 s 0, . . . , \u2113 s j\u22121) is real valued. For the last statement, it suffices to use the formula (D.1) after noticing that \u03c8 (and hence the (gn2,n3)) remain unchanged when \u2113 is replaced by \u2212\u2113.\nReferences\n[1] J.-F.
