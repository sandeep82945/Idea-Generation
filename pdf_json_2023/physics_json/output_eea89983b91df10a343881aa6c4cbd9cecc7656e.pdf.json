Structurally, cyclic and polycyclic polysilanes are the higher congeners of cyclo- and polycycloalkanes.6,7\nAdamantane cage structures of polysilanes are of particular interest as they represent the building blocks of elemental silicon. The synthesis of sila-adamantane cages nicely reects the development of preparative approaches towards this type of compounds (Fig. 1). The rst synthetic attempt, which was reported by West and Indriksons as early as in 1972, employed a Wurtz type condensation of Me2SiCl2 and MeSiCl3 with sodium/potassium alloy.8 As the Wurtz-type approach is not very selective, the formation of the expected permethylsilaadamantane cage I could not unambiguously be proven. Salt elimination reactions between oligosilanides and silyl halides represented a major advancement.9 This method allowed access to a cyclohexasilanyl substituted bicylo[2.2.1] heptasilane, which served as the structural isomer required for sila-Wagner\u2013Meerwein (SWM) rearrangement to the rst structurally veried example of a sila-adamantane molecule II.10\ne Universita\u0308t Graz, Stremayrgasse 9, 8010\nita\u0308t Oldenburg, Carl von Ossietzky-Str. 9-\nhemie, Goethe Universita\u0308t Frankfurt am\nt am Main, Germany ESI) available: Experimental procedures putational details, crystallographic crystallographic data in CIF or other /10.1039/d3sc03301e\n961\nRecently, Su and co-workers demonstrated site selective functionalization of both the bridging and the bridgehead positions as in adamantane III.11 Wagner and co-workers presented a surprising simple but high yielding synthesis of germasilaadamantanes.

Adamantane 1 was also obtained from polycyclic starting materials via the established route to all-sila-adamantanes: the tricyclic adamantane precursor 4 with a dimethylgermylene unit rearranges quantitatively and selectively to the germasilaadamantane 1 (79% isolated yield). In this case, slightly enforced reaction conditions had to be applied (Scheme 1).\nThe NMR spectrum of 1 exhibits the expected pattern. Five signals in the 1H NMR spectrum at d = 0.65 (18H), 0.62 (9H), 0.61 (9H), 0.38 (9H), and 0.35 (27H) ppm correspond to the methyl groups at Si2, Si5 (2 \u00d7 for Meax and Meeq), Si\n1, and Si4 (Si numbering in accordance with the structural formula of 1 in Scheme 1), respectively. The same number of ve signals was found for the methyl groups in the 13C NMR spectrum at 5.5 (Si1), 5.0 (Si4), 4.8 (Si2), 4.2, and 4.1 (Si5) ppm. Also the 29Si NMR spectrum features ve signals at 0.8 (Si1), \u22125.6 (Si4), \u221220.9 (Si2), \u221226.3 (Si5), and \u2212118.5 (Si3) ppm (assignment of Si2 and Si5 by 1H\u201329Si HMBC). Comparison to the 1H NMR spectrum of the allsila-adamantane II (1H: d = 0.60) (s, 36H, SiMe2), 0.35 (s, 36H, SiMe3)10 shows the chemical shis of 1 to be very similar, with all SiMe2 signals around 0.60 ppm and the SiMe3 signals around 0.35 ppm. The 29Si NMR chemical shis of the cyclohexasilanyl unit of the bottom part of compound 1 (i.e. Si3, Si4, and Si5) are very close to those of the all-sila adamantane II (29Si: d = \u22124.8, \u221226.0, and \u2212118.6), indicating no major inuence of the germanium atom.\nChem.

Sci., 2023, 14, 8956\u20138961\nfour SiCl3-substituted silicon atoms as the bridgeheads.12 Exhaustive methylation of this product led to germasilaadamantane 5 (Scheme 2).36\nSubjecting compound 5 to the rearrangement conditions (Ph3C[B(C6F5)4]/toluene) led to the clean formation of the adamantane cage product 2 with all germanium atoms shied to the bridgehead positions in 69% isolated yield (Scheme 2).\nDue to the higher symmetry of 2 compared to 1, NMR spectroscopic analysis of 2 exhibited a simpler pattern. The two signals in the 1H NMR spectrum at d = 0.69 (36H) and 0.38 (36H) ppm correspond to the SiMe2 and SiMe3 groups, respectively. The two signals for the methyl groups in the 13C NMR spectrum were observed at 5.6 and 5.4 ppm. Compared to the all-sila-adamantane II (d = \u22124.8, \u221226.0, and \u2212118.6 ppm), the 29Si NMR spectrum of 2 features only the two signals at \u22120.5 (SiMe3) and \u221215.7 (SiMe2), with the downeld-shi behavior typical for neighboring germanium atoms.37,38\nSingle crystal XRD analysis of 2 (ref. 39) (Fig. 2) provided a structure isotypic to the all-sila-adamantane II.10 Both compounds crystallize in the space group R 3 and the reduced cell parameters of 2 (14.171 \u00c5 and 77.13 deg.) give rise to a cell volume of 2659 \u00c53 compared to the 2636 \u00c53 observed for the allsila-adamantane II.10 The Si\u2013Ge bond length in adamantane 2 is 238.7 pm, which is close to the median of the Si\u2013Ge bond lengths in molecular compounds (239.7 pm) and close to the sum of the single bond covalent radii of both elements (237 pm).40,41 Interestingly, it is only 1.7 pm larger than the Si\u2013Si bonds in all-sila-adamantane. The bond angles around the germanium atoms are close to the tetrahedral ideal of 109.5\u00b0 (108.5\u2013110.1\u00b0). Judged from these molecular parameters, the germasila-adamantane 2 appears to be completely unstrained. The UV(vis) spectrum of adamantane 2 in n-hexane shows a strong absorption at lmax = 224 nm (molar absorption 3 = 2 \u00d7 104 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121), also very similar to the UV data reported for all-sila-adamantane II (lmax = 222 nm, 3 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\n5 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121).10\nThe results of density functional calculations42 at the M062X/6-311+G(d,p) level show that the formation of the silaadamantane cluster is thermodynamically strongly favored, i.e. the isomerization of polycyclic germasilane 4 into germasilaadamantane 1 is exothermic by 158 kJ mol\u22121 (Fig. 3 and ESI\u2020). Adamantane 1 with the germanium atom in a bridgehead position is also the most stable of the three positional isomers 1, 3, and 6. It is energetically favored by 39 kJ mol\u22121 over the adamantane isomer 6 with the germanium atom in the bridging position and by 62 kJ mol\u22121 over germylsila-adamantane 3 with an exocyclic germyl substituent. Similarly, the tetragermasilaadamantane 5 with four bridging GeMe2 units is less stable than its isomer 2 with four germanium atoms in the bridgehead positions by 160 kJ mol\u22121. The thermodynamic preference of adamantane isomers with germanium in the bridgehead positions is a consequence of the relative strength of the Si\u2013C bond (373 kJ mol\u22121) versus the Ge\u2013C bond (326 kJ mol\u22121), which outcompetes the formation of Si\u2013Ge bonds (294 kJ mol\u22121) on the cost of Si\u2013Si linkages (318 kJ mol\u22121, see Table S3\u2020 for calculated BDEs). For example, the transformation of germasilaadamantane 6 into its isomer 1 needs an exchange of two Ge\u2013C\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The estimation of the energy difference 6 vs. 1 based on these increments results in \u221246 kJ mol\u22121 in preference of the germasilaadamantane 1, which is close to the DFT-computed energy difference of \u221239 kJ mol\u22121 (Fig. 3). While the transformation of the germasila-adamantane cages 1, 3, 6, and 2, 5 can be understood on this basis, their formation from polycyclic precursors such as 4 is less straightforward. In addition, other effects such as release of ring strain and attractive London dispersion forces between silyl groups add to the thermodynamic preference of the adamantane cluster.43,44 For example, the ring strain of the bicycloheptane part of the tricyclic germasilane 4 is according to an isodesmic reaction 47 kJ mol\u22121 and the consideration of dispersion energy favors the adamantane 1 over 4 by 37 kJ mol\u22121 (for details, see ESI, Fig. S33 and S34\u2020).\nWe investigated the intriguing skeletal rearrangement of the germasila-adamantane cage during the transformation 5 / 2 in detail. Previous experimental and computational studies on related systems demonstrated that the initial step in this type of rearrangement is the formation of silyl- or germyl cations by transfer of a methyl group from the germa-oligosilane to the trityl cation.33 Aer rearrangement to the more stable silyl or germyl cation, the reaction terminates with a nal methyl group transfer. Methyl-anion abstraction from tetragermasilaadamantane 5 allows the formation of three different cations [7]+\u2013[9]+. The secondary germylium cation [7]+ is the most stable one, followed by the secondary silylium cation [8]+ and the primary silylium cation [9]+ with an exo-cage dimethylsilylium substituent is the least stable cation in this series (Fig. 4) (Note: In the context of this manuscript the terms primary or secondary cation are used for cations with either one silyl/ germyl substituent or with two such substituents). These cations are signicantly higher in energy than the two silyl\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncations ([10]+ and [11]+) that are possible immediate precursors for tetragermasila-adamantane 2. The reason for the higher stability of the cations [10]+ and [11]+ is the bridgehead position of all four germanium atoms. Therefore, the isomerization of the germylium cation [7]+ to the secondary silyl cation [10]+ is exothermic by 120 kJ mol\u22121 (Fig. 4). Association of the cations [7]+\u2013[11]+ to the solvent benzene is not of importance as the energy differences between the benzene complexes [7(C6H6)] +\u2013 [11(C6H6)] + are similar to those of the isolated cations and inclusion of entropy effects shows that these complexes do not exist under ambient conditions (free association enthalpy DGA,298 > 0 kJ mol\u22121 ([7]+, [8]+, [10]+)) or are only weakly bonded (DGA,298 > \u221215 kJ mol\u22121 ([9]+, [11]+), see Table S4\u2020).45\nBased on these relative cation stabilities, we suggest the following mechanistic scenario for the trityl-induced rearrangement 5 / 2. The initial step, the exergonic methyl-anion transfer from a germylene unit of adamantane 5 to the trityl cation and formation of the germylium cation [7]+ (DGR = \u221268 kJ mol\u22121), is followed by its transformation to the more stable adamantyl cation [10]+ (DGR = \u2212121 kJ mol\u22121). Also the terminating methyl-anion transfer from adamantane 5 to silyl cation [10]+ is thermodynamically favored (DGR=\u221234 kJ mol\u22121) and closes the catalytic cycle (Scheme 3). The endergonic methyl-anion transfer from Ph3CMe to cation [10]\n+ (DGR = +35 kJ mol\u22121) suggests that the trityl borate is only the initiating reagent and not the actual catalyst.\nThe isomerization of secondary germylium cation [7]+ with four germanium atoms in the bridging position of the adamantane cage into the silylium cation [10]+ with all four germanium atoms in the bridgehead position is a multistep process involving several cationic intermediates. To understand this process we investigated the migration of one germanium center of cation [7]+ into a neighboring bridgehead position, i.e. the transformation of cation [7]+ into the germylium cation [12]+ (Scheme 4). This isomerization is thermodynamically favored (by 39 kJ mol\u22121) and involves three cationic intermediates and the rate determining step (rtds) is a [1,2] methyl-group shi, 159 kJ mol\u22121 above the initially formed cation [7]+ (see Fig. S32 and Table S2\u2020 for details). Finally, three similar consecutive processes transform the germylium cation [12]+ into the more stable cation [10]+."

Therefore, this method allows a rational design of molecular models for mixed silicon germanium alloys. The extension of this method to Sn/Si hetero-adamantanes36 and related main group element heteroadamantanes is currently investigated in our laboratories and will further broaden the scope of this method.46"
