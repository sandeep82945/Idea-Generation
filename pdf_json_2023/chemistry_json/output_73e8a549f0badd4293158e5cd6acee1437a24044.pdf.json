    "abstractText": "A novel catalyst was fabricated in this study based on zirconium MOF modified with pyridine carboxaldehyde in a solvothermal reaction, embedded with cerium. In order to confirm the catalyst structure, various characterization techniques, including FTIR, Far IR, EDX, XRD, TGA, FE\u2010SEM, ICP, and BET analyses, were employed. The results indicated that the UiO\u201066\u2010Pyca\u2010Ce (III) catalyst had a Langmuir surface area of 501.63 m2/g, a pore volume of 0.28 cm3/g, and a pore size of 2.27 nm. To study catalytic activity, a sequential approach of Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition was used to synthesize various polyhydroquinoline derivatives. The reaction took place at ambient temperature. The UiO\u201066\u2010Pyca\u2010Ce (III) catalyst demonstrated high efficacy (90%) and reusability in asymmetric synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives for several reasons, including the possession of three Lewis acid activation functions.",

            "text": "A novel catalyst was fabricated in this study based on zirconium MOF modified with pyridine carboxaldehyde in a solvothermal reaction, embedded with cerium. In order to confirm the catalyst structure, various characterization techniques, including FTIR, Far IR, EDX, XRD, TGA, FE\u2011SEM, ICP, and BET analyses, were employed. The results indicated that the UiO\u201166\u2011Pyca\u2011Ce (III) catalyst had a Langmuir surface area of 501.63 m2/g, a pore volume of 0.28 cm3/g, and a pore size of 2.27 nm. To study catalytic activity, a sequential approach of Knoevenagel condensation and Michael addition was used to synthesize various polyhydroquinoline derivatives. The reaction took place at ambient temperature. The UiO\u201166\u2011Pyca\u2011Ce (III) catalyst demonstrated high efficacy (90%) and reusability in asymmetric synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives for several reasons, including the possession of three Lewis acid activation functions.\nRecently, multi-component reactions have been employed to develop new methods of Synthesis strategies with abundant molecular diversity1,2. These strategies have resulted high atom economy and simple methods for synthesizing heterocyclic compounds3 which leading to biological active compounds like antituberculosis, anticancer, antipain, and antidiabetic agents. As a result, a wide variety of studies have been carried out on the popularization of the synthesis of these heterocyclic compounds using both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts4\u20137. In addition, the development of synthetic methods to fabricate N-heterocyclic polyhydroquinoline has been highlighted by researchers8. To prepare bioactive molecules, different types of catalysts, such as LiBr9, CTAB10, CuBr11, GO nanoparticles12, l-proline13, CTACl14 and salicylic acid15, have been utilized. Many of these reactions suffer from disadvantages like harsh reaction conditions, low product yields, and slow and tedious procedures, which all considered negative points. To solve these problems, scientists have developed and offered novel synthetic techniques. Recently; metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) that include metal-exo clusters and organic linkers have received more attention16\u201318. These MOFs are utilized in various applications because of their high porosity, highly effective surface, and chemical stability. These applications include drug delivery19,20, food storage21, gas absorption or storage22, hazardous gas storage23, chemical sensing24 and optoelectronics25. MOFs either have catalytic activity or used as a suitable support for catalysts which make them a good choice in catalysis applications26\u201332. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) method is used to functionalize MOFs which can improve their catalytic activity33. PSM can be performed without causing any negative effects on the framework\u2019s stability. these modifications are resulted by adding new active sites in MOFs structure34 that enhance catalytic activities of these compounds. Another enhancement leads to easy separation and recovery of heterogeneous catalysts which highlighted MOFs as a reusable catalysts35\u201344.

Cerium halides have advantages such as being water resistance, user friendly, non-toxicity, and affordability. Furthermore, they can be reused multiple times without any purification46. They are recognized as effective Lewis acid catalysts47. In current study, catalytic activity of zirconium MOF from the UiO-66 family was investigated. Pyridine carbaldehyde was used to modify UiO-66-NH2 using a post-synthesis approach. The cerium was subsequently incorporated into UiO-66-Pyca. The asymmetric Hantzsch reaction was employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III). The catalyst showed recyclability and multiple reusability, which is very favorable for both the environment and the economic standpoint. The sufficiency and catalytic performance of this new UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) catalyst were assessed in the asymmetric Hantzsch condensation reaction for the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives (5a-f) (Fig.\u00a01). It should be noted that the response conducted as part of this research is environmentally safe and no toxic waste is produced."

A new band is seen at 1687 cm\u20131 in the FTIR spectra of UiO-66-Pyca and UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) (Fig.\u00a02b and c), which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the C=N bond caused by imine condensation of amino groups with the carbonyl group of pyridinecarbaldehyde, indicating the successful modification of the structure49. In the FTIR spectrum of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III), the bands associated with the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of N-Ce are observed at 360 and 460 cm\u20131, respectively, which are in agreement with the reported values in the literature54. To observe the peaks related to cerium, the spectrum in the range below 400 cm\u20131 should be checked. The closest vibration, VCe-Cl, appears at (356, 339, 343, and 336 cm\u20131) (m), while the tensile vibration VCe-N and the flexural vibration due to Cl are in the same band at (145, 148, 150, and 142 cm\u20131) (Fig.\u00a02d)54."

            "text": "Two main weight losses were discovered during the thermal analysis of the UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) catalyst, which were supported by TGA-DTA curves (Fig.\u00a03d). The first mass loss started when the temperature reached 120 \u00b0C. The solvent molecules trapped in the holes and the water molecules absorbed on the surface of the MOF are responsible for this 20% decrease, which results in a broad endothermic peak in this region of the DTA curve. The second 20% drop was noticed in the 120 to 500 \u00b0C temperature range. The presence of aliphatic groups, unreacted molecules, the breakdown of organic compounds, and cerium species are thought to be the causes of this reduction. Water molecules that were guests in big cages have also relaxed, which is another reason for the decrease. The effect of this reduction can also be seen in the DTA curve and the strength of its exothermic peak.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16584 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43869-2\nDecomposition of the framework occurs at a temperature higher than 550 \u00b0C, whereas UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) exhibits thermal stability up to 500 \u2103. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was also performed for UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III), which revealed that the resulting compound contained 4.350 mol% Ce and 30.372 mol% Zr.\nSEM images and elemental mapping analysis SEM images of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) reveal that the catalyst\u2019s structure remains unchanged after the modification during the functionalization process. Figure\u00a04 demonstrates that the crystal size distribution appears uniform (Fig.\u00a04a).

The model reaction consisted of a mixture of benzaldehyde (1 mmol), ethyl acetoacetate (1 mmol), dimedone (1 mmol), and ammonium acetate (2 mmol), performed at ambient temperature. Initially, without UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) present, no significant progress was observed in the reaction (Table\u00a01, entry 1). Subsequently, the effect of different parameters such as solvent type, reaction time, reaction conditions, and the amount of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) was investigated (Table\u00a01, entries 2\u201310). Under fixed conditions with UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III), the model reaction was conducted at room temperature and under reflux conditions (Table\u00a01, entries 2\u20133). It was found that the ambient temperature provided optimal reaction conditions, resulting in shorter reaction times and higher efficiency\nFigure\u00a02.

Additionally, using ethanol instead of water as the reaction\u2019s solvent produced noticeably better results (Table\u00a01, entry 3). The model reaction was performed with varying amounts of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III), and based on the results, the most optimal amount was determined to be 0.01 g (Table\u00a01, entry 3), considering that a lower value is preferable. Therefore, based on these investigations, it was determined that conducting the model reaction at room temperature, using ethanol as the solvent, and using 0.01 g of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) were the best conditions.\nTo generalize the optimal reaction conditions and evaluate the performance and yield of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) as a catalyst, an extensive range of substituted aldehydes (1 mmol) with both electron-donating and electronwithdrawing substituents, along with dimedone (1 mmol), ethyl acetoacetate (1 mmol), and ammonium acetate (2 mmol), were used (Table\u00a01, entries a-f). Diverse substituted polyhydroquinoline derivatives (5a-f) were synthesized using 0.01 g of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) at room temperature. The outcomes shown in Table\u00a02 resulted that the desired products were synthesized in a brief amount of time with a high yield. Based on the relevant results, it can be deduced that the UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III), at room temperature, resulted a successful synthesis of products with a high yield in a short amount of time.\nAssessment of UiO\u201166\u2011Pyca\u2011Ce (III) in the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives in comparison with other introduced researches In Tables\u00a01 and 2, the obtained results are presented to evaluate the efficiency and performance of UiO-66-PycaCe (III) in the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives by replacing a wide range of aldehydes (electronwithdrawing or electron-donating). In order to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of UiO-66- Pyca-Ce (III), Table\u00a03 compares UiO-66- Pyca-Ce (III) with other prior catalysts for the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives. For this, a number of variables have been taken into account, such as the quantity of catalyst, type of solvent, temperature during the reaction, reaction time, and the proportion of isolated products. The results are summarized in Table\u00a03, entries 1\u20135. In addition to the advantages, the reported data have certain disadvantages, including the high cost of the catalyst used, toxic and volatile solvents, harsh reaction conditions such as long reaction times and high temperatures, and low product yields (Table\u00a03, entries 1\u20134). However, compared to prior studies, UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) demonstrates unique and distinct advantages. Its proficiency allows for synthesizing polyhydroquinoline derivatives with a lower catalyst dosage, shorter reaction times, and high efficiency (Table\u00a03, entry 5).\nProposed mechanism for synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives This study identified UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) as the primary catalytic agent driving the synthesis reaction of polyhydroquinoline derivatives forward. The proposed mechanism shown in Fig.\u00a06 can be explained in two different\nFigure\u00a03.

BET analysis of UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III).\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16584 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43869-2\nways, according to earlier studies. In the first method, intramolecular interactions between the substituted aldehyde and the carbonyl group of ethyl acetoacetate activate each other. This leads to a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the activated substituted aldehyde (1) and the enol dimedone (3), resulting in the formation of intermediate (I). Simultaneously, intermediate (II) is formed from the reaction between activated ethyl acetoacetate (2) and ammonium acetate (4). Finally, a Michael addition reaction occurs between intermediates (I) and (II), followed by cyclization and elimination of water, leading to the desired polyhydroquinoline derivatives (5a-f). In the second method, intermediate (III) is initially created in the Knoevenagel reaction between the active aldehyde (1) and the enol form of ethyl acetoacetate (2). Intermediate (IV) is also produced by the reaction between activated dimedone (3) and ammonium acetate. Similarly, to the first method, a Michael addition reaction occurs between intermediates (III) and (IV), followed by cyclization and elimination of water, resulting in the desired polyhydroquinoline derivatives (5a-f). For further explanation, it can be said that the synthesized catalyst is an acidic catalyst, which generally activates electrophiles. In the case of aldehydes, either cerium or zirconium with vacant orbitals will perform this activation. They coordinate with the oxygen of the aldehyde, weakening the carbonyl double bond. Alternatively, the oxygen of the aldehyde forms a hydrogen bond with COOH groups, leading to the weakening of the carbonyl double bond. The weakened carbonyl then becomes vulnerable to attack. These events happen for ethyl acetoacetate and dimedone in both the first and second routes, and are followed by a tautomerization procedure that adds a double bond. The double bond has the potential to engage in nucleophilic attack on the activated aldehyde. In the subsequent steps, the dimedone and/or ethyl acetoacetate undergo similar activation processes, and ammonium acetate attacks the activated species.\nReusability assessment of UiO\u201166\u2011Pyca\u2011Ce (III) after several catalytic performances Recyclability and reuse of catalysts, whether in industrial applications or the discussion of green chemistry, are essential and vital for developing of chemical reactions. Therefore, in this study, the reusability of UiO-66-PycaCe (III) in the synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives was investigated. After each reaction, the catalyst was detached through washing and centrifugation, and then dried. The results are depicted in Fig.\u00a07, and they show that the catalyst can used as a qualified catalyst even after being used five times without significantly reducing the efficiency of the desired products."

            "text": "In this study, a catalyst was fabricated using a solvothermal reaction based on zirconium MOF that had been modified with pyridine carboxaldehyde and cerium metal. UiO-66-Pyca-Ce (III) was created and introduced as an effective catalyst with noteworthy features for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. The structural properties of this catalyst were assessed through various analyses, including XRD, TGA, FE-SEM, ICP, and BET. Verification of the presence of functional groups, analysis of its main constituent elements, and their dispersion were performed through FT-IR, Far IR, and EDX analysis, respectively. This catalyst demonstrated high efficiency in producing the desired product in the shortest amount of time at room temperature, without requiring special conditions, for a number of reasons, including three Lewis acid activating functions. These features show promising potential for the manifestation of a highly efficient catalyst, with a yield of 90%, particularly in the asymmetric synthesis of polyhydroquinoline derivatives. In addition to the benefits above, considering the importance of catalyst recovery, reusability in the industry, and its impact on the environment, the efficiency of the produced catalyst was evaluated multiple times. The results demonstrated the catalyst\u2019s pleasant stability and performance in reuse.\nTable 1.
