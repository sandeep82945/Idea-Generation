    "abstractText": "We aimed to review the determinants of burnout onset in teachers. The study was conducted according to the PROSPERO protocol CRD42018105901, with a focus on teachers. We performed a literature search from 1990 to 2021 in three databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase. We included longitudinal studies assessing burnout as a dependent variable, with a sample of at least 50 teachers. We summarized studies by the types of determinant and used the MEVORECH tool for a risk of bias assessment (RBA). The quantitative synthesis focused on emotional exhaustion. We standardized the reported regression coefficients and their standard errors and plotted them using R software to distinguish between detrimental and protective determinants. A qualitative analysis of the included studies (n = 33) identified 61 burnout determinants. The RBA showed that most studies had external and internal validity issues. Most studies implemented two waves (W) of data collection with 6\u201312 months between W1 and W2. Four types of determinants were summarized quantitatively, Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095776 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 2 of 48 namely support, conflict, organizational context, and individual characteristics, based on six studies. This systematic review identified detrimental determinants of teacher exhaustion, including job satisfaction, work climate or pressure, teacher self-efficacy, neuroticism, perceived collective exhaustion, and classroom disruption. We recommend that authors consider using harmonized methods and protocols such as those developed in OMEGA-NET and other research consortia.",

This systematic review identified detrimental determinants of teacher exhaustion, including job satisfaction, work climate or pressure, teacher self-efficacy, neuroticism, perceived collective exhaustion, and classroom disruption. We recommend that authors consider using harmonized methods and protocols such as those developed in OMEGA-NET and other research consortia.\nKeywords: burnout; predictors; exhaustion; teachers; occupational health; prevention\n1. Introduction\nAcross different countries, job stress among teachers has been recognized as a common problem, receiving a significant research attention [1\u20134]. While the studies indicate that burnout fluctuates between and within individuals, there is a lack of evidence concerning how burnout develops over time and whether it represents a long-term or short-term condition [5]. It has been estimated, for example, that a wide range of U.S. teachers (between 5% and 20%), regardless of level, exhibit burnout [6], indicating the stressful nature of the teaching occupation [7,8]. In a cohort of 310 Swedish school teachers, it was also shown that substantial proportions of teachers showed signs of burnout, at 14% and 15%, respectively, measured at two time points 30 months apart [9]. In addition, a study conducted in Finnish teachers detected that burnout mediated the effects of high job demands on ill health [10]. Even though there are numerous studies reporting the high prevalence of stress among teachers [11\u201313], often accompanied by exhaustion and cynicism [14], there are also studies demonstrating teachers\u2019 enthusiasm and job satisfaction [8,15,16].\n1.1. Work Context and Exposure in the Teaching Profession\nAccording to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), teaching professionals are classified into: University and Higher Education Teachers, Vocational Education Teachers, Secondary Education Teachers, Primary School and Early Childhood Teachers, and Other Teaching Professionals [17]. The essential activity of a teacher is to enable students\u2019 learning. To achieve teaching goals, teachers prepare lessons and exercises, develop learning materials, lead students throughout the curriculum, grade students\u2019 work, give feedback, and collaborate with colleagues and school leaders [18]. The work context in which teachers provide their educational activities is very specific. The teachers in elementary schools typically work with the same group of students every day and teach students several subjects. On the contrary, high school teachers usually work with different groups of students, focusing their teaching work on one or two subjects. Apart from giving lectures, the teachers also occasionally have to meet with parents. Communicating with parents is an important part of their job, especially when students are struggling and need extra help or attention outside of the classroom. University and higher education teachers teach their subjects after the secondary education has been finalized, in addition to conducting research and preparing scholarly papers and books. Vocational education teachers teach vocational or occupational subjects in adult and further education institutions, in addition to teaching senior students [17]. A significant number of workplace hazards that teachers are exposed to have already been recognized and well-defined. These include physical (e.g., inadequate ambient temperature), biological (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and mold), and chemical exposures (e.g., laboratory chemicals), as well as ergonomic hazards (e.g., sitting or staying in one place for long periods of time). The most common health conditions in teachers resulting from occupational exposure can be summarized into: musculoskeletal disorders due to job stress, besides ergonomic factors [19]; voice disorders resulting from vocal overload in the presence of background noise [20]; and mental health problems as a consequence of psychosocial\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 3 of 48\nhazards (e.g., increased job demands or limited job resources) [21]. Of note, burnout is one of the most frequently studied adverse effects of psychosocial exposures at work. Indeed, specific job demands in the teaching profession, especially increased responsibilities and tight deadlines, identify teaching as one of the most stressful occupations [7,22\u201324]. It is well known that exposure to chronic workplace stressors can result in development of burnout [25,26]. The job demands\u2013resources (JD/JR) model of burnout assumes that the workplace context is characterized by a variety of physical, psychological, social, or organizational factors (also referred as job demands) that require prolonged physical or psychological efforts in workers. Job demands are not necessarily negative, but they may turn into workplace stressors when the invested personal efforts are high, meaning job demands may be associated with certain physiological or psychological costs [27], leading to overtaxing and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, the lack of job resources may result in withdrawal behavior (depersonalization) and disengagement [26,28,29]. Accordingly, job resources are those aspects of the job that reduce job demands (and the associated costs) and stimulate personal growth and learning and development [27]. In the context of reduced job resources (e.g., inappropriate performance feedback, low salary, job insecurity, inadequate supervisory coaching and teamwork), job demands are particularly detrimental [28\u201330].\n1.2. Burnout in Teachers: Current State of Knowledge\nSchaufeli and Taris [31\u201333] conceptualized burnout as the \u201ccombination of the inability and unwillingness to spend the necessary effort at work for proper task completion\u201d. In this context, inability and unwillingness are two inseparable components, representing energetic and motivational dimensions, respectively [34]. Three dimensions (exhaustion, cynicism, and lack of professional efficacy) usually define burnout, but evidence indicates that lack of professional efficacy plays a divergent role as compared to exhaustion and cynicism [30,35]. Empirical results confirm the exceptional role of lacking efficacy compared with the other two burnout dimensions, illustrated by: a low correlation of lack of efficacy with exhaustion and cynicism; findings that burnout manifests itself via exhaustion and cynicism in psychotherapeutic clients, but is not manifested by lacking efficacy; and evidence that lack of efficacy shows a different pattern of correlations with job characteristics when compared with exhaustion and cynicism [36]. Exhaustion at both physical and psychological levels constitutes the core dimension of occupational burnout. According to the harmonized definition of occupational burnout elaborated within the framework of the EU COST Action CA16216 (The Network on the Coordination and Harmonization of European Occupational Cohorts\u2014OMEGA-NET; http://omeganetcohorts.eu, accessed on 5 May 2022), it is characterized as a state of physical and emotional exhaustion due to prolonged exposure to work-related problems. In this EU COST Action, occupational burnout was chosen as priority health outcome for harmonization of its definition, measurement, and research protocols for future epidemiological studies. To do so, systematic reviews have been conducted [37\u201340], including on the predictors of occupational burnout onset, regardless of the type of occupation activity or job [41]. In this article, a systematic review on determinants of occupational burnout among teachers is presented. We include only longitudinal studies, since cross-sectional studies do not consider temporality.\n1.3. Objective\nThe objectives of this systematic review focused on longitudinal studies were to identify the determinants of burnout onset in teachers and to show how much further beyond qualitative analysis we can go with quantitative synthesis.\n2. Methods\nThe study was conducted according to a study protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018105901), with a focus on teachers. We performed a literature search for the period\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 4 of 48\n1990 (January) to 2018 (August) in three databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase. Because there was a possibility that additional studies were published during or after finalizing this review, we checked databases for new publications up until December 2021, and no additional prospective longitudinal studies on burnout in teachers were identified.\n2.1. Study Selection and Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion\nWe included only prospective longitudinal studies where burnout was a dependent variable (outcome), with a final sample of at least 50 teachers per exposure group (i.e., studies with sufficient power), published between the years 1990 (January) and 2018 (August) in peer-reviewed journals, with no language limitation. The full search strategy can be found in Supplementary Figure S1. In cases where we identified multiple publications describing a single study, we included the study only once and chose the most complete or most recent publication. We excluded studies where exposure was not assessed prior to the outcome assessment. Other reasons for exclusion were: no full text available; and studies where participants were not professionally employed (e.g., students). For one study, written in German [42], we could not assess the risk of bias (RoB) and excluded this study at this stage. Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (D.C. and S.C.M.) against the inclusion criteria. For studies that were not excluded on the basis of the title or abstract, full-text manuscripts were obtained and assessed by two reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and if required a third reviewer (IGC) was consulted.\n2.2. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment\nWe developed a MS Excel data extraction form, which was tested by all reviewers and improved until reaching consensual approval. From each included study, two reviewers (D.M. and D.C.) independently extracted the data as follows: study reference, country, objective, design, hypothesis tested and result (confirmed or not confirmed hypothesis), burnout definition used, tool used for burnout measurement, inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of occupational groups for which separate data are available, number of samples used, initial sample size, final sample size of occupational group, sex ratio (F/M), mean age (min/max), setting (urban/rural), participation rate, participation rates for other waves if several (max 4 waves), time interval between waves, number of burnout domains investigated, definition of predictive (explanatory) variables (including burnout determinants), statistical method used, type of result reported (e.g., slope or relative risk with differences across burnout measures), final model description, burnout domain name, wave number, occupational group, category of predictor and outcome (cut-off values of category boundaries, ordinal level, or continuous variable), result, result variability measure (e.g., SE, CI, p-value), variability value, and author\u2019s interpretation. Particular attention was paid to the outcome definition and assessment, along with the precision of the method or tool used and the cut-off values. The same attention was paid on the determinants studied.\n2.3. Risk of Bias Assessment\nThe RoB was assessed using the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MEVORECH) [43], which automatically produces a RoB report in MS Access format, taking into account the external validity (sampling of subjects, assessment of sampling bias, response rate, exclusion rate from the study, reported methods used to address sampling bias) and internal validity of the study (methods used to obtain data on dependent and independent variables, reference period, reported validation, and reliability of used methods; treatment of confounding factors; data on the loss of follow-up, appropriateness of the used statistical methods, reporting of the tested hypotheses, precision of the estimates, and sample size justification).\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 5 of 48\n2.4. Qualitative and Quantitative Synthesis\nStudies were summarized in a narrative synthesis with two summary tables: per study and per type of independent variable (determinants). All determinants were grouped into 4 types according to the previous studies, knowledge, and experience as follows: support, conflict, individual characteristics, and organizational context. Support is defined as \u201can interpersonal transaction of help from a support source to the help receiver that involves emotions, material assistance, and information and that takes place in a specific family, work, or care-giving context\u201d [44]. Conflict refers to a workplace phenomenon that is not harmful when handled objectively and in a timely manner but that leads to lost communication, affecting people and work performance when not handled at all or handled wrongly [45]. In addition to other factors, individual characteristics, such as perceived self-efficacy, coping strategies, sense of defeat, or demographic characteristics, could be related to burnout. The organizational context of burnout is described by the areas of work life, including workload, reward, fairness, and values [46]. The support category included support from colleagues, support from a supervisor, support from the community, emotional support, and social facilitators [47\u201349]. The conflict determinant group comprised four factors: conflict with colleagues, emotional strain, parent criticism, and obstacles from parents or students. All of these factors were identified in two studies [48,49]. By reading about how each of those factors were defined, we decided to remove emotional strain from our list, as it represented the same construct as emotional exhaustion, which was not taken into account as a predictor but only as an output. Conflict with colleagues and parent criticism were found in the study by Feuerhahn et al. [48], and we selected their beta coefficients and standard errors in the most complete model. In the study by Salanova et al. [49], a single model predicting emotional exhaustion was available, which we took the data from. We ended up with three data points. The category of individual characteristics comprised seven determinants: emotional dissonance, teacher self-efficacy (in managing student behavior), emotional exhaustion at the first wave of data collection (T1), depersonalization at T1, cynicism at T1, neuroticism (defined as \u201cindividuals who score high on neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody, and to experience such feelings as anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, guilt, depressed mood, and loneliness\u201d) [50], and job satisfaction. Each of those determinants was tested in one of the four following studies, namely the studies by Feuerhahn et al. [48], Malinen et al. [51], Salanova et al. [49], and Goddard et al. [52], except for teacher self-efficacy, which was tested in two different studies. Furthermore, given the fact that most studies have investigated emotional exhaustion as the main dimension of burnout, this was our primary focus of the study. Additionally, and since not all studies provided the standard error value but only the p-values, the next step was to transform the values using a two-tailed standard normal Z-table. We divided the beta regression coefficient by the z-score and obtained the standard error. We standardized each beta regression coefficient by dividing them by their standard error, and the obtained data points were plotted using R. For the organizational context category, in the table of determinants we included 10 factors: time pressure, classroom disruption, perceived collective exhaustion, perceived collective cynicism, workload stressors, technical obstacles, effective class management, work climate (pressure), supportive school climate, and collective teacher efficacy. The factors were distributed between five articles [48,49,51\u201353]. Besides the narrative synthesis, we summarized quantitative results reported for different determinants, considering the effect estimate (a standardized slope, for example, structural equation modeling, multiple linear regression, hierarchical linear regression, or random coefficient modeling) and variability estimate (SE, CI, or at least sample size and exact p-value of the chosen model). The reported estimates were standardized (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S4) and plotted using R software to distinguish between harmful and protective determinants, following the same procedures as in the general review [41].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 6 of 48\nWith respect to the outcome, in most studies the three burnout dimensions were explored separately, while in others only emotional exhaustion was studied. Therefore, our synthesis of qualitative estimates focused on emotional exhaustion, the core dimension of burnout.\n3. Results 3.1. Description of Selected Studies\nThe PRISMA statement flowchart (Figure 1) describes the literature screening, study selection, and reasons for exclusion. The extracted data from the selected articles were stored in a table that included 240 articles for which the abovementioned variables, if available, were reported. After precise study selection and exclusion of full-text articles that described studies not conducted in teachers or studies not in compliance with inclusion or exclusion criteria, a total of 33 studies (Table 1) were included [2,47\u201349,51\u201379] and reviewed.

Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 26 of 48\nFour studies reported response rates above 60%, 8 studies between 40% and 60%, and 12 studies reported response rates below 40%. Nine studies did not provide response rates. The initial sample size varied from 78 to 5575 participants and the final simple size from 56 to 2235 persons. Most studies implemented two waves (W) of data collection; two studies [51,70] had three waves and three studies [47,52,64] had four waves. The time period between two waves was 6 months in 8 studies and 12 months in 10 studies. Some studies used shorter (5 months [56,59,60], 3\u20134 months [51], or even weeks [64]), longer (21\u201324 months [48,55,61,66]), or similar (7\u20138 months [49,69,75,78,79] and 10 months [72]) periods. Parker et al. [71] did not report the reference period. Of the 33 included studies, 13 studies used a single composite measure of burnout as a dependent variable and the other 20 studies focused on one (seven studies using emotional exhaustion (EE) as a dependent variable), two (two studies), or three (ten studies) burnout dimensions. One study [77], besides EE and personal accomplishment (PA), additionally used two dimensions of depersonalization, one regarding the students and the other one regarding their colleagues.\n3.2. Findings of the Risk of Bias Assessment\nThe RoB assessment showed that most studies assessed the major confounding factors (e.g., gender, age, marital status, work experience, level of education, income), but had external and internal validity issues due to limitations in sampling, inadequate reporting of response rates and exclusion rates, or use of self-reported instruments with uncertain validity and reliability. In more detail, the analysis of the external validity of the included studies (N = 33) within the RoB assessment demonstrated that each analyzed study was designed to detect determinants of burnout in teachers as an occupational group. Hence, all involved studies were conducted in a non-general population [2,47\u201349,51\u201379]. Similarly, self-selection of participants was demonstrated in each of the analyzed studies during a RoB assessment. Concerning the response rates across the whole sample, these were frequently either not reported [48,49,55,63,64,67,76,77,79] or were lower than 40% [47,54,56\u201358,61,62,65,66,68,72,73]. Additionally, a very frequent finding was that the exclusion (drop-out) rate from the analysis was either not reported [47,49,51,53\u201363,66,67,69,71,73,74,78,79] or was higher than 10% (e.g., failed to return the subsequent surveys, part-time work, coincidence with teachers\u2019 strike, employment contracts not remaining the same across all measurements, missing data) [2,52,65,68,70,72,75]. Additionally, we detected that in some studies the number of screened persons [49,63,67,79] or the number of eligible individuals [49,67,79] was not reported. The RoB assessment showed that sampling bias was not assessed [2,49,51,66,67,74], or it was not addressed in the analysis [2,47,49,54,66,67,74]. Laugaa et al. [67] did not report the sampling method that was used. Others did not justify the sample size completely [2,48,52,63,64,73]. The analysis of the internal validity demonstrated that several studies [2,49,51,53,56,59,60,63,64,67\u201369,72,73,75,78,79] used a reference period that was different from the one year follow-up [41,80]. In the study by Parker et al. [71], the reference period was not reported. In some studies, major confounding factors were not assessed or were only partially assessed [2,47,51,56,66,67,72\u201375,77,78]. Regarding the validity and reliability of measures used for assessing the independent variables, most were self-reported measures. Often authors did not report on the validity or reliability of these measures [49,53\u201355,79], while others used subscales with low reliability coefficients [51,52,75]. Rarely did we find that the intensity or dose of the exposure (independent) variable was not assessed in the study [54,55]. The authors in these studies only used binary variables, such as \u201cpresence/absence\u201d or \u201cyes/no\u201d.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 27 of 48\n3.3.

[54] and Innstrand et al. [66], respectively). Social support from colleagues, social support from the broader community, and lack of social support or lack of work\u2013family enrichment were examined in two or three studies. The qualitative analysis revealed specific determinants related to conflict relationships. Hence, stress due to societal demands [59] or stress due to relationships with colleagues or the organization [76] was detected as a significant determinant in a single study, while stress due to relationship with students was detected in four studies [49,59,76,79] and stress due to parental criticism was detected in three studies [48,49,79]. Certain individual characteristics were studied in a single study (e.g., negative affectivity in the study by Houkes et al. [65], interpersonal rejection sensitivity in the study by Bianchi et al. [55], self-doubt in the study by Burke et al. [54]), whereas others were studied in several studies (e.g., perceived self-efficacy [2,48,51,56,68,74,78] or avoidance coping [67,68,71,73]). Finally, within the category of organizational context determinants, a lack of stimulation and narrow client contacts (e.g., \u201cI spend most of my time in my job in direct contact with other people\u201d) were detected as significant determinants of burnout only in the study\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 36 of 48\nby Burke et al. [57]. On the contrary, ambiguity and conflict were detected as significant determinants in three studies [57,69,78], while time pressure, work pressure, and workload were detected in six studies [48,52,65,68,69,78]. Most of the determinants showed a detrimental effect. Work setting characteristics [58], sources of stress [58,59,68], heterogeneous classes [75], loss of status [59], downward identification [60], lack of social integration [54], and disruptive students or classroom interruptions [48,54], as well as perceived inequity in relationships with students, colleagues, and the organization [76] are some of the examples of determinants with detrimental effects. On the other hand, we also identified determinants with protective effects, such as innovation [52], school climate [51,78], perceived self-efficacy [2,48,51,56,68,74,78], or social support from colleagues [47,61] or from the broader community [47,48,68].\n3.4. Quantitative Synthesis of Burnout Determinants in Teachers\nThe quantitative synthesis added a certain value to the qualitative findings. We finally obtained a list of 6 articles [47\u201349,51\u201353] that satisfied the criteria for the quantitative synthesis (Table 3). Table 3 refers to the list of burnout determinants that were analyzed via quantitative synthesis. The three studies [47\u201349] on the support group (determinants analyzed: support from colleagues, supervisor, and community; emotional support; social facilitators) are represented individually in Figure 2. Each point represents an association between the input (in this case, support) and output (emotional exhaustion). When the coefficient is positive, a positive correlation is shown, which indicates that support increases emotional exhaustion, causing a detrimental relationship. Conversely, for a negative coefficient, a negative correlation is shown, which means that support decreases emotional exhaustion and we have a protective relationship.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

Interpretation of Findings\nWhen interpreting the findings, one should take into consideration the risk of bias in the included studies. In this review, the risk of bias assessment resulted in a variety of methodological issues. All analyzed studies showed external or internal validity issues, mainly due to limitations in sampling, inadequate reporting of response rates and exclusion rates, or use of self-reported instruments with uncertain validity and reliability. Therefore, the sources of this bias should be carefully considered in future studies on burnout in teachers. This systematic review showed that some burnout determinants were studied more frequently than the others (e.g., lack of stimulation and narrow client contacts in only one study; ambiguity or conflict in three studies; time pressure, work pressure, workload, or perceived self-efficacy in six or more studies). Role ambiguity [81\u201384] and workload or time pressure [85\u201388] were detected as significant burnout determinants in different settings. Perceived self-efficacy is frequently studied as a burnout determinant, mainly in teachers, but also in other occupations [89\u201391]. Surprisingly, support determinants were not so frequently analyzed (e.g., lack of social integration, work-to-family or family-to-work facilitation, social support from colleagues, social support from the broader community, lack of social support, lack of work\u2013family enrichment), although they were frequently detected as determinants in burnout research [92\u201395]. Several determinants related to conflict relationships (e.g., stress due to societal demands or stress due to relationships with colleagues) were detected as significant determinants in one study, while stress due to relationships with students or parental criticism was detected in several of the analyzed\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 40 of 48\nstudies. The interpersonal relationships and their associations with burnout were also studied in health care workers [96\u201398]. The identified determinants mostly showed detrimental effects (e.g., work setting characteristics as a composite score of inadequate orientation, workload, lack of stimulation, scope of client contacts, unclear institutional goals, lack of autonomy, poor leadership, and social isolation; sources of stress; heterogeneous classes; downward identification; lack of social integration; disruptive students or classroom interruptions; or perceived inequity in relationships with students, colleagues, and the organization). In line with the job demands\u2013 resources model of burnout [28,99], a lack of stimulation, narrow client contacts, downward identification, and ambiguity conflict are typical job demands, while a supportive school climate, autonomy, effective class management, and social support from colleagues and the broader community are classified as job resources. The quantitative synthesis refined the importance of burnout determinants in teachers and was conducted on six selected studies. According to our observations, most of the data did not sustain the assumption that support is beneficial in reducing emotional exhaustion, the core dimension of burnout, although colleagues\u2019 support seemed to be in line with the assumptions but without strong evidence. In fact, the strongest evidence contradicted the assumptions, since the community support increased the emotional exhaustion. The authors [47] noted that this is a contradictory and unexpected finding that could be explained by \u2018the downside of empathy\u2019 (i.e., principals and teachers who feel supported by the community, are more connected to the community, and also more vulnerable to the community stress). This effect was stronger in principals and teachers working in primary schools because they were part of a smaller community than those working in secondary schools, and might be more connected to the community and more affected by its stressors. Nevertheless, we need to explain our findings. All notable effects of support were present in the study by Beausaert et al. [47], who took into account several time intervals over one year and focused on burnout over a longer period (4 years in total vs. 2 years for Feuerhahn et al. [48] and 6 months for Salanova et al. [49]). Focusing on only the first wave of this study (as was the case in the other studies), we would only have a single measurement point during follow-up. Therefore, it is necessary to question how the development goes after burnout is first detected, namely whether it improves, deteriorates, or remains stable. This will probably depend on whether any actions are taken. Lastly, putting these results in perspective, we can consider the few statistically significant effects (positive relationship with community support and negative relationship with colleagues\u2019 support) as suggestive rather than solid evidence. In the study by Kim et al. [100], fourteen empirical studies on burnout in students were reviewed and support was found to be negatively associated with all three burnout dimensions. Similarly, a systematic review of the work environment and burnout, not confined to any specific occupational group, showed moderately strong evidence of a relationship between low workplace support and increased emotional exhaustion [101]. Within the conflict group, even though parental criticism was quite far from zero (beta = 0.24, SE = 0.16, beta/SE = 0.24/0.16 = 1.5), none of the factors tested were statistically significant. As there was no significant factor in this group, we interpreted that parental criticism, conflict with colleagues, and obstacles from parents or students did not influence in any way the occurrence of emotional exhaustion. However, qualitative syntheses in the actual systematic review as well as in other studies [102,103] showed the positive relationships of obstacles with burnout. It has to be taken into consideration that the non-significant findings regarding conflict determinants in this review could be also due to the bias in these studies. We observed that all analyzed individual characteristics, except emotional dissonance, were statistically significant. They all showed a positive relationship, i.e., increasing the determinant\u2019s value increases the values of emotional exhaustion. However, the results were not exactly as expected. For the determinant \u201cneuroticism\u201d, it seemed logical that this individual characteristic favored the development of emotional exhaustion, and similar\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 41 of 48\nfindings were also shown in other studies [104\u2013106]. The syntheses highlighted the \u201cemotional exhaustion at T1\u201d as a determinant of emotional exhaustion with subsequent waves of data collection. Therefore, future studies must take into account the levels of burnout dimensions at T1 as confounding factors that are necessary to control for. We also observed positive relationships between teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction with emotional exhaustion. These individual characteristics showed an inverse association of what we expected. Indeed, the literature has shown negative relationships between self-efficacy and job satisfaction with burnout [74,107,108]. A possible explanation for this result could be that the measure of one of those factors hides another factor. For example, a high level of job satisfaction may be reached only by working hard, implying one or more \u201chidden\u201d burnout determinants (e.g., high workload). Teacher self-efficacy may also depend on how much discipline the teacher has. If the teacher does not encounter any difficulty with students, then there would be no reason for teacher self-efficacy to be especially high, as there was no \u201ctesting\u201d occasion. Additionally, extensive indiscipline management may lead the teacher to think that they are a bad teacher and may reduce teacher self-efficacy. The results for teacher self-efficacy were significant and consistent, showing positive relationships. This strengthened the evidence that teacher self-efficacy contributes to the emergence of emotional exhaustion. However, we cannot directly compare the two studies. Firstly, this was because teacher self-efficacy was not measured with the same tool. Feuerhahn et al. [48] used a scale developed by Schmitz and Schwarzer in 2000, while Malinen et al. [51] used the Finnish version of the Teacher Self-Efficacy for Inclusive Practices (TEIP) scale. Secondly, emotional exhaustion as an output also was not measured in the same way in both studies (Educator MBI vs. Finnish version of the Bergen Burnout Indicator 15 scale). However, the results of the two studies might still be comparable, despite using different measurement tools. The analysis of the determinants belonging to the category of organizational context highlighted three significant points (perceived collective exhaustion, work climate, and classroom disruption). Perceived collective exhaustion and work climate (measured by \u201cwork pressure\u201d or the degree to which the pressure of work and time urgency dominate the job environment) both had detrimental effects on emotional exhaustion. This seemed reasonable, as they probably were connected. Perceiving exhaustion in colleagues is part of a bad work climate. Moreover, classroom disruption could also additionally worsen the work climate. Actually, collective exhaustion and classroom disruption could be seen as \u201csubfactors\u201d of work climate. Another element that caught our attention was the non-significance of the determinant \u201ctime pressure\u201d, contrary to our initial beliefs based on the literature that it would have a detrimental effect on emotional exhaustion by increasing stress [109\u2013112]. A possible explanation for this result could be the lower level of time pressure within the teaching sector. As the teaching occupation\u2019s environment is not very dynamic (i.e., the activities are planned in advance), teachers are probably less exposed to time pressure than health care workers for example.\n4.2. Methodological Considerations\nThis systematic review demonstrated extensive variability in the field of research of burnout determinants in teachers, with different time periods between the waves in different studies. This variability was illustrated by several points. Firstly, the qualitative synthesis stage detected a wide range of determinants of burnout among teachers. This systematic review identified 61 factors that were highly correlated with burnout in teachers, which were studied in longitudinal settings. A wide spectrum of burnout determinants has been previously studied in teachers, not only in longitudinal studies, which we included in our systematic review, but also in cross-sectional studies [113,114]. However, quantitative synthesis revealed only six studies that had highlighted certain factors demonstrating clear significant protective or detrimental effects.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 42 of 48\nSecondly, this review highlighted the heterogeneity in the criteria used to define and measure burnout in the literature. The authors referred to a variety of statements stemming from the original definitions of burnout (Freudenberger from 1974 [115]; Cherniss from 1980 [116]; Maslach and Jackson from 1981 [14]; Shirom from 1989 [117]; Schaufeli and Enzmann from 1998 [118]; Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, and Schaufeli from 2001 [28]; Kristensen, Borritz, Villadsen, and Christensen from 2005 [119]). The definition used by Maslach and Jackson from 1981 [14] was the most frequently referenced, while six studies [48,64,65,70,72,73] did not report a definition of burnout at all. Additionally, we found that the different studies analyzed in this review used different instruments for burnout measurements. The authors mostly used different versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) [14], while several studies based their analyses on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) [120], Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire [121], Bergen Burnout Indicator [122], or Shirom\u2013Melamed Burnout Measure [123]. Furthermore, we detected differences between studies in the measures that were used as dependent variables (e.g., composite measures of burnout; one, two, or three burnout dimensions; or two different dimensions of depersonalization). This review identified a lack of consensus on the use of the burnout construct in measuring exposure and responses to occupational stress, with similar findings to those found in a study on physicians [124]. Different burnout definitions and different measurement tools used in research resulted in very low comparability of findings and results obtained through longitudinal studies on teacher burnout. Similar methodological heterogeneity among the studies in terms of shifting definitions of burnout and questions around the measurement tools of the burnout construct was also detected in healthcare workers [124\u2013129] and other occupational groups [101,130,131]. Another issue that was revealed in this systematic review was the methodological inconsistency in the longitudinal studies, namely the different numbers of waves of data collection and the time periods between the waves. Similar differences were found through literature searches in other occupational groups as well [66,102,132\u2013140]. It is obvious that there is a need to harmonize the coordination and development of longitudinal studies in burnout research [141]. Taking into account the latency of occupational burnout, as we have previously recommended [41], the longitudinal studies with multiple waves [142] should involve at least 12 months follow-up of exposed workers. Within the 33 included studies, 12 (36.4%) did not control at all or only partially controlled for confounding factors. Additionally, the reference period was shorter than the one year follow-up in 17 (51.5%) studies. It is noteworthy that the literature search did not include the gray literature due to the lack of consensus on a standardized method for searching in the gray literature, the lack of full-text studies, and the non-publishing of the gray literature in peer-reviewed journals as a quality indicator [41]. Taking into account the large number of references screened and reviewed and the multiple methodological approaches implemented in this review, there was a possibility that additional studies were published during or after finalizing this review. We checked databases for new publications up until December 2021 and no additional prospective longitudinal studies on burnout in teachers were identified. The strengths of this systematic review study are as follows. Only longitudinal studies were included, with different durations of follow-up, since cross-sectional studies do not consider temporality [143,144]. Additionally, a focus was placed on emotional exhaustion as the main component of occupational burnout. This is a consensually accepted dimension of occupational burnout that is measured by almost all available tools, including the most valid ones [41]. As in our previously published systematic review [41], we recommend that future research considers a longitudinal design with multiple waves [142], with at least one year follow-up of exposed workers. Finally, we performed a comprehensive risk of bias assessment according to the most validated and appropriate tools (MEVORECH).\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5776 43 of 48\nBeyond the given recommendations for future research in the field of burnout in teachers, the practical implications of this review can be seen through the identified detrimental determinants of teacher exhaustion. These factors should be targeted as a priority within the development of prevention programs on burnout in teachers. Tackling the detected determinants of teacher exhaustion could reduce the prevalence of burnout among teachers.\n5. Conclusions\nThis systematic review, particularly the quantitative synthesis phase, identified several detrimental determinants (job satisfaction, work climate (pressure), teacher self-efficacy, neuroticism, perceived collective exhaustion, classroom disruption) of teacher exhaustion. These findings are especially important due to the longitudinal design of the included studies published for this occupational group over a period of 30 years. The results of the protective determinants were inconsistent between studies, varying from wave to wave, while due to the high variability in measures between studies we were not able to clearly state which determinants truly influence emotional exhaustion. In general, the difficulty in conducting this kind of systematic review has always been the lack of harmonization in the outcome measures and study protocols in general. We recommend that authors in the future research consider using standardized methods and harmonized protocols, such as those assessed and developed in OMEGA-NET [37\u201339,145] and other research consortia.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijerph19095776/s1: Supplementary Figure S1: The full literature search strategy.
