Cross-Cultural Examination of Social Feedback Effects: Conduct similar experiments across different cultural contexts to explore if the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning are universal or culture-specific. This research could involve participants from various ethnic backgrounds and use facial feedback from diverse cultural groups to determine if cultural familiarity influences the learning process in the same way across different populations.

Gender and Age Effects on Implicit Learning with Social Feedback: Investigate how gender and age might modulate the impact of social feedback on implicit learning. This could involve comparing performance across different gender groups and age ranges to see if there are differential sensitivities to in-group versus out-group feedback among these groups, possibly due to varying levels of social identity development or cognitive maturation.

Impact of Explicit Awareness of Group Identity on Learning: Design experiments to specifically measure how the explicit awareness of group identity prior to learning tasks influences the effect of social feedback on learning outcomes. This could include manipulating the degree of emphasis on group identities before the task and assessing how this awareness affects the allocation of cognitive resources and learning efficiency.

Long-Term Retention and Transfer Effects: Explore the long-term retention of implicitly learned knowledge and the transferability of this knowledge across different contexts when in-group versus out-group social feedback is used. This would involve follow-up tests after an extended period since the initial learning phase and assessing participants' ability to apply learned knowledge to new, untrained tasks.

Neurobiological Mechanisms Underlying Social Feedback Effects: Use neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI or EEG, to investigate the neural correlates of implicit learning under conditions of in-group versus out-group social feedback. This research could help identify specific brain areas and networks involved in processing social feedback and their roles in facilitating or hindering the implicit learning process, offering insights into the biological foundations of social influence on learning.
