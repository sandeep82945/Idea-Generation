1. **Exploring the use of other pre-trained language models for emotion representation.** The paper uses CLIP for emotion representation, but other pre-trained language models, such as BERT or GPT-3, could also be explored. These models may be able to provide a more nuanced understanding of emotion, which could lead to more realistic and expressive talking faces.


2. **Investigating the use of different diffusion models for face generation.** The paper uses a DDPM-based diffusion model for face generation, but other diffusion models, such as LDMs or Score-Based Generative Models, could also be explored. These models may be able to generate higher-quality faces with fewer artifacts.


3. **Developing a method for generating talking faces from unaligned videos.** The paper's method requires aligned videos as input, which can be a limitation in some applications. Developing a method that can generate talking faces from unaligned videos would be a valuable contribution to the field.


4. **Exploring the use of TGDM for other face manipulation tasks.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of TGDM for talking face generation and face swapping, but it could also be explored for other face manipulation tasks, such as face aging, face beautification, and face editing.


5. **Investigating the use of TGDM for generating 3D talking faces.** The paper's method generates 2D talking faces, but it could be extended to generate 3D talking faces. This would be a challenging task, but it would have the potential to create even more realistic and immersive talking faces.
