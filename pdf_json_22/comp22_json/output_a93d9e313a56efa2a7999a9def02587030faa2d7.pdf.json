    "abstractText": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a critical role in the progression of various diseases. Accurately identifying the associations between piRNAs and diseases is important for diagnosing and prognosticating diseases. Although some computational methods have been proposed to detect piRNA-disease associations, it is challenging for these methods to effectively capture nonlinear and complex relationships between piRNAs and diseases because of the limited training data and insufficient association representation.",

            "text": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a kind of novel small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with 24\u201335 nucleotides [1,2], often binding to Piwi-subfamily Argonaute proteins [3]. Recently, it is indicated that piRNAs play critical roles in various biological processes by emerging evidences, such as slicing transposable elements in animal\u2019s germline [4], genome defence [5], histone modification [6].\nMore and more studies have revealed that piRNA abnormal expression leads to many dis-\neases, including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, geriatric diseases, etc [7]. Several biological experiments show that piRNAs are able to be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets to diagnose and prognosticate diseases [7,8]. Therefore, it is essential to identify piRNA-disease associations to uncover the pathogenesis of diseases by developing computational methods.\nSome databases for piRNA-disease interaction have been constructed. For example, piRDi-\nsease v1.0 [9] collects 7939 manually curated associations between 4796 piRNAs and 28 diseases. NcRPheno [10] is a comprehensive ncRNA-disease database containing 1282 experimentally validated piRNA-disease associations. MNDR v3.0 [11] has been proposed to integrate different kinds of ncRNA-disease associations supported by biological literatures, where 13128 piRNA-disease associations between 13365 human piRNAs and 21 diseases are collected. The newly constructed databases store more and more piRNA-disease association information. As a result, the interactions between piRNAs and diseases become sparser and more complex. Therefore, advanced machine learning techniques which are able to fully make use of the available data are the keys to enhance the predictive performance of piRNA-disease association identification.\nTo reveal the complex interactions between ncRNAs and diseases, several computational\nmethods for ncRNAs-diseases association detection have been proposed. There are mainly three categories of methods for ncRNAs-diseases association detection, including methods based on similarity measure [12,13], methods based on machine learning [14,15] and methods based on network [16]. The research on piRNA-disease association detection is still needed, because the performance of existing computational predictors is still relatively low. Recently,\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 2 / 15\nseveral methods based on machine learning have been proposed for predicting piRNA-disease associations. For example, Wei et.al. [17] proposed the first piRNA-disease association predictor iPiDA-PUL employing positive unlabeled learning to select negative samples from all unlabeled piRNA-disease associations. With the development of deep learning and its efficiency in processing non-linear data, the deep learning methods are used to extract the features for piRNA-disease predictor [18\u201320]. For example, the iPiDA-sHN [18] predictor extracted features by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and then trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with selected high quality negative samples and positive samples. DFL-PiDA [19] based on extreme learning machine model employed a convolutional denoising auto-encoder to extract hidden features. The iPiDA-GBNN predictor [20] based on GrowNet [21] stacked auto-encoder to extract piRNA features.\nThe existing predictors provide promising results for detecting novel piRNA-disease associ-\nations. However, there are still three main problems: (i) With the rapid growth of data, methods based on machine learning showed lower generalization ability and failed to capture more complex and nonlinear relationships between piRNAs and diseases in larger and sparer datasets. (ii) The existing predictors all represent piRNA-disease associations by concatenating piRNA and disease attribute features, ignoring the structure semantic information of biological networks. (iii) The existing deep-learning-based methods treat piRNA-disease association data as Euclidean or grid-like structure data. In fact, the piRNA-disease associations are organized as networks, where the piRNAs or diseases are modelled as vertices, and the associations are viewed as edges. As a result, the existing methods fail to capture complex interactions among piRNA and disease entities, and learn the hidden association patterns in the graphstructured data [22]. To process the complex graph structure data efficiently with deep learning methods, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) [23,24] are proposed to generalize CNN from grid-structured data to graph-structured data, and learn node representations by capturing complex graph structure information and aggregating neighbour node information in the graph. Due to GCN\u2019s powerful ability of capturing complex structure information and potential association patterns, it has also been successfully applied to various tasks in bioinformatics, such as disease-gene association detection [25], drug-target interaction prediction [26,27] and drug repositioning [28].\nInspired by the effectiveness of GCN to capture nonlinear association patterns from com-\nplex networks, a novel computational method named iPiDA-GCN is proposed to identify piRNA-disease associations. In particular, two GCN modules are designed to capture the rich semantic information of different biological networks. Asso-GCN module is applied to learn node representations from the piRNA-disease association network, where piRNA node features are learned from associated disease nodes, and disease node features are learned from associated piRNA nodes. Sim-GCN modules are used to further learn the node representations from two homogeneous similarity networks, where piRNA node representations are obtained based on the piRNA neighbour information, and disease node representations are obtained in the same way. Finally, we treat this problem as a link prediction task, and predict the piRNAdisease association scores based on learned features. The experimental results show that iPiDA-GCN outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods, and the visualization of the prediction results further illuminates the advantages of iPiDA-GCN."

The piRNA-disease association adjacency matrix is represented as APD in Eq 2, where ai,j = 1 if the i-th piRNA is associated with the j-th disease with experimental verification, otherwise ai,j = 0.\nAPD \u00bc\na1;1 a1;2 . . . a1;n a2;1 a2;2 \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd a2;n\n.. . .. . . . . .. .\nam;1 am;2 \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd am;n\n2\n6 6 6 6 6 6 4\n3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 5\n\u00f02\u00de\nThe other two types of edges named \u2018similarity edge\u2019 are contained in the similarity subnet-\nworks, and calculated based on the biological entities\u2019 information. Specifically, piRNApiRNA similarity Sp is obtained based on piRNA sequence information, downloaded from piRBase v3.0 [29]. The sequence information contains the attribute information of non-coding RNAs, and the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm [30] can effectively capture the functional similarities among RNAs. In this study, the piRNA sequence similarity Sp(pi, pk) between i-th piRNA pi and k-th piRNA pk is computed as:\nSp pi; pk\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc SW\u00f0pi; pk\u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nSW\u00f0pi; pi\u00de \ufffd SW\u00f0pk; pk\u00de p \u00f03\u00de\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 4 / 15\nwhere the SW(pi, pk) is the sequence alignment value between the i-th piRNA and k-th piRNA calculated by the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm [30].\nDisease-disease similarity is computed based on disease ontology (DO) [31], which is used as a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies [32]. DO is capable of translating molecular findings from high-throughput data to clinical relevance. DOSE [33] provides different semantic similarity algorithms based on DO terms. The algorithm based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) [34] has been widely used in ncRNA-disease association detection [35\u201337]. It cannot only provide consistent semantic similarities, but also can detect potential relations between complex diseases. Therefore, the disease semantic similarity between\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671.g001\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 5 / 15\ndisease dk and disease dj is be calculated as [34]:\nSd dk; dj \ufffd \ufffd \u00bc\nP t2Tk\\Tj\n\u00f0Sdk\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe Sdj\u00f0t\u00de\u00de P\nt2Tk Sdk\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe P t2Tj Sdj\u00f0t\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Tk is the set containing all diseases in the DAG of disease dk, and Sdk\u00f0t\u00de denotes the semantic contribution of disease t2Tk to the k-th disease calculated by [34]:\nSdk\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc maxfa \ufffd Sdk\u00f0t0\u00dejt 0 2 children of\u00f0t\u00deg if dk 6\u00bc dj Sdk\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 otherwise \u00f05\u00de\n(\nwhere \u03b1 is the semantic contribution factor set as 0.5 following [34]. The farther the distance between disease t and its ancestor is, the lower the semantic contribution of disease t to disease dk is.\nNode representation. There are two types of nodes representing piRNAs and diseases in\nthe constructed heterogeneous piRNA-disease association network. In this study, random walk with restart (RWR) [38] is employed to optimize the connectivity relationships among the same biological entities, especially for the non-neighbouring and higher-order nodes, and then the optimized similarity matrices are used as the initial feature matrices. The piRNA sequence similarity matrix and disease semantic similarity matrix are used as the input of RWR. The initial node features can be obtained by considering the global topology information of each network. The piRNA node representation generated by RWR is calculated as [38]:\nPk\u00fe1i;j \u00f0i\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 a\u00deei;j \u00fe aP k i;j\u00f0i\u00deSp\u00f0pi; pj\u00de \u00f06\u00de\nP\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc \u00bdP1i;1\u00f0i\u00de;P 1 i;2\u00f0i\u00de; . . . ;P 1 i;j \u00f0i\u00de; . . . ;P 1 i;m\u00f0i\u00de\ufffd \u00f07\u00de\nwhere Pki;j\u00f0i\u00de denotes the probability of walking from piRNA node pi to node pj after k steps. ei,j denotes the initial probability of walking from piRNA node pi to node pj, which is the element of an identity matrix. Sp(pi, pj) denotes the transition probability obtained from similarity matrix Sp, \u03b1 is the restart probabilities. The probability of pi associated with all the other piRNA nodes are concatenated to generate the node representation P(i) for piRNA pi. Similarly, the disease node representation D(i) can be represented as [38]:\nDk\u00fe1i;j \u00f0i\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 a\u00deei;j \u00fe aD k i;j\u00f0i\u00deSd\u00f0di ;dj\u00de \u00f08\u00de\nD\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc \u00bdD1i;1\u00f0i\u00de;D 1 i;2\u00f0i\u00de; . . . ;D 1 i;j \u00f0i\u00de; . . . ;D 1 i;n\u00f0i\u00de\ufffd \u00f09\u00de\nTo overcome the problem of insufficient representation, the feature dimension of each dis-\nease node is further extended from 19 to 1000 with polynomial features derived from the original input features, which can better reflect the interactions of different features in different dimensions. Specifically, polynomial features denote the polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree. For example, given a disease node represented by the semantic similarities with three diseases a, b and c, it can be extended by degree-2 polynomial features as \u00bda; b; c; a2; a\ufffd b; a\ufffd c; b2; b\ufffd c; c2\ufffd.\nGCN-based node feature extraction\nThe key step of identifying piRNA-disease associations is node representation based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN). GCN can aggregate neighbour node information, and capture the hidden network structures to powerfully extract discriminative node features. Therefore,\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 6 / 15\nwe employ GCN to learn the features of piRNA and disease nodes from the heterogeneous piRNA-disease association network.\nLet Hl2Rd denotes the node embedding of l-th GCN layer, the node embedding Hl+12Rd is computed by (l+1)-th GCN layer according to [24] as:\nHl\u00fe1 \u00bc s ~D 12~S ~D 12HlWl \ufffd \ufffd\n\u00f010\u00de\n~S \u00bc I\u00fe S \u00f011\u00de\n~D\u00f0i; i\u00de \u00bc X\nj ~S\u00f0i; j\u00de \u00f012\u00de\nwhere S is the adjacency matrix denoting the relationships among all nodes in the network, and I is an identity matrix. ~D represents the degree matrix of ~S, Wl denotes the trainable parameter matrix of GCN model, \u03c3(\ufffd) is a nonlinear activation function.\nTwo main modules Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN are designed to extract node representation.\nAs shown in Fig 1B, Asso-GCN is adopted to aggregate node information from the piRNAdisease interaction network, Gasso = {Vp, Vd, Ep\u2212d} where Vp and Vd represent piRNA and disease nodes respectively, while Ep\u2212d represents the interactions between piRNA and disease nodes. The piRNA node features are captured from neighbor disease node information and vice versa. Secondly, Sim-GCN is further used to capture semantic information from two different homogeneous similarity networks. The node representations obtained by Asso-GCN are viewed as initial node features in Sim-GCN module. The constructed piRNA-piRNA similarity network Gp = {Vp, Ep\u2212p} and disease-disease similarity network Gd = {Vd, Ed\u2212d} are two main inputs for Sim-GCN. PiRNA node representations are generated by capturing neighbor piRNA information and disease node representations are learned from neighbor disease information. It is worth noting that batch normalization [39] is conducted following each deep learning module so as to reduce internal covariate shift and increase stability.\nThe reasons why we designed Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN modules to learn node representa-\ntions in turn are as followings: In Asso-GCN module, GCN captures node information from the bi-partite piRNA-disease graph, where node representations are only learned from their heterogeneous neighbor nodes. However, piRNA-disease associations are too sparse to provide enough information for GCN to capture discriminative representations. Therefore, we introduce side information, including disease semantic similarity and piRNA sequence similarity. Then, we performed Sim-GCN on the similarity networks to fine-tune the node representations by their homogeneous neighbor nodes.\nAssociation prediction for piRNAs and diseases\nTo further eliminate redundancy and noise, three consecutive fully connected layers are designed to extract high-level node features. There are 400, 200 and 100 neurons in each layer. Given a piRNA node representation hpi and a disease node representation hdj extracted from GCN modules, the final piRNA and disease node representation h0pi and h 0 dj can be obtained through the dense operation. Then the association score between piRNA pi and disease dj is calculated as:\nUi;j \u00bc h 0 pi h0dj T \u00f013\u00de\nwhere U is the final prediction score matrix. The higher the element Ui,j is, the more likely piRNA pi is associated with disease dj.\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 7 / 15\nThe mean square error is adopted as the loss function to minimize the Frobenius norm of the difference between predicted score matrix U and label matrix APD. However, the number of negative associations is much more than that of positive associations. In order to alleviate the imbalance of training samples, \u03b1-enhanced loss function [25,40] focusing on positive sample learning is used, and can be formulated as:\nLoss \u00bc k~APD Uk 2 F \u00fe mkWk 2 2 \u00f014\u00de\nwhere\n~APD \u00bc 0 if APD\u00f0i; j\u00de \u00bc 0 or APD\u00f0i; j\u00de 2 Sindependent\na otherwise \u00f015\u00de\n(\n~APD is the enhanced association matrix generated based on the original adjacency matrix APD. \u03b1 is a hyper parameter controlling the margin between true labels and predicted scores. \u03bc is a decay factor regulating all trainable model parameters W. U is the predicted score matrix predicted by iPiDA-GCN."

The number of GCN layers has an important impact on the predictive performance. The influence of the different number of GCN layers is shown in Table 1, from which we can see the followings: (i) iPiDA-GCN turns to approximately randomly guess without using GCN module (layers = 0), where the input features are directly processed by fully connected layers and inner production. It achieves better performance when using GCN to capture the potential network structures. The reason is that limited GCN layers cannot capture enough structural information, while stacking more GCN layers can expand the receptive field with aggregating high-order connected node information to obtain expressive representations. (ii) When more layers are added, the performance of iPiDA-GCN gradually increases in terms of both AUC and AUPR, but its performance decreases when more than two layers are added. The reason is that more layers may introduce more noise and irrelevant information into node representation learning, leading to over-smoothing\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671.t001\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 8 / 15\nand performance decrement [44,45]. We conclude that GCN with two layers cannot only capture the complex interaction patterns, but also incorporate the node attribute features for representation learning so as to enhance the predictive ability.\nImpact of the different components on the performance of iPiDA-GCN\nThere are three main components in iPiDA-GCN for extracting node features, including a fully connected network, Asso-GCN and Sim-GCN. To analyze the contributions of different components in iPiDA-GCN, three comparative baseline predictors (iPiDA-FN, iPiDA-AssoGCN and iPiDA-SimGCN) are constructed, where iPiDA-FN is constructed only by a fully connected network, while iPiDA-AssoGCN and iPiDA-SimGCN are constructed by combining different GCN modules and fully connected networks. Their performance along with iPiDA-GCN is shown in Table 2, from which we can see the followings: (i) Compared with iPiDA-FN, two predictors based on GCN modules achieve much better performance, indicating that GCN contributes to node representations; (ii) Sim-GCN plays a more important role than Asso-GCN for capturing semantic information from two similarity networks; (iii) iPiDA-GCN is superior to all the other baseline predictors, indicating that different components are complementary and contribute to extracting high-level node features, leading to performance improvement.\nPerformance comparison among different methods\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of iPiDA-GCN, three state-of-the-art predictors are compared, including iPiDA-PUL [17], iPiDA-sHN [18] and piRDA [46]. All these three predictors have released the source codes or constructed the web servers, facilitating fair performance comparison. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of different learning node representations on the performance of piRNA-disease association prediction, a predictor iPiDA-DW based on the node representation algorithm DeepWalk [47] is also compared with our method, which performs on the heterogeneous piRNA-disease network ignoring node attribute information, and computes association scores followed by full connection networks and inner production. The results of various methods on Sindependent are listed in Table 3, from which we can see the followings: (i) iPiDA-GCN achieves the best performance; (ii) Compared with the methods based on node attribute iPiDA-PUL [17], iPiDA-sHN [18] and piRDA [46], iPiDA-GCN is able to capture hidden structural features, leading to better performance; (iii) Compared with iPiDA-DW which is a method based on network embedding, iPiDA-GCN cannot only incorporate hidden structural and attribute features, but also can learn discriminative node representations through two-level GCNs.\nVisualization of predicted associations by iPiDA-GCN\nIn order to explore why iPiDA-GCN is able to accurately predict the potential associations between piRNAs and diseases, the prediction results of three piRNA-disease associations in the test set (<piR-has-1002, Parkinson\u2019s disease>, <piR-has-10009, Parkinson\u2019s disease> and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671.t002\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010671 October 27, 2022 9 / 15\n<piR-has-10111, Cardiovascular disease>) are selected, and visualized in Fig 2, from which we can see the followings: (i) iPiDA-PUL [17] and iPiDA-sHN [18] predict that piR-has-1002 and piR-has-10009 are associated with cardiovascular disease without experimental verification. iPiDA-PUL is a discriminative model based on manually constructed features, failing to learn complex association patterns. iPiDA-sHN adopts CNN to extract node features, but\na Results obtained by reproducing the iPiDi-PUL predictor with the help of its source code with parameters (n_components = 200, n_estimators = 150, max_features = 0.2, number of ensemble learner = 5) b Results obtained by reproducing the iPiDA-sHN predictor with the help of its source code with parameters (C = 1.0, kernel = \u2018rbf\u2019, gamma = 1) c The parameters number-walks = 10, walk-length = 80, window-size = 10 d The results are generated with the help of the web server of piRDA (http://nsclbio.jbnu.ac.kr/tools/piRDA/).

For example, piR-hsa-31280 is down-regulated in cardiovascular disease tissues [50]. piR-hsa-8245 is up-regulated in cardiovascular disease tissue and has a higher expression about 5-fold in cardio sphere (CS) compared with cardiosphere-derived cells (CDC) [50]. piR-hsa-10732 shows down-regulation in renal cell carcinoma tissue [51]. The expression of piR-hsa-28131 is different in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-affected brain compared with the normal human brain [3]. In addition, the top five identified piRNAs associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) are differently regulated in cells between control and PD-patients [52].
