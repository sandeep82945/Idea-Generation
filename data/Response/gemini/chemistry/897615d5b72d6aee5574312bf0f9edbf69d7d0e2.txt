1. **Investigate the effects of capsomer charge on the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers.** The paper briefly explores the effects of capsomer surface charge on assembly behavior, but a more detailed study could provide valuable insights into the role of electrostatics in virus assembly. For example, one could investigate how the magnitude and distribution of capsomer charge affect the assembly pathway, the stability of the assembled structures, and the ability of the capsomers to self-correct assembly errors.


2. **Explore the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers in the presence of a genome.** The paper focuses on the self-assembly of empty capsids, but in reality, viruses also contain a genome. The presence of the genome can affect the assembly pathway and the stability of the assembled structures. It would be interesting to investigate how the deformability of the capsomers affects the assembly of capsids in the presence of a genome.


3. **Study the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers under different solution conditions.** The paper investigates the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers in an NVT ensemble at 298 K. However, the solution conditions can have a significant impact on the assembly behavior of viruses. For example, changes in temperature, pH, and ionic strength can affect the strength of the capsomerâ€“capsomer interactions and the stability of the assembled structures. It would be interesting to investigate how the deformability of the capsomers affects the assembly behavior under different solution conditions.


4. **Develop a coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers that can be used to study the assembly of more complex virus structures.** The paper develops a coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers that can be used to study the assembly of T = 1 icosahedral viruses. However, many viruses have more complex structures, such as T = 3 and T = 4 icosahedral structures and helical structures. It would be interesting to develop a coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers that can be used to study the assembly of these more complex virus structures.


5. **Use the coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers to design new virus-like particles.** The coarse-grained model of deformable capsomers could be used to design new virus-like particles (VLPs) with desired properties. VLPs are self-assembling protein structures that mimic the structure of viruses, but they do not contain a genome. VLPs can be used for a variety of applications, such as vaccine development, drug delivery, and nanotechnology. By tuning the deformability of the capsomers, it may be possible to design VLPs with improved stability, assembly efficiency, and functionality.
