            "text": "Page 2/17\n1. Introduction Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas emit many SO2 and NOX gaseous pollutants during combustion, causing serious harm to human health and ecosystems (Xiong et al. 2016, Adewuyi et al. 2016 and Li et al. 2019). Over the past few decades, several countries have taken steps to mitigate the increasingly serious consequences of air pollution. At present, as a mature method for NOx, and SO2 removal in ue gas, the treatment techniques of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet ue gas desulfurization (WFGD) has been widely applied (Yang et al. 2019, Fujii et al. 2013). \u00a0However, a high occupational area and high operation and maintenance costs make individual pollutant-treatment systems less suitable for popular application in small and medium-sized enterprises(Wang et al. 2019, Phungrassami et al. 2021 and Ssa et al. 2021). Therefore, a great attention has been attached to developing new technologies for simultaneous removal of SO2 and NOx from ue gas(Chen et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2019).\nCurrently, the oxidation-absorption process has been proved to have great advantages for simultaneous removal of NOx and SO2. Some common oxidants, including ozone, permanganate, persulfate, and hydrogen peroxide, oxidize NO and SO2 to NO2 and SO3, which are then removed in the wet ue gas desulfurization process(\u00a0Hao et al. 2017, Du et al. 2020 and Xiao et al. 2020\u00a0). However, these reactions are limited to occurring at lower pH values and produce acidic wastewater, making them di cult to use on a large scale\u00a0(\u00a0Ding et al. 2014, Ay et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2014 and Wu et al. 2017\u00a0). Zhao\u00a0(Zhao et al. 2006\u00a0)\u00a0et al. developed a gas catalytic system in which solid catalysts were placed in a xed bed to react with vaporized oxidants to reduce wastewater generation and improve removal e ciency. \u00a0\nCatalytic removal of SO2 and NOx has become one of the main research directions of air pollution control. In this technology, different types of catalysts were prepared by impregnation and hydrothermal synthesis with different elements on the carrier, SO2 and NOX were converted into other harmless gas\nPage 3/17\nemissions through redox reactions to remove pollutants\u00a0(\u00a0Wang et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2014, Zhao et al. 2016 and Gao et al. 2018). Precious metal catalyst characteristics include high activity and good stability of precious metals, which removes pollutants, although expensive. Iron-based and manganese-based catalysts are cheaper than precious metals and have better catalytic activity only at high temperatures. Tian\u00a0(Tian et al. 2019\u00a0)\u00a0et al. designed an Mn-Ce-Fe-Ti (CP-SD) catalyst with a good NO conversion e ciency and optimal reaction temperature of 250\u00b0C.\nDenitration reactions still need to be carried out at a high temperature, which is expensive and less e cient. This study used a ZSM-5 molecular sieve as the carrier, V and Cu as the active components, and Ce as the adjuvant to build upon previous research and nd a low-temperature denitration catalyst with a lower cost. The catalytic activity and its in uence on graphene oxide (GO) for SO2 and NO oxidation were investigated by impregnation synthesis( Liu et al. 2019, Ding et al. 2021, Zhang et al. 2020 and Qi et al. 2020). BET, SEM, XRD, and XPS characterization were used to study the internal structure and catalytic mechanisms. The catalyst provides a new method for the synergistic removal of multiple pollutants from coal- red ue gas.\n\u00a0\n2. Materials And Methods\n2.1.Materials All the agents used in this study were analytically pure. Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), copper nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)3-6H2O), and cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3-6H2O) were purchased from Tianjin Comio Chemical Reagent Co. Graphene oxide (GO) was purchased from Tianjin Beichen Founder Reagent Factory. ZSM-5 zeolite (Si:Al = 25) was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Plant.\n2.2.Preparation of catalysts First, GO powder were weighed and added to an empty beaker. Deionized water was added and ultrasonically dispersed for 20 min. Then 0.8037g of ammonium metavanadate and 0.8662 g of oxalic acid were added into the dispersion, dissolved, and prepared for use. Second, 5.0 g of molecular sieve was added into the dispersion, stirred in a water bath at 60\u00b0C for 3 h, mixed thoroughly, placed in a vacuum drying oven, dried at 105\u00b0C for 12 h, and then roasted at 550\u00b0C for 5 h in a mu e furnace to prepare a semi- nished catalyst with a 7% loading of V elements. Finally, 1.1806 g of copper nitrate and 1.2395 g of cerium nitrate was dissolved in a beaker, and fully mixed with the prepared semi- nished catalyst. The drying and roasting steps explained above were repeated to prepare V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO low-temperature combined desulfurization and denitration catalysts with graphene content of 0%wt, 0.1%wt, 0.3%wt, 0.5%wt, 0.7%wt, and 0.9%wt.\u00a0The samples\u00a0were marked as V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.0, V-Cu-\nPage 4/17\nCe-ZSM-5@GO0.1, V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.3, V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5, V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.7, and V-Cu-CeZSM-5@GO0.9, respectively.\n2.3.Catalytic performance evaluation Fig. 1 shows the simulated ue gas system. The simulated ue gas consisted of N2, NO, SO2, and O2, with a total ow rate of 1.5 L/min, which was controlled by four mass ow controllers (MFCs). The concentration of SO2 was 500-1300 mg/m3, NO was 300-700 mg/m3, and O2 was 6% (v/v). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a ow rate of 0.5 L/min. The ue gas was rst piped into the mixing simulator. After that, it enters the ue gas analyzer by bypass, and the concentration of SO2 and NO was recorded as Cin.\u00a0Then, the mixed gas entered a heated catalytic reactor (1.0cm in diameter and 15.0cm in length), where the catalytic reaction was carried out. The gas after catalytic reaction was detected by ue gas analyzer. At this time, the concentration of SO2 and NO was recorded as Cout, and the exhaust gas was discharged after treatment. The oxidation e ciencies of SO2 and NO were calculated using Eq. (1).\nwhere \u03b7 is the oxidation e ciency, Cin and Cout are the inlet and outlet concentrations of SO2\u00a0and NO, respectively.\n2.4.Gas product veri cation experiments Following the reaction, the gas was detected by a ue gas analyzer. NO2 was detected in the gas product, indicating that NO was oxidized to NO2 by catalytic reaction. The reacted gas was introduced into the HCl+BaCl2 solution, and over time, a white precipitate formed in the solution. These results indicated that SO2 was oxidized to SO3 by catalytic reaction, and SO3 reacted with BaCl2 solution to form BaSO4 precipitate.\n2.5.Characterization of the Catalysts BET analysis was performed at different partial pressures of nitrogen to determine the catalyst-speci c surface area and pore distribution using the BELSORP-Max II analyzer from McKick Bayer Ltd.(Wang et al. 2020). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were performed using the Zeiss sigma 500 scanning electron microscope and the Bruker XFlash 6130 equipped to observe the morphology, particle size, and dispersion of the catalyst (Lee et al. 2021). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using an Ultima IV with a scan range of 5\u00b0-90\u00b0 to test the\nPage 5/17\nelemental composition on the catalyst(Cai et al. 2021) . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using the Thermo Scienti c Escalab 250Xi analyzer to observe the valence states of various elements in the catalyst before and after the reaction(Zhang et al. 2014) .\n3. Results And Discussion\n3.1.Effect of reaction temperature The effect of temperature variation on the e ciency for desulfurization and denitration of the catalyst was investigated by adjusting the temperature in the reactor. As shown in Fig. 2, the catalytic e ciency of the catalysts( V-Ce-ZSM-5 and Cu-Ce-ZSM-5) increased rst and then decreased at the test temperature (50\u00b0C-300\u00b0C), and the optimum performance was obtained at 150\u00b0C. While reaction temperature increased, the oxidation groups and free radicals on the surface and inside of the catalyst were thermally activated(Bychkov et al. 2020,Hu et al. 2020 ), which signi cantly increases the number of activated molecules and the chemical reaction rate of the catalyst. However, with a further increase in temperature, the recombination probability of free radicals would be expedited, which is an important reason for the decrease in removal e ciency(Liu et al. 2017). So the following catalyst activity tests were all tested at a temperature of 150 \u2103.\n3.2.Effect of\u00a0V Cu and Ce\u00a0doping Fig. 3 shows the changes of desulfurization and denitration e ciency of different catalysts with the doping amount of V, Cu and Ce. With the increase of V and Cu loading from 5% to 9%, the desulfurization and denitri cation e ciency of the catalyst increased rst and then decreased. When the loading of V was 7% and the loading of Cu was 8%, the e ciency was the best. After Ce doping, the e ciency of desulfurization and denitri cation was signi cantly enhanced. When the Ce load was 7%. When the loading of Ce is 7%, the e ciency was the best.\nWith the increase of the doping amount of V, Cu and Ce in the catalyst, part of the pore structure would be occupied, and the adsorption capacity of the catalyst \u00a0for pollutants would be weakened. However, the oxidation capacity gradually increased, and the removal of pollutants changed to the oxidation process. The doping of multiple elements signi cantly increases the oxidation capacity of the catalyst, but does not always to increase, because the pollutants will rst adsorb on the adsorption site, and then the oxidation reaction occurs. With the progress of the reaction, the adsorption site gradually saturated, desulfurization and denitri cation e ciency will gradually decrease The adsorption and oxidation performance of the catalyst was best when the loading of V was 7%, Cu was 8% and Ce was 7%.\n3.3.Effect of GO doping\nPage 6/17\nFig. 4 shows the change in desulfurization and denitration e ciency of the catalyst with GO doping amount. With the increase of the amount of GO from 0% to 0.9%, the oxidation e ciency of the catalyst for SO2 and NO increased gradually, and tends to be stable after the amount of GO was 0.5%. When the doping amount of GO was 0.5%, the catalyst showed the best catalytic effect, and the oxidation e ciencies of the catalyst for SO2 and NO were 94.60% and 83.64%, respectively.\nIt was evident that the addition of GO can effectively enhance the oxidation effect of gaseous pollutants, especially NO. During the reaction, the role of GO is mainly to increase the loading of active components and increase electron mobility(Kandy et al. 2019 ).\n3.4.Characterization of the catalyst\n3.4.1.BET analysis Table 1 shows the BET characterization results of different catalysts. With the addition of V, Cu, and Ce elements, the total pore volume and the speci c surface area of the catalyst increased gradually, while the pore size became smaller. This indicated that the in ltration of the elements improved the pore structure of the original carriers, resulting in a corresponding change in the speci c surface area, thereby improving the performance of the catalysts. When the catalyst was doped with GO, the ZSM-5 was favorable for element loading(Zheng et al. 2019 ). Compared with ZSM, the speci c surface area of V-CuCe-ZSM-5@GO0.5 increased by 42.53%, resulting in an increase in the number of active sites, thus improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst.\nTable 1\u00a0 BET\u00a0characterization results of the catalysts\nSample SBET (m2/g) Pore volume (cm3/g) Average particle size (nm)\nZSM-5 170.47 0.1014 3.9173\nV-ZSM-5 184.89 0.1117 3.6242\nCu-ZSM-5 179.46 0.1169 3.3475\nV-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5 213.72 0.1511 3.1312\nV-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5 242.97 0.167 3.005\n3.4.2.SEM and EDS analysis Fig. 5 (a-c) shows the SEM images of ZSM-5, V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5, and V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5, respectively. Compared with ZSM-5, the surfaces of V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5 and V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5 were agglomerated, and several particulates were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst. The results indicated\nPage 7/17\nthat the ZSM-5 carrier could be stably loaded with V, Cu, and Ce elements during the catalyst synthesis. Furthermore, when the V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst was doped with GO, the porosity increased, and the particle division on the surface of the carrier was more uniform, which is consistent with the results of Zhang( Zhang et al. 2019) et al. These porous structures can signi cantly increase the diffusion resistance when the polluted ue gas passes through, which is bene cial to improve the effective contact area and contact time between the active components and the reactive gas, nally improve the the catalytic e ciency of V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5.\nFig. 6 shows the EDS mapping images of V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5. V, Cu, and Ce elements were uniformly distributed in the whole mixed catalyst. In addition, the results of EDS showed that the atomic ratios of V, Cu, and Ce were 2.79%, 2.53%, and 2.07%, respectively, which further con rmed the uniform xation of V, Cu, and Ce nanoparticles on the surface of ZSM-5.\n3.4.3.XRD analysis According to Fig. 7(a) displaying the XRD patterns of ZSM-5, V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5, and V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5, the diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 located at 13.24\u00b0 and 15.64\u00b0 disappeared with the loading of V, Cu, and Ce and produced obvious diffraction peaks of V2O5 and CuO at 32.520\u00b0and 48.320\u00b0, indicating that V, Cu, and Ce interacted chemically with the ZSM-5 carrier, these elements were immobilized on the ZSM-5 carrier. Meanwhile, the position of the characteristic spectra peaks did not change with the addition of GO. However, the intensity of the characteristic peaks was enhanced, indicating that the addition of GO increased element loading and enhanced the catalytic reaction intensity of the catalyst.\nFig. 7(b) shows the XRD magni cation patterns of V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5. After 2\u03b8=25\u00b0, all the diffraction peaks of V, Cu, and Ce elements appear. The diffraction peaks of 2\u03b8 at 28.549\u00b0, 33.083\u00b0, 46.486\u00b0, 56.346\u00b0, and 59.093\u00b0 belong to the characteristic peaks of CeO2 ( Marzouk et al. 2018), the diffraction peaks at 26.759\u00b0, 32.520\u00b0, 36.230\u00b0, and 41.289\u00b0 were assigned to V2O5 (Seo et al. 2015), and the peaks at 29.847\u00b0, 38.568\u00b0, 43.848\u00b0, 48.320\u00b0, and 55.257\u00b0 were the main peak patterns of CuO (He et al. 2013).\n3.4.4.XPS analysis Fig.8 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5 (a). The V, Cu and Ce elements supported on the catalyst mainly exist in the form of oxides of V2O5, CeO2, and CuO. According to the oxidation binding energy data, ne spectras of V2p (b), Cu2p (c) and Ce3d (d) were simulated . Compared with the concentration of oxygen, when V exists at a low concentration, it is often necessary to nd the vanadium binding energy with a lower spin-orbit splitting peak on one side of O1s peak and collect V2p and O1s regions together (507 eV \u2013 540 eV) to achieve accurate peak tting. V produced an asymmetric peak shape in the V2p region, while the vanadium oxide had a symmetric peak shape and a signi cantly split spin-orbit. Two prominent peaks of V metal were located at 517.2 eV and 524.4 eV, respectively, as\nPage 8/17\nshown in Fig. 8(b). The higher peak intensity indicated that vanadium oxide was dominated by V2O5 on the catalyst surface. Fig. 8(c) shows the energy spectrum of Cu2p, which could be split into two peaks, Cu2p3/2 (peak at 934.7 eV) and Cu2p1/2 (peak at 953.7 eV), these were assigned to Cu(II)(Arul et al.2020 ). Fig. 8(d) shows that the Ce3d region had well-separated spin-orbit components, each of which was further split by multiple splitting. Ce(IV) had a peak at 917eV, which was not present in the Ce(III) spectrum ( Mhatre et al.2021).\nDiscussion The reaction mechanism diagram of the low-temperature desulfurization and denitration catalyst is shown in Fig. 9. During the reaction, The V=O bond present in V2O5 serves as the active site for adsorption and oxidation of SO2, which can effectively oxidize SO2 to SO3. When the roasting temperature exceeds 500\u00b0C, part of the CeO2 will react with V2O5 to form CeVO4 with higher oxidation activity, which makes more unsaturated chemical bonding groups generated on the catalyst surface and improves the ability of the catalyst to adsorb oxygen. The CeVO4 can promote SO2 to SO3 oxidation and improve the desulfurization e ciency. Denitri cation reaction mainly uses the oxidation activity of the metal oxide CuO to oxidize NO to higher valence NOx, and when the CeO2 is added, the CeO2 will form solid solution through roasting, which can stabilize the catalyst lattice and allow more active sites to be retained. In the process of co-impregnation, vanadium and copper will form V-O-Cu bonds, during the reaction, the highly active CuVOx will be oxidized to produce Cu(I)V(4+)Ox-1, and the reduction of vanadium can be promoted in the presence of copper, thus improving the overall effectiveness of the catalyst for desulfurization and denitri cation(BYesen et al.2014 ).\nDensity functional theory studies have shown that the hydroxyl groups on the surface of graphene oxide can enhance the adsorption of SO2 and NO. After the dissociation of molecular O2, highly reactive epoxy groups will be formed on the surface of graphene oxide, and hydroxyl SO2 and epoxy groups will form a unique charge transfer channel. The electrons are transferred from the hydroxyl groups to the adsorbed SO2 and then to the epoxy groups, so that the epoxy groups are preactivated to enhance their oxidative capacity. For the oxidation of NO, the addition of graphene oxide can reduce the reaction barrier, which is bene cial to the oxidation reaction(Cen et al.2015 ).\nConclusion This study synthesized a stable V-Cu-Ce-ZSM-5@GO0.5 catalyst by an impregnation method with good catalytic activity for SO2 and NO in the ue gas. Under experimental conditions, when the catalytic reaction temperature was 150\u00b0C, the oxidation e ciency of SO2 and NO were 94.60% and 83.64%, respectively, which signi cantly reduced the reaction temperature of the traditional ue gas desulfurization and denitration system. The BET characterization results showed that the loading of V,\nPage 9/17\nCu, and Ce components expanded the speci c surface area and the pore volume of the carrier, and the addition of GO further promoted the loading of active components on ZSM-5. The SEM and EDS characterization results showed that V, Cu, and Ce were uniformly loaded on the surface of the ZSM-5 carrier, and the addition of GO further increased the loading and dispersion of elements. The results of XRD and XPS analyses showed that element V was present in the catalyst in the form of V2O5, and Cu and Ce were present in the form of CuO and CeO2, respectively. This study provides a new idea for the low-temperature removal of SO2 and NO from ue gas.\nDeclarations Ethics approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of data and materials\nNot applicable.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant No. B2019502067) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2020MS152).\nAuthor contributions\nLemeng Wang: Project administration, Writing - original draft.
