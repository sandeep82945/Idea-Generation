 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the potential of using the "milking" method to continuously extract other valuable compounds like astaxanthin from microalgae. This could improve productivity and reduce processing costs. 

2. Engineer microalgae strains with higher lipid and omega-3 fatty acid content through metabolic engineering. This could increase the production potential for biofuels and nutraceuticals.

3. Test different macroalgae species as bioremediators to remove excess nutrients from eutrophic coastal waters. This could provide environmental benefits and biomass feedstock. 

4. Optimize cultivation conditions like temperature, light and nutrients to maximize growth rates and bioactive compound production in micro and macroalgae. This could improve the economics.

5. Develop more efficient, eco-friendly extraction methods like ultrasound, microwaves and supercritical CO2 to recover lipids, carotenoids and other metabolites from algal biomass. This could reduce processing costs and energy use.
