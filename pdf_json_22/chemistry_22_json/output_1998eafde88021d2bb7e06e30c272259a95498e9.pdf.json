The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. The leaves of E. stipitata provided an oil yield of 0.13\u00b10.01% (w/w). The volatile compounds in the essential oil of E. stipitata were analyzed using gas chromatography, and the volatile chemical composition was mainly composed of \u03b2eudesmol (15.28%), \u03b3-eudesmol (10.85%), elemol (10.21%), and caryophyllene oxide (6.65%). The essential oil of E. stipitata was highly selective against Leishmania braziliensis and L. infantum promastigotes. The essential oil exhibited good antibacterial activity. E. stipitata essential oil showed low free-radical scavenging activity. Our results suggest that the E. stipitata essential oil is a relevant source of the primary compounds required for the development of antibacterial and antiprotozoal drugs.\nKeywords: essential oil; Brazilian plant; Myrtaceae; Eugenia; antioxidant; antibacterial;\nantiprotozoal"

ESEO was collected using a Pauster pipette and transferred to a beaker and the water remaining after the extractions was removed by adding anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4). ESEO was then transferred to an amber glass vial using a pipette, weighed and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark environment until use. The hydrodistillation was performed in triplicates. It was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (CG-MS) (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010) with the Rtx\u00ae-5MS capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm). Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV (in electron ionization mode) with a scanning speed of 1.0 scan/s from 35-350 m/z, and helium (99.999%) was employed as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). The temperature was set at 100 \u00b0C (3 min), followed by 310 \u00b0C (3.5 \u00b0C/min).\nThe volatile components were identified by comparing the retention indices\nobtained by co-injection of samples with C9\u2013C30 linear hydrocarbons. The MS data acquired for each volatile component were matched with the data available in the mass spectral library of the gas chromatography system (NIST08 Mass Spectral Library; MassFinder 4; Wiley Registry\u2122 of Mass Spectral Data 9th Edition) and other published mass spectral data (Adams 2007).\nFor quantitative analysis, a Shimadzu GC2010 Plus gas chromatograph equipped\nwith an FID detector and the same column and operating conditions as those described\nabove was used. The percentage volatile composition was determined using the normalization method from the GC peak areas in relation to the combined area of all peaks. All analyses were performed in triplicate."
