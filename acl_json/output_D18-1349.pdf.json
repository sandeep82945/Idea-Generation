    "abstractText": "Prevalent models based on artificial neural network (ANN) for sentence classification often classify sentences in isolation without considering the context in which sentences appear. This hampers the traditional sentence classification approaches to the problem of sequential sentence classification, where structured prediction is needed for better overall classification performance. In this work, we present a hierarchical sequential labeling network to make use of the contextual information within surrounding sentences to help classify the current sentence. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art results by 2%-3% on two benchmarking datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical scientific abstracts.",

            "text": "Since 1665, over 50 million scholarly research articles have been published (Jinha, 2010), with approximately 2.5 million new scientific papers coming out each year (Ware and Mabe, 2015). While this enormous corpus provides us with the ability to conclusively accept or reject hypotheses and yields insight into promising research directions, it is getting harder and harder to extract useful information from the literature in an efficient and timely manner due to its sheer amount. Therefore, an automatic and intelligent tool to help users locate the information of interest quickly and comprehensively is highly desired.\nWhen searching for relevant literature for a certain field, investigators first check the abstracts of scientific papers to see whether they match the criterion of interest. This process can be expedited if the abstracts are structured; that is, if the rhetorical structural elements of scientific abstracts such as purpose, methods, results, and conclusions (American National Standards Institute,\n1979) are explicitly stated. However, even today, a significant portion of scientific abstracts is still unstructured, which causes great difficulty in information retrieval. In this paper, we develop a machine-learning based approach to automatically categorize sentences in scientific abstracts into rhetorical sections so that the desired information can be efficiently retrieved.\nIn a scientific abstract, each sentence can be assigned to a rhetorical structural element sequentially. This rhetorical structure profiling process can be formulated as a sequential sentence classification task, as the element assignment of any single sentence is greatly associated with the assignments of the surrounding sentences. This is in contrast to the general sentence classification problem, where each sentence is classified individually and no contextual information can be used. Previous state-of-the-art methods relied on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to take into account the inter-dependence between subsequent labels, which improved joint sentence classification performance by considering the label sequence information. In this work, we add a bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) layer over the representations of individual sentences so that it can encode the contextual content and semantics from preceding and succeeding sentences for better categorical inference of the current one.\nIn this work, we present a hierarchical neural network model for the sequential sentence classification task, which we call a hierarchical sequential labeling network (HSLN). Our model first uses a RNN or CNN layer to individually encode the sentence representation from the sequence of word embeddings, then uses another bi-LSTM layer to take as input the individual sentence representation and output the contextualized sentence representation, subsequently uses a single-hidden-layer feed-forward network to transform the sentence\nrepresentation to the probability vector, and finally optimizes the predicted label sequence jointly via a CRF layer. We evaluate our model on two benchmarking datasets, PubMed RCT (Dernoncourt and Lee, 2017) and NICTA-PIBOSO (Kim et al., 2011), which were both generated from the PubMed database1. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:\n1. Based on the previous best performing architecture for sequential sentence classification (Dernoncourt et al., 2016), we add one more layer to extract contextual information from surrounding sentences for more accurate prediction of the current one. Together with the CRF algorithm, this allows us to make use of not only the preceding labels\u2019 information but also the content and semantics of adjacent sentences to infer the label of the target sentence.\n2. We remove the need for a character-based word embedding component without sacrificing performance. For individual sentence encoding, we propose the use of a CNN module as an alternative to RNN for small datasets, suffering less from over-fitting as evidenced by our experiments. Moreover, we incorporate attention-based pooling in both RNN and CNN models to further improve the performance.\n3. We adopt dropout with expectation-linear regularization instead of the standard one to reduce the performance gap between training and test phases.\n4. We obtain state-of-the-art results on two datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts, outperforming the previous best models by at least 2% in terms of F1 scores."

They are mainly based on naive Bayes (Ruch et al., 2007), support vector machine (SVM) (McKnight and Srinivasan, 2003; Yamamoto and Takagi, 2005; Liu et al., 2013), Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Lin\n1https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/\net al., 2006), and CRF (Kim et al., 2011; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Hirohata et al., 2008; Chung, 2009). All these methods heavily rely on numerous carefully hand-engineered features such as lexical (bag-of-words (BOW)), semantic (hypernyms, synonyms), structural (part of speech (POS) tags, lemmas, orthographic shapes, headings), statistical (statistical distributions of token types) and sequential (sentence position, surrounding features, predicted labels) features.\nIn contrast, current emerging artificial neural network (ANN) based models have removed the need for manually selected features; instead, features are self-learned from the token and/or character embeddings. These deep learning models have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field with state-of-the-art results achieved in various tasks, including the most relevant text classification task (Kim, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Conneau et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2015). Most of these models are built upon deep CNNs or RNNs as well as combinations of them, where CNN is good at extracting local n-gram features while RNN is suitable for sequence modeling.\nThe above-mentioned works for short-text classification do not consider any context of sentence semantics in the models, making them underperform in the sequential sentence classification scenario, where surrounding sentences can play a big role in inferring the label of the current sentence. Recent works that apply deep neural networks to the sequential sentence classification problem include the system proposed by Lee et al. (Lee and Dernoncourt, 2016), where the preceding utterances were used to help classify the current utterance in a dialog into the corresponding dialogue act. Most recent work from Dernoncourt et al. (Dernoncourt et al., 2016) used a CRF layer to optimize the predicted label sequence, where the preceding labels have influence on determining the current label. This model outperformed the state-of-the-art results on two datasets PubMed RCT and NICTA-PIBOSO for sentence classification in medical abstracts."

For example, the category Results is always followed by Conclusion, and the category Methods is certainly after the Background. Making use of such patterns can boost the classification performance via the CRF algorithm (Lample et al., 2016). Given the sequence of probability vectors r1:n from the last context enriching layer for an abstract of n sentences, this layer outputs a sequence of labels y1:n, where yi represents the predicted label assigned to the ith sentence.\nIn the CRF algorithm, in order to model dependencies between subsequent labels, we incorporate a matrix T that contains the transition probabilities between two subsequent labels; we define T [i, j] as the probability that a token with label i is followed by a token with the label j. The score of a label sequence y1:n is defined as the sum of the probabilities of individual labels and the transition probabilities:\ns(y1:n) = n\u2211 i=1 ri(yi) + n\u2211 i=2 T [yi\u22121, yi].

The learning rate is initially set as 0.003 and decayed by 0.9 after each epoch. For regularization, dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is applied to each layer. For the version of dropout used in practice (e.g., the dropout function implemented in the TensorFlow and Pytorch libraries), the model ensemble generated by dropout in the training phase is approximated by a single model with scaled weights in the inference phase, resulting in a gap between training and inference. To reduce this gap, we adopted the dropout with expectation-linear regularization introduced by Ma et al. (2016) to explicitly control the inference gap and thus improve the generaliza-\n7http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip 8https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/\npretrained-vectors.md\ntion performance.

            "text": "Table 4 compares our model against the best performing models in the literature (Dernoncourt et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013). There are two variants of our model in terms of different implementations of the sentence encoding layer: the model that uses bi-RNN to encode the sentence is called HSLN-RNN; while the model that uses the CNN module is named HSLN-CNN. We have evaluated both model variants on all datasets. And as evidenced by Table 4, our best model can improve the F1 scores by 2%-3% in absolute number compared with the previous best published results for all\n9https://github.com/jind11/HSLN-Joint-SentenceClassification\ndatasets. For the PubMed 20k and 200k datasets, our HSLN-RNN model achieves better results; however, for the NICTA dataset, the HSLN-CNN model performs better. This makes sense because the CNN sentence encoder has fewer parameters to be optimized, thus the HSLN-CNN model is less likely to over-fit in a smaller dataset such as NICTA. With sufficient data, however, the increased capacity of the HSLN-RNN model offers performance benefits. To be noted, this performance gap between RNN and CNN sentence encoder gets larger as the dataset size increases from 20k to 200k for the PubMed dataset.\nModel PubMed\nNICTA 20k 200k\nBest Published Marco Lui (Lui, 2012)\n- - 82.0 bi-ANN (Dernoncourt et al., 2016) 90.0 91.6 82.7 Our Models HSLN-CNN 92.2 92.8 84.7 HSLN-RNN 92.6 93.9 84.3\nTable 4: Comparison of F1 scores (weighted average by support (the number of true instances for each label)) between our model and the best published methods. The presented results of our model are evaluated on the test set of the run with the highest F1 score on the validation set.\nTable 5 presents the ablation analysis of our model (on the PubMed 20k dataset), where we remove one component at a time and quantify the performance drop (reported on F1 scores). As can be seen from Table 5, our HSLN-CNN model uni-\nformly suffers a little more from the component removal than the HSLN-RNN model, indicating that the HSLN-RNN model is more robust. When the context enriching layer is removed, both models experience the most significant performance drop and can only be on par with the previous stateof-the-art results, strongly demonstrating that this proposed component is the key to the performance improvement of our model. Furthermore, even without the label sequence optimization layer, our model still significantly outperforms the best published methods that are empowered by this layer, indicating that the context enriching layer we propose can help optimize the label sequence by considering the context information from the surrounding sentences. Last but not the least, the dropout regularization and attention-based pooling components we add to our system can help further improve the model in a limited extent.\nTable 6 and 7 detail the results of classification for each label in terms of performance scores (precision, recall and F1) and confusion matrix, respectively (for our HSLN-RNN model trained on the PubMed 20k dataset). These show that the classifier is very good at predicting the labels Methods, Results and Conclusions, whereas the greatest difficulty the classifier has is in distinguishing Background sections from Objectives sections. One fifth of Background sentences are incorrectly classified as Objectives, while around one forth of Objectives sentences are wrongly assigned to the label of Background. We conjecture this difficulty mainly comes from the fact that the difference between Background and Ob-\njectives sentences in terms of writing style is less obvious compared with the other sections of the abstract. Moreover, our model has some difficulty in telling Methods sentences apart from Results sentences.\nTable 8 presents a few examples of prediction errors that are produced by our HSLN-RNN model trained on the PubMed 20k dataset. This error analysis suggests that one of the biggest model error sources could be from the debatable gold standard labels of the dataset. For example, the sentence \u201cDepressive disorders are one of the leading components of the global burden of disease with a prevalence of up to 14% in the general population.\u201d is indeed introducing the background of the problem (depressive disorders) on which this article is going to focus; however, the gold label classifies it into the Objective category. For another instance, the sentence \u201cA post hoc analysis was conducted with the use of data from the evaluation study of congestive heart failure and pulmonary artery catheterization effectiveness (escape).\u201d belongs to the Result label according to the gold standard, but it makes more sense that it should be classified as a Method label.\nFigure 2 presents an example of the transition matrix after the HSLN-RNN model has been trained on the PubMed 20k dataset, which encodes the transition probability between two subsequent labels. It effectively reflects what label is the most likely one that follows the current one. For example, by comparing the transition scores in the Result row in Figure 2, we can conclude that a sentence pertaining to the Result is typically followed by a sentence pertaining to the Conclusion and is unlikely to be followed by a sentence in the Background category (transition scores of 2.48 vs -5.46), which makes sense. From this transition matrix, we can figure out the most probable label sequence: Background \u2192 Objective \u2192 Method \u2192 Result \u2192 Conclusion, which is also consistent with our expectations.\nIn order to test the importance of pretrained word embeddings, we performed experiments with different sets of publicly published word embeddings, as well as our locally curated word embeddings, to initialize our model. Table 9 gives the performance of six different word embeddings for our HSLN-RNN model trained on the PubMed 20k dataset. According to Table 9, the training methods that create the word embeddings do not have a strong influence on model performance, but the corpus they are trained on does. The combination of Wikipedia and PubMed abstracts as the corpus for unsupervised word embedding training yields the best result, and the individual use of either the Wikipedia corpus or the PubMed abstracts performs much worse. Although the dataset we\nare using for evaluation is also from PubMed abstracts, using only the PubMed abstracts together with MIMIC notes without the Wikipedia corpus does not guarantee better result (see the \u201cFastTextP.M.+MIMIC\u201d embeddings in Table 9), which may be because the corpus size of PubMed abstracts plus MIMIC notes (about 12.8 million abstracts and 1 million notes) is not large enough for good embedding training compared with the corpus consisting of at least billion tokens such as the Wikipedia."
