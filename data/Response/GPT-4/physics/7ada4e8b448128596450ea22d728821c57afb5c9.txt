Exploring Alternative Natural Polysaccharides for Synthesis: Investigate the use of other natural polysaccharides besides cashew gum as mediating or stabilizing agents in the green synthesis of metal-doped ZnO nanoparticles. The comparative analysis would expand the understanding of how different natural substances affect the properties and photocatalytic performance of nanoparticles.

Impact of Other Transition Metal Dopants: Systematic research on the effects of doping ZnO nanoparticles with other transition metals (such as Copper (Cu), Cobalt (Co), Manganese (Mn), etc.) in similar concentrations to the Ni doping studied here. This could reveal how various dopants influence the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanoparticles, potentially uncovering new photocatalysts with superior performance.

Advanced Photocatalytic Applications: Expand the application scope of the synthesized Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles beyond methylene blue degradation. This could include the degradation of other pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides, in water. Additionally, their effectiveness in gas phase applications, like CO2 reduction and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) removal, could be a valuable research direction.

Mechanism and Kinetics of Photocatalysis: A detailed study on the mechanism of photocatalysis using Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles, focusing on the kinetics of the photocatalytic reactions, identifying the main reactive species, and elucidating the pathways of pollutant degradation. This would deepen understanding of how the photocatalytic process operates at a molecular level, helping to optimize conditions for maximum efficiency.

Synthesis Optimization and Scale-up: Research focusing on optimizing the synthesis parameters (such as temperature, pH, concentration of cashew gum, and time) to enhance the quality and properties of the Ni-doped ZnO nanoparticles. Moreover, studies on the scalability of the green synthesis process could pave the way for industrial applications, making the eco-friendly production of photocatalysts more feasible for widespread environmental cleanup efforts.
