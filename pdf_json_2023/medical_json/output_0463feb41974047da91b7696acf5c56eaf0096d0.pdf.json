Survival analysis was performed and the correlation between lncRNAs, m6A regulators, and mRNAs was analyzed; followed by functional enrichment analysis.\nResults A comparison of LUAD samples and normal tissues identified numerous differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, demonstrating that a comprehensive network was established. Two lncRNAs and six mRNAs were selected as prognosis related factors including SH3PXD2A-AS1, MAD2L1, CCNA2, and CDC25C. The pathological stage and recurrence status were identified as independent clinical factors (P < 0.05). The expression levels of these RNAs in the different clinical groups were consistent with those in the different risk groups. The interactions of m6A proteins, two lncRNAs, and six mRNAs were predicted, and functional analysis showed that m6A target mRNAs were involved in the cell cycle, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and oocyte meiosis pathways.\nConclusions These m6A target lncRNAs and mRNAs may be promising biomarkers for predicting clinical prognosis, and the lncRNA-m6A regulator-mRNA regulatory network could improve our understanding of m6A modification in LUAD progression.\nKeywords Lung adenocarcinoma, N6-Methyladenosine, lncRNA, Prognosis markers"

            "text": "Lung cancer represents a global life-threatening malignancy. The high incidence and poor survival of patients with lung cancer leads to heavy economic and healthcare burdens. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is mainly derived from mucous and glandular epithelial proliferation around the bronchi and has been identified as the predominant subtype in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in recent years [1, 2]. Modern computed tomography screening is a reliable tool for early stage detection of LUAD, however, most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage owing to the lack of available biomarkers. Once patients have progressed to the invasive stage, the 5-year survival rate has an average of only 15% [3, 4]. Therefore, actively investigating the molecular mechanisms of LUAD and identifying potential targets are of great significance for its diagnosis and therapy.\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are mRNA-like transcripts that are more than 200 nucleotides long. LncRNAs can be transcribed by RNA polymerase II, 5\u2032 capped, polyadenylated, and spliced but they cannot code for proteins owing to the lack conserved open reading frames [5]. LncRNAs typically exert diverse biological functions by interacting with regulatory proteins and are often implicated as chromatin regulators, miRNA sponges, scaffolds of RNA protein complexes, and decoys for DNA-binding factors [6, 7]. The deregulation of lncRNAs is involved in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of various cancer types. Many lncRNAs have been identified as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in specific cancers, including the oncogenic factors HOTAIR, PVT1, and LINC00152 [8, 9].\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant epigenetic modification of target RNAs, including mRNA, miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNA [10]. The process of m6A methylation in eukaryotic cells is dynamic and reversible and is mainly controlled by three types of enzymes; methyltransferases (\u201cwriters\u201d), demethylases (\u201cerasers\u201d), and binding proteins (\u201creaders\u201d) [11]. Most studies have focused on the m6A modification of mRNA, and only a few reports have illustrated the function of m6A modification in lncRNAs. m6A modification affects the RNADNA complex structure and regulates lncRNA-specific DNA binding; m6A modified lncRNA can also provide binding sites for readers and induce RNA-binding protein entry [12, 13]. Recent studies have explored the potential significance of m6A modifications and lncRNA deregulation in cancer. For instance, upregulation of the reader IGF2BP3 and lncRNA DMDRMR was associated with poor prognosis in renal carcinoma, and their interaction stabilized CDK4 expression, promoted G1-S transition and cancer cell proliferation [14]. Furthermore, LINC00460 directly interacted with DHX9 and \u201creader\u201d IGF2BP2 to promote HMGA1 mRNA stability, leading to\ncolorectal cancer cell proliferation and metastasis [15]. In lung cancer, LCAT3 serves as a novel m6A-regulated lncRNA that promotes cancer progression by binding to FUBP1, thereby activating c-MYC transcription [16]. However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between m6A, lncRNAs, and mRNAs remain unclear.\nThis study aimed to identify reliable prognostic biomarkers by constructing regulatory networks. RNAseq expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), combined with the m6A target gene database and co-expression analysis, were used to elucidate the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in LUAD. The optimal lncRNAs and mRNAs correlated with prognosis were identified using the Cox regression model. The expression patterns of candidate factors were evaluated in different clinical groups and the correlation between m6A factors, lncRNAs, and target mRNAs was analyzed. Our results provide an effective prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for patients with LUAD."

In this study, the m6A2Target database was used to predict the correlation between lncRNAs, mRNAs, and m6A\nregulators. By comparison with the DERs we retained the intersection part of genes to construct the lncRNAs-m6A factor-mRNA regulatory network using Cytoscape version 3.6.1 [20]. The correlation between the expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs was analyzed using the cor function in R to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC); P < 0.05 and an absolute PCC value greater than 0.5 were set as thresholds. RNA pairs that met these criteria were selected as co-expressed pairs for further analysis. For the candidate mRNAs, DAVID version 6.8 was utilized to conduct gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, approved by Kanehisa laboratories, Kyoto, Japan) pathway enrichment analyses [21]. The terms and pathway categories with FDR values less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched and retained.\nIdentification of crucial RNAs correlated with survival outcomes Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine prognosis-related RNAs using the survival package version 2.41-1 [22].

Using the defined screening criteria, we identified 1,020 DERs between tumor and normal samples using the limma method, including 148 lncRNAs and 872 mRNAs (Fig.\u00a0 2A). Hierarchical clustering showed the top10 upregulated DERs (CST1, SYT12, HTR3A, MNX1-AS1, TMPRSS11E, ABCA12, KCNMB2-AS1, BBOX1-AS1, CLDN10-AS1, and FOXD3-AS1) and\ntop10 downregulated DERs (LINC00968, CA4, FENDRR, ANKRD1, LINC00551, GPD1, FABP4, NAV2-AS2, ACADL, and ADAMTS8) and indicated that these DERs could successfully distinguish the tumor samples from normal samples (Fig.\u00a02B).\nConstruction of lncRNA-m6A gene-mRNA network To explore the relationship between m6A regulators and their corresponding molecules, we used the m6A2Target database to predict the potential binding between lncRNAs and mRNAs. We screened 235 RNA pairs, including 75 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and 12 m6A regulators (Fig.\u00a0 3A). Similarly, candidate mRNAs linked to m6A regulators were predicted using the m6A2Target database analysis. A total of 1,055 RNA pairs associated with 206 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) and 12 m6A regulators were identified by comparison with screened DEMs. The connectivity network is shown in Fig.\u00a03B.\nInteractions between DELs and DEMs were analyzed by calculating the PCC values of their expression levels. A total of 513 RNA pairs that were significantly correlated based on their expression statuses were obtained (Fig.\u00a03C). Finally, we integrated these molecules and constructed a comprehensive regulatory network to reveal the co-relationships between lncRNA-m6A regulatormRNAs (Fig.\u00a03D).\nFunctional enrichment analysis revealed that these m6A target mRNAs were associated with 27 biological processes (Fig.\u00a04), including cell division, cell cycle regulation, mitotic nuclear division, cell proliferation, DNA replication, DNA repair, and sister chromatid cohesion. In addition, six KEGG pathways were identified: miRNAs in cancer, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and Fanconi anemia pathway.\nIdentification of the crucial survival-related RNAs in LUAD and prognostic correlation analysis Based on the nodes in the constructed comprehensive regulatory network and the clinical prognostic information of patients in TCGA, univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen 79 RNAs, including nine lncRNAs and 70 mRNAs, that were significantly associated with prognosis. The 79 RNAs were then used for to multivariate Cox regression analysis, and eight RNAs closely related to independent prognosis in LUAD were identified, including two lncRNAs and six mRNAs.\nWe then divided the LUAD samples into high- and low-expression groups, according to the median value of each regulator. Survival curves of the eight identified RNAs showed that high-expression of SH3PXD2A-AS1, PLK1, CENPA, MAD2L1, CCNA2, and CDC25C was associated with a worse overall survival time (P < 0.05;\nFig.\u00a05), indicating that they were oncogenic factors. Highexpression of SYNPR-AS1 and CLEC3B was associated with a better prognosis (P < 0.05; Fig.\u00a05), suggesting that they may act as tumor suppressors.\nExpression patterns of RNAs in the different clinical groups To evaluate the expression status of m6A target RNAs in the different clinical samples, we performed Cox regression analysis to identify independent clinical factors. Univariate analysis showed that the TNM pathological stage, pathological stage, and tumor recurrence were significantly correlated with prognosis (P < 0.05; Table\u00a0 1). However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only pathological stage and tumor recurrence were predicted as independent clinical factors that significantly correlated with LUAD prognosis (P < 0.01; Table\u00a0 1). To validate the accuracy of the two clinical factors, the LUAD samples were classified into different groups according\nto their disease factor status. KM analysis showed that patients in the early stage (I\u2013II) and without recurrence groups had better overall survival than those in the advanced stage (III\u2013IV) and with recurrence groups, indicating a high accuracy for prognosis prediction (P < 0.001; Fig.\u00a06).\nSubsequently, the expression patterns of the eight RNAs were analyzed in the different pathological stage and recurrence status groups. Using the t-test method, it was found that SH3PXD2A-AS1, PLK1, CENPA, MAD2L1, CCNA2, and CDC25C were all upregulated in patients in the advanced stage and recurrence groups compared to those in the early stage and without recurrence groups, whereas SYNPR-AS1 and CLEC3B displayed the opposite trend (P < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 7A and B). Collectively, the expression status of m6A target RNAs in the different clinical groups was consistent with that\nfound in the different risk groups, indicating the reliable prognostic value of these molecules.\nRelationship of m6A factors, lncRNAs, and target mRNAs We established a Sankey diagram (Fig.\u00a0 7C) to determine the correlation between the six m6A enzymes and eight signatures. In the regulatory network, the lncRNA SH3PXD2A-AS1 interacted with three m6A factors, IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3, and YTHDC1, to regulate the target mRNAs expression; whereas SYNPR-AS1 was modulated by three other m6A factors, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3.\nIn addition, functional analysis showed that these m6A target mRNAs were significantly enriched in 13 biological processes, including cell division, mitotic sister chromatid segregation, sister chromatid cohesion, mitotic nuclear division, viral processes, and the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint; as well as three KEGG pathways, cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation (Table\u00a02). Verification of the expression of the eight RNAs closely related to independent prognosis in the different datasets In the training dataset (TCGA), the expression levels of SH3PXD2A-AS1, SYNPR-AS1, CCNA2, CDC25C, CENPA, MAD2L1, and PLK1 were significantly higher in the LUAD compared to the normal samples (P < 0.05). However, the expression of CLEC3B was downregulated in LUAD compared to the normal samples (P < 0.05; Fig.\u00a0 8A). The expression trends of SH3PXD2A-AS1, SYNPR-AS1, CCNA2, CDC25C, CENPA, MAD2L1,\nPLK1, and CLEC3B in the validation dataset (GSE75037) were consistent with those in the training dataset (Fig.\u00a08B). These results indicated the relatively high reliability of the bioinformatics analysis."

The expression of the candidate RNAs in the advanced and recurrent groups was consistent with that in the high-risk group, suggesting the effective prognostic value of these factors. The interactions between m6A regulators and eight hub RNAs were visualized using a Sankey diagram. The m6A related mRNAs were enriched in many processes and pathway terms such as mitotic sister chromatid segregation, mitotic nuclear division, cell cycle, and oocyte meiosis. A previous study has reported that upregulation of SH3PXD2A-AS1 in colon cancer contributed to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [23]; it served as an endogenous sponge of miR-330-5p to modulate UBA expression. Mechanistically, SH3PXD2A-AS1 interacted directly with p53 and regulated p53-mediated downstream gene transcription [24], however, the role of SH3PXD2A-AS1 in LUAD remained unclear. Based on the regulatory network and survival analysis, we found that the upregulation of SH3PXD2A-AS1 could affect the prognosis of LUAD by interacting with three\nm6A factors: IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3, and YTHDC1. In this study, we focused on the potential role of IGF2BP1 in the regulation of lncRNAs. IGF2BP1 and IMP-1 have been identified as conserved m6A readers that preferentially regulate m6A modified target mRNAs and enhance the stability of oncogenic factor mRNAs, leading to tumor development [25]. IGF2BP1 promotes G1/S phase transition by stabilizing E2F transcripts; a checkpoint of the cell cycle in solid cancers [26]. It controls candidate target mRNAs, AURKA, HDLBP and YWHAZ, mostly in a 3\u2032 UTR-, m6A- and miRNA-dependent manner and thus\nenhances mRNA decay [27, 28]. A novel IMP1 inhibitor, BTYNB, disturbed the interaction between IGF2BP1 and RNAs; indicating a drug strategy for IGF2BP1-driven cancer [26, 29]. In line with previous studies, our results demonstrated the vital role of IGF2BP1 in cell cycle pathway regulation, and several candidate target mRNAs were predicted including CCNA2 and CDC25C. CCNA2 encodes the cyclin A2 protein which activates CDK1 and CDK2 to regulate the cell cycle transition [30]. Cytoplasmic localization of cyclin A2 in the S/G2 transition border triggers the activation of the mitotic kinase PLK1 [31]. CDC25C regulates G2/M progression and mediates DNA damage repair, and upregulation of CDC25C in various malignant tumors suggests that it could serve as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction [32]. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a broad, complex mechanism of action for IGF2BP1, SH3PXD2A-AS1, and their target mRNAs in promoting the cancer cell cycle.\nSYNPR-AS1 acts as a novel lncRNA and its biological role in cancer has rarely been reported. The present study found that SYNPR-AS1 transcripts were upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer samples from TCGA [33]. However, our results showed that SYNPR-AS1 expression was downregulated in the advanced and recurrent disease groups. This difference may be associated with the diverse genetic backgrounds and varying pathological stages of the patients. The network interaction of SYNPR-AS1 with three m6A readers, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, was predicted. YTHDF1\u20133 are a class of m6A reader proteins with a conserved YTH domain. Structural analysis revealed that the m6A base fits into the YTH domain pocket via several base-specific hydrogen bonds and governs m6A-specific recognition [34]. YTHDF1 interacts with m6A marked transcripts to increase translation efficiency and protein production [35]. The relationship between lncRNAs and YTHDFs has been reported previously. YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 can read the m6A motifs and maintain the oncogenic role of the lncRNA THOR in an m6A-dependent manner [36]. YTHDF3 regulates YAP signaling by facilitating m6A-modified lncRNA GAS5 degradation and mediates cancer progression [37]. In addition, upregulation of YTHDF1 is frequently found in KRAS/TP53-mut LUAD patients and is associated with adverse prognosis; it functionally promotes cyclin B1 mRNA translation, thereby facilitating cancer cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle pathway [38]. In this study, correlation analysis further showed that SYNPR-AS1 interacts with YTHDF1\u20133 to regulate the expression level of downstream mRNAs. Uncontrolled cell cycle signaling leads to excessive proliferation of cancer cells. The m6A target mRNAs were mainly enriched in three signaling pathways, providing promising directions for elucidating the potential"

External validation of other LUAD datasets and more clinical samples would be beneficial to evaluate the prognostic value. Although the six m6A target mRNAs identified in this study are widely reported to be involved in cancer progression, the biological roles of the two lncRNAs have not been elucidated and their involvement in LUAD is unknown. Future experiments should be conducted to investigate the functions of lncRNAs and their association with m6A-related regulators and mRNAs."
