    "abstractText": "Real-time status monitoring is an important prerequisite for coral reef ecological protection. Existing equipment does not provide an ocean observation platform with adequate mobility and efficiency. This paper describes the design considerations of a proposed autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) dedicated for ecological observation of coral reefs, including the system architecture, electronic devices, sensors and actuators, and explains the path control algorithm and controller to follow a specific path for ocean exploration. The structure and dynamic model of the AUH are first introduced, and then the corresponding simplification is made for motion analysis. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is carried out to evaluate the dynamic performance of the AUH. Fuzzy-PID control algorithm is utilized to achieve a good antidisturbance effect. In order to validate the performance of the proposed underwater vehicle, a field test was performed, and results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed prototype.",

Introduction\nCoral reefs, known as \u201cunderwater rainforests\u201d, are the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and provide considerable economic, ecological and social benefits for human beings. With the increasing intensity of social and marine economic activities in coastal areas, coral reefs are facing the threat of severe damage [1]. Real-time observation is an important prerequisite for the rescue and protection of coral reefs; it helps to understand the status of coral reef systems, identify relative impact factors and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures, so as to put forward suggestions for further improvement on protection strategies. Traditional coral observations are either carried out by divers carrying cameras and samplers at the coral reef site or by fixed observation platforms with scientific sensors [2,3], which have significant limitations in terms of observation scale and efficiency. With the development of ocean technology, underwater vehicles equipped with professional observation equipment are coming into application in the ocean observation field [4\u201311]. However, existing underwater vehicles do not provide an ideal platform for large-scale and long-term observation of coral reefs. More specifically, (i) while an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mainly works in the upper water column, the observation of coral reefs requires the underwater vehicle to be able to reach the seafloor and hover at a fixed point; (ii) operation in the complex water flow near the seabed puts forward higher requirements for the maneuverability of the underwater vehicle. In view of the problems mentioned above, a seafloor-resident mobile observation platform, Coral-AUH, is designed and developed in this paper. As a disk-shaped underwater vehicle, the AUH has experienced several generations of iteration and come into\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051770 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770 2 of 15\napplication in various fields [12\u201318]. Coral-AUH inherits the super maneuverability and seafloor-resident capability; meanwhile, it carries a camera and multiple sensors to detect environmental data such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll in real time, which helps scientists to determine the health status of corals more accurately. The advent of Coral-AUH will provide a large-scale and long-term observation platform for coral reef ecological observation. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: The general configuration of Coral-AUH is discussed first, and then a kinematic model and motion analysis are presented. After that, computational fluid analysis evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of Coral-AUH is presented. The control system is then described, and the results of a pool test validating the feasibility of the control algorithm are presented. Finally, the results of a field test verifying the observation capability and reliability of Coral-AUH are presented.\n2. Configuration of Coral-AUH 2.1. System Architecture\nInspired by the bottom-dwelling stingray (Figure 1), we designed the disk-shaped autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH), a new member of the AUV family, which is suitable for seafloor-resident observation and operation. Over the decades, a series of AUH prototypes have been developed for various scenarios, and in this paper, Coral-AUH is designed and implemented as the underwater mobile platform for coral observations.

System architecture of Coral-AUH.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the main body of Coral-AUH adopts a frame structure, which is convenient for the installation and fixation of the load devices, more specifically, the scientific sensors. The outer casing is an arc-shaped dome cover, which helps to improve the hydrodynamic performance, and an opening channel for each propeller is arranged on the casing to allow for the water to flow through. The propeller group contains a total of six propellers, including four horizontal propellers, which are symmetrically installed around the mounting bracket to provide torsion force rotating around the vertical central axis and thrust force for horizontal movement.

Considering the requirement for mobility, as well as the special limitations, the layout of propellers was designed as shown in Figure 4. The six propellers are decoupled from each other, and all of them can independently control the trajectory of the AUH by changing the rotational speed. Before establishing the kinematic model, it is necessary to define the coordinate system. As shown in Figure 5, there are two coordinate frames: one is the ground coordinate frame (E-X_E Y_E Z_E), also known as the static coordinate frame, which is used as the inertial reference system, and the other is the body coordinate frame (O-xyz).

However, in practical application scenarios, motion in all DOFs is not often required. As for Coral-AUH, the three degrees of freedom of forward, steering and lifting are sufficient to meet the needs of coral observations. Based on the kinematic model above, the motion analysis of Coral-AUH is carried out in these three DOFs.\nThe free body diagram of the six propellers is shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Free body diagram.\nThe expression corresponding to the free body diagram produced by the propellers can thus be obtained:\nFigure 6. ree bo y iagra .\nThe expression corresponding to the free body diagram produced by the propellers can thus be obtained:\n\u03c4 = \nX Y Z K M N\n =  sin \u03b11(T1 + T2 \u2212 T3 \u2212 T4) cos \u03b11(T1 \u2212 T2 \u2212 T3 + T4) T5 + T6 L5 (\u2212T5 + T6)\n0 L1 (\u2212T1 + T2 \u2212 T3 + T4)\n (4)\nConsidering the practical application, this paper only considers three DOFs. The force generated by the propeller can be calculated by Ti = K f \u2126i2, where K f is the propeller coefficient and \u2126i is the angular velocity of the i-th propeller. Equation (4) can be simplified as\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770 6 of 15\n\u03c4 =  XZ N  =  sin \u03b11(T1 + T2 \u2212 T3 \u2212 T4)T5 + T6\nL1 (\u2212T1 + T2 \u2212 T3 + T4)\n =  K f sin \u03b11 ( \u212612 + \u212622 \u2212\u212632 \u2212\u212642 ) K f ( \u212652 + \u212662\n) K f L1 ( \u212622 + \u212642 \u2212\u212612 \u2212\u212632\n)  (5)\nIn this paper, the Newton\u2013Euler equation [20] is used to establish the dynamic model. On the horizontal plane, the AUH kinetic model can be expressed as\nJ .\n\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2217 (J\u03c9) + Cgyro + M f + K\u03b6 + MC = \u03c4 (6)\nwhere J is the total inertial of the vehicle, \u03c9 \u2217 (J\u03c9) is the centripetal force and Cgyro is the gyroscopic effect moment generated by the propeller due to the rotation of the propeller. M f is water resistance or moment, which can be calculated by M f = 12 \u03c1C f A f V\n2, where \u03c1 is the fluid density, C f is the water resistance coefficient, A f is the wet surface area of the AUH and V is the flow rate. K\u03b6 is the force and moment produced by the gravity and the buoyancy. MC is the force and moment generated by the optical cable to the AUH, which can be written as MC = Mp + M f = 12 \u03c1Cc ACVf\n2, where Cc is the resistance coefficient, AC is the wet area of the cable and V f is the water velocity. \u03c4 is the force and moment generated by the propeller. Since the gyroscopic effect has little influence on underwater objects, it is not considered in this paper, and the resistance of the optical cable to the AUH is ignored. Combined with the snorkeling motion in the vertical direction, the equation of motion under three degrees of freedom can finally be simplified as\nm .. \u03be = K f sin \u03b11 cos \u03c8 ( \u212612 + \u212622 \u2212\u212632 \u2212\u212642 ) \u2212 1\n2 \u03c1C f H AH\n. \u03be 2 cos \u03c8 (7)\nm .. \u03b6 = \u2212K f ( \u212652 + \u212662 ) \u2212 1\n2 \u03c1C f V AV\n. \u03b6 2 + K\u03b6 (8)\nJZ .. \u03c8 = K f L1 ( \u212622 + \u212642 \u2212\u212612 \u2212\u212632 ) \u2212 CRR . \u03c8 (9)\nwhere C f H and C f V are the drag coefficients in the horizontal and vertical directions obtained according to the hydrodynamic analysis, which will be introduced in detail in Section 2.3. AH and AV respectively represent the wet area in the horizontal and vertical directions of the AUH. CR is the general water resistance coefficient when the AUH rotates. R is the turning radius of the designed AUH. The input control variable of the Coral-AUH is the angular velocity of the i-th propeller. This section clarifies the dynamic law and its quantitative expression for Coral-AUH, which prepares for the subsequent parameter setting of the control system.\n2.3. CFD Simulation\nIn motion analysis, the water resistance is an important variable affecting the kinematic performance of Coral-AUH, which requires accurate calculation. However, due to the complex underwater environment, the water resistance of Coral-AUH when working underwater is not linear and can hardly be obtained directly. CFD software proves to be an effective tool to evaluate the resistance of underwater vehicles, and the simulation results can be used to optimize the external dimension parameters of the Coral-AUH afterward. The diversion shell of the AUH is mainly utilized to protect the internal equipment of the helicopter from the water flow in the marine environment and the impact damage of various debris; meanwhile, its hydrodynamic profile helps to reduce the fluid resistance in the operation process so as to reduce the power consumption. In this paper, ANSYS-FLUENT is utilized as the CFD simulation tool. To ensure calculation accuracy and save computing resources, the RNG k-\u03b5 model is used to establish an outer drainage basin of 4 m \u00d7 4 m \u00d7 10 m. The velocity inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are established, and the rest are set as no-slip walls. Considering the complexity of the model, unstructured grid is adopted globally. The boundary layer is\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770 7 of 15\nrefined near the wall of the inner watershed, and the minimum grid size is 2 mm. The RNG model is one of the widely used two-equation turbulence models; it solves two transport equations and simulates Reynolds stress by the eddy viscosity method.\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202xi (\u03c1ui) = 0 (10)\n\u2202 \u2202t (\u03c1ui) + \u2202\n\u2202xj\n( \u03c1uiuj ) =\n\u2202p \u2202xi + \u2202 \u2202xj\n[ \u00b5 ( \u2202ui \u2202xj + \u2202uj \u2202xi \u2212 2 3 \u03b4ij \u2202ul \u2202xl )] + \u2202 \u2202xj ( \u2212\u03c1u\u2032i u \u2032 j ) (11)\nThe RNG k-\u03b5 model [21] is based on model transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy (k) and its dissipation rate (\u03b5), which are obtained from the following transport equations:\n\u2202 \u2202t (\u03c1k) + \u2202 \u2202xi (\u03c1kui) = \u2202 \u2202xj\n( \u03b1k\u00b5e f f\n\u2202k \u2202xj\n) + Gk + Gb \u2212 \u03c1\u03b5\u2212YM + Sk (12)\n\u2202 \u2202t (\u03c1\u03b5) + \u2202 \u2202xi (\u03c1\u03b5ui) = \u2202 \u2202xj\n( \u03b1\u03b5\u00b5e f f \u2202\u03b5\n\u2202xj\n) + C1\u03b5 \u03b5\nk (Gk + C3\u03b5Gb)\u2212 C2\u03b5\u03c1\n\u03b52 k \u2212 R\u03b5 + S\u03b5 (13)\nIn these equations, Gk represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients and Gb is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to buoyancy. YM represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate. C1\u03b5, C2\u03b5 and C3\u03b5 are constants and \u03c3k and \u03c3\u03b5 are the turbulent Prandtl numbers for k and \u03b5, respectively. The quantities \u03b1k and \u03b1\u03b5 are the inverse effective Prandtl numbers for k and \u03b5, respectively. Sk and S\u03b5 are user-defined source terms. The numerical solver uses the pressure-based Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE), which iteratively decouples the calculation of velocity and pressure. The condition for iterative calculation to stop in each case is that the residuals of each parameter are less than 10\u22123. Two typical translation and rotation velocities were simulated, and the resistance obtain could be input into the motion control analysis. The resistance diagrams and the velocity contour of the Coral-AUH are shown in Figure 7. Comparing the resistance of the Coral-AUH in all directions under the conditions of the incoming flow speeds of 1 and 1.5 m/s, the resistance Fx is about 25 N at 1 m/s and about 55 N at 1.5 m/s. The resistance Fy basically fluctuates up and down around 0 N, and the Coral-AUH receives roughly the same resistance in the x-axis and z-axis, which may cause rising during the horizontal advance. It can be fine-tuned by the vertical propellers. From the velocity contour, at the speeds of 1 and 1.5 m/s, the surrounding fluid flow is similar and the streamline is good. The flow velocity of the upper fluid and the opposite flow is relatively large and then gradually decreases to both sides of the hull, and the flow velocity of the fluid behind the helicopter is relatively small. In addition to translational movement, steering is also a frequent motion in underwater operations. Therefore, the torque of the Coral-AUH when it rotates at different angular speeds perpendicular to z-axis was analyzed. The torque variations and velocity contours when angular speed is at 90 and 180\u25e6/s are shown in Figure 8. By comparison, it can be found that the torque is about 0.006 N m at 90\u25e6/s and 0.02 N m at 180\u25e6/s. It is much smaller than the resistance encountered when moving horizontally. It can better meet the requirements of flexible steering and maneuverability of underwater helicopters during movement. Meanwhile, the resistance in the horizontal direction of the underwater helicopter is small and the action is flexible, while the resistance in the vertical direction is large, which can also ensure the stability of its navigation process.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770 8 of 15Sensors 02 , 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16\nFigure 7.

The inertial measurement unit (IMU) measures the three-axis attitude angle and acceleration rate of the Coral-AUH. The depth sensor measures the depth of the AUH. Having received data from the positioning system, the motion control panel then calculates the actual position of the Coral-AUH and compares it with the target position and sends commands to the attitude adjustment system and propulsion system accordingly.\n3.2. Motion Control The motion of the AUH requires the collaborative work of six brushless DC (BLDC) motors. An STM32 generates PWM at a certain frequency and duty cycle, which is utilized as drive signals for the propeller group. The control command comes from the data collected from sensors and remote control signals. The IMU module is composed of an ITG3205 triaxial gyroscope, an ADXL345 triaxial accelerometer and an HMX5883L triaxial magnetic field sensor. PID closed-loop control is utilized to ensure that the CoralAUH successfully completes the desired motion. In the practical application process of the AUH, three modes are mainly involved: forward and backward, up and down, and steering. The operating modes of the propellers will be introduced below (Figure 10).\nFigure 9.

The average swimming speed in a straight path was 1.54 m/s (\u00b10.06 m/s), equivalent to 1.5 body lengths per second. The average angular spin rate was 3.14 rad/s (\u00b10.6 rad/s) with a zero turning radius. The average dive speed in the horizontal attitude was 0.72 m/s (\u00b10.07 m/s), equivalent to 0.7 body lengths per second. A sample AUH trajectory is shown in Figure 11, illustrating the ultra-agile swimming motion following preset commands. The AUH can change attitude, direction and depth while exploring the coral reefs, with an average swimming speed of 1.28 m/s (\u00b10.26 m/s) at depths of 0 to 200 m. In order to verify the feasibility of the control algorithm, an experiment to test mobility was carried out in a swimming pool. A preset route was designed and input into the control system of the AUH, and the route was quite challenging as it had sharp turning and attitude adjustment. In the preset task, the AUH is supposed to follow the route through attitude adjustment and vectoring propulsion. As shown in Figure 13, the trajectory started at point O; AUH was designed to dive to Point A and then cruise to point B. After that, AUH turned 90\u00b0 clockwise and cruised to point C. At point C, AUH came up to point D, and then it cruised to point E. At point E, AUH turned 90\u00b0 clockwise and finally returned to point O. The whole route mainly involves variations in yaw. A comparison was made between the preset route and the actual route, and the result is shown in Figure 13. Yaw angle was also recorded in real time and compared with the preset value, as shown in Figure 14. The actual route and heading angle agree well with preset values, validating the fuzzy control algorithm.\nFigure 13.

It can be seen from the test results that the Coral-AUH successfully cruised to the coral reef site and hovered there to take photographs; meanwhile, it could detect environmental data such as pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll in real time. The test results show that the system can improve the accuracy and timeliness of coral monitoring and can meet the long-term stereoscopic observation requirements for coral reefs in a complex seabed ecological environment.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper contributes to the field of undersea robots that can serve as an observatory platform for coral reefs. First, we present the design considerations of a stingray-shaped underwater vehicle that can complete scientific surveys continuously within certain sea areas. Motion analysis and CFD simulation show Coral-AUH has low rotation resistance and superior maneuverability. A fuzzy algorithm is integrated into the traditional PID\nSensors 2022, 22, 1770 14 of 15\nalgorithm to form a fuzzy PID controller, which usually achieves a good antidisturbance effect. Simulation and experimental results show that AUH follows the preset route well and demonstrates excellent maneuverability. Finally, the function and reliability of CoralAUH were tested in the waters of Luhuitou and Yazhou Bay at the depths of 10 and 30 m, respectively, and the duration of each test lasted for around 2 h. The results show that Coral-AUH can quickly, accurately and efficiently conduct coral observation tasks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.H. and Y.C.
