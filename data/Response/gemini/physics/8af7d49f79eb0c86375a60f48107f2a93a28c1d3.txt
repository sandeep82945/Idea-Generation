1. **Investigate the effect of different types of fly ash on CO2 adsorption:** The study only used fly ash from a single coal power plant. It would be interesting to see how fly ash from different sources, with different compositions and properties, would affect the CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics of the amine-infused hydrogels.


2. **Explore the use of different amine solvents:** The study only used monoethanolamine (MEA) as the amine solvent. Other amines, such as diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA), or piperazine, could potentially offer different advantages in terms of CO2 adsorption capacity, selectivity, and regeneration energy requirements.


3. **Study the effect of different hydrogel compositions and structures:** The study used a hydrogel composed of acrylic acid and acrylamide. Other monomers, such as methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, or vinylpyrrolidone, could be used to modify the properties of the hydrogel and potentially improve its CO2 adsorption performance. Additionally, the crosslinking density and porosity of the hydrogel could be varied to optimize the CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics.


4. **Investigate the long-term stability and recyclability of the amine-infused hydrogels:** The study did not evaluate the long-term stability or recyclability of the amine-infused hydrogels. It would be important to determine how the CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics of the hydrogels change over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and to identify any potential degradation mechanisms.


5. **Explore the potential applications of the amine-infused hydrogels in other gas separation processes:** The amine-infused hydrogels could potentially be used for the separation of other gases, such as CO2 from CH4 or H2S from natural gas. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the hydrogels in these applications and to optimize their properties for specific gas separation tasks.
