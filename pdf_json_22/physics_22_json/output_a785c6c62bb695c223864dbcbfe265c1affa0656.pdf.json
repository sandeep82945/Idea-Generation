    "abstractText": "It is known that relativistic wavefunctions formally propagate beyond the light cone when the propagator is limited to the positive energy sector. By construction, this is the case for solutions of the Salpeter (or relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger) equation or for Klein\u2013Gordon and Dirac wavefunctions defined in the Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen representation. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the degree of non-causality for free propagation for different types of wavepackets that all initially have a compact spatial support. In the studied examples, we find that non-causality appears as a small transient effect that can in most cases be neglected. We display several numerical results and discuss the fundamental and practical consequences of our findings concerning this peculiar dynamical feature.",

            "text": "In classical relativistic physics, causality is associated with the light-cone structure of Minkowski space-time: no event can be affected by an event lying outside its past light-cone. In relativistic quantum mechanics, the situation is more involved. It is indeed well-known that a relativistic evolution driven by a positive energy Hamiltonian instantaneously turns an initial state having compact spatial support into a distribution having mathematically a non-zero amplitude everywhere in space [1\u20133]. Relativistic propagators restricted to the positive energy sector spill outside the light cone [4]: it is only by including the contribution of the anti-particle sector that a causal propagator is obtained. While this observation points to the necessity of having antiparticles in a relativistic quantum theory in order to preserve causality [5], there are instances in which no negative energies appear. For instance, in the Salpeter equation [6] (also known as the relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation), by construction the propagator is restricted to positive energies. This also appears when the solutions of the Klein\u2013Gordon or Dirac equations are unitarily transformed in the Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen (FW) representation. Given the importance of the FW solutions\u2014they are necessary to obtain the classical limit, and it is sometimes claimed that densities constructed from the FW wavefunctions are the only ones having a physical meaning [7]\u2014it is instructive to investigate to which extent there is an effective propagation outside the light cone. Indeed, the instantaneous spreading of an initially localized wavefunction is a mathematical fact, but it is often regarded as being physically irrelevant on the ground that beyond the light-cone, propagation is extremely small and not detectable in practice for any realistic physical state [8,9]. In this work, we will numerically investigate the fraction of the wavefunction that effectively propagates outside the light-cone for different initial states characterized by different parameters (width, mean momentum, and shape). The common feature to the initial states we will employ is the requirement that they have a compact spatial support.\nDynamics 2023, 3, 60\u201370. https://doi.org/10.3390/dynamics3010005 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/dynamics\nUp to now, most works that have investigated this type of propagation, essentially in the context of the Salpeter equation, have used states that have tails at t = 0, such as initial Bessel functions [10] (one of the few cases for which analytical solutions can be obtained) or Gaussian wavepackets [8,11\u201313]. If the states have initial compact support, we can meaningfully and numerically follow the fraction that remains inside the light cone as time evolves. We will see that although the fraction spilling outside the light cone is small and does so during very short times, it could have observational consequences for elementary particles. To this end, we will first (in Section 2) set the context by recalling in which situations one is led to deal only with the propagator of the positive energy sector. We will briefly recall in Section 3 the arguments proving the propagator is non-causal. We will give our results in Section 4, describing the method employed and our choice of initial states. We close the paper with a short discussion and conclusive comments (Section 5)."

We have used the Hamiltonian form [14] of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, for which \u03a6 has two components. We will be interested throughout this work in free propagation along a single spatial direction; therefore, effectively restricting the Hamiltonian to a spatial 1D problem: in this case, the Dirac spinor \u03a6 has only two nontrivial components, and this is why HD as given by Equation (3) is two dimensional rather than four. As is well-known [14], both HKG and HD admit positive and negative energy solutions denoted \u03a6\u00b1p (t, x), with the + and \u2212 signs corresponding to positive and negative energy solutions. For instance, for the Klein\u2013Gordon equation we have [15]\n\u03a6\u00b1p (t, x) = 1 2 \u221a mc2Ep ( mc2 \u00b1 Ep mc2 \u2213 Ep ) eipx/h\u0304e\u2213iEpt/h\u0304, (4)\nwhere Ep = \u221a m2c4 + p2c2 (5)\nand the prefactor is a normalization constant. The propagator K(t, t\u2032; x, x\u2032), evolving an initial state \u03a6(t\u2032, x\u2032) into \u03a6(t, x), when expanded over the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions will contain contributions from both the positive and negative states \u03a6\u00b1p (t, x). It is well-known [4] that while the propagator is causal, \u2013 K(t, t\u2032; x, x\u2032) vanishes for spacelike separated points, for which x\u2212 x\u2032 > c(t\u2212 t\u2032) \u2013 ; the restrictions K\u00b1(t, t\u2032; x, x\u2032) to an expansion over the sole positive or negative energy eigenstates are not causal, in the sense that K\u00b1(t, t\u2032; x, x\u2032) does not vanish for space-like separated events. This is why it is often remarked that negative energies are necessary in order to preserve relativistic causality [5]."

            "text": "The solutions \u03a6\u00b1p (t, x) of the KG or Dirac equation in the canonical representation (2) and (3) are well-known to give rise to apparently curious properties (for example, the eigenvalues of the velocity are always zero in the KG case and c in the Dirac case [14]; or, the classical limit cannot be obtained as h\u0304 \u2192 0 [7]). This is due to the fact that particle and anti-particle contributions interfere even in the free case. The Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen transformation [19,20] is a unitary transformation in momentum space that separates particles from anti-particles. For example, in the KG case the (pseudo-unitary) operator\nU =\n( mc2 + Ep ) \u2212 \u03c31 ( mc2 \u2212 Ep )\u221a 4mc2Ep\n(11)\napplied to the eigenstates \u03a6\u00b1p given by Equation (4) lead to\n\u03a8+(t, p) = U\u03a6+ = (\n1 0\n) e\u2212i(Ept\u2212px)/h\u0304 (12)\n\u03a8\u2212(t, p) = U\u03a6\u2212 = (\n0 1\n) ei(Ept\u2212px)/h\u0304 (13)\nand the transformed Hamiltonian is HFW = UHU\u22121 = \u03c33 \u221a p2c2 + m2c4. (14)\nSimilar relations for the Dirac solutions may be found in textbooks [14,15]. The solutions \u03a8\u00b1 are indeed uncoupled: an initial particle state \u03a8(0, x) = (\u03c8(0, x), 0) has only an expansion over the \u03a8+(t, p) basis states, and thus only the upper component is non-zero. Note that the HFW Hamiltonian is block diagonal, with each block consisting of a Salpeter equation. We therefore see that if a density is defined from the wavefunctions \u03a8(t, x) in the FW representation, then the density of a positive energy state will be simply given by |\u03c8(t, x)|2, which is precisely the density computed from the Salpeter equation. We stress, however, that such a step involves defining a new density that is different from the standard KG or Dirac densities (a unitary transformation does not change the density nor the current). This new density is free from the issues caused by the fact that the standard KG or Dirac densities mix particles and anti-particles. For this reason, this density displays several advantages and has been favored in some works [7,8,17,21], though it suffers from one important drawback: it is formally non-causal."

Indeed, by definition the propagator should obey\n\u03c8(t, x) = \u222b dx\u2032KS(t, t\u2032; x, x\u2032)\u03c8(0, x\u2032). (15)\nStarting from Equation (10) and using the inverse transform of Equation (9), we immediately obtain\nKS(t\u2212 t\u2032; x\u2212 x\u2032) = 1 2\u03c0h\u0304\n\u222b dpeip(x\u2212x \u2032)/h\u0304e\u2212iEp(t\u2212t \u2032)/h\u0304. (16)\nDifferent methods (see, e.g., [11,22]) lead to the closed-form expression\nKS(t\u2212 t\u2032; x\u2212 x\u2032) = im(t\u2212 t \u2032) \u03c0h\u0304 ( (x\u2212 x\u2032)2 \u2212 c2(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 )1/2 K1[mc((x\u2212 x\u2032)2 \u2212 c2(t\u2212 t\u2032)2)1/2/h\u0304] (17) where K1 is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. From the asymptotic behavior K1(X) \u223c exp(\u2212X)/ \u221a X for large X, it immediately follows that the propagator spills beyond\nthe light cone. Recall that KS, sometimes known as the Newton-Wigner propagator [23], is not Lorentz-invariant but does propagate the wavefunction, Equation (15), whereas a Lorentzinvariant propagator does not [5]. Note that the negative energy propagator displays the same behavior as KS, with the value for space-like arguments being of opposite sign. Another line of reasoning relies on Paley-Wiener arguments. It can be proved (see, e.g., [1\u20133]) that for any semi-bounded Hamiltonian, a wavefunction initially localized on a compact support immediately spreads everywhere as soon as the evolution starts (or, conversely, any wavefunction that remains bounded on a compact support must be zero everywhere). Instructive illustrations of this theorem for simple wave equations were given in Ref. [24]."

            "text": "The Salpeter equation, although it is attractive as it results from quantizing the classical relativistic Hamiltonian, is usually regarded as an approximate model for a spinless particle, correctly described by the Klein\u2013Gordon equation. Note, however, that for a neutral particle, the solutions of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation are real and can be combined to obtain a complex wavefunction obeying the Salpeter equation [25,26]. The situation is more involved from the point of view of the FW representation. The interpretational difficulties of the standard KG or Dirac densities are related to the problems of defining a position operator. The position operator X\u0302 in the FW representation is equivalent to the Newton-Wigner position operator [23] in the standard representation. On this basis, it is often argued that the FW density is the physical one [27]. The problem is then knowing how to cope with the non-causal nature of the propagation. The answer that has been given is, in a nutshell, that non-causality is in practice undetectable. First, it has been argued that the probability of such a detection is so low that it would be unlikely to detect such an event even over billions of years [9]. Second, it is difficult to imagine how signals could be sent superluminally since modulations cannot be produced from the exponentially decaying tail [8]. It can also be remarked that since non-causality is non-negligible only on distances of the order of a Compton wavelength (\u03bbc = h\u0304/mc) away from the light cone, a detection on this scale is hardly feasible for elementary particles and totally impossible for larger (not to mention macroscopic) bodies, for which the Compton wavelength falls below the Planck length. The first step in assessing whether these observations are plausible is to quantitatively compute the fraction of the wavepacket that is propagated beyond the light cone."

Numerically, the actual computed value of the wave packet will not be exactly zero outside its compact support (including at t = 0), but a very small number that should be smaller than our numerical zero, see Figure 1 for the f (x) = cos8(x/\u2206x) case for which the numerical zero is set at 10\u221220. The calculations based on the method employed here have recently been compared [28\u201330] to direct solutions of the relativistic wave equations obtained by employing a high-precision finite-difference scheme, resulting in an excellent agreement.

On this scale, the tails propagating outside the light cone are not visible, so we have plotted on the right panel the same quantities on a logarithmic scale, clearly displaying beyond the light-cone propagation (the light cone position is \u00b1(\u03c0/2 + t) in these units). Figure 2 (left) shows a density plot for the same initial wavefunction, while the right panel shows the fraction of the density lying outside the light cone as time evolves. This fraction reaches a maximum a very short time after initial propagation and then decreases to zero for longer times. Figure 3 shows the fraction of the probability density outside the light cone for the same \u03c8 f (0, x) but with different initial widths \u2206x and initial momenta p0.\nf (x) = cos8(x/\u2206x) (with \u2206x = 1 and p0 = 0) for short values of t.

Note that we have taken a higher value for the numerical 0, given that the momentum range over which we need to integrate in Equation (21), for each value of t, is significantly more extended than with a cos8(x/\u2206x) function. Finally, Figure 6 compares the probability density propagating beyond the light cone for the three functions f (x) we have considered in this paper (with the same initial compact support and mean momentum).\n0 20 40 60 80 100 t\n10-10\n10-5\n100 cos2, p0 = 0\nx = 10 x = 2 x = 1 x = 0.1\nFigure 4.

Table 1 specifies the duration of significant superluminal propagation depending on f (x) (the compact support) and the width. We see that in the rectangular case for a narrow wavepacket, a fraction (0.01%) of the probability density remains outside the light cone for times up to t \u2248 104 in natural units (for an electron this corresponds to 1.3\u00d7 10\u221217 s.).

            "text": "As expected from mathematical arguments, our calculations confirm that the wavefunction propagates beyond the light cone as soon as t > 0. Typical wavepackets will have a spatial distribution \u2206x much larger than the Compton wavelength \u03bbC. In this case, the propagation beyond the light cone appears as a small transient effect, though not totally negligible at short times (see the \u2206x = 10 curve in Figure 5). Note that short times, of the order of t \u2248 1 in the units used here, would lie for an electron in the zeptosecond regime, a regime that is near experimental reach [31]. Of course for heavier particles, the time scale scales inversely to the mass, so that for macroscopic bodies t \u2248 1 would be shorter than the Planck time. Even at considerably longer times, there is still a non-negligible probability outside the light cone (see Table 1)). For narrower wavepackets, the fraction of the probability distribution beyond the light cone can reach a non-negligible percentage (see the \u2206x = 0.1 curve in Figures 3\u20135). While it is generally believed that the single particle formalism breaks down for wavepackets narrower than \u03bbC (but see [32\u201334]), the propagating wavepacket would still contribute to the one-particle sector of the corresponding quantum-field theoretical description [8,17]. This does not necessarily entail that the superluminal propagation could actually be detected, but, to the extent that the spatial density defined above is the correct physical one, our results indicate this possibility must be kept open. Another interesting effect is the role of the initial average momentum. From Figure 3, one can see that the fraction of the probability density leaking beyond the light-cone decreases as p0 increases. Somewhat paradoxically, wavepackets in the ultrarelativistic regime (p0 \u223c 10) remain almost entirely within the light cone, while wavepackets with initial zero momentum (whose average position does not move) are those that display the highest proportion of superluminal propagation (see Figure 6). It would be interesting to\nunderstand the reasons for this behavior. The role of the shape of the wavepacket, which determines the range of the contributing momenta in Equation (21), is also interesting. From our choices for f (x), we can say that beyond the light cone, spreading increases as the momentum range increases. Here too, there is no obvious argument to explain this behavior. In summary, motivated by the issue of the physicality of the Foldy\u2013Wouthuysen (FW) density, we have numerically explored the time evolution of free relativistic wavefunctions propagated by the sole positive energy propagator. We have done so by choosing three different initial wavefunctions with compact support and varying parameters. We conclude from our findings that beyond the light cone, propagation is a very small effect that is non-negligible for particles having a small mass (of the order of elementary particles) over a short time after preparation of the initial state. It is, however, impossible to assert that this effect cannot lead to any observational consequences if the FW density is taken as being the physically meaningful quantity.\nAuthor Contributions: A.M. conceived the idea, X.G.d.l.C. wrote the codes and made the calculations, both authors prepared the draft, wrote and reviewed the manuscript.
