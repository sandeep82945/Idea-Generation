    "abstractText": "Bioinformatics tools are used to create a clinical prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis and to investigate the neurovascular-related genes that are involved in brain metastasis of cervical cancer. One hundred eighteen patients with cervical cancer were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of metastases, and the clinical data and imaging findings of the two groups were compared retrospectively. The nomogram-based model was successfully constructed by taking into account four clinical characteristics (age, stage, N, and T) as well as one imaging characteristic (original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance Rad-score). In patients with cervical cancer, headaches and vomiting were more often reported in the brain metastasis group than in the other metastasis groups. According to the TCGA data, mRNA differential gene expression analysis of patients with cervical cancer revealed an increase in the expression of neurovascular-related gene Adrenoceptor Beta 1 (ADRB1) in the brain metastasis group. An analysis of the correlation between imaging features and ADRB1 expression revealed that ADRB1 expression was significantly higher in the low Rad-score group compared with the high Rad-score group (P = 0.025). Therefore, ADRB1 expression in cervical cancer was correlated with imaging features and was associated as a risk factor for cerebral neurovascular metastases. This study developed a nomogram prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis using age, stage, N, T and original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance. As a risk factor associated with the development of cerebral neurovascular metastases of cervical cancer, ADRB1 expression was significantly higher in brain metastases from cervical cancer.",

One hundred eighteen patients with cervical cancer\nwere divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of metastases,\nand the clinical data and imaging findings of the two groups were compared\nretrospectively. The nomogram-based model was successfully constructed by taking\ninto account four clinical characteristics (age, stage, N, and T) as well as one imaging\ncharacteristic (original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance Rad-score). In patients with cervical\ncancer, headaches and vomiting were more often reported in the brain metastasis\ngroup than in the other metastasis groups. According to the TCGA data, mRNA\ndifferential gene expression analysis of patients with cervical cancer revealed an increase\nin the expression of neurovascular-related gene Adrenoceptor Beta 1 (ADRB1) in the\nbrain metastasis group. An analysis of the correlation between imaging features and\nADRB1 expression revealed that ADRB1 expression was significantly higher in the low\nRad-score group compared with the high Rad-score group (P = 0.025). Therefore,\nADRB1 expression in cervical cancer was correlated with imaging features and was\nassociated as a risk factor for cerebral neurovascular metastases. This study developed\na nomogram prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis using age, stage, N, T\nand original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance. As a risk factor associated with the development\nof cerebral neurovascular metastases of cervical cancer, ADRB1 expression was\nsignificantly higher in brain metastases from cervical cancer.\nKeywords: cervical cancer, brain metastasis, neurovascular, clinical prediction model, radiomics, ADRB1, biomarkers\nINTRODUCTION\nThe fourth most prevalent cancer among women worldwide is cervical cancer, a common gynecologic malignancy (1). Approximately 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer were reported in 2018, representing 3.15% of all malignant tumor cases. Furthermore, approximately 310,000 cervical cancer-related deaths were reported in 2018, representing 3.26% of all malignant tumor\ndeaths (1, 2). Cancer metastasis is a major cause of poor prognosis in cervical cancer (3\u20136). The five-year survival rate for cervical cancer patients with metastasis is only 30\u201360%, which is significantly lower than that for those without metastasis (7, 8). Cervical cancer metastasis involves complex molecular mechanisms (9). The lack of effective measures to prevent or treat cervical cancer metastasis is attributable to the fact that the mechanism of cervical cancer metastasis remains unclear.\nCervical cancer metastasis occurs mainly via the lymphatic route (10). The most common sites of distant metastases are the lungs, bones, and liver, in order of priority (11). It is rare for cervical cancer to spread to the central nervous system, and very little research has been conducted on this subject (12, 13). When diagnosed with brain metastases, cervical cancer patients typically have a poor prognosis; the median survival period from the time of diagnosis until death is 2\u20133 months (13). As of now, there is no reliable way to predict early whether cervical cancer will spread to the neurovascular system.\nKnown as an emerging method of image analysis, radiomics can extract quantitative features from medical images that describe biological information, such as tumor characteristics and heterogeneity, which can serve to guide clinical planning (14). In patients with esophageal cancer, radiomics also proved to be effective for predicting T and N stages as well as lymph node metastasis (15\u201317). Based on the results of the radiomics study, the model can improve the diagnostic accuracy of differentiating benign and malignant cartilage tumors, as well as benign and low-grade malignant chondrosarcomas (18). An analysis conducted by Zhao et al. of diffusionweighted images of osteosarcoma was retrospectively screened for four clinical features and eight imaging features, and a combined feature model was constructed for both characteristics, displaying good performance (19). Thus, it is possible to assess a tumor and predict its progression by combining imaging and clinical data. Moreover, imaging analysis is useful in determining the malignant and benign classification and staging of ovarian tumors, monitoring treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors earlier in the course of treatment, and providing high-precision survival assessment for patients with ovarian tumors (20, 21). Consequently, radiomics is an important tool for predicting tumorigenesis, metastasis, and prognosis.\nRadiomics has made significant progress in recent years when it comes to detecting and localizing brain metastases, making a differential diagnosis with other primary brain tumors, and determining the prognosis of the patient. An algorithm based on multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for example, is capable of automatically detecting and segmenting brain metastases with great precision (22). The best results of glioblastoma multiforme and metastasis differentiation can be obtained by applying an Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on enhanced T1-weighted images (T1W1) radiomics (23). Furthermore, the enhanced T1W1 imaging feature \u2013 \u201czone percentage\u201d is an independent prognostic factor for local tumor control in non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases (24). Researchers from Shen et al.\nperformed a retrospective study using computed tomography (CT) images of patients with bones metastases from lung adenocarcinoma who had genetically confirmed epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status. Three features were associated with EGFR mutation status (25). Yu et al. demonstrated that high-throughput MRI imaging features extracted from conventional T2 fluid attenuation inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) images were highly correlated with isocitrate dehydrogenase genotype 1 (IDH1) (26). Furthermore, the conventional sequence-based fusion imaging model constructed by Jiang et al. accurately predicted the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in low-grade gliomas (27). Hence, imaging features have a potential superior predictive efficacy in predicting tumor genotypes (28).\nSeveral studies have reported that neurovascular factors are involved in the development and metastasis of several malignancies (29, 30). The adrenergic receptor gene, a neurovascular-related factor, encodes the adrenergic receptor.\n\u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers have the ability to reduce the risk of head and neck cancer, as well as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and prostate cancer (31, 32). Catecholamines promote ADRB2-dependent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and neurotrophic factor secretion, which is critical to tumor development (33). The induction of angiogenesis by brain endothelial cells was shown to be crucial for the early survival of brain metastatic cells (34). Further, patients with lung cancer with a positive VEGFC expression were significantly more likely to develop brain metastases than those with a negative VEGFC expression (35). Accordingly, neurovascularrelated genes are involved in brain metastasis in cervical cancer, and it may be possible to predict neurovascularrelated genes that are associated with brain metastasis by imaging features.\nIn recent years, bioinformatics has gained significant attention in several fields for its role in exploring disease mechanisms (36\u201341). The objective of this study was to identify early risk factors and potential targets from an imaging and genomics perspective for patients with brain metastases from cervical cancer in order to improve prognoses. By combining radiomics data and clinical information, a prediction model reflecting the risk of cervical cancer metastasis was constructed in this study that screened neurovascular genes with brain metastases related to cervical cancer."

Five genes (CHGB, CACNA1B,ADRB1, PLCG1 and TSPO) were found to be statistically significant between the two groups (Figure 6A). After ranking the differential genes by significance and investigating the function of each gene, ADRB1 was identified as a gene that could be involved in nerves and blood vessels. ADRB1 expression was significantly different in brain metastasis compared to non-brain metastasis groups (Figure 6B). In the tumor brain metastasis group, ADRB1 expression was significantly higher than at other metastasis-site group (p = 0.003). In order to further identify the role of ADRB1 in cervical cancer brain metastasis, the GSEA analysis of RNA transcription data from patients with cervical cancer revealed that the T cell receptor complex pathway was upregulated, while the iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway was downregulated (Figure 6C).

The difference in ADRB1 expression between the high- and low-Rad-score groups is statistically significant (Figure 7B). Expression of ADRB1 was higher in the low-Rad-score group than the high-Rad-score group (p = 0.025). In light of this, the radiomics feature original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance in the model is likely to be able to predict ADRB1 expression and, thereby, brain metastasis in cervical cancer. Hence, ADRB1 expression is associated with radiomics features and is considered a risk factor for cerebral neurovascular metastasis of cervical cancer."

            "text": "The clinical and radiomic features of 118 patients with cervical cancer (with or without tumor metastasis) were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses screened four clinical features (age, stage, N and T) and one radiomics feature (original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance) associated with cervical cancer metastasis. These features were used to construct clinical prediction models. ADRB1 was found to be related to radiomic features and was considered as a risk factor associated with the risk of cerebral neurovascular metastasis in cervical cancer.\nRadiomics is an emerging field that involves the transformation of various types of images into high-dimensional image feature data, providing a more comprehensive description of tumor tissue heterogeneity (49, 50). In a study, the prediction of cervical cancer metastasis was modeled using multiparametric MRI imaging and seven clinical and pathological characteristics, demonstrating that multisequence MRI features serve as noninvasive biomarkers for the preoperative assessment of cervical\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 905761\ncancer lymph node status. Furthermore, these characteristics can have an impact on treatment decisions for patients with cervical cancer at an early stage (51). Wu et al. constructed a radiomics model and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of 189 patients, which was able to predict the development of lymph node metastases in cervical cancer with an AUC of 0.847 (52). Similarly to previous MR-based studies of cervical cancer, this study also observed a better predictability of cervical cancer metastasis using radiomics (53). Based on the original_glszm_GrayLevelVariance feature of enhanced CT images in conjunction with clinical features, the current study developed a clinical prediction model for cervical cancer metastasis. It was demonstrated that the prediction model had good predictive efficacy, a high clinical usefulness and a wide safety range, which successfully differentiated between women with cervical cancer who had metastasized and those who did not. Recent studies have shown that radiomics can be used to investigate the association between histological features and gene mutations by mining high-throughput radiomics features from conventional CT images (54). Similarly, radiomics can also predict genes associated with cervical cancer metastasis. ADRB1, a \u03b21 adrenergic receptor, is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, serving as adrenergic receptors in myocardiocytes (55). The \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway has also been found to be closely associated with tumor proliferation, apoptosis and microenvironment regulation (56\u201359). According to previous studies, ADRB family genes play a crucial role in regulating the interaction between the sympathetic drive and the immune system (60). According to previous studies, ADRB family genes play a crucial role in regulating the interaction between the sympathetic drive and\nFrontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 905761\nthe immune system. ADRB1 is involved in the regulation of tumor development in the lungs, breast and prostate (61\u201363). Furthermore, ADRB1 genes may act synergistically with FOXA1 and ADRB2 genes to drive tumor formation and development (62). It is also closely associated withmetastasis and recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (64). Similarly, this study identified ADRB1 as a potential oncogene involved in the neurovascular metastasis of cervical cancer. Consistent with previous studies, GSEA revealed that the T cell receptor complex pathway was upregulated, whereas the iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway was downregulated in the ADRB1 group, indicating the role of ADRB1 in immune regulation and altered mitochondrial respiratory function in response to hypoxia. Wang et al. observed that the high expression of ADRB1 could mediate and maintain a normal immune response by promoting the activity of B cells and dendritic cells (61). Immune infiltration contributes significantly to tumor progression (65). Thus, ADRB1 serves as an immunomodulator in the process of cerebral neurovascular metastasis in cervical cancer.\nLymph node status in early-stage cervical cancer was found to be associated with the age of the patient (66). Ki et al. report the mean age of diagnosis in patients with cervical cancer metastasis as 55 years (67). Advanced age is a remarkable factor affecting the prognosis of patients with stage IV cervical cancer, with patients \u226570 years of age having the worst prognosis (68). Similar to previous studies, the age of patients with cervical cancer in the non-metastatic group was found to be significantly lower than those with metastasis. Moreover, age turned out to be an independent risk factor for cervical cancer metastasis. Additionally, patients with cervical cancer who had tumor diameters >4 cm were significantly more likely to develop metastasis than those who had tumor diameters <4 cm (69). The incidence of cervical cancer metastasis increases with the progression of the tumor stage (70). Similarly, pelvic lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer could lead to a higher rate of distant metastasis (71).\nNeurovascular factors are thought to contribute to headache and vomiting. The incidence of headache and vomiting was higher in patients with cervical cancer in the brain metastasis group when compared to those with other sites of metastasis. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that the expression of neurovascular-related gene ADRB1 was elevated in the tumor brain metastasis group. However, the current study has certain limitations: (1) The clinical aspect of this study was retrospective, with possible selection bias and a small sample size. Therefore, further multi-center studies should expand the sample size; (2) The risk factors for brain metastasis in cervical cancer screened in this study were based on bioinformatic analyses, which require further clinical validation; (3) RNA transcription data were downloaded from the TCGA database for two patients with brain metastases and 15 patients with extracerebral metastases from cervical cancer, which may be subject to selection bias due to the limited sample size; (4) Additionally, further experiments to validate the function of ADRB1 in cervical cancer brain metastasis are required."
