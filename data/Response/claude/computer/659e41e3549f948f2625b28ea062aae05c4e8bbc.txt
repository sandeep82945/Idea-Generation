 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Extend the framework to more complex 3D objects beyond basic shapes like cars and airplanes. Test how well models can ground viewpoint descriptions for more intricate 3D shapes.

2. Explore different parameterizations of the viewpoint space beyond the Goldberg polyhedron, such as spherical harmonics. Compare how different viewpoint space representations affect model performance. 

3. Evaluate the approach on more diverse and complex textual descriptions of viewpoints, not just the 6 canonical views. See if models can learn to ground free-form natural viewpoint descriptions.

4. Apply the framework to model-based reinforcement learning settings where an agent must navigate a 3D environment based on textual instructions. Assess whether better viewpoint grounding improves navigation.

5. Combine the approach with neural 3D representations like voxel grids or point clouds instead of just RGB images. Examine if explicit 3D shape knowledge helps represent and retrieve viewpoints.
