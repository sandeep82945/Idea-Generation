Based on calculated binding energies, the Sn20H20 cage can best accommodate noble gases with a medium size radius (Ar and Kr), while the Pb20H20 dodecahedrane cage is best suited for noble gases with the larger radii (Xe and Rn). On the other hand, from the elements of the V main group of the periodic table, the Bi20 cage has shown the best results to selectively encapsulate Ar and Kr, with the amounts of energy being released being \u22125.24 kcal/mol and\u22126.13 kcal/mol, respectively. By monitoring the geometric changes of all here-reported host cages upon encapsulating the noble gas guest, the host has shown minor to no flexibility, testifying to the high rigidity of the dodecahedrane structure which was further reflected in very high encapsulating energies.",

The icosahedral dodecahedrane with its Ih symmetry, C20H20 (see Scheme 1) was synthesized, and its IR and Raman active frequencies were reported in 1982 [2,3], later on followed by X-ray structural analysis [4]. Structural and stability investigations for a series of dodecahedrane molecules followed [5\u20139], which suggested that the interior diameter of dodecahedranes (of about ~5 \u00c5) can be exploited for accommodating smaller-size guest species. Special attention was given to the potential applications of icosahedral dodecahedranes as host molecules for encapsulating noble gas molecules, i.e., to act as a preferential absorbent of a hydrophobic guests with applications in purification [10], separation [11], storage [12], catalysis [13,14], and intact transportation [15] of a target solute. Prinzbach et al. [16] have successfully \u201cshot\u201d a helium atom into C20H20 by using an experimental procedure developed for fullerenes [17].

Computational Details All computational calculations were performed using the \u03c9B97XD [20] theory level.

We selected dispersion corrected DFT to overcome the well-documented shortcomings of MP2 based methods. For obvious reasons the systems were too big for reliable Coupled Cluster calculations.

            "text": "The investigation of favorable selective complexation properties can be defined by two criteria, viz. comparison of the geometric changes of the host upon encapsulation the guest and an appropriated reaction energy, 23c [26,38,39]. For the purpose of monitoring the energy change of an encapsulation process, constructing a model reaction (1) as follows is a most suitable approach, where Ng represents a noble gas and the host is a selected dodecahedrane:\nNg + Host\u2192 [Ng \u2282 Host] (1)\nThe results of the computed complexation energies for dodecahedranes of a general formula X20H20 are reported in Table 1, whereas for dodecahedrane X20 in Table 2, they are presented with regard to the noble gas radii [40].\na Ecom: \u03c9B97XD/def2-tzvp//\u03c9B97XD/def2-svp/svpfit + ZPE(\u03c9B97XD/def2-svp/svpfit).\na Ecom: \u03c9B97XD/def2-tzvp//\u03c9B97XD/def2-svp/svpfit + ZPE(\u03c9B97XD/def2-svp/svpfit).\nAs can be seen in Table 1, carbon-based dodecahedranes exhibit very large (unreasonable) amounts of encapsulation energy ranging from 36.94\u2013709.69 kcal/mol. Going down the IV main group along the periodic table, the silicon dodecahedrane cage has a significantly lower encapsulation energy for noble gases, which are linearly increasing with the increasing size of the noble gases radii (Figure 1). The germanium-based dodecahedrane cage has encapsulation energy for He and Ne of ~0 kcal/mol, with a further linear increase in the encapsulation energy going from Ar to Rn (from 7.64 kcal/mol to 39.28 kcal/mol, respectively). The tin cage releases energy upon hosting all noble gases, with the largest amount of energy released for hosting Ar and Kr (\u22125.63 kcal/mol and \u22126.41 kcal/mol, respectively), where He and Ne can be considered too small and Xe and Rn too large for the selected Sn20H20 cavity size. Noble gases with the smaller radii (He and Ne) are rather small for the tin cage cavity, while the ones with the larger radii (Xe and Rn) exhibit lower energy released due to their volume. The lead dodecahedrane cage better accommodates noble gases with larger atomic radii (Figure 1), ranging from \u22121.31 kcal/mol for He to the largest amount of energy released for Rn (\u221210.55 kcal/mol).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5676 4 of 11Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\n(Figure 1), we can see that in general elements of the IV main group of the periodic table have shown lower encapsulation energies compared to the elements of the V main group. This difference is very small for the noble gases with smaller radii, but this difference increases with the increasing size of the noble gases\u2019 radii. Our suggestion for these phenomena is that the reverse side of a XH-group in X20H20 cages has less electron density compared to the reverse side of a X20 cages and that larger noble gases can therefore stabilize better. That suggestion can be supported by a color-filled contour line map of charge density for the investigated hosts X20H20 and X20 (Figures 2 and 3). Whereby, examining the cavity for the selected hosts, in a case of X20H20, there is less electron density inside the cavity in comparison to the X20 cages cavities.\nIn Table 2, complexation (encapsulation) energies are presented for the dodecahedrane cages based on eleme ts of the V main group of the periodic table. T e nitrogen-based cage exhib ts very high encapsulati n energies, going from 57.18 kcal/mol to 989.41 kcal/mol for the larg t noble gas Rn. The phosphorus cage accommodate noble gases with significantly lower encapsulation energies, but still unreasonably large amounts for the noble gases with larger radii (Kr, Xe and Rn). The arsenic-based dodecahedrane cage has encapsulation energy for He of ~0 kcal/mol, with a further linear increase (Figure 1) of the encapsulation energy going from Ne to Rn (from 3.34 kcal/mol to 73.03 kcal/mol, respectively). In the case of antimony cage noble gases, He, Ne, Ar and Kr have an error margin of ~0 kcal/mol, while Xe and Rn have encapsulation energies of 10.22 kcal/mol and 12.90 kcal/mol, respectively. The bismuth cage, like the previously described tin cage, releases energy upon hosting all noble gases, with the largest amount of energy released for hosting the noble gases Ar and Kr (\u22125.24 kcal/mol and \u22126.13 kcal/mol, respectively). Noble gases with the smaller radii (He and Ne) are rather small for the bismuth cage cavity, while the ones with the larger radii (Xe and Rn) exhibit lower energy released due to their volume. If we compare the encapsulation energies between the elements of the same period (Figure 1), we can see that in general elements of the IV main group of the periodic table have shown lower encapsulation energies compared to the elements of the V main group.

Additionally, for reason of comparison, encapsulation capabilities of two selected cages (Pb20H20 and Bi20) were tested on two more functionals, with the results presented in Table 3. Comparing these values with energies presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the same systems there is an obvious difference in quantifying the encapsulation energy depending on the theory level used. While in the case of the smaller noble gases He and Ne, the difference is in the error margin (~1 kcal/mol); for the Ar noble gas this difference becomes significant, and gradually increases with the increasing of the noble gases\u2019 radii. Also notable is that in the case of Bi20, the host\u03c9B97XD functional reproduced a minimum of energies for the noble gases\u2019 series (Ar and Kr), this minimum is absent in the case of APFD and B3LYP-GD3BJ functionals, where with the increasing of the noble gases radii we have a gradual increase of the complexation energy release upon encapsulation.\na Ecom: APFD/def2-tzvp//APFD/def2-svp/svpfit + ZPE(APFD/def2-svp/svpfit); b Ecom: B3LYP-GD3BJ/def2tzvp//B3LYP-GD3BJ/def2-svp/svpfit + ZPE(B3LYP-GD3BJ/def2-svp/svpfit).\nGeometric changes upon hosting a guest species can reveal insight into the flexibility of a host and its adaptability to accommodate a noble gas. In the case of the here selected dodecahedrane cages due to their symmetry, we selected two relevant structural parameters to describe their conformational change: bond distance between the atoms that are making a host (d; distance between the X adjacent atoms of a representative host) and the distance between one atom of the host to the hosted noble gas (b\u2014distance between the X atom of the host and the hosted Ng atom). These geometric properties for the investigated hosts X20H20 and X20 are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, and are plotted against the noble gas radii in Figure 4, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5676 7 of 11\nTable 4.

All the sel cted cages have prov n to be very rigid with no room for adjustability upon hosting a guest species, which is reflected in energy extremes depending on the noble gas radii. From dodecahedrane cages based on the IV group of the periodic table, the Sn20H20 cage can best accommodate noble gases with a medium size radius (Ar and Kr), while the Pb20H20 dodecahedrane host is best suited for noble gases with larger radii (Xe and Rn). On the other hand, from the elements of the V main group of the periodic table, the Bi20 cage has shown the best results to selectively encapsulate Ar and Kr with the amount of energy released, \u22125.24 kcal/mol and \u22126.13 kcal/mol, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5676 9 of 11\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28155676/s1, Figure S1.
