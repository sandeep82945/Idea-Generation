However, evidence is still scarce and new data are needed to define the exact risk and protective factors that can explain the variability in symptoms manifestation. In this study, we enrolled 257 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and we evaluated the levels of psychological distress through the Symptoms Checklist-90-R scale. Data concerning illness-related variables were collected from medical records, while the presence of subjective cognitive difficulties, both before and after the illness, as well as the level of the cognitive reserve (CR), were assessed over a clinical interview. Results revealed that being female and reporting the presence of subjective cognitive difficulties after COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. At the same time, being admitted to the hospital and having a high CR were protective factors. Adding new information to this emerging research field, our results highlight the importance of a complete psychological and cognitive assessment in patients with COVID-19.\nKeywords: COVID-19, cognitive reserve, psychological distress, subjective cognitive difficulties, protective factors, risk factors\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the last year and a half, the entire world has gone through the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). So far, more than 200 million cases of infection have been detected worldwide and more than 4 million deaths have unfortunately been recorded (World Health Organization). Indeed, the severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by this infection, widely ranges. It can either be asymptomatic or, in its mild to moderate form, characterized by physical symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing difficulties. Neurological symptoms can also be present, such as loss of smell and taste, febrile seizures, convulsions, change in mental status, and encephalitis. In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to a multisystemic disease often requiring oxygen therapy, hospitalization, and, in the worse cases,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852218\nintensive care and intubation. It is now well-established that the main risk factors that increase physical symptoms\u2019 severity are age, the presence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension (Jordan et al., 2020; Matsushita et al., 2020; Passamonti et al., 2020; Sattar et al., 2020; Wolff et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020).\nImportantly, symptoms of psychological distress, Anxiety, and post-traumatic stress have been reported among patients with COVID-19 (Xu et al., 2020; Bonazza et al., 2020; Janiri et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Rabinovitz et al., 2020; LiyanageDon et al., 2021), as well as months after recovery (Tomasoni et al., 2021). However, despite their impact on patients\u2019 quality of life, the psychological symptoms of COVID-19 have been scarcely investigated if compared with the physical ones, with no available evidence about their risk and potential protective factors. Indeed, obtaining this information would be extremely useful to maximize both prevention and treatment strategies of the so-called long-COVID syndrome, and the persistence of physical and psychological symptoms in patients who recovered from COVID-19.\nHence, to overcome this limitation by adding new knowledge to this research field, in this study, we evaluated the levels of psychological distress in a large group of patients who recovered from COVID-19, aiming to reach the following three objectives.\nThe first one concerned the study of the relation between COVID-19 severity and psychological distress. Indeed, although previous evidence has been reported so far, the currently available studies have obtained mixed results (see Mazza et al., 2020; Liyanage-Don et al., 2021; Putri et al., 2021; Sykes et al., 2021; Vincent et al., 2021), and new evidence is needed to shed light on the role of illness-related experiences, such as hospitalization or the need of oxygen supply therapy and psychological distress symptoms of patients who recovered from COVID-19.\nSecond, we aimed at studying the existence of an association between psychological distress and subjective cognitive difficulties in patients who recovered from COVID-19.\nIn fact, despite the presence of illness-related cognitive failures has been widely documented (Ferrucci et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021; Miskowiak et al., 2021), as well as the association between cognitive frailties and subsequent mood disorders, to the best of our knowledge, scarce evidence these variables among patients with COVID-19 is available.\nConcerning these first two objectives, we hypothesized that higher levels of psychological distress can be detected in those who experienced a higher level of COVID-19 severity and in those who reported the presence of cognitive failures.\nFinally, our third objective was to evaluate the potential role of cognitive reserve (CR) in the development of psychological distress symptoms in patients with COVID-19. CR is the ability to compensate for brain damage through neural networks and alternative cognitive strategies (Stern, 2009). CR represents a sort of cumulative cerebral potential derived from everyday life (i.e., education, working, and leisure time activities that are cognitively engaging and stimulating). It was found to play protective effects against medical diseases (Ribeiro et al., 2020), although evidence for its influence on psychopathological conditions is still scarce.\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which mood disorders were expected and reported by the current literature, it seems important to understand which factors may protect individuals from developing psychopathological issues (Coin et al., 2022). CR is supposed to have this role, thanks to the higher resilience (Ran et al., 2020), cognitive strategies, and resources people with high CR show every day. Hence, our hypothesis was to find a negative association between CR levels and psychological distress symptoms of COVID-19."

During a single follow-up, participants underwent neurological, ophthalmological, blood, cognitive, and psychological examinations. Inclusion criteria were previous positivity to syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a previous consultation and/or hospitalization, and aged between 18 and 90 years. Exclusion criteria were being non-Italian native speakers and the presence of important physical/sensory deficits, which could not allow the testing sessions to properly take place. Moreover, patients with medical records indicating a history of psychiatric illness were also excluded from the analysis, as well as those participants who asked for the medical investigation because of their subjective cognitive impairments in the last year. Every participant provided written informed consent before entering the study. Data were collected at the hospital\u2019s Psychology, the Infectious Diseases, and the Pneumology Operational Units of the Padova University Hospital, during post-hospitalization pneumatological and infectious follow-ups, occurring 1 month after the last negative nasopharyngeal swab test. The protocol was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on human rights and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Padova University Hospital."

Raw scores were transformed into T scores for all the 12 indices and, according to the normative values (Prunas et al., 2012), scores over 55 were considered clinically significant, with the range between 55 and 64 considered moderate severity and scores over 64 considered as major severity indices.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852218\nThe presence of subjective cognitive difficulties (i.e., forgetfulness, concentration drop, attentional lability, and distractibility) before, during the last year, and after COVID-19 infection was assessed using a semi-structured, \u201cad hoc\u201d clinical interviews. Answers have been categorized as binary variables (presence; yes vs. absence; no).\nTo evaluate CR, the Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq; Nucci et al., 2012) was employed. Responses to this questionnaire produce one global index (CRIq total score), and three sub-scores reflecting the role of education (CRIq-education), occupation (CRIq-working activities), and stimulating activities not related to education and work (CRIqleisure time).\nInformation about the severity of COVID-19 diseases, such as hospitalization, intubation,1 and oxygen supply,2 as well as the presence of neurological and previous psychiatric symptoms, was obtained from medical records."

            "text": "The main goal of this study is to add new knowledge to the growing research field investigating the post-COVID-19 symptoms. More specifically, we aimed to evaluate symptoms of psychological distress in patients who recovered from COVID19, confirming what the literature has reported, so far, and investigate the role of illness severity, subjective cognitive failures, and CR in their development and manifestation. To reach our goals, we administered the SCL-90-R scale to a sample of 257 patients who recovered from COVID-19, and we evaluated the role of the above-mentioned variables in the score\u2019s variability. Results show that more than 20% of the patients who recovered from COVID-19 who took part in this study showed clinically relevant symptoms of Anxiety,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852218\nDepression, Obsessive\u2013Compulsive disorder, Phobic Anxiety, and Somatization (it is interesting to note that, before the pandemic, the Italian prevalence of mental diseases was around 7%, De Girolamo et al., 2014).\nIf compared with the more recent studies statistics obtained from the Italian population during the pandemic (Delmastro and Zamariola, 2020; Rossi et al., 2020), these data suggest the presence of a significant level of psychological distress in patients who recovered from COVID-19, in line with previous reports (Xu et al., 2020; Bonazza et al., 2020; Janiri et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Rabinovitz et al., 2020; Liyanage-Don et al., 2021; Tomasoni et al., 2021). This result, although not suggesting new evidence, is still contributing to defining the psychological outcomes, of the date somehow mixed (Cooke et al., 2020) of individuals who suffered from COVID-19. Future studies would need to further examine the specific aspects of these psychological symptoms. For example, it would be important to investigate to what extent the Phobic Anxiety symptoms and the Obsessive\u2013Compulsive behaviors are related to possible COVID19 reinfection.\nCoherently with the literature (Hodes and Epperson, 2019; see also Yan et al., 2021), results also indicated that, even in this sample of patients, being female represented a risk factor for the development of psychological distress, and, more specifically, to obtain higher scores at the global index Positive Symptoms Total, which represents the number of SCL-90-R items scored above zero (this latter result, however, confirms what the original authors of the scale found through an investigation about factorial invariance across gender (Derogatis and Cleary, 1977).\nResults also indicated that, of the different illness-related variables considered in this study, only hospitalization had a significant role in explaining the variability of these symptoms. Specifically, results revealed a protective role of hospitalization on the scores obtained at the SCL-90-R Somatization subscale, which, according to Holi (2003), measures symptoms that have a high prevalence in disorders with suggested functional etiology and that reflects distress arising from bodily perceptions. Surprisingly, no other illness severity indices were found to be significantly associated with any of the SCL-90-R scores. We\ncould hypothesize that, regardless of the severity of COVID19, just being infected represents, in a historical experience as a worldwide pandemic, a strong enough event to develop and manifest psychological malaise. Although based on the first reading, the lack of other associations between illness severity and psychological distress could not seem in line with the current literature, we also believe that this result could be ascribed to the measurements used and the psychological domains explored.\nTaken together, these first set of results are coherent with the findings of Mazza et al. (2020), who reported that both being male and being admitted to the hospital represented protective factors against the development of psychological sequelae after COVID-19.\nWe hypothesized that being hospitalized may have induced individuals to feel more protected, in a safe space, in which potentially fatal consequences of the disease would have been early detected and treated by the hospital staff. Conversely, being infected and at home, could have made people feeling more vulnerable, lonely, and abandoned because of the disease.\nThe second set of results revealed a significant association between the presence of subjective cognitive difficulties and the level of psychological distress in patients who recovered from COVID-19.\nSpecifically, this association was quite broad and robust, as it was significant for each of the SCL-90-R subscales, and it was at the same time very specific since it concerned only the cognitive difficulties that patients report to be present after, but not before, their illness of COVID-19. These findings are coherent with the well-established relation between subjective cognitive failures and affective symptoms (for a meta-analysis see Hill et al., 2016; see also Mahoney et al., 1998), which has been also reported in recent studies, investigating the general population\u2019s mental health during the pandemic (Kelly, 2020; Fiorenzato et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2021; Santangelo et al., 2021). Adding new knowledge in the research field investigating psychological sequelae of recovered patients with COVID-19, our findings open new questions to be answered with followup studies.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852218\nIndeed, in absence of a pre-illness evaluation of both cognitive functions and psychological status, the association that emerged in this study does not give us information about the temporal dynamics of this symptom\u2019s association and can be, by now, read as proof of an association between the patient\u2019 distress and the subjective evaluation of cognitive abilities, and associations that were also documented in other clinical conditions (Goebel et al., 2013; Pranckeviciene et al., 2017). Furthermore, it could be that subjective cognitive difficulties can be intended as a proxy rather than a cause of distress. Our data are currently not able to disambiguate this point, which we believe represents an open issue to investigate.\nFinally, the third set of results revealed that CR represents a protective factor against the development of psychological distress symptoms in patients who recovered from COVID-19.\nSpecifically, a higher frequency of cognitively stimulating activities not directly related to education or occupation, such as going to the movies, driving a car, and managing a bank account, predicts lower levels of Depression, Anxiety, and Obsessive\u2013 Compulsive symptoms, expressed as clinically significant by more than 20% of the sample, as well as lower scores at the SCL-90-R sub-scales assessing Interpersonal Sensitivity and Psychoticism. These associations were also reflected by the ones between CR and two of the three SCL-90-R global indices, namely, the Global Severity Index, which is the average score of the 90 items of the questionnaire, and the Positive Symptom Total, which is the number of items scored above zero (Derogatis, 1992). It is interesting to note that CR related to leisure time activity showed the most significant results in our analyses considering the social restrictions adopted to control the COVID-19 spread. This makes even more sense if we look at some of the results, such as Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, and Psychoticism that are somehow implicated in individuals\u2019 social life and abilities.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study pointing out the role of CR and, more specifically, of the reserve build through a lifetime of cognitive and socially stimulating activity, not directly linked to the educational context, as a protective factor against the psychological distress symptoms experienced by patients who recovered from COVID19. Indeed, in a recent study by Yan et al. (2021), psychological distress was positively correlated with education, and negatively correlated with the frequency of contact with colleagues and with psychological resilience."

            "heading": "Limitations and Future Directions",
            "text": "Some limitations should be noted when considering our results. First, the lack of a psychological and cognitive assessment that preceded the illness, prevented us from evaluating more rigorously the changes in psychological wellbeing and cognitive functions due to COVID-19. Second is the lack of a control group, either of individuals who have never contracted the virus, or of patients who had a different diagnosis in the same historical period. Recognizing these two as the main limitations of our study, we have directly addressed them by asking participants to evaluate their psychological and cognitive wellbeing before the diagnosis of COVID-19, and adopting an analytic approach aimed to investigate the role\nof specific COVID-19-related variables, which would not have been evaluable in healthy individuals or patients with different clinical conditions. On the other hand, also asking patients directly about their cognitive and psychological wellbeing could represent a bias per se since it is not unobjectionable to their meta-cognitive ability. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that individuals with psychiatric diseases were excluded from the study; however, this information was only collected by a self-report and consulting clinical records without assessing the presence/absence of diseases through specific tools. Finally, and similarly to the previous consideration, the presence/absence of cognitive difficulties was simply asked from participants without a neuropsychological screening. Also, data about cognitive status before the pandemic should be carefully considered, considering the self-report methodology adopted.\nFuture development of the present work could take into account these aspects by planning multiple follow-ups and testings of patients who recovered from COVID-19. This would allow not only to overcome these limitations, but also to better define the psychological and cognitive aspects of COVID-19."
