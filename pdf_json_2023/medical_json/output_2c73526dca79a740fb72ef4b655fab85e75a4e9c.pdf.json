    "abstractText": "Background: Fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5) gene encodes irisin that regulates adipose tissue metabolism. Peroxide-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is a powerful promoter of mitochondrial biosynthesis and oxidative metabolism, which plays an important role in inducing heat production and energy consumption of brown fat. PGC1-\u03b1 expression stimulated an increase in expression of FNDC5. Purpose: The aims of this study were to analyze the association between FNDC5, PGC-1\u03b1 genetic variants and overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents. Methods: A total of 198 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity and 198 children and adolescents with normal weight were screened according to gender and age 1:1. The healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time were surveyed using food frequency questionnaire and CLASS questionnaire, respectively. Genotypes of FNDC5 and PGC-1\u03b1 gene were detected using SNaPshot method. Results: GT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased the risk of overweight or obesity in boys (OR (95% CI): 1.68 (1.00, 2.93)) based on overdominant model; GG genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) decreased the risk of overweight or obesity in girls and boys (OR (95% CI): 0.45 (0.21,0.97), 0.45 (0.24, 0.83), respectively) based on dominant model; TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased the risk of overweight or obesity in girls based on recessive model (OR (95% CI): 2.46 (1.19, 5.05)), and based on the additive model (OR (95% CI): 3.82 (1.49, 9.80)). There was significant interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time, interaction between PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents. Conclusion: FNDC5 (rs16835198) played an independent or interactive role with PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.",

Peroxide-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is a powerful promoter of mitochondrial biosynthesis and oxidative metabolism, which plays an important role in inducing heat production and energy consumption of brown fat. PGC1-\u03b1 expression stimulated an increase in expression of FNDC5. Purpose: The aims of this study were to analyze the association between FNDC5, PGC-1\u03b1 genetic variants and overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents. Methods: A total of 198 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity and 198 children and adolescents with normal weight were screened according to gender and age 1:1. The healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time were surveyed using food frequency questionnaire and CLASS questionnaire, respectively. Genotypes of FNDC5 and PGC-1\u03b1 gene were detected using SNaPshot method. Results: GT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased the risk of overweight or obesity in boys (OR (95% CI): 1.68 (1.00, 2.93)) based on overdominant model; GG genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) decreased the risk of overweight or obesity in girls and boys (OR (95% CI): 0.45 (0.21,0.97), 0.45 (0.24, 0.83), respectively) based on dominant model; TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased the risk of overweight or obesity in girls based on recessive model (OR (95% CI): 2.46 (1.19, 5.05)), and based on the additive model (OR (95% CI): 3.82 (1.49, 9.80)). There was significant interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time, interaction between PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents. Conclusion: FNDC5 (rs16835198) played an independent or interactive role with PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.

Existing studies have shown that serum irisin and its genetic polymorphism are closely related to dyslipidemia and glucose metabolism, and may become a new target for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases.6\nIrisin is a new muscle/adipocytokine discovered in recent years to enhance fat burning and weight loss by increasing energy expenditure, improving glucose tolerance and inducing mitochondrial genetic expression.7 Irisin is encoded by the fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5) gene.8,9 As a precursor of irisin, FNDC5 is highly expressed in the heart, brain, liver and skeletal muscle, and is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.10,11 It has been reported that the levels of FNDC5 mRNA in adipose tissue and circulating irisin negatively correlated with hyperglycaemia, triglycerides, visceral adiposity and extramyocellular lipid deposition.12 Studies have shown that the wild GG genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) is also significantly associated with increased fasting glucose levels in diabetic subjects.13 However, other studies have shown that the TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) is associated with several metabolic parameters in circulating serum, suggesting that both TT genotype and T allele may increase obesity susceptibility.14 Remarkably, results of these study showed the SNPs of FNDC5 gene correlated with obesity and glucose-lipid metabolism, which may be because it modulate the levels of serum irisin.15,16\nPeroxide-proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is a powerful promoter of mitochondrial biosynthesis and oxidative metabolism, and can induce high expression of brown fat cell uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), which plays an important role in inducing heat production and energy consumption of brown fat.17 Two common SNPs of PGC1\u03b1 (rs8192678, rs3755863) were associated with obesity,18 which may lead to the development of metabolic syndrome, but the effects may be small and depend on interactions of gene-gene and gene-environment. PGC-1\u03b1 genetic variants may be one of the genetic causes of obesity in different periods of human life. The effects of genetic variants and interaction between PGC-1\u03b1 and FNDC5 genes on obesity in children and adolescents are still poorly understood. The purpose of the current study was to reveal the relationship between FNDC5 (rs16835198), PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678, rs3755863), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time and overweight or obesity in Chinese children and adolescents based on the case-control study."

There was significant association between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and overweight or obesity, interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678), healthy eating behaviors, moderate-tovigorous physical activity time, and interaction between PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents.\nThe results of this study showed that healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time were not associated with overweight or obesity in sample children and adolescents. Traub et al26 reported that skipping breakfast and increasing screen time were risk factors for overweight or obesity in children and adolescents. Raistenskis et al27 found that obese children had less physical activity than those with normal weight, and sedentary lifestyle was not conducive to the health outcomes of children and adolescents.28 Of course, some studies have shown that the relationships between eating behaviors, physical activity and obesity are not significant.29 In addition, it can also be related to the memory bias of the subjective measurement method of eating behavior and physical activity time. This may also be due to the fact that obese children and adolescents have a higher awareness of healthy eating behaviors and physical activity, and intentionally improve their unhealthy eating behaviors or increase physical activity time to loss weight.\nThis study found that the SNP of FNDC5 (rs16835198) was significantly associated with overweight or obesity in children and adolescents. T allele frequency of FNDC5 (rs16835198) in overweight or obese children was higher than that in normal weight children. Based on different genetic models, the results showed that TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased the risk of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents. Todendi et al30 reported that TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) increased risk of obesity in South Brazilian children and adolescents. The studies showed that the obese adults with TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) had higher levels of total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C).14 Tang et al31 reported that the interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and BMI could affect fasting insulin level in Chinese population. However, the studies also showed that TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) was associated with decreased risk of T2DM, and G allele of FNDC5 (rs16835198) was associated with elevated insulin resistance

Studies also demonstrated that irisin is not only a myokine but also an adipokine, with important autocrine and paracrine functions.34 Luo et al3 proposed that lack of irisin was associated with a poor browning response, glucose/lipid derangement, and decreased bone mass in mice. These may be a reasonable explanation for the association between T allele, TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) and overweight or obesity.\nIn this study, the results of generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) showed that there was significant interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678) in the occurrence of\nFigure 1 OR values of FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678, rs3755863) associated with overweight or obesity based on different genetic models.\nDovepress Wang et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\noverweight or obesity in children and adolescents. Bostr\u00f6m et al35 showed that in mouse that PGC1-\u03b1 expression in muscle stimulated an increase in expression of FNDC5.

Studies suggest that PGC-1\u03b1 can be a potential therapeutic target for various metabolic diseases.37 Lin et al38 demonstrated that A allele of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) was an independent risk factor of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese children and adolescents. These may be a reasonable explanation for the interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and PGC-1\u03b1 (rs3755863, rs8192678) in the occurrence of overweight or obesity.\nThe results of this study showed that there was significant interaction between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and healthy eating behaviors, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents, and the TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) had the most significant effect. This shows that the children with TT genotype of FNDC5 (rs16835198) are more likely to be obese if they have insufficient healthy eating behavior or moderate to high intensity physical activity. The FNDC5 (rs16835198) variant may effect encoding of irisin, thus affecting role of irisin in energy metabolism. Studies showed that exercise increased levels of irisin in children, which may be more instrumental in mediating lipid metabolism.39\nThe interaction between PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time was significant in the occurrence of overweight or obesity in children and adolescents, and the GA genotype of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) had the most significant effect. This means that the children with GA genotype of PGC-1 (rs8192678) and insufficient physical activity are more likely to be obese. In a meta-analysis of the PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) variant, the A allele and AA genotype were suggested to be beneficial for athletic performance.40 The study showed that the adolescents with A allele of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) had higher TG than those with G allele of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678).41 Some studies showed that PGC-1\u03b1 gene regulated the induction of muscle adaptation training.42 Endurance training can increase expression of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA.43 However, the association between PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) and physical performance was not reproducible in different races and populations.44 Eynon et al45 found that the GG genotype of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) was conducive to the increase in aerobic capacity. Yang et al reported that the G allele of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) was associated with endurance performance, while the A allele of PGC-1\u03b1 (rs8192678) was associated with power performance in Chinese Han Population.46\nThere were also some limitations. First, the subjective methods were used to measure healthy eating behaviors and physical activity time, which might have recall bias. Second, children suffering from obesity may increase their awareness of healthy eating behaviors and physical activities, so that they can change unhealthy eating behaviors or strengthen physical exercise. Third, we only studied Chinese children and adolescents, the generalizability to other ethnic groups was limited. Finally, the exact molecular mechanism of association between FNDC5 (rs16835198) and childhood overweight or obesity remained to be elucidated."
