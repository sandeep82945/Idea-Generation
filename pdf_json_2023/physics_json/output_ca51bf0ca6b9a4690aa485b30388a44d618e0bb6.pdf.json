    "abstractText": "A new series of 7\u2010substituted coumarin scaffolds containing a methyl ester moiety at the C4\u2010 position were synthesized and tested for their in vitro anti\u2010proliferative activity against MCF\u20107 and MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 breast cancer cell lines using Doxorubicin (DOX) as reference. Compounds 2 and 8 showed noticeable selectivity against MCF\u20107 with IC50 = 6.0 and 5.8 \u03bcM, respectively compared to DOX with IC50 = 5.6 \u03bcM. Compounds 10, 12, and 14 exhibited considerable selectivity against Estrogen Negative cells with IC50 = 2.3, 3.5, and 1.9 \u03bcM, respectively) compared to DOX with (IC50 = 7.3 \u03bcM). The most promising compounds were tested as epidermal growth factor receptor and aromatase (ARO) enzymes inhibitors using erlotinib and exemestane (EXM) as standards, respectively. Results proved that compound 8 elicited the highest inhibitory activity (94.73% of the potency of EXM), while compounds 10 and 12 displayed 97.67% and 81.92% of the potency of Erlotinib, respectively. Further investigation showed that the promising candidates 8, 10, and 12 caused cell cycle arrest at G0\u2013G1 and S phases and induced apoptosis. The mechanistic pathway was confirmed by elevating caspases\u20109 and Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratio. A set of in silico methods was also performed including docking, bioavailability ADMET screening and QSAR study",

The most promising compounds were tested as epidermal growth factor receptor and aromatase (ARO) enzymes inhibitors using erlotinib and exemestane (EXM) as standards, respectively. Results proved that compound 8 elicited the highest inhibitory activity (94.73% of the potency of EXM), while compounds 10 and 12 displayed 97.67% and 81.92% of the potency of Erlotinib, respectively. Further investigation showed that the promising candidates 8, 10, and 12 caused cell cycle arrest at G0\u2013G1 and S phases and induced apoptosis. The mechanistic pathway was confirmed by elevating caspases\u20119 and Bax/Bcl\u20112 ratio. A set of in silico methods was also performed including docking, bioavailability ADMET screening and QSAR study\nOne of the prominent causes of cancer mortality in women is breast cancer (BC), the second-most common cancer1. About 75% of BC is caused by the estrogen receptor (ER)2.\nInhibition of estrogen biosynthesis is one effective approach for hormone-dependent BC therapy in postmenopausal women3. The aromatase enzyme (ARO) is one of the enzymatic mechanisms that may regulate the increased estrogen levels found in BC cells. Exemestane (EXM) (Ia) is among the reported powerful aromatase inhibitors (AIs)4.\nOn the other hand, the most often overexpressed receptors in BC cells are tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs), e.g., the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)5. Thus, targeting those receptors is a promising way to develop novel anticancer drugs. In this context, the first reported EGFR inhibitor highly expressed in different forms of cancers is Erlotinib (Ib)6,7.\nMoreover, targeting various apoptotic pathways is also an effective approach for all types of cancer8,9. Any pathway stage can be targeted for cancer treatment10.\nIn light of the above information, developing and synthesizing novel anticancer candidates with increased selectivity is essential. The varied biological characteristics of coumarin-containing drugs, especially anticancer activity, have generated much interest11\u201313. Investigations into the biological properties of coumarins have found that they can target multiple cancer pathways, including aromatase inhibition, kinase inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and angiogenesis suppression14,15.\nStudying the structures of EXM (Ia)16,17 and erlotinib (Ib)18 (Fig.\u00a01a) has provided important structural information which helped us in the rational design of new potent ARO/EGFR inhibitors.\nImportantly, various anticancer candidates based upon coumarin skeletons (II-VII) and their structural characteristics were selected as the main pharmacophore in developing multitargeted anti-BC19\u201323. In this work, the molecular design was mostly based on two strategies:\nOPEN\n1Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt. 2Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Delta University for Science and Technology, International Coastal Road, Gamasa City 35712, Egypt. *email: habib2001@mans.edu.eg\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13370 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40232-3\na\nb\nFigure\u00a01.

Secondly, structural optimization of the lead compounds through the following (Fig.\u00a01b):\n1. The planar coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) scaffold is a bioisostere to the quinazoline scaffold in erlotinib and tetrahydronaphtalene-1,7-dione nucleus in EXM. Such a skeleton will be essential for anticancer activity24,25. 2. The hydrophobic phenyl ring attached to the C4-position of the coumarin nucleus by introducing a spacer is previously considered a biologically active pharmacophore that is considered to be crucial for the activity26\u201329. 3. The reported SAR research demonstrated that conjugates containing benzyl groups at the C7-position exhibited more activity than their alkyl analogs. Introducing F or Cl groups on the benzyl ring resulted in good activity19,23. 4. The rotatable atoms of the linker enable the phenyl group to close the entrance cavity in the aromatase binding site30.\nBased on the above findings, we worked on synthesizing 7-substituted coumarin derivatives with flexible C4-position ester functionality to examine their impact on two BC cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, as well as normal breast cells MCF-10A. The synthetic compounds were tested in\u00a0vitro for their ability to inhibit the EGFR and ARO enzymes.\nThe most potent compounds, such as cell cycle examination and apoptosis markers, were selected for additional studies to discover the molecular process behind their anticancer activity.\nMoreover, molecular modeling studies were conducted to identify the two enzymes\u2019 interaction patterns and investigate the relationship between their physicochemical features and inhibitory action. Additionally, QSAR analysis was performed."

The structures of new intermediates derivatives 2\u20134 were confirmed using spectral data. 1H NMR spectrum showed the appearance of exchangeable OH protons at 10.69\u201310.72 ppm and CH2 protons at 5.50\u20135.60 ppm. Besides, 13C NMR exhibited signals at 165.6\u2013166.9 assigned to C=O of the carboxylate group. All the aromatic carbons appeared in the expected region. Moreover, the IR spectrum showed a characteristic broad band at 3100\u20133200 cm\u22121 corresponding to the OH group and a typical carbonyl group absorption at 1690\u20131720 cm\u22121 corresponding to two carbonyl groups.\nThe intermediates 5 and 6 were synthesized through benzoylation of the phenolic 7-OH group in 1 with the appropriate phenacyl bromide in the presence of acetone and K2CO3. Confirmation of structures by spectral data revealed the appearance of singlet 1H NMR signal at \u03b4 5.77\u20135.79 characteristic for the newly formed \u2013OCH2\u2013 and appearance of new C=O group 13C NMR signal at \u03b4 193.3\u2013194.8.\nNew Target coumarin derivatives 7\u201312 were obtained from 1 through two pathways: nucleophilic substitution of 1 and benzoylation of 2\u20134 (pathway A, Fig.\u00a02)34,35. The order of these two steps can be reversed to produce the same target coumarin derivatives 7\u201312 (Pathway B, Fig.\u00a02). It was observed that pathway B was less favorable than A in relation to the yield and purity of products. This may be due to competitive alkylation at the acidic methylenic group at position-4. The bulky benzoate group will hinder this side reaction sterically more than the chloride group, which goes along with the literature31. The reported yields (45\u201377%) and compound\u2019s characteristics of 7\u201312 were based on pathway A. It is worth reporting that the one-pot reaction was tried, but unfortunately, the yield and purity of products were poor (Pathway C, Fig.\u00a02).\nThe structures of 7\u201312 were confirmed by spectral data in which the exchangeable proton OH disappeared in their 1H NMR. A singlet signal of COCH2 protons appeared at \u03b4 5.78\u20135.81 ppm, and another singlet for CH2Cl appeared upfield at \u03b4 5.60\u20135.64 ppm. The aromatic protons were found at the expected region and pattern. Moreover, 13C NMR spectra revealed the presence of three carbonyl groups at the ranges of 196.4\u2013193.3, 165.6\u2013164.8, and 162.9\u2013161.6, corresponding to benzoyl C=O, benzoate C=O, and coumarin C=O; respectively.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a03, the acetylation reaction was carried out with a mixture of acetic anhydride and acetic acid to yield O-acetylated coumarins (13\u201315)36. The presence of the acetyl group was confirmed by a singlet peak at 2.33\u20132.34 ppm corresponding to COCH3 in 1H NMR and a signal of C=O at 169.2\u2013169.3 in 13C NMR. In addition, the singlet signal of OCH2 in 1H NMR spectrum was found at 5.62\u20135.67 ppm. The aromatic protons were found at their expected aromatic regions. 13C NMR spectra proved the presence of three carbonyl groups at the ranges of 169.2\u2013169.4, 165.4\u2013165.6, and 158.9\u2013159.8 corresponding to acetyl C=O, benzoate C=O, and coumarin C=O, respectively. All the chemical synthetic steps were found adequate and concise with appropriate yields.\nIn vitro biological evaluation. Measurement of in\u00a0vitro cytotoxic activity by MTT assay. For the MCF-7 cell line, results shown in Table\u00a01 revealed that the most powerful compounds were methyl benzoate derivatives 2 and 8 with IC50 = 6.0 \u00b5M and 5.8 \u00b5M, respectively, compared to IC50 = 5.6 \u00b5M for the standard drug DOX.\nFor MDA-MB-231, the most promising action was reported for compounds 4, 5, methyl benzoate derivatives 10, 12, and compound 14 with IC50 values of 6.4, 5.8, 2.3, 3.5, and 1.9 \u00b5M, respectively, compared to the standard drug DOX which had IC50 value of 7.3 \u00b5M.\nStructure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) study. Starting compound 1 was devoid of activity against both types of cell lines.\nThe introduction of benzoate substituent at position-4 in the coumarin scaffold was observed to potentiate the activity. This is possibly explained by specific hydrophobic interactions of the phenyl group.\nEvidently, the compound bearing unsubstituted benzoate 2 exhibited superior selectivity against MCF-7 than against MDA-MB-231 with IC50 = 6 \u00b5M versus IC50 = 51.9 \u00b5M, respectively, compared to the reference drug.\nIncorporation of the electron-withdrawing group at position-4 on the aromatic moiety in compound 3 showed moderate selectivity towards MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231. Conversely, the substitution of an electron-donating\nFigure\u00a03.

Incorporation of 2-oxo-2-phenylethoxy at position-7 of coumarin moiety in compounds 7, 9, and 11 diminished the activity against the MCF-7 cell line while resulting in poor anti-proliferative activity against the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Compound 9 bearing halogen atom at p-position was identified as the most significant cytotoxic candidate among the series revealing potent selectivity against the MDA-MB-231 cell line with IC50 value of 10.4 \u00b5M.\nIn general, mono substitution with an electron-withdrawing group on phenyl moiety such as p-chloro atom located at C7- of coumarin ring in compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14 dramatically improved the activity against both cell lines, in comparison to the unsubstituted derivatives. In this context, it could be stressed that the target compound 8 showed high selectivity against MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 5.8 \u00b5M versus IC50 = 27.5 \u00b5M), while compounds 10, 12 and 14 showed superior selectivity against MDA-MB-231 with IC50 = 2.3, 3.5 and 1.9 \u00b5M, respectively. Fortunately, compound 12 was the most potent among this series against both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 with IC50 = 13.2 \u00b5M and 3.5 \u00b5M, respectively.\nSurprisingly, compound 6 with an electron-withdrawing chlorine atom exhibited a lower activity level against both cell lines, which was assumed to involve H-bonds with amino acids in the ligand-binding domain.\nConcerning coumarins 13\u201315 carrying 7-acetyloxy group, derivative 14 showed superior selectivity against MDA-MB-231 than MCF-7 by 150 times with (IC50 = 1.9 \u00b5M). In contrast, compound 15 showed moderate anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 (IC50 = 17.1 \u00b5M).\nIn vitro cytotoxicity against nonmalignant human cells. The compounds were also examined against the human nonmalignant cells MCF10A (breast) to investigate their selectivity between nonmalignant cells and cancerous cells. Compared to DOX (IC50 = 12.4 \u00b5M), the most active compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14 were less toxic to MCF10A cells (IC50 = 79.9, 76.8, 72.1 and 263.1 \u00b5M, respectively) with good SI values (more than 10) (Table\u00a01).\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition assays.

So, an enzyme assay study was performed for ARO and EGFR enzymes in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines, respectively.\nIt was observed that compounds 10 and 12 showed the highest inhibition effect towards EGFR, displaying 97.67% and 81.92% of the potency of erlotinib, respectively (Table\u00a02, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1). Therefore, their potent selectivity against MDA-MB-231 might be due to EFGR inhibition pathway.\n\u2022 (ARO) enzyme inhibition assay\nTo convert androgens into estrogens, the MCF-7 cell line was shown to possess enough aromatase enzyme activity37. Results are presented in Table\u00a03, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2, and revealed that target compound 8 is considered the most potent AIs with (IC50 value = 0.114 \u00b5M), compared to EXM (IC50 value = 0.108 \u00b5M), and this described the elevated value of IC50 in MCF-7 (5.8 \u00b5M). Furthermore, target compound 2 exhibited half ARO inhibitory activity as that of reference EXM.\nCell cycle arrest. Results are presented in Table\u00a04, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3. Regarding the MCF-7 cell line, the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased significantly in the pre-G1 phase by 18.67 folds with significant arrest in G0-G1 and S phases by 1.508 and 1.33 folds, respectively compared to the untreated control cells for compound 8. For MDA-MB-231 cell lines, when treated with compounds 10, 12 and 14, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the pre-G1 phase increased by 16.22, 22.46 and 19.9 folds with consequential cell cycle arrest at the S phase by 1.59, 1.08 and 1.38 folds, respectively. Results indicated that compound 8 tested against the MCF-7 cell line and compounds 10, 12 and 14 tested against the MDA-MB-231 cell line showed pre-G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the S phase in addition to G0-G1 by compound 8.\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13370 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40232-3\nApoptosis determination using annexin V\u2011FITC/PI dual staining assay.. To further assure the apoptotic ability of compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14 using dual staining with propidium\u00a0 iodide\u00a0 (PI)\u00a0 and\u00a0 annexin-V-FITC, a flow cytometric analysis was carried out to distinguish between living, early, late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Propidium iodide stains late apoptotic\u00a0 and\u00a0 necrotic\u00a0 cells\u2019 DNA, while annexin-V binds powerfully and distinctively to phosphatidylserine (PS)\u00a0on\u00a0their\u00a0surfaces\u00a0and\u00a0fluoresces\u00a0 green38.

In addition, each profile\u2019s quadrant has four sections: necrosis, late and early apoptosis, and living cells, clockwise from the upper left. Results are demonstrated in Table\u00a05, indicating that compound 8 showed % apoptosis 31.19 for MCF-7 cells while % apoptosis for MDAMB-231 cells of compounds 10, 12 and 14 was found to be 33.43, 46.28 and 41.02, respectively; compared to 1.67 and 2.06 for control untreated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.\nEffect on the levels of Bax/Bcl\u20112. Apoptosis is provoked in a cell through two major apoptotic pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. By overexpressing anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 or downregulating pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, cancer cells can develop apoptotic resistance39. In this study, we measured the levels of Bax and Bcl2 to evaluate the effects of compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14, which showed promising apoptosis-inducing activity on the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. As shown in (Supplementary Table\u00a0S6 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7), the tested compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14 significantly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax by 5.27, 5.27, 5.22 and 4.9 folds, respectively, with a consequent decline in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels by 0.44, 0.377, 0.271 and 0.329 folds, respectively compared to the control. As a result, a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was observed, supporting the claim that the tested compounds can improve the therapeutic response in breast cancer.\nCaspase\u20119 activation. Caspase-9, activated in apoptotic cells by intrinsic pathways, can be used as a marker for the induction of apoptosis by anticancer agents.40. In the present study, the levels of caspase-9 were then measured in the compounds that showed a noticeable increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to identify a possible pathway for the antiproliferative activity of the most promising compounds. Significantly elevated levels of caspase-9\nTable 4.

These results suggested that all tested compounds could induce a significant overexpression in caspase-9 protein level higher than that elicited by control, assuming that apoptosis was probably due to the activation of caspase-9 protein.\nStatistical analysis and data interpretation. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software, version\u00a025 (SPSS Inc., PASW Statistics for Windows version 25. Chicago: SPSS Inc.). Apoptosis was described using numbers and percentages. Quantitative data were described using mean \u00b1 Standard deviation for normally distributed data after testing normality using Shapiro Wilk test. The significance of the obtained results was judged at the (\u2264 0.05) level. Chi-Square and Z-tests were used to compare qualitative data between groups as appropriate. One Way ANOVA test was used to compare more than 2 independent groups with Post Hoc Tukey test to detect pair-wise comparison.\nIn silico computational study. Docking into EGFR crystal structure. Re-docking results of the co-crystallized ligand (Erlotinib) and its binding mode18,30,41 were described in (Table\u00a06, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0S10, and S11).\nDocking results showed that compounds 10 and 12 exhibited good binding interactions and docking scores similar to Erlotinib (Table\u00a06). It is suggested that the planarity of quinazoline moiety in erlotinib seems important for stabilizing the EGFR binding site. Similarly, the planar nature of the coumarin scaffold in compounds 10 and 12 allowed them to be embedded into the active site of EGFR, as shown in their 2D interactions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S12) and 3D binding modes as in Fig.\u00a05. It was found that the C=O group of the coumarin skeleton overlapped with the N1 atom of the quinazoline moiety of erlotinib, which equivalently served to anchor with Met 769, which was considered the key interaction improving the stabilization. By investigating the binding site of the receptor, the presence of o-methoxy or p-chloro phenyl moiety at position 4-methyl carboxylate of coumarin nucleus in compounds 10 and 12, respectively, were observed to be positioned in the hydrophobic pocket, which included side chains Leu 764, Leu 753, Met 742, Ile 720 and Ile 765 as for the ethynyl-phenyl group in erlotinib42 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S13).\nMoreover, additional halogen bond interactions were shown with the amino acid His 781 with the chloride atom on C4 of the phenyloxy side chain at C7 of the coumarin nucleus with bond length (2.22 \u00c5 for compound 10 and 2.32 \u00c5 for compound 12). This interaction appears to help their immobilization; in the same way, the ether side chain in erlotinib as illustrated in (Fig.\u00a04).\nIn order to rationalize the biological outcomes, it was believed that the poor EGFR inhibitory action of compounds 11 and 14 was related to their failure to bind with the essential amino acid and their low docking score of -5.7394 and -5.4982 kcal/ mol, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S14). Hence, the acquired data revealed that the binding modes of the investigated compounds were consistent with their EGFR inhibitory action.\nOn the other hand, despite compound 8 showing the same binding features as the most potent EGFR inhibitors 10 and 12 into the active site with a docking score of -6.7717 kcal/ mol and RMSD = 1.9314 \u00c5, it unexpectedly possessed weak EGFR inhibitory activity. However, it could be stated that other factors that affect activity related to lipophilicity and solubility may be involved.\nDocking into ARO crystal structure. Results of re-docked ligands (ASD and EXM) are summarized in (Table\u00a06) and their binding modes are described in (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S15). Aromatase enzymes comprise a heme prosthetic group containing iron at the active reaction center43.\nRegarding compound 8, the most potent AI showed an acceptable binding mode (Table\u00a06, Fig.\u00a05). When compared to the binding mode of ligands, it was found that the coumarin scaffold was stabilized by arene-arene interaction with the 5-membered ring of the heme moiety, which is considered the binding driving interaction.\nUnsubstituted benzoate at position-4 of coumarin is essential for activity, binding with Met 374 by H-bond (2.84 \u00c5) and providing a convenient allocation in the hydrophobic pocket, constituted of Val 373, Met 374, Leu 372, Ile 398 residues.\nIntroducing a substituent on the phenyl moiety (p-chloro or o-methoxy) resulted in a dramatic decrease in activity due to either a steric effect or a change in lipophilicity.\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13370 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40232-3\nIn particular, the distance between the benzene ring placed in the hydrophobic pocket and the coumarin moiety is likely the same as the entire length of ASD (6.97 \u00c5, 6.69 \u00c5, respectively) and plays a significant role in the control of affinity. The substitution at position-4 on the methylene bridge could be responsible for the activity.\nIn addition, the phenyl ethoxy side chain at position-7 slightly twisted to be embedded into the binding site and seemed to induce additional weak H-bond with Thr 310 (3.64 \u00c5) to close the entrance cavity between Asp 309 and Ser 47820. The longer the substituent at position-7 could justify the better affinity to the binding site than the free OH moiety. These three binding site interactions were fulfilled when the coumarin ring carried benzyl carboxylate methyl group at position-4 and p-chlorophenyl ethoxy substituent at position-7. Therefore, the better binding mode of target compound 8 when compared to compound 2 can be explained, in which it showed the same binding manner with the backbone amide group of Met 374 (3.42 \u00c5) and the heme moiety through arene\u2013H interaction. Although, the free hydroxyl group at position-7 exhibited a decrease in activity due to the inability to close the entrance side of the pocket (Fig.\u00a05). The 2D binding poses of both compounds are shown in (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S16).\nOn the other hand, because of the correlation between the bulkiness of the position-4 substituent and the activity, it may be presumed that the o-methoxy substituent in compound 11 (IC50 = 5.98 \u00b5M) generated steric hindrance in the rear side of the pocket and unstable binding mode with score (S) = \u2212\u00a00.1435\u00a0kcal/mol. In addition, compound 6 (IC50 = 3.93 \u00b5M) did not illustrate the three-site binding hypothesis since its molecular volume is smaller than the pocket site. They both shared the lack of essential interaction in either the rear side or the entrance side and unacceptable values of RMSD of more than 2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S17).\nBioavailability and ADMET properties screening. To understand the pharmacokinetic behavior of the most active compounds 8, 10, 12 and 14, their physicochemical characters were calculated with the aid of the online application ADMETSAR server http:// lmmd. ecust. edu. cn/ admet sar1 by applying various qualitative ADMET models as described in (Table\u00a07). The results revealed that all compounds possessed good intestinal absorption and could penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier. Besides, the candidate compounds illustrated good oral bioavailability, making them promising candidates as anti-BC agents.\nFigure\u00a04. (a) Binding mode of compound 10 (blue) and erlotinib (green), (b) Binding mode of compound 12 (blue) and erlotinib (green), (c) Binding mode of compound 10 (red), compound 12 (green) and erlotinib (blue) occupying the active site. The 2 compounds had the same binding mode as the native ligand. They bound with the key residue Met 769. The presence of p-chloro atom improved their stability. The hydrophobic side chain in both compounds changed their orientation to embed in hydrophobic pocket. The coumarin moiety was buried in the pocket in parallel to quinazoline nucleus in erlotinib.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:13370 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40232-3\nQSAR study. The QSAR analysis was carried out on the synthesized compounds against MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, where most compounds showed good selectivity using MOE software.

Various physicochemical descriptors were calculated.\nFigure\u00a05. 3D binding modes of compounds 2 and 8 inside ARO binding pocket (PDB ID: 3EQM) and compounds 10 and 12 into the active site of EGFR (PDB ID: 1 M17).\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:13370 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40232-3\nVsurf descriptors explained the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, while the hydrophobic bindings were described by the vsurf_D descriptors (vsurf_D5 and vsurf_D3)44,45.\nThe following equation represents the best QSAR model is: pIC50 = 7.49008 + 0.41537 log P (o/w)\u20140.01752 E_vdw + 0.26664 opr_nrot\u20140.02428 vsurf_D3\u20140.00142 Weight + 0.01549 vsurf_D5\u20140.26814 logS (with root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.39205 and squared correlation coefficient (r2) = 0.21403. According to the previous equation, the anticancer activity was enhanced by log P (lipophilicity), vsurf D5 (hydrophobic bindings), and Opr nrot (number of rotatable bonds), while the activity is negatively correlated with the following: van der Waal energy, polar interactions, molecular weight, and log S (aqueous solubility).\nThe reliability of the built model was confirmed by excellent linearity [$PRED = 0.2094 (pIC50) + 4.215], with R2 = 0.326 (Fig.\u00a06) and the relative values between the predicted and experimental activities (Table\u00a08). It was found that the predicted values are close to those experimentally investigated, indicating that the QSAR model is reliable and can be safely applied to predict more effective compounds."

Easy and good-yielding synthetic pathways were adopted to prepare the designed compounds. MTT assay method was used to evaluate their in\u00a0vitro anti-BC activity against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A cell lines using Doxorubicin (DOX) as a reference drug. Generally, most of the tested compounds revealed MDA-MB-231 selectivity more than MCF-7.
