In this one-pot pyrolysis method, which does not require any reagents to\nreduce Pt metal precursors or stabilize Pt nanoparticles, Pt nanoparticles are readily immobilized onto the sp2 surface by a thin IL layer formed at the interface, which can work as a binder. We used three types of sp2 carbon materials with different geometric shapes (graphene nanoplatelets with <3 (GNPs-3)\nand 18\u201324 layers (GNPs-20) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)) to investigate Pt\nnanoparticle formation and anchoring. All the electrocatalysts, especially Pt/MWCNTs, showed higher durability than the commercial catalyst owing to the combined effect of the IL binder and sp2 carbon\nmaterials. Our findings strongly suggest that the original carbon surface properties are also an important\nfactor for creating high-performance ORR electrocatalysts."

The latter is regarded as an unavoidable issue owing to the dissolution3 and Ostwald ripening4 of Pt nanoparticles under harsh operating conditions. In addition, catalyst degradation is induced by carbon support corrosion. The most commonly used carbon support is carbon black (e.g., Vulcan\u00ae X72), which has a high specic surface area and many functional groups that can easily\nSchool of Engineering, Osaka University, 1, Japan.

See\n277\nanchor Pt nanoparticles. Unfortunately, carbon black is gradually oxidized and deformed during PEMFC operation, especially during start-up and shut-down.5\u20138 This aggravates Pt detachment and aggregation. sp2-hybridized carbon materials composed of two-dimensional hexagonal carbon planes such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene analogs, e.g., graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), have emerged as promising candidates to replace the widely used carbon black in PEMFC catalysts. These materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their unique physicochemical properties, including excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, high corrosion resistance, and large specic surface area.9,10 The application of corrosion-resistant carbon materials substantially reduces Pt nanoparticle-related carbon oxidation and degradation.5,11\u201313 However, anchoring Pt nanoparticles onto the smooth and chemically inert surface of sp2 carbon materials is difficult. In most cases, the honeycomb sp2 structure is destroyed by the addition of functional groups when immobilizing Pt nanoparticles onto carbon materials14,15 and heteroatoms are embedded into the sp2 structure.16,17 These approaches are accompanied by a high risk of lowering the expected stability of CNTs and GNPs. Wrapping a carbon surface with a polymer, which is categorized as a physical conjunction method, is another approach to xing Pt nanoparticles onto the surface.18,19 We have previously reported a similar concept, but using an ionic liquid (IL) as the binder.20\u201322 In this manner, highly\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The ILs we used were [C4mim][Tf2N] with an unsaturated vemembered ring cation with two heteroatoms and [N1,1,1,3] [Tf2N] with a saturated alkylammonium cation. The loading amounts of Pt and mean particle sizes of the nanoparticles deposited on the samples are summarized in Table 1. Regardless of the preparation conditions, the loading amounts were nearly the same ( 25 wt%), but this was not the case for the mean particle size. For the graphene-nanoplatelets-based carbon supports, when we used the same IL, the Pt nanoparticles modied on GNPs-3 were smaller (2.1 nm for [C4mim] [Tf2N] and 3.3 nm for [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N]) than those on GNPs-20 (2.5 nm for [C4mim][Tf2N] and 3.8 nm for [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N]). According to the product information, the specic surface area of GNPs-20 is 120\u2013150 m2 g 1.32 A similar, at, sheet-like, and ultrathin carbon material, GNPs-3, has a much larger specic surface area of 1243 m2 g 1, which is calculated from the typical H3-type nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm curve of GNPs-3 (Fig. S2a (ESI\u2020)). This higher specic surface area is extremely likely to result in smaller Pt nanoparticles, because GNPs-3 can provide more anchor points for Pt nucleation in the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nPt(II) reduction process. However, the impact of specic surface area on Pt particle size seems to be limited, because the size variation is less than 0.5 nm even though the surface area is nearly 10 times larger. A schematic illustration of this plausible Pt nanoparticle formation mechanism is depicted in Fig. 2a and b. In addition, the geometric shape can affect the size of the nanoparticles. MWCNTs have completely different shapes but are sp2 carbon materials, as are GNPs-3 and GNPs-20. Although the MWCNTs we used in this study had a higher surface area, i.e., 210 m2 g 1 (Fig. S2b (ESI\u2020)), than GNPs-20, the Pt nanoparticles on the MWCNTs were slightly larger (2.7 nm for [C4mim][Tf2N] and 4.3 nm for [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N]) than those on the GNPs-20. This result suggests that MWCNTs have fewer anchor points suitable for Pt nucleation. This may be associated with the curved surface shape of MWCNTs.\nThe difference in the IL species had a more noticeable effect on the Pt particle size in specimens 1\u20136. As summarized in Table 1, the nanoparticles deposited became larger by changing the IL from [C4mim][Tf2N] (specimens 1\u20133) to [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N] (specimens 4\u20136). Nanoparticle growth in [C4mim][Tf2N] was hampered. Similar behavior was also conrmed by Pt nanoparticle preparation using the same IL one-pot pyrolysis method but without carbon supports (Fig. S3 (ESI\u2020)). The mean particle sizes of the Pt nanoparticles we obtained for [C4mim][Tf2N] and [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N] were 3.5 and 6.9 nm, respectively. Because the surface of the Pt nanoparticles prepared in ILs is positively charged, the Pt nanoparticles are considered to be stabilized by anionic supramolecular aggregates, for example, [(organic cation)x(Tf2N)1+x]\n.33 In the present case, the accessibility of Pt metal precursors and/or atoms to the nanoparticle surface was directly controlled by the cationic steric effect.34 Thus, a larger volume cation, [C4mim]\n+, could effectively block further Pt deposition on the nanoparticles. As a result, Pt nucleation was stimulated at other anchor points on the carbon supports, leading to less nanoparticle growth. A plausible process of Pt nanoparticle growth during the IL one-pot pyrolysis method is schematically summarized in Fig. 2c.\nWe collected further information on the carbon structure using Raman spectroscopy for specimens 1\u20136, and the asprepared samples are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI\u2020). Two characteristic peaks, the D band at 1350 cm 1 and G band at 1580 cm 1, are associated with defects or disorders and sp2-bonded carbons, respectively.35 We noted little difference between the Raman spectra before and aer the Pt nanoparticle modication, indicating that the IL one-pot pyrolysis method employed in this research had no effect on the surface structure of the sp2 carbon materials.

These values are lower than those of commercial Pt\u2013C catalysts. The H2 adsorption was highly likely hampered by the IL remaining on the Pt nanoparticle surface.36\u201338 Aer the durability test, we found that the ECSA retention rates for the graphene nanoplatelet-based samples, 1 (51.2%), 2 (47.6%), 4 (26.9%) and 5 (65.2%), were inferior to that of Pt\u2013C (71.1%). Conversely, specimens 3 (75.1%) and 6 (92.8%), prepared using MWCNTs, showed higher retention rates than Pt\u2013C. Considering the larger number of defects or disorders on the MWCNTs, corroborated by the Raman spectra derived from the G-band (Fig. S4 (ESI\u2020)), we deduced that their presence triggered slower nanoparticle aggregation during the durability test, that is, a higher retention rate of ECSA by Pt/MWCNTs.\nTo evaluate the catalytic ability of specimens 1\u20136 toward the ORR, we measured the RDE-LSVs at the GC-RDEs with each specimen in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution\n14272 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 14268\u201314277\nbefore and aer 15 000 potential cycle durability tests (Fig. S5 (ESI\u2020)). Before the durability test, the increase in current ow for O2 reduction initiated at ca. 1.05\u20131.10 V, as observed for commonly used electrocatalysts for the ORR. Koutecky\u0301\u2013Levich plots at 0.85 V were constructed using the RDE-LSVs obtained at speeds of 200\u20131600 rpm. The mass activities of the specimens that we calculated from the Koutecky\u0301\u2013Levich plots and the mean Pt particle sizes before the durability tests are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 4. The mass activity decreased with increasing nanoparticle size. We obtained the highest mass activity, 329.9 A g 1, for specimen 1, which had the smallest mean nanoparticle size of 2.1 nm, corresponding to the size that can obtain more Pt (111) facets.39 As focusing on Pt/GNPs-3 and Pt/GNPs-20, which are at, sheet-like carbon supports, would provide an opportunity to discuss the effect of Pt nanoparticle density on catalytic ability, we prepared two extra GNPs-20based specimens by the same procedure using [N1,1,1,3][Tf2N]\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

In other words, size does not depend on the precursor concentration. However, the Pt loading varied with precursor concentration. From these ndings, we concluded that the number density of Pt nanoparticles on GNPs-20 increases with increasing precursor concentration. The mass\n14274 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 14268\u201314277\nactivities of these three specimens are shown in Fig. 6a as a function of Pt loading. The mass activities increase with increasing Pt loading, but are nonlinear. Because their particle sizes are almost the same, the differences in their mass activities are not dependent on size. This nonlinear behavior should be linked to the number density of the Pt nanoparticles on the GNPs-20. Watanabe et al. reported that the active area territory on the Pt surface is an important factor in attaining higher mass activity.40 As illustrated in Fig. 6b, oxygen accessibility reduced when the Pt nanoparticle number density was too high.\nBased on the RDE-LSVs aer the 15 000-cycle tests (Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI\u2020)), the mass activity data estimated at 0.85 V for specimens 1\u20136 and Pt\u2013C are provided in Table 2. A comparison of all the mass activity data obtained in this study, with the catalytic activity retention rates, is presented in Fig. 7. All the specimens prepared showed a higher mass activity retention rate than Pt\u2013C (49.6%). In particular, specimens 3 and 6, resulting from the MWCNTs, showed a much higher durability. The results of Raman spectroscopy indicated that, as more functional groups exist on MWCNTs than on the other two sp2 carbon materials, MWCNTs would suppress the displacement and aggregation of the Pt nanoparticles. Although the catalyst durability is improved by the IL binding between the Pt nanoparticles and the carbon material surface, the results here provide evidence that the original carbon surface properties also affect durability.\nerent Pt metal precursor (Pt(acac)2) concentrations: (a) 1, (b) 2.5, and (c)\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
