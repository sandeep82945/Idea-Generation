1. Investigate the role of M2 monocytes in the development of cardiovascular disease in psoriatic patients.
2. Examine the relationship between ADAMTS7 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and cardiovascular disease.
3. Explore the potential of using ADAMTS7 and IL-6 as biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.
4. Investigate the effects of mTORC inhibition on monocyte activation and cardiovascular disease in psoriatic patients.
5. Conduct a larger study to confirm the findings of this exploratory study and to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.
