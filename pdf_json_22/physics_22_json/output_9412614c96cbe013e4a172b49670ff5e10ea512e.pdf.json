It consists of adding certain Lagrange parameters to the diagonal of the Fourier transformed coupling matrix analogous to the theory of the general ground state problem already published. This approach is illustrated by an application to a modified honeycomb lattice, which has exclusive three-dimensional ground states as well as a classical spin-liquid ground state for different values of the two coupling constants. Another example, the modified square lattice, shows that we can also obtain so-called incommensurable ground states by our method.",

It consists of adding certain Lagrange parameters to the diagonal of the Fourier transformed coupling matrix analogous to the theory of the general ground state problem already published. This approach is illustrated by an application to a modified honeycomb lattice, which has exclusive three-dimensional ground states as well as a classical spin-liquid ground state for different values of the two coupling constants. Another example, the modified square lattice, shows that we can also obtain so-called incommensurable ground states by our method.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA fundamental property of spin systems including lattices is the set of ground states and the ground state energy per site. The classical limit of these quantities is also of interest and has been studied in numerous papers, of which we will only mention a selection here [1\u201312]. Classical ground states are not only relevant for spin systems with large spin but often define the relevant order parameter in quantum systems. Moreover, they serve as starting point for quantum methods such as the spin wave theory and the coupled cluster method, see, e. g., [13\u201316]. To detect the classical ground state of spin systems can be difficult in presence of frustration, where non-collinear spin orders, incommensurate spiral phases, or massively degenerated ground state manifolds may appear, see, e. g., [17, 18]. An additional challenge appears if the lattice primitive unit cell contains more than one site and/or the exchange couplings extend beyond the nearest-neighbor separation. The theory of classical ground states of spin lattices can be traced back to the seminal paper of J. M. Luttinger and L. Tisza [1] that is, however confined to dipole interaction. The Luttinger-Tisza approach has been generalized to Heisenberg spin systems with general coupling coefficients J\u00b5\u03bd by D. H. Lyons and T. A. Kaplan [2, 8] and can be summarized as follows: The problem of finding the minimum of \u2211 \u00b5\u03bd J\u00b5\u03bds\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u03bd subject to the \u201cstrong constraint\u201d\ns\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u00b5 = 1 for all \u00b5 = 1, . . . ,M can be replaced by the same problem, but with the \u201cweak constraint\u201d \u2211\n\u00b5 s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u00b5 = M , where M denotes the number of spins (see Section IIA for the detailed definitions). The latter problem is solved by finding the minimal eigenvalue of the symmetric J-matrix with entries J\u00b5\u03bd . This eigenvalue problem is simplified by accounting for the invariance of the J-matrix under lattice translation which leads to the consideration of the Fourier\ntransformed J-matrix J\u0302(q). It may happen that the ground state constructed by superpositions of the eigenvectors corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue already satisfies the strong constraint. This will be the case for Bravais lattices, as shown in [2], but may also hold for some non-Bravais lattices. The problem remains to solve the ground state problem in cases where the LTLK theory does not work since the strong constraint cannot be replaced by the weak constraint. Our approach will be based on the \u201cLagrange-variety theory\u201d of classical ground states given in [6, 11, 19\u201323] which is intended to apply to general Heisenberg systems and is not specifically tailored for spin lattices. The basic result of this theory is that the ground states can be constructed by superpositions of the eigenvectors corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue not of the original J-matrix but of the \u201cdressed J-matrix\u201d. The latter is obtained by adding certain Lagrange parameters to the diagonal of the J-matrix. In principle, this approach is already mentioned in [8], but is considered too complicated, since one would have to find a macroscopic number of 1023 or so of Lagrangian parameters. However, as mentioned in [11], the presence of symmetries reduces the number of independent Lagrange parameters. In the case of lattice translation symmetry this means that we only have L \u2212 1 unknown parameters if L is the number of Bravais lattices needed to construct the spin lattice under consideration. This makes it plausible that our approach reduces to the LTLK approach in the case of a Bravais lattice, where L = 1. It is worth mentioning that our approach is able to detect non-coplanar (i.e. 3-dimensional) ground states which may lead to the emergence of scalar chiral orders as discussed for the celebrated highly frustrated kagome magnet, see Refs. [18, 24, 25]. The paper is organized as follows. In Section IIA we recapitulate the general definitions and results that have already appeared in [6, 11, 19\u201323], while the specializations to spin lattices are presented in Section II B. The proofs of two propositions appearing in this Section are moved to the Appendix. For a first illustration, we consider the cyclic sawtooth chain consisting of 6 corner-sharing triangles. The coplanar ground states that can be also obtained\n2 by elementary considerations are shown to result from our approach in the Sections II C and IID. In Section II E it is shown how to obtain a three-dimensional, less elementary ground state. Some remarks on infinite lattices and incommensurable ground states are made in Section II F. The main applications are contained in Section III. After some general remarks in subsection IIIA on other possible cases we concentrate, in subsection III B, on the honeycomb lattice with two different coupling constants written as J1 = sin\u03c6 and J2 = cos\u03c6. where \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0. In the sectors |\u03c6| \u2265 \u03c0/2 and slightly beyond we have one-dimensional ground states that can be understood elementarily. The crucial application is the construction of two different phases of three-dimensional ground states in the sectors |\u03c6| < \u03c0/4 and \u03c0/4 < |\u03c6| < arctan(3) and the corresponding closed formulas for the ground state energy. The energies of all three mentioned phases are shown to be assumed by ground states calculated numerically. Subsection III C contains an example, the modified square lattice, where incommensurable ground states occur. Although this problem is, strictly speaking, beyond the present theory, we will consider an extrapolation of our method that leads to a semi-analytical calculation of the incommensurable ground states that have a lower energy than the ground states of a finite model that can be numerically calculated. In Section IV, we summarize our study in a recipe-like manner and discuss the question of whether this finds all ground states. Throughout this paper we will call spin configurations either \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d (non-coplanar) or \u201ctwodimensional\u201d (coplanar) or \u201cone-dimensional\u201d (collinear, Ising states), depending on the dimension of the linear space spanned by all spin vectors, and avoid the other names given in brackets."

            "text": "We consider a finite system s of M classical spin vectors s\u00b5, \u00b5 \u2208 M, of unit length, i. e., satisfying\ns\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u00b5 = 1 for all \u00b5 \u2208 M . (1)\nIt will be convenient to consider s as an M \u00d7K-matrix consisting of M rows s\u00b5 and K columns s(i). The dimension dim of the spin configuration is defined as the rank of the matrix s and is restricted to dim = 1, 2, 3 for physical cases. The spin system will be called a \u201cspin lattice\u201d if the index set M has the structure\nM = L \u00d7 ZN := L \u00d7 ZN1 \u00d7 . . .\u00d7 ZNd , (2)\nwhere L is a finite set of size |L| = L (\u201cprimitive unit cell\u201d). The finite model will consist of \u220fi=1,...,dNi copies of the primitive unit cell and ZNi denotes the range of integers modulo Ni (cyclic boundary conditions). d is the dimension of the lattice and will be restricted to the physical cases of d = 1, 2, 3. The geometry of the lattice in real space will not play any role here; in particular, the distinction between the 14 Bravais lattices for L = 1 and d = 3 does not matter. This may be different in concrete applications when additional symmetries beyond the translational ones become important. We assume a Heisenberg Hamiltonian of the form\nH(s) = \u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd\u2208M J\u00b5\u03bd s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u03bd , (3)\nwith real coupling coefficients J\u00b5\u03bd satisfying J\u00b5\u03bd = J\u03bd\u00b5 and J\u00b5\u00b5 = 0 for all \u00b5, \u03bd \u2208 M. These coefficients can hence be viewed as the entries of a symmetric M \u00d7M -matrix J. The Hamiltonian (3) does not uniquely determine J: Let \u03bb\u00b5, \u00b5 = 1, . . . ,M be arbitrary real numbers subject to the constraint\nM\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u03bb\u00b5 = 0 , (4)\nand define a new matrix J(\u03bb) with entries\nJ(\u03bb)\u00b5\u03bd := J\u00b5\u03bd + \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u00b5 , (5)\n3 then\nH\u0303(s) :=\nM\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd=1\nJ(\u03bb)\u00b5\u03bd s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u03bd (6)\n(5) =\nM\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd=1\nJ\u00b5\u03bd s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u03bd + M\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u03bb\u00b5 s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u00b5 (7)\n= H(s) , (8)\ndue to (1) and (4). The transformation J\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 J(\u03bb)\u00b5\u03bd according to (5) has been called a \u201cgauge transformation\u201d in [6] according to the close analogy with other branches of physics where this notion is common. Thus, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian does not depend on the gauge. In most problems the simplest gauge would be the \u201czero gauge\u201d, i. e. , setting \u03bb\u00b5 = 0 for \u00b5 = 1, . . . ,M . However, in the present context it is crucial not to remove the gauge freedom by a certain choice of the \u03bb\u00b5 but to retain it. We will hence explicitly stress the dependence of the coupling matrix on the undetermined \u03bb\u00b5 by using the notation J(\u03bb). J(\u03bb) will be called the \u201cdressed J-matrix\u201d and its entries will be, as above, denoted by J(\u03bb)\u00b5\u03bd . The rationale is that we want to trace back the properties of ground states to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of J(\u03bb) and these in a non-trivial way depend on \u03bb. The \u201cundressed\u201dmatrix J without \u03bb will always denote a symmetric M \u00d7M -matrix in the zero gauge. Let \u039b denote the M \u2212 1-dimensional subspace of RM defined by\n\u039b := { \u03bb \u2208 RM \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u03bb\u00b5 = 0\n} (9)\nAs coordinates in \u039b we will use the first M \u2212 1 components \u03bbi, i = 1, . . . ,M since the M -th component can be expressed by the others via \u03bbM = \u2212 \u2211M\u22121 i=1 \u03bbi.\nLet us, for arbitrary \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, denote by min(\u03bb) the lowest eigenvalue of the real, symmetric matrix J(\u03bb). Then by the Ritz-Rayleigh variational priciple\nH(s) (6\u22128) =\nM\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd=1\nJ(\u03bb)\u00b5\u03bd s\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u03bd (10)\n\u2265 min(\u03bb) M\u2211\n\u00b5=1\ns\u00b5 \u00b7 s\u00b5 (11)\n(1) = M min(\u03bb) . (12)\nThis holds also for ground states s\u0302 such that H(s\u0302) = Emin. Hence for arbitrary \u03bb \u2208 \u039b we obtain the upper bound\nmin(\u03bb) \u2264 1\nM Emin , (13)\nthat will play a role in the definition of the critical point in (18). The inequality (13) holds for all gauges (\u03bb), especially for (\u03bb) = 0. The latter will be called the \u201cLuttinger-Tizsa lower bound\u201d to the minimal energy (per spin site). In the present paper a special gauge will become important that we will call the \u201cground state gauge\u201d. It is well-known that a smooth function of a finite number of variables has a vanishing gradient at those points where it assumes its (local or global) minimum. If the definition domain of the function is constrained, as in our case of the function s \u2192 H(s), its gradient no longer vanishes at the minima but will only be perpendicular to the \u201cconstraint manifold\u201d. The resulting equation reads, in our case,\nM\u2211\n\u03bd=1\nJ\u00b5\u03bds\u03bd = \u2212\u03ba\u00b5 s\u00b5, \u00b5 = 1, . . . ,M . (14)\nHere the \u03ba\u00b5 are the Lagrange parameters due to the constraints (1). This equation is only necessary but not sufficient for s being a ground state. If it is satisfied we call the corresponding state a \u201dstationary state\u201d and will refer to (14) as the \u201cstationary state equation\u201d (SSE). This wording of course reflects the fact that exactly the stationary states will not move according to the equation of motion for classical spin systems, see, e. g., [6], but we will not dwell upon\n4 this here. All ground states are stationary states but there are stationary states that are not ground states. Let us rewrite (14) in the following way:\nM\u2211\n\u03bd=1\nJ\u00b5\u03bds\u03bd = (\u03ba\u0304\u2212 \u03ba\u00b5) s\u00b5 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304 s\u00b5 = \u2212\u03bb\u00b5 s\u00b5 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304 s\u00b5 , (15)\nwhere we have introduced the mean value of the Lagrange parameters\n\u03ba\u0304 := 1\nM\nM\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u03ba\u00b5 , (16)\nand the deviations from the mean value\n\u03bb\u00b5 := \u03ba\u00b5 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304, \u00b5 = 1, . . . ,M . (17)\nWe denote by \u039b0 \u2282 \u039b the set of vectors \u03bb with components (17) resulting from (14) in the case of a ground state s\u0302 with unrestricted dimension K. It has been proven [11] that \u039b0 consists of a single point \u039b0 = {\u03bb\u0302} where the upper bound (13) is assumed:\nmin(\u03bb\u0302) = 1\nM Emin . (18)\nWe will refer to this point as the \u201ccritical point\u201d of the function \u03bb 7\u2192 min(\u03bb). \u03bb = \u03bb\u0302 will be called a \u201cground state gauge\u201d. It can be used for a gauge transformation J\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 J(\u03bb\u0302)\u00b5\u03bd which renders (15) in the form of an eigenvalue equation:\nM\u2211\n\u03bd=1\nJ(\u03bb\u0302)\u00b5\u03bd s\u0302\u03bd = \u2212\u03ba\u0304 s\u0302\u00b5 (19)\n= min(\u03bb\u0302) s\u0302\u00b5 , (20)\nwhere the identification min(\u03bb\u0302) = \u2212\u03ba\u0304 follows from (18). This equation can be written in matrix form if we recall that s\u0302 can be viewed as a matrix consisting of M rows s\u0302\u00b5 and K columns:\nJ(\u03bb\u0302) s\u0302 = min(\u03bb\u0302) s\u0302 . (21)\nThis means that each column s\u0302(i), i = 1, . . . ,K, of the matrix s\u0302 will be an eigenvector of J(\u03bb\u0302) corresponding to the\neigenvalue min(\u03bb\u0302). Summarizing the theory developed so far, we can find the ground state spin configuration s\u0302 as a suitable superpo-\nsition of eigenvectors corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue min(\u03bb\u0302) of the dressed J-matrix J(\u03bb) at the critical point \u03bb\u0302.\nWe emphasize that while the critical point \u03bb\u0302 is unique, the ground-state spin configuration s\u0302 is not. Besides the \u201ctrivial\u201d degeneracy due to rotations or reflections, there may be other \u201cadditional\u201d degeneracies. Recall that the dimension of the ground state was left open. Therefore, it is even possible that different ground states have different dimensions. In this case, the minimal dimension of the set of ground states is an important quantity. In [11] an example is given for a system with N = 10 spins, where the minimal dimension of the set of ground states is 4 with ground state energy Emin = \u221260. In such a situation, one would have to search for physical states, i.e., with maximal dimension 3, which realize the minimum energy Ephysmin under the dimensional constraint, which is E phys min = \u221259.1728 in the mentioned example. The present theory is not particularly suitable to solve this problem."

            "text": "The preceding considerations are quite general and do not use the lattice structure. We will now consider this and write the indices \u00b5 \u2208 M as \u00b5 = (i,n) where i \u2208 L and n \u2208 ZN. In the language of solid-state physics the (multi)indices n and m label unit cells and i and j sites in a unit cell. The coupling coefficients are correspondingly written in the form J\u00b5\u03bd = J ij nm such that the symmetry requirement reads\nJ ijnm = J ji mn , (22)\n5 for all i, j \u2208 L and n,m \u2208 ZN. The crucial assumption throughout this paper is the invariance of the coupling under lattice translations:\nJ ijn+a,m+a = J ij m,n , (23)\nfor all a \u2208 ZN, where the addition n + a is understood modulo Ni for the i\u2212th component of the d-dimensional vector n+ a.\nAs a simple standard example we consider the \u201ccyclic sawtooth chain\u201d, see Figure 1, left panel, consisting of M = 12 spin sites arranged at L = 2 concentric hexagons. This is a d = 1 dimensional lattice with index set Z6. There are three different couplings J1, J2 and J3 between adjacent sites that are, according to (23), invariant under lattice translations, i. e., under 60\u25e6 rotations.\nIt has been shown [11] that the ground state gauge \u03bb\u0302 has the same symmetries as the undressed J-matrix. In our case this means that \u03bb\u0302i,n only depends on i \u2208 L and thus, slightly changing the notation, the dressed J-matrix assumes the form\nJ ij nm(\u03bb\u0302) = J ij nm + \u03bb\u0302i \u03b4ij , (24)\nagain satisfying\nL\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u0302i = 0 . (25)\nThe eigenvalue equation (20) following from the SSE (14) then assumes the form\n\u2211\njm\nJ ij nm(\u03bb\u0302) s\u0302jm = min(\u03bb\u0302) s\u0302in . (26)\nAs mentioned above the ground state gauge \u03bb\u0302 is uniquely determined as the point where the function \u03bb 7\u2192 min(\u03bb) assumes a global maximum. For large systems it will be difficult to calculate this ground state gauge and the\ncorresponding eigenvalue min(\u03bb\u0302) directly, either analytically or numerically, since this implies the repeated calculation of the lowest eigenvalue of the large matrix J(\u03bb). In this situation, one can hope to split J(\u03bb) into smaller blocks by exploiting its symmetry. In fact, J(\u03bb) commutes with the lattice translation operators Ta, a \u2208 ZN and hence both operators possess a common system of eigenvectors. The eigenvectors of Ta form the discrete Fourier basis exp(in \u00b7q). Hence we seek for eigenvectors t of J(\u03bb\u0302) of the product form\ntin = zi e in\u00b7q , (27)\nwhere the zi are the components of a vector z \u2208 CL and the \u201cwave vector\u201d q, runs through the finite \u201cBrillouin set\u201d Q defined by\nQ := { (q1, . . . , qd) |\nqi = 2\u03c0ki Ni\nand ki \u2208 ZNi for all i = 1, . . . , d } ,\n(28)\nforming coordinates for certain points of the first Brillouin zone. Inserting the ansatz (27) into (26) gives\n\u2211\njm\nJ ij n,m(\u03bb\u0302) zj e\nim\u00b7q\n(23) =\n\u2211\njm\nJ ij 0,m\u2212n(\u03bb\u0302) zj e i (m\u2212n)\u00b7q e in\u00b7q (29)\n= \u2211\nj\n( \u2211\n\u2113\nJ ij 0,\u2113(\u03bb\u0302) e i \u2113\u00b7q\n)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 zj e\nin\u00b7q (30)\n= \u2211\nj\nJ\u0302 ij(\u03bb\u0302,q) zj e in\u00b7q , (31)\n6 introducing the discrete Fourier-transformed J-matrix\nJ\u0302 ij(\u03bb,q) := \u2211\n\u2113\nJ ij 0,\u2113(\u03bb) e i \u2113\u00b7q . (32)\nHence (27) will be an eigenvector of J(\u03bb\u0302) if z is chosen as an eigenvector of J\u0302(\u03bb\u0302,q), i. e.,\n\u2211\nj\nJ\u0302 ij(\u03bb\u0302,q) zj = (\u03bb\u0302,q) zi , (33)\nfor all i = 1, . . . , L. In this context the following Proposition will be of interest:\nProposition 1 Under the preceding conditions the following holds for all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and q \u2208 Q:\n1. J\u0302(\u03bb,q) is an Hermitean L\u00d7 L-matrix.\n2. J\u0302(\u03bb,q) = J\u0302\u22a4(\u03bb,\u2212q), where \u22a4 denotes the transposition of a matrix.\n3. J\u0302(\u03bb,q) and J\u0302(\u03bb,\u2212q) have the same eigenvalues and complex-conjugate eigenvectors.\nThe proof of this Proposition can be found in the Appendix A1.\nThe advantage of considering the Fourier transform J\u0302(\u03bb,q) for the calculation of the maximum of \u03bb 7\u2192 min(\u03bb) is that we do not need to diagonalize an M \u00d7 M -matrix but only an L \u00d7 L-matrix, albeit for different values of q. Since typically the number of spin sites L in the unit cell is small, the diagonalization of the matrix J\u0302(\u03bb,q) is straightforward, sometimes it is even analytically possible. Let us reformulate the condition for the ground state\ngauge \u03bb\u0302 in this setting. Denote by min(\u03bb,q) the minimal eigenvalue of J\u0302(\u03bb,q), then the ground state gauge \u03bb\u0302 will be uniquely determined by the condition (\u201cMax-Min-Principle\u201d)\nmin(\u03bb\u0302) = Max\u03bb\u2208\u039bMinq\u2208Q min(\u03bb,q) . (34)\nIn the special case of a Bravais lattice, i. e., L = |L| = 1, the matrix J\u0302(\u03bb,q) reduces to a real number and necessarily \u03bb = 0 due to (25). The minimal energy (per site) is obtained by the minimum of J\u0302(0,q) over q \u2208 Q. The corresponding ground state is the two-dimensional spiral state given by the real and imaginary part of the Fourier basis exp (in \u00b7 q). In this way, we recover the LTLK-solution of the ground state problem for Bravais spin lattices, see [2, 8]. Returning to general spin lattices we consider the case of three-dimensional ground states in some detail, the other two cases being analogous but simpler. We thus assume that we have found three linearly independent eigenvectors z(k), k = 1, 2, 3, of J\u0302(\u03bb,q(k)), resp. , that will be used to form the three columns of a real matrix W , hence satisfying either\nWi,k = z (k) i , for i = 1, . . . , L . (35)\nif z(k) is real, or\nWi,k = \u211c ( z (k) i ) , for i = 1, . . . , L (36)\nWi,k+1 = \u2111 ( z (k) i ) , for i = 1, . . . , L , (37)\nif z(k) is complex. In the latter case we use the convention q(k+1) = \u2212q(k) and rely on Proposition 1.3. We will consider linear combinations of these eigenvectors that give rise to ground state spin configurations in the primitive unit cell of the form s = W \u0393, where \u0393 is a real 3 \u00d7 3-matrix representing the coefficients of the linear combinations. The linear combination represented by \u0393 will be called admissible iff \u0393k,\u2113 = 0 holds in case of q\n(k) 6= q(\u2113). In other words: Admissible linear combinations do not mix eigenvectors with different q-vectors and also do not mix the real and imaginary part of a complex eigenvector. Then we have the following result:\nProposition 2 If there exists an admissible linear combination \u0393 that yields a ground state configuration (si,0)i\u2208L of three-dimensional unit vectors in the primitive unit cell then it can be extended to a total ground state spin configuration (si,n)i\u2208L,n\u2208ZN that will also consist of unit vectors.\nThe proof of this Proposition and the detailed form of the extension can be found in Appendix A2. We will illustrate our approach for the above example of cyclic sawtooth chain simplified to J1 = J2 = J3 = 1, see Figure 1, left panel, although this system is already rather small with M = 12. The Fourier transform J\u0302(\u03bb, q) assumes the form\nJ\u0302(\u03bb, q) =\n( \u03bb+ e\u2212iq + eiq 1 + e\u2212iq\n1 + eiq \u2212\u03bb\n) . (38)\nWe mention that we may choose a large value for M , the total number of spins, which would not change the matrix (38) but only increase the number of q-values to be considered. We have plotted the four functions \u03bb 7\u2192 min(\u03bb, q) corresponding to q = 0,\u00b1\u03c03 ,\u00b1 2\u03c03 , \u03c0, see Figure 1, right panel, where the two signs of, say, \u00b1\u03c03 yield the same function min(\u03bb, q) according to Proposition 1. We see that min(\u03bb) which is the minimum of these four functions has a unique maximum at \u03bb\u0302 = 1/2 of the height min(1/2) = \u22123/2, in accordance with (34). This corresponds to the ground state energy of Emin = M min(1/2) = \u221218 that can be realized by any spin configuration with an angle of 120\u25e6 between adjacent spins, see below. Moreover, we observe that the function \u03bb 7\u2192 min(\u03bb,\u00b1 2\u03c03 ) (green curve in Figure 1, right panel) has a smooth maximum at the critical point. This gives rise to a special two-dimensional ground state as we will explain for the general case in the following subsection."

Let us write zi = xi + iyi for i = 1, . . . , L and rescale z such that\n|zi|2 = x2i + y2i = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , L .

There is a second two-dimensional ground state where the spins in the inner hexagon point alternately in two different directions, which are represented by the colors red and green in Figure 2, middle panel, while the outer spins constantly point in the third direction, which is represented by the color blue.

Another possibility to construct real twodimensional ground states would be a suitable superposition of two real eigenvectors t(1) and t(2).

The components of the ground state are obtained as linear combinations of these eigenvectors.

Infinite lattices and incommensurable ground states\nOur theory as outlined in the preceding Sections IIA - II E is, in principle, restricted to finite models of an infinite lattice.

Such ground states have been called \u201cincommensurable\u201d in the literature, see, e. g., [7, 31]. Although they are, strictly speaking, beyond the present theory, there is a chance to obtain incommensurable states by an extrapolation of the Max-Min-Principle (34) to\nmin(\u03bb\u0302) = Max\u03bb\u2208\u039bMinq\u2208Q\u221e min(\u03bb,q) , (67)\nwhere the finite Brillouin set Q has been extended to the infinite one:\nQ\u221e := [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]d .

            "text": "Having presented a generalization of the LTLK approach, it is natural to look for applications where our approach provides ground states that cannot be obtained with LTLK theory, beyond the toy example of the cyclic sawtooth chain. In doing so, we must take into account the fact that the LTLK theory can fail for various reasons. One reason is the presence of non-equivalent spins in a non-Bravais lattice as in the cyclic sawtooth chain. Another possible problem could be that LTLK theory provides all the mathematical ground states, but they might be unphysical because their dimension is larger than three. We have already mentioned this problem at the end of Section IIA. We would like to add here only the remark that ground states with minimal dimension > 3 can occur also in spin lattices, even quite often, and are a problem for our theory as well as for LTLK theory. An example is the J1\u2212J3\u2212 kagome lattice, where the Luttinger-Tizsa lower bound is reached everywhere except in a small \u201dgray\u201d region, see Fig. 2 in [12]. We have studied this example and found that the ground state which assumes the mentioned lower bound is 6-dimensional. However, as we have already mentioned, our approach is not tailored to find physical, i. e., at most 3-dimensional, ground states when the mathematical ground states are K-dimensional with K > 3, as in this example. A similar situation occurs for the J1\u2212J3\u2212 pyrochlore lattice which can be considered as a 3-dimensional analogue of the kagome lattice. A numerical study of the pyrochlore ground states with nearest and next-nearest neighbor coupling has been given in [9]. There is a second class of applications with non-equivalent spins in the primitive unit cell of a non-Bravais lattice, where our approach yields all symmetric ground states, but these could also be obtained by elementary reasoning. As an example we mention a square-kagome lattice that has two non-equivalent sites as well as two different NN bonds J1, J2 [30]. It is a system of corner-sharing triangles. Each triangle has its known two-dimensional ground state, and these ground states can be composed into the global ground state with the local states more or less free to rotate, see [30]. Therefore, examples of this type would not illustrate the power of our method. We finally found two examples where the mentioned drawbacks do not occur: First, the J1\u2212J2\u2212honeycomb lattice, Section III B. While there are one-dimensional ground states of elementary type here as well, the construction of the remaining 3-dimensional ground states can be seen as a successful application of our theory. Second, in Sec. III C we consider a modified square lattice with different ground state phases, including incommensurable ones. Both examples have not been considered before in the literature and are deliberately chosen for our purposes."

            "text": "We consider the J1 \u2212 J2\u2212honeycomb lattice that can be generated by two spin sites with coordinates, say, (0, 0) and (1, 0), in the primitive unit cell and integer multiples of translations into the directions e1 = ( 3 2 , \u221a 3 2 ) and e2 = ( 3 2 ,\u2212 \u221a 3 2 ) , see Figure 3, left panel. We will denote the translates of (0, 0) as \u201ceven sites\u201d and those of (1, 0) as \u201codd sites\u201d. Since the second neighbor bond J2 connects only even sites the spins in the unit cell become nonequivalent. The even sites form a triangular lattice with coupling constant J2 between adjacent sites. Every second\n12\ntriangle of this lattice is occupied by an odd spin that is coupled with strength J1 to its three adjacent even spins, see Figure 3, left panel. Since the ground states do not depend on a common positive factor of J1 and J2 we may set\nJ1 = sin\u03c6 and J2 = cos\u03c6, \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0 , (69)\nwithout loss of generality. From this it already follows that the simultaneous replacements J1 7\u2192 \u2212J1 and inversion of all even spins leave the total energy (per site) invariant. Hence the energy of the ground states Emin(\u03c6) will be an even function of \u03c6. The following calculations refer to a finite model of the d = 2-dimensional honeycomb lattice of the kind (2) with a unit cell L = {0, 1} containing L = |L| = 2 sites and N1 \u00d7N2 = 6\u00d7 6 = 36 copies of the unit cell. At first sight, the finite Brioullin set Q would contain N1 \u00d7N2 = 36 elements, but due to min(q) = min(\u2212q) this set can be reduced to 20 elements. The 2\u00d7 2-matrix J\u0302(q, \u03bb) is readily calculated as\nJ\u0302(q, \u03bb) = ( J11 J12 J21 J22 ) , (70)\nwhere\nJ11 = 2 cos\u03c6(cos(q1 \u2212 q2) + cos q1 + cos q2) + \u03bb (71) J12 = J21 = sin\u03c6 ( e \u2212iq1 + e\u2212iq2 + 1 ) (72) J22 = \u2212\u03bb . (73)\nWe see that J\u0302(q, \u03bb) is invariant under the reflection q1 \u2194 q2. The ground states will be ferromagnetic at least for J1, J2 < 0, i. e., for the interval \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 < \u2212\u03c0/2. This constitutes the ferromagnetic phase I. According to the above remarks there exists an analogous one-dimensional ground state phase (phase I\u2217) for the interval \u03c0/2 < \u03c6 < \u03c0 that is obtained by inverting all even spins of the ferromagnetic ground state and hence represents an anti-ferromagnetic Ne\u0301el state. The corresponding ground state energy will be\nE (\u00b1) min = 3 (cos\u03c6\u00b1 sin\u03c6) , (74)\nwhere the sign \u00b1 has to be chosen positive for the interval \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 < \u2212\u03c0/2 and negative for \u03c0/2 < \u03c6 < \u03c0. Both types of \u201done-dimensional phases\u201d are shown in light green in different gradations in Figure 5.\n13\nThese ground states can also be obtained as follows. The lowest eigenvalue of J\u0302(0, \u03bb) has a global smooth maximum at \u03bb = \u03bb\u0302 = \u22123 cos\u03c6 with maximal value (74). The corresponding eigenvectors are (\u00b11, 1) and its components are of absolute value 1 in accordance with the considerations in subsection II C. These eigenvectors yield the one-dimensional ground states via (33). Next, we will follow the steps of analytically obtaining the ground states of two other phases that prevail for the remaining values of \u03c6. First, we choose a small value of \u03c6, say, \u03c6 = 0.1 and numerically calculate the maximum w. r. t. \u03bb of the minima of the eigenvalues of J(q, \u03bb), q \u2208 Q. This maximum has the value Emin = \u22121.49751 and is obtained for \u03bb\u0302 = 1.4875. Next we ask for which q \u2208 Q this maximum is obtained. The somewhat surprising answer is: for all q \u2208 Q. At first sight, this seems unfavorable since it means that, in principle, we would have to construct the ground state as a superposition of |Q| = 20 eigenvectors. Fortunately, it is possible to find two values of q \u2208 Q that already suffice to construct the ground states, namely qa = (0, \u03c0) and qb = ( 2\u03c0 3 ,\u2212 2\u03c03 ).\nAs an aside, we add that the above degeneracy of Emin is not due to the choice of a finite Q: it holds in general that Emin is independent of q and thus represents a \u201cflat band\u201d. We have thus found a new facet of the interesting field of flat-band physics that has emerged in the last few decades, see, e. g., [26\u201329, 32].\nComing back to our problem we note that the condition that two suitable eigenvalues of J\u0302(qa, \u03bb) and J\u0302(qb, \u03bb)\ncoincide at the global maximum leads to an analytically determination of \u03bb\u0302 as\n\u03bb\u0302 = 2 cos\u03c6\u2212 sec\u03c6 2 , (75)\nand the corresponding energy\nE (1) min = \u2212 cos\u03c6\u2212\n1 2 sec\u03c6 . (76)\nThe eigenvector of J\u0302 ( qa, \u03bb\u0302 ) corresponding to the eigenvalues (76) will be a = (a0, a1) = (\u2212 tan\u03c6, 1). J\u0302 ( qb, \u03bb\u0302 )\nhappens to be already diagonal and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue (76) will be b = (b0, b1) = (1, 0).\n14\nFor simplicity, we will use complex multiples of b to represent the components of spin vectors in the x \u2212 y\u2212plane. Then it is straightforward to write the ground state configuration as the following superposition of a ein\u00b7qa and b ein\u00b7qb:\ns(0, n1, n2) = (\u221a 1\u2212 tan2 \u03c6 b0 ein\u00b7qb , a0 ein\u00b7qa ) (77)\n= (\u221a 1\u2212 tan2 \u03c6ei (n1\u2212n2) 2\u03c03 ,\u2212 tan\u03c6ein2\u03c0 )\n(78)\ns(1, n1, n2) = (\u221a 1\u2212 tan2 \u03c6 b1 ein\u00b7qb , a1 ein\u00b7qa ) (79)\n= ( 0, ein2 \u03c0 ) , (80)\ntaking into account that ein2 \u03c0 = (\u22121)n2 is real. There occur only 8 different spin vectors, see Figure 4, left panel. From the explicit form of the ground state configuration (77-80), it is evident that \u03c6must be restricted to \u2212\u03c0/4 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/4 to make \u221a 1\u2212 tan2 \u03c6 real. These ground states constitute the phases III and III\u2217 for \u2212\u03c0/4 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 0 and 0 < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/4, respectively. Our investigations indicate that these phases are \u201cexclusively three-dimensional\u201d, i. e., that no further two- or one-dimensional ground states exist.\nOn the other hand, the minimal energy function E (1) min(\u03c6) according to (76) seems to hold for the larger interval \u2212 arctan3 < \u03c6 < arctan 3, see Figure 5. Thus, the task remains to find ground states for \u03c0/4 < |\u03c6| < arctan3 that realize the minimal energy (76) and constitute the phases II and II\u2217. It turns out that there is a large degeneracy of ground states for the II and II\u2217 phases including two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional states, which would suggest calling these phases \u201cclassical spin liquids\u201d. We may expect that thermal or quantum fluctuations will select the two-dimensional states (\u201corder from disorder\u201d) [33\u201335]. The mentioned degeneracy can be visualized in Figure 3, right panel, where we have chosen \u03c6 = 1.1, a Brillouin set Q with |Q| = 85 corresponding to N1 = N2 = 12 and plotted various functions min(\u03bb,q) for q \u2208 Q. All functions meet at the critical point with coordinates (\u03bb\u0302, min(\u03bb\u0302)). Physical ground states can be constructed by linear combinations of two eigenvectors corresponding to min(\u03bb\u0302,q \u2032 a) and min(\u03bb\u0302,q \u2032 b), respectively, such that min(\u03bb,q \u2032 a) increases with \u03bb and min(\u03bb,q \u2032 b) decreases, or vice versa. These ground states are, at most, two-dimensional if both eigenvectors are real and three-dimensional if one is real and one complex. Note that \u03bb\u0302 has always the same value as in (75).\nThe latter case can be realized by choosing the example q\u2032a = (0, 0) and q \u2032 b = ( \u2212\u03c0, \u03c03 ) The eigenvectors of J\u0302 ( q\u2032a, \u03bb\u0302 )\nand J\u0302 ( q\u2032b, \u03bb\u0302 ) corresponding to the eigenvalue (76) will be\na\u2032 = (a\u20320, a \u2032 1) =\n( \u2212 tan\u03c6\n3 , 1\n) , (81)\nand\nb\u2032 = (b\u20320, b \u2032 1) =\n( (\u22121)2/3 tan\u03c6, 1 ) . (82)\nAgain, it is straightforward to write the ground state configuration as the following superposition of a\u2032 ein\u00b7q \u2032\na and b\u2032 ein\u00b7q \u2032 b :\n\u03b3\u2032a := 3\n2\n\u221a 1\u2212 csc 2(\u03c6)\n2 , (83)\n\u03b3\u2032b := 1\n2\n\u221a 9 csc2(\u03c6)\n2 \u2212 5 , (84)\ns\u2032(0, n1, n2) = ( \u03b3\u2032b b \u2032 0 e in\u00b7q\u2032 b, \u03b3\u2032a a \u2032 0 e in\u00b7q\u2032 a ) (85)\n= ( \u03b3\u2032b (\u22121)2/3 tan\u03c6 ei (\u2212n1+ n2 3 )\u03c0,\u2212\u03b3\u2032a tan\u03c6\n3\n)\n(86)\ns\u2032(1, n1, n2) = ( \u03b3\u2032b b \u2032 1 e in\u00b7q\u2032 b, \u03b3\u2032a a \u2032 1 e in\u00b7q\u2032 a ) (87)\n= ( \u03b3\u2032b e i (\u2212n1+n23 )\u03c0, \u03b3\u2032a ) . (88)\n15\nThe 12 spin vectors occurring in the ground state s\u2032 for the choice \u03c6 = \u03c0/3 are shown in Figure 4, textcolorredright panel. The restriction \u03c0/4 \u2264 |\u03c6| \u2264 arctan 3 is necessary to guarantee that \u03b3\u2032a and \u03b3\u2032b will be real. The case of two-dimensional ground states can be treated by choosing q\u2032a = (0, 0) and q \u2032 b = (\u03c0, 0). The corresponding\neigenvectors read u = ( \u2212 tan(\u03c6)3 , 1 ) and v = (\u2212 tan(\u03c6), 1). The procedure analogous to that sketched in Section IID leads to a Gram matrix G = W \u2206W\u22a4 of the ground state where W = (u, v) and \u2206 is the diagonal 2\u00d7 2-matrix\n\u2206 =\n( 9 8 ( 1\u2212 cot2(\u03c6) ) 0\n0 18 ( 9 cot2(\u03c6)\u2212 1\n) ) . (89)\n\u2206 will be a positively definite matrix for \u03c04 < \u03c6 < arctan(3) and gives rise to the two-dimensional ground state with values\n(s0, s1) = (\u221a \u22061,1 u, \u221a \u22062,2 v )\u22a4 (90)\nin the primitive unit cell. This completes the discussion of the spin liquid phases II and II\u2217. For those readers who prefer a description of the phase boundaries in terms of the quotient J2/J1 = cot\u03c6 we have provided a Table I for the case of J1 > 0, i. e., anti-ferromagnetic NN coupling. It remains to investigate the ground states for special values of \u03c6, for example at the phase boundaries. First we note that for \u03c6 = 0, i. e., J1 = 0 and J2 = 1 we have a triangular lattice formed of even spins. Its ground states with minimal energy \u22123/2 according to (76) are the unique extensions of the well-known local two-dimensional ground state with angle of 120\u25e6 between adjacent spins, whereas the odd spins are completely arbitrary. At the analogous value of \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, i. e., J1 = 1 and J2 = 0 we have a honeycomb lattice with an anti-ferromagnetic NN interaction and the ground state is one-dimensional with opposite spin directions for even and odd spins in accordance with the one-dimensional phase I\u2217 described above. For the special value of \u03c6 = \u03c0/4 the two interactions are equal, J1 = J2 = 1, and we have the phase transition between ground states of phase II\n\u2217 and III\u2217. At this point we encounter two-dimensional and one-dimensional ground states that result from the limits of (77-80) and (85-88) for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0/2. Especially, the one-dimensional ground state reads s(k, n1, n2) = (\u22121)n2+k+1. Moreover, at the value \u03c6 = arctan(3) we have \u03b3\u2032b = 0 in (85-88) and the phase transition between ground states of phase II\n\u2217 and I\u2217 occurs. Finally, we consider the special case \u03c6 = \u03c0/3 where the minimal energy of ground states of phase II\u2217 assumes the lower Luttinger-Tisza bound, see Figure 5. This can be explained by the occurrence of another two-dimensional spiral ground state corresponding to the eigenvector (i, 1) of J\u0302(q1 = q2 = 2\u03c0/3, \u03bb = 0) with eigenvalue \u22123/2."

            "heading": "C. Modified square lattice",
            "text": "This example is a modified version of [31], where incommensurable ground states were determined analytically. The modification consists of additional diagonal bonds that create two non-equivalent spin sites with coordinates, say, s0 = (0, 0), s1 = (1, 0), in the primitive unit cell, see Figure 6, left panel, and which thus require a generalization of LTLK theory. The lattice is obtained by multiples of translations of s0 and s1 with translation vectors e1 = (1, 1) and e2 = (1,\u22121), see Figure 6, left panel. Analogously to Section III B we write the two coupling constants as J1 = cos\u03c6 and J2 = sin\u03c6 where \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0. The 2\u00d7 2-matrix J\u0302(q, \u03bb) assumes the form (70) with\nJ11 = 2 cos q1 cos\u03c6+ \u03bb (91) J12 = J21 = sin\u03c6 + ( e \u2212iq1 + e\u2212iq2 + e\u2212i(q1+q2) ) cos\u03c6\n(92)\nJ22 = \u2212\u03bb . (93)\n16\nLet p(q, \u03bb; z) denote the characteristic polynomial of J\u0302(q, \u03bb) in the variable z. It turns out that the maximum in (67) is always smooth. The corresponding condition \u2202p(q,\u03bb;z)\u2202\u03bb = 0 leads to\n\u03bb\u0302 = \u2212 cos q1 cos\u03c6 . (94)\nIn the sector \u2212\u03c0 < \u03c6 < \u2212\u03c0/2 both coupling constants are negative and the ground state is ferromagnetic, i. e., all spins have the same direction. We will see later that this ferromagnetic phase (I) can be extended slightly beyond \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0. Obviously, the corresponding wave vector is q = (0, 0). The two eigenvectors of J\u0302(0, 0, \u03bb\u0302) are obtained as (1, 1) and (1,\u22121), the first one belonging to the ferromagnetic phase and the second one giving rise to another\n17\none-dimensional phase (II) with q = (0, 0) and the two spins in the primitive unit cell being anti-parallel, symbolized by \u2191\u2193 (Ne\u0301el state). The corresponding minimal energies are obtained as\nE (I) min = 4 cos\u03c6+ sin\u03c6 , (95) E (II) min = \u22122 cos\u03c6\u2212 sin\u03c6 . (96)\nA third one-dimensional phase (III) is obtained by setting q = (0, \u03c0). It is also of the form \u2191\u2193 in the primitive unit cell and has the minimal energy\nE (III) min = cos\u03c6\u2212 sin\u03c6 . (97)\nThe exact \u03c6-domain of these one-dimensional phases will be determined later. It turns out that the remaining ground states will be incommensurable. Partial analytical treatment is possible.\n18\nThe minimum of min(q, \u03bb\u0302) will be obtained at points q \u2208 Q\u221e satisfying\np1 := \u2202p(q, \u03bb\u0302; z)\n\u2202q1 = 0 (98)\np2 := \u2202p(q, \u03bb\u0302; z)\n\u2202q2 = 0 . (99)\np2 is independent of z and (99) can be solved for \u03c6 with the relatively simple result\n\u03c6 = P2(q) := \u03bd \u03c0 + arctan\n( sin ( q1 2 \u2212 q2 )\nsin ( q1 2 + q2\n) ) , (100)\nwhere the integer \u03bd \u2208 Z corresponding to the branch of arctan has to chosen appropriately. On the other hand, p1 is linear in z and (98) can be solved for z. The result can be inserted into p(q, \u03bb\u0302; z) and yields a function p3(\u03c6,q) that vanishes for ground states. The condition p3(\u03c6,q) = 0 can also be solved for \u03c6, albeit with a more complicated result. It reads\n\u03c6 = P1(q) := 1\n2\n( arctan ( bc\u2213 a \u221a a2 + b2 \u2212 c2\nac\u00b1 b \u221a a2 + b2 \u2212 c2\n) + \u03bd\u03c0 ) , (101)\nwhere the sign \u00b1 and \u03bd \u2208 Z have to chosen appropriately and\na := \u22124 ( \u2212 sin ( q1 \u2212\n3q2 2\n) + sin ( 2q1 \u2212\nq2 2\n) + 2 sin ( q1 +\nq2 2\n)\n+sin (q2 2 ) + sin ( q1 + 3q2 2 )) cos (q2 2 ) csc (q1) (102)\nb := \u22124 (cos (q1)\u2212 cos (q2) (cos (q2) + 1) + cos (q1 + q2) + sin2 (q2) cot 2 (q1)\u2212 1 )\n(103)\nc := \u22122\u2212 4 cos (q1 \u2212 q2) + 4 cos (q2) + 2 cot2 (q1)\u2212 cot (q1) csc (q1) + (cos (3q1)\u2212 2 cos (2q1) cos (2q2)) csc2 (q1) . (104)\nThen the equation\nP1(q) = P2(q) (105)\ndescribes a curve in Q\u221e such that certain branches of it correspond to two families of incommensurable ground states, denoted by phase IV and V , see Figure 6, right panel. These branches are determined by numerically solving p2 = p3 = 0 in the vicinity of finite model solutions. It is difficult to confirm it by direct calculation, but we conjecture that the branch corresponding to phase IV has an endpoint A with coordinates\nq (A) 1 = \u03c0 \u2212 arccos\n( 7\n8\n) , q\n(A) 2 =\n1\n2\n( \u03c0 + arccos ( 7\n8\n)) , (106)\nsee Figure 6, right upper panel. Together with the starting point of this branch at q = (0, 0) with vanishing slope this implies, according to (100), that the phase IV ranges from \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/2 to \u03c6 = \u03c0/4. Similarly, we conjecture that the branch belonging to phase V has the tangents q2 = 2 q1 and q2 = \u03c0\u2212 q1 at q1 = 0, see Figure 6, right lower panel. In view of (100) this would imply that the incommensurable ground states of phase V belong to the interval\na \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 b, where (107) a := \u03c0 \u2212 arctan 3 \u2248 1.89255 and (108)\nb := \u03c0 \u2212 arctan 3 5 \u2248 2.60117 , (109)\nsuch that the lower limit corresponds to q = (0, \u03c0) and the upper one to q = (0, 0). It is possible that the two families of ground states also contain some states with rational multiples q1, q2 of \u03c0, but they will nevertheless be called\u201cincommensurable\u201daccording to convention. For the boundary of the incommensurable\n19\nregion this is plausible, but also at \u03c6 = 0, i. e., J1 = 1, J2 = 0, there exists a two-dimensional ground state with angles of 120\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 between adjacent spins that can be constructed elementarily and has q1 = 2\u03c0 3 , q2 = \u03c0 3 , see Figure 7.\nTo illustrate the construction of incommensurable ground states we choose the example of \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/4, i.e., J1 = \u2212J2 = \u221a 2 2 . The corresponding ground state of the infinite lattice can be approximated by a ground state of a finite model such that q1 = 19\u03c0 24 \u2248 2.48709, q2 = \u03c0/2 \u2248 1.5708 and E (1) min = \u22122.35473. We choose these numbers as initial values for numerically calculating the common root of p2 = 0 and p3 = 0. The result reads q1 = 2.47535 and q2 = 1.5708, where remarkably the value for q2 is identical to the initial value. Inserting these values into J\u0302(q, \u03bb\u0302) we determine its lowest eigenvalue as Emin \u2248 \u22122.35480, slightly below E(1)min. The corresponding eigenvector is (0.945027 + 0.326993 i, 1) and can be identified with the incommensurable ground state\n(s0, s1) =\n( 0.945027 1\n0.326993 0\n) (110)\nin the primitive unit cell, if we again represent two-dimensional states by complex numbers of absolute value 1. If we assume q2 = \u03c0/2 from the outset the equation p3 = 0 can be solved analytically with the result\nq1 = \u03c0 \u2212 arctan (\u221a 1\n2\n(\u221a 5\u2212 1 )) , (111)\nand the corresponding minimal energy\nEmin = \u2212 1\n2\n\u221a 11 + 5 \u221a 5 . (112)\nThe corresponding eigenvector has the form   1\n4 \u221a \u22122 + \u221a 5\u2212 2i \u221a\u221a 5\u2212 2 , 1\n  . (113)\nAll these analytical results agree with the above numerical values. When we combine all this information, we get a phase diagram, see Figure 8. Additionally, we have calculated Emin(\u03c6) for a finite model with M = 1152 spins without ground-state gauge. This would represent a lower LuttingerTisza bound only for M = 1152, but it turns out that it is a lower bound also for the infinite system, see Figure 8. Numerical Monte Carlo calculations of Emin(\u03c6) have been performed for an M = 72 model. These values coincide with the theoretical Emin(\u03c6) for the three one-dimensional phases I, II and III, but due to the mismatch of the periodic boundary conditions and incommensurable spiral ground state they lie above the minimal energy of the two incommensurable phases IV and V , except for the above-mentioned ground state at \u03c6 = 0, see Figure 8, lower panel.\n20\nmin according to (95)\nand (96), and the green curve analogously for E (III) min according to (97). The minimal energies of the incommensurable phases IV and V have been calculated semi-analytically and shown by cyan curves. The blue points represent the numerical Monte Carlo results for the minimal energy calculated for a finite model with M = 72 spins. The upper panel represents the global view, and the middle and the lower one the magnifications of the regions 1.4 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2.9 and \u22120.1 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0/4. The boundaries a, b of the incommensurable phase V are given in (108,109). All minimal energies are multiplied with a global factor of 1/2 according to the convention used in large parts of the literature. We distinguish between five phases (I \u2212 V ) indicated by light colors as explained in the text.\n21"

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY",
            "text": "In this paper, we have presented a kind of combination of the LTLK approach and the Lagrange-variety approach for the ground state problem of spin lattices. This results in the following recipe: Calculate the Fourier transformed dressed J-matrix J\u0302(q,\u03bb) and find the values for the wave vector q \u2208 Q and the Lagrange parameters \u03bb \u2208 \u039b where the minimal eigenvalue of the J-matrix w. r. t. q assumes its global maximum w. r. t. \u03bb. The value for \u03bb \u2208 \u039b is known to be uniquely determined for each (finite) spin lattice and has been denoted by \u03bb\u0302 (ground state gauge). This first step can be difficult in general, but we have given two non-trivial examples (the modified honeycomb lattice and the modified square lattice) where it is feasible. The second step leads to the construction of ground states as linear combinations of the eigenvectors corresponding to the q \u2208 Q and \u03bb\u0302 \u2208 \u039b found in the first step. This step could lead to spin configurations of an un-physical dimension exceeding three and thus may fail. In the case of at most three-dimensional ground states, however, it leads directly to a determination of these as in the two examples. One may then ask whether it is possible to obtain all ground states by this method if the problems mentioned do not arise. First, one must admit that the present method finds only symmetric ground states, i.e., those whose components are simultaneously eigenvectors of the lattice translation operator. Second, when considering a finite model of an infinite lattice, one cannot be sure, in general, whether a larger model would yield further ground states realizing the same minimum energy per site or even lower the minimum energy. The latter could only be ruled out by other arguments, e. g., by showing that the lattice is composed of subunits whose energy is already minimal for a given state. Those ground states of the infinite lattice that cannot be obtained already as ground states of finite models are called \u201cincommensurable\u201d in the literature. We have shown that in the second example, the modified square lattice, our method can be extrapolated in order to obtain also incommensurable ground states."
