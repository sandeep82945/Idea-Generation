1. **Investigate the impact of the dual household registration system on the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The dual household registration system in China divides the population into two categories: urban and rural. This system has been identified as a major factor contributing to the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in the country. Future research could explore the specific mechanisms through which the dual household registration system affects this imbalance and propose policy recommendations to address these issues.


2. **Examine the role of the land finance system in driving land urbanization in China.** The land finance system in China has been criticized for promoting rapid land urbanization at the expense of other forms of development. Future research could investigate the specific mechanisms through which the land finance system drives land urbanization and explore alternative approaches to land management that could promote more balanced and sustainable urbanization.


3. **Analyze the impact of the asymmetrical tax distribution system between financial rights and administrative rights on the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The asymmetrical tax distribution system in China has been identified as a factor contributing to the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization. Future research could investigate the specific mechanisms through which this tax system affects this imbalance and propose policy recommendations to address these issues.


4. **Explore the potential of rural revitalization strategies to address the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** The Chinese government has recently launched a number of rural revitalization strategies aimed at improving the living conditions of rural residents and promoting rural development. Future research could investigate the potential of these strategies to address the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization and propose specific policy recommendations for implementing these strategies effectively.


5. **Develop a comprehensive model to simulate the dynamics of population urbanization and land urbanization in China.** A comprehensive model that can simulate the dynamics of population urbanization and land urbanization in China would be a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers. Such a model could be used to explore different scenarios and assess the potential impacts of different policy interventions. Future research could focus on developing and validating such a model.
