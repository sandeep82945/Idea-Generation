However, the clinical efficacy of conventional treatments for gastric cancer remains limited, with a median overall survival of approximately eight months for advanced cases. In recent years, researchers have increasingly focused on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as a promising approach. ADCs are potent chemical drugs that selectively target cancer cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors with antibodies. Notably, ADCs have demonstrated promising results in clinical studies and have made significant strides in the treatment of gastric cancer. Currently, several ADCs are under investigation in clinical trials for gastric cancer patients, targeting various receptors such as EGFR, HER-2, HER-3, CLDN18.2, Mucin 1, among others. This review offers a comprehensive exploration of ADC drug characteristics and provides an overview of the research progress in ADC-based therapies for gastric cancer.\nKEYWORDS\nantibody-drug conjugates, gastric cancer, mechanism, therapy, trial\n1 Introduction\nGastric cancer (GC) is ranked among the top five malignancies worldwide in terms of incidence and mortality, and it is one of the third most common malignancies in China (1). Patients diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer face a grim prognosis, with a median survival of approximately eight months (2). Currently, GC encompasses two histopathological subtypes, namely intestinal and diffuse types, as classified by the Lauren typing system. The intestinal type of GC is primarily linked to H. pylori infection-induced intestinal metaplasia and exhibits a tubular or glandular structure. On the other hand, the diffuse type of GC typically presents with poorly differentiated tumor cells lacking mucosity, infiltrating the gastric tissue as individual cells or small subpopulations (3). Although these histopathological differences have implications for GC prognosis, they do not form the basis for determining treatment options for the disease.\nA combination of treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, represents the standard approach for various stages of\nfrontiersin.org01\ngastric cancer. Unfortunately, the majority of GC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (4). Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of GC patients do not receive second-line treatment due to increased adverse effects, inferior treatment outcomes, and reduced tolerability. Traditional chemotherapy regimens are effective in killing tumor cells but often inflict substantial harm on normal cells. Consequently, minimizing off-target toxicity and collateral damage while achieving notable chemotherapeutic efficacy has emerged as a significant hurdle in the management of gastric cancer.\nIn the early 20th century, the German immunologist Paul Ehrlich proposed the \u201cgolden bullet\u201d theory, which suggested the potential of monoclonal antibodies to specifically target and eliminate cancer cells by binding to antigens. The development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) gained momentum in the 1990s, thanks to advancements in chemical linkage technologies and the production of humanized monoclonal antibodies, ultimately leading to their approval for clinical trials (5). In 2000, the first ADC drug, Mylotarg, consisting of a novel anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody combined with calicheamicin, received FDA approval for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (6). However, due to severe off-target effects, the product was later withdrawn from the market in 2010. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in pharmacokinetics and payload potency, enabling ADCs to demonstrate high effectiveness against proliferating tumor cell lines (7). In 2013, the FDA approved KADCYLA as the first ADC drug for the treatment of solid tumors. To date, numerous ADC products have received approval from both the FDA and China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) (8). Distinguished from conventional therapies, ADCs employ linker coupling to combine monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic payloads (9). This targeted approach reduces damage to normal cells and minimizes systemic toxicity. Looking ahead, ADCs hold great promise as potential new treatment options for cancer patients, including those with gastric cancer.\nADCs, which involve the conjugation of monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic drugs, represent a novel and promising class of biopharmaceutical compounds in the filed of oncology. Currently, there are 11 FDA-approved ADC drugs and 79 Phase I studies underway, demonstrating their increasing significance. In addition to their proven efficacy and drug toxicity profiles, ADCs exhibit remarkable versatility across various tumor types. Notably, encouraging outcomes have been observed with ADCs such as trastuzumab lutixan (T-DXd) and trastuzumab entansine (T-DM1) in HER2+ breast cancer patients (10). It is worth mentioning that gastric cancer exhibits a higher prevalence of heterogeneous HER2 expression compared to breast cancer (11, 12). This review aims to present the most recent advancements in ADC-related drugs and clinical data specific to gastric cancer, address the current challenges and unresolved issues, and provide valuable insights and future perspectives in this filed."

            "text": "ADCs represent an innovative class of targeted biotherapeutics that combine monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic drugs. They primarily consist of antibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens, linkers, and cytotoxic payloads (13) (Figure 1). The antibody component exerts its anti-tumor effects by specifically recognizing the antigen on the target cells, facilitating the formation of an antigen-antibody conjugate (14). Following conjugate formation, the cytotoxic payload is rapidly internalized, leading to the release of cytotoxic drugs. The linker component plays a crucial role in connecting and delivering the payload, ensuring a strong attachment of the toxic structure to the antibody, thus minimizing off-target toxicity (15, 16).\nAmong the aforementioned components, the payload is the most crucial element of ADCs. Studies have indicated that each antibody typically carries an average of 2-4 payload molecules, which is known as the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). In general, ADCs with higher DAR values are metabolized more rapidly, a characteristic that largely influences the drug\u2019s therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the DAR value, PK, and stability are instrumental in determining the size of the conjugation site and the coupling location. Currently, the most extensively studied payloads are DNA damaging agents, DNA transcription inhibitors, and microtubulin inhibitors. Yaghoubi et al. (17) showed that DNA damaging drugs primarily impede tumor cell proliferation through alkylation induced within the DNA double helix groove, nucleic acid strand breakage, or cross-linking reactions. DNA damaging agents include inhibitors such as Amatoxin and Quinolinealkaloid (SN-38). The latter category includes metanephrines and auristatin. Furthermore, RNA splicing inhibitors and RNA polymerase inhibitors are currently under rigorous investigation, with the anticipation of future related drugs for oncology patients, including those with GC."

The previously mentioned ADCs have provided benefits to numerous GC patients by leveraging the target specificity and chemotherapeutic properties of antibodies. However, therapeutic efficacy of ADCs is often constrained by their relatively low drug delivery capacity at safe dosage levels, which restricts the amount of chemotherapeutic agent that reaches the intended target area. In contrast, ARCs serve as promising carriers for siRNA drug delivery, enabling precise and effective targeting of cancer cells (18).\nThe primary mechanism of action of anti-siRNA drugs lies in their ability to inhibit the expression of target genes through RNA interference (RNAi). Ribonucleic acid endonucleases can produce siRNAs, each containing approximately 22 bases, by cleaving short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and longer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (19). The stability and efficacy of siRNA molecules can be enhanced through chemical modifications to the phosphoglycan backbone\nfrontiersin.org\nand its constituent pyrimidine and purine bases. For example, replacing the unstable phosphodiesterase backbone with a phosphorothioate backbone improves albumin binding by enhancing the hydrophobicity of the molecule. This alteration effectively reduces the drug\u2019s degradation rate in vivo, prolongs the circulation time, and enhances the pharmacokinetics (20). In recent years, the FDA has approved several siRNA drugs, including Givosiran, Patisiran, Inclisiran, and Lumasiran (21, 22). Notably, Givosiran has significant implications in liver-related conditions. The drug achieves good therapeutic effects through a GalNAcdirected siRNA delivery system (23). Despite the promise of ARC drugs, they encounter a series of challenges, such as the difficulty of cellular uptake due to the inherent negative charge of siRNA, the endocytosis of the target antigen, and the lack of quantitative methods to study siRNA endosomal escape. The development and application of many ARC drugs are currently in their preliminary stage. Further in-depth research is needed to pave the way for a new chapter of ARC therapies."

These currently include downregulation of cell surface antigens like HER2, drug efflux proteins, impaired endocytosis, defects in internalization pathways such as AKT signalling, overexpression of transporters such as V-ATP binding cassettes, and lysosomal degradation (24\u201326).\nADCs exhibit a unique resistance mechanism, specifically involving defective lysosomal degradation or an internalization\nFrontiers in Oncology 03\npathway. The degradation of ADCs within lysosomes depends on environmental conditions and enzymatic activity. In T-DM1resistant gastric cancer cells, researchers have observed lysosomal alkalinization or reduced lysosomal protein hydrolase activity (27). Wang et al. (28) showed that the internalization and externalization kinetics of T-DM1 in gastric cancer cells were similar between parental and resistant cells. However, in N87 gastric cancer cells exhibiting drug resistantance, aberrant V-ATPase was found to impact T-DM1 proteolysis, leading to significant changes in drug resistance. Furthermore, Sung et al. (29) demonstrated in a HER2+ cancer model that when N87-TM cells were implanted into athymic mice, they could modulate internalization and transport pathways through the mediation of related factors. This mechanism is fundamentally associated with T-DM1 resistance. The researchers developed a T-DM1-resistant cell model using a circulatory route of administration and analyzed differences in membrane fractions through proteomic techniques. Overexpression of transcript release factor, caveolin-1, and polymerase I affected caveolinmediated endocytosis in this cell model. Unfortunately, the knockdown of caveolin-1 did not appear to significantly influence the restoration of T-DM1 sensitivity.\nAt present, the investigation into the resistance mechanism of ADCs in gastric cancer has been limited to pre-clinical models, and its broader application in future clinical treatments remains to be seen."

EGFR, also known as ERBB1, belongs to the ERBB receptor tyrosine kinase family and is a transmembrane protein receptor comprised of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane structural domain, and an intracellular kinase domain.\nDepatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414) is an ADC that targets EGFR. It consists of the humanized antibody ABT-806, approximately four MMAFs, and a maleimide hexyl group. Notably, ABT-806 exhibits a low binding affinity to EGFR in normal tissues. However, ABT-414 retains the positive functional properties of ABT-806 and shows considerable efficacy in xenograft models (39). Upon specifically recognizing cancer cells with high levels of wild-type EGFR, the drug binds with high affinity to the mutant EGFR VIII, thereby exerting anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the EGFR/ERK pathway. In addition, MRG003, an ADC targeting EGFR, is composed of EGFR-specific IgG1 antibodies, monomethyl orexin E, and linkers. This drug specifically recognizes and binds to\nEGFR on the surface of tumor cells, subsequently activating the Hippo pathway through tyrosine phosphorylation. Notably, Hpo is a Ser/Thr kinase that binds and phosphorylates the YAP/TAZ regulator (38). Eventually, the protease activity releases the small molecule MMAE, which binds to the intracellular microtubulin and inhibits microtubulin polymerization, disrupting mitosis and various cellular physiological functions, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and leading to tumor cell death. Currently, Phase II trials such as NCT04838964, NCT04868162, and NCT04868344, focusing on gastrointestinal and head and neck tumors, are ongoing while awaiting the collation of pertinent results.

Trastuzumab, one of the components of T-DM1, binds to the extracellular structural domain IV of the HER2 factor, disrupting the HER2/HER3 interaction in cells that overexpress HER2 and affecting the MAPK-RAS/RAF signalling pathway (31). The drug hampers tumor cell growth by upregulating the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor protein p27, inducing cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase in tumor cells. In preclinical trials, T-DM1 exhibited potent anti-GC cell proliferation properties. However, it did not demonstrate a significant survival benefit in subsequent clinical trials (44).

It achieves this through the activation of the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway via heterodimer formation and tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation-mediated signal transduction (49). The drug interacts with the HER2 antigen present on the surface of tumor cells, subsequently undergoing endocytosis to enter the lysosomal compartment. The drug\u2019s linker is catalyzed by cat B to break and release MMAE. This cytotoxic agent then translocates from the lysosome to the cytoplasm where it binds to microtubule proteins.

In contrast, studies have shown that certain chemotherapeutic agents and physical irradiation can induce Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD), leading to T cell recruitment and activation of effector T cells within tumors (74). Preclinical evidence suggests that ADCs have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing the response to detection of ICIs (75). In mouse models, T cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment exhibit overexpression of CTLA4 and PD-1/ PD-L1, with synergistic effects observed when combining T-DM1 with ICIs (76).

Once the target antigen is bound, ADCs-antigen complexes undergo internalization through niche or lattice-protein-mediated cytosolic drinking or endocytosis (29). T-DM1 resistant N87 cells internalize ADCs into intracellular fossa proteins and alter their transport to lysosomes. Sung et al.

Reduced ErbB2 expression has been identified as an acquired resistance mechanism to T-DM1 in T-DM1-resistant cell lines (25). Moreover, tumors with higher heterogeneity and lower HER2 expression exhibit poorer drug efficacy due to limited permeability of the cytotoxic complex membrane (82). In addition, ADCs containing non-cleavable junctions can impact their efficacy. For instance, ARX788 with a maleimide junction and T-DM1 with a thioether junction may result in lower DAR, reduced payload numbers, and inferior antitumor effects (83).

            "text": "Despite significant advancements in cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies in recent years, the longterm prognosis for patients with inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic gastric cancer remains unfavorable. The introduction of new drugs and the utilization of ADCs have brought about a transformative change in the treatment and prognosis of gastric cancer patients. However, there are certain limitations associated with their application. The impact of factors influencing antigen internalization and the heterogeneity of antigen expression on the effectiveness of ADCs remains unclear. Additionally, all existing cytotoxic drugs primarily target microtubule proteins or DNA/ RNA, necessitating the re-optimization of chain strategies to enhance drug stability and site-specific coupling, thereby improving efficacy and safety. Furthermore, the development of drugs with diverse mechanisms of action, such as novel cytotoxic payloads, holds promise. Lastly, the future holds the potential for the discovery of novel predictive biomarkers that can aid in better defining patient subgroups with specific cancer characteristics.\nAuthor contributions\nYZ, MZ andWKwrote the first draft of the manuscript.
