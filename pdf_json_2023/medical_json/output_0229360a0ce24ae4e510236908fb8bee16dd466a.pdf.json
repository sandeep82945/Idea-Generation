Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nuclei his is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Comm hich permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nand establishes a unique model for studying the structural and functional interplays between Acrs and Type III CRISPR\u2013Cas systems.\u2019\nThis paragraph now reads as follows: \u2018It is worth noting that the inhibition of Cmr- \u03b1 turnover by AcrIIIB2 and the detailed mechanism behind the inhibition were first reported by Lin et al. in a preprint article ( 56 ) , and our results are in line with their data. Although AcrIIIB2 is only encoded by Sulfolobus virus SIRV3 with its homolog undetected, our finding infers that more unknown Acrs against Type III CRISPR\u2013Cas systems are probably encoded by the mobile genetic elements and even their hosts. Exploring these unknown Acrs will expand our understanding of the competition between CRISPR\u2013Cas and anti-CRISPRs and could also raise the genetic tools to control CRISPR\u2013Cas systems in diverse applications ( 57 ) , including Type III CRISPR\u2013Cas-based genome editing ( 58,59 ) and RNA targeting ( 60 ) . In summary, our study provides a new insight into the complexity of the prokaryote-virus arm race and establishes a unique model for studying the structural and functional interplays between Acrs and Type III CRISPR\u2013Cas systems.\u2019\nc Acids Research. ons Attribution License ( http: // creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 / ) , provided the original work is properly cited.\ny Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024"
