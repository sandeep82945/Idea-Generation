Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced immune deficiency was one of risk factors for cancer tumorigenesis and development. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological features of PTC in HIV-infected patients and discuss possible connections between PTC and HIV infection.\nMethods: A total of 17670 patients from September 2009 to April 2022 who underwent PTC surgery for the first time were analyzed retrospectively. At last, 10 patients of PTC with HIV infection (HIV-positive group) and 40 patients without HIV infection (HIV-negative group) were included. The differences in general data and clinicopathological characteristics between the HIV-positive group and the HIV-negative group were analyzed.\nResults: There were statistically significant differences in age and gender between the HIV-positive group and the HIV-negative group (P<0.05), and males and <55 years old accounted for a higher proportion in the HIV-positive group. The differences in tumor diameter and capsular invasion between the HIV-positive group and HIV-negative group were statistically significant (P<0.05). Meanwhile, in terms of extrathyroid extension (ETE), lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, the HIV-positive group were significantly higher than the HIVnegative group (P<0.001).\nConclusion: HIV infection was a risk factor for larger tumors, more severe ETE, more lymph node metastasis, and more distant metastasis. HIV infection could promote PTC proliferation and make PTC more aggressive. Many factors such as tumor immune escape, secondary infection, etc. may are responsible for these effects. More attention and more thorough treatment should be paid to these patients.\nKEYWORDS\npapillary thyroid carcinoma, thyroid cancer, clinicopathological features, HIV, infection\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC)is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an increasing incidence over the last decades (1). Usually, distant metastases from PTC are rare and the prognosis of PTC is relatively good (2). However, a few populations are considered to be at high risk of poor prognosis (3). Some factors have been associated with poor pathological features and clinical outcomes of PTC, such as BRAFV600E mutation (4), extrathyroidal invasion (5) and so on.\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in China during more than a decade indicate that HIV/AIDS prevalence is getting more and more serious and the rapid spread of HIV exists with the characteristics of regional and age differences (6). Some research revealed that HIV-induced immune deficiency was one of risk factors for cancer tumorigenesis and development (7, 8). Other HIV-associated factors contribute to development of malignancies, including direct effect of HIV on various cellular processes, coinfection with oncogenic organisms, risk behaviors (e.g. alcohol or tobacco use), environmental oncogenic factors and possibly antiretroviral therapy (9).\nThe incidences of thyroid cancer in HIV-infected patients were 4%-8.5% according to previous reports (8, 10). With increased prevalence of PTC, PTC with concomitant HIV infection has become more common in recent years. It is well known that HIV infection can affect thyroid function (11), regulate the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis (12, 13) and cause papillomavirus infection (14). However, whether HIV infection is related to the occurrence and development of PTC and the impact of HIV infection on the clinicopathological characteristics of PTC are still unknown. The objective of this study is to describe the clinicopathological features of PTC in HIV-infected patients and discuss possible connections and effects between PTC and HIV infection."

There were 8022 (45.4%) patients who underwent lobectomy, while the remaining 9648 (54.6%) underwent TT. Lateral neck node dissection for 1591 (9%). The numbers of patients in each TNM stage were as follows: 14454 (81.8%) in stage I, 459 (2.6%) in stage II, 1683 (9.52%) stage III, and 1074 (6.08%) stage IV.\nComparison of clinicpathological features between the HIV-positive and HIVnegative groups\nThere were statistically significant differences in age and gender between the HIV-positive group and the HIV-negative group (P<0.05), and males and <55 years old accounted for a higher proportion in the HIV-positive group. The HIV-positive group had a lower BMI than the HIV-negative group, though differences were not statistically significant. The differences in tumor diameter and capsular invasion between the HIV-positive group and HIVnegative group were statistically significant (P<0.05). Meanwhile, in terms of ETE, the HIV-positive group was significantly higher than the HIV-negative group (P<0.001). In terms of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, the proportions of the HIVpositive group were higher than those of the HIV-negative group, differences were statistically significant (P<0.001) (Table 2, Figures 1, 2). In addition, there were no significant differences in Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, multifocal lesions, bilateral lesions, BRAFV600E mutation, TSH, FT3 and FT4 between patients with and without HIV infection (Table 2).\nAssociation between HIV infection and clinicopathological features of PTC\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect the correlation between clinicopathological features of PTC and HIV infection. As shown in Table 3, in univariate analysis, larger tumor (OR=4.78, 95% CI:2.51\u20138.94), more severe capsular invasion (OR=1.6, 95% CI:1.07\u20132.42) and ETE (OR=14.67, 95% CI:7.12\u2013 30.13), more lymph node metastasis (N1a: OR=18.24, 95% CI:8.81\u2013 33.92; N1b: OR=19.02, 95% CI:4.72\u201376.54), and more distant metastasis (OR=3.29, 95% CI:1.98\u20135.77) were associated with HIV infection. Furthermore, after correction for age, sex, TSH, FT3, FT4 and BMI, HIV infection was still a risk factor for larger tumors (OR=5.05, 95% CI:1.86\u20133.92), more severe ETE (OR=4.12, 95% CI:1.88\u20139.98), more lymph node metastasis (N1a: OR=5.18, 95% CI:2.66\u201312.08; N1b: OR=9.56, 95% CI:4.04\u201322.64), and more distant metastasis (OR=7.16, 95% CI:2.32\u201320.18)."

Various types of thyroid disorders have been described in HIV-infected\nfrontiersin.org\npatients, such as Graves\u2019 disease, hypothyroidism, euthyroid sick syndrome, etc (17\u201319). Meanwhile, some researches revealed that HIV-induced immune deficiency was the most common risk factor to develop malignancies (8\u201310).\nDuring more than a decade, AIDS-defining cancers remain frequent in China, and non-AIDS-defining cancers play an important role in morbidity and mortality of HIV positive population in China (8). However, less is known about the impact of HIV infection on PTC so far. Here, we investigate the clinicopathological features of PTC in patients with HIV and discuss possible connections between PTC and HIV infection.\nIn this study, age and gender distribution had a significant difference in both groups. There were more males and the patients were younger in HIV-positive group. It was consistent with the background of the increasing proportion of young homosexual men in China in recent years. These people have been the fastest-growing\nFrontiers in Oncology 04\nrisk group for HIV epidemic (20, 21). Moreover, the impact of HIV infection on life expectancy is another reason for the younger age of HIV-positive patients (22). Some researchers believed that HIV infection leads to altered metabolism, poor oral intake and increased prevalence of weight loss (23, 24). BMI was used as a major measurement in most studies. Epidemiology studies have suggested that higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of PTC (25). However, the BMI of the HIV-positive group was slightly lower than that of the HIV-negative group according to our data, but the difference was not significant. This means that HIV infection is unlikely to affect PTC through changes in BMI.\nWe found that the tumor was larger in the HIV-positive group. It suggested HIV infection could promote PTC proliferation. In addition to, HIV infection also makes PTC more aggressive. Capsular invasion, ETE, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis were significantly more common in HIV-infected PTC\nfron tiersin.org\nFrontiers in Oncology 05\npatients. Several possible reasons are as follows (Table 4) (1). Numerous studies have confirmed that hypothroidism and mildly elevated TSH level were more frequently observed in HIV-positive population as compared to HIV-negative group (26\u201329). In our study, mean TSH value was indeed higher in the HIV-infected patients than in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant. This agrees with previous findings. TSH is released from the anterior pituitary under positive regulation from TSH-releasing hormone (which is released from the hypothalamus) and negative feedback from the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). HIV infection frequently results in early and protracted disturbances of hypothalamus/ pituitary and thyroid dysfunction, which could change TSH concentrations in serum (30). Higher TSH has a proliferative effect on PTC growth that is most likely mediated by TSH receptors on tumor cells (31) (2); The immune system is no longer functioning effectively after HIV infection, which enable cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance and develop rapidly (32, 33) (3); Secondary virus and carcinogen infections are common in patients with HIV. For example, some viruses, such as human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes virus, etc., promote tumorigenesis and development of PTC (34\u201336) (4); Genetic factors may play roles in the pathogenesis of PTC in HIV-positive patients. Yahong Chen et al. had identified nearly 40 HIV-related genes from widely biological pathways (37). Molecular biology has discovered several pathways that play major roles in the occurrence and development of PTC. For example, VHL is a wellknown tumor suppressor that is deregulated in the majority of PTC tissues (38). STAT1 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis via AMPK signaling pathway in PTC (39). NCOR2\nfrontiersin.org\naccelerates PTC progression by upregulating metastasis-associated protein 2 expression (40) (5); Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) may alter clinicopathological features of PTC by drug interactions or effects on the immune system (41) (6); Cachexia, psychological effects and stress with HIV infection are also the important clinical risk factors of PTC (42) (7); Changes of thyroidrelated cytokines after HIV infection, such as thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), rT3 and anti-TPO antibody may also play roles. But further studies are needed here (43, 44) (8); Direct cytopathic effects of HIV on the thyroid gland. Here we could put forward such hypotheses: HIV can affect the normal physiological status of the thyroid gland by altering CD4 and CD8 (45, 46), or HIV affects thyroid hormone metabolism through the interaction with peripheral T3 receptors, and then affects the status of thyroid follicular cells (47).\nAs a preliminary study, there are still some limitations in this study. Firstly, the sample size of the study is relatively small in HIVpositive group. We only collected 10 patients of PTC with HIV infection (HIV-positive group) from total of 17670 patients who underwent PTC surgery for the first time during the past 13 years in our department. Perhaps the reasons for the great difference are the lower incidence of HIV infection and higher incidence of thyroid deceases in northeast of China. Secondly, there is only one patient who received anti-virus therapy for a short time before surgery and we can\u2019t get more favorable information to compare the different\nFrontiers in Oncology 06\nclinicopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinoma of performing HIV therapy or not. The potential biases of the study may because more diagnosed HIV (+) patients were transferred to hospital for infectious diseases to performing surgery and systematic anti-virus therapy, which result in less cases collected. Thirdly, Serumbased biomarkers, such as lactate dehydrogenase, can also reflect tumor burden and are often also correlated with a poor response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Other circulating markers (such as circulating free tumor DNA and/or circulating tumor cells) are also attracting research interest as surrogate markers of tumor burden. Herein, we didn\u2019t compare the serum-based biomarkers and hope more complete data can be collected and analyzed to enrich the clinicopathological features in the follow-up study."
