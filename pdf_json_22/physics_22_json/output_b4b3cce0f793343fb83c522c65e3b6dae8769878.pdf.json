    "abstractText": "Engineering long-range interacting spin systems with ultracold atoms offers the possibility to explore exotic magnetically ordered phases in strongly-correlated scenarios. Quantum gases in optical cavities provide a versatile experimental platform to further engineer photon-mediated interactions and access the underlying microscopic processes by probing the cavity field. Here, we study a two-component spin Bose-Hubbard system with cavity-mediated interactions. We provide a comprehensive overview of its phase diagram and transitions in experimentally relevant regimes. The interplay of different energy scales yields a rich phase diagram with superfluid and insulating phases exhibiting density modulation or spin ordering. In particular, the combined effect of contact and global-range interactions gives rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered phase for arbitrarily small spin-dependent light-matter coupling, while global-range and inter-spin contact interactions introduce regions of instability and phase separation in the phase diagram. We further study the low energy excitations above the antiferromagnetic phase. Besides particle-hole branches, it hosts spin-exchange excitations with a tunable energy gap. The studied lattice model can be readily realized in cold-atom experiments with optical cavities.",

J. Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom\n(Received 20 October 2022; revised 3 March 2023; accepted 14 April 2023; published 11 July 2023)\nEngineering long-range interacting spin systems with ultracold atoms offers the possibility to explore exotic magnetically ordered phases in strongly-correlated scenarios. Quantum gases in optical cavities provide a versatile experimental platform to further engineer photon-mediated interactions and access the underlying microscopic processes by probing the cavity field. Here, we study a two-component spin Bose-Hubbard system with cavity-mediated interactions. We provide a comprehensive overview of its phase diagram and transitions in experimentally relevant regimes. The interplay of different energy scales yields a rich phase diagram with superfluid and insulating phases exhibiting density modulation or spin ordering. In particular, the combined effect of contact and global-range interactions gives rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered phase for arbitrarily small spin-dependent light-matter coupling, while global-range and inter-spin contact interactions introduce regions of instability and phase separation in the phase diagram. We further study the low energy excitations above the antiferromagnetic phase. Besides particle-hole branches, it hosts spin-exchange excitations with a tunable energy gap. The studied lattice model can be readily realized in cold-atom experiments with optical cavities.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.L032003\nIntroduction. Experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices have extended the scope of quantum simulations of many-body systems [1,2]. Two key strengths are the high degree of tunability of different energy scales, and the possibility to involve the atomic spin degree of freedom, facilitating the investigation of strongly-correlated phenomena like superfluidity, quantum magnetism, high-temperature superconductivity, and complex out-of-equilibrium dynamics [3,4]. While contact interactions naturally occur in ultracold atomic systems [2,5], long-range interactions have been more elusive. Nonetheless, systems that are traditionally used to study long-range interactions, such as dipolar quantum gases, heteronuclear molecules, and Rydberg atoms, suffer from small long-range interaction strengths, low densities, and short lifetimes, respectively [6\u20138]. Quantum gases coupled to optical cavities provide an alternative experimental platform to create photon-mediated global-range interactions, whose strength and sign are controlled by external laser fields [9,10]. This has facilitated theoretical [11\u201319] and experimental [20,21] investigations of lattice supersolid and charge density wave phases in single-component spin systems. The atomic dynamics and many-body excitations can be accessed\n*rrodrigo@phys.ethz.ch \u2020These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2021dubcekt@ethz.ch\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Recently, the inclusion of an internal atomic spin degree of freedom has become feasible in such systems, leading to the observation of density and spin self-organization [23\u201325]. Incorporating tunable photon-mediated spin interactions further enriches the accessible phenomenology [26\u201336]. In combination with optical lattices, this approach will allow the realization of strongly-correlated magnetic phases arising due to the interplay of short- and global-range interactions. Some magnetically ordered phases have been discussed in bosonic [37,38] and fermionic systems [39,40], but a comprehensive theoretical study of the phase diagram and transitions in experimentally accessible regimes is still missing, although it could expedite their successful realization.\nHere, we investigate an extended two-component BoseHubbard (BH) model with cavity-mediated interactions\u2014the lattice counterpart of the experiment performed in Ref. [23] with a bulk Bose gas. The considered global-range interactions have a \u201cdensity\u201d and a \u201cspin\u201d contribution, which favor both atomic components to either occupy a common sublattice or two different ones, each breaking independently a lattice Z2-symmetry. Their absolute and relative strengths can be tuned via the intensity and the polarization of an external laser field, respectively. Additionally, the two atomic components have different intra and interspecies contact interactions. We extract the complete phase diagram using a Gutzwiller approach at unity filling, and obtain density-modulated and magnetically-ordered phases, both in the superfluid and insulating regimes. Remarkably, the cooperation between short-range and global-range interactions results in the formation of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator for arbitrarily small spin-dependent coupling strengths.\n2643-1564/2023/5(3)/L032003(7) L032003-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nIn some regimes, the competing contact-interaction energy scales lead to the separation of the two spin components [41\u201343]. In addition, global-range interactions can introduce correlated phase-separated states in multicomponent systems [44,45], and induce phase instabilities in systems with only one component [17,46]. To further elucidate the nature of the magnetically ordered phase, we construct an effective Hamiltonian for its low-energy excitations via perturbation theory, and identify spin-exchange branches with a tunable gap.\nDescription of the system. We consider a balanced spinmixture of two Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity. Specifically, we consider 87Rb atoms and a two-dimensional (2D) system extending in the xz plane [Fig. 1(a)], resembling the experiments in Refs. [21,23]. A y-polarized quantized cavity mode is \u03bb periodic, extends along the x axis, and has a resonant frequency \u03c9c. The two spin components |\u2191\u3009 = |F = 1, mF = 1\u3009 and |\u2193\u3009 = |F = 1, mF = \u22121\u3009 belong to the total angular momentum F = 1 manifold, with the quantization axis defined by a magnetic field in the z direction. The mixture is loaded into a 2D \u03bb/2-periodic square optical lattice. The lattice arm along z has a frequency \u03c9p and linear polarization in the xy plane, and fulfills a dual role as a transverse pump field (TP). It is far red-detuned from the atomic and cavity resonance, c = \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c9c < 0, thus acting dispersively on the atoms. The light scattered from the TP into the cavity couples the atoms\u2019 motional and spin degrees of freedom to the cavity mode. The single-particle Hamiltonian reads [47]\nH\u0302sp = p\u0302 2\n2m + V\u0302lat \u2212\n( c \u2212 U0 cos2 ( 2\u03c0\n\u03bb x\u0302\n)) a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\n+ cos ( 2\u03c0\n\u03bb x\u0302\n) cos ( 2\u03c0\n\u03bb z\u0302\n) (\u03b7sX\u0302 + \u03b7vP\u0302F\u0302z ) (1)\nwith total momentum p\u0302 = ( p\u0302x + p\u0302z ) and h\u0304 = 1 [23,47]. The first two terms account for the atom moving in the 2D lattice potential V\u0302lat = \u2212V (cos2( 2\u03c0\u03bb x\u0302) + cos2( 2\u03c0\u03bb z\u0302)).\nThe operator a\u0302\u2020 denotes the creation operator associated with the intracavity field. The effective cavity detuning is \u0303c = c \u2212 U0 cos2( 2\u03c0\u03bb x\u0302) < 0, with U0 < 0 being the maximal dispersive shift per atom [47]. The last term in Eq. (1) describes a self-consistent interference potential that arises due to light scattering between the TP and the cavity mode [47]. The scalar component of the atom-light interactions couples the atomic motional degrees of freedom to the real quadrature of the cavity field, X\u0302 = (a\u0302 + a\u0302\u2020)/\u221a2, giving rise to a \u03bb-periodic spin-independent density modulation. The vectorial coupling is mediated by the imaginary quadrature, P\u0302 = i(a\u0302\u2020 \u2212 a\u0302)/\u221a2, and gives rise to phase-shifted \u03bb-periodic modulations for the two spin states, since the z component of the atomic spin operator F\u0302 yields F\u0302z |\u2191\u3009 = + |\u2191\u3009 and F\u0302z |\u2193\u3009 = \u2212 |\u2193\u3009 . The associated coupling strengths are \u03b7s = \u03b7 cos(\u03c6) and \u03b7v = \u03b7\u03be sin(\u03c6), with \u03be = \u03b1v2\u03b1s given by the atom-cavity coupling rate \u03b7 and the ratio of the scalar and vectorial polarizabilities [48,49].\nWe adiabatically eliminate the intracavity field in a tight-binding approximation [14,21,47,50] and obtain a BH Hamiltonian,\nH\u0302 = H\u0302BH + H\u0302Global, (2) with\nH\u0302BH = \u2212t \u2211\nm,\u3008i,j\u3009 (b\u0302\u2020i,mb\u0302j,m + H.c.)\n+ U 2 \u2211 i,m n\u0302i,m(n\u0302i,m \u2212 1) + U12 \u2211 i n\u0302i,\u2191n\u0302i,\u2193, (3)\nand\nH\u0302Global = \u2212Us K \u03022D \u2212 Uv K \u03022S. (4)\nThe first term, Eq. (3), constitutes a two-component BH model [1,2,41,42,51], comprising tunneling to the z nearest neighbors, with rate t > 0 and repulsive intra and interspin contact interactions, U > 0 and U12 > 0. We assume the former to be identical for |\u2191\u3009 and |\u2193\u3009, as is the case for 87Rb in the F = 1 hyperfine groundstate manifold [52]. The operator b\u0302\u2020i,m denotes the bosonic creation operator, while n\u0302i,m = b\u0302\u2020i,mb\u0302i,m counts the total number of atoms with spin m \u2208 {\u2191,\u2193} at site i = (ix, iz ). For sufficiently large magnetic fields, both spin-changing collisions and cavity-assisted Raman processes can be neglected [52]. The second term, Eq. (4), consists of spin-independent (\u201cscalar\u201d) and spin-dependent (\u201cvectorial\u201d) global-range interactions that are mediated by the intracavity field. The scalar interactions are associated with the operator \u03022D = ( \u2211 i(\u22121)|i|n\u0302i)2, where |i| = ix + iz and n\u0302i = n\u0302i,\u2191 + n\u0302i,\u2193. Its expectation value is maximized for a spin-independent spatial density modulation with all atoms occupying only even or odd sites. The expectation value of the operator associated with vectorial interactions, \u03022S = ( \u2211 i(\u22121)|i|S\u0302z,i)2 with S\u0302z,i = n\u0302i,\u2191 \u2212 n\u0302i,\u2193, is maximized for a global antiferromagnetic ordering of the atoms, with all atoms in |\u2191\u3009 occupying even sites and all atoms in |\u2193\u3009 occupying odd sites, or vice versa. The interaction strengths Us = UL cos2\u03c6 and Uv = UL\u03be 2 sin2\u03c6 can be tuned with respect to each other via the angle \u03c6. The overall interaction strength UL > 0 depends on \u0303c and the lattice depth V [47]. The total number of sites is denoted by K .\nL032003-2\nRemarkably, the energy scales of the tunneling, contact and global-range interactions are all independently tunable with respect to each other. The latter increase linearly, both with the number of sites and atoms UL \u221d K = N [47], due to the collective enhancement of photon scattering into the cavity by the number of atoms, provided the cavity mode size does not become a limiting factor [14,21]. The Hamiltonian, Eq. (2), is invariant under a global spin-flip b\u0302i,\u2191 \u2192 b\u0302i,\u2193 and two global rotations b\u0302i,m \u2192 ei\u03c6m b\u0302i,m for each m \u2208 \u2191,\u2193. Furthermore, the scalar and vectorial global-range interactions introduce an additional Z2 symmetry associated to the two sublattices defined by even and odd sites. Henceforth, the Hamiltonian has a U (1) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 symmetry.\nGutzwiller ansatz and order parameters. Motivated by the large particle numbers in experimental platforms N \u2248 104 [21,23], we explore the zero-temperature phase diagram by using a Gutzwiller mean-field approach and considering the case of unity filling (K = N) [53\u201355]. We assume a translationally invariant ground state on each of the even (e) and odd (o) sublattices:\n| G\u3009 = K/2\u220f e=0 K/2\u220f o=0 |\u03c6e\u3009 |\u03c6o\u3009 . (5)\nFor each site i \u2208 {e, o}, the wave function is given by\n|\u03c6i\u3009 = nmax\u2211 n=0 mmax\u2211 m=0 ai(n, m) |n, m\u3009i , (6)\nwhere |n, m\u3009i = (b\u0302 \u2020 i,\u2191 ) n\n\u221a n!\n(b\u0302\u2020i,\u2193 ) m\n\u221a m! |0\u3009 is the local Fock state with n nmax atoms in spin state |\u2191\u3009 and m mmax atoms in state |\u2193\u3009 on a single site. The real coefficients ae \u2261 (ae(n, m))n,m and ao \u2261 (ao(n, m))n,m are optimized to minimize the effective mean-field energy density\nE (ae, ao) = \u3008 G|H\u0302 | G\u3009 K/2 . (7)\nThe superfluid order parameter \u03c8 = 14 \u2211 i,m \u03c8i,m with \u03c8i,m = |\u3008b\u0302\u2020i,m\u3009| (m \u2208 {\u2191,\u2193}) signals the transition from an insulating phase (\u03c8 = 0) to a phase-coherent superfluid phase exhibiting off-diagonal long-range order (\u03c8 > 0). The density \u03b8D = |\u3008n\u0302e \u2212 n\u0302o\u3009|, and spin \u03b8S = |\u3008S\u0302z,e \u2212 S\u0302z,o\u3009| order parameters indicate the degree of global spatial density and spinordering due to global-range interactions [Fig. 1(b)].\nPhases for a uniform mixture. We discuss the case of a balanced spin mixture for U12 = U at unity filling\n\u03c1m = Nm (K/2) = \u3008\u03c6e|n\u0302e,m|\u03c6e\u3009 + \u3008\u03c6o|n\u0302o,m|\u03c6o\u3009 = 1 (8)\nwith m = \u2191,\u2193. The choice of fixed density is motivated by experiments with ultracold atoms, although a qualitatively similar phase diagram arises in a grand canonical ensemble [37,47]. The different order parameters are shown in Fig. 2. The competition of scalar and vectorial globalrange interactions gives rise to two qualitatively different scenarios.\nFor Us > Uv [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)], we observe two distinct insulating phases (\u03c8 = 0) at low tunneling rates zt/U : For large UL, a spin-degenerate charge density wave (CDW), with\n\u03b8D > 0 and \u03b8S = 0; and for small UL, an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator (AFM), with \u03b8S > 0 and \u03b8D = 0. Remarkably, the system favors an AFM for arbitrarily small Uv: the contact interaction hinders the formation of a CDW and overcomes the kinetic energy cost to form a unity filling Mott insulator (MI). There, the AFM configuration is favored among all possible MIs by the vectorial interactions. The discontinuity in the order parameters \u03b8D and \u03b8S when modifying UL/U at fixed zt/U signals a first order AFM-CDW phase transition, occurring at UL/U \u2248 1.27 [47]. As tunneling increases, the system becomes superfluid (\u03c8 > 0) and we observe a firstorder AFM-SF phase transition at small UL/U , signaled by a discontinuous jump in the order parameters [Fig. 2(e)]. For larger global-range interactions, the superfluid phase exhibits density ordering (\u03b8D), which we denote as a lattice supersolid (SS). While in the insulating regime, the AFM phase is stabilized by contact interactions for Us < U/2 + Uv [47]; In the superfluid regime a SS phase is favored for a small region around UL/U = 1.22, giving rise to a first-order AFM-SS phase transition. For even larger UL/U a second-order CDWSS occurs, see Fig. 2(f).\nIn the regime Uv > Us [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)], the system exhibits solely spin ordered phases (\u03b8S > 0 and \u03b8D = 0), as the vectorial global-range and the contact interactions dominate over the scalar interactions. For small UL, we identify a first-order AFM-SF phase transition, signaled by a discontinuous jump of \u03c8 and \u03b8S [Fig. 2(e)]. We observe an increase of the von Neuman entropy when transitioning to the super-\nL032003-3\nfluid phase [47], indicating local entanglement between the two spin components. For larger UL, we observe a secondorder transition from AFM to a spin-ordered superfluid phase, which we denote as an antiferromagnetic lattice supersolid phase (AF-SS) [Fig. 2(g)]. The second-order phase transitions from AFM to AF-SS and CDW to SS are supported by perturbative estimations, cf. black lines in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c) [47,56]. The qualitative behavior of these transitions also agrees with exact diagonalization calculations, which are however limited to small system sizes [47].\nAs the global-range interactions couple every pair of lattice sites, they are captured well by our mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz [57]. However, we expect the method to progressively lose validity as the tunneling is increased, since the local-basis truncation (nmax = mmax = 3) disregards large local occupations that are present deep in the superfluid regime [55]. This is reflected by the saturation of \u03c8 in Figs. 2(e)\u20132(g).\nPhases for different U12/U . Besides homogeneous stable phases, the system can host phase separation (PS) and phase instability (PI) in certain regions of the phase diagram. On the one hand, for large interspin interactions U12/U , it becomes favorable for the two spin species to separate in space [37,41\u201345,58,59]. This is reflected in a lower energy of the PS state in comparison to its spatially homogeneous counterpart. To allow for a PS state, the system is divided into halves (A, B): one with higher spin-up density (\u03c1A\u2191 > \u03c1 A \u2193 ) and one with higher spin-down density (\u03c1 B \u2193 > \u03c1 B \u2191 ), while imposing a density conservation constraint in each half, \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1A,B\u2191 + \u03c1A,B\u2193 = 2, to ensure unity filling. We further assume either \u3008\u0302D\u3009 = 0 or \u3008\u0302S\u3009 = 0. On the other hand, phases obtained at fixed density may become unstable when densities are allowed to fluctuate. Bose-Hubbard models with concurring long-range [46] or global-range interactions [17] are known to feature phase instabilities. Such instabilities are signaled by a negative compressibility, \u2202\u03c1\u03bc < 0 [46], where \u03bc(\u03c1) = \u2202\u03c1E (\u03c1) is the chemical potential as a function of the density \u03c1. We calculate the derivative numerically by using the energy densities E (\u03c1) extracted from the variational ansatz in Eq. (7) allowing for density variations [47].\nWe now discuss the phase diagrams for different inter to intraspin interaction ratios U12/U , and scalar to vectorial global-range interaction ratios Us/Uv . Without the constraint of spatially homogeneous solutions, the mixed CDW state |\u03c6e, \u03c6o\u3009 = |\u2191\u2193, 0\u3009, the entangled state |\u03c6e, \u03c6o\u3009 = |\u2191\u2191, 0\u3009 + |\u2193\u2193, 0\u3009 , and the fully PS configuration with \u03c1A\u2191 = \u03c1B\u2193 = 2 become degenerate at U12/U = 1 [Fig. 3(b)].\nThe phase diagrams for U12/U < 1 are qualitatively similar to the U12/U = 1 uniform mixture for all Us/Uv ratios. For dominating scalar interactions, we observe an enlarged CDW region toward both AFM and SS phases as U12/U drops, explained by the smaller local cost of double site occupation. We additionally find a region of PI in the SS phase for U12 U . Our observations of PI are qualitatively different from the results for spinless systems [17,46], which predict stable SS phases at integer filling in 2D systems. For dominating vectorial interactions, we find extended regions of PI in the AF-SS phase.\nWith stronger interspin interactions, U12/U > 1, several fully PS phases arise. For dominating scalar interactions, we observe a fully PS CDW and PS SS. We find a fully PS SF for"
        },
        {
            "heading": "CDW",
            "text": "all Us/Uv ratios. We also observe a shrinkage of the AF-SS region as U12/U grows, explained by the increasing local cost of double site occupation with atoms of opposite spin. In contrast, the boundaries between insulating regions (PS CDW, AFM) and the PS noninsulating state (PS SS, PS SF) do not change with U12/U, as the energies of the PS phases and the AFM phase do not depend on U12.\nWe note here two limitations of our simulations. First, the identification of the different phases relies on numerical minimization [47] in a high-dimensional landscape. This can lead to spurious solutions, such as the scattered instability points in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) and the irregular phase boundaries in Figs. 2 and 3. Second, there is a small region of fully PS SS for U12 = U and Us/Uv > 1, cf. Fig. 3(b). This is due to the relatively small Hilbert space (nmax = mmax = 3) used for the simulations. We expect that a larger Hilbert space would lead to degenerate SS and PS SS solutions. Additional information on the properties of the various phases, the nature of phase transitions, and the identification of phase separation and phase instability is presented in [47]. We further validate our results with self-consistent mean-field calculations in a grand canonical ensemble [47,60].\nExcitations. The low-energy excitations provide important information about a given state of the system, as they define its dynamical response to external forces and drive transitions between different macroscopic phases. Here, we study the excitations of the AFM phase, which have no counterpart, neither in single-component BH models nor in bulk spinor Bose gases.\nL032003-4\nWe consider vanishing scalar interactions, Us = 0. In the zt/U \u2192 0 limit, the AFM hosts three different low-energy excitations [Fig. 4(a)]. The two particle-hole branches PH1 and PH2 correspond to a spin transfer to lattice sites with same and opposite parity, respectively. They yield energy gaps EPH1/U = 1 and EPH2/U = 1 + 4Uv/U above the ground state. The third excitation is a pairwise spin exchange (SE) involving two atoms with different spin. Its energy gap ESE/U = 8Uv/U can be arbitrarily tuned with respect to the PH1 and PH2 gaps by adjusting Uv .\nFor a finite zt/U , the two components of each excitation (particle and hole for PH1 or PH2; two exchanged spins for SE) delocalize in the lattice [Fig. 4(b)]. The effective excitation Hamiltonian\nHeff = \u2211 n\u2032,n \u2211 \u03b2 h\u03b2nn\u2032 ( b\u0302\u03b2n\u2032 )\u2020 b\u0302\u03b2n + H.c. (9)\ndescribes quasiparticles \u03b2 [Fig. 4(c)], defined on doublets of adjacent spin sites n, with creation operators b\u0302\u03b2n . The quasiparticles hop on a square superlattice n1a1 + n2a2 with ni \u2208 Z , n \u2261 (n1, n2), and lattice vectors a1 = (ex + ez )\u03bb/2 and a2 = (ex \u2212 ez )\u03bb/2. A change in the ground state configuration |\u2193,\u2191\u3009 of a doublet corresponds to the creation of a quasiparticle at that position. The coefficients h\u03b2nn\u2032 characterize the effective tunneling strengths (n\u2032 = n) and energies (n\u2032 = n) of the quasiparticles. They are obtained via first-order perturbation theory, by including up to fourth-order tunneling processes and doubly occupied states [47]. We find that the SE excitation energy obtains a second-order leading correction due to tunneling. In the long-wavelength limit it reads:\nESE U\n= 8 (\nUv U \u2212 2(3 \u2212 4Uv/U ) (1 \u2212 4Uv/U )(1 + 4Uv/U )\n( t\nU\n)2) .\n(10)\nIn the resulting band structure [Fig. 4(d)], all the bands are eight times degenerate, four times due to the C4 symmetry\ninvariance of the two excitation components (e.g., particle left, right, above, or below the hole), and two times due to two possible configurations of each doublet. The bandwidth of the spin-exchange branches is \u223ct4, resulting in an extremely flat band in the considered regime, t \u2248 Uv U . The bandwidths of the two particlelike branches are \u223ct2, and increase if weak mixing through a first-order tunneling process is included [47]. Additional mixing and level crossing of the four branches would arise through fourth-order interaction terms in Eq. (9), which we expect to become pronounced as tunneling is increased and the transition to the AF-SS is approached.\nConclusion and outlook. We considered an experimentally viable two-component spin BH model, featuring tunable vectorial and scalar cavity-assisted global-range interactions. Its phase diagram at unity filling exhibits both density- and spinmodulated superfluid and insulating phases. We discovered that the insulating spin-modulated phase with global antiferromagnetic order is stabilized for arbitrarily small vectorial interactions, due to their cooperation with repulsive contact interactions. These phases could be readily detected in existing experiments by a combination of cavity field heterodyne detection and time of flight imaging [21,23] as density and spin-modulated phases couple to orthogonal quadratures of the cavity field. While dominating intraspin contact interactions always lead to spatially homogeneous phases, larger interspin interactions give rise to phase separation in the SF and CDW phases. In addition, global-range interactions lead to unstable regions of density- and spin-modulated supersolid phases. The low-lying excitations above the AFM feature an additional spin-exchange branch, which delocalizes at finite tunneling strengths. A perturbative approach shows that its energy gap can be independently tuned via the vectorial interactions. The inclusion of quasiparticle interactions in the effective theory could enable an inspection of the mechanisms by which the interplay between different excitations drives the phase transitions.\nAs a direct extension, it would be interesting to study the first-order phase transition between the density- and the spinmodulated insulating phases. Two key questions there are the lifetime and decay of metastable states [22], and the spread of correlated quasiparticle excitations which might exhibit an unbounded velocity due to global-range interactions [61,62]. Moreover, regions of phase coexistence could arise when taking into account the harmonic trapping potential [11,16]. In the absence of lattices, cavity dissipation couples density- and spin-modulated states, leading to chiral instabilities and limit cycles [63\u201365]. The lattice system offers an experimentally tunable access to the boundary between density- and spinmodulated insulating phases, and can help clarify the fate of these instabilities in the Hubbard regime. This could provide a deeper understanding of the non-Hermitian dynamics in strongly-correlated quantum systems. Finally, the inclusion of spin-changing processes, such as local spin-spin interactions [52] or global cavity-mediated Raman processes [25,66], would give rise to another competing scale in the system and could induce novel phases like spin-density waves or chiral states [34,37].\nAcknowledgments.
