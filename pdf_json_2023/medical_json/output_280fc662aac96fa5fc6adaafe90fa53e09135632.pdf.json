    "abstractText": "21 Neural circuits are reorganized with specificity during learning. Genetically-defined subgroups of 22 inhibitory interneurons are thought to play distinct roles in learning, but heterogeneity within 23 these subgroups has limited our understanding of the scope and nature of their specific 24 contributions to learning. Here we reveal that the chandelier cell (ChC), an interneuron type that 25 specializes in inhibiting the axon-initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons, establishes cortical 26 microcircuits for organizing neural coding through selective axo-axonic synaptic plasticity. We 27 find that organized motor control is mediated by enhanced population coding of direction-tuned 28 premotor neurons, whose tuning is refined through suppression of irrelevant neuronal activity. 29 ChCs are required for learning-dependent refinements via providing selective inhibitory control 30 over pyramidal neurons rather than global suppression. Quantitative analysis on structural 31 plasticity of axo-axonic synapses revealed that ChCs redistributed inhibitory weights to 32 individual pyramidal neurons during learning. These results demonstrate an adaptive logic of the 33 inhibitory circuit motif responsible for organizing distributed neural representations. Thus, ChCs 34 permit efficient cortical computation in a target cell specific manner, which highlights the 35 significance of interneuron diversity. 36 37 38 39 .

            "text": "Neural circuits are reorganized with specificity during learning. Genetically-defined subgroups of 22 inhibitory interneurons are thought to play distinct roles in learning, but heterogeneity within 23 these subgroups has limited our understanding of the scope and nature of their specific 24 contributions to learning. Here we reveal that the chandelier cell (ChC), an interneuron type that 25 specializes in inhibiting the axon-initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons, establishes cortical 26 microcircuits for organizing neural coding through selective axo-axonic synaptic plasticity. We 27 find that organized motor control is mediated by enhanced population coding of direction-tuned 28 premotor neurons, whose tuning is refined through suppression of irrelevant neuronal activity. 29 ChCs are required for learning-dependent refinements via providing selective inhibitory control 30 over pyramidal neurons rather than global suppression. Quantitative analysis on structural 31 plasticity of axo-axonic synapses revealed that ChCs redistributed inhibitory weights to 32 individual pyramidal neurons during learning. These results demonstrate an adaptive logic of the 33 inhibitory circuit motif responsible for organizing distributed neural representations. Thus, ChCs 34 permit efficient cortical computation in a target cell specific manner, which highlights the 35 significance of interneuron diversity. 36 37 38 39\nIntroduction 40 The reorganization of neural circuits during learning relies on a complex interplay between 41 excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, accompanying highly specific synaptic modification. 42 Various synaptic changes contributing to this interplay have been observed at the scale of 43 individual cells and whole circuits. The observed formation and elimination of dendritic spines in 44 cortical pyramidal neurons (PyNs) during learning have suggested that learning is associated 45 with changes in neuronal connectivity 1\u20134. At the circuit level, neuronal activity is synchronized in 46 a subpopulation of neurons, resulting in a high correlation between neuronal activity patterns 47 and learned behaviors 3,5,6. It has been understood that GABAergic inhibition plays a critical role 48 in shaping learning-dependent circuit changes. Interneurons are categorized by anatomical and 49 electrophysiological features, and their distinct functions during learning have been shown in 50 genetically-defined subtypes such as parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive 51 intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons 7\u201311. However, these subtypes still contain a 52 remarkable degree of heterogeneity, such that the precise role of inhibition mediated by single-53 type interneurons remains an open question. 54 The ChC (i.e., \u2018axo-axonic cell\u2019) is a bona fide GABAergic interneuron subclass with 55 respect to its distinct axonal geometry, subcellular synapse connectivity, and fast-spiking 56 electrophysiological properties 12,13. A single ChC exhibits a characteristic axonal geometry with 57 many prominent vertical branches, which contain strings of synaptic boutons exclusively aligned 58 along the AISs of neighboring PyNs. Because the AIS is the site of action potential initiation, 59 ChCs can have decisive control over spike generation in an ensemble of PyNs, thereby 60 regulating synchrony and oscillation of network activity. These functions are thought to be 61 critical for higher-order cognitive processes like working memory 14\u201316. In this study, using a 62 transgenic mouse line specifically engineered to target ChCs, we examined the role of ChCs in 63 sculpting cortical circuits involved in motor learning. We discovered that the ChC is essential for 64 improving the direction-tuning of targeted cells by suppressing irrelevant activity at the 65 population level. ChC shaped this sophisticated inhibitory motif among a specific set of neuron 66 types. Thus, ChCs primarily take a \u201cselect and focus\u201d strategy rather than serve as a uniform 67 gain setter. 68\n69 Results 70 Improved directional control of movement on multi-textured ball maze. 71 Previous studies have shown that ChCs increased activity during locomotion 17,18. The premotor 72 cortex (M2, anteromedial agranular cortex, homologous to supplementary motor areas in the 73 primate brain) is involved in gating sensory inputs and motor outputs for movement planning, 74 fine action control, and decision-making 19\u201321. To investigate the role of ChCs in controlling the 75 activity of M2 neurons during locomotion, we used a spatial navigation task that requires goal-76 directed motor control 22. Mice were trained to traverse a multi-textured ball maze with four 77 distinctive tactile surface cues and to reach a goal spot on the ball, where a water reward was 78 given (Fig. 1a, See Methods). The task required directional motor control accurately aimed to 79 the goal spot. While animals were navigating the ball maze, we recorded neuronal activity of the 80 L2/3 premotor population using Ca2+ imaging via two-photon microscopy. Mice with water-81 restriction (experimental group) showed reward-seeking behavior on the ball maze, developed a 82 preferred pathway, and generated goal-oriented locomotion with learning whereas mice ad 83 libitum water (control group) did not (Fig. 1b). The number of successfully reaching the goal 84 spot increased in the experimental group but not in the control group (Fig. 1e). Time spent in 85 the goal (rewarded) quadrant (Q1) increased with training (Fig. 1f). We further examined the 86 relationship between motor control and reward-seeking behavioral performance by analyzing 87 the parameters of motor control. To examine whether general movement parameters such as 88 speed and acceleration could be the main cause for these improvements, we compared the 89 motor control between experimental and control conditions. The movement of the control group 90 showed similar general motor parameters (e.g., speed and acceleration) to the experimental 91 group (Fig. 1c, d). Overall latency to the reward decreased with training, indicating the 92 increased effectiveness of the animals\u2019 movements at achieving rewards (Fig. 1g). We 93 observed that mice showed increased proximity to the goal with learning, by tuning their 94 movement to the goal (Fig. 1h). The movement accuracy as the percentage of goal-aimed 95 movements increased with training (Fig. 1i), indicating that the enhanced movement direction 96 (MD) controls toward the goal spot. Mice in the experimental group showed better control in 97\nturning toward the goal during navigation than the control (Fig. 1j, k). These results indicate that 98 the directional control of movement is improved with learning. 99\n100 Motor learning refines direction coding through suppression of irrelevant activity. 101 To determine how neurons mediate precise motor control with learning, we examined direction 102 coding of M2 neurons at the cellular and population levels. To test whether M2 is required for 103 neuronal adaptation to control task-related motor behavior, we used an adeno-associated virus 104 (AAV)-based approach to express tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC), which abolishes 105 presynaptic vesicle release 23,24, in M2 excitatory neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Mice 106 expressing TeTxLC in M2 excitatory neurons (CaMKII-TeTxLC mice) showed deficits in learning 107 the task (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The reward-seeking behavioral parameters did not improve 108 with training (Extended Data Fig. 1e-j), suggesting that M2 neurons play an essential role in 109 mediating the motor learning required for the task. 110 We performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging in L2/3 of M2 with a genetically encoded 111 calcium indicator, GCaMP6s while mice navigated on the ball maze (Extended Data Fig. 2a). 112 Consistent with the established role of M2 in motor planning, overall population activity in L2/3 113 correlated with locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Individual premotor neuron activities bi-114 directionally changed in a time-locked fashion at movement onset (Extended Data Fig. 2c). 115 The majority of neurons were movement-related (total 98.0%; positively correlated: 79.7 \u00b1 3.3%; 116 negatively correlated: 18.4 \u00b1 3.2%; and not correlated: 2.0 \u00b1 0.4%; see Methods for 117 classification), and the proportion of movement-related neurons in the population remained 118 relatively constant throughout training sessions (Extended Data Fig. 2d). 119 We next measured direction selectivity of individual premotor neurons over training and 120 analyzed the changes. Distinct neuronal populations responded to different MDs (MDs) (Fig. 2a, 121 Extended Data Fig. 2e-g). A subset of L2/3 neurons exhibited tuning to the MD which was 122 defined as its preferred direction (PD). Its topological map was arranged in a salt-and-pepper 123 pattern in the M2 area (Extended Data Fig. 2i, j). 124 We estimated the likelihood distributions of neural tuning curves as a function of MD 125 (Fig. 2b). Premotor neurons showed the highest likelihood to fire at their PD. We defined 126 population tuning precision as the reciprocal of the variance of total neural activity given MD. 127\nTuning of premotor neurons to MD became more precise over sessions. The precision of 128 population responses increased for all MDs in the experimental group, but not in the control 129 group (Fig. 2c-d). We next estimated the probability of the cell being active as a function of the 130 distance between MD and the cell's PD. When the MD was far from the cell\u2019s PD (distance from 131\nPD > 90\u0970), the probability of being active decreased with learning (Fig. 2e). When the MD was 132\nopposite to the cell's PD, the probability of the cell being active was significantly lower in 133 Session 7 than in Session 1 for mice in the experimental condition, but not in the control 134 condition (Fig. 2f). 135 We took a Bayesian approach to decode the MD from neural activity (See Methods). 136 We computed the posterior probability density function to provide the most likely estimate of the 137 mouse\u2019s MD during navigation (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 3a-c). Moment-to-moment MDs 138 were decoded by the estimated MD corresponding to the maximum value of the posterior 139 probability density function. During behavior, posterior probability density functions of MD 140 sharpened over sessions in the experimental group, enhancing near the MD and waning at null 141 MDs (Fig. 2h). In contrast, posterior functions were flattened over sessions in the control group. 142 Consequently, we observed lower decoding errors in the experimental group (Fig. 2i). Similarly, 143 we tested neural coding of MD based on a population vector (PoV) as a vector sum of PDs of a 144 sparse population of active direction-tuned neurons at a given moment 25,26 (Extended Data 145 Fig. 3d). In this coding scheme, MDs were also flexibly encoded in a moment-to-moment 146 manner from the distinct sparsely distributed activity of neuronal ensembles (Extended Data 147\nFig. 3e, f). The fraction of decoded direction (PoV around 0\u0970) increased and that of anti-148\ndecoded direction (PoV around 180\u0970) decreased in Session 7 in the experimental group, but not 149\nin the control group, indicating an increased coding accuracy associated with learning 150 (Extended Data Fig. 3g-i). We further measured angular errors between the active neuron\u2019s 151 PD and MD to see how directional neuronal activity was accurately aligned with MD on a 152 moment-to-moment basis. Similar to the change in decoding error, the fraction of PD increased 153 and that of anti-PD decreased in Session 7 in the experimental mice, whereas the fraction of 154 anti-PD increased in Session 7 in the control mice, indicating that the fraction of irrelevant 155 activity reduced with learning (Extended Data Fig. 3j, k). To test whether the motor learning 156\nmediates a direction-dependent change in network connectivity, we compared pairwise 157 correlations between neuronal pairs of diametrically opposed PDs. The pairwise correlations of 158 neuronal pairs decreased in the experimental group as a function of the difference in their PDs, 159 whereas they increased over sessions in the control group (Fig. 2j). These results suggest that 160 the observed reduction of incorrectly tuned responses shapes the direction coding of the M2 161 population. 162 163 Manipulation of parvalbumin interneurons disrupts global neural activity. 164 To determine how neuronal ensembles suppress irrelevant activity during learning, we asked 165 how interneurons might be uniquely involved. Several GABAergic interneuron subtypes have 166 been hypothesized to serve specific roles in regulating cortical functions by forming circuit motifs 167 with features like recurrence and feedforward inhibition 27. We tested the regulative role of two 168 major interneuron groups that are known to form inhibitory synapses at specific compartments 169 of excitatory PyNs and comprise 70% of all cortical interneurons 28; Specifically, PV-INs inhibit 170 perisomatic regions and SOM-INs target distal dendrites 29. We bilaterally silenced activity of 171 PV-INs or SOM-INs during behavior by expressing an inhibitory opsin, eNpHR3.0, in the M2. 172 We found that inactivation of premotor PV-INs disrupted goal-directed motor performance, but 173 inactivation of SOM-INs did not, suggesting that perisomatic inhibition mediated by PV-INs may 174 be involved in circuit motifs that guide task-related directional control of movement (Fig. 3a, 175 Extended Data Fig. 4). 176 Perisomatic inhibition from PV-INs provides powerful inhibitory control over the principal 177 neuron population 29\u201332. To further examine the role of PV-IN perisomatic inhibition in local 178 neuronal activity during motor control, we abolished presynaptic GABA release from PV-INs by 179 expressing Cre-dependent TeTxLC virus in PV-Cre mice (PV-TeTxLC mice) and monitored the 180 M2 neuron activity (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the notion that PV-INs are critical regulators of 181 cortical excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance 33,34, the abolishment of perisomatic inhibition in 182 PV-TeTxLC mice led to excessively increased overall activity of M2 neurons during movement 183 (Fig. 3c-d) 35 and hypersynchronization at movement initiation, which disrupted the propagation 184 of sequential network activity and decreased the sparseness of neural activity during 185\nsubsequent movements (Fig. 3e, f). Accordingly, the pairwise correlation and the proportion of 186 pairs with positive correlations were significantly higher in PV-TeTxLC mice than in PV control 187 mice (Fig. 3g-h). A significant proportion of PV-INs also showed increased activity for 188 movement initiation (Fig. 3j), suggesting that the excessive activity of M2 neurons in PV-189 TeTxLC mice may result from unmasked responses of neurons that were previously inhibited by 190 PV-INs (Fig. 3k-n). These results suggest that PV-IN perisomatic inhibition is involved in task-191 related motor control, but this manipulation also leads to global excitability changes that limits 192 the applicability of current approaches to specify mechanisms of directional motor control. 193 194 Sparse, sequential activity is preserved in ChC manipulation. 195 In our attempt to specify the underlying mechanisms of perisomatic inhibition, we targeted ChCs 196 by using the ChC-specific transgenic mouse line (Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Ai14 as ChC control mice, 197 Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Flex-FlpO mice as ChC-Flp mice, and Vipr2-Cre) 36. This genetic strategy 198 allowed us to selectively label ChCs, including their distinctive axonal arborizations and 199 cartridge terminals (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). A larger proportion of ChCs were found in the 200 upper L2/3 of M2, with a smaller number present in L5 (mean soma depth \u00b1 s.e.m = 178.9 \u00b1 201 10.7 \u03bcm from pial surface) (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We confirmed that the axonal cartridges of 202 ChCs made synapses on the AISs of neighboring neurons (Fig. 4a). To find out if ChC 203 manipulation impacts global network excitability, we abolished presynaptic inhibitory GABAergic 204 inputs to the AISs of neighboring neurons by expressing FlpO-dependent TeTxLC (AAV9-CAG-205 dfrt-TeTxLC-HA-WPRE) bilaterally in ChC-Flp mice and monitored activity of M2 neurons (Fig. 206 4b). In contrast to the hypersynchronous neuronal activity in PV-TeTxLC mice, we did not 207 observe a global change. Instead, we observed sparse, sequential activity propagation in both 208 ChC-TeTxLC and control mice during movement (Fig. 4c, d). Pairwise correlation indicated 209 local, not global, correlated activity between neuronal pairs in both groups (Fig. 4e); The 210 proportions of pairs with positive and negative correlations were similar between the two groups 211 (Fig. 4f). In contrast to PV-INs, a majority of ChCs showed increased activity during movement 212 rather than movement initiation (Fig. 4g), and ChC-TeTxLC manipulation did not evoke the 213 excessive activity of M2 neurons at movement onset shown in PV-TeTxLC mice (Fig. 4h-k). 214\nThese results demonstrate that ChCs have a distinct activity profile from PV-INs and that overall 215 network excitability is not globally altered by silencing the activity of ChCs. 216 217 Chemogenetic inhibition of ChCs disrupts the direction selectivity of premotor neurons. 218 The TeTxLC experiments suggest that the major role of ChCs is not control of general network 219 gain, but more target-specific control of neighboring neurons. We tested whether ChC 220 suppression would affect the direction tuning of M2 neurons during the behavioral task. We 221 bilaterally expressed FlpO-dependent chemogenetic silencer (AAV9-CAG-dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry) 222 in the M2 of ChC-Flp mice to suppress the activity of ChCs upon the application of clozapine N-223 oxide (CNO), an hM4Di agonist (Fig. 5a). We first verified the effectiveness of CNO in brain 224 slices. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings showed that CNO application reduced the 225 activity of ChCs expressing hM4Di (Fig. 5b). After 7 days of training, we administered either 226 saline or CNO. CNO administration in the ChC-Flp:hM4Di mice significantly impaired goal-227 directed navigation performance and turning movement (Fig. 5c-f). CNO or saline injection 228 alone had no effect on behavioral performance (ChC-Flp:hM4Di mice with saline, ChC-Flp mice 229 with saline or CNO injection) (Fig. 5d). 230 To determine the role of ChC activity in the direction tuning of M2 neurons, we co-231 expressed AAV9-CAG-dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry and AAV1-hSyn-GCaMP6s into the L2/3 M2. We 232 then used chemogenetic manipulations and performed Ca2+ imaging of ChCs and their 233 neighboring neurons during the behavioral task. In line with the ex vivo results, ChC activity was 234 suppressed upon CNO administration during locomotion (Fig. 5g, h). Consequently, we 235 observed that the coactivity of M2 neurons increased upon CNO application during locomotion 236 but not during rest (Fig. 5i), consistent with recent work demonstrating the inhibitory 237 postsynaptic effects of ChCs on M2 neurons in vivo 17,31. We compared the likelihood 238 distributions of neural tuning curves as a function of MD with and without CNO administration. 239 We observed that neurons are more likely to be active at non-PDs in the CNO (ChC-silenced) 240 condition than in the saline condition (Fig. 5j), resulting in less precise population responses to 241 the MD (Fig. 5k, l). The probability of the cell being active at a certain MD increased upon CNO 242 administration (Fig. 5m). When the MD was at the opposite of the cell's PD, the probability of 243\nthe cell being active was higher after CNO administration than it had been in Session 7 or in the 244 saline condition (Fig. 5n). CNO application increased pairwise correlations between neuronal 245 pairs as opposed to the enhanced decorrelation between pairs seen with learning (Fig. 5o). 246 These results suggest that the suppression of ChC activity increased behaviorally irrelevant 247 neural activity, impairing the precise coding of movement. 248 249 Variability of ChC activity increases during learning. 250 To examine the activity dynamics of ChCs during learning, we expressed GCaMP6s in the L2/3 251 ChCs and recorded ChC activity while mice performed the behavioral task (Fig. 6a). Consistent 252 with previous reports 17,18, ChCs displayed increased activity during episodes of locomotion 253 (Fig. 6b), with a more synchronized pattern of activity in Session 1. In Session 7, activity 254 patterns became more diverse and desynchronous, which led to the formation of subclusters of 255 ChCs (Fig. 6c). To quantify this shift, we calculated the pairwise correlations between ChCs 256 during the behavioral task and found that the correlation decreased and ChCs formed 257 subclusters as learning progressed (Fig. 6d, e). We next examined how temporal relationships 258 between ChCs and M2 neurons change with learning. Various temporal relationships in activity 259 were shown between ChCs and neighboring M2 neurons (Fig. 6f). We calculated cell-to-cell 260 activity correlations (Pearsons\u2019 correlation) in pairs of ChCs and M2 neurons during locomotion 261 and rest epochs and compared their distributions of correlation coefficients. In Session 1, the 262 proportion of high correlation coefficient (corr(r) > 0.6) was decreased during locomotion 263 compared to rest, reflecting the increased decorrelation. In Session 7, the overall proportions of 264 positive correlation coefficient (corr(r) > 0) and of negative coefficient (corr(r) < 0) were 265 remarkably decreased during locomotion compared to rest, indicating the enhanced 266 decorrelation in gross pairs of ChC and M2 neuron (Fig. 6g). These results suggest that ChC 267 activity becomes more heterogeneous with learning and such decorrelated temporal relationship 268 between ChCs and neighboring M2 neurons implies an increased specificity of population 269 activity control. 270 271\nAbolition of ChC inhibition impairs refinement of direction coding and motor learning. 272 We asked if the abolition of ChC-mediated inhibition would affect the refinement of direction 273 coding and learning ability. We abolished presynaptic ChC GABA release by expressing FlpO-274 dependent TeTxLC (AAV9-CAG-dfrt-TeTxLC-HA-WPRE) in ChC-Flp mice, and performed two-275 photon calcium imaging in M2 neurons across sessions (Fig. 7a-c). ChC-TeTxLC mice showed 276 a deficit in learning the task, indicating the necessary role of axo-axonic inhibition for learning 277 goal-directed motor control (Fig. 7e-l). Given the vast difference in the numbers of PV-INs and 278 ChCs 37, it is possible that the suppression of a similar number of PV-INs has similar effects to 279 the effects exerted by the selective suppression of ChCs. To test this possibility, we abolished 280 the inhibition presynaptic GABA release of a fraction of PV-INs that corresponds approximately 281 to the percentage of ChCs in the premotor network (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). The sparse, 282 sequential activity was observed in sparse PV-TeTxLC mice similar to PV control (Extended 283 Data Fig. 6d). However, in contrast to ChC-TeTxLC mice, the sparse PV-TeTxLC mice showed 284 normal improvement of learned performance (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). 285 To determine the specific role of ChCs in suppressing irrelevant activity, we analyzed the 286 probabilistic distributions of neural tuning to MD as a function of learning. Compared to the 287 decrease in activity responding to non-PDs seen with learning, ChC-TeTxLC mice did not show 288 a reduced likelihood of non-PD activity over training (Fig. 7m). While the estimated probability of 289 the cell being active for non-PD movement (distance from PD > 90 degree) decreased in the 290 ChC control mice with learning, such reduction was not observed in ChC-TeTxLC mice (Fig. 291 7n). When the MD was opposite to the cell's PD, the probability of the cell being active 292 significantly decreased in the ChC-control group, but not in the ChC-TeTxLC group (Fig. 7o). 293 Consistently, we found that the decreases in pairwise correlation of neural responses with 294 learning were specific to ChC control but not ChC-TeTxLC mice (Fig. 7p). Additionally, posterior 295 probability density functions of MD were flattened over sessions in the ChC-TeTxLC group, 296 indicating impaired encoding of movement direction due to the abolition of ChC-mediated 297 inhibition (Fig. 7q). Given that intact ChC inhibition mediated the suppression of incorrectly 298 tuned responses with learning, these results collectively suggest a necessary role of ChCs in 299 refining distributed neural codes for active locomotion control. 300\n301 Heterogeneous axo-axonic synaptic plasticity underlies organized motor control. 302 Our imaging data raised the possibility that ChC inhibitory synaptic strength may not be 303 uniformly altered by learning. To understand the cellular evidence in support of this claim, we 304 examined the structural rearrangement of axo-axonic synapses as proxies for the synaptic 305 strength changes in target neurons. We developed an automated detection algorithm to discern 306 the individual structures of ChC innervation on AISs of target PyNs, by using volumetric images 307 of M2 (Extended Data Fig. 7, See Methods). A large number of inhibitory presynaptic and 308 postsynaptic ChC-AIS structures, ChC axonal boutons, and gephyrin signals (GABAergic 309 inhibitory synapse scaffolding protein) along the AISs were systematically analyzed in both the 310 experimental group (n = 1634 AISs in 5 mice) and control group with ad libitum water (n = 3116 311 AISs in 6 mice) (Fig. 8a-d). We estimated structural synaptic strength by measuring presynaptic 312 structural efficacy (Pre-SSE) as a presynaptic feature and postsynaptic structural efficacy (Post-313 SSE) as a postsynaptic feature based on ChC-AIS contacts and the corresponding gephyrin 314 intensity, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The Pre- and Post-SSE distributions showed 315 intrinsic heterogeneity in both control and experimental mice, indicating uneven inhibitory 316 weights for connections between ChCs and M2 neurons (Fig. 8d-h). These imaging results are 317 consistent with early Golgi staining and recent electron microscopy data that show non-random 318 distribution of ChC axonal terminations 18,38. The strong correlation between Pre- and Post-SSE 319 showed the balance of presynaptic and postsynaptic strengths on AIS (Fig. 8i). 320 A subset of ChCs in the prelimbic cortex was reported to selectively control PyNs 321 located more superficially (< 50 \u03bcm from L1/2 border) for their specific projection to the 322 basolateral amygdala 31. We tested whether the heterogeneity among axo-axonic synapses 323 depends on the cortical depth of AIS location. The overall synaptic strengths were not different 324 by the location of AISs in L2/3 of control mice and experimental mice (0 \u2013 250 \u03bcm from L1/2 325 border, dotted and solid lines in Fig. 8j). However, we found that high and low portions of SSE 326 distribution increased in the experimental group, suggesting that the increased heterogeneity in 327 ChC-PyN connections with learning is not solely based on the cortical depth of AIS location 328 (Fig. 8f, h). 329\nTo decipher how learning reorganizes axo-axonic inhibition on AISs, the cumulative 330 density functions (CDFs) of SSEs in the experimental group of mice were compared to the 331 control group (Fig. 8k, l). If a subset of neurons is more tightly controlled by ChCs with learning 332 (reflecting a sparse and determinant inhibitory control), we expect to see an increased 333 percentage of AISs largely covered or scarcely covered by ChC boutons, respectively. Indeed, 334 we observed an increased portion of both weak and strong ends in the distributions of pre and 335 post-SSEs in the trained mice. Classifying AISs into three subgroups by their SSE strength 336 (high, mid, and low), 4-9% of ChC-AISs underwent structural changes from mid to high or low 337 (Fig. 8m, n). To validate whether this alteration was a result of training and not of high variance 338 among samples (Extended Data Fig. 8b-e), we performed a bootstrapping test (n = 3000 339 random sampling) on the data from each mouse (Extended Data Fig. 8f-i). Obtained from 340 multiple bootstrapping tests (n = 10), changes in the SSE distributions for trained mice showed 341 increases in high (> 1.5 for Pre-SSE, > 0.6 for Post-SSE) and low (< 0.5 for Pre-SSE, < 0.1 for 342 Post-SSE) value ranges (Fig. 8o, p). We found increased divergence only between the 343 experimental and control groups (Extended Data Fig. 9f-i, Exp. vs. Ctrl.), and not between 344 other condition comparisons (Exp. vs. Exp.; Control vs. Control; Unlabeled vs. Unlabeled). The 345 alterations in each subgroup were analogous and tested as significant (Fig. 8q, r). Thus, these 346 data suggest that ChCs differentially regulate the degree of inhibition applied to each axo-axonic 347 synapse during learning (Fig. 8s). 348\n349 Discussion 350 Given the diversity of interneuron types and their specific connectivity in neural circuits, it has 351 been a longstanding belief that the impact of inhibition on neural computation depends on a 352 combination of interneuron cell-types and their connectivity patterns 30,39\u201341. Genetically-defined 353 interneuron groups such as PV, SOM, and VIP, and their connectivity motifs have profoundly 354 advanced our understanding of cortical computation and psychiatric disorders. Different 355 interneuron subtypes display their own circuit motifs, but subtypes remain widely 356 heterogeneous. Therefore, we still do not fully understand the precise and unique roles of 357 inhibition mediated by most single interneuron subtypes. 358\nDespite the discovery of ChCs over four decades ago 42 and their clinical relevance to 359 neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia characterized by GABAa receptor 360 dysregulation at AIS 43, the functional role of ChCs in cognition and behavior has been 361 enigmatic. Using a combination of chronic two-photon population imaging together with 362 analyses on the structural plasticity at axo-axonic synapses, we demonstrated a critical role of 363 the ChC in shaping the cortical coding of L2/3 M2 neurons during motor learning. ChC activity 364 was necessary for improving the precision and accuracy of directional movement control. ChCs 365 fine-tune the direction selectivity of individual premotor neurons and their collective tone. 366 Notably, global population activity was not perturbed when ChCs were blocked. The necessary 367 role of ChCs without perturbing overall network excitability implies that ChCs mediate their 368 regulatory effect by establishing a specific neuronal connectivity pattern for learning. 369 Quantification of a large number of ChC-AIS synapses uncovered revealed subsets of them 370 underwent modifications associated with learning. This analysis revealed a significant degree of 371 heterogeneity, which provides evidence of unequal inhibitory weighting among ChC-PyN 372 connections during learning. 373 Diverse interneurons have been shown to be involved in motor learning by shaping 374 neuronal population activity. Particularly, it has been shown that SOM-INs targeting the 375 dendrites and spines of PyNs in the primary motor cortex undergo plasticity during motor 376 learning and control learning-dependent sequential activation of PyNs in a manner comparable 377 to what is attributed to ChCs here 44. In addition, inhibiting SOM-INs during new learning 378 destabilized previous learning-dependent sequential activity of PyNs, suggesting the importance 379 of SOM-IN inhibition for maintaining previously learned sequential activation patterns and 380 behavioral improvement when a new motor skill task is introduced. However, in our study, we 381 observed that acute optogenetic suppression of SOM-INs did not significantly disrupt navigation 382 task performance after learning had been established (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4). Given 383 the reduced activity of SOM-IN activity during learning and partial restoration of naive-like 384 activity by post-learning SOM-IN reactivation 45, the acute post-learning inhibition of SOM-INs is 385 less likely to dominantly regulate neural representations formed with learning. We cannot rule 386 out the possibility that SOM-INs are involved in shaping learning by dendritic-specific 387\ncomputation through synaptic plasticity on the dendritic spines of PyNs. It is possible that the 388 suppression of irrelevant activity that is attributed to ChCs in the present study can be partly 389 mediated by SOM-INs via their recurrent connectivity 46. Subpopulations of SOM-INs increase 390 and decrease activities during motor learning in a task-specific manner 44. It is likely that diverse 391 and task-specific activity of SOM-INs may mediate the temporal shift of motor learning-induced 392 sequential activity in PyNs, which can complement organized population coding in sequence 393 during goal-directed navigation. 394 The abolishment of perisomatic inhibition in PV-TeTxTC mice excessively increased the 395 overall activities of M2 neurons, consistent with the notion that PV-INs are critical regulators of 396 cortical excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance 33,34. Perisomatic inhibition from PV-INs provides 397 powerful inhibitory control over the PyN population 29\u201332. Fast-spiking PV-Basket cells (PV-BCs) 398 are well suited for regulating the balance, gain and network oscillation of relatively broad PyN 399 populations 47,48. Balanced and delayed inhibition of fast-spiking INs with movement activity may 400 provide temporal sharpening of motor command and suppress irrelevant activities 35. 401 PV-BCs and ChCs have different dendritic arborizations and laminar locations of their 402 soma. They receive spatiotemporally distinct patterns of excitatory synaptic inputs from local 403 PyNs, long-range thalamocortical connections, and neuromodulatory inputs, and in turn form 404 different recurrent feedback excitation and inhibition patterns in a microcircuit 49,50. The distinct 405 wiring features and output properties of PV-BCs and ChCs may give their differential control 406 over the spike-timing of PyNs 51. Different cholinergic modulatory effects of synaptic inhibition 407 between ChCs and PV-BCs have been reported 52. Notably, a previous in vivo study showed 408 that ChCs significantly increase their firing rate during arousal when brain states switched from 409 slow to theta oscillations in the hippocampus and showed a low-amplitude desynchronized field 410 potential in the prelimbic cortex, while the firing rates of PV-BCs and PyNs remained unchanged 411 53. Given that arousal is often associated with cholinergic signaling, differential modulation by 412 cholinergic receptor activation between ChCs and PV-BCs may result in their distinct 413 contributions to population activity control in a state-dependent manner. A future study is 414 needed to further clarify the functional difference between ChCs and other types of BCs in 415 behavior control, which is important to specify the role of perisomatic inhibitory circuit motifs. 416\nOur findings support a model that ChCs exert differential strengths of control over 417 subsets of PyNs after learning. There exists substantial variability in the magnitude of ChC input 418 to PyN AISs 54,55. This variability reflects the ability of ChCs to regulate their inhibitory strength 419 based on the characteristics of its target cell, and may have a role in shaping the functional 420 properties of PyNs. Variability in the number of axo-axonic ChC synapses correlated with 421 structural features of individual target PyNs including laminar depth of the soma, other sources 422 of perisomatic inhibition, and size of soma and AIS 18. The innervated PyNs are not distributed 423 at random, but rather show a clustered distribution in a spatially heterogeneous fashion 56, 424 supporting the existence of target selectivity and/or avoidance by ChCs on local PyNs. Two 425 factors possibly select PyNs for stronger/weaker inhibition. First, ChCs differently inhibit PyNs 426 based on the projection targets of the PyNs. Recent studies showed that a subset of L2 ChCs 427 selectively innervates PyNs projecting to the basolateral amygdala over those projecting to the 428 contralateral cortex in the prelimbic cortex 31. Second, ChCs differentially inhibit PyNs in an 429 activity-dependent manner during learning 57. In this study, we analyzed a restricted subset of 430 ChCs in the L2 and sampled neighboring PyNs in the shallow part of L2/3. Deeper L2/3 PyNs 431 may have different projecting targets. Nevertheless, our findings on learning-dependent 432 changes of axo-axonic synapses in the shallow L2/3 suggest that the difference in ChC-433 mediated inhibition is not solely resulted from the anatomical properties of target neurons. Given 434 experimental evidence for the activity-dependent structural plasticity of axo-axonic synapses 58\u2013435 60, it is conceivable that the plasticity of axo-axonic synapses provides an activity-dependent 436 regulatory mechanism in the cell-by-cell level to fine-tune neuronal excitability across diverse 437 cells involved in different functional networks. This can be mediated through precise inhibitory 438 synaptic plasticity, which has been theoretically suggested as essential for the formation and 439 maintenance of functional cortical circuitry 61,62. Our findings suggest that the learning-440 dependent synaptic plasticity of axo-axonic synapses provides individualized inhibition to each 441 PyN, which is adjusted to precisely balance excitation and inhibition based on the relevancy of 442 its activity to the task goal. 443 Our measures of direction selectivity and population vector coding of MD may not fully 444 capture high-order representations such as state-dependent action selection. It is presumed that 445\nmultiple other inputs, such as cholinergic, thalamic, and other cortico-cortical inputs, innervate 446 ChCs and PyNs. Premotor mechanisms of direction selectivity coding, movement direction, and 447 inhibitory synaptic plasticity coming from different inputs remain to be studied. 448 Here we revealed a specialized inhibitory role for ChCs in experience-dependent 449 plasticity of cortical coding, which allows for flexible and robust learned behavior. Given the 450 unknown functions of a number of heterogeneous interneuron types, our results suggest that 451 such heterogeneity may have evolved to serve specific functional needs. Unraveling the 452 multitude of inhibitory effects on neural representation and signal transmission across all cell 453 types is essential for understanding how cognitive functions are internally and externally 454 governed to give rise to meaningful behavior. Precise balance and target-specific inhibitory 455 synaptic plasticity by each inhibitory cell type are thought to contribute to the formation and 456 retrieval of distributed memory, providing fundamental neural circuit architecture for learning. 457 The heterogeneity of inhibitory cell types with their diverse receptors and innervation patterns 458 offer us a glimpse into how the intricate and versatile neural coding in the cortex can be adopted 459 to generate complex and flexible behavior. Our work sheds light on the importance of future 460 studies to investigate additional single-cell type specific plasticity rules and their impacts on 461 network activity and behavior. 462 463 Methods 464 Animals. C57BL/6J, PV-Cre (Cat.# 8069), SOM-Cre (Cat.# 13044) mice, Vipr2-Cre (Cat.#: 465 31332), Ai14 mice (Cat.# 7914) from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and Swiss 466 Webster (Cat.#24) mice from Charles River Laboratory (Boston, MA, USA) were used in this 467 study (4-9 weeks old, both sexes). All mice were maintained on a 12 hr light/ 12 hr dark cycle. 468 All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by Johns 469 Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee, the Max Planck Florida Institute for 470 Neuroscience Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and National Institutes of Health 471 guidelines. For genetically targeting ChCs, Nkx2.1-2a-CreER and Vipr2-Cre mice were used. 472 Swiss Webster mice were used as the background strain for Nkx2.1-2a-CreER mice while 473 C57BL/6J mice were used as the background strain for Vipr2-Cre mice. Nkx2.1-2a-CreER and 474\nROSA-Flex-FlpO mouse lines were generated in the laboratory of Hiroki Taniguchi at the Max 475 Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. For Nkx2.1-2A-CreER mice, a 2A-CreER cassette 476 was inserted in the frame immediately after an open reading frame of an Nkx2.1 gene. The 477 targeting vector containing 5' and 3' homology arms, a 2A-CreER cassette, an frt-Neo-frt 478 cassette, and an HSV-TK gene was constructed. For FLEX-Flp mice, the targeting vector 479 containing Rosa26 homology arms, a CAG promoter, and a FLEX-Flp cassette was 480 constructed. Both targeting vectors were generated using a PCR-based cloning strategy. 481 129SVj/B6 F1 hybrid ES cells (V6.5) were electroporated with the targeting vectors and 482 subjected to drug resistance tests. Neomycin-resistant ES clones for Nkx2.1-2A-CreER and 483 FLEX-Flp were screened by mini-Southern blotting and PCR, respectively, for correct targeting. 484 Positive ES clones were used for tetraploid complementation to obtain male heterozygous mice 485 following standard procedures. Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Ai14 and Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Flex-FlpO mice 486 were generated by crossing Nkx2.1-2a-CreER with Ai14 and ROSA-Flex-FlpO mouse lines, 487 respectively. Both created ChC mice showed no visible behavioral phenotypes and were able to 488 learn the behavior task used in this study. 489 490 Tamoxifen (Tmx) administration. Tmx was administered to timed pregnant Swiss Webster 491 females that were bred to Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Flex-FlpO males by oral gavage at E17 to induce 492 CreER activity in the offspring. To achieve a high density of ChCs, the Tmx dose was adjusted 493 to 3 mg/30 g of body weight. Tmx solution was prepared at a working concentration of 20 mg/ml 494 in corn oil (SIGMA), kept protected from light, and kept refrigerated for no longer than one 495 month. 496 497 Animal surgery and stereotactic viral injection. Surgeries were performed on 4\u20138 week-old 498 mice. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic cocktail 499 containing ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) (Santa Cruz Animal Health). The 500 animal\u2019s scalp was shaved and any remaining hair was removed with a hair remover lotion 501 (Nair, Church & Dwight Co, Inc, Princeton, NJ, USA). Ophthalmic ointment (Puralube Vet 502 Ophthalmic Ointment) was applied to prevent eyes from drying. Next, the animal was placed in 503\na stereotaxic device (Kopf, Model 900 Small Animal Stereotaxic Instrument). The surgical region 504 was scrubbed by 10% betadine solution (Purdue product LP, Stamford, CT, USA) and cleaned 505 with 70% alcohol solution. Body temperature (37\u201338 \u00b0C) was maintained by a thermostatically 506 controlled heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). A small incision was made on 507 the scalp. A small craniotomy (~0.5 mm in diameter) was made above the injection site (the 508 right premotor cortex, A/P: +1.75 mm, M/L: +0.3 mm from the bregma, D/V: -0.25 mm from the 509 brain surface).

The viral constructs were injected via a beveled glass micropipette (tip size 10\u201320 \u03bcm 531 diameter, Braubrand) backfilled with mineral oil. Flow rate (100-150 nl/min) was regulated by a 532\nsyringe pump (World Precision Instruments). Following virus injection, skin adhesive (3M 533 vetbond) was applied to close the incision site. General analgesia (Buprenorphine SR, 0.6 534 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously and mice were monitored until they recovered from 535 anesthesia. Around one week later, mice were anesthetized and hair was removed. The scalp 536 was removed in a circular shape, and the surface of the skull was cleaned. A craniotomy (3.2 537 mm in diameter) was made and a glass cranial window (3 mm diameter, Warner Instruments, 538 Hamden, CT, USA) was implanted on the virus injection site and a custom-made headplate was 539 attached to the exposed skull with dental adhesive (C&B-Metabond, Parkell inc, Edgewood, NY, 540 USA). 541 542 Virus generation. To create AAV9-CAG-dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE and AAV9-CAG-dfrt-543 TeTxLC-HA-WPRE, pAAV9-CAG-dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE and pAAV9-CAG-dfrt-TeTxLC-544 HA-WPRE vectors were created by infusion of dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry and dfrt-TeTxLC-HA `R-545 products into pAAV9-CAG vectors. 293FT cells were transfected with pAAV-transfer vectors, 546 PAD-Helper vectors and pSerotypeSpecific (AAV9) plasmids using a standard calcium 547 phosphate method. After 70 hrs, cells were harvested in PBS and resuspended in 150 mM NaCl 548 and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the virus solution was spun down at 4000 x 549 g for 30 min and the supernatant was incubated in benzonase (100 U/ml) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. 550 Another centrifugation step of 4000 x g for 25 minutes was followed by filtration of the 551 supernatant through 0.45 \u03bcm and 0.22 \u03bcm. Next, the virus solution is put on top of a sterile 552 Iodixanol gradient in an ultracentrifugation tube (15%, 25%, 40%, and 60% Iodixanol in 1 M 553 MgCl2, 2.5 M KCl, 5 M NaCl in PBS). After centrifugation at 31,000 RPM for 6 hrs, the 40% 554 Iodixanol band was harvested and stored in DPBS and concentrated using 100,000 555 concentrator vials (Amicon). The virus solution was aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. 556 557 Behavior training in a floating ball maze. More than 2 weeks (19~25 d) after virus injection, 558 mice were trained to perform a tactile-based spatial navigation task while head-restrained on a 559 custom-made spherical floating ball maze 22. Mice in the water-restricted group were water-560 restricted at 1 ml per day for a week before training starts. Mice in the control group were given 561\nad libitum water access and, in addition, 2 ml of 10% sucrose were given 30 minutes before 562 training. The floating ball maze was made of an air-supported 8\u201d diameter spherical styrofoam 563 ball with quadrants that have different tactile surface textures (ex. plain, grooved, striped, and 564 grid). A simple auditory tone (8 kHz for 2 s) was delivered at the beginning and end of training. 565 During navigation, mouse movement was monitored by a CMOS camera (Thorlabs) and ball 566 movement was continuously monitored and recorded by a Bluetooth motion sensor (LPMS-B, 567 LP research) placed at the center of the ball. Mice were trained to navigate to find a hidden goal 568 location (surface area of 30 \u00b0 solid angle) in which a 10% sucrose reward (~10 \u03bcl per a reward) 569 was delivered if they were on the location. To facilitate animals\u2019 exploration, a brief air puff (60 570 psi, 200 ms) was applied to their hind limbs if they did not move for 30 seconds. The reward 571 was delivered via a lick port positioned in front of the mouse\u2019s mouth and its timing was 572 controlled by a solenoid valve (NResearch, West Caldwell, NJ, USA). To prevent excessive stay 573 within the goal location and excessive access to the goal, a 3-second refractory period was 574 assigned for the reward; Either a stay in the goal location or a re-visit to the goal location within 575 3 seconds from the last reward did not provide an additional reward. The behavioral setup was 576 controlled by a custom-written code in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Daily training 577 sessions lasted 800 seconds and occurred for 7 days. 578 579 Optogenetic inhibition of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM)-positive 580 interneurons. We bilaterally injected AAV9-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP-WPRE-hGH (400 nl, 581 Penn Vector Core) into the L2/3 M2 of PV-Cre mice or SOM-Cre mice and implanted fiber-optic 582 cannulae (200 \u03bcm core, 0.37 NA, BFL37-2000, Thorlabs) with head plates. After two weeks of 583 recovery from surgery and one week of water restriction, mice were trained on a floating ball 584 maze for a session (800 s) per day for 7 days. After 7 days of training, mice were trained for a 585 session and simultaneously received bilateral optogenetic inhibition using 589nm-light 586 administration (continuous 800 s during the session, ~10 mW power at the optic-fiber tip, MBL-587 FN-589, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronic Technology) through the fiber-optic 588 cannulae. On the following day, mice were trained without optogenetic inhibition as a control. 589 590\nChemogenetic inhibition of ChCs. We bilaterally injected a mixture of AAV1-hSyn-GCaMP6s-591 WPRE-SV40 (300 nl) and AAV9-CAG-dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry-WPRE (500 nl) into the L2/3 M2 of 592 ChC-Flp mice. After 7 days of training, to suppress the activity of ChCs expressing AAV9-CAG-593 dfrt-hM4Di-mCherry in a FlpO-dependent manner, mice were administered i.p. with clozapine N-594 oxide (CNO, Tocris, Cat.#: 4936) 45 mins before a behavioral session and underwent the 595 session. On the following day, mice were administered i.p. with saline as control and underwent 596 the session. 597 598 In vivo two-photon imaging. Imaging was conducted with a two-photon microscope (Bruker) 599 using two pulsed Ti:sapphire lasers tuned to a wavelength of 920 nm (MaiTai HP DeepSee, 600 Newport Spectra-Physics) for GCaMP6 signals or a wavelength of 1,045 nm (HighQ-2, Newport 601 Spectra-Physics) for tdTomato and mCherry signals. The calcium imaging dataset was motion-602 corrected using a custom-written MATLAB code based on a full-frame cross-correlation image 603 alignment algorithm. Regions of interest (ROIs) were semi-automatically drawn using a custom 604 algorithm based on fluorescence intensity, cell size, and cell shape by visually inspecting 605 movies, average of movies, and standard-deviation of movies, and then selecting neurons that 606 showed fluorescence transients at least once during a session. The same area was imaged 607 across training days to trace changes from same ensembles, but due to intrinsic tissue 608 movement, neuronal activity was realigned when calcium signals were analyzed. All pixels 609 within each ROI were averaged to create a fluorescence time series, F. Surrounding \u2018neuropil 610 ROIs\u2019 were drawn from 0.3 \u03bcm outside of the border of each neuronal ROI to 10.0 \u03bcm outside. 611 Neuropil ROIs excluded adjacent neuronal ROIs. Pixels within neuropil ROIs that showed 612 apparent calcium transients exceeding 3 standard deviations of the difference in fluorescence 613 between each neuropil ROI pixel time series and the neuronal ROI time series were excluded 614 from further analysis. The remaining neuropil ROI pixels were considered as background 615 fluorescence and averaged to create a time-varying background fluorescence trace. The time-616 varying baseline (F0) of a fluorescence trace was estimated by the following procedure: A 617 preliminary baseline fluorescence time series, Pre F0, was loess smoothed with 120 frames. 618 Preliminary \u0394F, Pre \u0394F, was obtained by subtracting Pre F0 from F. Noise of Pre \u0394F was 619\nestimated by subtracting loess smoothed Pre \u0394F from the standard deviation of Pre \u0394F. The 620 offset of \u0394F was determined by the mean of the distribution of Pre \u0394F that did not exceed two 621 times the noise. The baseline fluorescence trace, F0, was estimated by adding the offset to Pre 622 F0. \u0394F/F for neuronal ROIs was obtained by subtracting F0 from F and dividing it by F0. The 623 background fluorescence trace \u0394F/F for neuropil ROIs was estimated in the same manner, i.e., 624 as the \u0394F/F for neuronal ROIs. The background fluorescence trace was subtracted with a 0.7 625 weight from the neuronal ROI fluorescence trace for each neuronal ROI. For pixel-based 626 imaging analysis of MD, fluorescence change maps of images were color-coded by MD and 627 averaged. For pixel-based analysis of different movement paths, fluorescence change maps of 628 images for each movement path were differently color-coded and overlaid. 629 630 Tissue fixation, immunohistochemistry, and acquisition of confocal and light-sheet 631 microscope images. Animals were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and 632 xylazine and then perfused transcardially, first with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and 633 next with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in PBS. The brains were removed and 634 postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. For confocal microscope images, the brains were 635 embedded in 10% melted gelatin solution for 50 minutes at 50\u00b0C. Melted gelatin solution was 636 then refreshed and the gelatin solution with the embedded brains was solidified at 4 \u00b0C for about 637 30 minutes. Then, the solidified gel was trimmed around the embedded brain to a small cube 638 shape and the cube was stored into 4% PFA overnight. The gelatin cube brain was coronally 639 sectioned (100 \u03bcm thick) using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). For 640 parvalbumin immunohistochemistry, after blocking with a solution (1 % Normal Donkey 641 Serum/0.1 Triton-X in PBS), brain slices were incubated in primary antibodies (1:500 mouse 642 anti-parvalbumin, #P3088, Sigma) for 48 hours at 4 \u00b0C. After washing 3 times in PBS, the brain 643 slices are then incubated in a secondary antibody (Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, 644 Cat.#: 715-585-150, diluted 1:1,000 in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 645 hours at room temperature, followed by 3 washes in PBS. The brain slices were mounted on the 646 slide glass with a DAPI-containing mounting solution (DAPI Fluoromount-G, SouthernBiotech, 647 USA). For Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Ai14 and Nkx2.1-2a-CreER::Flex-FlpO mice 648\nimmunohistochemistry, after intraperitoneal administration of Ketamine/Xylazine mixture (50 649 mg/kg Ketamine, VETCO, 5 mg/kg Xylazine, AKORN) and a foot pinch to check adequate 650 sedation, the mice were trans-cardially perfused with 15 ml cold saline solution followed by 20 651 ml of cold 4% PFA solution in PBS. After post-fixation in 2% PFA in PBS overnight, 60 \u03bcm brain 652 sections were prepared using a Leica vibratome and collected in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% 653 TritonX-100 in PBS followed by washing for 1 h in blocking reagent (BR: 0.1% TritonX-100, 10% 654 donkey serum in PBS). The sections were treated in primary antibody solution in BR overnight 655 at 4\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: rat anti HA (1:500, Roche, #11-867-423-656 001), chicken anti GFP (1:800, ABCAM, Cat.#: ab13970), and mouse anti AnkyrinG (1:500, UC-657 Davis/NIH NEUROMAB, Cat.#: clone N106/36 75-146). After three washes (10 min) in PBS, the 658 slices were incubated in BR with secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at 659 room temperature containing appropriate fluorophores (CyX or Alexa) at 1:1000. The slices 660 were embedded in FluoromountG (Thermo Fisher) [K1] after two final washing steps in PBS. 661 The fixed and immuno-stained brain slices were imaged using an upright confocal microscope 662 (Zeiss LSM880, Germany). For light-sheet microscope images, brains were perfused as 663 described above and were coronally sectioned (2 mm thick) using a vibratome (Leica 664 Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). The brain slices were cleared using the Passive Clarity 665 protocol (Yang et al., 2014). Images of the cortex were collected with a Zeiss Light-sheet 666 microscope at 25x magnification. Light-sheet microscope image processing and 3D rendering 667 were performed with arivis Vision4D. 668 669 Preparation for acute cortical slices. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. 670 The brain was removed and rapidly placed into ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 215 671 Sucrose, 26 NaHCO3, 20 Glucose, 4 MgCl2, 4 MgSO4, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, and 1.6 NaH2PO4. 672 Cortical slices (300 \u03bcm thick) were prepared using a VT1000S vibratome (Leica). Slices were 673 incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in a holding chamber filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid 674 (ACSF) containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 675 CaCl2, and 1.3 MgSO4. Slices were then placed at room temperature and allowed to recover 676 for 1 hour before recording. All solutions were equilibrated with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2). 677\n678 Electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (electrode resistance 5-9 M\u2126) were 679 performed at room temperature using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Layer 680 2/3 chandelier cells were patched in current-clamp configuration using potassium-based internal 681 solution (in mM: 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 4 NA2-ATP, 124 K-gluconate, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 16 682 KCl, 0.4 Na-GTP, 10 HEPES) in ACSF containing (in mM: 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 683 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 1.3 MgSO4). To examine the effect of DREADD virus 684 hM4Di, we recorded the firing properties of hM4Di-expressing neurons before and after applying 685 10 \u03bcM clozapine N-oxide (CNO, Tocris, Cat.#: 4936) (in ACSF). 686 687 Data acquisition and analysis. All data analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft), and 688 custom codes and toolboxes in MATLAB. Behavioral sessions in which the mouse made more 689 than three successful accesses to the goal were analyzed. The movement signals of the ball 690 maze including quaternion and angular velocity were sampled at 100 Hz and smoothed using a 691 lowess regression of 500 ms width. We extracted animals\u2019 virtual coordinates on the ball relative 692 to the center of the hidden goal spot. We acquired mouse movement-related information based 693 on translational movement (forward and backward; right and left) by using a precise Bluetooth 694 motion sensor (LPMS-B, LP research, Tokyo, Japan). 695 696 Identification of movement bouts. We classified each behavior frame (sampled at 100 Hz, 1 697 ms bin size) as occurring during either rest or movement. We defined rest frames as those in 698 which the movement speed is less than 0.02 m/sec and acceleration is less than 0.2 m/sec. We 699 defined movement frames as those in which a movement speed is greater than 0.03 m/sec and 700 not classified as rest frames. Parameter values were determined by visually comparing videos 701 with movement speed and acceleration traces. The uncategorized frames which do not meet 702 the above criteria were further categorized as following: If both ends of the bout of 703 uncategorized frames were connected to rest frames and the duration of the bout of 704 uncategorized frames was less than 1 second, the uncategorized frames were identified as rest 705 frames. If either both ends of the bout of uncategorized frames were connected to movement 706\nframes or the state of connected frames of one end of the bout was different from that of the 707 other end, the uncategorized frames were identified as movement frames. 708 709 Movement direction. Movement direction was determined by the inverse tangent of forward-710 backward speed over right-left speed. Goal-angle was defined as the angle passing through the 711 goal spot from the mouse\u2019s two-dimensional virtual position. Goal-directed movement epochs 712 were determined if the mouse\u2019s movement direction was within the goal-angle. Percentage of 713 goal-directed movement was determined by the ratio of goal-directed movement epochs to 714 overall movement epochs. Goal-directed movement bout was identified as a bout of movement 715 in which mice pursued the hidden goal location and received the reward. Non-goal-directed 716 movement bouts were defined as bouts wherein the animal does not reach the goal. 717 718 Classification of movement-related neurons. Modulation of neural activity was frequently 719 observed between movement and rest epochs. We classified individual neurons into three 720 categories, movement-positive, movement-negative, and non-movement. Movement positive or 721 negative neurons were identified if their mean activity during movement epochs was significantly 722 higher or lower than during rest epochs, respectively. If there was no significant difference in 723 mean neuronal activity between movement and rest epochs, neurons were classified as non-724 movement cells. 725 726 Estimation of probabilistic neural tuning curves. To estimate calcium events, calcium 727 signals were deconvolved using an Online Active Set method to Infer Spikes (OASIS) with 728 FOOPSI approach and auto-regressive models with order 2. The values of calcium event 729 estimate s were threshold to 0, producing binary events that represent estimated calcium 730 events. To focus on the tuning curves of premotor neurons to movement direction, we therefore 731 excluded periods of immobility. Using this event estimate, we computed the probability of a 732 neuron to be active \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) as the period of activity of a neuron over the total period of a 733 recording session, which corresponds to the marginal likelihood probability distribution in a 734 Bayesian approach. We divided the movement direction in 5o bins. Each bin represents a 735\ndiscrete state of movement direction. We then computed the likelihood probability distribution 736 that a cell is active given movement direction, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52|\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56), as the period of activity in 737 direction state \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 over the total period in state \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56. The distribution was smoothed with a 738 Savitzky-Golay filter. To test statistical deviation from random firing patterns, we carried out a 739 bootstrapping procedure as follows. For each cell, deconvolved data were circularly shifted by 740 different random values of shifts and the likelihood probability distribution of the randomized 741 data was estimated. This procedure was repeated 100 times with different random values of 742 shifts. The mean value and standard deviation of the randomized dataset were used to compute 743 the z-scored likelihood distribution of actual data. A cell is defined as an active cell if the 744 likelihood distribution of actual data is significantly deviated from that of the randomized dataset 745 (P < 0.05). 746 Neurons were considered to be directionally tuned if they showed significant tuning with 747 movement direction (ANOVA, F test, P < 0.05) and they showed a good fit of tuning function. To 748 obtain the tuning curve, the z-scored likelihood distribution of actual data was fitted with the sum 749 of two von Mises distributions 63: 750\n\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udc4e0 + \ud835\udc4e1\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udf03\u2212\ud835\udf030) + \ud835\udc4e2\ud835\udc52\n\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udf03\u2212\ud835\udf030+180 \u2218) 751 , where R is the response to movement in a direction \ud835\udf03, \ud835\udf030is the preferred direction, and a0, a1, 752 a2, and k are fitting parameters. We estimated fitting parameters by using lsqcurvefit in the 753 Matlab function. The preferred direction \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 for neuron i was defined as the movement direction 754 corresponding to a peak in the tuning curve response. Neurons were considered to be direction-755 selective if they fit the von Mises distribution well (P < 0.05) and if their direction-selective index 756\n(DSI) defined as \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3c = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\u2212\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53+\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c was greater than 0.4, where \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53 and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c are the mean of 757 the normalized response to the preferred direction and that of the opposite direction (the 758 preferred direction + \u03c0), respectively. 759 760 Bayesian decoding analysis. In addition to the estimation of the likelihood distribution, 761 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52|\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56), we computed the probability of being in a given state of movement direction 762 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56), as the period in the direction \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56 over the total period of a recording session, 763 which corresponds to the prior probability distribution. Using Bayesian approach 64, we inferred 764\nthe posterior probability distribution function that the animal is in a movement direction given 765 neuronal activity at a time t. 766\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37|\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52|\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37) \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) = \u220f\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37) \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56) . 767 where \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37|\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) is a vector of a posterior probability distribution of behavioral states and N 768 corresponds to the number of neurons used. To decode the direction of movement, we 769 considered the direction associated with the maximum a posteriori (MAP). 770\n\u015c = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37|\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52|\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37)\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc37)\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52) 771 where \u015c is the decoded movement direction. The decoding error was computed as the angular 772 difference between the decoded and actual movement direction at the observed time. 773 774 Pairwise correlations. We calculated pairwise correlations between neuronal pairs by 775 measuring coincident events 65. For neuron \ud835\udc56, the events \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 were vectorized in a binary manner. 776 The pairwise correlation for the pair \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57 is given by 777\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 \u2219 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc57 \u2212 \ud835\udc41\u2329\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\u232a\u2329\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc57\u232a\n\ud835\udc41\u221a\u2329\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\u232a\u2329\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc57\u232a 778 , where N is the number of image frames, and \u2329\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\u232a is the expected number of events for neuron 779 i. We categorized positively and negatively correlated pairs if the CI is greater than 0 and less 780 than 0, respectively. 781 782 Automated detection of ChC-AIS. To label ChCs in M2, we injected AAV1-CAG-Flex-783 TdTomato (400nl, Addgene, Cat.#: 28306) into L2 of M2 in Vipr2-Cre mice. Once the brain 784 slices were stained with immunohistochemistry and imaged through the confocal microscope 785 described in the tissue fixation, immunohistochemistry, and acquisition of confocal and light-786 sheet microscope images section, each stack of tiled confocal images (generally 3800 X 1950 X 787 10 in pixel or 400 X 206 X 10 in \u03bcm) from three different fluorescent channels (green for 788 gephyrin puncta antibody, red for TdTomato expressed in ChC projection, and far-red for AnkG 789 antibody targeting AIS) was processed simultaneously to detect AISs innervated by axonal 790 cartridges of ChC and colocalized gephyrin puncta using a custom-written program in Matlab. 791 Features of processed images were segmented automatically by boundary detection 792 (bwboundaries function, Matlab) in each planar image of red and far-red channels after 793\nbinarization by adaptive threshold (adaptthresh function, Matlab, sensitivity = 0.08 and 794 neighborhood size = 19 for AIS, sensitivity = 0 and neighborhood size = 15 for ChC). Segments 795 in different axial planes were then filtered through several criteria including intensity, size, and 796 width and registered to recover the whole AISs or ChC cartridges. Only AISs longer than 10 \u00b5m 797 were selected for the further analysis. For each registered AIS, we overlaid its segment on 798 detected ChC cartridges in each axial plane and classified it as a ChC-AIS when any 799 colocalized area existed. For demonstration purposes, fluorescence images shown in figures 800 are maximum intensity projections of corresponding volumetric stack with pseudo-colors. 801 802 Quantification of characteristic parameters. For each detected ChC-AIS segment, we 803 calculated the lengthwise axis. Projected intensity profiles of ChC and AIS on the axis were then 804 applied to measure the total AIS length (LAIS), the ChC cartridge length (LChC), and the AIS 805 length covered by ChC (LChC_AIS). To ensure the exact LChC measurement, we extended the ROI 806 5 \u00b5m longer than the detected AIS segments we identified. Half of the maximum intensity for 807 each profile was used as a threshold for measurement. The area of ChC on AIS (AChC-AIS) was 808 calculated as the mask size for segmentation. We computed the normalized ChC-AIS size, the 809 presynaptic parameter, as 810\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc36\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc36\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc36 811 from these morphological quantities. 812 We used the particle detecting algorithm u-track 66 to identify gephyrin puncta in each plane of 813 the green channel. This algorithm fitted Gaussian kernels approximating the two-dimensional 814 point spread function of the microscope (\u03c3 = 1.5 pixel or 234 nm) around local intensity maxima, 815 where both position and amplitude were free parameters in the fit. The intensity of detected 816 gephyrin punctum is represented by a modified z-score calculated from the median and 817 standard deviation of all the detected gephyrin puncta from the tiled image. 818 To evaluate the postsynaptic strength, a detected gephyrin punctum was classified as 819 AIS-associated when its detected position resides in the boundary of a registered AIS. In the 820 same manner, an AIS-associated gephyrin punctum was labeled ChC-AIS associated when its 821 position colocalizes in the boundary of ChC on AIS simultaneously. Summation of the z-score of 822\ngephyrin puncta associated with the total AIS (ZAIS) and only a portion of ChC-AIS (ZChC-AIS) was 823 used for calculation of the corresponding gephyrin intensity, the postsynaptic parameter, as 824 follows. 825\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc36\u2212\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc46 826 The corresponding gephyrin intensity equals 1 when all the gephyrin puncta on the AIS are 827 located on the corresponding ChC. When the ChC does not have corresponding gephyrin 828 puncta on the bound AIS, its value is 0. 829 830 Statistics. 831 Statistical analyses were performed using either MATLAB (Mathworks) or OriginPro (OriginLab). 832 All statistical tests are described in the corresponding figure legends. Normality of distributions 833 was tested for each dataset using Lilliefors test to decide whether to use parametric or non-834 parametric tests. For parametric tests, two-tail Student\u2019s t-test, two-sample t-test, two-tailed 835 paired t-test, one-way ANOVA, one-way repeated measures ANOVA, and two-way repeated 836 measures ANOVA were performed to compare population means across animals and 837 conditions except where noted. For ANOVAs, Fisher post hoc tests were used for multiple 838 comparisons, When sphericity is violated, we used Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Chi-square 839 analyses were used to compare proportions. Pearson's linear correlation coefficient was used to 840 measure the correlation between two variables. For non-parametric tests, two-tailed Wilcoxon-841 Mann-Whitney test and Friedman test with Dunn post hoc tests were performed to compare the 842 population median and differences with dependent variables across animals and conditions, 843 respectively. Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to compare probability 844 distributions between groups. The number of animals and the number of cells used for analysis 845 are specified in the figures, the figure legends, and the text. 846 847 Data availability 848 Additional data that supports the findings of this study are available from the corresponding 849 author upon reasonable request. 850\n851 Code availability 852 The code for semi-automated ROI selection can be found at 853 https://github.com/fitzlab/CellMagicWand.

Evaluation of ChC-AIS synaptic structural efficacy. (a) Automatically detected segments were processed to extract quantities as the total AIS length (L AIS ), the ChC cartridge length (L ChC ), the AIS length covered by ChC (L ChC_AIS ), the area of ChC on AIS (A ChC-AIS ), and z-scored intensity of gephyrin puncta on AIS and ChC-AIS (Z AIS and Z ChC-AIS ) for characterization. Those quantities were used to compute the defined characteristic value of presynaptic structural efficacy (Pre-SSE) and postsynaptic structural efficacy (Post-SSE). Every image represents the maximum intensity projection of the corresponding volumetric stack (Details in Methods). (b-e) Normalized histograms of Pre-SSE and Post-SSE from mice in the control group (n = 6 mice) and the experimental (learning) group (n = 5 mice). (f-i) We performed a random sampling test (n = 3000) repetitively (10 times) to compare individual distributions after training. The difference in probability was significant between the Experimental and Control condition (E vs C). We did not observe any significant difference between any other pair (random sampling from the Control and Control (C vs C), Exp. vs. Exp. (E vs E), or Unlabeled vs. Unlabeled (U vs U)). The distributions were compared by a two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test."
