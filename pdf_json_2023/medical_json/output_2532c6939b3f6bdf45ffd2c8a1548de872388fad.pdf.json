    "abstractText": "In mammals, skeletal muscle development is a complex biological process regulated by many factors. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification plays an important role in many biological processes. However, the regulation of m6A on skeletal muscle growth and development in adult goats remains unclear. In this study, Duan goats (DA) and Nubia goats (NBY), both female and 12 months old, were selected as the research objects, and m6A-Seq and RNA-Seq were mainly used to detect the difference of m6A modification and gene expression during the development of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle in the two breeds. The results showed that compared with DA, the meat production performance of NBY was better than that of DA, and the modification level of m6A was higher than that of DA in LD. The m6A-Seq of LD indicated m6A peaks were mainly enriched in the coding sequence (CDS) and stop codon. A total of 161 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and 1294 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in two breeds. GO and KEGG analysis showed that DMGs were closely related to cellular metabolism, and most of DMGs were enriched in pathways related to energy metabolism, muscle growth and development, mainly MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and CGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The DEGs were significantly enriched in actin binding, calcium ion binding, angiogenesis, and other biological processes, and most of them were enriched in PI3K-Akt and CGMP-PKG signaling pathways. Combined analysis of m6A-Seq and RNA-Seq data revealed a negative correlation between differentially methylated m6A levels and mRNA abundance, and mRNA expression of the gene with m6A peak near 3\u2032UTR will decrease. In addition, 11 DMGs regulating cell differentiation, muscle growth and development were identified. This study displayed the m6A profiles and distribution patterns in the goat transcriptome, determined the potential role of m6A modification in muscle growth and provided a new reference for the further study of goat skeletal muscle development.",

            "text": "RNA modifications are a form of regulation at the post-transcriptional level and play an important regulatory role in cellular function and gene expression [1]. To date, more than one hundred different RNA modifications have been identified in eukaryotes [2]. The internal modifications of mRNA mainly include N6-methyladenosine modification (m6A), N1-methyladenosine modification (m1A), 5-Methylcytosine modification (m5C), etc. The N6-methylladenosine (m6A) is the most common methylation modification in mRNA [3\u20136], which is involved in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism and mediates a variety of life processes [7\u201310], widely present in various eukaryotes, such as mammals, plants, Drosophila and yeast. Similar to DNA and histone methylation, m6A methylation is dynamic and reversible. M6A occurs through the methyltransferase complex (writers), which consists mainly of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and other components [11], and then is removed by the demethylases (erasers) FTO and ALKBH5 [12,13]. M6A binding proteins (readers) recognize m6A modified bases [14,15], thereby activating downstream regulatory pathways and mediating mRNA splicing, export, translation and degradation [9,10,16\u201320].\nFoods 2023, 12, 1159. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12061159 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 1159 2 of 18\nThe m6A modification is indispensable in regulating gene expression and participating in various bioprocesses, including the regulation of skeletal muscle development in animals [21]. The skeletal muscle tissue in adult animals accounts for about 40\u201360% of body weight [22], and it is the main source of meat products for livestock. The growth rate of skeletal muscle determines the meat production, and the meat production determines the livestock production [23,24]. In recent years, with the deeper understanding of RNA methylation and the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, the regulatory role of mRNA m6A methylation in animal skeletal muscle and muscle cell development has been gradually revealed. Tao X et al. used m6A sequencing to identify that m6A-modified genes of wild boar\u2014Landrace and Rongchang pigs\u2014were breed specific in longissimus dorsi (LD), and exerted different physiological functions in different breeds [25]. Dang Y et al. found by m6A-Seq that m6A modification was involved in the growth and development of beef cattle LD tissue, and the differentially expressed m6A genes were mainly involved in skeletal muscle contraction, steroid biosynthesis process and REDOX process [26]. Petrosino JM et al. discovered that the skeletal muscle size of mice during hypertrophy was related to the increase in METTL3 and m6A levels [27]. In goat longissimus muscle, differential gene GADD45B screened by m6A-Seq can activate p38 MAPK pathway to drive muscle differentiation [28]. In summary, m6A modification plays an important regulatory role in skeletal muscle. However, so far, m6A has been studied relatively little in large livestock goats, and its distribution within the transcriptome of adult goat skeletal muscle has not been reported, which greatly hinders the exploration of m6A mechanisms in goat skeletal muscle. Duan goats (DA), produced in Duan Yao Autonomous County, is one of the local excellent breeds raised in Guangxi of China. Raising DA has always been the main source of economic income for the Duan people. DA\u2019s coat color is all white, all black or hemp color, and the meat is delicate but grows slowly and does not produce much meat. Meat production trait, as an important economic trait affecting production efficiency, has been a research hotspot in the field of goats genetic breeding. The meat production performance of goats is mainly reflected by carcass weight, net meat weight, dressing percentage and other indicators [29,30]. The weight of adult DA is about 20\u201340 kg, with a dressing percentage of 40\u201344% and a net meat percentage of 29\u201334% [31]. In contrast, Nubian goats (NBY), which were introduced to China from the Nubian region of Africa, grow much faster. Adult NBY have a higher pre-slaughter body weight, dressing percentage and net meat percentage than DA. The phenotypes of the two breeds are significantly different. At present, the level of m6A modification and the distribution of m6A transcriptome range in the skeletal muscle of DA and NBY is not clear, nor is it clear whether m6A is involved in regulating meat production in goats. Here, we obtained the first transcriptome-wide m6A methylation profile in DA and NBY by m6A-Seq and elucidated the features of m6A modifications in the skeletal muscle of adult goats. We analyzed the regulatory differences of m6A modifications in the two breeds, and identified some differential m6A genes that regulate muscle differentiation and were involved in skeletal muscle growth and development. This work will help to understand the effects of m6A modification for skeletal muscle in goats, and provide a new reference for exploring the role of m6A in skeletal muscle and the mechanism of meat production in goats."

To further determine the regulation role of m6A modification in muscle growth and analyze the functional pathway of m6A gene in LD development, we conducted GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis for the m6A genes.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1159 8 of 18\nGO enrichment analysis results showed that common m6A genes were mainly involved in protein phosphorylation, oxidation-reduction process, positive regulation of cell population proliferation and positive regulation of gene expression (Table S5; Figure 3A). The unique m6A genes of NBY were associated with regulation of transcription, positive regulation of cell population proliferation, positive regulation of gene expression and multicellular organism development (Table S6; Figure 3B). However, the unique m6A genes of DA were associated with the protein ubiquitination, intracellular signal transduction and positive regulation of GTPase activity (Table S7; Figure 3C). KEGG pathway analysis results showed that common m6A genes were mainly enriched in MAPK signaling pathways, insulin signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway and TGF\u2212beta signaling pathway (Table S8; Figure 3D). The unique m6A genes of NBY were mainly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway (Table S9; Figure 3E), which were related to muscle growth development and energy metabolism. However, the unique m6A genes of DA were mainly enriched inositol phosphate metabolism, tight junction and glucagon signaling pathway (Table S10; Figure 3F). These results indicated that m6A modification had a regulatory function for muscle growth and development in goat. In the NBY vs. DA, more than 60% of the differential methylation peaks occurred in the exons of the transcripts (Figure 4A). A total of 164 differential methylation peaks were screened, and 161 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified. Among them, 55 differential methylation peaks were up-regulated, which was associated with the expression of 54 DMGs, and 109 differential methylation peaks were down-regulated, which was associated with the expression of 107 DMGs. GO biological processes analysis results showed that total DMGs were mainly involved in blood circulation, muscle system process and regulation of GTPase activity (Table S11; Figure 4B). The up-regulated DMGs were related to embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis, embryonic skeletal system development and embryonic organ morphogenesis (Table S12; Figure 4C). The down-regulated DMGs were related to the regulation of muscle system process, carbohydrate metabolic process, regulation of muscle contraction and blood circulation (Table S13; Figure 4D). Moreover, KEGG pathway analysis showed that total DMGs were enriched mainly in the Wnt signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway (Table S14; Figure 4E). These results suggested that DMGs play an important role in regulating muscle development in goats."

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "In this study, we mainly performed transcriptome-wide analysis of DA and NBY skeletal muscle tissues by m6A-Seq, constructed m6A modification profile of goat skeletal muscle, and determined that m6A modification was involved in the regulation of muscle growth and development in goats. In addition, we confirmed that DMGs present in DA and NBY muscle tissues are enriched in pathways and bioprocesses associated with muscle development. The dressing percentage and net meat percentage can reflect the meat production performance of the animals. The dressing percentage and net meat percentage of NBY were significantly higher than those of DA, indicating that NBY have faster growth and development of muscle tissue and higher meat production. Earlier studies have shown that the increase in meat production in animals was inseparable from skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and the process of skeletal muscle hypertrophy was accompanied by up-regulation of m6A methyltransferase expression and elevated abundance of m6A modification [27]. As such, we detected the expression levels of methyltransferases METTL3, METTL14 and demethylase ALKBH5 in DA and NBY by WB. WB results showed that the protein levels of METTL3 and METTL14 were higher in NBY than in DA, whereas the level of ALKBH5 was lower. High expression of METTL3/14 and low expression of ALKBH5 may affect the abundance of m6A modifications in skeletal muscle [34]. LC-MS/MS is one of the scientific methods for detecting the overall modification level of m6A [35]. We detected the overall level of m6A in LD muscle by LC-MS/MS and found that the level of m6A modification were higher in NBY than that in DA. NBY had higher m6A modification level and meat production, indicating that m6A modification level in goat skeletal muscle may be positively correlated with muscle hypertrophy and meat production. We speculate that DA belong to the local breed in Guangxi, and the breeding of selection is low, with muscle growth and development being slow [31]. NBY are an imported breed with a high breeding of selection, and muscle growth and development is rapid [36]. Therefore, for NBY, more genes related to muscle growth and more regulatory mechanisms are needed during development; m6A is eukaryotic epigenetic modification, which may play a regulatory role in muscle growth and development [28]. The level of m6A modification usually has a constant range in the organism, and its drastic changes can affect the normal physiological processes of the organism. In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and mice, the content of mRNA m6A in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was about 0.4%\u20130.8% [37], and in mouse spermatozoa it was between 0.3% and 0.8% [38]. In this work, the m6A modification level of NBY and DA LD muscle was detected to be 0.08%\u20130.11%, which was lower than that of Arabidopsis thaliana and mice. This difference may be caused by different detection methods, different species or different tissue samples. The mRNA m6A sites of the goat were mainly enriched around stop codon, CDS and 3\u2019UTR. Their distribution was similar to that previously reported\nFoods 2023, 12, 1159 14 of 18\nin humans and mice [8]. By counting the base arrangement of the m6A peak region, we found that m6A modification was more likely to occur on the conservative sequence GGACU, and the m6A methylation process of other mammalian mRNAs also required this motif [37,38]. The m6A modification profiles of NBY and DA were very similar, and their modification characteristics were highly consistent with those of human beings, rats, pigs and other eukaryotes reported previously, indicating that m6A was highly conservative in most species. GO analysis explored the unique m6A methylation genes of two breeds. NBY-unique m6A methylation genes, regulated by m6A modification, were involved in transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation and positive regulation of gene expression; these processes were associated with muscle growth and development. However, DA-unique m6A methylation genes, which were involved in intracellular signaling and protein ubiquitination, were less enriched in muscle-related bioprocesses. The unique m6A modification genes were involved in the regulation of different pathways and physiological processes in the two breeds, which may determine their different muscle phenotype. Most importantly, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 161 DMGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways closely related to muscle growth and energy metabolism, such as the Wnt signaling pathway [39], cGMP-PKG signaling pathway [40] and MAPK signaling pathway [41]. Previous studies have proved that Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in maintaining myogenic differentiation and promoting myogenesis in human and mouse data [42,43]. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, myogenic cells lacking \u03b2-catenin exhibited delayed differentiation, whereas myoblasts with constitutively active \u03b2-catenin underwent precocious growth arrest and differentiation, and a precise level of \u03b2-catenin activity was essential for regulating the amplification and differentiation of muscle stem cell descendants during adult myogenesis [44]. In addition, the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 under hypoxia, in murine skeletal myoblasts, led to the activation of MyoD through the non-classical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, promoting myotubular hypertrophy [45]. Furthermore, the overexpression of Wnt5a and circSNX29 activated the non-classical Wnt5a/Ca2+ pathway, facilitated myogenic cell differentiation and inhibited cell proliferation [46]. The cGMP-PKG signaling pathway was involved in the modulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle [47] and the stimulating effects of cGMP on glucose transport required the activation of PKG in muscle cells [48]. As one of the most important pathways of energy metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway plays a crucial role in in the formation, regeneration, movement and injury repair of skeletal muscle [49,50]. To summarize the above findings, we concluded that activating the Wnt, cGMP-PKG and MAPK signaling pathways through DMGs may perform a key function during the development and differentiation of goat muscle tissues. In the work, association analysis showed that m6A modification abundance was negatively correlated with gene expression levels, which was consistent with two previous studies [51,52]. We also found that the expression of genes containing more than three m6A sites was much lower than that of genes containing one or two m6A sites, suggesting that m6A can regulate the degradation of mRNA [53]. Importantly, among the 34 genes with significant differences in m6A peak and RNA level screened by association analysis, 12 genes related to muscle growth and development were the focus of our attention. TBC1D15, a highly conserved protein belonging to TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16), functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab proteins and affects glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by regulating the glucose transporter protein GLUT4 [54]. DOK2 is a key regulatory gene of the insulin signaling axis and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle [55]. NFATc4, a member from the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFATs) transcription factor family, plays a pivotal role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. NFATc4 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate the expression of hypertrophic genes [56]. MTPN is a myotrophin factor. During the process of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, myotrophin promotes myotube hypertrophy and increases myotube diameters while inhibiting myoblast proliferation [57]. FAT1 cadherin,\nFoods 2023, 12, 1159 15 of 18\nas a regulator of muscle morphogenesis, is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration [58]. GOLGB1 is associated with growth and carcass traits of animals, and the 65-bp indel in GOLGB1 can be used as a molecular marker to improve breeding efficiency [59]. DOCK5 (cytokinin 5) is required for myoblast fusion during embryogenesis in vertebrates [60]. For CLUAP1, CRISPR/cas9-mediated CLUAP1 knockout revealed a new phenotype that affects the actin cytoskeleton [61]. Uptake of macrophage-derived glutamine by satellite cells through glutamine transporter SLC1A5 (solute vector family 1 member 5) activates mTOR and promotes proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells [62]. CHRNE is one of the most common genes responsible for congenital myasthenic syndromes, and mutations can lead to muscle hypotonia, weakness or developmental delays [63]. ALMS1 is associated with myocyte differentiation and cell cycle control [64]. These genes have different regulatory effects and are associated with muscle growth and development, indicating the potential mechanism of functional genes regulating goat skeletal muscle development."
