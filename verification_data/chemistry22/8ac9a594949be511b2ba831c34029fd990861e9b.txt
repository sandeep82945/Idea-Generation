"Given the importance of Nsp4 in PRRSV replication and pathogenesis, we employed computational and MD approaches to screen and identify natural compounds as novel inhibitors of Nsp4 activity. The results identified four possible lead compounds that represent potentially effective drug-like inhibitors for application as antiviral therapeutics."
