 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Optimize the dissection sites of the new ALucs to improve the performance of the single-chain BL probes. The current probes showed weaker intensity compared to NanoLuc, so finding the optimal split sites could enhance the signal. 

2. Test the new ALucs as reporters in other protein-protein interaction systems besides ER-LBD binding. Expanding the utility to other PPI pairs would demonstrate broader applicability.

3. Perform directed evolution on the new ALucs to further tune the bioluminescent properties. This could shift the colors, increase intensity, or improve stability.

4. Determine the crystal structures of the new ALucs to gain insights into the structural basis of the optical properties. This could guide future rational engineering efforts. 

5. Develop new coelenterazine analogs to further expand the spectral diversity of the new ALucs. Modulating the substrate could lead to additional red-shifted colors not currently accessible.
