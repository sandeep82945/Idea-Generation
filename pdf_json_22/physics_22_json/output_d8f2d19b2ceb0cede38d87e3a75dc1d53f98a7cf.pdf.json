During bacterial cell division, the tubulin-homolog FtsZ 17 polymerizes into treadmilling filaments that further assemble into a cytoskeletal ring. 18 Although minimal in vitro assays have shown the striking self-organization capacity of 19 FtsZ filaments, such as dynamic chiral assemblies, how these large-scale structures 20 emerge and relate to individual filament properties remains poorly understood. To 21 understand this quantitatively, we combined minimal chiral active matter simulations 22 with biochemical reconstitution experiments. Using STED and TIRF microscopy as well 23 as high-speed AFM, we imaged the behavior of FtsZ filaments on different spatial scales. 24 Simulations and experiments revealed that filament density and flexibility define the 25 local and global order of the system: At intermediate densities, flexible filaments organize 26 into chiral rings and polar bands, while an effectively nematic organization dominates for 27 high filament densities and for mutant filaments with increased rigidity. Our predicted 28 phase diagram captured these features quantitatively, demonstrating how filament 29 flexibility, density and chirality cooperate with activity to give rise to a large repertoire 30 of collective behaviors. These properties are likely important for the dynamic 31 organization of soft chiral matter, including that of treadmilling FtsZ filaments during 32 bacterial cell division. 33\n2\n34 Introduction 35 In active systems, the emergence of large-scale order relies on a combination of local 36 interactions between components and microscopic energy consumption. One typical 37 property of such self-organizing systems is spontaneous motility of their constituents. 38 For example, cytoskeletal filaments can be transported due to the activity of motor 39 proteins or move due to treadmilling polymerization dynamics. Dynamic interactions 40 between active constituents can lead to complex collective behavior and phases not found 41 at equilibrium, which have been under intense experimental and theoretical 42 investigation in the past decade1\u20137. Reconstituted mixtures of actin or microtubule 43 filaments with motor proteins self-organize into moving swarms, vortices, and travelling 44 waves1,5,8. In living systems, such emergent behaviors can underlie a wealth of key 45 biological phenomena such as single and collective cell motility9,10, cell division11 and 46 organism morphogenesis12,13. 47 Active matter systems can be classified according to the symmetry of its 48 constituents (e.g. polar or nematic)14\u201316. In particular, chiral active matter has recently 49 attracted attention, where the constituents are either asymmetric in shape or perform a 50 circular self-propelled motion. This includes curved cytoskeletal filaments, asymmetric 51 synthetic swimmers or cell types displaying chiral motions on 2D substrates17\u201319. 52 However, how to relate the microscopic properties of active constituents to the large-53 scale outputs relevant for biology remains an outstanding challenge in the field16. For 54 instance, biological settings often involve highly dense systems with attraction, as well as 55 deformable constituents which can change their shape as a function of external forces or 56 crowding6. How flexible constituents self-organize and how their local deformability 57 contributes to large-scale collective features remain poorly understood, both 58 theoretically and experimentally. 59 One example of treadmilling filaments are polymers formed by the protein FtsZ, a 60 tubulin homolog that organizes cell division in almost all bacterial, and some archaeal, 61 species20,21. FtsZ forms single stranded filaments that grow from one end and shrink from 62 the opposite end22, driven by the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). FtsZ 63 filaments can also interact laterally, which facilitates the condensation of filaments from 64 a diffuse organization into a tight ring-like structure called the Z-ring23\u201326.

FtsZ also 66 forms treadmilling filaments in vitro, which organize into cytoskeletal patterns of moving 67 bands and chirally rotating rings28. While lateral interactions between treadmilling 68 filaments play an important role for Z-ring assembly in living cells and the emergence of 69 cytoskeletal structures in vitro, the physical properties and interaction rules of 70 treadmilling filaments on a membrane surface are currently not well known. Here, by 71 studying the self-organization of FtsZ filaments at different spatial and temporal scales, 72 we elucidate the quantitative principles that govern the emergence of different collective 73 cytoskeletal organizations from the local interactions of active constituents. 74 75 Modes of FtsZ filaments self-organization at different densities 76 To understand the properties of FtsZ filament bundling, we first explored experimentally 77 the phase space of possible organizations of FtsZ filaments as a function of their density. 78 We used a previously established in vitro reconstitution assay, where treadmilling FtsZ 79 filaments are recruited to the surface of a supported bilayer by the membrane anchor 80 FtsA28. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we could record 81 the emergent behavior of the membrane-bound filaments. We found that we could 82 control the density of membrane-bound FtsZ filaments by changing the FtsZ 83 concentration in the buffer solution. When we increased the FtsZ bulk concentration from 84 around 0.6 to 5 \u00b5M while keeping the FtsA concentration constant, the fluorescence 85 intensity of FtsZ on the membrane increased linearly until it saturated at concentrations 86 higher than 3 \u00b5M (Supplementary Fig. 1a). At the same time, we found that the large-87 scale organization of the filaments changed with their density (Fig. 1a, Supplementary 88 Movie 1). 89 At FtsZ concentrations lower than 0.6 \u00b5M, individual filaments traveled across the 90 membrane surface28. These filaments were too short to measure their intrinsic curvature 91 by fluorescence microscopy, but maximum intensity projections of time lapse movies 92 revealed that their trajectories followed a curved path corresponding to a circle with a 93 diameter of 1.16 \u00b5m \u00b1 0.35 \u00b5m and heavily biased in the clockwise direction (Fig. 1b, 94 Supplementary Fig. 1b). 95 When we increased the FtsZ bulk concentrations to 1.25 and 1.5 \u00b5M, FtsZ 96 filaments organized into chiral rotating rings that persisted for around 5-6 min and 97 coexisted with comet-like structures and moving bundles of treadmilling filaments as 98\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

When we calculated the directional autocorrelation of 99 cytoskeletal flows, we found a long decay time of 16 and 68 seconds at 1.25 and 1.5 \u00b5M 100 FtsZ respectively, consistent with persistent, long-range polar motion of filament 101 bundles. In fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments we found that the 102 mean lifetime of FtsZ monomers in filament bundles was only around 7 s, suggesting that 103 their directional motion is a collective property of the system (Fig. 1c, Supplementary 104 Fig. 1c). 105 At bulk concentrations of 3 \u00b5M and higher, filaments densely covered the 106 membrane surface without apparent large-scale organization or directional movements. 107 FtsZ filaments still continuously exchanged monomers at these high densities, with a 108 recovery half-time of around 15s (Supplementary Fig. 1d). 109 These features were also recapitulated using time-lapse stimulated emission depletion 110 (STED) microscopy. Compared to TIRF microscopy, STED provided higher resolution but 111 did not allow for long-term imaging of the filament pattern. It still showed that rings form 112 preferentially at intermediate densities, and are comprised of many transiently 113 interacting FtsZ filaments (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Movie 2, Supplementary Fig. 1e). 114 The apparent weak interactions between filaments suggest that their local polar 115 orientation is an emergent property of the ensemble, rather than the result of highly 116 specific static interactions, such as residue contacts between individual filaments 117 (Supplementary Fig. 1f, g). 118 Together, these observations and quantifications show that there are density-119 dependent transitions of the large-scale organization and motion of treadmilling 120 filaments. 121 122 Collective filament organization as a function of bending rigidity and attraction. 123 Given our experimental findings that single FtsZ filaments displace along curved, chiral 124 paths, and previous theoretical work showing that non-adhesive chiral self-propelled 125 filaments could organize into ring-like phases at intermediate densities2, we explored 126 whether a minimal coarse-grained model could quantitatively reproduce the observed 127 phenomenology. To explore the limits of strong adhesion, high densities and low bending 128 rigidity, we modeled this system on a mesoscopic level by a collection of overdamped 129 self-propelled semi-flexible filament bundles in two dimensions29,30 (see section Material 130 & Methods for more details on the simulation framework). Each semi-flexible filament 131\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

In the following, 134 we use the flexure number29 \u2131, defined as the ratio of self-propulsion forces to bending 135\nrigidity \u2131 = %&'(\n)\n*+,-. , as a measure of filament flexibility (inverse of rigidity). To account for 136 the observed chirality, filaments are considered to have spontaneous signed curvature 137 with rest angle /0. An effective thermal noise force 1*23 4 accounts for the many sources of 138 noise in the system (Fig. 2a). Finally, based on previous studies of FtsZ filament-filament 139 interactions26,32,33 and our own observations (Fig. 1d), we considered mid-range 140 attractive interactions between filaments (Vpair). 141 We observed that the filament self-organization was markedly different with 142 varying filament flexibility (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Movie 3). 143 In the case of very rigid, curved filaments, ring-like patterns and vortices dominated the 144 system throughout the experimentally explored density range. However, this was not the 145 case for semiflexible filaments, which displayed two density-driven transitions as seen in 146 experiments. Moreover, in this regime we could observe a co-existence, both temporal 147 and spatial, of chiral rings and nematic-like, straighter traveling bands characterized by 148 low spontaneous curvature. Interestingly, this was in strong qualitative agreement with 149 our experimental observations, where filaments can adopt a wide range of curvatures 150 even at intermediate densities34 and where rings are interspersed with less ordered 151 filament assemblies (Supplementary Fig. 1e). In addition, as in our experimental data, 152 we observed dynamical interconversion between ring and band patterns (Fig. 2c, 153 Supplementary Fig. 2b, Supplementary Movie 4). At the other extreme, filaments with 154 very low bending rigidity deformed too easily and formed only rare and unstable chiral 155 rings at all density tested. Together, this phase diagram argues that filament flexibility 156 could be a key parameter for FtsZ self-organization. 157 More quantitatively, by analyzing the average filament curvature in our 158 simulations, we found that the nature of self-organization in high densities was markedly 159 different with varying filament flexibility (Fig. 2b, d). In the case of very rigid filaments, 160 even above the critical density where well-defined rings disappeared in simulations, we 161 found that individual filaments were still highly curved and could self-organize into spiral 162 patterns. These were characterized by the presence of +1 topological defects and 163\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

However, semiflexible filaments displayed 164 pronounced decrease in their average curvature with increasing density, so that they 165 formed effectively an active nematic phase, characterized by spontaneous appearance 166 and movement of +1/2 and -1/2 topological defects (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Movie 5). 167 Before turning to a more quantitative assessment of the match between data and 168 modelling, we also investigated the effect of attraction and noise (Peclet number) for the 169 phase diagram. For low attraction, we systematically observed a transition from 170 disordered patterns to rings above a critical density, as previously reported2. 171 Interestingly however, for strong FtsZ attraction, this transition was largely lost, with 172 rings able to form even at the lowest experimental densities (Supplementary Fig. 2c, 173 3a), similarly to the case of very rigid filaments. From a physical perspective, this is due 174 to ring formation being energetically favored, instead of being an active kinetic state in 175 the case of purely repulsive self-propelled filaments. The Peclet number also strongly 176 affected the first transition, as well as the overall density of rings in the system 177 (Supplementary Fig. 2d, 3b). Above a second threshold of density, we could observe in 178 all cases a loss of ring patterns. 179 180 Quantitative comparison between model and experiments. 181 To more systematically and quantitatively compare simulations and experiments, 182 we first sought to constrain model parameters. From our observations of single-filament 183 trajectories (Fig. 1b) and previously published values28,35 we considered a treadmilling 184 speed of v0 = 0.04 5m/s, and estimated the packing fraction of filaments 6 based on our 185 calibration experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The aspect ratio of filaments in our 186 mesoscopic simulations corresponded to bundles with thickness of 5 FtsZ filaments of 187 length 400 nm (see section Material & Methods for more details on parameter 188 estimation). Estimation of filament chirality based on curvature of single-filament 189 trajectories was noisy and limited by the resolution of fluorescence microscopy, but still 190 allowed us to guide parameter space by estimating /0 to yield the single-filament rotation 191 diameter of 500-1000 nm, as well as a lower bound for the Peclet number of ~100 192 (Supplementary Fig. 3k). Therefore, after this parameter estimation, we were left with 193 only three fitting parameters, which we systematically explored in our simulations: the 194 adhesion strength 7 , the filament flexibility measured by flexure number \u2131 and noise 195 strength measured by Peclet number Pe. 196\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Firstly, we could quantitatively reproduce not only 199 the two thresholds of appearance and disappearance of rings as a function of density, but 200 also the absolute probability of ring formation in the intermediary density region (Fig. 201 2g). Strikingly, when measuring ring life-time (normalized by period of filament rotation) 202 in both experiments and simulations, we found excellent agreement with our predicted 203 parameter regime (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Finally, our simulations 204 predicted that the diameter and thickness of rings should monotonously increase with 205 density, a feature in agreement with the data (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). Overall, 206 this demonstrates that the transitions seen in the data as a function of density can be 207 quantitatively explained by a simple theoretical framework of flexible chiral active 208 filaments. Interestingly, this analysis suggests FtsZ filaments being much more flexible 209 than previously anticipated2,30 . This prompted us to test more directly how FtsZ filament 210 conformation changes at the microscopic level as a function of increasing density. 211 212 High-speed-AFM imaging of dynamic FtsZ filaments 213 As fluorescence microscopy was not sufficient to visualize individual filaments inside of 214 dense filament bundles, we applied high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) on 215 treadmilling, membrane-bound filaments, which allowed temporal imaging of biological 216 samples at high lateral resolution down to 2-3 nm and at up to 20 frames per second36,37. 217 We were able to image individual filaments that dynamically moved across the 218 membrane surface and increased in density during the course of the experiments. These 219 filaments rapidly moved in and out of the field of view, which made it difficult to track 220 individual filaments over time. However, these time-lapse movies confirmed that 221 neighboring filaments did not form stable lateral contacts; instead they displayed fast 222 lateral fluctuations on the membrane surface (Fig. 3 a, Supplementary Movie 6). This 223 suggests that the attraction energy was comparable or smaller to fluctuations, consistent 224 with our numerical simulations. We could also reconstruct filament shape as a function 225 of density. Interestingly, we found a gradual decrease in filament curvature as a function 226 of overall surface density, which fitted well our theoretical prediction for semiflexible 227 filaments (Fig. 3b). At the highest densities, filaments had no discernable intrinsic 228 curvature and showed hallmarks of active nematics, such as spontaneous formation of 229\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

This confirms that their organization at high densities is governed 231 by nematic rather than polar filament-filament interactions. 232 233 Testing the model by changing filament conformation 234 Since our theory suggests that semiflexible filaments and intrinsic chirality are crucial to 235 explain the density-dependent transitions that we observed experimentally, we sought 236 to challenge it further by using constituents with altered properties, i.e. straight filaments 237 with enhanced bending rigidity. We reviewed previously described FtsZ mutants and 238 identified FtsZ L169R as an interesting candidate protein. This mutant was previously 239 described to have increased lateral interactions, as it shows enhanced bundling in vitro 240 and in vivo38,39. We used Alphafold40,41 predictions of a FtsZ-FtsZ dimer using the crystal 241 structure of FtsZ filaments from Staphylococcus aureus as a template42 and found that the 242 positively charged Arginine residue at position 169 is in fact located at the longitudinal 243 interface, facing towards a negatively charged Glutamic acid residue at position 276 of 244 the neighboring monomer (Fig. 4a). Accordingly, the L169R mutation could result in an 245 additional salt-bridge between two monomers in the filament, which could straighten 246 and stiffen the resulting filaments. Indeed, our HS-AFM experiments with this FtsZ 247 mutant confirmed our hypothesis and also revealed a number of key differences from the 248 wildtype protein. First, while wildtype filaments moved in and out of the field of view, 249 filaments of FtsZ L169R mutant protein appeared to be more static. This loss of mobility 250 suggests that their kinetic polarity is perturbed (Supplementary Movie 7). We indeed 251 found that many filaments displayed bidirectional growth and sudden shrinkage events 252 rather than treadmilling behavior. Second, our HS-AFM experiments showed that single 253 filaments appeared to have lower intrinsic curvature and less fluctuations than filaments 254 of the wildtype protein even at very low densities (Fig. 4b). When we analyzed the shape 255 of individual filaments at different densities, we found that the curvature of wildtype 256 filaments decreased two-fold with increasing density, while mutant filaments were 257 almost straight at all densities studied (Fig. 4c). At the same time the persistence and 258 contour lengths were about two times higher for FtsZ L169R filaments and further 259 increased with their densities (Fig. 4d, e). We also found that mutant filaments showed 260 transient filament interactions and height profile similar to the wildtype filaments, but 261 with a two times smaller mean filament distance (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c)38. 262\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity. It is made available under a preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in\n9\nGiven that we previously had assumed a local polar order between filaments in 263 our mesoscopic bundle simulations, we now wanted to test the effect of the filament 264 properties of FtsZ L169R. We thus quantified local filament-filament alignment in toy-265 simulations with different filament parameters. Interestingly, we found that all changes 266 observed in the FtsZ L169R mutant (longer, less chiral, or more persistent filaments with 267 slower treadmilling) went in the same direction of decreasing polar filament alignment 268 (Supplementary Fig. 4e-h). Combining these three experimentally observed static 269 properties thus predicted a strong decrease of local polarity sorting (Fig. 5a, b, 270 Supplementary Fig. 4d, Supplementary Movie 8). We then examined the experimental 271 large-scale patterns of mutant FtsZ filaments via TIRF microscopy. FtsZ L169R 272 polymerized into a cytoskeletal network of dynamic filament bundles at concentrations 273 between 0.6 \u00b5M and 3 \u00b5M (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Movie 9). We found that while the 274 mutant reached saturation on membranes with FtsA similarly to the wildtype, its 275 turnover was 2-3x slower and that it hydrolyzed GTP 3x slower compared to the wildtype 276 (Supplementary Fig. 4i-k). Furthermore, we did not observe any directional flows or 277 chirally rotating rings on the membrane surface. In addition, differential imaging did not 278 generate directional moving speckles, confirming that local polar arrangement of 279 filaments is strongly impaired (Supplementary Fig. 4l)35. These features were well-280 recapitulated by the same large-scale bundle simulations as before, but with the HS-AFM-281 derived properties for the mutant filaments: longer, less chiral and more persistent 282 filaments with slower kinetics Fp (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Movie 10). Altogether, this 283 shows that our simplified model can provide a powerful framework to link the local 284 microscopic structure of active filaments to the large-scale collective phases that they 285 form as a function of density. 286 287 Discussion 288 In this study, we have identified density-driven transitions in the self-organization of FtsZ 289 filaments between three phases: a low density disordered phase where individual 290 filaments treadmill in a chiral manner with little interactions, an intermediate density 291 phase where coherent chiral vortices form - as previously shown theoretically and 292 experimentally2,28,30 , and a high density phase where individual filaments straighten and 293 where the system displays a uniform, nematic-like organization. Using a minimal model 294\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

We find that the 300 experimental system is consistent with intermediate values of both parameters, as 301 filament flexibility in particular significantly modifies ring statistics and lifetimes. With 302 semiflexible filaments, we observe indeed a competition between chiral shape, active 303 treadmilling and inter-filament interactions, which at intermediate densities results in 304 the co-existence and interconversion of chiral vortices and nematic-like traveling bands. 305 This recapitulates well our experimental observations made on different spatial scales: 306 while TIRF and STED microscopy allowed us to visualize the large-scale spatiotemporal 307 dynamics of FtsZ filaments - and thus the transitions between different phases - HS-AFM 308 revealed the behavior of individual filaments at different filament densities on a 309 membrane surface. This data confirmed that the transition from chiral vortices to a 310 nematic-like organization with increasing density goes along with straightening of the 311 filaments, arguing for a relatively low FtsZ bending rigidity. 312 Furthermore, we demonstrated that a local perturbation, in this case a specific 313 residue in the primary sequence of a protein, can dramatically change both individual 314 filament properties and collective self-organization. Specifically, we found that the 315 presence of an additional salt bridge between two monomers in filaments of FtsZ L169R 316 increases their rigidity and lowers their intrinsic curvature. As a consequence, this 317 mutant does not show a density dependent transition between different phases and 318 instead always displays achiral, non-directional large-scale cytoskeletal networks. FtsZ 319 L169R was originally described as bundling mutant that shows enhanced lateral 320 interactions38,39. Our data suggests that enhanced lateral interactions are a consequence 321 of mutant filaments being longer, more rigid and straighter and that the closer contact 322 between them is only a secondary effect. The lack of a preference for a polar orientation 323 of straight filaments are also in agreement with the observation of aberrant rings and 324 spiral structures of FtsZ L169R found in vivo38. Although the intrinsic curvature of 325 wildtype FtsZ filaments is much lower than that of MreB43 and FtsA filaments44, it could 326\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

At the organismal scale, malaria parasites 330 have been shown to have flexible rod-like shape and migrate actively in a chiral manner 331 with different parasites having opposite chirality. This leads to sorting based on chirality, 332 which is favored by mechanical flexibility46. Starfish embryos, although spherical in 333 shapes, have also recently been shown to swim in a chiral manner, and collectively form 334 crystal-like structures with odd elastic behavior47. At the cellular scale, chirality can bias 335 the active nematic instabilities observed in confluent monolayers 48 and biofilms49. This 336 has further been proposed to arise from cytoskeletal organization, due to the polar 337 helicoidal structure of active filaments50, highlighting the need to a better understanding 338 of the collective dynamics bridging different scales. In particular, it would be interesting 339 in the future to investigate more complex models of filament treadmilling, for instance 340 incorporating finite lifetimes or stress-dependent polymerization. Furthermore, our 341 experimental and theoretical data suggests that weak and transient lateral interactions 342 lacking any apparent biochemical specificity are sufficient for the alignment of 343 treadmilling filaments on a membrane surface. Indeed, in vivo filaments in the Z-ring can 344 move either in the same or opposite direction51,52 and recent experiments in Bacillus 345 subtilis suggest that filament treadmilling facilitates their encounters promoting 346 condensation of filaments into the Z-ring23. Relying on weak, non-specific interactions 347 instead of specific residue contacts is therefore likely advantageous for the cell as it 348 allows for the condensation of the Z-ring, while still permitting its dynamic 349 reorganization. The relatively low bending rigidity that we observe for FtsZ could also be 350 key to allow the Z-ring to adapt to the decreasing diameter of the constricting cell septum. 351 Overall, our study highlights how minimal models of active matter based on symmetries 352 can provide quantitative insights into fundamental biological functions. 353 354\n355\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Movies correspond to Fig. 2b. 557\n558 Supplementary movie 4: Temporal coexistence of rings and bands 559 Temporal coexistence of chiral rings and polar bands in a small system (L = 42 d) of 560 intermediate density (6 = 0.5) and filament flexibility (\u2131 = 40). With increasing density, 561 the ring state becomes unstable and filaments organize only in bands. Filaments are 562 colored according to the orientation of the bond vectors between beads. Movie 563 corresponds to Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2b. 564\n565 Supplementary movie 5: FtsZ topological defects 566 Topological defects in high filament density (6 =0.9) and small system size (L = 42 d). The 567 rigid filaments (\u2131 = 5) form spiral (+1) topological defects, whereas semiflexible 568 filaments (\u2131 = 40) form only nematic defects (+1/2 and -1/2) due to the filament 569 straightening. Only bonds of the filaments (without the full diameter of beads) are 570 presented for clarity. Filaments are colored according to the orientation of the bond 571 vectors between beads. Movies correspond to Fig. 2e,f. 572\n573 Supplementary movie 6: HS-AFM time-lapse movies of FtsZ WT 574 HS-AFM movies of FtsZ WT filaments. As the density of FtsZ WT filaments on the 575 supported lipid bilayer increases, they become less dynamic and straighter. At high 576 densities, the filaments show a nematic order with topological defects. Time-lapse movies 577 were acquired with 3 and 2 frames per second.

FtsZ L169R is 2x longer and more rigid, non-chiral and has lower self-589 propulsion than FtsZ WT, resulting in 3x lower Peclet number and 2x lower flexure 590 number. Only bonds of the filaments (without the full diameter of beads) are presented 591 for clarity. Filaments are colored according to the orientation of the bond vectors 592 between beads. 593 594 Supplementary movie 9: TIRF time-lapse movies of FtsZ L169R 595 TIRF time-lapse movies of Alexa488-FtsZ L169R at increasing concentrations ([FtsA] = 596 0.2\u00b5M). FtsZ L169R does not form rings as seen for FtsZ WT and the pattern appears less 597 dynamic. Movies were acquired at 0.5 frame per second and correspond to Fig. 5c. 598 599 Supplementary movie 10: Large-scale simulations of FtsZ L169R 600 Large-scale simulations with increasing concentration of FtsZ L169R. The FtsZ L169R 601 filaments are non-chiral, 2x longer and more rigid than FtsZ WT and are self-propelled 602 with 8x lower speed, resulting in Pe = 200 and \u2131 = 20 and filament persistence length 2x 603 longer than FtsZ WT. FtsZ L169R does not form rings and self-organizes into less dynamic 604 pattern. Filaments are colored according to the orientation of the bond vectors between 605 beads.

This was followed by extensive washes with double-619 distilled H2O, 10 min sonication in ddH2O and again washing in ddH2O. The coverslips 620 were used within one week and were stored in ddH2O water. Furthermore, before 621 coverslips were used to form supported lipid bilayers, they were dried with compressed 622 air and treated for 10 min with a Zepto plasma cleaner (Diener electronics) at maximum 623 power. As reaction chambers we used 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes missing the conical end, 624 which were glued on the coverslips with UV glue (Norland Optical Adhesive 63) and 625 exposed to ultraviolet light for 10 min. 626 627 Preparation of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) 628 DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-629 phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)), which were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, at a ratio of 630 67:33 mol% were used. The lipids in chloroform solution were mixed inside a glass vial 631 in the appropriate volumes and dried with filtered N2 for a thin lipid film. Remaining 632 solvent was removed by putting the lipids in a vacuum desiccator for 2 h. Afterwards 633 swelling buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4] and 300 mM KCl) was added to the lipid film to 634 obtain a lipid concentration of 5 mM. After incubating the suspension for 30 min at room 635 temperature, the multilamellar vesicles were vortexed rigorously and freeze\u2013thawed 636 (8x) in dry ice or liquid N2. The liposomes were tip-sonicated using a Q700 Sonicator 637 equipped with a \u00bd mm tip (amplitude = 1, 1 second on, 4 seconds off) for 25 min on ice 638 to obtain SUVs. Finally, the vesicles were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 g and the 639 supernatant was stored at 4 \u00b0C in an Argon atmosphere and used within one week. 640 641 Preparation of supported lipid bilayers (SLB) for TIRF 642 SLBs were prepared by diluting the SUV suspension to a concentration of 0.5 mM with 643 reaction buffer supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2. SLBs were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C 644 and non-fused vesicles were washed away by 8x200 \u00b5L washes with reaction buffer 645\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The membranes were used 646 within 4 hours. 647 648 Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy 649 Experiments were performed using a Visitron iLAS2 TIRF microscope, equipped with a 650 100xOlympus TIRF NA 1.46 oil objective. The fluorophore Alexa488 was excited with a 651 laser line at 488nm. The emitted fluorescence from the sample was filtered using a Laser 652 Quad Band Filter (405/488/561/640 nm). A Cairn TwinCam camera splitter equipped 653 with a spectral long pass of 565 nm and a band pass filter of 525/50 nm was used. Time 654 series were recorded using Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD (512 x 512 pixels, 16 x 16 655 \u03bcm2) operating at a frequency of 5 Hz. 656 657 Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy 658 STED microscopy was performed at room temperature on an inverted Expert Line STED 659 microscope (Abberior Instruments) with pulsed excitation and STED lasers. A 640 nm 660 laser was used for excitation and a 775 nm laser for stimulated emission. A oil immersion 661 objective with 1.4 NA (Olympus, UPLSAPO 100XO) was used for image acquisition. The 662 fluorescence signal was collected in a confocal arrangement with a pinhole size of 0.8 airy 663 units. For detection a 685/70 nm bandpass filter (Chroma, #F49-686) and a photon 664 counting avalanche photodiode (Laser Components, Count-T100) were used. The pulse 665 repetition rate was 40 MHz and fluorescence detection was time-gated. Data were 666 acquired with 10 \u03bcs pixel dwell time and 30 nm pixel size for time lapse imaging and 20 667 \u00b5s with 20 nm pixel size for overview images, 5 \u2013 6.5 \u00b5W excitation laser power and 30 \u2013 668 40 mW STED laser power. The power values refer to the power at the sample, measured 669 with a slide powermeter head (Thorlabs, S170C). A spatial light modulator (SLM) 670 imprinted the STED phase pattern for lateral resolution increase. Image acquisition and 671 microscope control were performed with Imspector software version 14.0.3052. 672 673 High speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) 674 A laboratory-built tapping mode (2 nm free amplitude, \u223c2.2 MHz) high-speed atomic 675 force microscope (HS-AFM) equipped with a wide-range scanner (6\u00b5m x 6\u00b5m) was used 676 to visualize the dynamics of the system. BL-AC10DS-A2 (Olympus) cantilevers were used 677 as HS-AFM scanning probes. The cantilever has a spring constant (k) of 0.1N/m and a 678\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The dimensions of the 679 cantilever are: 9 \u00b5m (length), 2 \u00b5m (width), and 0.13 \u00b5m (thickness). To achieve high 680 imaging resolution, a sharpened and long carbon tip with low apical radius was made on 681 the existing tip of the cantilever using electron-beam deposition (EBD) as described 682 previously54\u201356. Scanning speed varied from 0.2s to 5s per frame. The number of pixels 683 acquired were adjusted for every measurement depending on the scan size (min: 2nm, 684 max: about 50nm). The in-house designed program \u201cKodec\u201d was used to read the data 685 generated by HS-AFM. The ware stores all parameters, calibration and description given 686 during the measurement and allows to load a whole folder or several movies. 687 688 FtsZ TIRF and STED experiments on SLBs 689 To study the organization of increasing concentrations of treadmilling FtsZ filaments on 690 supported lipid bilayers, we used 0.2 \u03bcM FtsA and increasing concentrations of Alexa488-691 FtsZ wt or L169R (0.625/1.25/1.5/3/5 \u03bcM) in 100 \u00b5l of reaction buffer. Additionally, the 692 reaction chamber contained 4 mM ATP/GTP and a scavenging system to minimize 693 photobleaching effects: 30 mM d-glucose, 0.050 mg ml\u22121 Glucose Oxidase, 0.016 mg ml\u22121 694 Catalase, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM Trolox. Prior addition of all components a corresponding 695 buffer volume was removed from the chamber to obtain a total reaction volume of 100 696 \u00b5l. The FtsZ filaments was imaged by TIRF at one frame per two seconds and 50 ms 697 exposure time. 698 699 STED microscopy exposes fluorescent labelled proteins to a much higher laser intensity 700 compared to TIRF and imposes bleaching and photo-toxic effects on the FtsZ filaments. 701 We adjusted our imaging setup accordingly to avoid bleaching and photo-induced 702 bundling of FtsZ filaments. First we replaced Alexa488 with Atto633, a widely used STED 703 dye with higher photon yield and improved resistance to bleaching. Furthermore, we 704 optimized the scavenging solution used for imaging: 60 mM d-glucose, 0.10 mg ml\u22121 705 Glucose Oxidase, 0.032 mg ml\u22121 Catalase, 20 mM DTT and 2 mM Trolox. Finally, we 706 changed the acquisition protocol to pixel-step based excitation/STED cycles. Here, we 707 introduce short breaks in between the excitation cycles as follows: 5\u00b5s excitation/STED 708 - 10\u00b5s break - 5\u00b5s excitation/STED - 10\u00b5s break57. Together, these changes allowed us to 709 observe the same behavior as in TIRF microscopy experiments, but with increased 710 resolution for longer than 10 minutes. For the experiments shown, we used 0.2 \u00b5M FtsA 711\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

In the time-lapse montages shown in S1 the FtsZ pattern was 712 imaged at one frame per five seconds. 713 714 Preparation of SLBs for HS-AFM 715 SUVs were prepared as described above. An ultra-flat muscovite mica layers (1.5 mm \u00d8) 716 substrate was mounted on a glass stage using a standard 2-component glue. The glass 717 stage was then attached to the scanner with a thin film of nail polish. A drop of acetone 718 was deposited on the stage/scanner interface to ensure a flat nail polish layer. The 719 mounted stage was dried at RT for about 30 min. A fresh cleaved mica layer was used as 720 substrate to form a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) by depositing ~4 \u00b5L of a mix of 1 mM 721 SUVs suspension in reaction buffer with additional 5mM CaCl2. To avoid drop breakage, 722 the scanner was flipped upside down and inserted in a custom-made mini-chamber with 723 a thin water film at the bottom (a 500 \u00b5L tube cut on the bottom and glued to a petri dish). 724 The drop was incubated on the stage for at least 30 min. After, the drop was exchanged 725 5-10 times with 5\u00b5L of fresh reaction buffer. The stage was immediately inserted in the 726 HS-AFM chamber containing about 80\u00b5L of the same reaction buffer. Prior to the addition 727 of the proteins, HS-AFM imaging and indentation were performed to assess the quality of 728 the SLB. When the force-distance curve showed the typical lipid bilayer indentation 729 profile (~2-4 nm) the SLB was used in the next steps. 730 731 FtsZ HS-AFM experiments on SLBs 732 The selected proteins (FtsZ WT or L169R, FtsA) were added to the chamber with 733 ATP/GTP (4mM each) and DTT (1mM) (final concentrations). Optimal protein 734 concentration and ratios were tested as well for a range of ~0.3-4.5 \u00b5M for FtsZ and 0.05-735 1.2 \u00b5M FtsA. 736 737 Image processing and analysis 738 For data analysis of TIRF and STED experiments, the movies were imported to the ImageJ 739 Version 2.9.0/1.53t 58 software and raw, unprocessed time lapse videos were used. The 740 contrast of micrographs in the manuscript was adjusted to improve visibility of filaments. 741 HS-AFM data was exported to ImageJ, where the post-processing, such as noise reduction 742 and smoothing, was carried out. Noise reduction and smoothing were performed using a 743\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Analysis of HS-AFM 744 movies was performed in MatLab, using the AFM analysis package FiberApp59 (Version 745 2017b of MatLab). HS-AFM micrographs in the manuscript are raw data, where the 746 contrast was optimized for best quality. 747 748 FtsZ intensity analysis 749 To estimate the saturating coverage of FtsZ on SLBs we titrated bulk FtsZ concentrations 750 from 0.625 \u2013 5 \u00b5M in two independent experiments on the same day, to avoid any changes 751 in the power of the microscope. After reaching equilibrium (20 minutes), we measured 752 the intensity at three different field of views at each concentration. Finally, we normalized 753 these intensity values by a min-max normalization and fitted a Hill Fit : = ; + (> \u2212754\n;) \u2217 ( B-\n*- + CD), where A is the starting point, B the ending point and n the Hill coefficient 755 (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3j). 756 757 FtsZ trajectory analysis 758 To estimate the diameter of trajectories of FtsZ single filaments, we performed a 759 maximum intensity projection of selected regions of interest (ROI) showing isolated 760 single filaments. Next, a circle was manually drawn on top of the filament trajectory and 761 its diameter measured (Fig. 1b). 762 763 Differential imaging and directional autocorrelation 764 To quantify at the directional flows of the FtsZ filament pattern, we used a previously 765 developed automated image analysis protocol35. In this routine, we first track the 766 growing ends of FtsZ filament bundles and then compute the directional autocorrelation 767 from these trajectories. The corresponding correlation coefficient is obtained by 768 computing the correlation of the angle between two consecutive displacements as a 769 function of an increasing time interval (\u2206t) and is a measure for the local directional 770 persistence of treadmilling trajectory i. The autocorrelation curves were best fitted 771 assuming a fast and slow decay, whose rates were extracted by fitting a two-phase 772 exponential decay : = E1 \u2217 G(HIJ\u2217K) + E2 \u2217 G(HIM\u2217K) , where a1, a2 are the starting points 773 and b1, b2 are the fast and slow decay rates. The two half times of the two-phase 774\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

To obtain the recovery half-time 780 we used a Jython macro script for ImageJ (Image Processing School 8 Pilsen 2009) to fit 781 the fluorescence recovery with N(O) = E(1 \u2212 GHIK), where I(t) is the intensity value 782 corrected for photobleached effects. FRAP experiments were acquired with an exposure 783 time of 50msec and an acquisition time of one frame every 1 second (Supplementary 784 Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3i). 785 786 Collision angle analysis from STED movies 787 The angle of FtsZ filaments collision was measured using the Angle tool of ImageJ. Three 788 points, corresponding to the incoming FtsZ and the center point of the collision, 789 respectively, were manually set. The subsequent alignment (parallel or antiparallel) was 790 evaluated manually (Supplementary Fig. 1g). 791 792 Quantification of GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ 793 To measure the GTPase rate of FtsZ WT and L169R we used the commercially available 794 EnzCheck kit (ThermoFisher, E6646). The protein was buffer exchanged into phosphate 795 free SLB reaction buffer (150mM KCl, 50mM Tris, 5mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). The proteins were 796 then diluted to 5\u00b5M together with the 20x reaction buffer of the kit, the SLB reaction 797 buffer, MSG and PNP. The reaction was incubated for 15 minutes to remove any traces of 798 free phosphate with the PNP. Subsequently 200\u00b5M GTP were added and the production 799 of free phosphate by FtsZ was measured. The appropriate controls (Buffer + GTP, Buffer 800 + FtsZ WT/L169R) were measured simultaneously and subtracted from the Buffer + FtsZ 801 WT/L169R + GTP curves. The rates are extracted from the slope of the initial linear 802 increase from 0-5 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 4k). 803 804 Ring analysis 805 Ring density: the number of rings in a given field of view were manually counted after 806 averaging every 40 seconds of a time lapse movie (Fig. 2g). 807\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Next, we 809 obtained the fluorescence intensity profile across the ring diameter using and further 810 analyzed this profile by background intensity subtraction and fitting a double Gaussian 811 function with the Scipy module [2]. From this fit, the ring width can be obtained as the 812 full width at half maximum (FWHM) averaged over the two peaks. The outer and inner 813 diameters were computed as distances between the corresponding FWHM values. The 814 outer diameter of rings was reported and compared to simulations (Fig. 2i, 815 Supplementary Fig. 3g). 816 Ring lifetimes were obtained by first preparing a kymograph along the diameter of a 817 ring and then measuring the length of two parallel vertical lines corresponding to the 818 lifetime or the ring (Fig. 2h). 819 820 Single filament analysis 821 HS-AFM movies were imported to FiberApp59 and FtsZ filaments were traced. To simplify 822 the tracking of FtsZ filaments, we used the A* pathfinding algorithm with 100 iterations. 823 Furthermore, we used the open contour type, and the parameters were: Alpha = 10, Beta 824 = 10, Gamma = 20, Kappa1 = 20, Kappa2 = 10. The fiber intensity was measured directly 825 on the analyzed frame. After fitting all filaments within one frame, we extracted the 826 persistence length (Lp) from calculating the mean-squared end-to-end distance :M = 4 \u2217827\nQR \u2217 [C \u2212 2 \u2217 QR \u2217 T1 \u2212 G H\nU\nV\u2217W&X]. The contour length was extracted by measuring the 828\naverage length distribution of all frames within a specific FtsZ density. The local 829 curvature was extracted directly from the xy-coordinates of the filaments, obtained from 830 Fiber app. Subsequently, we averaged the local curvatures of each filament to obtain one 831 curvature value per filament at different densities (Fig. 3c, 4c-4e). 832 833 Numerical simulations 834 The simulations of FtsZ filaments are based on the self-propelled worm-like chain 835 model31, extended for polymer chirality (Fig. 2a). A filament is represented by N+1 beads 836 with radius a0 connected by N stiff bonds and chiral bending potentials. To minimize 837 friction between the polymers the bond length is chosen to be equal to a0, leading to 838\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The dynamics of filaments was 881 governed mainly by two dimensionless numbers, namely the Peclet number 882\n|G = 1RQ}\nM\nd~ 883 and flexure number 884\n\u2131 = 1RQ}\n\u00c4\ndIaD` 885 Unless stated otherwise, the simulation parameters to model FtsZ WT were: Pe = 900, \u2131 886 = 40, kbond = 1000 kBT/d2, ! = 1, kbend = 53.5 kBT/rad2, bending angle /0 = 3.08 rad, effective 887 temperature for the thermal noise force 0.215 kBT and rcut = 1.7d. Since the directional 888 motion of filament bundles are consistent with microscopic polar ordering of filaments 889 (Fig. 1d), we modelled filaments with length Lf = 8 d, with aspect ratio corresponding to 890 bundles with thickness of 5 FtsZ filaments31 To compare with experiment the reduced 891 simulation units were recalculated with constants 1d = 50nm (corresponding to filament 892 length FtsZ WT Lf = 400 \u00b5m and filament curvature 3.48 rad/\u00b5m) and v = 78.5 s 893\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

We define 894 packing fraction as 6 = NNfdr0/L2, where Nf refers to the number of filaments and L to 895 the box size. The simulated filament densities ranged from 6 = 0.05 to 6 = 0.9. The 896 parameter space was explored by varying Nf , kbend, s, and effective temperature kBT to 897 alter filament density, flexure number, attraction and Peclet number, respectively. 898 To check if our explored parameter space is reasonable, we performed a few sanity 899 checks. We computed the persistence length of filaments in our simulations from the 900 distribution of local filament curvatures in intermediate density57. Lp was obtained by 901\nfitting a Gaussian function to local curvature data and extracting its variance: QR = J\n\u00c5V\u00c7\u00c9 , 902 where t is the standard deviation of Gaussian function and \u0394\u00d1 is the filament contour 903 spacing61. The resulting values Lp = 6753 nm for FtsZ WT (Supplementary Fig. 3j) and 904 Lp = 11527 nm for FtsZ L169R (Supplementary Fig. 4m) agrees well with our HS-AFM 905 analysis (Fig. 4d). We also checked the order of magnitude of Peclet numbers of FtsZ WT 906 in our simulations (Supplementary Fig. 3k) by comparing the single-filament 907 trajectories to experimental trajectories from TIRF data (Fig. 1b). 908 The simulations of active filaments were initialized in a nematic configuration 909 (each filament was placed on the lattice in a straight configuration randomly oriented 910 either left or right). The initial time needed for the equilibration of the system (4v) is 911 discarded in the analysis. Parameter screening and subsequent simulations, which were 912 focused on the molecular detail (temporal interconversion of rings and bands in Fig. 2c, 913 topological defects in Fig. 2e,f, polarity sorting in Fig. 4a,b) were performed with a box 914 size L = 42 d, whereas all the reported large-scale patterns were simulated in the box of 915 size L = 212 d. 916 To get a well-mixed state of non-chiral filaments with lower Fp (Fig. 4a,d), the 917 system was initiated in low density (6 = 0.25 and lower) on a lattice in a nematic 918 configuration with high thermal noise force (Pe = 100). The denser systems were 919 initialized with enlarged boxes of density 6 = 0.25, and after mixing of the filaments, 920 these systems were down-scaled and equilibrated in a stepwise manner, to reach a high-921 density system with effectively random initil conditions. 922 The large-scale simulations (Fig. 2b, 4d) were run for 20 v, whereas the small 923 systems, where temporal interconversion of individual rings and bands was quantified 924 (Fig. 2c), were run for 40 v . Finally, polarity sorting simulations (Fig. 4a,b) were run for 925\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Each combination of parameters was run in 926 at least 10 repeats for small system sizes and 5 repeats for larger systems. 927 928 Simulation analysis 929 Unless stated otherwise, simulation frames were analyzed with frequency of 0.2 \u03c4 after 930 the equilibration. The average filament curvature (Fig. 2d, 3b) was computed by first 931 calculating the mean curvature of each filament and then averaging it over a single 932 snapshot of the system. The resulting distribution of the average curvatures consists of 933 pooled data over both multiple simulation time points and simulation repeats. 934 To automatically detect rings in the system the instantaneous centers of rotation were 935 computed for each filament in each analyzed snapshot. These points were subsequently 936 clustered using Freud library39,58 with distance threshold related to the density of the 937\nsystem (cutoff defined as half of average distance between filaments: '\nM\u00d6l( ). Clusters with 938 more than 10 members and normalized radius (given by radius of gyration / cluster size) 939 lower than 0.1 d were considered to be ring centers. To filter out unclosed rings, the 940 normalized polarity (given by norm of the vector summing the filament orientations / 941 cluster size) of filaments belonging to a ring was computed and had to be lower than 942 0.25 d (Supplementary Fig. 3h). Since stable rings didn\u2019t show significant overall 943 translation, we performed additional clustering of ring centers in time with distance 944 cutoff 3d to track rings in time and get a lifetime of the rings (estimated by subtraction of 945 last and first snapshots of each observed ring, Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). This 946 clustering was also used to remove falsely detected \u201crings\u201d by removing all clusters of 947 size lower than 3 members (Supplementary Fig. 3i). All the cutoffs of this analysis were 948 chosen and validated by visual comparison to simulation movies in all studied densities. 949 To calculate the average density of rings in simulations the number of rings in a 950 snapshot was divided by the total area (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig, 2c,d). The diameter 951 of rings was estimated by calculating the average distance of filaments from the center of 952 the ring (Fig, 2i, Supplementary Fig, 3e,f). 953 The polarity alignment (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 4d-h) was analyzed by 954 computing all the neighboring beads (not belonging to the same filament, with the same 955 distance threshold rcut used in the pair potential) in the system using Freud library and 956\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.
