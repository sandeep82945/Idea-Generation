 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore new protecting group strategies for PNA synthesis to improve coupling efficiency, prevent aggregation, and enable synthesis of longer sequences. For example, test orthogonality of new protecting groups with milder cleavage conditions.

2. Develop new PNA monomers with modified backbones or nucleobases to improve properties like solubility, cell permeability, and binding affinity. Test how these modifications affect hybridization and performance in gene editing or antisense applications.

3. Optimize solution-phase PNA synthesis methods as an alternative to solid-phase, especially for producing PNA-peptide conjugates or modified PNAs. Explore using new coupling reagents or reactions like multi-component reactions.

4. Design and synthesize cyclic PNAs to study how conformational constraints affect binding affinity, cell uptake, and biological activity compared to linear PNAs.

5. Develop methods to synthesize PNAs on surfaces or particles for applications like microarrays, biosensors, and targeted drug delivery. Explore new linker chemistries and reactions compatible with solid supports.
