    "abstractText": "Drug overdoses from opioids and stimulants are a major cause of mortality in the United States. It is unclear if there are stable sex differences in overdose mortality for these drugs across states, whether these differ across the lifespan, and if so, whether they can be accounted for by different levels of drug misuse. This was a state-level analysis of epidemiological data on overdose mortality, across 10-year age bins (age range: 15\u201374), using the CDC WONDER platform for decedents in the United States in 2020\u20131. The outcome measure was rate of overdose death (per 100,000) for: synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl), heroin, psychostimulants with potential for misuse (e.g., methamphetamine), and cocaine. Multiple linear regressions controlled for ethnic-cultural background, household net worth, and sex-specific rate of misuse (from NSDUH, 2018-9). For all these drug categories, males had greater overall overdose mortality than females, after controlling for rates of drug misuse. The mean male/female sex ratio of mortality rate was relatively stable across jurisdictions: synthetic opioids (2.5 [95% CI, 2.4\u20137]), heroin, (2.9 [95% CI, 2.7\u20133.1], psychostimulants (2.4 [95% CI, 2.3\u20135]), and cocaine (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6\u20139]). With data stratified in 10-year age bins, the sex difference generally survived adjustment (especially in the 25\u201364 age range). Results indicate that males are significantly more vulnerable than females to overdose deaths caused by opioid and stimulant drugs, taking into account differing state-level environmental conditions and drug misuse levels. These results call for research into diverse biological, behavioral, and social factors that underlie sex differences in human vulnerability to drug overdose.",

It is unclear if there are stable sex differences in overdose mortality for these drugs across states, whether these differ across the lifespan, and if so, whether they can be accounted for by different levels of drug misuse. This was a state-level analysis of epidemiological data on overdose mortality, across 10-year age bins (age range: 15\u201374), using the CDC WONDER platform for decedents in the United States in 2020\u20131. The outcome measure was rate of overdose death (per 100,000) for: synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl), heroin, psychostimulants with potential for misuse (e.g., methamphetamine), and cocaine. Multiple linear regressions controlled for ethnic-cultural background, household net worth, and sex-specific rate of misuse (from NSDUH, 2018-9). For all these drug categories, males had greater overall overdose mortality than females, after controlling for rates of drug misuse. The mean male/female sex ratio of mortality rate was relatively stable across jurisdictions: synthetic opioids (2.5 [95% CI, 2.4\u20137]), heroin, (2.9 [95% CI, 2.7\u20133.1], psychostimulants (2.4 [95% CI, 2.3\u20135]), and cocaine (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6\u20139]). With data stratified in 10-year age bins, the sex difference generally survived adjustment (especially in the 25\u201364 age range). Results indicate that males are significantly more vulnerable than females to overdose deaths caused by opioid and stimulant drugs, taking into account differing state-level environmental conditions and drug misuse levels. These results call for research into diverse biological, behavioral, and social factors that underlie sex differences in human vulnerability to drug overdose.\nNeuropsychopharmacology (2023) 48:1639\u20131647; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-023-01601-8"

            "text": "Overdose deaths due to opioids (such as fentanyl and heroin), or stimulant drugs (such as methamphetamine and cocaine) have increased in recent years in the United States [1\u20133]. This increase has accelerated since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 and thereafter) for fentanyl and its analogs and stimulants such as methamphetamine, but not heroin, prescription opioids, or methadone [4\u20137]. This was due in part to increases in the distribution of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and their use to lace other drugs, including illicit preparations disguised as prescription opioid analgesics, stimulant medications, or benzodiazepines [6, 8, 9]. Prevention of overdose death requires the identification of vulnerability factors, which are thought to include sex and age [6]. Regarding sex as a biological variable, data from rodent models are inconclusive due to conflicting results: some such studies have shown that female rats escalate their intake of opioids or stimulant drugs more than male rats [10], but a large number of other studies have not [11]. Similarly, some studies in human cohorts have shown that females escalated their intake of opioids or stimulant drugs more rapidly than males [12\u201315], but several other studies have not [16\u201318]. A recent comprehensive review did not find robust sex differences in vulnerability to craving and relapse [11]. Nonetheless, as reviewed below, epidemiological data have\nsuggested a sex difference in risk of overdose death, and those findings need to be followed up on. Regarding age, studies have suggested typical trajectories in which misuse of opioids or stimulant drugs begins in late adolescence or young adulthood and escalates thereafter [18, 19]. However, the onset of misuse may also occur later in the lifespan, and can be triggered iatrogenically [20, 21]. Recent data also point to an increase in older adults (aged 55 and older) seeking first-time treatment for OUD [22]. Epidemiological studies show that males tend to have greater overdose mortality compared to females [23]. Thus, a recent report for 2019\u201320, for 25 states and the District of Columbia, showed an increase in overdose mortality for all drugs combined, with a greater rate in males versus females [24]. Similarly, a US nation-level analysis showed an increase in overdose mortality from synthetic opioids (thus including fentanyl but not heroin) and psychostimulants (including methamphetamine but not cocaine) from March 2018 to March 2021, with highest mortality rates in males (especially from minoritized groups, e.g., African-American) [4]. A nation-level report on CDC data from 2017 to 2018 showed that males compared to females had greater overdose mortality for prescription opioids specifically, and for all opioids combined [6]. Here we examined sex differences in greater depth across the lifespan and determined whether their magnitude is consistent\nReceived: 10 March 2023 Revised: 25 April 2023 Accepted: 1 May 2023 Published online: 15 June 2023\n1Neuropsychoimaging of Addiction and Related Conditions Research Program, Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 2National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Baltimore, MD, USA. \u2709email: eduardo.butelman@mssm.edu\nwww.nature.com/npp\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nacross state-level US jurisdictions, which exhibit a broad range of major demographic and socioeconomic variables, levels of misuse, and illicit drug market factors [25]. We examined overdose mortality separately for specific categories of opioid and stimulant drugs, due to their differing mechanisms of toxicity [26]. Acute overdose mortality from opioids (mu-opioid receptor agonists) is primarily attributed to respiratory depression mediated by brainstem nuclei [27, 28]. Overdose mortality from fentanyl may be greater than that for heroin, due to greater potency, faster onset of action driven by high lipophilicity, and higher likelihood to trigger chest rigidity [29\u201331]. It is not clear whether there are generalizable sex differences in sensitivity to respiratory depressant effects of mu-opioid agonists in humans [32\u201335]. Epidemiological data do not directly address this question, but could provide evidence against it (or in favor of additional explanations) if the sex difference in overdose mortality is not consistent across state-level jurisdictions. Acute overdose mortality by methamphetamine and cocaine in humans is primarily attributed to cardiovascular and neurological events such as malignant arrhythmias, strokes, or seizures [36, 37]. Some, but not all, human studies reported that females had either more prolonged or more pronounced cardiovascular effects than males after administration of stimulant drugs [38\u201341]. Again, epidemiological data cannot directly address questions of biological vulnerability, but could constrain hypotheses, depending on whether the sex difference in overdose mortality is consistent across states that differ in major demographic, socioeconomic and drug use factors. In addition to sex differences in direct pathophysiological effects of the drug, factors that could account for stable variations in rates of overdose include family and social interactions and related trauma [42, 43], propensity toward risky behaviors (e.g., injecting alone, taking large doses, or using untrusted suppliers) [44, 45], and propensity to seek treatment [46\u201350]. We expect that differences in these gendered behavioral factors would be largely consistent across drug categories and states in the US. Other contributing factors which could differ by state within the US include ethnic-cultural background, socioeconomic variables, illicit drug supply, and availability of evidencebased care [8, 51\u201354]. Using state-level nationally representative CDC data for 2020\u20131, the goal of this study was therefore to determine the extent to which sex differences in overdose mortality vary in four mutually exclusive drug categories (synthetic opioids, heroin, psychostimulants such as methamphetamine, and cocaine) and state, accounting for age. Different patterns of sex variability in overdose mortality would suggest (without proving or ruling out) different emphases on possible levels of causation."

Univariate analyses included Spearman correlations on overdose mortality data (crude death rate per 100,000 population) for males and females, per jurisdiction. Mortality and misuse ratios in males/females were compared with Wilcoxon tests. Univariate mixed-effects ANOVAs (sex x age bin) then analyzed log-transformed overdose mortality rate across the lifespan, stratified in six consecutive 10-year age bins; significant effects were followed with post-hoc Bonferroni tests. Normality of the outcome variable was examined with the D\u2019Agostino-Pearson test (p= 0.05 level), followed by visual examination of quantile-quantile plots, when necessary. Separately for each drug category (all ages combined in the range 15\u201374 years), multivariable analyses were carried out with multiple linear (least squares) regressions, to assess the effect of sex and selected potential covariates on the outcome, log-transformed death rates. Thus, the independent variables included: sex (M/F), percent of the population who is white, percent of the population who is black (from the 5-year American Community Survey for 2020; https:// worldpopulationreview.com/states/states-by-race; eTable 3), and median household net worth in 2020 (www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/ demo/wealth/state-wealth-asset-ownership.html; eTable 4). Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for 2018\u20139 were used as an estimate of misuse of relevant drugs (https:// rdas.samhsa.gov/#/survey/NSDUH-2018-2019-RD02YR). NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized persons 12 years and older, using stratified probability sampling (based on n= 67,791 and n= 67,625 completed interviews in 2018 and 2019, respectively). Full methodology for NSDUH can be found at: www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt34659/NSDUHmrb DCFR2019.pdf. Thus, the multiple linear regressions for overdose mortality by synthetic opioids and heroin controlled for the rate of past-year misuse of opioids, by state and sex (item \u201cOPINMYR\u201d in NSDUH). Likewise, the regressions for overdose mortality for psychostimulants or cocaine controlled for the rate of past-year misuse of these drugs, by sex (items \u201cAMMEPDPYMU\u201d and \u201cCOCMYR\u201d in NSDUH, respectively). Using NSDUH data, we were not able to perform stateand sex-specific analyses of relevant substance use disorders (as opposed to misuse), because of frequent data suppression after stratification. The overdose mortality data were also stratified by 10- year age bins (overall range: 15\u201374 years), and multiple regressions were run separately for each age bin. In the ANOVAs and multiple regressions, outliers for the outcome variable (log overdose rates) were removed, using Grubbs test at the p= 0.05 alpha level of significance (i.e., greater than \u00b11.96 standard deviations from the mean as the standard). Also, if there were <10 jurisdictions without overdose mortality data available for both males and females for an age bin and drug category, the data set was excluded from analysis, to maintain representativeness. The overall alpha level of significance was set at the p= 0.05 level, two-tailed. In a sub-group analysis, we examined analogously overdoses that involved both synthetic opioids and psychostimulants (a common polydrug pattern of overdose) (Supplement). [3, 59]. In a sensitivity analysis, we determined whether findings were affected by the use of crude versus age-adjusted rates of mortality, focusing on the synthetic opioid category."

            "text": "This was a nationally representative state- and age-specific examination of differences between males and females in overdose mortality due to opioid and stimulant drugs, for 2020\u20131. The study showed that for these drug categories, across the lifespan, after controlling for sex-specific levels of past-year drug misuse and for major demographic factors, males died from overdoses at an ~2\u20133 greater rate than females. Studies from\nB. Heroin\nA. Synthetic opioids\nNeuropsychopharmacology (2023) 48:1639 \u2013 1647\nseveral other industrialized countries do show greater druginduced mortality for males versus females [61, 62]. However, to our knowledge, current comparative data for these drugs, stratified by age, are not published for a broad set of countries. For synthetic opioids, the effect of sex on overdose mortality survived adjustment in all the 10-year age bins studied (overall range 15\u201374 years). For the other drug categories under study (heroin, psychostimulants, and cocaine), this effect of sex survived adjustment in age bins in the 25\u201364 age range. Therefore, for all the drugs studied here, greater overdose mortality rates were observed in males versus females in the 55\u201364 age bin, considered to be in the post-menopausal range for the population [63]. The robustness of the overall sex difference in overdose mortality, even after controlling for different propensity to misuse, and across state-level jurisdictions, shows that males in the US are reliably at greater risk of fatal overdose than females. Mechanistic explanations cannot be directly derived from these epidemiological data, but some processes can be accorded greater likelihood of accounting for most of the sex difference. Sex-specific biological vulnerability to the direct toxic effects of the drugs, for example, cannot be ruled out. However, this sex-specific vulnerability would have to be shared across mu-opioid agonists and stimulant drugs, whose toxic effects are highly distinct from each other, in terms of pharmacodynamic targets and\npathophysiological mechanisms. Even within these major drug categories, the pharmacodynamics and pathophysiological effects of specific mu-opioid agonists such as fentanyl versus morphine derivatives such as heroin [30, 31], and methamphetamine versus cocaine [64, 65], are not identical. There are sex differences in the propensity to development of substance-use disorders (SUDs), but they appear unlikely to account for the observed difference in mortality rates. Nationlevel data from the 2021 NSDUH [66] show that the overall male/ female ratio in the prevalence of any past-year SUD (all drugs combined) was 1.3 (9.8% of males versus 7.4% of females)\u2014a considerably smaller sex difference than the one we observed in mortality rates. We noted earlier that other, more culture-bound differences between men and women could include differential propensity toward risky behaviors, above and beyond any risk inherent in misusing an opioid or stimulant\u2014e.g., injecting alone [44, 45], taking large doses, or using untrusted suppliers. Males, compared to females, have been shown to have a greater propensity for other risky behaviors, with associated morbidity and mortality. For example, one study found that males were 2-3 fold more likely than females to be responsible for motor collisions, but were not more likely to be passive victims of motor collisions [67]. This is consistent with recent nationally representative US data sets (from 2020) showing that male drivers who\nSynthetic opioid overdose mortality\nHeroin Overdose Mortality\nNeuropsychopharmacology (2023) 48:1639 \u2013 1647\ndied as a result of traffic accidents had a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as speeding, compared to female drivers [68]. We suspect that this type of sex difference is a valuable starting point for the exploration of both a major mechanism and a modifiable risk factor in overdose deaths, but this explanation does not exclude important roles for other biological, behavioral, or social factors. For example, at the biological level, the X-chromosome contains a large number of genes and micro-RNA that are involved in neuronal and glial functions, the regulation of which could differ in males and females [69\u201371]. At the behavioral and social levels, patterns of initial opioid exposure could differ in men and women (for example due to medical factors, including pain), and could affect the trajectory of opioid use and overdose risk [72]."

            "text": "We focused on drug categories that greatly contribute to overdose deaths in the US at this time [3, 4, 73], but there is a need for similar age-related examination of sex differences in overdose death from prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol [6, 74]. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that some of the sex differences in overdose mortality or misuse are due to reporting biases [75, 76]. In addition, state- and sex-level data on drug misuse from NSDUH for years after 2019 are not currently publicly available. It should also be noted that the opioid misuse data in NSDUH (item OPINMYR) can encompass other compounds, in addition to synthetic opioids and heroin. Another limitation is due to prior reports that use of illicit drugs overall can be underestimated in population-based surveys [77]. Finally, the coding of gender identity in national mortality data is not currently routine [58], and these data sets do not provide information specifically for transgender or non-binary persons. This is an important issue, because of the risks of SUD and overdose in transgender, nonbinary, and/or gender-expansive communities [78, 79]."

            "heading": "Conclusions",
            "text": "We performed a state-level analysis of recent nationally representative data and found that males, compared to females, have a significantly greater rate of overdose mortality from synthetic opioids, heroin, and stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine. An important finding in our study is that greater mortality in males was evident even after controlling for levels of misuse, at the state level. These sex differences were observed across the lifespan (e.g., in the range of 25\u201364 years of age), and were stable across states that have broad range of environmental variables. These findings call for mechanistically-based research on risk and interventions for severe OUD outcomes in both males and females. Furthermore, these findings underscore that sex differences are important targets for investigation at multiple biological and behavioral levels, potentially leading to optimized prevention and intervention approaches to mitigate risk of overdose mortality, at different stages across the lifespan."
