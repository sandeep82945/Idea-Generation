    "abstractText": "In this study, we propose an explicit adaptive finite difference method (FDM) for the Cahn\u2013Hilliard (CH) equation which describes the process of phase separation. The CH equation has been successfully utilized to model and simulate diverse field applications such as complex interfacial fluid flows and materials science. To numerically solve the CH equation fast and efficiently, we use the FDM and time-adaptive narrowband domain. For the adaptive grid, we define a narrow-band domain including the interfacial transition layer of the phase field based on an undivided finite difference and solve the numerical scheme on the narrow-band domain. The proposed numerical scheme is based on an alternating direction explicit (ADE) method. To make the scheme conservative, we apply a mass correction algorithm after each temporal iteration step. To demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adaptive FDM for the CH equation, we present twoand three-dimensional numerical experiments and compare them with those of other previous methods.",

            "text": "The Cahn\u2013Hilliard (CH) equation represents the dynamics of spinodal decomposition that occurs when a single thermodynamic phase spontaneously separates into two phases (Cahn and Hilliard 1958; Grant 1993):\n\u2202\u03c6(x, t) \u2202t\n= [ F \u2032(\u03c6(x, t)) \u2212 2 \u03c6(x, t) ] , (1)\nwhere \u03c6(x, t) is a phase field at space x \u2208 and time t , is a positive constant, and F(\u03c6) = (\u03c62 \u2212 1)2/4. The boundary condition is the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition: n \u00b7 \u2207\u03c6(x, t) = 0 and n \u00b7 \u2207 \u03c6(x, t) = 0 for x \u2208 \u2202 , where n is the outer unit normal vector. Because the CH equation can efficiently handle topological changes, it has been widely studied and applied in various applications. However, because the CH equation is a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), the explicit time discretization requires a very small time step for stability. In order to overcome the strict time step constraints, various semi-implicit (Zhu et al. 1999; Li and Qiao 2017; Li et al. 2016, 2021) and implicit (Benes\u0302ov\u00e1 et al. 2014; Bosch et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2019) schemes have been proposed to solve the CH equation with good numerical stability. Splitting-type numerical schemes have been used for variable studies (Chen et al. 2012; Li et al. 2018; Cheng et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Meng et al. 2020; Hao 2021) with energy stability. Several different methods have been utilized to numerically solve the CH equation. Zhai et al. (2021) proposed a novel high-order linearly operator splittingmethod for the nonlocal viscous CH equation with the spectral deferred correction method. Their method can avoid the nonlinear iteration and obtain high temporal accuracy. Feng et al. (2020) considered the CH equation with an imposed advection term. They studied the effects of the imposed advection on phase separation of theCHequation.Ainsworth andMao (2017) investigated the fractional CH equation with fractional free energy. They presented well-posedness and several numerical examples of the fractional CH equation. Li et al. (2016a) used the phase-field model to the minimized CH dynamics. Mohammadi and Dehghan (2019) presented an adaptive time algorithm for the CH equation. Fu and Han (2021) used a finite element method (FEM) to overcome the challenges of solving the CH equation with a degenerate mobility function. Theljani et al. (2020) proposed the image inpainting method which solves the CH equation on an adaptive mesh. Figure 1 shows an adaptive mesh (Theljani et al. 2020).\nChen et al. (2016) solved the CH-type diffusion equation and the Navier\u2013Stokes equation using a space-time adaptive finite difference method. Isotopic and strongly anisotropic CH systems were solved using the multigrid method on an adaptive grid (Chen et al. 2018). Figure 2a and b shows the adaptive meshes (Chen et al. 2016, 2018) for two- and three-dimensional spaces, respectively.\nCompared to the unstructured methods, the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework can provide spatial multi-resolution (Berger and Oliger 1984), which imposes a good choice for the large-scale simulation with challenging physical issues (Li et al. 2016b; Zhou and Xie 2021). There are many applications for the AMR algorithm, i.e., crystal growth (Li and Kim 2012, 2017), thin film (Li et al. 2014; Sun et al.\n2007), nonlinear wave (Dohnal and Uecker 2016), and computational fluid dynamics (Berger and Colella 1989). Koliesnikova et al. (2021) proposed a hierarchical mesh refinement scheme driven by a posteriori error estimator. Li et al. (2021) proposed an implicitly discretized surface method with an AMR method. To overcome the difficulties of imposing the boundary conditions by considering the skin depth, Jung and Yoo (2021) used an AMR framework for microwave applications of metallic structures. Grave and Coutinho (2021) used a PDE model to investigate the dynamics of COVID-19 using an AMR method. Their model can represent various spatial scales.\nKay and Welford (2006) presented a multigrid FEM for the CH equation. Banas and N\u00fcrnberg (2008) presented an AMR method for the CH equation. Ceniceros and Rom (2007) presented a nonstiff, fully AMR method for the CH equation. Wise et al.\n(2007) presented a second-order accurate and adaptive FDM to solve the CH equation in 2D and 3D spaces. Stogner et al. (2008) proposed a variational formulation and C1 FEM with an AMR method. The fourth-order spatial accurate compact schemes were developed for the CH equation in 2D (Lee et al. 2014) and 3D (Li et al. 2016c) spaces. The above-mentionedmethods are based on a semi-implicit splitting or implicit scheme, in which a multigrid method or other numerical solvers should be performed on coarse and fine grid levels. Therefore, the explicit AMR-based method is much simpler to implement.\nThe main purpose of this study is to present an explicit adaptive FDM for the CH equation. The primary advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity compared to existing adaptive numerical schemes for the CH equation which use complex data structure and implicit solvers.\nThe outline of this article is as follows. In Sect. 2, the proposed numerical method is described. In Sect. 3, we present several computational experiments to confirm the superior performance of the proposed explicit AMR method. We conclude this paper in Sect. 4."

For more details, see (Yang et al. 2022).

Here, Nx and Ny are the numbers of the grid points. Let \u03c6ni j = \u03c6(xi , y j , n t), where t is the time step for a nonnegative integer n. First, we discretize Eq. (1) using the linear convex splitting scheme (Li et al. 2017):\n\u03c6n+1i j \u2212 \u03c6ni j t = d((\u03c6ni j )3 \u2212 3\u03c6ni j ) + 2 d\u03c6n+1i j \u2212 2 2d\u03c6n+1i j , (2)\nwhere d\u03c6i j = (\u03c6i+1, j + \u03c6i\u22121, j \u2212 4\u03c6i j + \u03c6i, j+1 + \u03c6i, j\u22121)/h2 and 2d\u03c6i j = d( d\u03c6i j ). We define a temporary narrow domain as\nntmp = {(xi , y j )| |\u2207\u03c6ni j | > \u03be, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 Nx , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ny}, (3)\nwhere \u03be is a parameter and\n\u2207\u03c6ni j = ( \u03c6ni+1, j \u2212 \u03c6ni\u22121, j 2h , \u03c6ni, j+1 \u2212 \u03c6ni, j\u22121 2h ) .\nA space-time adaptive narrow-band domain nnb is defined using n tmp:\nnnb = p=m\u22c3 p=\u2212m q=m\u22c3 q=\u2212m {(xi+p, y j+q)|(xi , y j ) \u2208 ntmp} (4)\nfor some positive integer m, which makes buffer points. We can control the narrowband domain by adjusting \u03be and m values appropriately. We define doubly layered exterior boundary points of nnb as\nnbd = p=2\u22c3 p=\u22122 q=2\u22c3 q=\u22122 {(xi+p, y j+q)|(xi , y j ) \u2208 nnb} \\ nnb.\nFor better understanding of the narrow-band domain construction, let us consider the following circular shape at time t = n t :\n\u03c6(x, y, t) = tanh ( 30 \u2212 \u221ax2 + y2\u221a\n2\n) , (5)\nwhich is shown in Fig. 3a and the red line is the contour of \u03c6 at zero level.

Next, we adopt the adaptive methodology, which was developed for the Allen\u2013Cahn equation, see (Jeong et al. 2021).\nBecause the Saul\u2019yev-type scheme is generally not conservative, we adopt a mass correction step (Jeong et al. 2020):\n\u03c6n+1i j = \u03c6n+1i j + \u2211 (xp,yq )\u2208 nnb(\u03c6 n pq \u2212 \u03c6n+1pq )\n\u2211 (xp,yq )\u2208 nnb \u221a F(\u03c6n+1pq )\n\u221a F(\u03c6n+1i j ) for (xi , y j ) \u2208 nnb. (7)\nWe should note that the mass correction is only done on the narrow-band domain because the values of \u03c6 outside the narrow-band domain are unchanged.\nRemark 1 Solving problems using the FDM in adaptive meshes is very complex and difficult; nevertheless, there are studies that have presented new numerical ideas and convincing numerical results on this interesting scientific problem (Feng et al. 2018; Wise et al. 2011). However, because most adaptive methods have very com-\nplex relational expressions, numerical methods have been verified through numerical experiments rather than analytically verified."

Let us define the 3D discrete energy functional in the discretized space domain h as\nEh(\u03c6n) := Nx\u2211 i=1 Ny\u2211 j=1 Nz\u2211 k=1 ( F(\u03c6ni jk) + 2 2 |\u2207h\u03c6ni jk |2 ) h3, (21)\nwhere\n\u2207h\u03c6ni jk = (\u03c6ni+1, jk \u2212 \u03c6ni jk h , \u03c6ni, j+1,k \u2212 \u03c6ni jk h , \u03c6ni j,k+1 \u2212 \u03c6ni jk h ) .

To numerically solve the CH equation fast and efficiently, we used the FDM and time-adaptive narrow-band domain. For the adaptive grid,we define a narrow-band domain including the interfacial transition layer of the phase field and solve the numerical scheme on the narrow-band domain which is computed using undivided finite difference. We used the alternating direction explicit method. To make the scheme conservative, we apply a mass correction algorithm after each temporal iteration step. To demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, we presented 2D and 3D numerical experiments and compared them with those of the other previous methods.
