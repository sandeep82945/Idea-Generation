Specically, this has been studied in depth for dopamine (DA), where aberrant protein modication has been implicated as a potential driver of neuron loss in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).19,20 However, much remains unknown about the identity of the specic protein targets, the binding sites, and the reactive molecular species.17 Chemical activity-based probes23,24 have recently been published of dopamine (DA),25 capsaicin (CP),11 n-octyl caffeate,14 3,4- dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DPA),26 and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA),27 the latter being a neurotoxic oxidation product of DA. In general, the analysis of protein modication by DAbased catechols using mass spectrometry (MS) methods is challenged by the precipitation of DA-protein adducts,20 which interferes with their detection.17 DA quinone (DAQ) is a reactive molecule that can undergo further chemical reactions or covalently modify cellular structures. For instance, it can cyclise via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the amine side chain to form leukodopaminochrome, which may further polymerise to form the insoluble natural pigment eumelanin. DAQ is also subjected to nucleophilic attack by protein side chains such as cysteine in a Michael-type addition and results in protein post-translational modication\nChem.

Since these probes lack a nucleophilic residue, they are readily oxidised to an ortho-quinone but, unlike DA, cannot undergo side-reactions such as cyclisation or polymerisation\nFig. 1 Probe design and workflow for the identification of catechol prote intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the amine.

For this, DJ-1 (1 mM) was treated with different concentrations of DA (12.5\u2013200 mM) followed by incubation with DA-P3 (25 mM). Aer copper-catalysed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)30,31 to rhodamine azide, labelled DJ-1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and uorescence intensity of the corresponding protein band indeed decreased with increasing DA concentration. No protein precipitation was observed aer probe treatment and competition with up to 50 mM DA (Fig. S1c\u2020). However, lower Coomassie band intensities were visible at 100\u2013200 mM DA, indicating the formation of insoluble DA-protein aggregates25 at high concentrations.\nTo analyse overall protein binding in live cells, HEK293 cells were treated in situ with all three catechol probes (Fig. 2a). A uorescence reporter was appended to the labelled proteins by CuAAC aer lysis, and labelled proteins were visualised by uorescent SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). With 1 h treatment, concentration-dependent labelling was visible for all probes starting from 15 mM. Overall, DA-P3 showed the strongest labelling and DA-P1 the weakest with a comparable labelling pattern across the probes. Importantly, no signicant protein precipitation was observed in the coomassie staining even at 100 mM concentration. Next, to facilitate a MS-based comparison of probes DA-P1\u20133, the proteome was treated with 15 mM compound for 1 h and labelled proteins were subsequently ligated to a biotin handle aer cell lysis. Following enrichment of the labelled proteome on avidin beads and tryptic digest, the resulting peptides were analysed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantication (Fig. 1b).34 As already observed via gel-based analysis, the MS data revealed a large overlap of identied hits across all probes and the length of the alkyl chain correlated with the number of signicant hits whereas it largely did not inuence the identity of enriched proteins (Fig. S2a\u2013c, Table S1\u2020). We next extended treatment to 3 h to account for potential differences in uptake or labelling kinetics (Fig. S3a\u2013c, Table S2\u2020). While the correlation between chain length and the number of identied hits remained, the overall number of labelled proteins diminished from 1 h to 3 h, indicating that the modications introduced on the proteins are relatively short-lived. We chose treatment with DA-P3 for 1 h for all following experiments as these conditions resulted in the strongest labelling.\nCompetitive labelling experiments reveal DA binding proteins\nHEK293 cells produce no endogenousDA (ref. 20 and 32) but have been reported to take up DA and other monoamine neurotransmitters.33 We therefore labelled intact HEK293 cells with DA-P3 in competition with DA. Treatment of HEK293 cells with 15 mM DAP3 for 1 h resulted in an at least fourfold enrichment of 236 proteins (\u2212log10(p-value) $ 2) compared to a DMSO-treated control (Fig. 2c, Table S3\u2020). Moreover, a 30-fold excess of DA added to the cells 1 h prior to probe addition displaced the binding of 205 proteins (Fig. 2d, Table S3\u2020). Of all proteins\n8638 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8635\u20138643\nenriched by DA-P3 compared to the DMSO control, 63% were signicantly outcompeted byDA (Fig. 2e). These data support that DA-P3 does indeed mimic the reactivity of DA/DAQ well.\nTo link the identied targets of DA to cellular functions, we performed a gene ontology (GO) term analysis of signicantly enriched proteins using the GOrilla tool.35,36 Among the proteins identied solely by DA-P3, proteins involved in ER stress and UPR (\u201cresponse to ER stress\u201d, \u201cER unfolded protein response\u201d) as well as PDIs (\u201cpeptide disulphide oxidoreductase activity\u201d) were enriched at least 3-fold (Fig. 2f). Similarly, GO terms related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also stood out in the competition experiment with DA (Fig. 2g).\nSH-SY5Y is a catecholaminergic neuroblastoma cell line frequently used in DA-associated neurodegeneration research.37\u201339 Surprisingly, whilstDA-P3 showed strong labelling in SH-SY5Y where it labelled 205 proteins compared to a DMSO control at 4 mM (Fig. S4a, Table S4\u2020), we observed no competition by a ten-fold excess of DA (Fig. S4b, Table S4\u2020). It is very plausible that the presence of endogenous catechols or corresponding metabolites40 may interfere with competitive experiments. Noteworthy, Hurben et al. have reported a similar experimental set up using an alkylated DA-probe (DAyne) where no competition by the parent compound DA could be observed.25 We therefore chose HEK293 for all following experiments."

In human cells, catechol compounds such as catecholamine neurotransmitters, catechol oestrogens, or xenobiotics are methylated by the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) as part of a degradation pathway explaining the mass adduct.46 The modication was highly selective for cysteines which constituted 98% of all detected modied residues (116 total, Fig. 3c, Table S5\u2020). Recently, covalent binding of CP to certain proteins has been reported.11 So far, it remains unknown if CP protein reactivity requires demethylation and ortho-quinone formation or if a direct nucleophilic attack is also possible. In fact, our data revealed that 3-O-methylated catechols directly bind to cysteine residues. This observation is in line with an oxidation to the quinone methide, followed by a nucleophilic cysteine attack (Fig. 3d). An analogous addition of glutathione to enzymatically oxidised CP has been reported supporting this notion.47\u201349\nAlthough it is possible that unmethylated catechol modications may have escaped our MS detection (despite their identication on DJ-1 with our method), the observation of 3-O-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Previous ndings have indicated that different catechols may share a common protein target space as labelling of b-actin with a DPA-probe could be outcompeted by certain avonoids.26 Nevertheless, insights into the molecular targets are sparse. We thus took advantage of the broad DA-P3 reactivity and utilised it as a minimalist catechol probe in competition with a selection of health-associated catechol compounds that are oen found in plant-derived foods/beverages (quercetin, QC; taxifolin, TF; epicatechin, EC; luteolin, LU; epigallocatechin gallate, EG; caffeic acid, KS) or drugs (dobutamine, DB; carbidopa, CD). CP with a methylated catechol group was included for comparison (Fig. 4a). Labelling was performed with DA-P3 (15 mM) and a 10-fold excess of the respective catechol in live HEK293 cells followed by enrichment and quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis with label-free quantication.34 Of the ten compounds tested, LU, CP, OL, QC, DB, and EG outcompeted probe binding at 180\u2013286 proteins whereas CD, TF, EC, and KS showed no competition at all (Fig. 4b\u2013e and S5, Table S6\u2020). Interestingly, CP, carrying a 3-O-methylcatechol group, was among the reactive compounds, corroborating our results with methylated catechols (Fig. 4d\u2013e, Table S6\u2020).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nMetabolic activity assays following treatment with competitive catechols only revealed a moderate decrease in cell viability in the presence of EG and CP, substantiating that the observed protein enrichment is not the result of toxicity (Fig. S6\u2020).\nWe next tested competition by two exemplary unreactive catechols at higher concentrations. Indeed, we observed competition of DA-P3 labelling by a 100-fold excess of CD and KS with 113 and 259 proteins, respectively (Fig. S7a\u2013b, Table S7 and S8\u2020). This indicates that these compounds are less reactive or cell permeable and facilitate competition solely at high concentrations. Given that these higher concentrations could lead to unspecic effects, we decided to focus on competition in a 10-fold excess in the following experiments.\nAcross all reactive compounds, 17 proteins were consistently signicantly targeted by DB, OL, QC, CP, LU, and EG, revealing an unanticipated broad overlap of target proteins susceptible to catechol modication despite the diversity of the chemical structures (Fig. 4f). Interestingly, four proteins were associated with the ER, namely ESYT1 (tethers the ER to the plasma membrane),50,51 SPCS2 (contributes to cotranslational translocation of nascent proteins into the ER),52 WFS1 (ER membrane glycoprotein involved in the regulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis),53 and HMGCR. HMGCR is localised in the ER membrane, where it catalyses the rate-determining step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids.54\nA comparison of the frequency of GO terms35,36 associated with signicantly enriched proteins revealed 57 biological process, 21 molecular function, and 27 cellular component\nChem.

Across all categories, terms related to structural proteins (e.g., microtubule, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion) were consistently represented. Furthermore, as already observed in the previous analyses for DA-P3 and DA, ERassociated terms were enriched for selected catechols.\nAs the catechols appeared to target ER proteins, we exemplarily chose this crucial organelle for validation and\n8640 | Chem.

The analysis was performed in three biological replicates which were in qualitative agreement (Fig. 5 and S9a\u2013b\u2020). ER stress is characterised by\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

We next investigated the phosphorylation of eIF2a by immunoblotting which monitors the activation of the PERK sensor. Treatment with the positive control tunicamycin, DA-P3, TF, QC, and OL visibly increased eIF2a phosphorylation. Moreover, the expression of BiP was upregulated in the presence of TF, OL, QC, DA, and DA-P3. Finally, we tested for the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, a process triggered by the UPR sensor IRE1a. RT-PCR of the XBP1 mRNA revealed the formation of a spliced 416 bp fragment58 in the presence of tunicamycin, DA-P3, QC, OL, and, to a lesser extent, DB and TF. Overall, these data revealed a very strong activation of the UPR by DA-P3, and a weaker one by other compounds including QC, OL, DA, DB, and TF. No UPR activation was observed for CP and KS. The lack of UPR activation by CP despite its broad protein competition may be due to its structural differences, i.e. the 3-Omethylation, compared to the catechols. UPR activation by DAP3, DB, QC, OL, and DA and the inactivity of KS are well in line with the results of the MS experiments."

The direct comparison of structurally diverse catechols revealed large variations in their\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nprotein reactivities. The origin of these differences remains to be resolved. Among the catechols with high protein reactivity were compounds, for which, to our knowledge, broad protein reactivity has not been shown previously, for example the inotrope and clinically applied drug DB and the olive oil constituent OL. The tendency to covalently modify proteins is one of the reasons that catechols are known as \u201cPan Assay Interference Compounds\u201d (PAINS),60\u201362 a term describing compound classes that frequently recur as screening hits as a consequence of unspecic interference with biological assays.60,61 Catecholcontaining natural products have widely been reported as bioactive compounds in a variety of disease contexts63 but the reports oen fail to take into account the promiscuity in terms of protein binding.60 Our results illustrate the scope of proteins modied by catechols as well as the low degree of selectivity.\nA potential limitation of our and other reactivity-based labelling tools is that protein modications could be substoichiometric,25,59 therefore, certain proteins may have escaped our competitive labelling method. Moreover, certain proteins addressed by our panel of catechols and DA-P3 may differ and thus escape probe detection in the competition experiments. Yet, our data reveals that a signicant number of proteins is susceptible to catechol modication regardless of their structure and we have revealed an unexpectedly broad protein reactivity of certain catechols.\nAnother important nding was the direct modication of cysteines by methylated catechols. This protein modication has not been reported previously, but corroborates the recently reported cysteine-reactivity of the 3-O-methyl catechol CP.11\nTo date, only selected catechol targets have been reported whereas our work highlights the broad reactivity of catechols in live cells. Specically, we were able to show that certain catechol compounds target ER proteins, including PDIs critical for ER protein folding and UPR regulation,64\u201366 which results in increased ER stress. The UPR is a cellular response during ER stress caused by an accumulation of unfolded proteins. As a consequence, cells adjust protein synthesis, folding, and degradation to reduce the burden of unfolded proteins or else undergo apoptosis if unsuccessful. Due to increased protein turnover, many cancer cells experience constant ER stress and are more sensitive to UPR and PDI inhibition compared to healthy cells.67,68 Furthermore, recent studies report the inhibition of PDIs by DA, the avonoid isoquercetin, and n-octyl caffeate.10,14,25 Altogether, the modulation of ER-associated cellular processes highlights one intriguing facet on how catechols could promote health-benecial effects."
