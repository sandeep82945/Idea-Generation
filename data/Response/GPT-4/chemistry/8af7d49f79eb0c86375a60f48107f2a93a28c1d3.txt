Exploration of Alternative Amine Solvents: Investigate the use of alternative amine solvents, potentially with lower volatility or higher CO2 affinity, to enhance the CO2 adsorption efficiency and stability of the amine-infused hydrogels (AIHs). This could involve the study of novel amines or amine mixtures that could improve the overall performance of the AIHs in terms of CO2 capture capacity, resistance to degradation, and selectivity for CO2 over other gases.

Development of Hybrid Adsorbents: Develop and characterize hybrid adsorbents that combine amine-infused hydrogels with other CO2 capture technologies, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or zeolites, to create composite materials with enhanced adsorption properties. The aim would be to leverage the high surface area and tunable pore structure of these materials to increase the CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity further.

Optimization of Fly Ash Utilization: Further optimize the use of fly ash (FA) as a component in the AIHs by investigating different types of FA (e.g., Class C vs. Class F), varying the FA content, and modifying the FA surface properties. Studies could focus on maximizing the beneficial effects of FA on the adsorption performance, understanding the role of FA's chemical composition and physical structure in enhancing CO2 capture, and exploring the potential for utilizing FA from different sources.

Life Cycle and Sustainability Assessment: Conduct comprehensive life cycle and sustainability assessments of the CO2 capture process using amine-infused hydrogels. This research would aim to evaluate the environmental impact, economic feasibility, and overall sustainability of employing AIHs in large-scale CO2 capture applications, considering factors such as the longevity of the materials, the energy required for regeneration, and the potential for recycling or reusing the adsorbents.

Advanced Kinetic Modeling and Simulation: Develop advanced kinetic models and simulation studies to gain deeper insights into the CO2 adsorption mechanisms of AIHs, including the effects of operational parameters (temperature, pressure, gas flow rate) and material properties (FA content, amine concentration). The goal would be to optimize the design and operational conditions of AIH-based CO2 capture systems for improved efficiency and to facilitate the scale-up of this technology for industrial applications.
