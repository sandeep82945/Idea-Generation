    "abstractText": "Pichia pastoris is the widely used expression system for producing recombinant secretory proteins. It is known that Kex2 protease plays a vital role in the process of protein secretion, in which the P1\u2019 site affects its cleavage efficiency. To enhance the expression level of fungal defensin-derived peptide NZ2114, this work attempts to optimize the P1\u2019 site of Kex2 by replacing it with 20 amino acids in turn. The results showed that when the amino acid of the P1\u2019 site was changed to Phe (F), the yield of target peptide significantly increased from 2.39 g/L to 4.81 g/L. Additionally, the novel peptide F-NZ2114 (short for FNZ) showed strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (G+) bacteria, especially for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC: 4\u20138 \u03bcg/mL). The FNZ was very stable and retained high activity in various conditions; in addition, a low cytotoxicity and no hemolysis were observed even at a high concentration of 128 \u03bcg/mL, and a longer postantibiotic effect was reached. The above results indicate that this engineering strategy provided a feasible optimization scheme for enhancing the expression level and druggability of this antimicrobial peptide from fungal defensin and other similar targets by this updated recombinant yeast.",

            "text": "It is well known that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most common Gram-positive (G+) pathogens. It leads to various human and animal diseases, such as skin infections, pneumonia, pyemia, infective endocarditis, and other serious diseases [1]. For example, S. aureus can cause direct infection with mastitis in animals [2], when it co-infects with avian reovirus and then leads to severe avian arthritis [3]. What is worse is that S. aureus is very difficult to completely eliminate by traditional antibiotics due to its high resistance [4]. The antibiotic resistance is mainly from the overuse and leads to the perceived screening of bacteria. More antibiotics entering into animals induces formation of antibioticresistant bacteria, and their excretion through feces will result in an obvious increase in the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria also destroy the stability of intestinal flora and affect the body\u2019s digestive and immune system [5\u20137]. For decades, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has been one of the first-line treatments for MRSA infections [8]. However, with the increase of its clinical application, the first case of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus appeared in Japan in 1997, and then similar cases were reported in other countries [9\u201311]. In 2017, vancomycin-resistant MRSA was classified as a high-risk drug-resistant bacterium by WHO [12]. Hence, there is an urgent need to find new antibacterials with potent bactericidal activity and low drug resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a group of short peptides widely distributed in almost all forms of life [13]. Due to the high sensitivity and low resistance properties, AMPs\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 786. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12040786 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 786 2 of 17\nhave become one of the potential novel drug candidates during the 21st century; our team has recently proposed the iron triangle theory of health protection from AMPs, antibiotics, and vaccines and a frame of AMPs development for the post-antibiotic era [14,15]. In a special scope, AMPs show a potential to replace traditional antibiotics; but in a higher and broader scope, they actually belong to one of the new types of antimicrobials. Plectasin is derived from the saprophytic ascus fungus (Pseudoplectania nigrella) as the first AMP fungal defensin with a typical CS\u03b1\u03b2 structure [16] and with a good bactericidal effect against G+ bacteria by binding with cell wall component lipid II [17]. There is a good preliminary foundation in our team regarding the modification, expression, and efficacy studies of this class of antimicrobial peptides, which are expected to have good development prospects for antibiotic substitution and combination administration to hinder drug resistance [18\u201323]. We know that defensins take over half of AMPs in quantity from the AMP databases [24,25]. Looking back and thinking about the historic experience during the discovery of new antibiotics, we are impressed by the fact that, on one hand, the most defensin produced by fungi or other microorganisms has the better druggability and is more suitable being as new sources of candidate antimicrobials to dig and follow, which is superior to that of plants and animals with more difficulties to validate their druggability. On the other hand, the high cost and lower stability have always been the first key factors limiting the clinical application of AMPs [17,26], which is the basic premise and panorama that all AMP colleagues devoted to clinical application must face squarely or directly. Therefore, it is of great significance to modify the production process of microbial AMPs including the heterologous expression and biological preparation of defensin. Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) has been successfully used in industrial and medical fields due to its merits such as post-translative modification, easy genetic manipulation, no toxin, and stability of recombinants [27]. The NZ2114, a mutant of plectasin with the sequence of 40 amino acids as GFGCNGPWNEDDLRCHNHCKSIKGYKGGYCAKGGFVCKCY (measured average molecular mass 4410.6 Da), was successfully expressed via the P. pastoris system in our laboratory at a level of 2390 mg/L (ferment supernatant) [18]. The rNZ2114 maintained its original structure as a CS\u03b1\u03b2 with three disulfide bonds (PDB No. 6K50) and showed strong bactericidal activity against drug-resistant G+ bacteria, especially for S. aureus [28]. In fact, non\u2212specific cleavage of plectasin and its derivates always exists during our previous works [18,20,29], there is a larger room for improvement on higher specific cleavage efficiency. The cleavage efficiency of signal peptide is an important factor affecting protein expression in P. pastoris. Kex2 is a Ca2+-dependent serine protease derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [30]. It can specifically recognize and cut the carboxy\u2013terminal peptide bond of Arg\u2013Arg and Lys\u2013Arg amino acids. In yeast, Kex2 is mainly responsible for cutting the signal peptide in the precursor sequence, releasing the mature heterologous protein [31]. Previous studies have reported that the cleavage ability of Kex2 is positively correlated with the secretion of exogenous proteins from yeast. Optimization of the cleavage site by Kex2 effectively improved the secretion efficiency [32]. It was shown that Kex2 family enzymes can interact with the P1\u2019, P2\u2019, P3\u2019, and P4\u2019 side chains at substrates [33], in which the binding with P1\u2019 is more specific and stricter [34]. It was reported that the modification of the P1\u2019 site significantly improves the production of exogenous secreted proteins [35]. However, a low preference of selectivity for most residues at the P1\u2019 site by Kex2 depends on the residue at the P3\u2019 position and its binding to the S3 subsite [36]. In this study, NZ2114 was chosen as the object peptide, and the P1\u2019 site amino acid with optimal cutting efficiency was screened; both expression and druggability of the candidate F-NZ2114 (short for FNZ) of the AMP derivative were further studied."

The average molecular mass of recombinant FNZ measured by MALDI\u2013TOF MS was 4558.748 Da, which was consistent with the theoretical molecular weight.

In SDS solutions of 10, 20, and 40 mM, FNZ has a positive peak at 200 nm and a negative peak at about 215 nm, indicating that the \u03b2-sheet is the main structure of FNZ in SDS solution (Figure 6A).\nFigure 5.

By contrast, there was a decrease of 0.101 and 0.216 log10 CFU/mL, respectively, after treatment with control antibiotics of ampicillin and vancomycin (2\u00d7 MIC). Additionally, there was no growth of bacteria after 4 h of treatment with all concentrations of FNZ, showing superior to control antibiotics (Figure 6B). Furthermore, the number of colonies did not rebound until 24 h after treatment with FNZ, whereas the rebound situation was observed in the 2\u00d7 MIC of ampicillin treatment.\n2.7.4. The Post\u2212Antibiotic Effect (PAE) of FNZ against S. aureus As shown in Figure 6C, the PAE of FNZ to S. aureus ATCC 43300 was prolonged (2.18, 3.13, and 5.27 h, respectively) with the increasing concentration (at 1\u00d7 MIC, 2\u00d7 MIC, and 4\u00d7 MIC), whereas the PAE of vancomycin at 2\u00d7 MIC was 1.3 h. The long PAE of FNZ makes it possible to extend the interval of medication and decrease the daily dosages."

            "text": "In recent 30 years, P. pastoris has become one of the mostly used tools for heterologous protein production [37\u201340]. Kex2 is a Ca2+-dependent serine protease which can specifically recognize and cut the carboxy\u2013terminal peptide bond of Lys/Arg\u2013Arg [41]. Combined with the yeast ER sequestration screening (YESS) and next-generation sequencing, it is confirmed that the P1\u2019 site of Kex2 plays a key role in determining the cleavage and secretion of heterologous proteins [42]. It was found that the Ans in the P1\u2019 site of Kex2 could increase over fourfold of luciferase as much compared to the Cys in the P1\u2019 site [35]. Substitution of Glu by Val/Ala at Kex2 cleavage site P1\u2019 could increase by 3 times the production of extracellular colony\u2212stimulating factor [43]. However, there were no studies on P1\u2019 site optimization to improve the yields of AMPs so far as we know. We designed 20 sequences (Table S1) with a different residue at the P1\u2019 site of each other (Figure 1). Meanwhile, there is also a Ste13 restriction site in the \u03b1-factor signal peptide sequence, cleaving between Glu and Ala. This factor existing in protease has a certain degree of nonspecific cleavage, which may result in a miscleavage on the target protein [44]. Therefore, the gene of Ste13 was removed when the recombinant vector was designed. Through subsequent expression verification, the four transformants (G1, F39, R33, and W25) with higher expression from the 48-well plates, 250 mL, and 1 L shake flask level were selected to express in 5 L fermenter. The transformant F39 had the highest yield with a level of 4.81 g/L (ferment supernatant) (Figure 4D). In addition, the target peptide FNZ from F39 could be directly purified by one\u2212step ion exchange column. Thus, it is expected that it should be more suitable for the industrial aim of most target proteins due to its high expression, cleavage and easy purification. The pro\u2212leader of heterologous protein is translocated across the ER membrane to the lumen in yeast. The pre\u2212region is cleaved by signal peptidase, which can guide the translocation of newborn peptide chains into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); and the Kex2 protease recognizes and cuts Lys\u2013Arg recognition sites. The pro\u2212region ensures proper transport of newborn peptides from ER lumen to the Golgi apparatus, and the Ste13 protease cleavages two duplicate Glu\u2013Ala recognition sites. Finally, the mature protein is secreted out of the cytoplasm [45]. The structure of \u03b1\u2212signal peptide was simulated as the amino acid at P1\u2019 was changed (Figure 5). The S. cerevisiae \u03b1-MAT signal leader is composed of a pre-region with 19 amino acids and a pro-region of 66 amino acids [45,46]. The latter regulates receptor-dependent packaging that causes the concentration of secreted proteins in the COPII transport vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [31,47]. In this study, the secondary structure of the pre-peptide is still characteristic of multiple \u03b1-helices. However, \u03b2-sheet was dominant in the wild-type \u03b1-MAT pro-region, and three \u03b2-sheet structures were formed at amino acids 40\u201342, 51\u201354, and 63\u201365. In mutant \u03b1-MAT proregion, \u03b1-helix was dominant, amino acids 34\u201338 and 68\u201375 form two \u03b1-helical structures, so the secondary structure of the mutant is highly different from that of the wild type, changing tendency from \u03b2-sheet to \u03b1-helix, which may allow the secreted protein to escape\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 786 11 of 17\nfrom the receptor and enter more easily into the Golgi apparatus from the vesicle, thus increasing the secretion level of the protein. Due to the addition of the first amino acid in the N-terminal, it is essential to evaluate the antimicrobial characteristics of FNZ as a new peptide. We found that FNZ has narrow spectrum antibacterial activity similar to NZ2114 against target G+ bacteria [48,49] mainly to S. aureus, and Streptococcus sp. with the MICs ranging from 4 to 8 \u00b5g/mL (Table 1). However, the activity of FNZ reduced by twofold compared with parental peptide NZ2114 (Table 1). This might be attributed to new F at the P1\u2019 site, being as a bigger hydrophobic side-chain structure from the benzene ring group. Yes, its exact structure and mechanism should be preferentially studied in further study. Although the activity of FNZ to some pathogens decreased, the other more merits of druggability were observed. The killing rate of FNZ against S. aureus ATCC 43300 within 2 h was more than 99% at 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 MIC, which was better than those of vancomycin and ampicillin (Figure 6B). Furthermore, the number of colonies did not rebound until 24 h after treatment with FNZ, whereas the parental peptide NZ2114 could not inhibit bacterial regrowth after 6 h of inoculation for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (Table 4). The long drug efficacy span might be helpful to reduce the frequency of drug usage and prevent the occurrence of drug resistance. The PAE reflects the inhibitory effect on the growth of pathogen after short contact with the drug, which is related to the bactericidal characteristic of the drug [50]. The PAEs of FNZ were 2.18, 3.13, and 5.27 h at 1\u00d7 MIC, 2\u00d7 MIC, and, 4\u00d7 MIC, which are longer than that of NZ2114 at the same concentration (1.7, 2.6, and 3.5 h at 1\u00d7 MIC, 2\u00d7 MIC, and 4\u00d7 MIC) (Table 4) and vancomycin at 2\u00d7 MIC (Figure 6C). These results suggested that FNZ has the potential as a potent agent against S. aureus, especially MRSA strains.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 786 12 of 17\nIt has been shown that the combination of antimicrobial drugs is one of the strategies to improve antibacterial activity and retard drug resistance [51]. In this work, FNZ showed synergistic effect with antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin, and nisin with the FICI < 0.5 (Table 2), which was similar to the parental peptide NZ2114 (Table 4). This synergistic effect could significantly reduce the dose of antibiotics, effectively alleviating the development of antibiotic resistance of pathogens [52]. Maximizing antibacterial activity of AMPs with minimal host toxicity is an attractive direction [53]. A hemolysis test is mainly used to detect the rupture of red blood cells and determine whether drugs are harmful in vivo [54]. The NZ2114 showed no hemolysis in human MRBCs, while it had high host toxicity (cell survival rate: 52.13% at 128 \u00b5g/mL) to RAW264.7 cells (Table 4). In this study, FNZ showed no hemolysis and lower cytotoxicity (cell survival rate: 88.56%) even at 128 \u00b5g/mL, which was consistent with the decrease of activity caused by the change of the P1\u2019 site. The \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking between the benzene rings on the Phe side chain of the peptide could cause the hydrophobic part to tend to gather internally, reducing the surface area in contact with the polar environment and side effects in vivo, especially at the high peptide concentration [55]. Nevertheless, the high biosafety assures the FNZ a higher safe level as candidate drug for clinical usage. Meanwhile, similar to NZ2114 (Table 4), FNZ could retain half activity even when exposed to 100 \u25e6C for 1 h (Table 3). The high cysteine content might contribute to its thermal stability. AMPs act with the bacterial membrane through an interaction between a positively charged peptide and a negatively charged bacterial membrane [56\u201358]. This interaction subsequently leads to inactivation of the bacteria. However, the increasing concentration of cations in the environment can prevent the peptide from interacting with the membrane, thus nulling the efficiency to kill bacteria. In this work, FNZ showed strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus ATCC 43300 in the conditions of 300 mM Na+ solution and 150 mM Mg2+ solution (Table 3). This result indicates that FNZ is insensitive to the presence of cations and remains the antimicrobial activity in the presence of high concentrations of monovalent or divalent cations. Generally, the above main characteristics showed that FNZ meets the key needs as the new candidate of antimicrobial drug in treatment of G+ pathogenic bacteria in the aspect of safety, bioactivity, and stability as a whole."

The peptide solutions were mixed with bacteria suspension in the ratio of 1:9, and the final concentrations of FNZ were 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, and 4\u00d7 MIC, respectively. Samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 24 h, serially diluted, and visible colonies were counted on MHA plates [63]. The positive controls were vancomycin and ampicillin.\n4.7.3. The PAE of FNZ\nThe 108 CFU/mL S. aureus ATCC 43300 in mid-log phase was incubated to 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, and 4\u00d7 MIC of FNZ for 2 h. The PBS was used as a blank control, and vancomycin with the concentration of 2\u00d7 MIC was used as a positive control. After the exposed time, the bacteria suspension was reconstructed by dilution to 1000 times with MHB medium to remove the influence of peptides and antibiotics. Samples were taken every hour, and then coated on MHA plate after gradient dilution. The calculation formula was from previous studies [64].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 786 14 of 17\n4.7.4. Drug Synergism Assays of FNZ with Traditional Antibiotics\nThe checkerboard method was used to determine the interaction between FNZ and other antimicrobial drugs, which were vancomycin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, and nisin. The diluted samples with the concentrations of 1/16 to 8\u00d7 MIC were added into the 96-well plates and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 16 h. The effects of combination were evaluated by calculating the FICI. FICI \u2264 0.5 was defined as synergy, 0.5 < FICI \u2264 1 was defined as additivity, 1 < FICI \u2264 4 was defined as indifference, and FICI > 4 was defined as antagonism [65,66].\n4.8. Hemolysis, Cytotoxicity, and Stability of FNZ 4.8.1. Hemolysis\nThe FNZ with the concentrations of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 \u00b5g/mL was mixed with the 8% MRBCs suspension (diluted with 0.9% NaCl) in the ratio of 1:1. Then, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1844\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, and the absorption value was measured at 540 nm. Hemolysis (%) = [(A \u2212 A0)/(A100 \u2212 A0)] \u00d7 100%, A0: the blank control of 0.9% NaCl; A100: the positive control of 0.1% Triton X-100 [67].\n4.8.2. Cytotoxicity\nThe MTT assay was used to test the cytotoxicity of FNZ to the RAW 264.7 cells [68].\n4.8.3. Stability\nThe tolerance of FNZ to temperature and pH was evaluated [69]. The stability of FNZ in simulated gastric fluid, artificial intestinal fluid and mouse serum was carried out as previously described [70]. Sodium ions (Na+) and magnesium ions (Mg2+) at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, 300, and 500 mM were incubated with peptide solution at 37 \u25e6C for 1 h, and their MIC values were measured [71]. All assays were conducted in triplicate."

            "text": "In summary, the P1\u2019 site of Kex2 was optimized by replacing the P1\u2019 site with 20 amino acids, in turn, to enhance the expression level of NZ2114. It was shown that the yield significantly increased from the original 2.39 g/L to 4.81 g/L when the amino acid of the P1\u2019 site changed to F. Additionally, the novel candidate peptide FNZ also showed a strong antibacterial activity against G+ bacteria, especially to S. aureus and S. agalactiae (MIC: 4\u20138 \u00b5g/mL) despite it decreased by twofold compared with the parental peptide (Table 1). The FNZ was quite stable and retained high activity in various conditions. There was no hemolysis and low cytotoxicity even at a high concentration of 128 \u00b5g/mL. Above results show a successful harvest for molecular modification on Kex2 P1\u2019 site with the positive responses including expression, cleavage, bioactivities as antimicrobial characteristics and other druaggabilities. Thus, this updated yeast expression system might be tried to extend into the heterogeneous expression of other similar peptides and proteins at industrial scale depending on more trials case by case in the future.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antibiotics12040786/s1, Table S1: The amino acid sequences of 20 new constructs; Figure S1: The antibacterial activity of FNZ purified collected peak was identified by inhibition zone assay.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.J., R.M. and J.W. conceived and designed the experiments.
