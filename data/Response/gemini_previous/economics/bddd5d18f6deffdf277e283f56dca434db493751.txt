1. **Assessing the effectiveness of green fiscal stimulus measures in promoting renewable energy deployment and reducing carbon emissions in emerging economies.** This research could examine the impact of different types of green fiscal stimulus measures, such as tax incentives, subsidies, and public investment, on the adoption of renewable energy technologies and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It could also investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of these measures, such as the design of the stimulus package, the political and economic context, and the availability of complementary policies.


2. **Exploring the role of green conditionality in promoting sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging economies.** This research could examine the potential of green conditionality, which involves linking financial support to sustainability objectives, to promote green recovery in emerging economies. It could investigate the different forms of green conditionality, the challenges and opportunities associated with its implementation, and the effectiveness of green conditionality in achieving environmental and economic goals.


3. **Investigating the potential of debt-for-nature swaps as a mechanism for promoting green recovery and achieving climate targets in emerging economies.** This research could examine the potential of debt-for-nature swaps, which involve the conversion of outstanding debt into investments in environmental conservation and sustainable development, to promote green recovery and achieve climate targets in emerging economies. It could investigate the different types of debt-for-nature swaps, the challenges and opportunities associated with their implementation, and the effectiveness of debt-for-nature swaps in achieving environmental and economic goals.


4. **Developing a framework for assessing the alignment of economic recovery plans with sustainable energy and climate targets in emerging economies.** This research could develop a framework for assessing the alignment of economic recovery plans with sustainable energy and climate targets in emerging economies. The framework could include a set of indicators and criteria for evaluating the greenness of recovery plans, as well as a methodology for applying the framework to specific cases. The framework could be used to inform policy decisions and track progress towards achieving sustainable recovery and climate goals.


5. **Analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy sector in emerging economies and the implications for future energy policy.** This research could examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy sector in emerging economies, including the effects on energy demand, supply, and investment. It could also investigate the implications of the pandemic for future energy policy, such as the need for increased investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and the potential for green recovery measures to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.
