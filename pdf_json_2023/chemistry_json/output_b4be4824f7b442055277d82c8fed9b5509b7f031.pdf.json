    "abstractText": "The many pollutants detected in water represent a global environmental issue. Emerging and persistent organic pollutants are particularly difficult to remove using traditional treatment methods. Electro-oxidation and sulfate-radical-based advanced oxidation processes are innovative removal methods for these contaminants. These approaches rely on the generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals during electro-oxidation and sulfate activation, respectively. In addition, hybrid activation, in which these methods are combined, is interesting because of the synergistic effect of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals. Hybrid activation effectiveness in pollutant removal can be influenced by various factors, particularly the materials used for the anode. This review focuses on various organic pollutants. However, it focuses more on pharmaceutical pollutants, particularly paracetamol, as this is the most frequently detected emerging pollutant. It then discusses electro-oxidation, photocatalysis and sulfate radicals, highlighting their unique advantages and their performance for water treatment. It focuses on perovskite oxides as an anode material, with a particular interest in calcium copper titanate (CCTO), due to its unique properties. The review describes different CCTO synthesis techniques, modifications, and applications for water remediation.",

It results from the release into the environment of harmful substances that can cause harm to human health, wildlife and the natural environment. Environmental pollution, particularly water pollution, is a significant issue worldwide and its effects can be severe and longlasting [1\u20134]. Pharmaceutical products contribute to the water pollution problem. These pollutants, categorized as emerging contaminants, raise particular alarm due to their long persistence and potential effects on the environment and human health, even at low concentrations [5\u20138]. Therefore, the topic of this review is advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) able to degrade any organic micro pollutants such as drugs, pesticides, personal care products, dyes, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), etc., without generating any harmful by-product [9,10]. Moreover, AOP processes can be combined to obtain a synergetic effect. In particular, electro-oxidation or photocatalysis can be coupled with sulfate-radical-based AOP to increase the generation of reactive species and consequently\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13142119 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 2 of 29\nto improve the efficiency and selectivity for target contaminants [11,12]. The choice of anode material is crucial for sulfate activation and charge transfer in the electrocatalysis system. Perovskite can serve as an anode material due to the presence of oxides that can promote the formation of sulfate radicals and accelerate electron transfer. In particular, the CaCu3Ti4O12 material has shown a special interest in the field of degradation of organic pollutants by combining different AOP techniques, due to its unique and high electrical properties. This review is composed of three main sections. The first section describes water pollution. The second section presents AOPs for water treatment. The third section describes perovskite materials, their synthesis and modification techniques, and their potential applications in water treatment."

            "text": "Water pollution is caused by the introduction of harmful substances or contaminants (chemicals and bacteria) into water bodies. The sources of water pollution can be natural or human-made, including industrial activities, agriculture, urbanization, and sewage disposal [13\u201315]. Water pollution can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and wildlife, as well as on human health, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water is limited. Chemicals, nutrients, pathogens, heavy metals, and plastics are some of the most common water pollutants. Addressing water pollution requires effective wastewater management and treatment, regulation of industrial activities, and sustainable agricultural practices [8\u201320]. Water pollution can have harmful effects on human health [16,17] and significantly affects environmental systems [8,18\u201321]. Furthermore, water sources can be contaminated by chemical, nutrient, biological, physical, and radiological pollution. Recent studies have shown that worldwide, chemical pollution is the most prevalent type of water pollution, particularly pharmaceutical pollutants.\nPharmaceutical Pollution, Source, Occurrence\nPharmaceuticals are commonly used to prevent and treat diseases in humans and animals. They are considered emerging contaminants due to their persistent nature and potential to harm aquatic ecosystems [22,23]. There are different classes of pharmaceuticals in function of their therapeutic purpose. Antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol), antivirals (oseltamivir and zanamivir), antidiabetics (sulfonylurea), antidepressants (alprazolam and benzodiazepines), antiepileptics (felbamate and carbamazepine), analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen), and hormones (estriol) [24] are among the most used drugs. Many emerging pharmaceuticals have been detected in aquatic environments at varying concentrations, from ng/L to mg/L (Table 1). Despite these low concentrations, they may have very harmful effects. Pharmaceuticals may end up in wastewater treatment plants through different routes, including agricultural activities, domestic sewage, landfill sites, industrial effluents, septic tanks, urban wastewater, and even routine activities [25,26].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 3 of 29\nTable 1.

Paracetamol concentrations from 0.1 to 400 \u00b5g/L have been detected in effluent samples collected in different countries, such as 11.3 \u00b5g/L in French wastewater treatment plants [38], 150 \u00b5g/L in the USA wastewater treatment plants [39], and 11.7 \u00b5g/L in the United Kingdom wastewater treatment plants [40].

These methods are categorized as homogeneous and heterogeneous in function of the catalyst form. Homogeneous systems are very efficient for the degradation of various pollutants via PMS/PDS activation. However, they can harm the ecosystems and are difficult to recycle. This limits their practical applicability. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated recently [84]. Li et al. studied PMS activation by Fe0 for atrazine removal [85]. They showed that Fe0 corrosion leads to the generation of Fe2+ ions that activate PMS to produce sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and the formation of Fe(IV) to mineralize atrazine (Figure 9a). Tan et al. assessed PMS activation by CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 for paracetamol degradation (10 mg/L). Both catalysts efficiently degraded paracetamol via PMS activation by Mn2+-Mn3+/Fe3+-Fe2+ recycle and Co2+-Co3+/Fe3+-Fe2+ [86].\nAlkaline Activation\nPDS and PMS activation are influenced by the solution pH. At alkaline pH, PDS forms sulfate radicals that are then transformed into hydroxyl radicals, as described by Equations (7)\u2013(9) [87].\nS2O82\u2212 + H2O\u2192 2SO4\u2022\u2212 + HO2\u2212 + H+ (7)\nS2O82\u2212 + HO2\u2212 \u2192 SO4\u2022\u2212 + SO42\u2212 + O2\u2022\u2212 + H+ (8)\nHSO5\u2212 + OH\u2212 \u2192 SO52\u2212 + H2O (9)\nQi et al. first reported the pathway of peroxymonosulfate activation by alkaline conditions [88].

In addition, Yang et al. showed that PMS activation in alkaline conditions (addition of 2 mM NaOH) enhances methylene blue degradation [89] (Figure 9b). Upon PMS activation in the alkaline solution, methylene blue was completely removed in 45 min.\nCarbonaceous-Based Materials\nCarbon-based materials also can activate PDS/PMS and display several advantages, particularly a large specific surface area and cost-effectiveness. PDS/PMS activation is facilitated by the donation of electrons from carbon-based materials following Equations (10) and (11).\nS2O82\u2212 + e\u2212 \u2192 SO4\u2022\u2212 + SO42\u2212 (10)\nHSO5\u2212 + e\u2212 \u2192 SO4\u2022\u2212 + OH\u2212 (11)\nYao et al. showed that PDS alone cannot degrade p-chloroaniline [90], and activated carbon can degrade only 40% (Figure 9c).

The formula of single perovskite (Figure 11a) is ABX3 (CaTiO3): A and B are cations and X are anions (typically oxygen). The radius of the A ions is larger than that of B metal ions [98\u2013100]. Single perovskite is used in many different applications, such as gas permeation membranes, metal\u2013air batteries, magnetic devices, and heterogeneous catalysis [101,102]. However, single perovskite may not provide sufficient stability or performance.

They are hydrolyzed and condensed in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g., ethanol) in controlled conditions (pH,\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 16 of 29\ntemperature, and time). The resulting gel is dried, calcined, and sintered to produce the final CCTO product (Figure 12b) [123\u2013125]. Liu et al. used the sol\u2013gel method to prepare fine CCTO powders. First, they dissolved tetrabutyl titanate, calcium nitrate, and copper(II) nitrate (in stoichiometric amounts) in ethanol [126]. Second, they aged the gel at room temperature for 2 h followed by drying at 120 \u25e6C. Third, they obtained a black CCTO powder by calcination of the gel precursor in air at 900 \u25e6C. Pang et al. investigated different calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800 and 900 \u25e6C) [127]. To prepare CCTO nanoparticles with the sol\u2013gel method, they dissolved stoichiometric amounts of calcium acetate hydrate and copper acetate hydrate in acetic acid. Then, they added this solution, drop by drop, into a solution that contained a titanium precursor. After the addition of ethylene glycol and forming amide to stabilize the solution, they stirred it for 5 min. They found that CCTO calcined at 900 \u25e6C exhibited the greatest photodegradation efficiency.\nCo-Precipitation\nThe co-precipitation method, described in Figure 12c, requires the simultaneous precipitation of cations in the form of hydroxides or carbonates from their respective soluble salts, followed by calcination to form the desired oxide. Briefly, the precursor solution is prepared by mixing copper nitrate, calcium nitrate, and titanium tetraisopropoxide (stoichiometric amounts) in a solvent. Then, a precipitating agent, such as ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, is added to the solution to initiate the precipitation of the cations in the form of hydroxides or carbonates. This is followed by filtration, washing, drying and calcination [128,129]. Barbier et al. prepared CCTO using this method. First, they dissolved metal chlorides (CaCl2, TiCl3, and CuCl2\u00b72H2O) in water and then added them to the precipitating agent (oxalic acid mixed in ethanol) [130]. This was followed by calcination in air at 950 \u25e6C for 10 h to obtain the CCTO powder. Kumari et al. produced CCTO using the co-precipitation method, as explained by Equation (15) [131]:\nCaCl2 + 3Cu(NO3)2.3H2O + 4TiCl4 + 19NaOH\u2192 CaCu3Ti4O12 + 19NaCl + 6HNO3 + 16 H2O (15)\nBriefly, they dissolved calcium chloride (CaCl2) and copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O) in water, and then added a titanium tetrachloride (4TiCl4)-HCl saturated solution. After stirring, they added the obtained solution, drop by drop, to an aqueous solution of 0.8 M NaOH that was stirred at a constant speed. This resulted in a milky blue color solution. Then, they washed the obtained precipitation, followed by pulverization into a fine powder and calcination to obtain the CCTO powder.\n4.1.3. Combustion System\nThe combustion synthesis method (or self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method) is a cheap approach to fabricate homogeneous nanopowders and single-phase materials, such as ceramics, catalysts, composites, alloys, intermetallics, and nanomaterials. The method is based on a self-sustaining solid flame-combustion reaction for a short period, and does not need the high reaction temperatures that are typically required for ceramic synthesis. Instead of placing the sample in a furnace, high temperature is achieved via an exothermic chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant present in the precursor solution that maintains the high temperature for the time required to form the final product (i.e., 30\u201345 s). During this chemical reaction to produce heat, a large amount of gas is released, leading to the synthesis of a nanosized, porous, and foamy product [109,132]. Kumari et al. used metal nitrates, titanium isopropoxide, anhydrous citric acid, and acetyl acetone as raw materials. The auto-combustion involved mixing citric acid dissolved in de-ionized water with the titanium precursor dissolved in acetyl acetone. This was followed by an addition to the titanium solution of copper nitrate trihydrate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate dissolved in de-ionized water. The solution was stirred and after the\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 17 of 29\naddition of ammonia, it was heated to allow for water evaporation and the formation of a viscous blue gel. Then, a porous structure was obtained by heating the gel at 450 \u25e6C for 15 min, followed by grinding into a fine powder and heating at 950 \u25e6C for 8 h to obtain oxides. The obtained CCTO powder contained some impurities, such as CaTiO3 and CuO, that can affect its properties. Additionally, the prolonged heat treatment caused the formation of CuO that led to an increase in the grain size to 600 nm [131].\n4.1.4. Microwave-Assisted Synthesis\nMicrowave energy may be used at the place of calcination to prepare pure-phase CCTO powders. The microwave heating process generates heat rapidly and uniformly throughout the reaction vessel, resulting in a shorter reaction time and lower processing temperature. Microwave-assisted synthesis relies on the heating effect generated by the microwave energy. This effect is primarily due to the interaction of microwaves with the polar molecules present in the precursor solution [133,134]. Yu et al. used the microwave-assisted solid-state method to fabricate CCTO pellets. Briefly, they mixed the precursors (CaCO3, CuO and TiO2) in a ball mill for 24 h and pressed them into pellets [135] that were calcinated by microwave heating for 30 min. The obtained ceramics displayed higher dielectric constant values than ceramics prepared using conventional synthesis methods, even when sintered in the same conditions. CCTO synthesis methods (sol\u2013gel, microwave, solid state, combustion, and co-precipitation) play a crucial role in determining its properties. Sol\u2013gel methods produce large amounts of CCTO with controlled composition, but require long reaction times, expensive starting materials and the production of secondary phases due to the used solvent [136,137]. Combustion methods allow for better controlling the precursor stoichiometry, but not the morphology. Moreover, with these techniques, contaminants are formed due to the presence of carbonaceous residues [138]. The solid-state method has many advantages (simplicity, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and high-temperature stability), but does not allow for controlling the composition and morphology well [139]."

Metal doping can alter CCTO electronic and structural properties and improve its performance in various applications. Changing the atmosphere treatment, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, also significantly affects CCTO properties. These modifications have shown promising results for improving CCTO performance in various applications, making it a promising material for future research and development.\n4.2.1. CCTO Doping\nDoping is a commonly used method to modify CCTO properties (i.e., dielectric constant, dielectric loss, electrical conductivity). Various types of dopants, such as Fe, Co, and Mn, have been tested. Indeed, the dopant type and concentration can significantly influence CCTO properties, and the optimal doping conditions may vary in function of the intended application. CCTO can be doped with different elements (one or two elements) and at different sites (Ca, Cu, and Ti) to modify its features. Table 6 lists the results of some of the many studies on CCTO doping.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 18 of 29\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 19 of 29\n4.2.2. Atmosphere Treatment of CCTO\nCCTO can also be treated in different atmospheres, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, to modify its properties. However, the literature on this topic is relatively limited, and the effects of these treatments are not fully understood. Some articles reported promising results in terms of enhancing CCTO specific properties, but more research is needed to determine the optimal conditions for each application [153\u2013155]. Damas et al. [156] found that in the presence of nitrogen, CCTO decomposes into Cu2O, TiO2 and CaTiO3. Zaho et al. [157] studied the effect of different treatments (air, oxygen, and nitrogen) on CCTO composition by X-ray diffraction. In the as-prepared CCTO sample, they observed the presence of the CCTO phase and peaks related to CuO. Upon oxygen and air treatment, they could no longer detect the CuO peaks, only the CCTO phase. On the other hand, after nitrogen treatment, they observed different peaks, including the CuO, CaTiO3, and TiO2 peaks, confirming CCTO decomposition upon nitrogen treatment. In energy storage applications, an oxidizing atmosphere increased the CCTO storage energy density from 7.7 to 26.5 kJ/m3, decreased the direct current loss, and increased the grain boundary activation energy to 0.85 eV. To summarize, CCTO proprieties can be modified by different methods. CCTO can be doped with different metals (e.g., nickel, tungsten, and cobalt) to modify its resistance, grain size, and dielectric constant. These modifications improve its performance for various applications. Changing the atmosphere treatment also significantly influences CCTO properties.

            "text": "After confirming the efficiency of CCTO materials in the laboratory for degrading different pollutants, it will be important to investigate their performance using real water samples. Indeed, real samples may contain other impurities and contaminants that can affect the performance of CCTO materials. These impurities and contaminants present in real water can include organic matter, heavy metals, inorganic ions, and various organic pollutants. The presence of such substances can introduce challenges and complexities in the degradation process, potentially affecting the reaction kinetics and overall performance of the CCTO materials [167,168]. Hence, it is essential to conduct experiments using real water samples to simulate realistic conditions and evaluate the practical effectiveness of the CCTO materials. By studying the impact of real water on the degradation capabilities of CCTO, researchers can gain valuable insights into the material\u2019s performance under more representative conditions, ensuring its suitability for real-world water treatment scenarios. Furthermore, investigating the quenching effect caused by organic matter in the water samples is particularly important. Organic matter can act as scavengers or quenchers, competing with the target contaminants for reactive species generated during the degradation process. Understanding how organic matter affects the degradation efficiency of CCTO materials is crucial for optimizing their performance and developing practical strategies to mitigate any quenching effects. Some studies described the effect of real water in AOPs using different materials, such as titanante [167]; however, no study has assessed the effects of real water samples on CCTO efficiency. To further enhance the practical applicability of CCTO materials in water treatment, it is important to investigate their performance in continuous processes at a larger scale. Labscale experiments provide valuable insights into the material\u2019s efficiency, but translating these results to continuous operations is essential for real-world implementations [169,170]. Scaling up the CCTO-based water treatment processes requires considering various factors such as reactor design, flow rates, residence time, and operational parameters. The design of continuous systems should ensure efficient contact between the water and CCTO material, allowing for effective pollutant degradation while maintaining a stable and consistent performance over extended periods. Continuous processes also enable the evaluation of the long-term stability and durability of the CCTO materials under realistic conditions. Factors like fouling, material degradation, and the accumulation of by-products need to be assessed to ensure the sustained performance and reliability of the system. Moreover,\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2119 22 of 29\nprocess optimization becomes crucial when transitioning from lab-scale to larger-scale continuous operations. This involves optimizing parameters such as CCTO material loading, flow rates, and operational conditions to maximize the treatment efficiency while minimizing energy consumption and operational costs [170,171]. Pilot-scale or full-scale demonstrations should be conducted to validate the performance of CCTO materials in continuous water treatment processes at a larger scale. These demonstrations provide insights into the scalability, economic feasibility, and reliability of the technology, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of its potential for commercial implementation. Doping CCTO with cobalt offers several advantages for water treatment such as improving the activation of sulfate radicals. However, this approach is limited by cobalt leakage into the solution and CCTO membrane instability. To address these limitations, the membrane can be stabilized using various methods, such as a thin coating of the membrane surface by an atomic layer deposition or by a thermal treatment of the membrane after its use. In addition, CCTO has many interesting advantages for numerous applications, specifically for water treatment and in various fields. Therefore, it is important to further study the potential of CCTO membranes in different conditions, such as electro-Fenton, or by coupling different processing techniques. Electro-oxidation processes require a significant amount of electrical energy to drive the oxidation reactions. This could be addressed by using solar energy. CCTO contains TiO2 and copper. TiO2 is the most promising phase for photocatalytic applications, particularly when using UV light. Moreover, the presence of copper in CCTO facilitates the shift in TiO2 adsorption to visible light wavelengths [172]. Therefore, CCTO could be used in solar-energy-based pollutant removal processes that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. However, more research and development are needed to optimize CCTO properties for various applications, such as enhancing its photocatalytic efficiency, electro-Fenton process, and developing novel processing techniques to improve its stability and performance. Finally, a crucial step would be transitioning to a continuous system that closely simulates industrial conditions."

            "text": "This review described the harmful effects of water pollution on human health and the environment and the detection of various pollutant types (physical, chemical, nutrient, and radioactive) in wastewater. Among them, chemical pollution, specifically emerging pollutants, is particularly concerning due to the persistence of such molecules. Paracetamol presents the highest concentration in surface water worldwide. Similarly, in France, paracetamol was the most commonly detected (27%) emerging pollutant. AOPs could be part of the solution to this issue because they can mineralize persistent compounds. Many studies showed that different AOPs can remove paracetamol. In this review, particular attention was focused on electro-oxidation and the parameters affecting its performance. Sulfate-based AOPs and their activation methods for the formation of sulfate radicals were also discussed. The hybrid activation process (electro-oxidation/PMS) combines the synergic effect of the two systems for the degradation of water pollutants. In these systems, the anode material strongly influences the performance. This review showed that the CCTO perovskite material has several advantages, such as a high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, high-temperature stability, and nonlinear current\u2013voltage characteristics. The synthesis method, doping, and atmosphere treatment significantly influence the CCTO performance. Doping decreases the dielectric loss and increases the grain boundary size. Furthermore, nitrogen treatment leads to CCTO decomposition into TiO2, CaTiO3, and CuO. CCTO materials can reduce emerging compounds using different systems, such as photocatalysis, PMS activation by light, and photo-electrocatalysis. The future trend in the field of water treatment applications is to develop continuous systems for water treatment by exploring synergistic approaches (electro-oxidation/PMS) to enhance the overall efficiency and degradation capabilities.
