    "abstractText": "Minor genera actinomycetes are considered a promising source of new secondary metabolites. The strain Kribbella sp. CA-293567 produces sandramycin and kribbellichelins A & B In this work, we describe the complete genome sequencing of this strain and the in silico identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), focusing on the pathways encoding sandramycin and kribbellichelins A\u2013B. We also present a comparative analysis of the biosynthetic potential of 38 publicly available genomes from Kribbella strains.",

            "text": "The increasing number of antibiotic resistant strains has boosted the search of new antibiotics that are urgently needed against pathogenic bacteria [1\u20134]. Natural products represent the most important source of novel antibiotics, being the actinomycetes the most prolific producers of natural bioactive compounds [5\u20138]. Actinomycetes are Gram-positive filamentous bacteria with a high G+C DNA content [9,10]. More than 50% of the bioactive compounds produced by actinomycetes have been isolated from the predominant genus Streptomyces [9,11]. However, in recent decades, minor genera of actinomycetes, also known as rare actinomycetes, have received considerable research attention [8,12]. Minor genera of actinomycetes have been found in a wide variety of underexplored terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems [13\u201315], including soil, sediments, stones, mangroves, plants, lichens and animals from a broad range of environments [16]. From the 220 minor genera of actinomycetes described so far, some of them can be more frequently isolated from different sources and have been shown to produce a high diversity of secondary metabolites: Actinocorallia, Actinomadura, Actinoplanes, Amycolatopsis, Kibdelosporangium, Kribbella, Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Nonomuraea, Pseudonocardia, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora or Streptosporangium [14,16]. Some of these genera are well known as producers of relevant antibiotics with clinical applications, including rifamycins from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, vancomycin from Amycolatopsis orientalis, erythromycin from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, teicoplanin from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, and gentamicin from Micromonospora purpurea [17]. The importance of minor genera of actinomycetes has been corroborated by the discovery of several novel compounds in the last years [14\u201323], such as kongjuemycins [23], catellatolactams [24], and persicamidines [25], so these genera represent an untapped resource of potential new bioactive natural products [17,26]. The significant advances in bacterial genome sequencing and the development of bioinformatic genome mining tools, has resulted in the identification of an extraordinary high number of silent or cryptic secondary metabolite BGCs encoding potentially novel compounds that have yet to be identified and are not expressed under standard laboratory culture conditions [27\u201333]. The growing number of reports on the discovery of cryptic gene\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020265 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265 2 of 15\nclusters from sequenced minor genera of actinomycetes highlights increasing opportunities to discover new bioactive natural products from this broad diversity of lineages [34]. The genus Kribbella belongs to the family Kribbellaceae (order Propionibacteriales) and currently consists of 33 species [35,36]. Some active secondary metabolites have been described from Kribbella strains: the kribellosides A\u2013D, RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase inhibitors from Kribbella sp. MI481-42F6 [37]; the cyclic decadepsipeptide antitumor antibiotic sandramycin (Figure 1) from K. sandramycini ATCC 39419T [38,39] and the antibiotics kribbellichelins A-B from the recently described Kribbella sp.

Structures of sandramycin and kribbellichelins A and B.\nThere are currently 38 sequenced genomes of Kribbella strains in NCBI, including the genome of the sandramycin producer K. sandramycini ATCC 39419T. Sandramycin was described nearly 30 years ago, but its BGC was only mentioned in a recent publication describing the biosynthetic gene cluster of luzopeptins and korkomicins [41]. However, a detailed analysis of the genes involved in sandramycin biosynthesis has not been reported yet. In this work, we present the complete genome sequence analysis of the strain Kribbella sp. CA-293567 and the identification of the putative BGCs present in the genome, focusing on the BGCs encoding kribbellichelins and sandramycin. The comparative genome analysis of all publicly available sequenced Kribbella strains has permitted us to perform a detailed analysis of the biosynthetic potential among the species of the genus."

In addition to the NRPS genes, the BLAST analysis of the proteins encoded by these ORFs shows the presence of an aspartate 1- decarboxylase (Krb30) that could be involved in the biosynthesis of \u03b2-Ala from Asp [59]; enzymes related with the biosynthesis of dipicolinic acid [60], transcriptional regulators and transporters. Kribbellichelins A and B also harbor two moieties of methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydrox ypicolinate connected to carbons C-11 and C-27 of the \u03b2-Ala units [40]. Accordi g to PRISM, an AMP-binding protein present in the cluster (Krb26) is predicted o activ te 3-hydroxypicolinic acid, as it has been described in the case of SanJ, an ATP-dependent picolinate CoA ligase involved in nikkomycin biosynthesis [61]. SanJ and Krb26 share a 35.8% identity and 49.8% similarity. Thus, Krb26 could be involved in the activation of the methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate moieties, that would be loaded onto a thiolation (T) domain encoded elsewhere in the genome (Figure 4). A gene related with the meso-diaminopimelate pat way (lysine bi synthesis), krb29, is present in the cluster. BLAST analysis Krb29 showe that it is a 4-hydr x te rahydrodipicolin te reductase homologous to DapB (90% identity, 95% similarity, Table S2), which catalyzes the reduction\nof (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate to 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate in an\nNADH/NADPH dependent reaction [60,62]. The role of Krb29 in the biosynthesis of\nthe methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate moieties present in kribbellichelins would\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265 5 of 15\nrequire further investigation. It is probable that any of the oxidases and methyltransferases present in the cluster may hydroxylate and methylate dipicolinic acid to yield methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate.\nBoth NRPSs (Krb18 and Krb24) contain two modules including the expected condensation (C), adenylation (A), and thiolation (T) domains. The substrate specificity analysis of the A domains performed with antiSMASH and PRISM suggest incorporation of \u03b2-Ala, L-ser, \u03b2-Ala and Orn for modules 1\u20134, respectively (Figure 3). The thioesterase (TE) domain present in the second NRPS (Krb24) would hydrolyze the peptidic chain. An additional condensation domain is present between the two modules present in Krb24 (Figure 3). According to the predictions described above and to the co-linearity rule [63], the peptide sequence of kribbellichelins A and B would be \u03b2-Ala-Ser-\u03b2-Ala-N5-OH-Orn. However, the order of the amino acids in the structure is \u03b2-Ala-Ser-N5-OH-Orn-\u03b2-Ala, and two moieties of methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate are connected to the \u03b2-Ala units. Thus, we propose a non-canonical assembly of kribbellichelins A and B (Figure 4): the\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265 6 of 15\nactivated methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate would be transferred to the \u03b2-amino groups of the \u03b2-Ala amino acids loaded into the T domains of modules 1 and 3 of Krb18 and Krb24, respectively. This would then be followed by the independent assembly of methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5-dihydroxypicolinate-\u03b2-Ala-Ser by Krb18 and methyl 6-carbonyl-4,5dihydroxypicolinate-\u03b2-Ala-N5-OH-Orn by Krb24. Finally, amide formation between the \u03b4 carbon of N5-OH-Orn and the carboxylic group of Ser (Figure 4), which might be catalyzed by the extra condensation domain found in Krb24, would lead to kribbellichelin A. One of the methyltransferases present in the cluster would methylate kribbellichelin A at carbonyl C-23 to yield kribbellichelin B [40]. A similar post-assembly connection of two separate chains synthesized in parallel assembly lines has been proposed for the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide alpiniamide A by a hybrid PKS-NRPS [64].

The lysine cyclodeaminase RapL has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the generation of the pipecolate moiety of rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicous by the direct cyclodeamination of Llysine [67]. The san cluster contains the gene san2, encoding a protein homologous to RapL (58% identity/70% similarity) which is proposed to biosynthesize the pipecolic acid present in the molecule.

This chromophore is also present in other structurally related depsipeptides such as SW-163 C-G [72], thiocoraline [73], BE-22179 [74] or quinaldopeptin [75], and is the starter unit used during the assembly line of these NRPSs [76].

Another structural characteristic of sandramycin is the presence of the aromatic chromophore 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (3HQA) attached to D-Ser [39]. This chromophore is also present in other structurally related depsipeptides such as SW-163 C-G [72], thiocoraline [73], BE-22179 [74] or quinaldopeptin [75], and is the starter unit used during the assembly line of these NRPSs [76]. The biosynthesis of 3HQA, derived from L-Trp, has been described in the thiocoraline BGC [65,76]: L-Trp is first bound to TioK, a small monomodular NRPS protein formed by a didomain A\u2013T module, which needs the structural assistance of the MbtH-like protein TioT. The attached L-Trp is then \u03b2-hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 TioI, and the resulting \u03b2-hydroxy-L-Trp is released by the type II thioesterase TioQ. Then, the Trp-2,3-dioxygenase TioF opens the indole ring, generating N-formyl-\u03b2-hydroxykynurenine. Loss of this formyl moiety can be spontaneous, or other enzymes could be involved (TioL, TioM). The resulting molecule, \u03b2-hydroxykynurenine, is transformed into 3,4-dihydroxy-quinaldic acid by the aminotransferase TioG. Finally, the oxidoreductase TioH converts 3,4-dihydroxy-quinaldic acid into 3HQA. The san BGC contains genes encoding proteins homologous to TioK (san4), TioT (san13), TioI (san5), TioQ (san6), TioF (san9), TioG (san8), TioJ (san3) and TioH (san7), but no homologous to TioL or\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265 8 of 15\nTioM were identified. This indicates that the biosynthes of the 3HQA moiety present in sandramycin occurs in the same way described for thiocoraline, but the loss of the formyl moiety of N-formyl-\u03b2-hydroxykynurenine may be spontaneous [76]. Similar to what has been described in thiocoraline biosynthesis [65,77], the starter unit of sandramycin would be 3HQA, that would be activated by the TioJ homolog San3. The San3-activated 3HQA may be loaded onto a fatty acid synthase (FAS) thiolation (T) domain FabC located outside of the sandramycin gene cluster, as in the case of thiocoraline [77]. Two ORFs of the san cluster, san11 and san12, encode two NRPS containing a total of five modules (Figure 5), whose characteristics agree with the sandramycin peptide backbone (D-Ser, Pipecolic acid, L-Gly, N-Met-L-Gly (sarcosine) and N-Met-L-Val). The five modules of the NRPS contain five A domains that are predicted to activate D-Ser, L-Gly, L-Gly, L-Gly and L-Val, respectively. The first amino acid in the sandramycin peptide backbone is a D-Ser, and an epimerization domain (E) is present in the first module. The last two amino acids, L-Gly and L-Val are N-methylated, forming N-MetGly (sarcosine) and N-MetVal; these modifications may be performed by the N-methyltransferase domains (nMT) present in the last two modules. Thus, the predicted modified peptide synthesized by the NRPS, according to the collinearity rule [63], would be D-Ser, L-Gly, L-Gly, N-MetGly and N-MetVal, which agrees with the sandramycin reported backbone. Moreover, the presence of a condensation (C) domain in the first module of San11 (C1), instead of the standard loading module composed just by an A and a T domain [78], confirms that the 3HQA activated by San3 is the starter unit and is attached to the D-Ser by the C1 domain, as it has been described in similar BGCs [76]. While C1, C3, C4 and C5 condensation domains are LCL-type domains which catalyze peptide bond formation between two L-amino acids, the C2 condensation domain is a DCL-type domain, which catalyzes the condensation between a D-aminoacyl/peptidyl-T donor and a L-aminoacyl-T acceptor [79], and in the case of the sandramycin biosynthesis, this domain would catalyze the peptide bond formation between D-Ser and pipecolic acid. Finally, the thioesterase domain (TE) present in the last module would be involved in the peptide-chain release and cyclization. As sandramycin is a dimer of two identical NRP chains [39] (Figure 1), the TE domain is proposed to catalyze both the dimerization and the macrolactonization of the molecule, as it has been demonstrated in vitro with the TE domains involved in the biosynthesis of the NRP gramicidin [80] or in the polyketides conglobatin [81] and elaiophylin [82]. A \u201cbackwards transfer\u201d mechanism was proposed for this type of biosynthesis: a T-bound PK/NRP chain is proposed to attack the thioester of an identical PK/NRP chain tethered to the downstream TE domain, sending it \u201cbackwards\u201d to the T domain. The linear dimer is then returned to the active site of the TE domain for macrocyclization [80,83] (Figure 6). Further experiments will be needed to confirm this type of chain release mechanism. Other genes present in the san BGC encode two transcriptional regulators (San10 and San15), a protein homologous to the thiocoraline resistance protein TioX (San1) [84], a HNH endonuclease (San18), two ABC transporters (San16 and San17) and an unknown protein (San14) (Figure 5, Table S4)."

The results show the presence of several groups of similar BGCs (Figure 7), which were mostly identified as NRPS-PKS-I-trans-AT PKS, NAPAA, Class II and III lanthipeptides, siderophores and RiPPs.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 265 9 of 15\nThe kribbellichelins BGC has also been shown to be present in the strains K. antibiotica JCM 13523, K. albertanoniae JCM 30547, K. italica DSM 28967 and K. sandramycini DSM 15626 (ATCC 39419T). Furthermore, a BLAST search of the krb biosynthetic gene cluster against the NCBI whole genome sequence database found homologous clusters in several Streptomyces strains (Figure 8). The organization of the cluster is very conserved among the strains, except for Kribbella antibiotica JCM 13523, whose NRPS2 includes an additional module incorporating \u03b2-Ala. It is worth noting that the krb cluster lacks genes involved in N5-OH-Orn biosynthesis, while the homologous clusters harbor a lysine/ornithine Nmonooxygenase. However, a lysine/ornithine N-monooxygenase is present in the genome of the strain CA-293567, so it is probable that the kribbellichelins biosynthesis is fed with N5-OH-Orn synthesized outside the krb BGC.

Proposed NRPS assembly line of sandramycin: two identical peptide chains are synthesized, and the T-bound PK/NRP chain is proposed to attack the thioester of the second chain tethered to the TE domain, sending it \u201cbackwards\u201d to the ACP domain. The linear dimer is then returned to the active site of the TE domain for macrocyclization.\nOther genes present in the san BGC encode two transcriptional regulators (San10 and San15), a protein homologous to the thiocoraline resistance protein TioX (San1) [84], a HNH endonuclease (San18), two ABC transporters (San16 and San17) and an unknown protein (San14) (Figure 5, Table S4).\n3.5. Comparative Genomic Analysis of Kribbella Strains The publicly available genomes of 38 Kribbella strains (Table S1) were analyzed with antiSMASH to identify putative secondary metabolite BGCs. The 453 predicted BGCs, including those obtained from the strain CA-293567, were used as input for BiGSCAPE/CORASON analysis to calculate the distances and to map the BGC diversity onto sequence similarity networks (Figure 7). Of the 453 BGCs analyzed, only 57 possess sequence similarities \u226570% with annotated BGCs in the MIBiG repository of antiSMASH and might produce characterized metabolites or potential analogues. Thus, nearly the 87% of the BGCs within the network might produce yet to be discovered metabolites.\nFigure 6.

The linear dimer is then returned to the active site of the TE domain for macrocyclization.\nSurprisingly, the sandramycin BGC present in Kribbella sp. CA-293567 was not clustered with the two homologous pathways found in the K. sandramycini genomes (Figure 7), despite their high similarity. This may be caused by the fact that the sandramycin BGC antiSMASH prediction from K. sandramycini genomes includes more NRPS genes than those that e predicted in Kribella sp. CA-293567 in the same region. These superclusters, which are composed of subclusters with different biosynthetic features, are not properly resolved by antiSMASH, causing that BiG-SCAPE, which calculates BGC distances using a combination of the Jaccard Index of domain types, the Domain Sequence Similarity and the djacency Index [50], does not accurately group similar BGCs since they are assigned to different families (Figure 9), as it has been previously report in other comparative genome analysis [85].
