 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Evaluate the performance of domain-specific medical LLMs (e.g. trained on clinical notes or biomedical literature) compared to general purpose LLMs on various clinical tasks. This could provide insights into whether specialized medical training improves accuracy.

2. Develop prompting techniques tailored for medical applications to optimize LLM performance on clinical tasks. For example, explore chain-of-thought prompting or self-consistency prompting for patient education responses. 

3. Examine strategies to mitigate bias and inaccuracies in LLM outputs for healthcare, such as novel training methodologies or human-in-the-loop systems. Quantify how different techniques impact fairness and accuracy.

4. Conduct user studies with patients and healthcare professionals to assess the usability and utility of LLMs for clinical workflows. Gather feedback to iteratively improve LLM design.

5. Explore techniques to enhance patient privacy when using LLMs for clinical applications. Evaluate approaches such as federated learning and on-device deployment to maintain confidentiality.
