            "text": "Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) is a common clinical phenomenon in newborns[1]. The condition from a metabolic imbalance between the production and elimination of bilirubin[2]. NH is generally benign and transient, but about one in ten neonates are likely to develop clinically severe hyperbilirubinemia[3]. Infants with severe NH may progress to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairments or even death[4]. The etiology of NH is complex, and risk factors for severe NH include genetic, maternal, perinatal, neonatal and other factors[3]. Besides, Asian neonates are at higher risk of hyperbilirubinemia[5]. Based on the crippling complications of NH and the huge population base of China, early recognition of high risk factors are particularly important in Chinese neonates, which will contribute to timely intervention and adequate management to reduce the occurrence of sequelae.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble micronutrient and steroid hormone precursor that plays an essential role in human health. It regulates calcium homoeostasis and influences many physiological functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune function and inflammation[6]. Hyperbilirubinemia and vitamin D deficiency are issues of concern in neonates, and one step in both bilirubin and vitamin D synthesis occurs in the liver, although the metabolic pathways are different[7]. Therefore, it is speculated that vitamin D levels may be associated with hyperbilirubinemia in newborn. To our knowledge, only a few studies investigated the relationship between hyperbilirubinemia and vitamin D levels and the results are controversial[8\u201311].\nSome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the vitamin D metabolism genes including 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, NAD synthetase 1 (NADSYN1/DHCR7), vitamin D binding protein (GC), 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) and 1-\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), have been linked to 25(OH) D concentrations and several loci were identified by the genome-wide association studies (GWAS)[12\u201318]. These genes are mainly involved in the production, binding, transport, metablism and activation of vitamin D and the variants influence serum 25(OH)D levels. A few studies have focused on the relationship between hyperbilirubinemia and polymorphisms in vitamin D-related genes [19]. So far, few studies have examined the relationship\namong vitamin D levels, vitamin D metabolic pathway genes polymorphisms and hyperbilirubinemia and neonatal serum vitamin D. Given the high prevalence of NH and the importance of identifying its risk factors, understanding the relationship among these can play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of NH.\nThus, our study aimed to shed light on the association among serum 25(OH)D concentrations, 6 SNPs of 5 genes involved in vitamin D metabolism (NADSYN1/ DHCR7 rs12785878, GC rs4588 and rs7041, CYP2R1 rs12794714, CYP24A1 rs17216707 and CYP27B1 rs10877012) and the risk of NH."

Neonates meeting the following criteria were enrolled in the study: postnatal age of \u2264 14 days; term or near-term appropriate for gestational age (GA) neonates, as defined by birth weight (BW) \u2265 2000\u00a0g for \u2265 36 weeks GA or BW \u2265 2500\u00a0g for \u2265 35 weeks GA[20, 21]. Exclusion criteria were Rhesus Macacus (Rh) incompatibility, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, sepsis, asphyxia, hypothyroidism, congenital malformations, cholestasis, congenital biliary atresia, or liver disease that would affect the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level.\n336 newborns were recruited into this study, including the NH group (n = 187 cases) and control group (n = 149 cases). The diagnosis of NH is based on the guidelines of The Society of Pediatrics Chinese Medical Association published in 2010[22]. We divided the enrolled patients into the NH group whose TSB \u2265 75th percentile according to the guidelines mentioned above and the control group whose TSB < 75th percentile or without jaundice. The neonates of the NH group were divided into three groups based on the TSB levels: 76 cases in the mild group (\u2265 75th percentile-phototherapy threshold), 93 cases in the moderate group (phototherapy threshold- exchange transfusion threshold), and 18 cases in the severe group (above the exchange transfusion threshold). The information recorded included days of age, gender, GA, BW, exclusive breastfeeding and maternal characteristics.\nConclusions There were associations among NH, vitamin D deficiency and NADSYN1/DHCR7 and CYP27B1 polymorphisms, TT genotype of rs12785878 and GT genotype of rs10877012 could reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency and NH. Furthermore, rs12785878 was significantly associated with severe NH.\nKeywords Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, Vitamin D levels, Single nucleotide polymorphisms, Vitamin D metabolic pathway gene\nMeasurement of serum vitamin D levels The concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS). 25 (OH) D levels were divided into deficiency (\u2264 15 ng/ml), insufficient (> 15 ng/ml and \u2264 20 ng/ml), and sufficient (> 20 ng/ml)[23]. The season of blood collection was divided into summer/fall (June to November) and winter/spring (March to May and December to February), considering the duration of sunlight exposure."

Our study showed that the proportion of vitamin D deficiency was higher in the NH group than in controls, and rs12785878 (NADSYN1/DHCR7) and rs10877012 (CYP27B1) are correlated with NH risk and vitamin D deficiency. In addition, we found that there are no relationships between vitamin D levels and the severity of NH, whereas GT heterozygotes and the dominant model of rs12785878 are two negative factors for severe NH. In this study, the correlation of serum vitamin D concentrations, vitamin D metabolic pathway genes polymorphisms and the risk of hyperbilirubinemia were investigated in Chinese neonates, to the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to analyze the relationship between the three. This will help offer new perspectives on the diagnosis and management of NH and assist in the identification of severe NH.\nIn this study, the median vitamin D level is 10.38 ng/ ml in controls and 9.48 ng/ml in NH. The vitamin D level in cases was lower than that in controls, but the difference is not significant. Furthermore, neonates with NH had a higher rate of vitamin D deficiency compared with the controls, but there was no significant difference after adjusting for potential confounding variables. The relationship between vitamin D and NH is not well studied so far, the mechanism remains to be discovered, and the possible explanations for their relationship are as follows [10, 26]. Firstly, vitamin D can reduce erythropoietin levels in the blood, which can decrease the lysis of red blood cells and bilirubin production; Secondly, vitamin D can slow down oxidative stress, cell and tissue damage [27], which may help prevent the accumulation of bilirubin levels induced by red blood cell oxidative damage; Thirdly, the liver is the important organ for the metabolism of both bilirubin and vitamin D, so, their metabolic processes may have potential interaction. Notably, many studies have indicated that vitamin D plays an important part in neurotrophic regulation and neuroprotection,\nControl group (n = 149) NH group (n = 187) PH\u2212W Crude OR (95% CI) P-Value Adjusted OR (95% CI) P-Value NADSYN1/DHCR7 rs12785878\nGenotype GG 29 (19.46%) 55 (29.41%) 0.806 1 1\nGT 70 (46.98%) 89 (47.59%) 0.67 (0.39, 1.16) 0.153 0.69 (0.39, 1.24) 0.218\nTT 50 (33.56%) 43 (23.00%) 0.45 (0.24, 0.83) 0.011 0.45 (0.23, 0.86) 0.016 Allele G 128 (42.95%) 199 (53.21%) 1 1\nT 170 (57.05%) 175 (46.79%) 0.66 (0.49, 0.90) 0.008 0.66 (0.48, 0.92) 0.013 Dominant model GT + TT 120 (80.54%) 132 (70.59%) 0.58 (0.35, 0.97) 0.038 0.59 (0.34, 1.02) 0.059\nGG 29 (19.46%) 55 (29.41%) 1 1\nRecessive model GG + GT 99 (66.44%) 144 (77.01%) 0.77 (0.60, 0.98) 0.032 0.76 (0.58, 0.98) 0.036 TT 50 (33.56%) 43 (22.99%) 1 1\nGC rs4588\nGenotype CC 67 (44.97%) 91 (48.66%) 0.782 1 1\nCA 68 (45.64%) 71 (37.97%) 0.77 (0.49, 1.22) 0.261 0.79 (0.49, 1.30) 0.359\nAA 14 (9.839%) 25 (13.37%) 1.31(0.64, 2.72) 0.460 1.22 (0.56, 2.65) 0.620\nAllele C 202 (67.79%) 253 (67.65%) 1 1\nA 96 (32.21%) 121 (32.35%) 1.00 (0.85, 1.18) 0.970 0.99 (0.83, 1.18) 0.950\nDominant model CA + AA 82 (55.03%) 96 (51.33%) 0.86 (0.56, 1.33) 0.500 0.87 (0.55, 1.38) 0.554\nCC 67 (44.97%) 91 (48.66%) 1 1\nRecessive model CC + CA 135 (90.60%) 162 (86.63%) 1.22 (0.86, 1.73) 0.261 1.16 (0.80, 1.69) 0.423\nAA 14 (9.40%) 25 (13.37%) 1 1\nGC rs7041\nGenotype TT 76 (51.00%) 90 (48.13%) 0.054 1 1\nTG 57 (38.26%) 63 (33.69%) 0.93 (0.58, 1.49) 0.774 1.09 (0.65, 1.80) 0.750\nGG 16 (10.74%) 34 (18.18%) 1.79 (0.92, 3.50) 0.086 1.55 (0.76, 3.15) 0.224\nAllele T 209 (70.13%) 243 (64.97%) 1 1\nG 89 (29.87%) 131 (35.03%) 1.13 (0.96, 1.32) 0.157 1.11 (0.94, 1.33) 0.228\nDominant model TG + GG 73 (48.99%) 97 (51.87%) 1.12 (0.73, 1.73) 0.600 1.20 (0.76, 1.91) 0.438\nTT 76 (51.01%) 90 (48.13%) 1 1\nRecessive model TT + TG 133 (89.26%) 153 (81.82%) 1.36 (0.99, 1.87) 0.059 1.22 (0.87, 1.72) 0.240\nGG 16 (10.74%) 34 (18.18%) 1 1\nCYP2R1 rs12794714\nGenotype CC 61 (40.94%) 76 (40.64%) 0.343 1 1\nCT 63 (42.28%) 78 (41.71%) 0.99 (0.62, 1.59) 0.979 0.97 (0.58, 1.61) 0.902\nTT 25 (16.78%) 33 (17.65%) 1.06 (0.57, 1.97) 0.855 1.14 (0.59, 2.23) 0.692\nAllele C 185 (62.08%) 230 (61.50%) 1 1\nT 113 (37.92%) 144 (38.50%) 1.01 (0.87, 1.18) 0.877 1.03 (0.87, 1.21) 0.755\nDominant model CT + TT 88 (59.06%) 111 (59.36%) 1.01 (0.65, 1.57) 0.956 1.02 (0.64, 1.63) 0.941\nCC 61 (40.94%) 76 (40.64%) 1 1\nRecessive model CC + CT 124 (83.22%) 154 (82.35%) 1.03 (0.77, 1.37) 0.834 1.08 (0.79, 1.47) 0.634\nTT 25 (16.78%) 33 (17.65%) 1 1\nCYP24A1 rs17216707\nGenotype TT 136 (91.28%) 167 (89.30%) 0.802 1 1\nCT 13 (8.72%) 20 (10.70%) 1.25 (0.60, 2.61) 0.547 1.19 (0.54, 2.62) 0.665\nAllele T 285 (95.64%) 354 (94.65%) 1 1\nC 13 (4.36%) 20 (5.35%) 1.24 (0.61, 2.53) 0.55 1.18 (0.55, 2.54) 0.674\nCYP27B1 rs10877012\nGenotype GG 25 (16.78%) 50 (26.74%) 0.880 1 1\nGT 73 (49.00%) 87 (46.52%) 0.60 (0.34, 1.06) 0.076 0.53 (0.29, 0.98) 0.042 TT 51 (34.22%) 50 (26.74%) 0.49 (0.26, 0.91) 0.024 0.60 (0.31, 1.16) 0.131\nAllele G 123 (41.28%) 187 (50.00%) 1 1\nT 175 (58.72%) 187(50.00%) 0.84 (0.72, 0.98) 0.024 0.89 (0.75, 1.05) 0.162 Dominant model GT + TT 124 (83.22%) 137 (73.26%) 0.55 (0.32, 0.95) 0.031 0.56 (0.31, 0.99) 0.045\nGG 25 (16.78%) 50 (26.74%) 1 1\nTable 3 Correlation between NH and vitamin D metabolic pathway genes polymorphisms\nneurotransmission and neuroplasticity[28]. Therefore, we speculate that vitamin D deficiency is associated with bilirubin encephalopathy caused by severe NH. However, vitamin D levels are not associated with the severity of NH in our study. Similar to our study, another study suggested that a significant negative relationship was also observed between vitamin D levels and bilirubin levels in the newborns (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in vitamin D levels among mild, moderate and severe NH[26]. However, a study from Iran revealed a lack of a correlation between vitamin D levels and NH[8]. A recent meta-analysis showed that vitamin D level of the NH group was significantly lower than that in the healthy control group, and its subgroup analysis based on the bilirubin level of the study indicated that vitamin D levels might cause differences in the degree of NH[10]. Therefore, we speculated that low vitamin D level is a risk factor for NH and may also be linked to severe NH. However, vitamin D levels are influenced by a variety of factors. Although we adjusted for some potential confounding variables, future studies should refine groups and increase the sample size to explore the relationship between vitamin D levels and NH.\nVitamin D exists in different forms in the body with several enzymes being involved in their metabolism. 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase encoded by the DHCR7 converts 7-hydroxycholesterol (the precursor of vitamin D) to cholesterol. Vitamin D requires two hydroxylation steps to become an active hormone, 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1\u03b1-hydroxylation in the kidney which is catalyzed by the enzyme encoded by the CYP2R1 and CYP27B1, respectively. The vitamin D and its metabolites bind to vitamin D-binding protein encoded by GC gene and are transported to target tissues and organs, its action is exerted by binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor, and the degradation of these vitamin D metabolites is initiated by 24-hydroxylase encoded CYP24A1 [29]. A study revealed that the two SNPs in GC (rs222020, rs2298849), four SNPs in CYP2R1 (rs10741657, rs10766197, rs12794714 and rs1562902) and two SNPs in NADSYN1/DHCR7 (rs3829251, rs12785878) were associated with plasma 25(OH)D concentrations in northeastern Han Chinese children[30]. Likewise, previous studies also demonstrated that GC gene (rs7041 and rs4588) and their haplotype were key factors of vitamin D levels in infants and toddlers [31, 32]. Findings from the present study suggested that NADSYN1/DHCR7 rs12785878 TT genotypes and CYP27B1 rs10877012 GT\ngenotypes were associated with decreased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, we established haplotypes for GC gene from different combinations of selected two SNPs, and the AT haplotype was associated with vitamin D deficiency. The possible explanation is that the amino acid substitutions at these sites influence the O-glycosylation of the vitamin D binding protein, affect the vitamin D binding protein half-life and then decrease vitamin D levels[32].\nThe vitamin D metabolic pathway genes are shown to associate with NH susceptibility by different analyses in this study, including the use of a single SNP model, SNPSNP interactions and haplotype analysis. In our study, the TT genotype, T allele and recessive model of the rs12785878 SNP were associated with decreased risk of NH, whereas the GT genotype and dominant model of the rs12785878 SNP were two significant risk factors for developing severe NH. And GT genotype and dominant model of rs10877012 were protective factors for NH. The rs10877012 is located in the promotor region of the CYP27B1 gene, which might impact transcription and translation processes[33]. The rs12785878 is located in 8 kilobases upstream from the transcription initiation site of DHCR7 and in an intron of NADSYN1[34]. To date, there are no functional studies of the rs12785878, so it remains unclear by which mechanism this SNP influences vitamin D levels and NH risk. The etiology of NH is complex, and to identify the complex biological relationships leading to NH, we attempted to understand the epistatic phenomenon involved in NH etiology through SNP-SNP and SNP- vitamin D levels interaction analysis. Both multivariate logistic regression as well as epistasis analysis yielded no significant results(P > 0.05). However, rs12785878-rs10877012-rs12794714 SNP combination may be potentially associated with the risk of NH (the testing balanced accuracy was 52.10% and crossvalidation consistency was 6/10, P = 0.0547). There were no differences in the frequencies of CT, CG, AT and AG haplotypes for GC gene between the case and control groups. This study is the first to analyze the relationship between vitamin D metabolic pathway genes polymorphisms and the risk of hyperbilirubinemia in Chinese neonates, which could provide new clues for further studies on the genetic variant of NH.\nOur study also had some limitations.
