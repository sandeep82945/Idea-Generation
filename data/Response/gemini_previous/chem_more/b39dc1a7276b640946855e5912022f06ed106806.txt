1. **Developing a more comprehensive chemical entity extraction and visualization system.** The current ChemVis system only extracts and visualizes a limited number of chemical entity properties. Future research could expand the system to extract and visualize a wider range of properties, such as chemical reactions, chemical pathways, and chemical structures.
2. **Integrating ChemVis with other research tools.** ChemVis could be integrated with other research tools, such as literature search engines and citation managers. This would allow researchers to easily access chemical entity information while they are conducting research.
3. **Evaluating the effectiveness of ChemVis.** The effectiveness of ChemVis has not yet been evaluated. Future research could conduct a user study to evaluate the system's usability and effectiveness in supporting researchers' tasks.
4. **Exploring the use of machine learning to improve ChemVis.** Machine learning could be used to improve the accuracy of chemical entity extraction and visualization. Future research could explore the use of machine learning to train models that can identify and extract chemical entities from text and images.
5. **Developing a mobile app for ChemVis.** A mobile app for ChemVis would allow researchers to access chemical entity information on the go. Future research could develop a mobile app that provides the same functionality as the web-based version of ChemVis.
