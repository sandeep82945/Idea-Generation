    "abstractText": "To solve the problem of low completeness in identifying flight training subjects in flight training data, a Multivariate Subsequence Search with Double Windows (MSDW) algorithm is proposed based on the Euclidean distance. First, a method for retrieving locally optimal subsequences is proposed based on constructing a distance matrix of candidate subsequences; then, the method is applied to the MSDW algorithm for retrieving all eligible locally optimal subsequences; finally, a double windows method is employed to improve the completeness of matched subsequences. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the MSDW algorithm is well designed and can correctly and effectively retrieve the local optimal subsequence, which can achieve recognition accuracy of 1 in the engineering application of single flight training subject recognition. It is experimentally verified that compared with the traditional SPRING algorithm, the completeness of the MSDW algorithm in recognizing individual flight training subjects is greatly improved, and the effectiveness of flight training subject recognition is effectively enhanced.

INTRODUCTION Flight training subject identification, which is the basis of flight training quality assessment, is important for analyzing pilot skill proficiency and improving flight training quality, so it is necessary to study flight training subject identification algorithms.\nTo improve the completeness of identifying flight training subjects. It is proposed the Multivariate Subsequence Search with Double Windows (MSDW) algorithm, based on the research results of Sakurai et al. [1] who proposed the univariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval algorithm. The main idea is to use Euclidean distance as a similarity measure to construct a candidate subsequence distance\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Chih-Yu Hsu .\nmatrix. Then propose a method to retrieve locally optimal subsequences for retrieving locally optimal subsequences that meet the requirements. And finally, a double windows approach is taken to extend the local optimal subsequence time dimension. And then achieve the purpose of improving the completeness of flight training subject identification. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the MSDW algorithm can successfully identify individual flight training subjects, and the accuracy rate of the four flight training subjects identification can reach 1 within a certain threshold range. And the completeness of the MSDW algorithm in identifying flight training subjects is higher compared with the traditional SPRING algorithm, which meets the requirements of engineering applications.\nThe main contributions of this paper are 1. To develop a technique to overcome the difficulty of low completeness\nVOLUME 11, 2023 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

To present an application of the MSDW algorithm for identifying flight training subjects is verified using comparison experiments with the SPRING algorithm.\nThe rest of the work is structured as follows: Section II introduces the research work related to flight training subject identification; Section III describes the relevant background knowledge and gives a precise definition of the problem to be solved in this paper; Section IV explains the proposed MSDW algorithm and also gives a concrete example for easy understanding; Section V applies the algorithm to an engineering application for identifying flight training subjects, followed by a discussion of the experimental results; Section VI is a summary.\nII. RELATED WORK Compared with flight maneuver recognition research [2], [3], flight training subject recognition has a longer time dimension, larger data volume and higher difficulty. So flight training subject recognition research is less. However, in recent years, flight training subject recognition research has still made some achievements. Li [4] proposed a flight training subject recognition algorithm based on an exhaustive state automaton based on the division of flight maneuvers and the construction of a flight maneuver rule base, which requires more parameters and the threshold setting relies on expert experience, and there is a certain subjectivity. Lu et al. [5] firstly segmented flight subjects by unsupervised clustering method, and then used a phase space reconstruction (PSR) model for subject recognition, which achieved flight training subject recognition and segmentation, but the solution steps were cumbersome and the complexity of the algorithm was high. Tian et al. [6] used deep neural networks to adaptively extract flight training multivariate time series features, based on deep residual convolution, constructed a deep variational autoencoder network to achieve flight training subject recognition, and achieved a better recognition effect, the algorithm is also complex in principle and difficult to solve.\nCompared with the above methods to identify flight training subjects, the principle of using multivariate time series subsequence retrieval is simpler and easier to understand and implement. Traditional multivariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval is widely used in text recognition [7], [8], [9], speech recognition [10], [11], [12] and especially in bioinformatics [13], [14], [15], where Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance are the two most commonly used similarity measures [16], [17]. However traditional multivariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval usually focuses only on the precision of matching to subsequences and ignores the completeness of matching subsequences. When applied to flight training subject identification, it will lead to the incompleteness\nof the identified individual flight training subject time series data, which means that the complete flight training subjects as shown in Fig. 1 cannot be truly and objectively restored, which in turn leads to serious bias in flight training quality assessment. Therefore, the traditional multivariate time series subsequence retrieval algorithm is not suitable for flight training subject identification, and a multivariate time series subsequence retrieval algorithm that focuses more on the completeness of the identified subsequences needs to be studied and applied to flight training subject identification.\nThe differences between the MSDW algorithm and the traditional multivariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval algorithm SPRING are: firstly, the similarity measure is different, the former is the Euclidean distance and the latter is the DTW distance; secondly, the focus of the two is different, the former is more concerned with the completeness of the identified subsequence, while the latter is more concerned with the precision of the identification. It should be observed that both algorithms can achieve an accuracy rate of 1 when the threshold value of the two algorithms is within the appropriate range.\nFig. 1 shows the incomplete identification results of rectangular takeoff and landing route for flight training subjects, where (a) figure shows the complete rectangular takeoff and landing route training trajectory; (b) figure shows the reduced training trajectory based on the result of the traditional time series subsequence similarity retrieval algorithm SPRING [1] for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route, noting that the reduced training trajectory is incomplete due to the incomplete result of identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route.\n3222 VOLUME 11, 2023\nIII. PRELIMINARIES A. FLIGHT TRAINING MULTIVARIATE TIME SERIES DATA During the flight subject training, the flight data recorded by Flight Data Recorder (FDR), such as flight altitude, speed, roll angle and pitch angle [18], constitute the flight training multivariate time series data (FTMTS) that can be used for flight training subject identification as time passes. The flight training subject identification problem can thus be transformed into a multivariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval problem, i.e., retrieving a single flight training subject from the flight training multivariate time series.\nB. PROBLEM DEFINITION In multivariate time series subsequence retrieval, let Q = (q1, q2, . . . , qt , . . . , qn), t = 1, 2, . . . , n, the time dimension is n, where qt = (qt1, qt2, . . . , qtk ), k is the number of variables, qt indicates the value of k variables recorded at time t . Query sequence C = (c1, c2, . . . , ci, . . . , cm), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, the time dimension is m, where ci = (ci1, ci2, . . . , cik ), and the number of variables is also k , with the samemeaning as above. letQ[ts, te] be the subsequence of Q, starting with ts moment and ends at te moment. A distance threshold of \u03b5 is given to the algorithm. The problem to be solved in this paper is to a. retrieve all subsequences in Q that satisfy ED(C,Q[ts, te]) < \u03b5, i.e., the Euclidean distance between the query sequence C and the subsequence Q[ts, te] of Q is less than a threshold, and b. take only the locally optimal subsequence in a set of intersecting overlapping subsequences. This means that Q[ts, te] provided that condition a is satisfied, is still a set of intersecting overlapping subsequences with the largest similarity and the smallest Euclidean distance to the query sequence C .\nSpecifically, it is divided into two problems. Problem 1: Whenever a subsequence similar to the query sequence C is retrieved in Q, many subsequences similar to the query sequence C are also retrieved to intersect and overlap with it, and among these intersecting and overlapping subsequences, the subsequence with the highest similarity to C is defined as the locally optimal subsequence. Obtaining the locally optimal subsequence can reduce the redundant information provided to the user and also improve the retrieval speed [1], problem 1 is the secondary problem to be solved. Problem 2 is the main problem to be solved, based on solving problem 1, retrieving all the locally optimal subsequences in Q that satisfy the conditions of disjoint and nonoverlapping, such as the red path in Fig. 2 is the matching path of the retrieved locally optimal subsequences that are disjoint and nonoverlapping and have Euclidean distance less than a threshold \u03b5 from the query sequence C .\nIV. MSDW ALGORITHMS To solve the problems mentioned in Section III, the MSDW algorithm is proposed in this paper.\nA. EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE In the multivariate time series Q = (q1, q2, . . . , qt , . . . qn), t = 1, 2, . . . , n, the time dimension is n, where qt = (qt1, qt2, . . . , qtk ), and the number of variables is k , which indicates the value of k variables recorded at the moment t . The query sequence is C = (c1, c2, . . . , ci, . . . , cm), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m. Its time dimension is m(m < n), where ci = (ci1, ci2, . . . , cik ) and the number of variables is also k . Q[ts, te] is the subsequence of Q, which starts at the moment of ts and ends at the moment of te. The subsequence time dimension is the same as the query sequence, which is also m.\nFor illustration, take the subsequence Q [t1, tm] = (q1, q2, . . . , qt , . . . , qm) as an example, which starts at t = 1 and ends at t = m moment, which corresponds to each time point of the query sequence C = (c1, c2, . . . , ci, . . . , cm), as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, this subsequence can also be expressed as Q [t1, tm] = (q1, q2, . . . , qi, . . . , qm), i.e., the k variable values recorded by Q [t1, tm] at the moment i (t) can be expressed either by qt or by qi.\nThe Euclidean distance between two points ci and qt , both with k variable values recorded at moment i, is the sum of the squares of the differences of the k corresponding variable values, as shown in (1).\nED(ci, qi) = \u2211k\nh=1 (cih \u2212 qih)2 (1)\nThe sum of the Euclidean distance between two points accumulated point by point for query sequence C and the subsequences of Q is the Euclidean distance between query sequence C and the subsequences of Q which is used as the\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3223\nsimilarity measure between them. The principle is shown in Fig. 4, where the dashed line indicates the multivariate time series Q, and the solid part of it is its subsequence.\nFor further illustration, the Euclidean distance of the query sequence C and the subsequence Q[t1, tm] (both with time dimension m) is calculated as an example.\nED(C,Q[t1, tm]) = \u2211m\ni=1 (ED(ci, qi)) = f (m,m)\nf (i, i) = ED(ci, qi)+ f (i\u2212 1, i\u2212 1)\nf (0, 0) = 0, f (0, i) = 0, f (i, 0) = \u221e\n(i = 1, . . . ,m) (2)\nWhile recording the subsequence Euclidean distance cumulative distance f (i, i), the start position S(i, i) of subsequence is recorded.\nS(i, i) = S(i\u2212 1, i\u2212 1)\nS(0, 0) = 1, S(0, i) = i+ 1, S(i, 0) = 1 (3)\nIn multivariate time series subsequence retrieval, removing the square root when calculating the Euclidean distance not only does not affect the relative ranking of subsequence similarity, but on the contrary, it is also beneficial to optimize the computational speed of the algorithm, as demonstrated by [19], which is not repeated in this paper.\nB. CANDIDATE SUBSEQUENCE DISTANCE MATRIX The query sequence C = (c1, c2, . . . , ci, . . . , cm), and for the convenience of the candidate subsequence distancematrix representation. Let C \u2032 = (c0, c1, c2, . . . , ci, . . . , cm), where c0 = (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e) is involved in the calculation when the Euclidean distance obtained is constant 0, indicating that no attention is needed only as an interval. Instead of C , C \u2032 is used to calculate the Euclidean distance of the subsequence of C and Q.\nThe time dimension of C ism and the time dimension ofQ is n. The distance matrix of the candidate subsequence of size m\u00d7 n is constructed. And the cumulative Euclidean distance value d(i, t) and subsequence starting position s(i, t) recorded in the (i, t) matrix element are calculated by the following equation.\nd(i, t) = ED(ci, qt )+ d(i\u2212 1, t \u2212 1)\nd(0, 0) = 0, d(0, t) = 0, d(i, 0) = \u221e\ns(i, t) = s(i\u2212 1, t \u2212 1)\ns(0, 0) = 1, s(0, t) = t + 1, s(i, 0) = 1\n(i = 1, 2, . . . , n; t = 1, 2, . . . ,m) (4)\nThe candidate subsequence distance matrix should record the candidate subsequence accumulated Euclidean distance d(i, t) in addition to the starting position s(i, t) of the subsequence, i.e., s(i, t) records the starting point of the cumulative distance d(i, t). Specifically, the (i, t) cell, records the starting position s(i, t) of the subsequence in the time elapsed (t \u2212 s(i, t)) to get the cumulative distance of d(i, t). With the candidate subsequence distance matrix, the starting position ts = s(m, te) of the locally optimal subsequence Q[ts, te] and the similarity ED (C,Q [ts, te]) = d (m, te) between it and the query sequence C can be found. Fig. 6 gives an example of the candidate subsequence distance matrix, where the upper values in the matrix denote the cumulative Euclidean distances and the numbers in the lower brackets denote the starting positions of the subsequences and also the positions where the Euclidean distances start to accumulate.\nC. ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATIONS Let the di and d \u2032i array store m distance values, and thesi and s\u2032i array store m integers. At the moment t , di = d (i, t) , d \u2032 i = d (i, t \u2212 1), as shown in Fig. 5;si = s (i, t) , s\u2032i = s (i, t \u2212 1). Thus the cumulative Euclidean distance of each subsequence can be calculated by the incremental equation of (5).\ndi = ED(ci, qi)+ di\u22121 d0 = d \u20320 = 0\n(5)\nThe starting position of each subsequence can be recorded according to (6).\nsi = s\u2032i\u22121 (6)\nThe pseudocode of the algorithm is shown in Algorithm1, where the multivariate data qt recorded in Q at moment t is input each time. Then the cumulative distance di and the\n3224 VOLUME 11, 2023\nAlgorithm 1MSDW: 1 input: a new value qt at t; 2 output: qualifying subsequence if any 3 for i = 1 to m do 4 compute di and si by Formulas(5)(6); 5 end for 6 if dmin \u2264 \u03b5 then 7 if \u2200i, di \u2265 dmin \u2228 si > te then 8 // Without double windows 9 Report(dmin, ts, te); 10 // With double windows 11 // Report(dmin, ts \u2212Wstart , te +Wend ); 12 // Reset dmin and the array of di 13 dmin = \u221e; 14 for j = 1 to m do 14 if sj \u2264 te then 15 dj = \u221e; 16 end if 17 end for 18 end if 19 end if 20 if dm \u2264 \u03b5 \u2227 dm < dmin then 21 dmin = dm; ts = sm; te = t; 22 end if 23 substitute d \u2032i for di; 24 substitute s\u2032i for si;\nstarting position si are calculated according to (5) and (6). dmin is used to track the local minimum distance, while di and si are used to determine whether the local optimal local subsequence is generated. When the condition \u2200i, di \u2265 dmin \u2228 si > te is satisfied, it means that the local optimal subsequence is generated. And the current moment does not intersect or overlap with the currently retrieved local optimal subsequence but belongs to the starting position of the next set of intersecting and overlapping subsequences, the proof of which is shown in Property 1 of Section IV, part E. After outputting the local optimal subsequence, the local minimum dmin and the array di are initialized, and then the next set of local optimal subsequences is retrieved.\nThe principle of the MSDW algorithm is illustrated by the following example.\nQ = ( 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 ) C = ( 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n) Q is a bivariate time series containing two variables with a time dimension of 7 and a query sequence C with a time dimension of 4. They are considered similar when the Euclidean distance between the query sequence and the subsequence is less than a threshold \u03b5 = 0.2. At t = 5, a candidate subsequence Q [2, 5] is retrieved because d (4, 5) = 0.1 < \u03b5; at t = 6, a locally optimal subsequence Q [3, 6] is retrieved for the same reason. At t = 7, a locally optimal subsequence is returned because \u2200i, d (i, 7) > dmin = 0.0, implying that the Euclidean distance between the candidate subsequence and the query sequence is greater for the upcoming candidate subsequences, so Q [3, 6] cannot be replaced by the upcoming candidate subsequence as the locally optimal subsequence. Finally, t = 7 is the starting position of the next new set of intersecting overlapping subsequences, so d (1, 7) is not initialized.\nD. ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION Based on the Euclidean distance for subsequence similarity retrieval, the retrieved subsequences all have the same time dimension as that of the query sequence because the Euclidean distance is calculated point-to-point. In order to improve the flexibility of MSDW and the completeness of retrieved subsequences, the algorithm optimization using double windows, i.e., subsequence start position window and end position window, is proposed to optimize the algorithm with the same accuracy of subsequence similarity retrieval.\nSet the start position window as Wstart and the end position window as Wend . Before returning the local optimal subsequence that meets the conditions, addWstart raw data to the start position of the subsequence and extend Wend raw data to the end position, and then return the local optimal subsequence after the optimization of the double windows. Add Wstart and Wend to the first line of Algorithm1 as input data, and replace the code in line 8 with the code in line 10,\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3225\nReport(dmin, ts\u2212Wstart , te+Wend ). This operation is to expand the time dimension of the subsequence after retrieving the local optimal subsequence, so it does not affect the accuracy of subsequence similarity retrieval.\nE. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS Property 1: (correctness) The MSDW algorithm retrieves the correct locally optimal subsequence.\nProof: From Section IV, part C, it is known that di = d (i, t) and si = s (i, t) at moment t , dmin is the Euclidean distance between the locally optimal subsequence Q [ts, te] and the query sequence C . At the moment t (t > te), if \u2200i, di > dmin, the Euclidean distance between the subsequence intersecting Q [ts, te] and the query sequence will be greater than dmin; if \u2200i, si > te( in line 14 of the pseudocode, the array is traversed by j instead of i, so it can also be represented by \u2200j, sj > te), it means that the subsequence with si( sj) as the starting position does not overlap with the locally optimal subsequence Q [ts, te] with te as the ending position. Therefore the condition \u2200i, di \u2265 dmin \u2228 si > te for retrieving the locally optimal subsequence is correct and reasonable.\nProperty 2 (algorithmic complexity) The MSDW algorithm requires a space complexity of O (m) and time complexity of O (m) to process the data at each point in time during the operation.\nProof: The MSDW algorithm uses an array di to record the cumulative distance of the Euclidean distance, and only m cumulative distances need to be updated for the data at the input t moments, so the space complexity is O (m), for the record of the starting position of the subsequence, the algorithm also uses an array si for storage, and similarly, the time complexity of the algorithm is O (m).\nV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION The SPRING algorithm [1] uses the DTW distance as a similarity measure for both univariate and multivariate time series subsequence similarity retrieval and is a traditional and widely used subsequence retrieval algorithm [20], [21].\nThis experiment will compare the accuracy, precision, and completeness of the MSDW algorithm with the SPRING algorithm in identifying individual flight training subjects. Both algorithms need to select a threshold \u03b5, and then sort the matched subsequences according to their similarity, and finally retrieve the eligible subsequences.\nA. DATA PREPROCESSING AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA Usually, due to the influence of objective factors such as weather, the flight data recorded by the flight data recorder will contain noise, and the recorded parameters have different magnitudes, so it is necessary to perform noise reduction and standardized data pre-processing for flight training multiple time series, and Kalman filter is used as the noise reduction method in this experiment. The experiments of Gite [22] and Li [23] show that the flight data are smoother and more\nrealistic after Kalman filtering, so Kalman filtering is adopted as the noise reduction method in this experiment.\nFlightTrainingData is an unpublished flight data set that truly records the data of a certain type of aircraft in three complete takeoffs and landings for subject training, containing a total of four training subjects, namely, rectangular takeoff and landing route, cape traverse route, DME arc flight and small hover, more specific information is shown in Table 1. The above 4 flight training subjects can basically be fully portrayed by the flight altitude (AltMSL), trajectory (TRK), elevation rate (VSpd), pitch angle (Pitch) and roll angle (Roll), 5 variables.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS Experimental steps: FlightTrainingData are assigned to Q after noise reduction and normalization; multivariate time series templates of individual flight training subjects are assigned to C as query sequences after the same data preprocessing. The MSDW algorithm and SPRING algorithm are used to identify the individual flight training subjects.\nExperiment 1: (Comparison of flight training subject recognition accuracy) Comparison of individual flight training subject recognition accuracy between MSDW algorithm with double windows equal to 0 and SPRING algorithm at different thresholds.\nWhen the accuracy of an individual flight training subject recognition can reach 1, i.e., when all trajectories of an individual flight training subject can be recognized in a single flight training session, it makes sense to consider how to improve the precision and completeness of the individual flight training subject recognition, and therefore accuracy is an important measure of the performance of the flight training subject recognition [24]. Accuracy (acc) [24] is the ratio of the number of subsequences (Ture total, TT) that correctly identify a single flight training subject and the number of similar subsequences (Total number, TN) that are retrieved, as shown in (7).\nacc = TT / TN (7)\nTheMSDW algorithm utilizes a double windows approach to extend the subsequence time dimension after the flight training subjects are identified to improve the completeness of identifying individual flight training subjects without\n3226 VOLUME 11, 2023\naffecting the accuracy of identification, so the double windows of 0 are desirable for comparison.\nIn addition, because the implementation of the MSDW and Spring algorithms are based on different similarity measures, the former using Euclidean distance as a measure and the latter using DTW distance as a measure, the thresholds differ significantly in value, with the former requiring precision to the thousandth or even the ten-thousandth of a degree, while the latter only requires precision to the single digit. Therefore, in experiments to identify individual flight training subjects at different thresholds, the MSDW algorithm\u2019s threshold can be set in steps of 0.001 starting at 0, while the Spring algorithm can start at 0 and take the threshold in steps of 1 until it stops when the accuracy of identifying individual flight training subjects drops to 0.6.\nThe results of the MSDW algorithm and the Spring algorithm for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route of training subjects with different thresholds \u03b5 are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. From the experimental results, in the appropriate threshold range, both MSDW algorithm and SPRING algorithm can accurately identify the distribution of rectangular takeoff and landing route throughout the training process, and the recognition accuracy can reach 1. Specifically, the MSDW algorithm was able to identify the full trajectory of the rectangular takeoff and landing route training in a single flight training session at threshold values ranging from 0.060 to 0.096, while the SPRING algorithm was able to achieve these goals at threshold values ranging from 239 to 399.\nFigures 7 and 8 show the results of the SPRING algorithm and the MSDW algorithm, respectively, for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route for a single flight training subject when the dual window is 0. The left panel shows the univariate time series of each variable in the multivariate time series template of the rectangular takeoff and landing route, and the dashed line in the right panel is the\nflight training multivariate time series, where the solid line indicates the rectangular takeoff and landing route identified by the algorithm. As shown in the figure, both the SPRING algorithm and the MSDW algorithm can correctly identify the four rectangular takeoff and landing routes and their locations.\nIn the same way, as the rectangular takeoff and landing route are identified, the small hover, cape traverse route and DME arc flights are identified in sequence. The threshold ranges for the correct identification of small hover, cape traverse route and DME arc flight for these three flight training subjects are listed in Table 4, and m in the table is the time dimension of the individual flight training subject template.\nAs can be seen from Table 4, both algorithms can correctly identify a single flight training subject when the double windows of the MSDW algorithm are equal to 0. This\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3227\nindicates that the MSDW algorithm has a high accuracy rate in identifying a single flight training subject. It also shows that the algorithms can correctly retrieve the locally optimal subsequence that satisfies the conditions, and the rationality of the algorithm design is verified through experiments.\nThe smallest value in the range of thresholds for identifying individual flight training subjects was taken as the threshold \u03b5 (in the case of the MSDW algorithm, thresholds of 0.060, 0.066, 0.061 and 0.033 were taken for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route, small hover, cape traverse route and DME arc flight, respectively). And experiments two were conducted based on this.\nExperiment 2: (Comparison of flight training subject recognition precision and completeness) Comparison of MSDW algorithm and SPRING algorithm in terms of precision and completeness of single flight training subject recognition.\nTo further compare the differences between the two in terms of single flight training subject recognition, three cases of the MSDW algorithm with double windows of 0, 10 and 20 were selected for comparison with the SPRING algorithm. The precision and completeness of individual flight training subject identification can be measured by Precision (P) and\nRecall (R). A higher precision means that a higher proportion of the data points identified for a individual flight training subject actually belong to that subject, i.e., the expectation is that as few data points as possible will be included that do not belong to that individual flight training subject [25]. A higher recall means that the number of data points identified that belong to an individual flight training subject is higher, i.e., the expectation is that as many data points belonging to that flight training subject as possible will be included [25].\nThe precision [26] and recall [26] are calculated by (8) and (9), respectively. detection positives are data points identified by the algorithm as belonging to a single flight training subject, which contains two data types a. true positives are data points that truly belong to a flight training subject, and b. false positives are data points that are misreported as flight training subjects.\nP = \u2211 true positives\u2211\ndetection positives (8)\nR = \u2211 true positives\u2211\ntrue positives+ \u2211 false positives\n(9)\nAs shown in Table 5, when the double windows of the MSDW algorithm are 0, 10 and 20, the precision of rectangular takeoff and landing route, small hover and cape traverse route identification is slightly lower than that of the SPRING algorithm. The precision of DME arc flight identification is slightly lower than that of the SPRING algorithm. The explanation for this result is that the SPRING algorithm uses DTW distance as the similarity measure, so it is more flexible when retrieving subsequence matching paths. Compared with the Euclidean distance as the similarity measure, DTW focuses more on the precision of the retrieved subsequence.\nIn the field of flight training subject recognition, the completeness of the recognition result is preferred over the precision, i.e., the recall should be as high as possible,\n3228 VOLUME 11, 2023\nbecause the purpose of flight training subject recognition is to objectively monitor, analyze and evaluate the quality\nof subject training, as shown in Figure 1, if the recognized subjects are incomplete, it will have a greater impact on the evaluation of flight subject training.\nAs can be seen from Table 6, compared with the SPRING algorithm, the MSDW algorithm has a slightly higher recall for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route when the double windows are taken as 0, 10 and 20, respectively, but the recall for identifying subjects such as small circle, cape traverse route and DME arc flight is significantly higher and the recall for identifying increases as the value of the double windows increases. The performance is rectangular takeoff and landing route, cape traverse route and DME arc flight, the recognition completeness of these three flight training subjects is above 0.9, which can be applied to the requirements of practical engineering (In the actual training of a single flying discipline in civil aviation, the percentage of preparatory and finishing maneuvers is 0.2 and is not used as part of the evaluation, such as taxiing, where the real training element is 0.8 [27]). The experiments demonstrate a significant superiority of the MVDW algorithm in terms of completeness of flight training subject recognition.\nThe MSDW algorithm has a significant advantage over the SPRING algorithm in terms of completeness of flight training subject identification because the MSDW algorithm uses Euclidean distance as a similarity measure and uses double windows to increase the time dimension of the local optimal subsequence, thus improving the completeness of the algorithm.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, Fig. a, Fig. b, Fig. c and Fig. d show the comparison of precision and recall for identifying rectangular takeoff and landing route, small hover, cape traverse route and DME arc flight when the values of the double windows of\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3229\nthe MSDW algorithm are taken as 0, 10 and 20, respectively. It should be noted that the MSDW algorithm gradually increases with the number of double windows, and the precision of the algorithm recognition gradually decreases while the recall rate gradually increases. The reason is that the algorithm extends the time dimension of the local optimal subsequence satisfying the condition through the double windows, which is beneficial to improve the completeness of the flight training subject recognition. However, data points that do not belong to the flight training subjects will be introduced with the increase in the time dimension, which will reduce the precision of recognition.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, the MSDW algorithm is proposed to address the problem of low completeness of traditional multivariate time series subsequence retrieval algorithm in identifying flight training subjects, and the algorithm is studied in two aspects. First, the rationality of the design of the MSDW algorithm is studied; second, the performance of the MSDW algorithm in identifying flight training subjects is investigated. In terms of the rationality of the algorithm design, it was proved by theoretical and recognition accuracy experiments. In terms of the performance of recognizing flight training subjects, the accuracy, precision, and completeness of subject recognition are investigated. In the study, by comparing with the traditional multivariate time series subseries similarity retrieval algorithm SPRING, the experimental results show that the MSDW algorithm can correctly identify the flight training subjects in the flight training data, and the recognition accuracy are able to reach 1. The completeness of identifying the flight training subjects is significantly improved, especially for the three training subjects of small hover, cape traverse route and DME arc flight.\nCurrently, there are two main ways to evaluate flight training subjects. One is for the instructor to follow the trainee\u2019s flight and for the instructor to make the rating. The other is based on the flight training data of the students, using software to restore the flight trajectory, and then manually identifying and cutting out the trajectory of individual flight training subjects, and ultimately handing them over to the evaluation experts for judging. The process of manually identifying the trajectory of cutting individual flight training subjects is time-consuming, inefficient, error-prone, etc. The application of the MSDW algorithm can simplify the steps of manual identification, shorten the working time and improve efficiency. It can also be applied and extended to the study of automatic evaluation of flight training subjects as a means of pre-processing flight training data for the completion of data pre-processing for the identification and cutting of flight training subjects.\nAt this stage of the MSDW algorithm\u2019s application, the setting of the double windows and thresholds needs to rely on manual experience, so how to quickly select the appropriate double windows values and how to determine a\nreasonable range of thresholds will be the content of future research.\nREFERENCES [1] Y.
