    "abstractText": "To explore the correlation between UGT1A1 variant and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Chinese Uighur and Han populations. We conducted this study in Urumqi, China. Umbilical cord blood specimens and clinical information of term infants born in the studied center were collected. Variation status of UGT1A1 was determined by direct sequencing or capillary electrophoresis analysis. 102 Uighur and 99 Han normal term neonates, together with 19 hospitalized term newborns (10 Uighur and 9 Han) due to significant hyperbilirubinemia were enrolled into the final analysis. The incidence of neonates with high-risk transcutaneous bilirubin level (TCB) were much higher in Han newborns than in Uighur newborns(P = 0.01). Also, there was statistically significant difference in (TA) 7 promoter mutation of UGT1A1 between Han and Uighur group(\u03c72 = 4.675, P = 0.03). Furthermore, exon mutation (c.211 and /or c.1091) in UGT1A1 gene was significantly associated with increased TCB level (ORadj = 1.41, 95%CI: 0.25\u20132.51, P = 0.002) and higher risk of hyperbilirubinemia in both Han and Uighur infants after adjusted for covariates (ORadj = 2.21, 95%CI: 1.09\u20134.49, P = 0.03). In conclusion, UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism seem to be an important genetic modulator of plasma bilirubin level and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk within ethnic groups. Genetic assessment of UGT1A1 coding variants may be useful for clinical diagnosis of neonatal jaundice.",

The\nwere generally benign, a select number of infants will develop hazardous levels of total serum bilirubin (TSB) that may cause irreversible neurological damage [2\u20134].\nThe incidence and severity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Asians and American Indians\nare much higher, as compared to those in Caucasian and black populations [5, 6]. Both environmental and genetic factors may contribute to this situation. The importance of genetic role in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia has been increasingly recognized [7].\nInnate ethnic variation in UGT1A1, which encoded for the key enzyme involved in the con-\njugation of bilirubin has been reported to contribute to the biologic basis of hyperbilirubinemia risk in Asian. Several polymorphisms in the promoter and coding region of the UGT1A1 gene complex has been described, which was associated with reduction in UGT1A1 enzyme activity and Gilbert syndrome phenotype-an autosomal recessive unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (UCH) disorder [8\u201310]. Of these UGT1A1 variants, the coding sequence variantsUGT1A1\ufffd6 polymorphism was predominant in East Asian subjects [11, 12]. And UGT1A1 promoter sequence polymorphisms, the most common in the Caucasian population and frequently associated with GS phenotype, were also observed in East Asian subjects, though at lower allele frequencies [13].\nChina was famous for its large population and was composed of 56 ethnic groups. Recent\nmulti-center epidemiology survey from China revealed that neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was still common in China (34.4% of term neonates in China). Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia remained not rare, especially in some areas of southern China [14]. Our previous studies had confirmed the strong association between the common coding variant G211A (UGT1A1\ufffd6) and severe hyperbilirubinemia in Han population of southern China [15\u201317].\nIn this study, we aim to further describe the spectrum and prevalence of UGT1A1 variant in newborns of Uighur minority living in northern China. Uighur was one main minority in northern China, with populations of more than 5 million. Growing genetic studies has demonstrated that Uighur living in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region had quite different genetic background which were quite distant from the subpopulations of Chinese Han, Hui and Mongol populations [18, 19]. The study of genetic differentiation across populations would shed insight into the genetic basis of hyperbilirubinemia risk in Asian newborns."

            "text": "Asian neonates were regarded as high-risk population for severe hyperbilirubinemia. The genetic background across population was an important risk factor modulating this disorder. UGT1A1, one of main factors for pathologic hyperbilirubinemia in newborns, varied within and between populations [8, 22]. In this study, we found that the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was much higher in full-term Chinese Han newborns than in Uighur newborns of Chinese population. Notably, our data also showed a significant different distribution of promoter variation in UGT1A1- encoding for hepatic bilirubin metabolism enzyme in Han and Uighur. Taken together, we inferred that promoter TATA box variation might be a risk factor that modulated neonatal hyperlipidemia risk in Chinese Han and Uighur newborns. Our results were consistent with Beutler et al. study in African, Europe and Asia population, which has firstly reported the genetic difference of TA7 and serum bilirubin level among populations, they proposed that the (TA)n repeat might be a balanced polymorphism evolutionarily selected to maintain serum bilirubin in an optimal range in the face of largely undefined\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279059.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279059 December 15, 2022 6 / 12\ngenetic and environmental pressures [23]. Our study further confirmed this hypothesis. Moreover, considering the difference of TA7 mutation rate and bilirubin level in Asia and Caucasian population, the data obtained in the study added more evidence to previous genetic studies in Uighur ethnic group which has suggested that Uighur ethnic group was a gene admixture of Eastern Asian and European populations, and much closed to European than other ethnics in China [18, 19].\nUGT1A1 coding sequence variant c.211 G>A (UGT1A1\ufffd6, G71R), common variant pre-\ndominant in Asia population while not found in Caucasian population, was the main cause of\n# In the linear regression analysis, neonates with wild UGT1A1 genotype (i.e. G/G) was set as reference group under the dominant genetic model assumption, while both those wildtype and the heterozygous UGT1A1 variant carrier (i.e. G/G+G/A) were set as the reference group under the recessive model.

In this study, we confirmed the strong association of the UGT1A1 coding sequence variant c.211 G>A (UGT1A1\ufffd6, G71R) with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk in both Han and Uighur newborns in China. Moreover, our data showed no statistic differences in the frequency of c.211G>A variant among Chinese Han and Uighur newborns. Therefore, on the one hand, the results here demonstrated that Chinese ethic groups shared a clade, though high genetic differentiation exists among Uighur minority and other Chinese ethnic groups. At the same time, it further demonstrated the necessity of screening of this exon mutation to identify high-risk neonates who tend to be suffered from severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in all Chinese ethnic groups. On the other hand, our results revealed that c.211 variant could not explain the difference of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk in Chinese Han and Uighur newborns, though its predominant role in Chinese neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk was certain.\nAs described previously, the (TA)n repeat variant in the UGT1A1 promoter was another\nextensively studied variant. As for the influence of genetic factors on the UGT1A1 enzyme activity, previous studies believed that the transcription level of UGT1A1 was mainly affected by TATA polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 promoter [23]. Promoters containing seven thymine adenine(ta) repeats have been found to be less active than the wild-type six repeats, and the serum bilirubin levels of persons homozygous or even heterozygous for seven repeats have been found to be higher than those with the wild-type six repeats [24\u201326]. However, the role of this variant on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk was not yet defined. i.e. A(TA)7TAA variations (UGTA\ufffd28), was described as the common cause of Gilbert\u2019s syndrome in the Caucasian population, whereas most previous studies in east Asian countries failed to find this association\na: Difference comparison for\u2460 vs\u2461+\u2462 vs\u2463+\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 and for\u2461+\u2462 vs\u2463+\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 and\u2460 vs\u2463+\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 within the 3 group. b: Difference comparison for\u2460+\u2461 vs\u2462+\u2463 vs\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 and for\u2462+\u2463 vs\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 and\u2460+\u2461 vs\u2464+\u2465+\u2466 within the 3 group.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279059.t004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279059 December 15, 2022 8 / 12\n[27, 28]. Recently, one meta-analysis had identified that homozygous while not heterozygous (TA)7 was associated with increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in both Asia and European population [29]. In this study, two case of homozygous (TA)7 was observed in Uighur neonate with significant hyperbilirubinemia. Further large-scale population research was necessary to verify the effect of TATA box on the risk of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborns.\nWe acknowledged that this study has some limitations. First, this study was limited by the\nsmall number of neonates enrolled. Some of the trends observed in the study could have reached statistical significance if the study sample had been larger (P = 0.05, Tables 4 and 5). Second, our inability to assess the serum bilirubin for most of the studied neonates, so we used TCB instead of TSB to subgroup our study cohort. Previous studies have shown a linear relationship exists between TcB and TSB, though the correlation significantly decreased when the TCB was high(>229umol/l) [30]. Recently, a system review and meta-analysis by Yu et al also showed that TCB nomogram was as efficient as TSB nomogram for identifying subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia [31]. Thus, it\u2019s applicable to use TcB nomograms to identify neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in this study.\nIn conclusion, screening for UGT1A1 coding region 211 G to A variation should be taken\ninto consideration to identify the risk group who tend to be suffered from severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in all Chinese populations. What\u2019s more, our results supported previous hypothesis that the importance of UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism in regulation of plasma bilirubin level within ethnic groups. In future studies, it should be necessary to increase the number ethnic groups analyses in order to assess more data about the genetic basis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk from the main ethnic groups of the Chinese population."
