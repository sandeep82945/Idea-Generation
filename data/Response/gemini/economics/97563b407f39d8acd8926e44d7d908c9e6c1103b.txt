1. **Investigate the genetic basis of STEM occupations in different ethnic and racial groups.** The current study only examined the genetic basis of STEM occupations in a sample of European ancestry. It would be interesting to see if the same genetic variants are associated with STEM occupations in other ethnic and racial groups.
2. **Examine the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and other measures of socioeconomic attainment.** The current study only examined the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and three measures of socioeconomic attainment: STEM jobs, educational attainment, and household income. It would be interesting to see if STEM polygenic scores are also associated with other measures of socioeconomic attainment, such as job satisfaction, career advancement, and occupational prestige.
3. **Investigate the causal relationship between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic attainment.** The current study only found a correlation between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic attainment. It would be interesting to conduct a causal study to determine whether STEM polygenic scores actually cause socioeconomic attainment.
4. **Examine the role of environmental factors in moderating the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic attainment.** The current study did not examine the role of environmental factors in moderating the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic attainment. It would be interesting to see if environmental factors, such as family background, educational opportunities, and peer influences, can affect the relationship between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic attainment.
5. **Develop interventions to promote STEM education and jobs for individuals with high STEM polygenic scores.** The current study found that individuals with high STEM polygenic scores are more likely to pursue STEM education and jobs. It would be interesting to develop interventions to promote STEM education and jobs for individuals with high STEM polygenic scores. These interventions could help to increase the number of STEM professionals in the workforce and improve the economic outcomes of individuals with high STEM polygenic scores.
