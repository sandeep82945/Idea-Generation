            "text": "Indentation of an elastic disk on a circular supporting ring\nTristan Suzanne, Julien Deschamps, Marc Georgelin, Gwenn Boedec Aix Marseille University, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, IRPHE, Marseille, France\n(Dated: May 26, 2023)\nThin elastic two-dimensionnal systems under compressive stresses may relieve part of their stretching energy by developing out of plane undulations. We investigate experimentally and theoretically the indentation of an elastic disk supported by a circular ring and show that compressive stresses are relieved via two different routes : either developing buckles which are spread over the system or developing a d-cone where deformation is concentrated in a subregion of the system. We characterize the indentation threshold for wrinkles or d-cone existence as a function of aspect ratio.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIndentation of an elastic material through a circular hole occurs in many situations, like in metal forming processes such as deep drawing [1] where a sheet of metal is pushed with a punch through a cavity, or to probe the mechanical properties of two-dimensional materials [2] such as graphene where suspended layers can be deformed with AFM tips. In both macroscale deep-drawing experiments on metal sheets and atomic-thin films indentation tests, a characteristic wrinkling instability may appear [3\u20136]. Indeed, pushing an elastic disk through a hole induces compressive orthoradial stresses, which may be relieved by out-of-plane undulations called wrinkles. The onset of wrinkling on circular elastic sheets, their extent and their wavelength have been the subjects of numerous works in various situations, where the compressive stresses are generated by shearing [7], capillary forces [8], suction [9], indentation of floating sheets [10] or gravity-induced deflection [11]. A prototypical situation to study wrinkles apparition in these situations is the Lame\u0301 setup [12] where an initially flat annulus of elastic material is subjected to differential tension at the inner and the outer edge. However, this setup is not always realized in practice, because significant deflection of the annulus may occur prior to wrinkling, changing the pre-wrinkled stress field. Moreover, the importance of the aspect ratio of the system has been highlighted in theoretical works [13, 14] and in experiments on floating annulus stretched by differential surface tension [15], yet most studies focus on the limit of infinite sheets.\nOn the other hand, thin elastic sheets also show a limit behavior called \u201dinextensible\u201d where, if possible, all the elastic energy is stored as bending energy and stretching deformation is avoided : in the indentation process, this is prohibited by Gauss\u2019 Theorema Egregium, which implies that passing from a flat state (zero Gaussian curvature) to a doubly curved state (non zero Gaussian curvature) cannot be isometric everywhere in the sheet. This leads to the formation of the so called d-cone [16, 17], where deformation is isometric almost everywhere, except for a stretching core under the indenter tip. The d-cone is also a building block for the description of crumpling [18], and recent works have shown that its particular mechanical properties may be suitable for generating electricity via flexoelectricity [19\u201321]. The mechanics of d-cone has been studied theoretically [16, 17, 22] and experimentally [23, 24], with a particular focus on the force-indentation relationship as well as the apparition of crescent shapes in the core region, with a scaling of the size of the core depending on thickness and indentation [22]. However, in these experiments, a wrinkled state has never been reported while, as discussed in the preceeding paragraph, it can be expected from experiments on similar systems. Indeed, the indentation of an elastic disk through a circular hole is a system that may exhibit two different ways of relieving the stretching energy : either wrinkling where some stretching is still present in a diffuse manner, or by forming a d-cone, where the stretching energy is focused in a small zone. To our knowledge, the connection between the two different responses of the system has not been investigated.\nIn this paper, we conduct experiments on various elastic materials to obtain a state diagram showing the zone of existence of wrinkles and d-cone as a function of the aspect ratio and the central indentation. We show that both require to reach a (different) critical indentation to appear, which depends on the thickness of the membrane and on the aspect ratio. We rationalize these experimental findings for wrinkling by conducting a linear stability analysis of the system, which is in good agreement with the wrinkling boundary, and discuss the threshold for d-cone with a scaling analysis of the energies involved."

The indentation depth and force are \u03b4 and F respectively (figure 1). The system is thus considered as the combination of two sub-regions, the inner part defined by 0 \u2264 r < a and the outer annulus defined by a < r \u2264 b.

For small indentations, the whole disk deflects upwards axisymmetrically. It adopts a curved shape revealing a non-zero gaussian curvature accompanied by a compressive azimuthal stress : this is the axisymmetric state. Increasing again the indentation may lead the disk to deform into two different states. A part of the stretching energy accumulated in the axisymmetric state may be relaxed to bending energy which leads to out-of-plane undulations of the outer annulus : this is the buckled state. Or the stretching energy may be relaxed by focusing in a core region near the indentation tip while the rest of the disk adopts a developable conical shape : this is the so-called d-cone. A remarkable difference between the d-cone and the buckled state is that in the buckled state we do not observe a noticeable lift of the disk from the supporting ring, while in the d-cone state there is a clear loss of contact with the supporting ring over an angular portion of 110\u00b1 5\u25e6[23]."

The indenter is made from long screw whose tip is a half sphere of radius 1 mm. The indenter is attached to a load cell to measure the force exerted by the tip. Depending on the disk material, K3D40 50 N from ME-Systeme or 1 N to 8 N load cells from Phidgets are used. The load cell is vertically moved by a precision linear translation stage LMS 180 supplied by Physik Instrumente. The stage and the load cell are controlled by Labview from National Instrument. As supporting rings we used hollow punches supplied by BOEHM. Additional manual precision stages enable to center and align the indenter with the support ring. A digital camera NIKON 5300 controlled by DigiCamControl software is used to capture picture of the disk (see figure 3(a)) . Image processing is performed with Matlab.\nDisks are cut into elastic sheets made of three different materials : PDMS, Silicone and PET (Mylar). PET disks are obtained from standard stencil sheets. PDMS and Silicone sheets are both made by mixing curing agent and a polymer base. The curing agent concentration was kept constant for silicone RTV 181 purchased from Esprit Composite while for PDMS, Silgard 184 purchased from Merck, we varied the curing agent concentration in order to\n3\nchange the Young modulus by an order of magnitude. Air bubbles are removed from the mixture liquid phase in a vacuum chamber. Then we let the mixture cure for at least 24h at room temperature between two planar parallel plates made of aluminium with a controlled spacing. When unmoulded, we control the homogeneity of the sheet by measuring the thickness in different locations with a Palmer micrometer. This process is repeated to obtain an average value of its thickness (typical variations are reported in table I). The Young modulus is measured with a homemade tensile test machine that consists of two clamps that hold the material specimen. One clamp is fixed while the other is linked to a load cell attached to the translation stage. For each material, diameter, thickness and Young modulus ranges are reported in table I. Once the disk is cut from the sheet and characterized, it is gently deposited and centered on the support ring of radius a."

For a critical indentation \u03b4b the edge starts to undulate revealing a wrinkling instability. To determine precisely this critical value we observe the disk from a side view and we measure, after image processing on Matlab, the amplitude of the edge undulations as a function of the indentation. A zero amplitude characterizes the axisymmetrical state while a non-zero amplitude reveals the wrinkled state. This method is appropriate for disks with a millimetric thickness, as our disks made of PDMS and silicone (figure 4), but is not suitable for thin disk of Mylar since the undulations could not be properly resolved. For these disks, we use an alternative method based on deflectometry (see figure 3(b)): a screen with a radial pattern of alternating black and white stripes is placed above\n4\nthe flat state disk in a parallel way. Using a small hole in the screen, we take pictures of the reflection of this pattern in the Mylar sheet which acts as a mirror. For axisymmetric deformations, the image shows radial symmetry, while for wrinkled state, this symmetry is broken. To determine wrinkling threshold unambiguously, we construct a diagram of pixel intensity over a circle with angle as abscissa, indentation as ordinate : axisymmetric regime corresponds to indentations where the boundaries between black and white stripes remain straight, while wrinkling apparition is characterized by an apparent convergence of stripes in the convex zones and an apparent divergence of stripes in the concave zones (see figure 5). From this diagram we measure the orthoradial displacement of the boundaries between black and white radial stripes as a function of the indentation. This displacement can be related to surface slope using simple geometrical optics relations [25]. We then integrate the slope to obtain the orthoradial deflection. We finally determine a lower and upper bound for the transition by measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of the orthoradial undulations. The upper bound corresponds to an amplitude A of the disk of about its thickness h as for the lateral observation for thick disks."

Measuring the force-indentation relationship, these three different states corresponds to two different branches (see figure 6): the first branch (axisymmetric and wrinkled) is dominated by stretching, giving a force scaling as \u03b43, while the second branch (d-cone) is dominated by bending, giving a force scaling as \u03b4. Starting from the flat reference and increasing the indentation, the system follows the stretching branch. At regular indentation intervals, we test the possibility to form a d-cone by slightly raising the outer edge with a tip. For small indentations, the system relax to the stretching branch (monitored by the force value), while for higher indentations the system may find another equilibrium with a smaller force value. Note that, if we do not perturb manually the system to form a d-cone, there is always an indentation such that the stretching branch relaxes spontaneously on the d-cone branch. When the d-cone branch is found, it is possible to switch back to the stretching branch by carefully flattening the d-cone. To determine the intersection \u03b4d of the two branches, we then decrease slightly the indentation and check for the existence of two different equilibrium (characterized by different values of force exerted on the indenter). We continue this process until only one branch is found : plotting the force-indentation curve the critical indentation for the stability of the d-cone is defined as the abscissa of the intersection of the two curves (see figure 6).\n5"

We emphasize that the amplitude of the modes is irrelevant at linear order since it cannot be computed by the stability analysis : however, the spatial structure reflects what can be expected in a weakly nonlinear regime where the system can be described as a combination of a few linearly unstable modes. The spatial structure depends on the aspect ratio and on the mode number, but only weakly on the dimensionless indentation : for a fixed set of (\u03b1, n) parameters, changing \u03b4 mostly changes the eigenvalue \u03bb. For all mode numbers and aspect ratios, the eigenfunction is maximal at the outer edge, and presents a secondary oscillation of opposite sign in the inner region, with an amplitude much lower that the deflection of the outer edge.

These curves are almost flat for small aspect ratios, and then increase sharply when the aspect ratio tends to 1. The most unstable wavenumber depends on the aspect ratio : e.g. for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 0.3] the mode n = 2 is the most unstable, while for \u03b1 \u2208 [0.3, 0.5] the most unstable is n = 3.

Thus, in the limit of small overhang of the disk over the support, several different modes can be observed in practice, even close to the boundary: this is consistent with our experiments where, for large \u03b1, it is generally possible to observe multi-stability close to the wrinkling threshold by manually forcing the disk to adopt a different wavenumber, while for small \u03b1, only the large wavelength modes n = 2, 3 are observed close to threshold.

The Mylar observations from three-quarter view doesn\u2019t allow to reveal the typical behavior that Silicone does. That support the necessity to use deflectometry for Mylar to reveal the instability. In the following we then focus on and describe only the silicone behavior. Starting from a flat state (picture a), the indentation first leads to an axisymmetric state (picture b). After crossing the stability boundary, the wrinkling instabilty appears (picture c): even weak, the undulation is visible by looking closely at the edge of the disk. When the amplitude of the undulations is more pronounced (picture d and e), the global shape is clearer : a mode n=6 is observed (n=5 for Mylar). Note the multi-stability characteristic of the system highlighted by the pictures d, d\u2019 and d\u201d : these three pictures, taken at a constant value of parameters, represent buckled modes n=6, n=5 and d-cone shape respectively. While the previous sequence is for \u03b1 fixed when the indentation increases, a second one reveals the shape transformation for silicone when \u03b1 increases for a fixed non-dimensional indentation \u03b4/h (pictures f to i). This sequence illustrates qualitatively the evolution of the mode number n with aspect ratio.

At a critical indentation \u03b4b, this shape is unstable with respect to azimuthal wrinkling. At a second critical indentation \u03b4d > \u03b4b, d-cone branch becomes another possible stable solution. For\n12\n\u03b1 \u2273 0.7, starting from zero indentation, the disk first deforms following the axisymmetric branch. At a critical indentation \u03b4d, the d-cone branch becomes a possible solution (the axisymmetric branch being still stable). At a second critical indentation \u03b4b > \u03b4d, the axisymmetric branch loses stability to azimuthal buckling. In both scenarios, multistability is generally present in the system : far from wrinkling threshold, different azimuthal wavenumbers can be observed. Moreover, close to the d-cone threshold, the stretching branch (axisymmetric or wrinkled) is still locally stable : the system can be switched from d-cone to wrinkled state or the opposite. This is an interesting feature of this system which shall allow to probe further the connection between diffuse states (axisymmetric or wrinkled) and a focused state (d-cone). This duality is present in many elastic systems, in particular in the wrinkle to fold transition [31, 32]. The apparition of a localized structure in these systems have been analyzed in terms of nonlinear effects leading to a modulation of the amplitude of the homogeneous pattern [33]. In this regard, the road to a localized pattern is a continuous evolution from a homogeneous pattern whose envelope progressively localize on only one oscillation : whether the transition between stretching and d-cone states belongs to the same class is an attractive perspective that we plan to adress in the future. Other metastable states can also be observed at higher indentations, such as a conical shape with two folds [22]. Another interesting perspective is the effect of gravity: when G parameter is no longer small, we observed in preliminary experiments that a greater variety of behaviors can be observed, such as g-cones reported in [34]. Gravity also affects the formation of wrinkles, even without central indentation [27] : the diagram 12 can be extended with a third axis, a task that we leave for future works.\n[1] J. A.
