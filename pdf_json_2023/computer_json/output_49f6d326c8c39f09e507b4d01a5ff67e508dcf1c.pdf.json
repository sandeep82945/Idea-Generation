    "abstractText": "In the era of space exploration, the implications of space weather have become increasingly evident. Central to this is the phenomenon of coronal holes, which can significantly influence the functioning of satellites and aircraft. These coronal holes, present on the sun, are distinguished by their open magnetic field lines and comparatively cooler temperatures, leading to the emission of solar winds at heightened rates. To anticipate the effects of these coronal holes on Earth, our study harnesses computer vision to pinpoint the coronal hole regions and estimate their dimensions using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Further, we deploy deep learning methodologies, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach, to analyze the trends in the data related to the area of the coronal holes and predict their dimensions across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By evaluating the time series data concerning the area of the coronal holes, our research seeks to uncover patterns in the behavior of coronal holes and comprehend their potential influence on space weather occurrences. This investigation marks a pivotal stride towards bolstering our capacity to anticipate and brace for space weather events that could have ramifications for Earth and its technological apparatuses.",

These regions on the sun, characterized by open magnetic field lines and cooler temperatures, emit solar winds at higher rates than their surroundings. Such emissions have profound implications for Earth, influencing operations of aircraft, satellites, and even terrestrial technologies [15, 44].\nSpace weather, driven by solar activities, affects the vast expanse between the Sun and Earth, encompassing the solar wind, Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere [39]. Phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections are pivotal in shaping space weather, with consequences ranging from satellite communication disruptions to compromised GPS signal accuracy [44, 48].\nWhile the significance of coronal holes in influencing space weather is well-established, there exists a gap in the literature concerning the prediction of their size and evolution. Accurate prediction of coronal hole dimensions is pivotal, as their size and position can directly influence the intensity and impact of solar wind streams on Earth [9, 29].\nAddressing this research gap, our study introduces a novel approach that combines computer vision techniques with deep learning methodologies to predict the size of coronal holes.

Various methodologies, ranging from manual inspection to automated computer vision techniques, have been employed to identify these regions on the sun. For instance, several studies have utilized image processing techniques on data from observatories to detect the cooler and less dense regions that characterize coronal holes. While these methods have been successful in identifying the presence of coronal holes, they often do not provide insights into the future behavior or evolution of these regions.\nIn recent advancements, Linker et al. [32] presented a deep learning approach using a U-Net architecture to detect coronal holes in solar images. Their method emphasizes the potential of deep learning in improving space weather forecasting. Similarly, Jarolim et al. [27] introduced a convolutional neural network model named CHRONNOS, which utilizes multi-channel data for precise coronal hole boundary detection. Their approach showcases the potential of CNNs in providing reliable coronal hole detections suitable for real-time applications. While these methods significantly improved the detection accuracy, the focus remained primarily on identification rather than prediction.\nLack of Predictive Models: One of the significant gaps in the existing literature is the absence of robust predictive models for coronal holes. While detection models are abundant, very few, if any, studies have delved into predicting the future size, shape, or behavior of coronal holes. This is a crucial distinction as understanding the future behavior of these holes can provide insights into potential space weather events, which can have profound implications for Earth-based technologies.\nNovelty of Our Approach: Our research introduces a pioneering approach to this domain by not only detecting but also predicting the dimensions of coronal holes. By employing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, we harness the power of deep learning to forecast the area of the coronal hole in the Sun\u2019s middle region over a span of seven days. This predictive capability is a significant advancement in the field and addresses a critical gap in the existing literature. The ability to anticipate the behavior of coronal holes can provide valuable lead time for preparations against potential space weather events.\nIn conclusion, while there have been substantial efforts in the detection of coronal holes, the predictive aspect remains largely unexplored. Our research fills this void by introducing a novel methodology\nthat promises enhanced predictive accuracy, positioning our work as a groundbreaking contribution to the field."

Our methodology can be broadly divided into two main phases: Coronal Hole Detection using computer vision and Time Series Prediction using deep learning.\nAs depicted in Figure 2, the first phase focuses on the detection of coronal holes. This is achieved through a series of computer vision techniques that process solar images, enhancing their features and converting them into a format suitable for analysis. The primary objective of this phase is to accurately identify and delineate the coronal hole regions in the images, ensuring that the data fed into the subsequent phase is precise.\nThe second phase, as shown on the right side of Figure 2, involves the application of a deep learning model to the data obtained from the first phase. This model is trained on time series data of the detected coronal hole areas, enabling it to predict future trends and variations in the size and position of the coronal holes. The combination of computer vision for detection and deep learning for prediction ensures a comprehensive and robust approach to understanding and forecasting the behavior of coronal holes."

This method reduces ambiguous\nand noisy areas in the images, making the black regions, which represent the coronal holes, more prominent. Fig 4 shows the original image and anti-noised image.\nThe non-local means (NLmeans) anti-noising method is a sophisticated technique that leverages the redundancy of information in an image [10]. Unlike local methods, which only consider nearby pixels, NLmeans considers the entire image to determine the best way to denoise each pixel.\nThe NLmeans algorithm operates under the assumption that if two small patches in an image look similar, they should have similar denoised outputs. The mathematical representation of the NLmeans process is[10]:\nJ(x) = 1\nW (x) \u2211 y\u2208\u2126 I(y) \u00b7K(x, y) (1)\nWhere K(x, y) is a weighting function that measures the similarity between patches centered at pixels x and y. The function is defined as:\nK(x, y) = exp\n( \u2212||I(x)\u2212 I(y)||2\nh2\n) (2)\nThe parameter h controls the decay of the weights and effectively determines the degree of smoothing."

The threshold method was used for binarization, where pixels with values above a certain threshold are turned white, and those below are turned black. Fig 4 shows the original image and the binarized image.\nImage binarization is a fundamental step in image processing, especially when the goal is to highlight specific features of an image. By converting an image into a binary format, we can easily differentiate between the regions of interest and the background.\nThe mathematical representation of the binarization process is [17]:\nB(x, y) = { 1 if I(x, y) > T 0 otherwise\n(3)\nWhere T is a threshold value that determines the boundary between the two binary values."

By contouring the coronal hole, we can easily delineate its area.\nContours are continuous curves that follow a boundary. Detecting these contours, especially in images with noise, requires sophisticated techniques. The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is one such technique that first smoothens the image using a Gaussian filter and then finds the second derivative to detect the edges.\nThe LoG operator is mathematically represented as[33]:\nL(x, y) = (x2 + y2 \u2212 \u03c32) \u00b7 G(x, y) 2\u03c0\u03c34\n(4)\nWhere G(x, y) is the Gaussian function:\nG(x, y) = 1\n2\u03c0\u03c32 exp\n( \u2212(x2 + y2)\n2\u03c32\n) (5)\nThe LoG operator is particularly effective because it is sensitive to rapid changes in intensity, which often correspond to the boundaries of objects in images."

It\u2019s calculated as:\nit = \u03c3(Wiixt + bii +Whiht\u22121 + bhi)\nHere, \u03c3 is the sigmoid activation function, which squashes values between 0 and 1, ensuring a gate value in this range.\nForget Gate (ft): Decides the amount of past information (from the previous cell state) to be retained or discarded.\nft = \u03c3(Wifxt + bif +Whfht\u22121 + bhf )\nOutput Gate (ot): Controls the amount of information from the current cell state to be outputted to the hidden state.\not = \u03c3(Wioxt + bio +Whoht\u22121 + bho)\nNew Cell Information (c\u0303t): Represents the new information to be potentially added to the cell state.\nc\u0303t = tanh(Wicxt + bic +Whcht\u22121 + bhc)\nThe tanh function outputs values between -1 and 1, providing a normalized weight to the new information.\nCell State Update (ct): Combines the past cell state with the new cell information, modulated by the input and forget gates. ct = ft \u2299 ct\u22121 + it \u2299 c\u0303t Here, \u2299 denotes element-wise multiplication. Hidden State Update (ht): Determines the output hidden state based on the current cell state and the output gate. ht = ot \u2299 tanh(ct) Notations:\n\u2022 xt: Represents the input vector at the current time step t.\n\u2022 W and b: Denote the weight matrices and bias vectors associated with each gate.\n\u2022 \u03c3: The sigmoid activation function, which outputs values between 0 and 1.\n\u2022 \u2299: Symbolizes element-wise multiplication. \u2022 tanh: The hyperbolic tangent activation function, producing values between -1 and 1.\nIn essence, the LSTM\u2019s intricate design, characterized by its gates and memory cells, equips it with the capability to judiciously manage information flow. This ensures that it can effectively handle sequences with long-term dependencies, making informed decisions on what information to retain, update, or discard based on the prevailing context."

            "text": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, being a specialized form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), offer several advantages that make them particularly suited for our research on predicting the area of coronal holes based on time series data:\n\u2022 Handling Sequential Data: LSTMs are inherently designed to process sequential data. Given that our dataset chronicles the areas of coronal holes over time, the sequential nature of LSTMs makes them a natural fit. In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily designed for spatial hierarchies, making them ideal for image data but less so for time series data.\n\u2022 Long-term Dependencies: One of the primary strengths of LSTMs is their ability to remember and leverage long-term dependencies in data. This is crucial for our research, as past observations of coronal holes can significantly influence future predictions. Traditional RNNs struggle with this aspect due to the vanishing gradient problem, but LSTMs effectively address this issue with their gating mechanisms.\n\u2022 Avoiding the Vanishing Gradient Problem: LSTMs, with their unique architecture, can mitigate the vanishing gradient problem that plagues traditional RNNs. This ensures that they can effectively learn from earlier time steps, even in long sequences.\n\u2022 Flexibility: LSTMs can be easily retrained with new data, allowing them to adapt to evolving patterns in the coronal hole areas over time. This adaptability ensures that the model remains relevant and accurate as more data becomes available.\n\u2022 Interpretability: The sequential nature of LSTMs, combined with their ability to weigh the importance of different inputs at different time steps, offers a clearer understanding of how past data points influence future predictions. This level of transparency can be more challenging to achieve with some deep learning models, especially deep CNNs.\n\u2022 Efficiency: While deep CNNs might require more layers and, consequently, more computational resources, especially when dealing with large images, LSTMs can efficiently process long sequences without necessitating extensive computational power.\nWhy LSTM over CNN or Other Deep Learning Models? While CNNs have proven effective in many applications, especially those involving image data, their primary strength lies in recognizing spatial patterns. Our research, however, is centered around recognizing temporal patterns in time series data, a domain where LSTMs excel. Additionally, other deep learning models might not offer the same level of efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability as LSTMs, especially when dealing with long-term dependencies in sequential data.\nIn conclusion, the choice of LSTM for our research is not only driven by its inherent strengths but also by its clear advantages over other potential models for this specific application."

By meticulously analyzing the data through the BCH model, we lay a robust foundation for subsequent deep learning applications, ensuring that our predictions are grounded in reality and are of practical relevance.\nFig. 6 provides a comprehensive view of the coronal hole areas on the sun, specifically on August 10, 2021, juxtaposed with data spanning back to January 6, 2011. A discernible trend emerges from this analysis: the coronal hole area has been on a gradual incline over the past decade. The middle region, in particular, has witnessed a pronounced expansion, hinting at the possibility of the coronal hole widening its expanse. However, a caveat remains: a decade, in the grand scheme of solar dynamics, is a relatively short window. For a more holistic understanding of the coronal hole\u2019s behavior, a more extended dataset would be invaluable.\nSolar scholars have long been intrigued by the sun\u2019s corona, a region known for its dynamism and frequent flux. Coronal hole expansions have been observed to be in tandem with the solar cycle, an 11-year cycle punctuated by the ebb and flow of solar activities like sunspots, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The expansion observed in our study might be tethered to the current phase of this solar cycle. However, establishing this causal link necessitates further probing.\nFig. 8 delves into the relationship between the AP index and the coronal hole areas in the middle and red zone regions of the sun over a 50-day period. The graph underscores a correlation, suggesting that as the coronal hole area swells, the AP index follows suit after a short lag. This observation is pivotal as it hints at the potential of using coronal hole areas as a predictor for geomagnetic disturbances."

These disturbances, gauged by the AP index, can be triggered by high-speed solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes [55]. Such disturbances can wreak havoc, causing power grid failures [8], communication disruptions, satellite damage [3], and more. Our research aimed to unearth the relationship between the coronal hole\u2019s size in the middle region and Earth\u2019s geomagnetic activity.\nOur BCH model, built on AIA 193 images from NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory [43], has proven instrumental in this endeavor. The model\u2019s accuracy in measuring coronal hole areas has enabled us to establish a robust correlation between the size of the coronal hole in the middle region and Earth\u2019s geomagnetic activity. Specifically, a surge in the coronal hole size often precedes a spike in the AP index by 3-4 days.\nFig. 8 further elucidates this relationship. Rapid expansions in the red zone and middle area are often precursors to a subsequent rise in the AP index [21]. Such expansions are typically triggered by solar activities like solar flares [28] or coronal mass ejections [20], which can disrupt Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere [18]. Monitoring these areas, coupled with other solar activity indicators, is paramount to anticipate and brace for potential AP index surges [41]."

            "text": "Before diving into the experimental results, it\u2019s crucial to understand the methodology underpinning our research. Our approach harnesses deep learning, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, to predict the area of the coronal hole in the Sun\u2019s middle region. The LSTM model is particularly suited for time-series data, as it can capture long-term dependencies in sequences. By feeding the model a decade\u2019s worth of data, we train it to recognize patterns and trends in the solar corona\u2019s behavior, allowing it to make informed forecasts.\nNow, one might wonder, why a decade? Why such an extensive dataset? The answer lies at the intersection of deep learning, solar physics, and statistical robustness. Deep learning models, especially those like LSTM, thrive on large datasets. The more data they\u2019re exposed to, the better they can generalize and predict unseen scenarios [19]. From a solar physics perspective, a decade encompasses an entire solar cycle, a period that captures the Sun\u2019s transition from solar maximum to solar minimum and vice versa. This duration ensures our model is exposed to the full gamut of solar activities, from the quietest to the most tumultuous periods [43]. Statistically, larger datasets reduce the variance of predictions, leading to more consistent and reliable outcomes [22].\nFig. 9 presents our LSTM model\u2019s attempt at predicting the area of the coronal hole in the Middle region of the Sun over a week. The predictions, while not perfect, align reasonably with the actual observations, suggesting that the LSTM can recognize and leverage patterns in the data.\nUnderstanding and predicting the size of coronal holes is of significant interest. Their size and location can influence the emergence and trajectory of CMEs and CIRs. CMEs, essentially large bursts of solar wind and magnetic fields from the solar corona, can impact our magnetosphere when directed towards Earth. CIRs are high-speed solar wind streams that can induce geomagnetic storms and auroras [52].\nBy employing deep learning, particularly LSTM models, we hope to enhance space weather forecasting. The ability to anticipate the size and location of coronal holes can provide insights into potential space weather events, allowing for timely preparations.\nIn conclusion, our study underscores the potential of deep learning in space weather research. While our LSTM model\u2019s performance, trained on a decade of data, is promising, the sun\u2019s behavior is influenced by a myriad of factors. Thus, while a decade of data has provided insights, longer datasets might further enrich our understanding and predictions."

These winds can potentially affect Earth\u2019s satellite functions and its power grids. Hence, determining the expanse of the coronal hole is pivotal to predict space weather occurrences and to decrease their potential negative effects.\nOur research has led to the formulation of a model that detects coronal holes, facilitating the accumulation of 3857 data entries related to them. This data served as the foundation for a deep learning prediction model tailored for assessing the size of the coronal holes. The incorporation of advanced deep learning tools, particularly LSTM models, for forecasting space weather series data has exhibited encouraging outcomes.
