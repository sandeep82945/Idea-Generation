Selective control of reactions at specic sites along the RNA enables functionalization of both small and large RNAs for future biotechnological and biomedical applications.4,5 For high-yield preparative reactions, acyl small-molecule reagents (Fig. 1) have been developed for substituting RNA with useful moieties such as biotin,6,7 uorophores,4,8 or click handles.8,9 Reactions can be carried out at superstoichiometric levels, reacting stochastically at multiple sites along an RNA strand,10,11 or they can be directed locally for high-yield reactions by inducing the formation of small reactive loops.4,5,12 Superstoichiometric reactions can enable control of RNA functions13\u201315 and protect RNA from degradation.16 Site-localized reactions have been employed for control of translation and for site-specic labeling.4,5 A challenge for developing site-selective RNA reactions is the problem of the existence of many chemically similar hydroxyls that all have the potential to react.

Chirality in nucleic acids is widely discussed and has been leveraged in numerous studies for selective recognition of small molecules with DNA;17\u201321 for example, chiral metal intercalator complexes have long been studied for their selectivity in associating with right-handed BDNA helices versus le-handed structures.17 However, for RNA much less attention has been paid to chiral recognition by small molecules.22 A chief example has been the testing of RNA on solid support as a stationary phase for chiral chromatography.23,24 Chiral uorinated diamines have also been tested as NMR probes of RNA.25 RNA aptamers selected for binding a naturally occurring small molecule have in a few cases also been shown to be selective for that enantiomer over the opposite one.26,27While the number of small molecule ligands known to bind RNA is growing rapidly, the R-BIND database28 lists no enantiomer pairs among 131 ligands. However, in a recent example of chiral recognition by synthetic compounds, ligands for a bacterial RNA riboswitch have been shown to be stereoselective in binding.29\nAlthough large oligonucleotide conjugates have been investigated more recently,30\u201332 a small number of early studies described reactions of nucleotides with chiral small molecules. Prebiotic chemistry experiments several decades ago tested the reactions of activated amino acids with dinucleotides in DMF solutions, and documented yields of up to 12% at internal 2\u2032-OH and stereoselectivity up to 2 : 1.33 One report also tested\nChem.

Thus it remained unknown whether preparatively useful yields could be achieved with chiral compounds, whether higher levels of selectivity are possible, and whether folded RNA structure might affect stereoselectivity. Given this lack of information, multiple questions arise: to what degree can reagent stereochemistry inuence reactions at 2\u2032-OH? Second, does the addition of steric bulk that confers asymmetry near the reactive carbonyl hinder RNA reaction? Finally, and importantly, how does RNA folded structure locally inuence diastereoselectivity?\nTo begin to address these questions, we report here the study of enantiopairs of aqueous-soluble acylimidazole reagents having varied asymmetric substitution near their reactive carbonyl groups. Our ndings show that with appropriate substitution, reagents can demonstrate high diastereoselectivity and preparatively useful yields in RNA reaction. The results establish new strategies for selective RNA recognition, with applications in conjugation, modication, and mapping of the biopolymer."

Yields of adducts were assessed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see examples in Fig. 1, 2 and S1\u2020), assessing the conversion of the unmodied RNA to highermass products containing one or more acyl groups, and differential yields were recorded (Table 1). As stereoselectivity varies with time and reaction conversion (see below), reagent concentrations for each pair were adjusted for this initial screening to roughly similar levels of conversion.\nAmong these chiral scaffolds, we observed that several yielded signicant levels of diastereoselectivity in reaction with RNA (Table 1, Fig. S1 and S2\u2020). Note that the reaction sites in the single-stranded RNA were not controlled, and thus conversions reect aggregate yields, and diastereoselectivities represent aggregate selectivity in esterication reactions across these multiple 2\u2032-OH sites. Highest diastereoselectivity in this initial screen was observed for compounds 2, 8, and 11, with selectivities of up to 3.9 : 1 (R : S) for alanine derivative 2, and 2 : 1 for structurally related proline derivative 8.

We also investigated the effect of temperature on reactions (Fig. 2d), and observed increasing diastereoselectivity but decreasing reaction conversions with higher temperature.\nComparisons of reactions with RNA and DNA of the same sequence (Fig. 2e and S5\u2020) ruled out signicant reaction at exocyclic amines of the nucleobases.37 The results indicate that, as with most acylimidazoles tested to date, reaction occurs essentially exclusively at 2\u2032-OH groups, yielding ester linkages. Even the primary 5\u2032-alcohol of DNA does not appear to react substantially, consistent with the observation that the increased acidity of 2\u2032-OH groups is important for promoting reaction with RNA.38 As an additional control for observations of stereoselectivity, we conrmed that the two enantiomers of the most selective scaffold (R,S)-2 react equally with an achiral alcohol (Fig. S6\u2020).\nFor an initial test of whether RNA folded structure can inuence diastereoselectivity of 2\u2032-OH acylation, we compared\nFig. 2 Characterizing diastereoselectivity and conditions for RNA reactions of chiral reagents (R,S)-2.

The RT stop method involves single-hit conversions (ca. 0.1\u20131.0% of each reactive 2\u2032-OH), so the data provide a measure of kinetic selectivity of acylation at early timepoints of reaction.\nReactivity varies with structural context\nPlots of the data for positional reactivity of the two pairs of chiral molecules are shown in Fig. 3.

Also noteworthy for the chiral compounds is that small uridine loops are generally more reactive than those composed of adenosine nucleotides (Fig. S9\u2020), which is the opposite of what was seen for previous achiral aryl species.12,39\nFinally, we measured overall (averaged) selectivity of each compound ((R,S)-1, (R,S)-2) for acylation of unpaired loop residues over paired ones (stems) in the folded RNA library. This ratio has been used as a marker to evaluate acylating reagents for structure mapping; a high loop/stem (L/S) reactivity ratio indicates elevated signal over background. The data (Fig. 3c) show that each enantiomer has distinct loop/stem ratios, with compounds (R,S)-1 showing higher L/S values than (R,S)-2. The data for (R,S)-1 are particularly remarkable, with a higher value for (S)-1 than its mirror image; indeed, the L/S value of 8.5 for (S)-1 is considerably higher than that of all structure mapping acyl reagents currently in use.12,40\nLarge variations in positional diastereoselectivity\nNext we plotted diastereoselectivity at each position in the folded RNA library (Fig. 3b and S8\u2020). The data overall show that one enantiomer on average is more reactive than the other, as seen in individual RNA studies above, thus conrming chiral selectivity in general for reactions with naturally congured (D)RNA. Notably, positional diastereoselectivity varies widely with RNA structure (Fig. 3f, g, S10 and S11\u2020). Most loop positions exhibited greater than 2 : 1 diastereoselectivity, and remarkably, we observed near-complete (\u223c100%) diastereoselectivity at dozens of loop positions in the folded RNAs at the low reaction conversions of the experiment. Consistent with the highconversion mass spectrometry data, the (S) enantiomer is generally favored for scaffold 1, while the (R) enantiomer of 2 is favored at most positions (Fig. 3e).\nPositional diastereoselectivity in the folded RNAs varied both among distinct loop types and sizes, as well as along the different positions within a single loop, apparently reecting distinct chiral structural contexts. For example, very small hairpin loops (H2, H3) exhibit relatively low diastereoselectivity in reactions with scaffold 1 (Fig. 3f), and a three-way junction with a 3-nucleotide loop (T3) displays the opposite stereochemical preference relative to most other loops. We also evaluated diastereoselectivity with three single-stranded RNAs in the library (ssRNA): polyU, polyA, and a mixed A,C,G,U sequence (ss-combo). There was very little reactivity with polyA, as seen previously for achiral reagents, presumably reecting the high helicity of this sequence due to the strong stacking of adenines.41 As with folded sequences, scaffolds 1 and 2 showed opposite diastereoselectivity that was signicant especially for single-stranded polyU (Fig. 3e and S10\u2020). Overall, stereoselectivity is comparatively low for these relatively unconstrained RNAs, suggesting that the more rigid structural contexts in small loops enable greater discrimination between mirror-image reagents. The data also establish that sequence effects appear to be small for stereoselectivity as compared with folded structure, which has a signicantly larger inuence (Fig. S11\u2020).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nTo further explore the role of reagent stereochemistry in local nucleotide reactivity across this RNA library, we examined nucleotide-by-nucleotide positional correlations of reactivity of enantiomers of 1 and 2 (Fig. S12\u2020). Interestingly, enantiomers of 2 (the more stereoselective scaffold) show very little correlation with each other, while the enantiomers of 1 show a substantial positive correlation. This is also the case for prior relatively at aryl reagents NAIN3 and 1M7, which also correlate well in their positional reactivity.12 The results suggest that compounds with greater asymmetry can better sense differences in local chiral environment around each 2\u2032-OH.\nAveraging diastereoselectivity of reagent scaffolds 1 and 2 over all loops (Fig. 3e) revealed remarkable diastereoselectivity in loops, but almost no asymmetric discrimination in duplexes (stems). Taken together, our RNA library data conrm that 2\u2032- OH acylation by these chiral acylimidazole reagents occurs primarily at unpaired loop nucleotides, and that reactivity and diastereoselectivity, at least at low reaction conversions, vary greatly with local RNA loop structure. Small loops (especially bulge and internal loops) tend to show elevated reactivity and diastereoselectivity at discrete positions."

For comparison, established reagents 1M7 and NAIN3 have reported L/S reactivity ratios of 4.3 and 5.4, respectively;12 this difference suggests the possible future utility of chiral agents in RNA structure mapping with higher signal over background than is currently possible with the current generation of achiral mapping reagents. As a preliminary test of this possibility, we carried out SHAPE3 mapping studies of 5S ribosomal RNA in live HEK293 cells using the two enantiomers of 1. The data show that the reagent scaffold has intracellular reactivity similar to that of established compounds, achieving signal in 10 min (Fig. 4). Remarkably, the (S) enantiomer exhibits over twice the signal over background of the (R) enantiomer in mapping this intracellular RNA (Fig. 4b and c).

We reacted the products with a commercial strained alkyne-functionalized Cy5 dye to prepare uorescent-labeled adducts. Analysis by gel electrophoresis documents the much higher yield of the preferred enantiomer as seen by its strong labeling intensity (Fig. 5c), whereas the less-preferred enantiomer yields little visible uorescence. This clearly demonstrates that chirality can have large inuences in high-yield RNA labeling.\n13240 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13235\u201313243\nWhile most applications of modied RNAs involve strands of natural chirality (composed of D-ribose phosphodiester backbone), recent studies have investigated the properties and applications of enantiomeric (\u201cmirror image\u201d or \u201cspiegelmer\u201d) RNAs, with L-ribose as the source of chirality.42\u201347 Given the favorable properties of enantio-RNAs in applications such as aptameric ligands in biological settings, we investigated a further test of chiral selectivity in conjugation and labeling of enantiomeric RNA. We carried out reactions of D- and L-enantiomers of a short RNA having a reactive bulge loop structure (sequence B4A from the above library) using each enantiomer of the dimethylalanine reagent 2. MS data (Fig. 5d) documented conversions at 1 h of \u223c90% for each \u201cmatched\u201d pair of reagents with RNA ((R) with D-RNA; (S) with L-RNA), and considerably lower 5\u20138% conversions for the \u201cmismatched\u201d pairs. Diastereoselectivity was over 100 : 1 at early time points and averaged 24 : 1 at \u223c70% conversion. Thus, highly enantioselective reaction was seen for both native and mirror-image RNAs using reagents of appropriately matched handedness. Extending this to a functionalizable reagent, we reacted the enantiomers of azidoethyl-2 with the D- and L-RNAs, resulting in preparative\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The experiments conrm that both antipodes of the synthesized azidoethyl-alanine acylimidazole reagent do indeed function normally in acylation, allowing us to rule out degradation or impurity in one enantiomer leading to misinterpretation of selectivity. Taken together, the new ndings enable selective conjugation of natural RNA or its mirror image, which was previously not possible."

            "text": "Our experiments establish that chiral acylimidazole reagents with appropriate asymmetric substitution can exhibit substantial levels of diastereoselectivity in RNA reaction. This is, to our knowledge, the rst report of chiral selectivity for acylation of non-homopolymer RNAs. Multiple surprising ndings arise from the study regarding unusual reactivity and selectivity (vide infra). Our results add support to early reports of amino acid reactions with dinucleotides,33\u201335 conrming that amino acid derivatives can indeed react at 2\u2032-OH. The current work identies new reagents and RNA folded structures that exhibit considerably higher yields and greater diastereoselectivity than previously seen, establishes new reagents that enable highyielding and highly selective RNA modication, and demonstrates new applications of chirality.\nIt is clear from our initial screening data that reagent structure can have large effects on selectivity, as most of the reagents tested here show modest stereoselectivity. However, for selected scaffolds, we observe near-complete diastereoselectivity at low conversions at specic sites in folded RNA, and up to 24 : 1 diastereoselectivity in preparative reactions. These ndings add a new physicochemical dimension to the study of RNA recognition and reaction. Our ndings conrm chirality as a signicant and overlooked structural mechanism for selectivity control in covalent RNA recognition and conjugation.\nOur new results add the dimension of asymmetry as an important inuencing factor in reagent design, going beyond the effects of alkyl/aryl substitution and steric bulk.12,39,40 For example, our experiments have identied a chiral acylating species, (S)-1, that exhibits exceptionally high loop/stem selectivity relative to its enantiomer, and indeed considerably higher than that of any reported agent to date. No previous chiral compound has been employed in mapping of folded RNA structure. In our preliminary tests, this resulted in markedly improved signal over background in intracellular RNA mapping. Further exploration of this nding seems warranted, with the aim of developing future high-performing generations of transcriptome-probing reagents.\nIn addition, given the rapid development of RNAs as therapeutic agents, establishing methods to locally substitute RNA for conjugation is also of substantial interest;5,45,48 however, it is signicantly challenging, due to the large number of chemically similar groups in the biopolymer. In this light, our observation of the highly selective stoichiometric labeling reaction of (R)azidoethyl-2 seems promising (Fig. 4b and e). Taken together, the current studies establish the use of reagent chirality coupled\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nwith local RNA macro-chirality as a potentially promising strategy for enhancing local selectivity in RNA reaction; more work will be needed to establish ideal sequences and to test applications in longer biologically relevant RNAs.\nIt is interesting and noteworthy that a-amino compounds in this study (e.g. 2, 8) exhibit the opposite diastereoselectivity for RNA, for the most part, as the structurally analogous a-alkoxy compounds (e.g. 1, 10). This suggests that the two classes of compounds adopt distinct conformations that favor approach of 2\u2032-OH to the opposite faces of the reactive carbonyls. As a possible explanation (Fig. S16\u2020), we hypothesize that steric effects of the larger dialkylamino group relative to the alkoxy group play a role in this difference. More studies will be needed to shed light on this divergence, and a better understanding could possibly lead to future reagent designs with altered or improved selectivity.\nAlso remarkable and unexpected is our nding of exceptionally high reactivity by compounds (R,S)-2, and the (R) enantiomer in particular, in acylation of RNA. Indeed, (R)-2 is the most highly RNA-reactive compound yet described in the literature to our knowledge. An experiment benchmarking the reactivity of enantiomers of 2 in comparison to the most commonly applied previous acylation scaffolds employed in RNA research (1M7 and NAIN3) underscores this marked difference (Fig. S17\u2020). It seems likely that relative to non-basic alkoxy scaffolds, the protonation of the amine group in these N,N-dimethylaminoalanine derivatives at the pH of our reactions plays a role, by inductively activating the carbonyl carbon to greater electrophilicity, as supported by the high reactivity of 2 relative to non-protonated compound 1. Similarly, proline derivative 8 also shows higher reactivity (by a factor of >50-fold) than structurally related tetrahydrofuran scaffold 10. Comparisons of reactivity of (S)-2 and dimethylglycine (DMG) acylimidazoles (which differ by only a methyl group) reveal similar RNA reactivity and half-lives for hydrolysis (Fig. S3\u2020), indicating that the methyl substitution in (S) has little effect on carbonyl reactivity with water in this isomer. However, the (R) enantiomer of 2 shows higher reactivity for RNA than the (S) isomer (by a factor of roughly ten), and acylates the biopolymer with >90% conversions even at the remarkably low concentration of 100 mM, one thousand-fold lower than common concentrations of RNA acylating agents. This suggests that the methyl group substitution in the (R) conguration confers specially elevated reactivity with RNA.\nIn an effort to better understand the high reactivity of (R)-2, we considered whether the compound might bind RNA noncovalently. We followed up by performing a titration of concentration vs. conversion, and by testing the effects of competition by a chiral nonreactive analogue of (R)-2 (Fig. S18 and S19\u2020). The competitor did modestly reduce RNA yields at high concentrations, suggestive of binding, but had similar effects on the less reactive achiral compound DMG as well (Fig. S19\u2020). Given the similar reactivity of (R)-2 in multiple loop types (Fig. 3b), any RNA binding by this compound appears to be nonselective. More work is needed to fully understand the origin of this favorable chiral methyl effect, although the special\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13235\u201313243 | 13241\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The chiral reagent scaffolds studied here are in several cases commercially available as carboxylic acids and are easily activated to acylimidazole form in dry DMSO in one step without purication to yield stock solutions. Thus our ndings, and extensions to new chiral molecular scaffolds, should be readily accessible to other researchers. We envision multiple outcomes that may result in the long term. For example, it may prove possible to develop chiral probes that are specic for certain folded RNA motifs. Second, further study may lead to the identication of folded structural contexts that may be functionalized selectively over more commonmotifs (such as duplex regions) in RNAs, enabling improved site selectivity in localized conjugation and labeling of larger RNAs. Future work will be required to explore these possibilities."
