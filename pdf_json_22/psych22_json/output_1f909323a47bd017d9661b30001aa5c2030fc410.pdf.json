    "abstractText": "The WHO recently included Gaming Disorder as a psychiatric diagnosis. Whether there are distinct groups of adolescents who differ based on severity of gaming disorder and their relationships with other mental health and addictive behavior outcomes, including problematic smartphone use (PSU), remains unclear. The current study explored and identified subtypes of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) severity and estimated the association between these subtypes and other disorders. Participants completed online questionnaires assessing the severity of IGD, PSU, depression, and anxiety during COVID-19. We conducted a latent class analysis of IGD symptoms among 1,305 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 15.2; male = 58.5%) from 11 secondary schools in Macao (SAR), China. Multinomial logistic regression estimated correlates of latent class membership and PSU. A 4-class model adequately described the sample subgroups. Classes were labeled as normative gamers (30.9%), occasional gamers (42.4%), problematic gamers (22.7%), and addictive gamers (4.1%). Relative to normative gamers, PSU severity, depression, and being male were significantly higher among problematic gamers, addictive gamers, and occasional gamers. Only problematic gamers showed significant positive associations with anxiety severity compared to the other groups. The study revealed the differences in severity of gaming disorder and its association with psychopathology outcomes. Application in screening for IGD and comorbidity is discussed.",

IGD impairs people\u2019s social, academic, and occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Macao Association for Internet Research, 2020; Petry et\u00a0al., 2015; Wichstr\u00f8m et\u00a0al., 2019), including poor relationships with peers or family (Dreier et\u00a0al., 2017; Hwang et\u00a0al., 2020; Schneider et\u00a0al., 2017; Strittmatter et\u00a0al., 2015; Sugaya et\u00a0al., 2019; Yang et\u00a0al., 2020) and lower academic performance (Hawi et\u00a0al., 2018; Ko et\u00a0al., 2020; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019).\nBecause of the ubiquity of the Internet and the easy access to mobile phones among youth, subsequently, their risk of internet-related behavioral problems also increased exponentially (Anderson & Jiang, 2018; Chia et\u00a0al., 2020; Geisel et\u00a0al., 2021). Around the globe, a recent meta-analysis (Stevens et\u00a0al., 2021) revealed a prevalence of gaming disorder was 3.1% worldwide. A high prevalence of Internet addition among youth in Asia were previously observed. The prevalence was 21.2% in Vietnam (Tran et\u00a0al., 2017), 21% in Philippines (Mak et\u00a0al., 2014), 20% in Korea (Ha et\u00a0al., 2006), 17.9% in Taiwan (Tsai et\u00a0al., 2009); 17.1% in Singapore (Mythily et\u00a0al., 2008), 16.4% in Hong Kong (Mak et\u00a0al., 2014), 14.1% in Malaysia (Mak et\u00a0al., 2014), 6.2% in Japan (Mak et\u00a0al., 2014), and 13% among adolescents in China (Yang et\u00a0al., 2020). Across Asia, children and adolescents in East Asian countries, such as China, reported the highest prevalence rates (Paulus et\u00a0al., 2018). The high prevalence of IGD among Chinese youth is concerning, particularly in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) context, children and adolescents spent most of their time at home using the Internet during the lockdown, and this might increase video game use and probable IGD (Teng et\u00a0al., 2021)."

            "text": "IGD demonstrates high comorbidity with PSU, in which the two problems share similar characteristics (Lin et\u00a0al., 2017). However, only IGD is classified as an addictive disorder in the psychiatric nosology. It is also difficult to disentangle the purpose of smartphone use whether it is to engage in gaming behavior or other activities (Montag et\u00a0al., 2021). Smartphones allow gamers to stay in touch with each other either within the game platform or through other gaming-related activities including social media, which is associated with greater IGD severity (King & Delfabbro, 2018). This relationship is also bidirectional such that some studies found that smartphone gaming is a risk factor for PSU (FischerGrote et\u00a0al., 2019; Jeong et\u00a0al., 2016).\nIGD is also associated or comorbid with other mental health problems, including depression (Liu et\u00a0 al., 2016; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2021), anxiety (Schou Andreassen et\u00a0al., 2016;\nWu et\u00a0al., 2018), and stress symptoms (Andreetta et\u00a0al., 2020; Yen et\u00a0al., 2019), which are considered as predictive factors of gaming-related behavior (Hyun et\u00a0al., 2015; Laconi et\u00a0al., 2017). Cross-sectional studies that adopted different measurements for gaming problems found positive association with depression (Gaming Addiction Scale; M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6 et\u00a0al., 2015) and anxiety (Problematic Videogame Playing; Fumero et\u00a0al., 2020) in adolescents. Symptoms of anxiety and depression before the pandemic predicted later IGD and videogame use (Teng et\u00a0al., 2021). IGD is also associated with psychiatric disorders in young people including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and alcohol misuse (Ho et\u00a0al., 2014) as well as illicit drug use (Sun et\u00a0al., 2012). Internet used as a coping strategy for psychiatric comorbidity may perpetuate IGD because young people suffering from IGD often avoid socialization with other people (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2018). IGD was found to affect sleep quality (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017) and lead to negative impact on health-related quality of life (Tran et\u00a0al., 2017) among adolescents in Asia.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has a vital impact on adolescents\u2019 mental health. Compared to Chinese adults, adolescents were more affected in the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak, and it showed higher impact on youth mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020a, 2020b). After one month of COVID-19 outbreak in China, Chinese adolescents were impacted more than before. This may be due to their long-term online study from home (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020a, 2020b). In a cross-sectional study conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak in China among adolescents from grade 7 to grade 12 and first year in university, Ren et\u00a0al. (2021) found that among them, the prevalence of anxiety was 28.3%, and 2.1% of them presented with severe anxiety, whereas the prevalence of depression was 30.8%, and 1.3% was severe. The comorbidity of anxiety and depression was also high, and estimated to be around 20.1% of the Chinese adolescents. With the increasing risk of psychopathology (e.g., depression and anxiety) and academic stress during COVID-19 (Cullen et\u00a0al., 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020), adolescents may be more susceptible to gaming-related behavior."

First, the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE) (Brand et\u00a0 al., 2016, 2019) suggests that core personal characteristics (e.g., psychopathology, biopsychological constitution), cognitive and affective responses to perceived situations, decision-making behavior about using a certain application, and the consequences of using it drives some people to excessively use the internet. When individuals experience high levels of depression and anxiety\n1 3\n(psychopathology factors), and high levels of stress (stimuli) trigger the cognitive and affective responses, they may be motivated to use certain applications more to gain gratification, which then reinforces more use. Second, Compensatory Internet Use Theory (Kardefelt-Winther, 2014) explains the underlying mechanism of how negative life events or negative emotion give rise to compensatory internet use, which helps to mitigate negative affect. Through the process of gratification-seeking, once an individual\u2019s internet use becomes excessive, negative consequences may lead to a higher degree of stabilization of psychopathology factors. In other words, in individuals who are experiencing depression, anxiety or stress, these negative emotions may motivate them, to seek an escape from their daily life struggles (Melodia et\u00a0al., 2020), by playing more Internet games in order to compensate for negative emotions. Once they gain gratification, those negative emotions may decrease, but it can result in more long-term negative outcomes."

It can also incorporate data from observed covariates to understand their correlation with latent class subgroup membership. LCA assumes that the structure of the observed multivariate data results from a categorical latent (class membership) variable.\nSeveral studies applied LCA among adolescents with IGD using different scales to measure the heterogeneity of IGD in terms of symptom endorsement severity. A 4-class model of latent classes of PVP (Problem Video Game Playing), which classified participants as \u201cSevere PVP\u201d (1.9%), \u201cHigh PVP\u201d (12.2%), \u201cLow PVP\u201d (36%), and \u201cNormative\u201d (50%) due to the lowest probabilities of PVP scale item endorsement in Canadian young people (Faulkner et\u00a0al., 2015).

The 3-class model had smaller BIC (11,208.103) and higher entropy (0.717) than the 4-class model (BIC = 11,233.042; entropy = 0.686); however, the 4-class model had smaller AIC (11,031.257) and SABIC (11,109.157).

(2015) our results identified Normative Gamers group who showed little or no IGD symptoms,\nProblematic Gamers group and Occasional Gamers group, which are two types of gamers with parallel symptom patterns but different severity, and the Addictive Gamers group, who reported the highest level of symptoms. When examining the differences closely across the four groups,\nNote. Class 2 = Addictive gamers; Class 3 = Occasional gamers; Class 4 = Problematic gamers; Reference group: Class 1 = Normative gamers; Statistically significant: p < .05\n1 3\nthe different level of loss of interest in other activities and unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce differentiate Addictive Gamers and Problematic Gamers. Consistent with Wichstr\u00f8m et\u00a0al. (2019)\u2019s findings, our study found that loss of interest might serve as a central symptom in the assessment of IGD and its related impairment. Gamers are usually fed with intensive and short-term stimuli which could engender gamers\u2019 quick gratification or pleasure at the present. Therefore, gamers are habituated to respond to only certain types of stimulations, meaning that their attention is actually trapped or narrowed down to a very limited and fixed area (Berardi, 2015), rather than deferring their immediate relief to explore other activities and think more deeply (Moore, 2018). Biologically, such a trap of attention or interest also hinders the development of new synaptic pathways in prefrontal cortex, which is a region crucial for learning (Lewis, 2015). As a result, the loss of interest makes it more difficult for gamers to create new neural connections and learn new knowledge. To differentiate clinically problematic gamers from other gamers, symptoms of withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce gaming are also suggested as potential symptoms or criteria in this study, which is also consistent with previous research among Norwegian youth (Wichstr\u00f8m et\u00a0al., 2019).\nProblematic Gamers showed higher probabilities of IGD symptoms than Occasional Gamers on all symptoms, especially in withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce gaming, despite their parallel patterns of IGD symptoms. Previous studies showed that these three symptoms were associated with gaming involvement (Wichstr\u00f8m et\u00a0al., 2019) and gaming-related negative outcomes (Colder\u00a0Carras & Kardefelt-Winther, 2018), including impairments in relationships and school achievement. This is consistent with the theory of psychosocial dislocation (Alexander, 2010) that those who are dislocated socially and psychologically depend heavily on certain activities to compensate their feelings of alienation or dislocation, even knowing that these activities are harmful to them.\nFurthermore, in addition to the symptom of loss of interest, withdrawal and tolerance were also important criteria in measuring IGD (Rehbein et\u00a0al., 2015). However, the current results did not suggest that withdrawal, tolerance, and unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce have a strong association with the Occasional Gamers. Since similar symptoms were found in other substance use or addictive behaviors, further studies on IGD assessment criteria of withdrawal are still needed (Kaptsis et\u00a0al., 2016). In current study, these three symptoms indicate that differences in the assessment of IGD also are important criteria for differentiating subgroups of IGD."

Greater internet social interaction had lower awareness of problematic gaming, and a higher level of problems related to mental health, whereas awareness of their IGD could be a protective factor against PSU (Cha & Seo, 2018; Colder\u00a0Carras et\u00a0al., 2017). However, these studies are limited to mobile gaming/social media. The current research extended the literature to IGD and showed PSU was significantly positively associated with all subgroups of gamers, relative to Normative Gamers. Among them, Problematic Gamers showed a strong relationship with PSU severity, which revealed a relationship between PSU and IGD severity. Previous studies (Fischer-Grote et\u00a0al., 2019; Jeong et\u00a0al., 2016) showed that gaming was the risk factor for PSU, whereas the current study supported an opposite direction, which might indicate the relationship between IGD and PSU is bidirectional.\nWe found that different subgroups of gamers were associated with different mental health problems during the pandemic when local in-person school suspension occurred. Depression and anxiety were associated with IGD (Schou Andreassen et\u00a0al., 2016; Wu et\u00a0al., 2018; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2021). Preexisting anxiety and depression before the COVID-19 pandemic predicted IGD severity during the pandemic (Teng et\u00a0al., 2021). Our results showed that compared with Normative Gamers, there was a significant positive association between all subgroups (especially Addictive Gamers) with depression severity. However, only Problematic Gamers showed significant positive association with anxiety severity compared to other subgroups of gamers. In other words, Problematic Gamers showed more PSU and anxiety symptoms whereas Addictive Gamers showed more depressive symptoms, which contradicted previous work that showed no associated between gaming symptoms and poorer mental health (Colder Carras & Kardefelt-Winther, 2018; Faulkner et\u00a0al., 2015). The result also revealed an inconsistent relationship between anxiety and IGD subgroups, in that anxiety symptoms were not a risk factor for Addictive Gamers (Wichstr\u00f8m et\u00a0al., 2019). These findings are in line with the I-PACE model (Brand et\u00a0al., 2016) and can be explained such that gamers experiencing higher levels of depression or anxiety (as psychopathological factors in I-PACE), and then played more games to gain more satisfaction and mitigate negative outcomes or emotions. Moreover, consistent with previous studies (Macur & Pontes, 2021; Su et\u00a0al., 2020),\n1 3\nour results indicate that male adolescents were more likely to participate in gaming behavior."

Second, causal relationships between the variables might not be inferred due to crosssectional design of the study. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the longitudinal relationships. Third, because of the differences between the diagnostic criteria of IGD established by the WHO and those by APA, the present study design might benefit from being repeated using assessment tools that include the framework of the APA and explore this concerning newly derived criteria in the WHO ICD-11, for instance with the Gaming Disorder Test, which is also readily available in Chinese language (Pontes et\u00a0al., 2021). Although there are overlaps when diagnosing Gaming Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder according to the WHO/APA, applying both framework in the same sample also led to differences in prevalence (Montag, Lachmann, et\u00a0al., 2019; Montag, Schivinski, et\u00a0al., 2019).\nEvidence-based interventions could be used to address IGD in the digital age and during COVID-19. Cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) was found efficacious in reducing IGD symptoms and factors associated with IGD (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms), with moderate to large effect sizes (Stevens et\u00a0al., 2019). Digital interventions (e.g., internet-based CBT; iCBT) delivered through mobile app or the Internet could be an\u00a0ideal clinical practice due to the increasing use of telehealth therapy during the pandemic. Thus, the use of the Internet and socialization through the Internet is more frequent than before. Evidence from previous studies on digital or internet CBT showed that technology-supported CBT can effectively improve the psychopathological factors associated with IGD such as level of anxiety and depression (Ho et\u00a0al., 2020), maladaptive coping skills (Ho et\u00a0al., 2020), and sleep-related issues such as insomnia (Soh et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, the delivery of CBT through the Internet or smartphone is low-cost and easy to access with minimal geographical constraints. Clinical professionals could provide CBT content through a learning platform to people with IGD in educational settings (Zhang & Ho, 2017a, 2017b). Furthermore, virtual reality therapy was found effective, although it requires the use of screens and devices, such as virtual machines (Zhang & Ho, 2017a, 2017b). To conclude, digital evidence-based interventions are low-cost and effective to reduce IGD and mood symptoms in people with IGD and, therefore, promising to address mental health problems in the midst of COVID-19 (Sit et\u00a0al., 2021)."

Moreover, continued mental health support is needed in school settings, and interventions need to be developed to address digital-related behavioral addition, especially among male adolescents.
