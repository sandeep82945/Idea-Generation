Conclusion: CAT-GSH appears an acceptable (but challenging) approach for PWPs to deliver in IAPT services. Services should prioritise training and supervision for PWPs to ensure good governance of delivery.",

            "text": "Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services have been contributing to the expanding provision of psychological treatment for common mental health problems across England since 2008 (National Health Service, 2019; Mental Health Taskforce, 2016). As recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2009, 2011), IAPT services operate within a stepped-care model. A key feature therefore is effective low-intensity interventions being offered at step 2 in the first instance of care (Care Services and Improvement Partnership Choice and Access Team, 2008). These brief, psychoeducational and low-intensity interventions are intended for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression and are delivered by psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs). Whilst clinical guidelines emphasise the importance of offering patients a choice of treatments (Care Services and Improvement Partnership Choice and Access Team, 2008; National Collaborating\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCentre for Mental Health, 2018; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2011), treatment at step 2 is wholly limited to cognitive behavioural therapy guided self-help (CBT-GSH; Clark, 2011).\nCognitive analytic therapy (CAT; Ryle, 1995) is an integrative therapy which supports clients to understand, recognise and then revise habitual, unhelpful and restrictive patterns of relating to themselves and others (Ryle and Kerr, 2002). CAT is typically delivered in complex clinical populations (Hallam et al., 2021). Calvert and Kellett (2014) specifically suggested the development of a low-intensity version of CAT to enable the delivery of the model with mildto-moderate common mental health problems. Therefore, Meadows and Kellett (2017) developed a manualised psychoeducational version of cognitive analytic therapy guided selfhelp (CAT-GSH), designed to be fit-for-purpose for delivery at step 2 of IAPT services. CAT is usually delivered in an 8-, 16- or 24-session (60-minute sessions) contract (Ryle and Kerr, 2002), whereas CAT-GSH is delivered in 6\u20138 sessions (35-minute sessions) (Meadows and Kellett, 2017). The structure of CAT-GSH follows the established reformulation, recognition and revision approach of the high-intensity version, but the language is adapted to enable ease of understanding (e.g. reciprocal roles being termed relationship roles) and is underpinned by a structured session-by-session workbook. The emphasis during CAT-GSH is on guided selfhelp, with the PWP supporting the client to work through the structured workbook exercises (Shafran et al., 2021). Table 1 contains a summary of the theoretical concepts of CAT (drawn from Taylor et al., 2017) and whether the theoretical concepts were or were not present in the CAT-GSH. Table 2 contains a summary of the tools of CAT (drawn from Taylor et al., 2017) and whether the tools were or were not present in the CAT-GSH. Although evidence reviews and meta-analyses index the effectiveness and acceptability of CAT, they have also highlighted the need to continue expanding its evidence base in relation to acceptability, effectiveness and efficacy issues (Calvert and Kellett, 2014; Hallam et al., 2021; Ryle et al., 2014).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nMeadows and Kellett\u2019s (2017) initial pilot of CAT-GSH reported promising clinical outcomes, including similar effect sizes and smaller drop-out rates compared with CBT-GSH. To assess feasibility, two approaches were adopted. Firstly, three clinical psychologists rated the intervention positively in relation to Cape\u2019s (2015) GSH quality criterion: scope, evidence, engagement and promotion of self-efficacy. Secondly, PWPs (n=7) were interviewed about their experience of delivery. Several positive and negative themes related to the content and experience of CAT-GSH emerged from these data: positively, the usefulness of the manual, the treatment as a journey, job role satisfaction and patient engagement; negatively, the increased time demands, the treatment suitability for both clients and PWPs and the timeconsuming nature of the \u2018psychotherapy file\u2019 (Association for Cognitive Analytic Therapy, 2007). As a result, relevant modifications to the manual were made and the authors recommended further development, implementation and evaluation of CAT-GSH. A largescale partially randomised patient preference trial (PRPPT) is subsequently being conducted in an IAPT service to compare the efficacy and clinical durability of CAT-GSH compared with CBT-GSH for anxiety (Kellett et al., 2021). Participants are allocated to 6\u20138 (35-minute) sessions of CAT-GSH or CBT-GSH based on their preference or randomisation if they do not state a preference. The psychotherapy file has been dropped from the intervention based on the feasibility findings (Meadows and Kellett, 2017).\nThe importance of valuing the role of a PWP in order to improve retention and reduce potential burnout and stress has been previously recognised (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2018; Shepherd and Rosairo, 2008). Despite this, there is limited qualitative research exploring the experiences of PWPs themselves in relation to their experience of the feasibility of the brief, guided self-help interventions they are expected to deliver safely and effectively to large caseloads. To fully evaluate the acceptability of implementing CAT-GSH as a step 2 treatment, it is therefore important to consider the experiences of delivery by PWPs. Sekhon et al. (2017) defined treatment acceptability as \u2018a multifaceted construct that reflects the extent to which people delivering or receiving an intervention consider it to be appropriate, based on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the intervention\u2019 (p. 1). Therefore, important aspects of the evaluation of the acceptability of an intervention are practitioners\u2019 affective attitudes, the perceived burden of delivery, the coherence of the intervention and the opportunity costs of not delivering another intervention\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n(Sekhon et al., 2017). Interventions with poor acceptability with practitioners are unlikely to be adopted into routine practice. The current project therefore aimed to qualitatively explore the experiences of PWPs delivering CAT-GSH at step 2 in comparison with their experiences of delivering CBT-GSH as treatment as usual. The primary questions of this evaluation were therefore: how did PWPs experience delivering CAT-GSH? How did this experience compare with that of delivering CBT-GSH? How did broader service-level factors influence PWPs\u2019 experience of delivering CAT-GSH?"

The protocol for the PRPPT has been published and describes the method of the trial and the planned analyses (Kellett et al., 2021). All PWPs in the service treated patients in the trial and there was no selection of trial PWPs. In short, the PRPPT evaluates the clinical outcomes (including 8- and 24-week follow-up) for four groups: (1) allocated to CAT-GSH based on choice, (2) randomly allocated to CAT-GSH, (3) allocated to CBT-GSH based on choice and (4) randomly allocated to CBT-GSH. In terms of a preliminary analysis of outcomes, the IAPT defined moving to recovery rate (i.e. patients whose scores on GAD-7 and/or PHQ-9 were above caseness on either measure before GSH whose scores on both measures were below caseness at end of GSH were as follows: 52.7% for CBT-GSH and 45.6 % for CAT-GSH (\u03c72=0.820, p=.365). Therefore, there was no difference between CBT-GSH and CAT-GSH in terms of the moving to recovery rates achieved by each of the low-intensity therapies. Prior to the interviews, participants were asked to read a participant information sheet and were given the chance to ask any questions before providing informed consent to participate. Data were anonymised in full and no personally identifiable information is contained within this report."

The PWPs initially attended a 2-day training course on CAT-GSH and continued to receive monthly 2-hour group supervision to support the delivery of CAT-GSH, alongside the required clinical and case management supervision. Supervision was matched for CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH participants. Table 3 provides a session-by-session summary of CAT-GSH, and the workbook can be found here: https://pearlsresearchlab.group.shef.ac.uk/resources.\nTwelve PWPs (all female, with an average age of 30.72 years) were recruited via volunteer sampling (i.e. a sample size suitable for small-scale qualitative projects; Braun and Clarke, 2013). The PWP sample had been qualified and practising as PWPs for an average of 4.50\u00b1 5.01 years (mean\u00b1SD). The average number of CAT-GSH participants treated in the trial by an individual PWP was 10.00\u00b17.09 (mean\u00b1SD) and the average number of CBT-GSH participants treated in the trial by an individual PWP was 3.50\u00b14.34 (mean\u00b1SD). Adverts were emailed to all PWPs working in the service and further brought to their attention during group supervision and team meetings. PWPs who wished to participate contacted the researcher (A.W.) to arrange a telephone interview. This sampling method was used to give PWPs the opportunity to decide whether they would like to take part or not, thus resulting in participants who were willing to contribute their experiences. To meet inclusion criteria, participants were required to be qualified PWPs with past or present experience of delivering both CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH as step 2 treatments within the PRPPT. To allow for a diverse\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsample of PWPs, no other inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied.

TA was selected as it facilitates a detailed and meaningful account of qualitative data by capturing patterns within the responses and organising these into prevalent themes (Braun and Clarke, 2006). A trainee clinical psychologist (C.M.) independently coded 25% of transcripts. The findings were checked against the lead researcher\u2019s (A.W.) initial codes and preliminary themes to arrive at consensually agreed final themes and sub-themes. Research supervision and peer debriefing were subsequently sought to allow for additional reflection and triangulation of the interpretations (Long and Johnson, 2000). The themes and sub-themes were summarised into a draft conceptual map. Daley (2004) stated that the advantages of conceptual maps of qualitative results are: (1) being able to show the inter-relationships between themes, (2) being able to summarise hierarchical relationships between themes and (3) reducing the volume of data. The conceptual map sought to show the relationships between themes, rather than using a cluster or word frequency approach (Conceicao et al., 2017)."

            "text": "This research was completed within a critical realism framework, recognising that there is a reality to the PWPs\u2019 experiences, whilst also critically reflecting on the context in which this reality has been constructed within. Each PWP is assumed to have their own unique experiences and meanings attached to delivering CAT-GSH, and this is interpreted by the researcher to construct a collective narrative of the experience of delivering CAT-GSH. To that end, it is important to acknowledge the context, experiences and perspectives of the participants and researchers. For example, the participants and the researchers work within NHS psychological services and will therefore be aware of the challenges people can face in accessing psychological therapy and also making an informed choice about the style or type of therapy they wished to receive. As such, the participants and researchers may have been drawn towards more favourable and positive narratives around CAT-GSH, due to the assumption that offering this form of GSH improved choice and better supported patient preference. Swift et al. (2021) highlighted that accommodating patient preferences was ethically correct and this may have therefore influenced how PWPs saw the CAT-GSH intervention. Although the lead researcher (A.W.) was not directly involved in the initial development of CAT-GSH, the PRPPT or the supervision of the PWPs, she did work within a team of researchers very closely involved in all these processes, and this may have influenced the reporting of positive themes around CAT-GSH. The lead researcher had a positive attitude towards CAT and some clinical experience of the model, but had not formally trained in the model. Efforts were made to remain reflexive throughout the research process. For example, the lead researcher (A.W.) kept a diary to log reflections, thoughts, feelings and key decisions regarding the data collection and analysis (Long and Johnson, 2000). Supervision and peer debriefing also encouraged the critical reflection of the different ways that the data may be understood (Long and Johnson, 2000).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

These themes are conceptually presented in Fig. 1 and with supporting verbatim quotations below. Using a thematic map (Daley, 2004), Fig. 1 illustrates how different elements of the PWPs\u2019 experiences were inter-related and interdependent. As represented by the connecting links, certain experiences of delivering CAT-GSH described by the PWPs are assumed to be dependent on (i.e. have a hierarchical relationship with) their understanding and experiences of other elements of CAT-GSH. For example, without an understanding of the past-present focus of CAT-GSH (and the associated need for working with clients\u2019 pasts using the approach), the PWPs\u2019 understanding of the CAT model and approach would have been experienced differently. This would also have significant implications for both offering treatment choice to clients and also the personal and professional development of PWPs that CAT-GSH was perceived to offer them as IAPT lowintensity practitioners.\nTheme 1 The past-present focus of CAT-GSH\nAll of the PWPs talked about the past-present focus of CAT-GSH and how this affected their experiences of delivering CAT-GSH."

For example, six PWPs reflected that the early reformulatory focus of CAT-GSH meant that change work\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nparticularly occurred later on in treatment (i.e. during the revision stage). This seemed to lead to some frustrations for some of the PWPs: \u2018One of the frustrations I always had in the beginning was that I found with CAT it felt like it was dragging its feet, you spent four sessions going over the past : : : I felt like I was holding people back\u2019 [participant (P) 8].\nWhilst there was a consensus that the more concrete changes were observed later on in CAT-GSH as is consistent with the reformulation, recognition and revision structure, most PWPs talked about their experiences of clients making different types of change during CAT-GSH particularly due to its past-present focus and approach. These changes were often proceeded by insight. For example, five PWPs talked about a \u2018light bulb moment\u2019 occurring (P1, P2, P3, P10, P11) when clients suddenly developed insight and awareness into their problematic patterns during early reformulatory sessions: \u2018I\u2019ve noticed it [the light bulb moment] the most after session two, where you start to talk about relationship roles and identify where that pattern might have-have come from, clients seem to really click with that\u2019 (P1). It seemed that once PWPs had adjusted their expectations of client change to be based more on insight and awareness, that this was a \u2018rewarding\u2019 (P10) experience for them as practitioners."

PWPs talked about feeling worried with regard to how to respond appropriately to disclosures, something that was heightened by the brief nature of CAT-GSH.

            "text": "This research was conducted with the aim of evaluating the acceptability of CAT-GSH through exploring PWPs\u2019 experience of delivering the psychoeducational self-help intervention, particularly in relation to how this compared with their experiences of delivering CBT-GSH and how broader service-level factors impacted their perceptions of acceptability. The TA conducted identified five prevailing themes suggesting elements of CAT-GSH acceptability, but also with some elements needing further consideration. CAT-GSH emerged as a lowintensity intervention that was distinct from CBT-GSH in terms of approach, pace and content and that this form of GSH was challenging initially to learn and deliver. Nevertheless,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ndeeper therapeutic relationships were enabled (also a theme in Meadows and Kellett, 2017), with the slower pace of change being in line with the reformulation, recognition and revision structure of the approach (Ryle and Kerr, 2002). The ability to fit the intervention into the extant time frame for a step 2 intervention (also a theme in Meadows and Kellett, 2017) and the emotional impact of hearing more about troubled pasts were the more burdensome aspects of the intervention. In terms of the treatment acceptability criteria of Sekhon et al. (2017), the PWPs had generally positive affective attitudes, believed the CAT-GSH particularly supported patient choice and was a theoretically coherent low-intensity approach, but also found the approach as imposing a high burden of delivery due to its explicit past-present focus. Strategies were employed throughout this evaluation to help maintain a critically reflexive stance (e.g. all 15 criteria for a \u2018good\u2019 TA were considered as fulfilled, reinforcing the rigour and credibility of the qualitative analysis; Braun and Clarke, 2006).\nIn line with guidance that suggests services should be offering a choice of low-intensity psychological treatments for anxiety and depression (Care Services and Improvement Partnership Choice and Access Team, 2008; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2018; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009; 2011), PWPs were very supportive of expanding treatment options at step 2. Whilst therapies offered at step 3 of IAPT have usefully diversified (Wakefield et al., 2020), this diversification has frustratingly not been mirrored at step 2. Participants therefore highlighted the positive and empowering impact expansion of choice creates for both clients and practitioners. In general, PWPs thought that CAT-GSH could offer this choice. The exploratory and relational aspects of CAT (Ryle, 1995; Ryle and Kerr, 2002) were discussed as facilitators of strong therapeutic relationships and mechanisms of important change. The highly collaborative nature of CAT (Ryle, 1995; Ryle and Kerr, 2002) was also recognised in positive accounts of working alongside clients. This was also mirrored in relationships with colleagues in the supervision group. Previous research has similarly highlighted how the development of a \u2018shared CAT language\u2019 with colleagues can help to create a sense of professional collaboration and understanding (Thompson et al., 2008).\nThe more exploratory style of CAT-GSH, requiring PWPs to facilitate discussions around clients\u2019 histories, seemed to particularly differ from their experiences of CBT-GSH, with its explicit here and now focus (Worrell et al., 2018). This appeared to initially contribute to some experiences of anxiety and uncertainty among the PWPs, but also facilitated sudden and key moments of insight for clients. Furthermore, the psychoeducation resource of the highly structured client workbook seemed to help to scaffold and contain PWPs\u2019 initial anxieties. Such anxieties may have been understandable due to the training of PWPs strongly emphasising adherence to the \u2018here and now\u2019 focus of the low-intensity CBT approach (University College London, 2015). The early reformulatory sessions in CAT-GSH clearly invited disclosures which could also be upsetting and anxiety-provoking for the PWPs to hear and manage. This experience seemed to be intensified by the existing constraints, dilemmas and pressures of working as a PWP in the fast paced, low-contact and high-volume step 2 approach of IAPT services (Shepherd and Rosairo, 2008; Westwood et al., 2017). It may have been the case that some of these reported challenges of providing CAT-GSH may have also been a reflection of the context being a clinical trial. Despite these challenges, many PWPs acknowledged that their understanding of, and confidence in delivering CAT-GSH developed with time, practice and support. Worrell et al. (2018) noted the challenges and advantages of helping IAPT CBT therapists to appreciate the contribution made by approaches other than CBT. Clearly, broader service-level factors such as the facilitation of collaborative group supervision, enabled the sharing of good practice, the validation of difficult experiences and access to peer support also influenced the perception of the acceptability of the intervention.\nIn terms of limitations, the following are of note. As the PWPs included in this research were mostly female and were recruited using volunteer sampling methods from one IAPT service, their\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1352465822000194 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nexperiences of learning and delivering CAT-GSH may not be representative of all PWPs working across different IAPT services. The sample size could have been larger and is doubtful whether a sample of n=12 is sufficient to achieve data saturation. Moreover, the study could have adopted a more mixed methods approach and been supplemented with a questionnaire measure of acceptability (Sekhon et al., 2017). For example, the Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire (Hunsley, 1992). There was a risk of sampling bias as the PWPs may have volunteered to take part because of particular motivations to contribute their views. The semi-structured interview protocol enabled the PWPs to talk about their experience of CAT-GSH, but there were no direct questions as to what they believed their patients\u2019 experience of the GSH were. Also, in relation to the schedule no piloting occurred and neither was there any updating of the topic guide on the basis of early interviews. The research team were not aware at the time of conducting the study that Braun and Clarke (2006) qualitative guidance had been recently updated (Braun and Clarke, 2021). The conceptual map (Daley, 2004) was not shared with the participants to check the validity of the inter-relationships that were conceptualised.\nTo conclude, this study sought to explore the acceptability of CAT-GSH by understanding the views of the PWPs delivering this low-intensity intervention in IAPT in regard to whether it was possible, how they felt about it and what the impediments to delivery were. CAT-GSH is clearly different to deliver than CBT-GSH, despite the similarity of psychoeducational purpose, approach and delivery method (Shafran et al., 2021). Generally, CAT-GSH emerged as an acceptable lowintensity approach, as PWPs felt that it offered choice, enabled the therapeutic relationship and was a highly collaborative therapeutic endeavour. Challenges included the past-present focus of CAT-GSH, as well as the time taken to implement the intervention in the context of busy clinical services and the PWP role. Final recommendations are contingent on the final and full reporting of outcomes from the PRPPT. Services and researchers need to continue to collaborate to expand and evaluate patient preferences.\nSupplementary material.
