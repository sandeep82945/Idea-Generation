    "abstractText": "The regularities of chromatographic retention and separation enantioselectivity of the selected \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, pindolol, alprenolol, atenolol, oxprenalol, metoprolol, clenbuterol, sotalol, pronethalol, salbutamol, and labetalol) were studied with eight chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in polar ionic mode (PIM) elution system. A range of novel CSPs was prepared by immobilisation of macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotic eremomycin (E-CSP); structurally related antibiotics chloreremomycin (Chloro-E-CSP) and semi-synthetic oritavancin (O-CSP); and five eremomycin derivatives including amide(Amide-E-CSP), adamantyl-2-amide(Adamantylamide-E-CSP), eremomycin aglycon (EAg-CSP), eremosaminyl eremomycin aglycon (EEA-CSP), and des-eremosamynyl eremomycin (DEE-CSP) onto microspherical silica (Kromasil, particle size 5 micron, pore size 11 nm). The effect of different functional groups in eremomycin structure on chiral recognition of \u03b2-blockers was studied. The original E-CSP revealed moderate enantioseparation for all studied \u03b2-blockers. The presence of a free carboxylic group in a chiral selector molecule is found to be critical for the general retention of enantiomers as no separation enantioselectivity was recorded for Amide-E-CSP and Adamantyl-E-CSP. Modification of the aromatic system of eremomycin by the introduction of a chlorosubstituent in the aromatic ring (Chloro-E-CSP) or a hydrophobic 4\u2019-chlorobiphenylmethyl substituent to the disaccharide sugar residue (O-CSP) resulted in decreased enantioselectivity. The best enantioseparation of \u03b2-blockers was obtained for CSPs with eremosaminyl eremomycin aglycon and des-eremosamynyl eremomycin as chiral selectors.",

Introduction\nBeta-blockers or \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists are an important class of organic substances which are widely used to reduce the blood pressure of patients with corresponding cardiovascular diseases. The major structural fragment in typical \u03b2-blockers is aryloxypropanolamine (see Table 1) containing at least one chiral centre. It is known that only one enantiomer of beta blockers exhibits pharmaceutical activity, so only half of a racemic active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is effective and the rest is considered inactive, but not an absolutely non-harmful component. At present, commercially available \u03b2-blockers are sold as racemic mixtures except for very few, e.g., timolol [1]. Enantioseparation of APIs and preparative isolation of all possible isomers is a significant part of biomedical testing required for the medical approval of drugs. Determination of the optical purity of APIs at the production stage is also of great importance as optical isomers of one substance can produce diverse effects on humans. The application of various techniques including capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) [2], capillary electrochromatography (CEC) [3], supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) [4], gas chromatography (GC [5], and thin layer chromatography (TLC) [6] have been reported for enantioseparation of\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020373 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 2 of 15\n\u03b2-blockers. However, enantioselective or chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is commonly used for the separation and determination of optical isomers. The most practical separation of enantiomers includes the use of chiral stationary phases (CSPs) with immobilised substrates or chiral selectors, which can interact differently with optical isomers and provide so-called chiral recognition of enantiomers. There is a large number of CSPs designed for the enantioseparation of various groups of substances. This is due to an enormous number of APIs with different chemical structures, so there is no universal CSP allowing enantioseparation of all possible types of racemic drugs [7]. The majority of \u03b2-blockers have aryloxypropanolamine fragment in their structure with the chiral centre at the OH-substituted carbon, while maximum pharmaceutical activity is associated with the S configuration. The structures and properties of \u03b2-blockers studied in this work are summarised in Table 1. The application of various types of CSPs for the enantioseparation of beta-blockers has been recently reviewed [8]. According to the literature, good enantioselectivity and peak resolutions for beta-blockers have been reported for CSPs with immobilised polysaccharides [9], proteins [10], \u03b2-cyclodextrin [11], crown-ethers [12], Pirkle-type selectors [13], macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotics [14\u201316], and many others.\nTable 1.

Synthesis of Des-Eremosaminyl Eremomycin\nThree grams of eremomycin were dissolved in 40 mL of 1 M HCl. The solution was heated at 70 \u25e6C for 40 min. The resultant mixture was cooled down to room temperature and neutralised with 1M NaOH solution. The obtained des-eremosaminyl eremomycin (DEE) was purified by preparative HPLC using a 250 \u00d7 24 mm ID column packed with Diasorb-130-S16T stationary phase (particle size 8 \u00b5m, JSC BioChemMack S&T, Moscow, Russia) and a 5% aqueous solution of isopropanol with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as an eluent at a flow rate of 23 mL/min. The resultant product was lyophilised. The product yield was 13.3% (400 mg). The des-eremosaminyl eremomycin purity was 95% (HPLC data, see Section 2.3.2.).\n2.1.2. Synthesis of Eremosaminyl Aglycon of Eremomy in and Eremomycin Aglycon\nSynthesis of eremosaminyl aglycon of eremomycin (EEA) and eremomycin aglyco (EAg) erformed simultaneously. For this, 3.28 g of eremomycin was dissolved in 65 mL of concentrated HCl nd cooled down to 4 \u25e6C for four hours. Following the\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 6 of 15\ncompletion of hydrolysis, the mixture was neutralised using dry sodium carbonate and diluted with deionised water to 1 L until a precipitate that was formed at the initial stage of the neutralisation process was dissolved. Purification and separation of target products was performed by preparative HPLC using a 250 \u00d7 24 mm ID column packed with Diasorb130-S16T stationary phase (particle size 8 \u00b5m) and a 10% aqueous solution of isopropanol with 1% acetic acid as an eluent at a flow rate of 23 mL/min. The resultant product was lyophilized and 0.85 g of eremosaminyl eremomycin aglycon (98% purity, HPLC data) and 1.2 g of eremomycin aglycon (92% purity, HPLC data) were obtained. For HPLC conditions see Section 2.3.2. Structures of all products synthesised in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 were confirmed using mass spectrometry. The spectra demonstrated corresponding masses of eremomycin (1557), des-eremosaminyl eremomycin (1414), eremosaminyl aglycon (1252), and eremomycin aglycon (1109). Additionally, these spectra (Supplementary Materials, Figures S1\u2013S4) show the presence of sodium and potassium salts of these compounds, as well as products of partial degradation of the samples during the experiment. These admixtures contain mainly compounds, which cannot interfere with the immobilisation of target chiral selectors onto the silica surface.\n2.2. Synthesis of Chiral Phases\nAll studied CSPs were prepared by using a two-step immobilisation reaction as described in detail in previous works of the authors [30,31,33]. In essence, the synthesis included activation of the silica surface with 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane followed by treatment with an aqueous solution of antibiotics under mild conditions. Upon completion of the reaction, the resultant precipitate was decanted and washed with water, ethanol, and acetone, then filtered and air dried. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and elemental analysis were used to prove the covalent attachment of glycopeptide antibiotics to silica and the bonding chemistry of CSPs. The corresponding data can be found in our previous publication [30].\n2.3. Chromatographic Experiments 2.3.1. Columns and Equipment\nThe HPLC system used for separation studies comprised a gradient pump (Smartline 1000), an optical detector (Smartline 2500 UV-Vis), and an injector valve with a 10 \u00b5L loop (all Knauer GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Eurochrom software (also Knauer GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used for data processing.\n2.3.2. Materials and Consumables\nAll solvents were of chromatographic grade purity and included acetonitrile, methanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, and ethanol (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). Amino acid standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA, USA). Deionised water (18 M\u2126/cm) from the Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for the preparation of solutions and eluents. Chemical purity and concentration of macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotics in reaction mixtures (Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2) were determined by reversed-phase HPLC using a 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm ID column packed with 5 \u00b5m Kromasil-100-C18 (Nouryon, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden). The column was initially equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (Solvent A). Linear gradient elution from 5% to 25% of acetonitrile (Solvent B) was applied over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and room temperature. Detection of chromatographic peaks was performed at 280 nm.\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Sselection of the Eluent\nCSPs with eremomycin and their derivatives have been widely used for enantioseparation of different substances including amino acids [15,26,30,35]; their benzyloxycarbonyl-\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 7 of 15\n(CBZ), benzoyl-, tert-butyloxycarbonyl- (BOC) derivatives [36]; 2-phenylpropionic acid derivatives known as profens [31,33,37]; \u03b1-hydroxy acids [33,38]; pyrroloquinolones [39], chemotherapy drug pemetrexed [40], and others. Significantly less has been reported on the enantioseparation of \u03b2-blockers using this subclass of CSPs. Bosakova et al. [19] studied enantioseparation of propranolol, atenolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol, and pindolol (see structures in Figure 1) with Chirobiotic V and Chirobiotic V2 columns containing different amounts of bonded vancomycin. Separation of all enantiomers of studied \u03b2-blockers was obtained under conditions of reversed-phase and polar organic HPLC modes. In the reversed-phase mode, the retention of \u03b2-blockers increased with an increase of methanol concentration in the eluent for both of the above CSPs. Optimal separations were observed when 90% methanol with 0.5% triethylammonium acetate at pH 5 was used as an eluent; however, in this case, separation was achieved in 30 to 60 min. Under equal separation conditions, \u03b2-blockers were retained for a longer period on a column with a higher concentration of vancomycin in the stationary phase, but as the amount of methanol in the eluent increased this difference in retention levelled out. The higher concentration of immobilised vancomycin provided a stronger retention of beta-blockers due to an increased number of binding sites providing stronger hydrogen bonding for Chirobiotic V2, but this difference levelled out at high methanol contents in the eluent. Additionally, under otherwise same conditions, a higher concentration of vancomycin on the surface of the stationary phase leads to higher separation enantioselectivity and improved peak shape of all \u03b2-blockers. In pure methanol (polar organic HPLC mode) \u03b2-blockers enantiomers do not elute within 70 min, but with the addition of triethylamine and acetic acid, the experiment time is significantly reduced, to 20 min. However, high concentrations of these additives result in the worsening of the separation. The best chromatograms with enantioselectivity \u03b1 = 1.08\u20131.12 were obtained with a low concentration of the aforementioned additives to the eluent (see Table 2).\nHashem et al. investigated the enantioseparation of salbutamol with Chirobiotic V column and 100% methanol containing a varied concentration of ammonium acetate [41]. The enantioselectivity increased with decreasing salt content in the eluent, and baseline separation of enantiomers was achieved in 20 min at a concentration of 2.5 mM. The separation of albuterol enantiomers was studied on an E-CSP column (250 \u00d7 4 mm, particle size 5 \u00b5m) [23] in a polar organic mode. The authors reported an increase in enantioselectivity with an increase in acetonitrile content in methanol-based eluent, with peak resolution (RS) remaining constant. The resolution of enantiomer peaks increased with decreasing acid and amine concentrations in the eluent, while the best resolution was obtained in methanol\u2013acetonitrile\u2013triethylamine\u2013acetic acid (80:20:0.075:0.025) mixture as\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 8 of 15\nthe eluent. The Rs value improved slightly, up to 1.0, with a decrease in flow rate from 1.0 to 0.5 mL/min. Microspherical polystyrene-divinylbenzene macroporous particles with eremomycinstabilised gold nanoparticles (Eremo@GNP@PS-DVB) demonstrated improved enantioseparation of pindolol as compared with eremomycin bonded silica (E-CSP) [42]. The baseline separation with \u03b1 = 1.5 of enantiomers was obtained in polar organic mode with 100% methanol containing 0.1% TEAA as an eluent. Probably the changes in eremomycin conformation on GNP surface are favourable for enantioseparation [43]. Thus, according to the literature, the separations of \u03b2-blockers are the most selective in a polar organic mode of HPLC. Both vancomycin and eremomycin-containing CSPs demonstrated superior enantioselectivity in methanol with added ammonium acetate or triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) at low (0.05\u20130.5%) concentrations. A dilution of methanol-based eluent with acetonitrile increased the retention of \u03b2-blockers. Based on this analysis of the literature 100% methanol containing 0.1% TEAA was selected as the initial eluent in this study. However, very weak or no retention was observed for \u03b2-blockers in the eluent, so 50% methanol\u201350% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TEAA eluent was used instead. The obtained results for E-CSP, Chloro-E-CSP, Amide-E-CSP, O-CSP, DEE-CSP, and EAg-CSP including retention factors, enantioselectivity, and resolution of enantiomer peaks are summarised in Table 3.

Retention of \u03b2-Blockers on CSPs\nOften in chiral liquid chromatography, the retention of \u03b2-blockers and separation selectivity of enantiomers can be connected to a certain type of CSP. Typically, this occurs if one of the three interactions required for chiral recognition of enantiomers is dominant. For this reaso , the depe de ces of retention factors (k\u2019) on hydrophobicity measure as logP were checked for E-CSP s a standard stationary phase for comparison. As expected, no c rrelation was observed in polar orga ic mode when 100% organic solvent containing mobile phase was used in combin tion with a relatively hydrophilic stationary phase. EAgCSP with removed saccharide residu s from eremomycin should be the most hydrophobic among studied CSPs. However, no visible correlation between k\u2019 and logP was observed. All studied \u03b2-blockers are cations due to the protonation of the secondary aminogroup having pK between 9.4 and 10.7 (Table 1). This group is located in the beta-\nosition relatively chiral centre, so it must be inv lved in chiral recognition via electrostatic int raction with th carboxylic group marked as A (Figure 1) in the molecule of eremomycin. In this work, Amide-E-CSP and Adamantylamide-E-CSP had carboxylic groups converted into amido-groups, which are neutral. As the r sult, Amide-E-CSP demonstrated the lowest ability to retain \u03b2-blo kers. Adam ntylamide-E-CSP provided stronger retention of analytes, ut as expected neither CSPs showed any enantioselectivity for the studied racemates (Table 3). The role of hydrogen bonding in the retention of \u03b2-blockers can be evaluated by comparison of retention factors obtained with 100% methanol and 50% methanol\u201350% acetonitrile as eluents. Aprotic acetonitrile is less competitive for hydrogen bonding sites in CSPs, so the retention of \u03b2-blockers should be stronger with the latter eluent. In truth, all \u03b2-blockers retained stronger on EAg-CSP with acetonitrile containing eluent. The ratio k\u20192(50% methanol\u201450% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TEAA)/k\u20192(100% methanol containing 0.1% TEAA) has values between 1.82 and 2.04 for the studied \u03b2-blockers. Interestingly, O-CSP with an additional 4-chlorodiphenylmethyl- group and Chloro-ECSP with chloro- substituent in an aromatic ring exhibited lower retention of \u03b2-blockers. Obviously, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions do not contribute strongly to the retention of these substances. A similar effect was noted for the Chirobitic V column with immobilised vancomycin as shown in Table 2. There is no clear correlation between retention and enantioselectivity established for the studied CSPs. For example, labetalol is strongly retained by EAg-CSP without reasonable enantioseparation. At the same time, a good enantioselectivity and resolution\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 12 of 15\nof peaks are observed for E-CSP in less than 20 min (see Figure 4). However, according to the chromatographic theory, the retention time impacts strongly on the resolution of chromatographic peaks proportionally k\u20192/(k\u20192 +1), so, in this work, only the use of a weaker eluent 50% methanol\u201350% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TEAA allowed better resolution of \u03b2-blockers peaks.\n3.3. Enantioselectivity of CSPs\nStandard E-CSP column demonstrated weak enantioselectivity in the separation of \u03b2-blockers with an incomplete resolution of chromatographic peaks for all studied \u03b2blockers (Figure 3). As previously mentioned, no enantioselectivity was obtained for amide type stationary phases Amide-E-CSP and Adamantylamide-E-CSP due to the conversion of a charged carboxyl group into a neutral amide. A simple introduction of the chlorosubstituent in aromatic ring 3 of eremomycin resulted in absence of any enantioselectivity for the corresponding Chloro-E-CSP as compared to E-CSP. This effect has no clear explanation, but it confirms that the chiral recognition takes place in the corresponding basket of eremomycin for all blockers except clenbuterol and labetalol. It should be noted that labetalol has two asymmetric carbon atoms, so it exists as a mixture of four isomers. Therefore, the separation of all enantiomers was not achieved and two peaks could be diastereomers. No reasonable enantioselectivity in the separation of \u03b2-blockers was also obtained with O-CSP. Orivatancin is structurally related to chloreremomycin with an extra 4-chlorodiphenylmethyl- group aside from the aforementioned \u201cbasket\u201d, so it has a similar enantioselectivity for \u03b2-blockers, except for metoprolol (Table 3). The role of carbohydrate residues in the retention and separation of enantiomers is the most intriguing part of the current investigation. For the first time enantioselectivity of CSPs with original eremomycin (E-CSP) and three different eremomycin aglycons was compared to understand the contribution of different carbohydrate residues in chiral recognition. The standard E-CSPs with all three carbohydrate residues presented in the chiral selector shows moderate enantioselectivity with resulting resolution Rs in the range between 0.52 and 0.83 (Table 3). Surprisingly, the same Rs values of 0.52\u20130.85 were obtained for EAg-CSP with no carbohydrate residues in the chiral selector. Therefore, only partial resolution of enantiomers was obtained for these CSPs, as shown in Figure 3. At the same time, EEA-CSP with immobilised eremosaminyl eremomycin aglycon (one carbohydrate residue) and DEE-CSP with immobilised des-eremosaminyl eremomycin (two carbohydrate residues) demonstrated a significantly higher resolution (Rs > 1.5) of enantiomer peaks of \u03b2-blockers (Figure 3). The baseline separation of optical isomers was obtained for all analytes except oxprenalol with an EEA-CSP column, while a different eluent was used. In this case, 100% methanol with a reduced concentration of TEAA was used. It should be noted that the enantioselectivity does not depend on the structure of \u03b2-blockers for DEE-CSP and EAg-CSP columns and varied between 1.12 and 1.17, but not for EEA-CSP (see Tables 2 and 3). CSP with immobilised eremosaminyl eremomycin aglycon cannot split enantiomers of oxprenalol, pronetalol, and atenolol racemates due to the absence of enantioselectivity observed with 100% methanol containing 0.01% TEAA as an eluent. At the same time, higher enantioselectivity (\u03b1 = 1.17\u20132.00) was observed for other studied \u03b2-blockers. Where separation occurred, enantioselectivity was higher than that for a sorbent with eremomycin aglycon (EAg-CSP) for all analytes except for propranolol (Table 2). The fact that the retention and enantioselectivity of both enantiomers increase with a decrease in the number of carbohydrate substitutes from eremomycin (E-CSP) to its complete aglycon (EAg-CSP) indicates that bulky disaccharide moiety in eremomycin produces profound steric hindrance, thus restricting access of \u03b2-blockers to the enantioselective site of the molecule. As such, for \u03b2-blockers, this site is located in the left part of the eremomycin aglycon molecule, free from chlorine atoms (Figure 2). The positive effect of one (EEA-CSP) or two carbohydrate residues (DEE-CSP) on the resolution of enantiomers is an obvious fact, but it could not be easily explained. Possibly, these\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 373 13 of 15\nresidues provide effective shielding of selector sites, which cause strong adsorption but non-enantioselective interactions with \u03b2-blockers. One more option relates to the possibility of obtaining an optimal configuration for carbohydrate residues, which can be available for hydrogen bonding interactions in chiral recognition (Figure 2).\n4. Conclusions\nThe retention of ten \u03b2-adrenergic blockers on eight structurally similar chiral stationary phases was investigated with a focus on the chiral recognition mechanism. It was found that the hydroxyl- group from the \u03b2-blocker molecule interacts with the binding site via hydrogen bonding. The amino- group is protonated in a weakly acidic media according to pKa values (Table 1) and interacts electrostatically with the carboxylic group in eremomycin and its analogues. It was found that a definitive role in this process belongs to the first \u201cbasket\u201d or \u201cpocket\u201d in the molecules of eremomycin-based selectors. The addition of chloro-substituent to the structure of this basket (Chloro-E-CSP, O-CSP) prevents enantioseparation of \u03b2blockers. Conversion of the carboxylic group in the eremomycin molecule into an amide group had a crucial effect on the chiral recognition of \u03b2-blockers. Both Amide-E-CSP and Adamantylamide-E-CSP did not show enantioselectivity towards this group of racemates. The presence of carbohydrate residues was found to be a critical factor in the separation of enantiomers, affecting both selectivity and peak resolution. CSPs with intermediate products of hydrolysis demonstrated the best resolution of \u03b2-blocker enantiomers. Under optimum conditions, the separation of enantiomers for all studied racemates was achieved, except for labetalol, which has two chiral centres in the molecule.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/sym15020373/s1, Figures S1\u2013S4.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, P.N.N.; methodology, M.A.K.; validation, N.S. and M.A.K.; formal analysis, M.A.K. and R.P.; investigation, M.A.K.; resources, S.M.S.; data curation, P.N.N.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.N.N.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.N.N.; supervision, S.M.S.; project administration, S.M.S.; and funding acquisition, S.M.S.
