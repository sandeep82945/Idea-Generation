            "text": "Zero-velocity k points in the Brillouin zone are inevitably present in the one-particle excitation spectrum of a periodic system, as follows from the Morse theorem in differential topology (see [1]). A peculiar role of such points is manifested by the fact that each such k-point generally produces a divergence in the derivative of the corresponding density of states (DOS) at the energy for this k. We refer to such a DOS feature as the van Hove singularity (vHS) [1]. This singularity can be enhanced by some factors (e. g. merging of several singularities, effectivemass divergence, etc.), which results in the DOS divergence at the corresponding energy, leading to significant effects in physical properties.\nThe vHS\u2019s play an important role in the solid state physics leading to important consequences for electronic, magnetic and structural properties. Formation of strong van Hove singularities results in the localization of the electron states and in an increase in the role of correlation effects [2]. Therefore these singularities, especially electronic DOS peaks near the Fermi level, are crucial for ferromagnetic ordering [3, 4] and favor other Fermi-liquid instabilities, including superconductivity (see, e.g., [5]). A geometrical origin of DOS peaks in a general context, as well as its implementation for concrete compound electronic spectrum obtained within the density functional theory (DFT) were investigated in detail in Ref. [6]. In particular, in fcc phase of Sr, weakly dispersive one-dimension manifolds (their prototype is a van Hove line) are positioned at the face of the Brillouin zone near the Fermi level. They correspond to X\u2013U, U\u2013L, L\u2013K, K\u2013U, and K\u2013W directions.\nRecently, so-called higher-order van Hove singularities connected with divergence of some effective masses have attracted a lot of attention, in particular as a possible cause of unconventional insulating state and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene at a magic angle [7, 8, 9]. A giant vHS was found within DFT calculations [10] in Mg3Bi2 compound with\nhigh thermoelectric power. Non-trivial consequences of electron spectrum features were found in nodal-line semimetals: three-dimensional ZrSiSe [11] and bilayer ZrSiS [12] possessing a whole vHS line. We state that peculiarities of spectrum may have various and valuable impact onto physical properties and its isoenergetic surface topology should be investigated carefully within numerical and analytical aspects.\nVan Hove singularities are also extensively discussed now in the context of the so-called Hund\u2019s metals where they can result (together with asymmetry of DOS with respect to the Fermi level) in a considerable enhancement of quasiparticle damping (up to destroying Landau quasiparticle behaviour) as a consequence of the Hund coupling [13]. Compounds with particular narrow bands can serve as examples of such systems: \u03b1and \u03b3-Fe, and Ni were considered as candidates to the Hund\u2019s metal group [13]. The Hund-metal features are similar to the orbital-selective Mott transitions, introduced to explain unusual properties of Ca2\u2212xSrxRuO4 [14], which are to a large extent determined by vHS. Strong and non-monotonous temperature behaviour of magnetic susceptibility in LaFeAsO is caused by a closeness of the DOS peak, possibly produced by van Hove singularity near the Fermi level [15]. Therefore it is instructive and useful for concrete calculations to have explicit DOS expressions.\nEarly investigation [16] presented a numerical interpolation of DOS for cubic lattices, but only the case of nearest-neighbor hopping approximation (integral t) was considered. At the same time, for modeling real compounds the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t\u2032 plays often an important role. For the square lattice, this point was widely discussed in the context of superconducting cuprates within the non-degenerate Hubbard model. Here, simple Ne\u0301el antiferromagnetic order, being present in the nearest-neighbour approximation at half-filling for arbitrarily small Hubbard\u2019s U, can be replaced by incommensurate magnetic ordering [17, 18], d-wave susceptibility [19], ferromag-\nPreprint submitted to Journal of LATEX Templates\nnetic ordering [17, 18, 19, 20], provided that considerable nextnearest-neighbour hopping is introduced.\nThe van Hove singularity owing to L point in the fcc lattice Brillouin zone produces weak ferromagnetic ordering in ZrZn2 and plays important role in unusual physical properties: metamagnetic transition in a weak magnetic field, Lifshitz transitions, non-Fermi-liquid behaviour [21, 22, 23, 24]. Magnetic ordering in Ni is mainly caused by the vicinity of L point to the Fermi surface (so-called \u201cvan Hove magnet\u201d) [25], which dramatically distinguishes this from systems with well-formed local moments like \u03b1-Fe and rare-earth systems.\nFrom this point of view, the case of three-dimensional bipartite lattices (simple cubic and body-centered cubic) was investigated in Refs. [26, 27], closed analytical expressions for DOS as a function of energy and \u03c4 = t\u2032/t in terms of elliptic integrals being obtained.\nFor a non-bipartite fcc lattice, an analytical investigation of the Van Hove energy levels and numerical analysis of the DOS within the nearest and the next-nearest neighbour hopping approximation were performed to a great extent only in a limited interval 0 < \u03c4 < +1 [28], which did not allow to find van Hove singularity lines. At the special value \u03c4 = \u22121/2, a giant Van Hove line occurs at the band edge producing a DOS singularity of the inverse square-root type (for the case of infinitedimension lattice it was discussed in Ref. [29]). Here we provide an analysis of stability of this singularity and of its influence on the DOS picture in the whole \u03c4 interval."

Below we take t = 1 for brevity. The definition of nearest-neighbor hopping integral is the same as in Ref. [16]. Density of states is defined by the following integral over Brillouin zone\n\u03c1fcc(\u01eb, \u03c4 = 0) =\n\u222b\nd3k VBZ \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 tfcc (k; \u03c4)). (2)\nIn Table 1 we present an analysis of van Hove k points in the vicinity of van Hove k point) depending on \u03c4. We write down their energy and signature, i.e. the difference of positive and negative indices of inertia of the second order tfcc (k; \u03c4) Taylorexpansion terms. For further convenience, an excerpt from this in a demonstrative manner is given in Fig. 1.\nAn analogous Table I is presented in Ref. [28], being restricted to \u03c4 < 1 (\u03b3 = \u2212\u03c4 in that consideration). To compare, 0 point of [28] corresponds to \u0393 being a global minimum at \u03c4 < 1 and a local maximum at \u03c4 > 1; A point of [28] corresponds to L and actually changes its type at \u03c4 = +1 to global minimum at\n\u03c4 > 1; B point of [28] corresponds to W and does not change its vHS type at \u03c4 = \u22121, as is claimed in Ref. [28]; C point of [28] corresponds to X; D point of Ref. [28] corresponds to \u2206\u2217 and is realized at |\u03c4| > 1 with /+1/ at \u03c4 < \u22121 and /-1/ at \u03c4 > +1, which is not taken into account in [28] (also the expression for the energy contains a typo); E point of [28] corresponds to \u03a3\u2217. Thus the Table I of Ref. [28] contains some errors and typos.\nThe \u03c4 dependence of van Hove energies presented in Fig. 1 implies that at special values \u03c4 = \u22121,\u22121/2, 0, 1/2, 1 isoenergetic surfaces demonstrate topological transitions (change of van Hove singularity types).\nThe derivation of DOS formula for fcc lattice is presented in the next Section, see Eq. (22\u201321). Below in this Section we present only calculation results and qualitative analysis. We have three special cases providing van Hove singularities: \u03c4 = \u22121/2, \u03c4 = 0 and \u03c4 = 1. For \u03c4 = \u22121/2 the whole van Hove surface\ncos kx + cos ky + cos kz = 0 (3)\nis formed, which corresponds to merging of energy levels for W, L and \u03a3\u2217 points, and results in giant quasi-one-dimensional behavior. However in this case DOS can be calculated easily, since the spectrum can be represented as tfcc (k;\u22121/2) = 3 \u2212 t2sc(k)/2, where tsc(k) = 2(cos kx+cos ky+cos kz) is tight-binding\nspectrum for the simple cubic lattice in the nearest-neighbour approximation. Direct use of this formula implies\n\u03c1fcc(\u01eb; \u03c4 = \u22121/2) = \u221a 2\u03c1sc( \u221a 2(3 \u2212 \u01eb)) \u221a\n3 \u2212 \u01eb . (4)\nwith \u03c1sc(\u01eb) being the corresponding simple cubic lattice DOS. This implies that van Hove singularity exists at the top of the band \u01eb = +3, and in the vicinity of it we have the following \u201cone-dimensional\u201d asymptotics \u03c1fcc(\u01eb) = \u221a 2\u03c1sc(0)/ \u221a\n3 \u2212 \u01eb + O( \u221a\n3 \u2212 \u01eb). Such a singularity is analogous to that for the square lattice in the next-nearest-neighbour hopping approximation at t\u2032 = 0.5t when the flat band in the vicinity of van Hove lines kx = 0 and ky = 0 is formed [30].\nFrom Figs. 2\u20135, one can trace the influence of small deviations from critical \u03c4 values on DOS plots. We deal with giant van Hove singularities of three types: (i) the logarithmic one (for \u03c4 = 0) at the top of the band; this was found by R. Jelitto [16]; (ii) the inverse fourth-order-root type which was found at \u03c4 = 1 at the bottom of the band; (iii) quasi-one-dimensional one of inverse-square-root type (\u03c4 = \u22121/2) at the top of the band, which originates from van Hove surface containing high-order\nvan Hove points. From Fig. 3 one can see that logarithmic singularity is much weaker than inverse-square-root type singularity. This relation holds under deviation of \u03c4 from critical values corresponding to topological transitions. At the same time, the difference of (ii) and (iii) singularities is practically not seen on the scale shown.\nThe transition of \u03c4 through each special point \u03c4 = \u22121/2, 0, 1 causes a divergence of one or more of electron masses, see Table 1. This means that at deviation of \u03c4 from the \u201ccritical\u201d value the van Hove line or surface decays into a few points with heavy masses.\nAt \u03c4 . \u22121/2, see Fig. 2, two van Hove points W/ + 1/ and \u03a3\u2217/ \u2212 1/ are formed with close energies, wfcc\n\u03a3\u2217 (\u03c4) \u2212 wfccW (\u03c4) \u223c \u2212(1+2\u03c4); there is a narrow plateau between these energy levels. At the same time the occurrence of a kink at van Hove energy w\u2206\u2217 at \u03c4 < \u22121 does not change substantially the DOS form. For \u03c4 larger than \u22121/2 (up to \u03c4 = 0), the energy interval between these two points near the band top corresponds to strong falling of DOS from the energy of the saddle point (\u03a3\u2217) to the energy of the maximum (W) with heavy mass at \u03c4 close to 0 and \u22121/2, see Fig. 3. According to Table 1, internal van Hove points \u2206\u2217 and \u03a3\u2217 are absent in the case |\u03c4| \u2264 1. The least interesting case 0 < \u03c4 < 1 was investigated in detail in Ref. [28], see Fig. 4. Inside this interval, there are no internal van Hove points, as well as van Hove lines and surfaces but at the ends of this interval, \u03c4 = 0, 1 giant van Hove singularities occur.\nAt \u03c4 & +1, the van Hove line \u039b present at \u03c4 = +1 and producing giant van Hove singularity decays into three van Hove points: \u2206\u2217, \u03a3\u2217, \u0393. Besides that, the energies of two first points form a typical narrow plateau with the width wfcc\n\u2206\u2217 (\u03c4)\u2212wfcc\u03a3\u2217 (\u03c4) \u223c (\u03c4 \u2212 1)2 between levels of opposite-signature saddle points, see Fig 5.\nFor \u03c4 = 0, the van Hove line V = {(0, \u03c0, kz),\u2212\u03c0/2 < kz < \u03c0/2} joining W and X points corresponds to merging of energy levels of these points. Therefore we get for inverse transverse masses m\u22121 V\n(kz) = \u22124(1\u00b1cos kz). In this case, we represent the spectrum in the vicinity of the V line as\nEV (kz, qx, qy) = tfcc ( kV (qx, \u03c0 + qy, kz); \u03c4 = 0 )\n= 4\u22122(1\u2212cos kz)q2x \u2212 2(1+ cos kz)q2y + (1\u2212 cos kz)q4x/6+ (1+ cos kz)q4y/6+ q2xq2y.\nExpanding the spectrum in kz = qz we get up to leading terms\ntfcc ( kV (qx, \u03c0 + qy, qz); \u03c4 = 0 ) = 4 \u2212 4q2y \u2212 q2xq2z\nwhich implies that X is a higher-order van Hove point, since only one inverse mass is non-zero.\nWe have six non-equivalent V lines, each pair of them being positioned at the square faces of the Brillouin zone. The contribution of the vicinity of these lines, see Eq. (2), reads (we take into account that a pair of V lines crosses at higher-order van Hove X point, so that to avoid doubling the contribution of X point vicinity we divide this by factor of 2)\n\u2206\u03c1V (\u01eb, \u03c4 = 0) = 3\n\u222b\nO(V)\nd3k VBZ \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 tfcc (k; \u03c4 = 0)), (5)\nwhere the Brillouin zone volume for fcc lattice reads VBZ = 4\u03c03. qx = (1 \u2212 cos kz)\u22121/2q\u22a5 cos\u03d5, qy = (1 + cos kz)\u22121/2q\u22a5 sin\u03d5\nand O(V) is determined by cutoff conditions. We obtain\n\u2206\u03c1V (\u01eb, \u03c4 = 0)\n= 3\nVBZ\n\u03c0/2 \u222b\n\u2212\u03c0/2\ndkz\n\u222b\ndqxdqy\u03b4 ( \u01eb \u2212 EV (kz, qx, qy) )\n= 3\nVBZ\n\u03c0/2 \u222b\n\u2212\u03c0/2\ndkz\n| sin kz|\nq\u0304\u22a5(kz) \u222b\n0\ndq\u22a5q\u22a5\n2\u03c0 \u222b\n0\nd\u03d5\u03b4 (\n\u01eb \u2212 4 + 2q2\u22a5\n\u2212q 4 \u22a5\n12\n       cos4 \u03d5\nsin2 kz 2\n+ sin4 \u03d5\ncos2 kz 2\n+ 3 sin2 2\u03d5\nsin2 kz\n              , (6)\nwhere kz-dependent cutoff parameter is introduced which is determined from fourth-order terms in the spectrum expansion. Main contribution to the integral originates from small kz, so that sin4 \u03d5 term is irrelevant. Maximal value of the fourth-order term is q4\u22a5/(3k 2 z ). From the condition 2q 2 \u22a5 = q 4 \u22a5/(3k 2 z ) we find an estimation of the scale where fourth-order terms become important, q\u0304\u22a5 (kz) = \u03b1V kz, \u03b1V \u223c \u221a 6. We get finally the asymptotics valid at small 4 \u2212 \u01eb:\n\u2206\u03c1V (\u01eb, \u03c4 = 0) = 3\n8\u03c02 \u03b8 (4 \u2212 \u01eb) ln\n8\u03b12 V\n4 \u2212 \u01eb . (7)\nThe line \u039b, joining van Hove points \u0393 and L, becomes van Hove line at \u03c4 = 1. We consider this case by expanding spectrum in the vicinity of van Hove line \u039b: kx = ky = kz = k\u039b, 0 < k\u03bb < \u03c0/2. We parametrize the line \u039b as k\u039b(q1, q2, k\u039b) =\nq\u22a5 cos\u03d5e1 + q\u22a5 sin \u03d5e2 + \u221a 3k\u039be3, where the orthonor-\nmal basis e1(+1/ \u221a 2, 0,\u22121/ \u221a 2), e2(\u22121/ \u221a 6,+2/ \u221a 6,\u22121/ \u221a 6),\ne2(+1/ \u221a 3,+1/ \u221a 3,+1/ \u221a 3) was used. We have up to higher order terms E\u039b(k\u039b, q\u22a5, \u03d5) = tfcc (k\u039b(q\u22a5, \u03d5, k\u039b); \u03c4 = 1) = \u22126 + 6 sin2 k\u039bq 2 \u22a5 \u2212 \u221a 6 sin k\u039b cos k\u039b sin \u03d5(3 cos 2 \u03d5 \u2212 sin2 \u03d5)q3\u22a5 \u2212 (3 \u2212 5 cos 2k\u039b)q 4 \u22a5/8. Since in the vicinity of k\u039b = 0 the leading nonconstant contribution starts from fourth-order terms in q\u22a5 and kz, we see that \u0393 is a van Hove higher-order point with all the inverse masses being zero. Analogously to the case of V line we introduce the cutoff for q\u0304\u22a5 = \u03b1\u22a5k\u039b, where numerical value \u03b1\u22a5 \u223c \u221a 6 and should be determined more precisely later.\nWe extract from the definition (2) the contribution from the\nvicinity eight \u039b lines\n\u2206\u03c1\u039b(\u01eb, \u03c4 = 1) = 8\n\u222b\nO(\u039b)\nd3k VBZ \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 tfcc (k; \u03c4 = 1))\n= 8\n4\u03c03\n\u03c0/2 \u222b\n0\ndk\u039b\nq\u0304(k\u039b) \u222b\n0\ndq\u22a5q\u22a5\n2\u03c0 \u222b\n0\nd\u03d5\u03b4 (\u01eb \u2212 E\u039b(k\u039b, q\u22a5, \u03d5)) . (8)\nDue to the use of the cutoff, we can neglect subleading terms in formula (8) to obtain:\n\u2206\u03c1\u039b(\u01eb, \u03c4 = 1) = 1\n3\u03c02\n(\n6\u03b12\u22a5 6 + \u01eb\n)1/4\n. (9)\nTo get a close agreement for Eq. (9) and numerical calculation (see below) in the vicinity \u01eb = \u22126 point we choose \u03b1\u22a5 = 1.88 \u221a 6 \u2248 4.6. We compare \u03c1fcc(\u01eb, \u03c4 = 1) calculated by direct using Eq. (22), see below, and asymptotics (9) with a chosen \u03b1\u22a5 = 4.6 in Fig. 6. One case see a good agreement in the vicinity of the vHS point at \u01eb = \u22126."

            "text": "A commonly used tetrahedron method [31] is a popular tool of density-of-states calculation within density functional theory [32]. A fundamental block of this approach is linear approximation of the spectrum within an elementary tetrahedron. However, when one of tetrahedron vertices is a van Hove point, its contribution, being actually dominating, is crudely averaged with the contributions of another vertices. This implies very bad accuracy of the method when the energy is in the vicinity of van Hove points. In Fig. 7, a comparison of the results of direct calculation using Eq. (22) and tetrahedron method is shown. For the latter method, we find strong artificial oscillations in the vicinity of van Hove energies. The convergence of the results in the limit Nmesh \u2192 \u221e is thereby substantially poor. The origin of this discrepancy is an averaging of vertices of particular tetrahedron with zero velocity and non-zero on equal foot, which underestimates the contribution of van Hove singularity point vicinity in reciprocal space, see also Ref.

These singularities can play an important role in the temperature dependencies of physical properties. e.g., electronic heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, thermoelectric power (for bipartite lattices, these effects were treated in Refs.[26, 27]). In this connection, examples of fcc Ni and ZrZn2 (the C15 Laves phase crystal structure which is a superposition of fcc sublattices) can be once more mentioned. The vHS can be also important for some lattice and magnetic characteristics owing to anomalies of phonon and magnon spectra. Especial role belongs to van Hove lines intersection typically forming a higher-order van Hove point, which leads to more strong effects [10].\nWe also state that DOS in the vicinity of vHS energies can be poorly captured by standard approaches within dynamical mean-field theory (d = \u221e limit) and tetrahedron method, which are popular in density-functional calculations. Our analysis can be useful to supplement computational approaches which deal with the electron spectrum and properties of actual materials.\nThe research was carried out within the state assignment of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (theme \u201cQuantum\u201d No. 122021000038-7) and supported in part by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project No. 20-02-00252).

[29], the fcc-lattice DOS in the limit of infinite space dimension d was considered in the special case t\u2032 = t/2 (where giant quasi-one-dimension van Hove singularity is formed owing to van Hove surface). Passing to such a limit may be useful in the context of dynamical mean-field approach implementation. Therefore, it is instructive to compare the DOS form in the limit of infinite dimension with the case d = 3. To derive an explicit expression for DOS in this limit we have to set the scaling of hopping integrals with d: t = t1/ \u221a\nd(d \u2212 1), t\u2032 = t2/ \u221a 2d (this is based on the fact that a site in fcc lattice has 2d(d \u2212 1) nearest and 2d next-nearest neighbours).

Since \u03b5k = \u2212t1(\u03be2 \u2212 1) + t2\u03b7, we obtain directly\n\u03c1d=\u221e(\u03b5; t1, t2) = exp\n[ \u2212(\u03b5 \u2212 t1)2/(2t22) ]\n2\u03c0 \u221a |t1t2|\nf\n      t2 2 \u2212 2t1(\u03b5 \u2212 t1) |t1t2|       ,\n(24)\nwhere\nf (x) = ex\n2/16\n2\n\u221a |x|    \n  \nK1/4(x 2/16), x > 0,\n\u03c0\u221a 2\n(\nI1/4(x 2/16) + I\u22121/4(x 2/16) ) , x < 0,\n(25)\nwhere I\u03bd and K\u03bd are Infeld and McDonald functions, respectively.\nThe comparison of the results for the cases d = 3 and d \u2192 \u221e at \u03c4 = \u22120.6 is shown in Fig. 7. We can see that the d = 3 DOS possesses pronounced van Hove plateau, which is destroyed in the limit d \u2192 \u221e. Note also that the case of giant van Hove singularity t\u2032 = t/2 is not captured by Eq. (24)."
