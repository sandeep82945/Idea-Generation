 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the anticancer efficacy and mechanism of CDFHCD in additional PDAC cell lines and mouse models. The current study showed promising results in a limited number of cell lines, so expanding this could strengthen the evidence.

2. Investigate combination therapies of CDFHCD with current first-line chemotherapies like gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX. The paper suggests CDFHCD could have utility in combination, so directly testing synergistic effects would be logical next steps.

3. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of CDFHCD in vivo compared to unformulated CDF. The paper indicates improved hydrolytic stability and bioavailability, but in vivo studies are needed to confirm. 

4. Assess the specificity and cytotoxic effects of CDFHCD on normal pancreatic cells and tissues. The current study only looked at one immortalized cell line, so expanding the safety profile is important.

5. Explore CDFHCD efficacy in other cancer types beyond pancreatic cancer. Curcumin has broad anticancer activities, so determining if similar effects are seen for CDFHCD in other cancers would be interesting.
