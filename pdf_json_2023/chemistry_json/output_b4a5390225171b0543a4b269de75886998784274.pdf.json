    "abstractText": "According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that by 2050, drug-resistant infections could cause up to 10 million deaths annually. Therefore, finding a new generation of antibiotics is crucial. Natural compounds from endophytic fungi are considered a potential source of new-generation antibiotics. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of ethyl acetate extracts of nine endophytic fungal isolates obtained from Hyssopus officinalis were investigated for bioassay-guided isolation of the natural compounds. An extract of isolate VII showed the highest antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (30.12 \u00b1 0.20 mm and 35.21 \u00b1 0.20 mm) and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.41 \u00b1 0.23 mm and 25.12 \u00b1 0.25 mm) among the tested extracts of isolates. Molecular identification of isolate VII confirmed it as Chaetomium elatum based on sequencing of its ITS genes, and it was discovered that this was the first time C. elatum had been isolated from H. officinalis. This isolate was cultured at a large scale for the isolation and identification of the active compound. Penicillic acid was isolated for the first time from C. elatum and its chemical structure was established by NMR spectroscopy. The penicillic acid showed strong antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with 20.68 mm and 25.51 mm inhibition zones, respectively. In addition, MIC and MBC values and antibiofilm activities of penicillic acid were determined. It was found that penicillic acid reduced the level of biofilms in proportion to antibacterial activity.",

The enhancement of antimicrobial resistance is\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1201. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12071201 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1201 2 of 15\nstrengthening the pathogenicity and virulence of infectious microbes [1\u20133]. Therefore, finding new antibiotics is crucial to combat these resistant bacteria [4]. Natural compounds from endophytic fungi are potential candidates for new antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria [5]. Because secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi have been reported to exhibit a number of interesting potential biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antivirus, anti-inflammatory, etc. [6,7]. For example, three new polyketides, trichodermaketone E (1), 4-epi-7-O-methylkoninginin D (2), and trichopyranone A (3), and two new terpenoids, 3-hydroxyharziandione (4) and 10,11-dihydro-11-hydroxycyclonerodiol (5), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Trichoderma koningiopsis QA-3 obtained from Artemisia argyi. Compounds 1, 3\u20135, displayed inhibition against E. coli, with MIC values ranging from 0.5 to 64 \u00b5g/mL. Among the compounds tested, compound 3-hydroxyharziandione showed the strongest activity against E. coli, with a MIC value of 0.5 \u00b5g/mL [8]. In general, natural compound isolated from endophytic fungi are tested to antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. There are several reasons for exploring the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of potential new drugs. Firstly, there is an urgent need for new drugs to treat both infectious diseases and cancer. Secondly, any new drug should be tested for both activities to ensure its safety and efficacy [9]. Recently, quite a lot of work has appeared on the isolation of penicillic acid from various sources, for example from Antarctic marine sediment or from various fungi of the genus of Penicillium [10,11]. Penicillic acid had antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [12]. Although penicillic acid has been known since the 1930s [13], so far, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Although it is believed that penicillic acid may be an inhibitor of quorum sensing signals [14], the anti-biofilm effect has been shown only in a number of cases over a narrow concentration range [15]. Medicinal plants possess a distinct microbiome attributed to their unique bioactive secondary metabolites [16]. Therefore, in recent years, more attention has been given to the endophytic fungi of medicinal plants, which represent a rich source of new and useful natural compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and a potential source for the discovery of novel microorganisms [17]. Endophytic fungi inhabit plant tissues without instigating any noticeable symptoms of infection and do not cause adverse effects on their hosts [18\u201320]. To date, the endophytic fungi of only a few plants have ever been completely studied, like Taxus brevifolia. Taxol, an anti-cancer drug, was extracted from the endophytic fungus Taxomyces andreanae obtained from a plant. Thus, it is vital to study the diversity and chemical contents with biological activities of the endophytic fungi of medicinal plants [21,22]. H. officinalis is a polymorphous species that grows in central Asia, Iran, India, Mongolia, Europe, and Russia. This plant is used in folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases such as bacterial and fungal infections, wounds, asthma, cough, loss of appetite, and spasmodic disorders [23\u201326]. However, the diversity, chemical contents, and biological activities of the endophytic fungi of the H. officinalis have not been explored. Therefore, the aim of the research was the isolation of the endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant H. officinalis, the study of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the fungal isolate\u2019s extracts, and bioassay-guided isolation and identification of the active compound from the most active isolate. Moreover, studying the impact of the isolated active compound to bacterial cells and levels of biofilms formation properties of the bacteria."

            "text": "Four Petri dishes with antibiotic-containing PDA (potato dextrose agar) medium were used for the isolation of endophytic fungi from stem and leaf samples of H. officinalis. As a result, a total of nine morphologically different endophytic fungi were isolated and obtained isolates were cultured in small volumes and extracted with acetate extracts (EtOAc). After that, the primary antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the extracts were determined in order to select the most active isolate among them for further work.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1201 3 of 15\nAccording to the results of antimicrobial activities, all isolates\u2019 extracts except isolate V showed antimicrobial activities against the tested bacterial strains. The EtOAc extracts of isolate I, II, IV, VI, VIII and IX showed appreciable antibacterial activities against the tested bacterial strains. The extracts of the isolate III and VII manifested pronounced and strong antibacterial effects against the bacterial strains. Antibacterial activities of the extracts of isolate VII against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus were 30.12 \u00b1 0.20 mm and 35.21 \u00b1 0.20 mm, respectively, which were higher than the positive control ampicillin. The extracts of the three fungal isolates (II, VII, and VIII) showed activities against also Candida albicans. Isolate VII exhibited the highest antimicrobial activities among the obtained isolates (Table 1). Therefore, isolate VII was selected for further work for the isolation of antimicrobial active compounds and molecular identification of the isolate.\nNA no activity; NT not tested.\nIn vitro cytotoxic activities of the extracts of the isolates were tested against epithelial carcinoma of the cervix (HeLa), adenocarcinoma of the larynx (HEp-2), breast adenocarcinoma (HBL-100), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM), and normal hepatocyte and fibroblast cells. According to the results of cytotoxic activities, the extract of isolate III inhibited 98.5 \u00b1 0.8% and 89.2 \u00b1 0.5% of HEp-2 and HeLa, respectively. Additionally, the extract of isolate VIII showed 100.0 \u00b1 0.0% and 77.5 \u00b1 0.4% activities against CCRF-CEM and HeLa cell lines, respectively. However, both of the fungal extracts also inhibited normal cell lines, like 69.8 \u00b1 0.4% and 100 \u00b1 0.0% inhibition of fibroblast cells by extracts of isolate III and isolate VIII, respectively.

For instance, the anticancer compound taxol, which was originally isolated from the Pacific yew Taxus brevifolia, has also been found in the fungus Taxomyces andreanae, which was isolated from the same plant [33]. H. officinalis is\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1201 8 of 15\nalso a medicinal plant widely used in folk medicine. According to Rusanova et al. [24], they isolated a total of 12 fungal isolates from H. officinalis, including eight Alternaria alternata, two F. oxysporum, Bipolaris sp., and Epicoccum nigrum. However, the biological activities of microorganisms isolated from this plant have not been studied. In this study, nine endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and their biological activities were investigated. Among these isolates, the most active one was molecularly identified as a C. elatum. Until now, C. elatum has not been isolated from H. officinalis. Some strains of C. elatum have been found to produce secondary metabolites with potential pharmaceutical applications, including compounds with anticancer, antiviral, and antifungal properties [28]. C. elatum was isolated from H. officinalis for the first time, and the biologically active compound penicillic acid was subsequently isolated and its structure was determined. Penicillic acid is a mycotoxin produced by several species of fungi, including Penicillium species, Fusarium solani, Aspergillus species, and others [31,34]. In this study, a new producer of penicillic acid has also been identified, which can synthesize it in large quantities. According to Zheng et al. [31], penicillic acid showed strong cytotoxic activities against six human cancer cell lines with IC50 values, 0.80\u20137.46 \u00b5g/mL, even though the compound was considered cancerogenic. Due to its low LD50 of 100 mg/kg (subcutaneous) for mice, penicillic acid has been found to be too toxic for therapeutic use. Therefore, in this study, more attention was given to the antibacterial properties of penicillic acid. Penicillic acid has also shown antimicrobial properties and may contribute to the ability of certain fungi to compete with other microorganisms for resources [35]. A comparison of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria indicates that penicillic acid seems to easily penetrate into the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, which is not surprising due to its small size and hydrophilicity. Thus, the main barrier to penicillic acid is the inner bacterial membrane. Since, apparently, the equilibrium of concentrations outside the cell envelope and in the periplasmic space is established rather quickly, we cannot observe the work of the MDR pumps to pump out penicillic acid outside the cell envelope. At the same time, this does not mean that the pumps are not involved in pumping out this substance, there is simply no difference in pumping it into the periplasmic space or outside the cell envelope. Another important point may be the multiplicity of MDR pumps involved in pumping it out. This is indirectly confirmed by the fact that the deletion of the TolC protein, which makes 8 MDR pumps inactive at once [36], but slightly reduces the MIC. That is, multiple shutdowns of the pumps involved in pumping out can be detected, but it is not possible to determine which pumps are involved. At the same time, it should be noted that the complex bacteria of the Mycobacteriales order are more resistant and penicillic acid does not have a bactericidal effect on them. This agrees with the data obtained earlier in [37] on the bacteria Clavibacter michiganensis. At the same time, the mechanism of resistance to penicillic acid is poorly understood, and apparently it may be more common in bacteria associated with plants. Although penicillic acid is known as one of the inhibitors of quorum sensing signals [14,38], there is evidence that, in combination with EDTA and Patulin, it affects the formation of biofilms of dental unit water line isolates [39]; however, the observed effects were contradictory. In our experiments, we have shown that penicillic acid equally inhibits the growth of both planktonic and sessile parts of the E. coli bacterial population. We did not find any specific effect on the reduction of biofilm formation. However, the overall level of biofilms decreases in proportion to the decrease in the number of bacteria in the population due to the antibacterial action of penicillic acid. In summary, penicillic acid can inhibit growth and be a bactericidal antibiotic against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, with the exception of Mycobacteriales order bacteria, as well as reduce the level of biofilms in proportion to antibacterial activity.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1201 9 of 15"

EtOAc extract of the C. elatum showed the most effective antimicrobial activities among the extracts of the obtained fungal isolates. It was found that C. elatum extract showed strong antibacterial activity due to mycotoxin penicillic acid. Penicillic acid was first isolated from the fungus C. elatum, and its structure was established by NMR spectroscopy. This result provides further evidence for the synthesis of specific substances by different organisms. However, it raises the question of whether these substances are synthesized uniformly across all organisms. To address this question, future studies should focus on investigating the biochemical synthesis pathway of penicillic acid and identifying the gene clusters involved in its production. Penicillic acid showed strong antibacterial and antibiofilm activities. In addition, the high content of penicillic acid in C. elatum suggests that it could be a promising source of bioactive compounds for potential future applications, including the development of new, non-toxic active compounds through chemical modification. Therefore, our future work will focus on several tasks, such as investigating the mechanism of action of penicillic acid on bacterial cells, synthesizing its chemical derivatives, and evaluating its biological activity.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antibiotics12071201/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR (600 MHz) spectrum of compound 1 in CD3OD; Figure S2: 13C NMR (150 MHz) spectrum of compound 1 in CD3OD; Figure S3: HSQC spectrum of compound 1 in CD3OD; Figure S4: HMBC spectrum of compound 1 in CD3OD; Figure S5: COSY spectrum of compound 1 in CD3OD; Figure S6: Biofilm formation of B. subtilis at different concentrations of penicillic acid.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.E., P.A.N. and S.A.; methodology, J.A., F.E., M.K., K.D., A.A., A.B., G.P. and E.T.; formal analysis, S.S. and F.E.; investigation, K.B., M.K., S.S., F.E. and A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.E., K.B., P.A.N., J.A. and S.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.E., P.A.N., D.E. and S.A.; supervision, S.A.
