    "abstractText": "This review aimed to identify and synthesize the most significant literature addressing talent identification and development in futsal. A systematic review of Web of ScienceTM (all databases), Scopus, PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. This study included original articles in English, Spanish or Portuguese containing relevant data on talent development/identification of male futsal players. The search yielded 238 articles. After screening, a total of 32 manuscripts were fully reviewed. The quality of the data reviewed was generally good. Results indicate that the most successful players exhibit technical, tactical, anthropometric, physiological and psychological advantages and are distinguished from lower-level players based on their earlier dedication to training. This review highlights the need for those involved in the process of identifying and developing talented futsal players to consider the technical and tactical skills of futsal players, along with their anthropometric and physiological characteristics, scaled to age. Finally, special attention should be paid to the supportive psychosocial environments created in sports academies for developing futsal players. Overall, talent identification and development programmes in futsal need to be dynamic and offer the possibility of changing assessment parameters in the long term.",

            "text": "Futsal has been gaining popularity worldwide, leading thousands of children to aspire to become futsal players, excited by the magnificent performances of top teams and motivated by exceptional players. Today, futsal has attracted many people\u2019s interest due to the high skill level and agility of athletes [1]. Thus, scientific research on this sport has increased exponentially in the last decade to further understand the characteristics and specificities of futsal players and teams\u2019 dynamics [2\u20135]. Generally, futsal requires players to perform high-intensity actions quickly and with little space, thus requiring high physical and physiological efforts, as well as tactical and technical skills. Moreover, during matches, the futsal players are expected to make quick decisions and swiftly perform offensive (passing, dribbling and shooting) and defensive (marking, intercepting balls) tasks [6]. Given the nature of futsal (such as the court size, game system, competition duration and skills involved), many variables influence success in this sport, and there is a need to identify the best selection criteria for identifying the best players [7].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191710648 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 2 of 19\nIn different sports, some players show exceptional qualities, which translate into extraordinary and consistent performances, allowing them to be designated as talents or claim that they have talent. For a long time, the talent identification process has comprised the detection, selection and development of players\u2019 capacities conducted by experts [8]. Talent identification programs are designed to identify young athletes with the potential for achieving success at the senior elite level [9]. However, the use of the word \u201ctalent\u201d does not always correspond to a clear understanding of how performances occur or the reasons that lead to these [10]. However, in futsal, like in similar sports (e.g., football), the idea persists that excellent players are born with a natural talent, which guarantees that they will have the attributes required to reach high levels of sporting expression [10]. For example, football players were traditionally selected by coaches based on a subjective analysis that recognized the potential of young players to complement the style of play of their club [11]. This conviction manifests itself in different forms and can be witnessed by the recurrent discourses and practices of various actors in sports. An innate understanding of talent can also be confirmed by an excessive concern with the so-called talent detection, through which the aim is to discover individuals who, at any given moment, exhibit above-average attributes. One of the resulting problems is that most of the time, the appreciation of talent scouts is contaminated by side effects related to the biological age and physical precocity of players. That is, the older a child or young adult is relative to their teammates, the more likely they are to be considered gifted, even if they are not. This process has caused the negative discrimination of many players, as it does not identify the skills considered essential to become competent players during so-called capture sessions. The fact is ignored that the learning time and the consolidation of skills show high inter-individual variability, with different responses given by athletes to the stimuli to which they are submitted, specifically according to their biological and chronological age [12]. Scientific knowledge on talent identification and development in futsal has not progressed far enough to influence or inform sport practice. Despite increasing research interest, the best scientific approaches to successfully identify and develop futsal players remain unclear. Therefore, a systematic review of futsal and a synthesis of knowledge about the specificity of talent identification and development in this sport would help to better understand the game and evolve it even further. Talented futsal players cannot be identified and developed reliably unless the skills that best match the specific demands of the game are identified. Thus, this article aimed to systematically review and organize the most significant literature addressing talent identification and development among male futsal players. The goal of this review is to identify the most frequently researched topics and characterize the methodologies used to study them."

The chronological analysis of the articles considered in this review evidenced recent developments in this area of research and highlighted that more than half of the studies (59.38%) were published in the last four years (i.e., since 2018).\n3.2. Quality of the Studies The most noteworthy results were that (1) the mean score for the 32 selected studies\nwas 68.8%, (2) no publication scored below 50%, (3) only seven studies scored more than 80% and (4) 13 publications achieved an overall rating of more than 75%.\n3.3. General Description of the Studies The results were organized by categorizing the studies according to the major re-\nsearch topics that emerged from the content analysis based on a previous classification from the review published by Sarmento, Anguera [11] on male football players.\nSimilar to the results of the systematic review of Sarmento, Anguera [11], the studies on male futsal players reviewed in the present work were markedly multidimensional [17\u201320]. Nevertheless, th generality was focused on a single topic. Namely, these topics were (1) task constraints: (a) specificity and volume of practice; (2) performers\u2032 constraints: (a) psychological factors, (b) technical and tactical skills and (c) anthropometric and physiological factors (compared according to competitive lev l, l ying positions and birth month); (3) environmental c nstr ints: (a) relative ge effect (RAE) and (b) s cio-cultural influences; and (4) multidimensional analysis (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Scopes of talent identification and development in futsal.\n3.3.1. Task Constraints Specificity and Amount of Practice\nRecent research indicates that elite players are distinguished from lower-level players for their earlier dedication to training and specifically to futsal (Table 1), as it is important to progressively increase the volume of weekly training [21].\n3.3.1. Task Constraints\nSpecificity and Amount of Practice\nRecent research indicates that elite players are distinguished from lower-level players for their earlier dedication to training and specifically to futsal (Table 1), as it is important to progressively increase the volume of weekly training [21].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 5 of 19\n3.3.2. Performers\u2032 Constraints Psychological Factors\nSix papers addressed information exclusively dedicated to the psychological factors affecting futsal players (Table 2). These investigations focused mainly on decision-making processes [18,20,47], electro-cortical activity and reaction time [25], the teaching\u2013learningtraining process [26] and self-confidence and stress control [23]. As such, these studies provide information about the psychological factors associated with career success in futsal. The results showed that goalkeepers had the best psychological profile. Pivots and wing-pivots had less self-confidence than other players, while universal players had less stress control than players in all other positions. Furthermore, players whose training centred on decision-making developed more than other players in term of intelligence and creative actions.\nTechnical and Tactical Skills In general, coaches and scouts believe that athletes\u2032 technical and tactical abilities are a strong predictor of future performance. This is shown in several studies (Table 3) which provide relevant information for talent identification systems. The results show that futsal training can develop players\u2032 multifunctional athletes. The results also show\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 6 of 19\nthat some individual skills like dribbling, passing or receiving the ball are characteristics of elite futsal players [27\u201330]. Such characteristics are certainly intrinsically related to the environment and task constraints of the sport. In addition, elite players spent more time during matches sprinting, whereas semi-elite players recorded higher percentages of standing and walking [27].\nAnthropometric and Physiological Factors\nAs in other sports, anthropometric and physiological factors have been studied in relation to talent identification and development in futsal. The reviewed studies analyzed athletes\u2019 body composition, aerobic power, abdominal strength endurance, flexibility, leg strength, lower limb power, speed and agility [32] using various tests such as the counter movement jump test, t-test and repeated sprint ability test (Table 4). The reviewed studies have shown that anthropometric characteristics and physical abilities do not necessarily make a difference between players in the post-pubertal period and should not be overestimated during early development [34]. In terms of somatotype, results showed that the endomorphic component was predominant in relation to the mesomorphic and ectomorphic components, irrespective of a team\u2019s ranking at the end of a competition [35].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 7 of 19\n3.3.3. Environmental Constraints Relative Age Effect (RAE)\nRAE has been widely researched as a factor that may influence selection and talent identification in team sports [50]. This review highlighted some literature already analyzed in futsal (Table 5). Studies have shown an RAE in male futsal, predominantly on athletes born in the first and second quartiles, highlighting that the RAE is an influencing factor in talent identification and development [39\u201342]. In the most recent study included in this review, conducted in Portugal, data showed an RAE in female and male youth soccer, as well as in futsal, particularly among young males and in clubs and academies with a high certification level, which could be accompanied by a loss of valuable elite players during the youth phase of their careers [36].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 8 of 19\nSocio-Cultural Influences\nDespite the expected influence of the social environment on the identification and development of young athletes, only three studies exclusively have addressed this issue (Table 6). The results suggest that certain features of the built environment, such as indoor and outdoor play opportunities, may have less influence on talent development than previously thought [45]. The results also show that investment in an elite futsal career is critical to developing young athletes [48].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 9 of 19\n3.3.4. Multidimensional Analysis\nWhile most studies in this research area focused mainly on a single theme (Tables 7 and 8), some multidimensional studies (Table 9) examined the effects of various factors on talent identification and development, including technical and tactical performance, anthropometric characteristics, the specificity and amount of futsal-specific practice and RAE (Figure 2). The results revealed that (1) athletes born in the first months of the year showed longer practice times than those born in the later months of the year, (2) players with low levels of knowledge successfully performed some easy technical and tactical skills like open passes and (3) anthropometric characteristics and isolated skills do not predict match-related technical performance in elite adolescent players and should be used with caution for talent identification [18].\nInt.

Individuals selected by association at age 12 were predicted well above chance based on their sprint speed at age 9 or 10 [46]."

            "text": "Specificity and Amount of Practice\nThere is abundant research on this topic in other sports. In the last 25\u201330 years, Ericsson, Krampe [52] and Ericsson [53] postulated that sport-specific, coach-led deliberate practice was the only type of activity that effectively leads to expert performance. They advocated maximizing deliberate practice, which required the early intensification and subsequent continuous expansion of deliberate practice. A widely held view is that 10,000 h of deliberate practice\u2014highly structured activity with the specific goal of improving performance that require effort and are not inherently enjoyable [54]\u2014are necessary and sufficient to reach the expert level. In contrast, the experiences of many elite athletes included various youth sports activities in both coach-led, organized training (e.g., in sports clubs, highschool sports or sports academies) and peer-led, non-organized activities in the athlete\u2019s primary sport as well as in other sports. Some authors hypothesized that diversified experiences in youth may have favoured the later development of peak performance (e.g., C\u00f4t\u00e9, Baker [55]; Davids, G\u00fcllich [56]). One study included in our review indicates that elite players tend to start the practice of general sports and futsal earlier than lower-level players [21], revealing an interesting relationship between deliberate practice and the level of practice. Evidence from different sports demonstrates that early specialization is not the only way to reach expertise. Early diversification can also lead to elite performance, especially in sports in which performance peaks after biological maturity has been reached [57]. These two contrasting development pathway patterns\u2014early specialization (deliberate practice) and early diversification (deliberate play)\u2014have been discussed extensively in the literature [58]. Nevertheless, further studies are required in the context of futsal, as we found only one study on this topic in this sport.\n4.2. Performers\u2032 Constraints 4.2.1. Psychological Factors\nThe study of psychological factors related to peak performance typically addresses two main questions: (1) \u201cWhich psychological skills are required to achieve top performance?\u201d and (2) \u201cHow can these skills be developed in young athletes?\u201d [58]. Our results suggest that the most successful athletes have high levels of decisionmaking [18,20,47], creative actions [26] and concentration and reaction time [25]. Goalkeepers showed the best psychological profile and characteristics, pivots and wingers had less self-confidence than average and universal players had less stress control than players in other playing positions [23]. These findings are useful for monitoring improvements in training and game performance and for identifying necessary changes in practice regimens. The results reinforce previous results in other sports indicating that specific psychological abilities are necessary to become a high-level player [59], given that a player\u2019s aptitude will exert either a positive or a negative influence on their technical\u2013tactical and physical\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 13 of 19\nabilities [60]. Unfortunately, analyses of psychological aspects among futsal players are scarce, making it impossible to characterize the psychological abilities of futsal players [61]. In the field of soccer, the psychological profiles of Brazilian male and female professional soccer players were identified, along with their influence on the physical fitness of these players [62]. They concluded that certain psychological profiles (e.g., egocentricity, boldness, sensuality, insecurity, sensitivity, integrity and emotionality) could help players improve their performance in certain functions to solve problematic situations in the game, and that, there may be different responses to the same situation [63].\n4.2.2. Technical and Tactical Skills Tactical skills are a player\u2032s ability to perform timely actions to achieve a goal. Players with more expertise make better decisions [29]. Thus, the development of tactical skills seems crucial for achieving top-level performance in futsal. Although only a few studies (n = 5) have addressed the importance of technical and tactical skills in identifying and developing talent in futsal, there is a clear link between high performance and superior technical skills, including ball receptions with the sole of the boot, ball driving, dribbling, passing and shooting [23,24,26,27]. Research has also highlighted that elite players are two-footed [27]. Studies have identified characteristics of elite futsal match-play that are closely related to the environmental and task constraints of the sport. Similar to futsal, few studies in other sports have assessed sport-specific technical skills using a multidimensional approach. However, these skills predicted later performance in a range of sports, such as dribbling tests in field hockey [64]; swimming performance and ball-handling skills in water polo [65]; passing, dribbling, shooting and ball control skills in soccer [66]; and dribbling skills in handball [67]. In general, skill in futsal is based on several basic techniques\u2014including passing, holding the ball, dribbling and shooting\u2014which must be comprehended by every player [68]. Futsal players have to demonstrate these technical skills while being limited by space, the opponent and time [69]. Previous work on futsal has revealed that the spatial-temporal relations defined by the distances and angles between the ball carrier and the nearest defenders and by the distances and angles of defenders to the passing line are key pieces of information that guide players\u2032 passing and shooting actions [70\u201372]. Nevertheless, no studies have clearly revealed how manipulating the environment of play constrains players\u2032 learning. For this purpose, the ecological dynamics approach can offer theoretical guidance for coaches, sports scientists and practitioners to carefully design the microstructures of practice environments by manipulating task constraints [73].\n4.2.3. Anthropometric and Physiological Factors\nResearchers have attempted to describe the physiological characteristics of futsal players at different levels of competition and at different ages [74]. For example, Alvarez, D\u2019Ottavio [1] examined the aerobic fitness of futsal players of different competitive levels and found that VO2max could be a competitive-level-dependent physical variable in futsal. Pedro, Milanez [75], reported that running speed at the ventilatory threshold and maximal oxygen consumption discriminate the competitive level, with better performances exhibited by players with higher performance levels. Furthermore, Nakamura, Pereira [76] investigated the differences in physical performance between Brazilian U-20 and senior top-level futsal players, and reported that long-term exposure to futsal can improve aerobic fitness and cardiac autonomic regulation while impairing muscular strength and speed performance. Recently, Sekulic, Foretic [77] highlighted the importance of agility in determining the performance level of professional futsal players by using newly developed tests of the change of direction speed and reactive agility in competitive futsal players. Finally, the literature indicates that the performance levels of futsal players differ in terms of match running performance. Compared to sub-elite players, elite futsal players\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 14 of 19\ncover a greater total distance at higher intensities and perform more sprints during matchplay [78]. Overall, studies analyzing the influence of anthropometric and physiological factors on talent identification reveal that elite players display better levels of body fat percentage, aerobic power, abdominal strength, speed performance and lower limb power and lower limb strength [32]. In terms of somatotype, the endomorphic component was predominant in relation to the mesomorphic and ectomorphic components, irrespective of a team\u2019s ranking at the end of a competition [35]. In contrast, R\u00e9 et al. (2010) revealed that anthropometric characteristics and physical capacities do not necessarily differentiate players at post-pubertal stages and should not be overvalued during early development. Empirical and theoretical literature indicates that it is important to identify specific performance characteristics for a development program that is supported by appropriate procedures for monitoring and recapture late maturers. This will help sports clubs understand the types of characteristics they can identify and develop in young players."

            "text": "Several studies included in this review reported an RAE in female and male youth players from Portugal [36,39] and in male futsal players from Brazil [40\u201343]. However, a reverse RAE was observed in LNFS players from Spain [38]. These studies have shown that talent identification in futsal can be significantly affected by RAE, as coaches and scouts select the players who perform best at the time of selection, rather than the players who are the most long-term promise. A better understanding of RAE in youth players would raise the awareness of the need to reduce bias due to (de)selection [36]. In general, a birthdate closer to the beginning of the year (e.g., in the first three months) is associated with an athletic advantage, resulting in an over-representation of athletes born early in the year [79,80]. A wider appreciation of the athletic triangle, which comprises coaches, parents and athletes, as well as factors beyond the physical should be considered regarding the RAE [81]. This is particularly the case as data have demonstrated that the RAE is evident within prepubertal age groups, among which maturity-related factors should not be a contributing factor [82]. Researchers have studied the RAE in various team sports such as soccer [83], basketball [84], rugby [85], handball [86,87] and cricket [88]. The RAE has been shown to be a potential source of talent selection bias in different modalities [87]. Pre-established models give special importance to physical and conditioning variables. This might partially explain why relatively old players seem to perform better in the selection process than young players, leading to a higher selection success rate. The RAE has been extensively explored among male soccer players, but little is known about it in other contexts, such as female players and futsal athletes. Despite the popularity of futsal and the media coverage of major competitions, little research has been done on it, especially when compared to soccer. Further studies should consider the simultaneous influence of more than one constraint (e.g., influence of maturational status, criteria used for the selection of the players, philosophies of the clubs, etc.) that may arise from different sources using both research methods (qualitative and quantitative) to improve the understanding of RAE in futsal.\n4.3.2. Socio-Cultural Influences\nWhile it is well-accepted that several environmental factors influence the development of young athletes [89], few studies have addressed this topic exclusively in the context of futsal. Players who have experienced a fruitful social context and familial socialization facilitating \u2018ball-kicking capitals\u2019 tend to develop a habitus that is better suited for futsal than soccer [44]\u2014birthplace effect. Similar to this, it is suggested that the characteristics of an athlete\u2032s built environment, such as indoor and outdoor play opportunities, may be less influential in talent development than previously assumed [45]. A study on Brazilian\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 15 of 19\nfemale futsal players revealed four considerable points to consider in talent identification and development in futsal: diversified experiences in childhood, the initiation of kicking ball games practices, (c) systematic participation in futsal practices and (d) investment in an elite futsal career [48]. Additionally, a better understanding of family influence on talent development is needed\u2014namely, what support parents can provide to their children as futsal players and how parents can support futsal players at key transition points in their careers [58]. At the macro-structure level, more attention could be given to the management of school activities and futsal clubs. Soccer associations should consider what activities in the school day are conducive to talent development. Based on the available evidence, it appears that coaches and scouts should invest in players who are naturally strenuous, whose primary goal is personal performance improvement rather than pleasure and who often train without immediate reward\u2014deliberate practice. They should search for players who have a strong ability to make good decisions, act creatively, are focused and can react quickly, which is just as important as superior technical skills. In terms of physiological constrains, there seem to be adaptative traits that come from better levels of body fat percentage, aerobic power, abdominal strength, speed, lower limb power and lower limb strength. Finally, they should not give importance to RAE in the context of futsal, to achieve a higher success rate in selection. However, the research on this topic is not complete, as there are likely missing variables that future research could address, variables that may be more important than others, or athletes may compensate in one area when another skill is lacking between others. This systematic review of this sport is an attempt to continue to better understand and develop the game."

Based on the considerable number of studies on this topic reviewed in this paper, it was possible to identify the most frequently addressed topics in this area of research. These are (1) task constraints: (a) specificity and volume of practice; (2) performers\u2032 constraints: (a) psychological factors, (b) technical and tactical skills and (c) anthropometric and physiological factors; (3) environmental constraints: (a) RAE and (b) socio-cultural influences; and (4) multidimensional analysis (Figure 2). The main findings of this review were as follows. For task constraints, an important relationship was identified between deliberate practice and a player\u2032s level of success. Regarding performers\u2032 constraints, the most successful athletes express a strong capability to make decisions, take creative actions, concentrate and react quickly. They also exhibit superior technical skills and better levels of body fat percentage, aerobic power, abdominal strength, speed performance, lower limb power and lower limb strength. Nevertheless, anthropometric characteristics and physical capacities do not necessarily differentiate players at post-pubertal stages and should not be overestimated during early development, thereby reducing the bias of (de)selection. In terms of environmental constraints, talent identification in futsal can be significantly affected by the RAE. Thus, it is suggested that the characteristics of the built environment, such as indoor and outdoor play opportunities, are understudied\u2014just one study presented. Our results indicate a complex relationship between tactical, technical, anthropometric, maturational, physiological and psychological factors in futsal players. The complex interactions among these factors should help futsal coaches and fitness coaches objectively define how they identify talent and what training perspectives they use to promote a specific playing style.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10648 16 of 19\nOverall, talent identification and development programmes in futsal must be dynamic to provide opportunities for changing evaluation parameters in the long term. However, further studies are needed to improve knowledge on this research topic. For instance, longitudinal research needs to be done. In addition, future research should address the influence of genetic factors on the status of elite athletic. Developing a multidimensional analysis of how different elements interact to influence talent identification and development in futsal would also be worthwhile. Finally, further research is needed on the psychological and environmental aspects that influence talent development in futsal. Additionally, future complementary studies should include an evaluation of the current position in male futsal regarding talent, like it has been done in other sports [90]. It is hoped that this study will contribute to continue the actual promotion of male futsal in the world.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.S., B.T. and D.M.; methodology, H.S., B.T. and D.M.; formal analysis, D.M. and H.S.; investigation, D.M., B.T., F.C., I.C., J.M.C. and H.S.; writing original draft, D.M. and H.S.; preparation, D.M. and J.M.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.C., I.C., B.T. and H.S.
