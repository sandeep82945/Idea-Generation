Herein we describe a novel route to indole derivatives from a variety of N-substituted 2-alkenylanilines. This route features three operationally simple steps: (1) oxidation to convert N-substituted 2-alkenylanilines into epoxide intermediates, (2) intramolecular cyclization, and (3) the acid-catalyzed elimination of water. 1. conclusions In summary, we demonstrated an operationally simple and efficient method with which to synthesize 2-aryl-N-sulfonyl indoles (C1 substituted indoles) from 2-alkenylanilines. The chemical steps are few in number and are robust reactions that are tolerant of many functional groups. Our approach is novel in that it uses chemical reagents (mCPBA, NaHCO3, TFA, and CH2Cl2) that are relatively inexpensive and commonplace in synthetic laboratories. Additionally, the reagents are not air-sensitive, and the reactions are conducted at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. It is our hope that this method will find utility Molecules 2023, 28, 7968 14 of 14 in the synthesis of indoles and other heterocycles.
