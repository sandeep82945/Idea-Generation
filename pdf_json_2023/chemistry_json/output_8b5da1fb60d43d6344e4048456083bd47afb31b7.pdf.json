    "abstractText": "An invaluable utilization approach for industrial wastes is to employ them as effective adsorbents for environmental pollutants. This study aimed to investigate the phosphorus (P) adsorption behavior of coal wastes and zeolite in three forms of pristine powder (CP and ZP), nanoparticles (CNP and ZNP), and Fe (III)-modified nanoparticles (MCNP and MZNP). The adsorbents were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The effects of pH, initial P concentration, and contact time were studied under batch mode. Results showed an optimum pH range of 2\u20136 for the P adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm described the P adsorption data well. The P adsorption capacity of the studied adsorbents was enhanced after modifications. However, the coal-based modified adsorbents represented higher P adsorption performances rather than the zeolite ones. The maximum P adsorption capacity (Qmax) values were obtained as 0.36, 3.23, and 30.48 mg g 1 for CP, CNP, and MCNP, and 0.80, 2.84, and 6.99 mg g 1 for ZP, ZNP, and MZNP, respectively. The surface complexation, ligand exchange, and electrostatic attraction processes were identified as the main P adsorption mechanisms by the studied adsorbents.",

            "text": "Eutrophication is a global environmental concern that seriously threats aquatic ecosystems, and results in loss of biodiversity and large economic dissipations (Zhou et al. 2022). It occurs as a consequence of massive phosphorus (P) discharge into natural water resources through various anthropogenic activities including excessive use of agricultural compounds such as fertilizers and pesticides, paint industries, detergents, and various municipal wastes (Goscianska et al. 2018; Park et al. 2021). A maximum permissible range of 0.5\u20131 mg P L 1 has been established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in wastewater (Park et al. 2021). Hence, in the past few decades, efforts have been significantly made to control this essential element regarding water quality standards.\nSeveral physicochemical and biological techniques have been used to remove and recover P from wastewater and industrial effluents including electrochemical precipitation, filtration, ion exchange, and microbial degradation processes (Di Capua et al. 2022). Among them, adsorption has been developed as a promising water treatment strategy following its major advantages such as low cost and low energy requirements, simplicity, non-toxicity, and reversibility (Abdellaoui et al. 2021). Consequently, a large number of synthetic materials have been used for P adsorption including carbonized sludge (Zhang et al. 2018), calcium meta-silicate minerals (Obradovic\u0301 et al. 2017), iron-impregnated biochar (Lee et al. 2018), and layered double hydroxide-loaded biochar (Bolbol et al. 2019).\nRecently, a new comprehensive approach has been established based on the circular economy concept on the valorization of agricultural and industrial waste by-products by employing them as novel composite materials for environmental decontamination, particularly water resources restoration (Xu et al. 2022). In this context, various solid waste materials have been examined for P adsorption such as different biomass-derived biochars (Jung et al. 2015; Ngatia et al. 2017), zirconium-loaded orange waste (Biswas et al. 2008), and concrete powder (Liu et al. 2020). Most of them have represented considerable P removal performances regarding their favorable physicochemical and structural characteristics including high porosity, surface area, and mineral composition, as well as their cost-effectiveness and environmental friendship.\nCoal fly ash is one of the most important industrial by-products worldwide, which originates from the coal combustion process and is excreted in large quantities in the environment as a waste material, causing many environmental problems such as soil and water contamination, as well as waste management issues (Usman et al. 2022). From the sustainable management\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.068/1198732/wst2023068.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nperspective, several utilizing plans have been suggested for these waste materials such as using them in cement industry (Singh et al. 2019), rubber production (Ren & Sancaktar 2019), and other engineering or agricultural applications (Ahmaruzzaman 2010). In addition, effective recapture of P from wastewater can be considered an important alternative approach to utilize coal fly ash following its great potential to act as a P adsorbent.\nCoal solid wastes have recently received much attention by environmental researchers to be used in P removal reactions from aquatic environments. In this context, some efforts have been made to enhance their P removal efficiencies through different modification procedures such as pre-treatment with different metal ions, and impregnation in acidic or alkaline solutions (Wang et al. 2016a; Xu et al. 2022). However, limited research data regarding enhancement of their adsorption capacity through simultaneous application of physical and chemical modification methods are available. Since the adsorption functionality of a material depends largely on its size, shape, and surface morphology, its smaller size results in higher chemical reactivity. It can be achieved through size reduction of the coal wastes to nanoscales, creating new waste-based nanoadsorbents. On the other hand, chemical surface modification of these nano-adsorbents through embedding high P affinity metals such as Fe can increase their active surface adsorption sites and improve their P removal performance. Reusing coal solid wastes to remove phosphorus from water would be a novel scheme that synergistically supports waste management and environmental remediation issues. Hence, the present study was conducted to investigate the P removal efficiency of the coal solid wastes as an industrial adsorbent in the raw, nano-size, and Fe-modified forms in comparison with similar forms of zeolite as a well-known natural P adsorbent. The adsorbents were prepared, modified, and characterized using SEM-EDS, FTIR, and XRD instrumental analyses and their P adsorption performances were evaluated under batch conditions as affected by solution P concentration, pH, and contact time. Furthermore, the plausible mechanisms involved in the P adsorption processes were explored and discussed in detail regarding the obtained data."

The collected raw materials were powdered to pass through a 270-mesh size sieve, washed with DW several times to remove their impurities, and oven-dried at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h. The CNP and ZNP were prepared through physical modification (nano-size reduction) of the powdered particles using a Ball-mill for 10 h.

First, the CNP and ZNP particles were impregnated with 2 M NaOH and 1 M HCl, respectively, for 24 h, and after drying, they were added to 500 mL DW and the suspension pH was adjusted around 13. Then, a 0.5 M FeCl3 solution was added drop-wise into the stirring suspension until the pH value decreased to 5, and the suspension was allowed to precipitate for 24 h.

As can be seen, the CNP is dominantly composed of Si and Al oxides, and Quartz (SiO2) is the main mineral in its structure. The appearance of sharp and intense peaks around 2\u03b8 values of 21 and 27\u00b0 confirmed the significant presence of Quartz in the CNP structure. Moreover, Mullite (3Al2O3\u00b72SiO2) and Calcite (CaCO3) minerals were also identified in the CNP structure through the appearance of relatively broad and low intense peaks between 30\u201340\u00b0, and around 45\u00b0, respectively (Kobayashi et al. 2020). In the case of the MCNP pattern, the Quartz peaks have been removed or attenuated and instead, a Hematite (Fe2O3) mineral peak has emerged around 2\u03b8\u00bc 32\u00b0, which can be attributed to the successful loading of Fe atoms on the surfaces of the CNP. The Calcite peak has been also removed after modification of CNP with FeCl3, which can be explained by the dissolution of CaCO3 as a result of FeCl3 acidity (Wang et al. 2016a). The MZNP showed a similar XRD pattern to that of ZNP, indicating that the crystal structure of the natural zeolite was not destroyed after the reaction with FeCl3 (Kragovic\u0301 et al. 2012; Bahabadi et al. 2017).\nFigure 1(b) illustrates the FTIR spectra of the studied adsorbents. The broad absorption bands between 3,400 and 3,500 cm 1 in all adsorbent\u2019s spectra are signatures of \u2013OH stretching vibration, demonstrating the presence of water in the adsorbents structure or between their pores. The absorption band around 2,925 cm 1 in the MCNP spectrum refers to the asymmetric stretching vibration of a methylene group (\u2013C\u2013H), which appeared after modification of CNP with FeCl3. Also, the 1,447 cm 1 peak which has intensified after FeCl3 treatment was attributed to the bending vibration of the methylene group. In addition, the 1,614, 1,037, and 797 cm 1 absorption bands were found in the adsorbents FTIR spectra, referring to the O\u2013H, Si\u2013O, and Si\u2013O\u2013Si groups, respectively (Fazlzadeh et al. 2017). The Al(Si)\u2013O\u2013(Si)Al asymmetric stretching vibration which has intensified in the MCNP spectrum, indicated its zeolite-like surface chemistry as a consequence of alkaline conditions (NaOH treatment) before FeCl3 modification (Kobayashi et al. 2020). Moreover, the 1,632 cm\n1 band in the MZNP spectrum was related to the presence of the Fe\u2013OH group in the zeolite surface after treatment with FeCl3 (Tandon et al. 2013). The changes in surface morphologies of the adsorbents after modification with FeCl3 are displayed in Figure 2. It can clearly be seen that the CNP surface is comprised of irregular flakes, which are homogeneously covered by new rough particles after modification with FeCl3. These particles have originated from the FeCl3 hydrolysis and led the development of a porous aggregated morphology on the MCNP surface (Wang et al. 2016a). In addition, the results of EDS analyses showed an increase in the Fe peak in the MCNP spectrum compared with the CNP one, demonstrating the successful loading of Fe atoms on the MCNP\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.068/1198732/wst2023068.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nsurface. In the case of zeolite-based adsorbents, the tabular surface morphology of ZNP has been changed after modification with FeCl3, creating irregular clusters on the MZNP surface.

Figure 3(a) and 3(b) represents the effects of solution pH on the adsorption capacities of the studied adsorbents toward phosphorus in solution with an initial concentration of 300 mg L 1, an adsorbent dosage of 10 g L 1, and a contact time of 24 h. The studied adsorbents showed a highly pH-dependent P adsorption, and optimum pH ranges obtained around 2\u20134 for ZP, and 2\u20136 for CP, CNP, MCNP, ZNP, and MZNP. The adsorption capacities of the studied adsorbents did not significantly change in these pH ranges, while they decreased sharply with the increase in solution pH out of these ranges. For instance, the amounts of P adsorbed by MCNP and MZNP in the pH range of 2\u20136 were about 27 and 19 mg g 1, respectively, and they decreased to 12 and 12.7 mg g 1 with an increase in pH toward 10. This could be explained by the electrostatic mechanism involved in the P adsorption process. At low pH\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.068/1198732/wst2023068.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nranges, the protonated surfaces of the adsorbents cause an increase in their affinities for P ions in the solution, and in contrast, at high pH ranges, the P ions will be electrostatically repulsed from the adsorbents surfaces as a result of their negatively charged surfaces. Moreover, at high pH values, the OH ions in solution will compete with the P anions for the adsorbents surface sites, resulting in a decrease in P adsorption capacity. Similar results have been also reported for P adsorption by different adsorbents (Feizi & Jalali 2016; Wang et al. 2016b; Bolbol et al. 2019).\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.068/1198732/wst2023068.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nStudying the P speciation in solution as affected by pH provides useful information regarding the mechanisms involved in the P adsorption process. In the pH ranges between 2 and 6, the H2PO 4 anion is the predominant P species in the solution, which mainly participates in the P adsorption process through OH exchange mechanism, resulting in an inner-sphere complex formation on the adsorbent surface (Krishnan & Haridas 2008; Feizi & Jalali 2016). When increasing the pH toward 10, the secondary orthophosphate (HPO2 4 ) prevails in the solution and its higher adsorption free energy rather than the H2PO 4 , leads to a decrease in P adsorption (Chubar et al. 2005). The pHpzc refers to the pH value that the net surface charge of an adsorbent is zero, and the anion exchange capacity equals the cation exchange capacity (Sparks 2003). This means that in pH ranges lower than the pHpzc, the adsorbent has a net positive surface charge and it has more affinity to adsorb anions from the solution electrostatically. Accordingly, in pH ranges higher than the pHpzc, the adsorbent prefers the cations to adsorb. The higher pHpzc values imply that the charge balance occurs at higher pH values, and therefore, the adsorbent has a positive surface charge over a wider pH range (Feizi & Jalali 2016). Figure 3(c) and 3(d) displays the pHpzc determination curves for the studied adsorbents. As can be seen, the pHpzc of the CP, CNP, and MCNP are approximately coincided with each other around pH\u00bc 8, indicating that the physical and chemical modifications of coal waste particles did not affect their pHpzc. However, in the case of ZP, ZNP, and MZNP, the pHpzc points have been increased after modifications, so their pHpzc were obtained as 3.8, 5.8, and 6.5, respectively. Overall, the optimum pH range for P adsorption by the studied adsorbents was lower than their pHpzc and a decreasing trend was found in their P adsorption capacity toward pHpzc. This suggests that the P adsorption process by the studied adsorbents has an electrostatic nature."

The initial phase was rapid, but the removal rate decreased over time and reached equilibrium after 120 min. The P removal efficiencies were different for modified adsorbents in this time period and obtained as 18, 79, 16, and 58% for CNP, MCNP, ZNP, and MZNP, respectively. These results indicated that the physical (nano-scaling) and chemical (FeCl3) modifications have improved the P removal efficiencies of the adsorbents rather than their initial raw forms. Moreover, the higher P removal percent obtained for MCNP and MZNP was related to the presence of Fe particles on their matrix and their role in P adsorption enhancement (Xu et al. 2010). The initial rapid phase in the P removal process could be attributed to the single-layer adsorption of P on the surfaces of the studied adsorbents as a consequence of the electrostatic attraction of P anions in solution with the positively charged surfaces of the adsorbents. As time increases, the surface adsorption sites will be saturated with P anions, resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate and cause the adsorption process to reach equilibrium gradually (L\u00fc\u030c et al. 2013)."

Similarly, the P removal efficiencies for the MZNP, ZNP, and ZP reduced from 80 to 20, 26 to 5, and 6 to 1.4, respectively. At all initial P concentrations, the removal efficiencies of the modified adsorbents were higher than those of the raw materials. However, the MCNP represented a higher performance to remove aqueous P rather than the MZNP, so in 50 mg P L 1 concentration, their removal efficiencies were obtained as 100 and 80%, respectively. The descending trend in the P removal process with the P concentration in solution could be explained by the ratio of the available active sites on the adsorbent\u2019s surfaces to the number of adsorptive P anions in the solution. In lower P concentrations, this ratio has higher values and the P species in solution have the most interaction with the surface functional groups of the adsorbents, resulting in higher P removal percentages. With increasing the P concentration in solution, the P removal rate will be decreased as a consequence of the surface adsorption sites saturation (Wang et al. 2012)."

As the given graphs illustrate, the Langmuir and Freundlich models have described the P adsorption process better than the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich one. However, the R2 and SE values show that the Langmuir model is better fitted to the P adsorption data. Considering the Langmuir model assumptions, these results could be explained by the monolayer P adsorption on the surface adsorption sites with similar levels of adsorption energy. The maximum P adsorption capacities predicted with this model were obtained as 0.36 and 0.80 mg g 1 for CP and ZP adsorbents, respectively. While the modified adsorbents showed higher P adsorption capacities as 3.23 and 30.48 mg g 1 for the CNP and MCNP, and 2.84 and 6.99 mg g 1 for ZNP and MZNP, respectively. Moreover, the values of the Langmuir constant (Kl) demonstrating the bonding energy in the P adsorption process were higher for the modified adsorbents compared with the raw materials, implying their higher affinities for P adsorption, resulting in longer retention of P by the modified adsorbents and decreasing their P desorption rate (Jung et al. 2015; Bolbol et al. 2019). Moreover, the 1/n values obtained for the studied adsorbents were all lower than 1, demonstrating the non-linearity in the Freundlich isotherm which commonly occurs for adsorbents with a limited adsorption capacity.\nThe FeCl3 modification showed higher performance in the case of coal-based adsorbents rather than the natural zeolite nanoparticles. As can be deduced from Table 1, the modification of CNP with FeCl3 has enhanced its P adsorption capacity 10-fold (from 3.23 to 30.48 mg g 1), while in the case of ZNP, a 2.5-fold increase is observed (from 2.84 to 6.99 mg g 1). Krishnan & Haridas (2008) reported a five to six times increase in P adsorption capacity (Qmax\u00bc 70.92 mg g 1) by the Fe-modified coir pith rather than the native one, and related it to the cation bridge effect of Fe cations on the adsorbent surface. In another study on the native and FeCl3-modified plant residues, Feizi & Jalali (2016) reported an approximately 2.5-fold increase in P adsorption capacity after modification of the adsorbents with Fe. They obtained Qmax values of 2.8, 4.3, 4, and 3.7 mg g 1 for native sunflower, potato, canola, and walnut shell residues, while these values were increased to 6.6, 9, 8.4, and 9 mg g 1, after Fe modification, respectively. Wang et al. (2012) also studied the P removal from an aqueous solution using two series of activated carbons modified by Fe (II) and Fe (III) and reported 14.12 and 8.73 mg g 1 Qmax values, respectively.

The higher K2 values in the pseudo-second-order model which refer to the rate constant also confirmed the effect of physical and chemical modifications on the P adsorption enhancement (Table 3).\nThe basis of the intra-particle diffusion kinetic model is to determine the diffusion rate of the adsorbate toward the adsorbent at the liquid\u2013solid interface, which can be investigated by plotting the Qt values against the square root of the contact time (t0.5) (Weber & Morris 1963).

First, the P anions in bulk solution move to the film surrounding the adsorbent following the diffusion gradient and diffuse along it toward the adsorbent surface. Then the adsorption process gradually continues through an intra-particle mass transfer of P anions into the macro pores of the adsorbent, and finally, the physical or chemical adsorption reaction occurs depending on the surface reactivity (Wang et al. 2012). The final equilibrium occurs as a result of reduction in P concentration in solution, diffusion of P into micro-pores of the adsorbent, and electrostatic repulsion of P from the adsorbent surface.\nModeling the P adsorption kinetic data using the intra-particle diffusion model showed a two-phase diagram that did not cross the origin, demonstrating two or more rate-limiting steps in the P adsorption process by all of the studied adsorbents (Figure 8). The Kp and C constants representing the intra-particle diffusion rate and the boundary layer thickness were calculated from the slope and intersection of the second linear phases of the obtained diagrams, respectively (Table 3). It was observed that higher Kp values for the FeCl3-modified adsorbents compared with the raw materials, suggesting the increasing effects of surface-loaded Fe on the intra-particle diffusion mechanism in the P adsorption process. Additionally, the C-value increased from 0.098 to 17.88 in raw and modified coal waste particles, and from 0.032 to 5.882 in natural and modified zeolite, respectively. These results could be attributed to the greater role of external diffusion film in the rate-limiting step after modification of the adsorbents with Fe, resulting in a thicker boundary layer (Olgun et al. 2013)."

The Langmuir equation described the isothermal data well, with a 4-fold maximum P adsorption capacity for MCNP (30.48 mg g 1) rather than the MZNP (6.99 mg g 1). These values demonstrated the higher potential of the coal waste materials to be used as P adsorbents rather than the zeolite ones. The kinetic data were explained by the pseudo-secondorder model, implying the chemisorption mechanism involved in the P adsorption process. Besides the surface complexation,\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.068/1198732/wst2023068.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nligand exchange and electrostatic attraction were also found as effective mechanisms contributed to the P adsorption process. It can be concluded from the findings of the present study that coal waste materials are great choices to be used as invaluable P adsorbents regarding their desirable adsorption properties, suggesting a win-win paradigm supporting the sustainable management of waste materials as well as environmental protection disciplines."
