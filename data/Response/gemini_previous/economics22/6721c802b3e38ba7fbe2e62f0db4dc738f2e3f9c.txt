1. **Investigate the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in Poland.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that follows a cohort of people over time to assess changes in their mental health before, during, and after the pandemic. This would help to determine whether the increased rates of mental health problems observed during the pandemic are temporary or whether they will persist in the long term.


2. **Explore the factors that contributed to the increase in sick leave notes for psychiatric reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic.** This could be done by conducting qualitative interviews with patients and healthcare providers to understand their experiences during the pandemic. This information could be used to develop interventions to address the factors that are contributing to the increase in mental health problems.


3. **Examine the relationship between the consumption of antidepressants and antianxiety medication and the incidence of mental health problems in Poland.** This could be done by conducting a case-control study that compares people with mental health problems to people without mental health problems to determine whether there is a difference in their use of antidepressants and antianxiety medication. This information could be used to inform guidelines for the use of these medications in the treatment of mental health problems.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions for preventing and treating mental health problems in Poland.** This could be done by conducting randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of different interventions, such as psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. This information could be used to develop evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of mental health problems.


5. **Develop and implement policies and programs to improve mental health care in Poland.** This could include increasing funding for mental health services, expanding access to care, and reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. These policies and programs could help to improve the mental health of the Polish population and reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals, families, and society.
