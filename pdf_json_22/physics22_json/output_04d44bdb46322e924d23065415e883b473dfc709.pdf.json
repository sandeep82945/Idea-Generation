Because nanomechanical systems are small, fluctuations are significant, the vibrations become nonlinear already for comparatively small amplitudes, and new mechanisms of dissipation come into play. At the same time, the exquisite control of these systems makes them a platform for studying many problems of classical and quantum physics far from thermal equilibrium in a well-characterized setting. This review describes, at a conceptual level, basic theoretical ideas and explicative experiments pertaining to mesoscopic physics of nanomechanical systems. Major applications of nanomechanics in science and technology are also outlined. A broad range of phenomena related to the conservative as well as dissipative nonlinearity and fluctuations are discussed within a unifying framework. They include the linear response of single and coupled vibrational modes as well as nonlinear effects of periodic driving. Such driving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and the detailed balance, with conspicuous consequences for fluctuations, particularly in the presence of the driving-induced bi- and multistability. Mathematical techniques are described in the appendices to streamline the reading, but also to provide an introduction to the theory. The goal of the review is to show the richness of the physics at work.

INTRODUCTION\nStudying vibrational motion has been one of the major areas of physics at least since Galileo. The advent of\nnanomechanical vibrational systems (NVSs) has opened\n3 a new direction in these studies. NVSs are resonators for mechanical vibrations. To picture an example, one can think of a string of a musical instrument downscaled to a diameter . 100 nm and a submicron length. The vibration frequencies range from kilohertz to gigahertz and can be tuned not only through the dimensions and the shape of a device, but also in situ by electrostatic and optical means. In addition, the lifetime of vibrations has now been increased to hundreds of seconds and above thanks to progress in nanofabrication.\nBy their nature NVSs are mesoscopic. Because they are small, they display many features of microscopic systems. At the same time, they are sufficiently large to enable studying an individual vibrational system rather than resorting to ensemble measurements, as in conventional molecular or solid-state vibrational spectroscopy.\nNVSs were developed in the 1990\u2032s [1, 2] and quickly attracted interest. Their vibrational eigenmodes display rich dynamics that involves a broad range of many-body effects stemming from the coupling to electrons, propagating phonons, photons, and two-level fluctuators. They are also of significant interest for various applications, which range from ultrasensitive mass, charge, and force detection to clocks. For example, the adsorption of mass onto an NVS can be detected with a resolution approaching 1 yg, while a force can be resolved with a sensitivity approaching 1 zN/Hz1/2. Over the years different aspects of the studies of NVSs along with their applications have been reviewed in a number of papers and books [3\u20139].\nIn this review, we focus on the mesoscopic physics of NVSs, including dissipation, fluctuations, and nonlinear and far from thermal equilibrium phenomena in these systems. While these basic physical phenomena have been intensely investigated during the last few years, they have not yet been reviewed from a general perspective. Our aim is to provide a coherent and unifying description of the underlying concepts along with the experimental and theoretical results and to put them into a broad physics context. Details of the mathematical techniques are provided in Appendices.\nWe describe dissipation and thermal fluctuations of nanomechanical vibrations as resulting from the coupling to a thermal reservoir of a general form. Such description applies to both flexural and localized compression/sheartype modes. It allows us to analyze various specific dissipation mechanisms. They include the Landau-Rumer, Akhiezer, and thermoelastic relaxation due to scattering by propagating phonons and the phonon-induced clamping losses, as well as relaxation associated with the electrons in the nanoresonators and the leads and with the two-level systems.\nA consequence of the small size of NVSs expected from the general arguments of statistical physics is the occurrence of comparatively strong quantum and classical fluctuations. These fluctuations play a significant role in the vibration dynamics. Another important aspect of the dynamics is the vibration nonlinearity. Because of the small system size, vibrations with even compara-\ntively small amplitudes become nonlinear. Not only the restoring force displays nonlinearity, but also the rate of dissipative losses becomes amplitude dependent, which is associated with nonlinear friction.\nThe exquisite control of the NVSs and their versatility make them invaluable as a tool for studying the interplay of nonlinearity and fluctuations. This interplay leads to a broad range of phenomena that manifest themselves in different settings, both in the classical and quantum domains. Revealing and understanding them is an ongoing effort. We describe several of these phenomena studied with the NVSs, including the nondissipative broadening of the vibration spectra, nonlinear inter-mode energy exchange, and self- and cross-modulation of the vibration frequencies.\nWe also describe how the nonlinearity makes NVSs vibrations a testing ground for exploring nonequilibrium phenomena. Several general types of such phenomena emerge where the vibrations are driven by a resonant field. Because the decay rates of the vibrations are usually small, even a weak field can lead to a significantly nonequilibrium behavior, such as the occurrence of bi- and multistability or chaos. Of particular interest, which goes beyond NVSs as such, are fluctuation effects away from thermal equilibrium. They range from noiseinduced switching between coexisting metastable vibrational states to fluctuation squeezing. Since, on the one hand, driven nonlinear vibrations lack detailed balance while, on the other hand, the vibrations of NVSs are wellcharacterized, these vibrations provide a unique opportunity for addressing many generic problems of quantum and classical statistical physics far from thermal equilibrium."

            "text": "We will describe the dynamics of an NVS mode in terms of the coordinate q and momentum p of an oscillator. The mechanical displacement in the mode u(r, t) as a function of the coordinate r has a spatial profile \u03d5(r), whereas q(t) describes how the displacement varies in time,\nu(r, t) = q(t)\u03d5(r),\n\u02c6 \u03d52(r)dr = V, (1)\nwhere V is the volume of the resonator. The momentum of the oscillator is p = Mq\u0307, where M is the oscillator mass, M = \u00b4 \u03c1(r)\u03d52(r)dr [\u03c1(r) is the mass density]. Functions \u03d5(r) for different modes are orthogonal. We note that in the analysis of the experimental data there is sometimes used a different normalization, i.e., it is set that max |\u03d5(r)| = 1. With this normalization, the maximal value of q(t) is the displacement amplitude.\n4 The simplest theoretical model employed in the study of nanomechanical modes is a classical harmonic oscillator that performs Brownian motion [10], with a friction force proportional to the velocity and with fluctuations due to thermal noise. The noise is assumed to be Gaussian and \u03b4-correlated in time. If the oscillator coordinate is q and the mass is M , the motion is described by the Langevin equation\nMq\u0308 + 2M\u0393q\u0307 +M\u03c920q = fT (t),\n\u3008fT (t)fT (t\u2032)\u3009 = 4M\u0393kBT\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032). (2)\nHere \u03c90 is the mode eigenfrequency and \u0393 is the friction coefficient, which determines the decay rate of the vibrations in the absence of noise.\nWithout noise, the model of a damped oscillator has been long used in physics; for example, it was used by Lorentz in 1878 to describe the polarizability of matter. Later it was realized that, along with the friction, there comes noise; both of them result from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal reservoir (thermal bath), see Fig. 1. The microscopic analysis was started by Einstein and Hopf [11]. A detailed classical study was performed by Bogolyubov [12], whereas the studies of the quantum dynamics were started in the late 50s - early 60s, see [13\u2013 19]; more references can be found in the paper by Ford et al. [20]. In many of these papers there was used a model in which the thermal bath was described by a set of harmonic oscillators and the coupling to the considered oscillator was linear in q. Over the years, such model of the bath, often called \u201cbosonic bath\u201d, has been one of the most frequently used in the study of quantum relaxation, cf. [21\u201323].\nNVSs are one of the best examples of systems where dissipation described by the linear in q coupling to a bosonic bath can play an important role. In this case, the bath is often formed by phonons in the resonator and in its support. Different mechanisms of the phononinduced dissipation, such as clamping losses, thermoelastic, Landau-Rumer, and Akhiezer dissipation are discussed in Sec.V A. Nonlinear in q coupling to a bosonic bath can also play a major role in the NVSs dynamics.\nThe most common way of characterizing the dynamics of NVSs is based on measuring either the spectral density of fluctuations of the displacement\nS(\u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e \u2212\u221e dt\u3008q(t)q(0)\u3009 exp(i\u03c9t) (3)\nor the susceptibility \u03c7(\u03c9), which characterizes the response to an external force at frequency \u03c9. It is defined by the relation between the force-induced displacement \u03b4q(t) and the force F exp(\u2212i\u03c9t) added to the right-hand side of Eq. (2) as\n\u3008\u03b4q(t)\u3009 = \u03c7(\u03c9)F exp(\u2212i\u03c9t). (4)\nThe susceptibility and the spectral density of fluctuations are related by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,\np\nM\u03c90\n0\n0\nbath\n\u0393\n1/\u0393\nt\nt\nq\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) 2\u03c0/\u03c90\nFIG. 1. (a) Mechanical oscillator coupled to a thermal bath. The coupling is quantified by the rate \u0393 for an oscillator quantum to be transferred into the bath. The parameter \u0393 enters both the friction force and the noise intensity in Eq. (2). (b,c) Time evolution of the displacement and the momentum of the oscillator performing Brownian motion. The characteristic correlation time of the amplitude fluctuations is given by 1/\u0393. One can measure \u0393 using the spectral density of the displacement fluctuations; \u0393 is the half width at half maximum of the spectral peak, see Eq. (5).\nsee Sec. IV, with Im \u03c7(\u03c9) = (\u03c9/kBT )S(\u03c9) in the classical limit. In addition, the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility, Re \u03c7(\u03c9) and Im \u03c7(\u03c9), are related by the Kramers-Kro\u0308nig relation [24]; Re \u03c7(\u03c9) and Im \u03c7(\u03c9) determine, respectively, the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the force-induced displacement, whereas |\u03c7(\u03c9)| determines the displacement amplitude.\nOf particular interest for NVSs is the situation where the oscillator decay rate \u0393 is small compared to the eigenfrequency \u03c90. In this case both S(\u03c9) and Im \u03c7(\u03c9) have sharp resonant peaks at frequency \u03c90. From Eq. (2) we find that near \u03c90 both functions have a Lorentzian peak,\nS(\u03c9) = kBT\nM\u03c920\n\u0393\n\u03932 + (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)2 ,\n\u03c7(\u03c9) = i 2M\u03c90 [\u0393\u2212 i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)]\u22121, |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90| \u03c90. (5)\nMeasuring the position and the halfwidth of the peak of S(\u03c9) and/or Im \u03c7(\u03c9) is commonly used to determine \u03c90 and \u0393. It thus enables finding the quality factor Q, which characterizes the energy relaxation and is conventionally defined as the ratio of the stored vibrational energy to the energy dissipated per cycle multiplied by 2\u03c0,\nQ = 2\u03c0 stored energy dissipated energy per cycle \u2192 \u03c90 2\u0393 . (6)\nThis factor is independent of the vibration amplitude, for a linear mode.\nA central role in the dynamics of NVS modes is played by the fluctuations of the mode eigenfrequencies. Such\n5 fluctuations can arise, for example, from the fluctuations of the resonator mass due to attachment or detachments of molecules, fluctuations of the spring constant due to charge and voltage fluctuations in the system, as well as from the interplay of the thermal fluctuations of the amplitude and the vibration nonlinearities. These frequency fluctuations increase the halfwidth of the spectral peak of S(\u03c9) and Im \u03c7(\u03c9) and, generally, can change the shape of the spectrum. Therefore it is convenient to introduce an effective quality factor\nQ\u03c9 = \u03c90/2\u2206\u03c9. (7)\nThe parameter \u2206\u03c9 takes into account frequency fluctuations and replaces the decay rate \u0393 in the standard expression (6). We use two different symbols, Q and Q\u03c9, to emphasize this difference. Factor Q\u03c9 does not describe energy relaxation but refers to the results of spectroscopic measurements. The physics behind frequency fluctuations is fairly rich and will be discussed at length in the review. However, to set the scene, in this section we will not consider them and will set Q = Q\u03c9. In Tables II\u2013IV we provide the reported values of the quality factor in several types of nanomechanical systems."

            "text": "The first practical nanomechanical system was based on a silicon nanobeam [1, 2]. Since then a variety of nanomechanical resonators has been explored. Tables II and III summarize the characteristics of resonators based on low-dimensional materials, such as carbon nanotubes, semiconductor nanowires, graphene, semiconductor layered membranes, and levitating particles. Table IV summarizes those of resonators nanofabricated from bulk material using the top-down approach. In many of these examples the vibrational modes correspond to bending (flexural) modes of the resonator, a microscopic analog of the vibrations of a string or a membrane. Carbon nanotubes are the narrowest resonators; their diameters range typically between 1 and 3 nm. Graphene and semiconductor monolayers are the thinnest membranes as they are atomically thin. Other types of vibrational modes are investigated, such as torsional modes in mechanically based torque resonators [25], the bulk (Lame\u0301) modes in micromechanical resonators [26] and layered nanomaterial resonators [27], and the localized modes in optomechanical crystals, see [28, 29] and references therein.\nAdvances in fabrication have led to a steady improvement of the quality factor of the NVSs. Optimizing the surface of resonators turned out to be central. The microscopic nature of the dissipation due to surface defects is not clear, but it might be related to additional relaxation channels that open due to the surface contamination and the degradation of crystallinity near the surface. In particular, the quality factor of mechanical res-\nonators based on nanotube and graphene becomes extremely large at cryogenic temperature [30], reaching the range between one and ten million [31\u201333]. The demonstration of such large quality factors came as a surprise. For many years, researchers observed that quality factors would decrease with the volume of the resonator, and because of this trend it was unthinkable that nanotubes and graphene resonators could exhibit such giant quality factors. The large Q-factors reflect the high crystallinity of these nanoscale systems and show that surface contamination is reduced to a minimal amount.\nLevitating particles feature large quality factors, up to 100 million, even at room temperature [34]. In many experiments, the particles are trapped by a laser beam; the resonance frequency is given by the optical gradient force. Damping, which arises from collisions with the gas molecules in the sample chamber, becomes very low in high vacuum. Recently, particles have been levitated using new schemes, including ferromagnetic particles in Meissner traps made from superconducting materials [35, 36], diamagnetic particles in magnetic traps [37, 38], and charged particles in Paul traps [39, 40].\nHigh-stress silicon nitride is the material used by many groups to produce top-down resonators endowed with high quality factors [41\u201349]. Dissipation in the bulk of this high-stress material is remarkably low. The quality factor can be further enhanced by structuring high-stress silicon nitride films into trampoline geometries [50, 51] and nonuniform phononic crystal pattern [52, 53]. Engineering the shape of mechanical eigenmodes enables reducing losses near their supports. Quality factors as high as 800 million can be achieved at room temperature [53] and 1.5 billion at 30 mK [54].\nAn important role in studying nonlinear phenomena and the effects of mode coupling has been played by single- and coupled nanoresonators based on narrow nanowires grown by electrodeposition [55], thin nanofabricated structures [56], and suspended GaAs and AlN heterostructures that exploit piezoelectric effect to actuate and control the vibrations [57\u201362]."

            "text": "The most straightforward way to excite nanomechanical resonators is by driving them with a directly applied force at an angular frequency \u03c9F close to the eigenfrequency \u03c90. Due to nonlinearity of the system, such a direct drive can also efficiently excite vibrations when \u03c9F ' \u03c90 \u00b7N or \u03c9F ' \u03c90/N with an integer N > 1, but their amplitude is usually smaller for the same drive amplitude [113]. Another method that is often employed consists in modulating the spring constant [114, 115]. Such parametric driving is equivalent to the modulation of the resonant frequency. It is most efficient when the drive frequency is close to 2\u03c90. The vibration amplitude is very nonlinear in the amplitude of the parametric drive; the amplitude remains small until the driving amplitude\nreaches a threshold value, after which the resonator vibrates at half the drive frequency\nThe actuation of a nanoscale resonator was achieved for the first time with the magnetomotive drive (Fig. 2a) [1, 2]. In this method, flexural vibrations of a conducting nanobeam are excited by the Lorentz force, which emerges when an alternating current is applied through the nanowire placed in a perpendicular magnetic field. The vibrations are detected by measuring the electromotive force generated along the length of the nanobeam using a network analyzer.\nA widely used drive is the capacitive force, see Fig. 2b [114]. It is implemented by applying a static voltage V DCg and an oscillating voltage with a comparatively low amplitude \u03b4V ACg between the resonator and a nearby gate electrode. The force is\nFAC = C \u2032gV DC g \u03b4V AC g (8)\nwhere C \u2032g \u2261 \u2202Cg/\u2202q is the derivative of the gate-\nresonator capacitance with respect to the mode displacement q. As a rough estimate, C \u2032g is given by the ratio of the capacitance to the characteristic distance between the resonator and the gate. For simplicity, we omit the work function difference between the resonator and the gate electrode in Eq. (8), which leads to an offset in V DCg . This driving force is effective when the resonator is an electrical conductor or is covered with a metal plate. A resonator made of a dielectric material can be driven by applying an electric field gradient between two electrodes structured near the resonator (Fig. 2c) [44]. A dielectric material in vacuum moves towards the region with highest electric field. This dielectric force has the same origin as the capacitive force, since they are both related to the displacement-induced electrostatic energy gain of a capacitor. When the resonator is made of a piezo-electric material, a piezo-electric force is created by applying an electric field between two electrodes, which are usually patterned on the resonator itself (Fig. 2d) [57, 58].\nOptical drive is also frequently used (Fig. 2e).\nPhotothermal forces are straightforward to apply to nanoscale resonators. One needs simply to modulate the intensity of the laser focused on the resonator. Absorption-induced heating displaces the resonator through thermal expansion [81]. Care has to be\ntaken if one wants to keep the resonator temperature low. This requires weak absorption. When the absorption is sufficiently suppressed, the force from the heating is overcome by the force traditionally associated with radiation pressure that comes from the reflection of photons by the\nresonator. This force is often small, but it has the advantage of not causing heating. It is used in quantum optomechanics experiments where losses are detrimental to the manipulation of quantum states [7]. Various optical excitation protocols developed by now enable driving different types of NVS vibrations, including the vibrations localized at defects in phononic optomechanical crystals, see [29] and references therein.\nMagnetic forces are usually used in magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments to detect electron and nuclear spins [116]. In some of these experiments, the spins located on the mechanical resonators are periodically flipped using magnetic resonance techniques; the associated time-modulated magnetic moment together with the magnetic field gradient of a nearby magnet results in an oscillating force (Fig. 2f). Alternatively, the magnet is placed on the mechanical resonator and the spins on the surface of a chip."

Through nonlinear elasticity, such a change modifies the mechanical tension in the resonator. This effect leads to an increase of the frequency. The mechanism is broadly used with the capacitive force for frequency control in soft resonators, such as carbon nanotubes [65, 120, 121]. Piezo-actuators can also be used to tune \u03c90 by enhancing the separation between the supports of a doubly clamped resonator; using this technique, the eigenfrequency of a carbon nanotube could be increased more than 20 times [122].\nTime-dependent frequency control is important for various applications, such as parametric drive. In the case of frequency control with the capacitive force, the eigenfrequency can be modulated in time using a combination of dc and ac gate voltages [114]. An alternative and highly efficient approach is based on time-dependent piezo-electric actuation [62]."

The most broadly used methods are based on magnetomotive, capacitive, and optical or microwave measurements. Other methods include piezo-electric [57, 58], piezo-resistive [123, 124], scanning probe microscopy [125], scanning and transmission electron microscopy [126\u2013128], and fieldemission [120] measurements.\nThe capacitive method relies on the motion-induced modulation of the capacitance \u03b4Cg between a conducting resonator and a nearby gate. Modulation of the capacitance in the presence of a gate voltage V DCg leads to the charge modulation \u03b4Q = \u03b4Cg \u00b7V DCg . Where the vibrating resonator acts as a field-effect transistor, its conductance oscillates as \u03b4G = \u2202G\u2202Q\u03b4Q. This causes a change of the current through the resonator \u03b4I = \u03b4G \u00b7 \u03b4Vsd in response to a voltage \u03b4Vsd applied across it. When \u03b4Vsd is oscillating at frequency \u03c9sd close to \u03c90, the current can be conveniently measured at a low-frequency \u2248| \u03c9sd \u2212 \u03c90 |. This method was first applied to a GaAs resonator supporting a single-electron transistor made of aluminium [129] and to nanotube resonators [65, 130]. Yet another way to\nmeasure the oscillating capacitance is based on embedding a conducting nanoresonator into a superconducting cavity and measuring its radio-frequency reflection and transmission [88, 131\u2013135]. A similar method can be used with a dielectric resonator by integrating it with a nearby electric cavity [136].\nIn the optical frequency range, high-precision vibration detection is often based on interferometry. Vibrations of a nanoresonator embedded in an optical cavity can be detected from the modulation of the resonant frequency of the cavity measured by its transmission or reflection [7]. Another method is based on focusing a laser beam onto the resonator and detecting the modulation of the reflected or scattered light [77, 137, 138]. Here we describe in more details optical detection of the vibrations of graphene-based resonators, a method used by many groups to detect vibrations of monolayer- and few-layer systems [139]. The laser beam illuminates a graphene membrane suspended over a metal gate. When the graphene monolayer is covered by an adsorbed contamination layer, an optical cavity is created between the monolayer and the gate, and the vibrations modulate this cavity. In contrast, in the case of a clean monolayer, a standing wave is formed by the interfering incident and reflected laser beams with the reflection from the metal gate. A clean graphene monolayer does not affect the standing wave much, since its reflection coefficient is small. In contrast, the absorption coefficient of graphene is about 0.02 for visible light, which is a remarkably large value considering that the material is only one atom thick. The displacement of the graphene layer changes the absorbed intensity. Therefore, the motion of the graphene resonator can be measured by recording the reflected light intensity.\nOptical detection of micro-mechanical systems has attracted much interest in the context of improving the sensitivity of LIGO detectors of gravitational waves, as these detectors are also based on vibrational systems. One of the important challenges is reducing the photon counting noise and the photon radiation pressure noise. It can be addressed using squeezed states of light, and the experimental results on measuring a micromechanical membrane with squeezed light have been recently reported [140]."

An important approach is based on illuminating an optical or a microwave cavity that contains a nanoresonator and measuring the spectrum of the emitted radiation. This spectrum contains lines shifted from\n10\nthe incident light frequency by the frequency of the vibrational mode. The ratio of the intensities of the lower- and higher-frequency lines, i.e., of the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, is determined by the effective temperature of the mode [7, 141\u2013148]. A detailed information about the vibrational quantum state of mechanical modes can be obtained by connecting these modes to a qubit [149\u2013 152].\nMechanical resonators in the quantum regime open new directions of research, including quantum squeezing of the mechanical motion [153\u2013155], measurementbased quantum control of mechanical motion [156, 157], quantum backaction evading measurements [158\u2013160], entanglement between mechanical resonators [161\u2013165], and fundamental measurements with levitating particles cooled to the ground state [148, 166, 167]."

There are two major approaches to measuring the spectral response. One of them is based on applying an oscillating force to the resonator, sweeping the frequency of the force, and measuring the displacement of the resonator with a lock-in amplifier. This gives the mechanical susceptibility, \u03c7(\u03c9), as discussed in Sec.

The power spectrum is measured by simply feeding the output signal of the resonator detector into a spectrum analyser. In practice, the power spectrum is often more difficult to measure than the spectrum of response to a periodic drive, especially when no care is taken to reduce the technical noise in the measurement circuit.

The linear response of the displacement q(t) to an external force F cos\u03c9t is given by the mechanical susceptibility \u03c7(\u03c9). If the noise is disregarded, the force-induced displacement increment is \u03b4q(t) = Re[\u03c7(\u03c9)F exp(\u2212i\u03c9t)]. The detection of an oscillating force is optimized by matching its frequency to the mechanical eigenfrequency, where |\u03c7(\u03c9)| is maximal.\nThe measured displacement is a superposition of the displacement induced by the force and thermal vibrations, i.e., a superposition of the signal and noise, respectively (Fig. 4a). The fundamental limit of force sensing is set by the condition that the signal exceeds the thermal noise. Quantitatively, this limit can be characterized by noting that, by its meaning, the power spectrum of the mode S(\u03c9) is the mean-square thermal displacement at frequency \u03c9 per unit frequency. At the same time, it follows from the definition of the susceptibility \u03c7(\u03c9), Eq. (4), that the squared displacement induced by a regular force F cos\u03c9t and averaged over the force period is (\u03b4q)2 = |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2F 2/2. The ratio of these displacements SF (\u03c9) = 2S(\u03c9)/|\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 shows how strong should the force be so that it be can be detected with a signal-tonoise ratio equal to 1.\nThe ratio SF (\u03c9) takes a particularly simple form in the important case where the power spectrum of the vibrations has a Lorentzian peak at the vibration eigenfrequency \u03c90 with halfwidth \u2206\u03c9 \u03c90, see Sec.

Such broad-band force sensing is somewhat non-intuitive, given that the force response of the displacement is strongly frequency-dependent. We emphasize that force sensing can be comparatively broadband even for high-Q resonators. Forces with frequencies far away from other resonances, can be detected provided that thermal noise and imprecision noise in the displacement detection are low enough.\nEquation (11) suggests a strategy for detecting tiny forces. The best force sensitivity has been achieved with carbon nanotubes, which are the operating resonators with the smallest mass, \u221a SF = (4.3\u00b12.9)\u00d710\u221221N/ \u221a Hz [168]. Resonators based on silicon carbide nanowires can reach \u221a SF = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221220N/ \u221a Hz [169]. Resonators microfabricated from bulk material are often more handy to use as sensors; their sensitivity has reached \u221a SF =\n(1.9 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u221219N/ \u221a\nHz [111]. Fluctuations of the nanoresonator frequency worsen the force sensitivity in Eq. 11, as they widen the mechanical linewidth and decrease the associated quality factor Q\u03c9 [170].\nThe transduction of the mechanical vibrations into a measurable electrical or optical output signal is challenging with small resonators. The transduction can deteriorate the force sensitivity by adding technical noise. For instance, it contributes \u223c14% to the force sensitivity of the nanotube studied by de Bonis et al. [168]. This socalled imprecision noise is quantified by the noise floor in the spectral measurement of a resonator (Fig. 4a).\nFigure 4b shows a force sensing experiment of nuclear spins [171]. The nuclear spins of 19F atoms in a CaF2 crystal are detected by attaching the crystal to a microcantilever. The nuclear spins are flipped back and forth at the mechanical resonance frequency. The associated time-modulated magnetic moment together with an applied magnetic field gradient creates a force that drives the microcantilever. The measured power spectrum of the vibrations in Fig. 4b shows a narrow peak associated with the spins on top of the broad resonance of the thermal vibrations of the microcantilever. The goal of such experiments is to achieve magnetic resonance imaging with atomic resolution [172, 173].\nForce sensing has been used with great success in recent advances in various fields. These include the Casimir force [174\u2013178], nanomagnetism [179\u2013181], scanning probe microscopy imaging of vectorial forces [182\u2013 184], light-matter interaction [77], persistent currents in\nnormal metal rings [185], and detecting a phonon flux in superfluid 4He [186]."

Most experiments are done with flexural modes [187, 188]. If one assumes that this massmadd is uniformly distributed over the resonator, the resonator itself is uniform, and madd is small compared to the resonator mass MNVS, then the relative change of the resonator eigenfrequency is\n\u03b4\u03c90/\u03c90 = \u2212madd/2MNVS. (12)\nAs an example, Fig. 5a shows a series of downward shifts in \u03c90 consistent with single adsorption events of naphthalene molecules onto a nanotube resonator.\nThere are different methods of monitoring the eigenfrequency. The simplest one relies on driving the resonator slightly off resonance while recording the vibration amplitude with a lock-in amplifier. A change in the eigenfrequency results in a change of the displacement amplitude A (Fig. 5b). The resonator settles to new amplitude and\n12\nphase over the decay time. The frequency shift can be quantified from the measured change of A using the slope of the mechanical susceptibility at the drive frequency. Implied in the analysis is that the adsorbed mass does not change over the duration of the measurement, which itself exceeds the decay time; however, the analysis can be also extended to the case where adsorbates attach and detach with a rate comparable to the relaxation rate [189].\nPhase-locked loop measurements are also often used to track the resonance frequency in mass sensing experiments. The method was first developed for high-Q cantilevers in atomic force microscopy [190]. It was used for faster detection of the frequency shift compared to the method discussed in the previous paragraph. However, a phase-locked loop is efficient when the imprecision noise in the detection of the displacement is small compared to the driven vibration amplitude; this is often hard to achieve for small resonators, such as nanotube resonators measured capacitively.\nMass spectrometry of molecules and nanoparticles requires overcoming the assumption of the uniform distribution of the adsorbed mass over the resonator. This can be achieved by tracking the resonance frequency of several flexural eigenmodes [191, 192]. The method utilizes the fact that the resonance frequency shift induced by an adsorbed molecule depends both on its mass and its position on the resonator. The frequency shift of an nth eigenmode due to a particle attached to a point R on the surface of a nanoresonator is\n\u03b4\u03c9n(R)/\u03c9n = \u2212madd\u03d52n(R)/2MNVS. (13)\nHere, \u03d5n(R) is the dimensionless displacement of the resonator at the point R due to the nth eigenmode, see Eq.1.\nThe frequency shift is the largest when the molecule is located at the antinode of the eigenmode, where its vibration amplitude is maximal, while it is equal to zero when the molecule sits at a node. The more modes can be measured, the better is the resolution of the mass of the absorbed molecule and of its location.\nFigure 5c shows how the measured eigenfrequencies of a microcantilever get reduced due to adsorption of 100 nm diameter gold nanoparticles [193]. Quasiinstantaneous jumps are simultaneously observed in the frequencies of the first three flexural modes when a single nanoparticle is adsorbed. The frequency shift is different for the three modes, since it depends on the nanoparticle location. The data analysis gives an average nanoparticle mass of 11.6\u00b1 3.8 fg.\nThe exceptional sensing capabilities of mechanical resonators enabled advances in many directions. These include characterizing analytes using mass spectrometry [192, 193, 195], the detection of large-mass biological particles that cannot be probed with commercial mass spectrometers based on mass-to-charge ratio measurements [196], weighting biomolecules and single cells in fluid using microchannels integrated in resonators [197], gas chromatography [198, 199], probing density and vis-\ncosity of liquids [200], the diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the surface of a resonator [201], the formation and transitions between solid- and liquid-phase monolayers of adsorbed atoms [202, 203], properties of helium superfluid thin films [204\u2013206], and in-situ nanofabrication [207].\nThe mass resolution of a resonator is limited by frequency fluctuations. As we will see in Sec. IX, there is a fundamental limit on how small frequency fluctuations and the mass resolution can be. This fundamental limit in the linear regime is related to the thermal displacement noise. It was found that, for some resonators, to improve mass sensing in a linear regime one may want to decrease the Q factor [208]. It was proposed to further increase mass sensitivity by driving a nanoresonator into a nonlinear regime and using the squeezing of thermomechanical fluctuations [209]. Mass sensing measurements in the nonlinear regime has recently been performed by Yuksel et al. [210].\nOn the practical side, of particular importance are comparatively slow frequency fluctuations, with the correlation time comparable or exceeding the decay time. Identifying the origin of such fluctuations is usually dif-\n13\nficult. For instance, they can arise from the diffusion of atoms over the resonator surface [201, 211, 212], the electrostatic interaction between the resonator and trapped charges in the substrate [213], and temperature drifts that modify the resonator stress. Slow frequency fluctuations are usually quantified using the Allan deviation. Their mechanisms and the Allan deviation are discussed in Sec. IX. These frequency fluctuations can be reduced, which has enabled reaching mass resolution (1.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u221227kg with a 2 s integration time; it has been achieved with a nanotube thanks to its extremely small mass [194]. This mass resolution is comparable to the mass of one proton."

The underlying idea is that photon absorption causes heating; the associated thermal expansion reduces the stress, changing the mechanical frequency of the resonator. Because the frequency can be detected with high accuracy, these experiments are exquisitely sensitive, with the sensitivity limited by frequency fluctuations, as in the case of mass sensing. Such photothermal sensing enables optical absorption spectroscopy of single particles and molecules located on the resonator [214], high-precision single-molecule imaging [215], high-speed detection of electromagnetic radiation with graphene nanomechanical bolometers [216], and thermal transport measurements of phonons in MoSe2 monolayer drums through the detection of the thermal gradient over these suspended devices [98]."

Although these resonators are mostly produced at the micro-scale, we would like to mention them as they have an important technological impact on our society. The current generation of these devices utilizes silicon technology with a waferencapsulation process to keep the self-sustaining oscillators in vacuum [217]. They can be now found in nearly all mobile phones, for example. One of the leading manufacturers, SiTime, report clocks for mobile and other battery powered devices with \u00b13 ppm frequency stability over the industrial temperature range between \u221240 C and +85 C, while the power consumption is kept low, below 5 \u00b5W [218].

The challenge is to integrate the device in an electrical circuit, so that it produces a continuous high-frequency signals when powered by a DC input in the feedback loop. The vibrations are transduced into an electrical signal, that is amplified with an adjustable gain and phase before being fed back to the resonator. The difficulty is to obtain a sizeable electrical signal with minimum imprecision noise added by the transduction of the vibrations. A frequency stability of \u00b12 ppm is demonstrated in a single-crystal SiC electromechanical resonator, albeit over a short test time, less than 1000 s [220]. Interesting approaches to suppressing the noise which are based on using a resonator in the nonlinear regime near bifurcation points of the response to an external drive have been proposed by Greywall et al. [221], Yurke et al. [222], Kenig et al. [223, 224] and the possibility to go beyond the limit imposed by the thermomechanical noise was demonstrated [225]."

We specify the conditions of applicability of the phenomenological description, where the friction force is determined by the instantaneous value of the velocity and where the noise can be described as \u03b4-correlated in time (the Markovian approximation).

Such dynamics is Markovian on times that largely exceed the vibration period even where the model (2) is inapplicable. The analysis provides an expression for the decay rate \u0393 in terms of the parameters of the thermal reservoir, and also shows that the frequency of the mode is changed as a result of the coupling and can become temperature-dependent.

            "text": "The description of dissipation of the oscillator is based on the picture in which the oscillator is coupled to a system with many degrees of freedom. In particular, a nanomechanical mode is coupled to phonons in the nanoresonator and in the substrate that supports the nanoresonator, to the electronic degrees of freedom, to an extended set of two-level fluctuators, and so on. The\n14\nmany-degrees-of-freedom system coupled to the oscillator can be usually thought of as a thermal bath. The leading term in the expansion of the coupling energy in the oscillator coordinate q is linear in q and can be written as\nHi = qhb, (14)\nwhere hb depends on the dynamical variables of the bath only. It gives the force Fb \u2261 \u2212hb that the bath exerts on the oscillator. Because of the large number of the dynamical variables, the excitation spectrum of the bath is (quasi)continuous. The form of the function hb depends on the particular type of the bath. For example, if the bath is formed by phonons in the resonator or the substrate, typically hb is a series in the phonon coordinates. The nonlinear terms in this series are behind such familiar mechanisms of dissipation of a nanomechanical mode as the thermoelastic, Landau-Rumer, and Akhiezer relaxation, see Sec. V A.\nTo formally describe the dynamics of the mode and the bath we assume that for t\u2192 \u2212\u221e they are uncoupled and the bath is in thermal equilibrium. Because the bath is \u201cbig\u201d, it is only weakly perturbed by the coupling once the latter is turned on. The response of the bath can be then described by the linear response theory [24],\nhb(t) \u2248 h(0)b (t) + \u03b4hb(t). (15)\nHere, h (0) b (t) is the function hb in the absence of the coupling. The force \u2212h(0)b (t) describes the effect of thermal fluctuations of the unperturbed bath on the oscillator. It is a random force, and it can be chosen to have zero mean, \u3008h(0)b (t)\u3009 = 0. The term \u03b4hb(t) is the perturbation caused by the coupling. When averaged over the fluctuations of the bath, it can be written as\n\u3008\u03b4hb(t)\u3009 = \u2212 \u02c6 \u221e\n0\ndt\u2032Xb(t\u2032)q(t\u2212 t\u2032). (16)\nFunction Xb(t) is the generalized susceptibility of the bath with respect to the oscillator coordinate q. Equation (16) is just an expression of the causality principle: the response of the bath at time t depends on the values of q at earlier times.\nBecause the bath is in thermal equilibrium, its susceptibility and fluctuations are related by the fluctuationdissipation theorem (FDT). This relation has the form\nSb(\u03c9) = 2~[n\u0304(\u03c9) + 1] Im \u03c7b(\u03c9), (17)\nwhere \u03c7b(\u03c9) is the Fourier transforms of the susceptibility Xb(t) [see Eq. (A7)], Sb(\u03c9) is the power spectrum of the bath fluctuations,\nSb(\u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e \u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9tsb(t), sb(t) = \u3008h(0)b (t)h (0) b (0)\u3009, (18)\nand n\u0304(\u03c9) = [exp(~\u03c9/kBT )\u2212 1]\u22121 is the thermal occupation number of vibrations at frequency \u03c9. The real and imaginary parts of \u03c7b(\u03c9) are related by the KramersKro\u0308nig relation. Therefore Eq. (17) fully defines the bath susceptibility in terms of the power spectrum Sb(\u03c9).\nTo the leading order in the coupling, one is tempted to replace \u03b4hb(t) in Eq. (15) with \u3008\u03b4hb(t)\u3009. Then the force from the bath on the mode takes the form\nFb(t) = F (r) b (t)\u2212 h (0) b (t), F (r) b (t) \u2261 \u2212\u3008\u03b4hb(t)\u3009. (19)\nThe term F (r) b (t) is the reaction force from the bath. It results, as seen from Eq. (16), from the perturbation of the bath by the oscillator and depends on the oscillator coordinate. In the optomechanics literature the reaction force is often called the dynamical backaction [141]. It is reminiscent of the backaction in the theory of quantum measurements, which describes the effect of the measuring apparatus on the measured quantum system and comes from the interaction between the apparatus and the system, cf. the Heisenberg microscope [226]. We note that the force F (r) b (t) emerges not only in the quantum, but also in the classical description of the dynamics.\nFrom Eq. (16), the force F (r) b (t) is retarded: it depends on q(t\u2032) with t\u2032 \u2264 t. One should keep in mind that F (r)b (t) is an approximation of the reaction force. It relies on the perturbation theory, and one should make sure that the perturbation theory holds for long times on the order of the lifetime of the considered vibrational mode.\nIn the classical theory, the above approximation for the reaction force applies in the important case where the power spectrum Sb(\u03c9) of the thermal noise is almost constant for frequencies ranging from much smaller to much larger than \u03c90. When the power spectrum is flat, the noise correlation function \u2212h(0)b (t) is approximately a \u03b4-function, h\n(0) b (t) \u221d \u03b4(t). This means that the noise\npart of the force from the bath Fb is a white noise. One can show that the backaction part of Fb(t) has then a term \u221d \u2212dq(t)/dt, see Appendix A 3. This maps the dynamics of the mode onto the phenomenological equation of Brownian motion (2). In the quantum theory, the case was studied by Caldeira and Leggett [22] for the bath being a set of harmonic oscillators and hb being linear in the coordinates of these oscillators. It was called Ohmic dissipation."

            "text": "For an NVS mode, the analysis of the effect of coupling to a thermal bath can be extended to a significantly broader situation using that the mode decay rate \u0393 is small compared to the eigenfrequency \u03c90 or, equivalently, the Q-factor is large. The approach we will describe allows one also to study nonlinear effects. In addition, it allows avoiding the assumptions of the Ohmic dissipation model. The underlying physics is that a mode with\n15\na large Q factor is a \u201cfilter\u201d. It is sensitive primarily to perturbations in a narrow frequency range around the eigenfrequency \u03c90. In particular, it is sensitive to the bath fluctuations in this frequency range. Of primary interest therefore is the amplitude and phase of the mode.\nA natural approach to the analysis of the dynamics is offered by the Krylov-Bogoliubov method of averaging [227, 228]. Here, the first step is to switch from the fast-oscillating coordinate q(t) and momentum p(t) of the mode to two new variables, the complex amplitude u \u2261 u(t) and its conjugate, q(t) = u(t) exp(i\u03c90t) + u\n\u2217(t) exp(\u2212i\u03c90t), p(t) = iM\u03c90[u(t) exp(i\u03c90t)\u2212 u\u2217(t) exp(\u2212i\u03c90t)]. (20)\nThe real and imaginary parts of u(t) have a simple physical meaning. They are just the quadratures of the vibrations: if we write the mode displacement as q(t) = A(t) cos[\u03c90t+ \u03c6(t)], then Re u(t) = 1 2A(t) cos\u03c6(t) and Im u(t) = 12A(t) sin\u03c6(t). In the absence of coupling to a thermal bath, the mode oscillates at frequency \u03c90 with constant amplitude and phase, and then u(t) =const. Because of the coupling, u(t) will vary in time, but for weak coupling the change over the vibration period 2\u03c0/\u03c90 will be small. This can be used to show that, in \u201cslow\u201d time compared to 2\u03c0/\u03c90, one can disregard retardation of the reaction force. This means that the value of F (r) b (t) at time t is determined by the value of u(t) at the same time t, see Eq. (A8). Then taking into account the explicit expressions for the reaction force (A8) and the thermal noise h (0) b (t), we obtain, see Appendix A 2\nu\u0307 = \u2212(\u0393\u2212 iP)u+ \u03be(t). (21)\nHere the term \u03be(t) = (i/2M\u03c90)h (0) b (t) exp(\u2212i\u03c90t) describes the noise that comes from the fluctuations in the thermal bath. The meaning of the parameters \u0393 and P is seen from the solution of Eq. (21) for the regular part of the complex amplitude, \u3008u(t)\u3009 = \u3008u(0)\u3009 exp[\u2212(\u0393 \u2212 iP)t]. When combined with Eq. (20), it shows that \u0393 is the decay rate of the vibrations, whereas P is the change of their frequency due to the coupling to the bath, \u03c90 \u2192 \u03c90 + P , i.e., P is an analog of the polaronic effect for a vibrational system. Both \u0393 and P are expressed in terms of the bath susceptibility \u03c7b(\u03c9) at the mode eigenfrequency (Appendix A 2),\n\u0393 = Im\u03c7b(\u03c90) 2M\u03c90 , P = \u2212Re\u03c7b(\u03c90) 2M\u03c90 . (22)\nWith the account taken of Eq. (17), the decay rate \u0393 is also simply expressed in terms of the power spectrum Sb(\u03c90) of the random force exerted by the bath. In the classical limit kBT ~\u03c90 we have\n\u0393 = (4MkBT ) \u22121Sb(\u03c90) (23)\nWe will use this expression below in the analysis of the decay of nanomechanical modes due to their coupling to phonons, two-level fluctuators, and electrons.\nAs seen from Eq. (22), both the decay rate \u0393 and the frequency shift P depend on temperature. The temperature dependence of P is a simple microscopic mechanism of the temperature dependence of the measured eigenfrequency of NVSs, and this dependence can be determined from the experimentally measured power spectrum or the response curves. For a carbon nanotube, such measurements were reported by Tepsic et al. [229]. In what follows, we incorporate P into the definition of \u03c90, i.e., replace \u03c90 \u2192 \u03c90 + P.\nThe noise \u03be(t) in Eq. (21) is Gaussian and zero-mean. It is \u03b4-correlated in the \u201cslow\u201d time compared to the vibration period 2\u03c0/\u03c90 and the time over which bath correlations decay,\n\u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 \u2248 (\u0393kBT/M\u03c920)\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032), (24)\nwhereas the correlator \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 and its complex conjugate can be disregarded (Appendix A 2). It is seen from the simple relations (21) - (24) between the decay rate of the mode and the noise from the thermal bath that the stationary distribution of the mode is the Boltzmann distribution, and \u3008|u|2\u3009 = kBT/2M\u03c920 .\nThe time evolution of the complex oscillator amplitude described by Eq. (21) is Markovian. There is no delay, the response of the bath is instantaneous in slow time. The corrections disregarded in Eqs. (21) and (24) are small if the bath susceptibility \u03c7b(\u03c9) weakly varies with \u03c9 in a comparatively narrow band centered at \u03c90. The width of this band is determined by the time dependence of u(t) and is \u223c \u0393, |P |. It is small compared to \u03c90 and to the reciprocal correlation time of fluctuations in the bath at frequency \u223c \u03c90. This is in contrast with the model of the Brownian motion described by Eq. (2), which requires near constancy of \u03c7b(\u03c9) in the frequency band broader than \u03c90.\nWe reiterate that the Markovian equation of motion (21) is an approximation. Its applicability has to be checked and the expressions for the decay rate and the polaronic frequency shift have to be derived using a microscopic model of the bath and the coupling."

(21) and the conjugate equation for u\u2020 that \u3008[u(t), u\u2020(t)]\u3009 remains constant.\nOn the formal side, the approximations made in deriving the equations of motion (21) - (26) and the equivalent master equation (see Appendix B) correspond to the familiar ladder approximation in the diagrammatic technique [230]. We note that a non-Markovian quantum Langevin equation has been also discussed in the literature; it has been consistently derived microscopically for the case of the coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with the coupling being effectively bilinear in the dynamical variables of the mode and the bath oscillators, see [20] and references therein.\nThe decay rate \u0393 in the quantum theory is simply related to the rate of transitions between the oscillator energy levels due to the coupling to the bath. As shown in Appendix B, \u0393 is a half of the rate W1\u21920 of transitions from the first excited to the ground state of the mode due to the coupling to the bath for T = 0."

This regime was first achieved in nanomechanics by O\u2019Connell et al. [149]. In this experiment a mechanical breathing mode vibrating at 6 GHz was cryogenically cooled using a dilution fridge at 25 mK, and a non-classical state of motion was created.

Mechanical modes endowed with long lifetimes have been cooled down into the quantum regime by coupling them to photon cavities and using parametric drive [142, 232, 233].

This mechanism is an important contributor to the so-called clamping losses. Vibrations of the NVS create time-dependent strain and stress in the area where the resonator is clamped. They serve as phonon-radiating antennas. The supporting structure is much larger than the resonator, and its phonons are a thermal bath for the resonator. This picture of decay via phonon emission is common for nanoand micro-mechanical systems. In micromechanical systems the corresponding losses are often called anchor losses.\nThe simplest model of the coupling to the bath of phonons in the support is where the coupling is linear both in the coordinate q of the NVS mode and in the phonon coordinates q\u03ba. It is described by the Hamiltonian Hi = qhb, Eq. (14), with\nhb = \u2211 \u03ba V\u03ba(b\u03ba + b \u2020 \u03ba). (30)\nHere, b\u03ba and b \u2020 \u03ba are the annihilation and creation operators of the \u03bath phonon, \u03c9\u03ba is the phonon frequency; index \u03ba includes the wave vector and the branch of the phonon. The full Hamiltonian of the coupled NVS mode and the phononic bath is\nH = H0 +Hi +Hb, H0 = ~\u03c90a\u2020a, Hb = \u2211 k ~\u03c9\u03bab\u2020\u03bab\u03ba (31)\n[we remind that the mode coordinate is q = (~/2M\u03c90)1/2(a+ a\u2020)].\nThe analysis of Sec. IV B shows that, for the model (30), the decay rate \u0393 and the shift of the eigenfrequency P of the NVS mode have the form [12]\n\u0393 = \u03c0\n4M\u03c920 gcl(\u03c90), P =\n1\n2M\u03c90\nd\u03c9\ngcl(\u03c9)\n\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c920 , (32)\nwhere gcl(\u03c9) = (2\u03c9/~) \u2211 \u03ba |V\u03ba|2\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba) is the phonon density of states weighted with the interaction. The decay rate (32) is independent of temperature, it cannot\nbe eliminated by cooling down the nanoresonator. However, it is small for low-frequency NVS modes, because the density of phonons at frequency \u03c90 in a 3D support is \u221d (\u03c90/\u03c9D)2 1 (\u03c9D is the Debye frequency). From Eq. (32), the decay rate can be reduced by either decreasing the density of states of phonons in the support or the coupling to these phonons.\nThe phonon-radiation decay of nano- or microresonators has been attracting much attention both on the theory side, see [246\u2013251], and on the experimental side, see [28, 43, 45, 51\u201353, 144, 252\u2013262] and references therein. Approximate expressions for the decay in cantilevers and membranes are summarized by Schmid et al. [8].\nSeparating radiation decay from other decay mechanisms is not necessarily simple in the experiment, cf. [45, 46, 262]. On the theory side, to find the coupling parameters V\u03ba one has to find the force that the resonator mode exerts on the phonons. For atomic displacements in the contact area, a separation of the contributions from vibrational modes of the resonator and of the support is nontrivial. Formally, the resonator and the support are a single system with a single set of eigenmodes. The considered resonator \u201cmode\u201d is a superposition of the exact eigenmodes, which have frequencies lying within a band centered at \u03c90, with a width\u223c \u0393, and have comparatively large amplitudes inside the resonator. Such a picture is reminiscent of the theory of tunneling decay in quantum mechanics, with the NVS mode being an analog of the state localized in a potential well and decaying into extended states outside the well. The extended states are the analogs of the phonons of the support. Both formulations have a counterpart in the analysis of resonant vibrations in solids that are mostly localized on defects [243, 244]; see [263].\nOne of the approaches to the problem of clamping losses is based on calculating the transmission T of elastic waves through the contact (the clamping area). Cross and Lifshitz [247] performed detailed calculations of the transmission for the support and the resonator being of the same thickness. They used a scalar model of elastic waves and the stress-free boundary conditions at the edges. The displacement field in the contact area was expanded into a superposition of incident and reflected waves on the resonator side and a propagating wave in the support, while keeping the field continuous on the both sides of the contact. Once T has been calculated, it is easy to find the decay rate. For example, for an eigenmode of a cantilever, which is a standing wave formed as a superposition of the two waves propagating in the opposite directions, \u0393 \u223c vgT /L, where vg is the group velocity of the wave and L is the length of the cantilever.\nExtensive calculations of the decay rate were done for several types of modes in nanoresonators by conditionally separating the displacement at the edge into that from the NVS mode and the phonons in the support [251]. This separation allowed finding the stress from the resonator mode in the contact area and then the force this\n18\nmode exerts on the support modes, which gives the parameters V\u03ba. The model was compared to measurements on high-stress Si3N4 membranes with circular and square geometries [43] and AlGaAs suspended-plate resonators [257].\nSignificant progress in reducing clamping losses in micromechanical resonators has been made by creating gaps in the phonon density of states in the contact area. If phonons with frequencies close to \u03c90 are decoupled from the resonator mode, the decay (32) is eliminated (in practice, suppressed). Different means of creating spectral gaps have been developed for micromechanical resonators, cf. [29, 255, 264\u2013268]. One of the most commonly used methods is based on using phononic crystals. It allows one to create a mode localized mostly within an interior of a membrane or a nanobeam near a \u201cdefect\u201d of the phononic crystal, with the frequency in the gap of the crystal excitation spectrum, see Figs. 6a,b. This significantly reduces the coupling to the support phonons. Such localized modes are counterparts of the modes localized at defects in solids [269\u2013271], which have frequencies that lie outside the phonon bands. Most of the studies of localized modes in crystals with defects have been done using ensemble measurements [263], in contrast to NVSs, where the modes are accessed individually.\nThe importance of clamping (anchor) losses has led to a development of various numerical algorithms, some of which have been incorporated into the standard software (COMSOL). An example is the method of a perfectly matched layer (PML), which was first applied to the problem of anchor losses by Bindel and Govindjee [250]. In this numerical method, to avoid reflection of the irradiated phonons back into the resonator there is introduced a layer adjacent to the boundary that truncates the unbounded support. The elasticity equations are artificially modified, so that inside the layer the solution decays exponentially, which is technically accomplished using a complex-valued coordinate change in combination with a finite element implementation. At the same time, the solution in the region that includes the resonator is not changed (perfect matching)."

            "heading": "2. Anelastic relaxation and dissipation dilution for flexural modes",
            "text": "At a phenomenological level, decay of vibrational modes in micro- and nano-resonators is often described by anelastic relaxation. The term was introduced by Zener [272]. Anelastic relaxation comes from thermal relaxation, motion of interstitial atoms, interstate transitions in two-level systems, grain boundary relaxation, and other processes [273\u2013275]. In many cases the losses are described by assuming that the Young modulus has an imaginary part. One can think of this imaginary part as a result of the delay of the elastic response, hence the term \u201canelasticity\u201d. Generally, the losses depend on the mode frequency and often display a characteristic peak as a function of frequency [272]. In this approach, a complex Young modulus is a property of a material, cf. [276]. However, for the low-frequency modes studied in nanomechanical resonators the frequency dispersion of the complex Young modulus is often disregarded, with an exception of thermoelastic relaxation, see below. The decay rate and the quality factor Q, which is defined by Eq. (6), are then expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the Young modulus.\nTo extend applications of nano- and micromechanical systems it is important to increase the quality factor. It was shown, in the context of interferometric detectors of gravitational waves [277] that, for flexural modes of a suspended loaded wire, the quality factor may become higher than the intrinsic Q of the material. This effect has become known as dissipation dilution. The physics of dissipation dilution is based on the fact that the elastic energy of a flexural mode in a stretched wire or, more generally, any stressed nano- or microresonator comes not only from the internal stress associated with the strain, but also from the externally applied tension, whereas the losses are often due to the intrinsic properties of the material.\nDetailed understanding of dissipation dilution requires a careful analysis of the interplay between the tension and\n19\nthe losses. It was first shown numerically by Unterreithmeier et al. [45] that, in a multimode resonator, the effect can be accounted for by taking into account the actual shape of the flexural modes while assuming the complex Young modulus to be frequency-independent. The results were successfully compared with their experimental data on up to 9 modes in SiN nanostrings. In this approximation, the losses can be analyzed [45, 46, 256] by writing the energy loss per vibrational cycle in the same form as the stress-related elastic energy and replacing the real Young modulus with its imaginary part E2. For example, in a plate of thickness h with a transverse displacement \u03b6(x, y) in the z direction, the density of losses per unit area is\nWanelast = \u03c0h3 12\u03c90(1\u2212 \u03bd2P) E2 { (\u22022x\u03b6 + \u2202 2 y\u03b6) 2\n+2(1\u2212 \u03bdP) [ (\u2202x\u2202y\u03b6) 2 \u2212 \u22022x\u03b6 \u22022y\u03b6 ]}\n(33)\nwhere \u03bdP is the Poisson ratio. [46] extended this expression to spatially nonuniform systems, E2 \u2192 E2(x, y). An explicit calculation for a nanobeam was done by Schmid et al. [256].\nAs seen from Eq. (33), a major contribution to losses comes from the areas of the largest curvature. For clamped membranes and nanobeams under tension, these areas are close to the clamps. Therefore one may expect that localizing flexural modes to the central part of nanobeams or membranes, i.e., away from the clamps, may reduce the losses. Such \u201csoft clamping\u201d has been successfully implemented using phononic crystals in multi-mode nano-membranes (Figs. 6a,b) [52] as well as in multimode nanobeams [53]. An alternative strategy consists in clamping a vibrating structure at the antinode of a perimeter mode [278]. Record-high Q factors have been obtained along with very high Q \u00d7 f factors, which in long nanobeams were as large as 1.1\u00d7 1015 Hz for f = 1.33 MHz [53] at room temperature. Thus isolating the modes inside suspended structures can be advantageous not only for reducing phonon emission into the substrate, but also for reducing intrinsic material losses."

            "text": "At the microscopic level, a major intrinsic contribution to decay of low-frequency micro- and nanomechanical modes comes from their nonlinear coupling to other vibrational modes. The usually studied NVS modes have frequencies small compared to the Debye frequency \u03c9D. Therefore the density of states of higher-frequency modes is usually much larger than the density of states at \u03c90, and it is the coupling to such modes that leads to decay of the low-frequency modes. This decay is somewhat reminiscent of sound absorption in dielectrics, which has been intensely studied since 1930s [234, 235], see [237\u2013 242] and references therein. The relevant lowest order nonlinearity is cubic. It leads to processes in which three vibrational modes are involved.\nFor cubic nonlinearity, the coupling (14) is described by the Hamiltonian Hi = qhb with\nhb \u2261 h(3)b = \u2211 \u03ba\u03ba\u2032 \u2032 V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032b \u2020 \u03bab\u03ba\u2032 + \u2211 \u03ba\u03ba\u2032 (V \u2032\u03ba\u03ba\u2032b \u2020 \u03bab \u2020 \u03ba\u2032 + H.c.) (34)\n(the prime over the sum indicates that \u03ba 6= \u03ba\u2032). In this expression b\u03ba and b \u2020 \u03ba are the annihilation and creation operators, with \u03ba now enumerating the modes localized mostly inside the resonator. Coupling to such modes is often stronger than to the modes in the support, and they serve as a thermal bath for the considered lowfrequency mode. To simplify the language and to distinguish them from the considered mode, we will call these high-frequency modes \u201cphonons\u201d.\nGenerally, because of the possible ripples and other inhomogeneites of the nanoresonator, the modes of the quasicontinuous frequency spectrum are not standard plane waves. This is why we use \u03ba rather than the wave vector to enumerate them. The nanomechanical modes we are interested in are also not plane waves, whether these are flexural modes or modes localized near defects of a phononic crystal. Therefore, in distinction from the sound absorption problem, in the scattering described by the coupling qhb the momentum is not conserved. This makes the problem similar to that of dissipation of modes localized on defects in disordered solids. Such problem for the coupling Hamiltonian (34) was considered by Krivoglaz [16, 245].\nThe coupling parameters V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 have to be calculated with the account taken of the actual structure of the involved modes, cf. [29, 279, 280]. We note that the nonlinear coupling of the considered NVS modes to the modes in the support and the corresponding nonlinear clamping losses may be also important because of the same density of states argument. This coupling is described by the Hamiltonian (34) with \u03ba referring to the modes primarily localized in the support. To the best of our knowledge, such coupling has not yet been studied for nanoresonators either theoretically or in the experiment.\nThe term \u221d V \u2032\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 in Eq. (34) describes a decay process where one quantum of the NVS mode disappears and there emerge two quanta of the thermal bath (two phonons) with total energy ~\u03c90, see Fig. 7(a). The rate of such scattering is very small for low-frequency NVS modes because of the low density of states of the relevant phonons. For ~\u03c90 kBT of a much higher probability is the process where a phonon is inelastically scattered off the considered NVS mode into another phonon; for example, a phonon \u03ba is scattered into a phonon \u03ba\u2032 and the energy difference ~\u03c9\u03ba\u2032\u2212~\u03c9\u03ba is equal to ~\u03c90. This Ramantype scattering is sketched in Fig. 7(b). The coupling leading to such a process is given by V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 in Eq. (34). The scattering probability is comparatively large when the thermal occupation numbers of the modes \u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 are large and their density of states is large, too. This means kBT ~\u03c90, a condition met in most experiments, with a few exceptions, see [29, 149\u2013152, 165, 231, 281] and references therein.\n20\nThe phonons \u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 involved in the scattering shown in Fig. 7(b) are themselves experiencing decay. The rate of the decay of the considered low-frequency mode \u0393 strongly depends on the interrelation between the phonon relaxation time \u03c4\u03ba and the vibration period of the considered mode 2\u03c0/\u03c90. If \u03c90\u03c4\u03ba 1, we can disregard decay of high-frequency phonons. Then from Eqs. (23) and (34) we find\n\u0393 = \u0393LR = \u03c0\n2M~\u03c90 \u2211 \u03ba,\u03ba\u2032 |V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 |2[n\u0304(\u03c9\u03ba)\u2212 n\u0304(\u03c9\u03ba\u2032)] \u00d7 \u03b4(\u03c9\u03ba + \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba\u2032). (35)\nThis expression has the same form as the expression for the decay rate of a mode localized on a defect [16, 245] and is similar to the expression by Landau and Rumer [234] for the sound absorption coefficient in solids. An analysis of this expression in the case of a breathing mode in a nanobeam phononic crystal [29] showed that the corresponding decay rate is much smaller than the observed value (which itself was extremely small, with the Q-factor reaching 5 \u00d7 1010.) It should be noted that the density of states arguments and the symmetry arguments may lead to a four-quantum decay process having a higher rate than the three-quantum one [282\u2013284]."

            "text": "Of primary interest for nano- and micromechanical resonators is the situation where the decay rate of highfrequency phonons exceeds the frequencies of the considered modes. Phonon decay significantly complicates the calculation of the power spectrum of h (3) b , which gives the decay rate \u0393, see Eq. (23). In such a calculation\nthe interaction between the phonons should be explicitly taken into account. This interaction comes from the nonlinearity of the crystalline lattice, which is described by nonlinear terms in the phonon Hamiltonian, i.e., the bath Hamiltonian. To the lowest order, in the bath nonlinearity, one has to replace the bath Hamiltonian Hb given by Eq. (31) with Hb +H (3) b ,\nH (3) b =\n1\n2 \u2211 \u03ba1\u03ba2\u03ba3 V\u03ba1\u03ba2\u03ba3b \u2020 \u03ba1b \u2020 \u03ba2b\u03ba3 + H.c. (36)\nThe Hamiltonian (36) describes processes where one phonon decays into two other phonons or, vice versa, two phonons annihilate and one phonon emerges, so that the overall phonon energy is conserved, \u03c9\u03ba1 + \u03c9\u03ba2 = \u03c9\u03ba3 . Other cubic in b\u03ba, b \u2020 \u03ba terms have been dropped in Eq. (36), as they do not describe phonon decay, to the leading order.\nIn Appendix G we outline a way to calculate the decay rate of the low-frequency NVS mode using the general formulation of Sec. IV, with the account taken of the nonlinear mode couplings (34) and (36). The calculation is somewhat involved. Here we give a qualitative phenomenological picture for two important limiting cases. We note, however, that both cases follow from the same general analysis. The thermoelastic relaxation (TER) case is where the eigenfrequency \u03c90 is so small that, because of the coupling (36), the high-frequency vibrations have time to come to thermal equilibrium locally in different parts of the vibrating nanoresonator. One can then introduce a local position-dependent temperature T (r) inside the nanoresonator. For flexural modes, this implies that the mean free path of thermal phonons lT , which is determined by the coupling (36), is small compared to all dimensions, including the transverse dimension of the resonator.\nThe TER mechanism was proposed by Zener [285]. A detailed analysis of the TER for flexural modes is given by Lifshitz and Roukes [286]. The underlying physics can be understood [287] if one thinks of thermal expansion and of generating heat by bending a beam or a membrane. For a small temperature change \u03b4T , thermal expansion is proportional to \u03b4T , that is, the relative change of the volume is \u03b4V/V = 3\u03b1T \u03b4T , where \u03b1T is the linear thermal expansion coefficient [it is determined by the coupling parameters (34), see the discussion below Eq. (39)]. On the other hand, it follows from the thermodynamics that there is an inverse process. Changing the volume leads to heating or cooling. The heat produced by a small volume increment \u03b4V is T\u2202TFV\u2212T, where FV\u2212T is the free energy density associated with thermal expansion, FV\u2212T = \u2212E\u03b1T \u03b4T \u03b4V/(1\u2212 2\u03bdP)V .\nIn flexural vibrations one part of the nanoresonator is periodically squeezed (\u03b4V < 0) whereas the other is stretched in the counterphase. Therefore there emerges a temperature gradient across the resonator. It dissipates via thermal conductivity, which leads to vibration decay.\n21\nIf the thickness of the nanoresonator in the bending direction is l\u22a5, the characteristic time of thermal diffusion across it is\n\u03c4Z = C\u03c1l 2 \u22a5/\u03c0 2\u03baT , (37)\nwhere C is the specific heat per unit mass and \u03baT is the thermal conductivity [285]. If this time is small compared to the vibration period, the nanoresonator is essentially isothermal and TER is not efficient. In the opposite limit \u03c90\u03c4Z 1 TER is not efficient either, since the heat does not have time to propagate across the resonator over the vibration period and is locally averaged out over the compression-extension cycle. An intuitive approximation for the decay rate is provided by the Zener expression [285]\n\u0393TER = E\u03b12TT\u03c90\n2C\u03c1 \u03c90\u03c4Z 1 + (\u03c90\u03c4Z)2 . (38)\nIn agreement with the above qualitative arguments, the decay rate becomes small both where \u03c90\u03c4Z is large or small.\nA quantitative analysis of the dynamics of a flexural mode in a nanobeam can be done by writing the equation of motion for the displacement in the bending direction which, along with the elastic force, takes into account the force from the thermal expansion. This equation and the thermal diffusion equation form a system of two coupled linear equations. The complex eigenvalues of these equations describe the decay rate and the frequency shift of the flexural mode due to the thermoelastic effect [286].\nOn the experimental side, the TER has been seen in both micro- and nanomechanical resonators at room temperature, see [42, 252, 262, 288, 289]. As the temperature is decreased, the decay rate (38) also decreases and other decay mechanisms come into play. In addition, the mean free path of thermal phonons in nanoresonators can become larger than the resonator thickness, so that the system is no longer in the TER regime.\nAkhiezer damping. The expression for the decay rate changes if \u03c90 largely exceeds the rate of heat diffusion across the resonator, \u03c90 \u03c4\u22121Z , even though it can still be small or comparable to the relaxation rate of thermal phonons. Then the phonons do not have time to equilibrate locally to different temperatures in different parts of the resonator. The decay mechanism in this case was discussed by Akhiezer [235] in the context of ultrasound absorption in solids. The corresponding mechanism of ultrasound absorption is called Akhiezer damping. It has been attracting much attention and has been studied for various models of the phonon-phonon coupling, cf. [236, 237, 239, 290, 291] and references therein.\nThe idea of the Akhiezer damping directly extends to the decay of low-frequency vibrational modes in nanoand micromechanical systems. In this context it was analyzed in several papers [279, 280, 292\u2013294]; a detailed experimental study of the temperature dependence of\nAkhiezer damping in Si micromechanical resonator is described by Rodriguez et al. [112], see also [265] for a review of the earlier work.\nTo give an idea of the mechanism we consider the coupling of a low-frequency mode to high-frequency phonons in the deformation potential approximation [238]. This approximation corresponds to the choice of the coupling parameters V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 in Eq. (34) based on the picture [235] in which a low-frequency mode, with a spatially smooth displacement field u(r), weakly locally distorts the crystal. The distortion leads to coordinate-dependent changes \u03b4\u03c9\u03ba of the frequencies \u03c9\u03ba of high-frequency modes,\n\u03b4\u03c9\u03ba = \u2212\u03c9\u03ba\u03b3(G)\u03ba \u2207u, u(r) = q\u03d5(r) (39)\n(we remind that \u03d5(r) is the dimensionless local displacement due to the considered low-frequency mode).\nThe parameter \u03b3 (G) \u03ba determines the coupling constants V\u03ba1\u03ba2 in Eq. (34). The average of \u03b3 (G) \u03ba over the phonons with the weight given by the phonon heat capacities gives the Gru\u0308neisen parameter \u03b3(G). This parameter is immediately related to the thermal expansion coefficient \u03b1T , i.e., \u03b3(G) = E\u03b1T /C\u03c1(1\u22122\u03bdP). The approximation (39) is often generalized by replacing \u2207u with the strain tensor associated with q\u03d5(r), in which case \u03b3 (G) \u03ba also becomes a tensor. Finding the Akhiezer damping rate in nanomechanics requires, as a first step, solving the full quantum kinetic equation for the two-phonon correlation function of thermal phonons, see Appendix G. This equation goes beyond the conventional kinetic equation for the occupation numbers of phonons [280]. However, to see the Akhiezer effect qualitatively, one can start with Eq. (35) that describes phonon scattering off the low-frequency mode. Since high-frequency phonons have finite lifetimes, their energies are uncertain, and in Eq. (35) the \u03b4-function of the energy conservation law, \u03b4(\u03c9\u03ba \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba\u2032 + \u03c90), can be replaced by a Lorentzian with a halfwidth given by a phonon decay rate 1/\u03c4ph. This rate is the characteristic value of the decay rate \u03c4\u22121\u03ba of thermal phonons, which is quadratic in the parameters of the phonon-phonon coupling V\u03ba1\u03ba2\u03ba3 . Then from Eqs. (35) and (39)\n\u0393Akh = aAkhC(\u03b3(G))2 \u03c90\u03c4ph\n1 + (\u03c90\u03c4ph)2 . (40)\nThe lifting of the energy conservation constraint described by Eq. (40) leads to an increase of the decay rates of low-frequency NVS modes compared to the LandauRumer theory (35). It also leads to a specific temperature dependence of the decay rate. If the mean free path of thermal phonons is small compared to the size of the resonator, this dependence is similar to the temperature dependence of ultrasound absorption. The parameter aAkh in the latter case was found by Woodruff and Ehrenreich [236] for a simple model of the coupling to acoustic phonons and for the ultrasound frequency \u03c90 \u03c4\u22121ph , in which case aAkh = \u03c90T/3\u03c1v 2 s , where vs is the average speed of sound. In this regime \u0393Akh weakly depends on\n22\ntemperature provided T exceeds the Debye temperature. This is because the phonon scattering rate is proportional to the phonon occupation number, i.e., \u03c4\u22121ph \u221d T [238], whereas C is independent of T .

It is small both for \u03c90\u03c4ph 1 and in the opposite limit \u03c90\u03c4ph 1, where the decay is described by the Landau-Rumer-type theory.\nThe low-temperature behavior of \u0393Akh changes in thin nanoresonators. When the wavelength of thermal phonons becomes comparable to one of the dimensions of a resonator, the phonon spectrum is quantized and the density of states of phonons is changed. This leads to a change of both the specific heat and the phonon decay rate. Moreover, nanoresonators can be, and often are inhomogeneous on the scale of the phonon mean-free path, because of bending, twisting, ripples, etc., which requires a modification of the theory [280]. On the experimental side, in contrast to micromechanical resonators [112], the study of Akhiezer damping and the accompanying frequency shift in nanoresonators is at an early stage [229].\nTo relate to the previous discussion, we note that the decay of thermal phonons, that underlies the Akhiezer relaxation, is one of the microscopic mechanisms of the anelastic relaxation described by a complex Young modulus, see Sec. V A 2."

            "text": "Nanomechanical resonators are characterized by a large surface-to-volume ratio. Therefore surface scattering and the defects associated with surfaces may be an important source of mode relaxation, cf. [4, 45, 46, 252, 259, 294, 295] and references therein. In particular, [259] performed detailed measurements of surface losses in SiN membranes at room temperature as a function of the thickness and also compared different data in the literature; they concluded that the Q-factor linearly increases with the increasing thickness. This is expected for surface losses if one thinks of the Q factor as the ratio of the energy stored, which is proportional to the volume, to the energy losses, which linearly increase with the surface area.\nGenerally, one can think of the surface losses as resulting from \u201cstatic\u201d and \u201cdynamical\u201d effects. A simple static effect comes from the static disorder, which leads to scattering of thermal phonons. The effect is particularly strong where the phonon mean free path becomes comparable to the thickness. The disorder-induced scattering relaxes the momentum conservation law in phononphonon scattering and thus decreases the lifetime of thermal phonons. This leads to the decrease of the relaxation rate of the low-frequency NVS modes in the Akhiezer regime for \u03c90\u03c4ph < 1, as seen from Eq. (40) [296]. How-\never, as mentioned above, one can also think of thermal \u201cphonons\u201d somewhat differently, by associating them with the exact vibrational excitations of the disordered system in the harmonic approximation. The coupling of such thermal excitations to the low-frequency NVS modes is different compared to a system with no disorder, cf. [280]. This can increase the Landau-Rumer and Akhiezer relaxation rates compared to those calculated in the absence of disorder.\nThe dynamical effects of surface disorder come from the defects with internal degrees of freedom, which can absorb energy from the low-frequency NVS modes. The best-known type of such defects are two-level systems (TLSs), which were introduced by Anderson et al. [297] and Phillips [298] to explain the anomalous heat capacity and thermal conductivity of glasses at low temperatures. TLSs exist not only on surfaces, but also in the bulk. Their density of states may be higher than the density of states of thermal phonons for low temperatures. For higher temperatures, where the density of states of thermal phonons is higher, the TLSs can \u201cmediate\u201d energy transfer from the low-frequency NVS modes to thermal phonons.\nIt is believed that of utmost importance for relaxation of low-frequency modes in nanoresonators are TLSs with level spacing that significantly exceeds ~\u03c90. The relaxation is due not to resonant interlevel transitions of the TLSs, but to nonresonant processes. It has been discussed for a broad range of nanoresonators, such as gold [299], polycrystalline aluminum [300], silica [301], aluminum covered silicon [302], SiN [295] and GaAs [294] nanobeams, as well as graphene-based heterostructure membranes [100], half-ring crystalline Si resonator [303], and phononic crystals [29]; see also [304] for a review of the early work.\nThe dominant mechanism of nonresonant coupling to a TLS is the modulation of the level spacing by the strain from the vibrational mode. Such coupling is often called dispersive. It is easy to visualize if one thinks of the TLS states as intrawell states of a particle in a double-well potential, which are hybridized by interwell tunneling. The strain modulates the wells differently, that leads to the change of their relative depths and thus the level spacing. The Hamiltonian of the coupling reads\nHTLS = CTLSq(n\u03022 \u2212 n\u03021), (41)\nwhere n\u0302i is the operator of the occupation of the ith state of the TLS (i = 1, 2), q is the NVS mode coordinate, and CTLS is the coupling constant.\nRelaxation of the mode results from the finite lifetime of the TLS states. By periodically modulating the TLS level spacing, the mode modulates the state populations with a delay determined by the interrelation between \u03c90 and the interstate switching rate \u03c4\u22121TLS. It is this delay that leads to the absorption of the mode energy, i.e., to the mode relaxation. If \u03c90 \u03c4\u22121TLS, the TLS adiabatically follows the mode-induced strain, with essentially no absorption. In the opposite limit, \u03c90 \u03c4\u22121TLS the TLS\n23\naverages out the mode-induced strain, again, with very little absorption. Overall, the absorption coefficient \u0393TLS as a function of the mode eigenfrequency \u03c90 is described by the so-called Debye peak, which was found by Debye [305] in the analysis of the dielectric response due to reorientation of polar molecules in crystals,\n\u0393TLS \u221d C2TLS(kBT )\u22121 \u03c90\u03c4TLS\n1 + \u03c920\u03c4 2 TLS\n. (42)\nThis expression can be immediately derived from the general formulation (17).\nThe TLS relaxation rate \u03c4\u22121TLS is determined by the coupling to phonons (or electrons). Generally, this rate depends on the geometry of the nanoresonator and the associated change of the phonon spectrum [306]. At low temperatures, it is dominated by interstate tunneling and single-phonon processes, with \u03c4\u22121TLS \u221d coth(E/2kBT ), where E is the level spacing. At higher temperatures phonon scattering off TLSs comes into play. To extend the results to still higher temperatures, TLSs are often thought of as particles in a double-well potential, with \u03c4\u22121TLS being determined by the rate of activated interwell switching, \u03c4\u22121TLS \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206U/kBT ), where \u2206U is the barrier height, see [307].\nThe overall temperature dependence of the decay rate of the low-frequency NVS modes is obtained by summing the contributions \u0393TLS for different TLSs. For low temperatures, T . 1\u2212 3 K, it is often described by a power law [299, 302], as expected for some models of the TLSs [308]. For higher temperatures, because of the exponential falloff of \u03c4TLS with the increasing temperature, \u0393 TLS may display a peak as a function of temperature where \u03c90\u03c4TLS = 1 [295]. The overall behavior of the decay rate with temperature depends on whether there are various types of TLSs or, as in the case of certain surface defects, the distribution of the TLS parameters is narrow, cf. [294, 295].\nGenerally, resonant absorption by low-energy TLSs with the level spacing ~\u03c90 can also contribute to the mode decay [309]. It would be characterized by absorption saturation and the associated decrease of the decay rate with the increasing mode amplitude, similar to ultrasound absorption [310] and the absorption of microwave radiation in superconducting cavities [311]. However, this behavior is most clearly manifested for ~\u03c90 & kBT , a demanding condition in nanomechanics."

            "text": "The thermal bath can be the electrons flowing through the resonator. It can also be the conducting electrons in a device capacitively coupled to the resonator. Both layouts are similar. Electron transport is used in many resonators to transduce mechanical vibrations into a measurable signal and to drive the motion via the capacitive force, i.e., by modulating the potential Vg between the gate electrode and the nanoresonator, as discussed\nin Sec. II. Conversely, the coupling to the electron system leads to the relaxation of mechanical vibrations via electrical dissipation.\nThe simplest relaxation mechanism is Ohmic losses in the electronic circuit. To illustrate this mechanism, we consider a mechanical resonator based on a suspended wire coupled to the gate electrode which, along with the elements of the electronic circuit, serve as the thermal reservoir, see Fig. 8a. The coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom comes from the potential Vg in Fig. 8b that fluctuates due to the noise in the electron system. The coupling is described by the Hamiltonian\nHi = qhb, hb = \u2212C \u2032gV g\u03b4Vg (43)\nWe assume here that the fluctuations of the potential \u03b4Vg are small compared to its mean value V g \u2261 V DCg , cf. Eq. (8). From the general expression (22), the contribution \u0393e of the coupling (43) to the decay rate \u0393 of the resonator in the classical case kBT ~\u03c90 is\n\u0393e = (4MkBT ) \u22121(C \u2032gV DC g ) 2 \u02c6 \u221e \u2212\u221e\ndtei\u03c90t\u3008\u03b4Vg(t)\u03b4Vg(0)\u3009. (44)\nThe power spectrum of the voltage fluctuations has a simple form for the Ohmic resistance in the device shown in Fig. 8a, where we disregard the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and phase-coherent effects. For simplicity, we assume that the impedance of the circuit at the frequency \u03c90 is given by large resistances Rc1 and Rc2 at the interface between the wire and the electrical leads. The corresponding resistors are connected in parallel to the ground, see Fig. 8b, so that the total resistance is Reff = Rc1Rc2/(Rc1 +Rc2). Then the correlator of \u03b4Vg is determined just by the Johnson\u2212Nyquist noise, resulting in\n\u0393e = (C \u2032 gV DC g ) 2Reff/2M. (45)\nWe note that this expression for the decay rate can be obtained directly from Eq. (43) by noting that the force on the resonator is C \u2032gV g\u03b4Vg. The motion of the resonator modulates the charge on it, leading to a current \u2248 C \u2032gV DCg q\u0307. As a result, the potential \u03b4Vg is modulated.\n24\nIf the vibration frequency \u03c90 is small compared to the relaxation rate of the circuit (ReffCg)\n\u22121, then \u03b4Vg follows q\u0307(t) adiabatically, so that the corresponding part of \u03b4Vg has the form [\u03b4Vg]q = \u2212ReffC \u2032gV DCg q\u0307. By substituting this expression into the force on the resonator, we obtain the friction force\u22122M\u0393eq\u0307. An alternative derivation based on calculating the energy loss due to the resistance of the nanoresonator is given by Song et al. [87].\nThe electronic relaxation has been measured in resonators based on two-dimensional systems, such as graphene, WSe2 monolayers, and van der Waals stacks [87, 95, 100]. The measured mechanical dissipation rate increases quadratically with V DCg , in agreement with Eq. (45). The electrical resistance obtained from the mechanical dissipation is in a reasonable agreement with the resistance of the device. A quantitative comparison is often challenging, especially when the spatial flow of the vibrations-induced current is not known precisely due to the geometry of the device.\nThe electron-electron interaction can strongly modify the relaxation rate of a nanoresonator. The effect has been studied in several theoretical papers for lowresistive nanoresonators capacitively coupled to stationary normal and superconducting single-electron transistors (SETs) and in the layout where the nanoresonator itself is an SET that is capacitively coupled to an immobile gate electrode [312\u2013319]. The underlying physics is related to the dependence of the potential of the SET island, and thus the tunneling rate, on the position of the nanoresonator. Experiments were carried out on SETs [33, 129, 135, 320\u2013334], superconducting SETs [335\u2013338], and double-quantum dots [328, 339].\nThe theory takes advantage of the fact that the response of a SET to the position is usually fast on the time scale of the vibration period, i.e., \u03c90 is small compared to the tunneling rate. The analysis can be formulated in terms of the linear response of the SET to the vibrations, cf. Sec. IV. Measurements have shown that the coupling can dramatically increase the mechanical dissipation [323, 324, 336]. When the voltage applied between the source and the drain electrodes of the SET is larger than kBT/e, the electronic bath is no longer in equilibrium, and it can cool the thermal vibrations [315]. In addition, such an out-of-equilibium electronic bath in an SET can suppress the total dissipation rate of the mechanical resonator to zero, leading to self-oscillation [318, 333]. Cooling and self-oscillations can also be produced by an electrothermal reaction force associated with the electrical power dissipated in SETs [33].\nThe so-called electron shuttles [340\u2013343] can be operated in the self-oscillation regime, too. These are devices where the metal island of the SET placed on a nanoor microcantilever is oscillating between the source and drain leads \u2013 in each oscillation period, the island mechanically transfers a quantized number of electrons from one lead to the other.\nThere has been also investigated the interplay of the NVS dynamics with other many-electron effects and the\neffects of the topology and coherence of the electron system. Those include the Kondo [344] and the quantum Hall effects [345, 346], the electronic Fabry-Pe\u0301rot interference in a nanoresonator [31], and the effect of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in a topologically nontrivial nanowire [347]. Yet other manifestations of the coupling of the NVS modes and the electron subsystems were studied in ballistic p\u2013n junctions [348], field-effect transistors [65], and quantum-point contact devices [349]."

            "heading": "VI. CONSERVATIVE AND DISSIPATIVE NONLINEARITY",
            "text": "Vibration nonlinearity is one of the most important and interesting features of the NVS modes. As mentioned before, since nanomechanical resonators are small, it comes into play already for small vibration amplitudes. Sometimes even thermal fluctuations can be sufficiently large to take the vibrations to a nonlinear regime. This regime is also reached with a modest resonant driving if the quality factor is high; in fact, for high-Q modes care must be taken of staying in the linear regime.\nUsually nonlinear effects are separated into conservative and dissipative. Conservative nonlinearity corresponds to the restoring force being a nonlinear function of the mode coordinate q or, equivalently, to the potential energy of the mode U(q) being different from M\u03c920q\n2/2. If U(q) has inversion symmetry, U(q) = U(\u2212q), as for bending modes in a straight nanotube or a flat membrane, the leading nonparabolic term in U(q) is quartic in q. The potential energy of the mode then has the form\nU(q) = 1\n2 M\u03c920q\n2 + 1\n4 M\u03b3q4. (46)\nSuch nonlinearity is often called the Duffing nonlinearity or, in terms of nonlinear optics, the Kerr nonlinearity. It has been seen in the majority of NVSs.\nConventionally, in nonlinear dynamics the nonlinearity is considered to be strong where the nonparabolic part of the potential becomes of the same order of magnitude as the parabolic part [350]. However, in nanomechanics, in most studies the conservative nonlinearity of NVSs is weak in this sense,\n|\u03b3|\u3008q4\u3009 \u03c920\u3008q2\u3009. (47)\nHowever, even where the condition (47) holds, the effect of the nonlinearity on the dynamics can be strong, provided the decay rate of the mode is small, i.e., Q 1. This is clear from the following argument. The nonlinear part of the restoring force \u2212M\u03b3q3 shows that the effective \u201cspring constant\u201d gets effectively either stronger or softer with the increasing vibration amplitude, depending on whether \u03b3 > 0 or \u03b3 < 0, respectively. Therefore the resonance frequency becomes dependent on the vibration amplitude A. For weak nonlinearity, the shift in\n25\n\u03c90 is quadratic in A, see Appendix A 1,\n\u03b4\u03c90 = 3\n8\n\u03b3\n\u03c90 A2. (48)\nThe Duffing nonlinearity becomes important once this frequency shift becomes comparable to the frequency uncertainty associated with the decay rate \u0393. In quantum terms, the energy levels of the mode become nonequidistant, and the nonlinearity becomes important once this nonequidistance becomes comparable to the level width \u221d ~\u0393, see Appendix E.\nDissipative nonlinearity corresponds, in the phenomenological description, to the friction force being a nonlinear function of the velocity and coordinate. This function changes sign upon time reversal, analogous to the linear friction force \u22122M\u0393q\u0307. In its simplest form, the nonlinear friction force is \u221d q2q\u0307 [[351]] or \u221d q\u03073 [[352]]. Similar to the conservative nonlinearity, for weakly damped modes the nonlinear dissipative force is important where it is comparable with the linear friction force \u22122M\u0393q\u0307, which is much weaker than the restoring harmonic force \u2212M\u03c920q. In this section we discuss the mechanisms of nonlinearity and some of the key manifestations of nonlinearities in mechanical resonators. Nonlinear resonant phenomena are discussed in more detail in Sec. VII."

            "heading": "A. Mechanisms of conservative nonlinearity",
            "text": "There are several mechanisms of nonlinearity of the restoring force in nanomechanics. The simplest of them is the nonlinear dependence of the stress (tension) on the displacement field of the mode. A familiar example is provided by a doubly-clamped pre-stressed thin beam [287]. The change \u2206L of the length L of the beam due to the transverse displacement X(z, t) in a flexural vibra-\ntional mode is \u2206L \u2248 \u00b4 L\n0 dz(\u2202X/\u2202z)2/2 for small |dX/dz|\n(z is the coordinate along the beam). The elongation leads to the tension ES\u2206L/L, where S is the area of the beam cross-section. This tension adds to the tension T inside the beam, so that the overall restoring force due to the tension is\nFT (z) \u2248 [ T + (ES/2L) \u02c6 dz(\u2202X/\u2202z)2 ] \u22022X/\u2202z2. (49)\nIf one substitutes X(z, t) = q(t)\u03d5(z), where \u03d5(z) is the normalized spatial profile of the mode (which is sinusoidal for strong tension), one can see that the cubic in X(z, t) term leads to the force \u2212\u03b3Mq3 in the equation of motion for q(t) [Eq. (2)], with \u03b3 = (E/2L\u03c1)[ \u00b4 dr(d\u03d5/dz)2]2 [5].\nNonlinear terms in the restoring force can come also from other sources. In particular, they can come from the nonlinear dependence of the resonator-to-gate capacitance Cg on the displacement of the resonator. As discussed in Sec. II D, for a given mode, the second derivative of Cg over the displacement associated with the\nmode leads to the change of the mode frequency. The higher-order derivatives of Cg lead to a force which is quadratic or cubic in the displacement, i.e., has the form \u2212M\u03b2q2 \u2212M\u03b3q3, cf. [41, 86, 353\u2013355]. The parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, which are proportional to the third and fourth derivatives of Cg, respectively, are quadratic in the gate voltage, cf. Eq. (9). They scale approximately as the cube and the fourth power of the ratio of the displacement amplitude to the distance between the resonator and the relevant electrodes.\nThe nonlinearity can also result from electronvibrational coupling [323, 324, 327, 356, 357]. Measurements on nano- and micromechanical systems showed that the dependence of the vibration frequency on the amplitude, the so-called backbone curve, can be more complicated than Eq. (48) [358\u2013362]. This indicates that, in some cases, the restoring force can be proportional to higher powers of the displacement. The backbone curve can become nonmonotonic. At the extrema the vibration frequency is independent of the amplitude, leading to the so called zero-dispersion phenomena [363].\nThe backbone curve of weakly damped modes can be measured directly in the ring-down measurement. It is based on exciting vibrations to a comparatively large amplitude and measuring their frequency and amplitude as functions of time as the amplitude decays, see Figs. 9(a-c) [32, 359, 364]. This method applies where the nonlinearity is comparatively strong, so that the overall frequency change is much larger than the decay rate.\nUsually nanomechanical resonators have several wellresolved low-frequency eigenmodes at a time. These can be flexural or torsional modes, or standing acoustic waves [192, 365\u2013373]. They are nonlinearly coupled. The nonlinearity of the elasticity and of the capacitance are the leading sources of this coupling. For flexural modes this is seen already from Eq. (49) if one takes into account that X(z) is a sum of the displacements of different modes. In the case of nanobeams one should also take into account that nonlinear tension comes from modes that involve displacements in different directions. This is done by adding (\u2202Y/\u2202z)2 to (\u2202X/\u2202z)2 in Eq. (49) [287]. Similarly, the capacitance of the circuit that incorporates a resonator depends on different contributions to the displacement, which come from different modes, leading to the mode coupling. A broad range of experiments have been done also on the modes in coupled nanoresonators [59, 61, 331, 374\u2013379].\nThe nonlinear part of the energy of the multimode nanoresonator is\nUnl(q1, q2, ...) = 1 3 M \u2211 \u03b2n1n2n3qn1qn2qn3\n+ 1 4 M \u2211 \u03b3n1n2n3n4qn1qn2qn3qn4 + . . . , (50)\nwhere the subscripts n1,2,3,4 enumerate the modes and summation over these subscripts is implied. The mass M here is chosen as an effective mass of one of the modes, cf. the discussion below Eq. (1).\n26\nFor comparatively weak nonlinearity, the major effects of the nonlinear mode coupling can be conditionally separated into resonant and dispersive. Nonlinear resonant effects occur where a linear combination of the frequencies of several modes or their overtones is equal or close to the frequency of another mode or its overtone [32, 94, 366, 380\u2013383]. The manifestations of the resonant couplings are discussed in Sec. VIII.\nThe dispersive coupling is important, on the other hand, where the mode frequencies are different and resonant conditions do not hold. The primary consequence of such coupling is the dependence of the vibration frequency of one mode on the amplitudes of other modes or, in quantum terms, the dependence of the spacing between the energy levels of one mode on the occupation numbers of the other modes [47, 367, 370, 372, 378, 384\u2013 390]. Similar to Eq. (48), if the amplitudes of the modes are Am, the change \u03b4\u03c9n of the frequency of the mode n due to the dispersive coupling described by the quartic in qni terms in Eq. (50) is\n\u03b4\u03c9n = 3\n4\u03c9n \u2211 m \u2032 \u03b3nnmmA 2 m, (51)\nwhere the prime indicates that m 6= n in the sum over m. We note that the parameters \u03b3nnmm here have corrections \u221d \u03b22nmk due to the cubic in qni terms in Eq. (50),\ncf. [386]. Figure 10 shows measurements on two coupled NVS modes featuring the characteristic quadratic dependence of the shift of the eigenfrequency of one mode on the amplitude of the other mode. Dispersive coupling can also be measured between modes of different nature, such as the flexural mode of a graphene drum and its optical phonon modes [391]."

            "text": "A basic microscopic mechanism of nonlinear friction in mesoscopic vibrational systems is a decay process in which two quanta of the considered mode scatter into excitations of a thermal reservoir [392]. The corresponding process is sketched in Fig. 7(c), (d), see also Fig. 32(b). An important contribution to nonlinear friction of lowfrequency nanomechanical modes can come from the processes described by the quartic nonlinearity. In such processes, a thermal phonon with frequency \u03c9\u03ba 2\u03c90 is scattered off the considered nanomechanical mode with frequency \u03c90 into another high-frequency phonon, see Fig. 7(d). Since the density of states of thermal phonons is often much higher than of the phonons with frequencies \u2248 \u03c90, these processes may be the leading cause of nonlinear friction. The frequency difference 2\u03c90 between the involved thermal phonons can be smaller than their decay rate. This complicates the analysis and makes it similar, to some extent, to the analysis of the thermoelastic or Akhiezer relaxation for linear friction [280]. Another contribution to nonlinear friction was discussed for nonlinear leakage of the flexural modes into bulk acoustic modes [393], the nonlinear-friction analog of the standard clamping losses.\n27\nA general formulation of the theory of nonlinear friction is similar to that of the linear friction in Sec. IV [392]. The relevant Hamiltonian of the coupling of the mode to a thermal bath is quadratic in the mode coordinate to allow for the processes where two vibrational quanta of the mode are created or annihilated,\nH (nl) i = q 2h (nl) b . (52)\nHere h (nl) b depends on the dynamical variables of the bath. Similar to the analysis of linear friction, one can express the coefficient of nonlinear friction \u0393(nl) in terms of the susceptibility of the bath with respect to the mode \u03c7 (nl) b (\u03c9),\n\u0393(nl) = ~\u22121q40 Im \u03c7 (nl) b (2\u03c90), q0 = (~/2M\u03c90) 1/2, (53)\nThe susceptibility \u03c7 (nl) b (\u03c9) is related by the fluctuationdissipation relation (17) to the power spectrum S (nl) b (\u03c9) of the coupling h (nl) b calculated disregarding the effect of the mode on the bath,\nS (nl) b (\u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e \u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9t\u3008h(nl)b (t)h (nl) b (0)\u3009.\nIf the fluctuation spectrum S (nl) b (\u03c9) is flat over a broad frequency range that significantly exceeds 2\u03c90, the classical dynamics of the mode is the Brownian motion described by Eq. (2) with an additional term of the van der Pol friction force\nfVdP = \u22124M\u0393(nl)(q/q0)2q\u0307. (54)\nIn the classical temperature range kBT ~\u03c90, from Eq. (53), \u0393(nl) \u221d q40/~ \u221d ~, and therefore ~ drops out of the nonlinear friction coefficient \u0393(nl)/q20 . Important for a phenomenological description of nonlinear friction is that the thermal noise that comes along with the friction force fVdP in Eq. (2) depends on the mode coordinate.\nIn the case of weakly damped modes, which is of interest for nanomechanics, the dynamics can be understood without requiring that S (nl) b (\u03c9) be flat over the range from \u03c9 = 0 to \u03c9 2\u03c90. It suffices that S(nl)b (\u03c9) is smooth in the range centered at 2\u03c90 with a width that largely exceeds \u0393,\u0393(nl) . The classical motion can be conveniently described using the slowly varying complex amplitude u(t), Eq. (20); again, here we assume that the polaronic frequency shift has been incorporated into \u03c90. Instead of Eq. (21), the equation for u(t) now reads [394]\nu\u0307 =\u2212 \u0393u\u2212 ( 2\u0393(nl)\nq20 \u2212 i 3\u03b3 2\u03c90\n) u|u|2\n+ \u03be(t) + u\u2217\u03be(nl)(t) (55)\nwhere \u03be(nl)(t) is white Gaussian noise, \u3008\u03be(nl)(t)[\u03be(nl)(t\u2032)]\u2217\u3009 = (4\u0393(nl)kBT/~\u03c90)\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032) [we use the Stratonovich convention [10] for the multiplicative noise u\u2217(t)\u03be(nl)(t)]. The nonlinear friction term in\nEq. (55) has the same form both for the van der Pol and Rayleigh phenomenological nonlinear friction forces. We emphasize that, if the nonlinear friction comes from the coupling to a thermal reservoir, the associated noise term necessarily depends on the dynamical variables of the mode, as seen from the last term in Eq. (55).\nAlong with the nonlinear friction, we have included into Eq. (55) the Duffing nonlinearity, cf. Appendix A 1. The coupling to the bath of the form (52) leads to a renormalization of the Duffing parameter \u03b3 [392], which we assume to have been done.\nNonlinear friction in nanomechanical resonators was first measured in driven spectra by exciting the system to a comparatively large vibration amplitude [86, 395]. Such friction results notably in the mechanical linewidth that changes as the vibration amplitude is increased. It can be also observed in ring-down measurements [359], where the decay rate varies as the vibration amplitude gets lower. The systems featuring nonlinear friction include carbon nanotubes as well as single- and multilayer graphene resonators [32, 86, 372, 396\u2013398], PdAu nanobeams [395], silicon MEMS [399], and Si3N4 membranes with engineered modes [400]. A strong nonlinear friction was observed in a micromechanical resonator submerged into liquid helium at ultralow temperatures; it was related to the amplitude-dependent attachment of vortices and provided a probe of quantized vorticity [401]. Nonlinear friction plays an important role in the dynamics of coupled resonators when they are driven into the regime of self-sustained vibrations [402, 403]. It also strongly affects parametric resonance [404], and the related features can be used to develop new types of phaselocked loops [405]. Another application demonstrated by Chen et al. [406] is self-sustained micromechanical vibrations in a system with linear feedback.\nAs seen from Eq. (53), the nonlinear friction is comparatively large if the power spectrum of the thermal bath, and thus the susceptibility Im \u03c7 (nl) b (\u03c9) \u221d S (nl) b (\u03c9) are large for \u03c9 \u2248 2\u03c90. This happens if the considered mode is coupled to a mode with frequency close to 2\u03c90 and a relaxation rate much higher than \u0393,\u0393(nl). The nonlinear friction in this case corresponds to the process where two quanta of the considered mode scatter into a quantum of the second mode.\nFigure 11 shows an experiment demonstrating the effect [398]. The effective nonlinear friction of the parametrically driven lowest mode of a graphene nanodrum is seen to strongly increase with the drive amplitude, and thus with the vibration amplitude, where the drive frequency \u03c9p \u2248 2\u03c90 was close to the eigenfrequency of the next lowest drum modes. In this system the inequality between the relaxation rates was not sufficiently strong and to describe the observations it was necessary to go beyond the approximation of linear response of the higher-frequency mode underlying Eq. (53). This explains the behavior of the effective nonlinear damping in Fig. 11.\nNonlinear friction can be engineered by parametrically\n28\ndriving coupled mechanical modes at proper combination frequencies. The friction coefficient can be made not only positive, but also negative depending on the drive frequency [379]. In microwave electromagnetic cavities, a positive nonlinear friction was engineered in order to create long-lived coherent quantum states, including cat states that can encode qubit states [407, 408]."

Respectively, the vibrations remain close to sinusoidal. However, the change of the dynamics can be dramatic. It is determined by the nontrivial interplay of the nonlinearity and linear damping."

            "heading": "1. Spectral effects of the Duffing nonlinearity",
            "text": "For not too large vibration amplitudes, the primary effect of the conservative nonlinearity is the dependence of the vibration frequency on the mode amplitude, Eq. (48), or mode amplitudes, for coupled modes, Eq. (51). Due to this dependence, the amplitude fluctuations of the mode (or, in quantum terms, fluctuations of the state populations) are converted into eigenfrequency fluctuations. This leads to spectral broadening and the overall change of the shape of the spectra, making the spectra profoundly non-Lorentzian. The theory of the spectra was first considered in several limiting cases in the quantum regime by Ivanov et al. [409]. Later a full classical and quantum theory was developed by Dykman and Krivoglaz [385, 386]. Experimentally, the Duff-\ning nonlinearity-induced evolution of the spectra with the varying fluctuation intensity was explored in different types of systems, such as silicon nitride nanobeams [47], levitated silica nanoparticles [410, 411], and a micromechanical trampoline resonator [361]. [47] studied not only the evolution of the power spectrum of NEMS with the varying noise intensity, but also the in-phase and quadrature components of forced vibrations, which give the imaginary and real parts of the susceptibility of a mode with Duffing nonlinearity.\nThe classical physics of the effect can be readily understood [385] by noting that, in thermal equilibrium, the vibration amplitude fluctuates. In the harmonic approximation, the energy of the mode is M\u03c920A\n2/2, where A is the vibration amplitude. Respectively, the mean square amplitude is \u3008A2\u3009 = 2kBT/M\u03c920 . The amplitude fluctuations lead to the spread of the vibration frequency. From Eq. (48), this spread, i.e., the characteristic magnitude of the frequency fluctuations is \u03b4\u03c90 = 3|\u03b3|\u3008A2\u3009/8\u03c90. A critically important parameter is the relation between \u03b4\u03c90 and the decay rate \u0393, i.e, the parameter\n\u03b10 = \u03b4\u03c90/2\u0393 = 3\u03b3kBT/8M\u03c9 3 0\u0393. (56)\nIt can be called the motional narrowing parameter, to draw the similarity (although somewhat indirect) with the motional narrowing effect in nuclear magnetic resonance [412, 413].\nIndeed, the parameter \u0393\u22121 is the correlation time of the amplitude fluctuations in the absence of nonlinear friction, cf. Eqs. (21) and (55), and thus the correlation time of the frequency fluctuations due to the Duffing nonlinearity. For |\u03b10| 1 the correlation time is small compared to the time (\u03b4\u03c90)\n\u22121. Then the frequency fluctuations are averaged out and \u03b4\u03c90 gives just a characteristic shift of the mode frequency while the width of the spectrum is determined primarily by the decay rate \u0393. This is similar to the fast averaging of fluctuations that underlies nuclear magnetic resonance in liquids.\nOn the other hand, for |\u03b10| 1, the spectrum of the oscillator can be thought of as a superposition of \u201cpartial spectra\u201d centered at the frequencies \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90 that depend on the instantaneous value of the amplitude A. The multitude of the frequencies is an analog of the inhomogeneous broadening in solid state spectroscopy. The contribution of a partial spectrum at frequency \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90 to the whole spectrum is determined by the probability density of having a given \u03b4\u03c90, which is determined by the Boltzmann distribution over \u03b4\u03c90 \u221d A2. The overall width of the spectrum is \u223c \u03b4\u03c90 \u0393, i.e., the spectral width is determined by the nonlinearity, not the decay, and the spectrum is strongly non-Lorentzian and asymmetric. The quantum picture is discussed in Appendix E.\nThe intermediate range |\u03b10| \u223c 1 is most interesting theoretically, as it shows how the partial spectra of the limit |\u03b10| 1 shrink and deform with the decreasing nonlinearity or fluctuation intensity. Somewhat surprisingly, the spectrum is nevertheless described by a simple explicit expression both in the classical and quantum do-\n29\nmains [385, 386], see Appendix E. Figure 35 shows the evolution of the spectrum with the varying \u03b10.\nDispersive nonlinear coupling between the modes affects the spectrum in a similar way [385, 386]. As seen from Eq. (51), the typical spread of the frequency of mode n = 0 due to fluctuations of the amplitude of mode m > 0 is \u03b4\u03c90 = 3|\u03b300mm|\u3008A2m\u3009/4\u03c9m. The correlation time of the relevant fluctuations is the reciprocal decay rate \u0393\u22121m of the mode m. Therefore for \u03b4\u03c90 & \u0393m the spectrum is broadened and becomes non-Lorentzian, see Appendix E. The corresponding spectral broadening has been suggested as a major broadening mechanism for flexural modes in carbon nanotubes [365], graphene sheets [372], doubly clamped beams [370, 388] as well as microcantilevers[389].\nFigure 12 presents experimental results, which show how the power spectrum and the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are changed with the varying noise intensity. Panel (a) refers to the case where the dispersive coupling to other modes is small. The spectrum is determined by the internal mode nonlinearity and its shape evolves from a Lorentzian to a strongly asymmetric peak with the increasing \u03b10. Panel (b), on the other hand, illustrates the effect of nonlinear dispersive mode coupling. The internal Duffing nonlinearity could be disregarded. The shape of the spectrum depends on the scaled coupling parameter \u03b11 = 3\u03b30011kBT/4M\u03c90\u03c9 2 1\u03931.\nAn interesting behavior occurs where the number of the modes dispersively coupled to the considered mode is large, even though the coupling to each mode taken separately is small. In this case the power spectrum S(\u03c9) may become Gaussian in its central part [414], as first found numerically by Barnard et al. [365], see Appendix E 4.\nDispersive coupling could be used for quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons [415]. In such a measurement, the number of phonons of one mode would be continuously measured by recording the resonance frequency of the second mode. A realization of such an experiment in nanomechanics is challenging, since it requires strong dispersive coupling compared to the decay rates of the modes."

            "text": "A promising direction of nanomechanics is the study of the effects of coupling of nanomechanical vibrations to controllable two-level systems, qubits. The involved physics is closely related to the physics of the electronic states of defects coupled to phonons in solids [416], NV centers being one of the defects of utmost current interest. Coupling nanomechanical modes to qubits opens a path toward studying the electron-phonon effects with an unprecedented control. It also provides new means to manipulate and measure the quantum states of mechanical resonators operating in the GHz range [149\u2013 151, 417, 418]. Compared to superconducting resonators, GHz mechanical resonators can have longer lifetimes [29]\nand are usually much more compact [419]. These systems hold promise for scalable qubit architectures where quantum information is stored in bosonic systems [420\u2013 422].\nIn the systems studied so far, the qubit-mode coupling energy was smaller than the mode level spacing ~\u03c90. In this case, if the level spacing of the qubit ~\u03c9qbt is significantly different from ~\u03c90, of primary interest is the study of the dispersive coupling. Such coupling has attracted much attention in solid-state physics [423]. If the qubit is described as a spin-1/2 system with the Hamiltonian Hqbt = ~\u03c9qbt\u03c3z/2, where \u03c3z is the Pauli matrix, the dispersive coupling to the nanomechanical mode has the form\nHqbti = 1\n2 ~\u03b3qbt\u03c3zq2, (57)\nwhere \u03b3qbt determines the coupling energy.\n30\nThe ensuing physics is very similar to the physics of dispersively coupled vibrational modes. If one thinks of the mode vibrations classically, one can see that the coupling-induced change of the qubit transition frequency is determined by the vibration amplitude A,\n\u03b4\u03c9qbt = 1\n2 \u03b3qbtA\n2.\nIn the classical limit, kBT ~\u03c90, the shape of the qubit spectrum is determined by the ratio of the characteristic value of the frequency shift \u03b4\u03c9qbt = \u03b3qbtkBT/M\u03c9 2 0 to the reciprocal correlation time of the frequency fluctuations \u0393, going from the \u201cmotional narrowing\u201d regime where this ratio is small to the \u201cinhomogeneous broadening\u201d regime where it is large.\nIn the quantum regime, \u03b4\u03c9qbt takes on discrete values that correspond to different occupation numbers n0 of the vibrational mode,\n\u03b4\u03c9qbt(n0) = (~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90)(n0 + 1/2). (58)\nIf (~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90) \u0393(2n\u0304+1), the lines at \u03c9qbt +\u03b4\u03c9qbt(n0) with different n0 weakly overlap. This leads to a fine structure of the qubit spectrum and enables identifying the population of the mode Fock states |n0\u3009. The shape of the lines of the fine structure is close to Lorentzian, with halfwidth \u0393qbt +2\u0393[n\u0304(2n0 +1)+n0] that linearly increases with n0, similar to the case of dispersively coupled modes, cf. Eqs. (E4) - (E7); here \u0393qbt is the halfwidth of the qubit spectral line in the absence of coupling to the mode. Such a regime is an analog of the inhomogeneous broadening.\nIf (~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90) . \u0393(2n\u0304+1), the lines with different n0 overlap. In this case quantum mechanics does not allow one to identify individual Fock states from the spectrum. As explained in Appendix E, the amplitudes of the transitions with different n0 are coupled. The overall qubit spectrum shrinks down with the decreasing ~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90\u0393. Where this parameter is small the contribution of the dispersive coupling to the halfwidth of the qubit spectrum is (~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90\u0393)2\u0393n\u0304(n\u0304+1)/2 [424]. For systems in thermal equilibrium, the spectrum for an arbitrary ~\u03b3qbt/M\u03c90\u0393 was described by Dykman and Krivoglaz [425]. Using a qubit to study the vibration-number statistics in the case of a driven mode was considered by Clerk and Utami [426].\nIn Fig. 13 we present the results of the measurements of the spectrum of Josephson junction qubits coupled to a membrane resonator [427] and to a high-frequency phononic crystal defect [152]. In the first system there was studied the regime where a large number of vibrational states was occupied, whereas in the second system it was possible to reach small occupation numbers and to resolve the fine structure of the spectrum.\nIt should be noted that the experiments by ArrangoizArriola et al. [152] and a part of the experiments by Viennot et al. [427] were performed where the vibrational system was away from thermal equilibrium. The full analysis of the spectrum in this case requires taking into\naccount the coupling of the complex amplitudes of transitions between the states of the mode in the transient regime [428, 429].\n31"

The effect depends on temperature even where the nonlinear friction coefficient \u0393(nl) defined by Eq. (53) is temperatureindependent. In the classical limit, this is clear already from Eq. (55). Indeed, the nonlinear friction force is increasing with the increasing vibration amplitude. Therefore, as the mean squared amplitude is increasing with the increasing temperature, so is the nonlinear friction force.\nIt is seen from Eq. (55) that, since in thermal equilibrium \u3008|u|2\u3009 = kBT/2M\u03c920 , the characteristic parameter of nonlinear friction in the classical theory is 2\u0393(nl)kBT/~\u03c90.

Its width increases with the increasing nonlinear friction, and thus with the increasing temperature.\nGenerally, both nonlinear friction and conservative nonlinearity are present in NEMS and MEMS. Their interplay leads to characteristic features in the spectrum which should allow one to identify the presence of the both mechanisms [392]. An important indicator of the effect of the conservative nonlinearity, which has been seen in experiments, is an asymmetry of the spectrum. We are not aware of experiments where a change of the spectrum due to nonlinear friction would have been established.

            "text": "One of the simplest and yet very rich nonlinear effects studied in nanomechanics is hysteresis of the vibrations excited by applying a close to resonant driving force. The hysteresis emerges when the frequency \u03c9F or the amplitude F of a moderately strong drive is swept across a certain range. The onset of the hysteresis is a consequence of coexistence of two stable vibrational states of the nonlinear mode, i.e., of the mode bistability [430]. Such hysteresis was observed in nanomechanical systems early on [431]. In most cases it is well described already by the simplest model of the vibration nonlinearity, the Duffing model introduced in Sec. VI. In this section we will concentrate on the nonlinear resonant response described by this model.\nA phenomenological equation of motion (2) extended to include the close to resonance driving F cos\u03c9F t and the Duffing nonlinearity reads\nMq\u0308 + 2M\u0393q\u0307 +M\u03c920q +M\u03b3q 3\n= F cos\u03c9F t+ fT (t), |\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90| \u03c90. (59)\nQualitatively, the occurrence of two stable vibrational states in the absence of noise can be inferred in the following way, cf. Fig. 14. Suppose the drive frequency \u03c9F is close to the eigenfrequency \u03c90, but the detuning |\u03c9F \u2212\u03c90| considerably exceeds the decay rate. Then one may expect that the amplitude of the forced vibrations is comparatively small. It is given by the value A1 in Fig. 14. However, the nonlinearity leads to a change of the mode frequency \u03b4\u03c90 with the mode amplitude, as described by Eq. (48). If the vibration amplitude is sufficiently large and takes on the value A2 in Fig. 14, the shifted frequency \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90 can become very close to \u03c9F , so that there is strong resonance. Such resonance will make vibrations with the corresponding large amplitude self-consistent. This leads to two stable states: Forced vibrations can either have large amplitude and be at good resonance or have small amplitude and be detuned from the resonance.\nSemi-quantitatively, the onset of bistability can be understood already using the susceptibility of the oscillator \u03c7(\u03c9). By the definition of the susceptibility, the squared amplitude of forced vibrations is A2 = |\u03c7(\u03c9F )|2F 2. If we now use for \u03c7(\u03c9) the familiar expression (5) for the susceptibility of a harmonic oscillator, but replace the eigenfrequency \u03c90 \u2192 \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90 with \u03b4\u03c90 given by Eq. (48), the resulting equation for the squared amplitude reads\nA2 = F 2\n(2M\u03c90)2\n[ \u03932 + ( \u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90 \u2212 3\u03b3A2\n8\u03c90\n)2]\u22121 . (60)\nThis equation describes the above qualitative arguments of \u201ctuning\u201d the mode in and out of good resonance, i.e., varying the detuning \u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90 \u2212 3\u03b3A2/8\u03c90 by changing A. Formally, Eq. (60) is a cubic equation for A2, and it can have three solutions. The solutions with the smallest\n32\nand the largest A2 can be shown to be stable [430]. The characteristic dependence of the amplitude A on the drive frequency detuning \u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90 for a nanowire measured by Kozinsky et al. [55] is shown in Fig. 15(a).\nThe dynamics of a resonantly driven mode is conventionally described in terms of the in-phase and quadrature components Q and P , respectively. They correspond to the coordinate and momentum of the mode in the rotating frame,\nq(t) = Q cos\u03c9F t+ P sin\u03c9F t, p(t) = M\u03c9F (\u2212Q sin\u03c9F t+ P cos\u03c9F t). (61)\nThe dynamical variables Q and P are advantageous from the point of view of the experiment, as they can be directly measured with a lock-in amplifier by setting its frequency to \u03c9F . We note that (Q \u2212 iP )/2 has the same form as the complex amplitude u(t) introduced in Eq. (20) except that the frequency \u03c90 in Eq. (20) is replaced by \u03c9F . In terms of Q and P , the vibration amplitude is (Q2 + P 2)1/2 and the phase is \u2212 arctan(P/Q). In quantum description, Q and P are operators, with [Q,P ] = i~M\u03c9F .\nThe transient dynamics of the mode can be pictured in terms of the motion on the (Q,P )-plane, which is the phase plane in the rotating frame, see Appendix D 1. The time evolution of Q and P is slow compared to the fast oscillations at frequency \u03c9F . The stationary values of Q and P describe the stationary states of vibrations at frequency \u03c9F in the laboratory frame, as seen from Eq. (61). These values correspond to points on the (Q,P )-plane. If the mode has one stable vibrational state, there is one such point. In the range of bistability, there are three stationary states on the (Q,P )-plane. Two of them correspond to the stable vibrational states with different amplitudes and phases, and the third one corresponds to an unstable state (a saddle point). The whole (Q,P )-plane is divided into two regions: if prepared initially in one region, the mode evolves toward one stable state, whereas from the other region it evolves to the other stable state.\n[55] managed to directly map the (Q,P )-plane of a driven nonlinear mode and identify the basins of attraction to different stable states using the vibrations of a doubly clamped platinum nanowire, which were actuated and detected magnetomotively. The results are shown in Fig. 15 (a) and (c).\nThe number of stable vibrational states changes at the bifurcation parameter values, i.e., at the bifurcation points. These points lie on the lines in the space of the\n33\nparameters of the driving force (F, \u03c9F ), as illustrated in Fig. 15(b). On the upper (black) line the small-amplitude state merges with the unstable state. The experimental results [55] in Fig. 15 (c) show how, with the increasing driving amplitude, the small-amplitude state (state 1) approaches the unstable state (panels 1 - 5). Ultimately both these states disappear (panel 6) and the mode has only one stable vibrational state.\nA resonantly driven mode can display bistability if, in addition to conservative nonlinearity, the friction force is also nonlinear. In the presence of nonlinear friction the decay rate is amplitude-dependent. This can be described by replacing \u0393 \u2192 \u0393 + \u0393(nl)A2/2q20 in Eq. (60). The dynamics of the mode in this case was studied by Buks and Yurke [209]."

The corresponding pumping can be described as the modulation of the vibration eigenfrequency \u03c90 at a frequency \u03c9p close to 2\u03c90. If the modulation is weak, it does not excite vibrations, the equilibrium state q = p = 0 is stable. However, a sufficiently strong modulation can make this state unstable. It leads to an onset of two stable vibrational states. In each of these states the system vibrates at frequency \u03c9p/2. The phases of the vibrations are fixed by the modulation parameters and differ by \u03c0 in the different states. In the optics terms, the system is sometimes called a degenerate parametric oscillator to emphasize that the vibration frequencies are the same in the both states. Arguably, such parametrically excited vibrations provide the simplest example of the onset of period doubling in a nonlinear system, since their period is twice the period of the driving.\nThe condition for the onset of period-2 vibrations and their amplitude can be obtained using the same naive arguments that led to Eq.

However, the resonant force has now to be written with the account taken of the fact that we are seeking vibrations of the form q(t) = A cos[(\u03c9pt/2)+\u03c6], and therefore the resonant part of the force qFp cos\u03c9pt is (AFp/2) cos[[(\u03c9pt/2)\u2212 \u03c6] (the phase \u03c6 has to be found separately). Substituting this expression for the force into the equation for the amplitude gives A2 = |\u03c7(\u03c9p/2)|2(AFp/2)2. Using for the susceptibility the same expression as in Eq. (60) we ob-\ntain that either A = 0, i.e., there are no vibrations, or\nFp 2\n(4M\u03c90)2\n[ \u03932 + ( \u03b4\u03c9p \u2212 3\u03b3A2\n8\u03c90\n)2]\u22121 = 1,\n\u03b4\u03c9p = (\u03c9p/2)\u2212 \u03c90. (63)\nEquation (63) shows in particular that vibrations at frequency \u03c9p/2 are excited provided the modulation is sufficiently strong to overcome the dissipation, |Fp|/4M\u03c90 > \u0393. As in the case of the resonant driving discussed in Sec. VII A above, in the presence of nonlinear friction one should replace in Eq. (63) \u0393\u2192 \u0393 + \u0393(nl)A2/2q20 .\nEquation (63) is a quadratic equation for A2. It shows that, besides the zero-amplitude state where A = 0, the modulated mode can have either one or two pairs of period-2 states, depending on whether Eq. (63) has one or two positive roots A2 > 0. The stability of these states and the overall dynamics of a parametrically modulated mode can be conveniently described by changing from q(t), p(t) to the quadratures Q(t), P (t). The corresponding transformation is similar to Eq. (61),\nq + ip/(M\u03c9p/2) = (Q+ iP ) exp(\u2212i\u03c9pt/2).\nThe equations for the quadratures Q,P are given in Appendix D 2. The stable period-2 states correspond to the symmetrically located fixed points on the phase plane (Q,P ).\nThe parameter ranges where a parametrically modulated mode has different numbers of coexisting states are separated by the bifurcation lines shown in Fig. 16 (a,b). An example of the hysteretic behavior of parametrically modulated nanoresonators is shown in Fig. 16 (c). The experimental data by Karabalin et al. [432] shown in this figure were obtained using doubly clamped piezoelectrically controlled nanobeams. In the simplest case, the occurrence of the hysteresis is a consequence of nonlinear friction. As seen from Fig. 16 (b), if one increases the frequency (the parameter \u00b5p) starting from the negative value, there are excited period-2 vibrations once the blue line \u00b5B1 is crossed. These vibrational states disappear once the green dashed line is crossed. On the other hand, if one starts from above the green dashed line and decreases the frequency, the zero-amplitude state remains stable until the magenta line \u00b5B2 is crossed. It is possible to break the symmetry between the two parametrically driven states that differ by \u03c0 in the phase by applying a force at \u03c9p/2 [433], as measured by Mahboob et al. [434] and [435]."

            "text": "An important generic feature of fluctuations of a periodically driven mode follows from the very fact that the driving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry of the mode dynamics. An immediate consequence of the symmetry breaking is the possibility of fluctuation squeezing. In squeezing, fluctuations of one of the vibrational components (quadratures) are reduced below their level in the absence of driving, whereas fluctuations of the other component are increased. In the absence of driving, the quadratures are the vibration components that oscillate as cos\u03c90t and sin\u03c90t. If the system has a continuous symmetry, the origin of time can be shifted. A shift in time by \u03c0/2\u03c90 results in the interchange of the quadratures. This shows that the variances of their fluctuations should be equal. A periodically driven system, in contrast, has a discrete time-translation symmetry. It is symmetric only with respect to changing time by the period of the drive. Therefore the quadratures may no longer be interchanged and their variances are generally different.\nHistorically, squeezing was first detected in quantum optics [436]. It attracted significant attention, since it\ncan reduce fluctuations of a quadrature below their level in the quantum ground state of the mode and thus enable high-precision measurements [437]. The technique has been implemented in laser interferometers for gravitational wave detection [438, 439]. In nano- and micromechanical systems, squeezing in the quantum regime was demonstrated using the techniques of cavity optomechanics, [153, 155, 338].\nHowever, the concept of squeezing of fluctuations in vibrational systems equally applies to the classical regime. Squeezing of thermal fluctuations of nanomechanical systems has been achieved in several experiments using parametric pumping [114, 440, 441]. The squeezing is obtained with a comparatively weak pumping, below the threshold for exciting period-2 vibrations. For weak noise, it can be described disregarding the mode nonlinearity, see Appendix D 2.\nFigure 17a shows the measurements of the thermal vibration noise represented in the (Q,P )-phase plane [442]. The quadratures are measured with a lock-in amplifier by setting its frequency to \u03c90. Without pump, the variances of both quadratures are the same, as expected for the continuous time symmetry of the problem. When the resonator is parametrically driven at 2\u03c90, the variances are no longer equal, pointing to time-translation symmetry breaking. The variance of the Q-quadrature is squeezed by the parametric drive. The strongest squeezing corresponds to 3 dB variance suppression, which is reached when the P quadrature diverges (Fig. 17b).\nWith feedback control [443\u2013446] it was possible to achieve squeezing by 15.1dB [442], well above the conventional 3 dB limit for parametric pumping of a linear mode, cf. Eq. (D14). Classical two-mode squeezing in mechanical resonators by non-degenerate parametric amplification has been also reported [377, 447, 448] as well as the possibility to obtain squeezing in a two-mode system using post-selection [449]. Classical squeezing was proposed as a way to reduce heating in computers [450]; it also represents an important asset for high-precision sensing [441, 444, 451, 452] and thus may lead to a new generation of nanomechanical detectors.\nMuch less attention has been paid to squeezing of mode fluctuations due to a resonant coordinate-independent force, cf. Eq. (59). The general argument regarding the broken time-translation symmetry applies in this case, too. However, for a driven linear mode, forced vibrations are just linearly superimposed on thermal vibrations, and therefore there is no squeezing. The situation changes in the nonlinear regime. Here the fluctuations are affected by the driving and the effect can be resonantly strong.\nFor weak noise, a resonantly driven mode primarily fluctuates about its state of forced vibrations. These are the fluctuations of the deviations of the quadratures \u03b4Q, \u03b4P from their values in the stable state that become squeezed in the nonlinear regime. The occurrence of the squeezing could be inferred from the strongly asymmetric phase trajectories in the rotating frame in the neglect of dissipation in Fig. 33 (b), which were discussed already in\n35\nthe early work on a resonantly driven Duffing oscillator [453, 454], cf. also [455]. A theory of squeezing was developed by Buks and Yurke [209]. A strong suppression of a spectral component of a quadrature was observed in a nanomechanical Duffing resonator by Almog et al. [456] in a narrow parameter range near the critical point in Fig. 15 (b) using conventional homodyne detection.\nHomodyne measurements are strongly impeded by frequency fluctuations, which play an important role in nanomechanical systems, see Sec. IX. The limitations are particularly pronounced in systems with small damping, where the noise in the in-phase component increases with the increasing drive strength [457], see Fig. 30. However, it appears that, for underdamped vibrational modes, squeezing can be found by measuring the spectrum of their response to an additional weak probe field [458] or, for classical fluctuations, by measuring the power spectrum [459].\nThe spectral measurements of squeezing exploits the nature of the dynamics of a driven strongly underdamped mode. When viewed in the rotating frame, this dynamics involves weakly damped oscillations about a stable state of forced vibrations, as described in Appendix D 2 b. The frequency of these oscillations \u03c9rot is much smaller than the strong-drive frequency \u03c9F . When viewed in the laboratory frame, they lead to peaks in the power spectrum at frequencies \u03c9F \u00b1 \u03c9rot.\nFigure 18 shows the power spectrum of fluctuations of a resonantly driven NVS mode with clearly resolved peaks at \u03c9F \u00b1 \u03c9rot [459]. The peaks have profoundly different intensities, a direct consequence of squeezing.\nThe peaks at \u03c9F \u00b1 \u03c9rot emerge also in the spectrum\nof the response to an additional weak probe field. The ratio of the areas A\u00b1 of these spectral peaks gives the squeezing parameter \u03c6 [362, 460, 461],\n\u3008\u03b4Q2\u3009 \u3008\u03b4P 2\u3009 = e \u22124\u03c6, coth4 \u03c6 = A+ A\u2212 . (64)\nThis expression holds for thermal and quantum fluctuations about the larger-amplitude vibrational state in the range of bistability, cf. Fig. 15 (b); for the smalleramplitude state one should replace coth\u03c6\u2192 tanh\u03c6.\nOne of the peaks of the response spectrum corresponds to amplification of the probe field by the strong driving field [362, 453]. A distinctly double-peak structure of the response spectrum in a suspended nanomembrane was seen by Antoni et al. [462]."

            "text": "Classical and quantum fluctuations in driven nanomechanical systems are not described by the statistical physics of systems in thermal equilibrium, and their probabilities are not determined by the thermodynamic potentials. Revealing general features of such fluctuations is both challenging and important. To a large extent, these features are related to the absence of detailed balance. Detailed balance requires that, in the stationary regime, the probabilities of transitions between the states of a system be balanced pairwise. This means that the probability of a transition A \u2192 B between arbitrary states A and B is equal to the probability of the transition B\u0304 \u2192 A\u0304. Here the overline indicates that, in the corresponding states, the signs of odd in time variables have been reversed [463]; we assume that there is no magnetic\n36\nfield. For a classical vibrational mode, one can associate the mode states with small areas in phase space; for states A and B these areas are centered at points qA, pA and qB , pB , whereas A\u0304 and B\u0304 are centered at qA,\u2212pA and qB ,\u2212pB , respectively.\nDetailed balance is a requisite of thermal equilibrium. It differs from the stationarity condition that the probability to go from A to B, C, etc is equal to the total probability to come to A from B, C, etc. Driven nonlinear modes do not have detailed balance, as a rule, cf. [464]. They have proved to be invaluable as a means to study statistical physics with no detailed balance because, on the one hand, they are comparatively simple while, on the other hand, they display a nontrivial behavior.\n1. Dynamics of nonequilibrium systems in rare large fluctuations\nOf special interest in terms of their generic features are nonequilibrium phenomena related to comparatively rare large fluctuations away from a stable state and switching between coexisting stable states. These phenomena encompass chemical and biological reactions as well as switching in lasers, driven nano-magnets, and other systems of current interest. Even though much work has been done on the theory of switching in systems lacking detailed balance, to the best of our knowledge, vibrational systems have been the only ones where the theory could be quantitatively tested in the experiment. Moreover, with these systems the qualitative features of large rare fluctuations, including the involved scaling behavior, have been studied.\nFor weak on average fluctuations, most of the time the system performs small-amplitude fluctuations about its stable state (or one of its dynamically stable states). Still occasionally there occur large fluctuations, in which the system moves far away from this state in phase space. They may result in switching to another stable state.\nA key idea behind the understanding of large rare fluctuations was put forward by Onsager and Machlup [465] and Machlup and Onsager [466] in the analysis of linear thermal equilibrium systems. They showed that, very counter-intuitively, in a large fluctuation to a given point in phase space, even though the motion is random, a system most likely moves along a certain trajectory. Moreover, for an overdamped system this trajectory is the time-reversed trajectory of moving back to the stable state from this point in the absence of fluctuations.\nThe concept of the corresponding most probable trajectory of a rare fluctuation extends to nonlinear systems and to nonequilibrium systems. However, in systems lacking detailed balance finding such a trajectory is a far from trivial problem, and the topology of such trajectories is also far from trivial [467]. This problem is fundamental in the theory of nonequilibrium systems, from physics to biology. It attracted much attention over the years [468].\nA direct experimental observation of the most probable trajectory in a system lacking detailed balance was done with a micromechanical system [353, 469], see Fig. 19(a). The system was parametrically driven into the range where it had two stable vibrational states A1 and A2, see Sec. D 2. A comparatively weak noise caused mostly small-amplitude fluctuations about the states, but occasionally also led to interstate switching. In the experiment, the system was prepared in the state A1 and its trajectory was recorded. After it was found in the vicinity of the state A2, a portion of the trajectory in the region between the blue lines in Fig. 19 (b) was saved and the experiment was repeated. The distribution p12 of the paths followed in switching was obtained by superposing the saved portions of the trajectories.\nThe sharp peak of the distribution in Fig. 19 (a) shows that indeed, in switching the system is most likely to move along a certain path, the most probable switching path (MPSP). Except for the vicinity of the saddle point Q = P = 0, the distribution of the trajectories about the MPSP was Gaussian and was in full agreement with the theory, which extended the previously developed approach [470, 471] to the problem of switching. For switching from the zero-amplitude state of a parametrically excited microcantilever, observation of switching paths was reported by Requa and Turner [472].\nFigure 19 (c) compares the MPSP (red line) with the noise-free trajectory (magenta line) along which the system would move from the saddle point to state A1. It clearly shows that these trajectories do not have time-reversal symmetry, which would be the symmetry (Q,P )\u2192 (Q,\u2212P ). This is an unambiguous indication of the lack of detailed balance.\nThe form of the MPSP depends not only on the dynamics of the system in the absence of fluctuations, but also on the source of the fluctuations, that is, on the properties of the noise, including its spectrum and statistics. The results in Fig. 19 refer to the case where the noise is thermal, cf. Eq. (62), and therefore is Gaussian and white in slow time, see Sec. IV."

            "heading": "2. Scaling behavior of the rates of switching between stable vibrational states",
            "text": "Quite generally, for a Gaussian and not necessarily white noise the rate of switching between coexisting stable states scales with the noise intensity D as [473]\nWsw = Csw exp(\u2212R/D). (65)\nThis expression is similar to the expression by Kramers [474] for the escape rate of a Brownian particle from a potential well. For the Brownian particle the noise intensity is kBT and R = \u2206U , where \u2206U is the height of the potential barrier to be overcome in escape. In analogy with the Arrhenius law, R is often called the effective activation energy. To the best of our knowledge, a vibrational mode resonantly driven into bistability was\n37\nthe first physical system with no detail balance where R was calculated [453]. Both R and the prefactor Csw in Eq. (65) are independent of the noise intensity.\nThe activation dependence of the switching rate on the noise intensity was demonstrated for a parametrically excited vibrational mode of a single electron in a Penning trap [475]. It has been observed in various types of nanoand micromechanical resonators driven into bistability by either resonant driving force or parametric driving close to twice the mode eigenfrequency, see [56, 476\u2013480] and references therein. An example is shown in Fig. 20 (a).\nAnother feature of switching in nonequilibrium systems is the scaling behavior of the switching rates, where the activation energy R \u221d | lnWsw| scales as a power\nlaw of the parameters. For equilibrium systems, where R corresponds to the barrier height \u2206U , such scaling was predicted for Josephson junctions [481] for the regime where a junction is not driven by an ac field and is in a quasiequilibrium state. This scaling has been broadly used to determine the junction parameters [482].\nGenerally, the scaling emerges close to bifurcation points where there disappears the stable state from which the system is switching [453, 483\u2013486]. For resonantly and parametrically driven nonlinear modes these bifurcation points lie on the lines shown in Figs. 15(b) and 16(a), (b). The scaling of Wsw near bifurcation points was seen in a number of experiments, both for resonantly driven [56, 477, 480] and parametrically modulated [478] micro- and nanomechanical modes, parametrically modulated atomic vibrations in a magneto-optical trap [487], and resonantly driven vibrations of Josephson junctions [488, 489]. The scaling exponents are different in the cases of resonant and parametric driving. Remarkably, not only the effective activation energy R scales as the power law of the distance to the bifurcation point (see Appendix D 1 a), but so does also the prefactor Csw in Eq. (65), with a different exponent [483].\nThe high degree of control of nanomechanical systems has enabled measuring the scaling exponents not only of R but also of Csw. Figure 20(b) shows the scaling behavior of R for a resonantly driven nanomechanical system [56]. The data are obtained for different points on the bifurcation line FB1 in Fig. 15(b). It was demonstrated that\nR \u221d |\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )B |3/2, Csw \u221d |\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )B |1/2\nwhere (\u03c9F )B is the bifurcational value of the drive frequency \u03c9F . Interestingly, in agreement with the numerical analysis, [56, 490] the scaling holds in a comparatively broad range.\nThe overall change of the effective activation energies of interstate switching with the varying frequency and amplitude of the driving resonant force for a nonlinear nanomechanical beam is shown in Fig. 21 (a). Besides the bifurcation points discussed above, the switching rates display a universal dependence on the parameters near the critical point Fc in Fig. 15 (b) where the two stable vibrational states merge. One can tune the drive amplitude and the frequency in such a way that the rates of switching between the states are equal, see Appendix D 1 a. In this case the activation energy R is expected to depend on the distance to the critical frequency as [\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )c]2 [453, 483]. This scaling behavior of logWsw was clearly demonstrated in the experiment, with R varying over more than two decades, see Fig. 21 (b)."

            "text": "Bistable vibrational systems allow one to study another fairly general group of nonequilibrium phenomena. They occur in the parameter range where the rates W12\n38\nand W21 of switching between the stable states 1\u2192 2 and 2\u2192 1 are close to each other; for concreteness, we use 1 and 2 to label the states of a resonantly driven mode with larger and smaller vibration amplitude, respectively. For weak noise, this happens where the effective activation energies R1 and R2 for switching 1 \u2192 2 and 2 \u2192 1 are equal or almost equal [we use that Wij \u221d exp(\u2212Ri/D)]. In this range the stationary populations w1,2 of the states are also close to each other, as seen from the balance equation w1/w2 = W21/W12. As the system parameters move away from this range, R1 and R2 becomes different, and the populations quickly become exponentially different. It is this range that was studied by Aldridge and Cleland [476] close to the critical point.\nThe range where R1 \u2248 R2 is similar to a smeared first order phase transition in an equilibrium system. Indeed, at such phase transition the free energies of the phases are equal, according to the Ehernfest classification, and the phases (for example, liquid and vapor) have comparable volumes (populations). One can conditionally associate the large- and small-amplitude vibrational states with different phases of matter. In this context, the analogs of pressure and temperature in the liquid-vapor transition, i.e., the control parameters, are the amplitude F and frequency \u03c9F of the driving field. For a certain relation between F and \u03c9F we have R1 = R2, which can be called a kinetic phase transition. The data in Fig. 21(b) are obtained by moving along the corresponding line on the (F, \u03c9F ) plane. The critical point [Fc, (\u03c9F )c] (see Figs. 15 and 21) is a counterpart of the critical point on the phase transition line.\nThe kinetic phase transition in a driven mode is accompanied by the onset of extremely narrow peaks in the power spectrum and the spectrum of the response to a probe field [453, 491]. The peaks are located at the driving frequency. They result from the change of the state populations w1 and w2 induced by fluctuations or by the probe field. Such a change leads to the change of the vibration amplitude and phase between their values in the large- and small-amplitude states. The rates at which the populations change, and thus the widths of the peaks, are \u223c W12 \u2248 W21. They are exponentially smaller then the mode decay rate. Therefore the spectra are extremely sensitive to the parameters of the system, similar to the parameter sensitivity at the phase transition in an extended system.\nA number of effects related to the kinetic phase transition, including the extremely narrow spectral peaks, have been observed in different types of resonantly driven micro- and nanomechanical systems [459, 479, 480, 492\u2013 495]. Early on it was shown [496] that these effects enable a 100-fold improvement in frequency resolution compared to a conventional resonant-response based measurement.\nWe now discuss the fluctuation-induced response to the probe field and its relation to stochastic resonance. If the probe-field frequency \u03c9pr is very close to the strong-drive frequency \u03c9F , the probe field can be thought of as a modulation of the strong field amplitude and, hence, of the\n39\nactivation energies R1,2, at frequency |\u03c9pr\u2212\u03c9F |. As seen from Eq. (65), modulation of Ri results in an exponentially enhanced modulation of Wij , for weak noise. However, if it is too fast, the populations of the states w1,2 cannot \u201cadjust\u201d to the probe field. Therefore if the noise intensity D is very small, so that Wij |\u03c9pr \u2212 \u03c9F |, the response is weak. It exponentially strongly increases with the increasing D as the rates Wij approach \u223c |\u03c9pr\u2212\u03c9F |. For large D, on the other hand the sensitivity to the modulation of R1,2 falls off. Thus the response displays a peak as a function of D. This is reminiscent of stochastic resonance in systems fluctuating in a static doublewell potential. Such high-frequency stochastic resonance was observed in micro- and nanomechanical systems, as Fig. 22 illustrates, and several applications of this effect for sensing have been discussed by Venstra et al. [479], Chan and Stambaugh [493], and Almog et al. [494].\nIn the case of resonant parametric excitation at frequency \u03c9p \u2248 2\u03c90, a mode is \u201cautomatically tuned\u201d into the kinetic phase transition. Indeed, the period-2 vibrational states have the same amplitude and differ just by phase. Noise-induced interstate transitions are phaseflip transitions, and the stationary populations of the states are equal by symmetry. However, an additional resonant additive drive at frequency \u03c9p/2 lifts this symmetry. As a result, the stationary populations become different. They depend on the phase of the extra drive with respect to the phase of the strong parametric mod-\nulation [433]. This happens already for a weak extra drive, where the both states are stable. Such symmetry lifting was observed by Mahboob et al. [434] in a GaAs/AlGaAs based micromechanical resonator. The corresponding symmetry-breaking detector can resolve frequency shifts \u03b4\u03c90/\u03c90 \u223c 10\u22127 in a single-shot measurement.\nThe fluctuation-mediated symmetry lifting has important consequences for coupled parametrically modulated modes. If a mode vibrates at frequency \u03c9p/2 and is in a state with a given phase, it exerts a symmetry-lifting force on the mode (or modes) it is coupled to. As a result, depending on the coupling, this second mode is biased toward the state with the same or the opposite phase as the primary mode. Of course, the modes are on equal footing, they affect each other so as to have the same or opposite phases, and the effect comes through the fluctuations.\nThe effect of phase ordering in coupled parametrically excited modes was demonstrated by Karabalin et al. [61]. In the experiment two almost identical gated nanobeams were driven across the parametric instability. Depending on the sign of the coupling, the mode that experienced the instability later had predominantly the same or the opposite phase as the one that went through the instability first. The coupling could be controlled by the gate voltage, which provided a highly sensitive way of detecting this voltage.\nThe phase correlations between coupled parametric oscillators mediated by noise was used by Mahboob et al. [497] to mimic the Ising dynamics of coupled spins with two modes. The two different phases of a parametrically pumped micromechanical mode were associated with two spin projections. An implementation of quantum computation [498, 499] and Boltzmann sampling [500] with coupled nonlinear parametrically excited modes has been also discussed. Of significant importance in this respect is that switching between the period-2 states of a parametrically excited mode can be induced not only by classical, but also by quantum fluctuations even for T = 0 [501]. For modulated coupled nanomechanical modes this opens a way of studying quantum phase transitions far from thermal equilibrium, in particular a transition to a Floquet time-crystalline state [502], in a well-characterized environment."

This allows one to bring nanomechanical vibrational modes in and out of linear resonance. Strictly speaking, eigenmodes are defined by diagonalizing the quadratic in the displacements and momenta part of the Hamiltonian of the system. Where the resonator modes have very different eigenfrequencies, one can speak of approximate modes, disregarding a quadratic in the displacements part of the potential energy that couples them. However, when the eigenfrequencies are tuned close to resonance, this part become substantial.\nIn the harmonic approximation, the potential energy of two modes can then be written as\nU12(q1, q2) = 1\n2 M1\u03c9\n2 1(t)q 2 1 +\n1 2 M2\u03c9 2 2(t)q 2 2 +M\u220612q1q2,\n(66) where qi is the displacement of the mode i (i = 1, 2), Mi is its effective mass, \u03c9i is its eigenfrequency, and M\u220612 characterizes the coupling strength.

This anticrossing is similar to the anticrossing of energy levels of a quantum system driven through resonance, even though the considered system is purely classical.\nFaust et al.

The two-mode system is first prepared by detuning the mode eigenfrequencies by a large amount compared to the coupling. Energy is injected in mode 1, point I in Fig. 23(a). The system is then swept with the gate voltage to the final state where the modes are again practically independent from each other, points A and D. As the modes go through resonance, the energy initially injected in mode 1 gets distributed between the two modes. The distribution depends on the ramp time of the gate voltage (Fig. 23 (b)).\nAn important problem in the Landau-Zener tunneling is the effect of dissipation and noise on the transition, cf. [504\u2013506] and references therein. The results by Faust et al. [503] suggest that nanomechanical modes can be used to study these effect in a well-controlled experimental setting.\nIn other experiments with nanomechanical modes, the response of coupled modes to pulses of resonant drive were studied [507, 508]. The results allowed emulating Rabi oscillations in a classical system.\nThe reason of the similarity of the classical dynamics of nanomechanical modes and the quantum dynamics of a two-level system is that the interference of linear modes has much in common with the interference of wave functions. We emphasize, however, that nanoresonators and quantum two-state systems, for example, qubits, are entirely different by nature as seen from the dimensions of their Hilbert spaces, in particular. Coupled classical linear modes may not be used as qubits, since it is the strong nonlinearity of qubits that underlies their application in quantum computing.\nNanomechanical resonators with a symmetric crosssection, like cylindrical wires, have degenerate flexural eigenmodes, which are orthogonal. Such modes are highly sensitive to perturbations that cause symmetry lifting. Consider a resonator with degenerate modes polarized in perpendicular directions r\u03021 and r\u03022. We now place the resonator in an inhomogeneous force field with components Fi (i = 1, 2). The partial derivatives of the force components \u2202Fi/\u2202ri shift the resonance frequencies of the eigenmodes. In contrast, the cross-derivatives \u2202Fi/\u2202rj with i 6= j couple the eigenmodes. As a result, the new eigenmodes have different frequencies and are\n41\npolarized in different directions. Such eigenmode rotation has been directly measured [77, 183, 184].\nThe force that drives a nanowire can be non-potential, \u2202F1/\u2202r2 6= \u2202F2/\u2202r1. Such a force can come if a laserdriven nanowire is placed away from the waist of a focused laser beam. Then the eigenmodes are no longer pointing in orthogonal directions. It has been experimentally shown that the angle between them can be reduced down to zero [509]. The power spectra of the modes were found to deviate from the conventional Lorentzian form.\nExamples of other effects of resonant coupling of a few NVS modes include generation of circularly polarized mechanical oscillations using modes polarized in perpendicular directions [510, 511] and resonant coupling of an optomechanical resonator and a single bacterium [512]. A significant and important group of resonant-coupling effects concerns one- and two-dimensional arrays of resonators; in such arrays many modes are brought in resonance at a time. Arrays of NVSs can display various types of topological effects [513\u2013517] as well as dynamical phase transitions and symmetry breaking effects [502, 518, 519], among others, and can be used as tunable phononic waveguides [520, 521]."

            "heading": "B. Nonlinear resonant coupling",
            "text": "The study of nonlinear resonance has been attracting much attention and has a long history in quantum and classical mechanics, which goes back at least to Laplace and Poincare\u0301 on the classical side and to the Fermi resonance on the quantum side [350, 522]. For two modes, nonlinear resonant mode coupling occurs where the ratio of their eigenfrequencies \u03c92/\u03c91 is close to a rational number n/m. In nonlinear resonance, modes can exchange energy with each other, similar to linear resonance. The coupling that leads to this exchange comes from the modes nonlinearity and therefore is unavoidable. Generally it falls off with the increasing order of the resonance, i.e., for two modes, with the increasing n and m in the ratio n/m. Classically, multiple nonlinear resonances pave the road to chaos in conservative systems, a profound understanding that emerged in the 20th century.\nA system of coupled nanomechanical modes provides a playground for studying nonlinear resonant effects. One can study them in a well-controlled setting in the regimes of strong to weak dissipation and explore a broad range of phenomena, from the aforementioned resonant energy exchange to various types of dynamical bifurcations, different scenarios of the onset of dynamical chaos, and resonant nonlinear friction to mention but a few.\nFor a two-mode system with the resonant condition n\u03c91 \u2248 m\u03c92, the simplest term in the potential energy that directly accounts for the resonant energy exchange in nonlinear resonance has the form\nU resnl = M\u2206 (nm) 12 q n 1 q m 2 (67)\nwhere \u2206 (nm) 12 is the coupling parameter. The importance of the coupling U resnl is clear from the following argument. If q1 and q2 oscillate at frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92, respectively, U resnl contains a non-oscillating part. This is the \u201cnormal form\u201d term [523]: it is of the lowest order in nonlinearity that has a non-oscillating part, drawing the similarity with the harmonic part of the Hamiltonian, which is independent of time.\nThe effect of the coupling (67) on the energy exchange between the modes is easy to understand in quantum terms. We write the displacement operator of an ith mode (i = 1, 2) in Eq. (67) as qi = (~/2M\u03c9i)1/2(ai+a\u2020i ), where a\u2020i and ai are the raising and lowering operators. Therefore U resnl contains terms (a \u2020 1) nam2 + (a \u2020 2) man1 . They describe processes in which mode 1 goes up by n energy levels while mode 2 goes down by m levels, or vice versa, mode 1 goes down by n energy levels while mode 2 goes up by m levels. For exact nonlinear resonance, in such processes the modes exchange energy ~n\u03c91 = ~m\u03c92, but the total energy of the modes is not changed. This is illustrated in Fig. 24 for n = 3 and m = 1. If one of the modes is excited, the energy exchange happens periodically in time, as in the case of linear resonance. The energy exchange frequency is \u221d |\u2206(nm)12 | and depends on the mode amplitudes [in fact, one has to take into account that, because of the mode nonlinearity, the frequencies \u03c9i depend on the mode amplitudes Ai, and a more accurate form of the resonance condition is n\u03c91(A1) = m\u03c92(A2)]. In quantum terms, the resonating energy levels are split, with the splitting ~\u03b4\u03c9nl that depends on the level numbers.\nThe onset of resonant nonlinear effects does not require an exact resonance. It suffices for the frequency detuning |n\u03c91\u2212m\u03c92| to be smaller or on the order of the sum of the decay rates of the modes or the properly scaled maximal energy-exchange frequency. We note also that the symmetry of the modes may impose restrictions on the coupling: for example, in a uniform straight nanobeam the fundamental flexural mode is not coupled to odd powers of the first excited flexural mode. Selection rules apply also to other types of modes, and therefore in a number of cases special design was implemented to observe particular types of nonlinear resonance [524].\nAn important asset for studying various aspects of nonlinear resonant effects with the NVSs is their tunability. The modes can be tuned in and out of resonance by sweeping their eigenfrequencies with the voltage applied to the gate electrode [366] or by dynamically shifting the frequency of one of the modes by driving it into the nonlinear Duffing regime, where the vibration frequency depends on the vibration amplitude, cf. Eq. (48), see [94, 380, 383, 524\u2013531] and references therein. The latter dependence also leads to the possibility of going through resonance during decay of the mode amplitude after the mode was initially excited.\nIn nanomechanical systems the nonlinear mode coupling is comparatively weak. It becomes stronger with\n42\nthe increasing mode amplitude, as seen from Eq. (67). Therefore almost all observations in the classical domain refer to the case where one of the resonating vibrational modes is sufficiently strongly driven or is allowed to decay after being sufficiently strongly excited.\nThe amplitude dependence of both the mode frequencies and the effective coupling strength makes the nonlinear resonance dynamics much richer than in the case of linear resonance. Several types of ensuing behaviors have been seen in micro- and nanomechanical systems. Most observations refer to the cases where a low-frequency mode was driven close to resonance with a high-frequency mode with the frequency ratio 2 : 1 or 3 : 1.\nFor a micromechanical system that displays a 3 : 1 resonance, it was found [380] that, for the low-frequency mode, the Duffing response curve shown in Fig. 15 (a) changes due to the nonlinear resonance. As seen in Fig. 25 (a), starting with a sufficiently strong driving amplitude, the frequency at which the mode switches from the large- to the small-amplitude branch becomes independent of the drive amplitude. This frequency is determined by the coupling to a mode with a three-times higher frequency. Such coupling opens a new channel of energy relaxation, limiting the increase of the amplitude. On a similar device it was found [382] that, in the comparatively strong drive regime the system may display very slow and strongly nonsinusoidal vibrations, producing a frequency comb with the spectral line spacing smaller than the mode eigenfrequency by a factor approaching 105 and spanning a bandwidth larger then the mode decay rate by a factor \u223c 102, see Fig. 25 (e). This effect was related to a special type of the saddlenode bifurcation (cf. Appendix D 1 a), which in this case occurs on an invariant circle [531]. When the system is near such a bifurcation point, its trajectory in the rotating frame is burst-type.\nIn a nanomechanical resonator studied by Gu\u0308ttinger et al. [90] it was possible to tune the modes into a 3 : 1 res-\nonance not only by varying the parameters of the drive, but also by changing the eigenfrequencies by a gate voltage. It was observed that, when the low-frequency mode was driven sufficiently strongly, the dependence of its amplitude on the drive frequency displayed a plateau-like region, see Fig. 25 (b). Numerical simulations suggest that in this region the dynamics in the rotating frame becomes chaotic. The simulations took into account the nonlinear resonant coupling of the form (67) and successfully described switching between different vibrational branches of the coupled driven nonlinear modes. Limit cycles and period doubling for 3 : 1 resonance in a MEMS resonator were observed by Houri et al. [383].\nThe results [90, 526] also revealed a strongly nonexponential decay of the resonating modes after the lowfrequency mode was excited to a large amplitude and the driving was switched off. This can be understood since, during decay, the modes exchange energy not only with the thermal reservoir, but also with each other. Such exchange is efficient while the modes are in resonance and the effective coupling strength is larger than the decay rates. This leads to a peculiar form of the time dependence of the amplitude shown in Fig. 25 (c), which was in good agreement with the simulations [90].\nAnalytically, the time dependence of the mode amplitude has been described in two limiting cases. In the first case, the high-frequency mode has a large decay rate compared to the decay rate of the low-frequency mode and the appropriately scaled coupling, whereas in the second case the decay rates of the both modes are small on the coupling scale [532]. In the first case, the high-frequency mode serves as a thermal reservoir that is switched on and off as the amplitude of the low-frequency mode changes, a direct analog of the nonlinear friction discussed in Sec. VI B, cf. Fig. 11. In the second case, on the other hand, the mode decay is accompanied by strong amplitude oscillations. Interestingly, such oscillations are followed by a steep drop when the system goes through a saddle point of the conservative motion and comes out of resonance, as seen in Fig. 25 (d). In both limiting cases, for small amplitudes, where the modes are away from the resonance, the decay becomes exponential.\nBesides nonlinear resonance of two modes, nano- and micromechanical systems allow studying multiple-mode resonance [369, 529]. [369] observed in a nanomechanical system a resonance of 3 modes, in which \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2248 \u03c93 and \u03c91 \u03c92,3. The relevant resonant nonlinear coupling in this case has the form U resnl = M\u2206123q1q2q3. The resonance was achieved by tuning mode 1 with a piezoelectric transducer. It was shown that resonant driving of the high-frequency mode leads to excitation of coherent self-sustained vibrations of the modes 1 and 2, the effect called phonon lasing. A multiple-mode resonance was also studied in a cascade of beams with the frequencies of the successive beams decreasing by a factor of two [533]. In this system there was demonstrated the energy transfer to a mode with frequency smaller by a factor of 4 than the excitation frequency.\n43"

            "heading": "C. Parametrically-induced resonant coupling",
            "text": "It is a remarkable feature of mechanical resonators that it is possible to resonantly couple two vibrational modes using a parametric drive without any restriction on the ratio of their resonance frequencies \u03c92/\u03c91. A simple way to achieve such coupling is based on driving a resonator at the frequency \u03c9p equal to either the sum or the difference of the mode eigenfrequencies, \u03c91 + \u03c92 or |\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92|, so that the drive resonantly modulates the coupling strength \u2206pump12 (t) in the potential energy\nUpump12 = M\u2206 pump 12 (t)q1q2. (68)\nThe parametric drive is often implemented by modulating the stress in the resonator by an electrostatic or a piezoelectric force. The coupling (68) may result also from driving one of the modes at the combination frequency |\u03c91\u00b1\u03c92| in the presence of nonlinear mode-mode coupling [378, 534]. The effect of the coupling (68) is similar to what happens in optomechanical systems [7] where the parametric coupling is used to cool and heat mechanical vibrations, realize optomechanically-induced transparency in photon cavities, and hybridize mechani-\ncal vibrations with the optical field.\nIf the drive frequency is \u03c9p = |\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92|, the driving leads to energy exchange between the modes. A simple way to understand this is suggested by Fig. 26(a) if one thinks of the driving as an electromagnetic field. In these terms, the interaction (68) describes a process in which a photon with energy ~\u03c9p and a quantum of the lowerfrequency mode [mode 1 in Fig. 26(a)] are annihilated and a quantum of the higher-frequency mode is created, or vice versa, a quantum of a higher-frequency mode decays into a photon and a quantum of the lower-frequency mode. For \u03c91 < \u03c92 the energy conservation condition is ~\u03c9p + ~\u03c91 = ~\u03c92.\nAlternatively, if one notices that the modes coordinates q1 and q2 oscillate at frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92, respectively, whereas \u2206pump12 (t) oscillates at frequency \u03c9p = |\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92|, in Upump12 there is a term that is independent of time. In the rotating wave approximation it has the same form as the static linear resonant mode-mode coupling discussed in Sec. VIII A. In terms of the modes ladder operators the coupling energy is \u221d a\u20201a2 + a\u20202a1. Therefore the energy exchange is similar to what was considered in Sec. VIII A.\nAn important feature of the drive at |\u03c91\u2212\u03c92| is that it\n44\nmakes it possible to cool down the low-frequency mode [mode 1 in Fig. 26(a)] given that its relaxation rate is smaller than the relaxation rate of the high-frequency mode [534]. The driving \u201cextracts\u201d the energy from the low-frequency mode and \u201cdumps\u201d it into the highfrequency mode which then quickly further dumps it into the thermal reservoir coupled to this mode. Thus the high-frequency mode in this case serves as an effective thermal reservoir for the low-frequency mode.\nIf the relaxation rate of the low-frequency mode is dominated by the energy exchange with the high-frequency mode, in the stationary state the populations of the excited states of the modes should be equal. The occupation of the first excited energy level of the high-frequency mode (mode 2) is \u221d exp(\u2212~\u03c92/kBT ). The above argument suggests that the occupation of the first excited state of the low-frequency mode (mode 1) should be \u221d exp(\u2212~\u03c91/kBTeff) with Teff = T\u03c91/\u03c92. This means that the effective temperature of mode 1 is significantly lower than T . Surprisingly, the whole distribution over the excited states of mode 1 is of the Boltzmann form with temperature Teff in the absence of nonlinear friction [534]. In the opposite case where the relaxation rate of mode 1 is much higher than that of mode 2, the effective temperature of mode 2 becomes T\u03c92/\u03c91, i.e., there occurs mode heating, see Appendix C.\nMode cooling in coupled mechanical modes has been experimentally demonstrated by De Alba et al. [381] and Mahboob et al. [535]. The cooling is modest compared to what is achieved with optomechanical devices [142, 232, 233], where the ratio of the mode frequencies can be much larger.\nA profound effect of the driving-induced resonant coupling is seen in the response to a weak probe drive. This response displays Fano resonance. For a not too strong driving-induced coupling and for the driving frequency \u03c9p \u2248 |\u03c92\u2212\u03c91|, the amplitude of the response of a fasterdecaying mode [mode 2 in Fig. 26(c)] to a probe field displays a narrow dip at frequency \u2248 \u03c9p+\u03c91. The dip results from the interference of the direct resonant response of mode 2 and of the response of mode 1 \u201cuplifted\u201d by the drive (68) to the frequency \u03c9p + \u03c91 \u2248 \u03c92. This is an analog of the optomechanically-induced transparency in photon cavities [536\u2013538].\nFor a stronger driving \u2206pump12 (t), Eq. (68), where the rate of the driving-induced energy exchange between the modes becomes larger than their relaxation rates, the behavior of the modes is reminiscent of that at the mode anticrossing discussed in Sec. VIII A. The resonance now is between \u03c92 and \u03c91 + \u03c9p. As mentioned above, the coupling Hamiltonians have the same form in the rotating wave approximation. The modes are strongly hybridized in this regime.\nExperimentally, the Fano resonance and the mode hybridization in micro/nanomechanics were first demonstrated in GaAs-based semiconductor resonators [508, 535]. In the response of the mode to a weak probe field shown in Fig. 26(c), the dip associated with the Fano\nresonance becomes more prominent with the increasing drive \u2206pump12 (t). The response for the largest drive is nearly split in two peaks, the analog of anticrossing in Fig. 23(a), indicating a significant mode hybridization. It is comparatively simpler to reach this hybridization regime \u2013 also called the strong coupling regime \u2013 in resonators based on nanoscale materials, such as graphene and nanotubes, because the stress can be modulated by a larger amount [373, 381, 539\u2013542].\nParametric drive at frequency \u03c9p \u2248 \u03c91 + \u03c92 leads to heating of the Brownian motion of both modes 1 and 2. In the rotating wave approximation, in terms of the modes ladder operators the coupling energy is \u221d a\u20201a\u20202 + a1a2. The effect of the parametric drive can be thought of as a decay of a drive photon with creation of a quantum of mode 1 and a quantum of mode 2, cf. Fig. 26 (b). Such excitation corresponds to \u201cnegative damping\u201d and is associated with a decrease of the dissipation rates of the modes. If in the absence of the driving one mode is decaying much faster than the other, the ef-\n45\nfect is described by the decrease of the linear friction coefficient and the increase of the effective temperature of the slower-decaying mode. When the dissipation rate is positive, this mode (mode 1, for concreteness) can amplify an externally applied weak drive at frequency \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c91. When its dissipation rate goes through zero, the mode switches to the regime of self-sustained vibrations [534].\nAmplification of a weak radiation by a nanomechanical mode coupled to an optical cavity mode was observed by Massel et al. [543]. For coupled micromechanical modes, both the resonant parametric heating and the onset of oscillations have been observed by Mahboob et al. [544]. In the parametric heating regime, a correlation in the displacement noise of the two modes was measured and a two-mode squeezing was found, see Fig. 26(d).\nAn interesting regime arises where both modes are pumped into the regime of self-sustained vibrations [378]. The measurements show that the phase fluctuations of the two modes feature near-perfect anti-correlation, so that the sum of the phases \u03c61(t) + \u03c62(t) remains nearly constant. Such anti-correlation is a consequence of the discrete time-translation symmetry imposed by the periodic drive. This regime has not been accessed with the optomechanical systems fabricated thus far, since the dissipation rate of the optical cavity could not be driven to zero.\nParametric drive of the mode coupling can be also used to generate nonlinear friction in a controlled way. Pumping at \u03c92 \u2212 2\u03c91 leads to positive nonlinear friction of mode 1, if the damping rate of mode 2 is large enough so that any additional energy arriving from mode 1 is rapidly transferred to the environment. This results in a relaxation process where two quanta of mode 1 are simultaneously extracted and transferred to mode 2 along with a drive photon, in contrast to the discussed earlier linear friction that involves a transfer of one quantum of mode 1. Energy decay measurements of this nonlinear friction show that the vibrational amplitude decreases fastest at high amplitude (red data in Fig. 27) [379]. Pumping at \u03c92 + 2\u03c91 generates negative nonlinear friction, where the measured decay is slowest at high amplitude (blue data in Fig. 27). Ultimately such negative nonlinear friction leads to the possibility of self-sustained vibrations in the system of coupled modes."

            "heading": "IX. FREQUENCY FLUCTUATIONS",
            "text": "Frequency fluctuations are one of the least understood chapters of the dynamics of nanomechanical systems. In a way, even the word \u201cfrequency\u201d has been used somewhat ambivalently. Strictly speaking, the angular frequency is equal to 2\u03c0 divided by the vibration period. It is thus associated with a discrete time interval. However, in classical vibrational systems there is also considered an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d frequency that continuously depends on time and is given by the derivative of the vibration phase \u03d5(t) over time. For perfect sinusoidal\nvibrations the two definitions of the frequency coincide, but in the presence of fluctuations they generally differ. Frequency fluctuations in NVSs have attracted much attention, as they often impose a limit on mass sensitivity [4, 194, 496, 545, 546] and other applications in sensing, like force and force gradient measurements [547, 548]; they are also a major limiting factor in the application of micromechanical systems as clocks, gyroscopes, and other devices [218, 549, 550].\nFor an isolated linear mode, the displacement can be written as\nq(t) = A cos\u03d5(t), \u03d5(t) = \u03c90t+ \u03c6.\nHere \u03c90 is the mode eigenfrequency, i.e., a parameter of the system, whereas \u03c6 as well as the amplitude A are determined by the initial conditions. Coupling of the mode to the environment causes fluctuations of both \u03c6 and \u03c90, as well as amplitude fluctuations, making all these parameters time-dependent. The fluctuations of \u03c6 and \u03c90, which are of primary interest for this section, come from physically different sources and are called, respectively, phase and eigenfrequency fluctuations. Both of them contribute to fluctuations of the full vibrational phase, which can be now written as\n\u03d5(t) = \u02c6 t 0 \u03c90(t \u2032)dt\u2032 + \u03c6(t). (69)\nThe time-dependent phase \u03c6(t) is also often called the phase in the rotating frame. In high-Q systems, of relevance are fluctuations of \u03c6 and \u03c90 that are slow on the time scale \u03c9\u221210 .\nFluctuations of \u03c6(t) have been studied very broadly, initially in various systems of self-sustained vibrations. These studies can be traced back to 1930-1950s [551\u2013 553]; they were later carried out for lasers, see [554, 555] and references therein, and for time metrology [556, 557]. A major feature of self-sustained vibrations is that the\n46\nphase \u03c6 is arbitrary unless the vibrations are synchronized by an external source. Therefore phase fluctuations can accumulate in time. Generally, this leads to phase diffusion on a long time scale independent of the nature of the vibrational system.\nIn micro- and nanomechanical systems, an unavoidable source of phase fluctuations is the thermal (thermomechanical) noise. It comes along with friction from the coupling to a thermal reservoir and is described by the force fT (t) in Eq. (2) [8, 558]. It sets the so-called noise floor and thus imposes a fundamental limit on the precision with which the full phase \u03d5(t) and thus the frequency \u03d5\u0307(t) can be determined, cf. Fig. 28.\nA different source of fluctuations of the overall phase \u03d5(t) is fluctuations of the vibration eigenfrequency. A simple mechanism of such fluctuations is random attachment and detachment of molecules and the associated change of the mass and thus the eigenfrequency of a nanoresonator [187, 189, 201, 558, 559].\nUnderstanding frequency fluctuations requires separating the fluctuations of the eigenfrequency and of the slow part \u03c6 of the phase and characterizing both the spectra and the statistics of these fluctuations. In turn, such characterization provides a means for identifying the fluctuation sources. We will concentrate primarily on \u201copenloop\u201d measurements done to this end. Such measurements are performed with no feedback loop. They are therefore free from the effect of the noise that comes from the feedback. In studying nano- and micromechanical systems, there are also often employed feedbackbased methods, including those utilizing self-sustained vibrations [220] as well as the phase-locked loop method [190, 191, 546, 560], see [8] and [561] and references therein.\nWe note that, in quantum terms, frequency fluctuations are usually associated with decoherence. A familiar source of decoherence in quantum systems is fluctuations of the level spacing, i.e., of the transition frequency, which corresponds to the eigenfrequency in the above picture. The thermomechanical noise described by Eq. (2)\ndoes not lead to fluctuations of the level spacing of a quantum oscillator in the absence of nonlinearity. In this sense, there is a significant difference between the quantum and classical pictures of frequency fluctuations. The pictures can be reconciled, though, by realizing that, because of dissipation, for a nonzero temperature a quantum oscillator makes transitions between its energy levels. The transitions happen at random, and this is a quantum analog of the effect of thermal noise. The power spectra of quantum and classical linear oscillators have the same shape, see Sec. IV C."

            "heading": "A. Allan variance",
            "text": "The most broadly used method of characterizing frequency fluctuations is based on measuring the Allan variance. To find it, following the original approach [556], one has to measure the average frequency f\u0304(\u03c4) over time \u03c4 and to compare the values of this frequency obtained as the system evolves. Specifically, an mth value of the average frequency f\u0304m \u2261 f\u0304m(\u03c4) is determined by the increment of the overall vibration phase \u03d5 over the time from tm to tm + \u03c4 , and then f\u0304m = [\u03d5(tm + \u03c4)\u2212\u03d5(tm)]/2\u03c0\u03c4 . If f0 = \u03c90/2\u03c0 is the mean value of f\u0304m, the Allan variance found from N measurements is defined as\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = 1\n2(N \u2212 1)f20 N\u22121\u2211 m=1 (f\u0304m+1 \u2212 f\u0304m)2.

The Allan variance as defined by Eq. (70) does not distinguish between fluctuations of the eigenfrequency and the rotating-frame phase \u03c6. Also, it does not provide information about the statistics of the fluctuations.\nFigure 29 shows the measurements of the Allan deviation \u03c3A in a single-crystal Si nanoresonator based on the described approach [562]. The studied nanoresonators had Q in the range (5\u00f77)\u00d7103 and the experiments were done at room temperature. It is seen that the experimentally observed noise can be several orders of magnitude higher than the one expected from thermal fluctuations of the phase \u03c6 and described by equation\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = (2\u0393kBT/\u03c9 4 0A\n2)\u03c4\u22121, (71)\ncf. Eq. (H3). A significantly larger Allan deviation than what would be expected from thermal noise has been reported essentially for all nanomechanical systems studied thus far. These observations suggest that a major contribution to \u03c3A comes from other noise sources. Of particular importance in this respect are fluctuations of the mode eigenfrequency.\n47"

            "text": "Several mechanisms of eigenfrequency fluctuations of nanoresonators have been discussed in the literature. Besides the fluctuations due to the mode nonlinearity and nonlinear mode coupling discussed in Sec. VI C 1 they include the aforementioned noise due to random attachment and detachment of molecules, molecule diffusion along the resonator [201, 211, 563], tension fluctuations due to temperature fluctuations, defect motion, transitions between the states of two-level systems within a material or on the surface [29, 294, 457], and local charge fluctuations [213, 372, 564, 565].\nDifferent fluctuation mechanisms lead to eigenfrequency fluctuations with different time scales, i.e., with different correlation times tc. The fluctuation statistics is also different. Often several fluctuation mechanisms with different tc and different statistics jointly affect the mode dynamics.\nThe presence of eigenfrequency fluctuations can be revealed by comparing the power spectrum of a mode or the spectrum of its response to a resonant drive with the results of a ringdown measurement where there is studied the decay of initially excited vibrations. In the absence of nonlinear friction the decay is exponential in time with the decrement given by the friction coefficient \u0393, as seen from Eq. (21). If there are no eigenfrequency fluctuations, \u0393 is also the halfwidth of the power spectrum S(\u03c9), cf. Eq. (5). However, often the shape of the spectrum deviates from the Lorentzian and the halfwidth \u2206\u03c9 exceeds \u0393 even where the vibrations are linear [29, 32, 566]. This is a consequence of eigenfrequency fluctuations.\nAn advantageous approach to separating and characterizing eigenfrequency fluctuations is based on studying the mode dynamics in the presence of a close to resonance drive [414, 457, 567\u2013571]. The drive breaks the time translation symmetry of the system, cf. Sec. VII C. As a result, fluctuations of the in-phase and quadrature vibration components become different, which leads to several observable consequences.\nOne of these consequences is pronounced in the correlators \u3008u(t1)...u(tn)\u3009 of the complex amplitude of the driven mode\nu(t) = (2M\u03c9F ) \u22121[M\u03c9F q(t)\u2212 ip(t)] exp(\u2212i\u03c9F t),\nwhere \u03c9F is the drive frequency, cf. Eq. (H4). These correlators are nonzero only because of the broken timetranslation symmetry, and it follows from the timesymmetry arguments that, for a linear mode, they do not depend on thermal noise and the corresponding phase fluctuations. However, they explicitly depend on fluctuations \u03b4\u03c90(t) of the eigenfrequency. Studying these correlators provides a direct way to characterize the spectrum and statistics of the eigenfrequency fluctuations and enables measuring the correlators \u3008\u03b4\u03c90(t1)...\u03b4\u03c90(tn)\u3009 [567]. The ratio \u3008u2\u3009/\u3008u\u30092 was used by Gavartin et al. [568] to characterize eigenfrequency fluctuations in a nanomechnical beam; it was also shown in this paper that the fluctuations can be suppressed with a feedback using a second mechanical mode as a frequency noise detector. The experiment on a micromechanical resonator in which the eigenfrequency was modulated by a telegraph noise [570] demonstrated the possibility to reveal the noise statistics by measuring the moments \u3008un\u3009.\nThe role of eigenfrequency fluctuations is clearly seen from Fig. 30, which shows fluctuations of the quadrature and in-phase components of a driven high-Q nanomechanical resonator [457]. Whereas the fluctuational spread of the quadrature component is essentially independent of the amplitude of forced vibrations A, the\n48\nspread of the in-phase component increases with the increasing amplitude. The observed spread of the vibration phase counted off from \u03c9F t (\u03c9F is the drive frequency), \u03d5(t) \u2212 \u03c9F t, is practically independent of A for low temperatures. For the thermomechanical noise, on the other hand it would fall off with the increasing A, \u03c32A \u221d A\u22122, cf. Eq. (71) and Appendix H. The observed phase spread is a direct consequence of the fluctuations of \u03c90, with the phase deviation\n\u03b4\u03c6(t) \u2248 \u02c6 t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 exp[\u2212\u0393(t\u2212 t\u2032)]\u03b4\u03c90(t\u2032)\nfor a weak eigenfrequency noise. The data allowed [457] to study the low-frequency part of the spectrum of the fluctuations \u03b4\u03c90(t). It was found to be of the 1/f type and was related to reorienting two-state elastic dipoles.\nThe power spectrum of the eigenfrequency fluctuations in a broad frequency range can be extracted directly from the power spectrum of a driven mode S(\u03c9) [414, 569]. For a linear mode this can be qualitatively explained as follows. With no noise, a resonant force F cos\u03c9F t leads to the mode displacement\nq(t) = F\n2M\u03c9F Re i exp(\u2212i\u03c9F t) \u0393\u2212 i(\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90) , (72)\ncf. Sec. VII A. If in this expression \u03c90 is fluctuating, that is, if \u03c90 is formally replaced by \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90(t), the displacement q(t) is also fluctuating. This should lead to an extra peak in the power spectrum of the mode. The form of this peak strongly depends on the interrelation between the correlation time tc of the fluctuations \u03b4\u03c90(t) and the relaxation time of the mode \u0393\u22121. Since the power spectrum is quadratic in q(t), it is clear from Eq. (72) that the peak is proportional to F 2, which allows one to identify it and separate it from other spectral features.\nThe replacement of \u03c90 with \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c90(t) in Eq. (72) is applicable if the correlation time of the eigenfrequency fluctuations tc is large compared to the mode relaxation time \u0393\u22121, so that the mode adiabatically follows these fluctuations. The fluctuation-induced slow time variation of the amplitude and phase of the forced vibrations at frequency \u03c9F lead to a narrow spectral peak, which is centered at \u03c9F . The width of this peak is \u223c t\u22121c . For small |\u03b4\u03c90(t)| the peak is proportional to the power spectral density S\u03b4\u03c90(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9F ) of \u03b4\u03c90(t). Therefore the shape of the peak allows reading off this spectral density directly. In the experiment on a carbon nanotube resonator [569] carried out at T = 1.2 K it was found that the spectral density of the eigenfrequency fluctuations is S\u03b4\u03c90(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u2212\u03b1 for small \u03c9, with \u03b1 \u2248 0.5. A similar measurement was done for a silicon nanobeam, where such 1/f -type scaling was also observed, with the exponent \u03b1 \u2248 0.7 [378].\nSlow eigenfrequency fluctuations determine the longterm stability of devices based on nano- and microresonators, including clocks. However, they don\u2019t lead to a broadening of the spectral response in the absence of the\ndrive if the response is measured over time small compared to tc. The position of the spectral peak shifts from measurement to measurement in this case. If the duration of a measurement is & tc and \u3008\u03b4\u03c920\u3009 & \u03932, the spectrum is broadened. This is an analog of the inhomogeneous spectral broadening. The effect was observed for a nanotube resonator [31] and for a breathing mode in a phononic crystal [29].\nThe opposite limit of comparatively fast eigenfrequency fluctuations, tc \u0393\u22121, is not directly described by Eq. (72). A qualitative picture is somewhat more involved [569], but roughly, one can think that the major spectral effect of the drive in this case comes from the effective heating of the mode, with \u03b4T \u221d F 2.\nFast fluctuations \u03b4\u03c90(t) lead to broadening of the power spectrum of a mode S(\u03c9) in the absence of driving. The power spectrum and the mode susceptibility have a Lorentzian shape with a halfwidth \u2206\u03c9, which is a sum of \u0393 and the characteristic intensity of the eigenfrequency fluctuations. This feature holds independent of the statistics of the fluctuations provided \u2206\u03c9 \u03c90. It has been often used to describe experiments, cf. Eq. (10).\nStudying the spectrum in the presence of driving allows one to separate the contribution of fast frequency fluctuations. The corresponding driving-induced part of\n49\nthe spectrum SF (\u03c9) can be written as\nSF (\u03c9) \u2248 CFF 2 (\u2206\u03c9 \u2212 \u0393)/\u0393 (\u2206\u03c92 + (\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)2 S(\u03c9) kBT (73)\nhere strictly speaking, \u03c90 is also renormalized by the frequency fluctuations if they are non-Gaussian; [the explicit form of CF depends on the statistics of the fluctuations \u03b4\u03c90(t) [569]]. The spectrum SF (\u03c9) has the same shape S(\u03c9) as in the absence of driving, but is proportional to the squared driving amplitude. It is also proportional to the difference between the fluctuation- and decay-induced broadening \u2206\u03c9 \u2212 \u0393.\nIn Fig. 31 we show the results of two experiments [569, 571], which demonstrate how the interplay of the driving and the eigenfrequency fluctuations affects the power spectrum. Even though the studied systems were very different, the observations clearly show the occurrence of a very narrow peak centered at the drive frequency and a broad spectrum with the shape similar to that in the absence of the driving. Comparing the areas of the peaks with and without driving allowed estimating the contribution of the fast eigenfrequency fluctuations to the observed spectral broadening \u2206\u03c9. In both experiments it was & 50%."

            "text": "The goal of writing this review was to demonstrate the nontrivial physics of nanomechanical systems and the possibility to use them as a platform for studying a broad range of nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena in a controlled setting, and also to indicate their numerous applications. These intertwined aspects of nanomechanics make it a fairly unique interdisciplinary area of research and underlie the growing interest in the NVSs. The interest is further stimulated by the rapid progress in nanotechnology, which allows improving the existing types of the NVSs and making qualitatively new NVSs. In closing the review, we present some of the nascent directions of the research in the field. Unavoidably, such a list is incomplete, particularly given the high rate at which new results are obtained.\nAn important aspect of the mesoscopic dynamics of the NVSs are coherent effects. Among them, of much current interest are the effects of coupling nanomechanical modes to qubits [152, 572], see also Sec. VI C 2, as well as using qubits to entangle different mesoscopic modes [165]. Related is a significant effort on developing nanomechanical resonators with high-Q microwave-frequency modes [29, 165]. Such modes can be brought to the ground quantum state already for temperatures . 0.1 K without sideband or active feedback cooling (that reduces the Q-factor) and can be in resonance with superconducting qubits [573]. An important type of these modes are vibrations localized around engineered defects in phononic crystals with frequencies in the gap of the spectrum of propagating modes.\nA promising direction in the context of quantum information and coherent effects in nanomechanics is developing qubits based on the NVSs. This requires vibration nonlinearity that remains large compared to the decay rate down to the quantum regime. Then resonant driving at the frequency of the transition from the ground to the first excited vibrational state does not lead to transitions to higher-energy states, similar to superconducting qubits. The corresponding nonlinearity can be achieved by coupling mechanical vibrations to the charge states of a double quantum dot. For a qubit based on a carbon nanotube resonator, the coherence time is predicted to be remarkably long [574]. A very strong nonlinearity can be achieved also near a bifurcation point where a nanotube or a nanomembrane is close to collapse due to the strong gate voltage and can tunnel into the collapsed state [575].\nTopological effects form another group of coherent phenomena that attract current attention. A possibility to observe such effects in phononic crystals in an optomechanical setting was indicated by Peano et al. [513], and thermal phonons traveling along a topological edge channel with weak backscattering have been observed in an array of over 800 submicron silicon membranes [515]. A two-dimensional metamaterial made out of submicron SiN membranes, which has time-reversal symmetry, has been demonstrated to have pseudospin-type edge states, which are robust to waveguide distortion [514]. The possibility to control the phononic band structure electrostatically makes nanoresonator-based metamaterials interesting even where they are topologically trivial. Such control can be used for dynamical tuning of acoustic transparency and waveform engineering in phononic waveguides [520, 576, 577].\nYet another group of coherent effects is related to the dynamics of NVSs in a driving field with frequency \u03c9F close to an overtone of the mode eigenfrequency, \u03c9F \u2248 n\u03c90. Such drive can resonantly excite vibrational states at frequency \u03c9F /n with n > 1. The case n = 2 corresponds to the parametric excitation discussed for a single mode in Sec. VII B. For coupled NVSs, the interaction between driven modes may lead to formation of time crystals where the discrete time-translation symmetry imposed by the periodic drive is broken, i.e., phasematched vibrations occur at frequency \u03c9F /n \u2248 \u03c90 [502]. The properties of such dissipation-free Floquet time crystals are strongly affected by the nontrivial geometric phase [578] that emerges for n \u2265 3 [579, 580]. The resonant-driving induced time crystals are expected to have an exponentially long time before they are heated up and ultimately melted by the drive.\nThe \u201cincoherent\u201d side of the dynamics of coupled NVSs, i.e., the dynamics in the presence of relaxation and thermal fluctuations, is closely connected to the \u201ccoherent\u201d side. Arrays of dissipative resonantly driven NVSs can display time-crystalline behavior [502, 519], which in this case can have features related to breaking of the detailed balance. Such arrays should enable, in particular, studying the effects of disorder in the eigenfrequen-\n50\ncies and the coupling on the quantum and classical timesymmetry breaking transitions. Coupled NVSs can also display topological solitons [516, 517]. Topologically nontrivial dissipative networks with interesting dynamics can be created also by driving coupled resonators by radiation modulated at the difference of their frequencies [581]. Challenging observations of broken-symmetry states with complex dynamics have been reported for networks of NVSs that display self-sustained vibrations [518]. Overall, the dynamics of coupled NVSs, which has been attracting attention for a long time [5, 59, 374, 582, 583], is significantly enriched by the topological and Floquet aspects.\nNVSs are playing an increasingly important role in studying condensed-matter systems. One of the pursued directions is establishing microscopic mechanisms of energy relaxation of vibrational modes. A significant effort has been put recently into identifying the LandauRumer and Akhiezer relaxation, with the experiments covering the range from ultra-low to room temperatures [29, 112, 229]. Understanding nonlinear damping and its dependence on the material, geometry, and temperature is on the agenda [9, 280]. Another direction is thermal effects in nanostructures. Heat transfer has been measured in graphene and MoSe2 monolayers down to cryogenic temperatures, and slow equilibration between different vibrational branches of graphene has been established using photothermal response [98, 584]; see also [585]. The mechanical detection and control of magnetic states and magnetic phase transitions in two-dimensional layered antiferromagnetic CrI3 and FePS3 materials have been demonstrated down to two layers [586, 587]. Charge density wave transition has also been measured in 2HTaS2 and 2H-TaSe2 layered materials [588]. On the side of the electron-vibrational coupling, it has been shown using carbon nanotubes that, where the coupling is sufficiently strong, it results in controlled vibration cooling or excitation of self-sustained vibrations in response to source-drain voltage [33, 333].\nMuch work is being done on characterizing two-level fluctuators with the NVSs. A promising direction is opened by passively cooling NVSs down to very low temperatures [29, 589\u2013591], including sub-millikelvin temperatures, where even MHz-range modes are close to the quantum ground state [231]. The characteristic temperature dependencies of the decay rate and the frequency shift of the NVS modes found by the ring-down measurements and by the measurements of the response and fluctuation spectra provide an insight into the relaxation mechanisms of two-level systems in nanostructures.\nNVSs have demonstrated superior sensitivity and spatial resolution in studying superfluid 3He and 4He. They have been used to detect Cooper pair breaking in 3He [592], as well as measure helium viscosity, detect modulated \u201cphonon wind\u201d [186, 206], trap a single vortex [593], and study new effects of quantum turbulence at ultra-low temperatures [401, 594] in 4He. A series of first-order layering transitions of liquid helium on a carbon nanotube\nobserved by Noury et al. [204] suggests the possibility of new types of phase transitions on smooth defect-free cylindrical surfaces.\nNanomechanics has essentially opened the field of experimental studies of nonlinear dynamics of fluctuating vibrational systems. The field is vibrant. Fluctuations can now be measured in real time. For a carbon nanotube, such measurements have revealed a weakly chaotic regime in which, at room temperature, the energy concentrates in low-frequency modes, disperses into higherfrequency modes, and then returns [595], reminiscent of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou behavior. The interplay of fluctuations and nonlinearity leads to rich dynamics in systems with a few or even one vibrational mode away from thermal equilibrium, which is related to breaking of the detailed balance [464], see Sec. VII C. This includes scaling behavior of fluctuations near various types of bifurcation points [596, 597], the onset of chaos in the rotating frame [32, 598], and new types of fluctuation squeezing in driven systems in the nonlinear regime [459, 599]. Noise squeezing in a nonlinear regime may improve the measurement sensitivity, in particular for the phase-based measurements [see Sec. IX], by reducing the detrimental effect of thermal noise. Reducing measurement noise is also on the agenda, and to this end there are explored new detection methods, such as focused electron beams [600].\nAmong various nonlinear resonant phenomena that can be accessed with the NVSs, of an increasing interest are nanomechanical frequency combs. Such combs have been generated in coupled modes that display nonlinear resonance or in a single mode using feedback control [383, 601\u2013603]. A large number of spectral lines has been observed in nanomechanical systems with coupled modes displaying a SNIC bifurcation [382], see Sec. VIII B, or by parametrically inducing resonant mode coupling [604]. However, driven nonlinear NVSs are expected to display a multiple-line comb even where there is just a single mode involved, but the dissipation is nonlinear [605].\nThe high sensitivity of the NVSs provides a means for addressing fundamental physics problems. A part of them is related to the Casimir force at small distances and its dependence on the material properties and the geometry, as well as thermal and nonequilibrium effects [177, 178, 606, 607]. The possibility of studying the interplay of quantum mechanics and gravity [608, 609] is being explored. A study of non-Newtonian gravity and even the physics beyond the standard model, particularly with levitated particles, which can be now cooled down to their ground quantum state, is also being discussed [610, 611]. Very slowly decaying vibrations (with decay rate < 100 \u00b5Hz) of levitated nanoparticles are being considered in a somewhat exotic context of the wave-function collapse [612].\nMuch attention is attracted to various coherent quantum effects in the coupled NVSs [162, 164, 613]. These and a number of other quantum effects, such as cooling the vibrations to their ground state by coupling them to\n51\nan electromagnetic cavity (see Sec. VIII C), using NVSs to convert microwave-frequency excitation of a superconducting qubit into an optical photon [573], or optically reading out a transmon qubit [614], are often studied in the context of optomechanics, a burgeoning area born out of nanomechanics [7]. Recent improvements of nanofabricated NVSs [29, 54, 615] will lead to further advances in optomechanics.\nOne of the most important applications of NVSs is the emerging technology of single-molecule mass spectrometry with potentially high throughput. It will take advantage of the NVSs based inertial imaging [192, 195]. Nanowires and nanotubes hold promise as cantilevers for the next-generation scanning probe microscopes. By utilizing the fundamental modes polarized in perpendicular directions, such cantilevers enable direct imaging of the components of the force fields and establishing whether the field is potential [183, 184]. Cantilevers functionalized with a magnetic material at their free end [181] hold promise for imaging a large range of physical phenomena, such as skyrmions, superconducting vortices, and current-carrying edge states in two-dimensional systems [548]. Magnetic resonance force microscopy with single nuclear spin sensitivity is another direction of great interest [616, 617]."

            "text": "The Bogoliubov-Krylov method of averaging used to derive the equation of motion for the complex amplitude of the mode is similar to the rotating wave approximation (RWA) in quantum mechanics. One thinks of the mode dynamics as vibrations at the mode frequency \u03c90 with the amplitude A(t) and phase \u03c6(t) that slowly vary on the time scale of the vibration period 2\u03c0/\u03c90, that is, the mode coordinate is q(t) = A(t) cos[\u03c90t + \u03c6(t)]. We note that \u03c6(t) here is the \u201creduced\u201d phase, it does not\ncontain the term \u03c90t. The complex slow variable u(t) (the complex amplitude) defined by Eq. (20) is simply related to A and \u03c6,\nu(t) = 1\n2\n( q \u2212 i p\nM\u03c90\n) e\u2212i\u03c90t = 1\n2 A(t) exp[i\u03c6(t)]. (A1)\nFor a harmonic mode that is not coupled to a bath, A and \u03c6 are independent of time and u(t) = const. A more general form of the averaging method is discussed in Appendix F.\nIn this section we show how the dynamics is modified by the weak nonlinearity of the mode. To simplify the reading we repeat some equations from the main text. We illustrate the Bogoliubov-Krylov method by applying it to the Duffing oscillator. The goal is to describe the dynamics on times that largely exceed the vibration period 2\u03c0/\u03c90. A direct perturbation theory in the nonlinearity does not apply, as it leads to a secular (\u221d t) correction to the oscillator displacement. Instead one should use the asymptotic perturbation theory.\nThe Hamiltonian of a nonlinear mode is\nH0 = 1\n2M p2 + U(q). (A2)\nFor the Duffing model the potential energy is\nU(q) = 1\n2 M\u03c920q\n2 + 1\n4 M\u03b3q4,\nsee Eq. (46). With the account taken of the relation p = Mq\u0307, we obtain from the definition of u(t), Eq. (A1), u\u0307 exp(i\u03c90t)+ u\u0307\u2217 exp(\u2212i\u03c90t) = 0. Therefore\nq\u0308 + \u03c920q = 2i\u03c90u\u0307e i\u03c90t = \u22122i\u03c90u\u0307\u2217e\u2212i\u03c90t, (A3)\nand the Hamiltonian equation of motion for u(t) reads\nu\u0307 = i \u03b3\n2\u03c90\n( uei\u03c90t + u\u2217e\u2212i\u03c90t )3 e\u2212i\u03c90t. (A4)\nThe time scale on which u(t) varies because of the nonlinearity is seen from Eq. (A4) to be \u223c \u03c90/|\u03b3| \u03c9\u221210 . The right-hand side of Eq. (A4) contains the smooth term \u221d u|u|2, which is a constant for a time \u03b4t \u03c90/|\u03b3| (since practically u(t) does not change over this time), and the terms that oscillate as exp(\u00b12i\u03c90t), exp(\u22124i\u03c90t). All these terms are of the same order of magnitude. However, if we now integrate them over time \u03b4t \u03c9\u221210 , the contribution of the smooth term will be \u221d \u03b4t, whereas the contribution of the fast-oscillating terms will be \u221d \u03c9\u221210 \u03b4t. Therefore to describe the dynamics of the oscillator on times \u03c9\u221210 the fast-oscillating terms can be disregarded and the equation of motion becomes\nu\u0307 \u2248 3i\u03b3u|u|2/2\u03c90, u(t) \u2248 u(0)e3i\u03b3|u| 2t/2\u03c90 . (A5)\nIn this approximation |u(t)| does not change in time, i.e., the vibration amplitude A \u2248 (4|u|2)1/2 does not\n52\nchange. However, the vibration phase acquires an extra term 3\u03b3|u|2t/2\u03c90. Comparing Eq. (A5) with the expression q(t) = u(t) exp(i\u03c90t) + c.c. [cf. Eq. (A1)], one can see that it corresponds to the change of the oscillator frequency (48),\n\u03c90 \u2192 \u03c90 + 3\u03b3|u|2/2\u03c90 = \u03c90 + 3\u03b3A2/8\u03c90."

            "text": "We now extend the Bogoliubov-Krylov method to describe the dynamics of the mode where it is weakly coupled to a thermal reservoir. There are two parts to this description, which are closely intertwined. One part is the evaluation of the average reaction force from the bath in slow time compared to \u03c9\u221210 . The second part refers to the random part of the force from the bath, the noise in the equations of motion for u(t), and its properties in slow time. In the ensuing approximation, the mode dynamics in slow time is Markovian.\nFor the coupling to the bath of the form Hi = qhb, the part of the force from the bath that describes the reaction of the bath to the mode (the backaction) is\nF (r) b (t) = \u2212\u03b4hb(t) \u2248 \u2212\u3008\u03b4hb(t)\u3009\n\u2248 \u02c6 \u221e\n0\nXb(t\u2032)[u(t\u2212 t\u2032)ei\u03c90(t\u2212t \u2032) + c.c.] (A6)\ncf. Eq. (16). Here Xb(t) is the time-dependent bath susceptibility. We remind that this expression is an approximation, as we have replaced the full reaction force \u03b4hb(t) with its ensemble-averaged value \u3008\u03b4hb(t)\u3009 and kept in the latter only the lowest-order term, which describes the linear response of the bath to the bath-mode coupling.\nWe now expand u(t\u2212 t\u2032) = u(t)\u2212 t\u2032u\u0307(t) + . . . and keep only the first term in this expansion [385], relying on the smoothness of u(t) (see also below). Then, using the definition of the Fourier transform of the bath susceptibility\n\u03c7b(\u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e 0 dt exp(i\u03c9t)Xb(t) (A7)\nand taking into account that \u03c7b(\u03c9) = \u03c7 \u2217 b(\u2212\u03c9) [24], we obtain for the reaction force\nF (r) b (t) \u2248 \u03c7\u2217b(\u03c90)u(t)ei\u03c90t + c.c. (A8)\nThis force is determined by the instantaneous value of u(t) rather than the evolution of u(t\u2032) for t\u2032 \u2264 t.\nSubstituting the force (A8) into the full equation of motion for the mode coordinate q(t) and using Eq. (A3), we obtain the equation of motion (21) for u(t), which we reproduce here for completeness:\nu\u0307 = \u2212(\u0393\u2212 iP)u+ \u03be(t), \u0393 = Im\u03c7b(\u03c90)/2M\u03c90, P = \u2212Re\u03c7b(\u03c90)/2M\u03c90 (A9)\n[the term \u03be(t) describes the noise; it does not come from F (r) b and is discussed below]. In Eq. (A9) we assumed\nthat \u0393 \u03c90 and, in the spirit of the averaging method, disregarded the fast-oscillating term \u221d \u0393u\u2217 exp(\u22122i\u03c90t) compared with \u0393u.\nIn deriving Eqs. (A8) and (A9) we further assumed that the bath susceptibility \u03c7b(\u03c9) weakly varies with \u03c9 in a band of width \u223c \u0393, |P | \u03c90 centered at \u03c90. It is this assumption that justifies disregarding the term t\u2032u\u0307(t) and higher-order derivatives of u(t) in the expansion of u(t\u2212 t\u2032) in Eq. (A6). In particular, the term t\u2032u\u0307 gives a correction\n\u223c \u2223\u2223\u2223(d\u03c7b/d\u03c9)\u03c9=\u03c90 u\u0307\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u223c \u0393\u2223\u2223\u2223u(d\u03c7b/d\u03c9)\u03c9=\u03c90\u2223\u2223\u2223,\nwhich is assumed small compared with the term \u223c |\u03c7b(\u03c90)u| kept in Eq. (A9). The assumption holds for |d log\u03c7b/d\u03c9| 1. It is assumed that the higher derivatives of \u03c7b are small near \u03c90 as well. The typical frequency on which \u03c7b(\u03c9) changes provides the other reciprocal \u201cfast\u201d time of the mode+bath system, in addition to \u03c9\u221210 . It is sometimes called the correlation time of the thermal reservoir tcorr; note, however, that \u03c7b(\u03c9) characterizes not just the reservoir, but also the coupling of the oscillator to the reservoir.\nThe approximation (A9) is a Markovian approximation in slow time. It holds if the response of the bath to the oscillator remains essentially unchanged where the oscillator frequency is changed not only by \u0393, but also by the polaronic frequency shift P . In the analysis of the nonlinear oscillator we will further assume that the response of the bath does not change due to the change of the oscillator frequency caused by the dependence of this frequency on the vibration amplitude.\nThe Bogoliubov-Krylov method of averaging can be applied also to the analysis of the effect of the thermal noise on the slow variables. The noise in Eq. (A9) is\n\u03be(t) = (\u2212i/2M\u03c90)h(0)b (t) exp(\u2212i\u03c90t),\nwhere h (0) b (t) is the force on the oscillator from the bath calculated by disregarding the reaction of the bath to the oscillator. The noise correlator is simply expressed in terms of the bath power spectrum\nSb(\u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e \u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9t\u3008h(0)b (t)h (0) b (0)\u3009. (A10)\nClearly, \u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 \u221d \u00b4 d\u03c9Sb(\u03c9) exp[\u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)(t\u2212 t\u2032)]. We note that Sb(\u03c9) also defines the bath susceptibility, and thus the mode decay rate, via the fluctuationdissipation theorem (cf. Sec. IV),\nIm\u03c7b(\u03c9) = Sb(\u03c9)/2~[n\u0304(\u03c9) + 1].\nIf we replace Sb(\u03c9)\u2192 Sb(\u03c90) and use the relation (A9) between \u0393 and \u03c7b(\u03c90), we obtain\n\u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 = (\u0393kBT/M\u03c920)\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032).\nAs indicated in Sec. IV B, the \u03b4-function here is not a true \u03b4-function but, effectively, a \u03b4-function on the time scale\n53\n\u03c9\u221210 , tcorr. By expanding Sb(\u03c9) in a series about \u03c90, we find that \u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 has a peak at t = t\u2032 with width |t\u2212 t\u2032| . |S\u22121b d2Sb/d\u03c92|1/2 = tcorr, where the derivative of Sb is calculated for \u03c9 = \u03c90 (the above expression may be considered a definition of tcorr). The width tcorr is much smaller then \u0393\u22121 for Sb(\u03c9) smooth near \u03c90. The argument here coincides with the argument used in disregarding delay in Eq. (A8).\nThe correlator \u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be\u2217(t\u2032)\u3009 has an extra factor exp[i\u03c90(t + t\n\u2032)] compared to the correlator \u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009. This fast-oscillating factor averages out to zero on the time scale large compared to \u03c9\u221210 . Therefore in the analysis of the evolution of the slow variables u(t), u\u2217(t) one can set \u3008\u03be\u2217(t)\u03be\u2217(t\u2032)\u3009 = 0. The analysis of the higherorder correlators shows that the noise \u03be(t) is approximately Gaussian on the time scale large compared to \u03c9\u221210 , tcorr. For a bath modeled by a set of harmonic oscillators, with the coupling hb nonlinear in the coordinates of these oscillators, this was shown by Dykman and Krivoglaz [385, 386]. The analysis applies to the both classical and quantum cases. We note that a similar analysis has to be carried out to justify the expression for the reaction force in terms of the linear response of the bath to the mode."

The scale of the flatness is now \u03c90, not \u0393, |P |. For a flat Sb(\u03c9), in the classical limit we can approximate the correlation function sb(t) by a \u03b4-function,\nsb(t) \u2261 \u3008h(0)b (t)h (0) b (0)\u3009 = 4M\u0393kBT\u03b4(t). (A11)\nEquation (A11) is essentially the definition of the parameter \u0393 in terms of the correlator sb(t), temperature, and the mode mass M for the case considered in this section.\nTaking into account that, for a classical bath, Xb(t) = \u2212(kBT )\u22121dsb/dt, one obtains from Eqs. (A6) the reaction force in the form\nF (r) b (t) =\nsb(0) kBT q(t)\u2212 \u02c6 \u221e 0 dt\u2032 sb(t \u2032) kBT dq(t\u2212 t\u2032) dt . (A12)\nFor the \u03b4-correlated noise (A11), the last term in Eq. (A12) gives the friction force \u22122M\u0393q\u0307 in the equation of motion (2). Thus the reaction of the bath leads to viscous friction, with the friction force proportional to the mode velocity. With the account taken of Eq. (A11), the overall dynamics of the mode is mapped on Brownian motion.\nThe first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (A12) renormalizes the mode frequency, \u03c920 \u2192 \u03c920 \u2212 sb(0)/MkBT . This is a classical polaronic effect. In calculating sb(0) one should keep in mind that the power\nspectrum Sb(\u03c9) falls off for high frequencies, which makes sb(0) finite.\nTo the best of our knowledge, for a classical oscillator the frequency shift was first found by Bogolyubov [12] for the model where the bath is a set of harmonic oscillators and hb is linear in the coordinates qk of these oscillators. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the bath Hb reads\nHb = 1\n2 \u2211 k (p2k + \u03c9 2 kq 2 k) (A13)\nwhereas the coupling Hamiltonian is qhb = \u2211 k kqqk. The coupling was weak and the dynamics was Markovian only in the rotating frame.\nIn the quantum theory, the constraint on the coupling parameters in the model (A13) that leads to a viscous friction force in the laboratory frame was found by Caldeira and Leggett [22]. The expression for the friction coefficient \u0393 comes out if one assumes that the density of states of the bath weighted with the interaction has the form \u2211\nk\n( 2k/\u03c9k)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k) = (4/\u03c0)M\u0393\u03c9."

We first recall that the coordinate and momentum of the oscillator are expressed in terms of the ladder operators a and a\u2020 as q = (~/2M\u03c90)1/2(a + a\u2020) and p = \u2212i(~M\u03c90/2)1/2(a \u2212 a\u2020). In the analysis of the quantum dynamics it is convenient to use the eigenfunctions |k\u3009 of the occupation number operator a\u2020a; the energy of the isolated harmonic oscillator in a state |k\u3009 is ~\u03c90(k + 1/2).\nThe coupling qhb of the quantum oscillator to a thermal bath leads to transitions between the nearest oscillator energy levels in Fig. 32(a).

            "heading": "Appendix C: Driving-induced cooling and heating for coupled modes",
            "text": "The possibility to cool a mechanical mode by a driving that resonantly couples it to a high-frequency optical mode in a cavity plays a fundamental role in optomechanics [7]. However, a mechanical mode can also be cooled down or heated up by coupling it to another mechanical mode or a mode of a different physical nature or just a thermal reservoir. An interesting and not a priori obvious part of the effect is that the stationary distribution of the driven mode is of the Boltzmann form with an effective temperature. This happens if there is no nonlinear friction and the relaxation rate of the considered mode is much smaller than the relaxation rate of the mode it is coupled to [534].\nFormally, we consider two modes with eigenfrequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 and the pumping (modulation) of the form of Eq. (68), with energy\nUpump12 = Mq1q2\u2206\u030412 cos\u03c9pt\n[this corresponds to setting in Eq. (68) \u2206pump12 (t) = \u2206\u030412 cos\u03c9pt]. For brevity we set the effective masses of the modes to be equal to the same value M . The modulation frequency \u03c9p is either close to |\u03c91\u2212\u03c92| or \u03c91 +\u03c92. In what follows we assume for concreteness that \u03c91 < \u03c92. We introduce p = \u00b11 such that \u03c9p is close to \u03c92\u2212 p\u03c91, i.e., either to \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91 or to \u03c92 + \u03c91.\nIn writing down the master equation for the modes we will assume that each mode is coupled to its thermal reservoir and, in the absence of the driving, their decay rates are \u03931 and \u03932. We will further assume that the decay rates do not change if the mode eigenfrequencies are slightly changed. For example, if \u03c92 is changed to \u03c9p + p\u03c91; for the considered resonant pumping |\u03c9p + p\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92| \u03c91,2. We will write the master equation using the ladder operators a1, a \u2020 1 and a2, a \u2020 2 for the modes 1 and 2, similar to how it was done in Section B for a single mode. We will also switch to the rotating frame and use the rotating wave approximation. A unitary transformation to the rotating frame is\nU(t) = exp[\u2212i\u03c91ta\u20201a1 \u2212 i(\u03c9p + p\u03c91)ta\u20202a2].\nIn the rotating wave approximation, the master equation for the density matrix \u03c1 of the coupled modes reads\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2211 j \u0393\u0302j\u03c1+ i \u03b4\u03c9p[a \u2020 2a2, \u03c1]\u2212 i[h\u030212, \u03c1],\n\u0393\u0302j\u03c1 = 2\u0393j [ (n\u0304j + 1)D[aj ]\u03c1+ n\u0304jD[a\u2020j ]\u03c1 ] \u03b4\u03c9p = \u03c9p + p\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 (C1)\nwhere n\u0304k = n\u0304(\u03c9k) (k = 1, 2). The Lindblad superoperators D[L] are defined in Eq. (B5). Compared to Eq. (B4), in Eq. (C1) we have disregarded the nonlinearity of the modes and their eigenfrequency shifts due to the coupling to the thermal reservoirs.\nThe operator h\u030212 describes the resonantly induced mode coupling,\nh\u030212 = \u220612(a \u2020 1a2 + a \u2020 2a1), \u03c9p \u2248 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91 h\u030212 = \u220612(a1a2 + a \u2020 1a \u2020 2), \u03c9p \u2248 \u03c92 + \u03c91 (C2)\nwhere \u220612 = \u2206\u030412/4 \u221a \u03c91\u03c92. This parameter is of central importance, as it characterizes the coupling strength. The physical picture of the mode dynamics is simplified in the case where the relaxation rates \u03931 and \u03932 are very different. For concreteness, we will assume that\n\u03932 \u03931. In this case mode 2 adiabatically follows mode 1. If the coupling is sufficiently weak, |\u220612| \u03932, one can think of the linear response of mode 2 to the state of mode 1. This response is formed over time \u223c 1/\u03932 whereas the state of mode 1 varies over a significantly longer time.\nIn the adiabatic approximation the dynamics of mode 1 can be described by tracing out mode 2. We introduce the density matrix of mode 1, \u03c11 = Tr2\u03c1, where Tr2 denotes the trace over the states of mode 2. Similarly, \u3008a2\u30092 = Tr2(a2\u03c1) and \u3008a\u20202\u30092 = Tr2(a\u20202\u03c1); we emphasize that these averages over the states of mode 2 are operators with respect to mode 1.\nBy taking trace over mode 2 in Eq. (C1) we obtain \u03c1\u03071 = \u0393\u03021\u03c11 \u2212 i\u220612 ( [a\u20201, \u3008a2\u30092] + [a1, \u3008a\u20202\u30092] ) . (C3)\nThe equation for \u3008a2\u30092 has the form d\ndt \u3008a2\u30092 = \u0393\u03021\u3008a2\u30092 \u2212 (\u03932 \u2212 i\u03b4\u03c9p)\u3008a2\u30092 \u2212 iTr2(a2[h\u030212, \u03c1]). (C4)\nIn the considered regime of fast relaxation rate \u03932 we can look for the quasistationary solution of this equation. Respectively, we will disregard d\u3008a2\u30092/dt. We will also disregard the term \u221d \u03931 compared to the term \u221d \u03932. To describe the linear response of mode 2 to the coupling, we will calculate the last term in Eq. (C4) to the lowest order in the coupling, i.e., we will set \u3008a\u20202a2\u30092 \u2248 n\u03042\u03c11, whereas the term \u3008a22\u30092 will be disregarded. This gives\n\u3008a2\u30092 \u2248 \u2212i \u220612\n\u03932 \u2212 i\u03b4\u03c9p [(n\u03042 + 1)a1\u03c11 \u2212 n\u03042\u03c11a1].\nSubstituting this expression and the similar expression for \u3008a\u20202\u30092 into Eq. (C3), we obtain\n\u03c1\u03071 = \u2212\u0393eff [ (n\u0304eff + 1)D[a1]\u03c11 + n\u0304effD[a\u20201]\u03c11 ] \u2212 iPeff [a\u20201a1, \u03c11], (C5)\nwhere\n\u0393eff = \u03931 + p\u03932 \u2206212\n\u039322 + \u03b4\u03c9 2 p\n,\nn\u0304eff = \u0393 \u22121 eff [ \u03931n\u03041 + \u03932\n\u2206212 \u039322 + \u03b4\u03c9 2 p\n( n\u03042 \u2212\np \u2212 1 2\n)] (C6)\n56\nand Peff = \u03b4\u03c9p \u2206 2 12/(\u0393 2 2 + \u03b4\u03c9 2 p).\nRemarkably, Eq. (C5) maps the dynamics of the driven slowly decaying mode (mode 1) onto the dynamics of an undriven mode with an effective decay rate \u0393eff and an effective mean occupation number n\u0304eff [534]. As seen from Eq. (C5), \u0393eff exceeds \u03931 for \u03c92 \u2248 \u03c9p +\u03c91 and is smaller than \u03931 for \u03c92 +\u03c91 \u2248 \u03c9p. At the same time, the effective occupation number n\u0304eff is smaller or larger than n\u03041. Respectively, in the stationary regime the effective temperature of the mode kBTeff = ~\u03c91/ ln[(n\u0304eff +1)/n\u0304eff ] is lower or higher than the temperature of the thermal reservoir. This describes the sideband cooling for \u03c92 \u2248 \u03c9p + \u03c91 by \u201csuperposing\u201d onto a low-frequency mode the distribution over the states of a higher-frequency mode. On the other hand, a sufficiently strong drive with \u03c9p \u2248 \u03c92 +\u03c91 leads to \u0393eff becoming equal to zero, which manifests an instability of the system."

            "text": "A classical Duffing oscillator driven by a resonant force F cos\u03c9F t experiences the same friction force and the same noise from the thermal bath as in the absence of driving, provided the detuning of the drive frequency from the eigenfrequency |\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90| is small compared to the reciprocal correlation time of the bath t\u22121corr. We assume that the driving is not extremely strong so that the amplitudes of the vibration overtones remain small compared to the amplitude of the main tone. It is then convenient to describe the dynamics by switching to the rotating frame and using the real variables Q,P , which are related to the coordinate and momentum of the driven oscillator by the expression\nQ+ iP = [q + i(p/M\u03c9F )] exp(i\u03c9F t) (D1)\n[cf. Eq. (61)]. These variables are similar to (twice) the real and imaginary parts of the complex amplitude in the absence of driving u\u2217(t), Eq. (A1), except that for a driven oscillator it is more convenient to change to the frame oscillating at frequency \u03c9F rather than \u03c90.\nThe equations for Q,P are derived similarly to the equation for u(t). Disregarding small corrections to Q,P that oscillate at frequency \u03c9F and its overtones, we obtain\nQ\u0307 = \u2202P gr(Q,P )\u2212 \u0393Q+ \u03beQ(t) P\u0307 = \u2212\u2202Qgr(Q,P )\u2212 \u0393P + \u03beP (t), (D2)\nwhere\ngr = 3\u03b3 32\u03c9F (Q2 + P 2)2 \u2212 1 2 \u03b4\u03c9(Q2 + P 2)\u2212 F 2M\u03c9F Q,\n\u03b4\u03c9 = \u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90, |\u03b4\u03c9| \u03c9F (D3) (the subscript r here stands for \u201cresonant\u201d). The major difference from Eq. (A9) is that Eq. (D2) is written in\nreal variables and includes the Duffing nonlinearity \u221d \u03b3 and the driving force \u221d F ; the bath-induced frequency shift has been incorporated into \u03c90.\nThe variables Q and P and the time can be rescaled, so that the equations of motion contain only two parameters, in the absence of noise [461]. The noise components \u03beQ(t) and \u03beP (t) are independent \u03b4-correlated Gaussian noises with the same intensity as in the absence of the driving\n\u3008\u03beQ(t)\u03beQ(0)\u3009 = \u3008\u03beP (t)\u03beP (0)\u3009 = (2\u0393kBT/M\u03c920)\u03b4(t). (D4)\nIf the decay and the noise are disregarded, Eqs. (D2) become Hamiltonian equations for the coordinate Q and momentum P of the oscillator in the rotating frame (the in-phase and quadrature components). The function gr(Q,P ) is the Floquet Hamiltonian. In the parameter range where the oscillator is bistable (in the presence of weak dissipation) it has the form of a tilted Mexican hat, see Fig. 33(a). The cross-sections of the surface gr(Q,P ) in Fig. 33(b) show the oscillator trajectories (D2) in the rotating frame in the limit of zero dissipation. Note the strong asymmetry (a horseshoe-like shape) of the trajectories that go around the minimum of gr(Q,P ).\nIn the absence of noise, Eq. (D2) has 3 stationary solutions in the region inside the \u201ccurvilinear triangle\u201d on the (F, \u03c9F )-plane in Fig. 15(b). The solutions with the largest and smallest values of Q2 + P 2 are stable, and the solution with the intermediate Q2 + P 2 is the saddle point. In the limit \u0393 \u2192 0 these states correspond, respectively, to the local minimum and maximum of the function gr(Q,P ) and to its saddle point, see Fig. 33(a). Near the saddle point gr(Q,P ) has the shape of a hyperboloid. Through this point there goes the separatrix that separates the basins of attraction of the stable states for a finite damping. The phase portrait of the system in the range of bistability is shown in Fig. 33(c), which complements Fig. 15(c).\nThe boundaries of the range of the bistability, i.e., the sides of the \u201ccurvilinear triangle\u201d in Fig. 15(b), are the bifurcation lines. On the line with smaller F the stable state with the larger amplitude merges with the saddle point, whereas on the line with larger F it is the smalleramplitude state that merges with the saddle point. The bifurcational values FB1,2 \u2261 FB1,2(\u2126r) of the drive amplitude as a function of the drive frequency are given by the expression\nF\u0303 2B1,2 = 2\n27\n[ \u21263r + 9\u2126r \u2213 (\u21262r \u2212 3)3/2 ] ,\nF\u0303 = (3\u03b3/32\u03c93F\u0393 3)1/2F, \u2126r = (\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)/\u0393. (D5)\nEquation (D5) is written for the Duffing nonlinearity parameter \u03b3 > 0; for \u03b3 < 0 one should replace \u03b3 \u2192 |\u03b3| in the expression for F\u0303B1,2 and \u03b4\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9F \u2212\u03c90 \u2192 \u2212\u03b4\u03c9 in the expression for the scaled frequency detuning \u2126r.\n57\na. Universality of fluctuations near a bifurcation point\nThe dynamics and fluctuations display universal features near bifurcation points. These features are characteristic, in particular, for merging of a stable state with a saddle point [called the saddle-node bifurcation [523]]. The equations of motion (D2) are simplified where the\nstates are close to each other in phase space. The rates at which the dynamical variables Q and P approach their stable values become very different. The relaxation rate of the in-phase component Q is \u2248 2\u0393, whereas the relaxation rate of the quadrature component P goes to zero at the bifurcation parameter value, so that P is a slow variable near the bifurcation point. This variable is an analog of a soft mode in the phase transition theory. Its fluctuations can be analyzed in the adiabatic approximation, assuming that the component Q(t) adiabatically follows P (t). As a result, the equation for the time evolution of P (t) takes the form\nP\u0307 = \u2212\u2202PUB(P ) + \u03beP (t), (D6) UB(P ) = \u2212\u03b1B1[F \u2212 FB(\u2126r)](P \u2212 PB) + \u03b1B2(P \u2212 PB)3. The explicit form of the parameters \u03b1B1,2 and the value PB of the quadrature at the bifurcation point depend on \u2126r [483].\nFor \u03b1B1\u03b1B2(F \u2212FB) > 0 the potential UB has a minimum and a maximum, with the minimum corresponding to the stable state of the mode and the maximum corresponding to the saddle point. The relaxation rate near the stable state scales with the distance to the bifurcation point F \u2212 FB(\u2126r) as [12\u03b1B1\u03b1B2(F \u2212 FB(\u2126r)]1/2.\nThe \u201csoftening\u201d of the potential UB(P ) near the bifurcation point leads to an increase in fluctuations. Of particular interest is the effect of the fluctuation-induced switching from the dynamically stable vibrational state to the coexisting state with a strongly different amplitude. Equation (D6) reduces the problem of the switching rate to the problem of escape from a potential well for a static cubic-parabola potential UB(P ) in a system with no inertia. The rate of escape for this problem is well-known [474],\nWsw \u221d exp(\u2212M\u03c920\u2206UB/2\u0393kBT ), where \u2206U is the height of the potential barrier around the stable state,\n\u2206UB = 4|\u03b1B2| [\u03b1B1(F \u2212 FB)/3\u03b1B2]3/2. (D7) This barrier height scales as the distance to the bifurcation point to the power 3/2. Such scaling has been seen in micro- and nanomechanical vibrational systems as well as in Josephson junction based systems [56, 478, 488, 489]. We note that, since FB \u2261 FB(\u2126r), the bifurcation point can be approached by varying the drive amplitude or the drive frequency or both.\nThe values of the driving amplitude and frequency where FB1 = FB2 give the critical point in Fig. 15. Near this point the variables Q and P also separate into comparatively fast and slow, with the equation for the slow variable P having the form (D6), except that the effective potential UB(P ) has to be replaced with the potential Uc(P ), with\nUc(P ) = \u03b1c1(P \u2212 Pc)4 \u2212 \u03b1c2[\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )c](P \u2212 Pc)2 + {\u03b1\u2032c3[\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )c] + \u03b1\u2032\u2032c3(F \u2212 Fc)}(P \u2212 Pc) (D8)\n58\nwhere Pc, (\u03c9F )c, and Fc are the values of P , \u03c9F , and F at the critical point. These values as well as the parameters \u03b1c1,c2,c3 are easy to find from Eqs. (D2) and (D3) [483].\nThe critical point on the (F, \u03c9F )-plane is reminiscent of the critical point on the line of the first-order phase transition. Fluctuations become strong and their correlation time diverges as the oscillator approaches this point. In the range of bistability, as determined by the interrelation between F \u2212Fc and \u03c9F \u2212(\u03c9F )c, the potential Uc(P ) has two minima. It becomes symmetric on the line on the (F, \u03c9F ) plane where the coefficient at the linear in P \u2212Pc term is zero. On this line the switching rates between the two minima are equal to each other and the barrier height between the minima is \u03b12c2[\u03c9F \u2212 (\u03c9F )c]2/4\u03b1c1. This barrier height as determined from the switching rate allows finding the eigenfrequency and the nonlinearity parameter of a nanomechanical mode with extremely high precision [476]."

            "text": "Parametric modulation of an oscillator can be described by incorporating into its Hamiltonian the term \u2212(Fpq2/2) cos\u03c9pt. The phenomenological equation of motion then takes the form (62). For the modulation at frequency \u03c9p close to 2\u03c90, it is convenient to analyze the dynamics by switching to the quadratures Q and P that remain almost constant on the time scale 1/\u03c9p. The transformation is similar to that for the resonant drive, Eq. (D1),\nQ+ iP = ( q + i p\nM\u03c9p/2\n) exp(i\u03c9pt/2) (D9)\n[as in Eq. (D1), Q and P are real]. In the rotating wave approximation the equations for Q and P have the same form as Eq. (D2), but now the function gr has to be replaced with the function gp,\nQ\u0307 = \u2202P gp(Q,P )\u2212 \u0393Q+ \u03beQ(t), P\u0307 = \u2212\u2202Qgp(Q,P )\u2212 \u0393P + \u03beP (t), (D10)\nwhere\ngp = 3\u03b3 16\u03c9p (Q2 + P 2)2 \u2212 1 2 \u03b4\u03c9p(Q 2 + P 2),\n+ Fp\n4M\u03c9p (P 2 \u2212Q2), \u03b4\u03c9p = \u03c9p 2 \u2212 \u03c90. (D11)\nThis equation applies provided |\u03b4\u03c9p| \u03c9p. If the decay and the noise are disregarded, Eqs. (D10) become Hamiltonian equations for the coordinate Q and momentum P in the rotating frame. The function gp(Q,P ) is the Hamiltonian (we note that this is not a Floquet Hamiltonian; this is the Hamiltonian in the frame oscillating at frequency \u03c9p/2). In the parameter range where the oscillator has two stable states (in the\npresence of weak dissipation) it has the form of a symmetric double-well surface, see Fig. 33(d). The cross-sections of these surface shown in Fig. 33(e) illustrate the phase trajectories in the rotating frame in the limit of zero dissipation.\nThe symmetry is a feature of the parametric resonance. Indeed, incrementing the time by half of the modulation period 2\u03c0/\u03c9p does not change the equation of motion in the laboratory frame, Eq. (62). Yet, as seen from Eq. (D9), it leads to the change Q\u2192 \u2212Q, P \u2192 \u2212P .\nThe phase portrait in the presence of dissipation is shown in Fig. 33(f). This figure refers to the parameter range where only two vibrational states are stable. As expected from the above arguments, the phase portrait has inversion symmetry. Similar to a resonantly driven mode, the regions of attraction to the stable states a1, a2 are separated by the separatrix that goes through the saddle point S.\nThe variables Q,P and the time can be rescaled, so that, in the absence of noise, the dynamics is described by two dimensionless parameters, \u00b5p and fp,\n\u00b5p = (\u03b4\u03c9p/\u0393)sgn\u03b3, fp = Fp/2M\u0393\u03c9p. (D12)\nFigure 16(a) shows the regions of the (fp, \u00b5p)-plane where there exist different numbers of vibrational and steady states in the absence of nonlinear friction. The bifurcation lines \u00b5B1,2 (the bifurcational values of \u00b5p as functions of fp) are given by the equation\n\u00b5B1,2 = \u2213(f2p \u2212 1)1/2. (D13)\nFor weak modulation or large \u2212\u00b5p the mode is not excited, the vibration amplitude is zero. At \u00b5p = \u00b5B1 the zero-amplitude state becomes unstable, and in the range \u00b5B2 > \u00b5p > \u00b5B1 the system has two stable vibrational states (these are period-2 states with the opposite phases). For \u00b5p > \u00b5B2 and fp > 1 the zero-amplitude state is also stable, the mode has 3 stable states and also 2 unstable period-2 states. On the line fp = 1, \u00b5p > 0 the stable period-2 states merge with the unstable period-2 states and disappear. At the critical point \u00b5p = 0, fp = 1 all five stationary states merge.\nNear the bifurcation lines (D13) the dynamics and fluctuations of the nascent states are controlled by a \u201cslow\u201d dynamical variable, similar to the case of a resonantly driven mode. This variable is a linear combination of Q and P . A theory of fluctuations and the scaling of the rates of interstate switching in this parameter range was discussed by Lin et al. [404] and Dykman et al. [486].\nThe nonlinear friction significantly modifies the bifurcation diagram, as seen from Fig. 16 (b). The line on which the stable and unstable period-2 states merge is tilted and the critical point shifts. A profound consequence of this change is the hysteresis with the varying modulation frequency, as described in Sec. VII B.\n59\na. Fluctuation squeezing in the linear regime\nParametric modulation is often used as a way to squeeze fluctuations of one of the quadratures. The squeezing does not require exciting period-2 vibrations, it occurs already for a weak modulation. This can be seen from Eqs. (D10) and (D11) if one sets \u03b3 = 0. In the absence of modulation, Fp = 0, one has from these equations \u3008Q2\u3009 = \u3008P 2\u3009 = kBT/M\u03c920 in the case where the noise \u03beQ(t), \u03beP (t) is thermal. The stationary probability distribution \u03c1(Q,P ) is Gaussian, \u03c1(Q,P ) = Z\u22121 exp[\u2212M\u03c920(Q2 + P 2)/2kBT ]; it is a Boltzmann distribution of a harmonic oscillator, Z = M\u03c920/2\u03c0kBT .\nIn the presence of the modulation but below the excitation threshold, f2p < 1 + \u00b5 2 p, the stationary probability distribution in the rotating frame \u03c1(Q,P ) is still Gaussian, if one disregards the nonlinearity, \u03c1(Q,P ) = Z\u22121 exp(\u2212\u2211Aijxixj/2). Here i, j = 1, 2 and we use x1 \u2261 Q, x2 \u2261 P ; the normalization factor is Z = 2\u03c0/(det A\u0302)1/2. The matrix A\u0302 can be easily found from the Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to Eq. (D10) [in terms of the theory of stochastic processes, the latter is the Langevin equation for the fluctuating variables Q(t), P (t), see [10]]. We can make a unitary transformation from Q,P to Q\u2032, P \u2032 so as to diagonalize the matrix A\u0302. The variances \u3008Q\u20322\u3009 and \u3008P \u20322\u3009 are given, respectively, by A\u22121+ and A \u22121 \u2212 , where A \u22121 + and A \u22121 \u2212 are the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of A\u0302\u22121,\nA\u22121\u00b1 = kBT\nM\u03c920 1 + \u00b52p \u00b1 |fp|(1 + \u00b52p)1/2 1 + \u00b52p \u2212 f2p . (D14)\nOne can easily see that A\u22121\u2212 < kBT/M\u03c9 2 0 for f 2 p < 1 + \u00b52p, which shows that the variance \u3008P \u20322\u3009 = A\u22121\u2212 is smaller than the variance of the quadratures in the absence of driving. This demonstrates squeezing of classical fluctuations. The squeezing becomes more pronounced as the scaled modulation amplitude |fp| approaches the critical value (1 +\u00b52p) 1/2 where period-two vibrations are excited. Close to the critical |fp|, the eigenvalue A\u22121\u2212 is 1/2 of its value in the absence of the modulation. This is known as the 3 dB limit of squeezing. While A\u2212 decreases, fluctuations of the other quadrature increase, \u3008Q\u20322\u3009 = A\u22121+ > kBT/M\u03c920 . The difference between the variances was clearly demonstrated already in the first experiment on squeezing in nanomechanical systems [114].\nb. Squeezing of fluctuations about the state of forced vibrations\nHere we expand the discussion in Sec. VII C to describe what underlies the power spectrum-based detection of fluctuation squeezing in driven underdamped nonlinear modes. The detection exploits the fact that the spectrum of fluctuations about a stable state of forced vibrations\nof a nonlinear mode is double-peaked. The peaks are resolved for sufficiently weak damping. Their occurrence can be understood from the equations of motion for the quadratures of a driven mode (D2) and (D10).\nIn the limit of zero damping and in the absence of noise, the stationary states of the mode in the rotating frame lie at \u2202P g = \u2202Qg = 0 where g = gr and g = gp for the resonant and parametric modulation, respectively. The functions gr, gp are effective Hamiltonians in the rotating frame, and their extrema play the same role in the dynamics as the minima of the Hamiltonian function (P 2/2M)+U(Q) of a classical particle with coordinate Q and momentum P in a potential U(Q), except that gr, gp do not have the form of a sum of the kinetic and potential energies. An important characteristic of the motion near an extremum of gr, gp is the frequency\n\u03c9rot = (\u2202 2 P g\u2202 2 Qg) 1/2. (D15)\nFor a particle with the Hamiltonian (P 2/2M)+U(Q) this expression goes into the familiar expression for the vibration frequency near a potential minimum (\u22022QU/M)\n1/2. In the presence of weak damping and weak noise, after a transient the periodically driven mode approaches one of the stable states, depending on where it was initially prepared (the stable states are slightly shifted from the extrema of gr, gp for weak damping). This is again similar to a particle in a potential well, including the case of a double-well potential. The mode then fluctuates about this state for a long time compared to the relaxation time \u223c 1/\u0393 (see Section VII D). These fluctuations correspond to random vibrations of Q(t) and P (t) at frequency \u03c9rot, as seen by linearizing Eqs. (D2) and (D10) about a stable state. Again, the random vibrations of Q(t), P (t) are similar to thermal vibrations of a particle in a potential well. However, they occur in the rotating frame.\nAs seen from Eqs. (D1) and (D9), vibrations of Q,P modulate the forced vibrations of the coordinate and momentum of the driven mode in the laboratory frame q(t), p(t). Therefore the power spectrum of fluctuations of the mode measured in the laboratory frame has peaks at frequencies \u03c9F \u00b1\u03c9rot or (\u03c9p/2)\u00b1\u03c9rot for resonant and parametric modulation, respectively [460, 491, 618].\nOn the experimental side, the double-peak spectrum of fluctuations about a stable vibrational state of a resonantly driven MEMS was observed by Stambaugh and Chan [492], but in this experiment the spectral peaks significantly overlapped. In the experiment [459] the damping was small and the peaks were well-resolved.\nAs seen from Fig. 33(b) and (e), the orbits of motion on the (Q,P )-plane with a given g are strongly non-circular both for resonant and parametric driving. Therefore the variances of the quadratures Q and P are different, which means squeezing. If we disregard dissipation,\n\u3008(\u03b4Q)2\u3009 = kBT 2M\u03c920 (1 + e\u22124\u03d5\u2217), \u3008P 2\u3009 = kBT 2M\u03c920 (1 + e4\u03d5\u2217), exp(2\u03d5\u2217) = |\u22022Qg|1/2/|\u22022P g|1/2. (D16)\n60\nHere \u03b4Q = Q \u2212 Q0, where Q0 is the value of Q at the considered extremum of g, and the second derivatives of g are calculated at the extremum, with g being gr or gp for the resonant and parametric modulation, respectively.\nAlong with the squeezing comes the difference in the areas of the spectral peaks at the frequencies \u03c9F + \u03c9rot and \u03c9F \u2212\u03c9rot for a resonantly driven mode, as well as the peaks at 12\u03c9p + \u03c9rot and 1 2\u03c9p \u2212 \u03c9rot for a parametrically modulated mode. The difference in the areas is directly related to the squeezing parameter [459, 461]. The ratio Rpeaks of the areas of the peaks is\nRpeak = tanh 2 \u03d5\u2217.\nDepending on the parameters and on whether the mode is in the larger- or smaller-amplitude state, for resonant driving, the larger-area peak is on the higher or lowerfrequency side of \u03c9F or \u03c9p/2.\nThe expression for Rpeak applies also to the ratio of the areas of the peaks in the imaginary parts of the susceptibility of a strongly driven strongly underdamped mode. Such susceptibility describes the response to a weak probe force at frequency \u03c9pr close to resonance. The peak that corresponds to resonant amplification of the force always has a smaller area than the one that corresponds to the absorption. We note that the expression for the ratio of the areas of the susceptibility peaks applies also in the quantum regime."

            "text": "The spectra of nonlinear modes (oscillators) are determined by two processes. One is decay of the vibration amplitude. Such decay makes the vibrations nonsinusoidal and thus leads to a frequency \u201cuncertainty\u201d and to a spectral broadening. The other is frequency fluctuations. Here we will consider the frequency fluctuations that come from the interplay of the dependence of the vibration frequency on the amplitude and the amplitude fluctuations due to thermal noise or a broad-band noise from other sources. The two mechanisms of the spectral broadening are not simply superposed, but compete, in some sense, because the decay rate of the amplitude \u0393 is also the reciprocal correlation time of the frequency fluctuations, as explained in Sec. VI C. Therefore the shape of the spectrum is determined by the ratio of the fluctuational frequency spread \u03b4\u03c90 to \u0393.\nThe broadening of the spectrum of an oscillator due to the nonlinearity was first discussed for a quantum oscillator [384]. The analysis was done for the limiting cases \u03b4\u03c90 \u0393 and \u0393 \u2192 0. A complete solution of the problem that showed the evolution of the spectrum with the varying \u03b4\u03c90/\u0393 was obtained first in the classical theory [385] and then in the quantum theory [386]. It described the interplay of the nonlinearity and decay and offered an insight into the paradox of the harmonic oscillator (see below).\nIn the quantum analysis, it is necessary to take into consideration that the energy levels of a nonlinear oscillator are nonequidistant. In the Duffing model (46), the energy of a kth level is\nEk = ~k[\u03c90 + V0(k + 1)/2], V0 = 3~\u03b3/4M\u03c920 ,\nfor |V0|k \u03c90. The transition frequencies (Ek\u2212Ek\u22121)/~ are shown in Fig. 34. They depend on the level number k, that is, on the energy Ek. This is the quantum analog of the energy dependence of the oscillator vibration frequency in the classical limit. The parameter V0 is proportional to the Duffing nonlinearity parameter \u03b3. It is the discreteness of the transition frequencies that determines the quantum effects of the nonlinearity on the susceptibility and the power spectrum.\nSo far, in nanomechanical systems studied in the quantum regime [29, 149\u2013152, 165, 231, 619], including the systems studied in quantum optomechanics [7, 164, 613, 620], the Duffing nonlinearity |V0| was small compared to the decay rate \u0393. This impeded an observation of quantum effects of this nonlinearity in the spectra. However, quantum effects can be pronounced for electromagnetic modes in nonlinear microwave cavities and for Josephson junction based systems, cf. [621, 622]. They underlie the operation of the transmon qubit [623], which is the basic element of the nowadays superconducting quantum computers.\nA quantum picture of the nonlinearity-induced spectral change is in some sense more intuitive than the classical, and the classical results follow from the quantum results as a limiting case. Therefore we present this picture first."

Each such system makes a partial contribution to the resonant susceptibility, which is described by a function \u03c6(k, \u03c9). The overall susceptibility of the oscillator can be then sought in the form of a sum of such partial susceptibilities,\n\u03c7(\u03c9) = (2M\u03c90) \u22121\u2211\nk=1\n\u03c6(k, \u03c9). (E1)\nOne might further assume that a partial susceptibility \u03c6(k, \u03c9) is given by the familiar expression for the susceptibility of a two-level system [624]\n\u03c6W(k, \u03c9) = k\nn\u0304+ 1 \u03c1k\u22121 \u0393W(k)\u2212 i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 \u2212 V0k) ,\n\u0393W (k) = \u0393[2k(2n\u0304+ 1)\u2212 1]. (E2)\nHere \u03c90 +V0k is the transition frequency of the |k \u2212 1\u3009 \u2192 |k\u3009 transition, as seen from Fig. 34(a). The parameter \u0393W (k) is given by the half-sum of the reciprocal lifetimes of the states |k \u2212 1\u3009 and |k\u3009. In calculating it we used that the reciprocal lifetime of a state |k\u3009 is Wk\u2192k+1 + Wk\u2192k\u22121, where the transition rates Wk\u2192k\u00b11 are given by Eq. (B1), and we also took into account that Wk\u2192k+1/Wk+1\u2192k = n\u0304/(n\u0304 + 1) [the Einstein relation [24]], with n\u0304 = [exp(~\u03c90/kBT ) \u2212 1]\u22121. Further along the lines of the Weisskopf-Wigner theory, in Eq. (E2) the coefficient \u03c1k\u22121 is the population of the state k \u2212 1 from which the system makes a transition, \u03c1k = exp(\u2212~k\u03c90/kBT )/(n\u0304 + 1). The function Im \u03c6W(k, \u03c9) has the familiar form of a Lorentzian centered at the transition frequency \u03c90 + V0k and having halfwidth \u0393W(k).\nAn obvious flaw of this picture, which was noticed already by Weisskopf and Wigner [625], is that it does not describe the susceptibility of a harmonic oscillator in the limit V0 = 0. In this limit the functions Im \u03c6W(k, \u03c9) are Lorentzians centered at the same frequency, but their half-widths \u0393W (k) are different, so that the whole spectrum is not Lorentzian. This has become known as the paradox of the harmonic oscillator [626, 627]. Weisskopf and Wigner [625] studied the effect for a three-state system with equal transition frequencies and showed that, indeed, such a system is not described by a set of two independent two-level systems.\nThe breakdown of the approximation (E2) with decreasing |V0|/\u0393 is a characteristic quantum effect. The transition frequencies \u03c90 + V0k with different k are close to each other, and to distinguish the partial spectra \u03c6W(k, \u03c9) one has to wait for a time t |V0|\u22121. However, because of the coupling to a thermal bath, the oscillator stays in a state k for a time \u223c \u0393\u22121W (k). If this time is less than |V0|\u22121, the partial spectra may not be distinguished.\nThe time \u0393\u22121W (k) can be thought of as the time it takes to \u201cswitch\u201d from one two-level system to another. The switching couples the partial spectra with different k to each other. This coupling is described by a system of linear equations [394], which can be obtained from the quantum master equation for the oscillator density matrix \u03c1 (B4).\nFollowing the standard Kubo formula we relate the susceptibility of the oscillator to the Fourier transform of the correlator \u3008a(t)a\u2020(0)\u3009 = Tr[a exp(\u2212iHt)a\u2020\u03c1full exp(iHt)] where \u03c1full is the density matrix of the system and the bath. Tracing out the bath and switching to the rotating frame, we reduce the trace to that over the states of the oscillator, with the density matrix satisfying Eq. (B4) with the initial condition\n\u03c1(0) = a\u2020 exp(\u2212~\u03c90a\u2020a/kBT )/(n\u0304+ 1).\nThe Fourier transform of the trace over the oscillator states |k\u3009 is a sum over k of the Fourier transforms of the corresponding matrix elements\n\u03c6(k, \u03c9) = \u02c6 \u221e 0 dt exp[i\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)t]k1/2 \u3008k| \u03c1(t) |k \u2212 1\u3009 .\nFrom Eq. (B4) we obtained a system of equations for \u03c6(k, \u03c9). It reads\n[\u0393W (k)\u2212 i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 \u2212 V0k)]\u03c6(k, \u03c9) \u2212 2\u0393k[n\u0304\u03c6(k \u2212 1, \u03c9) + (n\u0304+ 1)\u03c6(k + 1, \u03c9)] = k\u03c1k\u22121/(n\u0304+ 1). (E3)\nIt is seen from this equation that, for |V0| \u0393W (k), the partial spectra \u03c6(k, \u03c9) near their maxima are indeed given by Eq. (E2). However, one can easily check that, for a harmonic oscillator, V0 = 0, the solution is\n\u03c6(k, \u03c9) = k\nn\u0304+ 1 \u03c1k\u22121 \u0393\u2212 i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90) (V0 = 0).\nIn other words, all \u201cpartial spectra\u201d have the same spectral shape, a profound quantum effect. With the account taken of Eq. (E1), this expression gives the familiar expression (5) for the susceptibility of a harmonic oscillator."

The width of the spectrum increases with the increasing \u03b10; we note that \u03b10 \u221d T if the decay rate is independent of temperature. For \u03b10 = 0 the spectrum is Lorentzian, whereas for |\u03b10| 1 the spectrum near the maximum has the form S(\u03c9) \u221d |\u03c9\u2212\u03c90| exp[\u2212(\u03c9\u2212\u03c90)/2\u03b10\u0393] for \u03b10(\u03c9\u2212\u03c90) > 0. The expression for the power spectrum of a classical oscillator that coincides with the presented result was given by Renz [628].\nFor a comparison, we show in Fig. 36 the effect of nonlinear friction on the susceptibility spectrum in the absence of conservative nonlinearity. The spectrum remains symmetric in this case, but is strongly non-Lorentzian. The deviation from the Lorentzian form is a signature of the vibration nonlinearity, while the symmetry of the spectrum enables distinguishing the effects of conservative and dissipative nonlinearity.\nAn interesting behavior occurs where the number of\nthe modes N dispersively coupled to the considered mode is large even though the coupling to each mode is small. One would expect some kind of the central limit theorem to apply in this case, leading to a Gaussian power spectrum S(\u03c9) [365]. This is indeed the case [414]. A Gaussian spectrum emerges if |\u03b1n| 1 for all n, but\u2211 n \u03b1 2 n 1 and \u2211 n \u03b1 2 n\u0393 2 n \u03932m(\u2200m).

Such coupling occurs in different types of systems. Besides various vibrational systems, like Josephson junctions, microwave cavities, and NVSs, examples range from the cyclotron resonance in semiconductors to electron spin resonance in strong magnetic fields in systems with S > 1/2. The coupling of transitions is important also for classical vibrational systems with fluctuating frequency. An example is provided by nano- and micromechanical resonators with a fluctuating number and/or positions of attached molecules [201, 629]. The spectra of such systems can also be asymmetric and display a fine structure [189]. On the formal side, for different physical mechanisms the full spectra can be often described by linear equations for coupled partial spectra. These equations are convenient for a numerical analysis."

As indicated above, this method is similar to the rotating wave approximation (RWA), and it is used throughout the present paper. However, we have to indicate that it may become inapplicable even where the nonlinearity is still comparatively weak, that is, the nonparabolic in q terms in the potential energy of a vibrational mode U(q) are still small compared to M\u03c920q\n2/2. A simple example is provided by a mode with a broken inversion symmetry. In this case, in the nonlinear part of the potential one has to keep the cubic in q term,\nU(q) = 1\n2 M\u03c920q\n2 + 1\n3 M\u03b2q3 +\n1 4 M\u03b3q4\n[cf. also Eq. (50)]. Such modes have been extensively studied in the literature, see [41, 86, 327, 353, 355, 361, 362]. In fact the lack of inversion symmetry is fairly generic for flexural nanomechanical modes, as it comes, for example, whenever a gate voltage is applied and a nanoresonator is bent or just from the capacitive part of the potential energy \u221d (\u22023Cg/\u2202q3)(V DCg )2, cf. Eq. (9).\nCubic nonlinearity leads to several effects, including vibrations at the second overtone of the eigenfrequency,\n64\ni.e., at the frequency \u2248 2\u03c90, and the change of the dependence of the vibrations frequency on the amplitude. In the RWA, the latter is described by the renormalization of the Duffing parameter [430]\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3eff = \u03b3 \u2212 10\u03b22\n9\u03c920 (F1)\n(see [355, 361] for some other effects). It is immediately seen from Eq. (F1) that the term \u221d \u03b22 can significantly change the character of the amplitude dependence of the mode frequency (48). Indeed, if \u03b3 > 0, but \u03b3eff < 0, even the sign of the slope d\u03c9/dA 2 of the frequency dependence on the amplitude changes. However, it is clear that for large amplitudes the term \u221d q4 in U(q) becomes more important than the term \u221d q3. Simple dimensional arguments show that for the amplitudes A2 & \u03c920\u03b3eff/\u03b3\n2, the RWA approximation (F1) becomes inapplicable. For small \u03b3eff/\u03b3 this happens where the nonlinear part of the energy \u223c M\u03b3A4 is still small compared to the harmonic part \u223c M\u03c920A2. Therefore it is necessary to find an alternative approach that would not rely on the RWA.\nThe analysis of the mode dynamics beyond the RWA is simplified in the case of weak damping, where the decay rate \u0393 \u03c90. Here it is convenient to use the method of averaging in the form developed in the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems [350]. In this method one changes from the coordinate and momentum of the mode to its action-angle variables. This is a canonical transformation of variables. The coordinate and momentum are functions of the action I and the phase (angle) \u03d5 and are periodic in \u03d5,\nq(I, \u03d5+ 2\u03c0) = q(I, \u03d5), p(I, \u03d5+ 2\u03c0) = p(I, \u03d5).\nThe action and phase variables of the Hamiltonian system are defined as\nI = (2\u03c0)\u22121 \u02db p dq, \u03d5 = \u2202\n\u2202I\n\u02c6 p dq\n[430]. The vibration frequency of the mode is a function of I or, equivalently, of the mode energy E,\n\u03c9(I) = (\u2202I/\u2202E)\u22121,\nand \u03c9(I)\u2202\u03d5q = p/M , whereas \u03c9(I)\u2202\u03d5p = \u2212\u2202qU(q). To describe the mode dynamics in the presence of a friction force \u22122\u0393p and a driving force F cos\u03c9F t, one can change from the variables (q, p) to (I, \u03d5). The resulting equations for I and \u03d5 read\nI\u0307 = R\u2202\u03d5q, \u03d5\u0307 = \u03c9(I)\u2212R\u2202Iq, R = \u22122\u0393p+ F cos\u03c9F t. (F2)\nThe key observation that underlies the averaging principle is that the action varies in time only because of the friction and the driving, which are assumed small. In contrast, the phase accumulates at frequency \u03c9(I),\nwhich is assumed large. Therefore the time evolution of q and p is fast oscillations with a slowly varying in time action I. The contribution of fast oscillations to I\u0307 does not accumulate in time. Therefore on the time scale large compared to \u03c9\u22121F , \u03c9\n\u22121(I) the motion can be described by averaging over the fast oscillations for a given action.\nThe effect of the driving is most pronounced (see Appendix D 1) where the driving is resonant. This means that the vibrations occur at frequencies \u03c9(I) close to \u03c9F , that is, |\u03c9(I) \u2212 \u03c9F | \u03c9F (the analysis of parametric driving can be done similarly). It is then convenient to write\n\u03d5 = \u03c9F t+ \u03d50(t), \u03d5\u03070 = \u03c9(I)\u2212 \u03c9F \u2212R\u2202Iq. (F3)\nThe phase \u03d50 is also a slow variable. For a given \u03d50 the functions q(I, \u03d5), p(I, \u03d5) are periodic in \u03c9F t.\nIt follows from the above arguments that the equations for I, \u03d50 can be obtained by averaging the full equations (F2) over fast oscillations,\nI\u0307 = R\u2202\u03d5q, \u03d5\u03070 = \u03c9(I)\u2212 \u03c9F \u2212R\u2202Iq. (F4)\nHere\nL(I, \u03d5) = (2\u03c0)\u22121 \u02c6 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8L(I, \u03b8 + \u03d50)\nwhere L is an arbitrary function of I, \u03d5, which is periodic in \u03d5 (in R we replace F cos\u03c9F t with F cos \u03b8; in fact the averaging is done over the period 2\u03c0/\u03c9F for fixed I, \u03d50).\nStationary states of forced vibrations are given by Eq. (F4) in which one sets I\u0307 = \u03d5\u03070 = 0. One can see, in particular, that in the case of a comparatively weak Duffing nonlinearity the resulting equations give the same result for the vibration amplitude and phase as Eqs. (D2) and (D3) or, equivalently, Eq. (60). However, the method allows one to go beyond the weak-nonlinearity limit and study effects that are not described by the RWA, cf. [361\u2013 363, 532, 630, 631]. We note that if the involved characteristic frequencies \u03c9(I) become significantly different from \u03c90, the approximation of the frequency-independent coefficients of linear and nonlinear friction may become inapplicable. A more general approach to describing dissipation may be necessary in this case."

            "text": "In this section we consider the mechanisms of Akhiezer and thermoelastic relaxation of NVS modes. These mechanisms have common origin and can be described within the same general framework, as indicated in Sec. IV. In both mechanisms, relaxation comes from inelastic scattering of thermal phonons off the lowfrequency NVS mode. The process is sketched in Fig. 37. The mechanisms are particularly important if the mode eigenfrequency \u03c90 is small compared to the temperature in frequency units, ~\u03c90 kBT . To find the mode decay rate \u0393 in this case it is usually necessary to take into\n65\nconsideration that thermal phonons are scattered off each other, and their scattering rate can be comparable to \u03c90.\nThe coupling Hamiltonian that describes the scattering of thermal phonons off the low-frequency NVS mode has the form\nHi = qh scatt b , h scatt b = \u2211 \u03ba,\u03ba\u2032 \u2032 V\u03ba\u03ba\u2032b \u2020 \u03bab\u03ba\u2032 , (G1)\nwhere b\u03ba and b \u2020 \u03ba are annihilation and creation operators of the vibrational modes coupled to the NVS, cf. Eq. (34). These modes provide a thermal reservoir. We call them phonons and assume that their frequencies \u03c9\u03ba have a (quasi) continuous spectrum.\nIt follows from the results of Sec. IV, see also Eqs. (A9), (A10), that, to the leading order in Hi, the decay rate of the considered low-frequency mode can be expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the operator hscattb . It is convenient to write this expression as\n\u0393 = \u2212 ~ 2MkBT Im \u2211 \u03ba,\u03ba\u2032 V \u2217\u03ba\u2032\u03ba \u02c6 \u221e 0 dtei\u03c90t\u2212\u03b5t\u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032(t),\n\u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032(t) = \u2212i ~ \u2211 \u03ba0,\u03ba\u20320 V\u03ba\u20320\u03ba0\u3008b \u2020 \u03ba(t)b\u03ba\u2032(t)b \u2020 \u03ba\u20320 (0)b\u03ba0(0)\u3009 (G2)\n(\u03b5 \u2192 +0.) Function \u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032(t) is a two-phonon correlation function.\nEquation (G2) immediately gives the Landau-RumerKrivoglaz type result (35), if one disregards the interaction between the high-frequency phonons, in which case \u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032(t) = (\u2212i/~)V\u03ba\u2032\u03ban\u0304(\u03c9\u03ba)[n\u0304(\u03c9\u03ba\u2032) + 1] exp[i(\u03c9\u03ba \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba\u2032)t].\nThe interaction between the phonons can be taken into account by deriving a quantum kinetic equation for \u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 . The modes \u03ba can be well-defined and the calculation can be done in a fairly general case where the resonator is spatially nonuniform, but the nonuniformity is smooth on the wavelength of thermal phonons \u03bbT [280]. This means, for example, that the size of the ripples on a nanomembrane or the scale of nanotube bending or twisting largely exceed \u03bbT .\nHere we will outline the analysis of the phonon-phonon scattering for a simple case where the resonator is spatially uniform. In a uniform system, thermal phonons are\ncharacterized by their wave vector k and the branch \u03b1, i.e., the phonon label \u03ba is \u03ba \u2261 (k, \u03b1); for thin resonators, \u03b1 includes the number of the quantized state of motion in the direction of the confinement. The strain of the considered low-frequency mode varies on the length L that largely exceeds the thermal wavelength of phonons \u03bbT ; for a flexural mode, L is the length of the resonator. Therefore the modes \u03ba and \u03ba\u2032 coupled to it have close wave vector, |k \u2212 k\u2032| |k| \u223c 1/\u03bbT . For thermal modes to resonantly scatter off the low-frequency mode, their frequencies should be also close, |\u03c9\u03ba \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba\u2032 | \u223c \u03c4\u22121\u03ba , \u03c90 \u03c9\u03ba, where \u03c4\u03ba is the relaxation time of mode \u03ba. The conditions on the wave vectors and the mode frequencies are usually met in a sufficiently broad range of k, if the modes \u03ba, \u03ba\u2032 belong to the same branch \u03b1 [the situation may be more complicated in anisotropic systems [632]]; we will consider coupling to the modes of the same branch.\nGiven the difference in the spatial scales L and \u03bbT , it is convenient to switch from \u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 to its Wigner transform. For a spatially uniform system [\u03ba \u2261 (k, \u03b1), \u03ba\u2032 \u2261 (k\u2032\u03b1)] it has the form\n\u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) = V\n(2\u03c0)d\n\u02c6 dk1 dk \u2032 1 e i(k\u20321\u2212k1)r\u03c6(k1\u03b1)(k\u20321\u03b1)(t)\n\u00d7 \u03b4 ( k1 + k \u2032 1\n2 \u2212 k\n) , (G3)\nwhere d is the dimensionality of thermal phonons and V is the volume, area, or length of the resonator, depending on the dimensionality. Function \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) is the twophonon correlation function for the branch \u03b1.\nOne can also introduce the coefficient V\u03b1(r,k), which is given by the same expression as \u03a6\u03b1, except that \u03c6(k1\u03b1)(k\u20321\u03b1)(t) is replaced by V(k\u20321\u03b1)(k1\u03b1). Then the decay rate (G2) can be written as\n\u0393 =\u2212 ~ 2MkBT Im\n\u02c6 dr dk\n(2\u03c0)d \u2211 \u03b1 V \u2217\u03b1 (r,k)\n\u00d7 \u02c6 \u221e\n0\ndt\u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) exp(i\u03c90t\u2212 \u03b5t). (G4)\nThis equation presents the decay rate as an integral of the local (for given r) decay rate \u201cdensity\u201d.\nThe parameters V\u03b1(r,k) take a simple form for the deformation potential coupling of the considered mode to phonons [238]. The deformation potential model assumes that the phonon wavelengths are much smaller than the length over which there varies the mode-induced displacement field q\u03d5(r). In the model the change of the phonon frequency \u03b4\u03c9\u03ba is proportional to the divergence of the displacement field,\n\u03b4\u03c9\u03ba = \u2212\u03c9\u03ba\u03b3(G)\u03ba q\u2207\u03d5(r), (G5)\ncf. Eq. (39). From Eq. (G5) and from Eq. (G3) written for V\u03b1(r,k) we can directly express the coupling parameters in terms of the Gru\u0308neisen parameters \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 ,\nV\u03b1(r,k) = \u2212~\u03c9k\u03b1\u03b3(G)k\u03b1 \u2207\u03d5(r). (G6)\n66\nEquations (G4) and (G6) reduce the problem of finding the decay rate of a low-frequency mode to calculating the correlation function \u03a6\u03b1 of thermal phonons in the Wigner representation. We note that it is not assumed that the mode is described by a plane wave, as in the Akhiezer theory of ultrasound absorption [235]. The general analysis below does not use the model (G5)."

            "text": "Time evolution of the function \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) is determined by phonon-phonon scattering. If the phonon-phonon coupling and the disorder are weak, one can sum the perturbation series for the functions \u03c6\u03ba\u03ba\u2032 [280] and obtain a Markov kinetic equation for \u03a6\u03b1 (strictly speaking, with a renormalized phonon spectrum),\n\u2202t\u03a6\u03b1 + vk\u03b1\u2202r\u03a6\u03b1 = St[\u03a6\u03b1], \u03a6\u03b1 \u2261 \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t). (G7)\nHere vk\u03b1 is the group velocity of the phonon of the branch \u03b1 with the wave vector k and St is the collision integral. The initial condition follows from Eq. (G2),\n\u03a6\u03b1(r,k, 0) = \u2212i~\u22121V\u03b1(r,k)n\u0304k\u03b1(n\u0304k\u03b1 + 1), (G8)\nwhere n\u0304k\u03b1 \u2261 n\u0304(\u03c9k\u03b1) is the phonon thermal occupation number.\nThe typical momentum exchange in a phonon-phonon collision or a collision with a short-range scatterer is \u223c ~/\u03bbT . Therefore the collision rate is independent of r and the collision integral is local,\nSt[\u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t] = V\n(2\u03c0)d \u2211 \u03b10 \u02c6 dk0L k0\u03b10 k\u03b1 \u03a6\u03b10(r,k0, t).\n(G9)\nFor phonon-phonon scattering, the coefficients Lk0\u03b10k\u03b1 are quadratic in the parameters of the cubic anharmonicity V\u03ba1\u03ba2\u03ba3 introduced in Eq. (36); they are real and are given by the expression for \u039b\u0303k0\u03b10k\u03b1 in [280]. The locality of the collision integral holds also in the presence of a smooth disorder, where thermal phonons are no longer plane waves.\nThe analysis of the dynamics of thermal phonons and ultimately of the decay of the low-frequency mode can be conveniently done in terms of the right and left eigenmodes of the collision integral \u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1) and \u03a8\u03bd(k, \u03b1),\nSt[\u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1)] = \u2212\u03b5\u03bd\u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1), [V/(2\u03c0)d] \u2211 \u03b1 \u02c6 dk\u03a8\u03bd\u2032(k, \u03b1)\u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1) = \u03b4\u03bd,\u03bd\u2032 . (G10)\nSince the coefficients Lk0\u03b10k\u03b1 are real, the functions \u03c8\u03bd ,\u03a8\u03bd and the eigenvalues \u03b5\u03bd are real or form complex-conjugate pairs, with Re \u03b5\u03bd \u2265 0. The real parts of the eigenvalues determine the decay rates of the two-phonon correlation functions. The zeroth eigenvalue, \u03bd = 0, is \u03b50 = 0. It\ncorresponds to the stationary value of the two-phonon correlator,\n\u03c80(k, \u03b1) = ~\u03c9k\u03b1n\u0304k\u03b1(n\u0304k\u03b1 + 1), \u03a80(k, \u03b1) = ~\u03c9k\u03b1\nkBT 2C\u03c1V .\nThe eigenfunctions and eigenvalues with \u03bd > 0 can be found using the explicit form of the collision operator.\nExcept for special fine-tuned cases, the eigenfunctions \u03c8\u03bd form a complete set. One can then seek the solution of the kinetic equation in the form\n\u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) = \u2211 \u03bd T\u03bd(r, t)\u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1). (G11)\nFunctions T\u03bd describe the spatial structure of the correlator \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t). The equation for these functions reads\n\u2202tT\u03bd(r, t) + \u2211 \u03bd\u2032 v\u03bd\u03bd\u2032\u2202rT\u03bd\u2032(r, t) = \u2212\u03b5\u03bdT\u03bd(r, t), v\u03bd\u03bd\u2032 = V\n(2\u03c0)d \u2211 \u03b1 \u02c6 dk\u03a8\u03bd(k, \u03b1)vk\u03b1\u03c8\u03bd\u2032(k, \u03b1). (G12)\nWe will outline the solution of this equation in the limiting cases of the thermoelastic and Akhiezer relaxation.\na. Thermoelastic relaxation\nThe decay rate \u0393 of the low-frequency mode is determined by the evolution of \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) on the time scale . \u03c9\u221210 , as seen from Eq. (G4). We will start with the case where \u03c9\u221210 is large compared to the relaxation time of thermal phonons \u03c4ph = max[Re \u03b5 \u22121 \u03bd>0]. As seen from Eq. (G12), \u03c4ph determines the long-time decay of the functions T\u03bd>0. The decay of T0 can be still slower, and this is the case we now consider.\nThe slow evolution of T0(r, t) can be described in the adiabatic approximation in which the functions T\u03bd>0 adiabatically follow T0. Then T\u03bd(r, t) \u2248 \u2212\u03b5\u22121\u03bd v\u03bd0\u2202rT0(r, t) for \u03bd > 0 and t \u03c4ph. Equation (G12) for T0 then takes the form\n\u2202tT0(r, t) = \u2211 ij Dij\u2202ri\u2202rjT0(r, t),\nDij = \u2211 \u03bd>0 (v0\u03bd)i(v\u03bd0))j/\u03b5\u03bd . (G13)\nUsing the explicit form of \u03a6\u03b1(r,k, t) and \u03c80(k, \u03b1) one can show that iT0(r, t) can be interpreted as the scaled coordinate-dependent increment of the temperature of high-frequency phonons compared to the ambient temperature. Respectively, Eq. (G13) has the form of the standard equation of thermal diffusion. Using the completeness of the set of the eigenfunctions \u03c8\u03bd , one can further show that the expression for Dij coincides with the standard expression [463] for thermal diffusivity. In an isotropic medium Dij = D\u03b4ij ; in terms of the thermal conductivity and the specific heat, D = \u03baT /C\u03c1.\n67\nThe boundary conditions for the function T0(r, t) follow from its proportionality to the temperature increment. At a free side of a nanoresonator there is no heat flux in the direction n\u0302 normal to the side, and then (n\u0302\u2202rT0) = 0. Such boundary condition on the temperature increment was used in the analysis of thermoelastic relaxation by Lifshitz and Roukes [286]. On the other hand, at the surfaces where the resonator is clamped the temperature may be equal to the ambient temperature, and then T0 = 0 (but the clamping area can also have a thermal contact resistance).\nA convenient strategy is to find the eigenvalues \u00b5n and eigenfunctions T0n(r) of the diffusion equation (G13), express T0(r, t) as a sum of T0n exp(\u2212\u00b5nt), and then find the decay rate of the low frequency mode from Eq. (G4) and Eq. (G11) in which we keep only the term with \u03bd = 0 [280]. We illustrate this strategy for an important type of NVSs [285\u2013287], a long and thin rectangular nanobeam. We assume that the beam is clamped at x = 0 and x = L, has width W in the y-direction and thickness l\u22a5 in the z-direction, with the length L W, l\u22a5 and with W, l\u22a5 lT . The beam bends in the z-direction. Therefore the temperature is nonuniform in the z-direction, but it can be uniform in the y-direction. Since l\u22a5 L, the low-lying eigenvalues of the diffusion equation (G13) correspond to the eigenmode \u221d sin(\u03c0z/l\u22a5). If we choose T0 = 0 at x = 0 and x = L, the eigenmodes of Eq. (G13)\nare T0n(r) = (2/ \u221a V ) sin(\u03c0z/l\u22a5) sin(n\u03c0x/L), and the corresponding eigenvalues are \u00b5n = \u03c0 2D(l\u22122\u22a5 + n\n2L\u22122). For small n, where the term \u221d L\u22122 in \u00b5n can be disregarded, \u00b5n \u2248 \u03c4\u22121Z = D(\u03c0/l\u22a5)2. This expression coincides with the Zener relaxation rate \u03c4\u22121Z used in the equation for the thermoelastic decay rate (38).\nThe phenomenological analysis of the thermoelastic relaxation corresponds to the assumption that the Gru\u0308neisen parameter is the same for all phonons, \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 \u2261 \u03b3(G) = E\u03b1T /C\u03c1(1\u22122\u03bdP), where \u03b1T is the linear thermal expansion coefficient and \u03bdP is the Poisson ratio. Then from Eqs. (G6), (G8), and (G11), with the account taken of the explicit form of \u03c80(k, \u03b1), we have\nT0(r, 0) = i~\u22121\u03b3(G)\u2207\u03d5.\nTo find T0(r, t) one should expand T0(r, 0) in the eigenmodes T0n(r). Then integration over time in Eq. (G4) gives the decay rate \u0393 of the NVS mode in the form\n\u0393 = E2\u03b12TT 2MC\u03c1(1\u2212 2\u03bdP)2 \u2211 n \u00b5\u22121n 1 + (\u03c90/\u00b5n)2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u02c6 dr\u2207\u03d5T0n(r)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 . (G14)\nThe eigenfunctions of the thermal diffusion equation were also used by Zener [285] in the analysis of the Q-factor of the beam vibrations based on the coupled equations of motion of a slow mode and temperature. These equations were derived from thermodynamic arguments and only diffusion transverse to the beam was considered.\nFor a flexural mode we have\n\u2207\u03d5 = \u2212(1\u2212 2\u03bdP)L1/2z\u22022x\u03b6 ( \u02c6 \u03b62dx)\u22121/2,\nwhere \u03b6(x) is the displacement of the central plane in the z-direction [287]. Using the explicit form of \u03b6(x) for the lowest flexural mode and the expression for the mode eigenfrequency \u03c90 \u2248 6.5(l\u22a5/L2)(E/\u03c1)1/2, and setting \u00b5n \u2248 \u00b50, from Eq. (G14) we obtain\n\u0393 = \u0393TER \u2248 0.98E\u03b1 2 TT\u03c90\n2C\u03c1 \u03c90\u03c4Z 1 + (\u03c90\u03c4Z)2 , (G15)\nwhich essentially coincides with Eq. (38). We note that it is necessary to keep several terms in the sum over the eigenmodes T0n in Eq. (G14) [Eq. (G15) includes the whole sum]. If the aspect ratio L/l\u22a5 is not very large, one should take into account the dependence of the relaxation times of the thermal modes \u00b5\u22121n on the mode number. The described method applies to any geometry. It also allows taking into account the difference between the values of the Gru\u0308neisen parameter for different phonons, and moreover, going beyond the deformation potential approximation (G5) all together.\nb. Akhiezer relaxation\nWhen the mode eigenfrequency significantly exceeds the rate of thermal diffusion, \u03c90 \u03c4\u22121Z , one should take into account a finite time it takes for the phonons to locally equilibrate. The corresponding mechanism is the extension to a resonator mode of the Aihezer mechanism of decay of ultrasound [235].\nIn terms of the formalism described here, the Akhiezer damping is determined by the evolution of the function T\u03bd(r, t) over the phonon relaxation time \u03c4ph \u03c4Z . On this time scale one can disregard the drift term in Eq. (G12). Indeed, this term comes from the spatial nonuniformity of the phonon distribution. The characteristic scale of the nonuniformity is the size of the system, which largely exceeds the phonon mean free path \u223c vph\u03c4ph (vph is the characteristic phonon velocity), so that |vph\u2202rT\u03bd | |T\u03bd |/\u03c4ph. Then the functions T\u03bd(r, t) exponentially decay in time as exp(\u2212\u03b5\u03bdt) for \u03bd > 0.\nFrom Eqs. (G4) and (G11), the Akhiezer decay rate of the considered low-frequency mode \u0393 \u2261 \u0393Akh is\n\u0393Akh = 1\n2MkBT\nV (2\u03c0)2d Re \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 \u02c6 drdkdk\u2032 V \u2217\u03b1 (r,k)\n\u00d7 \u2211 \u03bd>0 \u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1)\u03a8\u03bd(k \u2032, \u03b1\u2032) \u03bd \u2212 i\u03c90 V\u03b1\u2032(r,k \u2032)n\u0304k\u2032\u03b1\u2032(n\u0304k\u2032\u03b1\u2032 + 1).\n(G16)\nThe term \u03bd = 0, which describes thermal diffusion, does not contribute to the Akhiezer relaxation.\nIn deriving Eq. (G16) no assumptions have been made about the structure of the considered low-frequency mode\n68\nand the symmetry of the medium. It is important, though, that if we describe the coupling to phonons by the deformation potential (G6) and assume that the coupling parameters \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 are the same for all phonons, it follows from Eq. (G10) that \u0393Akh = 0. This means that to describe the Akhiezer relaxation it is necessary to allow for the dependence of \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 on the phonon quantum numbers k, \u03b1. In the analysis of the Akhiezer relaxation the phonon decay rates Re \u03b5\u03bd are often replaced by a characteristic parameter \u03c4\u22121ph , see [279, 291] and references therein. In this approximation we can simplify Eq. (G16) using the completeness of the eigenfunctions \u03c8\u03bd , \u2211 \u03bd>0 \u03c8\u03bd(k, \u03b1)\u03a8\u03bd(k\n\u2032, \u03b1\u2032) = [(2\u03c0)d/V]\u03b4(k\u2212 k\u2032)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c80(k, \u03b1)\u03a80(k\n\u2032, \u03b1\u2032). If we denote the averaging over phonons by an overline,\nB\u03b1(r,k) = ~2\n(2\u03c0)dC\u03c1kBT 2 \u2211 \u03b1 \u02c6 dkB\u03b1(r,k) \u00d7 \u03c92k\u03b1n\u0304k\u03b1(n\u0304k\u03b1 + 1) (G17)\n[here B\u03b1(r,k) is an arbitrary function of r,k, \u03b1], we can rewrite Eq. (G16) as\n\u0393Akh = q20 ~ C\u03c1T \u03c90\u03c4ph 1 + \u03c920\u03c4 2 ph\n\u00d7 \u02c6 dr [ |v\u03b1(r,k)|2 \u2212 |v\u03b1(r,k)| 2 ]\n(G18)\nwhere v\u03b1(r,k) = V\u03b1(r,k)/~\u03c9k\u03b1 and q0 = (~/2M\u03c90)1/2. Equation (G18) explicitly shows that, to describe the Akhiezer relaxation, one has to take into account the dependence of the parameters \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 on k, \u03b1. From this point of view, it may be more appropriate to interpret the parameter (\u03b3(G))2 in Eq. (40) as the variance rather than the squared mean value of \u03b3 (G) k\u03b1 .\nAn advantageous feature of the presented technique is that it allows one to consider an intermediate parameter range between the limits of the thermoelastic and Akhiezer relaxation. Also, it immediately applies to micro- and nanoresonators of an arbitrary geometry and various boundary conditions."

            "heading": "Appendix H: Allan variance in the limiting cases",
            "text": "As indicated in Sec. IX, a most common way to characterize frequency fluctuations is based on the Allan variance \u03c32A(\u03c4). It is defined in terms of the frequencies f\u0304m measured from the increments of the full vibrational phase \u03d5 over the time intervals (tm, tm + \u03c4) as\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = 1\n2(N \u2212 1)f20 N\u22121\u2211 m=1 (f\u0304m+1 \u2212 f\u0304m)2, (H1)\nwhere f0 is the mean value of f\u0304m, cf. Eq. (70). We recall that \u03d5(t) determines the displacement in the labo-\nratory frame, which is \u221d cos[\u03d5(t)]; it should not be confused with the phase \u03c6(t) in the rotating frame, which is counted off from 2\u03c0f0t;\nIf the dead-time between the successive measurements is zero, tm+1 \u2212 tm = \u03c4 , the Allan variance can be simply expressed in terms of the power spectrum S\u03d5(\u03c9) of the fluctuations of the full vibrational phase,\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = 8\n\u03c0\u03c920\u03c4 2 \u02c6 \u221e 0 d\u03c9 sin4(\u03c9\u03c4/2)S\u03d5(\u03c9). (H2)\nAllan variance is used particularly broadly to characterize noise of self-sustained vibrations in systems with feedback. In such systems the vibration amplitude A is kept almost constant by the feedback loop, but the phase is not fixed (unless the vibrations are synchronized by an external source). Noise causes phase fluctuations, which accumulate in time. If the noise is thermal (thermomechanical), as in the equation of Brownian motion (2) or in Eq. (A9), the phase is diffusing [551]. Then, from the above equations and Eq. (H2), \u03c32A(\u03c4) displays a characteristic dependence on \u03c4 and A,\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = (2\u0393kBT/M\u03c9 4 0A\n2)\u03c4\u22121. (H3)\nIn the range where \u03c4 is small compared to the decay time of the oscillator \u0393\u22121, this expression applies also to a mode driven by a sufficiently strong resonant force F cos\u03c9F t with no feedback loop. For a strong drive the amplitude of forced vibrations largely exceeds the thermal displacement (kBT/M\u03c9 2 0)\n1/2, and thus amplitude fluctuations are relatively small. Fluctuations in this case can be analyzed using the equation of motion for the complex amplitude u(t) of a driven linear mode\nu\u0307 = \u2212[\u0393 + i(\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)]u(t)\u2212 i F\n4M\u03c9F + \u03be(t),\nu(t) = 1\n2M\u03c9F [M\u03c9F q(t)\u2212 ip(t)] exp(\u2212i\u03c9F t), (H4)\nwhere \u03be(t) is thermal noise with the correlator (24), cf. Sec. D 1.\nIn the absence of noise and in the stationary regime, the vibration amplitude is Ast \u2248 2|ust| = (F/2M\u03c9F )[(\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)2 + \u03932]\u22121/2. The vibration phase \u03c6st as counted off from the drive phase is\n\u03c6st = \u2212 1\n2 \u03c0 \u2212 arctan[(\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)/\u0393]. (H5)\nFor weak thermal noise the vibration phase \u03c6(t) = \u03d5(t) \u2212 \u03c9F t fluctuates about \u03c6st. This behavior is very different from the phase diffusion for self-sustained vibrations. Interestingly, it follows from Eq. (H4) that the dependence \u03c32A \u221d \u03c4\u22121 has the same form in the both cases provided \u0393\u03c4 1. It is this characteristic dependence that gives the so-called noise floor for thermal-noise dominated fluctuations in nanomechanical systems, cf. [187, 558, 562, 633] and references therein.\nFor a resonantly driven mode subject to thermal noise and in the absence of a feedback loop, Eq. (H4) allows\n69\none also to find a simple expression for the Allan variance in the opposite limit of a long time \u03c4 , where \u0393\u03c4 1,\n\u03c32A(\u03c4) = (3kBT/M\u03c9 4 0A\n2)\u03c4\u22122 (H6)\nOf significant importance is a different regime where the Allan variance is dominated not by thermal fluctuations of the slow part of the phase, but rather by eigenfrequency fluctuations. These fluctuations often have 1/f - type component (the flicker noise). In this case it follows from Eq. (69) that S\u03d5(\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd\u22123 for small \u03bd. Then from Eq. (H2) \u03c32A \u221d \u03c4\u22124. As mentioned in Sec. IX, the Allan variance does not distinguish between the eigenfrequency fluctuations and the fluctuations of the rotating-frame\nphase \u03c6. A convenient approach to an open-loop measurement of the Allan variance is based on measuring the ratio of the quadrature and in-phase components of the vibrations of a driven mode. This ratio gives tan\u03c6(t). In the measurement, the drive frequency \u03c9F is often chosen maximally close to the measured mode eigenfrequency \u03c9meas0 = 2\u03c0f0. The relation between the phase fluctuation \u2206\u03c6(t) and the fluctuation \u2206\u03c9meas0 in this case can be obtained from Eq. (H5). To do this one should replace \u03c90 in this equation with \u03c9 meas 0 and the stationary phase \u03c6st with the time-dependent phase \u03c6. One then finds \u2206\u03c9meas0 = \u0393\u2206\u03c6. The relation applies in the adiabatic limit, where the change \u2206\u03c6(t) is slow compared to the oscillator relaxation time \u0393\u22121.\n[1] A. N. Cleland and M. L.
