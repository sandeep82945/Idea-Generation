1. **Investigate the impact of time-varying parameters on the stability of the system.** The model presented in the paper assumes that the parameters of the system, such as the asset prices and the failure costs, are constant. However, in reality, these parameters are likely to vary over time. It would be interesting to investigate how these time-varying parameters affect the stability of the system and the propagation of failures.
2. **Develop a more realistic model of the financial system.** The model presented in the paper is a simplified representation of the financial system. It would be interesting to develop a more realistic model that takes into account additional factors, such as the interconnectedness of the financial system, the role of central banks, and the impact of government policies.
3. **Investigate the effectiveness of different intervention strategies.** The paper proposes a number of intervention strategies that can be used to mitigate the propagation of failures in the financial system. It would be interesting to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies in different scenarios and to develop new and more effective intervention strategies.
4. **Apply the model to real-world data.** The model presented in the paper has been tested on simulated data. It would be interesting to apply the model to real-world data to see how well it can predict the propagation of failures in the financial system.
5. **Develop a computational tool to help policymakers design intervention strategies.** The model presented in the paper can be used to design intervention strategies to mitigate the propagation of failures in the financial system. It would be interesting to develop a computational tool that can help policymakers design these strategies.
