1. **Investigate the effect of different ionic liquids on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the ionic liquid, but other ionic liquids may have different effects on the reaction. For example, ionic liquids with different anions or cations may have different effects on the stability of the CO2 adduct or the kinetics of the reaction.


2. **Explore the use of different metal porphyrins as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used cobalt porphyrin as the catalyst, but other metal porphyrins may have different activities and selectivities for the reaction. For example, iron porphyrins or nickel porphyrins may be more active or selective for the production of CO or other products.


3. **Investigate the effect of different reaction conditions on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study was conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, but other reaction conditions may be more favorable for the reaction. For example, higher temperatures or pressures may increase the rate of the reaction or the yield of the desired products.


4. **Develop new in-situ characterization techniques to study the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used in-situ SERS to study the reaction, but other techniques may provide additional information about the reaction mechanism or the intermediates involved. For example, in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy or in-situ mass spectrometry could be used to study the reaction.


5. **Design and develop new electrochemical cells for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used a conventional three-electrode cell, but other cell designs may be more efficient or practical for the reaction. For example, flow cells or membrane-electrode assemblies could be used to improve the mass transfer of CO2 to the catalyst surface or to separate the products from the reactants.
