    "abstractText": "Cook et al. (Oper Res 61(3):666\u2013676, 2013) propose a DEA-based model for the performance evaluation of non-homogeneous decision making units (DMUs) based on constant returns to scale (CRS), extended by Li et al. (Health Care Manag Sci 22(2):215\u2013228, 2019) to variable returns to scale (VRS). This paper locates these models into more general DDF models to deal with nonhomogeneous DMUs and applies these to Hong Kong hospitals. The production process of each hospital is divided into subunits which have the same inputs and outputs and hospital performance is measured using the subunits. The paper provides CRS and VRS versions of DDF models and compares them with Cook et al. (Oper Res 61(3):666\u2013676, 2013) and Li et al. (Health Care Manag Sci 22(2):215\u2013228, 2019). A kernel-based method is used to estimate the distributions as well as a DEA-based efficiency analysis adapted by Simar and Zelenyuk to test the distributions. Both DDF CRS and VRS versions produce results similar to Cook et al. (Oper Res 61(3):666\u2013676, 2013) and Li et al. (Health Care Manag Sci 22(2):215\u2013228, 2019) respectively. However, the statistical tests find differences for the different technologies assumed as would be expected. For hospital managers, the more generalised DDF models expand their range of options in terms of directional improvements and priorities as well as dealing with non-homogeneity.",

            "text": "Hospitals are supposed to be alike, but in fact may not be similar due to the different processes involved. For instance, most tertiary hospitals provide emergency services rather than community services, and most primary care facilities provide community services rather than emergency services. Data Envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric approach to gauge the relative efficiencies of decision making units (DMUs) [1], which is widely used in healthcare performance measurement. However, in conventional DEA, DMUs exhibit homogeneity, with the same type of inputs and outputs (in differing amounts). Golany and Roll [2] believe that when using DEA to measure performance of DMUs, DMUs must satisfy homogeneity, that is, they have the same goal or task, the same external environment, and the same input and output variables and dimensions. Zhang et\u00a0al. [3] set rigorous exclusion criteria to screen homogeneous hospitals for DEA evaluation, which demonstrated that non-homogeneity was a factor contributing to hospital efficiency.\nNon-homogeneity among DMUs arises from differences in the external environment and internal conditions.

[4] suggest that non-homogeneity among DMUs stems from their environment and economies of scale. Some examples of non-homogeneity include Castelli et\u00a0al. [5] subunits with interdependent DMUs which did not have the same inputs and outputs; Haas and Murphy [6] DMUs with different business processes, input / output sets, and environments; Saen et\u00a0al. [7] DMUs where the inputs and outputs were not completely identical because of functional discrepancies. Non-homogeneity also occurs as noted by Thompson et\u00a0al. [8] where outputs not produced are replaced by zeros and obviously, there will be no inputs involved for these outputs.\nVarious methods have been proposed to address nonhomogeneity. Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Imanirad et\u00a0al. [10] proposed corresponding solutions for different outputs and inputs, by grouping DMUs, decomposing their inputs/outputs, and evaluating their efficiency with the same inputs/ outputs. Li et\u00a0al. [11] proposed an approach for processing heterogeneous DMUs with different input configurations. Du et\u00a0al. [12] constructed a non-homogeneous parallel network structure model considering DMUs with different outputs. Barat et\u00a0al. [13] developed a network DEA-based method to address the problem of non-homogeneity in settings where subunits operate in a mixed network structure. Li et\u00a0al. [14] and Lin et\u00a0al. [15] extend the work of Cook et\u00a0al. [9] from a constant returns-to-scale (CRS) version to a variable returnsto-scale (VRS) to measure the efficiencies of non-homogeneous hospitals. In another study with different inputs and different outputs, Wu et\u00a0al. [16] split the inputs and assign them to each output, and similarly split outputs and assign them to each input, and then present a DEA model that places DMUs into homogeneous subgroups, calculates each subgroup\u2019s overall efficiency in, and applies it to evaluate the environmental efficiency among industries in China. In an application to a university in China, Ding et\u00a0al. [17] split each DMU into subgroups with homogeneous inputs and outputs, in a two-stage network structure for faculty research processes and student research processes. Chen and Wang [18] define the inclusion relationship of the production structure of nonhomogeneous DMUs and constructed the DEA cross-efficiency model for them by integrating the perspectives of self-evaluation and peer-evaluation.\nHowever, in a non-homogenous environment, hospital managers need not only to select the direction of performance improvement, but also to determine the priority of improvement. Various studies have used nonradial models to address this. F\u00e4re and Lovell [19] specify an LP (linear programming) model to measure non-radial Pareto-Koopman efficiency. The LP of directional distance function (DDF) is first set out by Shepherd [20] and introduced by Luenberger [21, 22] as a shortage function, which considers that inefficiency can be measured by the distance from the observed DMU to the production possibility frontier (PPF). F\u00e4re et\u00a0al. [23] developed an input distance function, though the\nmodel assumed that all inputs scaling pro-rate were similar to the Farrell efficiency measure. Chung and F\u00e4re [24], Chambers et\u00a0al. [25] made important contributions to the theoretical development and defined the basic properties of the directional distance function. The directional distance function has been increasingly used for efficiency evaluation over the last twenty years [26]. It has the advantage over existing approaches of being a more general model that can provide both radial and non-radial measures and easily accommodates input and output radial DEA models. It can also accommodate both desirable and non-desirable inputs and outputs.\nTo our knowledge, there is no literature to extend DDF models to the non-homogeneity problem in DEA. This study develops DDF-based models for performance evaluation of nonhomogeneous DMUs applying these to Hong Kong hospitals. The CRS and VRS versions of the DDF-based models are compared with Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14] respectively. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section\u00a02 reviews the DEA models with non-homogeneous DMUs proposed by Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14], and presents the CRS and VRS versions of our proposed DDF models for nonhomogeneous DMUs. In Sect.\u00a03, a data set of Hong Kong hospitals illustrates our proposed models to conduct performance evaluation and provide efficiency improvement suggestions, as well as comparing these with Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14] models. The last section discusses the main findings, implications and possible future research directions."

            "text": "For the grouping of non-homogeneous DMUs, it is necessary to divide all DMUs into subgroups with the same kinds of inputs and outputs. Both Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14] assume that all DMUs have the same inputs, and only discuss the case of different outputs. This paper also assumes the DMUs employ co-inputs to produce nonhomogeneous outputs.\nAssume there are n DMUs divided into p mutually exclusive subgroups, where all DMUs within a subgroup contain the same kinds of inputs and outputs while other subgroups contain different kinds of outputs. Table\u00a01 illustrates with eight DMUs, each of which has the same kinds of inputs and at most three kinds of outputs.\nA tick (\u221a) indicates that a DMU has this input or output. These eight DMUs have the same inputs, but produce different outputs. If we classified the DMUs into several subgroups with the same inputs and outputs to make up a production possibility set (PPS), the PPS would contain too few DMUs to calculate the DEA efficiencies. For example, DMUs with the same kinds of inputs and outputs can be\n1 3\nclassified as a subgroup, denoted by L. In Table\u00a01, the eight DMUs are divided into three subgroups, i.e., L1 = {DMU = 1, 2}, L2 = {DMU = 3, 4, 5}, L3 = {DMU = 6, 7, 8}. There are only two or three DMUs in each group.\nFigure\u00a01 depicts a block diagram and steps of performance measurement for non-homogeneous DMU that is decomposed into three stages.\nStage 1: Each output is considered as a subunit, and the outputs and inputs with the same DMUs are merged into a maximum subunit. The inputs are then split for each maximum subunit. In this stage, we need to know the proportions or ratios to split the inputs for each output. Stage 2: Each maximum subunit and inputs make up a production possibility set (PPS), and the efficiency values of DMUs for each maximum subunit under the same PPS are calculated; Stage 3: The DMU efficiency is aggregated by weighting the efficiency values of corresponding maximum subunits.\nIn Fig.\u00a01, a subset with the inputs and the same output is referred to as a subunit, denoted by R. Then the subunits are R1 = {DMU = 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}, R2 = {DMU = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, R3 = {DMU = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. The subunits containing the same elements are combined to constitute a maximal subunit, see Cook et\u00a0al. [9] or Algorithm\u00a0A1 of Appendix in the electronic supplemental material of this paper. In this example, R2 and R3 are merged, i.e. R2\u2019 = {R2, R3}, then the combined maximum subunit is unique, proved in\nreference [9] p.669. We use p for the index of the subgroups, k for the index of maximal subunits. Thus, R1 = {p = 1, 3}, R2\u2019 = {p = 2, 3}, L1 = {k = 1}, L2 = {k = 2\u2019}, L3 = {k = 1, 2\u2019}. For convenience, the notations used in this paper are summarised in Table\u00a02.\nIn discussing efficiency, it is important to define the production possibility set and its efficient frontier, and then to identify the method of measuring the efficiency of inefficient DMUs. Suppose the technology reference set \u03a9 = {(x, y): x can produce y}. There are j = 1, \u2026, J DMUs (i.e., firms or plant) in the dataset, each DMU uses input X = (x1,x2,...,xm )\u2208\u211dm\n+ to jointly produce desirable outputs Y = (y1,y2,...,ys\n) \u2208 \u211ds + .\nIn the context of nonhomogeneous DMU, Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14] developed DEA multiplier models under the CRS and VRS technologies as presented in Eqs.\u00a0(1) and (2), respectively. For the model description, the initials of the author's surname are used for short, namely the Eq.\u00a0(1) is CHIRZ and the Eq.\u00a0(2) is LLM.\n(1)\n[CHIRZ] eo = max \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ko[ukyko\u2215(\n\u2211\ni ikpovixio)]\ns.t. \u2211\nr\u2208Rk uryrj\u2215(\n\u2211\ni ikpvixij) \u2264 1, j \u2208 p, k \u2208 Lp,\u2200p \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ikp = 1,\u2200i, p \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ko = 1\nikp \u2208 [aikp, bikp] vi, uk \u2265 0,\u2200i, k\nEach output with inputs is\nconsidered a subunit, and the subunits with the same DMUs\nare merged into a maximum\nsubunit.

The directional distance function aims to increase (desirable) outputs and decrease inputs in directions specified as follows:\nwhere the nonzero vector g = (-gx, gy) defines the directions in which inputs and outputs are projected.\nWhen \ufffd\ufffd\u20d7D(x, y;g)=0, DMU j is technically efficient and no additional improvements in outputs and inputs are feasible. \ufffd\ufffd\u20d7D(x, y;g)>0 indicates technical inefficiency. There are various options for choosing the direction (gx, gy), as pointed out by F\u00e4re et\u00a0al. [27]. Zofio et\u00a0al. [28] choose a directional vector towards profit maximizing benchmarks, while Lee [29] modify the direction towards marginal profit maximization. Atkinson and Tsionas [30] use Bayesian methods with the first-order conditions for cost minimization and profit maximization to estimate the directional distance function. For the objective function of DDF, Chen [31] summarizes six types from the energy economics literature. Wang et\u00a0al. [26] comprehensively review the selecting techniques of direction for the directional distance function. Equations\u00a0(1) and (2) show both CHIRZ and LLM consume ikpxij produce outputs. We choose the direction as ( gx , gy) = ( ikpoxo , yo ) to compare our results with CHIRZ and LLM.\n(2)\n[LLM] eo = max \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ko\n\ufffd\n(ukyko + o k\n\ufffd\n\u2215( \u2211\ni ikpo vixio)]\ns.t. \u2211\nr\u2208Rk (uryrj + o k )\u2215(\n\u2211\ni ikpvixij) \u2264 1, j \u2208 p, k \u2208 Lp,\u2200p \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ikp = 1,\u2200i, p \u2211\nk\u2208Lp ko = 1\nikp \u2208 [aikp, bikp] vi, ur \u2265 0,\u2200i, k\no k , free\n(3)\ufffd\ufffd\u20d7D(x, y;g) = sup{\ud835\udefd \u2236 (x \u2212 \ud835\udefdgx, y + \ud835\udefdgy) \u2208 \u03a9}\nThe directional distance function model for non-homogeneous DMUs under constant returns to scale (CRS) technology is presented as Eq.\u00a0(4), and variable returns to scale (VRS) technology as Eq.\u00a0(5) [32] (\u201co\u201d for the observed DMU).\nFor ease of description, we call Eqs.

Note that the proportions \u03b1ikp are not the same in different sets for each DMUj and the constraint variables aikp and bikp are used to impose upper and lower limits on the size of the \u03b1ikp variables.\nAssuming \u03b2i denotes the inefficiency of a subunit, and 1-\u03b2i denotes the efficiency of a subunit, 1-\u03b2o denotes the efficiency of a DMU under evaluation, and \u03c9i denotes the weight to aggregate the efficiencies of the subunits.

            "text": "A data set was obtained from the Hospital Authority Annual Report of Hong Kong for the fiscal year 2012\u20132013.1 We chose this data set because it contains one output that all hospitals provide (total patient days) but the other outputs vary in provision across the hospitals in the data set. Thus it is easily seen that these are nonhomogeneous hospitals for the outpatient activities. The outputs show considerable non-homogeneity in outpatients which provides a good test for our DDF models. Note that the available data does not include undesirable outputs which would be a valuable extension to our models.\nLi et\u00a0al. [14] also employed the data set, but they used total length of stay (LOS) rather than total inpatient days as the output. Numerous studies have used total inpatient days as a measure of hospital output rather than the number of cases treated because this is more medically homogeneous (more complex patients require longer hospital stays) [33\u201335]. O'Neill et\u00a0al. used either total inpatient days or inpatient days disaggregated by medical and\nsurgical as outputs categories for a list of studies [36]. The inpatient days are a patient starting when formally admitted to a hospital with a doctor\u2019s order, whereas the length of stay (LOS) is used to judge hospital efficiency and to predict whether the hospital is making money or losing money on different diagnoses, and is defined as whether a patient is considered admitted to the hospital at midnight. LOS is primarily used for a given diagnosisrelated group (DRG) [37] or case-based group [38], the smaller the better.\nHong Kong's hospitals display non-homogeneity in producing different outputs. There are 37 hospitals, all of which consume the same two kinds of inputs, i.e. number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff (I1) and number of beds (I2), and produce at most six outputs, i.e. total inpatient days (O1), total Accident & Emergency attendances (O2), total Specialist Outpatient attendances (O3), family medicine specialist clinic attendances (O4), total allied health outpatient attendance (O5), and general outpatient attendances (O6). All DMUs have total inpatient days (O1), which means they all provide inpatient services. Thirty-five hospitals (95%) have allied health outpatient attendances (O5). Descriptive statistics of the inputs and outputs are summarized in Table\u00a03, including the number in each output. The detailed information is reported in Table\u00a0A1 of the Appendix. In column 7 of Table\u00a03, CV represents the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population. Although the CV of total accident & emergency attendances (O2) is the lowest of these variables, the maximum of that is over 20 times the minimum. The same phenomenon occurred in other variables, indicating large differences in the operational scale in these hospitals, which provides the justification for the use of VRS technology.\nAs described in Algorithm\u00a0A1 of the Appendix, the outputs can be divided into six maximal subunits, with the DMUs classified into eight subgroups as reported in Table\u00a04. Each subunit has a vector for the inputs and the same outputs of that subunit. Rk is defined as the subunit k composed of DMU subgroup sets.

The rest is deduced by analogy.\nIn terms of the DMU subgroups consisting of subunits, the 37 DMUs can be divided into eight subgroups, with each DMU composed of inputs and subunits. Lp is defined as the subgroup p composed of subunit sets. Therefore, in this example, the eight subgroups composed of subunit sets can be expressed as:\nL1 = {k = 1, 5}; L2 = {k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; L3 = {k = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}; L4 = {k = 1, 3, 5, 6}; L5 = {k = 1}; L6 = {k = 1, 3, 5}; L7 = {k = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}; L8 = {k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\nEach subgroup has different subunits, e.g., p = 1 consists of subunits 1 and 5, and p = 6 consists of subunits 1, 3 and 5. Hospitals classified in the same subgroup have similar characteristics. For example, hospitals in subgroup p = 1 are sanatorium and rehabilitation hospitals, those in subgroup p = 2 are large acute general hospitals, those in subgroup p = 4 are community-based health care facilities, those in p = 6 are more specialist hospitals that focus on particular medical fields such as psychiatry, ophthalmology and so on."

            "text": "The proportion of each input assigned to each subunit is used to allocate input for each subunit. Both CHIRZ and LLM provide limits on input proportions. CHIRZ employs assurance regions (AR) while LLM uses an interval number [a, b] to limit the input splitting proportions of each subunit. For simplicity, we directly use Tables\u00a0A2 and A3 of the Appendix to split input 1 (number of FTEs) and input 2 (number of beds) into each subunit, respectively.\nFollowing the methodology in Sect.\u00a03, models (4) and (5) are used to calculate DDF efficiencies under CRS and VRS respectively. The performance of each DMU is the aggregation of the inefficiency scores of subunits by taking a weighted average. The aggregation weights (\u03c9) of subunits to DMUs are provided in Table\u00a0A4 of Appendix.\nThe results of DDF-CRS (4) and DDF-VRS (5) are shown in Tables\u00a05 and 6, respectively. Columns 3\u20138 report the inefficiencies (\u03b2) of subunits, columns 9\u201310 the overall inefficiencies (\u03b2) and overall efficiencies (1-\u03b2) of DMUs, and the last column shows the rankings of DMUs.\nIn Table\u00a05 for the CRS technology, the first ranked is DMU27 of subgroup 2, the second ranked is DMU18 of subgroup 2, and the last ranked is DMU32 of subgroup 6. Although no DMU is completely efficient under the CRS technology, the more subunits are closer to efficient, the\nmore efficient the overall DMU is, e.g., DMU18 and DMU27. DMU18 is efficient in subunits 1, 2, 5 and 6, and almost efficient in subunit 3, but inefficient in subunit 4 (\u03b2 = 0.969), so DMU18 is inefficient overall. Thus, a DMU is efficient overall if and only if all of its subunits are efficient. This suggests that hospital management may need to consider actions to improve the performance of its inefficient subunits. In Table\u00a06 for the VRS technology, two DMUs are efficient overall, namely DMU4 and DMU28. All subunits of these two DMUs are efficient. For example, DMU4 is efficient overall, so it performs efficiently in all of its subunits (k = 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6).\nSubunits and subgroups contain different DMU sets respectively, and it is worthwhile investigating any correlations between them. As DEA is a non-parametric technique, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient may be more appropriate than others such as the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the correlation among efficiencies. Since three subgroups (p = 3, 7 and 8) contain only one DMU, their Spearman correlation coefficients are not applicable. Table\u00a07 presents the Spearman rank correlation coefficients of the other five subgroups. The upper and lower parts of Table\u00a07 show the Spearman rank correlations between the subunit efficiencies and the overall efficiencies of DMUs for the CRS and VRS technologies, respectively.\nThe Spearman correlation coefficients between subunit 5 and subgroup 1 are -0.500 and 1.000 in CRS and VRS, respectively; the correlation coefficients between subunit 1 and subgroup 6 are -0.399 and 0.291 in CRS and VRS, respectively, indicating that the correlation of efficiencies between the subgroups and subunits are different under the CRS and VRS technologies. The descriptive statistics in Table\u00a04 show that the DMU scales are largely different, so the VRS technology may be more reasonable in this context. The following analysis is primarily based on VRS technology.\n1 3\nThe correlation coefficients can provide guidance for hospital management decision makers to improve efficiency. For example, both in the CRS and VRS technologies, the correlations between subunit 1 and subgroup 4 are -0.500. The output of subunit 1 is the total inpatient days. The increased efficiency of subunit 1 in group 4 means that more resources are allocated to subunit 1, such as increased beds or total hospital stay. This is inconsistent with the service objectives and functional orientation of subgroup 4 hospitals, which are community-based health care facilities providing routine health care. Therefore, the community-based characteristics of subgroup 4 may explain why the efficiency of subunit 1 is negatively correlated with its overall efficiency.\nWhen only one subunit is inefficient, an effective strategy is to improve the performance of the inefficient subunit. For example, DMU37 is efficient in its subunits 1, 2, 5 and 6, and nearly efficient in subunit 3 (\u03b2VRS = 0.005), but it is more inefficient in subunit 4 (\u03b2VRS = 0.382) under the VRS technology. In this case, DMU37 can try to improve its performance in subunit 4 to become more efficient. Alternatively, if DMU37 as an acute general hospital has shortcomings in providing family medicine specialist clinic services, it could trade these off with other services.\nWhere two or more subunits have similar inefficiencies, an effective strategy might be to first improve the performance of subunits that are highly correlated with the overall efficiency of the DMU. For example, DMU2 is efficient in subunits 1, 3 and 4 and is inefficient in subunits 2, 5 and 6 under the VRS technology. Moreover, subunits 5 and 6 of DMU2 have similar inefficiency (0.255 vs. 0.212), but the correlation coefficient of inefficiency between the overall system and subunit 5 is higher than that of subunit 6 (0.829 vs. 0.563). Therefore, DMU2 can prioritise the performance of subunit 5 to improve its performance of the overall system by, say, allocating more resources to supply allied health outpatient services.\nIf the correlation coefficients of efficiencies between the subunits and the overall system are similar, the subunit with high inefficiency should be prioritised to improve. For example, DMU16 is efficient in subunits1, 2, 3 and 5, and inefficient in subunit 4 and 6 with similar correlation coefficients (0.573 vs. 0.576) under the VRS technology, DMU16 can firstly improve the performance of subunit 4, which is more inefficient than subunit 6 (0.563 vs. 0.129), by allocating more resources to the provision of family medicine specialist clinic services."

The DMU efficiencies of DDF-CRS, DDF-VRS, CHIRZ and LLM models are\nrepresented by 1-\u03b2CRS, 1-\u03b2VRS, eCHIRZ and eLLM respectively. It can be seen that the efficiencies of DDF-CRS are very close to CHIRZ, and those of DDF-VRS are very close to LLM. Under the CRS technology, there is no DMU completely efficient for CHIRZ or DDF-CRS; under the VRS technology, two DMUs (namely DMUs 4 and 28) are efficient in both DDF-VRS and LLM and the rest are inefficient.\nFigure\u00a02 shows the mean efficiency curves of subgroups for CHIRZ, LLM, DDF-CRS, and DDF-VRS. The efficiency\ncurve of DDF-CRS (1-\u03b2CRS) is close to CHIRZ while that of DDF-VRS (1-\u03b2VRS) is close to LLM, respectively.\nFigure\u00a03 plots the curves of the efficiencies and the number of subunits for the four models. When the number of subunits is one (i.e., producing one output), efficiency is the lowest, with efficiency increasing with increases in the number of subunits; however, DDF-CRS declines when the number of subunits increases from two to three. When the number of subunits is five, the efficiency reaches a maximum and then decreases.\nFigure\u00a04 pairwise compares the efficiency scores between non-DDF and DDF under the same technology, respectively.\nIn Fig.\u00a04(a), the horizontal axis is the efficiency from CHIRZ while the vertical axis is the efficiency from DDF-CRS (1-\u03b2CRS), and the diagonal represents the case of equality between the two; in Fig.\u00a04(b), the horizontal axis is the efficiency from LLM while the vertical axis is DDF-VRS (1-\u03b2VRS). In Fig.\u00a04(a) the majority of points are on or above the diagonal, indicating that the majority of DDF-CRS (1-\u03b2CRS) efficiencies are higher than the CHIRZ efficiencies under the CRS technology.

For completeness, Fig.\u00a05 compares the efficiencies between CRS and VRS for non-DDF and DDF models.

The results are depicted in Fig.\u00a06. The black, blue, green and red stand for the efficiencies of 1-\u03b2CRS, CHIRZ, 1-\u03b2VRS and LLM, respectively. Here, the gaussian kernel function and bandwidth selected are done via the Silverman rule of thumb [39]. As can be seen from the graph, the distribution of DDF-CRS (1-\u03b2CRS) is close to that of eCHIRZ while DDF-VRS (1-\u03b2VRS) is close to eLLM. Both of DDF-CRS and CHIRZ have one peak, while both DDF-VRS and LLM have two peaks.\nWe use a more comprehensive comparison for the different models using a test of equality of distributions, from Li [40, 41] and the version adapted to DEA-based efficiency analysis by Simar and Zelenyuk [42]. Li [40] has established that this test statistic is valid for both dependent and independent variables. Fan and Ullah [43] show that the test statistic asymptotically goes to the standard normal, but our study contains only 37 observations. Thus, we do a bootstrap approximation with 1000 replications to find the critical values for the statistic significance.\nAt the significance level \u03b1 = 5%, there are statistically significant differences between the four models with respect to the technologies assumed, but not for DDF-CRS (1-\u03b2CRS) and eCHIRZ under the CRS technology and DDF-VRS (1-\u03b2VRS) and eLLM under the VRS technology, as shown in Table\u00a09. In other words, DDF-CRS can be an alternative model for CHIRZ, and DDF-VRS can be an alternative\nmodel for LLM, but the DDF model is a general form and the directions align with an input-oriented model ."

            "text": "Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14] proposed DEA models to evaluate nonhomogeneous DMUs by investigating different output efficiencies with the same kind of inputs. This idea of dividing inputs across multiple subsets of outputs is essentially similar to the approach described by Cook and Zhu [44] for uncovering multiple variable proportionality (MVP). The proposed models in this paper are derived from Cook et\u00a0al. [9] and Li et\u00a0al. [14], and provide the CRS and VRS versions of the DDF model for the performance measurement of nonhomogeneous DMUs. The DDF-CRS results are close to that of Cook et\u00a0al. [9], although the majority of the former\u2019s efficiencies are slightly higher than the latter. The results of the DDF-VRS are close to Li et\u00a0al. [14], and again the former efficiencies are no less than the latter.\nThe empirical application provides some insights for management: (i) if the efficiencies of the subunits within the DMU are similar, the subunit that is highly correlated to the DMU should be improved first; (ii) if the correlations are similar, the subunits with lower efficiency should be improved first. The proposed models can help managers choose the direction of performance improvement, and also determine the priority of performance improvement.\nNon-homogeneity is a problem especially in the current COVID-19 situation, where hospitals have different strategies to reduce infection. For example, to manage COVID-19 in China, most hospitals have special fever clinics, some hospitals take care of COVID-19 patients, some hospitals chiefly take care of maternity, and some hospitals take care of elderly patients. These hospitals have different outputs, and the level of non-homogeneity suggests that conventional DEA models may not be appropriate to assess healthcare service efficiency. Our models have several advantages. First, they provide the more general DDF models which can easily accommodate the conventional DEA input / output orientation models. Second, they allow managers to readily choose the direction and priority for improvement in the light of managers\u2019 preferences.\n1 3\nThere are a number of possible avenues for future research. Although this paper analyses the correlation between subunits\u2019 efficiencies and hospitals\u2019 efficiencies to determine the direction and the priority of efficiency improvement for performance advances, how much improvement in the directions to reach the frontier can be further explored. The outputs in the study were assumed to be desirable but they could be extended to include undesirable outputs [45, 46] in the health care sector, such as mortality and infection rates.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10729- 022- 09625-0.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Professor Xiyang Lei (Hefei University of Technology) and four anonymous reviewers whose support and constructive comments improve the quality of this article.\nFunding This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72171052), the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 20CFX038) and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian, China (Grant No. 2020J01936).\nData Availability The data are available in the electronic supplementary material.\nDeclarations\nEthics statement This research does not require ethical approval as it relies on the secondary use of anonymous information and does not use any human/animal subjects.\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."
