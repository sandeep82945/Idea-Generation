GF14 (14-3-3) genes have been reported to play important role in biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the roles of OsGF14C remain unknown. To understand the functions and regulatory mechanisms ofOsGF14C in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, we have conducted OsGF14C-overexpressing transgenic experiments in the present study. Our results showed that overexpression of OsGF14C enhanced salinity tolerance but reduced blast resistance in rice. The enhanced salinity tolerance is related to the reduction of methylglyoxal and Na+ uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation and the negative role of OsGF14C in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of OsGF14E, OsGF14F and PR genes. Our results together with the results from the previous studies suggest that the lipoxygenase gene LOX2 which is regulated by OsGF14C may play roles in coordinating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice. The current study for the first time revealed the possible roles ofOsGF14C in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, and laid down a foundation for further functional study and crosstalk regulation between salinity and blast resistance in rice.\nKEYWORDS\nOsGF14C, salinity, blast, Na+ Uptake, Lox2, rice\nIntroduction\nRice (Oryza sativa L.) is the staple food for over half of the world\u2019s population. Therefore, rice production plays a crucial role in world food security. However, rice production is frequently subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses. High-salinity and blast disease are two major stresses that cause dramatic yield loss in rice production (Jacobs and Wang, 2021; Yin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022).\nfrontiersin.org01\nIt has been reported that more than 955 million hectares of land (approximately 6.5% of the world\u2019s total land area), 20% of the world\u2019s cultivated land area and nearly 50% of the world\u2019s irrigated land area are affected by salinity (Tufail et al., 2018), and this problem continues to worsen. In addition, the marginal lands such as coastal regions which are saline soils and unsuitable for crop cultivation need to be utilized for mitigating the issues of food demands.\nSalinity tolerance in rice is a quantitative trait which is regulated by a host of genes in plants. It is imperative to understand the molecular mechanism of salinity tolerance in rice tominimize salinity related yield penalty. So far, a number of salinity tolerance genes involving in transcription regulation, signal transduction, ion transportation and metabolic homeostasis have been identified in plants (Apse et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2000; Singla-Pareek et al., 2003; Conti et al., 2008;Munns et al., 2012; Kesten et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Song et al., 2021; Ganapati et al., 2022). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance are still not well understood. Particularly, the crosstalk between salinity and other stresses remain largely unknown (Gong et al., 2020; Zelm et al., 2020; Ganapati et al., 2022).\nRice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive rice diseases leading to severe yield losses in rice production worldwide (Yin et al., 2021). Rice blast resistance can be divided into qualitative resistance conferred by major genes (R) and quantitative (partial) resistance contributed by multiple genes (Kou andWang, 2010; Fu et al., 2011). Despite the powerful and universally used of R genes, quantitative resistance is presumably non race specific and is generally considered to be broader spectrum and more durable in natural conditions (Kou and Wang, 2010).\nThe GF14 (14-3-3) genes are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms. Plant GF14 proteins interact with a broad range of phosphorylated proteins and function in signaling, transcription activation or defense (Roberts, 2003), which endow GF14 proteins different roles in plant development, metabolism, environmental stress responses and may establish a platform for crosstalk in diverse pathways (Oecking and Jaspert, 2009). Many GF14 genes have been reported to be involved in biotic stresses in various crop plants. For example, the barley GF14 proteins havebeendemonstrated to interactwithplasmamembraneH+ATPases in epidermal cells as they respond to infection by the powdery mildew fungus (Finni et al., 2002). The Arabidopsis GF14-l confers resistance to the fungal pathogen Golovonomyces spp. through interaction with the RPW8.2 protein (Yang et al., 2009). The tomato GF14 protein 7 directly interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKKa) to positively regulate immunity-associated programmed cell death (Oh et al., 2010). There are eightGF14members in rice (GF14A - GF14H) (Chen et al., 2006), among which, OsGF14B may interact with mitogen-induced MAP kinase 1 (BIMK1) which was induced by rice blast infection and participates in systemic acquired disease resistance (Cooper et al., 2003).OsGF14Ewas the firstGF14 gene confirmed to play a negative role in bacterial Xoo and fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solanidisease resistance (Manosalva et al., 2011). Inprevious study, we also found that OsGF14E positively regulates panicle blast resistance in rice (Liu et al., 2016b), while OsGF14B positively regulates panicle blast resistancebutnegatively regulates leaf blast resistance in rice (Liu et al., 2016a). In addition to the roles in biotic stresses, GF14 genes have been also reported to function in abiotic stresses.Overexpression of the Arabidopsis GF14l in cotton leads to a \u201cstay-green\u201d phenotype and improves stress resistance under moderate drought conditions (Yan\nFrontiers in Plant Science 02\net al., 2004). However, GF14l and GF14k were reported to negatively regulate salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis (Zhou et al., 2014). Coexpression of D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (IPS) and 14-3-3- like protein GF14 is responsible for the interaction between maize and Rhizophagus intraradices under drought stress, and potentially induces the synergistic actions of the symbiotic partners in enhancing plant drought resistance (Li et al., 2016). Ectopic expression of TaGF14b in tobacco led to longer root, better growth status, and higher relativewater content, survival rate, photosynthetic rate, and water use efficiency in transgenic tobaccos compared to those in control plants under drought and salinity stresses (Zhang et al., 2018a). Studies also showed that the binding ofGF14w toGlutamateReceptor-Like ProteinGLR3.7 inhibited primary root length under salinity stress in Arabidopsis thaliana (Wang et al., 2019). In addition to its function in blast, the OsGF14B was also found to regulate rice response to drought stress. The OsGF14Boverexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress (Liu et al., 2019).\nOsGF14C has been reported to be responsive to different biotic and abiotic stresses in rice (Chen et al., 2006). However, its actual functions in different stresses in rice have not been fully characterized yet. In the present study, we found that overexpression of OsGF14C showed opposite roles in response to salinity and blast stress in rice. The overexpression of OsGF14C positively regulates salinity tolerance by reducing the level of methylglyoxal and Na+ uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation, while negatively regulates blast resistance by inhibiting the expression of GF14E, GF14F and PR genes. Furthermore, our results and the previous studies together implied that the lipoxygenase gene LOX2 which is regulated by OsGF14C may play roles in both salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice. Thus, the present study for the first time revealed the possible roles of OsGF14C in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, and provided insights into the crosstalk regulation between salt and blast resistance in rice."

The experiments were conducted at 0h, 12h, 24h and 48h after stress treatments. The results indicated that the expression levels of OsGF14C significantly\nfrontiersin.org\nincreased at 24h and 48h after salinity treatment, while significantly decreased at 24h after blast inoculation (Figure 1).\nOverexpression of OsGF14C enhances tolerance to salinity stress but reduces resistance to blast in rice\nTo confirm the functions ofOsGF14C in salinity and blast resistance in rice,weproduced theOsGF14Coverexpressing plants (OsGF14C-OX) using the variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) as material, which is susceptible to blast. Fifteen independent transgenic lines were generated and the OX plants showed no differences in morphological phenotypes compared to wild type plants.\nFour independent homozygous lines (OX-4, OX-9, OX-12 andOX15) with different high transcription levels ofOsGF14Cwere selected for evaluation of salinity tolerance (Figure 2A). The results showed that the relative electrolyte leakages, which is an indicator of membrane injury under salinity stress, of all the OsGF14C-OX lines were significantly lower than thewild-typeplants on the fourth day after high salinity stress treatment (Figure 2B).

Correlation analysis demonstrated apositive correlationbetween the expression level ofOsGF14Cand infected leaf area (R2 = 0.643;Figure3D), suggesting that increased OsGF14C expression may reduce the blast resistance in rice.\nOsGF14C is ubiquitously expressed in different tissues and localized in cytoplasm\nIn order to gain further insights into the function of OsGF14C in rice response to stresses, the temporal and spatial expression patterns ofOsGF14C in root, stem and leaf at different stages were analyzed. As shown in Figure 4A, the expression of OsGF14C can be detected in all rice tissues examined in the present study and relative higher expression level was observed in leaf at seedling stage.\nTo investigate the sub-cellular localization of OsGF14C, the coding domain sequence of OsGF14C was fused with the green fluorescence protein (eGFP) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The OsGF14C::eGFP fusion vector and\nfrontiersin.org\nthe control vector (empty eGFP vector) were transiently expressed in rice protoplasts. The laser confocal microscope showed that the green fluorescent signal in the protoplasts expressing eGFP control vector was distributed both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas the green fluorescent signal was distributed in the cytoplasm of the rice protoplasts transfected with the OsGF14C::eGFP vector (Figure 4B). The results demonstrated OsGF14C was localized in cytoplasm.\nOsGF14C modulate the expression of defense-related genes and Na+ transportrelated genes\nAccording to the previous studies, the defense-related genes play important roles in blast resistance in rice, and the accumulation of\nFrontiers in Plant Science 05\ntoxic ions, such as Na+ is the main reason for ion toxicity in rice under salinity stresses (Yan et al., 2022).

            "text": "Overexpression of OsGF14C positively regulates salinity tolerance while negatively regulates blast resistance in rice\nIt has been reported that GF (14-3-3) played very important roles in plant growth and development, as well as in response to various stresses. There are eight GF genes in rice, named GF14A-GF14H. The\nFrontiers in Plant Science 07\nother studies and our previous studies have confirmed that GF14B and GF14E functioned in regulating disease resistance and drought tolerance in rice (Manosalva et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016a; Liu et al., 2016b). Although it was reported that OsGF14C responded differently in various biotic and abiotic stresses in rice (Chen et al., 2006), the molecular functions of OsGF14C involved in biotic and abiotic stresses resistances in rice remain to be elucidated. In present study, the sub-cellular localization of OsGF14C in rice protoplasts revealed that OsGF14C accumulated only in the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the observations in rice callus and onion epidermal cells (Figure 4B). Differently, GF14B, GF14E and GF14F were localized in both nuclei and cytoplasm (Chen et al., 2006). Furthermore, the temporal and spatial expression analysis indicated that OsGF14C exhibited higher expression levels in all the tissues examined in the present study at the seedling stage compared to those at the ripening stage (Figure 4A). The different sub-cellular localization, temporal and spatial expression patterns imply that OsGF14C might have different functions in rice. Our transgenic experiments further confirmed this speculation.\nOur results showed that the expression of OsGF14C was induced by salinity stress while suppressed by blast infection (Figure 1). The relative electrolyte leakages, which is an indicator of salinity resistance, of the OsGF14C-OX lines were significantly lower than that of the wild-type plants after salinity stress treatment (Figure 2B).\nFIGURE 5 Expression analysis of LOX2 and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in the OsGF14C-OX transgenic plants and control plants (Ctrl) by quantitative real-time PCR. Error bars indicate the SD from three biological replicates and asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control plants (t test, **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05).\nfrontiersin.org\nIn consistence with these results, after salinity treatment for seven days and then recovery for ten days, the survival rates of the OsGF14C-OX lines were significantly higher than that of their wild type plants (Figures 2C, D). On the contrary, for the blast disease resistance, the infected lesion areas of OsGF14C-OX lines were larger than the wild type plants and the expression levels of OsGF14C was positively correlated with infected leaf areas in OsGF14C-OX lines (Figure 3), indicating negative effect of OsGF14C in regulating blast resistance in rice. Taken together, our results suggest that overexpression of OsGF14C can improve salinity tolerance but reduce blast resistance in rice.\nThe negative role of OsGF14C overexpression in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of GF14E, GF14F and PR genes\nIt is well known that PR genes play important roles in plant defense responses (Kaur et al., 2017). Our previous study and other studies also suggest that the PR genes are involved in blast resistance\nFrontiers in Plant Science 08\nin rice (Tezuka et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2021). CHT1, which is also named as pathogenesis related (PR)-3 chitinase 1, is another typical defense response gene. Previous studies showed that CHT1 played important roles in disease resistances, such as sheath blight disease and blast disease in rice (Hao et al., 2012). To investigate whether OsGF14C mediated blast resistance is associated with PR genes, we analyzed the expression of the PR genes in the present study. The results showed that the expression levels of PR1, PR5, PR10a and CHT1 in OsGF14C overexpressing lines were all significantly lower than that in wild type plants, suggesting that OsGF14C negatively regulates blast resistance in rice by suppression of PR genes.\nIn plants, GF proteins are known to be involved in regulating a large number of biological processes via their interaction with numerous client proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Recently, 87 client proteins were identified through affinity chromatography assay using four GF proteins in rice, including the GF14C (Zhang et al., 2017). Twenty-nine (exclude OsGF14C itself) out of the 87 client proteins can interact with OsGF14C. Among these 29 client proteins, the expression levels of OsGF14E and OsGF14F, were significantly lower in OsGF14C-OX plants than that in wild type plants. In our previous study, we have functionally confirmed that\nfrontiersin.org\nOsGF14E and OsGF14F could positively regulate blast resistance in rice (Liu et al., 2016b; Ma et al., 2022). These results suggest that OsGF14C might negatively regulate blast resistance by suppressing the expression of OsGF14E and OsGF14F. However, further studies are needed to elucidate whether OsGF14C regulates blast resistance by an indirect way or by both indirect and direct ways.\nOsGF14C positively regulates salinity tolerance by reducing the level of methylglyoxal and Na+ uptake\nGFP (Glyoxalase family protein, also named GLY or GLO) and GSTF2 (Glutathione S-transferase) are another two client proteins of OsGF14C reported by Zhang et al. (2017). GLYI catalyzes methylglyoxal (MG) metabolism in the presence of GSH and produces an intermediate compound S-lactoylglutathione. According to previous studies, MG is a potent cytotoxic compound produced from glycolysis. The rate of glycolysis increases under stresses, and lead to MG accumulation in plants. MG accumulation is toxic to cells as it inhibits cell proliferation and results in a number of adverse effects, such as increasing the degradation of proteins and inactivating the antioxidant defense system (Hossain et al., 2009). Previous studies showed that overexpression of GLY I+II together in tobacco led to enhancement of salinity and zinc tolerance (SinglaPareek et al., 2003; Singla-Pareek et al., 2006). Heterologous expression of OsGLYI-11.2 in Escherichia coli and tobacco also\nFrontiers in Plant Science 09\nresulted in improved adaptation to various abiotic stresses caused by increased scavenging of MG, lowering the Na(+)/K(+) ratio and maintenance of reduced glutathione levels (Mustafiz et al., 2014). In the present study, the expression levels of GLYI-11 and GSTF2, and the contents of MG were significantly lower in OsGF14C-OX lines than that in wild type plants (Figures 7, 8). Taken together, these results suggest that the positive role of OsGF14C in regulating salinity tolerance might be partially attributed to its interactions with GLYI11 and GSTF2, and leading to the reduction of MG.\nPlants have developed intricate mechanisms for Na+ uptake, export and compartmentation to reduce the accumulation of Na+ (Wu, 2018). So far, the salt-overly-sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway has been considered an importance pathway in salt resistance (Gong et al., 2020; Zelm et al., 2020). The SOS1 encodes a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter, which uses the H+ gradient to drive Na+ efflux and thus reducing cytosolic Na+ concentration (Shi et al., 2003). However, in the present study, there was no significant difference in the expression levels of SOS1 between OsGF14C-OX plants and wild type plants, either before or after salinity treatment (Supplemental Figure 1). In addition, the central vacuole is an ideal location for Na+ sequestration to reduce the Na+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. NHX-type transporters play important roles in Na+ translocation from cytoplasm to vacuole through a Na+/H+ exchanger (Blumwald and Poole, 1985; Gong et al., 2020). Nevertheless, our results showed that the expression levels of NHX1 and NHX5 in OsGF14C-OX lines were similar to that in wild type plants, both with and without salinity treatment (Supplemental Figure 1). In contrast, the expression levels\nfrontiersin.org\nof HKT-type transporters including HKT1, HKT4, and HKT6, which mediate the translocation of Na+ from extracellular to cytoplasm in OsGF14C-OX plants were significantly lower than that in wild type plants, both before and after salinity treatment (Figure 6). Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsGF14C may positively regulate salinity tolerance by lowering the expression of HKT-type transporter genes and inhibiting the Na+ uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation.\nLOX2 may play important roles in coordinating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice\nIn natural environment, plants are often subjected to both abiotic (such as drought, salt, cold) and biotic (necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens) stresses simultaneously, which likely demands cross-talk between stress-response pathways to minimize the fitness costs. It is essential to find out the genes which could play roles in different stresses resistance and understand how the various stress response pathways\nFrontiers in Plant Science 10\ninteract with one another. In the present study, overexpression of OsGF14C enhanced the resistance to salinity stress but reduced the resistance to blast in rice. The opposite roles ofOsGF14C overexpression played in salinity stress and blast disease are consistent with the previous findings that plants exposed to abiotic stresses such as high salinity and drought oftendisplay reduced immuneactivity (Bostock et al., 2014). It is understandable for this conflict as stress responses are costly, plants likely coordinate these responses to minimize fitness costs.\nAccording to previous studies, LOXs, the key enzymes of JA synthesis, have been reported to involve in various physiological processes, including responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Mostofa et al., 2015). Chu et al. (2019) showed that the Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Pseudomonas PS01 could survive under 225 mM NaCl, while the non-inoculated plants were dead above 200 mMNaCl. The gene expression analysis of the genes related to stress resistance indicated that only LOX2 was up-regulated in the inoculated plants in comparison to the non-inoculated controls (Chu et al., 2019). Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2018b) found that LOX2 and LOX5 were specifically suppressed by Guy11 infection, which are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by M. oryzae strain Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. They also proposed that induced expression of OsLOX2/5may improve resistance to the blast disease in rice (Zhanget al., 2018b). In thepresent study,our results showed that the expression levels of LOX2were significantly higher in theOsGF14C-OX plants than that inwild typeplants.Given thatLOXgenes play important roles in regulating both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, the increased expressions ofLOX2 inOsGF14C-OXplants impliedLOX2maypartially lead to the differences responses of transgenetic plants to salinity and blast resistance. However, despite that OsGF14C-OX plants showed increased expression of LOX2, the transgenetic plants were more sensitive to rice blast disease than their wild type plants, which seems to be conflict with previous studies. But we also detected reduced expression of some PR genes in OsGF14C-OX plants, which may be the principal reason for the reduction of blast resistance. This also indicated the complexity between different stress response pathways and the importance for understanding the crosstalk between different stress pathways.According to the results from this study,LOX2mayplay\nFIGURE 8 The content of methylglyoxal in the OsGF14C-OX transgenic plants and control plants (Ctrl).

However, it needmore studies to confirm ifLOX2 is the switch gene and how it regulates the salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice. It is of great significance to study the regulation mechanisms of LOX2 underlying different stresses in crops."

The improvement of salinity tolerance by overexpression of OsGF14C may be resulted from reducing the level of methylglyoxal and Na+ uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation. Our results and the previous studies together suggest that the lipoxygenase gene LOX2 may an important gene which play roles in both abiotic and biotic stresses. Finally, a molecular model of OsGF14C-mediated salinity and blast resistance pathways in rice was proposed (Figure 9)."
