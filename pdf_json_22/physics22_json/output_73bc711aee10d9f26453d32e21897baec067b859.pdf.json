For certain choices of the decoherence function, the maps are noninvertible and they remain under convex combinations as well. For the case of dynamical maps characterized by the decoherence function (1\u2212e\u2212ct)/n with the decoherence parameter n and decay factor c, we evaluate the fraction of invertible maps obtained upon mixing, which is found to increase superexponentially with dimension d.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFor a quantum system undergoing an open evolution [1], the time evolution of the system of interest is described by a quantum dynamical map which is a time-continuous family of completely positive (CP) and trace-preserving linear time-dependent maps, {\u03a6(t) : t \u2265 0,\u03a6(0) = 1}, acting on the bounded operators of the Hilbert space of the system of interest [2, 3]. The properties of the dynamical map is related to the time-local generator L(t) [4] in the time-local master equation,\n\u03a6\u0307(t) = L(t)\u03a6(t), with\nL(t)[\u03c1] =\u2212 \u0131[H(t), \u03c1] + \u2211 i \u03b3i(t) ( Gi(t)\u03c1Gi(t) \u2020 \u2212 1 2 {Gi(t)\u2020Gi(t), \u03c1} ) .\n(1)\nHere H(t) is the effective Hamiltonian, Gi(t)\u2019s are the noise operators, and \u03b3i(t)\u2019s the decoherence rates, describing the continuous-in-time description of the dynamics of the system of interest. The dynamical map is divisible if\n\u03a6(tf , ti) = K(tf , t)\u03a6(t, ti), \u2200tf \u2265 t \u2265 ti \u2265 0. (2)\nThe map is CP divisible if for all t\u2019s, the propagator K(tf , t) is CP. If the decay rates \u03b3i(t) are positive at all times, the map is CP divisible. Otherwise, the map is CP indivisible. According to the CP divisibility criterion [5] of quantum Markovianity, a quantum dynamical map is Markovian if it is CP divisible at all instants of time. Any deviation from CP divisibility is, therefore, an indicator of non-Markovianity. This is also equivalent to temporary negativity of the decay rates in the time-local\n\u2217 vinayak.jagadish@uj.edu.pl\nmaster equation [6]. If the decay rates are constants, the generator corresponds to a Markovian semigroup. Such maps are time homogenous, i.e.,\n\u03a6(tf , ti) = \u03a6(tf \u2212 ti, 0) := \u03a6(tf \u2212 ti). (3)\nConvex combinations of quantum dynamical maps have been studied by various authors. An example to create a non-Markovian evolution by mixing two Markovian semigroups was reported in Ref. [7]. A similar idea appeared in an earlier paper [8] prior to the advent of the divisibility and distinguishability criteria for quantum non-Markovianity. In Ref. [9], the counterintuitive behavior was explained in terms of information flow between the system and the environment. An example of a convex combination of two non-Markovian dynamical maps leading to a Markovian evolution was discussed in Ref. [10]. It was shown that an eternally non-Markovian evolution (with one decay rate being negative at all times, t > 0) results from a convex combination of Pauli semigroups [11]. More generally, eternally non-Markovian evolution obtained by the convex combination of semigroups of generalized Pauli dynamical maps has been studied in Ref. [12]. Recently, the geometry of the region of non-Markovianity obtained by convex combinations of Pauli semigroups and time-dependent Markovian Pauli dynamical maps was addressed [13, 14]. These results showed that the sets of CP divisible and CP indivisible Pauli dynamical maps are nonconvex. A measure of nonMarkovianity was introduced [15] based on the minimal amount of extra Markovian noise that needs to be added via convex mixing in order to make the dynamical map Markovian.\nIn Eq. (2), if for a particular instant of time t = t\u2217, the map \u03a6(t\u2217, ti) is noninvertible, then there are multiple initial states that are mapped to the same output state. In this case, the propagator K(tf , t \u2217) = \u03a6(tf , ti)\u03a6(t \u2217ti) \u22121 is undefined. Such points t\u2217 are referred to as singular points [16] of the map. The presence of singularities in\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n03 25\n8v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 8\nJu l 2\n02 2\n2 the map is reflected in the corresponding time-local master equation where one or more of the decay rates could go to infinity. Despite the fact that the dynamical map could be momentarily noninvertible, the singularities are usually not pathological, in the sense that the density operator of the system of interest is well defined [17, 18]. Recently, convex combinations of dynamical maps with singularities have caught attention [19\u201322]. For generalized Pauli dynamical maps, it was shown that noninvertible maps cannot be produced by mixing invertible maps. The surprising result that convex combinations of noninvertible qudit Pauli maps can produce a semigroup was reported in Ref. [19]. Subsequently, it was also shown that noninvertibility of the generalized Pauli input maps is necessary for this [21]. This prompts the question of whether the noninvertibility is sufficient. The answer is no: Some mixtures produce noninvertible maps. A natural followup to this line of inquiry would be to quantify the fraction of the mixtures of noninvertible maps that produce (non)invertible maps.\nThe physical motivation is ultimately about fighting noise in practical quantum information processing, especially in the context of near-term quantum devices. In principle, noise corresponding to a noninvertible map cannot be corrected. An experimentalist would want to avoid parameter regimes that would generate such noise. In a futuristic quantum computer that is fully fault tolerant and operating within the required noise thresholds, this is less of a problem. However, as we enter the noisy intermediate scale quantum era [23], where quantum devices are expected to lack the depth required to implement full quantum error correction, avoidance of noninvertibility can be a matter of practical concern.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We discuss the case of mixing noninvertible Pauli dynamical maps in the following Section. In Sec. III, we extend our analysis to the case of generalized Pauli dynamical maps. Finally, we discuss the results and conclude in Sec. IV."

The convex combination of the three Pauli dynamical maps Eq. (4), each mixed in proportions of xi is, therefore,\n\u03a6\u0303(t) = 3\u2211 i=1 xi\u03a6i(t), (xi > 0, \u2211 i xi = 1). (5)\nWe will call the three \u03a6i(t)\u2019s input maps and \u03a6\u0303(t) the output map. Let each of the maps be characterized by the same decoherence function,\np(t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212ct\nn , n \u2265 1, c > 0.

(12)\nFor invertible inputs, n \u2265 2, the right-hand side above is negative and, thus, any mixing coefficient xi satisfies the lower bound in Eq. (12). This bound monotonically increases as n decreases in Eq. (12). If n < 43 , then xi < 1 3 , a constraint that cannot be satisfied by all three\nmaps ( since in that case we would have \u2211 i xi < 1 ) . We now have the following result. When the input map is invertible (n \u2265 2), the output map is necessarily invertible. For noninvertible inputs, if n < 43 , the output map is necessarily noninvertible. For input maps that are of the intermediate noninvertible range ( 2 > n > 43 ) , the output can be invertible or not, depending on the mixing coefficients. In the intermediate range of noninvertible inputs n \u2208 ( 43 , 2), a fraction of the output maps will be invertible. In the case of n = 4/3, for the output map to be invertible, Eq. (12) implies that all xi \u2265 13 . Therefore, the output map is noninvertible for all values of mixing coefficients xi\u2019s except at the point of equal mixing where all xi\u2019s are 1/3 each. From Eq. (10), one can see that the eigenvalues of the output map, \u03bbi(t) = e\n\u2212ct for the case of equal mixing, which is indicative of a semigroup. For the intermediate case,\n3 i.e., n \u2208 (4/3, 2), let us evaluate the measure \u2206invert of invertible maps over all possible mixtures.\nTo this end, we note that x1 can take values in the range [1\u2212 n2 , 1\u2212 2\u00d7 (1\u2212 n 2 )] = [1\u2212 n 2 , n\u2212 1], where the lower bound is determined by Eq. (12), and the upper bound arises due to allocating this minimal mass of probability to the other two variables. The variable x2 then is allowed to take values in the range 1\u2212 n2 and n 2 \u2212 x1. We have\n\u2206invert = 1\n\u00b5\n\u222b n 2\u2212x1\n1\u2212n2 dx2 \u222b n\u22121 1\u2212n2 dx1\n= (4\u2212 3n)2\n8 , (13)\nwhere the normalization factor \u00b5 = \u222b 1\u2212x1 0 dx2 \u222b 1 0 dx1 = 1 2 . Equation (13) shows that the measure of invertible maps falls monotonically through the range of [1, 0] as n is varied in the intermediate range ( 43 , 2). The above arguments can be readily extended to the case of qudits as performed in Sec. III.\nB. More general decoherence functions\nGoing beyond the form of the decoherence function as in Eq. (6), one can consider other forms of noninvertible maps. Obviously, there is a great deal of freedom here, and one might wish to start with simple and natural forms. We consider the case where each of the noninvertible maps is characterized by the same decoherence function,\np(t) = 1\u2212 cos(\u03c9t)\n2 , (14)\nin place of Eq. (6). The corresponding time-local generator can be evaluated to be\nLi(t)[\u03c1] = \u03c9\n2 tan(\u03c9t)(\u03c3i\u03c1\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c1).\nThe decay rate \u03c92 tan(\u03c9t) is indicative of the noninvertibility of the input maps. The output map \u03a6\u0303(t) Eq. (5) satisfies the eigenvalue relation given by Eq. (9), i.e.,\n\u03a6\u0303(t)[\u03c3i] = \u03bbi(t)\u03c3i, with\n\u03bbi(t) = xi + (1\u2212 xi) cos(\u03c9t). (15)\nThe eigenvalues \u03bbi(t) become singular at\nt\u2217 = 1\n\u03c9\n[ cos\u22121 ( xi xi \u2212 1 )] . (16)\nFrom this, it can be seen that for the output map to be invertible (i.e., there exists no finite time t at which the eigenvalues can be zero), all three mixing coefficients xi, should be greater than 0.5, which is impossible. This entails that the resultant map is noninvertible for all choices of convex combinations. A similar behavior is seen for the\nchoice of p(t) = sin(\u03c9t). We note that this generalizes the example in Ref. [19], where the shift of the singularity in the input maps under convex combination is noted.\nSuppose the choice of the decoherence function p(t) in Eq. (10) is such that p(t) monotonically increases up to a finite time t#, such that p(t#) = 12 , and it remains constant thereafter. For example:\np(t) = f(t)[1\u2212\u0398(t\u2212 t#)] + 1 2 \u0398(t\u2212 t#), (17)\nwhere f(t) is any monotonically increasing function such that f(0) = 0, f(t#) = 12 . Thus, each input map is maximally dephasing and thereby noninvertible (all \u201cazimuthal\u201d points on the Bloch ball being mapped to a single point on the respective axis). Quite generally, Eq. (10) implies that the potential singular point in the output map is the solution t\u2217 for the equation\np(t\u2217) = 1\n2(1\u2212 xi) . (18)\nBut this is necessarily greater than 12 , considering that all xi\u2019s are nonzero. It follows that this defines a set of noninvertible input maps that produces an invertible output.\nThe above examples in the subsection make the following pattern evident: The decoherence function p(t) can be such that it just makes the input maps noninvertible, but does not increase far enough to make the output map noninvertible; or it can go all the way to 1, making noninvertibility inevitable. We, therefore, understand that the choice of exponential function as in Eq. (6) is a good candidate to get invertible or noninvertible maps by tuning the parameter n to enable an intermediate behavior. Similar arguments also apply to the case of generalized Pauli maps, discussed below."

A set of (d+ 1)-orthonormal bases {|\u03be(\u03b1)i \u3009, i = 0, . . . , d\u22121} in Cd such that \u3008\u03be(\u03b1)i |\u03be (\u03b2) j \u3009|2 = 1/d whenever \u03b1 6= \u03b2, is a MUB. If the dimension of the Hilbert space d is an integer power of a prime number, then d+ 1 MUBs exist. Defining the rank-1 projectors P (\u03b1) j = |\u03be (\u03b1) j \u3009\u3008\u03be (\u03b1) j |, one introduces the (d+ 1)-unitary operators,\nU\u03b1 = d\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03c9jP (\u03b1) j , \u03c9 = e 2\u03c0\u0131/d. (19)\n4 We consider the convex combination of d+ 1-generalized Pauli dynamical maps (i = 1, ...d+ 1) [25],\n\u03a6i(t)[\u03c1] = [1\u2212 p(t)]\u03c1+ p(t) d\u22121\u2211 k=1 Uki \u03c1U k \u2020 i , (20)\neach mixed in proportions of xi as\n\u03a6\u0303(t) = d+1\u2211 i=1 xi\u03a6i(t), (xi > 0, \u2211 i xi = 1). (21)\nThe map \u03a6\u0303(t) satisfies the eigenvalue relation,\n\u03a6\u0303(t)[Uki ] = \u03bbi(t)U k i , k = 1, ..., d\u2212 1, (22)\nwith\n\u03bbi(t) = 1\u2212 d\nd\u2212 1 (1\u2212 xi)p(t). (23)\nFor the choice of p(t) as in Eq. (6), the eigenvalues become singular at\nt\u2217 = 1 c ln [ d(1\u2212 xi) d(1\u2212 xi)\u2212 n(d\u2212 1) ] . (24)\nFor the cases of Pauli dynamical maps and generalized Pauli maps, it was shown that when the input map is invertible, the resultant map is necessarily invertible [19, 20]. Invertible input maps correspond to n \u2265 dd\u22121 . From Eq. (24), for noninvertible inputs, if n < d 2\nd2\u22121 , the resultant map is necessarily noninvertible. We have the following result.\nTheorem 1. For generalized Pauli input maps that are of the intermediate noninvertible range ( d d\u22121 > n \u2265\nd2 d2\u22121 ) , the fraction of output maps that are invertible is\ngiven by [ (d2(n\u22121)\u2212n)\nd\n]d .\nProof. From Eq. (24) it follows that the requirement for invertibility is\nxi \u2265 1\u2212 n(d\u2212 1)\nd \u2261 g(d, n). (25)\nThe input map is invertible for n \u2265 dd\u22121 , and is a semigroup for n = dd\u22121 . For invertible inputs n \u2265 d d\u22121 , the right-hand side above is negative and, thus, any mixing coefficient xi satisfies the lower bound in Eq. (25). This bound monotonically increases as n decreases in Eq. (25). If n < d 2\nd2\u22121 , then xi < 1 d+1 , a constraint that cannot be satisfied by all three maps ( since in that case we would\nhave \u2211 i xi < 1 ) .\nIn the intermediate range of noninvertible inputs n \u2208 ( d 2\nd2\u22121 , d d\u22121 ), a fraction of the output maps will be invertible. To evaluate this, first we note that x1 (any given xj) must range from the minimum of g(d, n) in view of\nEq. (25), with, at least, this mass of probability being assigned to the remaining d maps. Therefore, the allowed maximum is bounded by 1\u2212 dg(d, n). Accordingly, x1 \u2208 [g(d, n), 1\u2212dg(d, n)] = [g(d, n), (d\u22121)(n\u22121)]. (26)\nSimilarly, x2 (or, any but x1) must range from the minimum of g(d, n) in view of Eq. (25) with, at least, this mass of probability being assigned to the remaining (d\u22121) maps less the mass x1 already assigned to the first map #1. Therefore, the allowed range is given by\nx2 \u2208 [g(d, n), 1\u2212 (d\u2212 1)g(d, n)\u2212 x1]. (27) Proceeding analogously, for a general mixing variable xj , we have\nxj+1 \u2208 [g(d, n), f(j)\u2212Xj ], (28) where f(j) and Xj are as defined by\nf(j) \u2261 1\u2212 (d\u2212 j)g(d, n), Xj \u2261 xj + xj\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ x1. (29)\nGiven dimension d and parameter n, the measure of the invertible region in the space of resultant maps is evaluated to be\n\u2206invert(d, n) = 1\n\u00b5 \u222b (d\u22121)(n\u22121) g(d,n)\ndx1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222b f(j)\u2212Xj g(d,n) dxj+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b f(d\u22121)\u2212Xd\u22121 g(d,n) dxd\n=\n[ d2(n\u2212 1)\u2212 n\nd\n]d .\n(30)\nHere,\n\u00b5 = \u222b 1\u2212Xj 0 dxd \u222b 1\u2212Xj\u22121 0 dxd\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b 1 0 dx1 = 1 d! (31)\nis the normalization constant.\nEquation (30) implies that for any given dimension d, the invertible fraction \u2206invert ranges from \u2206invert(d, d2 d2\u22121 ) = 0 to \u2206invert(d, d d\u22121 ) = 1. For fixed n, and sufficiently large d, we find that \u2206invert approaches unity with a superexponential rate O(dd). However, to plot this, we remark that the intermediate region [ d 2\nd2\u22121 , d d\u22121 ] quadratically shrinks into a narrow interval that converges towards unity. Therefore, to depict the dependence of the invertible fraction on d, we must choose a range of d values such that a given n value falls within their corresponding interval. An example is given in Fig. 1, varying d discretely over the prime powers from 7 to 32. The intermediate regions of n corresponding to these two values are, respectively, [1.021, 1.167] and [1.001, 1.032]. Here we choose n = 1.03, which is contained in both intervals and, by interpolation, in the intervals corresponding to all the intermediate values of d. (The intervals corresponding to prime powers equal to and below d = 5 have no overlap with the intervals corresponding to prime powers equal to and above d = 32, and, hence, are excluded in this representation).\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n-20 -15 -10 -5\nFIG. 1.

            "text": "A quantum resource theory (RT) formalizes the separation of a given set of objects of interest (typically represented as states) into resource states and free (nonresource) states. The idea is that there are free (or \u201ceasy\u201d) operations in the RT such that the set of free states is closed under the action of free operations. For example, in a resource theory of quantum entanglement, the entangled (respectively, separable) states are the resource (respectively, free) states, while local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constitute the free operations. It is well known that separable states cannot become entangled under LOCC. A RT, therefore, addresses the question of tasks which are (im)possible using free operations [26]. In a convex RT, the free states form a convex set.\nOne could consider a quantum RT for noninvertibility, considering how this feature can be converted into corresponding limitations on quantum information processing. Consider, for example, a map E described by the noise \u03c1 \u2192 \u2211 j Kj\u03c1K \u2020 j , where Kj \u2019s are Kraus operators, acting on one-half of the maximally entangled state 1\u221a D \u2211D k=1 |k, k\u3009A,B between systems A and B. The resulting mixed entangled state can act as a noisy quantum teleportation map. Given an initial state \u03c1 of system S, this map teleports \u03c1 according to\n\u03c1\u2192 \u2211 rjklm \u3008l, l|SA \u03c1S \u2297Kr |j\u3009A \u3008k|K \u2020 r \u2297 |j\u3009B \u3008k|m,m\u3009SA\n= \u2211 r K\u2020r\u03c1Kr \u2261 ET (\u03c1), (32)\ni.e., a map characterized by Kraus operators {Kj} is mapped to one characterized by the Kraus operators {K\u2020j }. It follows that if the dynamical map described by E is noninvertible, then so is the effective teleportation map ET . Thus, we find that quantum noninvertibility as a negative resource, i.e., one that is convertible to a limiting (rather than enabling) feature of noisy teleportation, an idea that can be extended to certain other quantum information processing tasks.\nIn this framework, invertible maps would correspond to free states and noninvertible maps to resource states. Free operations must be resource nonincreasing. For this we consider, the composition of maps, i.e., a sequential application. Invertible maps being bijective, the composition of bijective maps is also a bijection. Since bijective maps have a unique inverse, the composed map, therefore, is also invertible. Thus, the set of invertible maps is closed under composition. Given such a RT, our results imply that in the context of qudit Pauli dynamical maps, noninvertibility is a convex resource. Mixing invertible maps can never result in noninvertibility. On the other hand, a mixture of noninvertible maps satisfying the condition n \u2208 [ dd\u22121 , d2\nd2\u22121 ] produces a set of invertible maps with a finite nonzero measure. The convexity of the invertible set may be contrasted with the nonconvexity of the set of quantum Markovian (CP divisible) dynamical maps. On that basis, it was argued that CP indivisibility does not yield a convex resource theory [13].\nIn this paper, we have studied the properties of dynamical maps that result under mixing of generalized Pauli dynamical maps that are noninvertible. In any given dimension d, (non)invertibility of the input maps is parametrized through a parameter n , which ensures invertibility when sufficiently large. Analogously, for noninvertible dynamical maps with sufficiently small n, the resultant dynamical map is necessarily noninvertible. We quantify the fraction of invertible maps in the intermediate range of n. Specifically, we have shown that the set of such invertible maps is of nonzero measure."
