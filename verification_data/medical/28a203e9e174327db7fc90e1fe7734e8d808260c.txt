"It is beyond doubt that our understanding of mediators that propel inflammation on atherosclerosis has improved considerably over last few years but translating this knowledge from bench to bedside still needs to be enhanced. The complex etiology coupled with several phases of atherosclerotic lesion and more so their different responses to inflammation-resolving drug targets have complicated its utility for improving antiatherosclerosis strategies. Gene expression studies along with clinical data sets in atherosclerosis may jointly be used to develop polygenic risk scores which can offer risk-stratified quantitative measures for specific immunophenotypes."
