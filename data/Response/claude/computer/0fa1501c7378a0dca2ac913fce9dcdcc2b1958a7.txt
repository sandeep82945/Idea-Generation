 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on text-and-shape guided 3D human avatar generation:

1. Extend the framework to generate animated avatars by incorporating temporal consistency losses and modeling avatar motions over time. This could enable generating vivid and lively avatar animations from text prompts.

2. Investigate conditional normalizing flows or VAEs to model a latent space for avatars. Sampling from this latent space could allow generating diverse avatars with high variability.

3. Explore alternative shape representations beyond SMPL, such as FLAME or GHUM, to provide more detailed face and hand modeling for higher quality avatar generation. 

4. Study how to effectively transfer textures from 2D images to 3D avatars while preserving details, using techniques like neural textures or UV mapping. This could further enhance avatar texture quality.

5. Develop unsupervised or self-supervised training methods to alleviate reliance on large paired text-image datasets. This could help improve generalization and reduce biases inherited from the pretrained models.
