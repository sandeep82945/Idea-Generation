    "abstractText": "Modern engineering technology often involves the physical application of heat and mass transfer. These processes are associated with the creeping motion of a relatively homogeneous swarm of small particles, where the spheroidal geometry represents the shape of the embedded particles within such aggregates. Here, the steady Stokes flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid through an assemblage of particles, at low Reynolds numbers, is studied by employing a particlein-cell model. The mathematical formulation adopts the Kuwabara-type assumption, according to which each spheroidal particle is stationary and it is surrounded by a confocal spheroid that creates a fluid envelope, in which the Newtonian fluid moves with a constant velocity of arbitrary orientation. The boundary value problem in the fluid envelope is solved by imposing non-slip conditions on the surface of the spheroid, which is also considered as non-penetrable, while zero vorticity is assumed on the fictitious spheroidal boundary along with a uniform approaching velocity. The three-dimensional flow fields are calculated analytically for the first time, in the spheroidal geometry, by virtue of the Papkovich\u2013Neuber representation. Through this, the velocity and the total pressure fields are provided in terms of a vector and the scalar spheroidal harmonic potentials, which enables the thorough study of the relevant physical characteristics of the flow fields. The newly obtained analytical expressions generalize to any direction with the existing results holding for the asymmetrical case, which were obtained with the aid of a stream function. These can be employed for the calculation of quantities of physical or engineering interest. Numerical implementation reveals the flow behavior within the fluid envelope for different geometrical cell characteristics and for the arbitrarily-assumed velocity field, thus reflecting the different flow/porous media situations. Sample calculations show the excellent agreement of the obtained results with those available for special geometrical cases. All of these findings demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method and the powerfulness of the obtained analytical expansions.",

Introduction\nFlow around particles and fluid-particle interactions are encountered in many processes in physics, engineering, biology and medicine, such as sedimentation, fluidization, flow in granular porous media, flow of colloids of dilute emulsions through porous media and suspensions of living cells. The analytical determination of the flow field in these cases is important, as it enables the calculation of physical quantities of engineering interest, such as the vorticity field, the drag force acting on each particle and the macroscopic pressure gradient. Moreover, they can be used for the modelling of heat and mass transport phenomena, such as adsorption, diffusion and reaction. When the viscous characteristics of\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14010170 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 2 of 19\nan incompressible flow dominate the inertial ones, the flow is creeping, which is indicated by a Reynolds number smaller than unity. Assuming a steady state, the governing Navier\u2013 Stokes equation reduces to the known system of partial differential equations, namely, Stokes equations (1851), where the solenoidal vector velocity is connected to the scalar pressure field [1]. Flow problems involving small particles, are often modelled with the aid of the concept of the swarm of particles. Very often, these particles are assumed to be spherical. The flow, therefore, is considered to be axisymmetric, which provides a very good approximation [2]. Consequently, reducing the 3D problem to a two-dimensional one is allowed. Then, a scalar function is introduced, namely, a stream function, which is the solution of a fourth order elliptic-type partial differential equation [3,4] that describes the incompressible creeping axisymmetric flow. By using the stream function, the velocity field and the macroscopic pressure field can be calculated in a straight-forward manner. In order to provide a more realistic description, many early researchers assumed that the particles were spheroids or ellipsoids and were able to provide particular solutions in some cases. However, in 1994, Dassios et al. [5], employed the generalized eigenfunctions theory and introduced the concept of semi-separation of variables to derive, for the first time, the complete analytical solution for the axisymmetric Stokes equation in spheroidal geometry. The stream function was given through series, the terms of which consist of semi-separable eigenmodes. The Stokes flow fields may also be obtained by using differential representation theory. Papkovich (1932) and Neuber (1934) introduced a general solution where the flow fields are obtained with the aid of harmonic functions [2,6]. The advantage of this type of representation is that it is also applicable to 3D flow problems without imposing any symmetry. It is worth noting that the study of 3D non-axisymmetric flow requires the evaluation of two stream functions. The streamlines for the 3D problem are then given as the intersections of the obtained families of the 2D stream lines, which correspond to constant values for this pair of functions. For the macroscopic study of the flow through a swarm of small particles, analytical expressions for the flow fields are required since meaningful physical quantities can be calculated. To achieve this aim, particle-in-cell models provide suitable machinery. In these models, the flow through the swarm is described by the flow within two unitary cells of the same geometry. The interior cell is considered as being solid and coated by fluid, the outer surface of which represents the second fictitious cell. The assumption of the fictitious boundary denotes the disturbance that causes the existence of the particles in the flow. The solid/fluid fraction of the swarm determines the thickness of the fluid envelope. Thus, the flow through the swarm in the original domain is equivalent to the flow within a single fluid cell. Uchida [7] introduced a cell model for studying the sedimentation of a swarm of spherical particles. In this model, the inner cell is assumed to be spherical and the exterior one is considered to be cubic. While the cubic shape assumption satisfies the space filling requirement, the problem becomes very complicated since different curvilinear coordinate systems have to be employed to describe the inner and outer boundaries. Uchida\u2019s simplified flow solution does not provide good agreement with the data [2]. Using a collocation method, Brenner [8] obtained an accurate solution in this geometry. Happel [9] and Kuwabara [10] proposed particle-in-cell models in which both the inner and the outer cells are spherical. This assumption imposes axisymmetry and due to this advantage, a closed-form analytical solution is readily obtained. The main difference between these models lies in the assumed relative fluid\u2013particle movement. The Happel model [9] assumes a quiescent fluid and that the inner sphere moves at a constant velocity, while the Kuwabara model [10] assumes the inner sphere is stationary and the fluid flow passes through the exterior cell with the same constant velocity imposed for the main stream. In addition to the adjustments that these two different flow considerations impose on the boundary conditions, the two aforementioned models also differ in the energy balance assumptions on the exterior cell. Specifically, the Happel-type model assumes that there is no shear stress on it, while the Kuwabara model considers that zero vorticity reflects two different situations, i.e., the\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 3 of 19\nself-sufficiency of the model in regard to mechanical energy and it allows the exchange of mechanical energy between the cell and the environment. These differences have to be taken into account in modelling physical and engineering problems. A more realistic approach to the study of flow through porous media was proposed by Neale and Nader [11], who considered the unit cell to be encapsulated within an unbounded porous medium, and assumed continuous, homogeneous and isotropic permeability that is identical to that of the swarm of spheres. Slip boundary conditions on the unit cell have been proposed in relation to the flow of micropolar fluids. Faltas and Saad [12] investigated Stokes flow past an assemblage of slip eccentric spherical-in-cell models, while Sherief et al. studied the Stokes flow of a micropolar fluid past an assemblage of spheroidal-in-cell model with slip boundary conditions [13] and the interaction between two rigid spheres [14]. Recently, Madasu [15] studied the problem of an incompressible axisymmetric creeping flow caused by a porous spherical particle in a spherical cavity filled with micropolar fluid with both Happel and Kuwabara conditions. Due to the difficulties encountered in the analytical derivation of Stokes flow for non-spherical geometries, the spherical in-cell model remained the preferred model for almost 150 years, yielding a closed-form analytical expansion for the stream function and the pressure field, while problems in non-spherical geometries were mainly treated numerically. For example, Epstein and Masliyah [16] considered spheroidal-shaped particles and solved the creeping flow problem in an unbounded porous medium numerically, since no analytical expression could be derived for the stream function in the spheroidal coordinates. Dassios et al. [5,17] derived generalized eigenfunctions and introduced complete semiseparable solutions for the stream function in the prolate and the oblate spheroidal geometry expanding the spherical particle-in-cell model to axisymmetric geometries. The solution for the Stokes flow problem through the swarm of particles was obtained by applying either Kuwabara or Happel boundary conditions. Recently, Hadjinicolaou and Protopapas [18], used an inversion method to derive the analytical solution for the Stokes flow within two inverted spheroidal cells and modelled the blood plasma flow through red blood cells. Their solution employed the R-semi-separation method, which they had introduced previously [19]. Furthermore, Vafeas and Dassios [20], by employing the Papkovich\u2013Neuber differential representation as it applies to the Stokes flow and also a Happel-type ellipsoid-in-cell model, obtained the velocity field and total pressure field in terms of harmonic ellipsoidal eigenfunctions. Dassios et al. [21] demonstrated how Papkovich\u2013Neuber representations of the flow fields were correlated to the general solution of Stokes equations in spheroidal geometry. Furthermore, Dassios and Vafeas [22] corroborated the powerfulness and usability of the above 3D Papkovich\u2013Neuber representation by obtaining a closed-form solution for a Happel-type 3D Stokes flow through a swarm of translating and rotating spherical particles. Numerous non-analytical methods can be found in the literature and provide solutions for the flow problem at hand, including Stokesian dynamics [23] or lattice-Boltzmann simulation [24]. These are beyond the scope of the present research and thus are not discussed further. The analytical treatment of the flow problems is of great significance since it enables the analysis of the geometrical and physical characteristics of the flow with Kuwabara-type boundary conditions [25\u201327] and reveals features of the transport process under consideration, e.g., see for instance [28,29]. Specifically, Djedaidi and Nouri [29] provided theoretical evidence for the existence and uniqueness of flow interactions in heterogeneous porous media without using regularization techniques. In the present manuscript, we derived for the first time, an analytical solution of a Stokes flow problem assuming a uniform, induced velocity field in a prolate spheroidal fluid cell, arbitrarily orientated, thus overcoming any limitations imposed by the axisymmetric assumptions. Therefore, we used a particle-in-cell model and the Papkovich\u2013Neuber representation instead of the semi-separation method, which provided useful analytical expansions for the velocity and the total pressure. This is a generalization of the results\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 4 of 19\nobtained in [17] since we derived the analytical solution representing the flow of a swarm of prolate particles in 3D instead of the corresponding axisymmetric creeping flow, which represents a 2D flow. The special cases of the needle, the disk, the oblate spheroid and the sphere can be derived from the finalized results by choosing the appropriate values of the spheroidal parameters. The prolate spheroidal coordinate system and its analysis [30] are introduced, and fit our problem perfectly, while the results for the oblate geometry can be easily obtained via a simple transformation. The flow fields assume compact closed-form formulae, given as series expansions in terms of prolate spheroidal harmonic eigenfunctions [31] and the analytical results are subjected to the necessary numerical manipulation, in order to provide plots for the implicated fields. The structure of our manuscript is as follows: in Section 2 we present the fundamental equations and the mathematical development, while in Section 3 we formulate the boundary value problem and derive the analytical solution. In Section 4, we illustrate the obtained results through a variety of graphs of the velocity field, the associate stream lines and the pressure field. In Section 5, a thorough discussion of the research outcomes is given.\n2. Fundamental Equations and Mathematical Development\nThe governing equations of the steady state Stokes flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, around particles encapsulated within a smooth, domain \u2126 ( R3 ) , which is either bounded or unbounded, characterized by dynamic viscosity \u00b5 and mass density \u03c1, are given by the well-known system of partial differential equations [3], which connect the biharmonic velocity field v with the harmonic total pressure field P and assume the form\n\u00b5 \u2206v(r) = \u2207P(r) for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(1)\nand \u2207 \u00b7 v(r) = 0 for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(2)\nGiven the velocity v, the vorticity renders \u03c9 = \u2207\u00d7 v, which reveals that \u03c9 is also a harmonic function. Equation (1) states that, in Stokes flow, at any material point of the fluid, there is a balance between the force caused by the pressure gradient and the viscous force. Equation (2) denotes that the velocity field is solenoidal, assuring the incompressibility of the fluid. Given a fixed positive number c > 0, which specifies the semi-focal distance of our system and by virtue of the variables \u03c4 \u2208 [1,+\u221e), \u03b6 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] and \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), we define the transformed prolate spheroidal coordinates [30] as\nx1 = c \u221a \u03c42 \u2212 1 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 cos \u03d5, x2 = c \u221a \u03c42 \u2212 1 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 sin \u03d5 and x3 = c\u03c4\u03b6 (3)\nspecifying any material point r = x1x\u03021 + x2x\u03022 + x3x\u03023. The outward unit normal vector on the surface of any spheroid \u03c4 = constant is given via the Cartesian basis by\n^ n = 1\u221a \u03c42 \u2212 \u03b62\n( \u03c4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 cos \u03d5x\u03021 + \u03c4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 sin \u03d5x\u03022 + \u221a \u03c42 \u2212 1\u03b6x\u03023 )\n(4)\nwhere the expression ( \u03c42 \u2212 \u03b62 ) , appearing at the denominator of Equation (4) is always bounded away from zero for all points on or exterior to the surface of the prolate spheroid. Papkovich\u2013Neuber [2] proposed the following three-dimensional differential representation of the solution for Stokes flow, in terms of the harmonic potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8, i.e.,\nv(r) = \u03a6(r)\u2212 1 2 \u2207[r \u00b7\u03a6(r) + \u03a8(r)] for r \u2208 \u2126\n( R3 )\n(5)\nand P(r) = \u2212\u00b5 \u2207 \u00b7\u03a6(r) for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(6)\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 5 of 19\nwith \u2206\u03a6(r) = 0 and \u2206\u03a8(r) = 0 for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(7)\nwhere in prolate spheroidal coordinates, the involved differential operators\n\u2207 = 1 c \u221a \u03c42 \u2212 \u03b62\n[\u221a \u03c42 \u2212 1\u03c4\u0302 \u2202 \u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62\u03b6\u0302 \u2202 \u2202\u03b6 ] +\n1\nc \u221a \u03c42 \u2212 1 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 \u03d5\u0302 \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 (8)\nand\n\u2206 = 1\nc2(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03b62)\n{ \u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n[( \u03c42 \u2212 1 ) \u2202 \u2202\u03c4 ] + \u2202 \u2202\u03b6 [( 1\u2212 \u03b62 ) \u2202 \u2202\u03b6 ]} + 1 c2(\u03c42 \u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u03b62) \u22022 \u2202\u03d52 (9)\nstand for the gradient and the Laplacian, respectively, while \u03c4\u0302 (which matches ^ n from Equation (4)), \u03b6\u0302 and \u03d5\u0302 denote the unit coordinate vectors of the system. In view of the definition of the associated Legendre functions of the first Pmn and of the second Qmn kind [31], we introduce the regular on the axis of symmetry (at \u03b6 = \u00b11) of the prolate spheroid interior and exterior harmonic eigenfunctions of degree n \u2265 0 and of order m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n\num(q)n,int (r) = P m n (\u03c4)Y m(q) n (\u03b6, \u03d5) and u m(q) n,ext(r) = Q m n (\u03c4)Y m(q) n (\u03b6, \u03d5) for r \u2208 \u2126\n( R3 )\n(10)\nrespectively, wherein\nYm(q)n (\u03b6, \u03d5) = Pmn (\u03b6) f (q) m (\u03d5) with f (q) m (\u03d5) = { cos m\u03d5, q = e sin m\u03d5, q = o , m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n (11)\nfor n \u2265 0, denoting the even (e) and the odd (o) parts of the potentials.

Therefore, the domain of interest is now defined by\n\u2126 ( R3 ) = { (\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5) : \u03c4 \u2208 [ \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 ] , \u03b6 \u2208 [\u22121, 1], \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) } (27)\nThe applied boundary conditions are similar to those in the Kuwabara-type particlein-cell model [10], which yield\nv(\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b6, \u03d5) = 0 on S\u03b1 : \u03c4 = \u03c4\u03b1 (28)\nv ( \u03c4\u03b2, \u03b6, \u03d5 ) \u00b7 \u03c4\u0302 ( \u03c4\u03b2, \u03b6, \u03d5 ) = \u2212U \u00b7 \u03c4\u0302 ( \u03c4\u03b2, \u03b6, \u03d5 ) = \u2212 1\u221a\n\u03c42\u03b2\u2212\u03b62\n( U1\u03c4\u03b2 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 cos \u03d5 + U2\u03c4\u03b2 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b62 sin \u03d5 + U3 \u221a \u03c42\u03b2 \u2212 1\u03b6 ) \u2261 g(\u03b6, \u03d5) on S\u03b2 : \u03c4 = \u03c4\u03b2 (29)\nand \u03c9 ( \u03c4\u03b2, \u03b6, \u03d5 ) = 0 on S\u03b2 : \u03c4 = \u03c4\u03b2 (30)\nEquation (28) expresses the non-slip flow condition, while the non-homogeneous relationship in Equation (29) implies that there is a flow across the boundary of the fluid envelope S\u03b2, the second equality being the outcome of the inner product of Equation (4) with Equation (26), resulting in the known function, g(\u03b6, \u03d5). Furthermore, in compliance to Kuwabara\u2019s model, the vorticity on the external spheroid is assumed to vanish, as it is shown in Equation (30). This completes the formulation of a well-defined boundary value problem. At this point, we must to make an important note. As is easily observed from Equations (19)\u2013(21), in order to identify them, we have to calculate four sets of scalar coefficients from the application of the boundary condition on the interior spheroidal surface and four sets of scalar coefficients from the application of the boundary condition on the exterior spheroidal surface, which makes eight sets of unknowns in total. However, the boundary conditions from Equations (28)\u2013(30) offer us three, plus one, plus three, that is, seven scalar relations, meaning that we need one more condition so that the problem is wellposed. This disadvantage is cancelled due to the flexibility of the differential representation theory. In detail, since the Papkovich\u2013Neuber general solution uses four potentials (one vector and one scalar) to describe the three-component vector velocity field, we are left with a certain degree of freedom in selecting the unknown constant coefficients that correspond to the potentials, which will provide us with the eighth missing condition, conveniently chosen according to physics or/and mathematics (e.g., see [24] for the applicability of this aspect). Analogous results for the oblate spheroidal geometry [31] can be easily obtained through the simple transformation\n\u03c4 \u2192 i\u03bb and c\u2192 \u2212ic (31)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2261 sinh\u03b7 < +\u221e and c > 0 are the characteristic variables of the oblate spheroidal system. On the other hand, the limiting case of the needle can be recovered by a prolate spheroid, where 0 < a2 = a1 a3 < +\u221e and 0 < b2 = b1 b3 < +\u221e, while in the case where 0 < a2 a1 = a3 < +\u221e and 0 < b2 b1 = b3 < +\u221e, the oblate spheroid becomes a circular disk. Finally, the sphere corresponds to the values a1 = a2 = a3 = a and b1 = b2 = b3 = b, where a, b > 0 are the radii of the concentric spheres that correspond to the Kuwabara spherical particle-in-cell model.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 9 of 19\nIn order to mathematically manipulate the boundary conditions from Equations (28)\u2013(30) in an easy manner, we project the vector velocity and vorticity fields from Equations (18) or (19) and (21) to the prolate spheroidal basis via\nv(r) = [\u03c4\u0302 \u00b7 v(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5)]\u03c4\u0302 + [ \u03b6\u0302 \u00b7 v(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5) ] \u03b6\u0302 + [\u03d5\u0302 \u00b7 v(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5)]\u03d5\u0302 for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(32)\nand \u03c9(r) = [\u03c4\u0302 \u00b7\u03c9(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5)]\u03c4\u0302 + [ \u03b6\u0302 \u00b7\u03c9(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5) ] \u03b6\u0302 + [\u03d5\u0302 \u00b7\u03c9(\u03c4, \u03b6, \u03d5)]\u03d5\u0302 for r \u2208 \u2126 ( R3 )\n(33)\nrespectively, while the pressure field is given by the expansion of Equation (20), all the above relations are valid in view of Equations (17) and (23)\u2013(25). Thus, taking into account the results of Equations (32) and (33), we proceed to the application of the pre-mentioned boundary conditions, which provides us with seven independent scalar conditions, particularly, three from Equation (28) for k = 1, 2, 3, one from Equation (29) for k = 4 and three from Equation (30) for k = 5, 6, 7 that have to be supplemented by the missing eighth fictitious condition for k = 8, according to the flexibility of the Papkovich\u2013Neuber differential representation, as discussed earlier.

In doing so, we manage to transfer the difficulty of solving Equation (35) with Equations (36)\u2013(61) to a simple calculation of the integrals in Equations (64) and (65), henceforth, substituting Equations (62) and (63) with (64) and (65) into (35) and taking advantage of the orthogonality relationship in Equation (12), we come up with the set of relationships\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0\nn\n\u2211 m=0 \u2211 q=e,o  8\u2211 jp=1 Fm/m \u2032(q/q\u2032),k n/n\u2032 ,jp Cm(q)n,jp  = \u03b4k,4Gm\u2032(q\u2032)n\u2032 , n\u2032 \u2265 0, m\u2032 = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n\u2032 and q\u2032 = e, o, (66) where Equation (66) stands for eight separate conditions for each k = 1, 2, . . . , 8.

Thereupon, the flow fields follow from Equations (19)\u2013(21) with (22), where the relationships of Equations (23)\u2013(25) are readily incorporated.\n4. Numerical Implementation\nIn this section, we apply the obtained results to a particular spheroidal cell in order to demonstrate the three-dimensional vector velocity field, its two-dimensional intersectional mapping on the coordinate planes and the pressure field on every axis. The numerical implementation is based upon the use of the Cartesian coordinate system (x1, x2, x3), so that the velocity field of Equation (19) is translated in Cartesian geometry as v = (v1, v2, v3), defining v1 = v1(x1, x2, x3), v2 = v2(x1, x2, x3), v3 = v3(x1, x2, x3) and the total pressure field in Equation (20) is assumed to yield P = P(x1, x2, x3), all these expressions use the coefficients derived from Equation (66) and by virtue of the definitions from Equation (34). Additionally, in what follows, each field or physical property is provided in SI units, which we do not show for reasons of writing convenience and clarity. In order to represent the swarm of particles, we choose the solid volume fraction \u03b3 of the cell to be equal to that of the swarm. We recall that both of the surfaces S\u03b1 and S\u03b2 are confocal and c is their common semi-focal distance. As stated previously, we denote a3 as the long and a1 = 1 as the short semi-axis of the solid internal prolate spheroid, and b3 as the long and b1 as the short semi-axis of the outer prolate spheroid [5], which satisfies\n\u03c4\u03b1 = a3 c =\n\u221a 1 + c2\nc2 and \u03c4\u03b2 = b3 c\n(69)\nwhile a3 = \u03b3b21b3 = \u03b3 ( b23 \u2212 c2 ) b3 (70)\nTherefore, solving Equation (70) with respect to b3, we arrive at\nb3 =  [ a3 2\u03b3 + \u221a( a3 2\u03b3 )2 \u2212 ( c2 3 )3]1/3 + [ a3 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u221a( a3 2\u03b3 )2 \u2212 ( c2 3 )3]1/3 , if c2 \u2264 c20 2 \u221a\n3c 3 cos [ 1 3 + cos ( 3 \u221a 3a3 2\u03b3c3 )] , if c2 \u2265 c20\n(71)\nwhere,\nc20 = 3 (\na3 2\u03b3\n)2/3 =\n3 \u03b3\ncos (\ncos\u22121 \u03b3 3\n) (72)\nwhich provides the necessary prerequisites for the proceeding numerical elaboration of the produced results. To plot the graphs of the fields, we have to calculate the constant coefficients, given in Equation (34), of the series expansion of the velocity and the pressure field. We solve the\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 13 of 19\nsystem (Equation (67)) using cut-off techniques assuming N = 1, which leads to a linear quadratic system of 48 unknowns and equations. Furthermore, without loss of generality and for computational convenience, we assume a simple linear form for \u03c6m(q)n,jp (\u03b6, \u03d5) = \u03d5 with jp = 1, 2, . . . , 8, where \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] and U = (1, 2, 3) are the arbitrarily orientated and uniformly approaching velocity, while \u00b5 = 1 stands for the dynamic viscosity. On that account, each graph that follows (see for instance Figures 1\u201311 in the sequel), is drawn by taking a3 = 3 and \u03b3 = 0.05, so that \u03c4\u03b1 = 1.1, \u03c4\u03b2 = 1.6 and c = 2.8. Therein, the velocity field and the streamlines are plotted in the bounded region, wherein x1, x2, x3 \u2208 [\u22125, 5]. In particular, in Figure 1, we demonstrate the velocity field in a 3D frame and in Figures 2\u201310, we present pairs of graphs (the vector plot and the corresponding streamlines) for all the combinations of any two of the velocity components vi, vj for i, j = 1, 2, 3 and i < j on each coordinate plane x2x3 (for x1 = 0), x1x3 (for x2 = 0) and x1x2 (for x3 = 0).

In the sequel, by analyzing the vector plots given in Figures 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a and 10a, we can verify the conclusion obtained from Figure 1 that the choice of the approaching velocity affects the velocity field, since in most of these figures in which x3-axis is employed, the velocity vectors are directed towards the x3-axis. More precisely, from Figures 2a, 3a and 4a, we see that the vector field created by the vectors v1, v2 is symmetric in the fluid envelope area because the velocity component v3 is bigger than the others, so it dominates in the velocity field. On the other hand, comparing Figures 5a and 6a, we see that the vector components v1, v3 create a field, which is strong for the positive values of x3, a result that is valid for the vector components v2, v3, given in Figure 8a. On the contrary, the velocity field for v2, v3 in Figure 9a shows that the vectors are of almost equal measure in the plane x2 = 0. Moreover, from Figures 2a, 5a and 8a, we can observe the velocity fields that occur for two of the velocity\u2019s components in the plane x2x3 and we deduce that the velocity component v2 is the one that contributes the least. The velocity components vi, vj for i, j = 1, 2, 3 and i < j in the plane x1x3 are presented in Figures 3a, 6a and 9a, and show that the vectors of equal measure in most cases, except for the negative values of x3 for v1, v3 in Figure 6a, where the measures are smaller. In the plane x3 = 0, we see that the field created by v1, v2 is axisymmetric with respect to the x2-axis (Figure 4a), while the field for the components v2, v3 and v1, v3, drawn in Figures 7a and 10a are symmetric with respect to (0, 0). Finally, Figure 11 depicts the variation in the total pressure field with respect to one of the variables x1, x2, x3, setting the other two equal to zero, inside the envelope\u2019s region, where x1, x2 \u2208 (\u22123.49,\u22121.29) \u222a (1.29, 3.49) and x3 \u2208 (\u22124.48,\u22123.1) \u222a (3.1, 4.48). Particularly, from Figure 11a,b we can conclude that the absolute value of the pressure decreases when we are moving away from the solid prolate spheroid into the fluid envelope along the x1-axis or x2-axis, where the pressure fields are axisymmetric. Moreover, the pressure of the fluid envelope is negative on x1-axis and it is approximately zero on the boundary of the fictitious prolate, while it is positive on the x2-axis and it is approximately one on the boundary of the fictitious prolate. In Figure 11c, we see that the pressure in the x3-axis in not axisymmetric and it is increasing in the lowest area of the fluid envelope (from the exterior to the interior prolate spheroid), while in the upper area, the pressure is increasing from the interior to the exterior prolate spheroid. In both cases, the pressure increases from negative values.\n5. Conclusions and Discussion\nAn analytical methodology for dealing with the problem of Stokes flow through a swarm of spheroidal particles with Kuwabara-type boundary conditions was developed. For the problem at hand, the prolate spheroidal configuration was considered, while the results for the oblate spheroidal case can be readily obtained via a simple complex transformation. Moreover, interesting degenerate cases of the needle, disk and the limiting case of the sphere can be derived just by setting suitable values to the geometrical parameters that enter into the flow fields\u2019 expressions. For example, the case of the sphere is taken as the semifocal distance c tends to zero and the semi-axis ratio \u03b13/\u03b11 goes towards unity, while the needle case is taken as the semi-axis ratio becomes much bigger than one. The conducted research was based on the reliable particle-in-cell technique by which the creeping flow through the swarm of the spheroidal particles is modelled as flow within a fluid envelope that surrounds a single solid particle and attains a fictitious spheroidal boundary, which expresses the disturbance to the flow that causes the rest of the particles of the assemblage and the volume of the fluid envelope to match the fluid volume fraction of the swarm. Hence, in view of the Kuwabara model, which assumes an arbitrarily moving fluid around a motionless particle, the non-slip flow condition on the surface of the inner\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 170 18 of 19\nspheroid was supplemented by the boundary conditions on the outer spheroidal surface, i.e., the zero normal velocity component and vorticity. Under the low Reynolds hydrodynamic consideration, the fundamental differential representation of Papkovich\u2013Neuber for Stokes flow was used and the non-axisymmetric flow fields were obtained in terms of easy-to-handle harmonic functions. The difficulty of this problem emerges in the determination of the unknown coefficients, which reveal inherent characteristics of the corresponding potentials. This difficulty was caused by the appearance of particular indeterminacies depicting the complexity of the spheroidal geometry. On that account, the flexibility of the particular general solution was demonstrated by imposing appropriate additional conditions, which made the calculations feasible. In particular, the aforementioned boundary conditions, enriched by the additional set of equations that were imposed due the degrees of freedom that the Papkovich\u2013Neuber representation offered us, led to a set of equations, defined on the surfaces of the two spheroids. Therein, the application of standard orthogonality arguments created a linear system for the unknown constant coefficients, which were solved incrementally via cut-off techniques. Evidently, the application of the representation theory, combined with the imposed conditions, offered closed-form expressions for the flow fields under consideration as series expansions of prolate spheroidal harmonic eigenfunctions. The analytical formulae of the velocity and the pressure field were numerically implemented using cut-off techniques. For computational convenience, N was set equal to 1 and all the arbitrary functions \u03c6m(q)n,jp (\u03b6, \u03d5) with jp = 1, 2, . . . , 8 given in (61), were set equal to \u03d5. Consequently, it is obvious that advanced analytical or semi-analytical solutions in fluid dynamics are quite valuable tools for the assessment of the validity of numerical methods and solutions. In addition, bearing in mind that very important physical laws are expressed through analytical formulation, the necessity of tackling problems with a credible mathematical basis is obvious. In our view, there is always a need for these types of analytical methods, which can coexist with pure numerical techniques that aim to provide solutions to problems arising in the aforementioned physical applications. In this respect, work in progress involves the utilization of the differential representation theory in solving such non-axisymmetric boundary value problems in more complicated geometries, such as ellipsoidal, bi-spherical, toroidal, etc., wherein randomly-shaped particles in porous media can be depicted more effectively.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.V., E.P. and M.H.; methodology, P.V., E.P. and M.H.; writing\u2014original draft, P.V., E.P. and M.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.V., E.P. and M.H.
