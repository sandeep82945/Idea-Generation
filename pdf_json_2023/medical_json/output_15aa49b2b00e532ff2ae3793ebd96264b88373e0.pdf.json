    "abstractText": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health concern in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. Previous studies have implied that ambient air pollution may affect the incidence of HFMD, but the results among different regions are inconsistent. We aimed to deepen the understanding of the associations between air pollutants and HFMD by conducting a multicity study. Daily data on childhood HFMD counts and meteorological and ambient air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, and SO2) concentrations in 21 cities in Sichuan Province from 2015 to 2017 were collected. A spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework was established, and then a distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) was constructed to reveal exposure-lag-response relationships between air pollutants and HFMD while controlling for spatiotemporal effects. Furthermore, given the differences in the levels and seasonal trends of air pollutants between the basin region and plateau region, we explored whether these associations varied between different areas (basin and plateau). The associations between air pollutants and HFMD were nonlinear, with different lag responses. Low NO2 concentrations and both low and high PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of HFMD. No significant associations between CO, O3, and SO2 and HFMD were found. The associations between air pollutant concentrations and HFMD were different between the basin and plateau regions. Our study revealed associations between PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations and HFMD, deepening the understanding of the relationships between air pollutants and HFMD. These findings provide evidence to support the formulation of relevant prevention measures and the establishment of an early warning system.",

            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major public health concern in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. Previous studies have implied that ambient air pollution may affect the incidence of HFMD, but the results among different regions are inconsistent. We aimed to deepen the understanding of the associations between air pollutants and HFMD by conducting a multicity study. Daily data on childhood HFMD counts and meteorological and ambient air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, and SO2) concentrations in 21 cities in Sichuan Province from 2015 to 2017 were collected. A spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework was established, and then a distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) was constructed to reveal exposure-lag-response relationships between air pollutants and HFMD while controlling for spatiotemporal effects. Furthermore, given the differences in the levels and seasonal trends of air pollutants between the basin region and plateau region, we explored whether these associations varied between different areas (basin and plateau). The associations between air pollutants and HFMD were nonlinear, with different lag responses. Low NO2 concentrations and both low and high PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of HFMD. No significant associations between CO, O3, and SO2 and HFMD were found. The associations between air pollutant concentrations and HFMD were different between the basin and plateau regions. Our study revealed associations between PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations and HFMD, deepening the understanding of the relationships between air pollutants and HFMD. These findings provide evidence to support the formulation of relevant prevention measures and the establishment of an early warning system.\nHand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a worldwide public health issue, has become a predominant communicable disease in the Asia\u2013Pacific region during the last two decades1,2. With the highest annual number of disability-adjusted life-years (96 900) in the world and more than one million cases reported each year, China has had one of the highest HFMD disease burdens since 20083\u20135. HFMD is an acute infection in childhood caused by various enteroviruses6. Although most patients experience only mild clinical manifestations, some patients may develop severe neurological complications and even die7. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for HFMD, and licensed vaccines are effective for only enterovirus 718. Hence, preventing HFMD with public health-related measures is important. Considering the substantial threat to child health, identifying risk factors is urgent for the prevention of HFMD.\nThe adverse health effects associated with ambient air pollution have prompted increasing concern in recent decades due to its substantial contribution to the global burden of disease9. Recently, some studies have implied that ambient air pollution may affect the incidence of HFMD10\u201317. Most previous studies employed time-series analyses, such as distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), according to the nonlinear and lagged associations\nOPEN\n1West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. 2Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. 3Yunnan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Kunming, Yunnan, China. 4These authors contributed equally: Jian Qian and Caiying Luo. *email: gordonrozen@qq.com; 67637539@qq.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nbetween air pollutant concentrations and HFMD18. However, such studies were carried out in single cities, and the associations among different regions were inconsistent in shape and magnitude. For example, Gu et\u00a0al. indicated an approximately J-shaped association between the NO2 concentration and HFMD in Ningbo city, whereas Liu et\u00a0al. found an inverted V-shaped association in Shijiazhuang city12,13. A study in Guilin city showed that a low PM2.5 concentration (1st vs. median) decreased the risk of HFMD, while another study in Shenzhen city found no significant association between PM2.5 concentration and HFMD15,16. Such inconsistencies indicate spatial heterogeneity among different regions, especially regions with different socioeconomic characteristics and air pollution levels. Hence, to attain a more comprehensive understanding of the associations between air pollution concentrations and HFMD, a study accounting for spatial heterogeneity should be carried out in multiple locations. To our knowledge, only one published study on the associations between air pollutant concentrations and HFMD in Shenzhen city accounted for such spatial effects with a spatiotemporal Bayesian model19. However, this study did not consider the nonlinear and lag associations between air pollution concentrations and HFMD. Moreover, the between-site variability in Shenzhen city was limited. To reveal the nonlinear and lag associations, the DLNM can be introduced into the spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model, which simultaneously assesses exposure- and lag-response associations between air pollutants and HFMD with adjustments for spatiotemporal effects20,21.\nSichuan Province has a high HFMD disease burden, with a total of 449 485 HFMD cases reported from 2011 to 201722. Furthermore, Sichuan Province is one of China\u2019s most air-polluted areas23. Therefore, to reveal more comprehensive and general associations of air pollutant concentrations with HFMD, we conducted a spatiotemporal study in 21 cities in Sichuan Province. Specifically, we employed a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework based on the daily number of pediatric HFMD cases in 21 cities in Sichuan Province from 2015 to 2017. By incorporating the DLNM, we assessed the exposure-lag-response associations of air pollutants with HFMD after controlling for spatiotemporal effects. Furthermore, given the differences in the levels and seasonal trends of air pollution between the basin region and plateau region in Sichuan Province, we explored whether the associations between air pollutant concentrations and HFMD varied between the different areas (basin and plateau)."

On 89%, 68%, and 59% of the days, the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exceeded the values recommended by the World Health\nrespectively.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nOrganization, respectively (WHO 2021). The concentration of SO2 in the plateau region was higher than that in the basin region, while the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were much lower in the plateau region (Table\u00a01).\nMonthly HFMD cases are presented in Fig.\u00a01a. The number of HFMD cases in Sichuan Province exhibited a seasonal trend with two peaks per year: one from approximately April to July and the other from approximately October to December. The monthly distributions of air pollutants are illustrated in Fig.\u00a01b\u2013f. PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO concentrations had similar trends, with higher values in winter and lower values in summer (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013e), while O3 presented the opposite trend (Fig.\u00a01f). No distinct trend was observed for SO2 (Fig.\u00a01g). In addition, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations in the plateau region presented no significant seasonal trends. Figure\u00a02 (left) shows the annual RRs of HFMD for the 21 cities from 2015 to 2017. We obtained these estimations by fitting the spatiotemporal model without explanatory variables. Overall, the region with the highest risk of HFMD was the central region of Sichuan Province, and the highest RR was found in Chengdu City in 2015 (5.16, 95%CI 4.13\u20137.64). Figure\u00a02 (right) displays the annual RRs with the air pollutants included in the model. These results indicate that most cities still have an excessive risk of HFMD, which cannot be explained by air pollution. But the RR of HFMD has also changed in some cities, for example, the RR of HFMD in Aba Prefecture in 2015 changed from 0.50 (95%CI 0.29\u20130.88) to 0.99 (95%CI 0.57\u20131.73) after including air pollutants.\nFigure\u00a01. Heatmaps of (a) monthly HFMD cases (standardized by the number of annual cases), (b) average PM2.5, (c) average PM10, (d) average NO2, (e) average CO, (f) average O3, and (g) average SO2 concentrations. The figure was generated by the R software version 4.0.3 (https:// www.r- proje ct. org/).\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nAccording to the DIC results, the df l in the lag dimension for all six air pollutants were set to 3. And the df v in the exposure dimension for O3 and PM2.5 were set to 4, while the other air pollutants were set to 3 (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S1 and S2). Figure\u00a03 shows the associations of air pollutants at the 1st and 99th percentiles with HFDM across the lag period. These effects of low and high concentrations of air pollutants on HFMD on different lag days mainly decrease the relative risk. The most significant negative effects are the 99th percentiles of PM2.5 and PM10 during 0\u20139 lag days and 0\u201311 lag days, respectively. And the lowest relative risks of the 99th percentiles of PM2.5 and PM10 are 0.92 (95%CI 0.91\u20130.94) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.90\u20130.94) on lag 3\u00a0day and lag 0\u00a0day, respectively. However, the 1st percentile of O3 increases the relative risk during 6\u201311 lag days, the highest relative risk is 1.03 (95CI 1.01\u20131.05) on lag 9\u00a0day. Besides, only the 99th percentiles of SO2 and NO2 found no significant associations with HFMD across the entire 0\u201314\u00a0days lag period. Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1 indicates the exposure-lag-response relationships between air pollutants and HFMD during the 0\u201314\u00a0days lag period. Overall, the associations of air pollutant concentrations with HFMD were nonlinear, and the lag structures were markedly different. For instance, a low PM10 (32\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) concentration decreased the risk of HFMD over the 0\u201314\u00a0days lag period, while a high PM10 concentration increased the risk of HFMD at lag 13\u201314\u00a0days.\nFigure\u00a04 illustrates the cumulative association of air pollutant concentrations with HFMD over the 14\u00a0days lag period, and the median of each air pollutant was selected as the reference value. The results indicated similar associations between PM2.5 and PM10, and HFMD, with approximately inverted V-shaped curves (Fig.\u00a04a,b). The cumulative RR initially increased with increasing air pollutant concentrations and then decreased, peaking at 29.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 and 54.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, respectively. A low NO2 concentration (< 50th percentile) showed a positive association with HFMD (Fig.\u00a04c). No significant associations were found between CO, O3 and SO2 and HFMD.\nFigure\u00a02.

Both the exposure\u2013response and lag-response relationships between air pollutants and HFMD among the two regions were markedly different. For example, a high PM2.5 concentration (105 \u03bcg/m3) was associated with a decreased risk (RR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.97\u20130.99) of HFMD at lag day 10 in the basin region. In the plateau region, a high PM25 concentration (105 \u03bcg/m3) was associated with an increased risk (RR = 1.16, 95%CI 1.03\u20131.34) of HFMD at lag day 10.\nFigure\u00a03.

            "text": "In this study, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis in 21 cities in Sichuan Province. By introducing the DLNM into the spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework, we assessed the exposure- and lag-response associations of air pollutants with HFMD after adjustments for spatiotemporal effects, which revealed a more general association between air pollutant concentrations and HFMD. The introduction of spatial effects in this study allowed a more precise estimation of the associations than could be obtained with two-stage time-series analysis24, which is usually employed to pool multilocation estimations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2). The cumulative exposure\u2013response associations indicated that low NO2 and both low and high PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of HFMD. However, no significant associations between CO, O3 and SO2 concentrations and HFMD were observed.\nThe exact mechanisms of these associations remain unclear to date, but the effect of air pollutants on HFMD transmission may be due to the fact that air pollutants change people\u2019s behavior and their susceptibility to enteroviruses. A reasonable explanation for the inverted V-shaped associations of PM2.5 and PM10 with HFMD is that particles mater may initially increase the risk of HFMD by promoting viral transmission or increasing HFMD susceptibility in children, which has been observed in previous studies13,16. Studies have found that enteroviruses may attach to particles mater in the air that can be inhaled; thus, increasing concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 can increase the risk of HFMD by facilitating transmission25,26. In addition, exposure to fine particles mater triggers an inflammatory response in the body, which may increase the susceptibility of children to HFMD pathogens27. However, people may change their behaviors on days with high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, which decreases the risk of contracting HFMD. For example, on days with serious air pollution, people may alter their behaviors by reducing the time spent performing outdoor activities or wearing masks, which could decrease\nFigure\u00a04. Cumulative associations of air pollutants with HFMD.\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nthe risk of HFMD28,29. Moreover, given that PM2.5 and PM10 are the main air pollutants in the study region, the air quality index value referenced by the local government when issuing air quality warnings mainly reflects the concentrations of PM; thus, the associations of high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were significant. Regarding the association of a low NO2 concentration with an increased risk of HFMD, previous studies found that\nFigure\u00a05. Relationships between air pollutants and HFMD over the 0\u201314\u00a0days lag period in the basin region (left) and plateau region (right).\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nexposure to NO2 may increase the risk of acute respiratory outcomes, such as upper respiratory tract infection and impaired lung function30,31. Therefore, NO2 may increase HFMD susceptibility in children by damaging the respiratory system. However, these hypotheses need to be validated in the future.\nSince the spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model was constructed to investigate the associations of air pollutants with HFMD in our study, city-specific socioeconomic characteristics, such as healthcare access, were adjusted by spatial random effects. Hence, some of the differences in the results between our study and other single-city studies may be attributed to specific socioeconomic characteristics in other study regions. In addition, differences in air pollution levels among different regions could also be a possible reason for these inconsistent associations. For instance, a study in Shenzhen city indicated no significant association of the PM2.5 concentration with HFMD15. A possible reason is that the mean value of PM2.5 in Shenzhen was much lower than that in Sichuan (32.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 vs. 44.8\u00a0\u03bcg/m3). Several previous studies also indicated that the adverse health impacts of air pollutants varied among regions with different air pollution levels32,33. Similarly, a study in Ningbo city found a J-shaped relationship between the NO2 concentration and HFMD, and the mean NO2 concentration in Ningbo was much lower than that in Sichuan (15.2\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 vs. 29.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m3)12. Another study in Shijiazhuang city, which is heavily polluted by NO2, found an inverted V-shaped curve, similar to the results in our study13. For SO2 and O3 concentrations, Gu et\u00a0al. found J-shaped and V-shaped associations with HFMD in Ningbo city, respectively12. However, SO2 and O3 pollution was not serious in Sichuan Province, and the imprecise estimations of high SO2 and O3 concentrations indicated no significant associations. Another possible explanation for the differences in associations could be the seasonal trends of air pollutants. For example, a study in Ningbo city showed no significant association of the PM10 concentration with HFMD34. Although PM10 pollution was heavy in Ningbo, no obvious seasonal PM10 trends were found in Ningbo, which is an industrial city. No significant association between the CO concentration and HFMD was found in our study, which is consistent with the results of previous studies15,35.\nAs expected, the results from the basin region and plateau region were substantially different. There are some possible reasons for these inconsistent results. First, the different associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 with HFMD may be caused by different concentration levels between the two regions. The pollution levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the basin region were higher than those in the plateau region, while SO2 showed the opposite trend. Second, some studies have suggested that the relationships between air pollutants and HFMD may be affected by seasons, and the effects of air pollutants during the cold season are greater than those during the warm season10,17. Therefore, differences in the seasonal trends of air pollutants concentrations may cause different relationships between air pollutants and HFMD. Compared to those in the basin region, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and O3 concentrations showed no significant seasonal trends in the plateau region, which could be a reason for these inconsistent results. In addition, the associations between air pollutants and HFMD may be modified by terrain and climate factors, but investigating these modifying effects was beyond the scope of our study. However, given that there were only three cities in the plateau region, the precision of these estimations needs to be improved. Further studies including more cities in the plateau region are needed.\nThere are some limitations in this study that should be acknowledged. First, CO, O3, and SO2 pollution was not serious in Sichuan Province, which prevented us from revealing associations between these air pollutants and HFMD under high-pollution conditions. Further investigations are needed in regions with high levels of CO, O3, and SO2. Second, this study was carried out in 21 cities in Sichuan Province, which is located in southwest China. Thus, these results cannot be generalized to other areas with different air pollution levels. More investigations are needed in various geographical areas and at larger spatial scales in the future. Third, some important factors of HFMD transmission, such as virus subtypes and other infectious diseases, were not considered in our study due to data limitations36."

All HFMD surveillance data were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The study methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Our study was constructed at the population level. Since all of the patients\u2019 records were anonymized and no individual information could be identified, informed consent was not required.\nStudy region. Sichuan Province is an inland province in Southwest China (26.40\u00b0N\u201333.68\u00b0N and 98.31\u00b0E\u2013107.99\u00b0E) with a population of 8.3 million (in 2017). Sichuan Province consists of 21 cities covering an area of 486 052 km2, and the city-specific socioeconomic characteristics differ. Surrounded by the plateau region in the west, Sichuan Province has a complex terrain (Fig.\u00a06a)23. Due to the differences in the terrain and socioeconomic conditions, there are notable differences in the levels and seasonal trends of air pollutants between the basin region and the plateau region in Sichuan (Fig.\u00a06b).\nData sources. Daily HFMD case numbers in Sichuan Province from 2015 to 2017 were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering that over 99% of the patients with reported HFMD in the study were aged 0\u201314\u00a0years, only cases in those aged 0\u201314\u00a0years were included.\nAir pollution variables, including hourly data of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for each city were collected from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (http:// www. cnemc. cn/). The daily mean concentration of each air pollutant was obtained by calculating the arithmetic mean of the hourly data. Meteorological data for the same period, including mean temperature and mean relative humidity, were provided by the China Meteorological Date Sharing Service System. Daily meteorological data for each city was obtained from 41 meteorological stations\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:3993 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31035-7\nby ordinary kriging interpolation37. The missing values of air pollutants and meteorological variables were filled by linear interpolation38. Since the proportion of missing data was very small (< 1%), its impact on the results can be ignored.\nStatistical analysis. By combining the spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model and the DLNM, we assessed the exposure\u2013response and lag-response associations of air pollutants with HFMD to reveal exposurelag-response relationships after accounting for spatiotemporal effects and observed confounders. A Negative binomial distribution was assumed for daily HFMD cases, and the model was constructed as follows:\nwhere Eit and \u03c1it are the expected number of HFMD cases and relative risk (RR) of HFMD on calendar day t(t = 1, 2, . . . 1096) in city i(i = 1, 2, . . . 21) , respectively; \u03ba is the overdispersion parameter; \u03b1 is the intercept; Mitj is the air pollutant of interest (j = 1, 2, . . . 6) on calendar day t in city i ; cb(.) is a cross-basis function consisting of two natural cubic splines representing the lag- and exposure\u2013response associations, respectively, and the degrees of freedom(df v and df l ) for these spline functions were chosen by sensitivity analysis. The maximum lag period of 14\u00a0days ( L = 14 ) was selected based on previous studies and the incubation time before cases were reported15,39. The spatial effect used a Besag-York-Mollie model, thus the spatial structured random effect \u03c5i was specified as an intrinsic conditional autoregressive process and the spatial unstructured random effect \u03bdi was specified as an exchangeable prior: \u03bdi \u223c Normal(0, \u03c3 2\u03bd ) ; \u03b3t is the temporally structured effect to capture seasonal and long-term trends40; and Xit denotes the other air pollutants and meteorological variables incorporated as confounding factors; a natural cubic spline with 3df and 14-day moving average were set to these confounders. There were six models for the six air pollutants, as only one cross-basis was included in each model to analyze the exposure-lag-response association between the air pollutant and HFMD. Since the RV-coefficient between PM2.5 and PM10 is 0.87 and 0.81 (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3) in the cross-basis function and the natural cubic spline function, respectively. When analyzing the relationship between PM2.5 (PM10) and HFMD, the PM10 (PM2.5) were not included in the model as a confounder.\nWe conducted a stratified analysis by regions, the basin region consists of 17 cities, and the plateau region consists of 3 cities (Fig.\u00a06b). The adjacency-based spatial weighted matrix ( wij in the adjacency matrix is equal to 1 if city i and j are adjacent, but equal to 0 otherwise) in the two subregions was reconstructed based on two different map objects. For instance, in the 21 cities analysis, Aba has five adjacent cities according to the adjacency-based matrix, but there is only one adjacent city in the plateau analysis.\nThe posterior distributions of these parameters were estimated by Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)41. We used the deviance information criterion (DIC) to measure the fit of the model; a smaller DIC value indicates a better fitted model42. The sensitivity analyses were performed considering the following: (1) A time smoother function (a natural cubic spline with 8 df per year) to control the temporal autocorrelations; and (2) the df of the natural cubic spline for both exposure response and lag response were 3\u20137. All analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.3 with the packages \u201cdlnm\u201d, \u201csplines\u201d, and \u201cINLA\u201d.\n(1)Yit \u223c NegBin(Eit \u00b7 \u03c1it , \u03ba)\n(2)log(\u03c1it) = \u03b1 + cb ( Mitj , df v; L, df l ) +\n\u2211\nns(Xit , df )+ \u03c5i + \u03bdi + \u03b3t\nFigure\u00a06.

The results indicated significant associations between PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 concentrations and HFMD, but no significant associations were observed between CO, O3, and SO2 concentrations and HFMD. These findings deepen the understanding of the associations between air pollutants and HFMD and provide evidence supporting the formulation of relevant prevention measures and the establishment of an early warning system."
