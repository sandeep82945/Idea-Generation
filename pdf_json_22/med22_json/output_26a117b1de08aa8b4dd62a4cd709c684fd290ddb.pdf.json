    "abstractText": "Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by follicular dysplasia. An insufficient glycolysis-derived energy supply of granulosa cells (GCs) is an important cause of follicular dysplasia in PCOS. Follicular fluid (FF) exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to regulate the function of GCs. In this study, exosomes extracted from clinical FF samples were used for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, and a human ovarian granulocyte tumour cell line (KGN cells) was used for in vitro mechanistic studies. Methods and results: In FF exosomal RNA-seq analysis, a decrease in glycolysis-related pathways was identified as an important feature of the PCOS group, and the differentially expressed miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p may be regulatory factors of glycolysis. By determining the effects of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p on hexokinase (HK) 2, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), pyruvate, lactate and apoptosis in KGN cells, we found that upregulated miR-143-3p expression in exosomes from the PCOS group inhibited glycolysis in KGN cells; knockdown of miR-143-3p significantly alleviated the decrease in glycolysis in KGN cells in PCOS. MiR-155-5p silencing attenuated glycolytic activation in KGN cells; overexpression of miR-155-5p significantly promoted glycolysis in KGN cells in PCOS. In this study, HK2 was found to be the mediator of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p in FF-derived exosomemediated regulation of glycolysis in KGN cells. Reduced glycolysis accelerated apoptosis of KGN cells, which mediated follicular dysplasia through ATP, lactate and apoptotic pathways. Conclusions: In conclusion, these results indicate that miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p in FF-derived exosomes antagonistically regulate glycolytic-mediated follicular dysplasia of GCs in PCOS. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022, corrected publication 2022.

By determining the effects of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p on hexokinase (HK) 2, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), pyruvate, lactate and apoptosis in KGN cells, we found that upregulated miR-143-3p expression in exosomes from the PCOS group inhibited glycolysis in KGN cells; knockdown of miR-143-3p significantly alleviated the decrease in glycolysis in KGN cells in PCOS. MiR-155-5p silencing attenuated glycolytic activation in KGN cells; overexpression of miR-155-5p significantly promoted glycolysis in KGN cells in PCOS. In this study, HK2 was found to be the mediator of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p in FF-derived exosomemediated regulation of glycolysis in KGN cells. Reduced glycolysis accelerated apoptosis of KGN cells, which mediated follicular dysplasia through ATP, lactate and apoptotic pathways.\nConclusions: In conclusion, these results indicate that miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p in FF-derived exosomes antagonistically regulate glycolytic-mediated follicular dysplasia of GCs in PCOS.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022, corrected publication 2022.

            "text": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease characterized by dysplasia of follicles, sparse ovulation or anovulation, and hyperandrogenaemia in women of childbearing age worldwide and affects up to 10% of women [1]. The prevalence of infertility is up to 70% in patients with PCOS, which is often accompanied by type II diabetes, obesity, and endometrial cancer [2\u20134]. Women with PCOS suffer from widespread depression and anxiety, and PCOS can exert long-term harmful effects on women\u2019s physical and mental health [5]. Although the clinical manifestations and biochemical indicators of patients with PCOS are highly heterogeneous, follicular dysplasia is still a typical feature of PCOS, affecting approximately 10% of infertile women [6].\nFollicular fluid (FF) provides the microenvironment for follicular development, and changes in the follicular microenvironment are the main cause of follicular dysplasia [7]. FF is filled with a variety of vesicles and molecules, including exosomes, which largely contribute to follicular development and ovum maturation [8]. Studies have proven that some nucleic acids and proteins in FF are closely involved in follicular glucose metabolism, lipoprotein metabolism, cell proliferation and other processes in patients with PCOS [9\u201311]. FF-derived exosomes are the main carriers of these nucleic acids and proteins. However, the role of FF-derived exosomes in follicular dysplasia in PCOS remains unknown.\nThe discovery of exosomes as carriers of noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs, largely facilitates the rapid development of exosomes as the transport medium of genetic information in the study of various diseases [12, 13]. Exosomes are highly stable and exist stably in various body fluids or cell culture medium supernatants. Studies have proven that the RNA composition of exosomes is different from that of cells secreting exosomes, but the expression of miRNAs of exosomes and secreting exosomes is highly similar [14\u201316]. In cancer cells, exosomal miRNAs play an important role in signal transmission between cells and can modulate cell migration, cell differentiation, immune response, antigen presentation, tumour invasion and so on [17]. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have been performed to examine the functional role of FF-derived exosomal miRNAs. FF-derived exosomes are mainly secreted by granulosa cells (GCs). Recent studies have demonstrated that FF-derived exosomal miRNAs regulate the function of GCs in patients with PCOS [18]. Energy is the primary condition for follicular\ndevelopment. Several studies have proven that patients with PCOS often have abnormal glucose metabolism, and glycolysis of GCs is the main energy source for follicular development [19]. Lactate, the glycolytic product of GCs, is an environmental stimulus for follicular development, and apoptosis of GCs has been proven to be the main reason for follicular atresia in PCOS [19]. Thus, glycolysis of GCs is crucial for the follicular development of PCOS. At present, studies on the regulatory factors of glycolysis in GCs mainly focus on endocrine hormones, signalling pathways and nonfollicular fluid miRNAs [20\u201322]. To the best of our knowledge, the regulation of glycolysis in GCs by FF-derived exosomal miRNAs has not yet been studied. Therefore, exploring the role of FF-derived exosomal miRNAs may reveal novel mechanisms for follicular dysplasia of PCOS.\nIn this study, exosomes extracted from clinical FF samples were used for transcriptome sequencing analysis, and a human ovarian granulocyte tumour cell line (KGN cells) was used for the in\u00a0 vitro mechanistic studies. In this study, we reveal the proposed potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms by which exosomal miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p antagonize glycolysis in PCOS-related follicular dysplasia. The present study may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of PCOS."

For the PCOS group, the Rotterdam Consensus (2004) was used to define the phenotype of the patients with PCOS who met at least two of the following criteria: (1) sparse ovulation or anovulation (menstruation more than 35\u00a0 days or menstruation less than 8 times per year); (2) signs of hyperandrogenism (evidence of increased circulating total testosterone of more than 45\u00a0ng/dL or hypertrichosis); and (3) polycystic characteristics with more than 12 follicles, all of which were less than 9\u00a0mm in diameter, as shown by ultrasonic monitoring of ovarian morphology. Other causes, such as delayed adrenocortical hyperplasia and adrenal androgen-secreting neoplasms, were excluded. The inclusion criteria of the control\nKeywords: Polycystic ovary syndrome, Exosomes, Glycolysis, miR-143-3p, miR-155-5p, HK2\ngroup were normal ovarian morphology and function, regular menstrual cycle (26\u201335\u00a0 days), normal androgen level (< 45\u00a0ng/dL), and 6\u201310 antrum eggs on both sides. The exclusion criteria for both groups were as follows: age over 35\u00a0 years, ovarian cysts and tumours, history of ovarian surgery or radiotherapy and chemotherapy, endometriosis, hyperprolactin, thyroid dysfunction and chromosomal abnormalities.

The luteinizing hormone, anti-Mullerian hormone, testosterone and sinus follicle numbers in the patients with PCOS were significantly higher than those in the control group.\nThen, we further extracted exosomes from the FF of the patients from the control and PCOS groups. To ensure the quality of the exosomes, we characterized exosomes by using Western blotting, TEM and NTA. The Western blot assay results showed that exosome-positive marker proteins (CD63 and CD9) were expressed in all samples (Fig.\u00a01A). TEM showed that exosomes were disc-shaped vesicles (a diameter of 100\u2013150\u00a0 nm, intact structure and high purity) with clear edges and light staining in the centre (Fig.\u00a01B). The peak diameter of the exosomes measured by NTA was approximately 130\u00a0 nm, and the concentration of exosomes was approximately 8 \u00d7 1010 particles/ml (Fig.\u00a01C).\nRNA sequencing analysis of\u00a0differentially expressed exosomal RNAs From the deep RNA-seq sequencing results, we collected 128,005,498 reads, with > 94.54% base quality scores exceeding Q30 and a crosstalk ratio with the reference genome \u2248 60%.

To verify the reliability of the RNA-seq data, we randomly selected 32 RNAs for qPCR analysis and found that the correlation coefficient of the fold change in gene expression levels between the RNA-seq and RNA-qPCR results was high (R2 = 0.6724, P < 0.001), indicating good reliability of the RNA-seq data (Fig.\u00a02E).\nFF\u2011derived exosomal miRNAs and\u00a0mRNAs regulate glycolysis of\u00a0GCs in\u00a0PCOS Compared with those in the control group, the negative regulation of exosomal RNAs on glycolysis increased significantly in the PCOS group, and the processes related to glycolysis and energy metabolism, such as glucose import and response, protein kinase synthesis and activity, and positive regulation of ATPase activity, decreased significantly (Fig.\u00a0 3A). In addition, there were significantly enriched pathways related to apoptosis, such as the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signalling pathway, insulin resistance, oocyte meiosis and necrotic apoptosis, in the KEGG pathways jointly regulated by miRNAs and mRNAs. In addition, a cluster of differentially expressed genes with the largest number of miRNAs and mRNAs in the FF-derived exosomes between the control and\nPCOS groups was enriched in the glycolytic pathway (Fig.\u00a0 3B). Furthermore, we analysed the expression of glycolytic genes in the RNA-seq results and found that the expression of key glycolytic genes in the PCOS group was significantly lower than that in the control group (Fig.\u00a0 3C). These results suggest that there is a mechanism for significant changes in the glycolytic capacity and apoptotic state in exosomes from the PCOS group, which are coregulated by miRNAs and mRNAs. It has been reported that FF-derived exosomal miRNAs mainly regulate mRNA to affect the function of GCs [18]. Therefore, we speculate that GCs are the target of glycolysis regulated by FF-derived exosomal miRNAs. Thus, we explored whether FF-derived exosomal miRNAs regulated glycolysis in KGN cells in\u00a0vitro.\nDifferentially expressed exosomal miR\u2011143\u20113p and\u00a0miR\u2011155\u20115p antagonize HK2 in\u00a0KGN cells To clarify the potential regulatory mechanism of exosomal miRNAs in glycolysis of GCs, we analysed the interactions of differentially expressed miRNAs in Fig.\u00a02A and glycolytic genes in Fig.\u00a03C through miRBD (http:// mirdb. org/) and TargetScan (http:// www. targe tscan. org/ vert_ 71/). We found that the upregulated miR-143-3p expression in exosomes from the PCOS group was a potential regulatory factor of HK2, while\ndownregulated miR-155-5p expression was confirmed to negatively regulate the transcriptional activator C/ EBP\u03b2 of miR-143-3p in a variety of cells and tissues [23, 24].\nTo identify the possible targets between miR-143-3p/ miR-155-5p and glycolysis, we used RNAhybrid (https:// bibis erv. cebit ec. uni- biele feld. de/ rnahy brid/) to detect potential targets of key glycolytic genes (Fig.\u00a0 4A\u2013E). We constructed WT vectors and MUT vectors of the luciferase reporter for each potential target (Fig.\u00a0 4F\u2013J). Through the cotransfection of miRNA and vector into KGN cells, we found that only miR-143-3p showed a significant relationship with HK2 (Fig.\u00a0 4K\u2013O). Therefore, HK2 is the only regulatory mediator of miR-143-3p/miR155-5p and glycolysis. MiR-143-3p silenced HK2, and miR-155-5p activated HK2 by silencing miR-143-3p.\nExpression of\u00a0miR\u2011143\u20113p/miR\u2011155\u20115p in\u00a0the\u00a0cellular model of\u00a0PCOS Based on the RNA-seq analysis, we found that FF-derived exosomal miR-143-3p had upregulated expression in the PCOS group compared to the control group, while FFderived exosomal miR-155-5p had downregulated expression in the PCOS group compared to the control group (Fig.\u00a05A). The qRT-PCR results confirmed that FF-derived miR-143-3p but not miR-155-5p had significantly upregulated expression in the PCOS group compared to the control group (Fig.\u00a0 5B). To explore the in\u00a0 vitro functions of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p, we cultured KGN cells with 100\u00a0nM testosterone to mimic the in\u00a0vitro cellular model of PCOS. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 5C, KGN cells cultured with 100\u00a0 nM testosterone (named the PCOS group) showed higher expression levels of miR-143-3p than those of cells cultured with normal full medium, while the expression level of miR-155-5p was not affected (Fig.\u00a0 5C). Consistently, the expression levels of HK2, PKM2 and LDHA in the KGN cells from the PCOS group were significantly higher than those in the blank group (Fig.\u00a0 5D). In addition, the concentration of pyruvate in KGN cells was significantly higher and the concentration of lactate in KGN cells was significantly lower in the PCOS group than in the blank group (Fig.\u00a05E). The pH value of the culture medium was increased in the PCOS group compared to the blank group (Fig.\u00a0 5F). The qRT-PCR results showed that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly reduced in the KGN cells from the PCOS group compared to the blank group (Fig.\u00a0 5G). In addition, the EdU assay showed that the number of\nEdU-positive KGN cells was significantly reduced in the PCOS group compared to the blank group (Fig.\u00a05H)."

We found that compared with those of the control group, the follicular GCs of the patients with PCOS were in a high-testosterone and high-glucose environment, and the upregulation of miR-143-3p expression and downregulation of miR-155-5p expression in exosomes antagonized the glycolytic process of GCs, resulting in an accumulation of pyruvate, a decrease in lactate production, and a decrease in the energy metabolism of GCs. The above processes lead to apoptosis and follicular dysplasia (Fig.\u00a0 8). Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by exocytosis [26] and can be identified by the expression of the CD9, CD63, and CD81 proteins. Exosomes are cup-shaped with a diameter of 30\u2013200\u00a0 nm under TEM [27, 28], which is consistent with our results for the FFderived exosomes.\nExosomes contain a large number of miRNAs and other substances, and miRNAs perform functions through the intercellular transfer of exosomes [29, 30]. With the development and expansion of exosomal miRNA-based cancer treatment and exosomal inhibitors [13, 31, 32], elucidation of regulation of PCOS based on FF-derived exosomal miRNAs is urgently needed. In RNA-seq, we identified biological processes such as glucose import and utilization, glycolysis, protein kinase synthesis, ATP synthesis and apoptosis of GCs regulated by exosome miRNA. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs\ncontrol the expression of key glycolytic enzymes, including HK2, PKM2 and LDHA, to regulate glycolysis through the Warburg effect in cells [33\u201335]. In PCOS, exosomal miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p antagonize glycolysis in KGN cells by silencing key enzymes. The overall level of glycolysis is decreased. ATP generation during the mid-glycolysis period is reduced, resulting in insufficient energy supply for follicular development, which is the primary factor mediating PCOS-related follicular dysplasia in this study.\nThe level of lactate, a metabolite of glycolysis, has always been used as a marker to measure the metabolic level of the Warburg effect in cells [36]. Studies have found that the follicular development of patients with PCOS requires a high concentration of lactate stimulation [37]. Pyruvate accumulation and a decrease in lactate in the culture medium in the PCOS group were confirmed in the metabolome of the rat model of PCOS [38]. The above shows that in PCOS, exosomal miR143-3p and miR-155-5p silence glycolysis in KGN cells, which leads to a decrease in lactate levels, thereby weakening the environmental stimulation of follicular development. This phenomenon is the second factor that mediates PCOS follicular dysplasia in this study. In addition, apoptosis of GCs is considered the main mechanism of follicular atresia [39]. Upregulation of PCOS FF-derived exosomal miR-143-3p expression and downregulation of miR-155-5p expression caused apoptosis of GCs by antagonizing glycolysis, which finally mediated PCOS-related follicular dysplasia in this study.\nMiR-143-3p has been confirmed to negatively regulate glycolysis by targeting HK2 in a variety of cells [40\u201342]. HK2-associated cellular glycolysis is thought to be involved in the coregulation of miR-143-3p and miR155-5p [25]. In PCOS, HK2 mediates glycolysis in KGN cells mediated by miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p, which is similar to the role of HK2 in breast cancer cells [24]. This finding suggests that HK2 may be one of the keys to PCOS therapy and suggests a direction for us to explore PCOS in the future. MiR-143-3p plays a role in the clinic mainly based on its molecular mechanism of targeting HK2 to regulate glycolytic energy metabolism in cells, which has been widely confirmed in colon cancer cells, oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, and other cells [40, 41]. This regulatory mechanism is the same as that found\nFig. 7 The expression changes of miR-155-5p can affect the glycolysis and proliferation of KGN cells.

Our results suggest that miR-143-3p can provide a theoretical basis and technical method for the GC-based glycolytic pathway of PCOS treatment and efficacy evaluation of its specific visual dynamic.\nThe positive regulation of glycolysis by miR-155-5p has been continuously supported by clinical and epidemiological studies [43, 44]. In this study, downregulated miR-155-5p expression weakened glycolysis in KGN cells and indirectly promoted cell apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-155-5p in the PCOS environment could significantly activate glycolysis and proliferation in KGN cells, and miR-155-5p positively regulated glycolysis in KGN cells, providing a new strategy for alleviation of PCOS. We found that miR-155-5p expression was significantly downregulated in RNA-seq of PCOS exosomes but not significantly downregulated in qPCR of KGN cells and exosomes. We speculated that the cascade reaction between miR-155-5p and miR-143-3p may amplify\nthe regulation of miR-155-5p on glycolysis in KGN cells, which is caused by the low accuracy of qPCR. The amplification effect of the cascade reaction suggests that a slight increase in the expression of miR-155-5p in exosomes from individuals with PCOS may activate glycolysis in GCs.\nIn clinical samples of exosomes, the expression of miR-143-3p in the PCOS group was up to ten times higher than that in the control group, showing strong inhibition of glycolysis in the patients with PCOS. MiR155-5p was expressed in the control group but not in some samples of the PCOS group. Compared with the strong inhibition of miR-143-3p on glycolysis, miR155-5p has little positive regulation on glycolysis in patients with PCOS. Therefore, we proposed that in the antagonistic relationship between miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p, miR-143-3p predominantly mediated the decrease in glycolysis in follicular GCs of patients with\nPCOS, and miR-155-5p predominantly maintained normal glycolysis in follicular GCs in subjects without PCOS. MiR-143-3p and miR-155-5p play different roles in different environments and have opposite regulatory effects on glycolysis in follicular GCs, which reveals the specific mechanism by which exosomal miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p antagonize glycolysis mediating follicular dysplasia of GCs. This finding also suggests that clinical detection of miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p levels may be used for early prediction of PCOS.\nIn this study, we reveal the proposed potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms by which exosomal miR-143-3p and miR-155-5p antagonize glycolysis in PCOS-related follicular dysplasia. In this study, the findings of the FF-derived exosomal transcriptome were confirmed through cell experiments and in-depth exploration. The consistency of the results in clinical samples and experimental detection further highlights the clinical applicability and reliability of this study.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12964\u2011 022\u2011 00876\u20116.\nAcknowledgements The present study was supported by China National Natural Science Fund (Nos. 81960274, 82160289, 82101720 and 32160790), Guangxi Bagui Scholar Program, and Guangxi Science Foundation (Nos. 2020GXNSFAA297097 and 2018GXNSFDA050003).\nAuthor contributions SZ, XL and JC designed the whole study; JC, PH and KC performed the experiments; HW, JC and JW prepared the figures; QL performed the statistical analysis; SZ wrote the manuscript.
