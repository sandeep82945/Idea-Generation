1. **Investigate the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This could be done using a variety of assays, such as plaque reduction assays, hemagglutination inhibition assays, and viral load quantification assays.
2. **Determine the mechanism of action of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as enzyme inhibition assays, binding assays, and mutagenesis studies.
3. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone in animal models of influenza A (H7N9) infection.** This could be done using a variety of animal models, such as mice, ferrets, and non-human primates.
4. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone in humans with influenza A (H7N9) infection.** This could be done in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, clinics, and community health centers.
5. **Develop new drugs based on the structure of Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone that are even more potent and selective against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as structure-based drug design and high-throughput screening.
