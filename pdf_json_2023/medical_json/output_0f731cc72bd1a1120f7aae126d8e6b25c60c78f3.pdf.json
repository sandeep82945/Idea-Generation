This paper describes the preparation and response phases of the RFDS response.\nMethods: This study includes vaccinations conducted by the RFDS from 01 January 2021 until 31 December 2021 when vaccines were mandatory for work and social activities. Prior to each clinic, we\u00a0conducted community consultation to determine site requirements, patient characteristics, expected vaccination numbers, and community transmission rates.\nFindings: Ninety-five organizations requested support. The majority (n = 60; 63.2%) came from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organizations. Following consultation, 360 communities were approved for support. Actual vaccinations exceeded expectations (n = 70,827 vs. 49,407), with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83, 0.93). Areas that reported healthcare workforce shortages during the preparation phase had the highest population proportion difference between expected and actual vaccinations. Areas that reported high vaccine hesitancy during the preparation phase had fewer than expected vaccines. There was a noticeable increase in vaccination rates in line with community outbreaks and positive polymerase chain reaction cases [r (41) = 0.35, p = 0.021]. Engagement with community leaders prior to clinic deployment was essential to provide a tailored response based on community expectations.\nKEYWORDS\nCOVID-19, remote, vaccine, vaccination, community, engagement, pandemic\n1. Introduction\nBy 22 February 2022, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic had infected over 422 million people and directly caused 5.8 million deaths (1). The COVID-19 Delta Variant B.1.617.2 was the prominent strain from May 2021 until December 2021. This strain had a basic reproductive rate (R0) between 5 and 8 making it 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant (R0 2.2; 95%"

Since late December 2021, the Omicron (BA\u00b71 and BA\u00b72) strain has become the prominent strain with a potential R0 as high as 10, with cases reported as doubling every 2\u20133 days (4).\nPublic health measures differed geographically to achieve control of transmission. The Australian national response involved public health test-trace-isolate-quarantine responses and public health and social measures (5). Because of the high R0 associated with the Delta and Omicron variant, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advised that public health, social measures and vaccination are essential in reducing transmissibility and hospitalization (1). Based on modeling conducted by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, strict lockdowns were required to manage outbreaks until 70\u201395% of people aged 16 years and over had received 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (6).\nRural and remote populations are at greater risk of severe respiratory disease than their major city counterparts. They have higher rates of chronic disease, and less access to primary healthcare services and emergency departments (6, 7). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples account for 15% of the population in remote areas and 49% of the population in very remote areas (8). There was specific concern about the susceptibility of these populations to COVID-19 due to larger family sizes and increased household mixing that could make them especially susceptible to the Omicron BA.2 variant which has a higher potential R0 (6). Vaccination rates over 70% were the target but in these populations 95\u2013100% was speculated to be\u00a0required to minimize the spread and reduce severe outcomes (6, 7).\nOperation COVID Shield, the national vaccine rollout, was an operational task-force to ensure all workers had access to vaccination before the September 2021 deadline. This effort was mostly carried out by road-mobile vaccination crews traveling to hospitals and aged care facilities, and then through General Practice-led respiratory clinics. Almost 90% of Australians had access to these services. This is because the majority of Australians live in major cities (69%) and regional areas (20%). However, other strategies were required to vaccinate the remaining 11%, which was 3.86 million people that live in remote and very remote areas.\nThe RFDS had been providing aeromedical responses to COVID-19 since February 2020, when the first aeromedical retrieval for a COVID-19 patient occurred from Darwin. Since then, the RFDS has conducted over 7,500 COVID-19 retrievals by road and air ambulance (9). The RFDS has existing relationships with remote communities through aeromedical retrieval, and more recently, through the mobile primary health care services we\u00a0provide to rural and remote communities. We\u00a0were, therefore, in a unique position to provide vaccination clinics to the most vulnerable populations living in remote areas. We\u00a0 were engaged by the Australian Federal Government to assist in \u201cOperation COVID Shield,\u201d and tasked in early 2021 to conduct vaccinations in rural and remote Australia (10).\nThis paper outlines the RFDS COVID-19 vaccination program preparation and response phases, highlighting key factors that were integral to the vaccination program."

However, Australia has a\nsmall population (n = 25.74 million) with most of the Australian population living in major cities (n = 18.5 million, 72.0%), or innerregional areas (n = 4.6 million, 18.0%) areas (12). The remaining population live in outer-regional (n = 2.1 million, 8.0%), remote (n = 0.3 million,1.1%), and very remote areas (n = 0.2 million, 0.8%) (12).\nThe RFDS provided a vaccine service to remote and very remote areas and delivered vaccines to non-RFDS clinics in outer regional, remote and very remote areas. This study includes data for vaccines given to remote and very remote Australian residents, as defined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (13). Remote and very remote Australia has low population concentrations distributed over vast distances with limited or no service provision, including healthcare, for hundreds of kilometers (14, 15).\nMajor city areas and inner regional areas, were excluded from the analysis, as these non-rural locations were not a focus of the RFDS COVID-19 response as outlined in the \u201cNational COVID Vaccine Campaign Plan\u201d (10).\nThis study involves COVID-19 vaccination activities carried-out by the RFDS. We\u00a0have not included vaccination efforts provided by external service providers; specifically, permanent primary healthcare services. The RFDS is the largest aeromedical service in the world, providing primary evacuations and inter-hospital transfers by road and air. Besides the aeromedical service, the RFDS provides extensive primary healthcare outreach services to areas without traditional service provision, operated in a hub and spoke model, including, although not limited to, nursing, general practitioners, oral health, and mental health services. In the 2019/20 financial year the RFDS conducted 37,666 aeromedical and 62,895 road ambulance retrievals, and over 320,000 primary healthcare patient episodes of care (9)."

Alliance Governance Frameworks within healthcare are designed to improve patient care in a systematic and accountable manner, while reducing overall costs by encouraging providers to pool funds and share resources. During an alliance governance contractual arrangement, all organizations are equal partners, with all parties sharing the risks and responsibilities (16).\nBecause of the quickly changing COVID-19 situation, the RFDS and the Commonwealth Government entered a formal agreement quickly and in good faith to assist in the provision of an aeromedical and vaccination response. While the agreement specified essential reporting and contractual obligations, such as data reporting, the partnership in practice included the following activities:\n1. High acuity aeromedical retrieval services (primary evacuations). 2. Low acuity aeromedical retrieval and patient transport services (early and secondary evacuations). 3.

Comparisons between the patient genders receiving a vaccination was made by estimating 95% confidence intervals for means and proportions of interest for the samples and examining whether the population values belonged within those confidence intervals. The population value outside of the sample 95% confidence interval can be\u00a0 interpreted as indicative of a statistically significant difference between the samples at the significance threshold of 0.05.\nWe conducted Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient to compare the proportion of patients expected (based on community consultation) relative to population census information at the\nvaccination clinics prior to RFDS deployment and then the actual RFDS vaccination population proportion relative to population census figures. We\u00a0conducted a Chi-Square analysis to determine whether expected and actual vaccination proportions differed by geographical area. The proportion dominator used was the total population per town/community less 23% to account for the ineligible population which, at this time, were people under 16 years old (12).\nTo determine whether vaccination rates were higher in areas with high COVID-19 transmission, we\u00a0used data directly obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). To reflect the RFDS vaccination clinic dates, the NNDSS data included positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results by geographical regions from 01 January 2021 until 31 December 2021. The study period was before Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) were available in Australia. Using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard, data is reported based on the Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3). SA3 regions provide a regional breakdown of Australia and have a population between 30,000 and 130,000 people. Using SA3 areas allows the RFDS to compare similar areas for vaccine delivery. We\u00a0then conducted a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient to determine whether there was a relationship between the proportion of positive cases reflective of population numbers and the proportion of the population by geographical region in which the RFDS provided doses. The proportion dominator used was the total population per geographical region (SA3), with population data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (12).

This VAS form was completed in coordination with state and territory-based RFDS personnel and the relevant Health Organisation and approved by the Commonwealth (Figure\u00a01). It was then progressed through the VAS governance process for final approval by the Commonwealth. This strategy helped to ensure that the clinics were developed and completed in a communityinformed manner.\nThroughout the study period, the RFDS was approached by 95 separate bodies, requesting vaccination support via the VAS process. The majority (n = 60; 63.2%) of the requests came from Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs), such as Miwatji Health and Nganampa Health Service, with the rest coming from State or Commonwealth agencies (n = 35; 36.8%), such as state/ territory Departments of Health and Hospital Health Networks. This resulted in 102 separate VAS forms being submitted and approved. Working with communities helped to identify when a community would not be\u00a0eligible and provide guidance on alternative vaccine access. Fifty-five submitted VAS forms were rejected because the requests came from communities in inner-regional or major city areas.\nThis was outside of the RFDS vaccination remit which, was to focus on remote and very remote Australia.\nFollowing initial VAS form submission, the relevant RFDS State Officer (SO) (State/Territory RFDS COVID-19 lead) and the RFDS Federation Officer (FO) (National COVID-19 lead), conducted the following suitability assessment:\n\u25aa Stakeholder engagement\u2014including community consultation and yarning\u2014an important process within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture to build respectful relationships. \u25aa Modification of VAS form depending on community needs, in consultation with local health leaders and RFDS deployment leader (RFDS Senior Vaccination Officer). \u25aa SO, RFDS Senior Vaccination Officer, and community representatives developed a deployment strategy and timelines. \u25aa RFDS FO and SO discussed with the Commonwealth at weekly bilateral meetings. \u25aa RFDS FO and the Commonwealth First Assistant Secretary (FAS) evaluated for deployment approval. \u25aa RFDS SO and RFDS Senior Vaccination Officer conducts community consultations and engagement prior to deployment, including although not limited to vaccination information sessions and advertising.\nThroughout the study period, this flexible process resulted in 360 separate community areas being approved for whole of community vaccination deployments some of which were in the most remote areas of Australia."

            "text": "Stakeholder engagement was essential for the vaccination rollout. Initially the RFDS attempted to provide vaccines to communities on an ad-hoc basis. This was unsuccessful in Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, especially in communities outside of the regular RFDS service footprint. A lack of trust combined with vaccine hesitancy and misinformation made the rollout very challenging and after canceling clinics we\u00a0needed to take a different approach. The teams on the ground led the approach, but a common theme was to engage with communities prior to vaccination and empower them to request the vaccine assistance service (Figure\u00a0 1, Step\u00a0 1). The RFDS teams engaged with local\nFIGURE\u00a01 Workflow showing how vaccine assistance service (VAS) requests for RFDS was processed and approved or rejected through the Commonwealth.\nFrontiers in Public Health 05 frontiersin.org\nmayors, councils and disaster management groups to identify the needs of different communities. The teams attended community events; organized events in communities to provide information on the virus and the vaccine; and engaged in Yarning with Indigenous communities and their elders. Yarning is an extremely important tool in Indigenous communities to build respectful relationships and trust (17). RFDS teams met with community leaders prior to clinic deployment and provided tailored responses based on community expectations (Figure\u00a0 1, Step\u00a0 7). RFDS teams undertook specific cultural awareness training to ensure they understood cultural sensitives before arriving.\nA concern shared by many stakeholders was RFDS spreading the COVID virus into their community. Prior to Rapid Antigen Testing, crews took their temperatures daily and always wore full PPE in community. In Kowanyama, RFDS teams agreed to extend their visits from the usual 3 days per week to 3 weeks to deliver primary care, build trust with the community through continuity of care and provide a familiar face to ask questions about the vaccine to combat mis-information and reduce vaccine hesitancy.\nTo vaccinate people in remote communities we\u00a0had to adapt to the local environment as the usual clinic environment was not available. Vaccine clinics had to be\u00a0 easily accessible and where people felt comfortable. In the logistical planning phase (Figure\u00a01, Step\u00a0 8) some unusual locations were identified. These included pubs, shearing sheds, marquees provided by local councils, outside grocery stores and under trees. We\u00a0visited homes, cattle stations and mine sites. In Tasmania, two former public transport buses became vaccine clinics on wheels delivering over 1,300 vaccines to small townships. In Galiwin\u2019ku RFDS crews delivered vaccines in a rugged four-wheel drive vehicle that became affectionately known as the \u201cVaxi Taxi.\u201d\nThere were many challenges around logistics, navigating diverse stakeholders, vaccine hesitancy, language and cultural barriers, outbreaks, and available transport and accommodation. This was a huge learning curve making us adaptable and creative in the delivery of vaccines and education. We\u00a0employed Aboriginal Liaison Officers from within community who were invaluable in community engagement and logistical support. Local community members helped to translate public health messages.\nIn some Indigenous communities the red in our uniforms was seen as disrespectful and the navy blue was too similar to the police. In these locations, uniforms were redesigned so they were culturally appropriate and clearly identified us as health care providers."

The Australian-wide RFDS vaccination clinic median patient age was 51 years (mean = 49.0 years). A third (33.0%) of people vaccinated identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, even though only 3.3% of the population identifies as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.\nIn addition to providing vaccinations directly, the RFDS also provided 19,670 Pfizer vials (6 doses per vial using low dead space needles) by aircraft and road ambulance to other service providers.\nReflecting on the higher rates of COVID-19\u00a0in New South Wales and the heightened threat of community transmission, we\u00a0carried out the most vaccines in New South Wales during this period (n = 29,589). Moree and Narrabri with an eligible population of approximately 15,100 received the highest numbers of vaccinations conducted by the RFDS (n = 8,264, 54.5% of the local population) followed by Gunnedah (n = 7,908, 78.5% of the local population), Broken Hill and Far West (n = 7,284, 21.1% of the local population), Far North (n = 6,712, 32.6% of the local population), and the Kimberley (n = 4,803, 17.8%).\nActual vaccinations were significantly higher than predicted (Table\u00a02), with 49,407 expected and 70,827 vaccinated with a Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.83, 0.93). When comparing the expected and actual vaccination rates by population, we\u00a0found that all the following areas had significantly (p < 0.05) higher actual vaccination rates than expected (Figure\u00a03A). Moree\u2013Narrabri (23.6% vs. 31.5%), Broken Hill and Far West (20.0% vs. 35.7%), Beswick (20.7% vs. 31.6%), Far North (10.2% vs. 19.7%), and East Arnhem (7.1% vs. 11.6%). During the preparation phase, these areas identified workforce shortages, service inaccessibility, and the rates of potential community COVID-19 transmission, as a major motivator to request RFDS. The areas of Outback\u2014South (20.5% vs. 17.9%), Barkly (13.1% vs. 12.5%), Katherine (9.4% vs. 8.2%), and Goldfields (4.85% vs. 4.4%) all had significantly (p < 0.05) fewer vaccinations than expected. During the preparation phase, these areas identified workforce shortages and service inaccessibility. These areas also had high population vaccine hesitancy or deliberation.\nBetween 01 January and 31 December 2021 there were 12,564 positive PCR pathology results in the RFDS operating area, with Shepparton (n = 1,897; 15.1%), Dubbo (n = 1,487; 11.8%), Tamworth\u2013 Gunnedah (n = 1,054; 8.4%), and Shoalhaven (n = 1,052; 8.4%) having the highest positive PCR rates. Results indicated there was a positive relationship between the proportion of the population who had a positive PCR result and the proportion of population vaccinations provided [r(41) = 0.35, p = 0.021] by geographical region (Figure\u00a03B). Showing that vaccinations increased in line with community COVID-19 transmission.\nAcross Australia, 64,382,557 vaccine doses were administered between February 2021 and December 2021. The RFDS\u2019s contribution seems small in comparison. However, our vaccination remit was to provide vaccines to remote and very remote communities that could not access vaccines through their primary health network. The population in remote and very remote areas is approximately 500,000 people. Of the eligible population (approx. n = 385,000), we\u00a0provided 70,827 vaccines directly to almost 20% of the population via our RFDS vaccination teams. When including vial deliveries (118,020 doses provided) we\u00a0were directly involved in the provision of 188,847 vaccinations. This covered nearly 38% of the remote and very remote population. The majority of our vaccinations went to areas with a high proportion of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples. Without our efforts, these communities would have struggled to access vaccines. This would have put these communities at extreme risk of respiratory illness, hospitalization and death, as borders reopened and travel commenced. Where vaccination rates were lower, PCR positive COVID cases were higher highlighting the importance and benefit of vaccines prior to outbreak.\nFrontiers in Public Health 06 frontiersin.org"

The alliance framework gave the RFDS flexibility to collaborate with local community members and specifically adapt each clinic deployment based on community need.\nFIGURE\u00a02 Map of Australia showing population density per square kilometer (adapted from Australian Bureau of Statistics) (12) and The Royal Flying Doctor Service COVID-19 vaccination clinic locations and number of vaccines given between 20 January 2021 and 31 December 2021.\nTABLE\u00a02 Vaccines given by RFDS-led respiratory clinics by state/territory.\nAustralian state/territory Total expected RFDS vaccinations based\non the VAS consultation process\nVaccinations administered by the RFDS (dose\n1 + 2)\nProportion difference\n(expected vs. actual)\nConfirmed COVID-19 cases (PCR) reported\nin the RFDS operating area\nAustralian Capital Territory (Jervis Bay area) 542 1,160 2.1 0\nNew South Wales 17,163 29,589 1.7 5,980\nNorthern Territory 4,711 5,215 1.2 417\nQueensland 9,169 11,875 1.2 206\nSouth Australia 3,632 7,344 1.8 1,556\nTasmania 1790 2031 1.2 324\nVictoria 3,250 3,896 1.1 4,052\nWestern Australia 9,150 9,717 1.2 29\nTotal 49,407 70,827 1.4 12,564\nFrontiers in Public Health 07 frontiersin.org\nInterestingly, community uptake of vaccination was significantly higher than estimated in the VAS consultation process. This was especially true in NSW, where COVID-19 transmission was highest during the study period. During the preparation phase, reasons cited for barriers to vaccination were workforce limitations and service inaccessibility. A recent study found intention to be\u00a0vaccinated by rural people was influenced by limited vaccine appointment availability, or their local clinic not having vaccines available (18). Travel times for rural and remote people to their nearest inner-regional respiratory clinic hub (vaccination and testing) has been identified as a barrier to vaccination (18, 19). To combat these barriers, the RFDS engaged early and often with communities and provided locally available vaccine clinics with clear messaging about availability. This in combination with the RFDS being a respected organization (20), could have resulted in the increased number of people traveling to RFDS clinics to receive vaccination.\nSeveral communities had lower than expected vaccination rates. We\u00a0did not report vaccines provided by external service providers who could have serviced those community members, as data sharing between services was limited during the height of the pandemic. Another possibility for the lower numbers, as identified in the consultation phase, is a high level of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and a detailed analysis is beyond this research This is an international issue and interestingly, the literature indicates that the barriers and solutions to COVID-19 vaccination efforts were similar in the United\u00a0States of America (21), the United\u00a0Kingdom (22), and Guinea (23). The World Health Organisation has identified three core barriers to vaccine uptake which are complacency, confidence, and convenience. These will be\u00a0discussed briefly in the context of our experience vaccinating rural and remote communities in Australia."

            "text": "Some groups reported to be\u00a0 unsure or unwilling to undergo vaccination. This is related to concerns on the long-term side effects and adverse reactions of the vaccine (25), and skepticism about its efficacy (26). This has been compounded by COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, especially on social media (27). Our findings show an increase in vaccination appointment cancelations, especially in Far West New South Wales and the Cape regions of Queensland and Northern Territory, due to negative social media posts.\nMisperceptions about COVID-19 have been linked to lower health literacy and less knowledge about vaccines (28). Lower socioeconomic status is linked to poorer health literacy (28). People living in rural areas have lower socioeconomic status compared to urban areas. This contributes to the lower levels of health literacy in rural populations in Australia (36% compared to 42% in metropolitan areas) (29). Health literacy levels are lower in migrant, refugee and indigenous groups compared to the general Australian population (79% compared to 54%) (29). A consequence of Australian Government settlement policies means many of these populations live in rural and remote Australia.\nVaccine hesitancy is also caused by a deep-rooted and ongoing mistrust of the medical system and an under representation of suitably diverse populations in clinical trials (30, 31). Our observations in the field confirmed that vaccine hesitancy, especially in Indigenous populations, was associated with mistrust rooted in intergenerational trauma associated with colonization. To improve vaccine uptake RFDS staff engaged with individual communities and built respectful relationships and trust through yarning and engagement with community leaders and elders. This led to over one third of our vaccines going to people that identified as\nFIGURE\u00a03 Proportion of the population (A) expected to be\u00a0vaccinated, as per VAS request form compared to actual vaccinations and (B) correlation between vaccination rates and positive (PCR) COVID results.\nFrontiers in Public Health 08 frontiersin.org\nAboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. The importance of community engagement was one of the most important lessons learnt by RFDS and laid a foundation of trust for future service provision. As COVID-19 spread across Australia, and people\u2019s fears of catching COVID-19 increased, RFDS were invited to provide vaccine support by communities. Being ready to support these communities and building community relationships meant that vaccination rates in some of Australia\u2019s most vulnerable communities increased (24)."

However, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted underlying problems with rural and remote healthcare provision. It showed that many communities have limited access to basic essential services such as GP and nursing services (33). This meant significant short-term surging of the workforce was necessary to fill the gaps. This in part, mitigated the impact on permanent services and provided vaccination services. However, this is not a suitable long-term solution. It is clear that a robust health care workforce is required in rural and remote communities to improve health literacy, and trust within health services in preparation for future pandemics and other public health threats (34)."

Individual community consultation prior to vaccine roll-out was essential to the success of our vaccine efforts. We\u00a0will continue to develop and establish relationships at the community level so we\u00a0 are better placed to deliver health care services to remote and very remote communities. The RFDS is aligning its service delivery with the Comprehensive Care Standard. This integrates patient care processes to identify individual needs and the needs of smaller populations. This focuses on community engagement and co-design to ensure services are suitable for the needs of unique communities."

This enabled a successful collaborative venture resulting in over 70,000 vaccines being delivered in less than a year. The total number of vaccines given exceeded the expected number by 50%."

While RFDS vaccination numbers were more than expected as indicated by the concordance correlation coefficient results, there were some areas with low overall (RFDS and non-RFDS) vaccination uptake. Specifically, overall vaccination uptake was also likely influenced by external factors, such as government education interventions. However, this limitation was reduced by receiving expected vaccination numbers directly prior to clinic deployment during the community consultation phase. This enabled us to estimate the number of vaccines required for each deployment.\nFrontiers in Public Health 09 frontiersin.org"

This was to be\u00a0rolled out through vaccine teams and general practice. In rural and remote Australia where access to health care facilities is limited the strategy fell short. The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) were contracted to support vaccination clinics in rural and remote areas to fill this gap, via a surge workforce. Ninety-five independent organizations requested vaccination support via the vaccination assistance service (VAS) framework. The RFDS administered more vaccinations than expected. This demonstrates the barrier to accessing health care and the need and effectiveness of community consultation and adapting clinics to meet the needs of the community."
