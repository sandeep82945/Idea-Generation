    "abstractText": "To develop high-performance microwave absorption materials with the features of lightweight, thin thickness, broad bandwidth, and strong absorption, an ultralight Ni3S2@N, S-codoped graphene aerogel with a density of 13.5 mg/cm3 has been fabricated by the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to directly initiate the gelation of graphene oxide strategy. In such a strategy, dual-functional 1D Ni-MOF nanorods not only act as the gelation agent but also afford the doping elements (N and S) originated from the organic species and the precursor for metal sulfide. Due to the synergistic effects of good impedance matching and multiple losses, the optimal reflection loss (RL) of as-prepared Ni3S2@N, S-codoped graphene aerogel reaches\u221246.9 dB at 17.1 GHz with only 2.0 mm and ultralow filling content (1.75 wt%). The maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 6.3 GHz (11.7\u201318.0 GHz) at 2.38 mm, covering the whole Ku band. Moreover, the value of EAB with the RL less than\u221230 dB can be tuned to 12.2 GHz (5.8\u201318 GHz) at the absorber thickness ranging from 1.9 to 5.0 mm. This work provides insight for rational design and fabrication of multicomponent-containing graphene aerogels, showing the potential application in lightweight and high-performance microwave absorption.",

            "text": "Graphene aerogels (GAs) offer a distinctive combination of high porosity, low density, and tunable conductive properties, which make it grab considerable attention in various applications [1\u20135], in particular for high-performance electromagnetic (EM) wave -attenuation [6\u20138]. The interconnected porous structures of graphene aerogels can not only provide a sufficient free space inside, improving the impedance match between graphene component and free space but also impart the multiple reflections and scattering of the incident EM waves [7,9,10]. Currently, graphene aerogels, either doped with heteroatoms or incorporated with second dielectric loss or magnetization loss materials, have been fabricated to achieve highperformance EM absorbers [6,11]. As an example, the introduction of extra doped atoms can tune the bandgap of reduced graphene oxide and effectively introduce intrinsic defects, breaking the sp2 domains in a hexagonal lattice of graphene, improving the conduction loss along with additional polarization relaxation. References [12\u201314] Liu et al. investigated the EM absorption property of N-doped graphene aerogels; the minimal reflection value is \u221253.9 dB at 3.5 mm with 5 wt% filler loading due to the enhanced dipole relaxation loss from pyrrole/pyridine nitrogen and the conduction loss dominated by graphite nitrogen [15]. On the other hand, designing graphene-based aerogels combined with magnetic materials is also an efficient strategy to achieve improved microwave absorption performance [16\u201319]. For instance, a hierarchically porous Fe\u2013Co/N-doped carbon/graphene composite exhibits EABmax of 9.29 GHz, which is attributed to the magnetic-dielectric synergy.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 655. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12040655 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 655 2 of 12\nTo further improve the microwave attenuation, the graphene-based aerogels integrated with multiple effects, including conductive loss, dipole polarization, interfacial polarization, magnetic loss, and multiple scattering and reflection have been developed [13,20\u201323]. Chen et al. reported a multi-component N-doped graphene aerogel containing N-doped carbon nanotubes and FeNi nanoparticles, which exhibits a strong microwave attenuation (\u221239.39 dB) of thin thickness (2.0 mm) [21]. Another typical example is multi-dimensional gradient graphene aerogels, comprising 3D carbon nanocoils, 2D graphene sheets, 1D carbon nanofiber, and 0D Fe3O4@C nanoparticles. This aerogel shows an outstanding minimum RL value of \u221271.5 dB at 9.5 GHz with a thickness of 2.95 mm, which attributes to multiple loss mechanisms [24]. However, the fabrication of graphene aerogels with a multicomponent usually suffers from problems, including complicated synthetic steps, harsh synthetic conditions, and uncontrolled ratios of each component. Thus, developing a convenient synthetic methodology to fabricate the hierarchically porous aerogels based on graphene oxide and other low-dimensional building blocks is a major challenge. Metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives possess tunable electrical conductivity and abundant terminal groups of carbon matrix, facilitating strong conductive loss and dipole polarization. In addition, MOF derivatives exhibit a prominent feature of high dispersion of nanomaterials into carbon matrix, creating heterogeneous phase interfaces to improve the interfacial polarization loss and optimize the impedance matching [25,26]. In this work, a facile and low-cost approach based on 1D Ni-MOF nanorods directly induced gelation strategy has been developed for the preparation of 3D graphene/NiMOF aerogels, which are converted to Ni3S2@N, S-codoped graphene aerogels by further pyrolysis processes. In such a strategy, dual-functional 1D Ni-MOF nanorods not only act as the gelation agent, promoting the gelation of graphene oxide, but also afford the doping elements (N and S) originated from the organic species and the precursor for metal sulfide. The as-prepared Ni3S2@N, S-codoped graphene aerogels possess satisfactory features, including lightweight, thin thickness, broad bandwidth, and strong absorption. Notably, the reflection loss reaches \u221246.9 dB at 17.1 GHz with a matching thickness of only 2.0 mm and ultralow filling content (1.75 wt%). The maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) reaches 6.3 GHz (11.7\u201318.0 GHz) at 2.38 mm, covering the whole Ku band. Therefore, the presented MOF-induced gelation strategy provides an effective pathway to fabricate multicomponent absorbers with a 3D porous structure for achieving excellent EM absorption performance."

Three typical peaks of high-resolution N 1s spectra (Figure 3e) are att ibu ed to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively. The binding energy peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 located at 161.1 and 163.1 eV, respectively, originate from the Ni\u2212S bond. The peak at 164.5 eV is allocated to C\u2212S bonding (Figure 3f). Regarding the XPS spectra of Ni2p (Figure 3g), two peaks at 853.2 and 870.5 eV ascribe to Ni2+, while the peaks at 855.3 and 873.4 eV correspond to Ni3+ [14,28]. The coexistence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ in Ni3S2@NSGAs is beneficial to facilitating the attenuation of microwave energy as the electron hopping from one valent state to another in multivalent ionic materials could induce Debye relaxations. Figure 4a presents the 3D porous structure of the Ni3S2@NSGA-650 sample, and EDS elemental mappings (Figure 4b\u2013f) reveal that C, N, O, and S atoms are uniformly distributed\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 655 6 of 12\nthroughout the N, S-codoped rGO. In addition, the nanoparticles marked by red circles are corresponding to Ni3S2 over the N, S-codoped rGO surface (Figure 4g\u2013l). The TEM observation shows that numerous nanoparticles with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers are embedded into the rGO sheets (Figure 4m). The crystalline lattice spacing of 0.285 nm, consistent with the (110) plane of rhombohedral Ni3S2, is confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and inverse fast fourier transition (IFFT) images (Figure 4n,o) [14,28].

The EM performance for Ni3S2@NSGA-650 is compared with corresponding values in representative recent reports (Table 1).

            "text": "Based on the aforementioned discussion, the high-performance microwave absorption property of as-prepared Ni3S2@NSGA-650 is attributed to the synergistic effects of good impedance matching and multiple losses, which can be revealed from the perspective of the multiscale. (1) Microscopic scale, multiple random reflections, and the scattering of EM waves repeatedly occur at the internal interfaces of the cell walls, leading to the transfer of EM energy to be dissipated as heat, thereby realizing the efficient absorption of EM waves. In addition, the 3D interconnected porous reduced graphene oxide network can establish more conductive paths for electronic transport, endowing the aerogel with high conduction loss. (2) Nanoscale: Ni3S2 nanoparticle is a typical magnetic loss material, including natural resonance, exchange resonance, and eddy current loss. Despite causing a weak magnetic loss of the material, the low Ni3S2 content can substantially reduce the effective permittivity of the material, which is favorable for the highly conductive carbonbased absorbers to achieve good impedance matching. The multiple interfaces between Ni3S2 nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets also enhance the interface polarization. (3) Molecular scale: the introduction of N and S elements into graphene lattice improves the dipolar polarization and the intrinsic defect polarization. The dipolar polarization is ascribed to the different electronegativity between C, N, and S atoms or the residual oxygen functional groups in unsaturated coordination, and the intrinsic defect polarization is resulted from the charge unbalance around the carbon vacancies in the graphene lattice under an alternating electromagnetic field."
