    "abstractText": "Lanthanide ions are extensively utilized in optoelectronic materials, owing to their narrow emission bandwidth, prolonged lifetime, and elevated fluorescence quantum yield. Inorganic nonmetallic materials commonly serve as host matrices for lanthanide complexes, posing noteworthy challenges regarding loading quantity and fluorescence performance stability post-loading. In this investigation, an enhanced St\u00f6ber method was employed to synthesize mesoporous hollow silica, and diverse forms of SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen (S@Eu) were successfully prepared. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) outcomes revealed the effective binding of silica with Eu(TTA)3phen through both physical adsorption and chemical bonding. This includes the formation of Si-O-C bonds between silica and the ligand, as well as Si-O-Eu bonds between silica and europium ions. Fluorescence tests demonstrated that the mesoporous SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen(MS@Eu) composite exhibited the highest fluorescence intensity among the three structured silica composites, with a notable enhancement of 46.60% compared to the normal SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen composite. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis indicated that the specific surface area plays a crucial role in influencing the fluorescence intensity of SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen, whereby the prepared mesoporous hollow silica further elevated the fluorescence intensity by 61.49%. Moreover, SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen demonstrated 11.11% greater cyclic stability, heightened thermal stability, and enhanced alkaline resistance relative to SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen.",

            "text": "Rare-earth metal elements possess a distinctive electronic structure characterized by the 4f subshell, which bestows upon them exceptional optical, electrical, and magnetic properties [1\u20133]. They have found widespread utilization across various industries, including the military, metallurgy, petrochemicals, electronics, glass and ceramics, and agriculture. In particular, rare-earth metals have gained prominence in high-tech sectors such as new materials and electronics, and they are recognized as strategic resources by numerous nations worldwide [4]. Among the diverse avenues of research into functional rare-earth materials, the investigation of luminescent rare-earth materials holds paramount importance [5\u20139]. Owing to the limited molar absorptivity (less than 10 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121) of trivalent lanthanide ions and the forbidden f-f transitions, only a minute fraction of radiation directly excites the 4f level of rare-earth ions, resulting in feeble luminescence. The effective solution lies in the incorporation of rare-earth complexes into inorganic materials. In this approach, organic ligands possessing strong absorption bands in the ultraviolet (UV) region can capture more light energy than the lanthanide ions themselves. Subsequently, the excited energy is\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4501. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16134501 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4501 2 of 14\ntransferred from the organic ligands to the lanthanide ions through intramolecular energy transfer, enabling the sensitization of rare-earth ions to emit stronger light compared to pure lanthanide ions [10]. The rigid lattice structure of inorganic materials provides a stable microenvironment for luminescent lanthanide ions. The incorporation of lanthanide complexes into inorganic materials offers several advantages, including large Stoke shifts, narrow emission spectra, prolonged lifetimes, and high photochemical stability [11\u201317]. These merits endow lanthanide-doped inorganic materials with significant advantages across numerous applications, laying a solid foundation for modern technologies such as lighting, photon communication, battery devices, and bioimaging [18\u201321]. Silicon dioxide, a vital inorganic compound, possesses remarkable chemical stability and hardness. It features a compact and rigid crystal structure, along with exceptional insulation performance and biocompatibility. Silicon dioxide finds extensive application in the fabrication of optical glass [22], semiconductor devices [23], catalysts [24], coatings [25,26], ceramics [27], rubber [28], and plastics [29]. Moreover, it is widely employed in the medical [30], cosmetic [31], food [32], and environmental protection fields [33]. Within the realm of materials research, mesoporous silica and hollow silica have emerged as prominent topics of exploration. Mesoporous silica refers to a porous material characterized by a regular pore structure, with pore sizes ranging from 2 to 50 nanometers [34,35]. Several methods, such as the sol\u2013gel method, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical method, can be employed for synthesizing mesoporous silica. Due to its adjustable pore structure, substantial specific surface area, controllable pore size, and high surface activity, mesoporous silica finds versatile applications in adsorption, catalysis, separation, sensing, and various other fields [36]. On the other hand, hollow silica is a material with a hollow internal structure and a solid silicon oxide exterior. Unlike mesoporous silica, there are relatively fewer methods for synthesizing hollow silica, primarily including the template method, membrane reaction method, and hydrothermal method [26,37]. Hollow silica possesses advantages such as a high specific surface area, hollow structure, and controllable pore size, making it widely applicable in areas such as drug delivery, catalyst carriers, and sensors. The common approaches for synthesizing mesoporous silica and hollow silica mainly involve the employment of either the hard template method or the soft template method [38,39]. The hard template method offers advantages such as precise preparation, controllable pore size, and excellent pore connectivity [40]. However, it is associated with drawbacks such as complex preparation procedures, the necessity for template and deposition material preparation, and the potential for pore channel deformation or shrinkage following template removal. In contrast, the soft template method is characterized by a simpler preparation process, a wider range of pore sizes, and favorable pore connectivity [41]. Nonetheless, it exhibits disadvantages such as lower pore size accuracy and uneven pore size distribution. A template-free method for synthesizing hollow silica presents advantages such as simplicity, controllable pore size, large-scale production, and minimal pollution, thus holding great potential for further exploration [42\u201347]. Silica-based rare-earth materials exhibit a wide range of applications [48\u201354]. Notably, Tin-gyun Wang et al. [55] recently presented a novel approach for fabricating transparent Ce/Tb co-doped yttrium pyrosilicate (YPS) nanocrystal silica fibers using the C2 laser heating method. By embedding Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions, they achieved an impressive energy transfer efficiency of up to 59.87% and improved fluorescence performance. This advancement positions the material as a promising candidate for scintillators, fiber lasers, and phosphors. In a separate investigation conducted by Yujuan He et al. [56], films of europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate (YVO4:Eu) and hollow silica nanoparticles (HSNPs) were prepared and applied onto a glass cover of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell. The resulting film demonstrated downshifting and anti-reflection capabilities, effectively capturing ultraviolet photons and minimizing reflection. This innovation renders the material suitable for integration into solar cell modules. Previous research on the combination of rare-earth metals and silica has predominantly focused on silica fibers or thin films [57], while studies exploring the combination of distinct\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4501 3 of 14\nstructures of spherical silica and rare-earth complexes have been scarce. This study aimed to address this gap by preparing silica spheres with varying degrees of internal and external shrinkage. Through ultrasonic and heating treatments, silica spheres with diverse morphologies, including solid, mesoporous, and hollow structures, were successfully obtained. The rare-earth complex Eu(TTA)3phen was subsequently adsorbed onto the surfaces of these silica spheres, resulting in impressive fluorescence performance (Figure 1). A comparison of the fluorescence performance with other structures of SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen revealed that mesoporous SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen exhibited superior performance and demonstrated significant potential in battery devices. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity variations and cyclic stability of SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen and Eu(TTA)3phen were evaluated under different environmental temperatures and pH values, with SiO2@Eu(TTA)3phen demonstrating excellent performance.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15\ntively capturing ultraviolet photons and minimizing reflection.

            "text": "In the St\u00f6ber method, the designated silicon source for the preparation of SiO2 is known as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). This compound undergoes hydrolysis to yield silanol groups (-Si-OH), effectively replacing the ethoxy groups (Si-OR). The pace of this reaction is influenced by the extent of ethoxy group conversion into silanol groups. In the typical St\u00f6ber synthesis, a catalyst such as ammonia solution is employed to expedite the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The presence of OH\u2212 ions in the ammonia solution enhances their efficacy as nucleophiles. Both hydrolysis and condensation reactions entail nucleophilic substitution, yet the condensation reaction proceeds at a considerably swifter pace compared to hydrolysis. This is attributed to the propensity of silanol groups to release protons more readily than water molecules, resulting in an augmented positive charge density around the silicon atom. Consequently, nucleophilic substitution becomes more favorable. Consequently, silanol monomers display a greater inclination to connect with larger silica clusters, as opposed to other monomers or smaller oligomers. By manipulating the TMAH content within the silica spheres, three distinct types of silica particles were synthesized, each exhibiting solid, mesoporous, and hollow structures. TMAH, functioning as a catalyst for silica preparation, induces a rapid decline in pH throughout the reaction process, thereby influencing the rates of hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS. During the initial stages of the reaction, both hydrolysis and condensation occur at an accelerated pace, giving rise to a less densely consolidated silica structure that is susceptible to etching. However, in the subsequent stages, these processes decelerate, resulting in the formation of highly condensed silica that resists etching. Figure 2 provides a depiction of the pH variation over time in a reaction solution catalyzed by 2.0 mM TMAH. Within the first hour, the pH of the solution experiences a sharp decline from 13.3 to 11.1, gradually settling at 10.5 over the subsequent two hours. The pH fluctuations exert a direct influence on the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of TEOS facilitated by TMAH, which exhibit heightened reactivity during the initial hour but subsequently decelerate. This deceleration can be attributed to the pronounced drop in pH as the reaction progresses. These distinct stages promote the formation of loosely and tightly aggregated silica gel networks, respectively."

The distinct characteristic of the hollow silica spheres is the presence of a lower concentration of Si in the central region and a higher concentration in the outer layer, which is consistent with the findings from the TEM examination. The S and Eu are well dispersed on the outer layer of the silica. Based on the EDS spectrum and TEM results obtained from the hollow silica analysis, it can be concluded that the flocculent material corresponds to Eu(TTA)3phen.\n(a) TEM image of MS@Eu; (b) Si elemental mapping of MS@Eu; (c) Eu elemental mapping of MS@Eu;\n(d) S elemental mapping of MS@Eu; (e) TEM image of HS@Eu; (f) Si elemental mapping of HS@Eu;\n(g) Eu elemental mapping of HS@Eu; (h) S elemental mapping of HS@Eu."

It reveals the presence of stable CF3 peaks at approximately 292 eV for both Eu(TTA)3phen and Si@Eu, originating from the TTA ligand. Furthermore, C-O and C=O peaks are observed at 286 eV and 288 eV, respectively. Notably, Si@Eu exhibits an additional peak at 287 eV, which arises from the reaction between the C=O bond in the TTA ligand and the -OH groups on the surface of the silica. This reaction leads to the formation of a C-O-Si bond. The fitting results of the oxygen peak, displayed in Figure 6c,f, indicate that the binding energy of the O-Eu bond in Eu(TTA)3phen is measured at 530 eV. In comparison, S@Eu not only forms bonds with the O atoms in the ligand but also establishes a Si-O-Eu bond with the O atoms on the surface of the silica, resulting in a peak located at 535 eV. The abundance of Si-O-Si bonds indicates that the primary component of S@Eu is still silica.\nFigure 5.

(a) Fluorescence intensity; (b) fluorescence lifetime fitting curve; (c) quantum yield.\nThe variation in fluorescence intensity among the three structures can be attributed to the specific surface area. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for the three structures are presented in Figure 9a\u2013c. Upon analysis, it was found that mesoporous SiO2 possesses the highest BET specific surface area of 261 m2/g, followed by hollow SiO2 with a value of 200 m2/g, and SiO2 with a value of 153 m2/g. This indicates that mesoporous SiO2 exhibits the largest surface area among the three structures. It is noteworthy that MS@Eu, which is composed of mesoporous SiO2, demonstrates the strongest fluorescence intensity. This observation aligns with the expectations based on the test results, as a higher specific surface area generally facilitates enhanced fluorescence intensity.\nFigure 8.

Additionally, the quantum yield of MHS@Eu was measured to be 85.65%.

Eventually, the fluorescence intensity of both materials reaches a very low level. However, due to the binding of Eu(TTA)3phen to the surface of silica with a relatively large particle size, S@Eu manages to maintain a relatively favorable fluorescence intensity even after multiple cycles. The fluorescence intensity variations with temperature, as displayed in Figure 11d\u2013f, exhibit distinct patterns. As the temperature rises, the fluorescence intensity of Eu(TTA)3phen experiences a rapid decrease. Conversely, the fluorescence intensity of S@Eu initially increases and then decreases, reaching its peak between 30 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C. In comparison to pure Eu(TTA)3phen, S@Eu demonstrates improved fluorescence intensity at high temperatures, owing to the exceptional heat resistance of silica. The acid\u2013base resistance test outcomes, as demonstrated in Figure 11g\u2013i, indicate poor acid resistance for both Eu(TTA)3phen and S@Eu, with the fluorescence intensity reaching its lowest point at pH 5. However, when compared to Eu(TTA)3phen, S@Eu exhibits better alkali resistance.
