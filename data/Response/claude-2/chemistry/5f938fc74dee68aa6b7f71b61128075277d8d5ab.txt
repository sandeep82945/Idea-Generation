 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Further optimize the dissection sites of the new artificial luciferases (ALucs) to improve their performance in protein fragment complementation assays (PCAs). The paper showed some ALucs worked better than others, so finding the optimal split sites could enhance their utility. 

2. Test the new ALucs in vivo by expressing them in cells and animal models. This could reveal their potential for bioluminescent imaging in living organisms.

3. Engineer the ALucs to shift their bioluminescence emission to longer near-infrared wavelengths. This could improve tissue penetration for whole body imaging. 

4. Evolve the ALucs using directed evolution approaches to further enhance their light output or stability. Iterative rounds of mutagenesis and screening could yield superior luciferase variants.

5. Incorporate the new ALucs into sensors and assays for different biological analytes beyond the examples shown. Their strong signal and spectral modulation capacity could enable new biosensing applications.
