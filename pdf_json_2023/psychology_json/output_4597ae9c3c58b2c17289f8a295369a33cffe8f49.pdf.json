    "abstractText": "Diploid and polyploid species derived from the euploid series x = 11 occur in the genus Psidium, as well as intraspecific cytotypes. Euploidy in the genus can alter the gene copy number, resulting in several \u201comics\u201d variations. We revisited the euploidy, reported genomic (nuclear 2C value, GC%, and copy number of secondary metabolism genes) and epigenomic (5-mC%) differences in Psidium, and related them to essential oil yield and composition. Mean 2C values ranged from 0.90 pg (P. guajava) to 7.40 pg (P. gaudichaudianum). 2C value is intraspecifically varied in P. cattleyanum and P. gaudichaudianum, evidencing cytotypes that can be formed from euploid (non-reduced) and/or aneuploid reproductive cells. GC% ranged from 34.33% (P. guineense) to 48.95% (P. myrtoides), and intraspecific variations occurred even for species without 2C value intraspecific variation. Essential oil yield increased in relation to 2C value and to GC%. We showed that P. guajava (diploid) possesses two and P. guineense (tetraploid) four copies of the one specific TPS gene, as well as eight and sixteen copies respectively of the conserved regions that occur in eight TPS genes. We provide a wide \u201comics\u2019\u2019 characterization of Psidium and show the outcome of the genome and epigenome variation in secondary metabolism.",

            "text": "Diploid and polyploid species derived from the euploid series x = 11 occur in the genus Psidium, as well as intraspecific cytotypes. Euploidy in the genus can alter the gene copy number, resulting in several \u201comics\u201d variations. We revisited the euploidy, reported genomic (nuclear 2C value, GC%, and copy number of secondary metabolism genes) and epigenomic (5-mC%) differences in Psidium, and related them to essential oil yield and composition. Mean 2C values ranged from 0.90 pg (P. guajava) to 7.40 pg (P. gaudichaudianum). 2C value is intraspecifically varied in P. cattleyanum and P. gaudichaudianum, evidencing cytotypes that can be formed from euploid (non-reduced) and/or aneuploid reproductive cells. GC% ranged from 34.33% (P. guineense) to 48.95% (P. myrtoides), and intraspecific variations occurred even for species without 2C value intraspecific variation. Essential oil yield increased in relation to 2C value and to GC%. We showed that P. guajava (diploid) possesses two and P. guineense (tetraploid) four copies of the one specific TPS gene, as well as eight and sixteen copies respectively of the conserved regions that occur in eight TPS genes. We provide a wide \u201comics\u2019\u2019 characterization of Psidium and show the outcome of the genome and epigenome variation in secondary metabolism.\nThe neotropical and monophyletic genus Psidium, family Myrtaceae, contains approximately 92 species1, hich are taxonomically classified in four sections: Psidium (10 species), Obversifolia (six species), Apertiflora (31 species) and Mitranthes (26 species)2. ~ 60 Psidium species occur in Brazil distributed in all biomes, in several phytogeographic domains, representing great diversification3. Psidium guajava L. (guava tree, Psidium section) is the well-known species of the genus due to its relevance for fruit production4 and medicinal value5,6. Other Psidium species, popularly called \u201cara\u00e7\u00e1s\u201d, are potential genetic resources for breeding programs and medicinal purposes7, as well as they are relevant for taxonomic, ecological and evolutive studies in this genus2.\nBesides diploid species, in Psidium occur polyploid species with different ploidy levels commonly derived from the basic chromosome number x = 11. One of the consequences of euploidy in Psidium is the interspecific and intraspecific variation of the nuclear 2C value. Previously, we found that the increase (2C = 0.93\u00a0pg \u2013 2C = 5.12\u00a0pg) of the nuclear 2C value is outcome of the increase in ploidy level (diploid with 2C = 0.93\u00a0pg \u2013 2C = 0.98\u00a0pg to octoploid with 2C = 5.12\u00a0pg) in seven Psidium species8. In addition to interspecific variation, genomic differences have been identified for P. cattleyanum. This species is considered a polyploid complex due to genetic diversity (intraspecific variation) of the 2n chromosome number and, consequently, the ploidy level (triploid 2n = 3x = 33 to duodecaploid 2n = 12x = 132 chromosomes), nuclear 2C value (tetraploid with 2C = 2.17\u00a0pg to duodecaploid with 2C = 5.64\u00a0pg), and number of the CMA3 + /DAPI-, 18S rDNA and 5S rDNA sites (triploid with three sites to duodecaploid with 12, 12 and 10 sites)9.\nDespite the 2n chromosome number importance for ploidy level determination (euploidy condition), previous data indicate that the nuclear 2C value is an indicator of higher ploidy level in Psidium8,9. Thus, nuclear 2C value\nOPEN\n1Departamento de Agronomia, Centro de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias e Engenharias, Universidade Federal do Esp\u00edrito Santo, Alto Universit\u00e1rio, s/n, Guararema, Alegre, ES 29500-000, Brazil. 2Departamento de Biologia Geral, Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, Av.

Nuclear 2C value is mainly measured using flow cytometry, which is widely used because it is fast, accurate and reproducible10.\nIn addition to the nuclear 2C value, the AT/GC base composition can also be measured by flow cytometry, expanding the genomic data11. AT/GC base composition knowledge allows inferences about the genome structure and dynamic. So, AT/GC base composition must be incorporated into \u201comics\u201d data, and consequently used in taxonomic, systematic and evolutive studies. Psidium guajava genome has GC = 39.5%12, and P. cattleyanum transcriptome has ~ 49% in the yellow and red morphotypes13.\nPolyploidy has been considered one of the main genomic changes that results in genetic8 and epigenetic modifications14 influencing the population genetic structure, ecological niche differentiation, diversification and speciation in plants15. About it, Psidium is one outstanding example of the polyploid impact in speciation and geographic distribution8,15. Euploidy (autopolyploidy, true allopolyploidy or segmental allopolyploidy) plays a central role in shaping and restructuring plant genomes15. Regardless of the genomic origin, one euploidy outcome is the increase of the gene copy number, which probably results in phenotypic changes and/or new traits. Also furthering phenotypic variations, genomic changes occur (\u201cgenomic shock\u201d) after the euploidy, such as aneuploidy, structural chromosome rearrangements, mobile elements activation or silencing, and DNA sequence change16. Thus, the euploidy and its outcomes are sources of evolutionary novelties. Duplicate genes can follow an evolutive path from an initial state of complete redundancy, in which a copy is probably disposable, to a stable situation17,18 \u2013 neutral theory. Still, they may include new gene functions and expression patterns. The duplicated genes can maintain their original or similar function, undergo diversification in function or expression patterns, or a copy can be silenced by mutations or epigenetic mechanisms19. Many duplicate genes can have loci in tandem in the genome or occur regionalized (within a few Mbp)20,21. Additionally, phylogenetic evidence links genome increase (nuclear 2C value) to the increase in the overall percentage of global 5-methylcytosine (5-mC%). 5-mC is an important epigenetic chemical change in DNA that promotes heterochromatinization (chromatin compact level increase) and, consequently, gene expression control22,23.\nLeaf essential oils, characteristic of the Myrtaceae family secondary metabolism, are rich in terpene and exhibit quali- and quantitative variations reported24. Terpenes play ecological roles, and essential oils are economically exploited25\u201327 for their biological and phytotherapeutic activities28. Our research group evidenced that seven P. cattleyanum plants exhibited different nuclear 2C values (2C = 3.20\u00a0pg \u2013 2C = 6.03\u00a0pg), seven monoterpenes and eight sesquiterpenes in essential oils. From these data, the P. cattleyanum plants were discriminated in three cytotypes (nuclear 2C value) related to three chemotypes (monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds). P. cattleyanum plants with the relatively lower nuclear 2C values (2C = 3.23\u00a0pg \u2013 2C = 4.71\u00a0pg) produced a lower amount of essential oils composed mostly of hydrogenated monoterpenes. Differently, the plants with relatively higher nuclear 2C values (2C = 5.81\u00a0pg and 2C = 6.03\u00a0pg) produced a higher amount of essential oils composed mostly of hydrogenated sesquiterpenes, as trans-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene24.\nWe aimed to revisit the 2n chromosome number (euploidy), measure the nuclear 2C value, GC% and 5-mC%, and determine the copy number of TPS genes in Psidium species of three sections (Psidium, Apertiflora and Obversifolia). In addition, we correlated these genomic and epigenomic data with the yield and composition of the essential oils, evidencing the outcomes of the genetic and epigenetic differences in this phenotype."

            "text": "Intraspecific and interspecific variation of nuclear 2C value and GC%. The nuclear 2C value of each Psidium access ranged from 0.90\u00a0pg (P. guajava) to 7.40\u00a0pg (P. gaudichaudianum, Supplementary Table\u00a0S2). We noticed, for the first time, the nuclear 2C value for P. acidum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. friedrichsthalianum, P. macahense and P. rufum. Psidium guajava, P. oblongatum and P. macahense presented the lowest 2C values. Psidium guajava and P. oblongatum are diploids (2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes). Therefore, possibly P. macahense also has the same 2n chromosome number and ploidy level, since this species has closer mean nuclear 2C value (2C = 0.93\u00a0pg) than P. guajava (2C = 0.96\u00a0pg) and P. oblongatum (2C = 0.99\u00a0pg).\nInterspecific variation in nuclear genome size was confirmed by mean nuclear 2C values of the Psidium species (Table\u00a02). Considering the lowest mean 2C value = 0.93\u00a0pg for P. macahense and highest 2C = 4.99\u00a0pg for P. gaudichaudianum, we realize a variation equivalent to 2C = 4.06\u00a0pg more nuclear DNA. Additionally, the individual nuclear 2C values also show the interspecific variation in nuclear genome size, reaching 2C = 6.50\u00a0pg more nuclear DNA, since one access of P. guajava has 2C = 0.90\u00a0pg and one access of P. gaudichaudianum has 2C = 7.40\u00a0pg.\nIn addition to interspecific variation, the individual values point to intraspecific variation of the nuclear 2C value, including among relatives. Accesses belonging to P. guajava (2C difference = 0.13\u00a0pg among individuals), P. guineense (2C = 0.20\u00a0pg) and P. acidum (2C = 0.08\u00a0pg) showed less variation of the nuclear 2C value. These nuclear 2C values differences are lower than the 1Cx value of P. guajava (0.475\u00a0pg) and P. oblongatum (0.490\u00a0pg) determined considering the basic chromosome number (x = 11) of the genus Psidium and the ploidy level of these species (2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes \u2013 diploid8). Therefore, the intraspecific variation found among accesses of P. guajava, P. guineense and P. acidum is probably a consequence of secondary metabolites that interfere with the intercalation of the propidium iodide fluorochrome to DNA in the staining step for nuclear suspension preparation for flow cytometry.\nWe also observed intraspecific variation of the nuclear 2C value among individuals, as well as in the relatives of P. myrtoides, P. cattleyanum and P. gaudichaudianum. The nuclear 2C value difference was: 2C = 0.40\u00a0pg between individuals of P. myrtoides, 2C = 5.03\u00a0pg of P. cattleyanum, and 2C = 2.76\u00a0pg of P. gaudichaudianum. For these species, the nuclear 2C value differences are close to or higher than the reference 1Cx value (1Cx = 0.475\u00a0pg P. guajava\u20141Cx = 0.490\u00a0pg P. oblongatum) at the basic chromosome number x = 11 of Psidium. Therefore, these values indicate that individuals of these species have different 2n chromosome numbers among each other, possibly arising from numerical chromosomal changes (euploidy and/or aneuploidy).\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1385 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27912-w\nAccording to the mean nuclear 2C values (Table\u00a02) and the data reported for diploid and polyploid Psidium species (Table\u00a01, http:// ccdb. tau. ac. il/ search/, https:// cvalu es. scien ce. kew. org/ search/ angio sperm), we suggest that accesses of the species P. acidum, P. rufum, P. friedrichsthalianum and P. gaudichaudianum are potential polyploids. Thus, individuals of these species probably have more than 2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes. However, chromosome number counting should be conducted to confirm the ploidy level.\nSix groups were identified in relation to the individual nuclear 2C value (Table\u00a03). Group I comprises the individuals with the smallest nuclear 2C value (2C = 0.90\u00a0pg to 2C = 1.10\u00a0pg), which include the diploid species\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1385 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27912-w\nP. guajava, P. oblongatum, and the P. machaense that, based on the 2C and 1Cx values, possible is a diploid species. Group II (2C = 1.80\u00a0pg\u20142C = 2.08\u00a0pg) has the tetraploid species P. guineense and P. acidum, as well as all 14 P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense hybrids, one individual of P. cattleyanum and seven individuals of Psidium sp. The evaluated P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense hybrids have 2C = 1.90\u00a0pg, exhibiting the same nuclear 2C value (Table\u00a02). This mean value is equivalent to the tetraploid genomic origin. Different progenies are possible considering the P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense crossing: (a) allotriploid hybrids (~ 2C = 1.43\u00a0pg) from the fusion of reduced reproductive cells of the two species, (b) allotetraploid hybrids (~ 2C = 1.91\u00a0pg) generated from the fusion of non-reduced reproductive cells of P. guajava and reduced P. guineense, (c) allopentaploid hybrids (~ 2C = 2.38\u00a0pg) formed by fusing reduced reproductive cells of P. guajava and non-reduced P. guineense, and (d) allohexaploid hybrids (~ 2C = 2.85\u00a0pg) arising from the fusion of non-reduced reproductive cells of the two species. Therefore, probably the P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense hybrids with 2C = 1.90\u00a0pg are the result of the fusion of non-reduced reproductive cells of P. guajava and reduced P. guineense. In addition, we found a P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense hybrid (Hib_11) mixoploid with 30% of cells with 2C = 0.95\u00a0pg (similar to diploid P. guajava) and 70% of cells with 2C = 1.90\u00a0pg (similar to tetraploid P. guineense) (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2).\nGroup III (2C = 2.72\u20142C = 4.38\u00a0pg) contains most of the individuals evaluated, including the species P. cattleyanum, P. myrtoides, P. rufum and one Psidium sp. Due to the variation in 2n chromosome number and ploidy level of P. cattleyanum and P. myrtoides (Table\u00a01), the group III includes possibly hexaploid and octaploid accesses. Group IV (2C = 4.47\u00a0pg\u20142C = 5.19\u00a0pg) has individuals from P. cattleyanum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. friedrichsthalianum and three Psidium sp, which are probably octaploids (Table\u00a01), as well as the only individual from group V of P. cattleyanum. Group VI includes the three individuals with the highest 2C values (2C = 6.83\u00a0pg\u20142C = 7.40\u00a0pg), two from P. cattleyanum and one from P. gaudichaudianum. Probably the accesses in group VI have a ploidy level higher than octaploid (2n = 8x = 88 chromosomes).\nPsidium cattleyanum showed the highest intraspecific variation of the nuclear 2C value, exhibiting individuals in five of the six groups. Differently, less intraspecific variation was confirmed for the diploid species P. guajava (all individuals in group I), for the tetraploids P. guineense and P. acidum (group II) and for the hexaploid P. myrtoides (group III, Table\u00a03).\nTable 3.

The largest intraspecific variations (~ 10%) were in P. myrtoides and P. cattleyanum, which are species that also show nuclear 2C value intraspecific variation. For the other species, the GC% ranged from 0.50% for P. acidum to 8.74% for P. guineense. The variation in the two half-sib families of P. myrtoides was 2.12% (Family 7) and 10.24% (Family 8). Within families of P. cattleyanum, a small variation was observed (1.36% for Family 7 and 3.47% for Family 3), despite intraspecific nuclear genome size variation in the species of up to 2C = 5.03\u00a0pg. The intraspecific variation of GC% was ~ 3.00% for the two families of P. guajava, and of ~ 2.10% P. gaudichaudianum (Table\u00a03).\nSeven groups were obtained from comparative GC% analysis. Psidium cattleyanum, P. guajava, P. guineense, P. myrtoides, P. gaudichaudianum, P. guajava \u00d7 P. guineense hybrids, and Psidium sp. showed individuals in at least two groups, evidencing GC% intraspecific variation. Groups III\u2014VI consisted of diploid and polyploid species. Only one family of P. cattleyanum showed greater stability being allocated only to group VII (Table\u00a03).\n5-mC%, yield and chemical composition of the essential oil. We compiled in Supplementary Table\u00a0S3 the unpublished and published values, for each Psidium individual, of 5-mC%, yield, and the percentage of the chemical compounds identified from the essential oil. 5-mC values varied between 16.34% (P. guajava) to 33.30% (P. myrtoides), and between 0.20% (P. guajava) to 0.95% (P. cattleyanum) for yield of the essential oil. A total of 56 compounds were identified for Psidium species. Of these compounds, 55 are chemically classified between hydrocarbons and oxygenated mono- and sesquiterpenes.\nRelationship of the mean nuclear 2C value, GC% and 5-mC% values, yield and chemical composition of the essential oil. The nuclear 2C and GC% values were positively correlated (correlation of 0.51). These values also had positive correlation with 5-mC% (correlation of 0.35 and 0.36, respectively) and with essential oil yield (correlation of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively). The variables related to genome (nuclear 2C value and GC%) and to epigenome (5-mC%) correlated negatively with (E)-Nerolidol (correlation of \u2212 0.64, \u2212 0.45 and \u2212 0.55, respectively), \u03b2-Bisabolol (correlation of \u2212 0.61, \u2212 0.46 and \u2212 0.35, respectively) and the group of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (\u2212 0.87, \u2212 0.70 and \u2212 0.46, respectively). The \u03b1-Pinene and the hydrocarbon monoterpene group were positively correlated with nuclear 2C value (correlation of 0.54 and 0.49, respectively) and 5-mC% (correlation of 0.60 and 0.53, respectively). The nuclear 2C value along with GC% correlated positively with the \u03b2-caryophyllene (correlation of 0.70 and 0.65, respectively), \u03b1-Copaene (correlation of 0.57 and 0.56, respectively) and the hydrocarbon sesquiterpene group (correlation of 0.42 and 0.52, respectively). These genomic data correlated negatively with 14-Hydroxy-epi-(E)-Caryophyllene (correlation of \u2212 0.50 and \u2212 0.46, respectively) and Selin-11-en-4a-ol (correlation \u2212 0.44 and \u2212 0.38, respectively), which belong the oxigenated sesquiterpene group. In addition, the \u03b2-Selinene and Hinesol correlated negatively with nuclear 2C value (correlation of \u2212 0.35 and \u2212 0.42 respectively).\nTPS gene copy number. Copy number of TPS genes was determined in diploid P. guajava (2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes and 2C = 0.95\u00a0pg) and tetraploid P. guineense (2n = 4x = 44 chromosomes and 2C = 1.90\u00a0pg). We expected the copy number to be exactly double in the tetraploid P. guineense. The genes showed distinct marking patterns when comparing the hybridization signal number in relation to the ploidy of the species. For the specific region used, we detected two hybridization signals in P. guajava and four in P. guineense nuclei (Fig.\u00a01).\nFrom the general primer of the conserved motives, the P. guajava nuclei showed four strong signals and four weak signals. P. guineense nuclei exhibited eight strong and eight weak signals (Fig.\u00a01). The presence of weak signals was considered as DNA sequences that have a relatively homology in relation to the probe, corresponding to regions that had the same origin, but that accumulated differences in the gene sequence. In addition, the weak hybridization signals can be resulted by occurrence of a single gene copy. Differently, the strong hybridization signals correspond to gene copies in tandem repeats, which form clusters that amplify the fluorescence signal.\nTherefore, we confirmed that the copy number of the TPS genes was directly related to the ploidy level of the species with double of signals found in the tetraploid P. guineense. This result also shows the genome evolution of these Psidium species."

            "text": "We report the nuclear 2C and GC% values, TPS gene copy number, as well as 5-mC% and essential oil yield and composition of a considerable number of Psidium species and individuals. The GC% values, with the exception of P. guajava12, are unpublished for all Psidium, as well as the nuclear 2C values for the P. acidum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. friedrichsthalianum, P. macahense and interspecific hybrids (P. guajava L. \u00d7 P. guineense). 5-mC% are also unpublished for P. cattleyanum, P. guineense, P. myrtoides, P. gaudichaudianum, P. friedrichsthalianum, P. oblongatum and one access of the genus. In addition, the determination of the TPS gene copy number evidenced other genomic outcomes of the polyploidy beyond the nuclear 2C and GC% interspecific variation. The results bring advances about the structure, organization and evolution of the genome and epigenome of Psidium species in inter- and intraspecific contexts, including analyses of related individuals. The genomic and epigenomic data were contextualized with the yield and diversity of compounds in the leaf essential oils, which are rich in mono- and sesquiterpenes that have ecological and economic importance for the Myrtaceae family.\nBased on the previous study of the our research group and the basic chromosome set of Psidium (x = 11), the 1C value varied from 0.465\u00a0pg (P. cauliforum\u2014diploid species) to 0.640\u00a0pg (P. longipetiolatum\u2014octaploid species), and the increase in ploidy culminated in the increase in nuclear DNA content8. Intraspecific variation in 2C value has been demonstrated for P. cattleyanum (2C = 2.00 to 2C = 7.03\u00a0pg), corroborating reports of naturally occurring individuals with varied chromosome numbers and ploidy levels for the species, which has cytotypes\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1385 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27912-w\nwith 2n = 46, 55, 58 and 8229; 33 (3x), 44 (4x), 55 (5x), 66 (6x), 77 (7x), 88 (8x), 99 (9x), 110 (10x) and 132 (12x)9 (Table\u00a01). Thus, the 2n chromosome number variation in this species can also be supported by the 2C nuclear value variation. Furthermore, we infer that euploidy occurs in the genus not only in P. cattleyanum, but also in P. gaudichaudianum and P. friedrichsthalianum due to the amplitude of 2C nuclear value variation.\nThe oosphere and the reproductive nucleus of the pollen grain are usually reduced reproductive cells (n\u2014 haploid). However, non-reduced and/ou aneuploid reproductive cells can be formed due to errors in anaphase I or II during meiosis, by the non-disjunction of chromosomes32, and/or by the non-occurrence of cytokinesis I or II. Thus, reproductive cells with different euploidy and/or aneuploidy can be generated. Individuals of P. cattleyanum and P. gaudichaudianum, including relatives, showed expressive variations in nuclear 2C value (possibly reflecting the 2n chromosome number) that may have resulted from the unilateral or bilateral fusion of reduced and unreduced reproductive cells. The unreduced reproductive cells may come from one (unilateral) or both parents (bilateral) in cross-fertilization or self-fertilization33. In addition, numerical chromosomal variations (euploidy and aneuploidy) can occur in cells of meristematic regions resulting in mixoploid tissues and/or individuals. Thus, the male and/or female reproductive organs of the flowers can have meiocytes with different chromosome numbers compared to the sporophyte. In this context, it is important to highlight the occurrence of a mixoploid individual (Hib_11), not yet reported in Psidium. The mixoploidy can compromise the stability and fertility of plants in the field and, thus, the use of these plants for breeding purposes is not very desirable34.\nIn general, polyploid species of Psidium present a greater geographical distribution compared to diploids8, with the exception of P. guajava because it is widely exploited and cultivated and, therefore, present in the most varied regions and biomes35. This fact was pointed out by our research group, considering species P. guajava, P. guineense, P. myrtoides, P. cattleyanum, P. longipetiolatum, P. oblongatum and P. cauliflorum8. In addition, the geographical distribution of P. cattleyanum cytotypes is influenced by the ploidy level. P. cattleyanum cytotypes with higher ploidy levels were identified in regions where the environmental conditions are more adverse, with higher temperatures, higher incidence of solar radiation and lower precipitation9,15,36. Therefore, the polyploid condition of the species studied here, may be favorable for expansion of their geographic distribution, both by natural and anthropic action. Hence, exploitation and utilization of these natural resources is relevant for breeding programs and for familiar production.\nWe verified inter- and intraspecific variations of GC% for the diploid and polyploid species. Although variations occurred, the overall mean 38.92% CG in Psidium is close to the mean value of 38.06% obtained by means of 22 diploid Eucalyptus species and three of the genus Corymbia, also species of the Myrtaceae family37.\nDue to 2C value and GC% variations in Psidium, especially in families, and their influence on secondary metabolism, we suggest, in a practical context, the individual pre-selection of plants to compose an experimental project, breeding program, germplasm bank or cultivation. In this sense, we recommended that the pre-selected accesses or individuals of Psidium should be vegetatively propagated, generating new individuals with the same 2n chromosome number, 2C nuclear value and GC% (genomic stability). On the other hand, inter- and intraspecific genomic diversity is important as a source of genetic resources for breeding.\nWe verified an increase in essential oil yield in Psidium due to the larger genome, evidencing the impact of the genomic changes (2n chromosome number and 2C nuclear value) in the secondary metabolism, which is a trait of ecological and economic importance. Experimentally, the tetraploid induction (2n = 4x = 72 chromosomes)\nFigure\u00a01. Copy number of TPS genes.\u00a0P. guajava\u00a0possesses one copy of the specific TPS gene (a), while\u00a0P. guineense\u00a0shows two copies of this gene (b). From the probe in conserved motifs, we evidenced eight fluorescence signals in P. guajava\u00a0(c) and sixteen in P. guineense\u00a0(d), being that strong fluorescence signals are related to cluster genes. Based on these results, we showed the polyploidy impact in the gene copy number in\u00a0Psidium.\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1385 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27912-w\nin Lippia integrifolia (family Verbenaceae) increases the essential oil yield compared to diploids (2n = 2x = 36 chromosomes), in addition to larger leaves and trichomes, structures related to essential oil yield38. Additionally, we showed by FISH that the polyploidy increases the copy number of the orthologs of two TPS genes related to essential oil biosynthesis of Psidium species. Therefore, the polyploidy, also evidenced by 2C nuclear value, affects the essential oil yield in Psidium from the diploid species (P. guajava 2n = 2x = 22 chromosomes) and the hitherto reported closest species P. guineense (2n = 2x = 44). The impact of the polyploidy in the essential oil traits can be related with the diversification and size of TPS gene family in Psidium species. The evolution of the TPS genes in the Myrtaceae family genomes have reported the largest TPS gene family in plants (Eucalyptus spp. having up to 100 genes)26,39 and occurrence of lineage-specific pathways and products. Although the essential oil of Psidium species exhibits a great diversity in its chemotypes conditioned to environmental and genetic variations24,27,40,41, the evolution of TPS genes in Myrtaceae neotropical fresh fruits remain unknown.\nThe increase of the values of 2C nuclear, CG% and 5-mC% was related to the decrease in (E)-Nerolidol and \u03b2-Bisabolol. Therefore, in addition to the genome effect (2n chromosome number, 2C nuclear value and GC%), chemical changes of the cytosine (5-mC) also influences composition of the essential oils. So, we showed the influence of the epigenetic control in the compound biosynthesis of the secondary metabolism in Psidium. The higher abundance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes was related to the occurrence of smaller genomes, with lower CG% and 5-mC%, indicating the genomic and epigenomic influence in this chemical class. In previous studies, the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes was clearly increased at the expense of hydrocarbons sesquiterpenes in spring in P. guajava genotypes42. Together, these data, which were reported for the first time, show the influence of genome and epigenome on essential oil yield and in specific compounds, suggesting for epigenetic control for terpene in Myrtaceae."

The suspensions were filtered through 20\u00a0\u00b5m nylon mesh (Partec) into tubes (Partec) and kept for 30\u00a0min in the dark.

The fluorescence peaks of the G0/G1 nuclei of each access and the standard were identified in the histograms using BD Accuri\u2122 C6 software. G0/G1 peaks with coefficient of variation (CV) less than 5% were considered for nuclear 2C value measurement in pg by the formula: nuclear 2C value of the access (pg) = [(mean G0/G1 peak channel of the access)*2.00\u00a0pg S. lycopersicum]/(mean G0/G1 peak channel of S. lycopersicum).\nFor GC%, nuclear suspensions were generated following the procedure adopted to measure the nuclear 2C value with some modifications: (a) the OTTO I and II buffers were not supplemented with RNAse, and (b) the OTTO II buffer was supplemented with 1.5\u00a0\u03bcM of 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, excitation/emission wavelengths: 320\u2013385/400\u2013580\u00a0nm).

The identification and semi-quantification of the leaf essential oil compounds were performed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID QP2010SE, Shimadzu, Japan) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS QP2010SE, Shimadzu, Japan). For these analyses, the following conditions were adopted: the carrier gas used was He for both detectors with flow rate and linear velocity of 2.80\u00a0mL\u00a0 min\u2212 1 and 50.80\u00a0cm\u00a0 sec\u2212 1 (GC-FID) and 1.98\u00a0mL\u00a0 min\u2212 1 and 50.90\u00a0cm\u00a0 sec\u2212 1 (GC\u2013MS), respectively; injector temperature was 220\u00a0\u00b0C at a split ratio of 1: 30; fused silica capillary column (30\u00a0m \u00d7 0.25\u00a0mm); Rtx5MS stationary phase (0.25\u00a0\u03bcm film thickness); the oven temperature had the following programming: initial temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C, which remained for 3\u00a0min and then the temperature was gradually increased at 3\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0 min\u2212 1 until it reached 180\u00a0\u00b0C, remaining for ten minutes, with a total analysis time of 59.67\u00a0min; the temperatures used in the FID and MS detectors are 240 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The sample used was drawn from the vial in a volume of 1 \u03bcL of a 3% solution of essential oil dissolved in 95% hexane.\nGC\u2013MS analyses were performed in an electron impact equipment with an energy of 70\u00a0eV; scanning speed of 1000; scanning interval of 0.50 fragments.sec\u2212 1 and detected fragments from 29 to 400 (m/z). GC-FID analyses were performed by a flame formed by H2 and atmospheric air with a temperature of 300\u00a0\u00b0C. Flow rates of 40\u00a0mL\u00a0 min\u2212 1 and 400\u00a0mL\u00a0 min\u2212 1 were used for H2 and air, respectively.\nIdentification of the essential oil compounds was performed by comparing the mass spectra in relation to available in the spectrophotometer database (Wiley 7, NIST 05 and NIST 05\u00a0s) and by the retention index (RI). For the RI calculation, a mixture of saturated C7-C40 alkanes (Supelco, USA) submitted under the same chromatographic conditions as the OE was used and the adjusted retention time of each compound was obtained using GC-FID. Then, the calculated values for each compound were compared with those in the literature49\u201351.\nCorrelation analysis. 2C value, GC%, 5-mC%, yield and content of each compound present in the essential oil were subjected to Pearson\u2019s correlation. The analysis was conducted in the R environment39 using the package \u201cAgricolae\u201d (https:// CRAN.R- proje ct. org/ packa ge= agric olae).\nTerpene synthase gene (TPS) copy number in P. guajava and P. guineense. We showed the polyploidy influence in the copy number of the genes involved with essential oil synthesis, the terpene synthase genes (TPS). These genes encode enzymes that act in essential oil synthesis pathways27,39,52\u201354. For this, we used the sequence of genes functionally characterized and involved in the synthesis of terpenes (TPS genes), which have been described and available in database ID AB266390.1 and ID MK873024.1. Through the BLAST tool, the similarity of these sequences was evaluated in relation to the TPS genes from the P. guajava genome annotation (data of the research group). The alignments that presented a score of at least 80% were selected for the design of the primers. From this, the primers were designed in the conserved motives of these TPS genes, considering mainly exon regions. Primers were designed and evaluated using the OligoIDTAnalyzer program (IDT). We defined two pairs of primers: the first (F 5\u2019-GGT GGG ATG TCG ATG CTA AA-3\u2019 and R 5\u2019-CTC TTC CTC CGT AAC TCT GTA TTG 3\u2019) specific to one predicted TPS gene orthologue with an amplicon 500 pb; and a general primer pair (F 5\u2019-CGA TTC CGG CTA CTT AGA CATC-3\u2019 and R 5\u2019-GTT CTT CCA GCG TCC CAT ATAC-3\u2019) aligned to the conserved motifs in eight predicted TPS genes of P. guajava genome, corresponding to sequences from 415 to 502 pb.\nThe DNA sequences of the putative TPS were amplified from P. guajava and P. guineense genomic DNA using the primers. Amplification reaction consisted of 50\u00a0ng genomic DNA, 200\u00a0\u00b5M dNTPs, 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M each R and F primers, 1 U GoTaq enzyme (Promega), 1X GoTaq enzyme reaction buffer and 1.8\u00a0mM MgCl2. Amplification conditions were initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, 58\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0s, 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min and a final extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. The amplification products were evaluated on 1.5% agarose gel and NanoDrop. Then, DNA probes were generated for each putative gene by a second PCR reaction on the same conditions described above, differing by the labeling with Tetramethyl-rhodamine 5-dUTP (Roche) for the specific or ChromaTide Alexa Fluor 488\u20135-dUTP (Life Technologies) for the general. Fluorescent in\u00a0situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in slides containing isolated and preserved nuclei to detect the number of hybridization signals corresponding to the TPS genes. Hybridization mix consisted of 50% formamide, 2X SSC and 200\u00a0ng of the probe. This mix was applied to the slide, which was covered with a coverslip, sealed with rubber cement and kept at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h. Post-hybridization wash was in 2X SSC at 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. Slides were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed on a photomicroscope Olympus BX60 equipped with epifluorescence and an immersion objective 100x/A.N. 1.4. At least 20 nuclei were scrambled for each species and for each gene using a 12-bit CCD digital video camera (Olympus) coupled to the photomicroscope and a computer with a digitizer plate. Captured images were processed by Image ProPlus 6.1 (Media Cybernetics).\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1385 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27912-w\nEthical approval.
