In this study, we explored which attributes play a role in the complex process that precedes this clinical decision. We also investigated whether the stuttering guidelines that are put in place in the health system of The Netherlands compared to its neighboring country Belgium and the years of experience have an impact on this decision. Methods & Procedures: This study used a cross-sectional design in which 36 speechlanguage pathologists, additionally trained in stuttering, completed a questionnaire. The speech-language pathologists spoke Dutch and resided in The Netherlands or in Belgium. They delivered more than one treatment approach to pre-school age children in their standard practice. Outcomes & Results: About two thirds of the speech-language pathologists take (1) the child\u2019s reactions to the stuttering (being frustrated by the stuttering, being sensitive to reactions of others towards the stuttering and being aware of the stuttering), (2) the child\u2019s language (and speech) skills, (3) the child\u2019s age, (4) the family\u2019s lifestyle, (5) the parent\u2019s intellectual capabilities and (6) the amount and quality of published research-based evidence mainly into consideration during their clinical decision-making process. Stuttering severity and time since onset are taken significantly more into consideration by experienced The choice for early stuttering treatment 4 speech-language pathologists than by less experienced speech-language pathologists when deciding the treatment approach (both U = 90, p = .05). Besides these two attributes, no significant difference was found for the level of experience or whether speech-language pathologists are expected to follow the recommendations of a stuttering guideline. Conclusions & Implications: This study was a first attempt to determine which child, family and evidence attributes speech-language pathologists take into consideration when deciding the treatment approach for a child and his family.

In this study, we explored which attributes play a role in the complex process that precedes this clinical decision. We also investigated whether the stuttering guidelines that are put in place in the health system of The Netherlands compared to its neighboring country Belgium and the years of experience have an impact on this decision. Methods & Procedures: This study used a cross-sectional design in which 36 speech-\nlanguage pathologists, additionally trained in stuttering, completed a questionnaire. The speech-language pathologists spoke Dutch and resided in The Netherlands or in Belgium. They delivered more than one treatment approach to pre-school age children in their standard practice. Outcomes & Results: About two thirds of the speech-language pathologists take (1) the child\u2019s reactions to the stuttering (being frustrated by the stuttering, being sensitive to reactions of others towards the stuttering and being aware of the stuttering), (2) the child\u2019s language (and speech) skills, (3) the child\u2019s age, (4) the family\u2019s lifestyle, (5) the parent\u2019s intellectual capabilities and (6) the amount and quality of published research-based evidence mainly into consideration during their clinical decision-making process. Stuttering severity and time since onset are taken significantly more into consideration by experienced\nspeech-language pathologists than by less experienced speech-language pathologists when deciding the treatment approach (both U = 90, p = .05). Besides these two attributes, no significant difference was found for the level of experience or whether speech-language pathologists are expected to follow the recommendations of a stuttering guideline. Conclusions & Implications: This study was a first attempt to determine which child, family\nand evidence attributes speech-language pathologists take into consideration when deciding the treatment approach for a child and his family.\n1 Introduction 2\nStuttering is a speech disorder that appears in 5% to 11% of children by the time they 3 are 4 years old [e.g., 1, 2, 3]. As the World Health Organization defines [4] it: \u201cStuttering, also 4 known as stammering, is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by 5 involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as 6 involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce 7 sounds\u201d(F98.5). 8\nIt is known that most pre-school age children (about 65-80 %) who start to stutter 9\nrecover without treatment within the first 4 years after onset [e.g., 5, 6, 7]. A period of (active) 10 monitoring is therefore often the first step before initiating treatment. It is not possible to 11 predict which child will recover from stuttering without intervention and which child won\u2019t. 12 Only about 6% of pre-school age children who stutter (PCWS) recover within the first 17 to 13 19.4 months after stuttering onset [6,8]. It is known that stuttering can be detrimental if it is 14 not being treated timely. In large cohort studies in which also PCWS participated [9, 10], 15 significantly more signs of difficulties in emotional, social and behavioural development and 16 lower wellbeing were observed in PCWS than in their peers who do not stutter. Therefore, 17 waiting too long for natural recovery is not the desired approach. Moreover, studies 18 conducted to investigate the efficacy of stuttering treatment usually report successful 19 outcome for PCWS, often in terms of fluency [e.g., 11, 12]. Natural recovery or recovery without 20 intervention occurs in a large proportion of PCWS [e.g., 6] and may partially explain this 21 successful outcome. The great neuroplasticity in pre-school age children probably explains 22 both natural recovery and recovery through treatment in PCWS [13]. 23\nFrom the reviews of Baxter et al. [14] and Nye et al. [15], it became clear that research 24 with PCWS has been conducted using different treatment approaches. The treatment 25 approaches of nearly all studies with PCWS (18/20 studies, 90%) were labeled as behavior 26 modification [14]. Baxter et al. [14] distinguish behavior modification studies further into those 27 achieving the modification in the child (mainly in the speech) and those achieving the 28 modification in the family (parent behavior and parent-child interaction). Blomgren [16] 29 distinguishes early intervention approaches as either multifactorial treatment approaches, 30 focusing on the environment of the child, or operant conditioning approaches, focusing on 31 the speech of the child. This distinction is frequently used for treatment approaches with 32 PCWS [e.g., 16, 17]. According to Blomgren [17], speech-language pathologists (SLPs) often 33 combine both approaches or start with a treatment approach focusing on the environment 34 and when no sufficient progress is noticeable, continue with a treatment approach focusing 35 on the child\u2019s speech. 36\nFrom the systematic reviews [e.g., 14, 15, 17], it became clear that most studies with 37 PCWS have been conducted with the Lidcombe Program. The Lidcombe Program is a 38 behavioral program for PCWS that aims at achieving (nearly) zero stuttering by creating 39 practice conversations during which a child speaks mostly without stuttering while receiving 40 praise or acknowledgements. Until now, only one randomized controlled study has been 41 conducted in which two different treatment approaches were compared, the Lidcombe 42 Program and the RESTART-Demands-Capacities-Model (RESTART-DCM) program [11]. 43 RESTART-DCM is a program for PCWS in which the demands towards communicative 44 situations are lowered and the capacities of the child are strengthened in order to achieve a 45 balance between the two which results in (near) zero stuttering. These two treatment 46\napproaches are the most frequently delivered approaches in The Netherlands. Both 47 programs in the study have different treatment goals with different criteria. The results of 48 the study must therefore carefully be interpreted, but in general, the results show a similar 49 treatment success. As a result of the study of de Sonneville-Koedoot et al. [11], the revised 50 Dutch stuttering guidelines suggest delivering one of these two treatment approaches as 51 first option for PCWS [18]. 52\nHealth care guidelines formulate recommendations for health care professionals 53 about screening, assessment or treatment and are based on the available published 54 research-based evidence. The research-based evidence is thoroughly appraised by a 55 Guidelines Development Committee. Stuttering specialists in The Netherlands, i.e., SLPs with 56 additional training in the assessment and treatment of stuttering, follow the 57 recommendations outlined in the Dutch stuttering guidelines in their standard practice. 58 Belgium is a neighboring country to The Netherlands with two main regions. People in the 59 northern region speak Dutch as those in The Netherlands. SLPs in Belgium also deliver the 60 Lidcombe Program and the RESTART-DCM program but less frequently than SLPs in The 61 Netherlands. SLPs in Belgium are not expected to follow the stuttering guidelines\u2019 62 recommendations. From a survey we know that SLPs in Belgium additionally deliver (mainly) 63 three other treatment approaches [19]: (1) Mini-KIDS, a treatment approach primarily aimed 64 at desensitizing the child towards moments of stuttering and training the motor fluency 65 loop[20], (2) the social-cognitive behavior therapy, a multifactorial program primarily aimed 66 at preventing or limiting the development of stuttering and at decreasing the symptoms [21] 67 and the (3) Parent-Child Interaction (PCI) program, which focuses on modification of the 68 interaction style of parents, on family strategies to support the management of the 69\nstuttering and if necessary on speech management strategies with the child [22]. Besides 70 these programs, Eggers and Van Eerdenbrugh [19] indicated that Belgian SLPs often prefer an 71 eclectic approach. Other treatment approaches, such as the family-focused approach 72 described by Yaruss et al. [23] or the Westmead Program [e.g., 24], are not frequently delivered 73 in The Netherlands and in Belgium. A brief overview of these five treatment approaches 74 follows. 75\nThe Lidcombe Program [e.g., 12, 25, 26] is a program that aims to achieve (near) zero 76 levels of stuttering. Parents are intensely involved, but treatment is focused on the child. 77 The child practices each day to speak without or with very limited stuttering for 10 to 15 78 minutes. This is called a practice session. Parents are shown how they can organize these 79 practice sessions and how they can provide verbal contingencies. Verbal contingencies are a 80 type of verbal feedback. They are given for the stutter-free speech during the daily practice 81 conversations and occasionally during everyday conversations throughout the day. At a later 82 time, if the child responds well to the verbal contingencies and parents give them correctly 83 and adequately, parents also provide verbal contingencies for stuttering. The verbal 84 contingencies for stuttering, however, are given significantly less frequently compared to 85 verbal contingencies for stutter-free speech. In Stage 1 of the program, (near) zero levels of 86 stuttering are achieved; in Stage 2 of the program, the (near) zero levels of stuttering are 87 maintained. Parents are prepared to re-initiate treatment in case relapse occurs. Throughout 88 the program, progress is visualized by severity ratings, assigned daily by the parents (after 89 the necessary coaching) and weekly by the SLP. 90 The Lidcombe Program requires intensive parent involvement for treatment 91 implementation. Not surprisingly, Goodhue et al. [27] mention parent-reported obstacles 92\nsuch as finding the time or forgetting to implement the daily practice conversations with the 93 PCWS and having siblings around when having the practice conversations with the PCWS. 94 They also mention parent-reported benefits of the Lidcombe Program, such as an increase in 95 quality time with the child, an increase of knowledge and management of the stuttering and 96 improved parenting skills. Parents also experience various emotions during the Lidcombe 97 Program delivery, often related to the development of the stuttering, including 98 empowerment versus responsibility, anxiety, guilt, distress and cycles of confidence. The 99\nimplementation of the Lidcombe program is only successful if parents can make the time for 100 daily practice conversations, are compliant or want to take the responsibility to implement 101 treatment at home. 102 The Lidcombe Program in the clinic-based format has been investigated extensively for its 103 efficacy [e.g., 11, 12, 28] and its effectiveness [e.g., 29]. It has been trialed in other formats than the 104 clinic-based format such as group format [30], webcam format [31] and formats with less 105 verbal contingencies than standard [e.g., 32]. Besides this, the implementation of the Lidcombe 106 Program has been investigated with several foci such as the relationship between parent 107 and PCWS [33], the speech and language of the parent and child [34], the phonological 108 development of the child [35], Lidcombe Program experiences of parents [27, 36] and challenges 109 of parents and SLPs when delivering or implementing the Lidcombe Program [37]. These 110 studies were preceded by studies about validating the stuttering severity rating scale used in 111 the Lidcombe Program [e.g., 38, 39]. 112\nThe RESTART-DCM is a program that is based on the multifactorial Demands and 113 Capacities Model [e.g., 40]. The aim of RESTART-DCM is to reduce the demands of the 114 communicative situations for the child and to promote the capacities to meet the 115\nexpectations of the communicative situations to achieve a favorable balance between the 116 two with normally fluent speech as a result [41]. Positive changes in the motoric, linguistic, 117 emotional and/or cognitive functioning of a PCWS and his environment tend to lead to 118 (near) zero levels of stuttering. The (near) zero levels of stuttering are achieved by behavior 119 change, emotion coping and skills training. The treatment approach always starts by 120 addressing the environment of the child, mainly to reduce the demands that the 121 environment of the child imposes to communicative situations in which the child is involved. 122 For each child and family, those demands differ. The lowering of the demands is established 123 by counseling and training of the parents, the child and the wider environment like siblings, 124 teachers and significant others. This is mainly done by modelling slower, more relaxed 125 speech with ample pauses between utterances, parallel talk, recasts, describing the child\u2019s 126 emotions and adequate turn taking. This is a temporary intervention strategy as it sounds 127 somewhat artificial to communicate in this way. By reducing the demands, the child often 128 becomes more fluent. If necessary, when a child is still stuttering although demands have 129 been successfully reduced, explicit training of relevant capacities of the child is added to the 130 program while the reduced demands are maintained in the communicative situations. Again, 131 only if the child is still stuttering, a third treatment phase will be initiated: enhancing fluency 132 more directly. In this phase, the child will experience other ways of speaking (e.g., 133 slower/quicker rate, with longer/shorter speech movements) and other ways of stuttering 134 (with easy repetitions compared to prolongations, with an easy, slightly prolonged onset 135 compared to a block). Based on these practice experiences, the child may more frequently 136 use other, more effortless ways of speaking. It is never a goal to ask the child to speak this 137 way during everyday situations. 138 Parents are intensively involved to implement the RESTART-DCM program in the daily home 139\nenvironment. Therefore, similar parent-associated challenges may apply as mentioned for 140 the Lidcombe Program. It is possible that SLPs find this treatment approach better suited for 141 young PCWS or for PCWS who stutter mildly because the treatment focuses on the 142 environment first. De Sonneville-Koedoot et al. [42] reported that, after the randomized 143 controlled trial [11], six of 13 participating SLPs had a preference for RESTART-DCM for young 144 PCWS, two for PCWS who stutter mildly and two for precocious PCWS. 145 A small study comparing RESTART-DCM with the Lidcombe Program [43] preceded the 146 extensive randomized controlled trial [11]. In addition, de Sonneville-Koedoot et al. [44] 147 analyzed the economical implications of both treatment approaches and investigated the 148 experiences of delivering the two treatment approaches [42]. 149\nThe social cognitive behavior therapy is based on the knowledge about the social-150 cognitive learning theory, behavior therapy, cognition and emotion [21]. The program 151 assumes that stuttering is a complex disorder in which cause, triggers and consequences are 152 often mixed up. Multiple aspects are involved in the onset, the development and the 153 persistence of stuttering. The program aims to prevent or to minimize the development of 154 stuttering and to reduce the stuttering symptoms. It also aims to develop increased 155 competence for speaking and a realistic and positive feeling about speaking in the child. SLPs 156 teach the child skills to deal with diverse communicative situations and to handle diverse 157 listener reactions. For each behavior, a specific aim is formulated with criteria to facilitate 158 evaluation with baseline (e.g., establishing eye contact during the conversation with a 159 criterion % eye contact, desensitizing parents for the stuttering of their child, increasing the 160 competences to deal with teasing and bullying). There is a treatment phase and a follow-up 161 phase. The treatment phase runs through five modules: (1) conditioning of the speaking 162\nsituation, to turn around speaking activities into positive experiences and to help the child 163 with techniques that are modelled by the parent, (2) cognitive restructuring focused on 164 emotions, to help children report and vent about emotions, (3) cognitive restructuring 165 focused on cognitions, to turn around negative thoughts by helping the child formulate 166 positive thoughts, (4) emotional restructuring, to create an impact on certain emotions that 167 trigger certain stuttering behavior, and (5) skill training, to use speech and language in 168 different ways in games and functionally for example to ask something, to get something or 169 to explain something. When the goals of the modules are achieved, children move to the 170 follow-up phase. During the follow-up phase, the left-over disfluencies are evaluated for 171 normality. If stuttering persists, the severity is rated, and the existing aspects are evaluated 172 whether they have a persisting or triggering effect on the stuttering. The social cognitive 173 behavior therapy also includes a parent program, for which the SLP organizes ten parent 174 group meetings spread over several months in which they receive information about 175 stuttering and meet other parents. 176\nBecause the social cognitive behavior therapy focuses on dealing with emotional and 177 cognitive reactions towards the stuttering, it is possible that SLPs prefer this treatment 178 approach especially for PCWS who react emotionally or negatively towards their stuttering. 179 This treatment approach is investigated as a topic of a doctoral dissertation and was only 180 published in a book, written in Dutch [21]. 181\nMini-KIDS is a program that is based on the techniques of stuttering modification [45]. 182 Waelkens [20], a Belgian stuttering specialist, developed and structured the program for 183 PCWS, based on her long-term practice experience. The program consists of three or four 184 stages, depending on the age and progress of the child. The stages consequently follow each 185\nother. In stage 1, Desensitisation, SLPs use pseudo-stuttering to desensitize the child and 186 parent for the child\u2019s stuttering. Depending on the tolerance of parent and child towards 187 pseudo-stuttering, this stage can take more or less time. The goal of this stage is that the 188 child is not afraid to stutter. Stage 2, Identification, is only included in the program for 4-6-189 year old children (not for younger children). The child uses pseudo-stuttering and describes 190 the type of stuttering (e. g. \u201clong word\u201d = prolongation, \u201cfrog word\u201d = repetition, \u201cstuck 191 word\u201d = block) and the quality (e. g. \u201chard\u201d = for tense sounds, \u201csoft\u201d for relaxed sounds). 192 Parents also use pseudo-stuttering in their speech when talking to the child. Parents and 193 child have daily practice sessions at home. Stage 3, Modification, is only necessary for 194 children who still have moments of stuttering with tense prolongations or blocks. The child 195 will morph the tense moment of stuttering into a relax moment of stuttering. Parents and 196 child have daily practice sessions at home or they practise in natural conversations. In stage 197 4, Generalisation, there are two scenarios: (1) The child continues to use the modification 198 techniques if necessary and wanted in other than practice situations. The child does this 199 with an internal locus of control; that is, he wants to use the technique, he thinks about how 200 to use the technique and he decides when to use the technique; (2) The child does not need 201 the technique as the moments of stuttering have disappeared. In both cases, the levels of 202 stuttering are (near) zero. Parents know that relapse can occur and know what to do in case 203 it does. When the SLP concludes that the stuttering has reached (near) zero levels of 204 stuttering, the Follow-up phase commences in which the program\u2019s defined (near) zero 205 levels of stuttering are maintained. 206 One stage of the Mini-KIDS program requires sufficient meta-cognitive skills of a child to 207 understand the features of a stuttering moment (such as \u201cfrog\u201d word, \u201clong\u201d word). The 208 Mini-KIDS program also focuses on dealing with the left-over stuttering at the end of 209\ntreatment. It is possible that SLPs consider Mini-KIDS better suited for older PCWS, PCWS 210 who stutter more severely or PCWS with a family member who stutters. 211 The Mini-KIDS program is described in a book, written in Dutch [20]. No evidence about the 212 treatment outcome or implementation of the Mini-KIDS program is yet available. 213\nThe Palin PCI-approach [22] was developed at the Michael Palin Centre in London. 214 Similar to the RESTART-DCM-program, the Palin PCI-approach is based on the premise that 215 stuttering is a heterogeneous, multifactorial condition and that linguistic, physiological, 216 environmental and emotional attributes influence its onset and course [22]. It focuses on 217 adjusting the interaction between parents and children to establish (near) zero levels of 218 stutter-free speech. Both parents are required to attend the clinic-based sessions if possible. 219 SLPs provide interaction strategies and family strategies during six clinic-based sessions. 220 Interaction strategies include reducing parental speech rate, following the child\u2019s lead in play 221 and using simplified language. Examples of family strategies are assisting in managing 222 anxiety and children\u2019s emotions and setting boundaries and routines. If necessary, strategies 223 focusing on the child\u2019s speech, are implemented as well. These strategies include using easy 224 onset, turn-taking and increasing the frequency and duration of pauses. Parents and children 225 are asked to have Special Times at home to practice these strategies. Video recordings of the 226 Special Times facilitate identification of correct implementation of the strategies. 227 Parents implement the treatment at home with the child. Therefore, parent challenges 228 similar as for the RESTART-DCM program and the Lidcombe Program and a preference of 229 SLPs to deliver the Palin-PCI approach for certain PCWS similar as for the RESTART-DCM 230 program is expected. 231 The Palin PCI-approach has been investigated in a randomized study [22] and a longitudinal 232 study [46]. These studies, however, were always small. A recent experimental study [47] 233\ninvestigated the Palin PCI-approach, the Lidcombe Program and a combined approach 234 indicating that the Lidcombe Program and the combined approach resulted in more fluent 235 speech. Millard and Davis [48] also assessed the psychometric properties of the Palin Parent 236 Rating Scales. 237 These five treatment approaches have several features in common. The programs (1) 238 intensely involve parents in treatment; (2) require parents to attend the session in the clinic 239 with the PCWS; (3) schedule visits during treatment at a weekly basis; (4) include a 240 treatment and a follow-up phase (except for the Palin PCI-approach); (5) include practice 241 moments at home focused at giving the child the opportunity to experience speaking as a 242 positive experience, with parents organizing them and (6) aim for reduced stuttering as a 243 primary or secondary goal. 244 The treatment approaches differ in (1) their focus during treatment; (2) how they involve the 245 parents and the PCWS; (3) their primary goals and (4) the starting point for the follow-up 246 phase. In some treatment approaches, achieving occasional stuttering is the starting 247 criterion for the follow-up phase, including mild stuttering moments without tension (e.g., 248 the Mini-KIDS program and the RESTART-DCM-program). In other treatment approaches, 249 achieving no or nearly no stuttering is the aim (e.g. The Lidcombe Program), knowing that 250 this is not feasible for all PCWS. It is likely that because of these differences, SLPs prefer one 251 approach above another for certain PCWS and families. 252 Not all treatment approaches are evidence-based and the quality (strength) of 253 available evidence differs. Evidence-based practice is based on three pillars [49] (Figure 1). 254 Dollaghan [50] presented the E3BP concept and explained evidence-based practice as: \u201cThe 255 conscientious, explicit, and judicious integration of (1) best available external evidence from 256 systematic research, (2) best available evidence internal to clinical practice, and (3) best 257\navailable evidence concerning the preferences of a fully informed patient\u201d (p. 2). Others 258 refer to the three types of evidence from the E3BP concept as research evidence, practice 259 evidence and patient evidence [e.g., 51]. 260 In a study of McCurtin and Carter [51], 48 SLPs mentioned that practice evidence and 261 research evidence usually support their treatment decisions, whereas patient evidence 262 hardly does. McCurtin and Carter concluded that scientific thinking is a component of 263 decision-making, but it does \u201cnot necessarily reflect evidence-based practice as typically 264 constructed\u201d (p. 1148). This may explain why SLPs in Belgium deliver more than the two 265 treatment approaches for the treatment of PCWS [19], despite the recommendations 266 outlined in the Dutch guidelines which are based on research evidence, and why SLPs tend 267 to prefer one program above another. It would be interesting to know if SLPs who are 268 expected to follow the recommendations of the stuttering guidelines consider different child 269 and family attributes to make the clinical decision on the choice of treatment. 270 The decision when a PCWS needs treatment and when to start it, is preceded by a 271 clinical reasoning process which is out of scope of this study. Once decided that treatment 272 needs to be started, choosing to deliver one treatment approach and not another for the 273 PCWS is the scope of this study. What underpins the SLPs\u2019 clinical reasoning in making this 274 specific decision, however, is unknown. SLPs probably consider different child and family 275 attributes to decide which treatment approach they will start with the PCWS and the family. 276 From extensive research conducted on the delivery of the Lidcombe Program it has become 277 clear that certain child and family attributes may have an impact on treatment duration or 278 may be more challenging for treatment implementation than others. For example, time 279 since onset and pre-treatment stuttering severity were reported to have an impact on the 280 duration of treatment with the Lidcombe Program [52]. The impact of time since onset for 281\ntreatment duration was not confirmed in later studies [e.g., 53] but the impact of pre-282 treatment stuttering severity was for the delivery of other stuttering treatments (not 283 specified) for PCWS [e.g., 54] and of the Lidcombe Program [53]. Druker et al. also mention 284 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a child attribute that often prolongs treatment 285 time. None of these, however, are conclusive to predict treatment duration or ease of 286 treatment implementation for a PCWS; that is, they do not apply to all PCWS. Goodhue et 287 al.[27] and Van Eerdenbrugh et al. [37] reported child and family challenges such as PCWS with 288 a (twin) sibling who stutters, perfectionist or sensitive PCWS, a family\u2019s busy lifestyle, 289 parents with a learning disorder, weaker intellectual capabilities, feelings of anxiety, a 290 depression, a troublesome relationship with their PCWS, a parent who is stuttering or a 291 divorced family situation. It is important to realize however, that Van Eerdenbrugh et al. 292 reported them as challenges, not as obstacles or problems. That is, if treatment is 293 individualized to the PCWS and family, they can be overcome. They are associated with the 294 Lidcombe Program, but they may as well apply to other treatment approaches. Recently, 295 Park et al. [55] found that parent impulsivity was related to increased drop-out when 296 delivering the Lidcombe Program. Furthermore, they found that higher CELF-core scores 297 were associated with better treatment outcome at 6 to 9 months and easier temperament 298 with better treatment outcome at 12 to 18 months. These findings, however, were 299 statistically, not clinically, significant. That is, they only applied to a small amount of 300 treatment outcome (to 3% and 4%, respectively). 301 SLPs in The Netherlands and in Belgium make a clinical decision about which 302 treatment approach to start. This clinical decision process involves taking child and family 303 attributes into account. In general, clinical decision-making is a complex process that 304 generally involves two types of processing information. These two types of processing are 305\ndescribed as the dual process theory [56]. The first type of processing uses intuition. The 306 retrieval of knowledge through this type of processing is fast, frugal and effortless [57]. It 307 assumes that the brain has constructed mental maps and patterns, a sort of \u201cinternalised 308 tacit guidelines\u201d (p. 4) through repetition and rehearsal. The second type uses careful and 309 rational evaluation of the information. This process requires effort and is time consuming. It 310 is generally known that more experienced professionals mainly use the first type of 311 processing, whereas less experienced professionals rather use the second. The study of 312 Dudding and Pfeiffer [58] shows that speech-language pathology students accelerate their 313 clinical reasoning process after more extensive practice. Ginsberg et al. [59] compared the 314 diagnostic reasoning process for two case studies of 15 SLPs with more than 5 years of 315 experience with SLPs just entering the profession. The two groups of SLPs used a different 316 process to take a decision. From these studies, we can expect that the findings of Bate et al. 317 [57] also apply to SLPs. So, it can be questioned if SLPs who just entered the profession 318 consider other child or family attributes than more experienced SLPs. 319 In this study, we aimed at improving our insight in the attributes that SLPs who 320 deliver more than one treatment approach for PCWS take into consideration when choosing 321 a specific treatment approach for a child. To understand which attributes are taken into 322 consideration when choosing a treatment approach and which attributes are decisive to 323 choose for a specific treatment approach, it was necessary to only include the SLPs who 324 deliver more than one treatment approach. The research questions of this study were: 325 (1) Which attributes are most frequently taken into consideration by SLPs 326 when deciding which treatment approach to deliver to a PCWS? 327\n(2) Do experience and following the recommendations of the Dutch 328 stuttering guidelines have an impact on which attributes SLPs take into 329 consideration? 330 331 Materials and methods 332 Participants 333 In this cross-sectional study, the participants were 36 SLPs specialized in stuttering 334 (response rate of 37.5%, see figure 1). Inclusion criteria were: (1) being trained in one or 335 more stuttering programs for PCWS, (2) residing and working in The Netherlands or in 336 Belgium and (3) treating PCWS. Nineteen SLPs delivered only one treatment approach and 337 were therefore excluded from the analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the SLPs. 338 Two SLPs were male. More SLPs from The Netherlands (n = 25) than from the Dutch-339 speaking region of Belgium (n = 11) completed the questionnaire. 340 341\nFIGURE 1 about here 342 343\nThe SLPs from The Netherlands were significantly older (50.32 \u00b1 10.40) than the SLPs 344\nfrom Belgium (32.18 \u00b1 10.57), t(34) = 4.80, p < .01. Not surprisingly, they also have 345\nsignificantly more years of experience in treating PCWS (19.32 \u00b1 10.91) than the SLPs from 346\nBelgium (8.82 \u00b1 11.07), t(34)= 2.65, p = .012. SLPs from The Netherlands treated more PCWS 347\nper week but the difference is not statistically significant (9.44 \u00b1 7.55 for SLPs from The 348 Netherlands and 5.27 \u00b1 3.29 for SLPs from Belgium, t(34)= 1.75, p = .09). The number of 349 trained SLPs, the country of residence and the treatment approaches they deliver is shown 350 in Table 1. 351\n352\nTABLE 1 about here 353 354 Some of these SLPs mentioned that they also use other treatment approaches for PCWS 355 such as a combination of programs (n = 1), relaxation treatment (n = 1), play therapy (n = 1), 356 parent coaching (n = 2) and eclectic work (n = 1). Because of the incidental reporting, they 357 were not included in the analysis. 358 Most SLPs reported deciding in more than one way which treatment approach they 359 will deliver to the PCWS and the family. About two thirds (n = 25; 69.4%) reported to decide 360 together with the parents. Almost half of the SLPs (n = 16; 43.2%) reported to parents they 361 have a preference for one treatment approach depending on the situation. A minority (n = 5; 362 13.9%) reported that they have a preference for one treatment approach based on their 363 own skills. Three (8.3%) reported that they choose for the parents. Three SLPs (8.3%) 364 reported giving the choice to the parents. 365 366 Procedure 367 Recruitment 368 SLPs, additionally trained in stuttering, were contacted via email by the authors of 369\nthis study. Also, a message appeared in the newsletter of the Dutch Association of 370 Logopedics and Phoniatrics (NVLF) and the Dutch Association of SLPs (NVST). Recruitment 371 started in December 2019 and was finalized in July 2020. 372 The SLPs gave their consent to the study at the beginning of the questionnaire. 373 374 Construction of the questionnaire 375\nThe questionnaire consisted of a general part with questions about the SLP\u2019s age, gender, 376 case load, location of stuttering practice, training and habits related to who is involved in the 377 decision-making process. 378 The child and family attributes that were questioned were age, gender, language skills, 379 ability to sit still, ability to follow instructions, awareness of the stuttering, frustration by the 380 stuttering, stuttering severity, time since onset, excessive speech rate, extreme sensitivity to 381 the reactions of others to the stuttering, level of perfectionism, bilingualism, experiences 382 with bullying, concomitant speech- or language disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, 383 Attentional Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, behavior problems, easy distraction, part of a twin 384 (both PCWS) and sibling(s) who stutters. Family attributes were lifestyle of a family, ability to 385 steer a conversation with the PCWS, playing habits, stuttering of the parent who is 386 implementing the treatment, stuttering of someone in the family, learning disorder, weaker 387 intellectual capabilities, feelings of anxiety, depression, troublesome relationship with the 388 PCWS and a divorced family situation. These attributes were mentioned either as challenges 389 [37], as obstacles or benefits [27], or were reported in association with stuttering recovery [e.g., 390 60, 61, 62], treatment duration or treatment outcome [e.g., 52, 53, 54, 55] or drop-out [e.g., 54]. When 391 relevant, a secondary question followed about how the attribute has an impact on the 392 decision (e.g., \u201cif a child is 2-3 years old, you rather decide to initiate ...\u201d; \u201cif a child is 4-5 393 years old, ...\u201d). 394 Finally, a question about whether the amount and quality of research-based scientific 395 evidence has an impact on the treatment choice, and two questions giving the opportunity 396 to add additional information about the factors or general information concluded the 397 questionnaire. 398\nThe questionnaire was provided in Qualtrics, a software program for electronic 399 questionnaires. Data were transferred from Qualtrics to SPSS. 400 The STROBE checklist was used to write the report of the study. 401 402 Analysis 403 Descriptive statistics were used to determine which attributes are most frequently 404 taken into account when SLPs decide which treatment approach they will deliver. To 405 determine whether years of experience and having recommendations from stuttering 406 guidelines that need to be followed have an impact on deciding the treatment approach per 407 attribute, Mann Whitney tests were performed. SLPs were grouped into the experienced 408 group if they had \u2265 5 years of experience (n = 26); SLPs with < 5 years (n = 10) in the less 409 experienced group. 410 411 Results 412 Table 2 presents an overview of the child, family and evidence attributes that SLPs 413 reported that can have an impact on the choice for treatment. 414 415\nTABLE 2 about here 416 417 Stuttering severity and time since onset are taken significantly more into account by 418 experienced SLPs than by less experienced SLPs when deciding the treatment approach 419 (both U = 90, p = .05). Of the 26 experienced SLPs, eight take these two attributes into 420 consideration when making the decision versus none of the 10 less experienced SLPs. There 421 is no difference in how SLPs from The Netherlands (who have stuttering guidelines put in 422\nplace) and from Belgium take any of the attributes into account when deciding the 423 treatment approach (p > .05 for all attributes). 424 425 Table 3 presents what SLPs tend to prefer as treatment option for the most 426 frequently reported attributes. SLPs did not always report that they have a treatment 427 preference for each attribute and often did not specify how they take the attribute into 428 account. 429 430\nTABLE 3 about here 431 432 The majority of SLPs who are trained in the RESTART-DCM program prefer this program for 433 PCWS who are sensitive to reactions of others, who are perfectionist or who have weak 434 language skills. Nearly half of them prefer the RESTART-DCM program for young children. 435 Also, about one third of the SLPs trained in the Palin-PCI approach prefer this program for 436 younger children. The majority of the SLPs who are trained in the social cognitive behavior 437 therapy prefer to deliver this program to PCWS who are frustrated by their stuttering or to 438 PCWS with concomitant speech or language disorders. Nearly half of them prefer the social 439 cognitive behavior therapy for perfectionist PCWS. About one third of the SLPs trained in the 440 Mini-KIDS program and about one fifth of the SLPs trained in the Lidcombe Program prefer 441 these programs for children who are aware of their stuttering. Nearly half of the SLPs trained 442 in the RESTART-DCM program prefer to deliver this program to families with a busy lifestyle, 443 to parents who have a troublesome relationship with their PCWS or parents with lower IQ. 444 Nearly a third of the SLPs who are trained in the Mini-KIDS program prefer this program for 445 parents with lower IQ. Other than these, there is a lot of variation in the responses and 446\nmany SLPs did not indicate to have a preference for treatment approach for most of the 447 attributes. 448 449 Discussion 450 This study tried to gain insight in how SLPs, specialized in stuttering, make decisions 451 when they start treatment with a PCWS and their family. The attributes that are most 452 frequently taken into consideration are whether children are sensitive to reactions of others 453 towards their stuttering (72.2%) or feeling frustrated about their stuttering (58.3%). It is 454 known that PCWS can experience varied feelings about their stuttering [63, 64]. The majority 455 (77.4%) of the SLPs that are trained in the RESTART-DCM program prefers to deliver this 456 program to PCWS who are sensitive to reactions of others. The majority of the SLPs that are 457 trained in the social cognitive behavior therapy (60%) prefers to deliver this program to 458 PCWS who are frustrated towards their stuttering over other treatment programs. It is 459 possible that SLPs have this preference because a child is not directly treated for stuttering 460 in these programs. Or, being frustrated may correspond with certain temperament features 461 such as negative reactivity. It could be possible that some SLPs think that a direct treatment 462 approach is not the most suitable treatment approach for such children if there are other 463 treatment approaches available to them. 464 Temperamental aspects, mainly emotional reactivity and self-regulation, get 465 increasingly more attention in research with PCWS the past decade [e.g., 65, 66, 67, 68]. Jones et 466 al. [67] claim that they could have an impact on long-term treatment results. This increased 467 research attention and consequent findings may be reflected in the daily practice of the SLPs 468 who responded to the questionnaire in this study. 469\nFurthermore, most SLPs take concomitant language or speech problems (66.7%) and 470 language skills (63.9%) into consideration when choosing a treatment approach for the 471 PCWS. Again, about half of the SLPs trained in the RESTART-DCM program have a preference 472 for this program for PCWS with weak language skills and about half of the SLPs trained in the 473 social cognitive behavior therapy prefer this program for children with concomitant speech 474 and language disorders. It is possible that SLPs believe it a benefit if language demands in 475 the environment are lowered for children with weak language skills. Research, however, 476 shows that language development does not stagnate when a direct treatment program such 477 as the Lidcombe Program is implemented, on the contrary [e.g., 34, 69]. Many PCWS present 478 with concomitant speech or language difficulties [e.g., 70, 71]. Already in a practical sense, SLPs 479 need to take the existing speech and language skills into consideration to decide whether 480 they treat both disorders in the PCWS concurrently (blended approach), sequentially (cyclic) 481 or in another way [e.g., 70]. Research on differences between language and speech skills in 482 PCWS and in pre-school age children who do not stutter generate, however, mixed results: 483 in some studies group differences were found for phonology skills [72] and language skills [73]. 484 In other studies, no differences were found for articulation skills [73, 74,75 ] or phonology skills 485 [72, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80]. 486 Most SLPs take age, awareness of stuttering and level of perfectionism (all 55.6%) 487 into consideration when making a choice for treatment. Again, about half of the SLPs trained 488 in the RESTART-DCM program and one third of the SLPs trained in the Palin-PCI approach 489 would deliver the RESTART-DCM program or the Palin-PCI approach to younger children. 490 Possibly, SLPs prefer treatment that do not directly involve the child for younger PCWS. On 491 the other hand, as many SLPs would deliver one of the programs focusing on the speech of 492\nthe child (the Lidcombe Program or the Mini-KIDS program) similarly to younger as to older 493 PCWS. 494 The same indecisive preference was found for the attribute busy lifestyle for all 495 treatment programs except for the RESTART-DCM program. Most SLPs (63.9%) take the 496 attribute of having a busy family life into account when choosing the treatment approach. 497 The impact of this attribute on the implementation of the treatment has been reported for 498 the Lidcombe Program [e.g., 27, 37]. Given the active involvement of parents that is required in 499 the treatment of the PCWS, regardless of the choice of treatment approach, it is not 500 surprising that family attributes such as lower intelligence or a disturbed parent-child 501 relationship are attributes that are also taken into account by many SLPs (63.9% and 55.6%) 502 when deciding the stuttering treatment approach for the PCWS. Van Eerdenbrugh et al. [37] 503 reported them anecdotally as potential challenges that can be overcome by appropriate 504 individualization of certain treatment components of the Lidcombe Program such as practice 505 sessions. 506 SLPs did not report a preference for several attributes even though they take them 507 into account for their decision. This indicates that they may not have a preference for a 508 treatment approach but that they individualize a treatment approaches towards certain 509 attributes. Also, SLPs frequently did not have one preference but would deliver more than 510 one treatment approach to a PCWS or a family with a specific attribute. 511 About two-thirds of the SLPs (69.4%) take the amount and quality of available 512 published research-based evidence into consideration when deciding which treatment 513 approach that they will deliver to the PCWS and the family. Not all SLPs support their choice 514 with existing research evidence even though the Dutch stuttering guidelines [18] based their 515 recommendations on the existing research evidence. Just like McCurtin and Carter [51] 516\nconcluded, the SLPs do not only support their clinical decision-making process with research 517 evidence. That may be the explanation for the variety of treatment approaches that SLPs 518 from this study deliver. It also explains why there is no significant difference between the 519 SLPs from The Netherlands, who are expected to follow the recommendations formulated 520 by the Dutch stuttering guidelines, and the SLPs from Belgium, who are not. 521 The more experienced SLPs take severity and time since onset into consideration 522 when deciding which treatment approach that they will deliver to the PCWS and their family. 523 Kingston et al. [52] reported longer treatment time with the Lidcombe Program for PCWS 524 more severely and treatment results that were achieved more quickly for children with 525 longer time since onset (which were typically the older PCWS). In later publications, this 526 latter finding was not replicated [e.g., 53]. De Sonneville et al. [11] also noticed a weak 527 interaction effect between these attributes in both the RESTART-DCM Program and the 528 Lidcombe Program. These attributes, however, were only taken into consideration by about 529 a fifth of the SLPs (22.2%). This difference in reasoning may be explained by the different 530 decision-making systems SLPs use depending on the amount of experience they have [57]. It 531 is also possible that the arbitrary cut-off of five years of experience was not accurate to see 532 the difference between experienced and less experienced SLPs. But then, also the number of 533 children treated per week have an impact on the level of experience built in the treatment 534 of PCWS. 535 536 Even though this study is the first to list possible child, family and evidence attributes 537 that may have an impact on the clinical decision of which a treatment approach is chosen to 538 deliver to a PCWS and his family, it has important limitations. The main limitation was that 539 many SLPs did not respond the entire questionnaire. Probably, the questionnaire was too 540\nelaborate. Also, this study only provided a global insight in a complex matter. Qualitative 541 interviews could give more information about the clinical reasoning of the SLPs. Also, half of 542 the SLPs reported that they deliver the treatment approaches the same way as they are 543 described in the manuals (n = 18, 50%). The other half did not, with the most frequently 544 reported reason that they choose components of the treatment approaches to tailor the 545 individual needs of the PCWS. The non-adherence to the treatment manuals of SLPs was 546 accepted as this study focused on which treatment approach SLPs choose for a certain PCWS 547 and his family and not on treatment fidelity. In future studies, it could be an inclusion 548 criterion to rule out SLPs who select certain components or combine treatment approaches 549 while claiming to deliver a specific treatment approach. 550 This study should be replicated in other countries to compare whether the same 551 child, family and evidence attributes are taken into consideration by SLPs when choosing 552 how to treat the PCWS because it is possible that the reasoning processes are influenced by 553 local current practice. Knowing which attributes are more frequently taken into account, it is 554 necessary to establish its impact on treatment outcome for the different treatment 555 approaches in prospective, clinical trials. Knowing what suits a specific PCWS or family best 556 may significantly improve clinical service delivery. 557 558 Conclusions 559 The main attributes that SLP take into consideration when deciding the treatment 560 approach for a PCWS are (1) the child\u2019s dealing with the stuttering (being frustrated by the 561 stuttering, being sensitive to reactions of others towards the stuttering and being aware of 562 the stuttering), (2) the child\u2019s language (and speech) skills, (3) the child\u2019s age, (4) the family\u2019s 563 lifestyle, (5) the parent\u2019s intellectual capabilities and (6) the available evidence. Experienced 564\nSLPs more frequently take stuttering severity and time since onset into account when 565 deciding the treatment approach. Besides these two attributes, no significant difference was 566 found for the level of experience or for having to follow recommendations of a stuttering 567 guideline. It is now necessary to evaluate in future research whether these child, family and 568 evidence attributes indicate which treatment approaches suit certain PCWS and families 569 better and are more effective, or whether treatment approaches can sufficiently be 570 individualized to tailor specific needs of a PCWS and his family. 571 572 573 Statements 574 Acknowledgement 575 We would like to thank NVLF and NVST for distributing the questionnaire to the 576 participants. 577 578 Statement of ethics 579 This study was approved by the Scientific Advisory Board of Thomas More University 580 of Applied Sciences (Department of Speech-Language Pathology). 581 582 Conflict of Interest statement 583 The authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that they have no 584 affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or 585 non-financial interests in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript. 586 587 Funding sources 588\nThe authors did not receive funding for this project. 589 590 Author contributions 591 All authors contributed to the design, interpretation of data for the work, revising it critically 592 for important intellectual content, final approval of the version to be published.
