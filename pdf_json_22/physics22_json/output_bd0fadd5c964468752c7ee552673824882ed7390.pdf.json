What remains challenging to understand, o we ver, are the physical processes that trigger accretion events on o supermassive black holes and therefore drive the observed black ole growth as a function of redshift. The dif ferent supermassi ve lack hole fueling mechanisms proposed in the literature can broadly e grouped into external ( ex situ ) and internal ( in situ ) in nature. he latter are related to the secular evolution of galaxies, e.g. disc nstabilities (e.g. Hopkins & Hernquist 2006 ; Gatti et al. 2016 ), he creation of bars (Cisternas et al. 2015 ), stellar winds (Ciotti & striker 2007 ; Kauffmann & Heckman 2009 ) or the biased collapse f the baryons in the inner region of the halo (e.g. Lapi et al. 2011 , 018 ), and could lead to gas inflows towards the central regions of he galaxy and feeding of the central black hole. Ex situ processes re those that act on a galaxy from its environment. They include or example, galaxy interactions (Di Matteo, Springel & Hernquist 005 ; Gatti et al. 2016 ), cold gas inflows (Bournaud et al. 2012 ; eGraf et al. 2017 ), or cooling flows in massiv e clusters (e.g. F abian\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative h permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\n1 h p g\nm h o t c e i i c p m d t t K M o t a a c S s H t d t o 2 t t ( fi p v t X\ng h w t f z e e w ( g t i 2 u t a\no\na t c o h a o e c m r a t d s i o w t\n2\nT X 2 ( m a c l i a b\no T r M a t s ( w n a b l t M s a m b t c l s r\n1 The virial radius of a cluster is defined to be the distance from the cluster center where the local density is 200 times the mean density of the Universe.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n994 ). The balance between ex situ and in situ supermassive black ole fuelling processes likely depends, among others, on redshift, osition or the cosmic web and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as as content and structural parameters.\nOne approach for exploring the relative importance of the diverse echanisms abo v e in modulating the growth of supermassive black\noles is to study the incidence of AGNs in galaxies as a function f e.g. their morphology, star formation rate (SFR) or position on he cosmic web (Brandt & Alexander 2015 ). Such investigations an shed light on the conditions that promote or suppress accretion vents on to the supermassive black holes of galaxies and make nferences on the physics at play. Environmental studies in particular, .e. how AGNs populate galaxy groups, filaments, clusters, and field, ould provide information on the balance between in situ and ex situ rocess for acti v ating supermassi v e black holes. This potential hav e oti v ated observ ational studies to characterize AGNs populations in ifferent environments. At low redshift ( z \u2248 0.1) there is evidence hat the fraction of AGNs in high density regions is lower compared o the field (e.g. Kauffmann et al. 2004 ; Popesso & Biviano 2006 ; oulouridis & Plionis 2010 ; Lopes, Ribeiro & Rembold 2017 ; ishra & Dai 2020 ). This may indicate the decreasing incidence f mergers in massive clusters (Popesso & Biviano 2006 ) and/or he impact of processes that strip the gas reservoirs of galaxies nd hence, lead to the suppression of their nuclear activity. There re also claims that the AGN radial distribution is skewed to the luster outskirts relative to the general galaxy population (e.g. de ouza et al. 2016 ; Lopes et al. 2017 ). This finding coupled with uggestions that cluster AGN show high velocity dispersion (e.g. aines et al. 2012 ; Pimbblet et al. 2013 ; Lopes et al. 2017 ) points o a link between accretion events and galaxies that fall on to high ensity regions from larger scales. Contrary to the findings above here are also observational studies that claim little or no dependence f the AGN fraction on environment at low redshift (e.g. Miller et al. 003 ; Haggard et al. 2010 ; Pimbblet et al. 2013 ). At least part of he discrepancy is likely related to selection effects. These include he accretion luminosity threshold adopted in the various studies Kauffmann et al. 2004 ; Pimbblet et al. 2013 ), differences between eld and cluster environments in the properties of the o v erall galaxy opulation (e.g. SFR, morphology) used to determine fractions (e.g. on der Linden et al. 2010 ; Lopes et al. 2017 ; Man et al. 2019 ) or he methods adopted for selecting AGNs (e.g. optical emission lines, -ray emission, and mid-infrared colours). Outside the local Universe ( z 0 . 1) there is evidence that the roup/cluster environments become more active in terms of black ole growth. The fraction of AGN in such dense regions increases ith increasing redshift (Martini, Si v akof f & Mulchaey 2009 ; Marini et al. 2013 ; Bufanda et al. 2017 ) at a rate that appears to be aster than the field AGN evolution (Eastman et al. 2007 ). At redshift 1 the fraction of AGN in clusters is at least as high as the field xpectation (Martini et al. 2013 ; Alberts et al. 2016 ) suggesting fficient triggering of accretion events. This is possibly associated ith the higher incidence of interactions in these environments e.g. Alberts et al. 2016 ) and/or the larger cold gas content of alaxies at earlier times (e.g. Tacconi et al. 2010 ) combined with he impact of the ram pressure experienced by galaxies as they fall nto the cluster potential well (Poggianti et al. 2017 ; Ricarte et al. 020 ). The evidence abo v e emphasizes the role of environment for nderstanding AGN triggering mechanisms and underlines the need o better constrain the redshift at which the cluster AGN fractions re on par with the field or even exceed it (Alberts et al. 2016 ).\nIn this work, we revisit the incidence of AGNs in massive clusters f galaxies out to z \u2248 1.25 by developing a semi-empirical modelling\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\npproach to interpret observational results from the literature (Marini et al. 2009 , 2013 ). The feature of our modelling methodology is ontrol o v er systematics and observ ational selection ef fects. We use bserv ationally moti v ated relations to populate massive dark matter aloes extracted from N -body cosmological simulations with AGNs nd galaxies. These are then used to mimic observations of clusters f galaxies by including in a realistic manner the rele v ant selection ffects, such as cluster membership definition, flux, or luminosity uts, etc. These mocks are then compared with real observations to ake inferences on the evolution of the AGN fraction in clusters elative to the field expectation. Section 2 presents the observations nd selection bias that we attempt to reproduce. Section 3 describes he generation of the mock catalogues and the implementation of the ifferent selection effects into the simulations. The comparison of the emi-empirical model predictions with the observations is presented n Section 4 . Finally, Section 5 discusses the results in the context f AGN triggering mechanisms. We adopt a flat CDM cosmology ith parameters m = 0.307, = 0.693, h = 0.678 consistent with he Planck results (Planck Collaboration XIII 2016 ).\nOBSERVATI ONS\nhis work uses the observational measurements of the fraction of -ray AGN in galaxy clusters presented by Martini et al. ( 2009 , 013 ). Typical halo masses of these clusters are few times 10 14 M see Section 3.4.1 for more details). In this section, we describe the ost salient details of these observations and the corresponding data nalysis. Of particular interest to our work are the (i) the definition of luster membership in the observations and (ii) the magnitude/flux imits that are used to define the galaxy and AGN samples. The nferred AGN fractions strongly depend on these selection effects nd it is therefore important to reproduce them in the simulations efore comparing with the observations. Martini et al. ( 2009 ) used a sample of 32 massive galaxy clusters ut to redshift z = 1.3 with available Chandra X-ray observations. heir low redshift sub-sample consists of 17 clusters at z < 0.4 (mean edshift z\u0304 = 0 . 19). These 17 clusters include the 10 presented in artini et al. ( 2006 ) and 7 additional ones selected from the Chandra rchive to be the nearest most massive clusters with virial radius hat fits within the Chandra field of view (FOV). The high redshift ub-sample numbers 15 clusters in the redshift interval z = 0.4\u20131.3 average redshift \u0304z = 0 . 72). Cluster member candidates are selected ithin the projected R 200 1 radius of each cluster in the sample. The umber of AGN and galaxy cluster members is determined to the pparent R -band magnitude limit m \u2217R ( z) + 1, where m \u2217R ( z) is the reak of the R -band luminosity function at the cluster redshift. The atter is estimated assuming that the absolute magnitude break of he luminosity function evolves as M \u2217R ( z) = M \u2217R ( z = 0) \u2212 z with\n\u2217 R ( z = 0) from Christlein & Zabludoff ( 2003 ) and early-type galaxy pectral energy distribution for the K -correction. For clusters with high redshift identification completeness the number of galaxy embers is estimated by counting sources with R -band magnitude righter than m \u2217R ( z) + 1 and redshift difference ( z) relative to he mean cluster redshift ( z), z \u00b7 c < 3 \u03c3v (1 + z), where \u03c3 v is the luster velocity dispersion and c the speed of light. For clusters with imited spectroscopic redshift follow-ups (mostly high-redshift subample) the number of galaxy members is estimated using the cluster ichness versus velocity dispersion relation of Becker et al. ( 2007 ).\nT g a a r g a ( r b r C f\nm C i m t m b M a s t r r o t c h X s l\n3\nT t w s G f u r h b o g t o m T\n3 t\nI U g t\nA i t o a s o a r o ( s 2 i a m f W s a s t g B\n( ( c h o ( a T s t e c ( t T m i p a\nd o t t d l p p U S c h s e\n2 https:// www.peterbehroozi.com/ data.html\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nhis empirical relation is calibrated to yield the number of early-type alaxy cluster members that are more luminous than 0.4 L \u2217 (i.e. equivlent to m \u2217R ( z) + 1) within the R 200 radius. AGN cluster members are lso selected to have apparent magnitude brighter than m \u2217R ( z) + 1 and edshifts that are consistent with z \u00b7 c < 3 \u03c3v (1 + z), i.e. similar to alaxies. The observed number of X-ray AGN cluster members is lso corrected for the spectroscopic completeness of each cluster typically > 60 per cent for AGNs). The depth of the Chandra Xay observations means that AGN samples are complete to hardand luminosities L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 . Less luminous Xay sources suffer incompleteness because of the sensitivity of the handra observations and are not used for the estimation of AGN ractions. The Martini et al. ( 2013 ) cluster sample is composed of 13 of the ost statistically significant extended X-ray sources detected in the handr a surv e y of the Bootes field with spectroscopic identifications n the redshift interval z = 1\u20131.5 (Eisenhardt et al. 2008 ). Cluster ember candidates, AGN or galaxies, are selected to lie within he projected R 200 radius and have Spitzer 3 . 6 \u03bcm-band apparent agnitude brighter than m \u22173 . 6 ( z) + 1. The quantity m \u22173 . 6 ( z) is the reak of the 3 . 6 \u03bcm luminosity function at redshift z adopted from ancone et al. ( 2010 ). Both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts re used to determine cluster membership. Sources with spectrocopic redshift within z \u00b7 c < \u00b12 000(1 + z) km s \u22121 (i.e. similar o Martini et al. 2009 fixing 3 \u03c3v = 2 000 km s \u22121 ) off the cluster edshift are assumed to be members. In the case of photometric edshift estimates this condition is modified so that at least 30 per cent f the photometric redshift probability density function is required o lie within the abo v e redshift interval. All X-ray selected AGN luster member candidates in the sample of Martini et al. ( 2013 ) ave spectroscopic redshifts. The AGN sample is complete to the -ray luminosity L X (2 \u201310 keV) = 10 44 erg s \u22121 . For less luminous ystems, L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 , Martini et al. ( 2013 ) provide ower limits for the AGN cluster fraction.\nM E T H O D O L O G Y\nhis section describes our approach for generating mock observaions of galaxies and AGNs in massive structures of the cosmic eb. The starting point of our method is cosmological N -body imulation (e.g. Lemson & Virgo Consortium 2006 ; Klypin, Trujilloomez & Primack 2011 ; Klypin et al. 2016 ) that describe the ormation and evolution of dark matter haloes in the Universe nder the influence of gravity. These are coupled with empirical elations that associate dark matter haloes with galaxies (galaxy\u2013 alo connection). Accretion events associated with supermassive lack holes are then painted on top of those galaxies using recent bservational results on the incidence of AGN in galaxies (AGN\u2013 alaxy connection). The implicit assumption of this latter step is that he probability of galaxies hosting an accretion event does not depend n environment, i.e. halo mass. Light-cones are then generated to imic real observations of AGNs and galaxies on the cosmic web. hese steps abo v e are described in detail in the following sections.\n.1 Galaxy\u2013halo connection: (Sub-)halo abundance matching echniques\nt is well established that the main sites of galaxy formation in the niverse are haloes of dark matter. These provide the necessary ravitational potential for the various baryonic physical processes o act and form the luminous structures (i.e. galaxies) we observe.\nmong the different methods proposed in the literature for associatng galaxies (i.e. luminous baryonic matter) with dark matter haloes, he semi-empirical approach of abundance matching offers a number f advantages. With relatively small number of parameters, this pproach can successfully reproduce observed properties of galaxies uch as their stellar masses or SFRs. In the basic implementation f abundance matching it is assumed that most massive haloes are ssociated with the most massive galaxies. This approach yields a elation between dark matter mass and stellar mass as a function f redshift that is in reasonable agreement with observational results e.g. occupation number, two-point correlation function or cross bias, ee Kravtsov et al. 2004 ; Tasitsiomi et al. 2004 ; Vale & Ostriker 004 ). Recent implementations of abundance matching techniques nclude an increasing level of complexity in the way haloes are ssociated with baryonic mass and galaxies. F or e xample, the halo ass versus stellar mass relation is parametrized by analytical unctions allowing for intrinsic scatter (e.g. Behroozi, Conroy & echsler 2010 ; Moster et al. 2010 ), baryonic process such as tar formation in galaxies are modelled using information on the ccretion/merger history of haloes, diverse observational results (e.g. tellar mass functions and galaxy clustering properties) are used o tune the various model parameters and produce realistic mock alaxy catalogues out to high redshift (Moster, Naab & White 2018 ; ehroozi et al. 2019 ). In this work, we use the UNIVERSEMACHINE data release 1 2 Behroozi et al. 2019 ) implemented for the MultiDark PLanck2 MDPL2; Klypin et al. 2016 ) dark matter N -body simulation. We hoose to use the MDPL2 because it is one of the largest volume, igh resolution and public cosmological simulations. It has a box size f 1 000 Mpc h \u22121 , a mass resolution of 1 . 5 \u00d7 10 9 M h \u22121 and 3 840 3 \u223c57 \u00d7 10 9 ) particles. Individual dark matter haloes in the MDPL2 re identified using ROCKSTAR (Behroozi, Wechsler & Wu 2013a ). his is a state-of-the-art halo finder that uses both the 6D phasepace distribution of dark matter particles and temporal information o identify bound structures, i.e. dark matter haloes. ROCKSTAR is fficient in detecting and measuring the properties of both the largest ollapsed structures (parent haloes) and sub-structures within them satellites haloes). The evolution of haloes through cosmic time is racked in the form of merger trees computed by the code CONSISTENT REES (Behroozi et al. 2013b ). In this work, we consider only dark atter haloes with at least 100 times the MDPL2 mass resolution, .e. M peak > 1 . 5 \u00d7 10 11 M h \u22121 . This limit ensures that the inferred roperties of dark matter haloes, such as their position and total mass re not affected by the finite resolution of the simulations.\nUNIVERSEMACHINE assigns stellar masses (and hence galaxies) to ark matter haloes by parametrizing the star formation history (SFH) f individual haloes. The SFR in a halo is assumed to be a function of he depth of the halo\u2019s potential well, its assembly history and cosmic ime. The maximum circular velocity, v max , is used as a proxy of the epth of the potential well. The v max , corresponds to the circular veocity of the halo when it reaches its historical maximum mass ( M peak arameter in the MDPL2 catalogues). The halo assembly history is arametrized by the v max variations ( v max ) across cosmic time. NIVERSEMACHINE therefore assumes a parametric analytic function FR( v max , v max , z) to determine the SFR for each halo across osmic time. Integrating the SFR along the assembly and merger istory of a galaxy it is then possible to determine the corresponding tellar mass. The parameter space of SFR( v max , v max , z) function is xplored in an iterative manner by estimating at each step observables\nMNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nM\n( m g g w ( y\nm a o t s U g p o o F N\n3 d\nT a o o \u03bb A m e u t\n\u03bb\nT s 2 2 1 r n e n U\ne f 2 v a a s w \u03bb t h e u d\nFigure 1.

These are estimated by adding systematic errors (also free arameters in UNIVERSEMACHINE ) to the \u2018true\u2019 values to account for bserv ational ef fects (e.g. Eddington bias). We note, ho we ver, that ur final results and conclusions are not sensitive to this choice. or dark matter haloes, we use virial values as defined by Bryan & orman ( 1998 ) for mass and radius.\n.2 AGN\u2013galaxy connection: specific accretion rate istributions\nhe assignment of AGNs to the UNIVERSEMACHINE galaxies is lso based on empirical relations that associate the probability f a supermassive black hole accretion event to the properties f its host. The rele v ant observ able is the specific accretion rate, sBHAR \u221d L X ( 2 \u201310 keV ) /M . In this definition L X (2 \u201310 keV) is the GN X-ray luminosity in the 2\u201310 keV band and M is the stellar ass of the parent galaxy. The specific accretion rate provides an stimate of how much X-ray luminosity is emitted by the AGN per nit stellar mass of the host galaxy. In this work, we choose to scale he ratio L X ( 2 \u201310 keV ) /M as\nsBHAR = k bol 1 . 26 \u00d7 10 38 \u00d7 0 . 002 \u00b7\n( L X (2 \u201310 keV )\nerg s \u22121\n) \u00b7 (\nM M\n) . (1)\nhe abo v e equation assumes a Margorrian-type relation between tellar and black hole mass M BH = 0 . 002 \u00d7 M (Marconi & Hunt 003 ), an AGN bolometric correction k bol = L bol / L X (2 \u201310 keV ) = 5 (Elvis et al. 1994 ) and the Eddington luminosity of the black hole . 26 \u00d7 10 38 erg s \u22121 . The scaling factors in equation ( 1 ) make \u03bbsBHAR esemble an Eddington ratio, i.e. the AGN bolometric luminosity ormalized to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole. It is mphasized that the multiplicative constants in equation ( 1 ) do ot affect our analysis and the assignment of AGN luminosities to NIVERSEMACHINE galaxies. Large multiwavelength observational programs have enabled the stimation of stellar masses, X-ray luminosities and hence \u03bbsBHAR or large samples of AGN (Aird et al. 2012 ; Bongiorno et al. 012 ; Schulze et al. 2015 ; Georgakakis et al. 2017 ). These obserations made possible the determination of the fraction of galaxies t fixed stellar mass that host an accretion event with specific ccretion rate \u03bbsBHAR . These fractions can then be turned into pecific accretion rate probability distribution functions, P ( \u03bbsBHAR ), hich describe the probability of an accretion event with parameter sBHAR in a galaxy. Recent observational studies have measured he specific accretion rate distribution as a function of redshift and ost galaxy properties such as stellar mass and SFR (Georgakakis t al. 2017 ; Aird, Coil & Georgakakis 2018 ). In this work, we se these two independent estimates of the specific accretion rate istribution.\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nGeorgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) combined a number of extragalactic -ray surv e y fields with multiwav elength data to construct a nonarametric model of the specific accretion rate distribution. Their ethodology required that the convolution of the P ( \u03bbsBHAR ) with the alaxy stellar mass function yields the observed number of X-ray GN in bins of luminosity, redshift, and stellar mass. Aird et al. 2018 ) started with a sample of near-infrared selected galaxies for hich stellar masses and SFRs were estimated. X-ray observations ere then used to extract the X-ray photons at the positions of ndividual galaxies. These were then fed into a flexible Bayesian ixture model to determine in a non-parametric manner the coresponding specific accretion rate distribution of star-forming and uiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift. Despite ifferences in the methodology the Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) and Aird t al. ( 2018 ) constraints on the specific accretion rate distribution are n good agreement (see Georgakakis et al. 2017 ). Both Georgakakis t al. ( 2017 ) and Aird et al. ( 2018 ) measured P( \u03bbsBHAR ) as a function f redshift out to z \u2248 3. Fig. 1 graphically shows examples of the pecific accretion rate distributions used in our analysis.\nUsing these distributions we associate AGN X-ray luminosities to alaxies in the UNIVERSEMACHINE catalogues. This process is done in probabilistic approach. For each mock galaxy with stellar mass M nd redshift z the corresponding specific accretion rate distributions rom either Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) or Aird et al. ( 2018 ) are ampled to draw random \u03bbsBHAR . These are then used to assign Xay luminosities to individual galaxies by inverting equation ( 1 ). Aird t al. ( 2018 ) provide separate P ( \u03bbsBHAR ) for star-forming and passive alaxies. In this case, we split the UNIVERSEMACHINE galaxies into hese two classes using the relation of Aird et al. ( 2018 ) log SFR cut = \u22128 . 9 + 0 . 76 log (\nM M\n) + 2 . 95 ( 1 + z ) . (2)\nt fixed stellar mass and redshift galaxies with star formation rate bo v e and below SFR cut are considered star-forming and passive, espectively.\nFigure 2.

The top panels correspond to a 10 Mpc h \u22121 slice of a box from MDPL2 cosmological simulation with 1 000 Mpc h \u22121 side size at the snapshot z = 0.75. The dots represent the positions of dark matter haloes with masses M peak > 10 12 M h \u22121 (top left panel), galaxies within these dark matter haloes (top middle panel) and AGN within the same dark matter haloes (top right panel). Only AGN with L X (2 \u201310 keV ) > 10 42 erg s \u22121 using the specific accretion distribution described in Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ). The construction of AGN mocks proceeds from left to right in this figure. Dark matter haloes (black dots in the top left panel) are populated with galaxies (blue points in the top middle panel), using abundance matching ( UNIVERSEMACHINE; Behroozi et al. 2019 ). These galaxies are seeded with accretion e vents follo wing the observ ationally deri ved distributions of these e vents (e.g. Georgakakis et al. 2017 ; Aird et al. 2018 ). The key feature of this approach is the reproduction by construction of the predictions and observables shown in the lower set of panels.

( 2017 ) nd Aird et al. ( 2018 ) are dominated by low density regions of the osmic web. Groups and cluster of galaxies, although present in hese samples, are subdominant simply because of the form of the alo mass function and the rele v antly small FOV of most of the urv e y fields used. The derived specific accretion rate distributions re therefore representative of the field galaxy population, i.e. those utside massive groups or clusters of galaxies. For this reason in hat follows we refer to the predictions of the model as \u2018field xpectation\u2019. The adopted specific accretion rate distributions are gnostic to the parent halo mass of individual galaxies, hence the ero-order assumption of the model that the incidence of AGNs in alaxies is independent of environment.\nThe final products of the AGN seeding process are MDPL2 osmological boxes at fixed redshift with galaxies (from UNIERSEMACHINE ) and AGNs (from random sampling of the \u03bbsBHAR istribution). Fig. 2 graphically demonstrates that our semi-empirical ethodology by construction reproduces the halo mass function of ark matter haloes, the stellar mass function of galaxies, and the AGN -ray luminosity function. It is also demonstrated that this approach roduces AGN mocks with the large-scale clustering ( 1 Mpc) onsistent with observations (Georgakakis et al. 2019 ; Aird & Coil 021 ). Moreo v er , the A GN duty cycle, defined as the probability f galaxies abo v e a given stellar mass hosting an AGN above a\niven accretion luminosity, are inherent in the derivation of specific ccretion rate distributions abo v e. As a result our AGNs and galaxy ocks are consistent with independently derived determinations of he AGN duty cycles (e.g. Goulding et al. 2014 ). Put differently, the tellar mass function of the mock AGN host galaxies at fixed Xay luminosity threshold is consistent with observational constraints Georgakakis et al. 2011 , 2017 ).\nIt is noted that the abo v e methodology for seeding galaxies and aloes with AGN is similar to that proposed by Shankar et al. ( 2020 ) nd Alle v ato et al. ( 2021 ) for generating mock AGN samples based n the semi-empirical approach. In these studies, satellites and central alaxies/AGNs can be treated separately by changing their relative uty cycles. In our approach there is no distinction between the two, .e. it is assumed that both central and satellites are described by the ame duty cycle.\n.3 Light-cones\nhe comparison of the predictions from the simulations with the bservations is following the principles of forward modelling. For hat the UNIVERSEMACHINE boxes need to be first projected on to he sky plane to mimic real observations. We assume a box with a YZ Cartesian coordinate system. This is offset along the Z -axis by he co-moving distance D c ( z) at redshift z. The observer is placed\nMNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nM\na t T u d a l g a\nt 1 p s a a S f 0 a d A\n3\nT m M T g t t B\n3\nW t t U i e p a v t l r s a h i f f w m c\ni\n3\n1 e f i e t t r c s i\n3\nA a m p m o e a W c\nc C d o 0 d d e c ( i T d d\n3\nI a f m c s b t m s a s a P\nt\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nt Z = 0 Mpc h \u22121 and on the XY -plane. The line-of-sight angle of he observer relative to every galaxy in the box is then estimated. his angle can be split into a right ascension and declination on the nit sphere. The redshift of each object corresponds to its co-moving istance from the observer. The finite FOV of real observations can lso be imposed by defining a sightline from the observer to a given ight-cone direction, estimating the angular distances of all mock alaxies relative to this direction and then rejecting the ones with ngular distances larger than the adopted FOV.\nFor the analysis presented in this paper we construct light-cones in he vicinity of clusters. We consider three redshifts z = 0.2, 0.75, and .25, which correspond to the mean redshifts of the cluster samples resented by Martini et al. ( 2009 ) and Martini et al. ( 2013 ). We elect UNIVERSEMACHINE boxes with scale factor 3 0.4505, 0.5747, nd 0.8376 that approximately correspond to each of the redshifts bo v e. F or a given box a massive dark matter halo is selected (see ection 3.4 for details) and is placed at a co-moving distance D c ( z c ) rom the observer, where z c is the box redshift, i.e. one of 0.2, .75, and 1.25. The light-cone to the cluster is then constructed with n opening angle that is defined by the user (see next section for etails). The end product are dark matter haloes, mock galaxies and GN projected on the sky that mimic real observations.\n.4 Selection effects\nhis section describes how observational selection effects are impleented into our simulations to allow comparison with the results of artini et al. ( 2009 , 2013 ) on the fraction of AGN in galaxy clusters.\nhe characteristics of the observations we attempt to mimic can be rouped into three broad categories that relate to the richness/mass of he cluster sample, the galaxy/AGN cluster membership criteria and he apparent brightness or stellar mass of the galaxy/AGN sample. elow we discuss each of them in detail.\n.4.1 Cluster sample\ne define the cluster sample by adopting a minimum virial mass hreshold. Martini et al. ( 2009 ) provide velocity dispersion for heir cluster sample as a measure of their masses. Ho we ver, the NIVERSEMACHINE data set does not include velocity dispersion nformation and therefore a mapping is required between this paramter and halo mass. For the latter, we adopt the analytical relations resented by Munari et al. ( 2013 ) based on N -body simulations. This llows us to associate individual UNIVERSEMACHINE haloes with a elocity dispersion and then threshold on this quantity to mimic he Martini et al. ( 2009 ) cluster sample selection. We choose the ower halo mass limit in such a way that our parent cluster sample eproduces the median velocity dispersion of the Martini et al. ( 2009 ) ample. The adopted virial halo mass limits are 5.7 \u00d7 10 14 M h \u22121 nd 3.6 \u00d7 10 14 M h \u22121 for z = 0.2 and 0.75, respectiv ely. F or the igh-redshift clusters of Martini et al. ( 2013 ) there is only scattered nformation on their halo masses. Literature results suggest masses of ew times 10 14 M , based on dynamical measurements or estimates rom X-ray luminosities. For our high-redshift simulations ( z = 1.25) e therefore select haloes with virial mass > 3 \u00d7 10 14 M h \u22121 to imic the cluster sample of Martini et al. ( 2013 ). Our results and onclusions are not sensitive to this threshold. At the mass limits abo v e there are 388, 157, and 18 parent haloes n the MDLP2/ UNIVERSEMACHINE boxes at redshifts 0.2, 0.75, and\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nDefined as a = 1/(1 + z).\nk f f\n.25, respectiv ely. These numbers e xclude haloes close to the box dges, whose volume as defined in observations (see text below or more details), intersects the box boundaries. The rapid decrease n the number of clusters in each sample is because of the strong volution of the halo mass function with redshift. These clusters are hen projected on to the sky as described in Section 3.3 . We choose o place the observer at the same ( X , Y ) position as the cluster with espect to the reference system of the box. This results in light-cones entred on the each of the selected massive haloes, with a line-ofight perpendicular to the ( X , Y )-plane of the box. We define the FOV n terms of the virial radius of the cluster.\n.4.2 Cluster membership\nlthough in the simulation box the satellite galaxies associated with given parent halo are known, we prefer to follow an observationaloti v ated approach for defining cluster membership based on the rojected and radial distances relative to the cluster centre. Cluster ember candidates are selected to lie within the projected R vir radius f the corresponding halo. This is similar to the selection of Martini t al. ( 2009 , 2013 ). We choose to use R vir instead of R 200 since they re similar, but the last is not present in UNIVERSEMACHINE data set. e checked that this assumption does not affect our final results and onclusions. The radial distance of clusters member candidates relative to the luster centre is measured in redshift space as in real observations. luster members are those mock galaxies or AGNs with redshift ifference to the cluster z \u00b7 c \u2264 3 \u03c3 v (1 + z), where z is the redshift f the cluster (fixed to be one of the redshifts of interest, i.e. z = 0.2, .75, or 1.25), c represents the speed of light and \u03c3 v is the velocity ispersion of the cluster determined using Munari et al. ( 2013 ). This efinition corresponds to the selection criteria adopted by Martini t al. ( 2009 ) for defining cluster members and it is used for the lusters at redshifts z = 0.2 and 0.75. In the case of Martini et al. 2013 ) 3 \u03c3 v is fixed to 2000 km s \u22121 for all the clusters. This restriction s also adopted in our simulation for the clusters at redshift z = 1.25. his condition defines the volume of the cluster in terms of its velocity ispersion. Fig. 3 shows an example of a simulated observation and emonstrates the impact of selection effects.\n.4.3 Galaxy/AGN sample selection\nn observations AGNs and/or galaxy samples are typically selected bo v e a given apparent magnitude limit. In Martini et al. ( 2009 , 2013 ) or example, this is set relative to the knee of the optical and/or id-infrared luminosity function of galaxies at the corresponding luster redshift (see Section 2 ). In simulations, ho we ver, like the emi-empirical model described in this work, galaxies are defined y their intrinsic properties, such as stellar mass, SFR, and accreion luminosity. Associating these physical properties to apparent agnitudes requires assumptions on e.g. the SFH of galaxies, the pectral energy distribution (SED) of stellar populations or the shape nd normalization of the dust attenuation curve. Assigning SEDs to imulated galaxies is therefore far from trivial and inevitably requires dditional modelling steps (e.g. Georgakakis, Ruiz & LaMassa 2020 ; earl et al. 2021 ) Our baseline model/observation comparison a v oids these addiional steps. Instead we make the simplifying assumption that the nee of the observed galaxy optical or mid-infrared luminosity unction traces the knee of the underlying galaxy stellar mass unction, M \u2217 . This allows us to translate the R band and 3 . 6 \u03bcm\nFigure 3. The light-cone of a massive cluster in UNIVERSEMACHINE at redshift z = 1.25 and halo mass M vir = 10 14.51 M h \u22121.

( 2009 , 013 , see Section 2 ) to stellar mass cuts. Mock galaxies are selected o be more massive than log M \u2217 /M \u2212 0 . 4 dex. The break of the ass function is fixed to log M \u2217 = 10 10 . 7 M independent of redshift ased on the parametrization of Ilbert et al. ( 2013 ). Although the lbert et al. ( 2013 ) study refers to field galaxies, observations show hat the shape of stellar mass function is similar in massive clusters e.g. Vulcani et al. 2013 ; Nantais et al. 2016 ). The translation of he 0 . 4 L \u2217 apparent magnitude limit to a log M \u2217 /M \u2212 0 . 4 dex hreshold implies the same average mass-to-light ratio for galaxies. his approximation is justifiable in the case of the high redshift luster sample ( z \u2248 1.25) of Martini et al. ( 2013 ), where galaxies re selected in the I RAC 3 . 6 \u03bcm band. At the mean cluster redshift, his wavelength roughly corresponds to rest-fame near-infrared ( \u2248 .6 \u03bcm), where the mass-to-light ratio is not a strong function of the alaxy stellar population. We acknowledge that in the low-redshift z = 0.2 and 0.75) cluster sample of Martini et al. ( 2009 ), galaxies are elected in the R band, where variations of the mass-to-light ratio as a unction of the star-formation rate are important. For this sample the pproximation of a constant mass-to-light ratio is rough and should e taken with caution. We further address the limitations abo v e by assigning apparent agnitudes to mock galaxies in the light-cones following the methodlogy described in Georgakakis et al. ( 2020 ). UNIVERSEMACHINE alaxies are assumed to be described by exponentially declining FH. The parameters of the SFH model are constrained to reproduce he UNIVERSEMACHINE stellar masses and instantaneous SFRs of the alaxies at their assigned redshifts in the light-cone. The Bruzual & harlot ( 2003 ) stellar library and the Chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass unction are used to synthesize stellar populations for the adopted FH. The SEDs of star-forming galaxies are extincted by dust ssuming the Calzetti et al. ( 2000 ) law and E ( B \u2212 V ) = 0.4 ag. The magnitudes of passive galaxies are not extincted by dust. his empirical model is shown to reproduce reasonably well the\nistribution of apparent magnitudes of galaxies in the COSMOS eld (Muzzin et al. 2013 ). The assigned apparent magnitudes are sensitive to the instantaeous SFR of mock galaxies. The empirical model of Georgakakis t al. ( 2020 ) assumes that star-forming galaxies are on the main equence of star formation (Schreiber et al. 2015 ), while quiescent alaxies lie 1 \u2212 1.5 dex below it depending on redshift. This offset or the quenched galaxies is empirically determined to reproduce the bserved magnitude distribution of passive galaxies as a function of edshift in the COSMOS field. The UNIVERSEMACHINE star-forming alaxies are also constrained to follow the main sequence of star ormation at different redshifts and are therefore consistent with he assumptions of the empirical SED model of Georgakakis et al. 2020 ). In contrast, the SFR distribution of quenched galaxies is ot as well constrained by observations (see discussion by Pearl t al. 2021 ). P assiv e galaxies in UNIVERSEMACHINE are assigned pecific star formation rates (sSFR) that are drawn from a nonvolving lognormal distribution with mean log sSFR / yr = \u221211 . 8 nd scatter 0.36 dex, moti v ated by observ ations in the local Universe Behroozi et al. 2015 ). This SFR is 2 dex below the main sequence f star-formation at low redshift and therefore inconsistent with he assumptions of the empirical SED model of Georgakakis et al. 2020 ). This difference in sSFR results in passive galaxies with too aint apparent magnitudes for the empirical model of Georgakakis t al. ( 2020 ). In this work, we therefore adopt the definition of uenched galaxies given by equation ( 2 ) but then re-scale the orresponding sSFR according to the Georgakakis et al. ( 2020 ) rescriptions (i.e. 1\u20131.5 dex below the main should that be M \u2217R ( z = 0) equence) before assigning them magnitudes. Once apparent magnitudes are assigned to mock galaxies in he light-cone, we apply cuts similar to those adopted by Martini t al. ( 2009 , 2013 ), i.e. one magnitude fainter than the break of he luminosity function in the R (low- and medium-redshift cluster amples, z = 0.2 and 0.75) and 3.6 \u03bcm (high-redshift cluster amples; z = 1.25) bands. The magnitude limits for the different amples are summarized in Table 1 . For the R band in particular, ollowing Martini et al. ( 2009 ) we assume that the knee of the uminosity function evolves with redshift as M R ( z) = M R ( z = 0) z with M \u2217R ( z = 0) = \u221221 . 92 (Christlein & Zabludoff 2003 ). This bsolute magnitude is converted to apparent magnitude in the R and assuming an elliptical galaxy SED (Ilbert et al. 2009 ) for he K corrections. The estimated knee of the luminosity function n apparent magnitudes is m \u2217R = 17 . 1, 22.3 mag at z = 0.2 and .75, respectively.

For the 3.6 \u03bcm band the knee of the uminosity function is assumed to 17.5 mag (apparent magnitude) t z = 1.25 (Mancone et al. 2010 ). Mock galaxies and AGNs in the imulated light-cones are selected to be brighter than the magnitudes imits listed in Table 1 . For the mock AGNs, we further apply the -ray luminosity limits of Martini et al. ( 2009 , 2013 ) to define two amples with L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 and > 10 44 erg s \u22121 . In the analysis abo v e we ignore the contribution of AGN light to the bserved magnitude of galaxies. Modelling this component requires nowledge of the obscuration properties of the AGNs. This latter arameter has the strongest impact on the observed spectral energy istribution of these sources. The specific accretion rate distribution sed in this work to seed galaxies with AGN luminosities do not ccount for the AGN obscuration and therefore cannot be used to odel this effect (see also Georgakakis et al. 2020 ). We simplify this roblem by ignoring the AGN contribution to the emission of the alaxy in the optical/mid-infrared. This simplification is equi v alent to he assumption that mock AGNs are completely obscured and hence ubdominant relative to the stellar emission of galaxies. We will iscuss the impact of this assumption on the results and conclusions n the next sections. RESU LTS .1 Impact of selection effects on the incidence of AGNs e first explore the sensitivity of the estimate AGN fractions to bserv ational selection ef fects. Fig. 4 plots the AGN duty cycle f our semi-empirical model as a function of host galaxy stellar ass limit. The former quantity is defined as the fraction of mock GNs abo v e a giv en X-ray luminosity threshold among galaxies ore massive than a given stellar mass limit ( x -axis of Fig. 4 ).\nn this e x ercise all galaxies in a giv en UNIVERSEMACHINE box are sed independent of halo mass. We iterate that the AGN fractions lotted in Fig. 4 are consistent with independent observations that se the stellar mass function of galaxies and AGN hosts to infer duty ycles (see Georgakakis et al. 2017 ). Fig. 4 shows that the AGN duty ycle is sensitive to both the X-ray and the host galaxy stellar mass hresholds. There is a general trend of increasing AGN fraction with ecreasing X-ray luminosity. This is because less luminous AGNs are ore common than high accretion luminosity events (i.e. the X-ray uminosity function). Also the AGN duty cycle at fixed luminosity\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nrops with decreasing stellar mass below about 10 11 M . This is ecause in our implementation lower stellar mass hosts require higher sBHAR to produce AGNs abo v e a giv en luminosity cut. Ho we ver, igher specific accretion rates are less likely. This is demonstrated y the form of the specific accretion rate distribution plotted in Fig. 1 , hich strongly decreases with increasing \u03bbsBHAR . For stellar masses 10 11 M the duty cycle curves of Fig. 4 either increase, decrease or emain nearly flat with increasing stellar mass. This is related to the tellar mass dependence of the specific accretion-rate distributions f Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) and Aird et al. ( 2018 ) used in our nalysis. It is also worth noting that the differences between the wo specific accretion rate distributions models abo v e are stronger or the lowest redshift panel ( z = 0.2). This is related to the small ample of low redshift AGN in the Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) and ird et al. ( 2018 ) studies. In any case, the important point of Fig. 4 is hat AGN fractions are sensitive to the choice of the stellar mass and -ray luminosity thresholds, i.e. the observational selections effects. his emphasises the importance of carefully treating this issue, as escribed in Sections 3.4.3 . For completeness we also show in Fig. 5 how the fraction of AGN aries with parent halo mass. UNIVERSEMACHINE galaxies (central r satellites) abo v e a giv en stellar mass threshold are grouped by arent halo mass. At a fixed halo mass the fraction of galaxies that ost AGNs abo v e a giv en accretion luminosity limit is estimated nd plotted. As expected the resulting curves are nearly flat with alo mass since the explicit assumption of the semi-empirical model onstruction is that the probability of a galaxy hosting an accretion vent is agnostic to halo mass. Nevertheless, the strong correlation etween halo and stellar mass as well as the X-ray luminosity cut mprint systematic trends on to the curves of Fig. 5 . These are anifested for example, by the increasing AGN fraction toward ower halo masses. This is more pronounced for the curves with high stellar mass cut, log M /M > 10.8. This is because this hreshold essentially remo v es a large number of lower mass galaxies, hich are typically found in low-mass haloes. Additionally the orm of the specific accretion rate distributions dictates that more assive galaxies are more likely to host AGN abo v e a fix ed accretion uminosity threshold. The net effect is the observed increase in the GN fraction toward the low halo mass end in the case of the higher tellar mass threshold in Fig. 5 .\n.2 X-ray AGN fractions in clusters\naving demonstrated the strong impact of selection effects on the alculation of AGN fractions, we next turn to the comparison of the ur model predictions with the observed fractions of AGN in massive alaxy clusters.

For each cluster a total of 0 AGN realizations are generated by repeating the seeding process f Section 3.2 10 times (re-seeded samples). For a given cluster hese 10 realisations differ in their AGN populations because of the tochastic nature of the seeding process. This results in an extended\nFigure 4.

In both panels the stars (red or blue) are the observationally measured AGN fractions of Martini et al. ( 2013 , see Section 2 ). Different colours indicate different luminosity cuts. Red is for AGNs with L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 and blue corresponds to L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 44 erg s \u22121 . For the shake of clarity the blue stars are shifted by \u22120.12 in the x -axis direction. The errorbars correspond to the 1 \u03c3 error.

This is a limitation of he Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) observationally determined specific ccretion rate distributions. The fractions predicted by the semi-empirical model fla v or with he apparent magnitude selection effects (right-hand panel in Fig. 6 ) oes not include the contribution of AGN emission to the mock alaxy SED. In the case of unobscured AGN this contribution may ominate o v er the host galaxy stellar component in the optical/midnfrared bands, particularly at high accretion luminosities ( L X 0 44 erg s \u22121 ). The estimated model fractions may therefore be unerestimated, because a higher fraction of mock AGN would be righter than the adopted apparent magnitude cut, if their contribution o the mock galaxy SED was modeled. We estimate nevertheless hat this effect is small. We modify the methodology of Section 3.4 y including all AGN cluster members abo v e the luminosity limits X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 or > 10 44 erg s \u22121 in the calculation of he corresponding AGN cluster fractions, irrespective of the apparent agnitude of their host galaxy. This is equi v alent to assuming that ll of the mock AGN are unobscured and therefore their apparent agnitudes dominate that of their hosts. This approach nevertheless\nncreases the estimated fraction at any redshift by 0 . 1 dex and herefore does not impact our results and conclusions.\nDISCUSSION\nn this work, we study the fraction of AGN in massive clusters ith a semi-empirical modelling technique that allows the genertion of realistic AGN mock catalogues. Dark matter haloes from osmological simulations are seeded with galaxies using abundance\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\natching techniques (Behroozi et al. 2019 ). On top of these galaxies ccretion events by supermassive black holes are painted. The latter tep is based on state-of-the-art specific accretion rate distributions erived from observations (Georgakakis et al. 2017 ; Aird et al. 018 ). The zero-order assumption of the semi-empirical model is hat the incidence of accretion events in galaxies is independent of nvironment, i.e. galaxies are seeded with AGNs using the same mpirical relations independent of the mass of the parent halo. We efer to the predictions of the model as \u2018field expectation\u2019 for the easons explained in Section 3.2 . This methodology reproduces by onstruction the halo mass function, stellar mass function and the -ray luminosity function as demonstrated in Fig. 2 .\n.1 AGN fractions in high-redshift clusters\nstriking result in Fig. 6 is the higher observed fraction of AGNs n massive clusters at z = 1.25 compared to the model predictions. he largest discrepancy of nearly 1 dex is for powerful AGNs with X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 44 erg s \u22121 . An enhanced fraction is also observed or moderate luminosity AGN, L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 , but the act that the observations can only place a lower limit does not llow firm conclusions on the amplitude of the effect. These findings an be attributed to systematic differences between field and cluster ither in the AGN specific accretion rate distributions or the stellar ass function of the galaxy population. The former option could be nterpreted as evidence for environmental dependence of the AGN riggering efficiency. The latter would indicate differences in the alaxy populations as a function of position on the cosmic web.\nObservations indicate that the shape of the total (i.e. independent f galaxy type or SFR) stellar mass function of galaxies does not\nFigure 7.

The blue curve is for all galaxies in the corresponding UNIVERSEMACHINE box and therefore represents the field stellar mass function. The orange colour is the stellar mass function of the satellites of the selected clusters (see Section 3.4 for more details). The shaded orange region correspond to the Poisson noise uncertainty.\ns 2 U F g o F m s t a t u e u s a a t e\nf 2 e f s s s d s a\nfi ( M o r a c b a t r\nw r u T ( e o r s e t c\n5\nI t c i c a G ( r o a o s c w a d g ( T 1 p F r t l b\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ntrongly depend on environment out to z \u2248 1.5 (e.g. Vulcani et al. 013 ; Nantais et al. 2016 ). This behaviour is also reproduced in the NIVERSEMACHINE semi-empirical model. This is demonstrated in ig. 7 that compares the (average) stellar mass function of mock alaxies in the same massive clusters used in our analysis with that f all galaxies in the UNIVERSEMACHINE box. The mass functions in ig. 7 are normalized so that their integral yields the same stellar ass density. This allows direct comparison of the mass function hapes, which are remarkably similar between massive clusters and he full box. The latter is dominated by field galaxies (i.e. not ssociated with massive haloes) and by construction reproduces he observed stellar mass function at different redshifts estimated sing e xtragalactic surv e y fields (e.g. Ilbert et al. 2013 ; Moustakas t al. 2013 ; Muzzin et al. 2013 ). The construction of AGN mocks sing the seeding process described in Section 3.2 is primarily ensitive to the shape of the galaxy mass function. The evidence bo v e therefore suggests that the difference between observations nd semi-empirical model predictions in Fig. 6 cannot be attributed o systematic variations of the total stellar mass function with nvironment. We acknowledge differences between field and cluster mass unctions for star-forming and quiescent galaxies (e.g. Vulcani et al. 013 ; Nantais et al. 2016 ; P apo vich et al. 2018 ; van der Burg t al. 2020 ), in the sense that dense environments host a larger raction of quenched galaxies. Nevertheless, such variations are econd-order effect in our empirical AGN-seeding model. This is hown in Fig. 6 , where the predictions using the Aird et al. ( 2018 ) pecific accretion rate distribution model that includes star formation ependence and those based on the Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) pecific accretion rate distribution (no SFR-dependence) are similar t z = 1.25. The higher fraction of AGN in z 1 clusters compared to the eld expectation in Fig. 6 contradicts the results of Martini et al. 2013 ), who report similar fractions. The field AGN fraction of\nartini et al. ( 2013 ) is estimated from annular regions centred n the clusters with inner and outer radii of 2 and 6 arcmin, espectiv ely. These re gions may include filaments, infalling groups, nd generally dense structures associated with the nodes of the osmic web where the cluster is found. They may therefore not e entirely representative of the true field. Relevant to this point re recent results by Koulouridis & Bartalucci ( 2019 ) who studied he radial distribution of massive galaxy clusters at z \u2248 1. They eport a statistically significant o v erdensity of X-ray selected AGNs\nithin the infall cluster region at a project distance of \u223c 2 \u20132 . 5 R 500 elative to the cluster centre. This interval lies within the region sed by Martini et al. ( 2013 ) to determine their field AGN fractions. he enhanced number of AGN found by Koulouridis & Bartalucci 2019 ) could bias high the field AGN fractions estimated by Martini t al. ( 2013 ). Our findings are consistent with the higher fraction f infrared selected AGN in massive clusters of galaxies at z 1 eported by Alberts et al. ( 2016 ). We caution nevertheless that the election function of that sample is very different from that of Martini t al. ( 2013 ). Alberts et al. ( 2016 ) identify AGN by fitting model emplates to the multiwavelength SEDs of mid-infrared selected luster members.\n.2 Reproducing high- z AGN fractions in clusters\nt is interesting to speculate on specific accretion rate distributions hat reproduce the Martini et al. ( 2013 ) AGN fractions in massive lusters of galaxies at z \u2248 1.25 shown in Fig. 6 . A distribution s required that produces more luminous AGN compared to the urrent model. There are clearly many functional forms that could chiev e that. F or simplicity, we approach this problem by assuming a aussian for the specific accretion rate distribution with parameters mean, scatter) free to vary. We caution that this problem has a broad ange of non-unique solutions. This is ultimately related to the limited bservational constraints that are not sufficient to break degeneracies mong model parameters. There are essentially only two data points, ne of which an upper limit, on the cluster AGN fraction at z \u2248 1.25 hown in Fig. 6 . It is ne vertheless, instructi ve to explore parameter ombinations (mean, scatter) that yield AGN fractions consistent ith the observations. In practice, we assume a Gaussian specific ccretion rate distribution with a given mean/scatter that is indepenent of stellar mass or SFR. This is applied to UNIVERSEMACHINE alaxies (i.e. similar to Section 3.2 ) to produce light-cones of clusters Section 3.3 ) on which selection effects are applied (Section 3.4 ). he resulting AGN factions are then required to be within the \u03c3 uncertainty of the Martini et al. ( 2013 ) L X > 10 44 erg s \u22121 data oint or larger than the lower limit for L X > 10 43 erg s \u22121 AGN in ig. 6 . The general trend is that broader distributions (larger scatter) equire lower means \u03bbsBHAR to reproduce the data. We also find hat Gaussians with mean of \u03bbsBHAR 10 \u22121 produce too many uminous AGN for any scatter value and are therefore not allowed y the observations.

These distrib utions ha ve more ower at intermediate specific accretion rates (10 \u22122 \u03bbsBHAR 0 \u22121 ) compared to the Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) and Aird et al. 2018 ) models that represent the field AGN specific accretion rate istributions. The Gaussian specific accretion rate models plotted n Fig. 8 make different predictions on the number of cluster AGN s a function of accretion luminosity. This is demonstrated in the iddle panel of Fig. 8 , which plots the predicted cluster AGN Xay luminosity functions for the different Gaussian specific accretion ate distribution models. The cluster XLF prediction is different in oth shape and normalization from the field one, also plotted in ig. 8 . Future observations that provide a broad luminosity baseline nd sufficient AGN number statistics can help constrain the models y e.g. directly measuring the XLF as a function of environment. e have also confirmed that even if massive clusters in the UNIERSEMACHINE box are assigned the higher normalization XLFs hown in Fig. 8 , the total AGN XLF averaged across environments s consistent with observations. This is because massive clusters are are as a result of the shape of the halo mass function and therefore ave a minor contribution to the mean XLF of the UNIVERSEMACHINE ox. Finally, the difference between field and cluster specific accretion ates plotted in the left-hand panel of Fig. 8 can be the result of arying black hole Eddington ratio distributions and/or duty cycles s a function of environment. These are the physical quantities that onvolve to yield the specific accretion rate distribution (e.g. Shankar t al. 2020 ; Alle v ato et al. 2021 ). The analysis presented in this paper annot identify which of the two quantities (Eddington ratio or duty ycle) is primary driving the differences in the AGN fraction between eld and cluster environments. Further work is needed to address this ssue and associate the observed differences to physical quantities irectly related to the accretion flow on to the supermassive black ole.\n.3 Evolution of AGN incidence in cluster versus field\nontrary to the results at z = 1.25 discussed abo v e, Fig. 6 shows that t lower redshift, z = 0.75, the fraction of AGN in massive clusters s consistent with the model predictions (i.e. field expectation, ee Section 3.2 ) within the observational data uncertainties. This onclusion does not strongly depend on the details of the semimpirical modelling, e.g. which specific accretion rate distribution is dopted for seeding galaxies with AGNs or the type of observational election effects (mass versus apparent magnitude cut) applied to he mock sample. At e ven lo wer redshift, z = 0.2 our analysis entatively suggests a paucity of AGN in cluster galaxies compared o the field. This is mainly driven by the higher (factor 2\u20133) raction of AGN with L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 predicted by he model compared to the observations. For more luminous AGN, X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 44 erg s \u22121 , no firm conclusions can be made ecause the observations only provide an upper limit to the AGN raction in clusters. We also caution that at this luminosity cut the emi-empirical model that uses the Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) specific ccretion rate distribution is biased high. In this model flavour a arge fraction ( \u224810 per cent; see Section 3.4 ) of the massive central alaxies is assigned powerful AGN. This fraction is much higher han the observed incidence of luminous AGN ( \u22481\u20133 per cent) mong the Brightest Cluster Galaxies Yang et al. ( 2018 ). This\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\niscrepancy is ultimately related to the stellar mass dependence of he Georgakakis et al. ( 2017 ) empirical specific accretion rates. A tronger such dependence exists in the Aird et al. ( 2018 ) specific ccretion rate distribution. As a result this model predicts much lower X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 44 erg s \u22121 AGN fractions in z = 0.2 clusters. Overall the evidence above points to a differential redshift evoluion of the incidence of AGN in clusters relative to the field. Massive tructures at z 1 are found to be more efficient in triggering ccretion events on to supermassive black holes compared to less ense regions. Such an environmental dependence is not present at \u2248 0.75 and possibly inverses at low redshift, z \u2248 0.2, in the sense hat clusters likely become less activ e re gions for black hole growth ompared to the field.\nEastman et al. ( 2007 ) also find evidence for dif ferential e volution f the AGN population as a function of environment. They compared he fraction of X-ray selected AGN in cluster of galaxies between z\n0.2 and 0.6. Their analysis suggests an accelerated evolution of he AGN population in dense environments compared to the field beween these redshifts. X-ray observations of individual protoclusters t higher redshift z 2 find that AGNs are more common among alaxies in these environments compare to the field (Lehmer et al. 009 ; Digby-North et al. 2010 ; Krishnan et al. 2017 ). These trends uggests that the probability of a galaxy hosting an accretion event epends on its small-scale environment, < 1 Mpc, in agreement with ur findings. It is also interesting that observational studies of the Halo Occuation Distribution (HOD) of AGNs are broadly consistent with this icture. At low-redshift, z 0 . 2, the HOD of X-ray AGN is proposed o have satellite fractions that increase with halo mass, albeit less apidly than the galaxy population (Miyaji et al. 2011 ; Alle v ato t al. 2012 ). This points to a decreasing fraction of AGN relative to alaxies with increasing halo mass, similar to our conclusions for low edshift clusters. At higher redshift, ho we ver, studies of the quasitellar object projected correlation function find that the quasi-stellar bject satellite fractions increase with halo mass similar to galaxies Richardson et al. 2012 ; Shen et al. 2013 ). The evidence abo v e is herefore consistent with a picture whereby the fraction of AGN in\nassive clusters evolves with redshift.\n.4 Physical interpretation\next we explore different physical mechanisms that could be esponsible for the trends discussed in the previous sections. In that espect it is interesting that the redshift evolution of the fraction f AGN in clusters relative to the field bears similarities to the tar formation properties of cluster member galaxies as a function f cosmic time. In the local Universe clusters are dominated by uiescent galaxies and their integrated SFRs are significantly lower han the field expectation (e.g. Chung et al. 2011 ). This changes o we ver to ward higher redshift. The total cluster SFR normalized o halo mass increases with look-back time and possibly catches up ith the field at z > 1 (e.g. Webb et al. 2013 ; Popesso et al. 2015 ; lberts et al. 2016 ). This is also accompanied by an inversion of he SFR versus density relation (Butcher & Oemler 1984 ), whereby luster cores at z 1 host large fractions of actively star-forming alaxy populations (e.g. Elbaz et al. 2007 ; Alberts et al. 2016 ). The rends abo v e could be explained by the increasing fraction of the old gas content of galaxies toward higher redshift (e.g. Tacconi t al. 2010 ; Saintonge et al. 2013 ; Santini et al. 2014 ; Gobat et al. 020 ) and the increasing fraction of galaxy interactions in o v erdense egions compared to the field. Ho we ver, it is still unclear if cluster ember galaxies at z 1 are as gas rich as their field counterparts.\nFigure 8. Comparison of Gaussian and the observ ationally deri ved (see Section 3.2 ) specific accretion rate distribution models for the cluster AGN sample described in Section 3.4 at z = 1.25. The left-hand panel shows the specific accretion rate distributions that describe the probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN with specific accretion rate \u03bbsBHAR at 1 < z < 1.5 and stellar masses 10 10.5 < M /M < 10 11 . The observationally derived models are the purple (Aird et al. 2018 ) and green (Georgakakis et al. 2017 ) curv es. Shaded re gion indicates 68 per cent confidence intervals. The yellow, light brown, and dark brown curves correspond to the Gaussian distributions (see text for details) with different means and dispersions as indicated in the legend. The middle panel compares the X-ray luminosity function for the cluster sample, predicted by the specific accretion rate distribution models (lines) with observations (orange points; Georgakakis et al. 2017 ). The dif ferent lines indicate the observ ationally deri ved (representati ve of the field population) specific accretion rate models (solid, Georgakakis et al. 2017 ; Aird et al. 2018 , green and purple, respectively,) and the Gaussian specific accretion-rate models, proposed to match the AGN fraction in clusters at this redshift (dashed, with different colors indicating different Gaussian parameters as indicated in the legend). The right-hand panel shows the predicted AGN fraction in clusters at z = 1.25 following the selection effects as explained in Section 3.4 . The stars (red or blue) are the observationally measured AGN fractions of Martini et al. ( 2009 , 2013 ). Different colours indicate different luminosity cut. Red is for AGN with L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 and blue corresponds to L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 44 erg s \u22121 . The predictions from the observationally derived specicific accretion-rate models in Fig. 6 are shown here with horizontal dashed\u2013dotted (Georgakakis et al. 2017 ) and solid lines (Aird et al. 2018 ). The circle, diamond, and plus markers correspond to the predictions of the three Gaussian specific accretion-rate models shown in the left-hand panel with parameters as indicated in the legend.\nS o z r e m e p c t m b f s\nw o e ( fi b w m r i t t\nd s w\nG F c t s i i 1 i m i d t (\n( m n h t M l s o e t a o o i r a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ntacking analysis at millimeter wavelengths using ALMA continuum bservations find that star-forming galaxies in massive clusters at 1 are on average significantly more deficient in molecular gas elative to the field (Alberts et al. 2022 ). This is at odds with CO mission-line observations of galaxies in clusters that typically detect olecular gas fractions comparable or higher than the field (Noble t al. 2019 ; Williams et al. 2022 ). Despite this discrepancy the general icture emerging from these studies is that star-formation in massive lusters is associated with infalling galaxies during their first passage hrough the dense region that either manage to retain/replenish their olecular gas (e.g. Vulcani et al. 2018 ; Kotecha et al. 2022 ) or have een largely stripped but continue to consume any remaining gas by orming stars before being rapidly quenched (e.g. \u2018delay then rapid\u2019 cenario Wetzel et al. 2013 ). It is therefore possible that AGN in clusters are also associated ith galaxies that fall for the first time into the deep potential well f the o v erdensity. Rele v ant to this point is the disco v ery of an xcess of X-ray AGN at the outskirts (2\u20133 R 500 ) of massive clusters M 500 > 10 14 M ) at z \u2248 1 (Koulouridis & Bartalucci 2019 ). This nding points to a direct link between the growth of supermassive lack holes and the infall region of massive structures in the cosmic eb. Therefore the strong evolution of the AGN fraction in clusters ay be linked to the increasing molecular gas content with increasing\nedshift of the galaxies that fall into massive haloes. It is then nteresting to speculate on the physical mechanisms that could lead o the differential evolution of the AGN fraction in clusters relative o the field , possible processes include:\n(i) Galaxy interactions. These are expected to be more common in ense environments and the outskirts of clusters. Moreo v er numerical imulations show that the merging rate of dark matter haloes as ell as the accretion rate on to them increases with redshift (e.g.\nottl \u0308ober, Klypin & Kravtsov 2001 ; Fakhouri & Ma 2008 ; McBride, akhouri & Ma 2009 ). Therefore the flow of galaxies from the osmic web on to massive haloes is expected to be higher at earlier imes therefore leading to enhanced galaxy interaction rates. The emi-analytical model of Gatti et al. ( 2016 ) suggests that galaxy nteractions dominate relatively luminous AGN L X 10 43 erg s \u22121 n massive haloes ( 10 14 M ) and low/intermediate redshift, z . Instead, internal processes, such as disc instabilities, become mportant for lower luminosity AGN in dense environments. At uch higher redshift, z > 2, the relative contribution of galaxy nteractions and internal processes in triggering A GN in verses, with isc instabilities dominating in massive haloes. This is because of he higher gas and disc fraction of galaxies at these higher redshift Gatti et al. 2016 ).\n(ii) Ram pressure. Interaction between the intracluster medium ICM) and the cold gas of the galaxy, can make the latter lose angular omentum (without stripping it), hence facilitating its flow to the uclear regions where it can accrete on to the supermassive black ole. Simulations have shown that this is possible, if the density of he ICM is not very dense (e.g. in the outskirts of clusters) (e.g.\narshall et al. 2018 ; Ricarte et al. 2020 ). Observations of galaxies in ocal clusters with morphological evidence for ongoing ram-pressure tripping indeed reveal a high incidence ( \u223c 27 \u201351 per cent ) of AGN ptical emission-line signatures (Peluso et al. 2022 ). It is further xpected that the ICM is more tenuous toward higher redshift and in he cluster outskirts. This is the regime where the physical conditions re more fa v ourable for the ram pressure to have a positive impact n AGN triggering. Such a scenario could lead to the observed trend f increasing AGN fractions in clusters relative to the field with ncreasing redshift. Clusters at z \u2248 0.2 have dense ICMs and the am pressure is sufficiently strong to strip galaxies off their gas even t the outskirts (e.g. Zinger et al. 2018 ; Arthur et al. 2019 ) and\nMNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\nM\nh t p d c\np c U e i c t o a I g fi m c r a i p b c\n6\nT s t t p w e i p e p g m o r e w m\nm d t e\nf A s\no s r\nt o\ng m t a\nA\nT c s P p 2 C t A b C I a t ( 2 P o l\nD\nT p e\nR\nA A A\nA A A\nA A\nA A A B B\n4 http://www .astropy .org 5 https:// bdiemer.bitbucket.io/colossus/ index.html 6 https:// numpy.org/ 7 https:// scipy.org/ 8 https:// matplotlib.org/ 9 ht tps://pypi.org/project /halomod/\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1041/6779717 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nence, perhaps suppress powerful AGN. Instead, at higher redshift he conditions may be appropriate for the ram pressure to have a ositi ve ef fect and boost the numbers of luminous AGN. The radial istribution of AGN within massive haloes could provide further onstraints this scenario (e.g. Marshall et al. 2018 ).\nIn addition to the processes abo v e, simulations also highlight the otential of cosmic filaments in channeling matter and streams of old gas deep into the potential well of massive overdensities in the ni verse (e.g. K ere \u030cs et al. 2005 ; Dekel & Birnboim 2006 ; Kere \u030cs t al. 2009 ), particularly at high redshift, z 1. Galaxies that fall nto clusters along such filaments are shielded from the hot ICM and an therefore retain at least part of their gas reservoirs even close o the cluster core (Kotecha et al. 2022 ). This delays the quenching f galaxies by modulating ram-pressure stripping or strangulation nd allows the formation of new stars in dense cluster environments. t can be expected that the same process also promotes black hole rowth in the galaxies that accrete on to massive haloes through laments. Furthemore Kotecha et al. ( 2022 ) argue that this effect is ore pronounced at high redshifts z = 1\u20133 since at this epoch the old flow filaments are expected to have a higher temperature contrast elative to the ICM and cluster haloes are typically less massive. Such n evolution pattern is consistent with the higher fraction of AGN n massive clusters at z 1 compared to lower redshift. Additional rocesses (e.g. interactions, positive impact of ram pressure) need to e invoked to explain the difference between the AGN fractions in luster and field at z 1.\nSUMMARY A N D C O N C L U S I O N S\nhis paper addresses the fundamental question of the role of smallcale environment ( < 1 Mpc) in triggering accretion events on to he supermassive black holes at the nuclear regions of galaxies. We ackle this issue by developing a flexible semi-empirical model that opulates the dark matter haloes of cosmological N -body simulations ith AGN using observational relations on the incidence of accretion vents among galaxies. This zero-order assumption of the model s that the probability of accretion events are independent of the arent halo masses of galaxies, i.e. agnostic to their small-scale nvironment. Moreo v er, the observ ationally deri ved AGN incidence robabilities adopted by the model are representative of the field alaxy population, i.e. those outside massive groups or clusters. This odel is used to predict the fraction of AGN in massive clusters f galaxies at different redshifts and compare against observational esults by carefully taking into account observational selections f fects. Any dif ferences between model predictions and observ ations ould point to an environmental dependence of AGN triggering echanisms. Our main findings are\n(i) the X-ray AGN fraction in massive clusters are larger than the odel prediction at z \u223c 1.25. This points to a strong environmental\nependence of AGN triggering at high redshift. Black hole accreion events are promoted in massive haloes relative to the model xpectation, which in turn represents the field expectation.\n(ii) the model predictions are consistent with the observed AGN ractions of interemediate redshift ( z \u223c 0.75) clusters of galaxies. t this redshift, it appears that massive haloes do not promote or uppress AGN activity relative to the field predictions of the model. (iii) at low redshift, z \u223c 0.2, the model o v erpredicts the fraction f L X (2 \u201310 keV) > 10 43 erg s \u22121 AGN in clusters compared to obervations. This suggests a suppression of AGN activity in clusters elative to the field expectation of the model at z \u223c 0.2.\nNRAS 518, 1041\u20131056 (2023)\n(iv) o v erall the points abo v e suggest a differential redshift evoluion of the AGN fraction in clusters relative to the field predictions f our semi-empirical model.\nThe observed trends above may be related to the increasing as content of galaxies with increasing redshift, coupled with echanisms such as galaxy interactions or ram-pressure. Both of hese processes under certain conditions could promote AGN activity mong galaxies that fall on to massive clusters at higher redshift.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for their omments to the paper, A\u0301ngel Ruiz Camu \u0303 nas for discussions that ignificantly impro v ed the simulation code used in this work and eter Behroozi for his help with the UNIVERSEMACHINE dataset.
