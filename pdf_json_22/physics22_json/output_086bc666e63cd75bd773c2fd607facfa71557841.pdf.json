By taking into account the permutational symmetry, we outline a simple scheme that allows us to map the dynamics of N identical d-level systems to the dynamics of d bosonic modes with N particles, achieving an exponential reduction on the dimensionality of the problem in a simple and straightforward way. In particular, we consider the Lindblad dynamics of several identical multilevel systems interacting with a common subsystem under the action of collective dissipation terms.",

By taking into account the permutational symmetry, we outline a simple scheme that allows us to map the dynamics of N identical d-level systems to the dynamics of d bosonic modes with N particles, achieving an exponential reduction on the dimensionality of the problem in a simple and straightforward way. In particular, we consider the Lindblad dynamics of several identical multilevel systems interacting with a common subsystem under the action of collective dissipation terms.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.105.043704\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWhen dealing with a collection of N d-level systems, a well-known problem is the so-called curse of dimensionality, i.e., the fact that the dimension of the Hilbert space scales exponentially as dN . However, in many different physical phenomena, such as lasing [1,2], phase transitions [3\u20135], superradiance [6,7], strong coupling with organic molecules [8,9] and microwave photonics [10], the theoretical modeling usually assumes that the emitters are identical. In these situations, permutational symmetry of the N d-level systems can be used to greatly reduce the complexity of the problem. This was addressed in the works of Gegg et al. [11\u201313], Shammah et al. [14], and Kirton and Keeling [15,16]. In these works, the dynamics of an open quantum system composed of several identical emitters interacting with a common subsystem under the action of individual, but identical, collapse operators is considered. By exploiting the permutational symmetry of the density matrix in the symmetrized Liouville space, a huge reduction in the complexity of the problem is achieved, allowing calculations for larger numbers of emitters than possible otherwise. These efforts were conducted for an ensemble of multilevel systems [11\u201313] and specialized for the case of two-level systems [14\u201316]. In the absence of individual dephasing operators and for appropriate initial states, one can further restrict the Hilbert space to the totally symmetric subspace [11,13]. In the case of two-level systems, the construction of the totally symmetric subspace can be achieved by using the Dicke basis, restricting the Hilbert space to the highest superspin subspace [6,7].\nIn this paper, we notice that working in the totally symmetric subspace is completely equivalent to restricting the possible states to bosonic many-body states. Therefore, by applying the rules of second quantization for bosons, we achieve\n*ruiefdasilva@gmail.com \u2020johannes.feist@uam.es\nthe reduction to the totally symmetric subspace in a simple and straightforward way, mapping the dynamics of N identical d-level systems to the dynamics of d bosonic modes with N particles."

            "text": "We start by considering the dynamics of N identical d-level systems interacting with a common subsystem and under the action of collective dissipation terms, described by the Lindblad master equation,\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] + \u2211\ni\nLCi [\u03c1], (1)\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian, possibly time dependent, and LCi [\u03c1] = Ci\u03c1C\u2020i \u2212 12 (C\u2020i Ci\u03c1 + \u03c1C\u2020i Ci ) is the Lindblad dissipator for the collapse operator Ci. In the following, we assume the Hamiltonian, H , to be invariant under any permutation of the d-level systems. We also restrict the collapse operators, Ci, to collective operators that are also invariant under any permutation of the d-level systems. For the case where the collapse operators may act locally on each d-level system, we must construct and work on the symmetrized Liouville space and this was taken into account in Refs. [11\u201316]. In this paper, we restrict to the case where both the Hamiltonian and the collapse operators are invariant under any permutation of the emitters.\nWe may define the symmetrization operator\nS = 1 N! \u2211 \u03c0 P\u03c0 (2)\nwhere P\u03c0 is a permutation operator and \u03c0 runs over all possible permutations of the d-level systems. A permutationally invariant operator, O, then satisfies [S, O] = 0. We also assume that the initial state, \u03c10 = \u2211 i pi|\u03c8i\u3009\u3008\u03c8i|, is a totally symmetric state, i.e., S|\u03c8i\u3009 = |\u03c8i\u3009 for all |\u03c8i\u3009. Since both the Hamiltonian, H , and the collapse operators, Ci, are permutationally invariant operators, when solving the Lindblad\n2469-9926/2022/105(4)/043704(7) 043704-1 \u00a92022 American Physical Society\ndynamics, the density matrix will always remain in the totally symmetric subspace. This may be used to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the problem. As already noticed in Refs. [11,13], this reduction of dimensionality is even larger than the one obtained by working in the symmetrized Liouville space. We must stress that the difference in the restrictions imposed in this paper and the symmetrized Liouville space approach is that here each collapse operator Ci must be permutationally invariant, whereas in Refs. [11\u201316] only the sum of all collapse operators, \u2211 i Ci, must be permutationally invariant. We can write any permutationally invariant M-body operator acting solely on the emitters as\nOMem = 1\nM! N\u2211 i1...iM \u2032 d\u2211 \u03b11...\u03b1M \u03b21...\u03b2M V \u03b21...\u03b2M\u03b11...\u03b1M \u03c3 i1 \u03b21,\u03b11 . . . \u03c3 iM \u03b2M ,\u03b1M\n(3)\nwhere \u03c3 j\u03b2,\u03b1 = |\u03b2\u3009 j\u3008\u03b1| j is an operator acting on emitter j, and the primed sum indicates that all indices i1, . . . , iM have to be distinct. Using this definition, any permutationally invariant operator acting on the emitters and containing up to M-body terms can be written as\nOem = M\u2211\nJ=1 OJem. (4)\nIn general, a permutationally invariant operator that may act on the emitters and on a common subsystem can be written as the sum of three terms:\nO = Oem + Oem-sub + Osub, (5) where Oem (Osub) is an operator acting only on the emitters (subsystem). The interaction term, Oem-sub, can be written as Oem-sub = \u2211 q AqBq, where Aq acts solely on the emitters and must have the form of Eq. (4) and Bq is an operator acting on the common subsystem.\nAt this point, one may realize that if the state of the system is restricted to the totally symmetric Hilbert space one can take advantage of all the formalisms of second quantization for bosons, for which the many-body states are automatically restricted to the totally symmetric Hilbert space. This can be done by applying the rules of second quantization [17] and mapping all the operators to a second-quantized form. For instance, Eq. (3) becomes\nOMem = 1\nM! d\u2211 \u03b11...\u03b1M \u03b21...\u03b2M V \u03b21...\u03b2M\u03b11...\u03b1M b \u2020 \u03b21 . . . b\u2020\u03b2M b\u03b11 . . . b\u03b1M (6)\nwhere b\u2020\u03b1 and b\u03b1 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of an emitter in state \u03b1. The recipe then simply consists in applying these rules to all the relevant operators, i.e., the Hamiltonian, the collapse operators, and all the desired observables, giving a Hamiltonian that can be easily implemented with standard quantum optics packages such as QUTIP [18]. For the typical cases where the number of emitters N is fixed, one can restrict the Hilbert space to the N-particle subspace, for which \u3008\u2211d\u03b1=1 b\u2020\u03b1b\u03b1\u3009 = N . Similarly, for the initial state, \u03c10 = \u2211 i pi|\u03c8i\u3009\u3008\u03c8i|, each |\u03c8i\u3009 has to be mapped to its second-quantized version, i.e., expressed in the Fock space.\nThis approach thus solves the dynamics of N permutationally invariant d-level systems by treating it as the dynamics of N bosons in a system with d modes, see Fig. 1 for a schematic picture. It has the usual advantages of a second-quantized formulation. In particular, it is not necessary to explicitly construct a totally symmetric subspace, and the correct symmetry enhancement factors are automatically encoded within and obtained from the bosonic operator algebra."

            "text": "The study of few-level emitters interacting with light is at the core of our understanding of light-matter interaction. In principle, the problem of light-matter interaction can be fully understood within the laws of quantum electrodynamics (QED) [19]. However, for practical applications in fields such as cavity QED, quantum optics, quantum nanophotonics, and quantum plasmonics, a very common assumption is that matter degrees of freedom can be described using only a few levels and that the interaction with light is dominated by a single mode of the electromagnetic field. In the case of two-level systems, this leads to the well-known Rabi [20], Dicke [6], Jaynes-Cummings [21], and Tavis-Cummings [22] models, which differ in the number of emitters and the use of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, even when dealing with an ensemble of few-level systems, the exponential scaling of the Hilbert-space dimension quickly makes the problem intractable and symmetry considerations must be taken into account to reduce the dimension of the problem. In the context of the interaction of an ensemble of identical two-level systems with a cavity mode, superradiance can be observed. To study superradiance, it is useful to rewrite the Hamiltonian using spin operators and use the so-called Dicke basis [7]. In the following, we demonstrate our approach for several examples within this context.\n043704-2"

            "text": "As a first example to illustrate our approach, we will apply it to the Tavis-Cummings model [22]. For this relatively simple example, we show explicitly that the state space and matrix elements within the second quantized picture are the same as in conventional approaches. The Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian is given by\nHTC = N\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c90\n2\n( \u03c3 je,e \u2212 \u03c3 jg,g ) + \u03c9ca\u2020cac\n+ g N\u2211\nj=1\n( ac\u03c3 j e,g + a\u2020c\u03c3 jg,e ) (7)\nwhere g (e) stands for the ground (excited) state, N is the number of two-level systems, \u03c90 (\u03c9c) is the two-level system (cavity) energy, and ac is the bosonic annihilation operator for the cavity. A standard approach is to rewrite the above Hamiltonian using spin operators and work in the Dicke basis [7], where S+ = \u2211N j=1 \u03c3 j e,g, S\u2212 = (S+)\u2020 and Sz = \u2211N j=1 1 2 (\u03c3 j e,e \u2212 \u03c3 j\ng,g). The Hamiltonian can then be written as\nHTC = \u03c90Sz + \u03c9ca\u2020cac + g(acS+ + a\u2020cS\u2212), (8) and the emitter states are |s, m\u3009, where s and m are the quantum numbers associated to S2 and Sz. The totally symmetric subspace is then the highest spin subspace, where s = N/2.\nIf we instead apply our approach and second quantize Eq. (7), we obtain\nHTC = \u03c90 2 (b\u2020ebe \u2212 b\u2020gbg) + \u03c9ca\u2020cac + g(acb\u2020ebg + a\u2020cb\u2020gbe). (9) In order to see that both approaches are completely equivalent in the totally symmetric subspace (s = N/2), we examine the matrix elements of S\u2212. The action of S\u2212 on a Dicke state is\nS\u2212|s, m\u3009 = \u221a\ns(s + 1) \u2212 m(m \u2212 1)|s, m \u2212 1\u3009. (10) Here, m = Nexc \u2212 N/2 is directly related to the number of excited emitters, Nexc.\nFor the second-quantized version, S\u2212 maps to b\u2020gbe, which acts on the Fock states |ng, ne\u3009, where ng = N \u2212 Nexc and ne = Nexc, as\nb\u2020gbe|ng, ne\u3009 = \u221a\n(ng + 1)ne|ng + 1, ne \u2212 1\u3009. (11) The Dicke state |s = N/2, m = Nexc \u2212 N/2\u3009 is equal to the Fock state |N \u2212 Nexc, Nexc\u3009, and comparing Eqs. (10) and (11) shows that the matrix elements are indeed equal. The equality can also easily be checked for Sz \u2261 12 (b\u2020ebe \u2212 b\u2020gbg). Therefore, within the totally symmetric subspace, it is completely equivalent to work with either of the two Hamiltonians, Eq. (7) or Eq. (9)."

            "text": "The field of molecular polaritonics and polaritonic chemistry [23\u201328] studies how to manipulate and use the changes in electronic and vibrational structure and dynamics of molecules under strong coupling with confined modes of light. Since molecules are complex systems with significant internal structure due to rovibrational (nuclear) motion,\ndescribing them as two-level systems is often not a good approximation. At the same time, the influence of individual collapse operators acting on each molecule can often be neglected. On the one hand, their individual radiative decay (on scales of nanoseconds) is often much slower than the dynamics of interest. On the other hand, the influence of the vibrational modes that is sometimes included through a pure-dephasing Lindblad term (which has to be replaced by a more careful treatment under strong light-matter coupling to prevent unphysical effects [29]) can be much better described by treating some vibrational modes (or superpositions of them corresponding to so-called reaction coordinates) explicitly, which allows neglecting the other ones at reasonably short timescales [30,31]. These considerations apply especially for organic molecules interacting with a plasmonic nanocavity [32,33], since their ultrafast loss is typically the dominant decay channel in the system. Explicit inclusion of nuclear degrees of freedom also allows us to represent many effects that cannot be understood within a two-level system description [8,34]. A workhorse in this field is the so-called Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model [8], in which the molecule is approximated using the Holstein model, i.e., two displaced harmonic oscillators for the electronic ground and excited states. Therefore, when dealing with molecular polaritonics, it is common to face situations where one needs to solve the dynamics of identical multilevel systems without any individual collapse operator.\nThe Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian can be written as\nHHTC = \u03c9ca\u2020cac + Nmol\u2211 i=1 H (i)mol + Nmol\u2211 i=1 H (i)cav-mol, (12) H (i)mol = \u03c9e\u03c3+i \u03c3\u2212i + \u03c9vc\u2020i ci \u2212 \u03bbv\u03c3+i \u03c3\u2212i (c\u2020i + ci ) (13)\nH (i)cav-mol = g(\u03c3+i ac + a\u2020c\u03c3\u2212i ), (14) where \u03c3+i (\u03c3 \u2212 i ) is the raising (lowering) operator for the electronic state in molecule i with excitation energy \u03c9e, whereas ci is the annihilation operator for the vibrational mode in molecule i, with frequency \u03c9v and exciton-phonon coupling strength \u03bbv . The cavity is described through the photon annihilation (creation) operators ac (a\u2020c), with photon energy \u03c9c. In addition to the coherent dynamics described by the Hamiltonian, the cavity mode decays with rate \u03b3c, described by a standard Lindblad decay operator C = \u221a\u03b3cac.\nThe Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of the eigenstates of the single-molecule Hamiltonian,\nH (i)mol = \u2211 s=g,e \u2211 \u03bd \u03c9s,\u03bd |s, \u03bd\u3009i\u3008s, \u03bd|i, (15)\nwhich are labeled as |g, \u03bd\u3009i and |e, \u03bd\u3009i for vibrational sublevel \u03bd in the electronic ground and excited state, respectively. Their corresponding energies are \u03c9g,\u03bd = \u03c9v\u03bd and \u03c9e,\u03bd = \u03c9e + \u03c9v\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb2v/\u03c9v . In this basis, the light-matter interaction operator is given by\nH (i)cav-mol = g \u2211 \u03bd\u03bd \u2032 (acF\u03bd\u03bd \u2032 |e, \u03bd\u3009i\u3008g, \u03bd \u2032|i + H.c.), (16)\n043704-3\nwhere F\u03bd\u03bd \u2032 = \u3008e, \u03bd|\u03c3+i |g, \u03bd \u2032\u3009 is a vibrational overlap integral or Franck-Condon factor and can be analytically obtained.\nSince both the Hamiltonian and collapse operators are permutationally invariant, we can map Eq. (12) to its secondquantized form as long as the initial state is fully symmetric. This gives\nHHTC = \u03c9ca\u2020cac + \u2211 s=g,e \u2211 \u03bd \u03c9s,\u03bdb \u2020 s,\u03bdbs,\u03bd\n+ g \u2211 \u03bd\u03bd \u2032 (acF\u03bd\u03bd \u2032b \u2020 e,\u03bdbg,\u03bd \u2032 + H.c.). (17)\nIn the following, we choose parameter values typical for organic molecules such as anthracene coupled to nanoplasmonic cavities [30], with \u03c9e = 3.5 eV, \u03c9v = 0.182 eV, \u03bbv = 0.096 eV, \u03b3c = 0.2 eV, g = 0.035 eV. We set the cavity photon energy to be on resonance with the emission peak of the molecule, \u03c9c = \u03c9e \u2212 2\u03bb2v/\u03c9v . The initial state is chosen to be the fully inverted state, i.e., the state where all molecules are instantaneously excited to the electronic excited state by a vertical Franck-Condon transition.\nIn Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), we show the numerical results for the dynamics for the cavity and excited-state population,\nrespectively. In the basis truncation for the single-molecule Hilbert space, we include the six lowest vibrational states for the ground state and the four lowest vibrational states for the electronic excited state, which gives converged results. Within the second-quantized approach, we show results up to Nmol = 5, while without resorting to any permutational symmetry we show results up to Nmol = 3.\nThe exciton population in Fig. 2(b) displays a clear enhancement of the spontaneous emission due to Dicke superradiance [6] as the number of emitters is increased. Furthermore, a modulation of the decay rate with a period of about 22 fs can be observed. This modulation is more clearly visible in the cavity population [see Fig. 2(a)] and is a signature of the vibrational motion [30], which has a period of Tv = 2\u03c0/\u03c9v = 22.7 fs.\nAs expected, both approaches are completely equivalent. However, while the Hilbert space for the brute-force approach reaches size NHilb = 4000 for three molecules, it only has size NHilb = 220 within the second-quantized approach exploiting the permutational symmetry. For five molecules, this advantage improves to NHilb = 12 012 versus NHilb = 600 000. Here, it should be noted that the size of the density matrix that is propagated in the Lindblad master equation is NHilb \u00d7 NHilb, while the Liouvillian superoperator describing this evolution can be formally treated as a N2Hilb \u00d7 N2Hilb matrix."

            "text": "To give another numerical example to illustrate this mapping, we formulate a simple model Hamiltonian of N d-level systems, where the levels of each emitter are equally separated in energy by \u03c9e, coupled to a cavity mode with frequency \u03c9c = \u03c9e = 1 eV. The transition operator of each emitter is defined as \u03bci = \u03bc+i + \u03bc\u2212i , where \u03bc+i = \u2211d\u22121 \u03bd=1 \u03c3 i \u03bd,\u03bd+1 and \u03bc \u2212 i = (\u03bc+i ) \u2020 and each emitter is coupled to the cavity mode by a coupling strength of g = 0.15\u221a N\neV in the rotating wave approximation. We also include an all-to-all dipole-dipole interaction term, Hd-d = D \u2211N k, j =k \u03bci\u03bc j , where D = 0.1 eV. The Hamiltonian is then given by\nH = N\u2211\ni=1 d\u2211 \u03bd=1 \u03c9\u03bd\u03c3 i \u03bd,\u03bd + \u03c9ca\u2020cac + Hd-d\n+ g N\u2211\ni=1 (\u03bc\u2212i a \u2020 c + H.c.), (18)\nwhere \u03c9\u03bd = \u03bd\u03c9e. The system is under the action of the incoherent decay of the cavity, Ccav = \u221a\u03b3cac where \u03b3c = 0.15 eV, as well as collective spontaneous emission, C\u03bd =\u221a\n\u2193 \u2211N i=1 \u03c3 i \u03bd,\u03bd+1, where \u03bd runs from 1 to d \u2212 1 and \u2193 = 0.05 eV.

The above Hamiltonian and collapse operators are clearly invariant under any permutation of the emitters. Also, the initial state belongs to the totally symmetric subspace. Therefore, we can again proceed with the mapping by second quantizing all relevant operators. In particular, the Hamiltonian can be\n043704-4\nwritten as\nH = d\u2211\n\u03bd=1 \u03c9\u03bdb\n\u2020 \u03bdb\u03bd + \u03c9ca\u2020cac + Hd-d\n+ g N\u2211\ni=1 d\u2211 \u03bd=1 (b\u2020\u03bdb\u03bd+1a \u2020 c + H.c.), (19)\nwhere\nHd-d = D d\u22121\u2211 \u03bd=1 d\u22121\u2211 \u03bc=1 (b\u2020\u03bdb \u2020 \u03bcb\u03bd+1b\u03bc+1 + b\u2020\u03bd+1b\u2020\u03bc+1b\u03bdb\u03bc\n+ b\u2020\u03bd+1b\u2020\u03bcb\u03bdb\u03bc+1 + b\u2020\u03bdb\u2020\u03bc+1b\u03bd+1b\u03bc). (20) Note that this operator is expressed using normal ordering. The d \u2212 1 collective spontaneous emission collapse operators can be rewritten as C\u03bd = \u221a \u2193b\u2020\u03bdb\u03bd+1. Finally, the initial state is just |\u03c80\u3009 = 1\u221aN! (b \u2020 d )\nN |vac\u3009em|vac\u3009cav. In Figs. 3 and 4, we show the results of the dynamics for the case of three-level systems, i.e., d = 3. The total population of the different levels, \u3008\u2211Ni=1 \u03c3 i\u03bd,\u03bd\u3009, can be mapped in the secondquantized approach to \u3008b\u2020\u03bdb\u03bd\u3009. Figure 3(a) shows the results for\nN = 5. In Fig. 3(b), we show the results for N = 17 emitters. In Fig. 4, we show the time-dependent expectation value of the dipole-dipole interaction term, \u3008\u03bci\u03bc j\u3009 for i = j.\nAgain, as expected, the second-quantized approach is completely equivalent to the direct solution. In this case, the brute-force approach is numerically intractable, as the number of entries in the density matrix is d2N N2c , where Nc is the dimension of the cavity Hilbert space. When working only with the totally symmetric subspace, the number of entries in the density matrix is reduced to\n( (N + d \u2212 1)! N!(d \u2212 1)! )2 N2c , (21)\ngreatly reducing the size of the dynamical object. When comparing with the approach that uses the symmetrized Liouville space, where the number of entries in the density matrix is (N+d2\u22121)! N!(d2\u22121)! N 2 c [11,13], we also get a substantial reduction. As an example, for d = 3 and N = 17, we have a reduction of the number of entries in the density matrix by a factor of 37.\nSince we start in the fully inverted state, the dipole-dipole interaction, Hd-d , starts to transfer population from the highest\n043704-5\nexcited emitter state to the intermediate excited state and to a smaller extent to the emitter ground state. After this first moment, the cavity starts to become populated and, due to its decay, drives the system to its overall ground state (see Fig. 3). It is important to notice that due to the dipole-dipole interaction, Hd-d , the ground state of the system is not the state where all emitters are in their bare ground state. Consequently, there is a residual population of the intermediate excited state for long times (see Fig. 3). This is also the reason why the dipole-dipole interaction goes to negative values for long times (see Fig. 4).\nD. N-excitation subspace\nWhen working with the dynamics of emitters coupled to cavity modes, there are situations in which we are not interested in working with the full excitation subspace. Indeed, in many common cases, restricting to the first or second excitation subspace is enough [9,34]. Implementing such a restriction within the current approach is rather simple, as one only needs to define an operator that determines the number of excitations in terms of creation and annihilation operators of the emitter levels. As an example, if one is working with the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, where each emitter is described as having two electronic states, ground and excited, with one vibrational mode, one could define a subspace where restrictions are imposed on either the electronic or nuclear excitations, or both.\nAs a concrete example, we discuss vibrational strong coupling for the case where a single (approximately harmonic) vibrational mode per molecule is in resonance with a cavity mode. The simplest Hamiltonian to model collective vibrational strong coupling is [29]\nH = \u03c9ca\u2020cac + Nmol\u2211 i=1 \u03c9vc \u2020 i ci + Nmol\u2211 i=1 g(a\u2020cci + H.c.), (22)\nwhere ac is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode with frequency \u03c9c, and ci is the annihilation operator of the optically active vibrational mode of molecule i, characterized by its frequency \u03c9v . Nmol is the number of molecules, and the cavity-phonon interaction is given by g. Rewriting the vibrational operators using the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, c\u2020i = \u2211\u221e n=0 \u221a n + 1|n + 1\u3009i\u3008n|i, Eq. (22) can be written as\nH = \u03c9ca\u2020cac + Nmol\u2211 i=1 \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u03c9v|n\u3009i\u3008n|i\n+ Nmol\u2211 i=1 \u221e\u2211 n=0 g(ac \u221a n + 1|n + 1\u3009i\u3008n|i + H.c.). (23)\nThis Hamiltonian is permutationally invariant under the exchange of any two molecules. If the initial state is in the totally\nsymmetric subspace, we can map the Hamiltonian to\nH = \u03c9ca\u2020cac + \u221e\u2211\nn=0 n\u03c9vb\n\u2020 nbn\n+ \u221e\u2211\nn=0 g(ac\n\u221a n + 1b\u2020n+1bn + H.c.), (24)\nwhere bn is the bosonic annihilation operator for the state |n\u3009 and the states of interest are restricted to the subspace where \u3008\u2211\u221en=0 b\u2020nbn\u3009 = Nmol. For regimes in which \u03c9v \u2248 \u03c9c, it is reasonable to work in the Nexc-excitation subspace [35]. In this formalism, this additional restriction can be simply formulated as \u3008\u2211\u221en=0 nb\u2020nbn + a\u2020cac\u3009 = Nexc."

            "text": "To conclude, we have proposed a scheme to fully exploit the permutational symmetry of identical but arbitrary emitters when only collective dissipation operators are considered. This scheme relies on the fact that the totally symmetric subspace is equivalent to a bosonic many-body state. After mapping all relevant operators to a second-quantized picture using a simple procedure, the explicit construction of the totally symmetric subspace from direct state products is not required anymore. This approach thus provides a straightforward and easily implemented way to treat such systems while fully exploiting their permutational symmetry to significantly reduce the size of the Hilbert space. We discuss several examples, such as the Tavis-Cummings model, the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, and a model Hamiltonian where two-body operators are taken into account, and explicitly demonstrate the equivalence of the second-quantized approach to direct solution.\nWe expect that this paper will be helpful for simulations that can fully exploit the permutational symmetry of emitters in totally symmetric cases in a very simple way. This can be especially useful for situations where each emitter must be considered as having an internal structure that goes beyond the two-level approximation, such as necessary in the field of molecular polaritonics. For such systems, the current approach can provide a significant reduction of the numerical complexity for very little effort."
