    "abstractText": "The service environment of OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods) in oil and gas fields is becoming more and more severe due to the strong affinity between ions or atoms of corrosive species coming from solutions and metal ions or atoms on metals. While it is difficult for traditional technologies to accurately analyze the corrosion characteristics of OCTG in CO2-H2S-Cl systems, it is necessary to study the corrosion-resistant behavior of TC4 (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys based on an atomic or molecular scale. In this paper, the thermodynamic characteristics of the TiO2(100) surface of TC4 alloys in the CO2-H2S-Cl system were simulated and analyzed by first principles, and the corrosion electrochemical technologies were used to verify the simulation results. The results indicated that all of the best adsorption positions of corrosive ions (Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3, and CO3) on TiO2(100) surfaces were bridge sites. A forceful charge interaction existed between Cl, S, and O atoms in Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3, CO3, and Ti atoms in TiO2(100) surfaces after adsorption in a stable state. The charge was transferred from near Ti atoms in TiO2 to near Cl, S, and O atoms in Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3, and CO3. Electronic orbital hybridization occurred between 3p5 of Cl, 3p4 of S, 2p4 of O, and 3d2 of Ti, which was chemical adsorption. The effect strength of five corrosive ions on the stability of TiO2 passivation film was S2\u2212 > CO3 > Cl\u2212 > HS\u2212 > HCO3. In addition, the corrosion current density of TC4 alloy in different solutions containing saturated CO2 was as follows: NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3 > NaCl + Na2S > NaCl + Na2CO3 > NaCl. At the same time, the trends of Rs (solution transfer resistance), Rct (charge transfer resistance), and Rc (ion adsorption double layer resistance) were opposite to the corrosion current density. The corrosion resistance of TiO2 passivation film to corrosive species was weakened owing to the synergistic effect of corrosive species. Severe corrosion resulted, especially pitting corrosion, which further proved the simulation results mentioned above. Thus, this outcome provides the theoretical support to reveal the corrosion resistance mechanism of OCTG and to develop novel corrosion inhibitors in CO2-H2S-Cl environments.",

            "text": "Corrosion has been considered as one of the major social problems in pipelines and industries using such materials since the early industrial revolution. A large number of accidents occur frequently, which leads to a greater threat to the safe production of oil and gas [1]. The annual cost of corrosion in China is about CNY 2.3 trillion, accounting for 3.3% of GDP [2]. In recent years, with the development of deep and ultra-deep wells to meet the social demand for energy, the working environment of tubing and casing is becoming more and more complex. In addition to the stringent service conditions, metal OCTG are inevitably subjected to different degrees of corrosion, and the working properties of OCTG have\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3129. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16083129 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3129 2 of 13\ndecreased. For example, the presence of H2S leads to severe localized corrosion, as well as cracks caused by stress and hydrogen [3]. In some special working conditions, CO2 and H2S exist at the same time [4], which greatly deteriorates the service environment of OCTG [5]. The high temperature, pressure, acid gas content, and Cl\u2212 concentration of oil and gas wells increase the requirements for corrosion-resistant OCTG. The TC4 titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) is now considered to be the ideal material applied in oil and gas fields, accounting for about half of the market share of titanium alloys currently used in the world [6]. A dense TiO2 oxide film with a thickness of 4~6 nm of TC4 will be spontaneously formed at room temperature [7], which can effectively prevent the matrix in a solution from being corroded by corrosive ions (such as H+, Cl\u2212, etc.) [8]. However, the film is not always able to maintain its integrity; it is very likely to be destroyed in some medium containing some corrosive species, resulting in serious corrosion of the titanium alloy matrix [9]. It is difficult for traditional technologies to accurately analyze the corrosion characteristics of OCTG in CO2-H2S-Cl\u2212 systems. Therefore, the first-principles calculation software (Materials Studio) on account of DFT (Density Functional Theory) was selected to research the interface characteristics between the corrosive species and TiO2 passivation film on the surface of TC4 alloys in CO2-H2S-Cl\u2212 systems containing Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3\u2212, and CO32\u2212 based on an atomic or molecular scale. Additionally, the corrosion characteristics of the TC4 alloy in NaCl, NaCl + Na2CO3, NaCl + Na2S, and NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3 solutions containing saturated CO2 were carried out by the electrochemical technologies to verify the simulation results above."

Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra of TiO2 film on TC4 alloy, and Table 1 shows the frequency shift positions of Raman spectral characteristics of three crystalline TiO2. The four peaks, 145.53 cm\u22121, 241.76 cm\u22121, 612.53 cm\u22121, and 824.16 cm\u22121 in Figure 1, are consistent with the corresponding peak value of the rutile TiO2 in Table 1. Some scholars found that the composition of titanium alloy passivation film was rutile TiO2 [11].

The characteristics of the various ions on TiO2(110) surfaces have been studied, including our previous research [2], but few reports were focused on the adsorption of TiO2(100) and TiO2(001) surfaces. Furthermore, compared with TiO2(001) surfaces, TiO2(100) surfaces present a higher possibility of stable existence at high temperatures [12]. Therefore, the adsorption properties of various corrosive ions (Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3\u2212, and CO32\u2212) on rutile TiO2(100) surfaces were studied. The CASTEP in Material Studio, the first-principles computing software, was used to conduct geometric optimization for all adsorption configurations [13]. According to the setting requirements of the CASTEP module, a 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 three-dimensional supercell structure with periodic boundary conditions was established for the rutile TiO2(100) surface. In addition, a vacuum area with a thickness of 20 \u00c5 was added between the two plates to prevent interaction between them [14].

A wire was welded to one end of the sample and tested for conductivity with a multimeter to verify whether the wire was welded correctly. The surface at the other end of the sample was the electrochemical test surface. The surface other than the electrochemical test surface was glued and stamped with epoxy resin AB glue and then polished with sandpaper with mesh sizes of 400#, 800#, 1200#, 1500#, and 2000#. For the purpose of reaching the test requirements for sample roughness, the sample surface was polished to 2000#, cleaned with distilled water, degreased with acetone, dehydrated and desiccated with alcohol, and dried with cold air for later use.\n2.2.2. Experimental Methods and Equipment\nThe electrochemical test was carried out by Princeton P4000 electrochemical workstation, in which the working electrode was TC4 alloy, the reference electrode was polytetrafluoro silver chloride, and the auxiliary electrode was a platinum electrode. Before the electrochemical test, high-purity nitrogen was used to deoxygenate the required corrosive medium for 1 h., and the temperature was heated up to the preset temperature (80 \u25e6C). The electrochemical test was performed when the entire test system reached stability, and each experiment was performed three times. The working electrode was pre-polarized at a voltage set value of \u22121200 mV for 3 min in advance of the electrochemical test. After the oxide film spontaneously took shape on the surface of the sample in the air and was eliminated, the working electrode was put in the prepared medium and stood for 30 min to form new film. The test frequency was set to 10\u22122 HZ~105 HZ, the measured signal amplitude was 10 mV sine wave, and the number of points was 50. The scanning rat was set as 0.3333 mV/s, and the potential was \u22121000 mV~+1600 mV. The corrosive medium was 35 g/L NaCl, 35 g/L NaCl + 1 g/L Na2CO3, 35 g/L NaCl + 1 g/L Na2S, and 35 g/L NaCl + 1 g/L Na2CO3 + 1 g/L Na2S, respectively, which were all chemically pure agents."

By comparison, it was found that the energy of each corrosive ion was the lowest at the bridge site of the TiO2(100) surface. If the energy of the adsorption system were more negative, its structure would be more stable [16]. Therefore, it can be determined that all of the best adsorption sites of Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, HCO3\u2212, and CO32\u2212 on the TiO2(100) surface were bridge sites. The final energy of each corrosive ion at the bridge site of the TiO2(100) surface was in the following order: S2\u2212 > HS\u2212 > Cl\u2212 > CO32\u2212 > HCO3\u2212.\n3.1.2.

Alternating-Current Impedance\nThe alternating-current impedances of TC4 alloy in NaCl, NaCl + Na2CO3, NaCl + Na2S and NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3 solutions containing saturated CO2 are shown in Figure 6. It could be seen that the radius of the capacitive arc of TC4 alloy in four corrosive solution was NaCl > NaCl + Na2CO3 > NaCl + Na2S > NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3. The radius of electrochemical Nyquist impedance spectroscopy can determine the corrosion resistance of materials; the larger the radius of the electrochemical Nyquist impedance spectrum is, the stronger the corrosion resistance of materials to local corrosion is [21]. Therefore, the corrosiveness of four corrosive solutions to TC4 alloy was NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3 > NaCl + Na2S > NaCl + Na2CO3 > NaCl.

It can be seen that Cdl (double layer capacitance) and Cc (ion adsorption double layer capacitance on the electrode surface) increased, and that both Rct (charge transfer resistance) and Rc (ion adsorption double layer resistance) decreased, concluding that the TC4 alloy has poor corrosion resistance [22].\nFigure 7. Equivalent circuit diagram.\nAs seen in Table 6, when there was only NaCl in the electrolyte, the Cc value of ion adsorption double layer capacitance on the electrode surface was 3.617 \u00d7 10\u22127 , the Cdl value of double layer capacitance was 4.925 \u00d7 10\u22126, the Rc value was 1565 \u03a9\u00b7cm2, and the Rct value was 3.135 \u00d7 104 \u03a9\u00b7cm2. With the addition of CO32\u2212 and S2\u2212, the values of Cc and Cdl increased to varying degrees, while the values of Rc and Rct decreased. When CO32\u2212 and S2\u2212 exited together, the corresponding electrochemical parameters increased.

Polarization Curve\nFigure 8 displays the polarization curves of the TC4 titanium alloy in four corrosive media (NaCl, NaCl + Na2CO3, NaCl + Na2S, NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3). Table 7 shows the fitting results. The icorr (self-corrosion current density) was 1.689 \u00d7 10\u22124 mA/cm2, and the Ecorr (self-corrosion potential) of TC4 alloy in NaCl solution containing saturated CO2 was \u2212578 mV. With the addition of CO32\u2212 or/and S2\u2212, the Ecorr of the electrode decreased, and icorr increased. The Ecorr can reflect the tendency of corrosion [23], and the icorr represents the speed of corrosion rate. The value of the icorr is larger, indicating that the corrosion rate is more rapid [24]. It could be seen that the TC4 titanium alloy showed excellent corrosion resistance in a corrosive solution containing only NaCl. In a NaCl + Na2CO3 solution, the resistance of the TC4 alloy decreased. While in the NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3 solution, the TC4 alloy suffered from the most severe corrosion. This finding is consistent with the above alternating-current impedance results and numerical simulation results. The results of the electrochemical experiments mentioned above also are in good accordance with the previous research in a 35% NaCl + 0.4% Na2S solution at 80 \u25e6C [25], as shown in Table 8.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3129 11 of 13\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 13 Figure 8 displays the polarization curves of the TC4 titanium alloy in four corrosive media (NaCl, NaCl + Na2CO3, NaCl + Na2S, NaCl + Na2S + Na2CO3).

(2) A forceful charge interaction occurred between Cl, S, O, and Ti atoms. The charge was transferred from near the Ti atoms in the TiO2(100) surface to near Cl, Ss, and O atoms in Cl\u2212, HS\u2212, S2\u2212, H O3\u2212, and CO32\u2212, respectively. Interface binding energy was primarily formed by electronic orbital hybridization between 3p5 of Cl, 3p4 of S, 2p4 of O, and 3d2 of Ti, and they were chemical adsorption. (3) Interface binding energy between five corrosive species and the TiO2(100) was as follows: S2\u2212 > CO32\u2212 > Cl\u2212 > HS\u2212 > HCO3\u2212. (4) With the addition of CO32\u2212 and S2\u2212, local corrosion of the TC4 alloy in an NaCl solution containing saturated CO2 increased, especially the synergistic effect between Cl\u2212, CO32\u2212, and/or S2\u2212, which made the corrosion electrochemical parameters of TC4 alloy change by two orders of magnitude.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3129 12 of 13\nAuthor Contributions: Designing the experiments, S.Z.; performing the experiments, K.W. and P.D.; contributing the reagents, materials, and analysis tools, K.W. and H.M.; analyzing the data, P.D. and H.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.Z.
