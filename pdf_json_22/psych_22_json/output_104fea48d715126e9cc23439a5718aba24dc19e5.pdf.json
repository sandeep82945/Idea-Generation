    "abstractText": "Background and aims: Academic burnout is harmful to college students, their institutions of learning, and society at large. While research has shown that physical exercise may be associated with reduced academic burnout, the underlying mechanisms require further exploration. This study explored the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in a sample of college students, with a focus on the serial mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience.",

While research has shown that\nphysical exercise may be\u00a0 associated with reduced academic burnout, the\nunderlying mechanisms require further exploration. This study explored the\nrelationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in a sample of\ncollege students, with a focus on the serial mediating roles of self-efficacy\nand resilience.\nMethods: This study adopted a cross-sectional survey approach among a sample of undergraduate college students in China. We\u00a0 recruited 1,270\nparticipants in the second half of the 2021\u20132022 academic year (476 men and\n794 women), all of whom completed questionnaires containing the Physical\nActivity Rating Scale, Academic Burnout Scale for College Students, 10-item\nGeneral Self-Efficacy Scale, and 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale.\nWe\u00a0then subjected the collected data to a series of statistical analyses.\nResults and conclusion: Physical exercise was significantly and negatively associated with academic burnout and its three subfactors (i.e., emotional\nexhaustion, improper behavior, and low personal achievement). Participants\nin the high physical exercise group showed lower levels of academic burnout\nthan those in the moderate and low physical exercise groups. Finally, our serial\nmediation model showed that physical exercise had a significant direct effect on academic burnout (\u03b2 = \u22120.1104, 95% CI = [\u22120.1421, \u22120.0791]) in addition to significant indirect effects on academic burnout via self-efficacy and resilience (\u03b2 = \u22120.0802, 95% CI = [\u22120.1088, \u22120.0527]); the more exercise participation, the lower the academic burnout among college students. These findings suggest\nthat physical exercise is an important interventional target when aiming to\nreduce academic burnout.\nKEYWORDS\nacademic burnout, college, physical exercise, resilience, self-efficacy\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 11 November 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.964169"

            "text": "Academic burnout is an extreme form of maladjustment to school education that negatively impacts students at all academic levels (Romano et\u00a0al., 2021). It is more specifically defined as a psychological and behavioral disorder that occurs when students are disinterested in learning or lack the motivation to learn, and may thus emerge as emotional exhaustion, disengagement from learning, and low personal achievement (Schaufeli et\u00a0al., 2002; Lian et\u00a0al., 2005). As a result, academic burnout can seriously impact academic performance, physical health, and mental health, and is even known as a precursor to depression (May et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee and Lee, 2018; Aghajani Liasi et\u00a0 al., 2021). Moreover, the condition is particularly problematic for college students, as it may eventually lead to professional burnout, which can threaten the healthy development of employment across society (Robins et\u00a0al., 2018). Taken together, these issues highlight the need for continued research aimed at preventing and alleviating academic burnout, thus avoiding damage at the individual, institutional, and societal levels.\nPrevious studies have referred to two strategic goals to prevent or alleviate academic burnout in college students. One is to develop positive individual qualities, such as optimism and grit (Vizoso-Gomez et\u00a0al., 2019; Ozhan, 2021), while the other is to enhance resources that are provided by the family, school, and society (Salmela-Aro and Upadyaya, 2017; Trigueros et\u00a0al., 2020; Ye et\u00a0 al., 2021). Although these studies widely discussed the relationships between stress, negative emotions, maladjustment, and academic burnout (Lin and Huang, 2014; Merhi et\u00a0al., 2018; Vinter et\u00a0 al., 2021), none have simultaneously examined the relationships among physical exercise, self-efficacy, resilience, and academic burnout, which are thus focal points in this study.\nThe term \u201cphysical exercise\u201d refers to physical activity that is accomplished at a certain intensity, frequency, and duration, with the aim of benefitting physical and mental health (Pan et\u00a0 al., 2021). Such engagement not only helps individuals achieve positive changes in physicality and mood, but also reduces their physiological sensitivity to stress (Sani et\u00a0al., 2016; Gerber et\u00a0 al., 2017; Mikkelsen et\u00a0 al., 2017) while increasing academic performance and facilitating social adjustment (Ji and Zheng, 2021; Wunsch et\u00a0al., 2021). As each of these gains can reduce academic burnout, some studies have directly investigated the impacts of physical exercise. For example, one study found that vocational students who completed the recommended level of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reported fewer symptoms of burnout (Gerber et\u00a0al., 2015), while another study found that only vigorous physical activity was associated with reduced burnout (Elliot et\u00a0al., 2015). There is also evidence that suggests that signs of burnout among Brazilian university students are significantly and negatively associated with physical activity (De Souza et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, there is still a lack of data on these issues in the college student population, with no such evidence in the Chinese context. As such, this study examined how physical exercise\naffected academic burnout in a sample of Chinese college students, as outlined in the following hypothesis:\nH1: Physical exercise would be\u00a0 negatively associated with academic burnout in college students.\nAlthough it is possible that physical exercise can directly reduce academic burnout, it is important to consider whether other variables mediate the process in which this occurs. Indeed, previous research has concluded that self-efficacy plays an important mediating role in the relationship between physical exercise and mental health in college students (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2017). More specifically, self-efficacy refers to an individual\u2019s perceptions or beliefs about their own ability to act appropriately when faced with difficult situations or new circumstances (Schwarzer et\u00a0al., 1997). Under the relevant theoretical framework (Bandura et\u00a0al., 1999), good physical and mental states motivate individuals to establish self-efficacy, which may therefore be\u00a0enhanced through physical exercise, given its positive effects on both physical and mental health. For example, there is evidence that college students who regularly participate in physical exercise have higher levels of self-efficacy (Joseph et\u00a0al., 2014). At the same time, self-efficacy affects individual thinking patterns and sensory responses (Bandura et\u00a0al., 1999). In this regard, students with high selfefficacy are typically more able to choose appropriate strategies in times of failure or academic stress, thus reducing the intensity of any academic burnout symptoms (Rahmati, 2015; Luthfia et\u00a0al., 2021). We\u00a0therefore posited the following hypothesis:\nH2: Self-efficacy would mediate the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in college students.\nResilience is often mentioned in conjunction with self-efficacy when discussing how individuals can improve their ability to cope with adversity. In this context, resilience refers to the characteristics, processes, and outcomes by which individuals are able to cope with adversity and eventually return to a positive state (Connor and Davidson, 2003; Fletcher and Sarkar, 2013; Robertson et\u00a0al., 2015). There is existing evidence that resilience may play an important role in limiting academic burnout, as it is negatively associated with emotional exhaustion and moderates the relationship between academic burnout and perceived mental health in college students (Garc\u00eda-Izquierdo et\u00a0 al., 2018). Meanwhile, physical exercise appears to be\u00a0a significant predictor of resilience, as it strengthens an individual\u2019s physical structure and thus provides support during psychological struggles in times of difficulty (Sahin et\u00a0 al., 2012; Se\u00e7er, and \u00c7akmak yildizhan, 2020). Based on this, we\u00a0posited the following hypothesis:\nH3: resilience would mediate the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in college students.\nAlthough the literature suggests that self-efficacy and resilience independently influence the relationship between\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nphysical exercise and academic burnout, these factors may also be\u00a0 linked together. Indeed, many studies have focused on this connection. For example, self-efficacy positively predicts resilience, it is an important characteristic in differentiating resilience levels among adolescent students (Hamill, 2003). There is also evidence that self-efficacy both promotes the development of resilience and mediates the effects of other positive factors on resilience (Sabouripour et\u00a0 al., 2021). In addition, increased resilience helps college students academic tasks, engage in professional practice, and develop well-being, thereby reducing the risk of academic burnout (Chow et\u00a0al., 2018). As such, it is reasonable to suggest that physical exercise can influence resilience by affecting self-efficacy, which then affects academic burnout, as outlined in the following hypothesis:\nH4: Self-efficacy and resilience would play serial mediating roles in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in college students.\nDemographic variables (e.g., gender, age, grade level, degree subject, academic year) have been of interest in prior research on academic burnout (Aguayo et\u00a0al., 2019). In particular, gender has received attention because there are no consistent results from the academic community regarding whether there are gender-related differences in academic burnout among college students (Onuoha and Akintola, 2016). Therefore, this study included gender variables in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout. In sum, we\u00a0established a hypothetical serial mediation model with physical exercise set as the independent variable, academic burnout set as the dependent variable, and self-efficacy/resilience set as mediating variables. Using this framework, we\u00a0investigated various effects and mechanisms in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout, thus providing a practical basis for solving relevant problems. In this regard, we\u00a0hope that our findings will motivate college campus administrators to help students adopt strategies that promote physical exercise."

In general, under China\u2019s key university system, differences have been noted in the mental health changes experienced by students attending key and regular universities (Xin et\u00a0al., 2012; Feng, 2022). We\u00a0were aware that this may lead to a difference in the prevalence of academic burnout among students at these different types of universities. To take this into account in the sample selection process, we\u00a0conducted surveys at one key university and one regular university in Chongqing, and four physical education course classes per grade in each university were randomly selected. In March 2022, when all participants\nwere in the second half of the 2021\u20132022 academic year, we\u00a0sent requests to the lecturers of the prospective participants\u2019 classes, inviting the lecturers to assist us in recruiting participants from their classes. We\u00a0sent detailed information about the purpose of the study to the lecturers who relayed this to the students in their classes.\nA total of 1,400 undergraduate students agreed to participate in our study and 1,345 questionnaires were returned, with a response rate of 96.07%. In each case, the questionnaires completed by the participants took approximately 10 min to finish. After we\u00a0excluded incomplete questionnaires and outliers, the final study included a sample of 1,270 (94.42%), 638 from key universities and 632 from regular universities (476 men and 794 women; 403 social science majors, 867 natural science majors; 338 freshmen, 333 sophomores, 308 juniors, and 291 seniors).

The score interval is from 0 to 100 points and can be\u00a0divided into three criteria to describe the different levels of physical exercise: low physical exercise \u226419 points, medium physical exercise 20\u201342 points, and high physical exercise \u226543 points (Liang, 1994). As the scale could not be\u00a0tested for consistency, we\u00a0arranged the three items at the beginning and end of each questionnaire to test for reliability, and then removed all unreliable questionnaires (e.g., those containing inconsistent information)."

In the relationships between physical exercise and the three subfactors of academic burnout, low personal achievement had the highest correlation, respectively followed by emotional exhaustion and improper behavior.

Post-hoc tests showed statistically\nsignificant differences between the groups except for the medium exercise group and the high exercise group of male students.

Thus, we\u00a0provide evidence that physical exercise has a direct and negative predictive effect on academic burnout in this context. Previous research showed that physical exercise had the potential to not only reduce stress in college students (Herbert et\u00a0 al., 2020) but also improve their cognitive abilities and academic performance (Voss et\u00a0al., 2011; Li et\u00a0al., 2017). These factors are important in addressing academic burnout and its negative impact (Lin and Huang, 2014; May et\u00a0al., 2015). Regarding the effects derived from different levels of physical exercise, our analyses showed significant differences in academic burnout levels among high, medium, and low physical exercise groups. Simultaneously, the level of academic burnout sequentially increased with decreased levels of exercise; this corresponds with the findings of previous studies (Gerber et\u00a0al., 2015; Khosravi et\u00a0al., 2020). This may be\u00a0because more physically active university students have more benefits associated with lower academic burnout, such as better sleep quality, greater selfcontrol, and lower physical vulnerability to stress (Seibert et\u00a0al., 2016; Boat and Cooper, 2019; Lee et\u00a0al., 2020; Khosravi, 2021). In addition, we\u00a0 found significant differences in the relationship between physical exercise level and academic burnout among college students of different genders. Thus, these results highlight\nthe importance of considering the volume of physical exercise and gender differences when developing physical exercise programs, wherein moderate and higher levels may more efficiently alleviate academic burnout.\nIn addition to the direct effect, we\u00a0tested for indirect effects in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout. We\u00a0thus found that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout, which supported H2. On the one hand, physical exercise helps to create positive body image for university students (Toselli and Spiga, 2017), which enhances their body satisfaction and self-efficacy (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2020). On the other hand, students with high self-efficacy tend to adopt more advantageous learning strategies and goals to improve academic performance (Alhadabi and Karpinski, 2020), which is beneficial to reducing the risk of academic burnout (Rahmati, 2015; Merhi et\u00a0al., 2018). In this regard, physical exercise can influence selfefficacy, which then influences academic burnout. Given the general lack of research in this area, our results further reinforce the verified relationship between these factors. Thus, self-efficacy works as a bridge between physical exercise and academic burnout. Campus administrators should introduce programs to help students develop self-efficacy via physical exercise to combat academic burnout more effectively.\nAccording to indirect pathway 2, in the total sample and female sample, resilience mediates the impacts of physical exercise\nFIGURE\u00a01 Model showing the mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout (Total sample). ***p\u00a0< 0.001, *p\u00a0< 0.05; significant standardized regression coefficient.\nFIGURE\u00a02 Model showing the mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout (Female sample). ***p\u00a0< 0.001, *p\u00a0< 0.05; significant standardized regression coefficient.\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\non academic burnout. Therefore, it can be\u00a0 inferred that H3 is correct. Our findings support previous research findings that physical exercise promotes resilience in college students (Rom\u00e1nMata et\u00a0al., 2020; Dunston et\u00a0al., 2022). Some researchers believe this is a result of physical exercise providing an appropriate setting for improving resilience (Xu et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, our study revealed that resilience was negatively associated with academic burnout. A previous study also found that the majority of those with higher levels of resilience showed lower levels of academic burnout, which was attributed the fact that resilience is a psychologically protective resource that allows students to resist the stress of school (Fern\u00e1ndez-Castillo and Fern\u00e1ndez-Prados, 2021). However, physical exercise in the male sample was not a significant predictor of resilience, possibly because males are more susceptible to masculinity-seeking and interpersonal relationship resolution in sports, thus affecting the resilience-promoting effect of physical exercise (Overholt and Ewert, 2015). The predictive effect of resilience on academic burnout was also not significant in the male sample, possibly because males have higher cynicism relative to females, which correlates less with resilience than emotional exhaustion and low achievement, resulting in a poor resistance of resilience to academic burnout (Isabel Rios-Risquez et\u00a0al., 2016; Garc\u00eda-Izquierdo et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, strategies to\nintervene in resilience and academic burnout through physical exercise seem to be\u00a0more applicable to female college students, compared to male college students.\nLooking at indirect pathway 3, self-efficacy and resilience play a serial mediating role in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout, which supports H4. Although there is no previous direct evidence of the relationship between physical exercise, self-efficacy, resilience, and academic burnout, some studies have confirmed the role of self-efficacy in promoting resilience (Hamill, 2003; Cassidy, 2015; Sabouripour et\u00a0al., 2021). Similarly, self-efficacy is an important personal resource for the development of resilience (Benard, 2004; Narayanan and Weng Onn, 2016). In conjunction with the above, we\u00a0believe that college students can enhance self-efficacy via physical exercise, which then promotes resilience and ultimately ease their academic burnout. In addition, given the low effect size of physical exercise on resilience found in indirect path 2, we\u00a0believe that self-efficacy functions as a bridge between physical exercise and resilience. In a word, physical exercise not only directly affects academic burnout among college students, but also indirectly through the serial-mediating effects of self-efficacy and resilience. This provides an important practical reference for solving the problem of academic burnout among college students.\nFIGURE\u00a03 Model showing the mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience in the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout (Male sample). ***p\u00a0< 0.001; significant standardized regression coefficient.\nTable\u00a04 The path and standardized indirect/direct effects of physical exercise on academic burnout in college students."

            "text": "Although our study deepens the scholarly understanding of the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in college students, there were also some limitations. First, this study did not cover important factors that influence academic burnout, such as socioeconomic status, age, and personality traits (e.g., novelty seeking). Future research should consider external environmental and individual characteristic factors to reveal a more comprehensive picture of the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout among college students. Second, the survey sample only involved students from universities in Chongqing and had a higher proportion of female students, which may reduce the generalizability and analytical efficacy of the study results. Future studies should expand the sampling scope and focus on a balanced gender ratio. Third, although we\u00a0inferred the temporal ordering of the structure presentation in the model based on the positive psychological effects of physical exercise, it is not appropriate to consider any observed association as causal, given the cross-sectional design. In addition, we\u00a0measured participants\u2019 retrospective independent variable status, which may lead to reporting bias. Future research should conduct longitudinal intervention trials to measure physical exercise and academic burnout using more objective physiological and psychological indicators and focus on the characteristics of long-term changes in the relationship between the two."

            "text": "This study demonstrates that physical exercise has a negative impact on academic burnout and its subfactors. In this study, selfefficacy and resilience played mediating roles in the effect of physical exercise on academic burnout. College students in the high physical exercise group showed lower levels of academic burnout than those in the moderate and low physical exercise groups. We\u00a0suggest that directing university students to actively engage in physical exercise for developing self-efficacy and resilience may effectively contribute to preventing academic burnout."
