1. **Investigate the effect of different polymer backbones on the performance of PIL-based membranes.** The current study used polystyrene as the polymer backbone, but other polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), and poly(vinylidene fluoride), could also be used. These different polymers would have different properties, such as hydrophobicity, flexibility, and glass transition temperature, which could affect the performance of the resulting membranes.
2. **Explore the use of PILs in other membrane applications.** The current study focused on the use of PILs in gas separation membranes, but PILs could also be used in other membrane applications, such as water purification, desalination, and pervaporation. These applications would require different membrane properties, such as water permeability, salt rejection, and organic solvent resistance.
3. **Develop new methods for the synthesis of PILs.** The current study used a simple ion exchange reaction to synthesize PILs, but other methods, such as free radical polymerization, could also be used. These different methods would produce PILs with different properties, such as molecular weight, polydispersity, and functional group distribution.
4. **Investigate the long-term stability of PIL-based membranes.** The current study did not investigate the long-term stability of PIL-based membranes, but this is an important factor for any membrane application. PILs could be susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis, oxidation, or other factors, which could affect their performance over time.
5. **Develop composite membranes with PILs and other materials.** The current study used PILs as the sole membrane material, but composite membranes with PILs and other materials, such as inorganic fillers or porous supports, could also be developed. These composite membranes could have improved properties, such as mechanical strength, thermal stability, or antifouling properties.
