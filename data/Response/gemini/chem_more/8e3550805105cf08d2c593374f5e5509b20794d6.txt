1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms of C18-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.** This could be done by studying the effects of C18 on mitochondrial membrane permeability, ATP production, and ROS generation.
2. **Determine the role of ROS and Ca2+ in C18-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.** This could be done by using ROS scavengers and Ca2+ chelators to inhibit ROS and Ca2+ accumulation, respectively, and then assessing the effects of C18 on mitochondrial function.
3. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of C18 against C. albicans infection in a mammalian model.** This could be done by using a mouse model of C. albicans infection to assess the ability of C18 to reduce fungal burden and improve survival.
4. **Investigate the potential of C18 as a novel antifungal agent.** This could be done by conducting preclinical studies to assess the safety and efficacy of C18 in animal models of candidiasis.
5. **Explore the potential of C18 to target other fungal pathogens.** This could be done by testing the antifungal activity of C18 against a variety of other fungal pathogens, such as Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Aspergillus fumigatus.
