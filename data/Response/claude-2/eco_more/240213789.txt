 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of new airline entrants and expanded route networks on price seasonality patterns in the post-pandemic period. The entry of new competitors could disrupt established seasonal pricing dynamics.

2. Analyze seasonal differences between business and leisure passenger demand using ticket data with passenger segmentation. This could provide insights into changing traveler composition and its influence on pricing. 

3. Investigate the relationship between aircraft availability, fleet utilization rates, and pricing seasonality. Aircraft shortages appear to be a key driver of post-pandemic price trends.

4. Conduct an international comparison of seasonal pricing patterns across countries and regions. This could identify geographic and cultural factors influencing seasonality.

5. Develop econometric models to forecast future airfare seasonality and test their accuracy. Effective forecasting tools would enable airlines to optimize revenue management.
