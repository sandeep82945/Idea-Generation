    "abstractText": "We analyze oligopolistic third-degree price discrimination relative to uniform pricing, when markets are always covered. Pricing equilibria are critically determined by supply-side features such as the number of \u0085rms and their marginal cost di\u00a4erences. It follows that each \u0085rm\u0092s Lerner index under uniform pricing is equal to the weighted harmonic mean of the \u0085rm\u0092s relative margins under discriminatory pricing. Uniform pricing then decreases average prices and raises consumer surplus. We provide an intriguingly simple approach to calculate the consumer surplus gain from uniform pricing only based on market data of the discriminatory equilibrium (prices and quantities). JEL-Classi\u0085cation: D43, L13, L41, K21. Keywords: Third-Degree Price Discrimination, Uniform Pricing, Harmonic Mean Formula, Covered Demand. We thank Mats K\u00f6ster for very helpful comments.

Pricing equilibria are critically determined by supply-side features such as the number of rms and their marginal cost di\u00a4erences. It follows that each rm s Lerner index under uniform pricing is equal to the weighted harmonic mean of the rm s relative margins under discriminatory pricing. Uniform pricing then decreases average prices and raises consumer surplus. We provide an intriguingly simple approach to calculate the consumer surplus gain from uniform pricing only based on market data of the discriminatory equilibrium (prices and quantities).\nJEL-Classi cation: D43, L13, L41, K21.

            "text": "Since the works of Pigou (1920) and Robinson (1933), it is a key question for economists to evaluate how third-degree price discrimination a\u00a4ects social welfare and consumer surplus. While much is known now about the e\u00a4ects of third-degree price discrimination in a monopoly, our knowledge about oligopolistic third-degree price discrimination is less clear-cut.\nA major contribution to the analysis of oligopolistic third-degree price discrimination is provided by Holmes (1989). His analysis builds on the assumption that all rms agree on where to set a relatively high and a relatively low price; following Corts (1998) we refer to this as bestresponse symmetry. Holmes starts his analysis with the simple observation that in an oligopoly a price increase by one rm drives some consumers out of the market and induces others to switch suppliers. In a monopoly only the rst e\u00a4ect can arise, while the second e\u00a4ect is unmistakably oligopolistic. Our work is greatly inspired by this critical distinction and his conjecture that\nthere is a sense in which discrimination increases average price; the increase in price in the\nstrong market above the uniform price is large relative to the decrease in the weak-market (Holmes, 1989, p. 248). Holmes explores a constant-elasticity demand function with inelastic market demand to derive a remarkable formula (no. 11, p. 248), which states that a rm s relative margin (or, Lerner index) under uniform pricing is equal to the weighted harmonic mean of the rm s relative margins under discriminatory pricing and which is reassuring for his conjecture. This formula is particularly insightful because rms equilibrium output levels do not change with the pricing regime, so that the weights can be calculated from observed market data under discrimination. Accordingly, uniform pricing reduces market power, so that rms prices are less distorted above their marginal costs if uniform prices need to be set. In Footnote 7 (p. 248) he notices that the case of an inelastic market demand function is not an interesting example for examining the e\u00a4ect of discrimination on total output. But I am focusing here on the e\u00a4ects on prices and the lesson learned is of somewhat greater generality.\nOur contribution is to show the greater generality of Holmes conjecture. In analogy to the monopoly benchmark, which exclusively highlights the demand-side ( stay home ) determinants\n1\nof the welfare e\u00a4ects of price discrimination, we analyze the oligopoly case with inelastic market demands to focus the analysis on the supply-side determinants of price discrimination and its welfare e\u00a4ects (which are driven by the switch suppliers -aspect of demand). We achieve this modeling approach with a covered demand model, which allows us to expand Holmes conjecture to the case of an asymmetric oligopoly, where rms have di\u00a4erent marginal production costs. Our analysis con rms the (weighted) harmonic mean relationship for a rm s relative margins under uniform and discriminatory pricing, which Holmes derived only for the symmetric oligopoly case.\nWe rst show that rms (bilateral) price di\u00a4erences in any market are always the same, independently of the pricing regime. Price di\u00a4erences only depend on supply-side features and are independent of the parameters of the demands. It then follows that rms output levels are the same under discriminatory and uniform pricing in all markets. As a consequence of this, price discrimination does not a\u00a4ect social welfare. Nevertheless, rms demands and market shares across markets may di\u00a4er depending on competitive intensities which in turn depend on demand parameters. Our second nding is based on this result and it comes in two practically important formulas: Firstly, we show that each rm s aggregate price elasticity under uniform pricing is the weighted arithmetic mean of the rm s market-speci c price elasticities under discriminatory pricing, where the weights are given by the rm s output in market j relative to its total output. Secondly, the relative margin (or, Lerner index) under uniform pricing is given by the weighted harmonic mean of the rm s relative margins (or, Lerner indices) under discriminatory pricing, where the weights are given again by the rm s output in market j relative to its total output.\nThe harmonic mean logic implies that the relative margin under uniform pricing is always strictly lower than the weighted arithmetic mean of the relative margins under discriminatory pricing; in other words, market power is reduced. This translates into the aggregate Lerner index being smaller under uniform than under discriminatory pricing. There is, unambiguously, a consumer surplus loss from price discrimination, which can be easily calculated only based on observables under discriminatory pricing. Simply from market prices and rms outputs we can recover consumer surplus under uniform pricing.\nDue to best-response symmetry whereby rms agree in which market segment to set the\n2\nhigher and where the lower prices rms have clear incentives to collectively achieve the price discrimination outcome. For instance, rms may want to segment markets and prevent arbitrage to make price discrimination possible. From the rms perspective, the discriminatory equilibrium represents a Pareto-improvement vis-\u00e0-vis the equilibrium under uniform pricing.\nOur demand system is closely related to the one proposed by Somaini and Einav (2013), who derived it from generalizing the Hotelling duopoly model to the case of m 2 rms. Demand is always covered, all rms are directly linked and compete this way symmetrically with each other. Again, by this we suppress the question how demand characteristics (that induce a stay home ) a\u00a4ect the welfare-e\u00a4ects of third-degree price discrimination, which the literature on monopolistic third-degree price discrimination has focused on. While our approach is theoretically justi ed, we also do not regard it as implausible: when for a particular product the relevant market is considered, all products consumers can substitute to are already included, so that the assumption that market demand is fully price inelastic is plausible under this practice. And indeed, antitrust authorities typically de ne the market to be considered as the relevant market as delineated by the SSNIP ( Small but Signi cant and Non-transitory Increase in Price ) test that comprises all substitutes to a particular product up to a certain threshold. Importantly, even if with covered demand price discrimination has no e\u00a4ect on social welfare, it a\u00a4ects consumer surplus, which represents the objective of most antitrust authorities (see, e.g., Davies and Lions, 2007, or Whinston, 2007). Finally, our demand system allows for much\nexibility: demand characteristics a\u00a4ect the size of the di\u00a4erent markets, the price levels, and rm s market shares that can vary across markets.\nIn an extension, we show that our insights also hold if price discrimination is constrained by arbitrage. Practically, unconstrained price discrimination can only become e\u00a4ective if arbitrageurs cannot resell goods sourced in the low-price region to the high-price region (see Armstrong, 2008). Thus, when policy makers wish to discourage price discrimination, they will often take the indirect route of ensuring that consumer arbitrage is as easy as possible, for instance by integrating markets (see Armstrong, 2008). In the EU, the creation of a Single Market is an explicit policy objective. Accordingly, the European Union has passed the geo-blocking directive (EU Regulation 2018/302), which bans price discrimination of online stores vis-\u00e0-vis\n3\nnal consumers on the grounds of their geographic (i.e., country) location since 2018. This recent geo-blocking directive is tting this strategy as it tries to enhance cross-border arbitrage by consumers. If markets are perfectly integrated in the sense that consumers can buy a certain good in any other country at the terms posted in that country, then any international price discrimination is doomed to fail, so that the products of any rm i must be traded at the same price in the integrated market area. By our analysis, such market integration which makes arbitrage as easy as possible and e\u00a4ectively yields uniform pricing is desirable from a consumer point of view."

            "text": "The related literature can be divided into the literature on monopolistic and oligopolistic thirddegree price discrimination. The literature on monopolistic third-degree price discrimination has focused on the demand conditions which determine the welfare e\u00a4ects of price discrimination. This welfare e\u00a4ect results from a trade-o\u00a4 between the misallocation e\u00a4ect and the output e\u00a4ect relative to the uniform pricing rule. While Pigou considered the linear (downward sloping) demand case, Robinson (1933) and Schmalensee (1981), and more recently Aguirre, Cowan and Vickers (2010) derived complementary results for convex and concave demands. Varian (1985) extends Schmalensee (1981) by allowing for imperfect arbitrage when marginal costs are constant or increasing, and Schwartz (1990) extends Varian (1985) for the case where marginal costs are decreasing. Cowan (2012, 2016) focuses on the social welfare and consumer surplus e\u00a4ects of monopolistic third-degree price discrimination depending on market demands. He identi es, beside other things, reasonable demand conditions such that price discrimination increases consumer surplus. The main insight from this literature is that market demand curvatures are critical for re-solving the trade-o\u00a4 of the misallocation e\u00a4ect and the output e\u00a4ect associated with price discrimination.\nThe literature on oligopolistic third-degree price discrimination is relatively sparse. It has to be divided into approaches that build on best-response symmetry where rms agree on where to set higher prices and those that build on best-response asymmetry where rms disagree on where to set higher prices. This distinction builds on Robinson s (1933) insight that third-degree\n4\nprice discrimination leads to a higher price in one market (the strong market) and to a lower price in the other market (the weak market) when compared with a uniform price a monopolist would charge based on the aggregated demand. Under best-response asymmetry, rms disagree where to set higher and where to set lower prices; in this case, rms nd themselves in a prisoners dilemma as price discrimination intensi es competition (see, e.g., Armstrong 2008). Firms then have a collective incentive to prevent price discrimination (see, e.g., Stole 2007). The literature on best-response symmetry started out with Holmes (1989), who mainly showed that the output e\u00a4ect of third degree price discrimination is the sum of Schmalensee s (1981) adjusted concavity condition (which mirrors the market demand e\u00a4ect) and the elasticity-ratio condition (which picks up the oligopolistic competition e\u00a4ect). Subsequent work on oligopolistic third-degree price discrimination with symmetric rms has been further studied in Armstrong and Vickers (2001), Weyl and Fabinger (2013), Adachi and Fabinger (2020) and Miklos-Thal and Sha\u00a4er (forthcoming). Armstrong and Vickers (2001), in particular, show that for su\u00a2 ciently competitive markets, price discrimination increases pro ts and reduces welfare. Building on earlier work for the monopolistic case (Chen and Schwartz, 2015), Chen et al. (2019) analyze di\u00a4erential pricing in oligopolies where market-delivery costs di\u00a4er across markets. With such market-speci c delivery costs, uniform pricing necessarily induces an allocative ine\u00a2 ciency as cost di\u00a4erences cannot be re ected in prices; our main insights extend to the case of marketdelivery costs (see Appendix B). Adachi and Fabinger (2020) extend Aguirre, Cowan, and Vickers (2010) to the oligopoly case. They focus on the symmetric rms case, but allow for di\u00a4erential pricing asymmetries as well as arbitrage asymmetries among rms. They do not analyze the asymmetric oligopoly problem where rms have di\u00a4erent marginal production costs.\nWe proceed as follows. In Section 2 we analyze the covered market model. Section 3 discusses\nour extension on arbitrage costs. Finally, Section 4 concludes."

            "text": "We build on the (linear-) covered demand model (in short: LCD-model), which is closely related to the generalized Hotelling model proposed by Somaini and Einav (2013). Assume i = 1; :::;m (m > 1) rms sell their products in j = 1; :::; n (n > 1) markets. Each rm produces a single\n5\nproduct and rm i s marginal production cost is ci 0.\nMarket demands are independent and completely inelastic. The demand of rm i in market j is a linear function of its own price and all other rms prices in that market. We assume symmetry in all substitutability relations. In addition, all products are directly linked, so that consumers as a whole can substitute away to all other products. Taken together, we obtain a (linear-) covered demand model LCD := fDji g j=1;:::;m i=1;:::;n , where the demand of rm i in market j is given by\nDji (p j 1; :::; p j m) = a j + bj X i0 6=i (pji0 p j i ), with a j > 0 and bj > 0. (1)\nThe LCD-model nests the Hotelling duopoly model and the Salop-circle model for two and three rms. It does not nest the Salop model for four and more rms. To understand the di\u00a4erence, take m = 4. In the Salop model each rm only competes directly with its two neighbors and not with the remaining competitor. This kind of asymmetry of the Salop model is eliminated in our model, where all rms compete directly. In the LCD-model the four rm case can be thought of represented by six equally long lines such that all rms are bilaterally connected with each other, that is, by a tetrahedron. We formally derive this model in Appendix A.\nThis LCD-model has several convenient properties that we list in the following.\n(A1) @D j i\n@pji = (m 1)bj for all i and j.\n(A2) Any rm i s demand in market j is the same at two di\u00a4erent price vectors (pj1; :::; p j m) and (bpj1; :::; bpjm) if pji0 pji = bpji0 bpji for all i and i0. (A3) P iD j i (p1; :::; pm) = ma j .\n(A4) Dji D j i0 = b jm(pji0 p j i ).\nAs a consequence of these properties, rm i s demand is linear in its price (A1), its demand in a market is just determined by the di\u00a4erences in prices that the rms charge in that market (A2), aggregate demand is inelastic (A3), and the demand di\u00a4erences between two rms are pinned down by the di\u00a4erence in prices these two rms set and therefore independent from other prices charged (A4).\n6\nThroughout the paper we maintain the assumption that the discriminatory pricing equilibrium, fpjig j=1;:::;n i=1;:::;m, and the uniform pricing equilibrium, fbpigi=1;:::;m, are unique and interior. Obviously, there exists a unique interior equilibrium both under discriminatory and under uniform pricing if costs are not too heterogenous (see also Somaini and Einav, 2013).\nIn the following proposition, we compare the Nash equilibrium when rms simultaneously charge uniform prices across markets and when rms engage in third-degree price discrimination, thereby charging di\u00a4erent prices in the markets.\nProposition 1. Assume an LCD-model and constant marginal production costs ci 0 for all i = 1; :::;m. Then, the following properties are ful lled: i) All bilateral price di\u00a4erences are the same under discriminatory and uniform pricing, such that pji0 p j i = bpi0 bpi = m 12m 1(ci0 ci) holds for all i, i0 and j. ii) All rms output levels in all markets are the same in the discriminatory and the uniform pricing equilibrium; i.e., Dji (p j 1; :::; p j m) = D j i (bp1; :::; bpm) = aj + bj m 12m 1 Pi0 6=i(ci0 ci) for all i and j.\nProof. Under discriminatory pricing each rm i maximizes\nmax p1i ;:::;p n i 0 i = nX j=1 Dji (p j 1; :::; p j m)(p j i ci).\nThe unique and interior Nash equilibrium prices fpjig j=1;:::;n i=1;:::;m ful ll\n@Dji @pji (pji ci) +D j i = 0 for all i and all j. (2)\nFix some j and take two rms i 6= i0. The equilibrium price di\u00a4erence pji0 p j i follows from subtracting the rst-order conditions @ i0 @pj\ni0 = 0 and @ i @pji = 0, which gives\n@Dji0\n@pji0 (pji0 ci0) @Dji @pji (pji ci) +D j i0 D j i = 0.\nUsing (A1) and (A4) we get\n(m 1)bj(pji0 p j i ) b jm(pji0 p j i ) = (m 1)b j(ci0 ci) or\npji0 p j i = m 1 2m 1(ci 0 ci). (3)\n7\nUnder uniform pricing each rm i maximizes\nmax pi 0 i = nX j=1 Dji (p1; :::; pm)(pi ci).\nThe unique and interior Nash equilibrium prices fbpigi=1;:::;m ful ll nX j=1 \" @Dji @pi (bpi ci) +Dji # = 0 for all i. (4) Take two rms i 6= i0. The equilibrium price di\u00a4erence bpi0 bpi follows from subtracting the rst-order conditions @ i0@pi0 = 0 and @ i @pi = 0, which gives\nnX j=1 @Dji @pi (bpi0 ci0) nX j=1 @Dji @pi (bpi ci) + nX j=1 Dji0 nX j=1 Dji = 0.\nUsing (A1) and (A4) we get\n(m 1) nX j=1 bj(bpi0 bpi) m(bpi0 bpi) nX j=1 bj = (m 1) nX j=1 bj(ci0 ci) or\nbpi0 bpi = m 1 2m 1(ci 0 ci). (5)\nFrom (3) it follows that the price di\u00a4erence between two rms i and i0 is the same in all markets j under discrimination. Comparison with (5) shows that the price di\u00a4erence under uniform pricing yields exactly the same di\u00a4erence. Finally, part ii) of the proposition follows from substituting (3) for all i0 6= i into (1). Q.E.D.\nPrice competition yields the same price di\u00a4erences under discriminatory and uniform pricing (part i) of Proposition1). Consequently, rms output levels in any market j are independent of the pricing regime (part ii) of Proposition 1).1 In addition, when the number of rms increases, price di\u00a4erences approach marginal cost di\u00a4erences from below.2 The underlying demand system\n1 In the following, we drop the arguments of Dji , which from now on stands for the equilibrium values\nDji (p j 1; :::; p j m) or D j i (bp1; :::; bpm).\n2Under both pricing regimes, the price di\u00a4erence is equal to the marginal cost di\u00a4erence times the term m 1 2m 1 , which increases monotonically in m over the interval [1=3; 1). In the limiting case of m ! 1 it approaches one. Thus, when the number of rms, m, increases, then bilateral price di\u00a4erences increase and approach marginal cost di\u00a4erences in the limit.\n8\nensures that price di\u00a4erences are fully driven by supply side features; namely, marginal cost asymmetries and the number of rms m.\nInterestingly, even though price di\u00a4erences between the rms are always the same under discriminatory pricing in every market j, any rm i s market shares may di\u00a4er across di\u00a4erent markets. The market share of rm i in market j is given by\nsji := DjiPm i=1D j i = 1 m 241 + bj aj m 1 2m 1 X i0 6=i (ci0 ci) 35 , where the last equality follows from (A3) and from part iii) of Proposition 1. Note also thatP i0 6=i(ci0 ci) = m(ce ci), with ce := Pm i=1 ci=m. Suppose b j=aj > bj 0 =aj 0 holds. Then, sji > s j0 i (s j i < s j0 i ) follows if and only if ci < c e (ci > ce). A rm with below-average marginal cost, therefore, gets a larger market share in market j than in j0, when the competitive intensity (as measured by bj=aj) increases.3 This result also mirrors A4, which states that the demand di\u00a4erence between two rms gets larger when the parameter bj increases.\nProposition 1 implies that the di\u00a4erence of consumer surplus under uniform and discriminatory pricing, dCS CS, which must be equal to the reversed di\u00a4erence of total pro ts,P i i P i b i, can be derived directly from comparing the uniform and the discriminatory prices.\nCorollary 1. The di\u00a4erence of consumer surplus and the di\u00a4erence of total pro ts under uniform and discriminatory pricing are given by\ndCS CS = mX i=1 i mX i=1 b i = mX i=1 nX j=1\n(pji bpi)Dji . Based on Proposition 1, we can easily calculate the Nash equilibrium prices under both pricing regimes. In the discriminatory regime, rm i s rst-order condition in market j is given by (2). Solving for pji we get\npji = ci Dji @Dji @pji = ci + aj (m 1)bj +\n1\n2m 1 X i0 6=i (ci0 ci). (6)\n3 In Appendix A, we show how aj and bj can be derived from a generalized Hotelling model. In particular, bj=aj increases when the transportation costs parameter decreases (tj) or the length of the Hotelling line (Lj) shortens. In Appendix A, we also consider a scenario with additional loyal consumers, in which case bj=aj decreases when the share of loyal consumers increases.\n9\nSimilarly, for the uniform pricing regime, the Nash equilibrium price of rm i can be obtained from rm i s rst-order condition (4). Solving for bpi we get bpi = ci Pnj=1DjiPn\nj=1 @Dji @pi\n= ci +\nPn j=1 h aj + bj m 1 2m 1 P i0 6=i(ci0 ci) i (m 1) Pn j=1 b j . (7)\nWe next examine how the discriminatory and uniform pricing equilibrium are related. De ne\nrm i s equilibrium price elasticity in market j under discriminatory pricing by\nE j i := E j i (p j 1; :::; p j m) := @Dji @pji pji Dji\n(8)\nand rm i s aggregate equilibrium price elasticity under uniform pricing by\nbEi := Ei(bp1; :::; bpm) := Pnj=1 @D j i @pi bpiPn\nj=1D j i\n: (9)\nFirm i s Lerner index under discriminatory pricing is equal to the weighted arithmetic mean of it s market-speci c Lerner indices, L j i :=\npji ci pji , where the weights are given by rm i s output\nin market j, Dji , relative to its total output, Pn j=1D j i ; i.e.,\nLi := nX j=1 \" DjiPn j=1D j i L j i # .\nDe ne the aggregate Lerner index under discriminatory pricing by L := P i siLi, where si :=P\nj D j iP\nj P iD j i stands for rm i s overall market share. In case of uniform pricing, bLi := bpi cibpi andbL := Pi sibLi stand for rm i s Lerner index and for the aggregate Lerner index, respectively. The following proposition then follows.\nProposition 2. Assume an LCD-model. The comparison of the discriminatory and the uniform pricing equilibrium gives the following relations: i) Firm i s aggregate equilibrium price elasticity under uniform pricing is given by the weighted Arithmetic Mean Formula:\nbEi = nX j=1 \" DjiPn j=1D j i E j i # holds for all i.\n10\nii) Firm i s Lerner index under uniform pricing is given by the weighted Harmonic Mean\nFormula: bLi = 1Pn j=1\nDjiPn j=1D j i 1 L j i holds for all i. iii) If rms are asymmetric (i.e., ci 6= c0i with i 6= i0 for all i) and if all rms marginal costs are strictly positive, then all rm-level Lerner indices and the aggregate Lerner index are strictly smaller under uniform pricing than under discriminatory pricing; i.e., bLi < Li holds for all i and bL < L. iv) If rms are asymmetric (i.e., ci 6= c0i with i 6= i0 for all i) and if all rms marginal costs are strictly positive, then rm i s uniform price is strictly smaller than the weighted arithmetic mean of its discriminatory prices; i.e.\nbpi < nX j=1 DjiPn j=1D j i pji holds for all i.\nProof. Assume discriminatory pricing. Summing up rm i s rst-order conditions over all markets j gives nX j=1 \" @Dji @pji (pji ci) # + nX j=1 Dji = 0. Under uniform pricing, rm i s rst-order condition is given (4). From Proposition 1 it follows that rm i s equilibrium demand is the same in every market under both pricing regimes, which implies nX j=1 Dji (p j 1; :::; p j m) = nX j=1\nDji (bp1; :::; bpm). It thus follows that\nnX j=1 @Dji @pi (bpi ci) = nX j=1 \" @Dji @pji (pji ci) # .\nSimplifying and expanding both sides we getPn j=1\n@Dji @pi bpiPn\nj=1D j i 0@ nX j=1 Dji 1A = nX j=1 \" @Dji @pji pji Dji Dji # .\n11\nUsing (8) and (9) we get\nbEi nX j=1 Dji = nX j=1 h E j iD j i i or\nbEi = nX j=1 \" DjiPn j=1D j i E j i # . (10)\nThe equilibrium aggregate demand elasticity under uniform pricing of rm i is equal to the weighted arithmetic mean of rm i s demand elasticities under discriminatory pricing. The weight of rm i s demand elasticity in market j is given by the share of rm i s total output sold in market j. This gives part i).\nNext, we can re-write rm i s rst-order condition under uniform pricing (see (4)) as\nbpi cibpi = 1bEi . Likewise, under discriminatory pricing we can re-write each of rm i s rst-order conditions (see (2)) as pji ci pji = 1 E j i . Taken together and using (10) we get\nbpi cibpi = 1Pn j=1\nDjiPn j=1D j i E j i = 1Pn j=1 \" DjiPn j=1D j i pji ci pji\n1# . (11)\nUsing the de nitions of bLi and Lji , we get the formula stated in part ii) of the proposition. By Jensen s inequality,4 it must be that\nnX j=1 \" DjiPn j=1D j i 1 L j i # > 1Pn j=1\nDjiPn j=1D j i L j i , which implies bLi < Li and also bL < L, because si is independent of the pricing regime. This proves part iii) of the proposition. Thus, part iii) follows from part ii).\n4Jensen s inequality implies that for any positive random variable X with strictly positive expected value E(X)\nthe inequality E 1 X > 1 E(X) holds.\n12\nNext we show that part iv) follows from part iii) (namely, bLi < Li) and is, therefore, also a consequence of the harmonic mean formula. Note rst that we can re-write Li as\nLi = 1 ci nX j=1 DjiPn j=1D j i 1 pji .\nThus, bLi < Li is equivalent to bpi cibpi < 1 ci nX j=1 DjiPn j=1D j i 1 pji or\n1bpi > nX j=1 DjiPn j=1D j i 1 pji . (12)\nBy Jensen s Inequality, the right-hand side of (12) is strictly larger than the inverse of the weighted arithmetic mean of the discriminatory prices, so that\n1bpi > 1Pn j=1\nDjiPn j=1D j i pji\nfollows, from which we directly get the inequality stated in part iv) of the proposition. Q.E.D.\nProposition 2 generalizes Holmes (1989) conjecture that average prices increase under discriminatory prices when compared with uniform pricing to an asymmetric oligopoly. Holmes assumed symmetric rms and a constant elasticity demand at the rm level with inelastic market demand to show his conjecture. Proposition 2 shows that his conjecture is also valid when rms are asymmetric and the underlying demand system ensures that market demands are inelastic.\nAccording to part i) of Proposition 2, each rm s aggregate equilibrium elasticity under uniform pricing is the weighted arithmetic mean of a rm s equilibrium elasticities under discriminatory pricing, which follows from the fact that equilibrium quantities do not change with the pricing regime (Proposition 1). Part ii) shows that the Lerner index of any rm i under uniform pricing is the weighted harmonic mean of its market-speci c Lerner indices under discriminatory pricing, where the weights are given by rm i s output in market j, relative to its total output. Part iii) states that all rms Lerner indices and the aggregate Lerner index are lower under uniform pricing than under discriminatory pricing. This follows directly from part ii), because the (weighted) harmonic mean is always lower than the (weighted) arithmetic mean\n13\n(unless all relative margins are equal). This relation gives a clear-cut assessment of the overall e\u00a4ect of uniform pricing on market power. Uniform pricing unambiguously constraints rms market power, so that rms ability to raise prices above marginal costs is smaller than under discriminatory pricing.\nThe harmonic mean formula implies that all rms uniform prices are strictly smaller than the weighted arithmetic mean of their discriminatory prices (part iv) of Proposition 4). Using Corollary 1, we then know for sure that consumer surplus must be strictly larger under uniform pricing than under discriminatory pricing. This follows from noticing that\ndCS CS = mX i=1 nX j=1 (pji bpi)Dji = mX i=1 24 nX j=1 Dji 0@ nX j=1 DjiPn j=1D j i pji ! bpi 1A35 > 0, where the inequality follows from part iv) of Proposition 2. As all rms realize lower relative margins under uniform pricing according to the harmonic mean formula, it must be true that prices decrease on average which must increase consumer surplus and reduce total producer surplus accordingly. This is intuitive, as all output levels do not change under both pricing regimes.\nWe, nally, state our central result that the consumer surplus gain from non-discriminatory prices can be calculated only based on market data under discriminatory pricing (i.e., prices and quantities).\nCorollary 2. Each rm s price under uniform pricing as well as the consumer surplus gain from uniform pricing can be calculated only based on market data under discriminatory pricing. The consumer surplus gain is given by\ndCS CS = 1 m 1 mX i=1 0B@ nX j=1 Dji 2 bj\nPn j=1D j i\n2P j b j 1CA , where bj can be determined from observables by (A3). Proof. See Appendix C.\nConsumers as a whole are always better o\u00a4 when rms must charge a uniform price across markets. Correspondingly, every rm realizes a higher pro t when all rms engage in price discrimination. From the rms perspective, the discriminatory equilibrium Pareto-dominates\n14\nthe uniform pricing equilibrium. It follows that rms jointly have an incentive to coordinate market segmentation (e.g., by geo-blocking or, more generally, by restricting buyer arbitrage between markets). Thus, our results appear to be relevant for price discrimination along national markets (as in the EU)."

The following proposition states the main features of the arbitrage-constrained third-degree price discrimination equilibrium. Proposition 3. Assume an LSC-model with n;m = 2. Assume p1i > bpi > p2i . Suppose the arbitrage constraint is binding for both rms; i.e., p1i p2i r for i = 1; 2.

All price di\u00a4erences pji0 p j i and each rm s output in any\nmarket remains the same as under unconstrained discrimination or uniform pricing. Proof. Each rm i = 1; 2 maximizes its pro t i = P2 j=1 h Dji (p j i (r) ci) i subject to p1i (r) p2i (r) r for i = 1; 2.

            "text": "The LCD-model can be derived from a horizontal product di\u00a4erentiation model in the spirit of the Hotelling duopoly model as suggested by Somaini and Einav (2013). There are i = 1; :::;m\nrms each producing a horizontally di\u00a4erentiated product. The rms sell their goods in j =\n1; :::; n independent markets. In each market j, there are lm := m(m 1)\n2 Hotelling lines, such that\nall rms are directly linked with each other. The length of each line in market j is Lj . As in the Hotelling duopoly model, two rms i and i0, with i 6= i0 are always located at the end points of a line. Let there be a total mass of consumers of M j in market j, which is uniformly distributed over all lines. Thus, consumers are distributed with constant density f j :=Mj=(lmLj) over each line of length Lj . Every consumer is distributed to one of the lm lines and is identi ed by its address x 2 [0; Lj ] on this line. All consumer have unit demands. A consumer x, located on a line connecting rms i and i0, obtains utility of U ji (x) = v j pji tj jxi xj from consuming product i at price pi and incurring transportation costs tj > 0 per unit of distance, where xi stands for rm i s location on the line. Take the line between the rms i and i0, with i 6= i0. Firm i s demand on the respective line is determined by the location of the indi\u00a4erent consumer x0 which follows from\nU ji (x 0) = vj pji t jx0 = vj pji0 t j Lj x0 = U ji0(x 0),\nwhere we assumed that rm i is located at x = 0 and rm i0 is located at x = Lj . Solving for x0 we get the indi\u00a4erent consumer and thus rm i s demand on the line connecting rms i and i0:\nDjii0(p j i ; p j i0) := x\n0f j = 1\n2\nLj +\n1 tj pji0 p j i\n2M j m(m 1)Lj .\nThe total demand of rm i in market j is then given by summing the line-demands, Djii0(p j i ; p j i0), over all i0 6= i, which gives\nDji (p j 1; :::; p j n) =\nM j\nm +\nM j m(m 1)Ljtj X i0 6=i pji0 p j i .\nThus, overall demand of rm i in market j follows from (1), with aj = M j m and b j = M j m(m 1)Ljtj . 5\n5We assumed that the prices are such that consumers are willing to buy at the posted prices; i.e., their utilities\nfrom buying are larger than their reservation utilities.\n19\nWe nally note that the LCD-model can take care of loyal consumers, who always buy from one of the rms, if the price does not exceed their reservation prices. Suppose the mass of loyal consumers is Kj in market j, so that the total mass of consumers in market j becomes M j + Kj . The mass of loyal consumers is equally distributed among the rms, so that every\nrm serves a mass of Kj=m of loyal consumers. Assume that a rm never wants to serve only its loyal consumers and that the loyals reservation price is large enough, so that they are willing to buy at the price the indi\u00a4erent consumers pay (for instance, it is vj). In this scenario, rm i s demand is given by\nDji (p j 1; :::; p j n) =\nM j +Kj\nm +\nM j m(m 1)Ljtj X i0 6=i pji0 p j i ,\nso that the demand of rm i in market j follows from (1), with aj = M j+Kj m and b j = M j m(m 1)Ljtj ."

In this case rm i s marginal cost of selling products in market j is given by ci+cj . Clearly, this does not a\u00a4ect the price di\u00a4erences in any market, so that all results of Proposition 1 remain valid. However, all equilibrium prices (6) and (7) as well as the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean formulas of Proposition 2 also apply, but then at di\u00a4erent marginal cost levels ci + cj instead of ci."

Under discriminatory pricing rm i s pro t is\ni = nX j=1 Dji (p j i ci).\nUsing the rst-order conditions (2), we can re-write the pro t as\ni = nX j=1\nDji 2 (m 1)bj .

The reduction in rms pro ts due to uniform pricing instead of discriminatory pricing is equal to the consumer surplus gain; i.e.,\ndCS CS = mX i=1 b i mX i=1 i\n! .
