1. **Investigate the association between the number of medications and caregiver difficulty in medication management tasks.** This study found that more medication management tasks were significantly related to caregiver difficulty, but it did not examine the relationship between the number of medications and caregiver difficulty. Future research could explore this relationship to determine if the number of medications is a significant predictor of caregiver difficulty.


2. **Examine the relationship between caregiver education and task difficulty longitudinally.** This study found that caregivers with higher levels of education were more likely to report difficulty in medication management tasks, but it did not examine this relationship longitudinally. Future research could follow caregivers over time to determine if the relationship between caregiver education and task difficulty changes over time.


3. **Explore the relative difficulty of different medication management tasks.** This study measured the difficulty of keeping track of medications and giving shots using the same item, but it is possible that these two tasks are not equally difficult. Future research could use a more nuanced approach to measuring the difficulty of different medication management tasks to determine which tasks are most difficult for caregivers.


4. **Identify the factors that contribute to caregiver difficulty in medication management tasks.** This study identified several factors that were associated with caregiver difficulty, but it did not explore the factors that contribute to this difficulty. Future research could use qualitative methods to explore the experiences of caregivers who have difficulty with medication management tasks to identify the factors that contribute to this difficulty.


5. **Develop and evaluate interventions to support caregivers in performing medication management tasks.** This study found that caregivers need support in performing medication management tasks, but it did not evaluate any interventions to support caregivers. Future research could develop and evaluate interventions to support caregivers in performing medication management tasks, such as providing training, resources, or support groups.
