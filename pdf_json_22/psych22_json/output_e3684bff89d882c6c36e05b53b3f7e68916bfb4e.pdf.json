    "abstractText": "The number of evidence-based treatments for child psychiatry is growing.1,2 There has been a dramatic rise in the use of psychiatric drugs in children over the past four decades.3\u20135 Unfortunately, studies have shown a sceptical view and stigma among parents and caregivers of psychiatric patients on the use of psychotropic medications for their children.6,7 Therefore, most families prefer psychotherapy over drugs, even when psychopharmacological agents are deemed crucial.8,9 Earlier studies suggest that parents are reluctant to start their children on psychotropic medications; this attitude is due to concerns about severe and harmful side-effects, leading to decreasing or stopping the medication earlier than recommended.10 In addition, studies have identified existing racial/ethnic disparities among parents agreeing to prescribe psychotropic medications for their children. For example in the USA, white children are more likely to receive psychotropic drugs than Black and Latino children.11,12 However, the view of and attitude towards the use of psychotropic medications in children in Oman have never been explored. Therefore, understanding the cultural context and establishing relationships between mental healthcare providers and parents may offer the best strategies for reducing the negative parental perceptions related to prescribing psychotropic medications for their children. The current study aimed to explore and understand the opinions and attitudes of Omani parents towards prescribing psychotropic medications to their children with mental disorders. It is hoped that abstract: Objectives: This study aimed to investigate parental attitude towards psychotropic drugs\u2019 use for children\u2019s mental disorders. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021 at the Department of Behavioural Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. A questionnaire was used to determine parents\u2019 opinions and attitudes about use of psychotropic medications on their children and, in a small proportion, other caregivers if the child attended with them. Risk factors associated with parents who preferred to consult a folk healer (FH) for children with mental disorders were identified by the logistic regression model. Results: A total of 299 parents participating in the study (response rate: 95.2%). Most (n = 244, 81.6%) agreed to give their child psychotropic medications if necessary, but 25.4% (n = 76) would consult an FH before a psychiatrist. Married parents were 14.5 times (P = 0.011) more likely than separated or divorced parents to consult an FH. Caregivers with a monthly income below 500 OMR and between 500 and 1,000 OMR were 2.5 (P = 0.016) and 3.2 times (P <0.001), respectively, more likely than those with more than 1,000 OMR to consult an FH. Parents who disagreed with giving their children psychotropic medications were 3.8 times (P <0.001) more likely to consult an FH than parents who agreed to give them if necessary. Conclusion: Most parents agreed to give their children psychotropic medications if necessary. However, a proportion of parents and caregivers preferred to consult an FH before accessing mental health services.",

It is hoped that\nabstract: Objectives: This study aimed to investigate parental attitude towards psychotropic drugs\u2019 use for children\u2019s mental disorders. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021 at the Department of Behavioural Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. A questionnaire was used to determine parents\u2019 opinions and attitudes about use of psychotropic medications on their children and, in a small proportion, other caregivers if the child attended with them. Risk factors associated with parents who preferred to consult a folk healer (FH) for children with mental disorders were identified by the logistic regression model. Results: A total of 299 parents participating in the study (response rate: 95.2%). Most (n = 244, 81.6%) agreed to give their child psychotropic medications if necessary, but 25.4% (n = 76) would consult an FH before a psychiatrist. Married parents were 14.5 times (P = 0.011) more likely than separated or divorced parents to consult an FH. Caregivers with a monthly income below 500 OMR and between 500 and 1,000 OMR were 2.5 (P = 0.016) and 3.2 times (P <0.001), respectively, more likely than those with more than 1,000 OMR to consult an FH. Parents who disagreed with giving their children psychotropic medications were 3.8 times (P <0.001) more likely to consult an FH than parents who agreed to give them if necessary. Conclusion: Most parents agreed to give their children psychotropic medications if necessary. However, a proportion of parents and caregivers preferred to consult an FH before accessing mental health services.\nKeywords: Attitude; Child; Parents; Psychotropic Drugs; Oman.\nAdvances in Knowledge - Most parents agreed to give their child psychotropic medications if necessary. - Married parents and those in a lower income bracket were more likely to seek advice from a folk healer before accessing mental health\nservices.\nApplications to Patient Care - The results of this study and its implications will help better understand parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 attitudes towards using psychotropic\nmedications in children. - The feedback will help in the development of parent support groups to further discuss concerns and improve healthcare services; this\nClinical and Basic Research | 191\npaediatric psychiatrists will alleviate parental concerns regarding the use of psychotropic medications in their children and effectively reduce parental stigma regarding mental health."

All patients aged younger than 18 years and attending their regular appointment at the child and adolescent clinic during the study period were eligible to be included in the study; this was a total of 450. Parents or caregivers of patients older than 18 years of age and those of children below 18 who did not give consent were excluded from the study.\nData were collected in the child psychiatry outpatient clinic at SQUH while patients were waiting for their appointment. All parents of attendees of the child psychiatry outpatient services at SQUH during the study period were included in the study. The twopart questionnaire was offered in Arabic, the first language of most participants, as well as English. The first part collected sociodemographic and clinical factors including age, gender and the diagnosis of the child (neurodevelopment disorder, mood disorder, psychotic disorder and others [epilepsy, genetic syndromes, metabolic syndromes]), place of residence (urban, rural), age of parents, marital status (married, divorced and separated), educational level of parents, socioeconomic status (family monthly income) and occupation. The second part of the questionnaire focussed on parents\u2019 opinions, knowledge and attitudes about children\u2019s psychotropic medications. Anonymised data were saved on a password-protected electronic database and securely destroyed after use following the code of conduct for handling research data (UKRIO, 2009). Signed consent forms were stored separately in a locked compartment.\nThe required sample size was calculated using an online EPITOOLS software (Epitools epidimiological calculator, Ausvet, Australia) allowing with an accepted 21.5% prevalence rate to consult an FH for a 95% confidence interval (CI), a 5% type I error and 80% power. The minimum sample size was calculated to be 260.\nA simple random sampling method was used to recruit the study participants from the list of patients expected to attend the child and adolescent clinic during the study period. Randomiser software (http:// www.randomizer.org/) generated a list of participants. Those selected randomly and who did not meet the\ninclusion criteria or opted not to participate were substituted with the next randomly selected participant chosen to fulfil the required sample size. A 20% attrition rate, including non-completed questionnaires and unsigned consent forms, was considered.\nDescriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation (SD), median, range, frequency and percentage, were used to report participants\u2019 demographic and clinical data and response to the use of children\u2019s psychotropic medications. The dependent variable was from one attitude question: \u2018If your child experienced psychiatric symptoms, would you first consult a folk healer (FH) before consulting a psychiatrist? Yes/No.\u2019 Those parents who replied \u2018Yes\u2019 were categorised as the \u2018Prefer FH\u2019 group while those who replied \u2018No\u2019 were in the \u2018Non-FH\u2019 group. Univariate comparison between the two groups (Yes versus No) was evaluated using Chi-square/Fisher\u2019s exact test to explore demographic, clinical and other attitude variables. Those variables with P <0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic (Wald) regression for further analysis to identify the risk factors associated with the \u2018Prefer FH\u2019 group. All statistics, including the OR with 95% CI, were obtained by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 27.0 (IBM SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), set at a 5% level of significance.\nEthical approval was granted by the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman (MREC #2371). The study was conducted as per the Declaration of Helsinki and the American Psychological Association regarding human ethical research, including confidentiality, privacy and data management. Information on the nature and goals of the research, the right to anonymity and the right to withdraw at any stage with no effect on the clinical care was disseminated to the participants. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants."

            "text": "Over the past decades, there has been a rise in the prescription of psychotropic medications for mental health difficulties in children and adolescents.13 Oman is a country with a predominantly youthful population, and its economic growth and rapid demographic shift are witnessing a surge in mental health problems among young people.14 Yet, many do not seek care from qualified mental health professionals.15 However, since the development of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Oman in the late 1990s, several challenges have emerged, specifically, the maldistribution and scarcity of services for young people and the lack of a mental health act.16,17 The current study identified the attitudes and concerns of parents and caregivers about using psychiatric medications for children attending the CAMHS in SQUH. In this study, one of the caregivers\u2019 central beliefs regarding psychotropic medicines was that they lead to addiction, indicated by 44.1% (n = 132) of the respondents, which echoes the findings of other studies.8,9 Similarly, 28.4% (n = 85) of the respondents believed that the medications may lead to toxic and severe side-effects, which is in line with a plethora of studies in the literature with similar findings.18,19 Regarding treatment modalities, the majority of the respondents preferred psychotherapy as a treatment for their children; this is consistent with the results of international studies in which parents chose counselling as the first line of treatment and believed it to be beneficial and to have fewer risks compared with medications.20\nFurthermore, although the vast majority of parents agreed they would give medications to their children, if necessary, 25.4% (n = 76) said they would first consult an FH, probably due to sociocultural beliefs and social stigma associated with mental disorders.21 The parents who disagreed with giving psychotropic medications to their children were 3.8 times (P <0.001) more likely to consult an FH than\nparents who agreed to psychotropic medications being prescribed to their children, if necessary. Therefore, consulting an FH before accessing mental health services causes a treatment delay and may result in negative mental health consequences.21 Among the various sociodemographic factors, marital status, unemployment, lower income and lower education level were found to be significantly associated with consulting an FH prior to a psychiatrist. The existing literature also suggests that being single is associated with a higher tendency to visit an FH.22 However, the finding of the current study was the opposite, as married couples were more likely to consult FHs. Though it must be added that this may not be an accurate representation, as more than 90% of the parents in this study were married, and the overall prevalence of single-parent families in Oman is low.\nThe results of this study showed that respondents having the education of grade 12 or lower were more likely to consult FHs, and the same applied to those with lower income and unemployment; this finding concurs with studies done elsewhere.23 Furthermore, it is common for those living in low- and middle-income countries to have access to FHs.24 Although Oman is a high-income country, yet, based on the findings of this study, apparently it remains influenced by such practices. Therefore, even in wealthier countries, the relative popularity of FHs and alternative medicine should be scrutinised in the context of broader social, cultural and religious perspectives, as local values and beliefs influence people in making such decisions;25 this confers with a crucial national-level study conducted in Oman suggesting that there is an underutilisation of health-care services in people with mental health difficulties.26 Finally, in Oman and the wider Arab region, there is a need for culture-specific psychoeducation to address the contextual and socioreligious factors and stigma to improve access to mental health services.27,28\nDespite offering detailed and updated information from Oman, this study has some limitations. Because of the social stigma, some responses given by parents, particularly in relation to personal or family history with regard to psychiatric problems, might be unreliable and should be treated with caution. As the study was conducted in a city like Muscat, although people from other parts of Oman were included, it may have missed a large proportion of the wider Omani community. Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge that the study is subjective and several findings depend on the parents\u2019 opinions that could be influenced by different factors.\n196 | SQU Medical Journal, May 2023, Volume 23, Issue 2\nConclusion\nMost parents agreed they would give their children psychotropic medications if deemed necessary. However, a sizeable proportion of parents and caregivers preferred to consult an FH before accessing mental health services. Parents\u2019 opinions about and beliefs in psychotropic medications are not in line with scientific facts. Concerted efforts and increased awareness are needed to address parents\u2019 concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness of psychotropic medications in children to improve treatment outcomes. Moreover, incorporating psychosocial and behavioural interventions, parent training and psychiatric rehabilitation must be an integral part of the holistic approach to manage mental health difficulties in children and young people. Overall, mental health professionals play a significant role in promoting the best practices in the Middle East region and offering psychoeducation to parents and caregivers on the safe use and side-effects of psychiatric medications in children, thus including them in shared decisionmaking about medication regimens.\nauthors\u2019 contribution HM designed the study and drafted and critically reviewed the manuscript.
