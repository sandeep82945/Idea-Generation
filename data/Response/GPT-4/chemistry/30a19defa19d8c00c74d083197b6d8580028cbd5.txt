Exploring New Ionic Liquid (IL) Monomers for PIL Synthesis: Develop and characterize new IL monomers for the synthesis of PILs with different cations and anions, focusing on those with potential for higher CO2 selectivity and permeability. This could include experimenting with larger or more complex ions that might offer unique interactions with CO2 and other gases, potentially improving gas separation efficiency.

Investigating the Impact of Polymer Backbone on Membrane Performance: Conduct systematic studies to understand how different polymer backbones (other than polystyrene, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyacrylates) affect the gas separation performance of PIL-based membranes. This could help in identifying backbones that offer better mechanical properties, thermal stability, or gas separation efficiency.

Designing Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) with PILs: Explore the potential of incorporating inorganic, metallic, or carbon-based fillers (e.g., zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, graphene oxide) into PIL-based membranes to create MMMs. The goal would be to enhance gas separation properties, mechanical strength, and thermal stability, assessing how the synergy between PILs and fillers impacts overall membrane performance.

Studying the Effect of Membrane Morphology on Separation Performance: Delve deeper into the relationship between membrane morphology (e.g., pore size, distribution, and connectivity) and its separation performance. This could involve the use of advanced fabrication techniques (such as electrospinning, interfacial polymerization, or phase inversion) to tailor the structural properties of PIL-based membranes for optimal gas separation.

Evaluating Long-term Stability and Scalability of PIL-based Membranes: Focus on the long-term operational stability of PIL-based membranes under industrial conditions, including resistance to fouling, chemical degradation, and physical wear. Additionally, research could aim at scaling up the production process of PIL-based membranes, addressing challenges related to large-scale manufacturing, quality control, and cost-effectiveness.
