    "abstractText": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complicated endocrinopathy with an unclear etiology that afflicts fertility status in women. Although the underlying causes and pathophysiology of PCOS are not completely understood, it is suspected to be driven by environmental factors as well as genetic and epigenetic factors. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a weak estrogenic endocrine disruptor known to cause adverse reproductive outcomes in women. A growing relevance supports the notion that BPA may contribute to PCOS pathogenesis. Due to the indeterminate molecular mechanisms of BPA in PCOS endocrinopathy, we sought liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS), a metabolomics strategy that could generate a metabolic signature based on urinary BPA levels of PCOS and healthy individuals. Towards this, we examined urinary BPA levels in PCOS and healthy women by ELISA and performed univariate and chemometric analysis to distinguish metabolic patterns among high and low BPA in PCOS and healthy females, followed by pathway and biomarker analysis employing MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Our findings indicated aberrant levels of certain steroids, sphingolipids, and others, implying considerable disturbances in steroid hormone biosynthesis, linoleic, linolenic, sphingolipid metabolism, and various other pathways across target groups in comparison to healthy women with low BPA levels. Collectively, our findings provide insight into metabolic signatures of BPA-exposed PCOS women, which can potentially improve management strategies and precision medicine.",

Women suffering from PCOS are more likely to develop hyperglycaemia, hypertension,\u00a0type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, and eventually develop metabolic syndrome in later stages (Prabhu et\u00a0al. 2022; Sagvekar et\u00a0al. 2018). Although the exact pathophysiology of this complicated lifestyle disorder\u00a0is undetermined, it is believed to be caused by a complex interplay between\u00a0different factors including\u00a0ethnicity,\u00a0genetic and epigenetic predisposition, and\u00a0environmental facets (Prabhu et\u00a0al. 2021). Environmental influences such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase symptoms of PCOS or promote the\u00a0ultimate PCOS\u00a0phenotype in genetically susceptible women (Laz\u00farov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2021).

These chemicals cause disturbances in the reproductive system due to their imitative action on endogenous hormones (Barrett and Sobolewski 2014).\nBPA is one of the most abundantly available EDC, serves as a precursor for polycarbonates, polyesters, polysulfones, polyether ketones, and a major class of epoxy resins. It has a wide range of applications, and is commonly found in baby bottles, linings for metal-based food and plastic cans, optical lenses, electric equipment, plastic water ducts, dental sealing, and billing receipts (Rutkowska and Racho\u0144 2014). Although the potential means of exposure to BPA in humans are inhalation, ingestion, and dermal uptake, few studies reported that BPA exposure solely occurs through dietary consumption (Ohore and Zhang 2019; Mukhopadhyay et\u00a0al. 2022).\nHuman studies reported that BPA levels are substantially elevated in body fluids of PCOS women compared to healthy females, but the clinical significance as well as causality is yet unknown (Laz\u00farov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2021). Additionally, it was perceived that serum BPA levels are relatively higher in females suffering from ovarian dysfunction and obesity and are in positive association\u00a0with androgens, implying that BPA may enhance or suppress androgen\u00a0metabolism and action in the liver (Takeuchi et\u00a0al. 2004). Nevertheless, given that females\u00a0with PCOS have greater circulating androgens\u00a0than healthy females, and that higher androgen levels reduce BPA elimination. Henceforth, researchers hypothesized that excessive BPA may possibly signify a consequence rather than a cause (Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al. 2010). In addition, recent evidence suggests that BPA may decrease ovarian steroidogenesis, leading to a contentious explanation of the link between BPA and ovarian steroids (Laz\u00farov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2021).\nModern research is increasingly concentrating on the identification of potential\u00a0biomarkers to comprehend the metabolic abnormalities in PCOS (Vonica et\u00a0al. 2020). The assessment of relative amounts of metabolites, which may be affected by disorders, pathogens, and exposure to substances in the environment, is accomplished through metabolomics (Cho et\u00a0al. 2018). Plasma metabolomics provides thorough monitoring of small-molecule degradation products downstream of gene\u00a0and protein\u00a0expression, allowing researchers to uncover key\u00a0metabolic processes linked to PCOS (Chang et\u00a0al. 2017).\nA large number of studies have identified various metabolites involved in BPA metabolism and PCOS pathogenesis distinctly, but the impact of BPA in PCOS pathogenesis has not been reported. Henceforth, we employed LC\u2013MS/MS to assess the alteration in metabolites and their patterns in PCOS and healthy control women. The current study may increase the probabilities of detecting possible metabolites which can lead to a better understanding of the multifarious\nrole of PCOS and highlight the risk posed by exposure to BPA in PCOS and healthy females."

Patients who come to the hospital for a check-up and then met the inclusion criteria for the study were asked to participate voluntarily. Women between the age group 18 and 45 diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam diagnostic criteria (2003) (Teede et\u00a0al. 2018) were included in the study. Females who have not attained menarche, have attained menopause, and patients diagnosed with chronic illness except diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease were excluded from the study. Regularly menstruating women without any clinical complications were considered for the control group after a pelvic ultrasound examination. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participants were classified into PCOS cases and controls. After taking informed consent from participants, 3\u00a0mL of peripheral blood and 10\u00a0mL of urine samples were collected.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect molecular features that differentiated PCOS and control women with high and low BPA levels. The software tool MSConvert (Adusumilli and Mallick 2017) was used to convert raw spectrometric data (.d files) to mzML format. Using MetaboAnalyst 5.0, the data were normalized further processed by log transformation and Pareto scaling, to acquire uniform individual characteristics before conducting statistical analysis. Additionally, partial least squaresdiscriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (supervised multivariate analysis) was employed to obtain maximal separation in each pair between the groups, as this technique minimizes the chances of overfitting. Further, we performed Student\u2019s t-test with a false discovery rate corrected to determine the statistical significance of signal patterns obtained with p < 0.05 in all study\u00a0groups.\n1 3\nPathway and\u00a0receiver operation characteristic curve analysis\nThe identified metabolites were employed for mapping pathways.

PCOS women have been found to have higher rates of body mass index, abnormally heavy uterine bleeding, and menstrual cramps than women without the condition (Table\u00a01). In females with PCOS, hyperandrogenism manifests as acne and increased facial and body hair growth in comparison to control females. The modified FerrimanGallwey (mFG) scoring system for hirsutism was followed which was significantly higher in PCOS women than healthy controls (p < 0.0001). In addition, we observed high level of anti-mullerian hormone in PCOS females than healthy controls. When assessed for urinary BPA levels, we observed significantly elevated levels of BPA in women with PCOS than those of healthy control women (Table\u00a01). Further, the correlation analysis between estimated BPA levels and various clinical variables was performed which revealed an inverse correlation with FSH and positive correlation with Hb1Ac (Table\u00a0S1).\nCharacterization of\u00a0differential metabolic features among\u00a0PCOS and\u00a0healthy females premised on\u00a0BPA concentrations\nAfter differentiating the plasma samples of the participants into four groups, we further characterized differential metabolites and performed downstream analysis with three target groups (case high, case low, and control high), considering control low as a reference group.

            "text": "BPA among\u00a0the most prevalent\u00a0EDC\u00a0found in daily\u00a0life has been speculated to be involved in the PCOS\u00a0pathophysiology\u00a0by exerting an impact on a wide range of molecular\npathways (Kechagias et\u00a0al. 2020). Numerous human investigations have substantiated the connection between BPA exposure and a wide range of health outcomes, such as perinatal, neonatal, reproductive, and endocrine consequences (Wang et\u00a0al. 2018). Nevertheless, it has not been determined whether the observed links between elevated BPA levels and PCOS reflect to an etiological aspect or whether the condition\u2019s endocrine signature causes changes in the BPA\u00a0accumulation and elimination patterns (Kechagias et\u00a0al. 2020).\n1 3\nSeveral studies show that BPA levels were considerably higher in women with PCOS compared to normal females and could probably be one of many fundamental origins of this disorder (Kechagias et\u00a0al. 2020; Kawa et\u00a0al. 2021). Similarly, our study also revealed elevated urinary BPA levels in PCOS-afflicted women compared to healthy women. Because of the discrepancy between the high levels of BPA found in certain healthy females and the low levels found in some PCOS patients, we set out to investigate the root causes of PCOS in women with low BPA levels and to check whether PCOS-related complications could arise in healthy women with elevated BPA levels as well. As a result, we sought a metabolomics strategy that could generate a plasma metabolic signature which may provide information on the molecular pathophysiology of PCOS induced by BPA.\nConsidering the inevitability of BPA exposure, molecular markers for earlier detection of the detrimental impact\u00a0of BPA are essential for enabling the implementation of primary preventative measures (Wang et\u00a0al. 2018) As in other studies involving Devang et\u00a0al. (2018) and Ganie et\u00a0al. (2019), our study also indicated significantly greater BMI and mFG scores, and higher AMH levels in individuals with PCOS than in healthy women (Devang et\u00a0al. 2018; Ganie et\u00a0al. 2019). The HbA1c\u00a0is a reliable\u00a0marker for insulin resistance (IR). It is well known that PCOS is associated with IR due to its importance in the reproductive process (Adhe Rojekar et\u00a0al. 2022). The positively significant correlation\u00a0of Hb1Ac with BPA levels, as revealed by Akash et\u00a0al. (2022), indicated that individuals with diabetes mellitus\u00a0were more likely to exhibit IR\u00a0owing to BPA exposure than non-diabetic individuals (Akash et\u00a0al. 2022). In keeping with these findings, the correlation analysis between Hb1Ac and BPA levels\u00a0revealed a positive association in our study, indicating that control females may also be more susceptible to developing IR later in life due to BPA exposure.\nPathway enrichment analysis performed by Tchen et\u00a0al. (2022) showed steroid hormone biosynthesis as one of the significant altered metabolic pathway linked with BPA exposure (Tchen et\u00a0al. 2022) indicating a comparable pathway variation in control females of the present investigation. Also as our study indicated, there are certain studies reported that the sphingolipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan biosynthesis (Yu et\u00a0al. 2021), and glutathione metabolism (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2020) were perturbed in PCOS females. Similarly, we also noticed perturbed \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism in women with and without PCOS which may be attributed due to high concentration of urinary BPA. The outcomes of the present study are consistent with existing research findings, despite limited data concerned to metabolic disturbances caused by BPA.\nRecent investigations indicate the role of alternate androgen excess pathways in PCOS. Saito et\u00a0al. (2016) show that the alternate backdoor route in PCOS contributes to excess\nandrogen production (Saito et\u00a0al. 2016). In women with PCOS, elevated androgen metabolites such as androsterone and androstanediol were produced via both the traditional and alternate backdoor processes. Since these mechanisms of androgen secretion have been overlooked in clinical evaluations of PCOS to date, future research that includes these compounds may benefit in better defining the androgen pattern of PCOS and employing it as a screening tool and reported elevated androstanediol to be the most accurate predictor of PCOS versus controls. In agreement with this, our analyses found elevated androstanediol in PCOS and healthy control individuals having higher BPA than healthy females with lower BPA levels. Further, this pattern in women may be attributed due to high exposure to BPA.\nBPA presumably affects CYP11A1 and inhibits its expression (Peretz et\u00a0al. 2011). Pregnenolone is necessary for the production of hormones with the estradiol biosynthesis pathway, such as testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and estrone. Hormone synthesis in antral follicles would be significantly affected by a disturbance in pregnenolone metabolism. Consequently, BPA certainly reduces the CYP11A1 expression, resulting in a decrease of hormones in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway due to the unavailability of pregnenolone (Peretz and Flaws 2013). In the present investigation, we detected the downregulation of hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenolone in women with elevated BPA levels relative to those with lower BPA levels in controls.\nRecent findings have shown that even low-level exposure to BPA can impair metabolic pathways, leading to lipid accumulation\u00a0in the liver, elevated oxidative stress, and inflammation in females (Cho et\u00a0al. 2018). Rajska et\u00a0al. (2020) reported high levels of hypoxanthine and lowered lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) (18:3) concentration in the serum samples of PCOS women (Rajska et\u00a0al. 2020). Accordingly, our investigation also indicated an elevated hypoxanthine level in low BPA-exposed PCOS females and a diminished level of LysoPC (18:3) in PCOS women compared to healthy individuals. It has been shown that aberrant hypoxanthine levels hinder oocyte meiosis, implying a possible reduction in fertility rate (Hu et\u00a0al. 2021). Furthermore, reduced lysophosphatidylcholine levels have been connected to obesity and a greater risk of T2DM, both of which exacerbate IR. This could clarify why PCOS individuals are more inclined to develop diabetes. As a result, low LPC concentrations can be a sign of the possibility of PCOS or diabetes in PCOS (Jia et\u00a0al. 2019) (Vonica et\u00a0al. 2020).\nRegardless of BPA levels, we noticed the downregulation of dihydrosphingosine in PCOS individuals than control ones having low BPA, as reported by Li et\u00a0al. (2019). Rajska et\u00a0al. (2020) showed that ornithine is significantly downregulated in PCOS individuals in comparison with healthy females. Researchers also reported the negative\n1 3\ninfluence of BPA on ornithine synthesis in cultured porcine trophectoderm cell lines on exposure of 1 \u00d7 10\u22124\u00a0M BPA (Elmetwally et\u00a0al. 2020). When investigating the ornithine levels in the current study, we noticed the downregulation of the metabolite in healthy females with high BPA levels, which reflects the negative impact of BPA among healthy females. A study performed by Cho et\u00a0al. (2018) indicated that the multiple sphingolipid metabolites were altered due to high exposure of BPA and cause numerous complications in humans. Accordingly, lysoPE(18:1/0:0) was found to be higher in control women with high BPA levels, and a similar pattern of lysoPE was observed in the follicular fluid of the PCOS females revealed by Liu et\u00a0al. (2019). Hence, we speculate that persistent exposure to BPA in healthy females may have high lysoPE levels and would be more prone to develop PCOS in later stages. A clear inference concerning metabolic perturbations in females with high and low BPA levels requires further investigation. Prior to being utilized in a therapeutic setting, the limitations of the current study should be considered wherein the metabolite profiling was carried out in small sample size hence a validation of the effectiveness of the specified metabolites should be conducted on a larger group and in addition to plasma, urine metabolite profiling also might find more precise indicators of BPA-induced PCOS susceptibility."
