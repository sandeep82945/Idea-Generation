    "abstractText": "The digital economy and the green economy are two major issues for economic recovery in the post epidemic era. From spatial interaction spillover, we analyze and measure the relationships between the digital economy and environmental pollution in 287 prefecture-level cities in China from 2008 to 2018 using simultaneous spatial equations and the generalized 3-stage least square (GS3SLS) method. The results show that: (1) there is a reverse and complex spatio-temporal evolution of the digital economy and environmental pollution in Chinese cities. (2) There is a spatial interaction spillover effect between the digital economy and environmental pollution. Local digital economy and environmental pollution inhibit each other. The digital economy and environmental pollution have a significant spatial spillover. The digital economy of surrounding regions has a suppressive effect on local environmental pollution. The environmental pollution of surrounding cities has a crowding-out effect on the local digital economy. (3) Digital economy suppresses environmental pollution through the green development effect and innovative development effect; environmental pollution suppresses the digital economy through the talent crowding out effect and the policy tightening effect. The conclusion of this paper provides evidence for the coupling and coordinated development between the digital and green economy, which is of great significance for promoting the transformation of economic development modes and realizing green and high-quality development.",

Digital technology has entered the deepening stage of cross-border integration from the set of knowledge popularization. The digital economy, based on this, has produced substantial economic benefits. In the past, it was generally believed that there was a conflict between economic development and environmental pollution [1,2], but the emergence of the digital economy seemed to break away from this dilemma. As the largest developing country and carbon emitter, China should pay special attention to reducing pollution and carbon while paying attention to economic development [3\u20135]. In particular, the central government pointed out that \u201cachieving carbon peak by 2030 and striving to achieve carbon neutralization by 2060\u201d put forward higher requirements for pollution reduction in the new era and new stage. It is challenging to achieve green development only by pollution terminal treatment. Effective economic means must form a long-term mechanism for treating environmental pollution.

The Chinese central government\u2019s \u201csuggestions on the 14th five-year plan and longterm goals for 2035\u201d put forward a proposal to: \u201cdeepen cooperation in public health, digital economy, green development, science, technology, and education, and promote people and cultural exchanges\u201d [6]. The digital economy will progressively become a new driving force in future economic growth, promoting a green economy that can balance the link between the digital economy and environmental resource conservation. China should attach great importance on the changing harmony between the green and digital economy, urging them to join forces and build a new economic growth pattern. As a result, investigating the coupling and coordinated growth link between the green economy and the digital economy is critical for promoting China\u2019s economic development model transition and achieving high-quality green development [7\u201310]. Based on the above context, this research aims to discuss the link between the growth of the digital economy and environmental pollution by assessing their temporal and geographical evolution features and interaction spillover effects. The textual logic of this research is shown in Figure 1.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

            "text": "There is no consensus on the interaction between digital economy and sustainable development. Extensive studies have shown that the digital economy and green economy are developing in lockstep [11\u201313], with the following categories: Digitization and sustainable development are the main trends of economic and social development [14\u201316]. Castro et al. reviewed previous studies [17]; they believed that combining digitalization with sustainable development would provide a tremendous opportunity to create a greener economy and society, as well as pave the way for the attainment of sustainable development goals. One of the most potential possibilities for long-term growth is digitization [18]. People are increasingly expecting digital to offer value to achieving sustainable development objectives by providing new data sources, improved analytical skills, and a collaborative digital ecosystem [19,20]. Franca et al. proposed that small cities use blockchain to enhance solid waste management [21]. Emerging digital technologies play a positive role in green development. Innovative digital techniques (such as deep learning and data-driven engineering) may be used to achieve a greater level of automation and early optimization in the design process, which is becoming more vital for the long-term sustainability of resource-based circular economies [22,23]. Rajala et al. explored how smart products may help foster the industrial ecosystem\u2019s long-term growth [24]. The research contributes to our understanding of the circular economy\u2019s closed-loop system, which today relies more than ever on the digital platform. Dumont et al. believe that digital technology is low-cost and easy to obtain, which provides power for sustainable ecological agriculture [25]. The digital sharing economy is considered to be green and environmentally protective. The sharing economy platform improves the reuse rate of existing commodities and alleviates unnecessary resource consumption [26]. Digital development promotes the popularity of shared travel, which encourages consumers to use shared transportation instead of buying private cars [26\u201328]. Compared with taxis, digital ride services have better energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Uber\u2019s mileage capacity usage rate (61%) was greater than that of taxis (49.1%), according to Cramer and Krueger by using the trip data of taxis and Uber in five cities in the United States [29]. Besides, the inverse relationship between economic growth and pollution has been explored in the abundant literature on Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), including the spatial effect and impact of the digital economy [30,31]. When economic development reaches a specific point, the \u201cinflection point\u201d, environmental degradation tends to go from high to low, the pollution intensity steadily decreases, and ecological protection is improved [32]. This theory has been confirmed by a large number of studies and exists in countries worldwide [33], especially in China [34,35]. However, many studies have proposed in a tense relationship between digitization and sustainable development. According to Martin et al. [36], there are five conflicts between smart cities and urban sustainable development goals, and environmental protection is neglected. The significance of a shared digital economy on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, according to Jin et al., is so far unknown [37]. While replacing taxis, digital ride service also hurts other green travel modes, such as cycling, public transport, walking, and carpooling. By analyzing six European cities\u2019 digitization and carbon footprint, Akande et al. found a contradiction between smart cities and sustainable development [38]. They believe that \u201ca city can be smart but not sustainable and vice versa\u201d. Kuntsman and Rattle propose that digital equipment has caused great damage to the environment during production, maintenance, and scrapping [39]. Compared with previous studies, this paper provides new evidence for the synergy between the digital economy and green development from advanced spatial interaction. The following is a list of the critical work and minor contributions: Build China\u2019s urban\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 4 of 23\ndigital economy and environmental pollution index from several dimensions and study their temporal and geographic development features of them, using samples from more than 200 prefecture-level and above cities in China, as well as historical data from 2008 to 2018. The following study examines the spatial interaction spillover impact of China\u2019s urban digital economy and environmental pollution using simultaneous spatial equations and the generalized three-stage least square technique (GS3SLS) and ultimately investigate the interaction mechanism between them. The empirical results show that: (1) between China\u2019s urban digital economy growth and environmental pollution, there is a degree of reverse development trend and complicated geographical distribution. (2) The urban digital economy and environmental pollution in China have a spatial interaction spillover effect. Local digital economy and pollution can hurt each other. The digital economy and environmental pollutants have a substantial regional spillover impact. The digital economy of surrounding cities inhibits local environmental pollution, and the environmental pollution of surrounding cities has no significant crowding-out effect on the local digital economy. (3) The digital economy suppresses environmental pollution through the green development effect and innovative development effect; environmental pollution suppresses the digital economy through the talent crowding out effect and the policy tightening effect."

            "heading": "2.1. Hypothesis",
            "text": "China\u2019s digital economy is widely assumed to be on a long-term and steady upward trajectory. China\u2019s digital economy has increased in recent years. As per the white paper on China\u2019s digital economy growth (2020), the magnitude of China\u2019s digital economy added value has spread from 2.6 trillion yuan in 2005 to 35.8 trillion yuan in 2019. From 14.2 per cent in 2005 to 36.2 per cent in 2019, its share of GDP has grown. The fast expansion of the local economy has tremendously aided the prosperity of the area\u2019s digital economy. The economic growth of Chinese cities, on the other hand, is highly imbalanced, resulting in an unequal temporal and geographical distribution of the digital economy\u2019s development. Similarly, as the Chinese government places a greater emphasis on environmental preservation, pollution should steadily decrease. However, due to regional economic imbalances, there are variances in the elimination pace of various non-green enterprises (such as heavy pollution and mining) in different areas, resulting in complicated environmental pollution evolution features across cities; evidence from Europe can provide a reference for this [40]. The north and south of the EU region can be understood as China\u2019s coastal and inland areas. Both parts have established emission trading markets. It can be explained that the source of growth is technological innovation, which brings new digital technology and leads to the production of new industrial products. Similarly, emission reduction quotas will reduce pollution emissions in China, reduce pollution in coastal areas, and increase pollution in inland regions. As a result, we propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1 (H1). In Chinese cities, the digital economy and pollution have reversed and complicated temporal and geographical dynamic development features.\nThe digital economy and environmental damage have a complicated connection. The first is the effect of digitalization on pollution levels. Since the neoclassical growth model was proposed, academic circles have unanimously agreed that technological advancement favors efficiency. Boosting the expansion of the digital economy would encourage the intensive change in the industrial production model by enabling technical innovation to reduce pollution. Besides, the digital economy can transform Internet traffic\u2019s value into economic and ecological value and provide technical reserves and product application incentives for green consumption. Using digital technology to develop green consumer items and create a green consumption platform may increase public engagement and feeling of ownership in green consumption and enhance the communication efficiency of the green consumption idea. However, it is also possible that increased production\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 5 of 23\ndue to improved efficiency will increase emissions. For example, in R&D-based growth model, such as the Romer model, when material capital is a pollution source, technological progress in the form of variety increase can induce rising pollution emissions by increasing material capital. Even if technological progress is achieved by putting pollution-reducing products into the production of final products, pollution will not decrease. The same is true when the source of growth is human capital. Therefore, technological progress can reduce pollution when the final products produced by improving efficiency are put into the production of pollution-reducing products or linked with ecological innovation that helps reduce pollution [41,42]. The second point to consider is the influence of pollution on the digital economy. The reform and opening since 1978 have brought opportunities for China\u2019s economic development. However, the extensive economy dominated by heavy industry has also caused a massive burden on the ecological environment. China has steadily become one of the most polluted nations due to its past policy of focusing on growth rather than conservation. Environmental and ecological concerns have become more significant as China\u2019s industrialization process has accelerated. Among them, the frequent occurrence of air pollution is the most apparent embodiment, which directly affects the health of most residents and continuously causes various social and economic losses. As an essential part of today\u2019s social and economic development, the digital economy has also been damaged. However, the digital economy and environmental pollution do not only interact within the city as their specific spatial distribution characteristics; rather, there is a complex spatial interaction spillover effect. As a result, we propose the second hypothesis:\nHypothesis 2 (H2). There is a spatial interaction spillover effect between the digital economy and environmental pollution in Chinese cities.\nFigure 2 shows the structure of H2.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

The digital economy is a new economic structure that has emerged due to technical advancements in electronic equipment, communication networks, and data processing. The digital economy and its information communication channels will significantly improve the efficiency of knowledge dissemination, which will undoubtedly enhance the knowledge stock of the whole economy in the macro dimension, and then drive technological innovation. In reality, for example, big data and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms can effectively improve the efficiency of enterprise information collection and integration and then help enterprises in developing new products. This innovation driver promotes economic efficiency while also having a substantial beneficial influence on environmental efficiency. From the reverse inhibition of environmental pollution in the digital economy, the extrusion of talents and a harsh policy\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 6 of 23\nenvironment may be the primary transmission mechanism. In the long-term process of industrialization, the environmental damage in some developed cities in China is severe, and high pollution problems such as haze are challenging to solve with speed. The willingness to \u201cescape\u201d from the town is gradually strengthened for professionals who pay attention to health. \u201cAir pollution is becoming a greater concern for our members and their families.\u201d Tang Yadong, Secretary-General of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, once said, \u201calthough there are many reasons for members to leave here, we almost always hear that air pollution is one of the reasons.\u201d A reduction in emission allowances would trigger technological innovation and affect the location of polluting firms [42]. This would impact the health of the population in the background. The relocation of firms can also be interpreted as the migration of talent if the location of polluting companies is accompanied by the migration of researchers and technicians working with the developed technologies [43\u201345]. Furthermore, China\u2019s central government has consistently imposed environmental protection duties on local governments in recent years, and appropriate laws and regulations have been published one after the other [46\u201348]. Some stringent laws have even irreversibly harmed local businesses. In this situation, rules may potentially stifle the growth of the digital economy. Therefore, we put forward the third hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3 (H3). Ecological and innovation variables have a mediating role in the digital economy\u2019s ability to reduce pollution. Talent flow and regulatory variables mediate the reverse inhibition of environmental degradation in the digital economy."

            "text": "According to this paper\u2019s theoretical analysis and research assumptions, there is a link between the digital economy and the degree of environmental contamination. As a result, a fixed effect panel regression model based on simultaneous equations is developed as follows:\nd_ecoit = \u03b10 + \u03b11epit + \u03b1Xit + \u03c0i + \u03b5it (1)\nepit = \u03b20 + \u03b21d_ecoit + \u03b2Zit + \u00b5i + \u03c3it (2)\nwhere i is the city individual and t is the time; d_eco and ep, respectively, represent the digital economy and the pollution in the sample cities; Xit and Zit are the control variables that affect the digital economy and the pollution; \u03c0i and \u00b5i represent the fixed effect; \u03b5it and \u03c3it represent the error term. Using the usual fixed effects panel model to estimate the content of this article results in some mistakes. To begin with, the geographical link between the degree of digital economy growth and the amount of pollution is overlooked. That is, the impact of nearby cities on smaller cities is overlooked. Previous scientists have often used classic spatial econometric models to handle this challenge. The Spatial Lag Model (SLM), the Spatial Error Model (SEM), and the Spatial Dobbin Model (SDM) are examples of models that look at the one-way effects of significant variables. The spatial interplay between them was not well analyzed [49]. As a result, this research develops a simultaneous spatial equation to characterize the spatial interaction of the urban digital economy with pollution. Second, the possibility of a link between endogenous factors and random disturbance terms is overlooked. As a result, the spatial interaction spillover effect between the level of digital economy growth and the degree of environmental pollution was investigated using Theil and Zellner\u2019s generalized spatial 3-stage least square approach (GS3SLS) [50]. The simultaneous spatial equations are set as:\nd_ecoit = \u03b10 + \u03b11 n\n\u2211 j 6=i\nWd_ecoit + \u03b12 n\n\u2211 j 6=i Wepit + \u03b13epit + \u03b1Xit + \u03b5it (3)\nepit = \u03b20 + \u03b21 n\n\u2211 j 6=i\nWepit + \u03b22 n\n\u2211 j 6=i Wd_ecoit + \u03b23d_ecoit + \u03b2Zit + \u03c3it (4)\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 7 of 23\nW is the spatial weight matrix in Equations (3) and (4). Xit and Zit are the control variables that affect the digital economy and the pollution, including economic development level, urbanization, industrial structure, openness, marketization, population density, transportation, and posts. Moreover, there is no need to set the fixed effect, which has been confirmed by a large number of studies in the past [49,51,52]. The spatial weight matrix of geographical distance (W1) and economic-geographical distance (W2) are built, respectively, due to the complexity of spatial spillovers. W1 uses the latitude and longitude coordinates of each city center to determine the straight-line distance between them. Take the reciprocal as the weight and set the bandwidth to 0\u201330 using dimensionless processing. If the distance between the two cities\u2019 centers exceeds 30, the weight value is set to 0, indicating that the two cities are not nearby. W2 examines the economic distance between cities based on geographical distance. We calculate individual elements in the matrix using the following methods:\nECO_GEO_Distancei,j = GEO_Distancei,j \u00d7 ECO_Distancei,j (5)\nECO_GEO_Distancei,j reflects the economic-geographical distance between cities i and j, whereas GEO_Distancei,j represents the geographical distance between cities i and j in Equation (5). The absolute magnitude of the per capita GDP difference between cities i and j is represented by ECO_Distancei,j. The normalized weight is then taken as the reciprocal of ECO_GEO_Distancei,j. \u03b11 represents the overflow strength and direction of the digital economy development level from the nearby city. \u03b21 represents the overflow strength and direction of the environmental pollution from the nearby city. The variables \u03b12 and \u03b22 are utilized to validate the geographical connection between digital economics and pollution. The former indicates the degree and direction of neighboring urban environment pollution\u2019s influence on the local digital economy development level; the latter indicates the magnitude and direction of the impact of adjacent cities\u2019 digital economy development levels on local environmental degradation. The endogenous link between the digital economy and the degree of pollution is described by \u03b13 and \u03b23. The GS3SLS is utilized in this study for a global estimate based on the simultaneous spatial equations listed above. The degree of environmental degradation and the amount of digital economy growth are endogenous variables in the spatial simultaneous equation model. The use of OLS estimation will result in parameter estimation inconsistency. The GS3SLS is used to estimate the overall space, the estimation method and considering the spatial correlation and the endogenous variable potential equation of random perturbation terms possible correlation between problems, improve the effectiveness of the estimation results. In addition, the above theoretical mechanism analysis shows that the green development effect and innovative development effect are the two main mechanisms of the digitization economy affecting environmental pollution. In comparison, the two main mechanisms of environmental pollution affecting the digital economy are the talent crowding effect and the policy tightening effect. This paper adopts the mediating effect model based on spatial analysis to verify these four mechanisms to conduct empirical research [53]. The particular model is established as follows, using the impact mechanism of the digital economy on environmental degradation as an example:\nd_ecoit = \u03b10 + \u03b11 n\n\u2211 j 6=i\nWd_ecoit + \u03b12 n\n\u2211 j 6=i Wepit + \u03b13epit + \u03b1Xit + \u03b5it (6)\nMit = \u03b20 + \u03b21epit + \u03b2 Xit + \u03c3it (7)\nd_ecoit = \u03b30 + \u03b31 n\n\u2211 j 6=i\nW d_ecoit + \u03b32 n\n\u2211 j 6=i W epit + \u03b33epit + \u03b34Mit + \u03b3 Xit + \u00b5it (8)\nInt.

M is the mediating variable, including urban ecological efficiency and regional innovation and entrepreneurship index. When analyzing the influence mechanism of environmental pollution on the digital economy, M includes the number of scientific researcher and the environmental regulation index.

            "text": "According to the maximum availability of data, the sample for this article includes 287 prefecture-level and above cities in China, with a temporal dimension ranging from 2008 to 2018. Firstly, the core variables of this paper are the digital economy (d-eco) and environmental pollution (ep). The entropy weight approach is used in this study to calculate the digital economy\u2019s development level based on three factors [54]. The first indicator is digital finance index, obtained by the Python web crawler method based on the practices of Su et al. [55], and Yao et al. [56]. The other two indicators are digital industry (consisting of employees in the digital industry and total telecommunication services), and digital infrastructure that consists of internet penetration and mobile phone penetration. The weight of each index measured by the entropy weight method is shown in Table 1. Its essence is to use the entropy of variables to estimate the amount of information contained in variables. The digital industry and digital finance are the predominant drivers of the urban digital economy. There are obvious differences in the development of the digital industry and digital finance among regions. However, with the gradual popularization of digital equipment, there is no significant difference in the level of digital infrastructure among areas, then its proportion is also low. In this paper, the degree of environmental pollution includes three common types of pollution: wastewater, waste gas, and smoke. Per capita wastewater pollutants (t/person), industrial sulfur dioxide pollutants (t/person), and industrial smoke emissions (t/person) are the units of measurement. The data are from China\u2019s city statistical yearbook. Then, Z-score is used for standardization, addition, and normalization.\nSecondly, the mediating variables of this paper are urban ecological efficiency (e-eff), regional innovation and entrepreneurship index (inn), the number of researchers (rd), and environmental regulation index (er). The DEA model, which is based on the superefficient SBM-GML model, is used to assess urban ecological efficiency [57]. Fixed assets, employment, urban area, and energy usage are the input indicators. GDP is the anticipated production, and the unexpected output is wastewater, waste gas, and smoke [58,59]. The regional innovation and entrepreneurship index comes from the Center for Enterprise Research of Peking University. The number of scientific researchers comes from China\u2019s city statistical yearbook, represented by the number of scientific researchers every 10 thousand people and normalized [60]. The fourth mediating variable is the environmental regulation index, which is analyzed by Chen et al. [61]. Specifically, this paper uses the annual government work reports of cities at all levels in China to analyze the proportion of statements containing keywords of environmental regulation in the full text. The keywords\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 9 of 23\nare 45 Chinese words such as \u201cenvironmental protection, environmental protection, green development, new energy, haze . . . \u201d. After using text analysis to measure the proportion of environmental regulation-related sentences, we multiplied by 100 and took the first-order difference to obtain the environmental regulation index of prefecture-level cities in China. Lastly, eight core variables-related control variables were chosen [62\u201365]. We took into account the city\u2019s per capita GDP and logarithm it (pgdp); Regional urbanization level (urb) is the fraction of the city\u2019s population living in the municipal area; The share of secondary and tertiary industries in the city\u2019s GDP (ind); Openness (ope), the city\u2019s real foreign investment share of GDP; The level of marketization (mar), the fraction of private and individual employment in the whole population; Take the logarithm of the population density (den) of the whole city; Total city passenger volume divided by total population, expressed as a logarithm (tra); Postal development level (pos), revenue from postal business divided by the entire population.\nTable 2 lists the variables\u2019 sources and descriptive statistics."

In terms of geographical pattern distribution, western and central China have wide \u201cL-L\u201d and \u201cH-L\u201d growth patterns, indicating that environmental pollution in these areas is generally low. A few industrial cities absorb the pollution emission pressure of surrounding cities. There is a small area of \u201cH-H\u201d and \u201cL-H\u201d development patterns in the northwest, indicating an aggregation effect of environmental pollution in this area. In terms of the evolution of spatial pattern, the distribution of \u201cL-L\u201d and \u201cH-L\u201d in the midwestern regions diffused during the investigation period, which means that the environmental pollution across the central and western parts of China has been alleviated, and the green development interacts among cities.

General Interaction Effect between Digital Economy and Environmental Pollution\nThis research discovers a reciprocal inhibitory relationship through parameter estimation between the degree of the digital economy and environmental contamination. In terms of pure geographical distance, the level of the digital economy fell by 0.173 (p = 0.057) for each unit of increased environmental degradation. The environmental pollution was reduced by 0.133 (p = 0.072) for each unit of the digital economy. Overall, there is an interactive effect between the digital economy level and environmental pollution, with the marginal effect of environmental pollution on the digital economy level being more apparent. In the reciprocal promotion connection between the two, the marginal impact of environmental pollution on the digital economy level is comparatively dominating. The digital economy consists of a set of economic activities that help improve efficiency and optimize the economic structure, as well as various infrastructure and services that can support the digitization of economic activities; the green economy aspires for the growth of the economy, society, and environment in a coordinated manner. It\u2019s a well-balanced\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 15 of 23\neconomy that encompasses a variety of classic industrial economies. The digital and green economies work closely together and interact as the two most crucial new economic forms in the future. Environmental degradation also has hurt the digital economy\u2019s growth.\n4.2.2. Spatial Spillover Effect between Digital Economy and Environmental Pollution\nThis article discovers considerable regional spillovers in the digital economy and environmental damage through parameter estimation. From a pure geographical distance standpoint, the local digital economy grows by 0.129 (p = 0.035) for every unit of growth in the digital economy level of neighboring cities. The digital economies of neighboring cities may have a favorable impact on the development of the local digital economy via industrial external expansion radiation and the shared market effect. For each unit of environmental pollution in surrounding cities, the environmental pollution in local cities increases significantly by 0.999 (p = 0.000). The aggregation of polluting industries often accompanies the increase in environmental pollution in surrounding cities. Transportation costs induce enterprises to form upstream and downstream industrial clusters in nearby areas, and the pollution coverage is gradually expanded to improve the environmental pollution in local cities.\n4.2.3. Spatial Interaction Effect between Digital Economy and Environmental Pollution\nAccording to parameter estimates, the surrounding digital economy has an inhibiting impact on local environmental pollution. In contrast, the increase in environmental pollution in surrounding cities has an extrusion effect on the local digital economy level. In terms of pure geographical distance, each unit of rising in the digital economy level of neighboring cities reduces local environmental pollution by 0.133 (p = 0.001). The spread of the digital economy to neighboring cities has brought green development resources and environmental protection technology spillover, in turn engineering urban growth and building. Cities with lagging green economy growth should welcome, with an open mind, the spillover support of adjacent cities\u2019 digital economy development to the local green economy while modernizing their sectors. The local digital economy level may decline by 0.101 (p = 0.656) for each unit of environmental pollution in adjacent cities. Environmental pollution has prominent diffusion characteristics. For example, air pollution in industrial cities will quickly spread to surrounding cities. Taking Hebei Province of China as an example, some cities with severe industrial pollution have brought serious haze to the region, including many underdeveloped agricultural areas. The increase in environmental pollution in surrounding cities negatively impacts local digital economy investment and digital economy talents, resulting in an obvious crowding out effect. Underdeveloped areas of the digital economy should take advantage of surrounding cities\u2019 digital economy diffusion mechanism to actively carry out mild green transformation and alleviate the environmental pressure caused by industrialization."

First, we reduce the bandwidth of W in Equations (3) and (4) from 0\u201330 to 0\u201320 and expand to 0\u201340.

Secondly, there are usually two forms of the spatial weight matrix; one is a quantitative matrix in which the weight is equal to the reciprocal of the distance between samples. The alternative option is to use a qualitative weight matrix to split the distance between samples into \u201cneighbor relationship\u201d and \u201cnon neighbor relationship\u201d categories.

This article will perform an empirical analysis utilizing the mediating effect model to understand better the relationship between the digital economy and environmental degradation. According to the theoretical mechanism analysis, the green development impact and the inventive development effect are the two critical mechanisms for the digital economy to influence the growth of environmental degradation. The two primary methods for ecological degradation to harm the digital economy are the talent crowding out effect and the policy tightening effect. The mechanisms above will be empirically tested in this section. The stepwise test regression coefficient approach based on spatial analysis is used to assess the mediating function of urban ecological efficiency in the inhibition of digital economy on environmental pollution, as shown in Equations (6) and (8).

Bracket values are T-values.\nBy observing Table 7, it can be found that the digital economy has a significant inhibitory effect on environmental pollution through the green development effect. From the direction and significance of the coefficient in Column (1), it can be seen that the digital economy has a large negative influence on environmental contamination, which is consistent with the benchmark regression result; the influence of the digital economy on urban ecological efficiency is verified in Column (2), and the influence coefficient is 0.003, which means that digital economy encourages the growth of ecological efficiency; the impact coefficient of the local digital economy on environmental pollution in Column (3) is \u22120.012, which is lower than the impact coefficient of the local digital economy on environmental pollution in Column (1). The impact coefficient of intermediary variable urban ecological efficiency on environmental pollution is \u22121.035, which is significant at the 1% confidence level, which means that improving urban ecological efficiency will reduce environmental pollution. To summarize, the inhibitory effect of the digital economy on environmental pollution is partly realized by promoting ecological efficiency.

Through empirical analysis, we obtain the following significant findings: Firstly, reverse and complex spatio-temporal evolution of the digital economy and environmental pollution in Chinese cities. (1) The entire growth of China\u2019s urban digital economy is increasing with time. The disparity in development levels widens and then narrows. The number and development level of head cities have grown. Between 2015 and 2018, total environmental contaminants decreased significantly. The pollution difference between cities has narrowed recently. The number of clean zones increased, but so did their pollution. (2) China\u2019s urban digital economy and pollution distribution show significant geographical autocorrelation in global spatial evolution. The spatial correlation of the digital economy shows a fluctuating evolution from strong correlation to weak correlation, and the spatial correlation of environmental pollution shows the evolution characteristics of strong alternating correlation and weak correlation. (3) In terms of regional spatial evolution, the digital development in Western and Northeast China is generally weak, and the eastern coastal areas have the \u201calliance between giants\u201d Development pattern. Some key cities siphon digital economic resources in the surrounding backward areas. There is a certain degree of pollution accumulation in Northwest China, while environmental pollution in the central and western regions is relatively light. A few industrial cities absorb the pollution emission pressure of surrounding cities. The analysis of temporal and spatial evolution characteristics shows that there is a high imbalance between China\u2019s digital economy and environmental pollution, which is consistent with the previous research results in other regions. The unbalanced development will inevitably lead to the continuous flow of factors between regions, which leads to the subsequent conclusion. Secondly, there is a complex spatial interaction spillover effect between the digital economy and environmental pollution. (1) The digital economy and pollution are mutually inhibited. The digital economy contributes to ecologically friendly development, while pollution impacts the local digital economy. (2) The digital economy and pollution have enormous geographical spillover effects. The digital economy will spread to the neighboring regions, raising the urban circle\u2019s total digital level. The industrial agglomeration of polluting enterprises leads to the correlation of regional emissions. (3) The level of the surrounding digital economy can restrain the local environmental pollution, and the increase in environmental pollution in surrounding cities can also squeeze out the local digital economy. The radiation of the digital economy to surrounding cities has brought an overflow of green development resources and environmental protection technology. In contrast, the diffusion of pollution emissions with air and other media has caused the outflow of emerging digital industries in surrounding cities. The development of digital economy has crossed the \u201cinflection point\u201d of EKC and formed a \u201cjoint force\u201d with environmental protection, promoting each other and developing in a virtuous circle. However, the results of spatial interaction spillover effect show that there is diffusion and competition between digital economy and environmental pollution outside or between cities, and the previous research focusing on the research within the sample is not enough. Finally, we found the specific interaction mechanism between the digital economy and environmental pollution. (1) The digital economy reduces pollution by encouraging green and creative growth. The vibrant digital economy has led to emerging digital technologies and platforms and significantly promoted ecological efficiency. Technological innovation and efficiency improvement are of crucial significance to green development. (2) Environmental contamination hinders the digital industry by talent outflow and restricting policies. Serious pollution problems such as haze in industrialized cities lead to losing\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 5074 20 of 23\nhigh-tech talents. The relevant environmental laws and regulations issued to make up for the ecological deterioration also hurt economic development. These are the inevitable consequences of \u201cpollution first and then treatment.\u201d Admittedly, this study also has several deficiencies. (1) Even though this paper employs a spatial econometric method to investigate the relationship between the digital economy and environmental pollution, its conclusion is based on historical data and econometric reasoning, lacks in-depth economic theoretical analysis, and can only reflect the evolution of data characteristics and their relationships during the study period. This disadvantage may have an impact on the study\u2019s long-term effectiveness. In the future, we should develop a universal economic theoretical model to assess the usefulness of the results of this work and make appropriate projections. (2) It should be noted that the covariates in this paper are selected according to the availability of data and the mainstream methods of previous research, which is less targeted to the digital economy and environmental pollution topics in this paper. More relevant variables should be actively constructed for analysis if further research can be carried out. (3) Although this paper uses the cutting-edge spatial econometric model, there are still two common shortcomings. One is that the primary estimation method of the spatial econometric model is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), but the large sample theory of MLE needs to be improved. The other is that we must subjectively set a non-random spatial weight matrix instead of estimating the matrix according to the data. The spatial weight matrix may not be entirely reflected the complex relationship between different regions. Although many robustness tests have been carried out in this paper to minimize this error, it is unavoidable. (4) Due to the data availability limit, this study uses index variables for analyses. It would largely constrain policy implications potentially linked to the results. (5) The last deficiency is the sample problem of this paper. According to Figures 6 and 7, readers can find that some cities in central and Western China do not consider it due to the lack of data. In the empirical test, it also impacts the effectiveness of the test of spatial interaction spillover effect."

            "text": "The conclusion of this paper serves as a point of reference for many nations\u2019 and regions\u2019 digital economy and green development initiatives. According to the analysis of temporal and spatial evolution characteristics, it is necessary to balance the digital economy and the share of environmental degradation across areas and equitably divide digital economy development resources so that backward regions may also benefit from high-quality economic growth enabled by the digital economy. Environmental pollution enterprises should also be appropriately distributed to avoid areas with excessive pollution concentration from breaking through the upper limit of ecological self-regulation capacity and causing irreversible ecological damage. The significant spatial spillover effect shows that to grow cities in underdeveloped regions, it needs to learn from adjacent cities\u2019 experiences with digital economy usage and management and cut down or green-update backward sectors; the negative spatial interaction warns us that, while consolidating their development, advanced areas of the digital economy and green development should use their resources to help neighboring backward cities carry out green innovation and pollution control, improve the inhibition ability of the digital economy to environmental pollution, weaken the reverse containment of environmental pollution to economic development, and play an exemplary and leading role. The digital economy is a new engine to accelerate economic development and a new idea to promote social high-quality green development. Finally, according to the apparent influence path of this paper, the government should improve the digital economy infrastructure, pay attention to the development of scientific and technological talents, consolidate the foundations of digital industrialization, use the digital economy as a key starting point for upgrading industrial structure, assist businesses in improving their level of digital technology innovation, and accelerate the transformation of digital scientific and technological achievements in various fields.\nInt.
