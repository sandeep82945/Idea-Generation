    "abstractText": "Optical spectroscopic analysis of the chemical composition of milk in its natural state is complicated by a complex colloidal structure, represented by differently sized fat and protein particles. The classical techniques of molecular spectroscopy in the visible, near-, and mid-infrared ranges carry only bulk chemical information about a sample, which usually undergoes a destructive preparation stage. The combination of Raman spectroscopy with confocal microscopy provides a unique opportunity to obtain a vibrational spectrum at any single point of the sample volume. In this study, scanning confocal Raman microscopy was applied for the first time to investigate the chemical microstructure of milk using samples of various compositions. The obtained hyperspectral images of selected planes in milk samples are represented by three-dimensional data arrays. Chemometric data analysis, in particular the method of multivariate curve resolution, has been used to extract the chemical information from complex partially overlaid spectral responses. The results obtained show the spatial distribution of the main chemical components, i.e., fat, protein, and lactose, in the milk samples under study using intuitive graphical maps. The proposed experimental and data analysis method can be used in an advanced chemical analysis of natural milk and products on its basis.",

            "text": "Rapid and reliable analysis, monitoring, and control of milk quality are important for any dairy or milk processing plant. One of them is the capability to carry out quality monitoring in real time. Numerous papers have been reported on the advantages, peculiarities, and pitfalls of using spectroscopic methods for milk quality assessment [1\u20136]. It is well known that milk is an emulsion of fat particles (globules) in milk plasma [7]. The plasma itself has a colloidal structure with different proteins (primarily whey protein and casein) and minerals in water. The protein molecules tend to form small particles called micelles with a characteristic size of 40\u2013300 nm. Fat globules typically range in size from 1000 to 15,000 nm; their variability depends on many biological and technological factors. Homogenization significantly reduces the average size of fat globules and also reduces their variability [8]. The surface layer of fat particles mainly consists of phospholipids, proteins, and water, and its exact composition directly influences the stability of globules [7]. Colloidal particles of milk are responsible for strong light scattering, especially observed in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. This effect used to be considered a hindrance to spectral analysis. However, as shown in recent works by authors, spectral information about the quantity of scattering milk particles can be used to determine milk fat and protein content [9\u201311]. Simplified analyzers based on image analysis [12,13] of the light scattering effect at different wavelengths have been proposed. However, further development of the spectroscopic analysis of dairy products requires careful studies of milk microstructure, i.e., the size distribution of colloidal particles, their shapes, and chemical\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2770. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062770 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2770 2 of 14\ncomposition. This information is also very important for a deeper understanding of the biochemistry of milk in general [8]. Raman spectroscopy is increasingly used for qualitative and quantitative analysis in food quality control [14\u201320]. It can be useful to analyze different types of milk (raw, pasteurized, homogenized, and skimmed) [17], as well as whole-milk powder [18]. This method was shown to be well suited for the quantification of fat [17] and total protein [14] in milk products. An advantageous combination with confocal microscopy allows laser excitation and subsequent detection of the weak Raman effect from very small sample areas, that is, with a diameter down to less than a micron. Individual spectra of bovine milk fat globules of different sizes from 1000 to 20,000 nm were obtained and studied using confocal Raman microscopy [21]. The technique of confocal microscopy in combination with Raman spectroscopy [21] or without it [22] has been successfully used to study fat globules and their membranes [22], as well as for the detection of milk adulteration [20]. The differences between human, bovine, and caprine milk fat globules can also be determined using confocal Raman microscopy [23]. No reports on using the scanning microscopy option, available in some modern devices [24], in milk analysis have been found in the literature. In this work, hyperspectral images (HSIs) of various milk samples were obtained using scanning confocal Raman microscopy and examined using multivariate data analysis (also known as chemometrics). Unlike the traditional approach, in which individual spectra of sample parts are taken and studied, HSIs are obtained for a selected scene and analyzed as a whole. This paper describes the methodological aspects of acquiring and analyzing the microscopic HSIs of milk and reports on practical results obtained for several representative samples of different compositions."

            "text": "Raman spectroscopy measures a very weak effect of inelastic scattering that accompanies laser-induced excitation of molecules. The Raman effect is related to changes in the polarizability of molecules due to the vibration energies of functional groups [25], which results in a shift of the photon energies from the frequency of the excitation source. The major advantage of Raman spectroscopy is its ability to obtain a chemical fingerprint of a sample that contains fundamental frequencies from the mid-infrared range by means of visible and NIR light, which is transmitted by glass materials, and it has a higher energy and deeper penetration [25]. In confocal Raman microscopy, the excitation light is focused by a microscope optical system into a spot of down to 1 \u00b5m size, allowing obtaining the spectra of very small areas, thus reflecting the local chemical composition of microstructural elements of inhomogeneous samples [26]. The microscope in this case is supplemented with a high-precision motorized sample stage. It allows two-dimensional scanning of the sample to obtain the individual spectra in the chosen exact locations or an entire HSI for a pre-defined plane within a sample. The preprocessed spectra of the milk components (Table 1) are shown in Figure 1. It should be noted that although the spectra, hereinafter called \u2018fat\u2019 (F8), \u2018protein\u2019 (E4), and \u2018lactose\u2019 (MO1), contain a mixture of signals, they correspond to the maximum of the relative concentration of the corresponding component in the sample. A preliminary interpretation of the spectra has shown several important signals. The peak at 1144 cm\u20131 (polysaccharides C\u2013O bond stretching [27]) should be attributed to lactose, and it has the highest relative intensity in the MO1 sample medium. Two other characteristic peaks of lactose occur at 934 cm\u22121 and 1097 cm\u22121, associated with the C\u2013C and C\u2013O vibrations [27]. A standalone peak at 1309 cm\u20131 is present in all spectra in Figure 1, because it belongs to the twisting vibrations of the common CH2 group [17,18,20,21]. A few overlapping peaks are observed in the range from 2800 cm\u20131 to 3000 cm\u20131. The intensive peak at 2865 cm\u20131 can be assigned to the symmetric C\u2013H stretching vibrations of CH2 [17,18,20,21], mainly of fatty acids. This conclusion is confirmed by the highest intensity of this signal in the F8 spectrum,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2770 3 of 14\ntaken within the fat globule. The peak at 2902 cm\u20131 is the strongest in the spectrum of MO1, and therefore, it can be caused by the C\u2013H stretching of the eight methine groups of lactose [27]. No clear and selective peak of proteins was found. Although the weak peak around 1670 cm\u22121 could belong to the amide I bands of protein [18], it can hardly be seen\nbelow the stronger signal of fatty acids that occurs in the same region [28].\nTable 1.

            "text": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method for exploring multivariate datasets that have significant collinearity, such as spectral data [30]. Visual investigation of intensity maps for individual spectral variables is a very powerful research tool, if the spectra have clear, non-overlapping peaks for each of the chemical components. Signal overlap resulting from insufficient spectral or spatial resolution, which is a common situation in the spectral analysis of complex mixtures, strongly complicates the data analysis and can even lead to wrong conclusions. Effective use of spectral information for better interpretation results can be reached by the application of factor spaces and projection techniques provided by the arsenal of chemometrics. PCA is a common and natural tool for the exploratory analysis of multivariate data. PCA performs a decomposition of the spectral data, such as HSIs, into a linear combination of principal components. The PCs can then be investigated and interpreted one by one. As described in Section 3.4.1, the investigation of PCA results obtained for HSI can be performed using images of the scores carrying spatial information and line plots of the loadings (spectral information) for individual PCs. Figure 4 shows the scores and loadings for the first three PCs calculated from the HSI of Sample F1. The results obtained for Sample F4 are very similar and will not be shown. The loadings in this case are the variable weights: each wavelength contributes to a particular PC. The scores are data projections for individual PCs. The higher the absolute intensity of the variable in loadings (values along the wavenumber axis), the higher its contribution to the pixel intensities in the score image. Therefore, if a loading plot has a spectrum-like pattern that has specific spectral features of a particular component, the scores can be similarly interpreted as a concentration map of the respective component.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16\n2.3. rincipal o ponent nalysis and Spectral nmixing\nri ci al co o e t a al sis ( ) is a powerful method for exploring multivariate\natasets t at a e sig ifica t collinearity, s ch as spectral data [30].

The score image supports this assumption very well by revealing a contrast image of the fat globules (including the optical tweezers effect for smaller particles). The image closely resembles that obtained for the peak at 2865 cm\u20131 (Figure 3). The results for the second and third PCs are more difficult to interpret. PC2 and PC3 in Figure 4 explain the residual variance in the data, which is left after subtracting the variance captured by previous components. PC2 loadings contain negative peaks, the first of which is typical for fat and observed at 1670 cm\u20131. The peak at 1460 cm\u20131 exists for all three milk components. The loading plot for PC2 shows various spectral features indicating its relation to different milk components. The area of C-H stretching vibrations between 2800 cm\u20131 and 3000 cm\u20131 differs partially. Two positive peaks at 2865 cm\u20131 and 2902 cm\u20131 and a negative signal around 2960 cm\u20131 can point to structural differences of aliphatic groups included in fat and protein molecules. All peaks characteristic for fat (Section 3.4.1) are reasonably present in PC1 loadings. The respective score image for PC2 exhibits higher intensity values on the edge of fat globules including the area, where the globules contact with each other. These facts can be explained by the presence of a stabilizing protein-based membrane around the globule [22]. The third PC looks very noisy and experiences the largest contribution from the broad water absorbance at the high-wavenumber part of the spectra. PCA is quite efficient in revealing all kinds of systematic variation in spectral data, e.g., groups, trends, and outliers. However, PCs are abstract factors that do not necessarily have any physical or chemical interpretation."

This can be achieved by using prior knowledge of the system, expressed in terms of constraints used by the resolution algorithm. Figure 5 presents resolved spectra and concentration maps obtained using SIMPLISMA curve resolution for Sample F1. The first resolved spectrum and HSI (C1 in Figure 5A) closely resemble the fat spectrum (F8 in Figure 1) and first PC loadings (Figure 4A). The concentration map for C1 is also very similar to both the PC1 scores and the raw intensity map for the peak at 2865 cm\u20131 (Figure 3C). The resolved spectra for the other two components in Figure 5B,C look similar to each other, as well as to the spectrum of Sample E4 in Figure 1 (combination of protein and lactose). It should also be noted that the concentration maps for C2 and C3 look complementary, so that C3 explains the residual variation after removing the contribution of C1 and C2.

These facts can be explained by the presence of a stabilizing protein-based membrane around the globule [22]. The third PC looks very noisy and experiences the largest contribution from the broad water absorbance at the high-wavenumber part of the spectra. PCA is quite efficient in revealing all kinds of systematic variation in spectral data, e.g., groups, trends, and outliers. However, PCs are abstract factors that do not necessarily have any physical or chemical interpretation. 2.4. Multivariate Curve Resolution Spectral unmixing [31,32] can tackle the above drawbacks of PCA by performing similar linear data decomposition, but results in the latent variables having direct chemical interpretation, i.e., pure-component spectra and complementary concentration maps. This can be achieved by using prior knowledge of the system, expressed in terms of constraints used by the resolution algorithm.\nFigure 5 presents resolved spectra and concentration maps obtained using SIM-\nPLISMA curve resolution for Sample F1. The first resolved spectrum and HSI (C1 in Fig-\nure 5A) closely resemble the fat spectrum (F8 in Figure 1) and first PC loadings (Figure\n4A). The concentration map for C1 is also very similar to both the PC1 scores and the raw\nintensity map for the peak at 2865 cm\u20131 (Figure 3C). The resolved spectra for the other two\ncomponents in Figure 5B,C look similar to each other, as well as to the spectrum of Sample\nE4 in Figure 1 (combination of protein and lactose).\nFigure 5.

For the representation and data analysis, the spectra were limited to the region of 400\u20133600 cm\u22121.

Individual spectra were obtained by focusing the laser beam at various points of an enlarged area of the sample. Hyperspectral images were acquired by a point-bypoint scanning of a selected plane within the sample. The scanning depth and sample area for hyperspectral analysis (about 60 \u00d7 60 \u00b5m) were preliminary chosen by visual investigation under a 50\u00d7-magnification objective. Exact positioning and the main analysis were performed through a 63\u00d7/1.2 W objective. Although only four milk types (Table 1) were used in this study, each of them was analyzed many times by taking a new drop for the microspectroscopic measurement. A variable size of the scanning area for HSI was used depending on the sample. For the HSI discussed here, the image sizes were: 15 \u00d7 15 \u00b5m for F1 and 16 \u00d7 13 \u00b5m for F4. The most representative spectra and HSIs were selected for the discussion. Data were acquired using instrumental software (WITec Project, version 2.08). Prior to the data analysis, the spectra were preprocessed. Cosmic spikes (narrow intensive peaks in Raman spectra caused by high-energy photons hitting the highly sensitive CCD detector) were eliminated using an advanced median filter [34,35]. Baseline was corrected using an automated asymmetric least-squares (AsLS) algorithm [36]. The spectral noise was reduced by applying a Savitzky\u2013Golay filter [37]. Spectral intensity variations (caused by the random nature of the Raman signal in a non-homogeneous medium) were eliminated at the final step of the preprocessing by means of normalization to the unit area by dividing each variable by the sum of absolute values of all selected variables for the given spectrum [38,39]. Data preprocessing algorithms were implemented in a homemade script for MATLAB by MathWorks Inc. (Natick, MA, USA). The preprocessing parameters (if any) were optimized manually by visual investigation of spectra and hyperspectral data."

            "text": "3.4.1. Principal Component Analysis\nPCA [30] was used for the initial exploratory analysis of the internal data structure of hyperspectral Raman images. PCA helps to estimate the data complexity in terms of the main A factors called principal components (PCs). PCA starts from the decomposition of raw data matrix X (N \u00d7 M) into two complementary matrices of scores T (N \u00d7 A) and loadings P (M \u00d7 A):\nX = TPT + E (1)\nThe product TPT is a projection of the data into a new space of principal components. The matrix E (N \u00d7 M) of residuals contains irrelevant information (the noise) that stays outside the PC-space. The matrix of scores T contains the main information about the samples, i.e., HSI pixels in our case. Therefore, the values of orthogonal score vectors ti (i from 1 to A) composing T can be represented as pseudo-color images suitable for interpreting the portion of variance explained by the respective PC. On the other hand, the loadings P contain the coordinates of the unit vectors of PC-axes in the initial X-variable space. The loading vectors pi being represented as line plots along the spectral axis of wavenumbers carry interpretable\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2770 11 of 14\ninformation on the spectral features behind the PC-factors. Therefore, the score plots show a relationship among the HSI pixels, projected to the PC-space, whereas the loadings reveal the influence (or weight) of original variables. Joint use of the score and loading plots is an efficient tool for exploring patterns and trends in complex multivariate data, as well as the relationship between the objects and variables. To apply PCA to HSIs the hypercube should be unfolded into a matrix (W\u00b7H \u00d7 M), where the rows are pixels and the columns are wavenumbers. After PCA decomposition, the matrix of scores can be refolded by giving the spatial relationship back to the values of scores.\n3.4.2. Multivariate Curve Resolution (Spectral Unmixing)\nSpectral unmixing or multivariate curve resolution (MCR) is stated for a group of methods aiming at the decomposition of original spectral data matrix X (N \u00d7 M) into the spectra of pure chemical components and a corresponding concentration map [40]. Assuming that the original spectra can be described by the bilinear additive model, the decomposition can be written in matrix form (Equation (2)):\nX = CST + E (2)\nwhere S (M \u00d7 A) is a matrix of resolved pure-component spectra, C (N \u00d7 A) is a matrix of concentration values, and E (N \u00d7 M) is an error matrix. For the hyperspectral data, concentration matrix C can be refolded into a three-way array (H \u00d7 W \u00d7 A), where A is the number of pure components, and represented as concentration maps, i.e., pseudo-color images, where the color gradient is used to show relative concentrations of a selected pure component for each pixel (similar to the score images in PCA, Section 3.4.1). The bilinear additive model expression (Equation (2)) resembles PCA decomposition (Equation (1)). However, in the former case, there is no orthogonal requirement to the matrix S and the principle of maximum variation does not apply. Finding C and S from the mixture spectra X is an inverse problem, and in the general case, it gives a range of solutions. Two methods of mathematical spectral unmixing were used in this study. One of them, called simple-to-use interactive self-modeling mixture analysis (SIMPLISMA) by Windig et al. [31,32,41], is based on the so-called pure (or purer) spectral variables, i.e., the wavenumbers mainly influenced by only one of the mixture components. Finding the purest variables one by one, one can reconstruct the pure-component spectra using the least-squares regression algorithm. Another approach to solving the problem of spectral unmixing is the alternating least-squares\u2013multivariate curve resolution (ALS-MCR) algorithm. It makes use of initial estimates of the pure spectra (for instance, known spectra of the components or PCA loadings). The solution is found iteratively until the best fit to spectral data is attained [42]. To reduce the ambiguity of the ALS-MCR solution, non-negativity constraints were applied to the spectra and concentrations [43].\n3.4.3. Clustering of Spectra\nClustering is a multivariate classification algorithm. In the present study, it was used to arrange HSI spectra into several groups (clusters) according to their similarity. Euclidean distance between spectra in a multidimensional spectral space was used as a similarity criterion. The idea of using clustering was to find spectra of similar objects (for instance, pixels within fat globules) without a priori knowledge, and combine them together for further analysis. One of the simplest clustering algorithms called K-means [33] was used in this study. This algorithm aims at finding K clusters in the spectral space so that the sum of squared distances between the mean spectrum and all individual spectra within a particular cluster is minimal. The algorithm is iterative and works as follows:\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2770 12 of 14\n(1) Assign K-mean points (centroids of clusters) in the spectral space randomly. (2) Calculate distances from each spectrum to each mean point. (3) Assign each spectrum to the proper cluster by selecting a minimal distance. (4) Calculate a new mean for each cluster by averaging the assigned spectra.\nSteps 2\u20134 are repeated until the convergence is reached, i.e., when the cluster mean positions stop changing. The K-means clustering algorithm, applied to HSI spectra in this study, results in new cluster maps, where the pixels are colored depending on a particular cluster they belong to. The unfolding/refolding procedure (as in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2) is applied to analyze three-dimensional data using the K-means algorithm. Moreover, the mean spectra of the corresponding clusters can be interpreted in terms of the chemical composition of the respective image elements."

The main components of milk responsible for its nutritional value can be clearly identified in the Raman spectra. The problem of signal overlap in the spectra can be overcome by mathematical spectral unmixing based on chemometric methods of curve resolution. This study has proved that the correct application of chemometrics can significantly increase the value of hyperspectral Raman imaging, particularly for dairy analysis. The ALS-MCR algorithm with non-negativity constraints has shown to be well suited for the analysis of individual components. HSIs can be deconvoluted into colored spectral maps indicating areas reach of fats, proteins, and lactose. Such representation facilitates qualitative microstructural analysis of various samples. Research efforts should be aimed at further improvement of the method. Thus, the higher magnification of the microscope and the respective higher image resolution are expected to enable the analysis of individual protein micelles and other particles, such as somatic cells. The use of three-dimensional hyperspectral Raman images should help to obtain a detailed description of the fat globule structure at the molecular level, particularly to investigate the structure of its stabilizing surface membrane. Further improvement of the sample preparation technique and data analysis algorithms will make it possible to identify minor components of milk. Qualitative and quantitative characterization of the liquid media is necessary to obtain a complete chemical description of the milk microstructure.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.B.; methodology, A.B.; investigation, A.S.; data curation, A.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.B. and A.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.B.; supervision, A.B.; funding acquisition, A.B.
