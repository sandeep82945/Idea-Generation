    "abstractText": "Objective: Burnout has been recognized as a serious health problem. Nurses as a professional group are at a high risk of burnout occurrence, especially when facing burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite evidence that higher job demands lead to burnout, there is less known about the indirect effect of job demands and resources on burnout via surface acting. Using the JD-R framework, this study examined how job demands and resources affected burnout among Polish nurses and whether these relationships are mediated by surface acting and moderated by coping with the workload.",

Nurses as a professional group are at a high risk of burnout occurrence, especially when facing burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite evidence that higher job demands lead to burnout, there is less known about the indirect effect of job demands and resources on burnout via surface acting. Using the JD-R framework, this study examined how job demands and resources affected burnout among Polish nurses and whether these relationships are mediated by surface acting and moderated by coping with the workload.\nMaterials and Methods: A sample of 270 nurses from the biggest hospital in Southern Poland filled out an online questionnaire at the time between the fourth and the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. The Polish adaptations of Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Organizational Constraints Scale (OCS), Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale (ICAWS), Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS), and Emotional Labor Scale (ELS) were used. Mediation and moderation analyses were carried out in the SPSS macroPROCESS.\nResults: Surface acting partially mediated the positive association between organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict at work and burnout, as well as the negative association between the perceived organizational support and burnout. Coping with workload moderated the direct effect of organizational constraints on burnout via surface acting.\nConclusion: The findings enrich the knowledge of the mediating and moderating mechanisms to explain the association between job demands, resources and burnout among nurses. There have been proposed interventions concerning increasing organizational support, effective emotional regulation of management education and psychological training regarding adequate coping strategies which could help reduce or prevent the occurrence of burnout in this professional group.\nKeywords: JD-R model, nurses, emotional labor, burnout, Poland, COVID-19\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931391"

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes occupational burnout as a result of chronic stress experienced in the workplace consisting of three dimensions: the feeling of loss, negative feelings concerning work and the mental distance toward it, as well as reduced professional effectiveness (1). Nurses as a professional group are highly subject to burnout due to, first of all, direct contact with patients who require emotional involvement, while also dealing with various possible situations, including the patients\u2019 suffering, fear or aggression (2, 3) and secondly, the relatively low position in the working organization such as a hospital and tasks they are generally assigned to Lasalvia et al. (4). Thus, nurses are known to be at higher risk for the development of burnout compared to other medical occupations (3). A study that examined the prevalence of burnout among 1,329 medical professionals from five different professional fields found that nurses experience its highest level (5). Similarly, the results of a systematic review of Khamisa et al. (6) showed that high levels of work-related stress, burnout, and poor health are common among nurses. Woo et al. (7), in turn, based on 113 studies included for systematic review and 61 studies considered in the meta-analysis showed that 11.23% of nurses worldwide experienced burnout symptoms.\nThe situation of Polish nurses in terms of burnout seems to be even worse as the study of Uchmanowicz et al. (8) reported increasing levels of burnout and worsening job satisfaction among members of this professional group. Additionally, Poland has one of the lowest indicators of practicing nurses per 1,000 residents among the OECD countries. In 2015, it was by comparison only 5.2; whereas this indicator for Germany was 13.3, Denmark\u201316.7 and Switzerland\u201318 (9). The high average age of nurses in Poland was estimated to be around 52 years of age, which, when combined with the high percentage of nurses dissatisfied with their working conditions leads them to the feeling of work overload and high levels of occupational stress and burnout (10, 11).\nThe already high prevalence of burnout among nurses in ordinary times became an even more serious concern during the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the emergence of new stressors at their workplace, such as the high death rate of COVID-19 patients, the increased number of overtime shifts, the fear of not getting the appropriate medical equipment (including personal protective equipment) or the possibility of COVID-19 transmission and the infection of family members (12, 13). According to a systematic review by Galanis et al. (14), nurses have experienced high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion in this professional group led to 34.1%, while depersonalization amounted to 12.6% and the lack of personal accomplishment totaled 15.2%.\nAccording to the Job Demands-Resources theory (JD-R), occupational burnout is a long-term effect of stress caused by prolonged excessive job demands and insufficient resources to deal with these job demands effectively (15\u201318). Burnout in this perspective consists of two components, named exhaustion and disengagement from work (19). The exhaustion dimension refers to feelings of physical fatigue and overload with relation to work\n(20), while the dimension of disengagement refers to the distance from work and negative attitudes toward their own work (19). In addition, it is assumed that job resources buffer the potentially negative effects of excessive job demands on employee health and well-being (21, 22).\nDifferent studies conducted among nurses which applied JD-R theory confirmed that such stressors, as excessive workload (23, 24) third-party aggression (23, 25), emotional and organizational demands (26, 27) are related to burnout among this professional group. However, the amount of research which used JD-R model to examine direct relationships as well as indirect via emotional labor between such fundamental stressors for nursing staff as organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict at work and burnout is scarce (28, 29). Thus, our study is an attempt to fill this gap in the scientific literature.\nOrganizational constraints are related to situations or things that prevent employees from translating ability and effort into a high level of job performance. These include faulty equipment, incomplete or poor information flow, as well as interruptions by others (30). Garcia-Arroyo et al. (31) demonstrated that organizational constraints considered from the JD-R perspective should be regarded as demands that can limit autonomy, job control, and decision-making capacity, generating stress, and burnout. Similarly, using JD-R framework, Baka (32) showed that organizational constraints were associated with job burnout and depression among Polish teachers. In turn, interpersonal conflicts at work are defined as a negative interpersonal encounter disturbing team cohesion and characterized by a contentious exchange, hostility or aggression (30). This demand has been acknowledged as a persistent problem and one that is on the rise among nursing personnel (33). In the study of Lanz and Bruk-Lee (34) conducted among US nurses, interpersonal conflict at workplace predicted both burnout and turnover intention. Similarly, interpersonal conflicts were found to be positively related to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and negatively in terms of personal accomplishment among Emergency Room-nurses in Spain (35).\nIn the current study interpersonal conflicts are considered in the context of theory of social relations which seems to be relevant within the context of hospital as a work organization (36). Interpersonal conflict with coworkers is likely to affect adversely nurse\u2019s psychological health because relationships among coworkers are based on a communal sharing model of interpersonal relations. In turn, interpersonal conflict with nurse\u2019s supervisor leads to negative feelings and cognitions regarding one\u2019s job because an employee\u2019s relationship with supervisor is based on an authority ranking model in the Fiske\u2019s theory (36). In the current study, we do not distinguish conflicts regarding coworkers or conflict between worker and supervisor and treat them together. Both organizational constraints and interpersonal conflicts at work are viewed as hindrance stressors because they serve as barriers for nurses to goal accomplishment (37). Based on mentioned studies, we formulate hypothesis 1:\nH1: Job demands will have direct effects on burnout with organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict at work having a positive association with burnout.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931391\nWith regard to job resources, social support has been acknowledged as an important resource which influences of an individual\u2019s perception of threatening situation at work (38). Organizational support has been recently recognized as a crucial job resource in nursing staff (39). The high level of organizational support has been acknowledged as a factor which reduced burnout among nurses in China (40). Moreover, Escriba-Aguir and Pe\u2019rez-Hoyos (41) reported that low supervisory social support was related to higher emotional exhaustion in nurses, whereas in their longitudinal study, Van der Ploeg and Kleber (42) found the lack of supervisory social support at the baseline to be related to higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, while also to lower personal accomplishment in the follow up. Accordingly, we present hypothesis 2:\nH2: Organizational support as a job resource will be directly negatively associated with burnout.\nBaka and Prusik (24) indicated that currently researchers who apply JD-R model are looking for potential mediational variables that would deepen the understanding of mechanisms regulating the relationship between job demands and burnout. One of them is emotional labor which recently has been attracting attention as a factor that relates to burnout and turnover intention among nurses (43). Emotional labor refers to the effort involved in managing feelings when the work role specifies that particular emotions should be displayed and others should be hidden (44). Healthcare staff, especially nurses, are required to deliver compassionate care to the patients in frequently challenging working conditions. However, demands of emotional labor occur when a nurse has to change her actual emotions in order to present emotions that conform to the rules and expectation of the job (44). In the case of demanding and stressful situations such as organizational difficulties or interpersonal conflict at work, nurses adopt surface acting in order to display the emotions required for their role, albeit their true feelings remain unchanged (emotional dissonance) or their negative feelings are simply suppressed (emotional suppression) (45, 46). Since engaging in surface acting requires higher levels of self-control, this kind of emotional labor has been found to be significantly associated with burnout and depressive symptoms among nurses (47). For example, the study conducted by Gilardi et al. (25) which applied JD-R framework, revealed that surface acting mediated the relationship between patients and/or their relatives\u2019 aggression and burnout among nurses in Italy. In line with that research, we decided to focus especially on surface acting as a detrimental process leading to burnout among nurses. We would like to distinguish factors which are positively and negatively related to surface acting in order to broaden knowledge concerning this kind of emotional labor and, in effect, gain an opportunity to counteract it. We assume that organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict at work as hindrance stressors provoke emotional dissonance/emotional suppression considered as surface acting because the negative emotions that are triggered, may be appraised as inconsistent with the interiorized role of nurse as an empathetic healthcare worker (48). Thus, in the next hypothesis we expect that:\nH3: Job demands will indirectly affect burnout via surface acting, indicating the mediating effect of surface acting on the relation between organizational constraints, interpersonal conflict at work and burnout.\nWith respect to the relationship between perceived organizational support and emotional labor, previous studies demonstrated that the high level of organizational support leads to high levels of effort in deep acting, whereas in the case of feeling a low level of organizational support, nurses simply choose a less effortful way, i.e., surface acting, to perform emotional labor (49, 50). Therefore, we expect that higher perceived organizational support will be associated with lower surface acting and, in turn, with lower burnout level among nurses. Accordingly, we present hypothesis 4:\nH4: Surface acting will mediate the relationship between organizational support and burnout.\nApart from job resources, the JD-R model recognizes personal resources, for instance coping strategies, which are expected to buffer the undesirable impact of job demands on strain (21). Coping behavior is defined as constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external or internal demands that are appraised as exceeding the resources of the person (51). In the current study, coping with workload has been considered as a kind of proactive coping method defined as self-determined goal setting behavior that motivates people to overcome difficulties in order to achieve desirable personal outcomes and growth. In essence, proactive coping consists of the accumulation of various resources and the attainment of skills such as organization, planning, goal-setting, and mental simulation (52). Negative association between proactive coping and burnout has been reported in previous studies (53, 54). Moreover, the buffering effect of proactive coping on relationship between work stress and burnout has been confirmed in the study of Greenglass (55). Thus, in our last hypothesis we expect that:\nH5: Coping with workload will moderate the direct path in the mediation process of organizational constraints on burnout through surface acting. These relations will be weaker for nurses with higher capabilities of coping with workload."

            "text": "There are no studies exploring the burnout level among Polish nurses specifically during COVID-19 pandemic so far. However, according to the research by Szwamel et al. (56) which encompassed all healthcare workers in Poland, 71.63% (356) of the respondents presented high and moderate levels of emotional exhaustion, 71.43% (355) reported low and moderate job satisfaction levels, whereas 40.85% (203) displayed high and moderate levels of depersonalization. The current research has been conducted during the late wave of COVID-19 pandemic, which means that the organization of work of nurses and the level of job demands were different from traditional ones (57).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931391\nThe late wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Poland has taken place in the end of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022. Despite of full access to vaccination, the situation paradoxically seemed to be quite dramatic, especially because of very high rate of death due to COVID-19. For example, on 29 December has been reported the highest rate of death during the whole pandemic period \u2013 795 persons passed away this day (58). Moreover, since January until February 2022 the number of confirmed cases with COVID19 has increased four times, i.e., from 11,775 on 5th January to 45,800 cases reported on 5th February. However, the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 during this period decreased (59). There is insufficient amount of research conducted during the late wave of pandemic concerning mental health of nurses therefore our study could be regarded as a contribution to the current knowledge."

The inclusion criteria applied related to a nurse and female gender of the respondent. Participation in the research was completely voluntary and anonymous.\nAt the beginning of the survey, the participants were informed about the general purpose of the study, while also the fact that the study is non-invasive and the results would be analyzed anonymously. It was also explained that they could withdraw from the study by closing the web browser without their responses being recorded. The participants provided their written consent prior to participating in this study. The contact details of the person responsible for the project was provided in case they wished to obtain additional information or had any questions concerning the study.\nThe final research group consisted of 311 nurses. Due to incomplete responses, or the failure to meet the inclusion criteria, 41 people were removed from the analysis. The complete data obtained from 270 participants was then included in the statistical analysis. The average completion time of the survey was 20 mins.

            "text": "This study explored how job demands and resources affected burnout among nurses and whether these relationships are mediated by surface acting and moderated by coping with workload. Our findings turned out to be consistent with the JD-R theory, thus confirming hypotheses 1 and 2.\nThe health-impairment process was indicated by the significant positive association between organizational\nconstraints, interpersonal conflict at work and burnout among nurses. These findings are consistent with previous studies supporting the positive relationship between job demands and burnout in terms of both organizational constraints (26, 70) and conflicts at work (35, 71). As our results pointed out, interpersonal conflicts are stronger significantly associated with burnout. It could be explained by notion that conflicts at work, which are situations that prevent employees from translating ability and effort into high levels of job performance, are associated with strong negative emotions, such as anxiety, hostility or frustration, leading to low job satisfaction and organizational deviance and, consequently burnout (72). In addition, this finding seems to confirm the assumptions of the theory of social relations (36) in which interpersonal conflicts with coworkers and supervisor are related to poor personal psychological outcomes of an employee. Moreover organizational constraints turned out to be also significantly associated with higher level of burnout among nurses. As previous studies stated, a lack of adequate resources including the lack of supplies, lack of equipment, broken equipment and unavailable resources have been shown to be among the top workplace stressors in several countries (73), leading to occupational burnout among the nursing personnel (74).\nWith respect to the relationship between organizational support considered to be a job resource and burnout, we found its significant negative association. This finding is in line with a previous study according to which the perception of a pleasant working environment and the sense of receiving organizational care could reduce burnout among medical staff (50). Although the relationship between JD-R and burnout is well established in subject-related literature (22), most studies were conducted in the Western countries, whereas our results show that this association is consistent outside the Western context as well."

In other words, higher organizational constraints and conflicts at work are associated with an increase in surface acting, which is in turn associated with an increase in burnout. This finding is consistent with a previous study of Gilardi et al. (25) in which, using the JD-R model, they confirmed the mediating role of surface acting between job demands and burnout among Italian nurses. It could be explained by notion that the nurses\u2019 efforts to manage their emotions that are specifically triggered by the lack of equipment, as well as interpersonal conflicts at the workplace activate a resource depleting process, which leads to emotional exhaustion and the adoption of a strategy of disengagement. We assume that both these stressful situations provoke emotional dissonance because the negative emotions which emerge are appraised as inappropriate for the interiorized role of a health care worker. This dissonance generates a state of tension because nurses experience a person\u2013role conflict (48).

Several explanations for such an effect could be proposed. As Chou et al. (49) showed, when supervisor support is available, nurses are more capable of availing of deep acting which, in turn, is associated with a decrease in occupational burnout among a professional group of nurses (76). Goussinsky and Livne (77) suggested that support from the supervisor - a key component of organizational support - encourages the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 931391\nFIGURE 2 | Research model.\ninternalization of work roles and leads workers to engage more in deep acting.

Model with covariates included (work experience, workplace, education level, marital status, and number of children). For participants with high CWW level, OC had no significant effect on burnout.

This is consistent with the buffering impact of job and personal resources on the relationship between job demands and burnout postulated by the JD-R model (21). In the case of high organizational constraints, nurses characterized by greater abilities to cope with workload reported lower burnout compared with nurses with a decreased level of CWW. This finding is in accordance with the study of Chang and Chan (78) conducted among Taiwanese nurses that examined the buffering effect of proactive coping with relation to burnout. In line with this study (78), we assume that individuals with a greater capacity to cope with workload, considered by us to be a kind of proactive coping, are future-oriented and know how to utilize the acquired resources to face distress before they begin to feel emotionally exhausted. In the case of workload which is a big stressor, proactive nurses often make efforts to plan in advance which enables them to deal more easily with multiple work responsibilities. Similarly, it could be assumed that in the case of organizational constraints, they are more likely to build up resources that serve as buffers against stress deriving from, e.g., inadequate training or lack of supplies, and consequently, against the occurrence of burnout.\nIt is worth mentioning a few contributions of our study. First, to the best of our knowledge, so far no studies have investigated the mediating role of surface acting between organizational constraints and interpersonal conflict at work (job demands) which are regarded as very important stressors among nursing\nstaff (28, 29). Thus, our study filled this gap in subject-related literature by using the JD-R framework. Second, we pointed out, that not only stressors related to interpersonal relations are associated with surface acting, and consequently, with higher burnout among nurses (25), but also organizational constraints have similar detrimental effect. Third, we included coping with workload considered as a personal resource which turned out to be significant moderator in relationship organizational constraints \u2013 burnout. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the issue of coping with workload as a moderating variable in the association between job demands and burnout. This finding has practical implications by emphasizing the importance of psychological training which should enhance the capability of coping with workload in this professional group. Fourth, our study supported validity of the Job DemandsResources theory also in Eastern Europe, while most studies using this theoretical framework have been conducted in Western countries. Fifth, since there is insufficient amount of research carried out during the late wave of COVID-19 pandemic, our study could be regarded as a contribution to the current knowledge regarding mental health of nurses."

Firstly, our sample consisted of nurses from only one hospital and only females, therefore future studies may take into account a more representative sample of nurses to draw better conclusions about JD-R, burnout and surface acting. We recommend conducting studies on bigger samples and analyse nurses, including both females and males, recruited from many Polish hospitals, located both in big cities, as well as small cities. Secondly, since we analyzed cross-sectional data, our results should be interpreted with caution, as we reported associations between job demands, resources and burnout, yet we cannot confirm causal relations. This limitation may be addressed by the collection and analysis of longitudinal data, e.g., data obtained during pandemic and in post-pandemic period. Thirdly, in our research model we did not include any personal traits, such as, for instance self-efficacy or ego-resiliency, which, according to research, affect JD-R and burnout among nurses (23, 25). Thus, in the future it may be worth exploring personal traits and their role with relation to burnout in order to get a more comprehensive overview of the well-being of Polish nurses. Since these variables were not included in our model, they may have unknown effects in terms of the estimates from our analysis. Fourthly, all study variables were measured using self-report questionnaires, which may lead to potential bias and could affect the accuracy of the assessment, thus future studies may combine self-report questionnaires with more objective measurements."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "This is the first study relating to the burnout level of Polish nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings enrich our knowledge on the mediating and moderating mechanisms in order to explain the association between job demands, resources and burnout among nurses during the latest wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We confirmed that job demands, such as interpersonal conflict at work and organizational constraints significantly increase burnout, both directly and indirectly by means of surface acting, whereas, job resources, such as organizational support, decrease it. Moreover, perceived organizational support has a direct negative impact on burnout, as well as an indirect effect via a decrease in surface acting.\nOur results suggest that when nurses experience high job demands, strengthening organizational support and coping with workload could help alleviate burnout. It is important especially in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, during which many nurses perceived their workplace as potentially harmful and dangerous. As previous studies reported, organizational support\nduring COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower level of anxiety (79), lower burnout occurrence (50) and increased work engagement among nurses (80). Moreover, as we showed, organizational support could reduce burnout in nurses via a decrease in surface acting. Thus, interventions that provide effective emotional regulation management education, as well as psychological training concerning adequate coping strategies could help reduce or prevent the occurrence of burnout among nurses as well as decrease the negative effect of insufficient perceived organizational support. In the context of the COVID19 burden and its mental consequences, it is worth mentioning that hospital organizations that nurses work in should provide organizational support, for instance, work allocation and flexible work hours, in order to alleviate burnout among this professional group (81)."
