    "abstractText": "Mucorales species cause debilitating, life-threatening sinopulmonary diseases in immunocompromised patients and penetrating wounds in trauma victims. Common antifungal agents against mucormycosis have significant toxicity and are often ineffective. To evaluate treatments against mucormycosis, sporangiospores are typically used for in vitro assays and in pre-clinical animal models of pulmonary infections. However, in clinical cases of wound mucormycosis caused by traumatic inoculation, hyphal elements found in soil are likely the form of the inoculated organism. In this study, Galleria mellonella larvae were infected with either sporangiospores or hyphae of Rhizopus arrhizus and Lichtheimia corymbifera. Hyphal infections resulted in greater and more rapid larval lethality than sporangiospores, with an approximate 10\u201316-fold decrease in LD50 of hyphae for R. arrhizus (p = 0.03) and L. corymbifera (p = 0.001). Liposomal amphotericin B, 10 mg/kg, was ineffective against hyphal infection, while the same dosage was effective against infections produced by sporangiospores. Furthermore, in vitro, antifungal susceptibility studies show that minimum inhibitory concentrations of several antifungal agents against hyphae were higher when compared to those of sporangiospores. These findings support using hyphal elements of Mucorales species for virulence testing and antifungal drug screening in vitro and in G. mellonella for studies of wound",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, there has been an unprecedented surge in post-traumatic invasive mold infections [1,2]. Many of these cases were in wounded U.S. military personnel during the war in Afghanistan [3,4]. Fungi of the order Mucorales were the predominant cause of angio-invasive fungal infections in combat casualties [3,5\u201311]. Apophysomyces species (spp.), Saksenaea spp., Mucor spp., and Lichtheimia spp. were reported to be the predominant cause of post-traumatic mucormycosis [12\u201315]. Rhizopus spp. are responsible for more than 50% of all mucormycosis cases in the respiratory tract or central nervous system worldwide and are often found in cutaneous wounds [16,17]. While sporangiospores are assumed to be the inoculating form of the Mucorales in sinopulmonary disease, we hypothesized that hyphae found in soil and biofilm matrices\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 958. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9100958 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 958 2 of 13\non stone, wood, glass, and organic debris are responsible for infection in post-traumatic wounds [15]. Some observations in the available literature support this rationale. One such observation is that substantial quantities of sporangiospores are required to establish cutaneous infection in animal models [18\u201325]. Additionally, Apophysomyces spp. and Saksenaea spp. do not readily produce sporangiospores [26,27]. Therefore, we propose that mucormycosis is more readily induced by inoculation with hyphal elements rather than sporangiospores, and that this form of inoculum results in greater virulence and resistance to antifungal therapy. Combat wound-related mucormycosis is a highly aggressive disease frequently refractory to antifungal therapy and often managed by amputation [9,10]. The therapeutic armamentarium of antifungal agents for the treatment of mucormycosis is limited to amphotericin B (AmB), isavuconazole, and posaconazole. However, these agents have a low frequency of therapeutic success in treating mucormycosis, particularly in combat-related trauma. Therefore, new therapeutic solutions are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes of this frequently fatal and debilitating infection in both civilian and military patient populations. Preclinical models should be established to understand pathogenesis and develop new antifungal therapeutics for combat wound-related mucormycosis. Galleria mellonella larvae are simple invertebrate model organisms widely used to study microbial virulence and antimicrobial activity. Low cost, rapid result generation, and absence of ethical/legal considerations make these larvae very appealing to study host-pathogen interactions [28]. Recently, G. mellonella larvae have been used to establish lethal infections of multiple Mucorales species [29]. Moreover, the Galleria model of mucormycosis was validated for successful treatment with standard-of-care (SOC) antifungal agents [29,30]. However, in all published reports, sporangiospores were used as the inoculum, mimicking the infection route for sinopulmonary disease [17]. In this study, we aimed to develop Galleria mucormycosis models using hyphal elements of Mucorales strains to more accurately replicate the conditions of traumatic inoculation encountered in combat-induced injury. We chose Rhizopus arrhizus and Lichtheimia corymbifera for these studies because they cause severe wound infections and readily produce large quantities of sporangiospores. Germinated sporangiospores/hyphal elements and non-germinated sporangiospores were compared for virulence and antifungal therapy, using liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) to treat Galleria mucormycosis. Finally, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of L-AmB, AmB, and posaconazole were compared against hyphae and sporangiospores in vitro. Overall, we found that hyphae of both fungal species were significantly more virulent and resistant to L-AmB than sporangiospores in larvae mucormycosis."

The isolate of R. arrhizus (ATCC 56536) was a reference strain isolated from a postmortem lung issue of a man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the Netherlands. A recent study of this strain demonstrated virulence with a median survival time of five days for mice inoculated with 106 sporangiospores/immunocompetent mice [32]. L. corymbifera (ATCC 46771), a neotype isolated from soil in Afghanistan, is reported to be virulent in various in vitro and in vivo studies [33\u201336]. The glycerol stock of R. arrhizus was grown in Petri dishes containing Synthetic Mucor Medium Agar (SMMA) [arabinose: 4.0 g/L; asparagine: 2.0 g/L, potassium dihydrogen phosphate: 0.5 g/L, magnesium sulfate hexahydrate: 0.25 g/L, thiamine HCl: 0.5 mg/L; agar: 15 g/L). This formulation was based on a liquid medium used to obtain sporangiospores from Saksenaea vasiformis [37]. L. corymbifera was grown in petri dishes (10\u201312) containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) (Difco\u2122) at 37 \u25e6C for 7 days. Sporangiospores were washed off the plates with 10-to-15 mL of 0.9% sterile saline containing 0.05% of\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 958 3 of 13\ntween 80, followed by a gentle rub of sporangiospores with a sterile cell spreader until fully suspended. The harvested sporangiospores were filtered through a 70-\u00b5m filter to remove clumps of hyphal elements. The sporangiospore suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with sterile saline. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of 0.9% of sterile saline solution, and the concentration of sporangiospores was calculated after counting with a hemocytometer (Nexcelom Bioscience LLC). For hyphae/germling preparation, a total of 1.0 \u00d7 108\u20131.0 \u00d7 109 R. arrhizus and L. corymbifera sporangiospores were incubated in 5\u201310 mL RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under constant shaking at 150 rpm at 30 \u25e6C for 24 h. Germlings were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min, washed twice with 0.9% sterile saline, and resuspended with 5 mL of 0.9% sterile saline, and the concentration of germlings was calculated by counting with a hemocytometer. Colony forming units (CFUs) were determined 1 day prior to infection by plating 100 \u00b5L of inoculum dilutions on RPMI agar plates and incubating them overnight at 30 \u25e6C. RPMI agar plates were made by reconstituting the filter-sterilized RPMI liquid medium [16.2 g/L of RPMI-1640 powder medium (GibcoTM) (with L-glutamine, phenol red, and without sodium bicarbonate) buffered with 35 g/L of MOPS (morpholine propane sulfonic acid) and 20 g/L of glucose] into an autoclaved agar medium containing 15 g/L of agar."

            "text": "Previous studies demonstrated that some strains of R. arrhizus and L. corymbifera caused at least 30% lethality in G. mellonella when 104 sporangiospores were utilized [29]. To compare the lethality of hyphae and sporangiospores of R. arrhizus ATCC 56536 and L. corymbifera ATCC 46771, we employed inocula ranging from approximately 101 to 106 CFUs per larva. For R. arrhizus, larvae were infected with sporangiospores inocula ranging from 2.25 \u00d7 101 to 1.36 \u00d7 106 CFUs per larva, and an equal number of larvae were infected with hyphae inocula ranging from 2.5 \u00d7 101 to 1.25 \u00d7 106 CFUs per larva. Hyphal inocula resulted in a lower survival of larvae compared to sporangiospores (Figure 1A\u2013C). At Day 1 (24 h post-infection), all but the highest hyphal infectious doses showed higher mortality compared to sporangiospores (Figure 1C). By Day 5, three hyphae-infected groups contained surviving larvae, whereas four sporangiospores-infected groups contained surviving larvae. Of those groups containing survivors by Day 5, hyphal-infected larvae had a 10% (2.68 \u00d7 103 group), 60% (1.34 \u00d7 102 group), and 100% (2.50 \u00d7 101 group) survival rate, respectively, while sporangiospores-infected groups had 25% (1.88 \u00d7 104 group), 60% (1.85 \u00d7 103 group), 90% (1.45 \u00d7 102 group), and 100% (2.25 \u00d7 101 group) survival, respectively (Figure 1A,B). Dose-response curves were generated, and the LD50 values for R. arrhizus hyphae and sporangiospores were estimated to be 2.02 \u00d7 102 and 1.93 \u00d7 103 per larva, respectively (Table 1), showing an approximately 10-fold increase in hyphal virulence; these LD50 values were significantly different as measured by the estimated ratio of dose effects (p = 0.03).

For R. arrhizus sporangiospores, after 24 and 48 h of incubation, the MIC of all three antifungal agents was 2 \u00b5g/mL (Table 2). After 48 h of incubation of hyphae with posaconazole, AmB, or L\u2013AmB, the MICs were 8 \u00b5g/mL, 8 \u00b5g/mL, and greater than 16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Table 2), indicating that hyphae are less susceptible to antifungal agents. For L. corymbifera, after 24 and 48 h of incubation, the MICs of AmB, posaconazole, and L\u2013AmB against sporangiospores were 2 \u00b5g/mL, 4 \u00b5g/mL, and 4 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Hyphae were more resistant to all three antifungal agents with MICs of 8 \u00b5g/mL after 24 h and MICs greater than 16 \u00b5g/mL after 48 h of incubation (Table 2). Thus, hyphae of both R. arrhizus (ATCC 56536) and L. corymbifera (ATCC 46771) were less susceptible to AmB, L\u2013AmB, and posaconazole than sporangiospores under the in vitro conditions tested."

            "text": "Mucorales species are ubiquitous filamentous fungi found in soil and decaying organic matter [40,41]. Mucorales spp., including R. arrhizus and L. corymbifera, have been shown to form hyphal biofilms under in vitro conditions [42]. Although we are unaware of any reports on Mucorales biofilms in nature, it is plausible that such biofilms exist in various environments. For example, plant pathogenic molds readily form biofilm on various plant surfaces [43,44]. When filamentous fungi develop a biofilm, they are less susceptible to harsh conditions, including heat, cold, ultraviolet light, and three fungicides, than planktonic counterparts [45]. Thus, in addition to sporangiospores, hyphal biofilms can be an environmental source for maintaining and spreading filamentous fungi. Soil-borne Mucorales biofilms have also been proposed to be a causative agent during post-traumatic mucormycosis [15]. Apophysomyces spp. and Saksenaea spp. are extremely rare causes of respiratory infections but are the leading cause of primary cutaneous infections worldwide. In fact, these two species caused two-thirds of all angio-invasive fungal infections in U.S. casualties in Afghanistan [46]. Notably, both species are very poor sporangiospore producers [27], which we observed during our attempts to sporulate Saksenaea (data not shown). This may implicate that wound mucormycosis is caused by hyphal biofilms of Apophysomyces spp. and Saksenaea spp. rather than sporangiospores. Future studies should investigate the prevalence of Mucorales biofilms in nature and their role in traumainoculated mucormycosis. This is the first report to our knowledge to compare the virulence of sporangiospores and hyphae of species from the order Mucorales. Antifungal innate immunity in humans is largely driven by neutrophils, which can destroy hyphae via oxidative burst and nutritional immunity [47\u201351]. Neutrophils also control fungal infection via neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which entrap and expose extracellular fungi to antimicrobial peptides [52]. G. mellonella lacks adaptive immunity but mounts an innate immune and humoral response to infection that shares similarities with mammalian innate and humoral\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 958 10 of 13\nimmunity [53\u201355]. Galleria immune cells, such as plasmacytes and granulocytes, exert cellular immune response by phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation. Additionally, the humoral response, when activated, produces antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. In our study, Mucorales hyphae caused 10-to-16 times more larvae mortality than sporangiospores. Hyphae are likely more resistant to engulfment by phagocytes than sporangiospores since hyphae are generally much larger. The greater virulence of hyphae may also be understood by increased biomass in relation to innate host defense mechanisms. Antachopoulos and colleagues found that fungal biomass is a key factor affecting polymorphonuclear leukocyte-induced hyphal damage of filamentous fungi [56]. Hyphal damage decreased with increasing biomass following the sigmoid (Emax) model (median R2 = 0.87). Moreover, the metabolic activity of different species of Mucorales increases as a sigmoidal function as hyphal biomass increases [57]. These factors also would likely contribute to the increased virulence against innate host defense mechanisms of G. mellonella and in vivo resistance to antifungal agents observed with hyphae of R. arrhizus and L. corymbifera in this study. They also may contribute to devastating tissue injury and resistance to antifungal therapy observed clinically in trauma-induced wound mucormycosis. Thus, limited G. mellonella immune responses may be ineffective against hyphae. Similarly, since severe traumatic mucormycosis is also intrinsically resistant to resolution and treatment in human cases, our studies may support those primary innate antifungal responses are likely insufficient to resolve infection regardless of the organism; these questions should be investigated in future studies in higher organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are commonly used to determine the in vitro susceptibility of invasive molds to various antifungal drugs. Notably, while several reports showed no differences in MICs between sporangiospores and germinated sporangiospores in A. fumigatus, several studies identified differences in the susceptibility of sporangiospores of Mucorales species. AmB and posaconazole were reported to inhibit the metabolic activity of sporangiospores of L. corymbifera and R. arrhizus strains to a greater degree than that of hyphae [58]. Labuda et al. tested the MIC of polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins with hyphae (mycelial microcolonies) of Saksenaea dorisiae and found that hyphae were more resistant to antifungals compared to sporangiospores [59]. In fact, hyphae were resistant to all antifungals tested except terbinafine. These data also suggest that AmB and posaconazole may not be the optimal treatment against S. dorisiae hyphae. Likewise, our MIC data indicate that hyphae of L. corymbifera and R. arrhizus strains are less susceptible to AmB than sporangiospores. Since drugs target growing cells, one explanation may be that cells are killed at the germination stage when germlings actively grow and are most vulnerable. The differences in in vitro susceptibility between hyphae and sporangiospores underscore the importance of establishing standardized protocols and guidelines for performing MIC assays to accurately determine the susceptibility of Mucorales species to different antifungal drugs. While our study offers valuable insights into the virulence of various forms of R. arrhizus and L. corymbifera, as well as their response to antifungal agents, we acknowledge several limitations of our study. Although the study compares the virulence of different fungal forms, it falls short of fully elucidating the mechanism of death and progression of infection in Galleria larvae. It is also important to acknowledge that further studies in pre-clinical animal models are necessary before the data can be considered directly applicable to clinical decision-making regarding appropriate dosages of antifungal agents for patients.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: A.G.B.; Experiment performance: R.J.R.S.T.; Methodology: A.G.B. and R.J.R.S.T.; Validation: A.G.B. and T.J.W.; Formal analysis: R.J.R.S.T., A.R., K.E.R., A.G.B. and T.J.W.; Data curation: R.J.R.S.T., A.R. and K.E.R.; Writing\u2014original draft preparation: A.G.B., R.J.R.S.T. and T.J.W.; Writing\u2014review and editing: A.G.B., T.J.W., R.J.R.S.T., A.R. and K.E.R.; supervision: A.G.B.; Project administration: A.G.B.; Funding acquisition: A.G.B.
