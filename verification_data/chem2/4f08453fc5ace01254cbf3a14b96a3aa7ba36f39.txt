The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are:

1. "These peptides are worthy of further investigation for other potential bioactivities or as a naturally derived carrier to promote the cellular internalisation of other active peptides."

2. "It would be intriguing to investigate the cell-penetrating ability of these peptides within a more physiologically relevant context. An example of this would be tissue imaging to visualise the uptake of peptides in different cell types of the gut in fresh biopsy samples, investigated under different pH conditions, reflecting the fluctuating pH states in the stomach and duodenum. Other aspects that influence the ability of the peptides to enter cell types could also be experimentally manipulated (physical barriers, protease activities close to the gut wall, closed state of gut tight junctions)."

3. "Of particular interest would be the ability of milk-derived peptides to enter the enteroendocrine cells such as the L cells of the intestine, which play an important regulatory role in determining various aspects of gut function."

4. "The approach of systematically investigating all possible overlapping peptides of varying lengths contained within a protein sequence is another feature of our work that is likely to have more general applicability."

These excerpts suggest areas for further research, including exploring other potential bioactivities of the peptides, investigating their cell-penetrating ability in more physiologically relevant contexts, and examining their interaction with specific cell types in the gut.
