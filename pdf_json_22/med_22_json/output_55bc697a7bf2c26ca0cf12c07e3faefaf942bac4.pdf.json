    "abstractText": "RESULTS Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 1770 patients (1379 women [77.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.4 [11.4] years; age range, 42.5-66.0 years) with 1822 tumors were treated with RFA; 49 tumors underwent 1 additional RFA session and 1 tumor underwent 2 additional RFA sessions. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 33.0 (11.4) months (range, 6-131 months). The pooled complete disappearance rate at the end of follow-up was 79% (95% CI, 65%-94%). The overall tumor progression rate was 1.5% (n = 26 patients), local residual mPTC in the ablation area was found in 7 tumors (0.4%), new mPTC in the thyroid was found in 15 patients (0.9%), and 4 patients (0.2%) developed lymph node metastases during follow-up. No distant metastases were detected. Three major complications occurred (2 voice changes lasting >2 months and 1 cardiac arrhythmia). Minor complications were described in 45 patients.",

S. van Velsen, MD, MSc; Marco Medici, MD, PhD; Adriaan Moelker, MD, PhD; Robin P. Peeters, MD, PhD; Cornelis Verhoef, MD, PhD; Tessa M. van Ginhoven, MD, PhD\nIMPORTANCE Papillary microcarcinomas of the thyroid (mPTCs) account for an increasing proportion of thyroid cancers in past decades. The use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been investigated as an alternative to surgery. The effectiveness and safety of RFA has yet to be determined.\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RFA for low-risk mPTC.\nDATA SOURCES Embase, MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched from inception to May 28, 2021.\nSTUDY SELECTION Articles reporting on adult patients with mPTC treated with RFA were included. Studies that involved patients with pre-ablation lymph node or distant metastases, recurrence of disease, or extrathyroidal extension were excluded. Final article selection was conducted by multiple reviewers based on consensus. The proportion of eligible articles was 1%.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines. Random and fixed-effect models were applied to obtain pooled proportions and 95% CIs.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the complete disappearance rate of mPTC. Secondary outcomes were tumor progression and complications.\nRESULTS Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 1770 patients (1379 women [77.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.4 [11.4] years; age range, 42.5-66.0 years) with 1822 tumors were treated with RFA; 49 tumors underwent 1 additional RFA session and 1 tumor underwent 2 additional RFA sessions. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 33.0 (11.4) months (range, 6-131 months). The pooled complete disappearance rate at the end of follow-up was 79% (95% CI, 65%-94%). The overall tumor progression rate was 1.5% (n = 26 patients), local residual mPTC in the ablation area was found in 7 tumors (0.4%), new mPTC in the thyroid was found in 15 patients (0.9%), and 4 patients (0.2%) developed lymph node metastases during follow-up. No distant metastases were detected. Three major complications occurred (2 voice changes lasting >2 months and 1 cardiac arrhythmia). Minor complications were described in 45 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that RFA is a safe and efficient method to treat selected low-risk mPTCs. Radiofrequency ablation could be envisioned as step-up treatment after local tumor growth under active surveillance for an mPTC or initial treatment in patients with mPTCs with anxiety about active surveillance.\nJAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2022;148(4):317-325. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4381 Published online February 10, 2022.\nSupplemental content\nAuthor Affiliations: Author affiliations are listed at the end of this article.\nCorresponding Author: Tessa M. van Ginhoven, MD, PhD, Department of Surgical Oncology and Gastrointestinal Surgery, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, University Medical Centre Rotterdam, Doctor Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, the Netherlands (t.vanginhoven@erasmusmc.nl).\nJAMA Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | Original Investigation\n(Reprinted) 317\n\u00a9 2022 American Medical Association.

Radiofrequency ablation is a nonsurgical, minimally invasive technique that relies on alternating electromagnetic current to cause molecular frictional heating to control tissue mass.18 Although RFA is currently used mostly in patients with benign nodules, recurrent PTC, and inoperable disease,19-22 recent evidence suggests that RFA could be an efficient treatment for patients with low-risk mPTC and has been shown to be more effective than microwave ablation or laser ablation.17 In this systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature, the primary goal is to analyze the effectiveness and safety of RFA for low-risk mPTC in a large number of patients.\nMethods"

In cases of disagreement in the selection of articles, a third reviewer (T.M.v.G.) was consulted to make the final decision. Studies were included if they involved patients who had a primary mPTC and were treated with RFA for the first time. Exclusion criteria were: (1) case reports, case series of less than 5 patients, letters, conference abstracts, (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines, study protocols, statements, or non-English articles; (2) patients with preablation lymph node or distant metastases, recurrence, or extrathyroidal extension; and (3) patients treated with other thermal ablation techniques such as laser, ethanol, or microwave ablation.

The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the complete disappearance rate of mPTCs. Secondary outcomes were tumor progression and complications. Complete disappearance rate was defined by the percentage of patients with a completely absorbed tumor volume on results of ultrasonography after RFA. Incomplete ablation was defined as incompletely absorbed tumor volume on results of ultrasonography after RFA with benign fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results. Tumor progression was defined as cytologically or histologically confirmed residual mPTC in the ablation area, newly found mPTC elsewhere in the thyroid, or lymph node or distant metastases.\nComplications were assessed using the reporting standards of the Society of Interventional Radiology.24 Cardiac events and/or arrhythmias, surgical intervention owing to bleeding after RFA, and voice changes (lasting >1 month) were considered major complications. Pain, hematoma, skin burn, temporary voice changes (lasting \u22641 month), hypoparathyroidism, fever, and neck swelling were considered minor complications.

Funnel plots can be found in eFigure 4 in the Supplement.\nDiscussion In this study, the effectiveness and safety of RFA as a treatment for mPTC in 1770 patients was analyzed. This study demonstrates that 79% of all patients with mPTC who underwent RFA had complete disappearance of tumor tissue on results of ultrasonography after RFA. Although complete disappearance of the tumor was not achieved in 21% of the patients undergoing RFA, only 7 patients (0.4%) received a diagnosis of FNA-confirmed residual mPTC cells. This finding emphasizes that the assessment of tumor response in patients with mPTC after RFA is complicated. Most studies applied ultrasonography and FNA of the residual tumor volume and, if no cancer cells were seen on cytologic examination, patients generally received follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA after RFA has shown to be reduced because of insufficient cellularity in the ablation area.42,43 Core needle biopsy is thought to have a higher diagnostic accuracy for detecting residual cancer cells and could be valuable in increasing the certainty of \u201ccomplete mPTC disappearance\u201d in case of residual tumor volume on ultrasonography after RFA.25 To assess the oncologic acceptability of RFA as a treatment option, complete tumor response after RFA has to be clearly defined, as no criterion standard exists yet.\nThe overall complication rate due to RFA was low (48 [2.7%]) and 3 (0.2%) major complications occurred. All complications, minor and major, resolved spontaneously within 3 months. Twenty-two patients (1.2%) experienced FNAconfirmed residual mPTC or new mPTC, which all were permanently removed by additional ablations. Surgical complications such as permanent hypothyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage occur in 30% and 1% to 2% of patients, respectively, after unilateral thyroid lobectomy.12,44,45\nIn the current study, less-severe complications in patients treated with RFA, such as pain, hematoma, skin burn, and temporary voice hoarseness, occurred in 2.5% of patients.\nAll included studies were conducted in China and Korea, where thyroid cancer guidelines differ significantly from guidelines in Europe. Although North American and European guidelines focus mainly on reducing overdiagnosis of mPTC by applying restrictive diagnostic workup strategies,8,46,47 Asian guidelines often aim to reduce overtreatment using active surveillance and thermal ablation techniques.48-50 Active surveillance instead of immediate surgery has proven to be a safe and viable treatment option for patients with low-risk mPTC.51-53 However, this treatment strategy has also been shown to have low potential in countries in which restrictive diagnostic workup strategies are applied.54 In these countries, the number of patients with mPTC are limited and, when encountered, the mPTC is often further progressed (ie, lymph node metastases or extrathyroidal extension), resulting in a high level of reluctance among thyroid specialists to use active surveillance.54 The effectiveness and safety of RFA in a population with a restrictive diagnostic workup strategy is unknown. With a 79% complete disappearance rate of tumor tissue, RFA could also be a valuable treatment option for patients with low-risk mPTC in these countries. The question whether RFA can aid in preventing lymph node metastases remains to be investigated.\nAlthough this study suggests that RFA is a safe and efficient method to treat low-risk mPTCs, there is no evidence that treatment of low-risk mPTC is associated with any clinical benefit. Especially in populations with less-restrictive diagnostic workup protocols, patients with low-risk mPTC should generally receive active surveillance. However, in case of local tumor growth under active surveillance or in case of patient anxiety about active surveillance, RFA could be a valuable minimally invasive strategy in the management of low-risk mPTC. Different studied treatment options for mPTC and its advantages and disadvantages are described in\nTable 4.52,55-58\njamaotolaryngology.com (Reprinted) JAMA Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery April 2022 Volume 148, Number 4 323\n\u00a9 2022 American Medical Association.

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "This study has some limitations, the most important of which is theinclusionofmostlyretrospectivecaseserieswithsmallsample sizes that use several RFA techniques (eg, ablation energy, time of ablation, electrode tip diameter) and follow-up schedules. These studies have a higher risk of bias and low certainty.39,40 In addition, the likelihood of patient selection bias is increased in the included studies (eg, smaller tumors, healthier patients). There were 11 studies with potential overlapping patient cohorts basedonauthornames,inclusionperiods,andaffiliations.Finally, owing to the only recent developments in the field of thermal ablation techniques for patients with mPTC, follow-up periods of the patients included in the analyzed studies were relatively short (mean [SD], 33.0 [11.4] months). Despite these limitations, this review managed to illustrate the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of RFA in patients with mPTC.\nThe results in the current study suggest that RFA could function as a useful alternative treatment strategy in which patients are treated minimally invasively with curative intentions. Future studies may focus on improving complete disappearance rates of the tumor volume, possibly with more advanced or longer RFA procedures. To properly assess and\ncompare oncologic outcomes with surgery and/or active surveillance in populations with restrictive diagnostic workup strategies, prospective trials or registration studies with longterm follow-up should be conducted. Although 3 Chinese studies showed that RFA was less expensive than surgery in patients with mPTC,34,35,41 future research may also focus on evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of RFA in other national health care environments.\nConclusions The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that RFA is a safe and efficient method to treat low-risk mPTC, with 79% complete disappearance rates of tumor tissue. Future research may focus on determining what role RFA could play in the treatment of mPTC, especially in countries with restrictive diagnostic workup protocols. Radiofrequency ablation could be envisioned as step-up treatment after local tumor growth under active surveillance or initial treatment in patients with anxiety about active surveillance and wishing to avoid surgery.\nARTICLE INFORMATION\nAccepted for Publication: December 15, 2021.\nPublished Online: February 10, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4381\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Surgical Oncology and Gastrointestinal Surgery, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (van Dijk, Coerts, Verhoef, van Ginhoven); Department of Medical Library, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (Gunput); Department of Internal Medicine and Thyroid Diseases, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (van Velsen, Medici, Peeters); Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (Moelker).\nAuthor Contributions: Mr van Dijk had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
