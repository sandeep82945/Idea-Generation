    "abstractText": "Optical chemosensors are a practical tool for the detection and quantification of important analytes in biological and environmental fields, such as Cu2+ and Fe3+. To the best of our knowledge, a BODIPY derivative capable of detecting Cu2+ and Fe3+ simultaneously through a colorimetric response has not yet been described in the literature. In this work, a meso-triphenylamineBODIPY derivative is reported for the highly selective detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+. In the preliminary chemosensing study, this compound showed a significant color change from yellow to blue\u2013green in the presence of Cu2+ and Fe3+. With only one equivalent of cation, a change in the absorption band of the compound and the appearance of a new band around 700 nm were observed. Furthermore, only 10 equivalents of Cu2+/Fe3+ were needed to reach the absorption plateau in the UV-visible titrations. Compound 1 showed excellent sensitivity toward Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection, with LODs of 0.63 \u03bcM and 1.06 \u03bcM, respectively. The binding constant calculation indicated a strong complexation between compound 1 and Cu2+/Fe3+ ions. The 1H and 19F NMR titrations showed that an increasing concentration of cations induced a broadening and shifting of the aromatic region peaks, as well as the disappearance of the original fluorine peaks of the BODIPY core, which suggests that the ligand\u2013metal (1:2) interaction may occur through the triphenylamino group and the BODIPY core.",

            "text": "Metal ions play a crucial role in several biological processes, nutrient cycling, and the functioning of the ecosystem. However, the deregulation of ionic concentrations represents a potential risk to living organisms and the ecosystem, leading to health problems and environmental pollution [1\u20133]. Concerning biological systems, metal ions are considered important elements that regulate and participate in several extra- and intra-cellular processes, such as osmotic pressure regulation, cell signaling (e.g., neurotransmission and muscle contraction), protein and enzyme activity required for oxygen transport, energy production, the regulation of gene expression, and the synthesis of essential molecules [4]. Among several other ions, Cu2+ and Fe3+ play an important role in various biochemical processes; however, the deregulation of the homeostasis of these cations has been identified as the primary cause of many diseases. For example, high levels of Cu2+ can lead to a higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which contributes to the development of different pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Menkes, Wilson, and Alzheimer\u2019s. Moreover, studies have shown that copper levels in the blood serum of cancer patients are considerably above normal values. In contrast, iron deficiency is also associated with several diseases, such as anemia, diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s, and dysfunction of the heart, pancreas, and liver [5\u20138]. Apart from that, these elements are non-biodegradable, which is an increased risk for the environment and human health. In this sense, the detection of these two important cations has been a major goal [9\u201311]. Colorimetric sensors are a practical tool for the detection and quantification of these analytes with biological and environmental importance. Compared to other analytical\nSensors 2023, 23, 6995. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23156995 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 6995 2 of 13\ntechniques, optical chemosensing displays advantages, including simplicity, speed of response, easy and direct visualization of the results, non-expensive equipment, and high selectivity and sensitivity. For those reasons, investment has been made in the design and synthesis of colorimetric sensors for the detection of these cations of interest. Several chemosensors based on rhodamine, aldazine, carbazole, tetrathiafulvalene spirooxazine, triarylimidazopyridine, and Schiff base core have been developed for the detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+ [9,10,12\u201319]. 4,4-Difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, also known as BODIPY, has been recognized as a remarkable chromophore scaffold due to its excellent photophysical properties, such as high molar absorptivity coefficients, narrow and intense absorption bands in the visible range, and great photostability. Furthermore, the core of BODIPY can be functionalized in order to improve its photophysical properties for its intended applications [20,21]. Although several chemosensors based on a BODIPY core have been reported for the detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+, these sensors detect these cations separately [22\u201324]. Most of these chemosensors also display a fluorimetric response which requires specialized equipment for the visualization of the results. In contrast, chemosensors that are based on a colorimetric response provide direct and real-time detection and identification of the target analyte. To the best of our knowledge, a BODIPY derivative capable of detecting Cu2+ and Fe3+ simultaneously through a colorimetric response has not yet been described in the literature. Additionally, given the paramagnetic behavior of Cu2+ and Fe3+ and, consequently, their fluorescence quenching effect, optical sensors with an intense colorimetric response for these analytes are extremely attractive [25,26]. In continuation of the research developed by our group [27\u201330], we present an evaluation of the ion chemosensory ability of a meso-triphenylamine-BODIPY 1 in this work (TPA-BODIPY, Figure 1), which was recently synthesized by us [31,32]. The chemosensory ability was investigated by a preliminary study against several cations and anions with biomedical relevance, followed by spectrophotometric titrations, the Job\u2019s plot method, and 1H NMR titrations.\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14\nthese elements are non-biodegradable, which is an increased risk for the environment and human health.

These data suggest that the interaction of Cu2+ with the BODIPY core may change the environment around the F and could be explained by the formation of a BF species dissociated from one of the N or even from both N. All these findings suggest the coordination of the cations with BODIPY 1 may be occurring through the nitrogen atom of the TPA moiety and simultaneously with the fluorine atoms of the BODIPY core [55], which is consistent with the formation of a 1:2 complex between ligand 1 and the metal proved by the Job\u2019s plot experiment."

In the preliminary chemosensing study, this compound showed a significant color change from yellow to blue\u2013green in the presence of Cu2+ and Fe3+. With only one equivalent of cation, a change in the absorption band of the compound and the appearance of a new band around 700 nm were observed. Furthermore, only 10 equivalents of Cu2+/Fe3+ were needed to reach the absorbance plateau in the UV-\nSensors 2023, 23, 6995 11 of 13\nvisible absorption titrations. Compound 1 showed an excellent sensitivity toward Cu2+ and Fe3+ detection with LODs of 0.63 \u00b5M and 1.06 \u00b5M, respectively. The binding constant calculation indicated a strong complexation between compound 1 and Cu2+/Fe3+ ions. The 1H and 19F NMR titrations suggested that the ligand-metal interaction may occur through the nitrogen atom of the TPA moiety and simultaneously with the fluorine atoms of the BODIPY core. Hence, BODIPY derivative 1 has demonstrated great potential as a chemosensor for the rapid, selective, and sensitive detection of Cu2+ and Fe3+.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/s23156995/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR spectra of BODIPY 1 in the absence and presence of one equivalent of Cu2+ in ACN-d3; Figure S2: 19F NMR spectra of BF3OEt2 in ACN-d3.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.C.S.P., R.C.R.G. and M.M.M.R.; methodology, S.C.S.P., R.C.R.G., S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; validation, S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; formal analysis, S.C.S.P., R.C.R.G., S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; investigation, S.C.S.P. and R.C.R.G.; resources, S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.C.S.P. and R.C.R.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.C.S.P., R.C.R.G., S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; supervision, S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; project administration, S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.; funding acquisition, S.P.G.C. and M.M.M.R.
