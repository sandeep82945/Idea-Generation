    "abstractText": "An efficient one-pot synthetic method has been developed for the preparation of bicyclic carbamoyl pyridones from the known common intermediate methyl 5-((2,4-difluorobenzyl)carbamoyl)1-(2,2-dimethoxyethyl)-3-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-2-carboxylate (8). The scalable protocol is facile and employs readily available reagents, needing only a single purification as the final step. The utility of the approach was demonstrated by preparing a library of HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) that differ by the presence or absence of a double bond in the B-ring of the bicyclic carbamoyl pyridines 6 and 7. Several of the analogs show good antiviral potencies in single-round HIV-1 replication antiviral assays and show no cytotoxicity in cell culture assays. In general, the compounds with a B-ring double bond have higher antiviral potencies than their saturated congeners. Our methodology should be applicable to the synthesis of a range of new metal-chelating analogs.",

            "text": "Bis-cationic magnesium (Mg2+) is the most abundant divalent cation in cells [1]. The hydration shell and ligand geometries of Mg2+ contribute to its role in polynucleotide folding and its frequent use by DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleases [2\u20135]. The critical roles played by divalent metal chelation in essential viral enzymes have made metal-chelating pharmacophores important components of a range of antiviral agents [6\u20138]. For example, HIV-1 replication involves the conversion of the single-stranded viral RNA genome into linear dsDNA by the polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities of reverse transcriptase (RT), and subsequent incorporation of the viral DNA into the host genome through the catalysis of viral integrase (IN). Two Mg2+ cations serve as cognate catalytic cofactors for these enzymes [9\u201311]. Metal-chelating moieties are central components of inhibitors directed against both RNase H [12,13] and integrase [14\u201321]. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are of particular interest, with recently approved INSTIs representing some of most effective anti-AIDS drugs [22]. Evolution of the metal-chelating motifs of INSTIs has played a key role in the improvements in the therapeutic efficacy of this class of drugs [14,20]. Of the five currently FDA-approved INSTIs (the first-generation INSTIs Raltegravir (RAL, 1, approved in 2007) and Elvitegravir (EVG, 2, approved in 2012), and second generation INSTIs Dolutegravir (DTG, 3, approved in 2013), Bictegravir (BIC, 4, approved in 2018), and Cabotegravir (CAB, 5, approved in 2021)) the three second-generation drugs share a common metal-chelating platform based on carbamoyl pyridone motifs (9-hydroxy-2H-pyrido [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,8dione 6 and the saturated congener 9-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,8dione (7, Figure 1) [3,4,21,23].

In our initial work, we heated 8 in formic acid at 80 \u00b0C to effect conversion to the aldehyde 9 (Scheme 1) [26\u201328].

We envisioned a more straightforward one-pot synthesis of 6a directly from the common intermediate 8 that would not require intermediate purification. Accordingly, the reaction sequence described above was repeated in a one-pot synthesis. The methyl-protected enol 10a was not isolated directly. Rather, following the conversion of 10a to 6a, solvent and acetic acid were removed by rotary evaporation and the resulting residue was placed under high vacuum (30 min). Conversion of 8 to enol 6a was achieved in one-pot fashion in 31% yield over three steps following HPLC purification (Scheme 1)."

The halogen substitution pattern of the benzylamide moiety can affect inhibitory potencies of INSTIs [30]. We determined the antiviral potencies of our compounds in single round HIV-1 replication assays using viral constructs with wild-type IN [31]. Cytotoxicities were determined as previously described [31]. The FDA-approved INSTIs 3, 4, and 5 showed similar antiviral EC50 values of approximately 2 nM (Table 1). In general, the potencies of bicyclic analogs 6 having an unsaturated bond at the C4 position were insensitive to differences in N-methyl substituents. Most compounds uniformly exhibited single digit nanomolar antiviral potencies, with the exception of 6d and 6e, which had antiviral EC50 values of approximately 11 nM and 17 nM, respectively. Members of the unsaturated series 6 were uniformly found to exhibit low cytotoxicities (CC50 > 250 n ), except for the N-methyl substituted analog 6a, which showed slightly increased cytotoxicity (CC50 = 121 nM). In the case of isopropyl substitution (6b and 7b) antiviral potencies were similar; however, cytotoxicities increased slightly after reduction of the double bond (CC50 > 250 nM and 167 nM, respectively). A slight loss of antiviral potency was observed ith analogs having terminal hydroxy groups in the unsaturated series 6c, 6d, and 6e, (antiviral EC50 alues of 4.8 nM, 10.8 n , and 16.6 nM, respectively) with an even great r loss of p tency for their corr sponding saturated analogs 7c, 7d, and 7e (EC50 values of 31.7 nM, 54.5 nM, and 75.7 nM, respectively). The unsaturated series compound 6f, which is a ethyl-ether ri ary alcohol 6c, does not have improved antiviral potency relative to the unsaturated version 7f (EC50 = 4.6 nM). However, conversion of the unsaturated analog 6c to yield compound 7c resulted in a six-fold decrease in potency relative to 6c. Unsaturated analogs having ter inal - oxy-containing N-substituents (6g and 6h) showed antiviral potencies that were similar to the second-generation tricyclic INSTIs 3, 4, and 5 (EC50 2 nM for both series). Analogs 6g and 6h represent simplified analogs of DTG (3) and CAB (5), respectively, i ic t third ring (C-ring) is opened and a i l i - i , t l i - t l t - reochemistry.\nTable 1.

The unsaturated series compound 6f, which is a methyl-ether congener of l 6c, does not have improved antiviral potency relative to the unsaturated version 7f (EC50 = 4.6 n ). However, conversion of the unsaturated nalog 6c to yield compound 7c resulted in a six-fold decrease in potency relative to 6c. Unsaturated l i t i l ethoxy-containing N-substituents ( ) s ti ir l t ci s t t r si il r t the second-generation tricyclic I S Is 3, 4, a 5 ( \u2248 2 n for both series). Analogs 6g and 6h represent simplified analogs of DTG (3) and CAB (5), respectively, in which the third ring (C-ring) is opened and having doble bond in B-ring, but lacking \u03b1- ethyl stereochemistry.\nTable 1.

Potential Role of Unsaturation in the B-Ring The data in Table 1 reveal that the bicyclic carbamoyl pyridones having a double bond in their B-ring exhibit higher antiviral potencies than their saturated counterparts. A graphical comparison of antiviral potencies for unsaturated versus saturated congeners is provided (Figure 2). Unsaturation in the B-ring may contribute to improved antiviral potency for at least two reasons. First, as shown by superimposing in silico generated minimized structures of 6a and 7a (Figure 3), the double bond in the bicyclic system results in greater planarity as compared to the more buckled ring system of the saturated congeners. This results in a slight out-of-plane alignment of the metal-chelating B-ring amide carbonyl oxygen. Maintaining planarity of chelating heteroatoms may potentially contribute to more facile Mg2+ chelation. Second, by forming an electron-rich aromatic system, unsaturation in the B-ring may also contribute to improved potency by enhancing stacking interactions of the bicyclic carbamoyl pyridone ring system with the terminal adenosine nucleobase of the viral DNA. Stacking of the adenosine with the INSTI has been suggested to favor binding [34].\nFigure 2.

Conclusions We present one-pot synthetic methodology that yields a common bicyclic carbamoyl platform starting from the acetal intermediate 8. This represents an improvement in previous multistep approaches, which had required special reaction conditions and purification at each step. The new molecules synthesized in our current manuscript represent simplified analogs of the FDA-approved second-generation tricyclic INSTIs. Single digit nanomolar antiviral potencies were observed for several compounds, with analogs 6g and 6h having antiviral potencies similar to the FDA-approved second-generation INSTIs. The antiviral data suggests that there is the potential importance of a double bond in the Bring. Improved potency of the unsaturated compounds may derive from induced planarity in the bicyclic carbamoyl pyridone rings as well as improved stacking interactions with the viral DNA terminal adenosine nucleobase. Our work opens the possibility of delivering potential bicyclic and tricyclic carbamoyl pyridone-containing INSTIs (including FDA-approved second-generation INSTIs) from appropriate amines/amino alcohols in a one-pot operation with a single purification. The synthesis and bio-evaluation of analogs using the disclosed protocol is currently underway in our laboratory.\n4. Experimental Section 4.1.

            "text": "Human embryonic kidney cell culture cell line 293 was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human osteosarcoma cell line, HOS, was obtained from Dr. Richard Schwartz (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA) and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% newborn calf serum, and penicillin (50 units/mL) plus streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/mL; Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The transfection vector, pNLNgoMIVR-\u2206LUC was made from pNLNgoMIVR-\u2206Env.HSA by removing the HSA reporter gene and replacing it with a luciferase reporter gene between the NotI and XhoI restriction sites. To produce the new IN mutant S230N used in this study, the IN open reading frame was removed from pNLNgoMIVR-\u2206ENV.LUC by digestion with KpnI and SalI, and the resulting fragment was inserted between the KpnI and SalI sites of pBluescript KS+. Using that construct as the wild-type template, we prepared the following HIV-1 IN mutant S230N using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) protocol. The following sense oligonucleotides were used with matching cognate antisense oligonucleotides (not shown) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) in the mutagenesis: S230N 5\u2032-CGGGTTTATTACAGGGACAACAGAGATCCAGTTTGGAAA-3\u2032. The DNA sequence\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1428 13 of 15\nof the IN mutant S230N construct was verified independently by DNA sequence determination. The mutated IN coding sequences from pBluescript KS+ were then subcloned into pNLNgoMIVR-\u2206Env.LUC (between the KpnI and SalI sites) to produce mutant HIV-1 constructs, which were also checked by DNA sequencing. VSV-g-pseudotyped HIV was produced by transfections of 293 cells as mentioned earlier. On the day prior to transfection, 293 cells were plated on 100 mm diameter dishes at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 106 cells per plate. Next, 293 cells were transfected with 16 \u00b5g of pNLNgoMIVR-\u2206LUC and 4 \u00b5g of pHCMV-g (obtained from Dr. Jane Burns, University of California, San Diego) using the calcium phosphate method. At approximately 6 h after the calcium phosphate precipitate was added, 293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with fresh media for 48 h. The virus-containing supernatants were then harvested, clarified by low-speed centrifugation, filtrated, and diluted for preparation in antiviral infection assays. On the day prior to the screen, HOS cells were seeded in a 96-well luminescence cell culture plate at a density of 4000 cells in 100 \u00b5L per well. On the day of the screen for cellular cytotoxicity determination, cells were treated with compounds from a concentration range of 250 \u00b5M to 0.05 \u00b5M and then incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 48 h. On the day of the screen for antiviral activity infection assays, cells were treated with compounds from a concentration range of 5 \u00b5M to 0.0001 \u00b5M using 11 serial dilutions and then incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 3 h. After compound incorporation and activation in the cell, 100 \u00b5L of virus-stock (WT or mutant) diluted to achieve a luciferase signal between 0.2 and 1.5 Relative Luciferase Units (RLUs) was added to each well and further incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 48 h. Cellular cytotoxicity was measured by using the ATP Lite Luminescence detection system and monitored by adding 50 \u00b5L of cell lysis buffer from the Luminescence ATP detection assay to each well followed by mixing at 700 rpm at room temperature for 5 min using a compact thermomixer. After addition of 50 \u00b5L of reconstituted Luminescence ATP detection assay reagent to all wells except for the negative control/background wells, the plates were mixed at 700 rpm at room temperature for 5 min using a compact thermomixer, incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow time for signal development, and finally, cytotoxicity was determined using the microplate reader. Infectivity was measured by using the Steady-lite plus luminescence reporter gene assay system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Luciferase activity was measured by adding 100 \u00b5L of Steady-lite plus buffer (PerkinElmer) to the cells, incubating at room temperature for 20 min, and measuring luminescence using a microplate reader. Both cytotoxicity and antiviral activity were normalized to the cellular cytotoxicity and infectivity in cells that featured the absence of target compounds, respectively. KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to perform non-linear regression analysis on the data. EC50 and CC50 values were determined from the fit model [31].\nSupplementary Materials: NMR spectra of the synthesized compounds are available in the supporting information: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28031428/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.R.B.J., X.Z. and P.S.M.; methodology, P.S.M., X.Z. and T.R.B.J.; biological evaluation, S.J.S.; validation and investigation, P.S.M. and S.J.S., X.Z. and T.R.B.J.; resources, T.R.B.J.; data curation, P.S.M. and S.J.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.S.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, all authors; funding acquisition, T.R.B.J., X.Z. and S.H.H.
