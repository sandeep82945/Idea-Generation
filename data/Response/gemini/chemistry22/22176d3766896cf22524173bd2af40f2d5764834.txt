1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of different sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) on AChE inhibition:** 
The study found that chicory extracts containing a mixture of SLs exhibited higher AChE inhibitory activity than individual SLs. Future research could explore the synergistic effects of different SLs in more detail, determining the optimal combinations and ratios for maximum AChE inhibition.


2. **Evaluate the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties of SLs and chicory extracts:** 
To assess the potential of SLs and chicory extracts as AChE inhibitors in vivo, it is crucial to investigate their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Future studies should examine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of SLs and chicory extracts in animal models to determine their systemic exposure and duration of action.


3. **Explore the neuroprotective effects of SLs and chicory extracts in animal models of Alzheimer's disease:** 
Given the potential of SLs and chicory extracts to inhibit AChE, future research should investigate their neuroprotective effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Studies could assess the ability of SLs and chicory extracts to improve cognitive function, reduce amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles, and protect neurons from degeneration.


4. **Investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of SLs and chicory extracts:** 
While the study suggests that SLs and chicory extracts have potential as AChE inhibitors, their long-term safety and tolerability need to be evaluated. Future research should conduct chronic toxicity studies in animal models to assess the potential adverse effects of SLs and chicory extracts and determine safe dosage ranges for human consumption.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLs and chicory extracts in humans:** 
To establish the clinical relevance of SLs and chicory extracts as AChE inhibitors, well-designed clinical trials are necessary. Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLs and chicory extracts in humans with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, assessing their impact on cognitive function, disease progression, and overall well-being.
