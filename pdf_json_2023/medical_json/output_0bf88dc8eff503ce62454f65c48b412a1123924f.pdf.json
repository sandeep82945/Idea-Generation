            "text": "13 Hypersaline brine production from desalination plants causes huge environmental stress due to the 14 untenable conventional discharge strategies. Particularly, brine production is expected to drastically 15 increase in the coming few decades due to the increasing desalination capacity in attempts of forestalling 16 water scarcity. Thereby, zero liquid discharge (ZLD) is a worth-considering solution for strategic brine 17 management. ZLD or minimal liquid discharge (MLD) systems provide maximum water recovery with 18 least or zero liquid waste generation and valuable salt production. In this work, a theoretical design of 19 ZLD/MLD systems is proposed for RO brine management. Four different scenarios are investigated 20 combining multistage freeze desalination (FD), multistage membrane distillation (MD), and eutectic freeze 21 crystallization (EFC) technologies. Water recovery, water quality, as well as specific energy consumption 22 (SEC) are evaluated. FD experiments showed that ice quality is reduced at greater crystallinity levels and 23 initial concentration. Meanwhile, DCMD module was capable of producing 53 kg/(m2.h) of pure water 24 operating with 69% thermal efficiency. Based on different configuration of the hybrid ZLD system, the 25 proposed design can achieve water recovery between 40% up to 93% with SEC range of 28-114 kWh/m3. 26 Results also showed that the produced water quality is even greater than drinkable water standards (\u226a500 27 mg/l). This work has provided great evidence in the practicality of ZLD/MLD systems for sustainable brine 28 management. 29 30 Keywords: Freeze desalination, brine management, hybrid desalination, membrane distillation, zero liquid discharge, 31 eutectic freeze crystallization 32 33\n* Corresponding author.

            "text": "Water scarcity in Arabian Peninsula due to the hot climate and rapid demographic growth have 35 provoked the demand on seawater desalination. The capacity of desalination plants around Arabian Gulf 36 increased from 0.04 million m3/day in 1970 to over 20 million m3/day in 2021 (Le Quesne et al., 2021), 37 that is equal to 20% of total global desalination production capacity (Jones et al., 2019). Multi-stage flashing 38 (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED) and reverse osmosis (RO) are the most prevalent desalination 39 technologies that are utilized for Arabian gulf seawater (Le Quesne et al., 2021). As most of these plants 40 dispose hypersaline effluent, i.e., brine, with a salinity of nearly twice that of seawater (~70 g/l) , it is 41 alarmed that Arabian Gulf salinity will increase by 2.24 g/l in the year 2050 (Bashitialshaaer et al., 2011; 42 Hashim & Hajjaj, 2005). The discharged brine with higher salinity and density sinks down to seabed 43 affecting habitats and water column stability. Furthermore, coastal areas which are habitats of wide range 44 of species such as seagrass meadows and corals are also endangered by the cumulative impacts of the 45 inflated capacity of desalination plants (Le Quesne et al., 2021). Despite surface and nearshore discharge, 46 other conventional brine disposal strategies includes deep well injection, evaporative ponds, and irrigation 47 applications (Gude, 2018). A common drawback of these actions, however, is the unfavorable impact on 48 the groundwater and soil environment. Unless a novel zero brine discharge strategy is considered, existing 49 observations have proved the unavoidable and massive environmental impact of the growing desalination 50 sector. 51 Brine treatment can be classified to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) or Minimal Liquid Discharge 52 (MLD) systems based on separation process involved and desired outcome. With very similar 53 methodologies, ZLD aims for 100% water recovery and 0% liquid waste by producing solid salts, while 54 MLD targets water recovery up to 95% with lower energy consumption and capital costs compared to that 55 of ZLD (Panagopoulos, 2022b). In addition to the shared separation technologies with MLD, i.e., 56 membrane-based, chemical, and biological, ZLD also involves thermal-based separation techniques such 57 as thermal distillation processes, evaporation, and eutectic freeze crystallization (EFC). Brine treatment 58 systems should be designed such that a maximum freshwater recovery is achieved with the minimum 59 possible energy requirement. It is expected that the global ZLD market will reach $1.76 billion by 2026 60 with annual growth rate of 12.1% (Panagopoulos & Haralambous, 2020). 61 Several attempts on hybrid desalination technologies to achieve ZLD or MLD were evaluated 62 recently (El Zayat et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2019; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020; McGovern et al., 2014; Panagopoulos, 63 2020, 2022a; Panagopoulos & Haralambous, 2020; Quist-Jensen et al., 2016; Wang & Chung, 2012; Yadav 64 et al., 2022). For instant, (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020) have utilized a combination of ultrafiltration (UF), forward 65 osmosis (FO), RO and evaporative crystallizer in treating industrial brine attempting ZLD. With 75% water 66 recovery, a specific energy consumption (SEC) of 7.4 kWh/m3 for the hybrid process was recorded. 67 However, exit brine with 200g/l concentration was produced. (El Zayat et al., 2021) have utilized fertilizer 68 drawn FO process to reduce RO volume production by 12%..(McGovern et al., 2014) have also investigated 69 to treat saline RO brines using hybridization with counterflow electrodialysis (ED). Results showed 29% 70 water recovery at optimized conditions with overall power consumption ranged between 27.1-49.1 kWh/m3. 71 According to the authors, this was due to the limited process efficiency, increased levelized cost of water, 72 and increased water transport via osmosis. On the other hand, (Quist-Jensen et al., 2016) have analyzed the 73 integration of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and membrane crystallization (MCr) to reach 74 high water and minerals recovery from RO brine. Crystals with high economic benefits as sodium chloride, 75 strontium, barium, and magnesium sulfate were successfully recovered. Moreover, the overall water 76 recovery has increased from 50% for pure RO process to above 90% when DCMD-MCr is involved. Other 77\npilot/laboratory based studies have utilized DCMD with evaporative crystallizer to achieve ZLD (Bouchrit 78 et al., 2017; G. Chen et al., 2014; Creusen et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2019) Nonetheless, better control over 79 operating parameters, development of super anti-fouling membranes, and energy efficient crystallization 80 process are still needed for MD-MCr scaleup (Yadav et al., 2022).A hybrid MED and thermal vapor 81 compression (TVC) system was proposed by (Panagopoulos, 2020) for RO brine treatment. Having an 82 integrated solar power generation unit, the hybrid system was capable to recover 50 m3/day with a SEC of 83 3.5 kWh/m3. It is worth noting that RO is rarely employed as the main technology in a ZLD/MLD system 84 due to its low water recovery (<50%) and brine concentration (<70 g/l). 85 In recent years, freeze desalination (FD) technology has been appealing researchers and industrial 86 stakeholders due to its reduced energy requirement and less pretreatment requirements compared to 87 conventional techniques (El Kadi & Janajreh, 2017; Kalista et al., 2018). The general interest of FD evolves 88 from its low latent heat of fusion, i.e., 334 kJ/kg. FD is a freezing melting process where freshwater in form 89 of ice crystals is separated by cooling the initial brine solution. Crystallization can take place by direct or 90 indirect contact with the refrigerant, where indirect freeze crystallization (IFC) is the most pronounced 91 method in desalination. Progressive FC and falling film FC are two common IFC techniques that utilizes 92 heat removal to a refrigerant through a wall/plate (El Kadi & Janajreh, 2017; Rahman et al., 2006). The 93 treated solution in PFC is typically static and is progressively immured in a cold refrigerant bath. Whereas 94 on the other hand, the falling film FC is a dynamic process where the treated solution flow in a specific rate 95 over a cold plate (Williams et al., 2015). Most importantly, any IFC technology has the capability of one-96 dimension (1-D) crystal growth allowing less impurities and easier separation (El Kadi et al., 2021; Luo et 97 al., 2010). 98 Despite that, FD is still being questionable for standalone desalination application due to its high capital 99 costs and the availability of other less expensive mature competitors. Though, it has a great potential when 100 it comes to treat complex and highly concentrated wastewaters (Randall & Nathoo, 2015). Exploiting 101 synergies between FD and other technologies will be always of a great benefit in overcoming drawbacks 102 of particular single process. For instance, (Wang & Chung, 2012) have proposed a hybrid MLD system 103 based on freeze desalination (FD) and DCMD for brine treatment with the utilization of liquefied natural 104 gas (LNG) cold energy. The proposed system could produce pure water with concentration of 0.062 g/l and 105 a recovery ratio of 71.5% at optimal conditions with a SEC of 4.63 kWh/m3. In addition to DCMD and FD, 106 (Lu et al., 2019) have also designed a similar hybrid ZLD system but with extra evaporative crystallization 107 unit for solid salt production. Under optimal conditions of the pilot scale ZLD system, 100% water recovery 108 was achieved, yet with a very high SEC value of 2,000 kWh/m3 due to the presence of the energy-intensive 109 crystallization process. Meanwhile, several attempts have utilized EFC for zero liquid brine disposal 110 (Culcasi et al., 2022; Lewis et al., 2010; Nathoo et al., 2009; Randall et al., 2011; Randall & Nathoo, 2015). 111 (Culcasi et al., 2022) have achieved 71% water recovery yet with low quality ice production utilizing a 112 combined ED-EFC process. Nonetheless, 99.1% of valuable minerals have been recovered with total SEC 113 of 0.9-1.6 kWh/ kg(salt). 114 In this work, a ZLD system based on a novel hybrid FD-MD-EFC process for RO brine treatment is 115 proposed. The design of the ZLD system is optimized to achieve highest water recovery with minimal SEC. 116 Having FD as the primary technology, experiments of FD at different recovery ratios, freezing temperature, 117 and brine concentrations are performed. Eventually, FD process is evaluated by its separation efficiency, 118 partition coefficient, and water recovery. On the other hand, different flow conditions of a pilot scale 119 DCMD system are examined using a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to achieve 120 maximum possible permeation flux with highest thermal efficiency. Eventually, four different scenarios of 121\nhybridization are evaluated using multistage FD-MD along with the integration of EFC technology. This 122 work demonstrates the great potential of multistage FD-MD-EFC in achieving ZLD or MLD with 123 competitive SEC values for a sustainable brine management. 124\n125\n2. Methods 126\n2.1. Indirect freeze desalination unit 127\nFig.1 shows the schematic diagram of the batch-based indirect freeze desalination (IFD) unit involved 128 in this study. A cylindrical tray of 1200 ml capacity is used as the crystallizer in which the prepared solution 129 is placed. The crystallizer is placed on a freezing shelf and insulated circumferentially and top sides as seen 130 in Fig.2. The freezing shelf is contained in the Virtis/Advantage freeze dryer machine in which the 131 crystallization process takes place. The freezing shelf is cooled indirectly using liquified CO2 as refrigerant 132 covering a wide range of cooling temperatures, i.e., from 20\u00b0C down to -45\u00b0C. 133 A deionized 1040 ml water is mixed in an external container with the stipulated amount of sodium 134 chloride (NaCl) to prepare brine samples with concentrations ranging between 2 g/l to 155 g/l. The prepared 135 volume is then poured in the insulated circular tray, which is further placed on the freezing shelve at a 136 controlled temperature. The contact between the filled tray and the shelve is secured by means of screw 137 type jack that was placed on top or bottom of the shelve which presses the tray against the shelve. Depending 138 on the brine concentration and shelve temperature, the complete freezing process is done in 3 to 24 hours. 139\n140 Fig.1. Schematic diagram showing the experimental procedure of indirect freeze desalination unit 141\n142 Fig.2. Illustration of the freezing process 143\n144 The freezing is equipped by several T-type (0.5 mm) thermocouple that was immersed at the center of 145 the tray at vertical spatial locations. Following freezing, ice separation and melting are performed utilizing 146 heated plate equipped with larger pan for melt collection. The tray is turned over in a way that melting 147 direction is the inverse of freezing direction. The melt is collected via manual DB plastic syringe of 30 ml 148 which is emptied in 100 ml capacity vials. The syringe is repeatedly rinsed in demineralized water for the 149 next melted volume. The brine filled vials are left for a few hours in the lab until they reach equal and stable 150 temperature before their conductivity/salinity measurements are carried out using the Fisher Scientific XL60 151 Accumet Excel Meter (mV Accuracy \u00b10.2). Each experiment is repeated three times for data reproducibility 152 and error estimation. Accordingly, uncertainty measurements of salinity data are evaluated based on the 153 standard error estimation method. 154 Among many parameters reported to evaluate the performance of the FD process, removal efficiency 155\n(\ud835\udc45) and effective partition coefficient (\ud835\udc3e) are the most pronounced ones (El Kadi & Janajreh, 2018; Melak 156 et al., 2019). Salt removal efficiency (also called desalination\\separation efficiency) is evaluated using the 157 concentrations of the initial solution and ice, whereas the effective partition coefficient is the ratio between 158\nthe ice and concentrated liquid concentrations. Expressions of \ud835\udc45 and \ud835\udc3e are tabulated in Table 2. 159 160 2.2. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) unit 161\nPrevious research by authors of this work have proved the reliability of DCMD utilizing both 162 experimental and computational methods (El Kadi et al., 2021; El Kadi, Moustakas, et al., 2020; Janajreh, 163 El Kadi, et al., 2017; Janajreh, Suwwan, et al., 2017). In this work, a spacer-filled DCMD module consisting 164 of 1-mm deep feed and permeate channels each of 210 mm length and 10 mm width is utilized. Polymeric 165 spacers with filament diameter of 0.5 mm and a distance between two consecutive filaments of 1.5 mm 166 were distributed equally at the top and bottom membrane surfaces as seen in Fig. 3. The DCMD module is 167 evaluated using a 2-D CFD model. The flow inside the computational domain is governed by the turbulent 168 Navier-Stokes and energy system of equations as follows: 169 - Continuity: 170 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc66 = 0 (1) 171 - Momentum: 172 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc66 = \u2212 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf07 (\ud835\udf152\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udf152\ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc662) (2) 173 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc66 = \u2212 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc43\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc66 + \ud835\udf07 (\ud835\udf152\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udf152\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc662) + \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66 (3) 174 - Energy: 175 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf06 (\ud835\udf152\ud835\udc47\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udf152\ud835\udc47\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc662) + \ud835\udc46\u210e (4) 176 - Turbulence: 177 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc58\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57 [(\ud835\udf07 + \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc58\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57] + \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f \u2212 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf00 \u2212 \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc40 (5) 178 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57 [(\ud835\udf07 + \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf00) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57] + \ud835\udc361\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc363\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f) \u2212 \ud835\udc362\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf002\ud835\udc58 (6) 179 Where \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc63 are the velocity components in the \ud835\udc65 \u2212 and \ud835\udc66 \u2212 directions. \ud835\udc43 is pressure, while \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf06, \ud835\udf07, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d, 180 and T are the density, thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat capacity and temperature, respectively. 181 In Eq. (4), a heat source/sink term \ud835\udc46\u210e is added to account for the latent heat of evaporation at the feed side 182\n(sink) and permeate side (source). In Eqs. (5-6), \ud835\udc58 is the turbulent kinetic energy and \ud835\udf00 is the turbulent 183 dissipation rate, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f stands for the turbulent kinetic energy generation of velocity gradient and 184 buoyancy, respectively, whereas \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc40 contributes to the turbulent dissipation rate. \ud835\udf0e is the Prandtl number 185 while \ud835\udc361\ud835\udf00, \ud835\udc362\ud835\udf00, and \ud835\udc363\ud835\udf00 are constants. 186\n187 Fig.3. schematic of the 2-D spacer-filled DCMD model 188 189 Thermophysical properties of the porous membrane and polymeric spacers employed are tabulated in 190 Table 1. The membrane is characterized with a pore size of 100 nm, and a porosity of 80%. Experiments 191 were performed to evaluate temperature distribution along the DCMD module. Eventually, system metrics, 192 e.g., mass flux, thermal efficiency, are evaluated using a post processed data of computational fluid 193 dynamics (CFD) model that was previously described and validated in (El Kadi, Janajreh, et al., 2020). 194 Equations 9-12 in Table 2 describes each system metric of the DCMD process (Khayet & Matsuura, 2011). 195\nIt should be noted that \ud835\udc3d\" is the permeation mass flux, \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a is the membrane mass transfer coefficient 196 calculated using (Eq. 10) (T. C. Chen et al., 2009), while \u2206\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61 is the transmembrane saturation pressure 197 difference calculated using the Antoine equation (Eq. 11). \ud835\udf00 is the membrane porosity, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5d is the pore size, 198 \ud835\udf0f is the tortuosity, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc5a is the membrane thickness, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc64 is the molecular weight, \ud835\udc45 is gas constant, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc63 is the 199 water vapor dynamic viscosity, whereas \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5a are the membrane mean temperature and pressure, 200 respectively. \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61 is the saturation pressure calculated at each side of the membrane where \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc4f is the 201 temperature difference between membrane and bulk surfaces. In addition, \ud835\udf02 is the thermal efficiency of 202 DCMD process which is evaluated by the ratio of latent heat \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc63 to the overall transmembrane heat transfer 203 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5a. \u2206\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc5a is the latent heat of evaporation, \u210e is the heat transfer coefficient, \ud835\udc34 is the membrane surface area, 204 and \u2206\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5a is the transmembrane temperature difference. 205 The computational domain seen in Fig. 4 consists of almost 1.23 million cells with high quality. Inlet 206 Dirichlet boundary condition was assigned at the inlets of both channels, whereas Neumann boundary 207 condition with zero velocity gradient was set at the channels\u2019 outlets and zero heat flux at the outer walls. 208 Nonetheless, both membrane and spacer surfaces were thermally coupled with the surrounding flow. Both 209\nfeed and permeate enters the domain with a constant velocity of 0.1 m/s at a temperature of 75\u2103 and 25\u2103, 210 respectively. A numerical solution was sought for the above 2nd order, quasi-linear differential system using 211 volume of fluid approach by discretizing the flow domain using none structured grid made of quadratic 212\ncells. The solution was obtained by using Ansys/Fluent finite volume based segregated solver. The semi-213 implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) was utilized for pressure-velocity coupling. The 214 2nd order upwind scheme was used to spatially discretize momentum and energy. The convergence criterion 215 was set below 1\u00d710-10 for each of the continuity, two momentums, energy and k &  equations (Eqs. 1\u2013216 3). 217\n224 2.3. Proposed hybrid systems 225\nThe main concept of this work is to design an environmentally friendly ZLD system for RO brine reject 226 (~70 g/l) with the best water recovery and minimum energy consumption possible. Utilizing results 227 extracted from the FD and DCMD experimental and computational assessments, FD was selected as the 228 main technology for the RO brine feed. In the first scenario, six serial FD stages were evaluated for minimal 229 liquid discharge. Multistage freezing was necessary to achieve freshwater level salinity of the final product. 230 As seen in the flow chart of the 1st scenario (Fig.5), the first FD process is terminated when 20% of the total 231 volume is frozen, i.e., 30% crystallinity, while the crystallinity of the followed five stages was set at 20%. 232 The brine reject from each stage is the feed of the following FD stage, whereas the produced ice from each 233 FD stage is collected, melted, and tested for its salinity. Based on outcomes of the 1st scenario, (which will 234 be discussed deeply in the next section), the proposed system seems to be insufficient in meeting the ZLD 235 objectives. Thereby, three different hybridization scenarios are followed in attempts to achieve ZLD. 236 DCMD is utilized in scenarios 2, 3 and 4 to produce fresh water based on world health organization 237\n(WHO) standards (\u22640.05wt.%) (Organization, 1963). EFC unit will be also integrated as the last stage of 238 the system to increase water recovery and to produce solid salts from the hypersaline brine output of FD 239 and DCMD units assuming salt recovery of 99%. Eventually, the four scenarios shown in Fig. 5-8 are 240 evaluated. Different crystallinity ratios, number of FD stages, and DCMD membrane area were investigated 241 through the proposed scenarios. Anticipated products may include one or more of the following: solid salts, 242 hypersaline brine reject, seawater saline brine reject, and ultra-fresh water. 243\n244\nUltimately, water recovery (\ud835\udc4a) and specific energy consumption (SEC) are estimated according to 256\nEqs. 13-14 (listed in table 2) at each case. In the proposed ZLD systems, both freshwater and solid salts are 257 the valuable products. Therefore, SEC evaluation will not only cover the water production, but also salt. 258 SEC is evaluated without consideration of heat recovery. \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 is the total power consumption including all 259 sensible and latent heat consumption in the FD/MD/EFC units. The dominator of Eq. 14, ?\u0307?\ud835\udc53 and ?\u0307?\ud835\udc60 are 260 mass flow rates of the produced freshwater and salt, respectively. 261 262\n3. Results and Discussion 265\n3.1. FD unit results 266\nFD experiments were performed to evaluate the actual salinity of produced ice via batch freezing. 267 Gradual melting of the produced ice block has allowed salinity measurement at different crystallinity levels. 268\nThe quality of ice was evaluated at fixed crystallinity level of 50% to maintain consistency in results. 269 Crystallinity level refers to the volumetric weight percentage of the frozen ice starting from the freezing 270 shelf, e.g., 100% crystallinity means 1040 ml out of 1040 ml is frozen. Removal efficiency (R%) and 271 effective partition coefficient (K) at different initial concentrations are presented in Table 3. Both metrics 272 are highly influenced by the initial solution concentration (Co). Higher initial concentration shows lower 273 removal efficiency. Similarly, partition coefficient decreases at decreasing concentration. This can be 274 explained by the higher salt entrapments during the dendritic crystal growth at higher concentrations than 275 that at lower values. 276\nFig. 9 shows the measured cumulative salinity trends of the melted ice for different brine concentrations 277 using the procedures presented in Fig.1. Owing to the buoyancy forces and the direction of freezing, the 278 produced ice crystals included salt impurities with different extents. Moreover, the impurity level found to 279 be increasing at increased crystallinity level. Explaining Fig.9 further, by taking the 35 g/l brine as an 280 example, a minimum ice salinity of 8.5 g/l can be produced at 10% crystallinity. However, this value 281 increased by almost 1.9 times before reaching 50% crystallinity. This means that freezing half of the 35 g/l 282 brine solution will have a removal efficiency of no more than 53.7%. However, a removal efficiency of 283 74.8% can be achieved if only 10% of the solution is frozen. Thereby, these findings have promoted the 284 idea of multi-stage partial freezing of brine solution in order to reach the desired water purity level with 285 minimum energy required. 286 287\nTable 3.

Cumulative salinity during FD process at different brine solution 291 292 3.2. DCMD unit results 293\nDCMD process was evaluated at feed temperature of 75\u2070C, permeate temperature of 25\u2070C and inlet 294 velocity of 0.1 m/s. Accordingly, velocity and temperature distributions across the spacer filled DCMD 295\nmodel are shown in Fig. 10. Eventually, permeation mass flux (\ud835\udc3d\" ) and thermal efficiency () were 296 evaluated per Eq. 9 to Eq. 12 and illustrated in Fig. 11. On the average, the DCMD module was able to 297 produce 53.4 kg/(m2.h) of freshwater at an overall thermal efficiency of 69.23%. It is known that DCMD 298 membranes have up to 100% separation efficiency (Khayet & Matsuura, 2011), thereby, DCMD can be 299 hybridized in later stages with FD for ultrapure water production. 300\n3.3. Hybrid system optimization study 308\nExperimental results of FD unit showed that the removal efficiency decreases with the increase of 309 crystallinity level and initial concentration. Similarly, when going further in crystallization, energy 310 consumption is anticipated to increase. Partial freezing can result in producing ice at desired salinity and 311 effectively reduce unnecessary energy consumption. Based on results depicted in Fig. 9, and taking a 312 nominal value of the RO brine feed at 70 g/l flowing at 1 kg/hr, the first proposed treatment system (Fig. 313 5) assuming 30% ice crystallinity for the first FD stage and 20% ice crystallinity for the rest five stages is 314\nfollowed. The concentrated brine produced by the 1st FD stage is fed to the 2nd FD stage, and so the 315 following four stages. Without post-treatment, the produced ice is collected from the six stages as the final 316 product. Fig. 12 shows the mass flow rate of the freshwater produced and its associated salinity 317 measurement at each stage. Eventually, 77% of the main feed is recovered with an overall salinity of 39.53 318 g/l. Meanwhile, a very concentrated brine (~172 g/l) yet with relatively small quantities was unavoidable. 319 This value of produced ice salinity (3.95%) does not even meet the WHO criterion of brackish/irrigation 320 water, i.e. 0.05-0.2% (Organization, 1963), thereby, it can be either rejected back to sea as an 321 environmentally friendly reject or fed back to the RO plant intake. 322\n336 In attempts to reduce number of FD stages involved, another case was assessed using three successive 337 FD units. In this case however, the produced ice is melted and frozen again in the next FD unit as illustrated 338 in Fig. 7. The goal of this combination is to produce water at same salinity level of seawater (~35 g/l) to 339 allow environmentally friendly disposal. Other byproducts including pure water and ice is also possible. 340 Studying salinity curves in Fig. 9, ice recovery of 82% was then selected to achieve the desired salinity 341 (~35 g/l). Fig. 13 shows the mass flow rate and salinity of ice blocks in each stage. The produced brine 342 from the three FD stages is further concentrated via DCMD to reach the eutectic point concentration. 343 Eventually, the highly concentrated brine (~219 g/l) is fed to the EFC unit to produce freshwater and solid 344 salts. The system has overall pure water recovery of 40.2% with salinity of 70 mg/l. This reduction in water 345 recovery is because 54% of the initial feed is rejected back to sea at salinity of 34.8 g/l. Moreover, the 346\nproposed scenario is capable of producing 1.2 kg of valuable salt per day. It is also worth noting that the 347 membrane area used in this configuration is less than the one used in the previous system by almost 66%. 348\n359\nFig. 14. Water production and its associated salinity at each stage of the proposed multistage FD system: 4th 360 study 361 3.4. Specific energy consumption (SEC) 362\nCareful optimization of the coefficient of performance (COP) value of 5.62 was used, where latent heat 363 of 334 kJ/kg for the crystallization is utilized for multi-stage FD and EFC units assuming room temperature 364 of 20\u2070C and freezing temperature of -15\u2070C (El Kadi et al., 2021). For DCMD, CFD modelling showed a 365 thermal efficiency of 69.23% achieved under operating conditions. Fig.15 illustrates the SEC values for 366 different scenarios compared to its water recovery and ice salinity. The model shows that SEC is highest 367 (114.5 kWh/m3) when higher ice crystallinity is involved, i.e., 3rd scenario. Comparable SEC values of 37.1 368 kWh/m3 and 33.8 kWh/m3 were reported for the 2nd and 4th scenarios, respectively. The common factor 369 between these two studies was the amount of freshwater recovery; the 4th scenario however involves four 370 FD units less than the 2nd one. It is also remarkable the low SEC value of the first scenario (28.02 kWh/m3) 371 at which no MD or EFC units are involved. Nevertheless, the produced water is not in the freshwater level 372 and thus cannot be considered consumable. Although, the SEC of the best performance cases (2nd and 4th 373 scenarios) seems high compared to others, it is crucial to highlight that ZLD is achieved in these hybrid 374 systems. On the other hand, renewable energy or waste heat source should be hybridized to achieve 375 competitive SEC values for a sustainable ZLD application. 376\nIn this work, four different scenarios of MLD/ZLD systems were proposed for a sustainable RO 382 brine treatment strategy. The system is based on the freeze desalination (FD) technology associated with 383 direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and eutectic freeze crystallization (EFC) for added value 384 production. ZLD designed systems were based on optimized experimental conditions of FD and MD units. 385 FD experiments were conducted in a batch progressive crystallizer where different solution concentrations 386\nwere evaluated for their removal efficiency and effective partition coefficient. FD experiments clearly 387 indicated the impossibility of having freshwater production from a single stage freezing. Also, reduced ice 388 quality with lower removal efficiency is produced at increased brine salinity. Moreover, a spacer filled 389 DCMD unit was assessed using an experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. 390 Polymeric spacers seem to enhance the DCMD performance where an average mass flux of 53.4 l/(m2.h) 391 and thermal efficiency of 69.23% is achieved at optimum conditions. Eventually, four FD/DCMD/EFC 392 systems with different recovery ratios and membrane areas were proposed and evaluated theoretically. ZLD 393 was best achieved with 93.1% water recovery and reasonable energy consumption of 33.8 kWh/m3. More 394 importantly, the ZLD systems was capable of producing freshwater (~41 mg/l) that is purer than the world 395 health organization (WHO) standards for drinkable water (500 mg/l). Further hybridization with renewable 396 energy source or waste heat is recommended for low-cost ZLD design. 397\n5.
