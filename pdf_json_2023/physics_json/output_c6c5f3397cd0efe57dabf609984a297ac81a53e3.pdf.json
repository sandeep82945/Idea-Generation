SAMHD1, a dNTPase protecting cells from viral infections, has been recently found to participate in DNA damage repair process. However, its role in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that SAMHD1 is up-regulated in early-stage human carcinoma tissues and cell lines under oxidative stress or genotoxic insults. We further demonstrate that de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP7 interacts with SAMHD1 and de-ubiquitinates it at lysine 421, thus stabilizing SAMHD1 protein expression for further interaction with CtIP for DDR, which promotes tumor cell survival under genotoxic stress. Furthermore, SAMHD1 levels positively correlates with USP7 in various human carcinomas, and is associated with an unfavorable survival outcome in patients who underwent chemotherapy. Moreover, USP7 inhibitor sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents by decreasing SAMHD1 in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that de-ubiquitination of SAMHD1 by USP7 promotes DDR to overcome oncogenic stress and affect chemotherapy sensitivity.\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843\u20131856; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-023-02667-w"

            "text": "Balance between DNA damage and DNA damage repair (DDR) enable cells to maintain genome integrity against endogenous and exogenous insults [1]. An underlying hallmark of cancers is their genomic instability, which is characterized by a greater propensity to accumulate DNA damage [2]. As a result, cancer cells demonstrate increased genomic instability and a greater dependency on DDR pathways to overcome frequent DNA damage [3]. A variety of chemotherapeutics induce DNA damage to kill tumor cells. However, activated DDR in cancer cells can repair DNA damage induced by genotoxic insults thus leading to chemotherapy insensitivity [4]. Therefore, understanding the key regulators and mechanisms orchestrating DDR may potentially elucidate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and provide novel therapeutic target for cancer patients [5]. SAMHD1, an important dNTP hydrolase, maintains nucleic acid metabolism and genome stability by regulating the abundance of the dNTP pool in cells [6, 7]. The enzyme was first found to be\ncorrelated with Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, suggesting that SAMHD1 participates in immune regulation and innate immunity [8, 9]. In addition, SAMHD1 restricts DNA viruses and retroviruses by virtue of its dNTP hydrolysis ability, and this direct action on viral genetic material has a broad spectrum [10]. At present, most of the studies focused on the importance of antiviral role of SAMHD1 [11], while the potential role of SAMHD1 in tumorigenesis and therapy remains largely elusive. Recently, SAMHD1 was found to promotes DNA end resection to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by interacting with CtIP independent of its dNTP hydrolysis ability [12]. DSBs are the most cytotoxic type of DNA damage, as unrepaired or inappropriate repair of DSBs inevitably causes mutations or chromosomal aberrations [13]. Considering its role in DNA damage repair, SAMHD1 might be implicated in tumorigenesis and response to chemotherapy in cancer. Emerging evidence have indicated that multiple post-translational protein modifications including ubiquitination are actively involved in the DDR process [14, 15]. Deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) is\nReceived: 12 August 2022 Revised: 2 March 2023 Accepted: 13 March 2023 Published online: 20 April 2023\n1The College of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. 2Key Laboratory of Cell Biology of Ministry of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology of Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Tumors (China Medical University), Ministry of Education, Liaoning Province Collaborative Innovation Center of Aging Related Disease Diagnosis and Treatment and Prevention, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. 3Department of Developmental Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology, Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. 4Department of Anus and Intestine Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. 5Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. \u2709email: xysong@cmu.edu.cn; josieon826@sina.cn; xcz1966@126.com; lcao@cmu.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/oncOncogene\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nresponsible for removing the ubiquitination modification of the substrate, maintaining the stability of the substrate, and preventing it from degradation by the proteasome [16]. Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) constitute the largest DUB subfamily, of which USP7 is a key deubiquitinating enzyme stabilizing multiple substrates through deubiquitination, thereby regulating a variety of cellular processes including immune response, virus replication, and cancer [17\u201320]. USP7 has previously been reported to regulate DDR proteins: USP7 modulates the engagement of the MRN-MDC1 complex and the consequent recruitment of the downstream factors at DNA lesions; [21] USP7 is essential for maintaining stability of Rad18 [22] and RNF168 [23] for DDR; In addition, USP7 controls the stability of Chk1, an essential checkpoint kinase in DDR [24]. In this study, we have demonstrated that USP7 interacts with SAMHD1 at the HD domain and deubiquitinates SAMHD1 at K421, thus stabilizing SAMHD1 by reducing its degradation via proteasome pathway. USP7-stabilized SAMHD1 promotes DDR by interacting with DSB repair initiator CtIP, therefore repairing DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or genotoxic insults. Attesting to the function, both USP7 and SAMHD1 proteins were highly expressed in human carcinomas of various organs and their expressions were positively correlated. Most importantly, the USP7 inhibitor sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy by decreasing SAMHD1, which implies the potential of targeting USP7SAMHD1-CtIP axis to improve chemosensitivity.\nRESULTS USP7 interacts with SAMHD1 at the HD domain and stabilizes its protein expression Although the ubiquitination modification of SAMHD1 has been widely reported [25\u201327], the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) of SAMHD1 is still unknown. We next performed mass spectroscopy to identify potential molecules interacting with SAMHD1 (Fig. 1A). The observations in this regard suggested that USP7 might be a specific DUB for SAMHD1, a notion supported by the subsequent co-immunoprecipitation assays in HCT116 (Fig. 1B, C), Hela (Fig. S1A), HEK293 (Fig. S1B), A549 (Fig. S1C, D) and TPC-1 (Fig. S1E, F) cells. The USP7-SAMDH1 interaction was confirmed by the in vitro glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays (Fig. 1D, E). Furthermore, co-localization of USP7 and SAMHD1 were observed by confocal microscopy in Hela cells (Fig. 1F). To identify the specific USP7 binding domain in SAMHD1, we constructed different GST-SAMHD1 fusion proteins lacking each domain for the subsequent GST-pulldown assays (Fig. 2G). To that end, GSTSAMHD1 lacking the HD domain failed to interact with USP7 (Fig. 2H) while the HD domain of SAMHD1 interact with USP7 (Fig. 2I), suggesting that it is essential for USP7-SAMHD1 interaction. DUB deubiquitinates substrate and maintains the stability of the substrate, preventing it from degradation by the proteasome [28]. We next examined the effect of USP7 on SAMHD1 stability by overexpressing USP7 in HCT116 cells. To that end, SAMHD1 protein levels were gradually increased with the increased amount of USP7 plasmids transfected (Fig. 2A). Consistent results were found in lung cancer A549 and thyroid cancer TPC-1 cells (Fig. S1G, H). In contrast, all three different siRNAs for USP7 reduced SAMHD1 expression in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B). P5091, a specific USP7 inhibitor, decreased SAMHD1 levels in both concentration and time dependent manners in HCT116 (Fig. 2C; Fig. S1K) and H1299 (Fig. S1J) cells, respectively. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 prolonged the half-life of SAMHD1 protein under CHX treatment, suggesting that ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway is a key manner for SAMHD1 protein degradation (Fig. 2D, E). Overexpressing USP7 wildtype also lengthened the half-life of SAMHD1 protein, in contrast to the effect of USP7 C223S, an inactivation mutant of the deubiquitination enzyme (Fig. 2F, G). Conversely, stable knockdown of USP7 (Fig. 2H, I) or treatment with P5091 shortened the half-life of SAMHD1 (Fig. 2J, K).\nUSP7 deubiquitinates SAMHD1 K48-linked polyubiquitination at K421 To explore the effect of USP7 on SAMHD1 ubiquitination, we next overexpressed Flag-USP7. As a result, deubiquitination of SAMHD1 protein was found in HCT116 (Fig. 3A), HEK293 (Fig. S1L), A549 (Fig. S1M), and TPC-1 (Fig. S1N) cells, respectively. In contrast, stable knockdown of USP7 induced ubiquitination of SAMHD1 protein in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3B). Administration of P5091 significantly increased ubiquitination of SAMHD1 protein in HCT116 (Fig. 3C), SW480 (Fig. S1O), Hela (Fig. S1P) and HEK293 (Fig. S1Q) cells, respectively. In addition, overexpressing USP7 deubiquitinating enzyme inactivation mutant plasmid C223S failed to deubiquitinate SAMHD1 (Fig. 3D). We next sought to identify the specific deubiquitination sites of SAMHD1 protein by USP7 via ubiquitination site mass spectrometry, which is a approach to indicate ubiquitination sites by high throughput screening for each potential lysine. The study to that end revealed K421, K492, K494 as potential ubiquitination sites (Fig. S2A-C). Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed decreased ubiquitination when lysine (K) K421 or K492 of SAMHD1 was substituted by arginine (R) (Fig. S2E). Further experiments demonstrated that SAMHD1 K492R and K494R, but not K421R, could be deubiquitinated by USP7, indicating that K421 is the specific site for USP7 deubiquitinating SAMHD1 (Fig. 3E-G). K421 is evolutionarily conservative across different species (Fig. S2D). In addition, USP7 overexpression does not significantly affect SAMHD1 K421R stability (Fig. S2F); while USP7 siRNA does not significantly affect SAMHD1 K421R stability (Fig. S2G). SAMHD1 has previously been shown to be ubiquitinated at K622 by TRIM21 and also ubiquitinated by CRL4/DCAF1, both of which target SAMHD1 for proteasomal degradation. We suggested that K421 is not the specific site for these E3 ligases, and USP7 could not deubiquitinate K622 site (Fig. S2H-J). Lastly, we transfected different HA-Ub plasmids including WT, K0, K48 and K63 along with USP7 and SAMHD1. To that end, USP7 specifically removes K48-linked polyubiquitination of SAMHD1 (Fig. 3H).\nSAMHD1 promotes cell survival and reduces apoptosis under genotoxic insults It has been recently reported that SAMHD1 participates in DNA damage repair. This has led us to explore the effect of SAMHD1 on tumor cell survival under genotoxic insults. Consequently, stable knockdown of SAMHD1 significantly reduces the survival rate of HCT116 and SW480 cells in a cisplatin and doxorubicin concentration-dependent manner, respectively (Figs. 4A, 5C; Fig. S3A). In contrast, stable overexpression Flag-SAMHD1 in shSAMHD1 colon cancer cells increases the survival rate in a cisplatin and doxorubicin concentration-dependent manner, respectively (Fig. 4B, D; Fig. S3B). Moreover, SAMHD1 promotes cell survival in a cisplatin treatment time-dependent manner under genotoxic insults in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively (Fig. S3C\u2013F). We next investigated the effect of SAMHD1 on the apoptosis of tumor cells induced by genotoxic insults. Under the treatment of cisplatin, shSAMHD1 cells demonstrated significantly increased apoptosis when compared to shNC cells, while stably expressing Flag-SAMHD1 cells significantly decreased apoptosis when compared to vector cells stably expressing Flag in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively (Figs. 4E, F; Fig. S3G, H). To elucidate whether the inhibitory effect of SAMHD1 on cell apoptosis depends on its ability of dNTP hydrolase, we stably expressed H206A/H207A SAMHD1 with no dNTP hydrolase activity in shSAMHD1 HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively. Under the treatment of cisplatin, SAMHD1 wild-type and SAMHD1 AA both suppressed cell apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 cells, respectively, with no statistical difference between their inhibitory effects, suggesting that SAMHD1 inhibition of cell apoptosis does not depend on the dNTP hydrolase activity (Fig. 4G). This notion was further confirmed by western blot analysis, in which significant increased\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\napoptotic markers cleaved-PARP and cleaved-Caspase 3, and DSB marker \u03b3H2AX were observed in shSAMDH1 cells under the treatment of cisplatin, when compared to shNC cells. In addition, stably expressing Flag-SAMHD1 in shSAMHD1 colon cancer cells significantly decreased cleaved-PARP, cleaved-Caspase 3 and \u03b3H2AX when compared to Flag vector (Fig. 4H). Moreover, cisplatin induced formation of SAMHD1 and CtIP foci and their co-localization with \u03b3H2AX, respectively (Fig. S3I; J).\nGenotoxic insults or ROS induces deubiquitination and increase of SAMHD1 for DNA damage repair It is widely known that chemotherapeutics elevate intracellular ROS levels, which contributes to their genotoxicity [29, 30]. We have thereby further verified that cisplatin and doxorubicin increase SAMHD1 protein expression without altering its mRNA\nlevel (Fig. 4I, J, Fig. S4H, I). Moreover, these agents induce the deubiquitination of SAMHD1 protein (Fig. 4K, S4J) and promote the interaction of SAMHD1 and CtIP (Fig. S4M, N). The occurrence and development of tumors are accompanied by the up-regulation of ROS and the accumulation of DNA damage, and ROS can induce DNA damage and activate the DNA damage response signaling [31, 32]. We found that oxidative stress generated by H2O2 elevated SAMHD1 in HCT116 cells (Fig. S4A), HEK293 cells (Fig S4C), and H1299 (Fig. S4E), thus confirming the change of SAMHD1 in response to oxidative stress. In addition, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a scavenger of free radicals, significantly inhibited the SAMHD1 increase induced by H2O2 (Fig. S4B, Fig. S4D, F). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed unchanged mRNA levels of SAMHD1 upon ROS stimulation (Fig. S4G), suggesting that post-translational modifications rather than transcriptional\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\nregulation is responsible for SAMHD1 protein overexpression. Indeed, the ubiquitination of SAMHD1 was significantly decreased under the stimulation of ROS (Fig. S4K, Fig. S4L), thus further supporting the importance of deubiquitination in upregulating SAMHD1 protein under oxidative stress. Previous studies have suggested that SAMHD1 promotes DNA end resection to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair by interacting with CtIP. In the current study, we have demonstrated that ROS promotes the interaction of SAMHD1 and CtIP (Fig. S4O\u2013Q). This is in keeping with the observations that H2O2 induces formation of SAMHD1\nand CtIP foci as well as their co-localization with DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX, respectively (Fig. S3K, Fig. S3L). In addition, the colocalization between SAMHD1 and CtIP upon cisplatin treatment was also observed (Fig. S3M).\nThe USP7-SAMHD1 axis interactions facilitate cell survival and reduce apoptosis under genotoxic insults To further elucidate the regulation of USP7 on SAMHD1 protein stability, we next explored the effect of USP7-SAMHD1 axis on tumor cell survival under genotoxic insults. First, cisplatin,\nFig. 2 USP7 stabilizes the expression of SAMHD1.

Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (***P < 0.001).\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\ndoxorubicin, H2O2 was found to promote the binding of USP7 and SAMHD1 (Fig. 4L; Fig. S5A\u2013C). We found that the stabilization of SAMHD1 by USP7 were heightened in the presence of DNA damage agents (Figure S1I). Besides, the decrease of SAMHD1 ubiquitination by USP7 were also heightened in response to DNA damage agents (Figure S1R). The co-localization between SAMHD1 and USP7 upon cisplatin treatment was also observed (Fig. 4M). Furthermore, the USP7 inhibitor P5091 suppresses the increase of SAMHD1 protein induced by cisplatin or doxorubicin (Fig. 4N; Fig. S5D). In addition, the formation of SAMHD1 foci and co-localization with DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX induced by\ncisplatin was significantly inhibited by P5091 (Fig. 5A, B). Similar findings were obtained with respect to the downstream CtIP foci and co-localization with \u03b3H2AX (Fig. 5C, D), suggesting that USP7SAMHD1-CtIP axis contributes to DDR induced by chemotherapeutic agents. As for cell apoptosis, shUSP7 cells demonstrated significantly increased apoptosis when compared to shNC cells under the treatment of cisplatin or doxorubicin, whereas stably expressing Flag-SAMHD1 cells in shUSP7 cells showed significantly decreased apoptosis when compared to the HCT116 cells stably expressing the Flag vector (Fig. 5F; Fig. S5G, H). Stable knockdown of\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\nUSP7 significantly reduced the survival rate of HCT116 cells in a cisplatin and doxorubicin concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, stable overexpression of Flag-SAMHD1 in shUSP7 HCT116 cells increased the survival rate (Fig. 5H; Fig. S5E, F). P5091\ntreatment significantly increased apoptosis induced by cisplatin or doxorubicin (Fig. 5E; Fig. S5I). The results were further confirmed by western blot analysis, in which apoptotic markers cleaved-PARP and cleaved-Caspase 3 and DSB marker \u03b3H2AX were significantly\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\nincreased in shUSP7 HCT116 cells when compared to shNC cells under treatment of cisplatin. In addition, stably expressing FlagSAMHD1 in shUSP7 HCT116 cells significantly decreased cleavedPARP, cleaved-Caspase 3 and \u03b3H2AX when compared to cells expressing Flag vector (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, HCT116 cells transfected with USP7 WT-SAMHD1 WT demonstrated increased survival rate compared to USP7 C223S-SAMHD1 WT, USP7 WT- SAMHD1 K421R or USP7 C223SSAMHD1 K421R in a cisplatin time-dependent manner (Fig S5J). Similarly, USP7 WT-SAMHD1 WT demonstrated reduced cell apoptosis rate compared to other groups (Fig S5K). Both SAMHD1 WT and SAMHD1 K421R could reduce cell apoptosis rate compared to Flag vector in HCT116 shUSP7 cells (Fig S5L). SAMHD1 WT and H206A/H207A SAMHD1 both increased the survival rate under cisplatin treatment compared to Flag in shUSP7 HCT116 cells with no significant difference (Fig S5M).\nSAMHD1 and USP7 are highly expressed in multiple cancer tissues A number of previous studies have indicated the implication of SAMHD1 in the initiation and development of cancer, while inconsistent findings have been obtained in different tumor types [33]. To explore the role of SAMHD1 in tumorigenesis, we first examined the SAMHD1 expression by immunohistochemistry in several early-stage (stages I and II) human cancers including colonic and lung adenocarcinomas as well as thyroid carcinoma. To that end, semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SAMHD1 was highly expressed in carcinomas when compared to their paired peritumor tissues, suggesting that SAMHD1 might be implicated in tumor progression (Fig. 6A\u2013F; Fig. S6A\u2013C). Moreover, significantly higher levels of USP7 were found in colonic and lung adenocarcinomas as well as thyroid carcinoma when compared to their paired peritumoral tissues (Fig. 6G\u2013L; Fig. S6D\u2013F).\nInhibition of the USP7-SAMHD1 axis improves chemosensitivity To further explore the role of USP7-SAMHD1 in human cancers, semiquantitative immunohistochemical analyses for USP7 and SAMHD1 were performed in tumorous tissues. A significant positive correlation between USP7 and SAMHD1 expression was identified in all three tumor types, suggesting that the existence of the USP7-SAMHD1 axis in various human cancers (Fig. 7A\u2013C). Furthermore, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) also indicate a positive correlation between USP7 and SAMHD1 expressions in various cancer types (Figs. 7D, E; Fig. S7E\u2013L). In addition, co-localization of USP7 and SAMHD1 was identified in colonic adenocarcinoma tissues while this phenomenon was only rarely observed in peritumoral tissues (Fig. 7F).\nWe then analyzed the potential prognostic significance of SAMHD1 expression in patients with various cancers who received chemotherapy according to TCGA data. To that end, a higher SAMHD1 expression is significantly associated with an unfavorable survival outcome in patients with colonic adenocarcinoma (Hazard ratio [HR]= 2.15, P= 0.020), lung adenocarcinoma (HR= 3.34, P= 0.030), and glioblastoma (HR= 1.99, P= 0.034) and glioma (HR= 1.56, P= 0.026), suggesting that SAMHD1 may contribute to chemotherapy insensitivity in these cancers (Fig. 8A\u2013D; Fig. S7A\u2013D). Prognostic analysis of USP7 expression in patients with various cancers who received chemotherapy according to TCGA data demonstrated no significant association with survival outcome (P > 0.05)(Fig S7M\u2013P), which might be attributed to the various substrates and multiple functions for USP7. Using a nude mice model, we further explored the effect of the USP7-SAMDH1 axis on chemosensitivity. We injected stable SAMHD1 knockdown (shSAMHD1) or control (shNC) HCT116 cells subcutaneously into the nude mice. The shNC mice were randomly divided into groups administrated intraperitoneally with vehicle, cisplatin, P5091, or P5091 together with cisplatin twice a week; while the shSAMHD1 mice were divided into groups treated with vehicle or cisplatin twice a week. Consequently, the results showed that shSAMHD1 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin when compared to shNC cells as determined by tumor volume (Fig. 8E, F) and weight (Fig. 8G). Importantly, administration of P5091 sensitized HCT116 cells to cisplatin (Fig. 8E\u2013G). Taken together, the findings suggest that SAMHD1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, and that the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and USP7 inhibition might improve chemotherapy sensitivity in various cancers (Fig. 8H)."

            "text": "The observations in this study have demonstrated that SAMHD1 is associated with and stabilized by the deubiquitinase USP7 at K421. Further, SAMHD1 is upregulated in various early-stage human carcinomas and positively correlated with USP7. Furthermore, USP7-stabilized SAMHD1 promotes DDR by interacting with DSB initiator CtIP, thus resulting in DNA damage repair induced by ROS and genotoxic insults. Importantly, USP7 inhibitor sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy by decreasing SAMHD1, suggesting that SAMHD1 stabilization by USP7 promotes DNA damage repair to overcome oncogenic stress and affect chemotherapy sensitivity. Tumorigenesis is accompanied by up-regulation of ROS and accumulation of DNA damage, and the former can induce DNA damage and activate the DNA damage repair signaling [34, 35]. SAMHD1 reportedly promotes DNA end resection to facilitate DNA DSB repair by interacting with CtIP independent of its dNTP\nFig. 4 SAMHD1 increases cell survival and reduces apoptosis under genotoxic insults.

In addition, SAMHD1 facilitates degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks in the replication stress response [36]. Our findings in human cancerous tissues suggest that SAMHD1 might be implicated in early-stage carcinomas to\novercome elevated DNA damage and oncogenic stress. In eukaryotic cells, ubiquitination plays an essential role in the assembly as well as disassembly of DDR factors at break sites [37, 38]. Both ROS and genotoxic insults, such as cisplatin or\nOncogene (2023) 42:1843 \u2013 1856\ndoxorubicin, may increase SAMHD1 by inducing its protein deubiquitination and promote the interaction of SAMHD1 with CtIP for DDR. These findings have indicated a novel deubiqutination regulation of SAMHD1 during tumorigenesis. SAMHD1 has been known as an effector in innate immunity, a restrictor for retroviruses, and a regulator in the cell cycle, which largely depends on its ubiquitination regulatory mechanism [39]. To escape restriction by SAMHD1, HIV-2 and SIV viruses evolved viron-associated Vpx protein degrades SAMHD1 through proteasome pathway via hijacking the Cul4A/DDB1/DCAF1 E3 ligase [40]. It has been recently reported that TRIM21 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase of SAMHD1 for its degradation in enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection [27]. However, the specific deubiquitinase of SAMHD1 still remains unclear. In this study, we have found for the first time that USP7, a pivotal deubiquitinase, directly interacts with the HD domain of SAMHD1 and stabilizes SAMHD1 from degradation through the proteasomal pathway. Colocalization of USP7 and SAMHD1 has been further confirmed by confocal microscopy. Specifically, USP7 increases expression and prolongs the half-life of SAMHD1 protein by reducing its K48-linked polyubiquitination at K421. K421 is the predominant site of SAMHD1 polyubiquitination for degradation. In addition, K492 site of SAMHD1 is not the predominant site that USP7 deubiquitinate SAMHD1, which might participate in biological processes other than protein degradation. These findings provide further insight into potential specific regulation of SAMHD1 dysfunction. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents induce DNA damage to kill tumor cells, while overexuberant DDR contributes to chemoresistance and worse prognosis in various tumor types [41, 42]. The involvement of SAMHD1 in DNA damage repair suggests a potential role of SAMHD1 in regulating chemosensitivity. Indeed, SAMHD1 knockdown significantly increases chemosensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin in tumor cells. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents induce DNA damage and apoptosis in cancer cells [43, 44]. Under the treatment of chemotherapy drugs, SAMHD1 significantly inhibits apoptosis independent of its dNTP hydrolase activity. Several previous studies have obtained similar results in this regard. For example, targeting SAMHD1 by the Vpx protein has been found to benefit cytarabine therapy for hematological malignancies [45]. Moreover, SAMHD1 expression levels determine acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell response to nelarabine [46]. Therefore, these findings, along with our observations, suggest that SAMHD1 is a potential therapeutic target for improving chemotherapy efficacy in treating malignancies. Emerging evidence has suggested the implication of USP7 in initiation and development of cancer [47\u201349]. For instance, USP7 deubiquitinates and stabilizes N-myc protein to promote neuroblastoma progression [50]. In addition, USP7 deubiquitinates \u03b2-catenin and activate Wnt signaling to promote colon cancer development [51]. We found that the USP7-SAMHD1 axis contribute to the DDR and chemotherapy insensitivity of cancer cells. Importantly, inhibition of USP7 suppresses chemotherapeutic agents-induced SAMHD1 expression and prevents the formation of SAMHD1 or CtIP foci and their co-localization with \u03b3H2AX. Further, activation of the USP7-SAMHD1 axis reduces chemosensitivity and inhibits apoptosis. Attesting to function, USP7 was highly expressed\nin a variety of tumoral tissues and positively correlated with the SAMHD1 expression. Moreover, the patients with high SAMHD1expressing tumors who received chemotherapy had unfavorable survival outcomes. Administration of USP7 inhibitor P5091 (25mg/ kg) has been found to decrease the growth rate of tumor in vivo. In this study, we used relatively low concentration of P5091 (5mg/kg) to treat the tumor in vivo. As a result, the tumor volume and weight showed no significant change after P5091 treatment alone. But the tumor volume and weight were decreased in \u201cP5091 and cisplatin\u201d group. We further demonstrated that blockade of USP7 by its specific inhibitor P5091 sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin using a nude mice model, thus further indicating its potential role in chemotherapy sensitivity. In summary, we have identified a deubiquitination-dependent regulatory mechanism of the USP7-SAMHD1 axis for sustaining DNA damage repair in tumorigenesis and cell survival under genotoxic insults. These findings suggest that SAMHD1 may be a potential biomarker for chemosensitivity, and that combination of chemotherapy and USP7 inhibition may potentially help improve chemotherapy sensitivity in various cancer types."

After deparaffinizing in xylene and rehydrating in graded ethanol, tissue microarrays were immersed in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30min. To decrease the nonspecific staining, 10% normal goat serum was subsequently used to block tissue collagen for 30min. Tissue sections were then incubated with antibody anti-SAMHD1 (ab128107, 1:2000, Abcam) or USP7 (NB100-513, 1:1000, NOVUS) for 60minutes at room temperature (24\u201327 \u00b0C). After that, biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidinbiotin peroxidase were used to incubate tissue sections for 10min each in turn. Slides were stained with DAB chromogenic reagent for 60 s, afterwards counterstained with hematoxylin. UltraSensitiveTM SPIHC Kit(KIT-9720, Maixin Inc., Fujian, China) were used in this experiment. The stained sections were reviewed and scored by two investigators independently who were blinded to the clinical information. We adopted a semi-quantitative scoring method to assess the expression of SAMHD1 and USP7. The staining intensity was divided into 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The percentage of cells stained was categorized as 0 (0\u20135%), 1 (6\u201325%), 2 (26\u201350%), 3 (51\u201375), and 4 (76\u2013100%).
