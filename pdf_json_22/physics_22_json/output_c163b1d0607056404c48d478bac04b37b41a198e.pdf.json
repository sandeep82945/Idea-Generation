    "abstractText": "We update the Standard Model (SM) predictions for the branching ratios of the rare top-quark decays t \u2192 cg(g), and evaluate the maximum rates that can be reached in the aligned as well as in the four conventional two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) with Z2 symmetries. Taking into account the relevant constraints on the model parameters resulting from a global fit obtained at the 95.5% confidence level, we find that the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays can reach up to 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22129 respectively, being therefore of the same order, in the aligned 2HDM (A2HDM). This is obviously different from the SM case, where the predicted branching ratio of the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg. On the other hand, compared with the SM predictions, no significant enhancements are observed in the four conventional 2HDMs withZ2 symmetries for the branching ratios of these two decays. Nevertheless, the predicted branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the A2HDM are still out of the expected sensitivities of the future high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-",

            "text": "The top quark, as the heaviest elementary particle in the Standard Model (SM), can decay into other light quarks associated with gauge or scalar bosons. Among all the possible decay modes, the flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) decays of the top quark, which are absent at tree level and suppressed at loop level by the Glashow\u2013Iliopoulos\u2013Maiani (GIM) mechanism [1] in the SM, are very sensitive to contributions from new physics (NP) [2\u201336]. For the two-body FCNC top-quark decays t \u2192 qV and t \u2192 qh, withq = c, u, V = \u03b3, Z , g, and h the SM Higgs, their branching ratios are predicted to be of the orders of 10\u221217 to 10\u221212 within the SM, but could be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in many NP scenarios (see, e.g., Refs. [35,36] and references therein). Among the three-body loop-induced topquark decays t \u2192 cV V and t \u2192 u1u\u03042u2 with ui = u, c, the decay t \u2192 cgg has the largest branching ratio, reaching up to about 1.02 \u00d7 10\u22129 within the SM [37\u201339]. Interestingly, it is found that the branching ratio of the three-body\ndecay t \u2192 cgg is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg within the SM [39], a phenomenon that will be dubbed \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d and has also been revealed in the bottom- and charm-quark decays [40\u201346]. Although their SM rates are predicted to be far below the detectable level of present and future colliders, these rare FCNC top-quark decays have been widely studied in various NP models, and significant enhancements are observed relative to the SM expectations; the most prominent examples are the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [2\u201314] and the supersymmetry [15\u201325], within which these rare topquark decays might be even detectable at the future colliders. Especially, it is interesting to check if the \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d phenomenon observed in t \u2192 cg(g) decays within the SM [39] is still valid for a viable NP model.\nAmong the various NP scenarios, the 2HDM [47] provides a minimal extension of the SM scalar sector by adding a second scalar doublet with hypercharge Y = 1/2, and can naturally satisfy the electroweak precision tests, giving rise at the same time to a very rich phenomenology [48,49]. In a generic 2HDM, the non-diagonal couplings of the neutral scalars to the SM fermions would unavoidably lead to non-vanishing tree-level FCNC interactions. To avoid these unwanted tree-level FCNC couplings, an ad-hoc discrete Z2 symmetry is often imposed on the Yukawa sector of the model [50]. Depending on the Z2 charge assignments to the scalars and fermions, this results in four types of 2HDMs (types I, II, X, Y) [48,49] under the hypothesis of natural flavour conservation [50]. In the aligned 2HDM (A2HDM) [51], on the other hand, the absence of tree-level FCNC interactions is automatically guaranteed by assuming the alignment in flavour space of the two Yukawa matrices for each type of the right-handed fermions. Interestingly, the A2HDM can recover, as particular cases, all the known specific implementations of the conventional 2HDMs based on Z2 symmetries. The model is also featured by possible new sources of CP violation beyond that of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [52,53]. Thus, the A2HDM has been widely studied from the various theoretical points of view [54\u201359], as well as for its phenomenologies in the lowenergy flavour physics [60\u201375], the electric dipole moments of the leptons, the neutron and various atoms [76\u201379], the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [80\u201385], and the high-energy collider physics [12,86\u2013101]. Recently, assuming that there are no new sources of CP violation beyond the CKM quark-mixing matrix, and taking into account the most constraining processes and observables mentioned above, together with the theoretical requirements of perturbativity and positivity of the scalar potential, a detailed global fit has been performed to the A2HDM [75].\nIn this paper, we shall perform a detailed study of the rare top-quark decay t \u2192 cgg and its comparison with the two-body decay t \u2192 cg in the A2HDM as well as in\nthe four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries. Taking into account the relevant constraints on the model parameters from a global fit obtained at the 95.5% confidence level (CL) [75], we find that the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays can reach up to 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22129 respectively, being therefore of the same order, in the A2HDM. This is obviously different from the SM case, where the predicted branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of t \u2192 cg [39]. On the other hand, compared with the SM predictions, no significant enhancements are observed in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries for the branching ratios of these two decays. Searches for the decay t \u2192 cg have been performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with the upper limit on its branching ratio being of O(10\u22124) [102,103], which is still much higher than the model predictions. These rare FCNC decays will also be studied at the future experiments, such as the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [104\u2013108] and the Future Circular Collider (FCC) [109\u2013112]. For example, the 95%- CL limit on the branching ratio of t \u2192 cg at the 100-TeV FCC in hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab\u22121 is estimated to be of O(10\u22127\u201310\u22128) [113,114], which is at least one order of magnitude higher than the maximum value predicted in the A2HDM. As a consequence, the predicted branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the A2HDM are still out of the expected sensitivities of the future HL-LHC and FCC-hh.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we recapitulate the A2HDM, focusing only on the scalar and Yukawa sectors that are most relevant to us. In Sect. 3, we present our calculation of the decay rates of t \u2192 cg(g) decays, with the resulting R functions present in the t \u2192 cgg decay supplemented in Appendix A. Our numerical results are then given in Sect. 4, where we show the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg(g) decays that can be reached in the A2HDM, and give also a simple analysis of these two decays in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries. Our conclusion is finally made in Sect. 5."

            "text": "As a simple extension of the SM, the 2HDM is invariant under the SM gauge group and includes, besides the SM matter and gauge fields, two complex scalar SU (2)L doublets, \u03c6a = ei\u03b8a [\n\u03c6+a 1\u221a 2 (va + \u03c1a + i\u03b7a) ] , (2.1)\nwith the weak hypercharge Y = 1/2. Here we have assumed that the vacuum of the theory respects the electromagnetic gauge symmetry, which guarantees the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the two scalar fields \u03c6a to be aligned in the\nSU (2)L space. After performing further a global SU (2)L transformation to put the non-zero vevs only in the lower (neutral) components of \u03c6a , which guarantees the vacuum to be neutral and not charge-breaking, we can bring the vevs of the two scalar fields to the forms given by \u30080|\u03c6Ta (x)|0\u3009 = (0, vaei\u03b8a/ \u221a 2), where v1 and v2 are real and non-negative [115,116]. However, as one global phase can always be rotated away through an appropriate U (1)Y transformation, we can, without loss of generality, fix \u03b81 = 0 and leave the relative phase \u03b8 = \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 [51,115,116].\nPerforming further a global SU (2) transformation in the scalar space (\u03c61, \u03c62), we can rotate the original scalar basis to the so-called Higgs basis [116\u2013119], ( 1\n\u2212 2 ) \u2261 ( cos \u03b2 sin \u03b2 sin \u03b2 \u2212 cos \u03b2 ) ( \u03c61 e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c62 ) , (2.2)\nwhere the rotation angle \u03b2 is defined by the ratio of the absolute values of the two neutral scalar field vevs, tan \u03b2 \u2261\u2223\u2223\u23290|\u03c602 \u2223\u22230\u3009\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u23290|\u03c601 \u2223\u22230\u3009\u2223\u2223 = v2 v1 , and, by convention, its value is limited to the first quadrant due to v1, v2 \u2265 0. In fact, both tan \u03b2 and the relative phase \u03b8 are basis-dependent, and we can remove them entirely by transforming from a generic basis (\u03c61, \u03c62) to the Higgs basis ( 1, 2) [116\u2013119]. The true significance of tan \u03b2 emerges only in specialized versions of the 2HDM, such as the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, where tan \u03b2 is promoted to a physical parameter. In this case, we can remove the relative phase \u03b8 by making a phase rotation \u03c62 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c62, such that the two neutral scalar vevs are real and the CP invariance is not spontaneously broken [116\u2013119]. In the Higgs basis, only the scalar doublet 1 gets a non-zero vev, \u30080| T1 (x) |0\u3009 = (0, v/ \u221a 2), with\nv = \u221a v21 + v22 = 1/ \u221a\u221a\n2GF 246.22 GeV, and plays the role of the SM Higgs doublet. The two scalar doublets in the Higgs basis can now be parametrized, respectively, as [51]\n1 = [\nG+ 1\u221a 2 (v + S1 + iG0) ] ,\n2 = [\nH+ 1\u221a 2 (S2 + i S3) ] , (2.3)\nwhere G\u00b1 and G0 denote the electroweak Goldstone fields, and the remaining five physical degrees of freedom are given by the two charged fields H\u00b1(x) and the three neutral ones \u03d50i (x) = {h(x), H(x), A(x)} = Ri j S j , where R is the orthogonal matrix needed for diagonalizing the mass terms in the scalar potential [92]. Generally, none of these three neutral scalars can have a definite CP quantum number. Here, for simplicity, we shall assume a CP-conserving Higgs sector, as will be detailed in the next two subsections.\n2.1 Scalar sector\nIn the Higgs basis, the most general scalar potential allowed by the electroweak gauge symmetry SU (2)L \u2297U (1)Y takes the form [116\u2013118]: V = \u03bc1 ( \u2020 1 1 ) + \u03bc2 ( \u2020 2 2 ) + [ \u03bc3 ( \u2020 1 2\n) +\u03bc\u22173 ( \u2020 2 1\n)] + \u03bb1 ( \u2020 1 1\n)2 + \u03bb2 ( \u20202 2)2 + \u03bb3 ( \u2020 1 1 ) ( \u2020 2 2 ) + \u03bb4 ( \u2020 1 2 ) ( \u2020 2 1\n) + [(\n\u03bb5 \u2020 1 2 + \u03bb6 \u20201 1 + \u03bb7 \u20202 2 ) \u00d7 (\n\u2020 1 2\n) + h.c. ] . (2.4)\nDue to Hermiticity of the scalar potential, the parameters \u03bc1,2 and \u03bb1,2,3,4 are real, while \u03bc3 and \u03bb5,6,7 could be generally complex. The minimization condition of the scalar potential imposes the relations\n\u03bc1 = \u2212\u03bb1 v2, \u03bc3 = \u22121 2 \u03bb6 v 2. (2.5)\nInserting Eq. (2.3) into Eq. (2.4) and imposing the minimization condition given by Eq. (2.5), we can get the chargedHiggs mass\nm2H\u00b1 = \u03bc2 + 1\n2 \u03bb3 v\n2, (2.6)\nwhile the masses of the three neutral scalars can be obtained after diagonalizing the mass-squared matrix M of the three neutral-scalar fields S1,2,3 by the orthogonal matrix R, i.e., diag ( m2h,m 2 H ,m 2 A\n) = RMRT [92]. In the CP-conserving limit of the scalar potential, the parameters \u03bb5,6,7 are all real and the three neutral scalars h, H , and A are therefore CP eigenstates. In this case, the CP-odd scalar A corresponds to the field S3, while the two CP-even scalars h and H are the orthogonal combinations of S1 and S2:(\nh H\n) = (\ncos \u03b1\u0303 sin \u03b1\u0303 \u2212 sin \u03b1\u0303 cos \u03b1\u0303 ) ( S1 S2 ) , (2.7)\nwhere the mixing angle \u03b1\u0303 is determined by\ntan \u03b1\u0303 = m 2 h \u2212 2\u03bb1v2\nv2\u03bb6 = v\n2\u03bb6\n2\u03bb1v2 \u2212 m2H . (2.8)\nNote that one can always restrict \u03b1\u0303 within the range 0 \u03b1\u0303 < \u03c0 by performing a phase redefinition of the two CPeven fields S1 and S2. In addition, the masses of h and H satisfy the relation m2H sin\n2 \u03b1\u0303 + m2h cos2 \u03b1\u0303 = 2\u03bb1v2 [93], which, together with our convention mh \u2264 mH , implies that\n2\u03bb1v2 \u2212m2H \u2264 0 and m2h \u22122\u03bb1v2 \u2264 0. Then, from Eq. (2.8), one can see that the sign of tan \u03b1\u0303 is uniquely determined by\nthat of the parameter \u03bb6, since the vev v = \u221a\nv21 + v22 is, by definition, always positive. As the Higgs basis of a CPconserving 2HDM is defined up to a global rephasing of the second scalar doublet 2 \u2192 ei\u03b7 2, we can use this freedom to change the sign of \u03bb6 [120]. Here, without loss of generality, we shall use the rephasing 2 \u2192 \u2212 2 to fix \u03bb6 0 so that tan \u03b1\u0303 \u2265 0, which, together with 0 \u03b1\u0303 < \u03c0 , results in our final choice 0 \u03b1\u0303 \u03c0/2. The masses of the three neutral scalars are finally given, respectively, by\nm2h = 1\n2 ( \u2212 ), m2H =\n1 2 ( + ),\nm2A = m2H\u00b1 + v2 ( \u03bb4\n2 \u2212 \u03bb5\n) , (2.9)\nwith = m2H\u00b1 + v2 ( 2\u03bb2 + \u03bb4 2 \u2212 \u03bb5 ) , (2.10)\n= \u221a[ m2A + 2v2 (\u03bb5 \u2212 \u03bb1) ]2 + 4v4 \u03bb26. (2.11)\nHere the convention mh mH has been chosen, and the SM limit is recovered when \u03b1\u0303 = 0.\n2.2 Yukawa sector\nThe Yukawa Lagrangian of a 2HDM in the Higgs basis can be written as [49,51]\nLY,weak = \u2212 \u221a 2\nv\n[ Q\u0304\u2032L(M \u2032d 1 + Y \u2032d 2)d \u2032R\n+ Q\u0304\u2032L(M \u2032u\u03031 + Y \u2032u\u03032)u\u2032R + L\u0304 \u2032L(M \u2032 1 + Y \u2032 2) \u2032R ] + h.c. (2.12)\nHere, Q\u2032L and L \u2032L are the left-handed quark and lepton doublets, while u\u2032R , d \u2032R , \u2032R denote the right-handed fermion singlets, all being given in the weak-interaction basis; \u0303a(x) \u2261 i\u03c32 \u2217a(x), with \u03c32 the Pauli matrix, are the charge-conjugated fields with hypercharge Y = \u22121/2; M \u2032f ( f = u, d, ) denote the non-diagonal matrices that encode both the fermion masses and the Yukawa couplings of the scalar doublet 1 to fermions, while Y \u2032f characterize only the Yukawa couplings of the second doublet 2 to fermions.\nIn general, the two matrices M \u2032f andY \u2032f associated with the same type of right-handed fermion u\u2032R , d \u2032R , or \u2032R in Eq. (2.12) cannot be simultaneously diagonalized in flavour space. As a consequence, in the fermion mass-eigenstate basis with diagonal mass matrices M f = U f \u2020L M \u2032f U fR , the corresponding Yukawa matrices Y f = U f \u2020L Y \u2032f U fR remain still non-diagonal\nand hence give rise to non-vanishing tree-level FCNC interactions. These unwanted tree-level FCNC couplings can, however, be eliminated by requiring that the two matrices M \u2032f and Y \u2032f are aligned in flavour space [51]. This results in the following alignment relations between the mass and the Yukawa matrices [51]:\nYd, = \u03c2d, Md, , Yu = \u03c2\u2217u Mu, (2.13) where \u03c2 f are arbitrary complex parameters and could introduce new sources of CP violation beyond that of the CKM quark-mixing matrix. They are also scalar-basis independent and satisfy universality among the three different generations [51].\nIn terms of the fermion mass eigenstates, fL ,R = U f \u2020L ,R f \u2032 L ,R , and making use of the alignment conditions specified by Eq. (2.13), we can finally rewrite the Yukawa Lagrangian of the A2HDM as [51]\nLY,mass = \u2212i G 0\nv\n{ d\u0304L MddR + u\u0304 RM\u2020uuL + \u0304LM R } \u2212 (\n1 + S1 v\n){ u\u0304L MuuR + d\u0304L MddR + \u0304LM R }\n\u2212 1 v\n(S2 + i S3) { d\u0304LYddR + u\u0304 RY \u2020u uL + \u0304LY R }\n\u2212 \u221a 2 v G+ { u\u0304LVCKMMddR \u2212 u\u0304 RM\u2020u VCKMdL + \u03bd\u0304LM R }\n\u2212 \u221a 2 v H+ { \u03c2d u\u0304LVCKMMddR \u2212 \u03c2u u\u0304RM\u2020u VCKMdL\n+ \u03c2 \u03bd\u0304LM R } + h.c., (2.14)\nwhereVCKM = Uu\u2020L UdL is the usual CKM matrix [52,53], and the diagonal fermion mass matrices are now given, respectively, by\nMu = diag (mu,mc,mt ) , Md = diag (md ,ms,mb) , M = diag ( me,m\u03bc,m\u03c4 ) . (2.15)\nFor the rare FCNC decays t \u2192 cg(g) considered here, besides the SM part, only the interactions of the charged scalars H\u00b1 with the quarks are involved, which means that only the alignment parameters \u03c2u,d and the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 will be involved throughout this work.\nAs shown in Table 1, the four conventional 2HDMs [48,49] based on discreteZ2 symmetries can be easily recovered from the A2HDM by choosing particular values of the alignment parameters \u03c2 f . As the parameter \u03c2 is not involved in the rare decays t \u2192 cg(g), we are actually left with only two cases, type-I (type-X) 2HDM with \u03c2d = \u03c2u = cot \u03b2, and type-II (type-Y) 2HDM with \u03c2d = \u22121/\u03c2u = \u2212 tan \u03b2. Numerical results of the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg(g) decays in these two specific cases as well as their comparisons with the SM predictions and the results obtained in the A2HDM will also be discussed in Sect. 4.\n3 Calculation of the decay rates\n3.1 General remarks\nThe rare top-quark decays t \u2192 qg(g), with q = u, c, occur firstly at one-loop level within the SM. As such, the decay rates of these processes are not only suppressed by the loop factor, but also receive a strong CKM and GIM suppression relative to the dominant tree-level decay t \u2192 bW+ [2,27, 39]. Due to the additional charged-Higgs contributions at the loop level, however, these decay rates could be enhanced in the A2HDM as well as in the conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries [2,3,7]. Here we shall focus on the decays into a charm instead of an up quark, because the decay rates of t \u2192 ug(g) are further suppressed by the ratio |Vub/Vcb|2 0.0087 compared to that of t \u2192 cg(g), both within the SM as well as in the 2HDMs considered.\nWithin the SM, due to the hierarchy of the CKM matrix elements, |Vtb| |Vtd |, |Vts |, the total width of the top quark is dominated by the tree-level two-body decay t \u2192 bW+, and we can, therefore, take the approximation tot(t) (t \u2192 bW+). Keeping only the dominant next-to-leadingorder (NLO) QCD correction [121\u2013123] while neglecting the W -boson width effect [121], the NLO electroweak [124,125], as well as the next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD correction [126\u2013130], all being only of a few percentages of the Born term [127], we can write the partial decay width of the channel t \u2192 bW+ as [123,125]\n(t \u2192 bW+) = 0(t \u2192 bW+) {\n1 + CF\u03b1s 2\u03c0\n\u00d7 [ 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b22W )(2\u03b22W \u2212 1)(\u03b22W \u2212 2)\n\u03b24W (3 \u2212 2\u03b22W ) ln(1 \u2212 \u03b22W )\n\u22129 \u2212 4\u03b2 2 W\n3 \u2212 2\u03b22W ln \u03b22W + 2Li2(\u03b22W ) \u2212 2Li2(1 \u2212 \u03b22W )\n\u22126\u03b2 4 W \u2212 3\u03b22W \u2212 8\n2\u03b22W (3 \u2212 2\u03b22W ) \u2212 \u03c02\n]} , (3.1)\nwhere CF = 4/3 is the colour factor, and \u03b1s = g2s /(4\u03c0) denotes the strong coupling constant. The parameter \u03b2W =\u221a\n1 \u2212 m2W /m2t , with mW and mt the W -boson and the topquark mass respectively, is the velocity of W+ in the topquark rest frame, and the dilogarithm function is defined by Li2(x) = \u2212 \u222b x 0 ln(1\u2212 t)/t dt . The leading-order (LO) decay width 0(t \u2192 bW+) in Eq. (3.1) is given by [124]\n0(t \u2192 bW+) = GF |Vtb| 2\u221a\u03bb(mt ,mb,mW ) 8\u03c0 \u221a 2m3t\n\u00d7 [ (m2t \u2212 m2b)2 + (m2t + m2b)m2W \u2212 2m4W ] , (3.2)\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant, mb the bottom-quark mass, and \u03bb(x, y, z) = (x2 \u2212 y2 \u2212 z2)2 \u2212 4y2z2 the usual triangle (or K\u00e4ll\u00e9n) function for a two-body decay.\nTo a very good approximation, tot(t) (t \u2192 bW+) holds also in the A2HDM as well as in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, except when mH\u00b1 < mt \u2212mb; in this regime, the top quark can have an appreciable chance to decay into the final state bH+, which must be taken into account for the total top width. In this case, we shall have tot(t) (t \u2192 bW+) + (t \u2192 bH+), with the LO partial width of the decay t \u2192 bH+ in the A2HDM given by [12]\n(t \u2192 bH+) = GF |Vtb| 2\u221a\u03bb(mt ,mb,mH\u00b1) 8\u03c0 \u221a 2m3t\n\u00d7 [ ( m2t + m2b \u2212 m2H\u00b1 ) ( m2b|\u03c2d |2 + m2t |\u03c2u |2 )\n\u22124m2bm2t Re(\u03c2d\u03c2\u2217u ) ] . (3.3)\nAs we are primarily interested in checking if the \u201chigherorder dominance\u201d phenomenon observed in t \u2192 cg(g) decays within the SM [39] is still valid for the A2HDM and the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 will be assumed to be larger than the top-quark mass mt , and the decay mode t \u2192 bH+ is therefore kinematically forbidden. Thus, the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg(g) decays can be defined as\nB(t \u2192 cg(g)) = (t \u2192 cg(g)) (t \u2192 bW+) . (3.4)\nIn the next two subsections, we shall detail the calculation of the decay rates (t \u2192 cg(g)) in the A2HDM. To this end, we shall follow the following procedure: Firstly, we implement the A2HDM into the Mathematica-based package FeynRules [131,132] to generate the model file together with a complete set of Feynman rules, which is then fed\ninto the package FeynArts [133,134] to generate the oneloop Feynman diagrams and the corresponding amplitudes for the t \u2192 cg(g) decays. Then, we resort to the packages FormCalc [135,136] and LoopTools [135] to manipulate the decay amplitudes and evaluate numerically the scalar and tensor one-loop Feynman integrals. Meanwhile, some partial cross-checks have been done by using the package FeynCalc [137\u2013139]. Finally, we can obtain the decay rates from the amplitudes squared by performing the phase space integration. Throughout this work, we carry out the one-loop calculation in D = 4 \u2212 2 space-time dimensions using the dimensional regularization scheme [140\u2013143] for the ultraviolet divergence in loop integrals, and make the GIM mechanism manifest by dropping the terms independent of the internal down-type quark masses. For the collinear and infrared singularities present in the t \u2192 cgg decay, we take a non-zero charm-quark mass to avoid the collinear divergence generated when one of the gluons in the final state travels parallelly to the charm quark, and introduce phase-space cuts to eliminate the collinear (generated when the two gluons travel parallelly to each other) and infrared (generated when one of the gluons is soft) divergences [39,42].1\nAs the two gluons are both on-shell and hence transversely polarized, care must be taken regarding the gluon polarization sums when squaring the amplitude of t \u2192 cgg decay. One can maintain their transversality either by introducing contributions from the ghost fields while using the simple polarization sums [21,39]2\n\u2211 polarizations \u2217\u03bc(k3) \u03bd(k3)\n= \u2211\npolarizations\n\u2217\u03bc(k4) \u03bd(k4) = \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd, (3.5)\nor via the explicit construction [40,42]\n\u2211 polarizations \u2217\u03bc(k3) \u03bd(k3)\n= \u2211\npolarizations\n\u2217\u03bc(k4) \u03bd(k4)\n= \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd + k3\u03bck4\u03bd + k4\u03bck3\u03bd k3 \u00b7 k4 , (3.6)\n1 A more precise approach to obtain a finite result requires both performing a complete NLO QCD calculation of the virtually corrected decay width (t \u2192 cg) and achieving a dimensionally regularized version of the decay width (t \u2192 cgg) in which both infrared and collinear singularities become manifest [45]. The finiteness of the decay rate is then guaranteed by the Kinoshita\u2013Lee\u2013Nauenberg theorem [144,145]. 2 Throughout this work, the colour indices in the gluon polarization vectors will be suppressed.\nwhich are now simultaneously transverse with respect to the two gluon momenta k3 and k4. Here, \u03bc(k3) and \u03bc(k4) denote the polarization vectors of the final-state gluons with momenta k3 and k4 respectively, while g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor in Minkowski space, with the Greek indices running over 0, 1, 2, 3. In this paper, we shall follow the second method. In practice, however, one needs only keep one of the two gluon polarization sums as in Eq. (3.6) while replacing the other one by \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd [40]. Conveniently, the package FormCalc provides already a function PolarizationSum to achieve such a task.\nIn our calculation, we shall use the \u2019t Hooft\u2013Feynman gauge and take the external top and charm quarks to be onshell. However, the gauge independence of our final results has been checked by performing additionally all the calculations in the unitary gauge. Due to the smallness of the down- and strange-quark masses md,s and the unitarity of the CKM matrix \u2211 q=d,s,b V \u2217tqVcq = 0, the decay rates turn out to be only sensitive to the bottom-quark massmb [27,35]. For these internal quark masses, the most adequate choice is the MS running mass evaluated at a typical scale of O(mt ) [27,35], and such a prescription will be followed by us. The external top- and charm-quark masses are, on the other hand, taken as the on-shell pole masses. For the sake of simplicity for our presentation, however, we shall set the charmquark mass mc to zero and keep only the contributions from the internal bottom quark to these decays, while taking into account all these effects in our numerical analyses presented in Sect. 4.\n3.2 Two-body decay t \u2192 cg\nLet us firstly calculate the decay rate of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg in the A2HDM. The one-loop Feynman diagrams responsible for this decay in the \u2019t Hooft\u2013Feynman gauge are shown in Fig. 1, where the first three ones correspond to the vertex diagrams while the remaining ones to the flavourchanging (t \u2212 c) fermion self-energy diagrams. During the calculation of these Feynman diagrams, we have kept all the external and internal quark masses non-vanishing [2,12]. Especially for the flavour-changing fermion self-energy diagrams, we have followed the treatment proposed in Ref. [146]: it is most straightforward to avoid the issue of counterterms [41,42] altogether by simply calculating these diagrams, because the internal top (charm) quark line is offshell and hence does not contribute to the one-particle pole of the charm (top) quark and needs not be truncated. Furthermore, due to the fact that the flavour-changing fermion self-energies are part of the non-truncated Green\u2019s function, one must include their contributions with a factor of 1 rather than a factor of 1/2, as the latter applies only in the standard flavour-conserving case.\nThe resulting transition amplitude for the two-body decay t \u2192 cg can be written as3\nAt\u2192cg = GF 4 \u221a 2 \u03c02 gsT a i j \u2211 q=d,s,b V \u2217tqVcq\n\u00d7 [ R(q)1 (\n\u2217(k3) \u00b7 k1) c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR t j (k1,mt ) +R(q)2 c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k3) t j (k1,mt ) ] , (3.7)\nwhere gs = \u221a4\u03c0\u03b1s is the strong coupling constant, T ai j the generators of the SU (3) gauge group with the indexes a = 1, . . . , 8 and i, j = 1, 2, 3, and PR,L = (1 \u00b1 \u03b35)/2 the chirality projectors. Here, a\u03bc(k3) is the polarization vector of the gluon, while k1, k2, and k3 = k1 \u2212 k2 are the momenta of the top, the charm, and the gluon, respectively. The two form factors R(q)1,2 in Eq. (3.7) are the sums of the contribution from each of the nine diagrams shown in Fig. 1. They can be expressed in terms of the masses of the external and internal quarks and bosons, and contain the D-dimensional loop integrals resulting from dimensional regularization. Specific to the internal bottom-quark contribution, we have explicitly R(b)1 = 2mt { 2m2WC12(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 W )\n\u2212 (m2b \u2212 2m2W )C2(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W ) \u2212 m2b [ C0(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 W ) \u2212 C12(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W ) + Xdu ( C0(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 H\u00b1)\n+C2(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1) )\n\u2212 Xdd C12(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1) ]} , (3.8)\n3 When the charm-quark mass is kept, there are two more form factors in Eq. (3.7), with the associated Dirac strings obtained by replacing PR with PL . Applying the on-shell conditions and the Gordon identities, we can also recast Eq. (3.7) into the standard dipole structure form [3], as will be discussed in Sect. 4.\nand R(b)2 = m2W { 2m2t [ C1(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 W )\n\u2212 m2b C0(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W ) \u2212 C2(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W ) ]+ 2B1(m2t ,m2b,m2W ) \u2212 4C00(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W )\n} + m2b Xdd [ (m2H\u00b1 \u2212 m2b)C0(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1)\n\u2212 2C00(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1) + B1(m2t ,m2b,m2H\u00b1) ] \u2212 ( m4b \u2212 m2t m2b \u2212 2m4W ) C0(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 W )\n+ m2b { m2t [ C1(0,m 2 t , 0,m 2 b,m 2 b,m 2 W )\n+ Xdd C1(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1) + Xdu C0(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2H\u00b1) ] \u2212 Xdu [ B0(0,m 2 b,m 2 H\u00b1) + B0(m2t ,m2b,m2H\u00b1)\n] \u2212 B0(0,m2b,m2W ) + B0(m2t ,m2b,m2W ) + B1(m2t ,m2b,m2W ) \u2212 2C00(0,m2t , 0,m2b,m2b,m2W )\n} + [ (Xdd + 1)m2b + 2m2W ] B0(0,m 2 b,m 2 b). (3.9)\nHere, following the standard procedure and notation of Refs. [147\u2013150], we have reduced the vector and tensor integrals via the Passarino\u2013Veltman method [150] to the scalar oneloop integrals Bl andCl,lm , which can be further decomposed into the basic scalar functions A0, B0, and C0. However, as the package FormCalc does not require such a further reduction, we have expressed our results in terms of Bl and Cl,lm instead of the more basic ones to save CPU time. This is especially preferable for the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg, in which the more complicated four-point one-loop integrals Dl,lm,lmn will be involved. In addition, we have introduced\nthe symbols Xqq \u2032 = \u03c2q\u03c2\u2217q \u2032 , with q, q \u2032 = d, u, to represent the possible combinations of the alignment parameters in the A2HDM, and the SM result [2,27] is reproduced by setting Xqq \u2032 = 0. It should be noted that, although the individual contribution from each internal quark di \u2208 {d, s, b} is separately divergent, the total amplitude is of course ultraviolet finite after summing over all the three internal quark flavours and taking into account the unitarity of the CKM matrix,\u2211\nq=d,s,b V \u2217tqVcq = 0. With the transition amplitude at hand, it is straightforward to calculate the decay rate (t \u2192 cg), with the result given in the top-quark rest frame and in the limit mc = 0 by\n(t \u2192 cg) = \u221a \u03bb(mt ,mc, 0)\n16\u03c0m3t\n\u00d7 \u2211\npolarizations\n1\n3 \u2211 colours 1 2 \u2211 spins \u2223\u2223At\u2192cg\u2223\u22232 . (3.10) For our later numerical analyses, however, we always take into account the finite charm-quark mass effect.\n3.3 Three-body decay t \u2192 cgg\nIn the A2HDM, the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg receives contributions from the one-loop Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 2, where di = {d, s, b} and the \u2019t Hooft\u2013Feynman gauge is adopted. The transition amplitude of the decay can be written as\nAt\u2192cgg = \u2211\nq=d,s,b\n[ Avertex(q) + Abox(q) + Aself(q) ] , (3.11)\nwhere Avertex(q) , Abox(q) , and Aself(q) represent the contributions from the vertex, the box, and the self-energy diagrams, respectively. Specific again to the internal bottom-quark contribution and in the limit mc = 0, these separate terms can be written in a compact form as\nAvertex(b) = GF \u03b1sV \u2217tbVcb\u221a\n2 \u03c0 t12 s23 t R1R2\n[ Td t12 t R2 ( R1R vertex 1\n+ s23Rvertex2 )+ Te t12 s23 R1(R2Rvertex3 + t Rvertex4 )\n+ (Td \u2212 Te)s23 t R1R2Rvertex5 ], (3.12) Abox(b) =\nGF \u03b1sV \u2217tbVcb\u221a 2 \u03c0 t12 s23 t R1R2\n[ mt ( F1R box 1 + F12Rbox5\n+ 2F13Rbox6 + 2F14Rbox7 )\n\u2212 (F3Rbox2 + F4Rbox3 + F5Rbox4 \u2212 F16Rbox8 ) ], (3.13)\nAself(b) = GF \u03b1sV \u2217tbVcb\u221a\n2 \u03c0 t12 s23 t R1R2\n[ Td t12 t R2 ( R1R self 1\n+ s23 m2bRself2 + Rself6 )\n+ Te t12 s23 R1 ( R2R self 3 + t m2bRself4 + Rself7 ) + (Td \u2212 Te)s23 t R1R2Rself5 ]. (3.14)\nHere the kinematics of the process is specified in the parentheses of the initial- and final-state particles as t (k1) \u2192 c(k2) + g(k3) + g(k4). For convenience, we have also introduced in Eqs. (3.12)\u2013(3.14) two products of the colour generators, Td = (T aT b)i j and Te = (T bT a)i j , as well as the (generalized) Mandelstam variables t = (k1 \u2212 k3)2, t12 = (k1 \u2212k2)2, and s23 = (k2 +k3)2.4 In addition, the independent fermion chains involved are defined, respectively, by\nF1 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR t j (k1,mt ), F2 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL t j (k1,mt ), F3 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k3) t j (k1,mt ), F4 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k4) t j (k1,mt ), F5 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F6 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k3) t j (k1,mt ), F7 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k4) t j (k1,mt ), F8 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F9 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k3) /\u2217(k4) t j (k1,mt ), F10 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k3) k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F11 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k4) k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F12 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k3) /\u2217(k4) t j (k1,mt ), F13 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k3) k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F14 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k4) k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F15 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PL /\u2217(k3) /\u2217(k4) k/3 t j (k1,mt ), F16 = c\u0304i (k2, 0) PR /\u2217(k3) /\u2217(k4) k/3 t j (k1,mt ). (3.15)\nFor the R functions present in Eqs. (3.12)\u2013(3.14), we have R1 = s23 \u2212 m2t and R2 = t \u2212 m2t , while the explicit expressions of all the remaining ones are collected in Appendix A.\nIn the top-quark rest frame, the differential decay rate of t \u2192 cgg can be written as\nd (t \u2192 cgg) = 1 2mt\n( 4\u220f\ni=2\n\u222b d3ki (2\u03c0)3 1\n2Ei\n) (2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)\n\u00d7(k1 \u2212 k2 \u2212 k3 \u2212 k4) \u00d7\n\u2211 polarizations 1 3 \u2211 colours 1 2 \u2211 spins 1 2 \u2223\u2223At\u2192cgg\u2223\u22232 , (3.16)\n4 It should be noted that we can also organize Eqs. (3.12)\u2013(3.14) according to whether the two on-shell final-state gluons are in a coloursymmetric ({T a, T b}) or in a colour-antisymmetric ([T a, T b]) configuration [42,45]. Although taking the same symbol, the Mandelstam variable t can be clearly distinguished from the top-quark spinor through the context.\nwhere Ei = k0i represents the energy of the (i-1)-th final-state particle in the top-quark rest frame, and the last factor 1/2 accounts for the statistical factor due to the two gluons in the final state. In this frame, we have k2 + k3 + k4 = 0, and thus the three final-state momentum vectors lie in a plane. Then, the three-body phase space in Eq. (3.16) can be integrated over the orientation of this plane by using the momentum delta functions and the azimuthal symmetry. In this way, we are left with only two non-trivial integration variables, which can be chosen as the energy of the charm quark (k02) and the energy of one of the gluons (say k03), and the decay width of t \u2192 cgg can be finally written as\n(t \u2192 cgg) = 1 64 \u03c03 mt \u2211 polarizations\n\u00d7 1 3 \u2211 colours 1 2 \u2211 spins \u222b dk03 \u222b dk02 \u00d7 1 2 \u2223\u2223At\u2192cgg\u2223\u22232 . (3.17) Because of the infrared and collinear divergences men-\ntioned in Sect. 3.1, which are also evident from Eqs. (3.12)\u2013 (3.14) and appear at the vertices and along the boundary lines of the Dalitz plot in the (k02, k 0 3) space respectively, we have to impose proper cuts on both k02 and k 0 3 when performing the integration of Eq. (3.17) over these two variables. Following the treatment of Refs. [39,42], we shall use the kinematic constraints\nt = (k1 \u2212 k3)2 = m2t \u2212 2mtk03 C \u00b7 2m2t , t12 = (k1 \u2212 k2)2 = m2t \u2212 2mtk02 C \u00b7 2m2t , s23 = (k2 + k3)2 = (k1 \u2212 k4)2 = \u2212m2t + 2mt (k02 + k03) C \u00b7 2m2t , (3.18)\nalong with the fact that k02,max k02,min, to get the integration ranges of the two variables:5\nk02 \u2208 [mt\n2 \u2212 k03 + Cmt , mt 2\n(1 \u2212 2C) ] ,\nk03 \u2208 [ 2Cmt ,\nmt 2\n(1 \u2212 2C) ] , (3.19)\nwhere C is the cutoff parameter, and its value must be taken within the range of jet energy resolution of a detector. Note that, when a non-zero charm-quark mass is considered, Eq. (3.19) must be modified as\nk02 \u2208 [ mt 2 \u2212 k03 + Cmt + m2c 2mt , mt 2 (1 \u2212 2C) + m 2 c 2mt ] ,\nk03 \u2208 [\n2Cmt , mt 2 (1 \u2212 2C) \u2212 m 2 c\n2mt\n] . (3.20)\n5 To ensure that the divergent point at k02 + k03 = mt/2 resulting from s23 = 0 in Eqs. (3.12)\u2013(3.14) is also excluded, our choice is slightly different from that of Ref. [39]. Recall that mc = 0 is assumed here.\nHere, for simplicity, we shall take C 0.01 as the default value (i.e., requiring the energy of each decay product to be larger than 2.0 GeV in the top-quark rest frame), while varying C within the range [0.001, 0.05] to study its numerical impacts on the branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg decay. Note that the choice C = 0.01 is already large enough to reach the jet energy resolution sensitivity of the HL-LHC [108] and FCC [109\u2013112] facilities.\n4 Numerical results and discussions\n4.1 Input parameters\nThe relevant input parameters needed for evaluating the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg(g) decays are listed in Table 2. For the QCD and electroweak parameters as well as the quark masses, their values are taken from the Particle Data Group [151]. Here, for the external on-shell quarks, we take their pole masses as input, and evolve the internal quark masses from their respective initial scales to the scale \u03bct = mpolet characteristic for the top-quark decay, using the two-loop renormalization group equations for the MS running quark masses.6 The MS coupling constant \u03b1s is given at the Z -boson mass scale with the top quark decoupled (i.e., with n f = 5 active quark flavours). To obtain its values at the scale \u03bct and also at other scales when evolving the MS running quark masses, we use the two-loop running of \u03b1s by taking into account the decoupling effect when crossing a flavour threshold [154,155]. For convenience, we compile also in Table 2 the derived values of the MS running parameters evaluated at the scale \u03bct = mpolet following the above prescription.\nConcerning the needed entries of the CKM matrix, we adopt the Wolfenstein parametrization [152], generalized to include the higher-order terms of \u03bb = |Vus | [153]. To be consistent with the study of NP, the four Wolfenstein parameters \u03bb, A, \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03bb2/2), and \u03b7\u0304 = \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03bb2/2) should be fitted to the tree-level observables as well as the ratio of the mass differences between the neutral B-meson eigenstates, Md/ Ms , which are all expected to have only a minimal sensitivity to the charged-Higgs contributions [60]. To this end, we shall use as input the central values of the fitting results obtained in Ref. [75]. For any further details, the readers are referred to Ref. [75].\nAs pointed out already in Sect. 2, only the parameters \u03c2u , \u03c2d , and mH\u00b1 are involved for the rare decays t \u2192 cg(g) in the A2HDM. Let us now fix the allowed ranges of these\n6 Note that the down- and strange-quark running masses m\u0304d,s are quoted in the MS scheme at a scale \u03bc = 2 GeV, while the bottomquark running mass m\u0304b is evaluated at a scale equal to its mass, i.e., m\u0304b(m\u0304b).\nmodel parameters. For simplicity, we shall entertain ourselves with the CP-conserving limit and assume that the observed 125 GeV Higgs is the lightest CP-even scalar of the model, which corresponds exactly to the light scenario considered in Ref. [75]. For the two alignment parameters \u03c2u,d , we choose the ranges\n|\u03c2u | \u2208 [0, 1.5], |\u03c2d | \u2208 [0, 50], (4.1) as constrained mostly by the precision flavour physics, such as Z \u2192 bb\u0304, B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 , as well as B0s,d \u2212 B\u03040s,d and K 0 \u2212 K\u0304 0 mixings [60\u201364]. It is especially interesting to note that, for large values of |\u03c2u\u03c2d |, important correlated constraints on \u03c2u and \u03c2d can be derived from the weak radiative decay B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 , with the region \u03c2d\u03c2u < 0 almost excluded by the current data on the branching ratio of B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 [60]. The ranges in Eq. (4.1) are also roughly consistent with the perturbativity requirement, |\u221a2\u03c2u,dmu,d/v| 1. For the chargedHiggs mass, we focus only on the case with mH\u00b1 varied within the ranges mH\u00b1 \u2208 [200, 600] GeV for the t \u2192 cg and mH\u00b1 \u2208 [200, 400] GeV for the t \u2192 cgg decay. Here the lower limit is chosen to be larger than the top-quark mass such that the decay mode t \u2192 bH+ is kinematically forbidden, while the upper limit is motivated by the observation that the maximum branching ratio of t \u2192 cg(g) for mH\u00b1 600 (400) GeV approaches already the corresponding SM prediction, as will be demonstrated in the next subsection.7 Recently, a detailed global fit has been performed to\n7 Direct constraints on the charged-Higgs mass can also be obtained from collider searches for the production and decay of on-shell charged-\nthe A2HDM by considering a CP-conserving scalar potential and real alignment parameters, and including the most constraining flavour observables, electroweak precision measurements, and the available data on Higgs signal strengths and collider searches for heavy scalars, together with the theoretical requirements of perturbativity and positivity of the scalar potential [75]. We shall use the relevant constraints on the alignment parameters \u03c2u,d resulting from such a global fit obtained at the 95.5% CL (cf. the brown region in the left plot of Fig. 9) in Ref. [75]; for further details, the readers are also referred to Ref. [75].\n4.2 B(t \u2192 cg(g)) in the A2HDM\nFirstly, with the input parameters collected in Table 2, we give for reference the partial width of the dominant tree-level t \u2192 bW+ decay,\n(t \u2192 bW+) = 1.35 (1.47) GeV, (4.2)\nat the NLO (LO) in QCD, which is found to be well consistent with the current data on the top-quark total width,\nexp tot (t) = 1.42+0.19\u22120.15 GeV [151]. This in turn implies that the extra contribution from the partial width (t \u2192 bH+) in the mH\u00b1 < mt \u2212mb case should be small, supporting therefore our choice of the lower limit of the charged-Higgs mass,\nFootnote 7 continued Higgs bosons [156\u2013160]; see, e.g., Refs.

Here, the SM results are obtained by taking the limits \u03c2u,d \u2192 0 and read\nBSM(t \u2192 cg) = 4.50 \u00d7 10\u221212, (4.5) BSM(t \u2192 cgg) = 8.31 \u00d7 10\u221210. (4.6)\nIt is found that our SM predictions are generally consistent with that made in Refs. [14,27] for the two-body decay t \u2192 cg, as well as in Ref. [39] for the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg. Especially, the branching ratio of the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg is predicted to be about two orders of magnitude larger than that of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg, which is\na clear demonstration of the \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d phenomenon observed already in Ref. [39]. It should be noted that the branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg depends on the cutoff parameter C , and the results given by Eqs. (4.4) and (4.6) are obtained with the default value C = 0.01. The cutoff dependence of this branching ratio within the SM is shown in Table 3 for six different values of C , together with the comparison with that obtained in Ref. [39]. It can be seen that, although being increased by about 7% compared to that obtained in Ref. [39] for the same choice of C ,8 our updated results depend only slightly on the cutoff parameter C , with the variation being only about two times whenC varies within the range [0.001, 0.05]. From Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4), one can also see that the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg(g)decays display a different dependence on the alignment parameters \u03c2u,d : Firstly, due to the much smaller coefficients, together with the allowed ranges of \u03c2u and \u03c2d specified by Eq. (4.1), the terms proportional to \u03c24u , \u03c2d\u03c2 3 u , and \u03c2 2 u can be safely neglected. Secondly, for moderate values of |\u03c2d | and large values of |\u03c2u |, the branching ratios will be dominated by the product \u03c2d\u03c2u and, to a less extent, also by \u03c22d\u03c2 2 u . Finally, the significance of \u03c2d occurs only when |\u03c2d | and |\u03c2u | take much larger and smaller values, respectively.\nPicking up randomly the values of the alignment parameters \u03c2u,d within the brown region (corresponding to the global fit obtained at the 95.5% CL) shown by the left plot of Figure 9 in Ref. [75], we show in Figs. 3 and 4 the branching ratios B(t \u2192 cg) and B(t \u2192 cgg) as a function of \u03c2u (left) and \u03c2d (right), for three benchmark values of the charged-Higgs mass, mH\u00b1 = 200, 300, and 500 (400) GeV, represented by the orange (top), brown (middle), and dark green (purple) (bottom) scatter plots, respectively. It can be seen that the maximum branching ratios of both t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are reached in the limits |\u03c2u | \u2192 0 and |\u03c2d | \u2192 48, which correspond to the minimum |\u03c2u | and maximum |\u03c2d | allowed by the combined constraints from the most constraining observables and the theoretical requirements [75]. Furthermore, almost irrespective of the values of the charged-Higgs mass, the maxima of the branching ratios are always reached with the same set of alignment parameters, (\u03c2u, \u03c2d) (\u22120.047,\u221248), whenmH\u00b1 varies within the ranges [200, 600] GeV for the t \u2192 cg and [200, 400] GeV for the t \u2192 cgg decay. Numerically, we obtain\nBA2HDMmax (t \u2192 cg) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129, formH\u00b1 = 200 GeV, 2.84 \u00d7 10\u221210, formH\u00b1 = 300 GeV, 1.82 \u00d7 10\u221211, formH\u00b1 = 500 GeV,\n(4.7)\n8 Note that the MS running masses of both the top and charm quarks as well as the \u03b1 scheme for the electroweak parameters were used in Ref. [39], while we take the pole masses for the external on-shell quarks as input and adopt the GF scheme for the electroweak parameters [125].\nment parameters \u03c2u,d from a global fit obtained at the 95.5% CL in Ref. [75]. The thickness of the shaded regions reflects the corresponding allowed range for \u03c2d(u) for a given value of \u03c2u(d), as can be read from the brown region of the left plot of Figure 9 in Ref. [75]\nIt can be seen that, with the 95.5%-CL constraints on the alignment parameters from the global fit taken into account\n[75], the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are both reached at mH\u00b1 = 200 GeV and given by 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22129 respectively, being therefore of the same order, in the A2HDM. This is obviously different from the SM case, where the predicted branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of t \u2192 cg (cf. Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6)) [39]. For conve-\nnience, we show in Fig. 5 the dependence of the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg (left) and t \u2192 cgg (right) on the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 , with the alignment parameters fixed at (\u03c2u, \u03c2d) (\u22120.047,\u221248).9 One can see that the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays decrease sharply as the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 increases, and approach the corresponding SM predictions for mH\u00b1 600 GeV and mH\u00b1 400 GeV, respectively.10 In addition,\n9 Here the plots are obtained by firstly calculating the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays with different values of mH\u00b1 and the same set of alignment parameters (\u03c2u , \u03c2d ) (\u22120.047,\u221248), and then constructing an interpolation of the maximum branching ratios as a function of mH\u00b1 . 10 Numerically, we find that the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the A2HDM are given by 6.63 \u00d7 10\u221212 for mH\u00b1 = 600 GeV and 8.60 \u00d7 10\u221210 for mH\u00b1 = 400 GeV respectively, which indeed approach the corresponding SM predictions given by Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6).\nthe maximum branching ratio BA2HDMmax (t \u2192 cg(g)) will change only slightly when mH\u00b1 600 (400) GeV. These observations motivate our choice of the upper limits for the charged-Higgs mass mentioned before. On the other hand, although being enhanced by about three orders of magnitude relative to the SM prediction, the maximum branching ratio of t \u2192 cg decay that can be reached in the A2HDM, BA2HDMmax (t \u2192 cg) = 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129, is still at least one order of magnitude lower than the projected 95%-CL limits at the future colliders, which are estimated to be 3.21 \u00d7 10\u22125 at the HL-LHC with 3-ab\u22121 luminosity data [107,108], and of O(10\u22127\u201310\u22128) at the 100-TeV FCC-hh with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab\u22121 [113,114], respectively. As a consequence, the predicted branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the A2HDM are still out of the expected sensitivities of the future HL-LHC and FCC-hh.\n4.3 B(t \u2192 cg(g)) in the conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries\nLet us now discuss the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, the Yukawa types of which have been given explicitly in Table 1. As only the charged-Higgs interactions with the quark sector are involved, we are actually left with only two different cases, type-I (type-X) 2HDM with \u03c2d = \u03c2u = 1/ tan \u03b2, and type-II (type-Y) 2HDM with \u03c2d = \u22121/\u03c2u = \u2212 tan \u03b2. Here, to predict the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays, we need only the knowledge of the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 and the parameter tan \u03b2, both of which receive severe constraints from many flavour processes and theoretical considerations [161\u2013164]. For convenience, we show in Fig. 6 the dependence of the two branching ratios B(t \u2192 cg) (left) and B(t \u2192 cgg) (right) on tan \u03b2, for three different choices of mH\u00b1 , in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries. It should be noted that the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are calculated in these four models by varying tan \u03b2 = [0.1, 60], while the ranges where the resulting branching ratios are not significantly enhanced compared with the corresponding SM predictions are not shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the sensitivity of the two branching ratios to mH\u00b1 occurs at low and high tan \u03b2 for the type-I (type-X) and the type-II (type-Y) 2HDM respectively, and such a sensitivity becomes, however, less significant for larger mH\u00b1 .\nFor the type-II 2HDM, the branching ratio of the weak radiative decay B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 plays a significant role in setting a lower bound on the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 , with the latest updated results given by mH\u00b1 800 GeV at 95% CL [165] and mH\u00b1 790 (1510) GeV at 2\u03c3 (1\u03c3) [166]. These bounds are nearly tan \u03b2-independent for tan \u03b2 > 2\nand show a strong dependence on tan \u03b2 only for tan \u03b2 < 2 [167]. Quite recently, a comprehensive study of the allowed parameter space of the type-II 2HDM has been performed by combining the most recent flavour, collider, and electroweak precision observables with theoretical constraints, with the best fit point lying around mH\u00b1 2 TeV and tan \u03b2 4 [166]. The experimental lower bound on mH\u00b1 from direct collider searches is, however, only mH\u00b1 160 GeV [157], and hence well below the indirect constraints from flavour physics. With these bounds taken into account, it is then found that the branching ratios of both t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays remain almost identical with the corresponding SM predictions, as given by Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) respectively. The same conclusion can also be applied to the type-Y 2HDM, because its Yukawa type shares the same coupling pattern for the quarks as of the type-II 2HDM [162]. In fact, for these two types of 2HDMs, we have \u03c2d = \u22121/\u03c2u = \u2212 tan \u03b2 and hence \u03c2d\u03c2u = \u22121, while the region \u03c2d\u03c2u < 0 is almost excluded by the current data on the branching ratio of the weak radiative decay B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 [60]. This also implies that significant enhancements of the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays relative to the SM predictions are impossible in these two types of 2HDMs.\nFor the type-I (type-X) 2HDM, on the other hand, a 95%-CL lower limit on mH\u00b1 from the branching ratio of B\u0304 \u2192 Xs\u03b3 can be derived for low tan \u03b2 only [167]. As an illustration, a bound tan \u03b2 2.5 can be set when the robust lower charged-Higgs mass limit mH\u00b1 80 GeV from the combined charged-Higgs searches at LEP [156] is considered. A detailed analysis of the phenomenological status of the charged-Higgs sector in the conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries has been performed by combing all the constraints from direct collider searches for charged and neutral Higgs bosons, as well as the most relevant constraints from\nwith the corresponding SM predictions. Note that the charged-Higgs mass mH\u00b1 in type-II (type-Y) 2HDM is already bounded to be larger than 600 GeV [165\u2013167], while the parameter tan \u03b2 in type-I (type-X) 2HDM is constrained to be larger than one [162], both of which imply that no significant enhancements of the branching ratios are possible in these conventional 2HDMs\nflavour physics [162]. Using the combined flavour constraints at 95% CL obtained there, we extract the values tan \u03b2 1.8 for mH\u00b1 = 200 GeV, tan \u03b2 1.5 for mH\u00b1 = 300 GeV, and tan \u03b2 1.2 for mH\u00b1 = 500 GeV [162]. With these typical values taken as inputs, the corresponding branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are given in Table 4. It can be seen that, in these two types of 2HDMs, the branching ratio of t \u2192 cg decay is predicted to be of the same order as in the SM (cf. Eq. (4.5)), while the branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg decay remains almost identical with the SM expectation (cf. Eq. (4.6)).\nIn fact, at low tan \u03b2, the flavour constraints are similar among all the four conventional 2HDMs withZ2 symmetries, because the contributions in this case are now dominated by the universal charged-Higgs couplings to the up-type quarks\n(cf. Table 1). Then, it is found that values of tan \u03b2 < 1 are ruled out for all values of mH\u00b1 < 650 GeV, irrespective of the Yukawa types considered [162]. As a summary, we can therefore conclude that, compared with the SM predictions, no significant enhancements are observed in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries for the branching ratios of both t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays, once the flavour constraints on the model parameters are taken into account.\n4.4 Further discussions and comments\nLet us now explain why the \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d phenomenon is more obvious within the SM than in the A2HDM as well as the four conventional 2HDMs withZ2 symmetries. Naively, one would expect that the rate of the two-body decay\nt \u2192 cg is larger than that of the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg, due to the coupling-constant and phase-space suppression of the latter. This is, however, not true within the SM; instead, we find that the predicted branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of t \u2192 cg (cf. Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6)) [39]. To understand such a \u201chigherorder dominance\u201d phenomenon, one should firstly note that both the t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are dominated by the one-loop effective vertex V\u03bctcg\u2217 , which can be generically written as [3] V\u03bctcg\u2217 = ( k2\u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 k\u03bck/ ) ( FL1 PL + FR1 PR\n) + i\u03c3\u03bc\u03bdk\u03bd ( FL2 mcPL + FR2 mt PR ) , (4.9)\nas required by Lorentz and gauge invariance. Here we have suppressed both the colour labels and a sum over the internal quark flavours together with the CKM matrix elements. The form factors FL ,R1 and F L ,R 2 are a function of the gluon virtuality k2, and are called the monopolar (or charge radius) and the dipolar (or dipole moment) form factors, respectively. Note that when k2 \u2192 0, i.e., when the gluon goes on-shell, the FL ,R1 contributions vanish. Therefore, the twobody decay t \u2192 cg is entirely determined by the dipole structure, while both the dipole and the monopole structure contribute to the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg. It also turns out that the contribution from the monopolar form factors can be considerably larger than from the dipolar ones within the SM [39\u201342]. This explains the \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d phenomenon observed within the SM. For the A2HDM, however, the charged-Higgs enhancements are mostly through the dipolar form factors, and hence show up only through a greatly enhanced branching ratio of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg. This helps us to understand why the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays are predicted to be of the same order in the A2HDM. For the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, on the other hand, after taking into account the relevant flavour constraints on the model parameters, significant enhancements are no longer allowed for the branching ratios of both t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays.\nFinally, we would like to make a brief comment on the observability of t \u2192 cgg decay. Note that this process can generally be treated in twofold way: One can either treat it inclusively with t \u2192 cg or consider it as a separate channel [21]. The former means that the process t \u2192 cgg can be\nconsidered as a QCD correction to the t \u2192 cg decay by assuring that two of the three final-state jets are collinear so that only two can be resolved by the detector. The latter is especially promising if the branching ratio of t \u2192 cgg is considerably larger than that of t \u2192 cg, as observed within the SM [39]. However, to detect t \u2192 cgg before t \u2192 cg, one must avoid collinearity by applying certain cuts. To this end, the cutoff parameter C introduced in the phase space plays an essential role in distinguishing the t \u2192 cgg from the t \u2192 cg decay. Here, C must be taken in the range of jetenergy resolution of the detector, and a better jet resolution will be definitely welcome."

            "text": "In this paper, we have firstly updated the SM predictions for the branching ratios of both t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays, with the results given respectively by BSM(t \u2192 cg) = 4.50 \u00d7 10\u221212 and BSM(t \u2192 cgg) = 8.31 \u00d7 10\u221210, finding that the latter is about two orders of magnitude larger than the former, which is a clear demonstration of the \u201chigherorder dominance\u201d phenomenon observed in Ref. [39]. This is due to the fact that the contribution from the monopolar form factors can be considerably larger than from the dipolar ones within the SM [39\u201342]. Note that the branching ratio of the three-body decay t \u2192 cgg is obtained with the cutoff parameter C = 0.01.\nTo check if such a \u201chigher-order dominance\u201d phenomenon is also applied in the A2HDM as well as in the four conventional 2HDMs with Z2 symmetries, we have also evaluated the maximum branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays that can be reached in these different models. After taking into account the relevant constraints on the model parameters resulting from a global fit obtained at the 95.5% CL [75], we find that the branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays can reach up to 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22129 respectively, being therefore of the same order, in the A2HDM. This is obviously different from the SM case, and can be understood by the fact that the chargedHiggs enhancements are mostly through the dipolar form factors, and hence show up only through a greatly enhanced branching ratio of the two-body decay t \u2192 cg. On the other hand, compared with the SM predictions, significant enhancements are no longer possible in the four conventional\n2HDMs withZ2 symmetries for the branching ratios of these two decays, once the flavour constraints on the model parameters [162,166] are properly taken into account.\nNevertheless, the predicted branching ratios of t \u2192 cg and t \u2192 cgg decays in the A2HDM are still out of the expected sensitivities of the future HL-LHC and FCC-hh. To have an opportunity to detect t \u2192 cgg before t \u2192 cg, we have to improve the jet resolution of the future detector. Note that, due to the imaginary components of the loop functions, the CKM matrix elements, as well as the complex alignment parameters \u03c2u,d in the A2HDM, it would also be interesting to investigate the CP asymmetries in these rare top-quark decays [14,27].\nAcknowledgements We are very grateful to Thomas Hahn for useful communications on the function PolarizationSum defined in the packageFormCalc.
