    "abstractText": "Samples from various winemaking stages of the production of sparkling wines using different grape varieties were characterized based on the profile of biogenic amines (BAs) and the elemental composition. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) combined with precolumn derivatization with dansyl chloride was used to quantify BAs, while inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques were applied to determine a wide range of elements. Musts, base wines, and sparkling wines were analyzed accordingly, and the resulting data were subjected to further chemometric studies to try to extract information on oenological practices, product quality, and varieties. Although good descriptive models were obtained when considering each type of data separately, the performance of data fusion approaches was assessed as well. In this regard, low-level and mid-level approaches were evaluated, and from the results, it was concluded that more comprehensive models can be obtained when joining data of different natures.",

            "text": "Data fusion approaches have been considered an excellent way to enrich datasets, particularly for improving the descriptive performance of the method and the overall quality of the information [1,2]. The original datasets obtained with different analytical methods can be simply joined in a global matrix according to so-called low-level data augmentation to be further analyzed with the arsenal of chemometric methods available for characterization, classification, and quantification purposes. In addition, raw data from various sources can be pretreated specifically using chemometric methods, and the resulting individual post-processed matrices can be combined by using mid- or high-level data fusion. Hence, data augmentation approaches are especially fruitful in food analysis for dealing with characterization, classification, and authentication issues [3\u20135]. More specifically, in the case of wines and related alcoholic beverages, several studies have been conducted based on data fusion. Ranaweera and coworkers published an overview of wine authentication based on spectroscopic data and further chemometric analysis [6]. In a broader sense, Arslan and coworkers reviewed the characterization and authentication of alcoholic beverages by nondestructive instrumental techniques and chemometrics [7], and da Costa et al. focused on beers [8]. Among the analytical techniques used to generate data of high quality, near- and mid-infrared spectroscopies have been widely used for the authentication of grappa and other spirits [9,10], wine vinegar [11],\nSensors 2022, 22, 2132. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062132 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2132 2 of 13\nMexican tequila [12], and beers [13,14]. In addition to vibrational data, other spectroscopies, such as UV\u2013vis, excitation\u2013emission fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance, have also been suggested for different classification and characterization purposes [10\u201316]. For fast, selective, and sensitive analyses, high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with flow injection analysis has offered new opportunities for red wine discrimination and classification [17]. Electronic devices, including e-noses and e-tongues, have also been introduced for wine characterization, and the data gained from these techniques have often been combined to obtain more comprehensive descriptions [18\u201321]. For instance, colorimetric sensor arrays based on dyes exhibiting different cross-selectivities towards the analytes were used for the discrimination of alcoholic beverages, including beers and spirits [22\u201324]. These devices, when operated in the gas phase, resulted in optoelectronic noses in which sample recognition relied on volatile species such as aldehydes and ketones. An interesting review of optoelectronic noses can be found elsewhere [25]. Another widely used approach to generate instrumental data to assess wine features relies on separation techniques, including capillary electrophoresis, gas chromatography, and especially liquid chromatography. Several studies using chromatographic data have been reported in the scientific literature for the classification of Lambrusco wines [26], grappa spirits [10], and rums [27]. Multi-sensor data integrating information from a wide variety of analytical techniques have also been introduced for wine analysis. For instance, Izquierdo-Llopart et al. studied the classification of sparkling wines as a function of grape variety and coupage using concentrations of organic acids, phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity, pH, total acidity, ethanol, or reducing sugars [28]. In another recent publication, Cavdaroglu and Ozed developed a strategy for the prediction of vinegar processing parameters based on UV\u2013visible and mid-infrared spectra, pH, Brix, total acidity, total flavonoid content, total and individual phenolic contents, organic acid, sugar, and ethanol concentrations [29]. In this publication, we explore the combination of biogenic amine (BA) and elemental compositions in an attempt to find markers of winemaking practices and product quality. BAs are low-molecular-weight nitrogenous compounds arising from the decarboxylation of amino acids, which are especially abundant in wine, cheese, meat, fish, and spoiled products [30]. BAs provide valuable information on wine quality and oenological factors [31,32]. In wine and cava, concentrations of BAs can provide valuable information on product quality, as they are also a good indicator of food safety. BA contents depend on the agricultural practices involved in the production of grapes, the grape variety used, and the processes of vinification and aging, especially if the wine is exposed to the activity of microorganisms or free amino acids are present. Indeed, alcoholic and especially malolactic fermentations are principal processes involved in BA generation due to the presence of yeasts and bacteria. Some microorganisms can decarboxylate amino acids with specific enzymes to form biogenic amines, thus significantly increasing their content. Once the BAs are formed, they are relatively stable in the wine samples. Putrescine, ethanolamine, tyramine, and histamine are abundant in the final products to be commercialized. Some representative recent examples dealing with the relevance of BAs as biomarkers of wine quality are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.

For instance, elements such as Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, and Mn are relevant markers of some wine features. Despite the apparent disparity between the two types of analytes, they are used to characterize the quality of food products, particularly wines, thus providing complementary information from inorganic and organic species. In addition to the simple combination of BA and elemental profiles in a sample-wise augmented data matrix, other data fusion approaches are explored.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2132 4 of 13"

Biogenic Amine Determination\nThe method for the determination of BAs based on offline derivatization and liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was established and validated elsewhere [33]. Briefly, BAs were derivatized offline by mixing 250 \u00b5L of sample (or biogenic amine standard), 250 \u00b5L of dansyl-Cl reagent solution, and 250 \u00b5L of buffer solution (pH 9.2). The reaction was developed at 40 \u25e6C in a thermostatic water bath (Tectron 473-100, J.P. Selecta, Barcelona, Spain) for 60 min. Derivatives were further extracted by adding 750 \u00b5L of chloroform and applying mechanical shaking for 10 min (Vortex 3 IKA, Staufen, Germany). The organic fraction was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 600 \u00b5L of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v). Derivatized samples were analyzed by HPLC-UV-FLD using a core\u2013shell column (Kinetex C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm I.D., 2.6 \u00b5m particle size) from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA). A 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile (ACN) were used as the mobile phase components under an elution gradient program based on increasing the percentage of ACN (see Reference [33]). The flow rate was 0.7 mL min\u22121, and the injection volume was 10 \u00b5L. UV detection was at 254 nm, and FLD was at 320 nm for excitation and 523 nm for emission. Samples were processed in triplicate and analyzed randomly, injecting the QC sample every 10 samples.\n2.4.2. Elemental Composition Determination\nSamples diluted at a 1/10 ratio with 1% HNO3 were directly analyzed by ICP-OES and ICP-MS, as explained elsewhere [43].

In those studies, the two datasets were studied separately, so independent conclusions were drawn. In this work, however, we wanted to combine information from the two compositional profiles in order to try to improve the quality of the description and provide more comprehensive knowledge of sample features and the influence of the oenological practice, grape variety, and product quality. Hence, data matrices generated in the previous studies were fused using low- and mid-level approaches for further chemometric analysis. First, we present the most important results extracted from the previous studies to highlight the outcomes of their independent chemometric characterizations of must, wine, and sparkling wine samples. As indicated in Section 2 (Materials and Methods), ethanolamine, putrescine, tyramine, histamine, cadaverine, spermine, spermidine, tryptamine, octopamine, lysine, and phenylethylamine were quantified by the HPLC-FLD method, and up to 36 elements were determined by ICP-OES or ICP-MS (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Sb, Sc, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, U, V, W, Y, Zn, and Zr). Table 3 shows the concentrations of some of the most significant components, which were selected because of their relevance as potential descriptors of sample type or sample quality features. As can be seen, potassium is overexpressed in musts, putrescine and histamine levels are increased in samples of C or D quality, sulfur is remarkably higher in base and stabilized wines, and ethanolamine and sodium concentration are, in general, slightly higher in sparkling wines. Similar patterns can be observed for other compounds. Quantification errors were estimated according to Mir-Cerd\u00e0 and Granell (see References [33,43]) from the analysis of the QC sample with the respective methods. The quantification errors of putrescine and ethanolamine (the most abundant amines) were 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively. For the other compounds, errors were below 10% (e.g., 5.5 for agmatine, 8.4 for tryptamine, 9.0 for phenylethylamine, 7.8 for cadaverine, 9.7 for histamine, and 6.6 for tyramine), except for spermidine and spermine (ca. 25%, caused by higher derivatization and stability issues). For the elemental composition, the errors in ICP-OES values of metals occurring at concentrations of the order of magnitude of 1 mg L\u22121 were lower than 2% (e.g., 0.9 for Mg, 1.2 for Ca, 1.5 for P, and 1.7 for Na), except for K (3.5%). For other important descriptors determined by ICP-MS, errors were ca. 5% (e.g., 4.3 for Fe, 2.7 for B, 6.3 for Cs, 7.3 for S, 6.4 for Sr, 5.6 for Ba, 5.0 for Mn, 4.5 for Cu, and 5.7 for Al). Trace elements occurring at concentrations between 1 and 100 \u00b5g L\u22121 showed errors ranging from 7 to 20% (e.g., Li, Mo, Ni, Zn, and V). The descriptive performance of these elements was more limited, thus mainly contributing to the noise. In the case of BAs, PCA models showed well-defined clusters for each sample type, and the loading plot highlighted putrescine and ethanolamine as the best descriptors of the winemaking process. It was found that concentrations in must samples were, in general, low (except for ethanolamine). A remarkable rise in BAs was observed at the base wine stage, i.e., after the first alcoholic fermentation. This increase was even more dramatic for wines subjected to malolactic fermentation since this process has been identified as a major factor in the generation of BAs. After this stage, BA levels remained constant or slightly decreased with stabilization, second fermentation, and aging. This pattern was also observed for other amines, such as tyramine, histamine, and cadaverine. Regarding product quality, differences among high- and low-quality products were noticeable. Regarding elemental composition, interesting patterns in the evolution of the composition of elements such as K, Cu, Ca, S, and Mg during the vinification process were found. Furthermore, some elements were recognized as potential markers of product quality. For instance, the top-quality (A) samples displayed lower contents of some elements, such as K and Ca. Other elements such as Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sr, and Zn also appeared in higher levels in C and D products since they were introduced from additives used in different technological processes. PCA showed two separated clusters corresponding to musts and fermented sam-\nSensors 2022, 22, 2132 7 of 13\nples, thus confirming the noticeable differences due to the addition of several substances during fermentation, clarification, and stabilization processes. Subsequently, during the aging process, they tended to precipitate together with the lees, so their concentrations typically decreased in aged products. Given the remarkable conclusions preliminarily extracted from the analysis of BA and elemental composition datasets, in the following analysis, we aimed to assess the performance of the combination of the two types of descriptors to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the samples."

At this step, variations were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in all cases.

In this study, this issue was fully solved by combining both sources of information via data fusion. The descriptive performance of a low-level approach using concentrations of BAs and metals was, in this case, superior to that of the mid-level counterpart using PCA scores as the fused data. The oenological process was found to be the principal factor affecting the composition of the studied analytes, while, in this set of samples, quality and variety issues had a lower influence on the description. In particular, excellent discrimination of musts, base wines, stabilized wines, and sparkling\nSensors 2022, 22, 2132 11 of 13\nwines was realized, thus suggesting that this data combination can be used for successful sample characterization. Some increases in markers of the different classes were identified as well. For instance, high levels of lysine, K, and Cu were detected in musts, while BAs such as putrescine, tyramine, and histamine and elements such as Zn, Al, Mn, and Fe were predominant in base and stabilized wines, and ethanolamine was identified as a biomarker of sparkling wines. Furthermore, PLS-DA successfully classified samples as musts, base wines, stabilized wines, and sparkling wines, meaning that this method can be applied to accurately follow the evolution of oenological samples throughout the winemaking process.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.I.-L. and J.S.; methodology, A.M.-C., B.G. and A.I.-L.; investigation, A.M.-C., B.G., and A.I.-L.; resources, J.S.; data curation, A.M.-C., B.G., and J.S.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, A.M.-C., S.S., and J.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, \u00c0.S., J.F.L.-S., J.S., and S.S.; supervision, \u00c0.S., J.F.L.-S., J.S., and S.S.
