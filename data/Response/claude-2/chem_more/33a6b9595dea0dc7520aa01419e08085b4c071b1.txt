 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper on CysModDB:

1. Expand CysModDB to include more organisms beyond the current 12 organisms. As more cysteine PTMs are identified in diverse species, expanding the database coverage will make it more comprehensive.

2. Incorporate experimental PTM identification techniques beyond chemical probes. For example, top-down mass spectrometry can directly identify certain PTMs without enrichment. Adding top-down data could reveal additional PTM sites.

3. Develop new prediction models for the metabolite PTM types using advanced machine learning algorithms. Currently no predictors exist for the newly reported metabolite PTMs like s-itaconation.

4. Investigate residue coevolution around cysteines to understand PTM crosstalk. Analyze how mutations of nearby residues affect modification occupancy.

5. Integrate quantitative PTM occupancy data to study modification dynamics. Adding occupancy ratios across conditions will enable studying how PTMs change with cellular state.
