1. **Investigate the relationship between chemical pressure and physical properties in a wider range of materials.** The paper focuses on the effects of chemical pressure on magnetic, electric, and thermal properties, but it would be interesting to see how chemical pressure affects other properties, such as mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. This could lead to the discovery of new materials with unusual properties.


2. **Develop new methods for quantifying chemical pressure.** The paper proposes two methods for quantifying chemical pressure, but these methods are based on experimental lattice strain and elastic modulus. It would be useful to develop more theoretical methods for quantifying chemical pressure, which could be used to predict the effects of chemical pressure on materials properties.


3. **Explore the use of chemical pressure to synthesize new materials.** The paper demonstrates that chemical pressure can be used to synthesize new compounds and to tune the properties of existing compounds. It would be interesting to explore the use of chemical pressure to synthesize new materials with novel properties, such as negative thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, and superconductivity.


4. **Investigate the effects of chemical pressure on phase transitions.** The paper briefly mentions that chemical pressure can affect phase transitions, but it does not go into detail. It would be interesting to investigate the effects of chemical pressure on phase transitions in more detail, and to see how chemical pressure can be used to control phase transitions.


5. **Develop new methods for applying chemical pressure.** The paper discusses four methods for applying chemical pressure: chemical substitution, chemical intercalation/de-intercalation, size effect, and interface constraint. It would be interesting to develop new methods for applying chemical pressure, which could be used to achieve higher levels of chemical pressure or to apply chemical pressure to a wider range of materials.
