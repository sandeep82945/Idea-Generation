Across Europe and the United States, remarkably higher positive rates of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent hospitalization with COVID-19 occur among migrant and ethnic minorities compared to majority populations [1\u20135]. In Europe, populations of non-Western origin from South East Asia and Africa appear to have increased risks of infection and hospitalization [1]. This overrepresentation of COVID-19 infections has mainly been explained by circumstances related to impaired access to care, comorbidity, low socioeconomic status as well as communication barriers and health literacy [1\u20136]. The role of all these different factors partly depended on national contexts. In 2021, 10% and 4%, respectively, of the Danish population were either immigrants and descendants, of which 58% and 83% were of non-Western origin [7]. Further, immigrants and descendants of non-Western origin accounted for 25.7% of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 while these groups represent 8.9% of the general population [8]. Similarly, the risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 Introduction",

Norredam et al.\ninfection was almost twice as high among all immigrants and descendants of non-Western origin \u2013 especially those from Somalia, Iraq, Pakistan, Morocco, and Lebanon compared to Danish-born individuals by Danish-born parents [9]. Almost half of this excess risk was explained after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities and socioeconomic confounders such as income, education, frontline job exposure, number of household members and neighbourhood density.\nStudies on disease severity and mortality from COVID19 among migrants and ethnic minorities from the UK, Norway and United States have shown an alarming tendency to poorer outcomes compared to the majority population [10\u201312]. National data from the UK on use of intensive care showed that 34% of those hospitalised had BlackAsianMinorityEthnic (BAME) background although they account for 14% of the population [13]. In contrast, a recent meta-analysis of 58 studies from across the world found that although the risk of COVID-19 infection was higher in most ethnic minorities, once hospitalised, there was no clear inequality [14]. These conflicting findings have emphasized the need for large-scale data \u2013 preferably nationwide - on the risk of death and potential underlying causes of COVID-19 complications and death for migrants and ethnic minorities including the contribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and comorbidity risk factors [15]. Second, in the wake of the pandemic and possible future pandemics, studies are needed from other European immigration countries, which have different compositions of migrants and ethnic minorities and where other contextual factors are at play. Therefore, we aimed to study mortality and use of mechanical ventilation among ethnic minorities compared to ethnic Danes in a nationwide cohort of the Danish population."

National register-based hospital data on cases of COVID-19 were obtained from The National Patient Register, which includes information on diagnoses whenever an individual is in contact with any hospital department by inpatient, outpatient, or emergency room visits [17]. To increase the validity of COVID-19 diagnoses, COVID-19 cases were defined as inpatients hospitalized for \u2265 24 h and only with COVID19 as the primary reason for hospitalization. Patients who were initially hospitalised for < 24 h, but readmitted within 7 days, were included. We excluded individuals who were (i) hospitalized with a secondary COVID-19 ICD-10 code; (ii) who had missing or negative income values or (iii) who lacked information on comorbidity (see Fig. 1). Vital statistics including in- and out-hospital death were obtained from the Civil Registration Registry [18]."

First, the odds ratios (OR) of death with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated among immigrants and descendants, individuals of Western origin and non-Western origin, and individuals originated from Africa, Asia, or Europe. Second, the risk of mechanical ventilation was investigated for immigrants/descendants, individuals of Western and non-Western origin, and individuals from Africa, Asia, or Europe. Third, the risk of death was also examined among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Individuals of Danish origin were used as the reference group for all analyses. Six step-wise models were applied to adjust for sex, age, CCI, household size, education and income.\nFor all analyses, SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 was used with a statistical significance level of 0.05.

Thus, a total of 6,406 individuals had a primary hospital admission for COVID-19.\nTable 1 describes population characteristics. Among hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 78% had Danish origin, 3% Western origin, and 19% non-Western origin. Regarding regional origin, the majority came from Asia (10%) followed by Europe (9%) and Africa (2%). Large intergroup variations were shown for age on admission in that 84% of Danish origin were > 50 years whereas this was only the case for 65% of non-Western origin and 76% of Western origin. Distribution of sex among hospitalised was nearly identical in the three groups. Compared to individuals of Danish origin, Western and no-Western migrants had fewer comorbidities. More non-Western migrants had low educational level, lived in more dense neighbourhoods, or were categorised into the lowest income quartiles compared to the other two groups. Among all inpatients, 977 (15.3%) died and 342 (5.3%) received MV. Of those who died, 89% were of Danish origin, 3% of Western origin, and 8% of non-Western origin.\nTable 2 shows crude and stepwise adjusted ORs.

Regarding regional origin, individuals originating from Europe (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44\u20130.82) and Asia (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.31\u20130.66) had a significantly lower mortality compared to individuals of Danish origin, whereas no significant differences were found for individuals originating from Africa. Among COVID-19 cases from Asia, 56% were from Middle Eastern countries, while most cases of deaths originating from Africa were Moroccans (60%), and the majority of deaths from Europe were among Turks (48%). The odds of mortality was lower for immigrants and descendants compared to individuals of Danish origin regardless of age group. The adjusted OR for individuals 65 years or older was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.52\u20130.88) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.25\u20130.88) for individuals younger than 65 years.\nTable 3 shows that immigrants and descendants (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.22\u20132.15) and individuals of non-Western\norigin (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.35\u20132.47) had a significantly higher odds of receiving MV during admission with COVID-19 compared to Danish born individuals, whereas individuals with Western origin did not differ significantly.

First, immigrants and individuals of non-Western origin had a significantly lower mortality compared to individuals of Danish origin. Second, immigrants, descendants, individuals of non-Western origin and individuals originating from Asia had a significantly higher risk of receiving MV compared to individuals of Danish origin. No significant intergroup differences were found in mortality among those who had received with mechanical ventilation.\nFirst, our results showed that albeit immigrants of non-western origin had a higher rate of admission from COVID-19 in Denmark [9], they did not have a higher risk\nD an\nis h\nor ig\nin W\nes te\nrn o\nrig in\n* N\non -W\nes te\nrn o\nrig in\nH os\npi ta\nliz ed\nC\nO V\nID -1\n9 ca\nse s,\nN =\n49 92\nD ea\nth s w\nith\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9,\nN =\n86 8\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9\nca se\ns t re\nat ed\nw\nith M V, N = 24 9\nH os\npi ta\nliz ed\nC\nO V\nID -1\n9 ca\nse s,\nN =\n22 5\nD ea\nth s w\nith\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9,\nN =\n30\nH os\npi ta\nliz ed\nC\nO V\nID -1\n9 ca\nse s,\nN =\n11 89\nD ea\nth s w\nith\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9,\nN =\n79\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9\nca se\ns t re\nat ed\nw\nith M V, N = 84\nC ha\nra ct\ner is\ntic s\nN o.\n% N\no. %\nN o.\n% N\no. %\nN o.\n% N\no. %\nN o.\n% N\no. %\nW or\nld r\neg io\nna l o\nri gi\nn A\nfr ic\na 13\n4 12\n10 13\n15 18\nA si\na 65\n1 56\n38 49\n46 55\nD en\nm ar\nk 49\n92 10\n0 86\n8 10\n0 24\n9 10 0 E ur op e 21\n0 93\n26 87\n37 1\n32 29\n38 22 27 * Th er e w er e to o fe w C O VI D -1 9 ca se s t o be p re se nt ed in ta bl es fo r i nd iv id ua ls o f W es te rn o ri gi n w he re c el ls a re e m pt y or n ot th er e fo r m ec ha ni ca l v en til at io n Ta bl e 1 (c on tin ue d)\n1 3\n895\nM.

It should be mentioned that descendants showed somewhat contrasting results, but the sample size was very small, which warrants further follow-up for example in combined cross-country data sets.\nSecond, we found that immigrants of non-Western origin were more likely to receive MV than individuals of Danish origin. Here we were not able to divide immigrants and descendants. The higher use of MV among immigrants is in line with previous findings [14, 22]. Again, we did not see any group differences in mortality among those, who received MV indicating equity in quality of intensive care including referral and treatment. It is not straightforward to explain the contrast between lower mortality and higher risk of receiving mechanical ventilation among migrants of non-Western origin in our study. Unfortunately, we were unable to include clinical indicators of disease severity during admission such as oxygen need and biomarkers. Future studies should include disease severity markers in order to account for possible difference at presentation. In addition, immunological and genetic factors have not been taken into account. Finally, communication barriers regarding optimal use of oxygen and ability to cooperate across language barriers with limited quality in access to interpreters due high flow oxygen treatment; and limited visits by families due to restrictions could possibly result in worse disease severity during admission and a higher risk of MV. of 30-day mortality. Studies from the United States and the United Kingdom showed a higher population-level mortality among ethnic minorities infected with COVID-19 at a population level [3, 10, 12]. Our study analysed hospitallevel mortality and this likely explains the discrepancy. Our results are in line with a meta-analysis based on 58 studies concluding that the risk of COVID-19 was higher in most ethnic minorities, but once hospitalised, there were no differences in COVID-19 outcomes [14]. The European studies included in the metaanalysis were from the UK, Italy, and Spain; and included diverse ethnic/racial groups. A more recent Spanish study was similarly unable to show a difference in COVID-19 mortality between hospitalised Europeans and non-Europeans [22]. Our results may be explained by a lower threshold (less severe disease) for hospitalising immigrants with non-Western background due to well-known barriers related to communication and health literacy resulting in uncertainties in the clinical assessment [23, 24]. There were marked differences in age upon admission with immigrants being markedly younger, but age was accounted for in our analyses. Comorbidity could also play a role in immigrants\u2019 lower mortality, as younger people are less likely to have comorbidities. However, adjustment for covariates including comorbidity and sociodemographic factors did not change any of our results markedly. Not all diseases related to the prognosis of COVID-19 are included in the CCI score, i.e. asthma, as it was developed for other purposes, however, the CCI score has been validated as a\n1 3\n897\nM.
