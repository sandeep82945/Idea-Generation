    "abstractText": "This study investigated whether increased attention to the central or peripheral visual field can reduce motion sickness in virtual reality (VR). A recent study found that increased attention to the periphery during vection was correlated with lower self-reported motion sickness susceptibility, which suggests that peripheral attention might be beneficial for avoiding cybersickness. We tested this experimentally by manipulating visual attention to central vs. peripheral fields during VR exposure. We also measured attention to the periphery during vection and motion sickness susceptibility to attempt to replicate the previous results. In Experiment 1, task-relevant cues to target locations were provided in the central or peripheral field during navigation in VR, and we found no differences in motion sickness. In Experiment 2, attention to the center or periphery was manipulated with a dot-probe task during passive VR exposure, and we found that motion sickness was greater in the condition that required attention to the periphery. In both experiments, there was no correlation between baseline attentional allocation and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that restricting attention to the central visual field can decrease cybersickness, which is consistent with previous findings that cybersickness is greater with large FOV.",

            "text": "Virtual reality (VR) exposure often results in visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) symptoms, such as oculomotor discomfort, eyestrain, and nausea (Golding, 1998; Weech et\u00a0al., 2019). It has been estimated that around 61\u201380% of the population will experience mild to severe discomfort during VR interactions (Lawson, 2015). Motion sickness in VR has been termed \u201cCybersickness,\u201d \u201cSimulator Sickness,\u201d or \u201cVirtual Reality Sickness\u201d (McCauley & Sharkey, 1992; Palmisano et\u00a0al., 2017; Saredakis et\u00a0al., 2020). For consistency purposes, we will adopt the term \u201cCybersickness\u201d when referring to VIMS in VR.\nAccording to the sensory conflict theory (Reason, 1978), cybersickness is the result of the sensory mismatch between the visual and non-visual systems, with the most prominent being the conflict between the visual and vestibular inputs. When users experience simulated movement in VR, they receive visual cues to self-motion *Correspondence: Jeffrey Allen Saunders jsaun@hku.hk 1 Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong\nwithout corresponding vestibular cues (Weech et\u00a0 al., 2019). It has been theorized that incongruent sensory cues can trigger a response to possible poisoning, leading to VIMS symptoms (Keshavarz & Hecht, 2012)."

They measured the degree of attention allocation to the central and peripheral visual fields during vection\u2014a visually induced sense of self-motion that is commonly experienced during VR exposure (Weech et\u00a0 al., 2019)\u2014and asked the subjects to report their motion sickness susceptibility using the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire Short-form (MSSQ-Short). Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018) found that greater attention to the peripheral visual field (PVF) during vection was correlated with lower self-rated general susceptibility to motion sickness.\nWei et\u00a0 al. (2018) attributed their findings to the conflict-reducing mechanism proposed by Brandt et\u00a0 al., (1998, 2002). When experiencing the same level of sensory conflicts, different individuals may exhibit varying motion sickness severity based on their ability to regulate visual and vestibular inputs. Those who exhibit fewer VIMS symptoms when experiencing vection possess the ability to downregulate vestibular inputs, while simultaneously strengthening the visual system signals.\nIt has been hypothesized that people tend to rely on their visual periphery more than the central visual field (CVF) inputs to determine self-motion (Dichgans & Brandt, 1978; Ungerleider, 1994). Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) argue that increased attention to the PVF will make visual simulations of self-motion more convincing and strengthen the perception of self-motion. Increased attention to visual information about self-motion could also reduce attention to vestibular inputs. The combination of strengthening the reliability of visual motion information and downplaying vestibular signals might help people to minimize the visual\u2013vestibular conflict experienced during vection."

            "text": "The idea that more attention to the visual periphery reduces cybersickness appears to conflict with the results of other studies that have found that a large field of view (FOV) increases cybersickness (Lin et\u00a0 al., 2002; Rebenitsch & Owen, 2016; Saredakis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Seay et\u00a0 al., 2002; Weech et\u00a0 al., 2019). Restricting the FOV removes peripheral motion information and likely results in a narrower range of attention. If attention to the peripheral motion helps to reduce cybersickness, a small FOV\nwould be expected to produce more cybersickness, which is contrary to the empirical findings.\nA possible explanation for the effect of FOV on cybersickness is that peripheral motion information increases the visual\u2013vestibular conflict that arises when a stationary observer is presented with simulated self-motion (Weech et\u00a0al., 2019). With large FOV, the visual cues to self-motion would be stronger due to the peripheral input, so there would be more conflict with non-visual cues that specify that the observer is stationary.\nThis explanation for FOV effects suggests that increased attention to the CVF, rather than the PVF, would reduce cybersickness. Forcing VR users to restrict their attention to their CVF might decrease the contribution of peripheral motion information, similar to restricting FOV, and thereby reduce cybersickness.\nHowever, restricting attention to the CVF may not be equivalent to removing peripheral information entirely, and attention allocation might affect cybersickness in other ways. It remains possible that removing peripheral motion cues can reduce motion sickness in VR, but increased attention to the visual periphery can also mitigate cybersickness.\nCurrent study: manipulating visual attention during\u00a0a\u00a0VR task Although the results of Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) suggest that visual attention to the PVF can reduce cybersickness, there are some limitations to their study that make it difficult to draw a strong conclusion. First, Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) only measured self-reported susceptibility to motion sickness and did not measure actual motion sickness experienced during vection. Second, Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) did not manipulate their subjects\u2019 visual attention, so the relationship between visual attention and VIMS susceptibility was merely correlational. To demonstrate a causal relationship between visual attention and cybersickness, it would be necessary to manipulate subjects\u2019 visual attention allocation when performing a VR task.\nThe present study tested the relationship between attention allocation and cybersickness by manipulating visual attention during VR exposure and directly measuring experienced cybersickness. Subjects performed a navigation task (Experiment 1) or passively viewed simulated motion (Experiment 2) in conditions that were expected to produce some motion sickness symptoms. Separate conditions were designed to encourage attention to either central or peripheral vision, and subjects rated their motion sickness using standard subjective measures.\nIn Experiment 1, we manipulated visual attention by presenting task-relevant visual cues in either the peripheral or central regions of the displays. In the\nperipheral-cued condition, targets were highlighted when they were in the outer periphery of the visual displays, which is expected to increase attention to the PVF. In the central-cued condition, targets were highlighted only when in the center of the visual displays, which would tend to increase attention to the CVF. The visual information about self-motion would not be affected by the highlighting of targets, so any effects on cybersickness could be attributed to differences in attentional allocation. A drawback of this approach is that it is hard to control fixation. In Experiment 2, we manipulated attention by superimposing a dot-probe task during exposure to provide a stronger manipulation.\nWe also attempted to replicate the finding by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) that attentional allocation during vection is correlated with general motion sickness susceptibility. In addition to the VR exposure task, subjects completed the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire Shortform (MSSQ-Short) to measure their VIMS susceptibility and performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) based on Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018). SART is a reaction task that can measure the relative amount of attention allocated to CVF and PVF during vection.\nIf heightened attention to the periphery during simulated motion decreases cybersickness, as proposed by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018), this would predict:\n\u2022 H1: For the virtual reality exposure conditions, subjects in the peripheral-cued condition would experience less cybersickness. \u2022 H2: Individual differences in performance for PVF vs CVF stimuli in the SART task would be negatively correlated with self-reported motion sickness susceptibility, with increased attention to PVF associated with a decreased tendency toward motion sickness. \u2022 H3: Individual differences in SART performance would also be negatively correlated with the overall cybersickness experienced in the VR exposure conditions.\nAlternatively, attending to the periphery during simulated motion might produce more cybersickness than attending to the central visual field. This would be consistent with findings that cybersickness increases with larger FOVs (Lin et\u00a0al., 2002; Rebenitsch & Owen, 2016; Saredakis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Weech et\u00a0 al., 2019). If so, this would predict:\n\u2022 H1a: Subjects in the peripheral-cued exposure condition would experience more cybersickness. \u2022 H2a: Individual differences in performance for PVF vs CVF stimuli would be positively correlated with motion sickness susceptibility, with increased atten-\ntion to PVF associated with a greater tendency toward motion sickness. \u2022 H3a: Individual differences in SART performance would also be positively correlated with the overall cybersickness experienced in the VR exposure conditions.\nExperiment 1 In Experiment 1, we tested whether allocating attention to the peripheral visual field during virtual navigation reduces the severity of cybersickness. Attention was manipulated by presenting task-relevant visual cues in either the peripheral or central regions of the display, and motion sickness in peripheral and central conditions was compared. In addition to the virtual navigation task, subjects performed the SART task and reported their motion sickness susceptibility to test whether we could replicate the correlation observed by Wei et\u00a0al.

In the preregistration, we stated that the SSQ scores would be transformed by log10(SSQ + 10). We instead used an equivalent transform log10(SSQ/10 + 1).

Subjects were recruited primarily through personal connections and were paid $200 HKD as compensation. All subjects reported that they had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of impairment in vestibular or neurological functioning.\nThe sample size was determined by a sequential procedure, shown in Table\u00a0 1. The interim test used to determine stopping was a t test comparing the MISC ratings in the peripheral-cued and central-cued conditions. The stopping criteria were designed to keep the\noverall Type I error rate less than 5% with no adjustment of the test alpha (i.e., the standard alpha of .05 is used to determine statistical significance). Allowing the procedure to stop early when an interim test finds a significant difference would increase the overall Type I rate, but allowing the procedure to stop early when an interim test finds no difference would decrease the overall Type I rate. The stopping criteria were chosen to balance these two effects. The procedure is similar to some previously proposed methods that use p values from interim tests to determine stopping: the composite-limited-adaptive-sequential test procedure (Botella et\u00a0 al., 2006), and the variable-criteria sequential stopping rule procedure (Fitts, 2010).\nThe procedure was designed to detect a medium-tolarge effect size with high efficiency. We had no prior basis for estimating the effect size for the experimental manipulation, and we planned to do a follow-up experiment to investigate any effects or trends that were observed in Experiment 1. The power and false-positive rate of the procedure were estimated by performing simulations, with 108 simulations per case. For the null case, simulation results confirmed that the overall Type I rate was less than 5%, with an average n = 19.3. Simulations of nonzero effects found that the procedure has 94% power to detect an effect with dz = 0.7, with an average n = 20.9, and 72% power to detect an effect with dz = 0.5, with an average n = 23.1. The power as a function of effect size is approximately the same as using a fixed sample size of n = 28. In Experiment 1, the procedure stopped at the first interim stage (p = .608) with a sample size of n = 16."

The chests were partially hidden inside bushes but were highlighted in red whenever they are in either the center or periphery of the display, depending on the experimental condition.\nThe virtual environments used in this task were coded with Unity version 2018.3.14f1 and presented using an HTC Vive head-mounted display (HMD). The scenes were rendered at a refresh rate of 90\u00a0Hz, with a resolution of 1080 \u00d7 1200 per eye (2160 \u00d7 1200 combined). The software field of view (FOV) was set to match the field of view of the displays. Heading movement was tracked at 90\u00a0Hz and used to continuously update the simulated views. Simulated movement through the environment was controlled using the HTC Vive controller touchpad. The upper and lower parts of the trackpad were used to control forward and backward simulated movement, and the left and right parts of the trackpad were used to control simulated rotation. The forward/backward speed was 6\u00a0m/s, and the rotation rate was 40\u00b0/s.\nTwo attention allocation conditions were tested in a within-subject design (Fig.\u00a01\u2013upper row). In the centralcued condition, the chests were highlighted when they are located inside a 10\u00b0 diameter cone around the forward direction of the head. In addition, subjects were verbally encouraged to pay more attention to the CVF. A white transparent reference point was provided, which allowed the subjects to know where the center of the display was. For the peripheral-cued condition, the chests were only highlighted when they are located more than 40\u00b0 away from the center measured horizontally, and subjects were told to attend more to their PVF. For both attention allocation conditions, chests were only highlighted when they were within 50\u00a0m of the player.\nTo prevent subjects from remembering the chest locations across conditions, two similar virtual forests were constructed. The only difference between the forests was the specific locations of the trees, bushes, and chests. Each virtual forest consisted of 150 empty bushes, 39 bushes with a chest, and 185 trees. The order of the two attention allocation conditions and pairing with the two virtual forests were fully counterbalanced."

The experimenter prompted the subjects to orally report a MISC score every 2\u00a0 min of VR exposure. A MISC score can range from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no discomfort, 6 suggesting a slight sense of nausea, and 10 representing vomiting.\nThe MISC scores used for the main analyses were from one of the four exposure blocks, selected based on completion rate. We expected that some subjects would not be able to complete all four exposure blocks. To ensure that the subjects only experienced mild cybersickness, the virtual navigation task was immediately stopped whenever symptoms were rated as 6 or more on the MISC scale. If only a small number of participants were unable to complete all four exposure blocks (< 25% of total subjects), we planned to use the MISC scores from the last completed blocks for analysis.

We administered the SSQ to subjects immediately before and after VR exposure. The SSQ consists of 16 items, with each question capturing the severity of a particular motion sickness symptom (e.g., headache, nausea) on a scale of 0\u20133. Responses were summed to obtain an SSQ total score, and scores for the nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation subscales.\nThe SSQ scores were transformed and normalized before performing statistical analysis. First, a log transform was applied to the raw SSQ scores, log10(SSQ/10 + 1), to reduce the skew of distributions. We further normalized the SSQ scores to compensate for any pre-exposure symptoms by subtracting the pre-exposure log-transformed SSQ scores from the post-exposure log-transformed SSQ scores.\nMotion sickness susceptibility questionnaire short\u2011form (MSSQ\u2011short) As in Wei et\u00a0al.

A SART block included 100 trials presented over a period of about 4\u00a0min. We limited the duration of the SART task to avoid causing motion sickness symptoms.\nFor the navigation task, subjects were given 8\u00a0 min to \u201ccollect\" treasure chests scattered in the forest. Treasure chests were collected by moving close to the chests, which triggered an animation of the chest opening. Subjects remained seated when performing the virtual navigation. To manipulate visual attention, central or peripheral cues (i.e., chests being highlighted with a red outline) were provided depending on the experimental condition. Every two minutes during the exposure, subjects were asked to verbally report their MISC rating of cybersickness symptoms. The virtual task was terminated immediately whenever the subjects reported a MISC score \u2265 6, or by their request due to significant discomfort.\nBefore performing the virtual navigation, subjects performed a short practice block to familiarize themselves with the navigation and task. The virtual environment for practice was a single room with four treasure chests. Subjects moved to collect the four treasure chests before proceeding to the main navigation task."

There was a small trend toward lower cybersickness in the peripheral-cued condition, but it was not statistically significant. Our findings do not provide support for the hypothesis that more attention to the PVF will alleviate cybersickness level.\nHowever, our conclusions are limited by the fact that the peripheral-cueing effect may have been temporary. For the peripheral-cued condition, it is possible that our subjects quickly shifted their fixation to the cued location whenever a chest was highlighted. If so, attention may have only been briefly reallocated to the periphery in this condition. In Experiment 2, we addressed this issue by implementing a stronger manipulation of visual attention allocation during virtual reality exposure.\nVisual attention allocation and\u00a0motion sickness susceptibility We were not able to replicate the results reported by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018). We did not observe a significant relationship between the attention allocation scores and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility. There was also no significant correlation between the measures derived from the SART task and experienced cybersickness.\nOur inability to replicate the results by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) could be due to the differences in the measure of attentional allocation. In the original study, subjects performed the SART during coherent background motion that induces vection and also during incoherent motion. The incoherent motion condition was used as a baseline when computing the measure of attention allocation. In our Experiment 1, we only tested SART with the vection-inducing background motion, so our measure did not normalize for any differences in attention allocation during incoherent motion. If a tendency to attend to the periphery during vection is associated with decreased motion sickness susceptibility, either measure of attentional allocation would be expected to show a negative correlation. However, it is possible that our measure was less sensitive. To test whether the difference in measures could account for our failure to replicate Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) in Experiment 1, we performed a closer replication in Experiment 2.\nExp 1 - Attention Allocation vs Experienced Cybersickness\nExp 1 - Motion Sickness Susceptibilty vs Experienced Cybersickness\nExperiment 2 In this follow-up study, we modified the virtual reality exposure conditions to provide a stronger test of whether allocating attention to the central or peripheral visual field reduces cybersickness. For the virtual reality exposure, we implemented a stronger manipulation of visual attention allocation and also controlled the simulated player movement. A dot-probe task resembling the SART task was integrated into the virtual experience. Subjects \u201crode\u201d a virtual rollercoaster ride that was expected to produce mild cybersickness. Throughout the exposure, dots were periodically presented in either the central or peripheral region of the display to encourage sustained attention to the CVF or PVF, depending on the experimental condition.\nWe also modified our method for measuring attention allocation during vection to more closely match the method used by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018). Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) tested the SART task with two types of background motion: coherently rotating dots or incoherently rotating dots. Our Experiment 1 only included the coherently rotating background. Experiment 2 tested both of the SART conditions, which allowed us to compute the same attention allocation measure used by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018)."

The environment was rendered at a resolution of 2160 \u00d7 1200 (1080 \u00d7 1200 per eye) at a 90\u00a0Hz refresh rate.\nDuring the exposure, subjects were \u201cseated\u201d in a selfmoving cart. They were given the ability to translate head movements to the virtual environment. The cart moved forward at a constant speed of 20\u00a0 km/h, following an invisible rail track with multiple horizontal turns. Through the ride, subjects were presented with a white/ black dot at a randomized 1500-2000\u00a0 ms interval. Each target remained visible on the display for 500\u00a0 ms. Subjects were instructed to press the \u201cShift\u201d key when they detect a white dot, but do nothing for the black dots.\nTwo attention allocation conditions (Fig.\u00a0 1\u2014bottom row) were tested in a within-subjects design. For the central-cued condition, the white/black dots only appeared in the central region of the HMD display (FOV: 0\u00b0\u20135\u00b0). The experimenter verbally encouraged the subjects to pay more attention to the CVF in this condition, and a white transparent reference point was provided to indicate the center of the HMD display. For the peripheral-cued condition, the targets appeared in the peripheral region of the HMD display (FOV: 20\u00b0-30\u00b0) instead. No reference point was provided, and the subjects were told to attend more to their visual peripheral in this condition. The presentation order of the two attention allocation conditions was counterbalanced."

With this manipulation, we detected a significant difference in cybersickness between the attention-cueing conditions. The observed difference provides evidence that the dot-probe task did affect attention allocation.\nEncouraging subjects to focus more on their central vision resulted in comparatively less cybersickness than when attention to the periphery was encouraged. This difference was observed in all of the cybersickness measures\u2014MISC, SSQ, and SSQ subscales. This finding contradicts the prediction made by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) that attention to the periphery would reduce cybersickness. On the other hand, it is consistent with previous studies that have found that restricting the FOV reduces cybersickness.\nThe dot-probe task in the central-cued and peripheral-cued conditions might have differed in difficulty, but it is unlikely that this explains the observed difference. Previous studies suggest that an increase in cognitive load can lead to a decrease in motion sickness (Bos, 2015; Seno et\u00a0 al., 2011). As individuals become more mentally occupied in sickness-inducing situations, such as attempting to solve a challenging math question during virtual navigation, this may distract them away from the experienced symptoms. If there was a difference in task difficulty in our conditions, the peripheralcued condition would be the more challenging task because there were more variations in the target locations. The peripheral-cued conditions would therefore be expected to produce less cybersickness, which is in the opposite direction as the difference observed in Experiment 2. Sepich et\u00a0 al. (2022) reported that excessive cognitive load might instead elevate cybersickness. However, we believe that neither the centralcued nor peripheral-cued version of the dot-probe task was overly demanding to our subjects, so a benefit of increased cognitive load on cybersickness would still be expected. Although cognitive load might have had some effect on cybersickness, it is unlikely that this was the cause of the reduced cybersickness with central attention in our experiment.\nIt should be noted that our current findings may have underestimated the actual effectiveness of our manipulation in mitigating cybersickness due to a potential floor effect. In Experiment 2, there were a sizeable number of subjects who appeared to be highly resilient to cybersickness. At least a quarter of our sample (n = 10) did not experience any discomfort in either of the attention-cueing conditions as measured by MISC ratings. For users who are naturally not susceptible to cybersickness, any sickness-reducing intervention would have little impact. The estimated effect size observed in Experiment 2 was dz = 0.362\u00a0\u2212\u00a0 0.693, depending on the measure. If our sample had been composed entirely of cybersickness-susceptible individuals, the effect size would likely have been larger.\nVisual attention allocation and\u00a0motion sickness susceptibility In Experiment 2, we were still unable to replicate the findings of Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) despite using the same measures and a larger sample size that had sufficient power. For both \u2206RT (the attention allocation measure used in Experiment 1) and \u2206RTnorm (the attention allocation measure used by Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018)), attention allocation as measured by the SART was not predictive of selfreported motion sickness susceptibility. Even using the same measures as Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018) and a more closely matched design, we did not replicate their main finding.\nThe results from our Bayesian analysis indicate that any correlation between attention allocation and motion sickness susceptibility in the expected direction was small. The lower bound of the 95% interval of credible values was r = \u2212\u00a0 .228, indicating that any negative relationship that was present explained at most 5.2% of the variance. If we missed a negative correlation that was present, the size of the effect is likely to be minimal.\nWe also found no relationship between baseline attention allocation and experienced cybersickness. Null results were observed for both of the attention allocation measures (\u2206RT and \u2206RTnorm). The results from the Bayesian analyses indicate that any correlation between attentional allocation and cybersickness was unlikely to have a correlation of r > .433 or r < \u2212\u00a0 .302. We cannot rule out the possibility that a medium-sized correlation (|r|= 0.3\u20130.4) was present but missed."

            "heading": "General discussion",
            "text": "Across experiments, we found no evidence that allocating attention to the periphery reduces cybersickness (H1). Based on the findings of Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018), we hypothesized that reallocating visual attention to the PVF during VR exposure would reduce experienced cybersickness. A negative correlation between attention\nallocation tendency and overall experienced cybersickness would also be expected (H3). Neither of these effects was observed. We also failed to replicate the negative correlation between attention allocation during vection and self-reported motion sickness susceptibility reported by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) (H2).\nInstead, we found evidence to support our main alternative hypothesis (H1a). Given that previous studies found that restricted FOV can reduce cybersickness, we hypothesized that encouraging attention to the CVF, rather than the PVF, would reduce cybersickness experienced in VR. Consistent with this hypothesis, Experiment 2 found that cybersickness was lower in the central-cued condition compared to the peripheral-cued condition. A further prediction would be that attentional allocation tendency would be positively correlated with motion sickness susceptibility (H2a) and overall cybersickness (H3a). These hypothesized correlations were not observed in either experiment.\nManipulating visual attention to\u00a0reduce cybersickness We manipulated visual attention allocation to CVF/PVF using task-relevant visual cues (Experiment 1) or a dotprobe task (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 did not find any significant difference between the two attention-cueing conditions, but Experiment 2 found that cybersickness was reduced in the central-cued condition.\nOne possible reason that Experiment 1 did not find a detectable difference between the two attention-cueing conditions is that the peripheral-cued condition did not produce sustained visual attention to the periphery. In Experiment 1, we used exogenous visual cues (i.e., highlighting the chests in red) to manipulate attention allocation in VR, which served as hints about the location of the chests. Because the chests were distributed across the environment, the cues would generally encourage a wide allocation of attention. However, after being cued to the location of a chest, subjects might quickly shift their attention to focus on a single target chest, rather than maintaining a wide allocation of attention. If the exogenous cues in the peripheral-cued conditions had only transient effects on attention, then this could have prevented any effects on cybersickness.\nAnother factor that could have contributed to the null finding in Experiment 1 is differences in experienced motion. We allowed subjects to freely control their virtual movement. Although we did not record the virtual movement in Experiment 1, we noticed that some subjects performed less active navigation as they experienced discomfort, which may have been a strategy to reduce cybersickness. If subjects altered their movement in response to discomfort, this would tend to reduce any differences between conditions.\nExperiment 2 was designed to avoid the limitations of Experiment 1. The dot-probe task provided a more reliable manipulation of attentional allocation. To perform well, subjects would have to continuously attend to either the CVF or PVF during the VR exposure. The observed difference in cybersickness confirms that the manipulation did have some effect. Experiment 2 also controlled the simulated motion across conditions. Subjects were \u201cseated\u201d in a self-driving cart during VR exposure, and thus unable to slow down or pause in-game movements when they begin to experience symptoms. These methodological differences could explain why an effect of attentional cueing on cybersickness was observed in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1.\nA connection can be drawn between the effect of attention reallocation and FOV on cybersickness. Previous studies have attempted to control cybersickness by reducing the in-game FOV (Lin et\u00a0 al., 2002; Rebenitsch & Owen, 2016; Saredakis et\u00a0al., 2020; Weech et\u00a0al., 2019). The sensory conflict is minimized as restrictive FOV removed the motion cues available in the visual periphery. In Experiment 2, although periphery motion cues remain available across the two conditions, the centralcued condition encouraged the subjects to constantly attend to their CVF, which would limit the attentional resources that are available for peripheral motion cues. For both types of interventions, CVF attention cueing and restrictive FOV, lowered cybersickness could be explained by reduced processing of peripheral motion cues.\nBaseline attention allocation tendency and\u00a0motion sickness In both experiments, we failed to replicate the findings by Wei et\u00a0al. (2018). No significant correlation was observed between motion sickness susceptibility scores and the two attention allocation measures (\u2206RT or \u2206RTnorm).\nThe negative relationship between attention allocation tendency during vection and motion sickness susceptibility reported by Wei et\u00a0 al. (2018) may not reliable, or might have been a false positive. In Experiment 1, the failure to replicate might have been due to insufficient power and some methodological differences. However, Experiment 2 was a closer replication and well-powered but still did not replicate the previous findings. We were unable to detect any significant relationship between MSSQ-Short and attention allocation tendency as measured by either \u2206RT (the measure used in Experiment 1) or \u2206RTnorm (the measure used in Wei et\u00a0al. (2018)). Furthermore, the results from Experiment 2 indicate that any negative relationship between attentional allocation\ntendency and motion sickness susceptibility was very small: r > \u2212\u00a0.228 for \u2206RT and r > \u2212\u00a0.142 for \u2206RTnorm.\nWe also did not observe any correlation between attention allocation during vection and overall experienced cybersickness, which appears to conflict with the experimental results from Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, we found that cybersickness was reduced in the central-cued condition. Given this finding, one might expect that people with a natural allocation tendency toward the CVF would be less likely to experience motion sickness during VR exposure, which was not observed.\nIt is possible that the baseline level of attention allocation is not representative of the attentional distribution when performing tasks in virtual reality. Allocation of attention is known to be flexible and can be shifted with various visual cues (Kean & Lambert, 2003). Therefore, any context-relevant visual cues that manipulate visual attention allocation, such as performing a dot-probe task in VR or receiving an in-game notification on a newly received side quest, could disrupt the effect of the default attention allocation tendency. This could explain why the default attention allocation tendency was not predictive of experienced cybersickness in our studies, despite the fact that our manipulation of attention affected cybersickness in Experiment 2."

            "text": "We performed exploratory analyses to assess the effectiveness of MSSQ-Short in predicting cybersickness. Although both experiments found positive correlations between MSSQ-Short and overall MISC/SSQ scores, the amount of correlation was modest: r = .448\u00a0\u2212\u00a0 .558. Anecdotally, we observed that multiple subjects rated themselves as highly susceptible to motion sickness with the MSSQ-Short but experienced minimal cybersickness during the actual exposure. This raises the question of whether the MSSQ-Short is a valid predictor of cybersickness susceptibility.\nIt has been suggested that the MSSQ may not be the optimal tool for predicting visually induced motion sickness, such as motion sickness induced by VR exposure. Keshavarz et\u00a0 al. (2019) pointed out that the MSSQ was not specifically constructed to gauge one\u2019s likelihood of experiencing visually induced motion sickness, but rather symptoms that are induced physically. The MSSQ derives general motion sickness susceptibility from one\u2019s history of discomfort in\u00a0situations where physical motion is expected, such as riding a boat. None of the MSSQ items capture the incidence of motion sickness symptoms in\u00a0 situations where strong physical motion is unlikely to occur, such as watching a 3D movie. To accurately predict cybersickness, alternative instruments that are\nspecifically designed to measure visually induced motion sickness susceptibility specifically might be preferred."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "We discovered that reallocating attention to the central visual field can reduce cybersickness symptoms. This finding was observed in Experiment 2, which was a wellpowered experiment that avoided some methodological limitations of Experiment 1.\nThe effect of allocating attention to the CVF on cybersickness may be comparable to the effect of restricting FOV. Previous studies have found that restricting FOV can reduce cybersickness (Lin et\u00a0al., 2002; Rebenitsch & Owen, 2016; Saredakis et\u00a0 al., 2020; Weech et\u00a0 al., 2019). Our results demonstrate that restricting attention to the CVF can also reduce cybersickness. Both interventions might reduce the severity of cybersickness by minimizing the processing of peripheral motion cues.\nWe found no evidence that attention allocation tendency predicts self-reported susceptibility to motion sickness or experienced cybersickness during VR exposure. Experiment 2 failed to replicate the findings of Wei et\u00a0al. (2018) despite using a closely matched method and having good statistical power. Because visual attention can be easily shifted with context-relevant visual cues, the default attention allocation tendency may not be useful for predicting cybersickness.\nAuthor contributions Both authors contributed to all aspects of the project with the exception of data collection, which was performed by the first author.\nFunding This research was supported by a grant from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (GRF 17407914).
