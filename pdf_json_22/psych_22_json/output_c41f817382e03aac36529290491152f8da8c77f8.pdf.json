            "text": "Despite growing acknowledgement of the importance of adolescent mental health and the potential of investing in this formative period, it remains severely neglected.1 This is particularly true in low- income and middle- income countries (LMICs), where 90% of the world\u2019s adolescents live, socioeconomic adversities affecting mental health are prevalent and mental health resources remain poor.2 Given that most mental disorders have their onset before 25 years of age, early identification and treatment of emergent mental disorders has the potential to reduce chronicity and sequelae for individuals, and be an efficient strategy for addressing population- level mental health.3 Investments in mental health have the potential to support socioeconomic transitions and contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty and mental ill- health in LMICs.4\nAdolescence is a critical developmental period during which individuals develop their self- identity, acquire skills and preferences with which they navigate future challenges, and make decisions that can affect their longterm health, education, relationships and employment prospects.5 6 Higher- order cognitive functions such as executive function and social cognition, which regulate the ability to strategise, set and maintain goals, and build successful relationships with others, develop significantly during this period.7 Thus, the physical, cognitive, social and emotional capabilities acquired during adolescence lay a foundation for the well- being of individuals throughout their adult lives.8 Depression interferes with the acquisition of these capacities, thus limiting young people\u2019s ability to fulfil their potential.\nGlobally, depression is one of the leading causes of disability among adolescents, and suicide is the third leading cause of death among the 15\u201319 year age group.2 9 Left untreated, depression affects interpersonal relationships, interferes with schooling and disrupts productivity.10 It also has a marked negative effect on executive function and social cognition, with depressed individuals consistently underperforming on cognitive assessments compared with healthy controls.11 12 Furthermore, depression in adolescence has been associated with a greater risk for substance use, poor sexual health, delinquency and a significant reduction in future income.13 14 Scalable psychological therapies to address depression among adolescents, particularly in low- resource contexts, are urgently needed.\nSeveral barriers hinder progress in providing treatment to adolescents with depression in LMICs. First, while various treatments for depression have been shown to be effective among adolescents in high- income contexts, few have been adapted for or rigorously evaluated in lowresource or culturally diverse settings.15 16 Second, there is a major shortage of mental health professionals in most\nLMICs,17 and although task- sharing approaches present a promising strategy, they require substantial inputs in training and supervision of non- specialist healthcare workers.18 Thirdly, there are significant challenges associated with relying on an already overburdened healthcare sector, not least that depression is rarely detected in primary care in most LMICs.19 Finally, even in contexts where adolescent mental health services are available, stigma, lack of mental health awareness and issues with the acceptability of services prevent adolescents from seeking care.20\nDigitally delivered behavioural activation (BA) therapy offers the potential to overcome a number of these barriers. BA is a highly effective psychological therapy that is easier to deliver and less costly than cognitive\u2013behavioural therapy.21 22 Importantly, there is also evidence that it can be effectively adapted for use: (1) with adolescents,23 24 (2) in low- resource contexts and diverse cultural settings25\u201327 and (3) in a digital format.28 Delivering BA in a digital format may be particularly helpful in contexts where there is a paucity of mental health specialists and health systems are already juggling multiple competing priorities. It also offers the potential to overcome internalised barriers to care, such as stigma and lack of mental health awareness, and this form of guided self- help may be more acceptable to adolescents.20\nDespite the many potential advantages of digital mental health interventions, studies that have evaluated their effectiveness among adolescents have yielded mixed results.29 30 Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of digitally delivered BA comes from studies conducted in high- income countries,28 and it is, therefore, an open question whether it is possible to generalise these findings to an African context, where conditions and resources differ vastly.29 31 Furthermore, studies of online self- help interventions among adults in LMICs showed high attrition rates,31 and adherence to mental health apps in all contexts is often low.32 While some commercial smartphone apps attract more users, many have not been rigorously evaluated and show little fidelity to evidence- based treatments.33 34\nThis study will address an important gap in the literature by providing evidence on the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of using digitally delivered BA to address depression among adolescents in an LMIC context. Furthermore, we will pilot a range of relevant mental health, risky behaviour and socioeconomic measures, as well as novel culturally adapted measures of executive function and social cognition."

Furthermore, participants in both groups will receive 200 MB of mobile internet data at six different time points (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 11 and 24 weeks) to ensure they have data to use the app and complete the online surveys. Participants in both arms will receive active symptom monitoring via text messages sent to the smartphone every 2.5 weeks.

The app and phone calls from the peer mentors together comprise the Kuamsha programme.\nThe Kuamsha app is primarily an interactive narrative game consisting of six tailored modules (sessions) containing BA\u2019s core principles integrated into the gamified story content format.38 Each module takes approximately 15\u201320 mins to complete, and they cover topics such as identifying and engaging in meaningful activities and using strategies to overcome barriers, for example, using problem- solving, effective communication, getting enough sleep and disengaging from rumination. Each module is followed by a homework activity where the participant is encouraged to reflect on the BA principles outlined in each module and think about ways to apply the principles to their own lives. Participants will be asked to report how often they completed the homework activities and their mood as they were doing these activities. The app includes game design elements to stimulate motivation and performance, including character personification, in- app points and reminders/notifications. Example mock- ups of the Kuamsha app and a summary of each module are shown in online supplemental tables 2\u20134.\nThe Kuamsha app will be supplemented by weekly phone calls (15 mins per module) from trained peer mentors. There will be seven calls in total, including one introductory phone call and six calls to cover module content. Peer mentors will attempt to reach participants by calling up to five times per week. The role of the peer mentors is mainly to support adherence and compliance with the app, troubleshoot problems related to the use of the app and assist with the implementation of the homework activities. They will be trained not to provide additional advice or counselling and conduct their calls according to a predetermined checklist of activities to help ensure fidelity. Peer mentors will be Xitsongaspeaking students or recent graduates from the department of psychology or social work at an accredited South African university. The trial psychologist will train and supervise them according to the training manual developed specifically for the intervention.\nPrimary objectives and outcome measures Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. A mixed methods approach will be adopted to establish feasibility and acceptability. \u25ba Feasibility will be assessed by collecting data on the following: 1. Recruitment (enrolment rate of eligible partici-\npants) and retention in the trial at the end of the intervention period (11 weeks).\n2. Feasibility of testing procedures and data collection methods, including assessment of completion rates. 3. Treatment adherence rates, where adherence is defined as having opened at least four out of six of the app modules and as having completed three out of six phone calls with the peer mentor (excluding the introductory call). We will complement the treatment adherence rates with engagement metrics collected via the app (number of times participants logged into the app, number of modules opened and completed, total time spent on the app, number of weekly activities set to do and number of times the participant completed the weekly activities). \u25ba Acceptability of the intervention and study procedures will be assessed via: 1. An acceptability questionnaire conducted at the\nend of intervention assessment (week 11) with all participants. The questionnaire consists of three measures: Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure and Feasibility of Intervention Measure.39 Each measure consists of four items. The total score ranges from 1 to 5 and is calculated by averaging response scores to the response categories. We will calculate an average score for each of the measures. We will inquire about the acceptability of the app using these three measures (to both the intervention and control groups) and the acceptability of the peer mentor programme (to the intervention group only). 2. In- depth interviews with a subsample of participants. We estimate that interviews with 20 participants will provide a sufficient range of experiences and perspectives to reach data saturation. This subsample will contain participants from the treatment and control arms and will be stratified based on high versus low app engagement. \u25ba Fidelity of delivery of the intervention will be assessed by collecting data on adherence and competence of trained peer mentors. 1. Adherence of the peer mentors is defined as\nthe number of sessions that meet at least 90% of the criteria for adherence according to the training protocol. Independent raters will listen to a random sample (10%) of recordings of peer mentors\u2019 phone calls with participants and assess them against the training protocol. 2. Competence of the peer mentors will be expressed as a percentage based on their competency assessment test. This test will include a written test and observation of skills through role- playing to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices. Tests will be scored by the trial psychologist using a predetermined scoring system.\n(IIT P atna).

These will be based on a traffic light system of green (continue to RCT), amber (make modifications to trial procedures before embarking on a definitive RCT) and red (a definitive RCT is unlikely to be feasible).40\nSignals of initial efficacy on depressive symptoms. This will be assessed using the PHQ- A Score at the end of intervention assessment (week 11). The PHQ- A is a widely used and well- established measure of adolescent depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks.41 The PHQ- A will be administered in Xitsonga. While this measure has not been validated in Xitsonga, it showed good psychometric properties with a sample of adolescents and young adults in South Africa and Kenya42\u201344 and has been validated in various other South African languages, which also form part of the \u2018Nguni\u2019 language group, including isiXhosa,45 seTswana,42 isiZulu and seSotho.43 The questionnaire consists of nine items. The PHQ- A total score ranges from 0 to 27 and is calculated by assigning scores to the response categories (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3- nearly every day) and summing the score for each of the items. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression. PHQ- A scores of 5, 10, 15 and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.41 We will use this scale to assess depressive symptoms at screening, week 5, week 11 and week 24. Participants will also be asked to complete this scale at week 2.5 and week 7.5 as part of the symptom monitoring. More information on how we will analyse this data and trial progression criteria can be found in the data analysis section.\nSecondary objectives and outcome measures As part of our secondary objectives, we will pilot locally adapted measures of mental health, social\u2013affective and cognitive processing, risky behaviours and socioeconomic outcomes. The overall aim of implementing these measures is to assess their acceptability, feasibility and variation, and use these descriptive data to inform the development of a future larger trial. More details on how we will analyse these secondary outcomes can be found in the SAP in the online supplemental material 1.\nMental health outcomes Mental health outcomes include the following scales Generalised Anxiety Disorder46; Connor- Davidson Resilience Scale47; Brief Rumination Response Scale48; Warwick- Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale49; Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale.50 Participants will be asked to complete these scales at baseline (week 0), midintervention (week 5), end of intervention (week 11) and follow- up (week 24). See table 2 for details.\nSocial\u2013affective and cognitive processing Social\u2013affective and cognitive processing include five computerised cognitive tasks measuring affective setshifting, affective working memory, risk- seeking preferences, emotion recognition and abstract reasoning. The tasks include a modified version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task51; the Backward Digit Span Task52; the Balloon Analogue Risk Task53; an Emotion Recognition Task54; and the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank Task.55 Participants will be asked to complete these tasks at baseline (week 0) and end of intervention (week 11).\nRisky behaviours The questions on sexual behaviours include a subset of items from the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (Wits RHI) sexual behaviour survey.56 We will measure substance use using the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test for Youth.57 We will also ask about delinquency, gambling and peer influence in participants\u2019 engagement with risky behaviours. Participants will be asked to complete these tasks at baseline (week 0) and end of intervention (week 11).\nSocioeconomics We will measure economic preferences (time preference, risk preference and loss aversion) using three incentivised tasks.58 59 In addition, we will measure a range of socioeconomic outcomes, including measures of time use, human capital investment and spending. Participants will be asked to complete these tasks at baseline (week 0) and end of intervention (week 11)."

We will use descriptives to explore patterns in the data, followed by inferential statistics involving univariate and multivariable models. A two- tailed p value<0.05 will be considered statistically significant in the inferential analyses.\nPrimary objectives Our first coprimary objective (feasibility and acceptability) will be assessed using a mixed methods approach. We will compute appropriate summary statistics (eg, proportions, means, SDs, etc) for each quantitative outcome and evaluate the feasibility of the trial based on the predefined progression criteria discussed earlier.\nQualitative interviews will be audio- recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Transcripts will be analysed using thematic analysis. We will follow Braun and Clarke\u2019s six phases of analysis (ie, becoming familiar with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes and producing the report).62 Coding will be done by two independent researchers. NVivo V.10, a computer programme that aids in the sorting and management of qualitative data, will be used to facilitate the analysis.\nOur second coprimary objective (initial efficacy on depressive symptoms) will be based on the PHQ- A Score (continuous) at 11 weeks. Outcomes will be compared between intervention and control groups using a linear regression model and adjusting for covariates (PHQ Score measured at baseline, sex, age, depression severity and household asset index). As a secondary analysis, we will make use of the repeated measurements of the PHQ- A throughout the trial (up to six times per individual) to evaluate the treatment effects over time. The details of this analysis will be documented in the SAP.\nSecondary objectives The descriptive data of the secondary outcomes will include possible floor and ceiling effects, accuracy, duration, latency and efficiency. We will perform standard psychometric tests to examine whether the instruments perform well in the study context (eg, reliability, validity, acceptability) and calculate bivariate correlations across variables of interest. We anticipate that some secondary analyses will be included in companion papers rather than the main paper. The details of this analysis will be documented in a separate analysis plan."

This effect size is based on findings from previous studies investigating digital psychological interventions, with effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) ranging from 0.24 to 0.57.29 63 64 Given these findings, we chose a small- to- medium effect size of 0.45 to account for the limited number of studies conducted with our target population and in our study setting. We allowed for 25% attrition, based on a previous study with adolescents in the Agincourt setting.65 Given these assumptions, we aimed to recruit 200 participants at baseline.
