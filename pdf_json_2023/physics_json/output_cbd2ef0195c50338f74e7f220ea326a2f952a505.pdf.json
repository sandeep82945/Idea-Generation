    "abstractText": "Herein, pyridinium and 4-vinylpyridinium groups are introduced into the VIE-active N,N\u2032-disubstituted-dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines (DPAC) framework to afford a series of D-\u03c0-Astructured dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines in consideration of the aggregation-benefited performance of the DPAC module and the potential mitochondria-targeting capability of the resultant pyridiniumdecorated DPACs (DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6). To modulate the properties and elucidate the structure\u2013property relationship, the corresponding pyridinyl/4-vinylpyridinyl-substituted DPACs, i.e., DPAC-Py and DPAC-D-Py, are designed and studied as controls. It is found that the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect enables the effective separation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6, which is conducive to the generation of ROS. By adjusting the electron-accepting group and the \u03c0-bridge, the excitation, absorption, luminescence, photosensitizing properties as well as the mitochondria-targeting ability can be finely tuned. Both DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 display large Stokes shifts (70\u2013222 nm), solvent-dependent absorptions and emissions, aggregationinduced emission (AIE), red fluorescence in the aggregated state (\u03bbem = 600\u2013650 nm), aggregationpromoted photosensitizing ability with the relative singlet-oxygen quantum yields higher than 1.10, and a mitochondria-targeting ability with the Pearson coefficients larger than 0.85. DPAC-D-PyPF6 shows absorption maximum at a longer wavelength, slightly redder fluorescence and better photosensitivity as compared to DPAC-PyPF6, which consequently leads to the higher photocytotoxicity under the irradiation of white light as a result of the larger \u03c0-conjugation.",

            "text": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging method for the treatment of cancer and bacteria, has attracted much attention due to its low invasiveness, toxicity, and drug resistance [1\u201311], among which, image-guided PDT is attracting increasing attention for its potential in the theranostics. It has been recognized that exploring high-performance luminescent photosensitizers is very important to the development of image-guided therapy. It is reported that as compared to the traditional photosensitizers [12\u201319], the photosensitizers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) not only usually have efficient aggregated-state luminescence but also possess the aggregation-boosted generation of ROS. As such, AIE-active photosensitizers have emerged as a new type of fluorescent\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176392 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 2 of 19\nphotosensitizers [10,11,20\u201324]. Nevertheless, at present, the types of AIE photosensitizers still need to be expanded. A class of phenazine derivatives with unique multiple emission properties has been developed since 2015. Specifically, such N,N\u2032-disubstituted-dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines emit intense blue light in the constrained state, while relatively moderate orange-red fluorescence is emitted in the unconfined state [25\u201332]. As can be seen from the molecular structure, blue light is the intrinsic emission of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines, because the saddle-shaped configuration of the phenazine ring gives rise to the limited \u03c0-conjugation. When molecularly dispersed, the dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines could undergo vigorous intramolecular vibrations and rotations. The active intramolecular motions partially consume the excited-state energy which accounts for the not very efficient emission of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines in the unconstrained state. In addition, the intramolecular vibrations of the central phenazine ring render the conformation changing from bent to planar, which leads to the elongation of the \u03c0-conjugation and the resultant abnormal orange-red emission. A series of theoretical calculations and experiments have been carried out to prove that the emergence of the orange-red emission is induced by the intramolecular bent-to-planar vibrations. Therefore, such a phenomenon was named vibration-induced emission (VIE) [25]. Thus, it is known that, in the dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine system, VIE and AIE compatibly coexist. As a result of the structural-flexibility, these dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines usually show environment-sensitive fluorescence, which can be continuously tuned from orange-red to blue light as the intramolecular motions restrict and vice versa, as a result of the collective effects of VIE and AIE. Such unique photophysical properties make DPAC derivatives a class of excellent ratiometric fluorescent probes with large Stokes shifts [33\u201348]. Based on this, these VIE+AIE systems have been widely used in many fields [33\u201348]. For example, DPAC-based fluorogens have been used for the detection or recognition of chemical species such as metal cations [33,34], dicarboxylate dianions [35,36], and glucose [37], explored for the sensing of physical parameters such as temperature [38,39], viscosity [40] and moisture [41], and real-time monitoring of the specific processes such as gelation [42], self-assembly [43], and microphase separation [44]. Noteworthily, the DPAC derivatives have also been developed recently for biological applications [45\u201348], such as the ratiometric detection and blocking of influenza viruses [46,47], and the in vivo three-photon fluorescence imaging [48]. Undoubtedly, the VIE plus AIE feature endows the dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines with great charm to be tailored as functional materials. At the same time, it has been reported that cancer cells are richer in mitochondria compared to normal cells [49]. Therefore, fluorescent photosensitizers with mitochondriatargeting abilities have attracted much attention, because they can ensure the specificity and effectiveness of the photosensitizers in the imaging and therapy of cancer [50,51]. A number of cationic AIEgens have so far been reported to possess mitochondria-specificity. Fluorophores functionalized with pyridinium group(s) have attracted numerous attentions in organelle-specific imaging [52\u201356], due to the easy introduction of pyridinium units and the positive charge of pyridinium which promotes the probes to target the negatively charged organelle such as mitochondria via electrostatic interactions. Moreover, as reported, the construction of D-\u03c0-A architecture would bring about many benefits [57\u201360], such as strong ICT effect, large Stokes shift, which is vital to the imaging applications [61\u201364], long-wavelength emission, environmental sensitivity, tunable photophysical properties, and even photosensitizing properties, etc. (Scheme 1). Based on the D-\u03c0-A structure, a large number of functional materials for applications in fields including probes, organic solar cells, and non-linear optics have been explored. Herein, we intend to introduce positively charged pyridinium unit into the DPAC framework featured with both AIE and VIE characteristics, in the hope of obtaining a D-\u03c0-A-structured fluorescent molecular system with efficient red light in the aggregated state, aggregation-promoted photosensitizing ability, and mitochondria-targeting ability.

The theoretical and experimental results show that the ICT originated from the D-\u03c0-A structure contributes to the separation of HOMO and LUMO, promoting intersystem crossing (ISC), and thus facilitating the photosensitization.

The torsion angels of DPACPy are \u221239.04\u25e6, 19.94\u25e6 and \u221224.91\u25e6, while those of DPAC-PyPF6 are \u221231.60\u25e6, 40.49\u25e6 and \u221232.93\u25e6, manifesting that they all adopt highly twisted conformations. The greatly distorted conformation can help to avoid the formation of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, which can result in efficient emission in the confined states. As suggested by the single-crystal-structure of DPAC-Py, there are four molecules in one unit crystal cell, and multiple intramolecular C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions (3.140\u20133.594 \u00c5), intermolecular C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N interactions (3.541 \u00c5 and 3.586 \u00c5), and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions (2.692\u20133.581 \u00c5) between the adjacent molecules. Likewise, in the single-crystal-structure of DPAC-PyPF6, there are eight molecules in one unit cell, and the multiple intramolecular C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions (3.049\u20133.570 \u00c5), intermolecular C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions (2.698\u20133.513 \u00c5) and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions (2.395\u20132.688 \u00c5) can be seen, but no obvious \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking can be observed.\n2.3. Photophysical Properties of the DPAC Derivatives 2.3.1. Solvatochromic Effect\nIn the light of the D-A structures of these DPAC derivatives, especially DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6, we firstly tested their solvatochromic effect. The absorption maxima of DPAC-Py in different solvents are around 365 nm (Figure 1A), which are consistent with the absorption maximum of DPAC. However, the absorption maxima (\u03bbabss) of DPACPyPF6 in different solvents are longer than 390 nm, suggestive of an obvious bathochromic shift after the salification. As the solvent polarity increases, the \u03bbabs red shifts from 398 nm (in ethyl acetate (EA)) to 409 nm (in ethanol (EtOH)). It might be because there is an ICT process between the electron-rich DPAC group and the electron-withdrawing pyridinium group, resulting in the significant bathochromic shift in the \u03bbabs with the increasing polarity of solvent (Figure 1B). With the introduction of the vinyl group, the absorption maxima of DPAC-D-Py in different solvents are around 375 nm, which are obviously bathochromic compared to those of DPAC-Py. It is because the vinyl group increases the overall length of \u03c0-conjugation (Figure 1C). Similarly, the \u03bbabs of DPAC-D-PyPF6 is red-shifted as compared to that of DPAC-PyPF6, and the \u03bbabss of DPAC-D-PyPF6 in different solvents are longer than 430 nm. Clearly, after the salification, the \u03bbabss of DPAC-D-PyPF6 are also bathochromic as compared to those of DPAC-D-Py. With the increase of solvent polarity, the \u03bbabs of DPAC-D-PyPF6 red-shifts from 438 nm (in EA) to 450 nm (in EtOH), which is might also due to the ICT effect (Figure 1D). DPAC-Py exhibits red fluorescence in solvents with low polarity (\u03bbem \u2248 610 nm) and orange-red fluorescence in the dispersed state (\u03bbem = 590\u2013600 nm), which is consistent with the VIE characteristics of the parent DPAC. However, the fluorescence emissions are much weaker in solvents with high polarity as compared to those in the solvents with low polarity, which might be due to the quenching of fluorescence by the ICT effect (Figure 1E). The fluorescence emissions of DPAC-PyPF6 in different solvents are very weak. This is possibly because the low-polarity solvent has poor solubility to DPAC-PyPF6, which leads to the severe inner-filter effect. As for the situation in high-polarity solvents, the fluorescence quenching is probably due to the strong ICT effect (Figure 1F). DPAC-D-Py exhibits dual emissions, i.e., orange-red and blue fluorescence, in hexane, toluene, and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 5 of 19\nDCM (Figure 1G). It might be because the intramolecular vibrations of the phenazine unit are partially hindered, which leads to the appearance of blue fluorescence. Such a result suggests the more rigid conformation of DPAC-D-Py as compared to DPAC-Py. Meanwhile, DPAC-D-Py merely shows blue but weak fluorescence in other solvents, which might be due to the fluorescence quenching originating from the ICT effect. Like DPAC-PyPF6, DPAC-D-PyPF6 shows weak fluorescence emission in different solvents (Figure 1H), which might also be ascribed to the intense ICT effect.

AIE/VIE Properties As discussed above, DPAC is a protype VIE fluorophore and moreover its structure follows the restrictions of the intramolecular motions (RIM) principle, thus we tested the AIE/VIE performance of these four DPAC derivatives. We first investigated their fluorescence behaviors in the classical binary solvent system used for the evaluation of AIE behaviors, i.e., tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water. DPAC-Py exhibits dual emissions in THF before water is added (Figure 2A). After the addition of increasing amounts of water (<80 vol%), the red fluorescence emission disappears first. It might be because the water addition causes the increase in solvent polarity which quenches the red light. When the water content reaches 80 vol%, the orange-red emission reappears again and increases with the blue emission simultaneously. Further enhancement of these dual emissions is achieved when the water content is 90 vol%. The fluorescence enhancement when the water content arrives at 80 vol% might be due to the aggregation which restricts the\nFigure 1.

AIE/VIE Properties\nAs discussed above, DPAC is a protype VIE fluorophore and moreover its structure follows the restrictions of the intramolecular motions (RIM) principle, thus we tested the AIE/VIE performance of thes four DPAC derivatives. We first investigated their fluorescence behaviors in the classical binary solvent system u ed for the evaluation of AIE behaviors, i.e., tetrahydrofu an (THF)/water. DPAC-P exhibits dual emissions in THF before water is added (Figure 2A). After the addition of increasing amounts of water (<80 vol%), the red fluorescence emission disappears first. It might be because the water addition causes the increase in solvent polarity which quenches the red light. When the water content reaches 80 vol%, the orange-red emission reappears again and increases with the blue emission simultaneously. Further enhancement of these dual emissions is achieved when the water content is 90 vol%. The fluorescence enhancement when the water content arrives at 80 vol% might be due to the aggregation which restricts the intramolecular motions and activates the AIE process. DPAC-PyPF6 exhibits extremely weak emission in the blue light region THF, but intense orange-red emission in the THF/water mixture when the water content is up to 90% (Figure 2B), suggesting the remarkable AIE effect. Similarly, DPAC-D-Py and DPAC-D-PyPF6 merely emit weak blue fluorescence in the THF solution. On the contrary, when the water fraction is 80 vol%, DPAC-D-Py exhibits moderate greenish-blue emission while strong green light when t e water frac ion (f w) reaches 90 vol% (Figure 2C). Anal gue to DPAC-PyPF6, DPAC-D-PyPF6 is quite weakly blue-emissive in THF but displays very intense red emission at 90 vol% of water content (Figure 2D). As revealed by the plots of I/I0 versus f w depicted in Figure 2E, these four DPAC derivatives are all AIE-active (Figure 2E).

In the DMSO solution, all these DPAC derivatives are very weakly fluorescent. In the DMSO/water system, DPAC-Py exhibits blue fluorescence peaked at 474 nm with the water content increasing from 60 vol% to 80 vol% (Figure S18A). The emission of DPAC-Py at 90 vol% is slightly weaker than that at 80 vol% which might be due to the inner filter effect. As for DPAC-PyPF6, it shows an intense orange-red emission with the peak at 603 nm only when the water fraction reached 90 vol% (Figure S18B). When the water content is no more than 80 vol%, the fluorescence of DPAC-PyPF6 is also quenched due to the ICT, while when the water content is 90%, DPAC-PyPF6 aggregates and the orange-red emission is greatly enhanced. As the water content arrives at 60 vol%, an intense green emission (\u03bbem = 517 nm) of DPAC-D-Py emerges and gets slightly enhanced when the water fraction further increases to 70 vol% and then to 80 vol% (Figure S18C). It might be because of the inner filter effect. The fluorescence at 90 vol% becomes lower than 60 vol%. Similar to DPAC-PyPF6, DPAC-D-PyPF6 almost displays no emission until the water content reaches 90 vol% (Figure S18D), with the fluorescence maximum at 634 nm. As such, the AIE characteristics of these four DPAC derivatives are further reflected by the plots shown in Figure 2F. It can be seen that the high polarities of the DMSO and DMSO/water mixtures exert a remarkable quenching effect on the VIE band of the DPAC moiety. The emission maximum increases from DPAC-Py to DPAC-D-Py to DPAC-PyPF6 and then to DPAC-D-PyPF6, as a result of the elongation of the \u03c0-conjugation and the enhancement of the ICT effect.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 7 of 19\na Determined with THF solution (10\u22125 M). b THF/water mixture with a water fraction of 90% (10\u22125 M).

DPAC-Py and DPAC-PyPF6 were used as models for this measurement. The THF solution of DPAC-Py displays weak dual emissions, showing typical VIE effect. With the addition of hexane, DPACPy is always dual-emissive, and the orange-red emission at 600 nm increases gradually (Figure S19A). It might be because DPAC-Py is well-dissolved in hexane and the low polarity of hexane inhibits the emission quenching of the VIE band. As for DPAC-PyPF6, the case in THF/hexane system is similar to those in THF/water and DMSO/water. It shows almost no emission in the THF/hexane mixture with the hexane fraction lower than 80 vol%, and intensively emits when the hexane fraction reaches 80 vol% (Figure S19B). It is clear that DPAC-PyPF6 is insoluble in hexane. Due to the strong ICT effect, the emission of DPAC-PyPF6 is very weak in the solution state, while the large amount of hexane added caused aggregation of DPAC-PyPF6 and the AIE effect was shown. Moreover, possible binary good/poor solvent systems including nonpolar, polar aprotic, and polar protic solvents were also applied to systematically investigate the photophysical behaviors of DPAC-Py and DPAC-PyPF6 (Figures S20\u2013S23). The results further prove the AIE feature and the polarity sensitivity of the VIE band of the DPAC moiety.\n2.3.3. Solid-State Emission Behaviors\nSubsequently, we tested the solid-state excitation (Figure S24), absorption (Figure S25), and emission properties (Figure 3A) of these four molecules. The powder of DPAC-Py exhibits a remarkable dual-emission with the blue light (@442 nm) slightly stronger than the green light (@516 nm). The single crystal of DPAC-Py also shows dual-emission, but the blue fluorescence (440 nm) is overwhelmingly more intense than the green light (497 nm). In the thin film state, DAPC-Py fluorescent green light peaked at 490 nm. The differences of the excitation, absorption, and emissions of DPAC-Py at different states are supposed to be associated with the packing mode and compactness. In other words, the more compact the molecular packing, the bluer the light. The DPAC-Py molecules in the single crystal are more compactly packed as compared to those in the powder and film state and hence the corresponding emission is bluer. Moreover, the powders might\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 8 of 19\ncontain multiple phases, while the film is more homogeneous and hence displays a broad emission band. As for DPAC-PyPF6, both the powder and the single crystal mainly exhibit a single red-fluorescence band situated at 602 and 615 nm, respectively (Figure 3B), which is consistent with that of the aggregated state discussed above. The film of DPAC-PyPF6 is orange fluorescent with the emission maximum at 585 nm (Figure 3B). The red-shift in the emission maximum of the single crystal and powder of DPAC-PyPF6 as compared to its film might be due to the more compact molecular packing which facilitates the intermolecular interaction. The film of DPAC-D-Py is greenish-yellow emissive with multiple shoulder peaks, reflecting the various conformations of DPAC-D-Py in the film state (Figure 3C). The emission maximum of the powders of DPAC-D-Py is at 537 nm and consistent with that of the aggregated state which was mentioned above (Figure 3C). The emission of DPAC-D-PyPF6 in the film state is very weak due to its strong ICT effect and relatively loose packing. In contrast, the powder-state emission of DPAC-D-PyPF6 is peaked at 631 nm and much stronger than that of the film, which agrees with that of the aggregated state discussed above (Figure 3D). The images of these four compounds at different states taken under daylight and UV light are consistent with the spectral results (Figure 3E and the insets of Figure 3A,B).\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 20\n2.3.3.

It is similar to the case of DPAC-Py. Analogous to the other three DPAC derivatives, DPAC-D-PyPF6 also has a remarkable charge transfer, both at the ground state and the excited state. The HOMO of DPAC-D-PyPF6 is mainly contributed by the benzene ring, the six-membered heterocyclic ring and part of the phenanthrene ring, while the LUMO is mainly distributed on the other benzene group and 4-vinylpyridinium group. It thus can be seen that quite similar to that of DPAC-PyPF6, there is a dramatic \u201chorizontal\u201d ICT in DPAC-D-PyPF6. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were also calculated based on the single crystal structures of DPAC-Py and DPAC-PyPF6 and the results are in good agreement with those obtained from the optimized structures (Figure S27). It is worth mentioning that the energy gap between S1 and T1 (\u2206EST) of DPAC-Py, DPAC-PyPF6, DPAC-D-Py, and DPAC-D-PyPF6 is 0.89, 0.21, 1.13, and 0.35 eV (Figure 4B), respectively, agreeing well with the above discussions. The electrochemical measurements and the DFT calculations have provided good explanations of the photophysical properties."

            "text": "It is known that the remarkable ICT effect and the relatively small \u2206EST values (Figure 4B) usually imply the ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In view of this, we used 9,10-anthracene-bis(methylene) dimalonic acid (ABDA) as the 1O2 indicator to test the ROS-generating ability of these four DPAC derivatives (Figures 5A\u2013C and S28\u2013S30). When the DPAC derivatives are irradiated with white light, the absorbance of ABDA at 378 nm decreases dramatically, suggesting the generation of 1O2. Compared with the commercial photosensitizer, Rose Bengal (RB), it can be seen that the photosensitizing capability of DPACD-PyPF6 is better than that of RB, while the photosensitizing abilities of DPAC-Py, DPAC-D-Py, and DPAC-PyPF6 are worse than that of RB. The good photosensitizing properties of DPACD-PyPF6 can be ascribed to the change from pyridine to pyridinium and the introduction of the vinyl group. For one thing, the salification of the pyridine group enhanced the ICT effect and thus promoted the ISC, which is conducive to the ROS production. For another, the vinyl group elongated the \u03c0-conjugation length. Due to the strongest ICT and longest \u03c0-conjugation, DPAC-D-PyPF6 has the longest absorption wavelength, causing it to have the best absorbing ability of white light among all of these four DPAC derivatives. Subsequently, we tested the ROS-producing ability of DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 under different aggregated states (Figures 5B,C, S29 and S30). With the increase in water content, their ability to generate ROS was gradually enhanced, indicating that aggregation was conducive to the generation of ROS. The aggregated-state singlet-oxygen quantum yields of DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 are measured to be 1.27 and 1.18, respectively (Figures S31 and S32), with RB as the reference. Such data further verified the superior photosensitizing capability of DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 over RB. Considering the positive charge, large Stokes shift, and good photophysical properties of the pyridinium-furnished DPAC derivatives, we assessed their ability to target mitochondria. MitoTracker Green (MTG) and MitoTracker Red (MTR) were selected as the commercial mitochondria indicators for DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6, respectively (Figure 5D,E and S33). When co-incubated with HeLa cells, DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-DPyPF6 show excellent ability to target mitochondria, with the Pearson coefficient of 0.86 and 0.92, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 11 of 19\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20\nWhen the DPAC derivatives are irradiated with white light, the absorbance of ABDA at"

            "text": "In summary, novel fluorescent photosensitizers have been developed based on the typical VIE system. These photosensitizers are constructed with the N,N\u2032-disubstituteddihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazines (DPAC) as the skeleton. The pyridine, 4-vinylpyridinyl, pyridinium, and 4-vinylpyridinium groups were introduced onto the DPAC core to tune the ICT effect and \u03c0-conjugation length. As a result, the D-\u03c0-A-structured DPAC derivatives, namely DPAC-Py, DPAC-D-Py, DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6, were obtained, and the luminescence, photosensitizing, and mitochondrial-targeting ability were finely modulated. As revealed by the systematic experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, when compared to DPAC-Py and DPAC-D-Py, DPAC-PyPF6 has stronger ICT effect while DPAC-D-PyPF6 has both stronger ICT effect and longer \u03c0-conjugation. Consequently, DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 show AIE properties and red fluorescence with large Stokes shifts in the aggregated states, which is different from the VIE phenomenon of the DPAC parent. The cationic DPAC derivatives, i.e., DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6, are mitochondria-specific with Pearson coefficients of up to 0.86 and 0.92. DPAC-PyPF6 displayed a satisfactory ROS generation efficiency and DPAC-D-PyPF6 enjoyed ROS-generating ability higher than the other three DPAC derivatives and even higher than that of the commercial photosensitizer Rose Bengal. Moreover, DPAC-PyPF6 and DPAC-D-PyPF6 show distinct photocytotoxicity and dark cytotoxicity which endows\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6392 16 of 19\nthem with the potential to be applied in the mitochondria-targeting and image-guided dual therapy. Thus, this work not only provides a new type of AIE-active photosensitizers but also expands the application scope of DPAC systems to the field of theranostics.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28176392/s1.
