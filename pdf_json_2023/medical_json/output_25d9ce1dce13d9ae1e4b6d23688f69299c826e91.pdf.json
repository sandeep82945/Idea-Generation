This study aimed to investigate whether plaque\ncharacteristics derived from IVOCT could predict a long-term major adverse cardiovascular\nevent (MACE).\nMethods: This study was a single-center, retrospective study on 104 patients who had undergone\nIVOCT-guided percutaneous coronary intervention. Plaque characterization was performed\nusing OCTOPUS software developed by our group. A total of 31 plaque features, including\nlesion length, lumen, calcium, fibrous cap (FC), and vulnerable plaque features (e.g.,\nmicrochannel and cholesterol crystal), were computed from the baseline IVOCT images\n(obtained before stenting). For IVOCT plaque features, the discriminatory power for predicting\nMACE was determined using univariate/multivariate logistic regression as assessed by area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nResults: Of 104 patients, MACE was identified in 24 patients (23.1%). Univariate logistic\nregression revealed that lesion length, maximum calcium angle, maximum calcium thickness,\nmaximum FC angle, maximum FC area, and FC surface area were significantly associated with\nMACE (p<0.05). Additionally, cholesterol crystal and layered plaque showed a strong\nassociation with MACE (p<0.05). In the multivariate logistic analysis, only the FC surface area\n(OR 2.38, CI 0.98-5.83, p<0.05) was identified as a significant determinant for MACE,\nhighlighting the importance of the 3D lesion analysis. The AUC of FC surface area for predicting\nMACE was 0.851 (95% CI 0.800-0.927, p<0.05). Luminal stenosis was not a strong predictor of\nthe risk of MACE.\nConclusions: Patients with MACE had distinct plaque characteristics in IVOCT. In particular,\nlarge FC surface areas were a risk factor. Interestingly, cap thickness, a commonly highlighted\nfeature for lesion vulnerability, was less predictive than cap area. Studies such as this one might\nsomeday lead to recommendations for pharmaceutical and interventional approaches."

            "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a global scale 1. Given the prevalence of atherosclerosis in a substantial proportion of the population 2, there is a growing interest in accurately assessing disease aggressiveness by\npredicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) through medical imaging. Various\nimaging modalities have been employed to visualize plaque in coronary vessels and characterize\nCAD. In coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images, several high-risk\nfeatures have been identified, such as positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque, napkin-ring sign, and spotty calcification, with their association to MACE serving as a key determinant 3\u20136.\nNotably, recent research has emphasized the assessment of pericoronary fat in CCTA images,\nincluding radiomics evaluations, once again leveraging their association with MACE to support the rationale 5,7\u201312. Using CT calcium score images, one can predict MACE using the Agatston score computed from calcifications 13\u201315.\nNone of the non-invasive imaging modalities currently available can match the exceptional\nresolution and contrast achieved with intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images 16. Notably, IVOCT provides superior resolution (axial: 10 \u03bcm, lateral: 20-40 \u03bcm),\nallowing for precise identification of thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). Through IVOCT imaging,\nwe can quantitatively assess the microscopic characteristics of plaque, including TCFA,\nmacrophage infiltration, cholesterol crystal presence, and microchannels, as validated by histological records 17\u201336. Furthermore, histopathological investigations have indicated a strong\nassociation between the pathogenesis of most acute coronary events (such as plaque rupture and\nmyocardial infarction) and the presence of microcalcification, TCFA, and large lipid-rich necrotic cores 37\u201339. These plaques are also often characterized by both intraplaque and\ninflammation that are strongly associated with plaque progression 40. Extensive ex vivo and in\nvitro studies have further substantiated the correlation between macrophage infiltration and vulnerable plaque characteristics through histopathological evidence 37,38,41\u201343. As IVOCT gives a\npromising, unique perspective on coronary plaque, there is a strong rationale to relate findings\nfrom IVOCT on a long-term cardiovascular risk assessed by the probability for MACE.\nTo date, no studies have investigated whether plaque characteristics derived from IVOCT\nimaging can serve as predictors of MACE. We hypothesize that plaque characteristics derived\nfrom IVOCT are related to the presence of MACE. Specifically, we aim to identify relevant\nfeatures in pre-stent IVOCT images that exhibit an association with MACE. This analysis will\nnot only unveil high-risk features extracted from IVOCT but will also enable subsequent\ncorrelative investigations with CCTA to identify novel high-risk CCTA features based on their\nassociation with IVOCT findings. In this regard, we have found a correlation between specific\nradiomic features of pericoronary fat in CCTA images and microscopic IVOCT characteristics, including thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and microchannels 44. It is important to note that high-\nrisk features identified through their association with MACE may differ from those associated\nwith risk in a specific lesion, as identified solely by CCTA.\nIn this study, we investigated the association between plaque characteristics observed in IVOCT imaging and the occurrence of MACE. Using OCTOPUS software 45 on IVOCT images,\nwe segmented plaques into constituent parts (e.g., calcium and fibrous cap (FC)), extracted\nIVOCT plaque features (e.g., calcium thickness and FC surface area), and determined their\ndiscriminatory power for predicting MACE. Notably, this analysis specifically focused on\nmicroscopic features that are exclusively visible through IVOCT, such as FC and microchannel\ncomponents."

Among the 104 patients, the\nmean age was 67.1\u00b112.0 years, with 74 males (71.2%). During an average follow-up period of\n19 months, MACE occurred in 24 patients. Among the study population, 99 patients (95.2%) had\nhypertension, 53 patients (51.0%) were current smokers, and 56 patients (53.8%) had diabetes\nmellitus. The baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 2.\nWe conducted a comparative analysis of plaque features between the MACE and no-MACE\ngroups. The MACE group exhibited significantly larger lesion length, maximum calcium angle,\nand maximum calcium thickness compared to the no-MACE group (p<0.05 for all) (Table 3).\nSimilarly, there was a significant association between the occurrence of MACE and increasing\nFC features, including maximum FC angle, maximum FC area, FC surface area, and FC burden,\nas compared to the no-MACE group. Notably, maximum FC area-T and FC surface area-T\ndemonstrated the smallest p-values (p<0.000001). However, quantitative features related to\nlumen, calcium depth, and minimum FC thickness did not show significant differences between\nthe MACE and no-MACE groups. Furthermore, all vulnerable plaque features, such as\nmicrochannel and cholesterol crystal, were more frequently observed in the MACE group\ncompared to the no-MACE group. Table 3 provides a comprehensive comparison of IVOCT\nplaque features using a student t-test.\nIn order to address the issue of correlated features, we conducted a hierarchical clustering\nanalysis of IVOCT plaque features using the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient (Fig. 1). Among all the IVOCT plaque features, we identified 12 features (minimum\nlumen diameter, average lumen diameter, maximum FC area 1/2/3, FC surface area 1/2/3, and\nFC burden 1/2/3/T) with Spearman's correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9. Consequently, we\nreduced the total number of features extracted from the IVOCT images from 31 to 14,\nconsidering only features with a rho-value greater than 0.9. Notably, within the heatmap, the FC\nfeatures exhibited the smallest p-values, indicating their potential significance in relation to\nMACE prediction.\nTo assess the discriminatory ability of the features in predicting MACE events, we performed\nunivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In the univariate regression analysis,\nseveral features including lesion length, maximum calcium angle, maximum calcium thickness,\nmaximum FC angle, maximum FC area-T, FC surface area-T, cholesterol crystal, and layered\nplaque demonstrated significant associations with MACE (Table 4). On the other hand,\nminimum/average lumen area and FC thickness did not independently predict MACE.\nSubsequently, in the multivariate analysis, only the FC surface area-T (OR 2.38, CI 0.98-5.83,\np<0.05) exhibited a strong association with the occurrence of MACE (Table 4). The IVOCT\nplaque features that showed significant associations with MACE in both univariate and\nmultivariate logistic regression analyses are summarized in Table 4.\nUsing the single best feature, which was determined to be FC surface area-T based on the\nmultivariate analysis, we constructed an ROC curve to assess the predictive capability of the\nIVOCT plaque feature for MACE (Fig. 2). FC surface area-1 made the smallest contribution,\nwhile FC surface area-2 (65 \u00b5m<T<150 \u00b5m) contributed the most to MACE prediction. The\ncombined AUC for FC surface area-T was 0.851 (95% CI 0.800-0.927). A significant difference\nin FC surface area-T was observed using a box plot analysis (Fig. 3). Additionally, Figure 4\npresents a 3D visualization of high-risk and low-risk lesions in representative IVOCT pullbacks.\nThe high-risk lesion exhibited a thicker calcification thickness (1.32 mm) and a larger FC surface\narea (39.10 mm2), whereas the low-risk lesion had a thinner calcium thickness (0.72 mm) and a\nsmaller FC surface area (1.63 mm2)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation into the predictive\npotential of IVOCT-derived plaque characteristics for future MACE. Building upon our previous research utilizing IVOCT imaging 45,47\u201360, we aimed to establish correlations between IVOCT\nplaque features and the occurrence of MACE. This study offers several noteworthy contributions.\nFirst, we employed our interactive OCTOPUS software to automatically compute plaque features\nsuch as FC thickness and FC surface area. Second, our analysis of features associated with\nMACE revealed the presence of high-risk features, including FC surface area, as well as\nunexpectedly low-risk features, such as TCFA thickness, when assessed in the context of stent-\ntreated lesions. Third, preliminary ROC analysis indicates that features observed in IVOCT\nimages hold the potential to predict future adverse events, potentially offering insights into\npatient management strategies.\nThe predictive power of FC surface area surpassed that of FC thickness, which has been a commonly studied risk factor for lesion rupture in previous reports 41,61,62. Our findings highlight\nthat lesion area plays a more critical role in predicting MACE. This may be partially attributed to\ntemporal trends in plaque pathogenesis. Typically, the formation of a plaque is preceded by the\naccumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, which later undergo apoptosis, resulting in the\ndevelopment of a necrotic lipid-rich core. Subsequently, fibrous tissue forms in the intima,\nleading to the formation of a fibrous cap. Thinning of the fibrous cap typically occurs after plaque enlargement 63. Therefore, the \u201c3D\u201d lesion size may serve as an earlier indicator of plaque\ninstability compared to the \"later\" appearance of a localized thin fibrous cap. Considering the\ndiffuse inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis, it is crucial to analyze the entire 3D lesion,\nspecifically focusing on FC surface area. In another study, we also observed that FC surface area was a strong indicator for predicting the development of neo-atherosclerosis 64. In contrast, no\nassessment of thin cap was a strong predictor of MACE. That is, neither minimum thickness nor\nFC surface area-1 were highly predictive. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the\nsignificance of FC thickness should not be overlooked. In our analysis, FC thickness was\nobtained from a lesion that was subsequently treated with a stent, providing additional protection\nto the lesion. MACE is unlikely to be associated with the treated lesion, although in-stent\nthrombosis and restenosis are possible. It is likely that our assessments are associated with the\nextent of disease. While a thin fibrous cap may signify local plaque instability, a larger surface\narea may indicate a more widespread burden of atherosclerotic disease. This could potentially\ntranslate into acute events occurring in regions outside the imaged plaque, maybe even in another\nvessel.\nInterestingly, luminal stenosis (minimum lumen area) was not a strong predictor of the risk\nof MACE. That is, the severity of a treated, flow limiting stenosis is not a reliable indicator of\nfuture MACE. Based on the arguments presented above, it does not seem to be a predictor of\nMACE-related disease in the rest of the heart. This is to be expected, as a more comprehensive\n3D analysis of the vessel provides a more reliable assessment for MACE, taking into account\nnumerous variable interactions, unlike a single measurement like the minimum lumen area. This finding aligns with a study conducted by Kim et al. 65, which found no significant differences in\nminimal lumen diameter and percentage of stenosis between lesions with and without adverse\nclinical outcomes in patients who underwent IVOCT-guided PCI, thus further supporting our\nresults.\nLong-term outcome prediction studies have predominantly utilized CCTA and cardiac\nmagnetic resonance angiography (CMRA). These studies have focused on clinical characteristics\nand high-risk plaque features such as spotty calcification, low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling, and the napkin-ring sign 66,67. Recently, there has been a growing number of studies that aim to predict long-term outcomes using radiomic features in CCTA 5,7\u201312. For instance,\nOikonomou et al. calculated a total of 843 radiomic features (including shape-related, first-order,\nand texture features) in CCTA images and correlated them with the occurrence of MACE within 5 years of the CCTA scan 9. They discovered a high-risk radiomic profile of pericoronary fat that\nmay be associated with an elevated cardiac risk. Similarly, Kolossv\u00e1ry et al. analyzed 935\nradiomic features, including first-order and textural features with different bin sizes, to identify invasive and radionuclide imaging markers of plaque vulnerability 5. Their results demonstrated\nthat the most informative radiomic features were able to identify attenuated plaque as observed\nby intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), TCFA as observed by IVOCT, and NaF18-positivity.\nHowever, non-invasive imaging modalities such as CCTA and CMRA only have a moderate\ncorrelation with the gold standard intravascular imaging techniques (e.g., IVOCT) and provide\nlimited information about the artery wall and microscopic features of atherosclerosis. IVOCT,\nwith its nearly histological resolution (axial: 10 \u03bcm, lateral: 20-40 \u03bcm) and optical contrast, offers\na comprehensive assessment of coronary arteries 16. Specifically, it enables unique evaluation of\nmicroscopic plaque components such as FC, macrophages, cholesterol crystals, and\nmicrochannels, in addition to macroscopic plaques including fibrous and calcified plaques.\nAlthough IVOCT provides a better representation of the state of atherosclerosis compared to\nnon-invasive imaging modalities, no studies have quantitatively analyzed IVOCT plaque characteristics for predicting future adverse outcomes. In this study, we utilized OCTOPUS 45 to\nperform plaque characterization in IVOCT images, and for the first time, identified FC surface\narea as a significant determinant of long-term MACE outcomes. Our results are promising and\nhave the potential to optimize treatment strategies and improve short- and long-term outcomes.\nImproved and automated characterization of atherosclerosis in IVOCT holds the potential to\nenable personalized treatments. The advancements in preventive and cardioprotective\ntherapeutics over the past decade, including P2Y12 antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants,\nproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, glucagon-like\npeptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, and others, highlight the need for personalized medicine approaches\nthat ensure appropriate treatment for individual patients in a cost-effective manner. Automated\nidentification of high-risk vessels would provide an opportunity to guide the implementation of\nintensive therapies in clinical practice and enhance patient cohorts for testing the effectiveness of\nemerging novel therapeutics. Furthermore, accurate identification of high-risk lesions could\ninform potential revascularization strategies. For instance, in addition to treating a stenosis, an\nextra stent could be added to seal a high-risk lesion. The assessment of plaque changes with precise registration has the potential to facilitate mechanistic studies in drug development 68.\nAdditionally, the identification of high-risk IVOCT characteristics could offer insights to other\nimaging modalities.\nThis study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, it was a retrospective\nstudy conducted at a single center, and the sample size was relatively small. This may limit the\ngeneralizability of the findings to a larger population. Second, the study focused specifically on\npatients undergoing PCI with available IVOCT data. It remains unclear whether the identified\nfeatures would be applicable and relevant to a more diverse and broader population.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with MACE have distinct plaque\ncharacteristics in IVOCT images compared to those without MACE. Particularly, FC surface\narea showed a strong predictive value, while features related to cap thickness were less\npredictive, despite their emphasis in the literature regarding lesion vulnerability. These findings\nhave potential implications for patient management, allowing identification of individuals at\nhigher risk for future events. Furthermore, correlating the features identified in our study with\nthose observed in other imaging modalities, such as CCTA, through multi-modality imaging\nstudies could provide valuable insights."
