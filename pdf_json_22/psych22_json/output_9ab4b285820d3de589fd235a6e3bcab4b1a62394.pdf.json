            "text": "The ICT era has been changing the traditional learning dynamics by providing alternatives to the students for better learning and performance. Teachers\u2019 dominance with a centralized curriculum, high student obedience, memorizing culture, and exam-oriented motivations are a few highly criticized education cultures causing mental health problems in youth. Such a narrowly followed educational system is also why students drop out while outperforming on international academic grounds (1). According to some researchers, focusing on students\u2019 learning performance on international grounds or in comparison with international students is still a complex discussion. Because of a lack of modern and technological learning resources provided to students in early education, they may be unable to meet specific standards (2). Due to Confucian education culture, student performance outcomes in early education are low. This learning tradition forces students to strive to learn and achieve high grades. Teachers and parents are only concerned with hard work and high grades, and the students\u2019 sole goal is to pass the examination. Because they are only exposed to the taught curriculums, their learning performance based on the new and innovative learning methods is low in this context. Moreover, such learning performance impacts their future educational goals, career, primary subject selection in colleges, and career goals (3). Compared to American students, the learning system used in China and the mindset growth of students in modern times are more focused on accepting new technology systems or conceptualized intelligence teaching. However, they are known to put in more effort to achieve goals so that they may perform well. As a result, it is essential to acknowledge that Chinese students are raising their performance to compete with students from the United States and Canada in international universities (4). However, in Chinese educational institutions, adequate resources are not provided for students to improve their learning performance with the assistance of effective and reliable teachers (5).\nIn this regard, the responsibility of the institutes is to provide reliable resources and develop the student\u2019s cognitive andmental abilities to improve their learning performance effectively. Indeed, the students willing to improve their performance to the advanced level are more motivated and are getting instruction from the teachers by utilizing different tools of information communication technology (ICT) to improve their learning to the advanced level (6). Also, students face a different kind of problem when competing with the students of Western countries because they are not provided with adequate training to effectively utilize ICT and its different components, such as virtual reality (7). Therefore, the student\u2019s performance is not justifiable according to the level of the students of the Western and Scandinavian countries. Different critics think that the\nChinese government is not providing appropriate resources, and the stakeholders of the educational institutes are also creating a problem for the students by limiting their performance (8). Project-based learning may be an appropriate initiative for improving students\u2019 learning performance. Students can outperform if they strongly desire to achieve their goals and use active learning techniques. This system is standard in higher international studies, but resource implementation and ability development can produce unexpected results. Projectbased learning is a type of learning in which a project with a specific outcome is assigned to different people for learning performance (9). Project-based learning can help students improve their learning performance. The most widely used learning mechanism is project-based learning based on modern technological knowledge and experimental learning. Students who graduate without project-based learning lack cognitive skills, making them less productive and intellectual (10). Students learning to outperform and achieve grades have a more fearful mind, and societal pressures from teachers and parents to achieve a high score are having a traumatic effect on them. The fearful mind fails to achieve its goals, and as a result, it develops psychotic issues, commonly leading to mental health problems. Students competing for academic positions on an international scale may have more mental health issues, leading to poor learning performance (11). However, some people believe that mental stress is necessary for high achievers. Another essential factor influencing Chinese students\u2019 learning performance is the complexity of mental health and stressors. Furthermore, mental health refers to a state of mind conducive to performing productive tasks (12). People with better mental health learnmore effectively than those with poor mental health. Due to semi-immersive virtual reality, people can communicate more effectively at school and work. It is a learning technology that was created with the help of the information technology sector. It is critical to recognize that student performance is directly related to the context and situation of learning. If students are given the right resources and a better learning environment, their performance will improve and develop more critical thinking skills (13). However, project-based learning is the method to divide the students into groups and provide them with a project to address effectively by communicating with each other (14). Indeed, this critical way of project solving and learning is reasonable for the students who are willing to learn and develop their skills to the advanced level. However, on the contrary, the students with better mental health perform well compared to those with average mental health (15).\nThe students using modern learning tools perform far better than those working on the traditional way of learning (16). In reality, the student\u2019s performance is based on the combined effort of the teacher and the student. The study aimed to understand the critical role of project-based learning, semi-immersive virtual reality, and mental health in learning\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nperformance. Interestingly, there was a clear gap in the literature that was not addressed by any earlier studies (17). In this regard, this study was designed to address this theoretical gap to improve students\u2019 performance in different educational institutes in China. This study aimed to discuss the critical and exciting role of mental health in improving learners\u2019 performance in preschool education with the idea of technology acceptance. The earlier studies were reviewed, but no earlier study was conducted to effectively discuss this significant literature gap. Therefore, this study provides the significant relationship between different variables in a significant way that would be useful for future studies to understand the relationship and develop hypotheses.\nIt is essential to know that the purpose of this study was to address theoretical and practical gaps to improve the performance of students studying in various educational institutes in China. In this regard, it is critical to recognize that this study provides significant theoretical implications that contribute significantly to the literature because no previous study was conducted to develop the relationship between the various variables considered in this study. Significantly, the study\u2019s practical implications must be considered to improve the learning performance of students using the project-based learning method. Moreover, the significant implications of this study would help future studies and the educational institutes of China to work in a reliable and best way for the students to improve their performance. Furthermore, this study has important practical implications for the relationship between project-based learning and students\u2019 learning performance with the aid of innovative technology acceptance. This way, the student\u2019s performance would be raised to the level required to compete with students fromWestern countries (18)."

            "text": "Project-based learning and learning performance\nStudents are not provided adequate resources and technologies to make them learn in the educational sector due to the limited resources available and the lack of attention from the institute management and the concerned government department of any country (4). The student\u2019s performance directly depends on their interaction with the teacher and the other students in the class. Moreover, active students are improving their learning status; they are more concerned with learning innovatively and designing different strategies to get better learning opportunities in an understanding way (10). Besides, traditional methods in the education sector are no longer workable, adversely affecting students\u2019 critical thinking ability because traditional methods cannot provide complete information about essential study concepts, thus lacking\ncredibility (19). The management of schools is responsible because they are held liable for not arranging adequate resources for the better learning of the students. Indeed, it is a fact that the students who are advanced in learning and want to furnish their skills for better productivity are more concerned with innovative ways of developing the concepts at an advanced level (20). On the contrary, students in advanced and developed countries can improve their skills and learning capabilities through technology because technology plays a critical role in people\u2019s advancement and ease of life. More appropriate opportunities and learning apparatus would be provided to the students, and as a result, the student\u2019s critical thinking and performance would be developed to an advanced level because they are always concerned with learning new technologies innovatively (21). In America, most educational institutes have developed technological innovation and integration with the learning material to provide the appropriate and reasonable method for students\u2019 better learning and understanding (22). School management\u2019s responsibility is to ensure that the students are divided into groups and that they are working with the interaction of their fellow students (15).\nThe students who are more interested in learning and are provided with the right opportunities work harder to improve their performance and achieve prosperity in their learning. Unfortunately, the educational institutes of backward and third-world countries have failed to integrate the new and innovative technology to ease the learning material for the students (18). The educational institutes have minimal resources, including their countries\u2019 resources. In this way, the responsibility of the management is to provide the right resources, including the right technology, to ensure that the students are familiar with the technology and that they have the appropriate and reasonable information to utilize that technology for the innovation of new methods for adequate learning. Learning is an art, and the students are directly connected to learning with their cognitive behavior and interest (18). The student is responsible for interacting with the other fellows in the class and effectively discussing the course material concept to define the best strategies for working in the class (10). In this way, it is the responsibility of the management and the teachers to divide the students into different groups and provide the study material for their critical thinking and critically understanding of the topics. Therefore, the students with better critical learning ability are more interested in interacting with the other students because they always want to learn new things with innovative and effective learning methods in groups. It is reasonable to understand that, in group learning, the students are provided with the opportunity to discuss their ideas and do a critical commentary to achieve a better and more reasonable justification (6, 20). Therefore, the study proposed the following hypothesis:\nH1. There is a significant relationship between project-based\nlearning and learning performance.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\nSemi-immersive virtual reality, project-based learning, and learning performance\nThe traditional learning methods are outdated, and the teacher and the student collectively demand a new learning method. It is critical to understand that the students concerned with their learning are more interested in learning with the help of innovative technology in modern times (23). Technology has changed traditional learning methods and has helped improve the learning process for teachers and students. In the traditional time, the outdated and old learning method was appropriate for the students because they were provided with their learning material and courses effectively with the help of the methods of that time (19). However, technological innovation is easy to access, while the traditional ways of learning are changed and replaced with advanced and modern ways of learning. It allowed students to learn and integrate the technology in groups (24). It is critical to understand that, for the students who are provided with the appropriate technology are more active in the performance than the other students who are not using the technology (25). It is essential to understand that, with the help of innovative technologies and easy accessibility in the educational sector, the traditional learning pattern is outdated because the students are more concerned about innovative material and gadgets for learning. In the same way, with the help of digital technology, the students are provided with different kinds of alternative strategies to learn in the class environment (26). Indeed, during a pandemic, students could not get into the school and work in groups because they were not provided with the opportunity to interact socially with the class students (19). Interestingly, in the time of the pandemic, the traditional and outdated way of learning was replaced with the model learning in which the ICT was utilized to the advanced level to help people learn best (27). The services of online learning material are provided to the students to ensure they are provided with the correct information for the right situation to make the appropriate critical decisions for developing the organization to the advanced level (28).\nSimilarly, it is the responsibility of the management of educational institutes to ensure that the students are provided with ICT gadgets to improve their learning and performance. In America and Canada, students are utilizing virtual reality gadgets. With the help of the internet, they are improving their learning standard to an advanced level because it is essential to understand that, with the help of virtual reality, group interaction can be enhanced to ensure that the communication between the students is reliable (12, 23). Similarly, in the educational institutes of Japan, the students are provided with appropriate digital and virtual reality gadgets that are important to consider productively\nto ensure that the students are getting the right opportunity for learning in a developed way (27). At the same time, it is the responsibility of the students to learn about virtual reality and utilize it protectively to ensure that all the related information of group work and project-based learning is solved with the help of communication and effective measurements. In some educational institutes in China, the teachers are not more concerned about virtual reality and the gadgets related to information communication and technology (ICT) because the teachers are not well versed in motivating and providing the related knowledge to the student about virtual reality and its utilization in learning (23). However, in 50% of educational institutes in China, the internet is considered the most helpful factor for providing information to students in their advanced level training (24, 29). Similarly, in the students\u2019 group work, the teacher\u2019s responsibility is to provide the reliable and best alternative way of learning to the students according to the recommendation and requirements of modern times. The students provided with the right opportunities for learning with the help of ICT are more innovative and perform better. Therefore, the management is responsible for ensuring technologically equipped teachers for better learning of students (30).\nH2. Semi-immersive virtual reality moderates the relationship\nbetween project-based learning and learning performance.\nMental health, project-based learning, and learning performance\nMental health is considered one of the influential factors in the student\u2019s performance in any educational sector. It is critical to understand that some students are mentally strong and are better at cognitive understanding to develop concepts related to the course material (31, 32). However, on the contrary, some students are not doing well in cognitive understanding of the concepts of the study because they are not innovative, and their performance is not appropriate in group work. Indeed, the critical role of mental health is appropriate for students to learn innovatively (33). It is the responsibility of educational institutes to provide a reliable and understandable working environment to the students to ensure their performance in the educational sector (34). Moreover, the students are required to do exercises, think positively, and critically relate to the course material because it helps them work innovatively and develop strategies for learning (32). In China and America, the students are enrolled inmental exercise classes in which they are provided with practical mental training and therapy to ensure that they develop the concepts and are mentally stable to perform well in groups in project-based learning (35). On the one hand, the student\u2019s responsibility is to ensure that they are learning persuasively and cannot provide irrelevant study material to\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\ntheir other fellows (32). At the same time, it is also essential to understand that the students must be provided the right opportunity and working environment in project-based learning by the teacher to improve students\u2019 critical cognitive abilities (36, 37). In comparison, if the students are not tolerating the opponent\u2019s lives when working on the project-based learning material in the group, then it would not be appropriate for them to develop their concepts effectively related to their course material and the effectiveness of the information sharing in the group.\nFurthermore, in Denmark\u2019s educational institutes, students are directed to learn the course material in groups to reach a significant conclusion through discussion and appropriate learning (38). Although students\u2019 critical thinking abilities develop to an advanced level, they are also effectively working when they are instructed to learn and draw a conclusion based on any project provided for group discussion (39). Furthermore, it is a reasonable opportunity for students to improve their learning performance and provide a long-term way to develop their critical thinking and performance.\nMoreover, students\u2019 performance in project-based learning has highlighted that a good working environment enhances their cognitive abilities to perform better in their respective groups (31, 40). In the educational institutes of South Korea, the weekdays are considered necessary for mental ability improvement and cognitive learning of the students because they provide the right opportunity for the students to develop a better understanding effectively related to the course material (32, 41). Similarly, Japanese teachers are more concerned with providing reliable and appropriate information to the students according to their mental level (42, 43). It is essential to understand that, if the students are not protected and provided with the right opportunities according to their mental level in group learning, their performance would be declined, and they will not be capable of dealing with the critical issues in learning. The students with poor mental health and who are not attractive to the teachers will not participate actively in the class to learn the coursematerial but present for their face showing in the only. Also, the government must develop a policy for the students to improve their mental ability and cognitive concept learning environment with the help of effective teachers to support the innovation methods (44, 45). Therefore, based on the above discussion, the following hypothesis has been developed:\nH3. Mental health moderates the relationship between\nproject-based learning and learning performance."

            "text": "The study\u2019s theoretical framework is grounded on the theory of learning performance. It is essential to understand that the theory of learning performance deals with the different factors influencing a learner to learn effectively and reliably (46, 47).\nIn this regard, this theory highlights the five critical factors that contribute to and are influential in the learning performance of the students (3, 48). This theory highlights that identity is a critical factor in improving an individual student\u2019s learning performance. Second, this study highlights that learning skills are essential to improving learning performance. Third, the level of knowledge is vital to consider for the improvement of the learning performance of any student. Fourth, the critical role of the context of an individual and the knowledge for better learning improved the performance of the students. Lastly, this study demonstrates the critical role of the personal factors of every individual in the performance and learning of the individuals (49). However, during the literature review, it was identified that several other factors also contribute to the student\u2019s learning performance. In this way, the study\u2019s theoretical framework considers the critical role of mental health as a moderator and the vital role of semi-immersive virtual reality as a moderator in the relationship between project-based learning and student performance. Significantly, the results of this study would justify the moderators\u2019 vital role in improving students\u2019 learning performance in China. Furthermore, the study is based on a theoretical acceptance model, which emphasizes that individual behavior is crucial in triggering technology acceptance. In this regard, the variables considered in the study\u2019s theoretical framework are analyzed under the shadow of the technology acceptance model. The theoretical framework of the study is visual in Figure 1."

In this regard, the questionnaire was created using the Likert scale because it is simple to understand for a larger audience. In previous studies, the survey-based questionnaire was recommended as the best method for collecting data from the targeted respondents within the specified time frame (47). Notably, the scale items for each variable in this study were carefully adapted from other studies to effectively collect data from the target respondents. The scale items for mental health were taken from the study of Akbaba et al. (50). These scale items were taken to understand the relationship and role of mental help as a moderator in the relationship between project-based learning and learning performance. In previous studies, the relationship between different factors of learning performance was tested with the scale items and the quantitative data. Second, the scale items for semi-immersive virtual reality were taken from the study of Makransky et al. (23). These scale items were taken to determine the relationship and test the moderator\u2019s hypothesis in the study\u2019s theoretical framework.

These scale items were also carefully considered to ensure that, in the previous studies, these scale items were to measure the relationship of project-based learning with Lalit performance. Lastly, the scale items for learning performance were taken from the study of Bhattacharyya (13). These scale items were taken to understand how the learner\u2019s performance affects any individual student in the proper context of learning. Moreover, after integrating all the scale items of the study into a single questionnaire, the questionnaire was reviewed two times by different expert researchers to check the face validity of the questionnaire.

Indeed, the students working in groups under the project-based learning strategy provide good performance to develop the conclusion and justify it according to the context of the situation (31). The performing ability measures can be easily predicted in projectbased learning by dividing the students into homogeneous\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 09 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 4 Hypothesis testing.\nNo Relationship Hypotheses Beta STDEV T-values P-values Remarks\n1 Direct PBL -> LP 0.328 0.049 6.653 0.000 Significant\nPBL, project-based learning; and LP, learning performance.\nTABLE 5 Hypothesis moderation testing.\nNo Relationship Hypotheses Beta STDEV T-values P-values Remarks\n2 Moderation Moderating Effect 1 -> LP 0.097 0.026 3.730 0.000 Significant\n3 Moderation Moderating Effect 2 -> LP 0.068 0.018 3.777 0.000 Significant\nLP, learning performance.\ngroups and providing deadline-based tasks demonstrating the ability of learning performance and student achievement capacity. To improve the performance of the student\u2019s learning, teachers must divide the students into groups, give them a deadline for achieving the target objective, and reach a conclusion by discussing the course material and the related problems with effective communication and understanding. (56). In this regard, the students who are provided with the opportunity of such kind are credible to improve their learning performance effectively to enhance their experience (57). Moreover, the responsibility of the educational institutes is to utilize the new and innovative way of learning for the better learning performance of the students (58). Therefore, the more reasonable the working environment provided by the teachers, the more productivity the students would develop to improve their learning performance. Significantly, in the educational institutes of America, the students are directed to learn the course material in a group to reach a significant conclusion with the help of discussion and appropriate learning (59, 60). In this way, not only does students\u2019 critical thinking ability develop to an advanced level but also does the students ability to effectively work improve when they are instructed to learn and draw a conclusion based on any project provided to discuss in the group (39). Also, it is a reasonable opportunity for the students to improve their learning performance and provide them with a sustainable way of developing their critical thinking ability and performance (61\u201363).\nAccording to hypothesis 2, semi-immersive virtual reality plays a significant moderating role between project-based learning and learning performance because students who learn with technology innovation integrated systems are academically capable and have appropriate technical skills compared to those who do not with technology-integrated systems. Indeed, educational institutions are developing a strategy to advance students\u2019 performance through virtual reality and the two distinct functions provided by ICT (64\u201366). Students in developing countries are not given adequate opportunities to develop their critical thinking skills through ICT and other\nvirtual reality tools (23). Indeed, it is critical to understand that virtual reality helps students to learn innovatively because visual observation helps them remember the concepts and the course material in the long term (67). Importantly, for the students that are not provided with that kind of innovative technology to learn in a better way and improve their performance, the performance students are limited, and it is not according to the level of the students who are provided with the opportunity of learning with the help of information communication technology in an effective way (57, 67, 68). It is reasonable to understand that, with the help of virtual reality, the traditional learning dynamics have been changed because the students are provided with a different alternative to learn innovatively and develop effective regulation for their better learning. On the contrary, in advanced and developed countries like America and Canada, students use virtual reality as a tool for learning, and it helps improve their performance to the appropriate level (24, 69, 70). Therefore, the student\u2019s learning performance is far better than those of the backward countries, which are not provided with appropriate resources by the stakeholders and the government policies to improve their learning standards to the advanced level.\nThe results of hypothesis 3 highlight a significant moderating role of mental health in the relationship between project-based learning and learning performance. It is critical to understand that, the students who are provided with the opportunity to develop their mental health effects during the class session and different exercises in the educational sector, their performance of the students is improved when they are learning in a group based on the project-based learning method (33, 40). The project-based learning method is essential for the students because it allows them to develop different strategies and reach a conclusion with the help of fellow students in a group (71). However, if a student\u2019s mental health is appropriate, the student would develop critical thinking ability and dominate the group in his views to improve the learning standard to the appropriate level and reach a conclusion (42, 56). In Japan, the students are trained to improve their mental health and are provided with reasonable exercises to develop their cognitive\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nlevel according to advanced studies to ensure that they are provided the appropriate level of certification for their better learning (72). Indeed, cognitive factors and mental health work a lot in the study because, with the help of better mental health, it is easy for the students to read and draw a conclusion in the project-based learning opportunity (64, 73). Significantly, in third-world countries, the trend of mental health importance is increasing, and the educational institutes are considering it to the advanced level for the better development of the cognitive ability of the students (74, 75).\nSimilarly, the responsibility of the teachers is to design the curriculum in an attractive way to provide the best learning method to the students to improve their standards. Moreover, mental health defines the understanding ability of any students related to the course material (29, 31, 33). To improve mental health effectively, the students have the critical role of getting involved in different cognitive exercises provided by the experts (76, 77). In this way, the student\u2019s mental understanding would be increased, and they would perform well in their learning methods (78, 79)."

            "text": "The study framework is based on the Chinese school and college education system, where students work hard to achieve the highest possible score to compete with international students. In this regard, there is a critical need to provide technology resources and teachingmethods to improve students\u2019 technical knowledge and ability to obtain the appropriate content of modernized, innovative, and technology-based knowledge. In this study, project-based learning, mental health, and semi-immersive virtual reality were investigated in conjunction with the technology acceptance model to assess the learning performance of students in schools and colleges. The hypotheses were developed to provide helpful information. Project-based learning positively impacts learning performance because students get to know and learn different skills through different projects and develop the ability to perform practically through those developed skills. Mental health and semiimmersive virtual reality played a significant moderating role in the relationship developed between project-based learning and learning performance. When it comes to mental health, it is a crucial factor to consider because enhancing a student\u2019s healthy mind is required for project-based skills. In addition, semiimmersive virtual reality allows students to learn practically in a controlled environment. It enhances the essence of projectbased learning among students and, as a result, improves their learning performance.\nTeachers and parents in China are working to improve students\u2019 mental health and learning performance, but learning performance can be improved by motivating students to perform well in group-based activities for project-based learning. Surprisingly, it is the stakeholders\u2019 responsibility to\nintegrate ICT and physical exercises to improve students\u2019 cognitive and mental abilities to improve their performance when learning in groups using the project-based learning method. Furthermore, this study highlighted the significance of project-based learning in improving learner performance because it allows students to discuss the project in groups and reach an effective conclusion to develop different strategies for better understanding and compatibility. Students\u2019 performance would improve and be developed in an effective way to use ICT in favor of learning to get better responses and adopt an easy and understandable way of learning to achieve better results."

The relationship between project-based learning and learning performance was not discussed in previous studies, despite the moderating role of mental health and semi-immersive virtual reality. In education, students enrolled in schools and colleges can embrace technological innovation because of their ability to exert effort to achieve high marks. As a result of the study\u2019s findings, stakeholders must consider the critical role of project-based learning in improving the performance of school students because adequate and dependable policies must be conducted and implemented efficiently to ensure students\u2019 prosperity and prosperityimproved learning behavior.\nFurthermore, this study demonstrates that, by effectively implementing virtual reality, educational institutes in China will improve learner performance and provide them with the most reasonable way to obtain the appropriate level of learning. Better mental and cognitive abilities must also be considered to improve students\u2019 project-based learning for effective learning. The students should be allowed to improve their mental ability through various means to improve their standard of performance in learning and a better understanding of the course material when they are in a group and working on the project-basedmethod of learning.

First, we will address the sensitive issue of student mental health. As discussed in this study, it moderates the relationship between project-based learning and learning performance. Teachers must ensure that their students enrolled in project-based learning are mentally fit and gain the necessary expertise from the content taught. If students\u2019 mental health is poor, they may be unable to learn and perform well despite all the available resources. As a result, it is an essential measure for assessing students\u2019 learning performance. In practice, this study shows that, if teachers and stakeholders develop and implement appropriate policies for students\u2019 learning, the appropriate role of reasonable mental cognitive ability must be considered, and students must be provided with various types of exercises and study material to help them improve their mental health and critical thinking ability.\nStudents\u2019 cognitive abilities will improve with good mental health, aiding in their project-based learning and skill development. Another critical factor highlighted in this study that is required for improving learning performance is semiimmersive virtual reality. Integrating technology for innovation into the education system is insufficient if there is no practical exposure. Teachers can create a virtual reality environment where students can virtually experience and practice with various tools and gadgets to improve their comprehension and practical ability. China is a developed nation with an advanced technological system. Incorporating these technologybased systems into the educational system would improve students\u2019 mental intelligence while expanding their professional opportunities. Students learning performance in schools can be improved to a reasonable level with effective management by using the project-based innovative learning method, which also improves students\u2019 critical thinking ability. Significantly, teaching institutes must be provided with appropriate resources to improve learner performance by preparing them to learn using modern and advanced virtual reality tools. Not only would the learners\u2019 performance improve but also would the learners be given the necessary opportunities, in line with top countries where students are given these abilities and tools to learn effectively and perform well."
