Our method can be applied to any gas model, and, as an example, we present the results for the van der Waals gas.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCalculating the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles is a central issue in practical applications. Moreover, when teaching, the basic concepts of thermodynamics can be introduced very efficiently through calculations of energy efficiency. In most textbook examples [1\u20133], the thermodynamic cycles in the pressure-volume (p \u2212 V ) diagram include only four types of processes: isothermal (constant temperature), isochoric (constant volume), isobaric (constant pressure), and adiabatic (heat-insulated system). Engines including such cycles, like the Carnot, Otto, Brayton (or Joule), Diesel, Stirling, Rankine, and Sargent cycles, are well known in the literature. To calculate the exchanged heat and work done for these systems, it is assumed that all processes are idealized; i.e., they are quasi-static and reversible, and there is no friction, turbulence, or heat loss. The common feature in the four above-mentioned types of idealized processes is that the exchanged heat and the work done can be calculated analytically for a gas characterized by its equation of state and its internal energy.\nThe calculation of the specific heat and of the thermal efficiency for unconventional thermodynamic processes (which deviate from the four special ones mentioned above) has been a frequently studied issue in the literature. For example, the specific heat has been calculated for gases in an arbitrary process in Ref. [4] and for the ideal gas along an elliptical p \u2212 V cycle in Ref. [5]. Similarly, to calculate the thermal efficiency, the use of logarithmic plots of the p\u2212V diagram has been suggested in Ref. [6]. The thermal efficiency has been calculated for cycles in the p \u2212 V diagram involving diagonal processes with negative slope [7\u201311], parabolic processes [10], circular processes [12], an unconventional lobe [13], and an alternative thermodynamic cycle for the Stirling machine [14].\nExtending the calculation of the thermal efficiency to\ngeneral cycles then is a natural development. Indeed, for unconventional processes, the calculation of the efficiency is not obvious at all since it is rather difficult to calculate the absorbed and released heat during the cycle. In principle, one needs to locate the segments of the cycle where heat is absorbed or released by the fluid. These segments are separated by points at which the adiabatic curves are tangent to the curve representing the given cycle [11]. In most cases, such calculations cannot be performed analytically. This problem can be complicated even in the simple case of a circular process [12].\nTo avoid this problem, in this work, we present a general formalism for calculating the thermal efficiency for arbitrary cycles parametrized in the p\u2212V diagram. Figure 1 shows such an example in which the cycle is a heart-shaped curve. Although such a heat engine is probably not realistic, our general approach could be useful in practice and may provide a didactically useful example for teaching the calculation of thermal efficiency as well.\nOur formalism is quite versatile; it is valid for all gases provided their equation of state and their internal energy are known. We shall calculate the thermal efficiency both for ideal gas and for the van der Waals gas. From the calculation we shall identify the segments of the p \u2212 V diagram where heat is absorbed or released from the heat engine.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present our general formalism to obtain the thermodynamic efficiency. In Sec. III, we demonstrate the universality of our method by calculating the thermal efficiency of ideal gas engines for a few non-trivial processes defined in the p \u2212 V diagram. In Sec. IV, we extend our formalism to the van der Waals gas. Finally, in Sec. V, we summarize our main conclusions.\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n06 95\n6v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 1\n0 Ja\nn 20\n22\n2 1 2 3 V 1 2 3 P\nFIG. 1. Heart-shaped curve in the p\u2212 V diagram.

            "text": "First, we consider an arbitrary gas, assuming that its equation of state and its internal energy U(T, V, n) are known. Here, T is the temperature and n is the number of moles. From the differential form of the first law of thermodynamics, the exchanged heat for an infinitesimal quasi-static process depending only on the thermodynamic coordinates T and V is given by\nd\u0304Q = dU + pdV = \u2202U\n\u2202T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V dT + ( \u2202U \u2202V \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T + p ) dV . (1)\nThe notation d\u0304 signals that d\u0304Q is not an exact differential of the state variables. The partial derivative of the internal energy U in the first term is the heat capacity at constant volume: CV = [\u2202U/\u2202T ]V (in general, it is known for a given gas), while the second term can be rewritten using the relation\n\u2202U\n\u2202V \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T + p = T \u2202S \u2202V \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T = T \u2202p \u2202T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V , (2)\nwhich can be derived from the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics dU = T dS \u2212 p dV , where S is the entropy, and the Maxwell relation [\u2202S/\u2202V ]T = [\u2202p/\u2202T ]V . From the equation of state we may write dT = [\u2202T/\u2202p]V dp + [\u2202T/\u2202V ]p dV , and then Eq. (1) can be\nrewritten as\nd\u0304Q = CV \u2202T\n\u2202p \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V dp+ ( CV \u2202T \u2202V \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p + T \u2202p \u2202T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V ) dV . (3)\nOne can see that the exchanged heat d\u0304Q can be obtained by knowing only the equation of state and the heat capacity at constant volume CV . Note that Eq. (3) is valid for all gases, and that the temperature dependence of the three partial derivatives can be eliminated using the equation of state, so that they depend only on p and V . Equation (3) is one of the central results in this work and a starting point for further calculations.\nLet us now parameterize the cycle in the p\u2212V diagram. For a general cycle, we define the dimensionless pressure P(\u03d5) and volume V(\u03d5) as a function of a parameter \u03d5 in the following way:\np(\u03d5) = p0 P(\u03d5), and V (\u03d5) = V0 V(\u03d5), (4)\nwhere p0 and V0 are constants characterizing the dimensions of p and V , and the parameter \u03d5 is a real number varying in a closed interval [\u03d5i, \u03d5f ]. For a closed cycle, p(\u03d5i) = p(\u03d5f ) and V (\u03d5i) = V (\u03d5f ). In this work, we consider only heat engines in which the cycle runs clockwise in the p\u2212 V diagram, i.e., the point (V(\u03d5),P(\u03d5)) on the curve of the cycle moves in the clockwise direction as \u03d5 increases. Note that a similar approach has been used in Ref. [13] for an unconventional lobe in the p\u2212V diagram with an ideal gas and Ref. [14] for a Stirling engine where the volume of the gas is parameterized by the camshaft angle \u03b8. However, the formalism presented below is valid for arbitrary cycles and gases.\nSince dp = p0(dP (\u03d5)/d\u03d5) d\u03d5 and dV = V0(dV (\u03d5)/ d\u03d5) d\u03d5, the exchanged heat in Eq. (3) along the curve is given by\nd\u0304Q = p0 V0 q(\u03d5) d\u03d5 , where (5a)\nq(\u03d5) = CV V0 \u2202T \u2202p \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V dP (\u03d5) d\u03d5 +\n+ ( CV p0 \u2202T \u2202V \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p + T p0 \u2202p \u2202T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 V ) dV (\u03d5) d\u03d5 . (5b)\nNote that to obtain the dimensionless heat function q(\u03d5), it is enough to know the equation of state of the gas, the heat capacity CV and the parametrized curve of the cycle in the p\u2212V diagram. When q(\u03d5) > 0 the system absorbs heat, and when q(\u03d5) < 0 heat is released from the system (according to the usual sign convention for heat transfers and work done). Note that a similar heat function has been introduced by Plischke and Bergersen in Problem 1.5 (see their book and the solution in Refs. [15, 16], respectively).\nIt is convenient to calculate the absorbed and released heat from the function q(\u03d5) by introducing two further functions:\nq\u00b1 = 1\n2 (|q| \u00b1 q) . (6)\n3 Using this definition, if q > 0 then q+ = q and q\u2212 = 0, while for q < 0 we have q+ = 0 and q\u2212 = \u2212q > 0. In a closed cycle, it follows from the first law of thermodynamics that Q+ \u2212 Q\u2212 + W = 0, where Q+ and Q\u2212 (both are positive numbers) are the total heat absorbed and released from the system, respectively, and \u2212W is the work done by the engine (for clockwise direction in the p \u2212 V diagram, W < 0). Using our heat functions q\u00b1(\u03d5) we have\nQ\u00b1 = p0 V0 \u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i q\u00b1(\u03d5) d\u03d5 , (7a)\n|W | = Q+ \u2212Q\u2212 = p0 V0 \u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i q(\u03d5) d\u03d5 . (7b)\nFinally, the thermal efficiency of the heat engine can be written as\n\u03b7 = |W | Q+ =\n\u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i q(\u03d5) d\u03d5\n\u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i q+(\u03d5) d\u03d5 = 2\n1 + \u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i |q(\u03d5)|d\u03d5\n\u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i q(\u03d5) d\u03d5\n \u22121 .\n(8) Equations (5) and (8) are our main results in this work.\nIn principle, to find the parts of the cycle where the heat is absorbed or released by the system, one needs to calculate the points (adiabatic points) where the curves corresponding to adiabatic processes are tangent to the curve of the cycle [13]. However, even for the simple circle-shaped cycle, it is a rather difficult task to determine algebraically or numerically these adiabatic points along the cycle (see, e.g., Ref. [12]). The adiabatic points are the zeros of the heat function q(\u03d5) given by Eq. (5). But determining zeros is not an easy task either.\nThe advantage of our general formalism is that, knowing the heat function q(\u03d5) given by Eq. (5b), the amount of absorbed and released heat can be easily calculated from Eq. (7a), without knowing the location of the adiabatic points. Moreover, the sign of the function q(\u03d5) allows us to find numerically where the heat is absorbed or released from the heat engine.\nAs we shall see below, often the integrals in Eq. (8) can only be evaluated numerically. In these cases, we also calculate the work done directly as\nW = \u2212 \u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i p(\u03d5) dV (\u03d5) = \u2212p0V0 \u03d5f\u222b \u03d5i P(\u03d5) dV (\u03d5) d\u03d5 d\u03d5,\n(9)\nand the numerical precision can be controlled by checking whether the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied. To compute the thermal efficiency from our formalism it is necessary to know the equation of state, the heat capacity and the path on the p \u2212 V diagram. In practical applications these are not necessarily given analytically, but as discrete points. In these cases, the thermal\nefficiency can be approximated using standard numerical methods to compute the derivatives and integrals in Eqs. (5) and (8).\nOur method can also be used to calculate the entropy along the cycle in the p \u2212 V diagram. Using Eq. (5) the change of entropy can be expressed in terms of q as dS = d\u0304Q/T = p0 V0 q(\u03d5) d\u03d5/T (\u03d5)."

(10) we can easily derive the heat function for the standard processes, i.e. the isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, and adiabatic processes, as follows:\n(i) for isobaric process (at dimensionless pressure P0 between dimensionless volumes V1 and V2), V(\u03d5) = V2\u03d5 + V1(1 \u2212 \u03d5),P(\u03d5) = P0, \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 1], the heat function is qp(\u03d5) = \u03b3 \u03b3\u22121P0(V2 \u2212 V1),\n(ii) for isochoric process (at dimensionless volume V0 between dimensionless pressures P1 and P2), V(\u03d5) = V0,P(\u03d5) = P1\u03d5 + P2(1 \u2212 \u03d5), \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 1], the heat function is qV (\u03d5) = 1 \u03b3\u22121V0(P2 \u2212 P1),\n(iii) for isothermal process (at temperature T between dimensionless volumes V1 and V2), V(\u03d5) = \u03d5, P(\u03d5) = nRT/(p0V0 \u03d5), \u03d5 \u2208 [V1,V2], the heat function is qT (\u03d5) = nRT/(p0V0 \u03d5), which means that d\u0304Q = pdV as we expect from the first law of thermodynamics,\n(iv) for adiabatic process from the parameterization V(\u03d5) = \u03d5, P(t) = c/\u03d5\u03b3 (here c is a constant), \u03d5 \u2208 [V1,V2], it follows that q(\u03d5) = 0 for all \u03d5, as it should be.\nFrom the heat function q(\u03d5) we can get the heat transfer Q which agrees with the well-known textbook results, and derive the thermal efficiency of all well-known cycles mentioned in the introduction.\n4"

            "heading": "A. Thermal efficiency of an ellipse in the p\u2212 V diagram",
            "text": "As a first example for applications, we consider a cycle described by an ellipse with axes parallel to the axes in the p\u2212V diagram (for a circular shape see the left panel in Fig. 2). This cycle can be parametrized as\nP = p/p0 = 1 + a cos(\u03d5) and V = V/V0 = 1 + b sin(\u03d5), (11)\nwhere 0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 1. Note that a similar parametrization has been used in Ref. [4]. Then, from Eq. (10) we find\nq(\u03d5) = ab\n\u03b3 \u2212 1\n[ \u03b3 ( 1\na + cos\u03d5\n) cos\u03d5\u2212 ( 1\nb + sin\u03d5\n) sin\u03d5 ] .\n(12)\nNow, it is clear that the thermal efficiency given by Eq. (8) depends only on a, b and \u03b3. In the case of a = b = 1, the circular curve touches the p and V -axes, as shown in Fig. 2 for a mono-atomic gas for which \u03b3 = 5/3.\nAlthough in general the zeros of q(\u03d5) cannot be calculated analytically, for a = b = 1 these zeros can be determined:\n\u03d51 = arctan\n( \u03b3 \u2212 1 + \u221a \u03b32 + 6\u03b3 + 1\n1\u2212 \u03b3 + \u221a \u03b32 + 6\u03b3 + 1\n) , \u03d52 = \u03c0,\n(13a)\n\u03d53 = \u03c0 \u2212 arctan\n( \u03b3 \u2212 1\u2212 \u221a \u03b32 + 6\u03b3 + 1\n\u03b3 \u2212 1 + \u221a \u03b32 + 6\u03b3 + 1\n) , \u03d54 = 3\u03c0\n2 .\n(13b)\nThus, in this case, there are four sign changes in the heat function q(\u03d5), as can be seen in Fig. 2 and is predicted in Ref. [17]. This case is quite unusual because, from our numerical calculation, we found that if the circle is a little bit further off from the p and V -axes, then there are only two adiabatic points.\nFinally, the integrals in Eq. (8) can also be evaluated analytically:\n2\u03c0\u222b 0 q(\u03d5) d\u03d5 = \u03c0 and 2\u03c0\u222b 0 |q(\u03d5)|d\u03d5 = 4 \u03b3 2 + \u03b3 + 1 \u03b32 \u2212 1 ,\n(14)\nand thus for a = b = 1, the thermal efficiency becomes a universal value\n\u03b7 = 2\n1 + 4\u03c0 \u03b32+\u03b3+1 \u03b32\u22121\n. (15)\nTaking a mono-atomic gas with \u03b3 = 5/3 we have \u03b7 = 8\u03c0/(49 + 4\u03c0) \u2248 0.4082. Note that, as long as the ellipse touches the p and V -axis, the thermal efficiency is a universal constant independent of p0 and V0. Of course, this case is nonphysical since the volume and the pressure cannot be zero during the cycle. Therefore, the above universal result can be interpreted only as a limiting case while p\u2192 0 or V \u2192 0 at some points of the cycle.\nNote that using Eqs. (8) and (10) we can easily find that \u03b7 = 0.115 which agrees with that given by Eq. (18) in Ref. [12] for a circular cycle with P = 1.5 + 0.5 cos(\u03d5), V = 1.5 + 0.5 sin(\u03d5), and \u03b3 = 1.4. Another example in which our formalism can be tested is in Ref. [17] where it was shown that, for elliptical cycles the maximum of the thermal efficiency is obtained for a = b = 1, and \u03b7max < 0.3. Indeed, from Eq. (15), for \u03b3 = 1.4, we have \u03b7max = 12\u03c0/(109 + 6\u03c0) \u2248 0.295.\nWe would like to mention that in 2015 in the Rudolf Ortvay Competition in Physics, organized by Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s Lora\u0301nd University problem 8 was related to the thermal efficiency of a circle-shaped cycle as the one discussed here [18]. In this competition, the first author of this paper presented a solution to this problem which served as a basis for the present work."

The left panels show the cycle in the p\u2212 V diagram and the right panels show the corresponding heat function q(\u03d5). The coloring of the lines is the same as in Fig. 2.\nOur next non-trivial example is the cycloid of Ceva [20] which is parametrized by\np p0 \u2261 P = 1 + 1 3 [2 cos (2\u03d5)\u2212 1] cos\u03d5, (17a) V\nV0 \u2261 V = 1 + 1 3 [2 cos (2\u03d5)\u2212 1] sin\u03d5. (17b)\nThe shape of the curve and the corresponding heat function q(\u03d5) are shown in Fig. 3b. For a mono-atomic ideal gas (\u03b3 = 5/3), we find numerically that \u03b7 = 0.1493.\nAs shown by the previous two examples, it is quite clear that our method can be applied to cycles that can be described in polar coordinates.\nFinally, we show that our method can be extended to cycles consisting of straight segments in the p \u2212 V diagram. Any straight segment linking points (VA, pA)\nand (VB , pB) can be parametrized as\np(\u03d5) = pA + (pB \u2212 pA)\u03d5, (18a) V (\u03d5) = VA + (VB \u2212 VA)\u03d5, (18b)\nwhere the parameter is \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 1]. Now, one can choose V0 = VA and p0 = pA in Eq. (4). Then the exchanged heat d\u0304Q from Eq. (5) can be easily calculated to obtain the thermal efficiency.\nUsing the parametrization (18) and our general approach we can reproduce the results found in the literature. We obtain the same result as that of Problem 1.5 in the book by Plischke and Bergersen [15, 16]. Moreover, our calculation leads to the same thermal efficiency \u03b7 = 16/97 \u2248 0.165 for the cycle shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [7]. Similarly, using our formalism, we easily verified the result shown in Fig. 4 of Ref. [10].\nFinally, we use this type of parametrization to calculate the thermal efficiency of the star-shaped cycle shown in Fig. 3c. For a mono-atomic ideal gas (\u03b3 = 5/3), we find numerically that \u03b7 = 0.1453."

            "text": "Our method to calculate the thermal efficiency may be applied not only to the ideal gas but to more realistic ones such as the van der Waals gas. The equation of state proposed first by van der Waals takes into account particle interactions and the finite size of the particle. It is given by(\np+ an2\nV 2\n) (V \u2212 bn) = nRT, (19a)\nU(T, V, n) = CV T \u2212 an2\nV , (19b)\nwhere a > 0 and b > 0 are constants characterizing the interactions and the size of the particles of a given gas.\nIntroducing the dimensionless variables V\u0302 = V/Vc, p\u0302 = p/pc, and T\u0302 = T/Tc the equation of state (19a) can be written in a universal form independent of the parameters of the gas: (\np\u0302+ 3\nV\u0302 2\n)( 3V\u0302 \u2212 1 ) = 8T\u0302 , (20)\nwhere Vc = 3bn, pc = 1 27 a b2 and RTc = 8 27 a b are the volume, pressure and the temperature at the critical point of the van der Waals gas.

Note that for the ideal gas \u0393 = \u03b3 = Cp/CV .\nWe now calculate the thermal efficiency and the heat function q(\u03d5) of the heart-shaped curve defined in Eq. (16) using the van der Waals gas (see Fig. 4). The curve is chosen so that T > Tc is always satisfied throughout the cycle. Using \u0393 \u2248 5/3 calculated from the heat capacity of argon, we get \u03b7 = 0.1396. As it is expected the difference between the monoatomic ideal gas and a more realistic model for argon is very small above the critical temperature."

            "text": "We developed a general formalism to calculate the thermal efficiency of heat engines for arbitrary cycles defined in the p\u2212V diagram. Our method can be applied to all gases provided their equation of state and their heat capacity are known. We derived a general and rather simple expression for the thermal efficiency. To demonstrate how versatile our formalism is, we calculated the thermal efficiency for a few rather non-trivial cycles. Finally, we derived the heat function for the van der Waals gas. A python code for calculating the thermal efficiency of the cycles presented in this work is available in the online supplemental information.\nWe believe that our general formalism provides a convenient and practical method to calculate the thermal efficiency of thermodynamic cycles defined on a p\u2212V diagram, without the need to locate the adiabatic points. Moreover, from a practical point of view, our method can also be applied to model more general cycles, different from the ones usually described in textbooks. We hope that our work can be useful for physics teachers and students to get more insight into the calculation of thermal efficiency."
