Economists modeled self-control problems in decisions of people with the time-inconsistence preferences model. They argued that the source of self-control problems could be uncertainty and temptation. This paper uses an experimental test offered to individuals instantaneous reward and future rewards to measure awareness of self-control problems in a tempting condition and also measure the effect of commitment and flexibility cost on their welfare. The quasi-hyperbolic discounting model with time discount factor and present bias at the same time was used for making a model for measuring awareness and choice reversal conditions. The test showed 66% awareness of self-control (partially naïve behaviors) in individuals. The welfare implication for individuals increased with commitment and flexibility costs. The result can be useful in marketing and policy-making fields design precisely offers for customers and society.We use some temptation method The temptation method for individuals with delays was messaging individuals on social media with a picture of sweets at different times for individuals that didn't want commitment (costly or costless) and people that want to change their decision answered us in that. 5.4 experiment of casari (2009) Casari (2009) has studied the time preferences of 120 subjects recruited from the
undergraduate population of Jaume I University of Castellon, Spain. Each subject faced a series of choices between a smaller-sooner payment (SS) and a larger-later (LL) payment with delays between 2 days and 22 months. Choices were divided into three parts: a first part to measure impatience, a second part to detect choice reversal, and a third part to assess preferences for commitment and flexibility. In Casari’s test reward is pure money and it’s so interesting for us, then we map our model to his data and analysis the result of that. This research just used data from the subject’s that changed decisions along test execution. Also, we considered the observation of his test as subjects. Approximately 82 persons are in the group of people that reversed their choice in his test. The test of Casari has four parts that we used three parts of his test. In part one, each
decision has four parameters: The amount of the two possible payments and their delays. Both payment amounts were held constant throughout the procedure at $100 and $110. The goal of part one was to elicit an approximate measure of impatience 𝐷∗ by fixing the delay of the smaller-sooner payment at 2 days, 𝑆𝑆 = ($100, 2 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠), and varying the delay D of the larger-later payment, 𝐿𝐿 = ($110, 𝐷), up and down until the subject was approaching indifference between the two payments. Part two offered a commitment to subjects for taking option B (LL option with $110 reward) and also give some costly commitment options (cost of commitment was $2). In part three Casari tests individuals with a flexibility option (the cost of the flexibility option was also $2). For mapping data of Casari’s test, we used data from Table1 part of Strict commitment and Flexibility, and Table 6 part of Willingness per day. Table 6 gives information about the D parameter in our test then we used 0-4 days as SS selection and more than it as delay for indifference point. We convert the price of the dollar to our test environment price (Rials) with a convert rate of 20000 Rials for each USD unit. Table1 of his paper give us the result of individual’s choice in various types like costly commitment, costless commitment, and flexibility (Casari 2009).
According to Table 7, among those who had low self-control and were not aware of it, all of subjects have less than 50% aware then we saw choice reversal action between them, also a large percentage of people like before test showed partially naive behavior with low awareness. Small value of ?̂? show less awareness and observed 82 people that small value of ?̂? reversed their choice. The amount of PB in individuals is about 0.8 to 0.95 and preferred 0.88 in average, we calculated values of ?̂? in terms of 0.88 and 0.95. According to Table 8, In individuals, the awareness of self-control on average is 16% with 𝛽 = 0.88 and 41% with 𝛽 = 0.95 and the average discount factor is 1.002 and 0.996. WI of people is 20,000 Rials which is as same as their commitment cost. 7 Conclusion
In this study, the discount rate and the awareness of the self-control problem for each
person are calculated by the hyperbolic discounting model through the experimental test. Subject to information collected from 38 participants, about one-third of them chose SS in all cases in the first stage and the rest of the people preferred LL. The awareness of the selfcontrol problem of individuals varies from 0.16 to 1, of which only two people have a ?̂? equal to 1 (completely sophisticated) and more than half of them have a self-control problem of more than 0.5 and close to one, which indicates high self-awareness. Although most participants fall into this category, only 28% of them want to have a commitment device, and 40% prefer to have flexibility. About 31% of individuals were tempted and preferred sweets at that time. Individuals in this test chose LL for reward value utility 48% respect SS. Also, individuals who demand commitment devices increased their WI about 9% respect SS on average just with payment of commitment devices. In mapping, the model to the Casari’s test (subjects that changed their decision) results showed a low level of awareness to the reverse decision. On average, people become indifferent to the choice of SS and LL in one month in both tests. The results obtained from the second stage of the test to confirm the hyperbolic discounting theory, indicate that people are indifferent to receiving SS and LL by adding one week to the time of receiving the awards but in Casari’s test it was about 50 days. In both tests, 𝛽 was used as an average value but in Casari’s test for checking the result of awareness with the maximum value, we used 0.95, and also again the value of ?̂? was under 0.5 then the performance of the model about predict choice reversal action of subjects was acceptable. Our observations also show that the average minimum discount rate of individuals is 1.027 and we couldn’t show a significant linear relationship between awareness of self-control problem with discount rate and D*. Appendix 1
Proof 1: If utility function is defined as: 𝑈𝑡 = 𝑢0 + 𝛽𝛿𝑢1 + 𝛽𝛿 2𝑢2 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝛿 𝑡𝑢𝑡 and A and B is defined as options we have:
𝐴: 𝑢0 = 0, 𝑢1 = 𝑈𝑆𝑆 , 𝑢2 = 0 𝐵: 𝑢0 = 0, 𝑢1 = 0, 𝑢2 = 𝑈𝐿𝐿
𝑈𝐴 (0) = 𝑢0 + 𝛽𝛿𝑢1 + 𝛽𝛿 2𝑢2 = 0 + 𝛽𝛿𝑈𝑆𝑆 + 0 𝑈𝐵 (0) = 𝑢0 + 𝛽𝛿𝑢1 + 𝛽𝛿 2𝑢2 = 0 + 0 + 𝛽𝛿 2𝑈𝐿𝐿
𝑈𝐴 (1) = 𝑢1 + 𝛽𝛿𝑢2 = 𝑈𝑆𝑆 + 0 𝑈𝐵 (1) = 𝑢1 + 𝛽𝛿𝑢2 = 0 + 𝛽𝛿𝑈𝐿𝐿
Proof 2: 𝑈𝐴 (0) < 𝑈𝐵 (0) and 𝑈𝐴 (1) > 𝑈𝐵 (1) then we can conclude that: 𝛽𝛿𝑈𝑆𝑆 < 𝛽𝛿 2𝑈𝐿𝐿 and 𝑈𝑆𝑆 > 𝛽𝛿𝑈𝐿𝐿 Then 𝑈𝑆𝑆
𝛿 < 𝑈𝐿𝐿 <
𝑈𝑆𝑆 𝛿𝛽
Proof 3: 𝐸(𝑈𝐵 (0) flex ) = ?̂?𝑈𝐴 (0) + (1 − ?̂? )𝑈𝐵 (0)
𝐸(𝑈𝐵 (0) 𝑐 ) − 𝑀 = 𝐸(𝑈𝐵 (0) flex )
This is for maximum M: 𝛽𝛿2𝑈𝐿𝐿 − 𝑉𝑓 − 𝑀 = ?̂?𝑈𝐴 (0) + (1 − ?̂? )𝑈𝐵 (0)
?̂? = 𝑀 + 𝑉𝑓
𝛽𝛿2𝑈𝐿𝐿 − 𝛽𝛿𝑈𝑆𝑆 . ∎
