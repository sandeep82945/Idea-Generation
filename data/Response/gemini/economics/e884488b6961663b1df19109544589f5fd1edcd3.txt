1. **Investigate the effects of climate change on the production of other major crops in China.** This study focused on wheat, but other crops such as rice, maize, and soybeans are also important for food security in China. It would be valuable to conduct similar studies to assess the potential impacts of climate change on these other crops.
2. **Examine the effects of climate change on the production of wheat in other countries.** This study focused on China, but climate change is a global phenomenon that is likely to affect wheat production in other countries as well. It would be valuable to conduct similar studies in other major wheat-producing countries to assess the potential global impacts of climate change on wheat production.
3. **Develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wheat production.** The results of this study suggest that climate change is likely to have a negative impact on wheat production in some regions of China. It is important to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate these negative effects and ensure that China can continue to produce enough wheat to meet its food security needs.
4. **Investigate the effects of climate change on the nutritional quality of wheat.** Climate change is likely to affect the nutritional quality of wheat, as well as its yield. It is important to investigate these effects to ensure that people who rely on wheat as a staple food are getting the nutrients they need.
5. **Develop policies to support sustainable wheat production in the face of climate change.** The results of this study suggest that climate change is likely to pose a significant challenge to wheat production in China. It is important to develop policies to support sustainable wheat production in the face of these challenges and ensure that China can continue to meet its food security needs.
