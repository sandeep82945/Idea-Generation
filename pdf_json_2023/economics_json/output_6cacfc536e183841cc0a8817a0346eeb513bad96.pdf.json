ABSTRACT Objectives Valuebased healthcare (VBHC) is considered the most promising guiding principle for a new generation of health service production. Many countries have attempted to apply VBHC to managerial and clinical decisionmaking. However, implementation remains in its infancy and varies between countries. The objective of the study is to help health systems implement a valuebased approach by building an outcomebased population segmentation model for health authorities (HAs). Design First, we define the principles according to which segmentation models in healthcare could be developed. Second, we merge the theoretical characteristics of outcomes with population segmentation dimensions identified in previous literature and design a flow model that establishes population segments from these combinations. We then estimate the size of the segments based on national register data. Results The population can be divided into 10 different segments based on relevant outcomes, goals and the outcome measurement logic. These segments consist of healthy, help, increased risk, mild curable without risk, mild curable with risk, severe curable without risk, severe curable with risk, single chronic, multimorbid and terminal. The representatives of Finnish HAs found the segments meaningful for evaluating and managing the healthcare system towards improved population health. Conclusions An outcomebased segmentation model for the entire population is needed if an HA wants to steer the healthcare system employing the principles of VBHC. Segmentation should be based on the outcome measurement logic and outcome measurements relevant to each segment and the number of segments has to be limited.",

Published by BMJ.\nBACKGROUND Value- based healthcare (VBHC) is considered the most promising guiding principle for a new generation of health services. Value in healthcare is defined as patientrelevant outcomes per patient- level cost. Thus, a VBHC- based system would shift focus from outputs to outcomes.1 2 There are many attempts worldwide to apply VBHC to\nmanagerial and clinical decision- making, resource allocation, reimbursement schemes and performance measurement. However, implementation remains in its infancy, varying between countries.3\nVBHC originally focused on health service production rather than the health of a population or the performance of a healthcare system. Despite the evident interest in VBHC as a management trend in healthcare organisations, there has been limited research on how VBHC has been adopted at the policy level.4 5 According to Mj\u00e5set et al,3 the VBHC framework functions better in some healthcare systems than others. At the system governance level, VBHC has been focusing on incentivising providers.6\nVBHC best applies to medical conditions for which a clear diagnosis and a corresponding curative process with a definitive endpoint and outcomes exist.2 The question remains how VBHC can be employed for long- term, chronic and multimorbid cases, the primary concern of public health. On average, 33% of the population in different countries has multiple chronic conditions.7\nWe use the term health authority (HA) to refer to an organisation responsible for making health services available to a predefined population. HAs have an interest not only in the value (the costs and outcomes) of services for specific diseases but also in\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The logic of the segmentation model was tested by quantifying the size of the segment. \u21d2 The model was validated in a workshop by health authorities and ministry representatives. \u21d2 The testing of the model is limited to the quantification of segments, and the use of the model in steering requires further research.

In addition to minimising health disparities, the goals of HAs parallel those of VBHC: to maximise health given specific budget allocations. Value is defined as outcomes per cost. However, the calculation of costs is done following a similar logic for any segment, that is, by summing over the costs of all members of the segment over a specified time period. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the outcomes, which are different for different diseases and patient groups.\nApplying VBHC at the level of an HA requires understanding how outcomes should be defined and measured and how outcomes should be used to develop and manage health services. Given that an HA covers an entire population, managing the health of a population requires dividing it into meaningful segments. VBHC has followed the logic of measuring outcomes per diagnosis group.2 However, the approach of segmenting based on standard sets developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM, www. ichom.org) is problematic at the population level since, first, it divides the population into numerous segments; second, multimorbid cases have not been taken into account; third, the segments are not mutually exclusive and fourth, the standard set groups do not cover the whole population.\nTraditionally, segmentation in healthcare has relied on urgency and severity, clinical categories based on organ systems and diseases or diagnostic groups, principal methods, specialisation level and demographic categories.8\u201310 Segmentation models can be divided into expert- based tools and data- driven tools.11\u201314 We further analysed the results of the systematic review of Chong et al11 adding the model developed by Brommels15 to find out potential segmentation models for VBHC at a population level (table 1). Our criteria for the segmentation models were that they cover the whole population and that the segments can be defined ex ante, that is, they are prescriptive. The selected models were analysed based on whether they follow a value- based logic (VBL), whether the segments are mutually exclusive and whether the model is published in a peer- reviewed journal.\nThe selected segmentation models are quite close to each other, but none of them fulfil the criteria for valuebased or outcome- based segmentation. Some of them are inconsistent, separating, for example, elderly care or maternity care. The most problematic issue is that the models follow the VBL only limitedly. The criteria for the VBL were (1) the individuals within each segment must have sufficiently similar expected outcomes measurable in a similar way and (2) each segment must be sufficiently different in terms of outcome goals or measurement logic to justify separate consideration. Sufficient similarity is defined in terms of being able to create one indicator to describe the key outcome of the segment. The explanation may be that the objectives of the previous models12 14\u201317 vary from need- based modelling to the segmentation of care services and thus the objectives differ from VBL.\nOur objective is to develop an outcome- based population segmentation model for HAs, demonstrate the volume of each segment using register data and discuss how an HA can use the model."

We combine a top- down, purpose- driven approach with verification through a bottom- up, empirical validation (figure 1).\nIn the selection of segmentation variables and the development of the segmentation model, we used a methodology similar to Lillrank et al.14 First, the objective of segmentation was defined; second, the segmenting variables were selected and defined; third, the variables were cross- checked for combinations and overlap and, finally, the key questions by which segments are identified were expressed as a flow model.\nThe segmentation model was tested in an expert workshop in June 2019, with invitations sent to the management and development personnel from regional HAs in Finland. In total, 50 participants were divided into six groups, in which participants commented on and developed the segmentation model and outcome goals for each segment.\nOnce the segments were developed based on the selected dimensions, the volume estimates for each segment were calculated. As a case example, we calculated the volumes (proportions) of the segments in the adult (aged 18 and above) population of Finland (4.4 million people) based on national register data from 2018. Finland has a unique Social Security ID as well as national registries for healthcare services, which enables combining individuallevel information between registries to assess reliable population- level analysis. The estimates were based on individual- level data from the national healthcare registers and cause of death registers (The Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare, Statistics Finland). The national healthcare registers included Hilmo and Avohilmo, which include all outpatient visits and inpatient episodes for all public HAs in Finland. The registers include diagnoses for every contact and that information was used to classify the patients into segments.\nTwo additional workshops were held in October 2019 with the management personnel of two Finnish HAs (Keski- Suomi and Pirkanmaa regions). Groups consisted of 10\u201315 individuals, including chief medical officers, directors of nursing, directors of health services and administrative staff members. The purpose of the workshops was to assess the face validity of the segmentation model. The segments were finalised based on the workshops."

Multimorbidity is the presence of several diseases or conditions, often with a cut- off of two or more.21 Multimorbidity is relevant to discern from single chronic conditions because VBHC can be applied to single conditions, but the value in multimorbid conditions requires a different measurement logic.2"

However, to evaluate outcomes, no clear distinction is made between urgent and nonurgent conditions; the expected outcomes can be similar regardless of urgency. Also, many pathways may begin with an urgent need but then evolve similarly to nonurgent pathways.

For an HA, the goals consist of promoting the health of a population and minimising health disparities.26\u201328 In VBHC, the goal is to maximise value for patients, whereby value is defined as patient- relevant health outcomes achieved over a full cycle of care per dollar spent.1 Combining these goals with the general segmentation principles, we define the primary criteria of outcome- based segmentation as follows: \u25ba Segmentation must be relevant in terms of managing health outcomes at the population level. \u25ba The individuals within each segment must have sufficiently similar expected outcomes that are measurable in a similar way. \u25ba Each segment must be sufficiently different in terms of outcome goals or measurement logic to justify separate consideration. \u25ba The identified population segments should include everyone; every person at every point in their life should fit into one of these categories.\nThe goals of VBHC and HAs align to maximise the health of a population within a given budget. Thus, segmentation must begin with the health goals of the population, and the health status of a population is the most relevant segmentation dimension."

            "text": "The health statuses are described in terms of the number of health conditions, the severity of the condition and health behaviour- associated risks. These dimensions affect the goals of the patient groups and are thus important for an HA to consider.\nThe health statuses are first categorised by severity. Healthy people cannot have a severe condition, while terminal cases are always severe. Curable conditions can be separated into mild and severe cases. Care processes for severe, curable conditions follow a disease- specific logic, and outcomes can be measured with diseasespecific metrics, such as those provided in the ICHOM standard sets. For mild, curable conditions (eg, upper respiratory infections), it may not be necessary to have disease- specific measurement sets since such an approach might be too burdensome. For chronic patients, severity can indicate the progression of a chronic condition. In this case, the severity of a disease can also be used as an outcome measure of how well the disease is managed. It is possible, however, that a chronic condition is severe from\nthe outset, which must be considered when defining the outcome goals.\nThe health statuses can further be categorised as single versus multimorbid conditions. For multimorbid patients, it may be impossible to discern the effects of different diseases vis-\u00e0-vis functionality and self- reported health status. Thus, general quality- of- life measurements may be more relevant than disease- specific measurement frameworks. Even though multiple chronic conditions are common in the population, especially in older people,29 outcome measurement studies focusing on multimorbid conditions remain limited.30\nA similar problem also exists if a patient simultaneously has two or more curable conditions. For example, a person can have severe osteoarthritis while simultaneously suffering from a cataract. When following the disease- specific measurement logic of VBHC, the other condition affects the measurement of the individual\u2019s health status and functionality and should somehow be taken into consideration.\nThe last relevant segmentation dimension is health behaviour, which refers to the risk faced by a healthy person of developing a chronic condition or by a chronically ill person of getting another chronic condition. Preventing diseases is an important objective for an HA. In order to achieve this, it is important to follow the development of health risks in a population, many of which relate to the behaviour of individuals. Thus, classifying all groups (excluding terminal) with respect to health risk is relevant for segmentation.\nThe relevant variables are arranged as a flowchart algorithm consisting of consecutive questions that produce mutually exclusive segments, as illustrated in figure 2. The flowchart starts with the most severe condition and moves towards mild conditions and healthy individuals. Patients with severe conditions may also experience mild conditions, such as a multimorbid patient with a curable condition and health risks, although the goals for an HA are determined by the most severe condition. Assessments of health status are limited by what data can be collected from the population based on service use, screening and surveys. This inevitable uncertainty is expressed with the phrase \u2018not that I know of\u2019. Thus, the result of segmentation is never 100% accurate\u2014there are always individuals with diseases that are undiagnosed, as well as individuals with elevated risks of which they themselves or their healthcare providers remain unaware.\nThe first question in the algorithm is: Does the person have a terminal condition? If so, palliative care is in order. Patient- relevant goals are associated with the quality of death, such as its timeliness and peacefulness.31 If the answer to the first question is \u2018not that I know of\u2019, the algorithm advances to the next question.\nIf there is no indication of multiple chronic conditions defined as multiple long- term conditions,32 the algorithm moves to examine the existence of a single chronic condition.

The question \u2018Does the patient have a health- related risk?\u2019 can be asked at any point, since an elevated risk can coexist with any medical condition (excluding a terminal condition). Therefore, the \u2018increased risk\u2019 segment can be divided further: (1) people who have no diagnosis, whereby risk is their only known medical issue and (2) people who have a curable or chronic medical condition but are also at an increased risk (see the definition earlier) for some other chronic condition.\nThe last question is: \u2018Does the person use services without falling into any of the previous segments?\u2019 People\nusing services without a discernible reason are assumed to be seeking help for a perceived problem that has no externally observable manifestation or the need is such that it cannot be fulfilled through the means available within the healthcare system.\nThe exact outcome goals need to be defined in each organisation in order to align with the organisation\u2019s strategy. We have defined examples of outcome goals to illustrate the differences between segments (see table 2). Either the outcome goals or the outcome measurement logic for separate segments differ from each other, indicating that they are meaningful segments for an HA and fulfil the criteria for segmentation. For instance, the measurement logic for severe and mild curable conditions diverges: for severe curable conditions, specific\nFigure 2 Outcome- based segmentation flowchart based on health status and risk.\n(IIT P atna).

BMJ Open 2023;13:e077250. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077250\nOpen access\nmeasurement sets can be employed, but for mild conditions, a simpler approach is justified. The goals for chronic conditions are the same regardless of the number of chronic conditions (single chronic vs multimorbid). However, the measurement logic is different for these groups.\nFirst, an HA needs to determine the size of the population for each segment described in table 2. The size of the segments represents the first means of analysing the health of the population. At a system level, the objective is to prevent people from having multimorbid or chronic conditions and to keep people in the healthy segment as long as possible. Thus, changes in the proportions of segments can be used to assess the performance of the healthcare system and to manage the system.\nFirst, the volume of terminal conditions was estimated through cause- of- death statistics from Statistics Finland. We excluded acute and trauma- based causes of death as they often do not imply a terminal condition as defined in this model and considered only classes of malignant tumours, neurological causes other than strokes and cardiac conditions other than ischaemic heart disease.\nSecond, the number of chronic patients was defined as the number of patients with an ICD- 10 code or ICPC- 2 code in primary care, implying a chronic condition as defined in Calder\u00f3n- Larra\u00f1aga et al.33 Multimorbid conditions were defined as patients having two or more of these chronic conditions and single chronic conditions as having only one.\nThe number of severe cure conditions was defined as patients without chronic conditions who had an inpatient episode in specialist care during 1 year. Mild cure and prevention were defined as the patients who had contact with healthcare services during 2018 but did not belong to the above- mentioned segments. Prevention could not be distinguished from a mild cure based on the information available in our database.\nThe group of people with an increased risk was difficult to estimate based on register data since it did not include data on health behaviour or laboratory test results. Thus, the increased risk group was estimated based on studies by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.34\nThe results of the analysis of segment volumes based on national register data are described in figure 3. The largest segments were multimorbid, with 1.19 million patients (27% of the population) and single chronics, with 1.59 million patients (36% of the population). Based on studies by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare,34 the prevalence of risk factors in the Finnish population ranges from 10% (regular smoking) to 40% (an elevated total cholesterol exceeding 6.5 mmol/L). Such studies do not consider whether individuals with an elevated risk for a specific disease already have another chronic condition or have sought health services for curable conditions. Therefore, it is impossible to say how individuals with an elevated risk are divided among the \u2018healthy\u2019, \u2018curable\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 categories."

The HA needs a systematic segmentation and measurement framework to assess the value of the healthcare system. Many countries have been building outcomes measurement- based disease- specific quality registers, but the problem is that there may be hundreds or thousands of different patient groups, which makes it impossible for HA to get a comprehensive picture of outcomes in the whole population.\nThe VBHC approach best suits single- disease health problems and treatment episodes. Yet, at the system level, the unit of analysis is the individual rather than an episode. Managing a healthcare system requires a topdown approach to segmentation to include everyone; every person at every point in their life should fit into one segment. The VBHC approach has its purpose: measuring outcomes for individual diagnoses or treatments enables comparisons across providers and treatments to support meaningful and actionable choices for patients. Building the measurement logic bottom- up, disease- by- disease helps service providers improve care outcomes for specific patients, but it may not be the best solution for the system- level measurement of outcomes: either you end up with thousands of segments or you run the risk of omitting some individuals. Furthermore, all multimorbid\nFigure 3 Estimated proportions of different segments based on Finnish data 2018. *People with increased risk may be 20%\u201340% of the population, depending on the definition and estimates.

How outcome measurements should be organised in such cases has not been captured in disease- specific measurement systems.\nThe commonly used population- level segmentation model by Lynn et al16 focuses on the descriptive health service needs of a population and is not directly suitable for outcome measurement. The segmentation model of Vuik et al12 divides the population based on observed service use. This offers insights into the different needs of segments (eg, emergency care, home care and specialised care vs primary care), but as such, it is not applicable to defining relevant outcomes for each segment. For example, patients with chronic conditions fall into several segments, and within all segments, there are individuals with no chronic conditions. The other earlier segmentation models14 15 17 are somewhat similar to ours, but they are either data- driven classifications or they don\u2019t divide the population into mutually exclusive groups. Also, neither of their segmentation logic follows VBL and therefore may not support HA in setting goals at the population level.\nMore detailed grouping or segmentation models (senior segmentation algorithm, clinical research groups (CRG), adjusted clinical groups (ACG), etc.) can be used at the service provider level. Based on the validation of our model in the expert groups consisting of regional management, they have too many groups or do not cover the whole population and therefore cannot be used for population- level analysis or management. Also, since they are based on homogenous resource use patterns, they do not follow the logic of homogenous outcome goals. CRGs or ACGs, as well as ICHOM standard sets, can be used for subgroups within the main segments of the model for a more in- depth understanding of patient groups at the service provider level.\nThe challenge for the HA is that it wants to improve the health and well- being of the population, but it has to operate through service providers. Pitk\u00e4nen et al35 demonstrate how the HA can use the population- level outcome- based segmentation model in building governance mechanisms (norms, resource allocations and information sharing) for service providers.\nAdditional studies are required to deliver more accurate estimations of the size of the different segments, particularly the \u2018increased risk\u2019 segment. In this study, only retrospective register data could be used for the rough estimation of segment sizes. As Finland has quite well- developed national registries, the availability of data may limit the benefits of the segmentation model in practice in other environments. In the future, the segment of each person should be recorded in the electronic medical record systems, which would enable the indication of \u2018increased risk\u2019 as well. In addition, the detailed patientrelevant goals and outcomes can be selected and fined down for each segment having patient representatives in the discussions. Also, in the future, it would be important to calculate cost information for each segment and follow changes in the total cost of each segment and cost per\npatient in the segments over time. Dividing the segments into smaller groups based on their relative cost levels may also help focus the HA\u2019s attention on the most critical areas for improvement. Taking costs as a segmenting variable into account may be most relevant for the single chronic and multimorbid segments and partially for the severe curable segment, as the other segments are naturally low- cost treatments.\nThe decision- makers of HAs as well as representatives of ministries participating in the expert workshops found the model useful for steering regional health services.35 They found both segments and outcome goals valuable for steering service provision. The next steps involve measuring the outcomes for each segment based on the goals and logic summarised in table 2 and using the information in decision- making. Although the ultimate goal for the HA is to reach the health goals for the population segments, it can only try to obtain them through the actions of healthcare service providers, who have direct access to the population. What an HA can do is use the health status and outcome information by integrating it into the governance mechanisms for each provider. This includes normative guidance, information sharing and resource allocation principles, as well as reimbursement schemes for providers. Our study is limited to conceptual development and internal feasibility tests and the model requires external validation: how to incorporate outcomebased segmentation into governance mechanisms."

Segmentation should be based on the outcome measurement logic and outcome measurements relevant to each segment, and the number of segments has to be limited to get a comprehensive understanding of the whole population. We proposed a segmentation model that divides the entire population into mutually exclusive segments that differ from each other in terms of outcome measurements and outcome goals. We concretise the model by quantifying the segments. This extension of the VBHC theory supports the implementation of VBHC principles at the healthcare system level, giving knowledge management tools for observing and developing outcomes.\nAuthor affiliations 1Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland 2Nordic Healthcare Group Ltd, Helsinki, Finland 3Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland 4Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland 5Department of Health and Social Management, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland\nAcknowledgements We would like to express our gratitude towards the project team, especially Laura Pitk\u00e4nen, Helena Tolkki and Mikko Valtakari.\nContributors PT: guarantor, conceptualisation, methodology, analysis and writing the original draft; R- LL: guarantor, conceptualisation, methodology, analysis and\n(IIT P atna).
