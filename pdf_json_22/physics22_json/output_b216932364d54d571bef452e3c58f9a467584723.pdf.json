INTRODUCTION\nTransitional flow regime is very frequently encountered in turbomachines and especially in aircraft engines at relatively low Reynolds numbers. As a consequence, a significant part of the flow on the blade surfaces is under the laminar-turbulent transition process. The boundary development, losses, efficiency, and momentum transfer are greatly affected by the laminar-turbulent transition. Therefore, accurate prediction for the transition process is crucial for the design of efficient as well as reliable machines1.\nReynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations remain the most commonly used computational technique for analysis of turbulent flows. There has been considerable effort spent in the past two decades to develop RANS-based transition models for engineering applications to predict various kinds of transitional flows2\u20138. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and by far the correlation-based transition models by Langtry and Menter5,6 have been widely used in engineering industries, in particular, aerospace industry. Most RANS models have adopted the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis, i.e., anisotropy Reynolds stresses are proportional to the mean rate of strain, therefore also referred to as linear eddy viscosity models. It is well known that linear eddy viscosity models are limited due to the restrictions of the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis, in particular, on yielding accurate predictions for complex flow fea-\na)Also at Mechanical and Materials Engineering Department, Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, ON K7L 2V9, Canada. b)https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en/mechanical-and-aerospaceengineering/xiaohua-wu\ntures such as separation-induced transition. Large eddy simulations (LES) or Direct numerical simulations (DNS) provide high-fidelity solution for such problems, but the calculations are often too expensive in computational time and cost, especially for high-Reynolds number flows. Therefore, uncertainty quantification (UQ) for the model form uncertainty is an valuable alternative route for improving the RANS predictive capability in engineering applications. More expensive LES or DNS would only be considered necessary if the model form uncertainty is too large.\nThe current study considers a physics-based approach that has been recently introduced by Emory et al.9, namely eigenspace perturbation method. This framework quantifies the model form uncertainty associated with the linear eddy viscosity model via sequential perturbations in the predicted amplitude (turbulence kinetic energy), shape (eigenvalues), and orientation (eigenvectors) of the anisotropy tensor. This perturbation method for RANS model uncertainty quantification has been applied to analyze and estimate the RANS uncertainty in flow through scramjets10, aircraft nozzle jets, turbomachinery, over stream-lined bodies11, supersonic axisymmetric submerged jet12, and canonical cases of turbulent flows over a backward-facing step13,14. This method has been used for robust design of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine cascades15. In aerospace applications, this method has been used for design optimization under uncertainty16\u201319. In civil engineering applications, this method is being used to design urban canopies20, ensuring the ventilation of enclosed spaces, and used in the wind engineering practice for turbulent bluff body flows21. This perturbation method for RANS model uncertainty quantification has been used in conjunction with Machine Learning algorithms to provide precise estimates of RANS model uncertainty in the presence of data22\u201328. The method is also being used for the creation of probabilistic ar X iv :2 20 7. 07 95\n1v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 1\n6 Ju\nl 2 02\n2\n2 aerodynamic databases, enabling the certification of virtual aircraft designs29,30.\nIn contrast to the data-driven methods, the current approach does not require high-fidelity data as input, hence more generally applicable. A key feature is that most of the application of this perturbation method for RANS model uncertainty have been on fully developed turbulent flows. However, in many aerospace applications flows undergoing transition are important and we require reliable UQ for the RANS predictions for such transitional flows, while few studies of the performance of this UQ methodology in the prediction for RANS transition modeling thus far have been performed. In addition, most studies focused on the performance of the eigenspace perturbation approach on mean velocity profile, skin and/or pressure coefficient, and did not consider the turbulence quantities. The essence for eigenspace perturbation method to perturb the shape of the Reynolds stress tensor is to move a linear-eddyviscosity predicted Reynolds stress anisotropy state to a new location on a barycentric map31. The concept of Reynolds stress anisotropy can be better understood by analyzing the anisotropy trajectories presented on this map. However, very few studies have been performed to analyze anisotropy states for transitional flows.\nThe goal of this paper is therefore to advance the understanding of the performance of the eigenspace perturbation approach for quantifying the model form uncertainty in RANS simulations for two different transitional flow scenarios: flow over a flat plate (zero-pressure gradient) and flow over an SD7003 airfoil. Specifically, the objectives are (1) to quantify the model form uncertainty in three different linear eddy viscosity models (two turbulence models and one transition model) to scrutinize the differences between them; (2) to analyze the anisotropy states for the transitional boundary layer over a SD7003 airfoil based on a widely used RANS transition model and the in-house DNS data32 using both the barycentric and Lumley\u2019s invariant maps33\u201335 ; (3) to explore the performance of the eigenspace perturbation approach on various flow-related QoIs: mean velocity, local wall shear stress and pressure, Reynolds shear stress, and turbulent production rate. The in-house DNS database of32 for the SD7003 configuration is used to support our exploration."

This assumption implies the\nai j tensor is aligned with the \u2329 Si j \u232a\ntensor, which is not true in most circumstances in practice, in particular, complex flows, e.g., strongly swirling flows, flow with significant streamline curvature, and flow with separation and reattachment, and thus a source of the model form uncertainty.\nThe eigenspace perturbation method was first proposed in43,44. To model errors introduced in the model form uncertainty, perturbation is injected into the eigen-decomposed Reynolds stress defined in Eq. 6. The perturbed Reynolds stress are defined as\n\u2329 uiu j \u232a\u2217 = 2k\u2217 ( 1 3 \u03b4i j + v\u2217inb\u0302 \u2217 nlv \u2217 jl ) , (8)\nwhere k\u2217 = k+\u2206k is the perturbed turbulence kinetic energy, b\u0302\u2217kl is the diagonal matrix of perturbed eigenvalues, and v \u2217 i j is the perturbed eigenvector matrix. Perturbing k is an important component of the eigenspace perturbation framework. In reality, the coefficient of turbulent viscosity in the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis varies between different turbulent flow cases and even between different regions in the same turbulent flow45; however, the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis espouses a universal constant coefficient, which fails to capture the true physics of turbulent flow. According to Mishra and Iaccarino45, perturbations to turbulence kinetic energy spatially vary the coefficient of turbulent viscosity, and in a sense change the original Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis to anisotropy viscosity hypothesis. Thus, turbulence kinetic energy perturbation is important to describe the real behavior of turbulent flow. While few studies addressing the perturbations to turbulence kinetic energy have been conducted, it becomes a valuable future research direction. Eigenvector perturbations rotate the eigenvectors of the anisotropy Reynolds stress tensor with respect to the principal axes of the mean rate of strain. Recall that the eigenvectors of the anisotropy Reynolds stress tensor are forced to align along the principal axes of the mean rate of strain due to the limitations of the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis34. This again violates the true physics of turbulent flow. Consequently, eigenvector perturbations extend the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypoethsis to anisotropy turbulent viscosity hypothesis. Unlike eigenvalue perturbations, which are strictly constrained by realizability. Eigenvector perturbations are more difficult to be physically constrained in a local sense. In the current study, eigenvector perturbations are omitted for brevity. For these reasons, the present study restricts the contribution to eigenvalue perturbations b\u0302\u2217i j. Due to the realizability constraint of the semi-definiteness of \u2329 uiu j \u232a , there are\nthree extreme states of componentiality of \u2329 uiu j \u232a : one component limiting state (1C), which has one non-zero principal\nFIG. 1. Barycentric map.\nfluctuation, i.e., b\u03021c = diag[2/3,\u22121/3,\u22121/3]; two component limiting state (2C), which has two non-zero principal fluctuations of the same intensity, i.e., b\u03022c = diag[1/6,1/6,\u22121/3]; and three component (isotropic) limiting state (3C), which has three non-zero principal fluctuations of the same intensity, i.e., b\u03023c = diag[0,0,0].\nFor eigenvalue perturbations, Pecnik and Iaccarino43 proposed a perturbation approach, which enforces the realizability constraints on \u2329 uiu j \u232a via the barycentric map31, as shown\nin Fig. 1, because the map contains all realizable sates of\u2329 uiu j \u232a . In addition, the b\u03021c, b\u03022c, and b\u03023c limiting states correspond to the three vertices of the barycentric map. Given an arbitrary point x within the barycentric map, any realizable \u2329 uiu j \u232a can be determined by a convex combination of the three vertices xic (limiting states) and \u03bbl as follows:\nx = x1c (\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2)+x2c (2\u03bb2\u22122\u03bb3)+x3c (3\u03bb3 +1) . (9)\nIn order to define the perturbed eigenvalues b\u0302\u2217i j, first determine the location for the Reynolds stress computed by a linear eddy viscosity model and subsequently inject uncertainty by shifting it to a new location on the barycentric map. In Fig. 1, perturbations toward 1c, 2c, and 3c vertices of the barycentric map shift point O to B1c/2c/3c, respectively, which can be written as\nx\u2217B(1c/2c/3c) = xO +\u2206B ( x1c/2c/3c\u2212xB(1c/2c/3c) ) , (10)\nwhere \u2206B is the magnitude of perturbation toward the three vertices. Once the new location is determined, a new set of eigenvalues \u03bbi can be computed from Eq. 9 and to reconstruct bi j, which eventually yields \u2329 uiu j\n\u232a\u2217."

Most previous studies on the model form uncertainty have used the open source OpenFOAM software46 compounded with the Matlab software to decompose and recompose the Reynolds stress tensor, e.g., see14,47. In this study, a new class of the eigenspace perturbation framework written in the 100% OpenFOAM-version of C++ was created and injected in the top level classes in OpenFOAM, which greatly reduces the number of user-defined inputs. This allows the users without much knowledge of the fluid mechanics to use the eigenspace perturbation method in OpenFOAM.\nThe magnitude of perturbation \u2206B and which eigenvalue perturbation (1c,2c,3c) to be performed are specified by the user in the input files located under the \u201cConstant\u201d directory in OpenFOAM, and C++ code with customized OpenFOAM data type is added to the existing code base that conducts the perturbations during the execution of simulations, as shown in Fig. 2. At each control volume (CV), the baseline Reynolds stress tensor is calculated and decomposed into its eigenvalue and eigenvector matrices, which are perturbed using the eigenspace perturbation method as prescribed earlier. The perturbed eigenvalue and eigenvector matrices are then recomposed into a perturbed Reynolds stress tensor for each CV.

The simulation results based on the nonuniform grids of 340 and 60 control volumes in the streamwise and wall-normal direction, respectively. The first grid node in the wall-normal direction was placed at a value of y+ < 1 over the entire plate, and the effect of refining the mesh in the y-direction on the prediction for the skin friction coefficient was much less than 1%. The fluid was assumed to be air, with freestream turbulence intensity of Tu = \u221a 2k/3/U\u221e = 3.3%, where U\u221e represents the freestrem velocity, and kinematic viscosity of \u03bd = 1.5\u00d710\u22125 m2/s.

At the low Reynolds number based on chord length of Rec = 60000, a laminar separation bubble (LSB) is formed on the suction side of the airfoil. Note that the bubble moves upstream as the angle of attack (AoA) increases51. In this study, an 8\u25e6 AoA (nearing stall) was considered. Figure 4 schematically shows that the solution domain is a two-dimensional C-topology grid of 389 (streamwise)\u00d7 280 (wall-normal)\u00d7 1 (spanwise) control volumes, which is comparable to the number of control volumes (768\u00d7 176) used in the numerical study of51.

The transport equations were discretized using finite volume method. The scheme was second order upwind for spatial dicretization of flow quantities, and Gauss linear scheme was used to evaluate the gradients. To deal with unsteady flows, PIMPLE algorithm was adopted for pressurevelocity coupling, which is a combination of PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operator)52 and SIMPLEC50. It should be noted that PIMPLE algorithm can deal with large time steps where the maximum Courant (C) number may consistently be above 1. In this study, the maximum value of C was set consistently equal to 0.6, and the time step was varied automatically in OpenFOAM to achieve the set maximum. In addition, both residuals and distributions of lift and drag coefficients that vary with respect to time (T ) were used to track convergence status. The solution fields were iterated until convergence, which required residuals of turbulence kinetic energy and momentum to drop more than four orders of magnitude, and both lift and drag coefficients leveled out\nwith respect to time. This happened at T \u2248 0.3, which corresponds to a normalized time T \u2217 = TU\u221e/c = 6.75, and similar behavior has been observed by Catalano and Tognaccini51 in their numerical study for a low-Reynolds number flow over a SD7003 airfoil at AoA = 10\u25e6. Sampling began at T = 0.6 (double the time of convergence) and ended at T = 1.4, which required approximately 35000 iterations for all simulations.\nThe fluid was assumed to be air, with freestream turbulence intensity of Tu = 0.03% and kinematic viscosity of \u03bd = 1.5\u00d7 10\u22125 m2/s. Ideally, the value of Tu should be close to zero. From Fig. 4 at the inlet of the domain, the freestream velocity was set equal to 4.5 m/s, which corresponds to Rec = 60000. The chord length was set equal to c = 0.2 m. At the outlet, a zero-gradient boundary condition was implemented for \u3008Ui\u3009 (\u3008U\u3009 for x direction, \u3008V \u3009 for y direction), k, \u03c9 and pressure. At the wall, a no-slip boundary condition was used.\nA grid convergence study of the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM simula-\ntions has been performed to test the influence of the grid resolution on the results. Simulations with three different levels of mesh resolution are summarized in Table I. The refinement was concentrated in the vicinity of the wall where high spatial gradients are present. Negligible difference in the predictions for the skin friction coefficient C f = \u03c4w/0.5\u03c1U2\u221e, where \u03c4w is the wall shear stress, and the pressure coefficient Cp = (p\u2212 p\u221e)/0.5\u03c1U2\u221e, where p is the static pressure and p\u221e is the static pressure in the freestream, were observed among the coarse, medium, and fine meshes. Moreover, only a slight difference in the results based on the coarse mesh and the other two meshes (medium and fine) was observed, i.e., the results based on the medium and fine mesh almost collapsing onto a single curve. In addition, the mean flow (\u3008U\u3009/U\u221e) and turbulence quantities (\u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e) exhibit a slight difference between the coarse mesh and the other two levels (medium and fine), for which the difference was at almost 1%. Therefore, a mesh with 768\u00d7 176 (medium) has been considered sufficiently accurate and used for the simulations hereafter."

Figure 6 magnifies the region close to the leading edge for 0 < x/L < 0.2, which corresponds to 0 < Rex < 2.16\u00d7105 (at the trough). In this region, the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM transition model3,5,40 shows a \u201cbump\u201d next to the wall, giving a lower magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e compared to the SST turbulence model36\u201339, although a lower value of C f is found at the trough shown in Fig. 5. As the bump alters the effective shape of the geometry, we conjecture that an additional \u201cform-induced drag\u201d might be generated, which might explain the reduction in the magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e. However, it is clear that no discernible bump around the leading edge is observed for both the SST36\u201339 and k\u2212 \u03b5 turbulence models41,42, which indicates that both models fail to capture the laminar-turbulent transition process. This confirms the behavior shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the k\u2212\u03b5 turbulence model overall gives a much smaller value of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e than the other two models, which confirms the significantly increased value of C f along the entire flat plate, as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe baseline predictions for the \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profiles at different locations using the three different models are plotted in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7, it is clear that the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM transition model gives the velocity profiles at x = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 (x/c = 0.067, 0.13 and 0.2) lagging behind the ones produced by the SST k\u2212\u03c9 turbulence model. This confirms the behavior observed in Fig. 6, indicating that the effect of wall shear stress of the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model is enhanced in the vicinity of the wall, i.e., the greatest reduction in momentum by the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model. The decrease in momentum\n7\npropagates higher into the boundary layer as the flow proceeds downstream of the leading edge. In the outer region, all of the velocity profiles recover to the freestream value. In addition, the velocity profile produced by the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model begins to lead ahead to the velocity profiles produced by the SST k\u2212\u03c9 and k\u2212 \u03b5 models. This reflects that the effect of wall shear stress weakens more quickly for the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model than the SST k\u2212\u03c9 and k\u2212 \u03b5 models. It is interesting to note that the difference between the profiles produced by the SST k\u2212\u03c9 and SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM models becomes smaller as the flow moves further downstream in the turbulent boundary layer. This confirms the behavior shown in Fig. 5, i.e., difference in C f is rather small downstream of the trough. This is due to the fact that in the turbulent region only are the SST k\u2212\u03c9 model formulations triggered in the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model5. On the other hand, the velocity profile produced by the k\u2212\u03b5 model overall lags behind the other two models, indicating the effect of wall shear is rather significant throughout the entire boundary layer, which confirms the behavior shown in Fig. 5."

Figure 8 shows the predictions for C f as a\nfunction of Rex. Also included is the ERCOFTAC experimental data of48 for comparison. In Fig. 8, an \u201cenveloping behavior\u201d with respect to the baseline prediction is observed, and this behavior has been observed by other researchers as well, e.g., see9,11\u201313. In Fig. 8, the simulation\u2019s response to different values of \u2206B varies with which model is being used. For SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM, there are two important observations: first, the uncertainty bound is almost concentrated in the transitional region where the C f profile begins to recover toward the fully turbulent profile. Second, in the recovery region the 1c and 2c perturbations under-predict the baseline prediction (\u2193 C f ), while the 3c perturbation does the opposite (\u2191 C f ); however, in the fully turbulent region it is the complete opposite of the behavior observed in the recovery region. The 1c perturbation shows an tendency to encompass the reference data, which reflects that the increased streamwise stresses contribute to a reduced C f value in the recovery region. The 3c perturbation does the opposite, reflecting isotropic stresses tend to increase the value of C f in the recovery region. It is clear that the eigenvalue perturbations are not sufficient to encompass all the reference data. This might be due to the exclusion of the amplitude and eigenvector perturbation of the Reynolds stress tensor, and the parametric uncertainty introduced in the model coefficients. In addition, the response to \u2206B appears to be linear, i.e., the \u2206B = 1 envelope is twice the envelope of \u2206B = 0.50, which also is twice the envelope of \u2206B = 0.25. With increasing \u2206B, the 1c and 2c perturbations from SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM tend to encompass the experimental data, while the 3c perturbation deviates from the experimental data. For SST k\u2212\u03c9 , the response to \u2206B is relatively small, and the uncertainty bound tends to increase linearly with \u2206B, with 1c and 2c profiles sitting above the baseline prediction while the 3c profile sitting slightly below the baseline prediction. In addition, more experimental data in the turbulent region are encompassed when the value of \u2206B is increased. On the other hand, the k\u2212 \u03b5 model\u2019s response to \u2206B is larger than that for SST k\u2212\u03c9 , and again appears to be linear with \u2206B; however, it is clear that the k\u2212\u03b5 model overall gives much larger predicted value of C f than the experimental data; consequently, no experimental data are encompassed by the uncertainty bound generated from the k\u2212 \u03b5 model. It should be noted that thus far most UQ studies have focused on turbulent flow simulations, from which the 1c and 2c perturbations\n8\nalways increase the value of C f , while the opposite is true for the 3c perturbation, e.g., see12,47,53, which is consistent with the behavior observed with the SST k\u2212\u03c9 and k\u2212\u03b5 turbulence models, as well as the behavior observed in the fully turbulent region with the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM transition model.\n4. Turbulence intensity: 1c, 2c, and 3c (\u2206B = 1)\nFigure 9 shows decaying of Tu in freestream as a function of Rex. Also included is the ERCOFTAC experimental data of48. Figure 9 clearly shows that the baseline predictions for the Tu profiles using SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM3,5,40, SST k\u2212\u03c936\u201339, and k\u2212 \u03b541,42 are almost indistinguishable from each other, indicating a type of similarity. This indicates that the effect of these different linear eddy viscosity models is restricted to the near-wall region, and the flow becomes insensitive to which model is being used in the freestream region far from the wall. In addition, these three models show good agreement with the experimental data, and show little response to the eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c), i.e., negligible uncertainty bounds. This indicates a low level of model form uncertainty in the baseline predictions for Tu decaying in freestream.\n5. Turbulence kinetic energy: 1c, 2c, and 3c (\u2206B = 1)\nFigure 10 shows contours of the turbulence kinetic energy normalized with the freestream velocity squared, k/U2\u221e from the baseline, eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, and 3c) in an xy plane. It is clear that a \u201cbump\u201d again appears close to the leading edge, which is similar to the behavior for SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM shown in Fig. 6. The laminar-turbulent transition happens in the bump, where it tends to induce a lower value of k/U2\u221e. Compared to the baseline prediction, an overall reduction in the magnitude of k/U2\u221e is observed for the 1c and 2c perturbations, while the 3c perturbation does the opposite. In addition, the 1c perturbation increases the bump length more than the 2c perturbation does (bolstering the laminar-\nturbulent transition). On the other hand, the 3c perturbation shortens the bump length (suppressing the laminar-turbulent transition). We note that the 1c and 2c perturbations overall reduced the velocity magnitude during the lamianr-turbulent transition (in the bump), while the 3c perturbation increased the velocity magnitude (perturbed velocity contours are omitted for brevity). Given this, it is interesting to conclude that the size of the transitional region is in a sense inversely related to the mean velocity magnitude under eigenvalue perturbations, e.g., \u2191 transitional region and \u2193 \u3008U\u3009. This suggests that lower local fresstream velocity yields less shear stress, which in turn slows down the progression of transition."

Figure 11 (a) shows a region of nearly constant pressure or a \u201cflat spot\u201d56 that marks the presence of the LSB57,58. The separation, transition and reattachment points are the critical transition parameters that can be approximated with either Cp or C f plot. According to the technique described by Boutilier and Yarusevych59, Fig. 11 (a) shows three \u201ckinks\u201d as representatives of the separation, transition and reattachment points, denoted XS/c, XT/c and XR/c, respectively. From Fig. 11 (b), finding the zeros of the skin friction coefficient is a different technique that can be used to approximate the XS/c, XT/c and XR/c points as well60. Based on the reference data, both techniques showed good agreement with each other, and a summary of these transition parameters is presented in Table II. Overall, the baseline predictions for Tu = 0.03% show better agreement with the reference data than Tu = 0.5%. This is due to the fact that the value of Tu = 0.03% more closely matches that for the reference data, i.e., Tu \u2248 0%. In this study, the LSB is treated to be composed of a \u201cfore\u201d (from XS/c to XT/c) and an \u201caft\u201d (from XT/c to XR/c) portion for the sake of investigation simplicity, followed by a fully turbulent region, as shown in Fig. 11 (c).\nIn Fig. 11 (a), the predictions for Cp with Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5% show good agreement with the ILES data of54, as well as with the in-house DNS32 and LES data of55 at the flat spot (in the fore portion of the LSB), respectively, followed by a discrepancy in the pressure recovery region in the aft portion of the LSB.

After the XR/c point, a \u201ccrest\u201d appears, with C f peaking around the values of 0.003 and 0.005 for Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5%, respectively. Note that the predicted C f profiles sit significantly below the reference data at the crest, and a similar behavior has been observed by other researchers in their numerical studies, e.g., see8,61. There are two interesting observations: first, a shift of the predicted C f profile in the upstream direction is observed for both Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5%, causing a discrepancy in the aft portion of the LSB, and similar behavior has been observed by other researchers as well, see8,51,61; second, increasing freestream turbulence intensity results in earlier transition and reattachment, contributing to a reduction in the LSB length, which is consistent with the observation by Mark et al.62 in their experimental study."

Due to the airfoil curved upper surface, both the mean velocity and Reynolds shear stress profiles are shifted down to the origin of y/c, denoted y/c|o = (y\u2212 yw)/c for sake of better contrast, where yw is the vertical location of the upper surface of the airfoil. The focus of this study is on the model form uncertainty in the LSB, especially the aft portion of the LSB where noticeable discrepancies are prevalent (see Fig. 11). This is consistent with the analysis of Davide et al.63, whose focus was also on the aft portion of the LSB where the unstable shear layer was present with shed vortices. Two locations, i.e., x/c = 0.15 (around XT ) and 0.2 (near XR), in the aft portion of the LSB were selected to investigate the effects of the extreme states of componentiality (1c, 2c, 3c) on both the normalized mean velocity (\u3008U\u3009/U2\u221e) profile and normalized Reynolds shear stress (\u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e) profile. In Figs. 12 (a) and (b), an enveloping behavior with respect to the baseline prediction is observed for both Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5%, in the sense that the 3c perturbation reduces the magnitude of mean velocity profile, while 1c and 2c perturbations do the opposite. In addition, Tu = 0.03% yields velocity profile that is less sensitive to the perturbations than Tu = 0.5%, as shown in Figs. 12 (a) and (b).\n10\nIn Figs. 13 (a) and (b), the enveloping behavior is again observed for Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5%. This time the 3c perturbation gives a larger value of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e, while the 1c and 2c perturbations do the opposite. A similar behavior\n11\nin terms of eigenvalue perturbation to the mean velocity and Reynolds shear stress profiles was observed by Luis et al.14 as well. In addition, comparable sensitivity level to the eigenvalue perturbation is observed for Tu= 0.03% and Tu= 0.5%.\nIn Figs. 14 (a), (b), (c), (d) and 15 (a), (b), (c), (d), the predicted mean velocity normalized by the freestream velocity, and the Reynolds shear stress normalized by the freestream velocity squared, \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e and \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e for uncertainty bounds with \u2206B in 0.25 increments, starting at 0.25 and increasing up to 1, for Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5% and at x/c = 0.15 and x/c = 0.2, respectively, are presented. It is interesting to note that both mean velocity and Reynolds shear stress show approximately linear responses to these increments in \u2206B: a series of linear increases in the size of uncertainty bound with \u2206B is observed. In addition, an enveloping behavior is observed for each value of \u2206B. Overall, it shows that the increase in \u2206B leads to more increased \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e in magnitude compared to \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e. From Figs. 14 (a), (b), (c) and (d), the sensitivity of these uncertainty bounds to \u2206B for Tu = 0.03% is somewhat larger than that for Tu = 0.5%, which is consistent with the behavior shown in Figs. 12 (a) and (b). Physically, increased value of turbulence intensity suppresses the strength of eigenvalue perturbation to the Reynolds stress tensor, therefore resulting in a smaller size of uncertainty bound. In general, the simulation\u2019s response to \u2206B is stronger for \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e than that for \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e. Therefore, it can be concluded that the degree of response to the injection of eigenvalue perturbation depends on which quantities-of-interest (QoIs) are being observed."

            "text": "Essentially, what eigenvalue perturbations do is to shift a baseline Reynolds stress anisotropy state to a new location on the barycentric map. The Reynolds stress anisotropy itself is an abstract concept, as defined in Eq. 5. This concept can be better understood if one considers barycentric map31. Figures 17 (a) - (f) show the baseline predictions for the anisotropy states using the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model at several locations selected along the suction side of the airfoil. Also included are the in-house DNS data32 for comparison. In addition, Lumley\u2019s invariant map33\u201335 as an equivalent of the barycentric map is provided for reference, as shown in Fig. 18. In addition, Fig. 16 shows the visual representations of turbulent fluctuations for the limiting states on the barycentric map and all those colorful objects are representations of the Reynolds stress ellipsoid: edges of the triangle and the three vertices of componentiality ( 1c, 2c, 3c). Among them, 1c (one-component) describes a flow where turbulent fluctuations only exist along one direction, referred to as \u201crod-like\u201d turbulence64; 2c (two-component) describes a flow where turbulent fluctuations exist along two directions, referred to as \u201cpancake-like\u201d turbulence64; and 3c (isotropic) represents turbulence with equal fluctuations along three directions, referred to as \u201cspherical like\u201d turbulence64. All interior states on the barycentric map are smooth transitioning of turbulence between these limiting states.\nFigures 17 (a) - (f) show Boussinesq anisotropy trajectories in a barycentric map from the wall surface (WRANS/DNS) to the outer edge of the boundary layer (OBL) (ORANS/DNS) at several locations along the suction side of the airfoil. In Figs. 17 (a) - (f), red arrow is provided to highlight the turning point where Boussinesq anisotropy state is reversing back toward WRANS, i.e., the 3c vertex. This indicates that the baseline RANS (SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM) predictions for anisotropy state tend to become more isotropic with increasing distance away from the wall. In Figs. 17 (a) - (f), the Boussinesq anisotropy states are clustered around the plane strain line. The behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed by Edeling et al.65 and Simon D et al.47. Note that a simulation will follow the plane strain line if at least one eigenvalue of bi j is zero31, and the Boussinesq anisotropy tensor, see Eq. 5, will give a zero eigenvalue when one of S\u03b1\u03b1 equals zero. Therefore, all two-dimensional simulations will yield anisotropy trajectories along the plane strain when the Bousinessq turbulent viscosity hypothesis is adopted, i.e., b\u0302i j = diag(\u03bb1,0,\u2212\u03bb1). This behavior was also observed by Edeling et al.65 and Simon et al.47. Overall, the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM anisotropy states are more isotropic.\nMore interestingly, DNS yields realistic anisotropy states. For the aft portion of the LSB, Fig. 17 (a) shows that DNS produces turbulence in axisymmetric contraction state at the wall for x/c = 0.015, shifting to an axiymmetric expansion state and then reversing back toward the axisymmetric contraction state at the OBL. Refer to Fig. 16, this indicates that turbulence exhibits an oblate spheroid at the wall, then gradually transitions to a prolate spheroid, and eventually exhibits an oblate spheroid at the OBL. A similar behavior is observed at x/c = 0.2 as well, as shown in Fig. 17 (b). This indicates that the laminar-turbulent transition process tends to suppress the streamwise stresses in the regions both close to the wall and in the outer region of the boundary layer, while fosters the streamwise stresses in between. Within the attached turbulent boundary layer from x/c = 0.3 to 0.6, there is a tendency for turbulence at the wall to shift from the axisymmetric contraction state to the two-component state (wall-normal Reynolds stresses damped out at the wall); while away from the wall turbulence gradually shifts toward the axisymmetric expansion, reflecting increased streamwise stresses. Figures 18 (a) - (f) present anisotropy trajectories in the Lumley\u2019s invariant map, which contain the same information as the barycentric map, except based on a non-linear domain (non-linearity in variables II and III). Overall, same trend is observed using the Lumley\u2019s invariant map; however clusters of anisotropy states appear around the 3c vertex.\nBecause anisotropy states are defined based on \u03bbi, its trajectories do not contain information regarding the physical domain64. This shortcoming is addressed by painting the points based on physical coordinates, as shown in Figs. 19 (a) - (d). Figures 19 (a) - (d) present the anisotropy states for all locations on both the barycentric map and the Lumley\u2019s invariant map, respectively. Overall, the Boussinesq anisotropy states are more isotropic, clustering around the plane strain line, as shown in Figs. 19 (a) and (c). On the other hand, the DNS anisotropy states scatter on both maps, reflecting\n12\na tendency of turbulence shifting from more axisymmetric contraction/two-component (oblate spheroid or pancake-like) to axisymmetric expansion (prolate spheroid) when the distance from the wall is increased, as shown in Figs. 19 (b) and (d).\n13"

In Fig. 20, vortex paring begins at T1, and the coalesced vortices become a single, larger vortex at T2, which significantly increases the boundary layer thickness, and similar behavior has been observed by other researchers63,73 as well. This largescale vortex or coherent structure63 remains near the leading edge, followed by vortex shedding breaking down to turbulence further downstream. Note that this large-scale vortex\n14\nstructure indicates the evolution of a LSB at an early stage. At T3, the turbulence downstream is composed of stochastic small-scale structures, which are smeared out by the unsteady SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model. Compared to the baseline prediction, the 1c perturbation tends to suppress the size of the coherent structure near the leading edge, while the 3c perturbation tends to bolster the size of it, as can be seen at T3."

In Fig. 21, values of Pk appear to be very small, i.e., close to zero, in the vicinity of the wall near the leading edge x/c < 0.15, and in the outer region of the flow as well. This suggests a low level of turbulence is produced in these regions, where mean-flow kinetic energy is more prevalent. From Fig. 21, for all contour plots it clearly shows a peak of Pk found in the dark red region where the LSB is present, and the level of Pk gradually deteriorates downstream. In addition, the 1c perturbation produces a smaller value of Pk than the baseline prediction. On the other hand, the 3c perturbation produces a larger value of Pk than the baseline prediction. This behavior is qualitatively similar to the very recent study of Clara et al.60, which focused on enhancing the turbulent production in the LSB. On the other hand, Pk produced by the 2c perturbation has a comparable magnitude to that for the baseline prediciton, and hence in between the 1c and 3c perturbations."

In this region, a trough of C f appears, reflecting the significantly increased C f in magnitude\n15\nwithin the LSB. In this region, enveloping behavior with respect to the baseline prediction occurs except around the negative peak in the trough, where the 1c perturbation sits slightly below the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation sits somewhat above the baseline prediction. A similar behavior has been observed by Mishra and Iaccarino12 and Iaccarino et al.13 in their UQ study for the canonical case of a turbulent flow over a backward-facing step. Downstream of the peak, the value of C f begins to sharply recover and approaches a value of C f = 0 near XR. In the recovery region, the 1c and 2c perturbations sit above the baseline prediction while the 3c perturbation does the opposite, indicating a reduction of C f for the 1c and 2c perturbations (enhancing \u3008U\u3009), while an increase of C f for the 3c perturbation (suppressing \u3008U\u3009) in the aft portion of the LSB. This is consistent with the behavior of the perturbed C f for T3A with the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model, as shown in Fig. 8. As a consequence, shortening of the LSB length is observed under the 1c and 2c perturbations, which leads to an upstream shift of XR and shows a tendency to approach closer to the reference data. On the other hand, the 3c perturbation shifts the XR point further downstream, resulting in a larger length LSB. A similar behavior has been observed by other researchers in their numerical studies for the canonical case of a turbulent flow over a backward-facing step, e.g., see11\u201313.\nFurther downstream of XR is the attached turbulent boundary layer, where the 1c and 2c perturbations sit consistently above the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation does the opposite but in a less intense manner. In addition, these three eigenvalue perturbations gradually approach the baseline prediction as the flow moves further downstream of\nXR. This indicates that the model form uncertainty becomes smaller as the flow proceeds further downstream, hence an increase in trustworthiness in the baseline prediction. In Figs. 22 (c) and (d), the uncertainty bounds (1c, 2c, 3c) depicted by the gray region are constructed with respect to the baseline prediction. In the fore portion of the LSB, it is clear that negligibly small responses to 1c, 2c and 3c perturbations are observed for the region x/c < 0.15, collapsing onto the baseline prediction and indicating relatively high trustworthiness, i.e., showing relatively good agreement with the in-house DNS32 and ILES/LES data of54,55. However, the size of the uncertainty bounds begins to increase in the aft portion of the LSB (further downstream of XT ). Figure 22 (c) clearly shows that the uncertainty bounds encompass XR based on the in-house DNS and ILES/LES data of54,55 for Tu = 0.03%. On the other hand, an overall shift in the upstream direction is observed for Tu = 0.5%, failing to encompass XR. Downstream of XR, a noticeable discrepancy is observed for both Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5%, and uncertainty bounds are insufficient to encompass the reference data. In addition, the size of the uncertainty bounds for Tu = 0.5% is overall smaller than that for Tu = 0.03%, as shown in 22 (d). The important conclusion is that the simulation\u2019s response to the injection of eigenvalue perturbation varies with the magnitude of initial turbulent condition being used.\nFigures 23 (a) - (c) enlarge the region for the trough to highlight the individual effects of these eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c) for Tu = 0.03%. In the fore portion of the LSB (0.02 < x/c < 0.15), all of the eigenvalue perturbations and the baseline prediction collapse onto a single curve, indicating a low sensitivity to the injection of eigenvalue perturbation and hence low level of model form uncertainty. On the\n16\nother hand, the uncertainty bounds for 1c and 2c sit above the baseline prediction, reflecting a decrease in magnitude, with 2c less strength than 1c, in the aft portion of the LSB (0.15 < x/c < 0.26). This contributes to a reduction of the discrepancy at the crest (the aft portion of the LSB), as shown in Figs. 23 (a) and (b). In contrast to 1c and 2c perturbations, 3c perturbation sits somewhat below the baseline prediction, giving a lower value of C f , while in a weaker strength (smaller size of the uncertainty bound) compared to the 1c and 2c perturbations. Because 3c perturbation retains the isotropic nature of the turbulent viscosity model, it has limited effect on the perturbed results. This explains the smaller size of uncertainty bound generated from the 3c perturbation compared to the 1c and 2c perturbations. Such inefficacy of 3c perturbation has been observed by Emory et al.9 as well. As the result, this increases the discrepancy by deviating away from the reference data."

The in-house DNS32 and ILES/LES data of54 and55 are included for comparison. In Figs. 24 (a) and (b), the region at the flat spot where the laminar-turbulent transition process occurs is enlarged. In this region, the 1c and 2c perturbations lie somewhat above the baseline prediction, with 2c less strength than 1c. On the other hand, the 3c perturbation shows comparable strength with the 1c perturbation, lying below the baseline prediction, as shown in Figs. 24 (a) and (b). Except for the flat spot, all of the profiles show a collapse, indicating a type of similarity.\nIn Figs. 24 (c) and (d), the uncertainty bounds (1c, 2c, 3c) depicted by the gray region are constructed with respect to the baseline prediction, and no discernible uncertainty bounds is observed except at the flat spot, which is within the fore portion of the LSB. In addition, an enveloping behavior with respect to the baseline prediction is observed at the flat spot. This indicates that the model form uncertainty is most prevalent at the flat spot, indicating relatively low trustworthiness in the prediction for Cp. It is interesting to note that the uncertainty bounds for Tu = 0.03% tend to encompass the ILES data of54 at the flat spot, while the uncertainty bounds for Tu = 0.5% tend to encompass the in-house DNS32 and LES data of55. These trends do not happen in the prediction for C f , as shown in Fig. 22. In the aft portion of the LSB, a small discrepancy that marks a lower value of Cp is observed except in the region around XR, where it gives a slightly larger value of Cp. On the other hand, no discernible uncertainty bounds is observed for the rest regions, reflecting a low level of the model form uncertainty and hence relatively high trustworthiness. Overall, the size of the uncertainty bounds for Tu = 0.03% is larger than that for Tu = 0.5%. This again confirms the conclusion drawn previously: the degree of response to the injection of eigenvalue perturbation varies with the magnitude of initial turbulent condition being used. There\nis an important observation: Cp is clearly much less sensitive to the eigenvalue perturbations than C f , as shown in Figs. 22 (c) and (d). The perturbed Cp profiles only deviates from the baseline prediction at the flat spot. This is due to the fact that the wall pressure is determined by the freestream, which is only modified meticulously by the eigenvalue perturbations9.\n17\nFigures 25 (a) - (c) enlarge the region for the flat spot to highlight the individual effects of these eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c) for Tu = 0.03%.

As a result, a tendency for 1c and 2c to approach toward the in-house DNS32 and LES data of55, and 3c to approach closer to the ILES data of55, is observed at the flat spot, as shown in Figs. 25 (a) - (c)."

Moreover, included mean streamlines for the depiction of reverse flow (\u3008U\u3009/U\u221e < 0) clearly show a large recirculating region located upstream in the region near the leading edge. The large recirculating region contains large-temporal-scale events (coherent structures), which are at low-frequency fluctuations due to verylarge scale of unsteadiness of the recirculating region itself74. Consequently, these large-scale coherent structures survive after time-averaging, namely LSB. The contours confirm the behavior observed in the prediction for C f . First, the 1c and 2c perturbations reduce the magnitude of C f in the aft portion of the LSB compared to the baseline prediction, which leads to a lower value of Pk shown in Fig. 21, indicating subdued turbulence. Second, the 3c perturbation does the opposite, i.e., increased magnitude of C f bolstering Pk and hence an increase in turbulence kinetic energy in the aft portion of the LSB. Recall that turbulence is produced through the straining mechanism, ( \u2212 \u2329 uiu j \u232a \u2202 \u3008Ui\u3009 \u2202x j ), i.e., a transfer of kinetic energy from mean flow to turbulence34,35. Therefore, the 1c and 2c perturbations that enhance the streamwise stresses working against the mean flow gradient in a sense of reversal of energy from turbulence to the mean field have redistributed the flow energy in the LSB, while the 3c perturbation enhances the mechanism of transferring kinetic energy from the mean flow to turbulence. Correspondingly, the 1c and 2c perturbations increase the magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e as a compromise to the decrease of the turbulence kinetic energy contained in the LSB, while the 3c perturbation reveals an reduction in the magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e to bolster turbulence. As a result, it can be observed that the size of the region of reverse flow becomes smaller for 1c and 2c compared to the baseline prediction, characterized by a shallower region of streamlines, while 3c gives a larger size of the region of reverse flow, characterized by a broader region of streamlines. As the flow approaches downstream of XR, streamlines for 1c and 2c get closer than that for the baseline prediction, indicating a larger magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e, while streamlines for 3c get thinner, which reflects a smaller magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e, as shown in Fig. 26. In addition, the 2c perturbation yields a magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e in between the 1c and 3c perturbations. In comparison to the baseline predic-\ntion, the in-house DNS data overall show a larger magnitude of \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e in the attached turbulent boundary layer. This is characterized by the densely piled-up streamlines next to the wall, showing similar behavior to the 1c and 2c perturbations. Moreover, a larger region of reverse flow is observed for the in-house DNS data than that for the baseline prediction, and hence a larger recirculating vortex formed, depicted by the mean streamlines. As the height of the LSB produced by inhouse DNS is somewhat increased compared to the baseline prediction, which modifies the effective shape of the SD7003 airfoil56. This might partly explain the discrepancies that appear in the baseline predictions for C f and Cp.\nThe predicted mean \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profiles across the entire boundary layer on the suction side are plotted in Fig. 27. The\n18\nuncertainty bounds generated from the eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c) are depicted by gray regions, as shown in Fig. 27. Also included is the in-house DNS data of32. The boundary layer has separated in the aft portion of the LSB at x/c = 0.15 and 0.2, where the reverse flow close to the wall is visible. At x/c = 0.15, the predicted \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profile shows good agreement with the in-house DNS data for 0.006 < y/c < 0.012 and y/c > 0.021, except in the region next to the wall y/c < 0.006 and far from the wall 0.012 < y/c < 0.021. The response to the injection of eigenvalue perturbation for x/c = 0.15 is negligibly small, and no encompassing of the in-house DNS data is observed. As the flow moves a bit further downstream, the uncertainty bounds tend to encompass the in-house DNS data in the region of reverse flow next to the wall y/c < 0.012, while a growing discrepancy is found gradually away from the wall 0.012 < y/c < 0.027, and no discernible uncertainty bounds is observed above the OBL y/c > 0.027. Further downstream of XR is the attached TBL (from x/c= 0.3 to x/c= 0.6), the recovery to turbulent profile occurs, showing consistent under-predictions for the \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profiles. A similar behavior was observed by Luis et al.61 in their numerical study for a transitional flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil using the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model. This is due to the inaccurate prediction for the period vortical structures that shed downstream. The uncertainty bound reduces in size as the flow proceeds from x/c = 0.3 to x/c = 0.6. The positive values of C f after XR might partly contribute this behavior. Moreover, it should be noted that the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model is inherently incapable of capturing the presence of rotational strains due to the adoption of the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis. However, rotation strains make crucial contributions to the evolution of turbulence. For example, on the cambered SD7003 airfoil the boundary layer growth rate is decreased on the convex surface and increased on the concave surface. However, the eigenspace perturbation method strictly adheres to the extended form of the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity hypothesis, therefore is unable to account for the limitations of rotation and curvature effects45. This might partly explain the insufficient uncertainty bounds to encompass the discrepancies observed in Figs. 23 and 27.\nFigures 28 (a) - (r) expand the near-wall region to highlight the individual effects of eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c) on \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e. At x/c = 0.15, Figs. 28 (a) and (b) show that the 1c and 2c perturbations tend to over-predict the baseline prediction, although very slightly. On the other hand, the 3c perturbation becomes almost indistinguishable from the baseline prediction, as shown in Fig. 28 (c). At x/c = 0.2, the uncertainty bounds generated from the 1c and 2c perturbations are noticeably increased in size, sitting below the baseline prediction. On the other hand, the simulation is less sensitive to the 3c perturbation, yielding a relatively small uncertainty bound that sits above the baseline prediction, as shown in Figs. 28 (d) - (f). From x/c = 0.3 to x/c = 0.6, the flow begins to recover to turbulent profile, the size of the uncertainty bounds generated from the 1c, 2c, and 3c perturbations increases to maximum at x/c = 0.3, followed by a steady decrease further downstream. Overall, it is clear that the 1c and 2c uncertainty bounds over-predict the baseline prediction, showing a ten-\ndency to approach closer to the in-house DNS data, while the 3c uncertainty bound does the opposite. A similar behavior was also observed by Luis et al.14 in their numerical study for a turbulent flow over a backward-facing step. Moreover, it should be noted that the 1c and 2c perturbations react more favorably with the positive C f values in the region downstream of XR than the 3c perturbation, characterized by a rather noticeable decrease in the size of the uncertainty bounds."

Streamlines are included to depict the region of reverse flow, where the LSB is present. From Fig. 29, it is clear that the magnitude of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e is almost zero in the region near the leading edge as well as in the outer region of the flow. A similar behavior was observed by Zhang and Rival75 in their experimental study. Recall that the Reynolds shear stress is dedicated to the contribution of the turbulent production34,35, a low level of turbulence should be produced in these regions. This confirms the behavior observed in the prediction for Pk shown in Fig. 21. In addition, Fig. 29 shows that\u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e contours are everywhere positive, which is consistent with the positive magnitude of turbulent production observed in Fig. 21 (the correlation \u3008u1u2\u3009 is\n19\nalmost always negative when the mean gradient is positive, and vice versa). Likewise, the magnitude of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e reduces as the flow approaches further downstream from the LBS where a peak value of\u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e is found , i.e., bright yellow region for x/c \u223c 0.25. It should be noted that the highest Reynolds shear stress happens around XR, where a high level of momentum transfer due to anisotropy Reynolds stresses is present. A similar behavior was observed in the experimental measurements of Zhang and Rival75 as well. From Fig. 29, the 1c and 2c perturbations under-predict the baseline prediction, with 2c yielding a relatively larger magnitude of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e than that for 1c, while the 3c perturbation over-predicts the baseline prediction. In addition, it clearly shows that the baseline prediction for the \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e contour is prominently reduced in magnitude compared to the inhouse DNS data across the entire suction side. Therefore, the 3c perturbation that increases the magnitude of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e shows a tendency of approaching closer to the in-house DNS data, which is consistent with the behavior of the prediction for Pk shown in Fig. 21. One may notice that the 3c perturbation with the largest turbulent production does not have the reattachment point occur earlier than the 1c perturbation with the least turbulent production. According to Davide et al.63, the overall turbulence kinetic energy can be decomposed into the large-scale coherent (Kelvin-Helmholtz induced) and stochastic (turbulence-induced) contributions. The 1c perturbation suppresses the size of the LSB, during which part of the coherent energy is reversed into the mean flow. On the other hand, the 3c perturbation fosters the large-scale coherent vortex-shedding structures by extracting more energy from the mean flow, which results in large coherent energy stored in these large-scale structures. This might partly explain the anomalous behavior. The similar behavior has been observed by Gianluca et al.13 and Luis et al.14 in their numerical study for a turbulent flow over a backward-facing step.\nThe predicted \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e profiles on the suction side are shown in Figs. 30 (A) and (B). For better sense of virtual reality, the actual locations, denoted a - f , on the suction side of the SD7003 airfoil are used, as shown in Fig. 30 (A). Moreover, Fig. 30 (B) focuses on the effects of eigenvalue perturbations (1c, 2c, 3c) for each location. In Figs. 30 (A) and (B), uncertainty bounds are depicted by gray regions. Figure 30 (A) clearly shows an enveloping behavior with respect to the baseline prediction at each location. An increase in the size of uncertainty bounds is observed as the flow moves from a to b, reaching a maximum at c, which is consistent with the behavior shown in Fig. 27. This indicates that the most model form uncertainty is found in the region downstream of the LSB near XR. While the generated uncertainty bounds are not sufficient to encompass the reference data in the aft portion of the LSB, the reason is partly due to the fact that the eigenspace perturbation method is unable to account for the limitations of rotation and curvature effects, as stated in the previous section. In addition, the excluded amplitude perturbation and eigenvector perturbation of the Reynolds stress tensor and the parametric uncertainty introduced in model coefficients might also lead to the insufficiency in the generated uncertainty bounds. Further downstream from XR, the size of the uncertainty bounds\n20\ngradually reduces, which shows a tendency of encompassing the in-house DNS data, reflecting increased trustworthiness within the attached TBL.\nFigure 30 (B) scrutinizes closely the effects of the 1c, 2c and 3c perturbations at each location. From a- f , it is clear that the 1c and 2c perturbations under-predict the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation does the opposite. This confirms well with the behavior observed in the prediction for Pk, as shown in Fig. 21. This implies that Reynolds shear stress plays a key role in contributing to the turbulent production. At a (in the aft portion of the LSB), the 1c uncertainty bound shows a tendency to approach closer to the in-house DNS data, although a noticeable discrepancy is observed. At b (in the aft portion of the LSB) and c (downstream of the LSB near XR), the 3c perturbation increases the uncertainty bound toward the in-house DNS data, while both the 1c and 2c perturbations increase the uncertainty bounds in an opposite manner, namely, deviating from the in-house DNS data. As the flow proceeds further downstream within the attached turbulent boundary layer, the uncertainty bounds generated from the 1c, 2c and 3c perturbations begin to encompass the in-house DNS data, although discrepancies in the near-wall region as well as in the outer region of the flow are observed. Overall, the model form uncertainty is relatively small within the attached turbulent boundary layer, which indicates more trustworthy results than that for the LSB."

This is consistent with the predictions by8,51,61. When the eigenvalue perturbations to the mean velocity profile and the Reynolds shear stress profile were plotted in the aft portion, an enveloping behavior was observed. It was interesting to note that a series of linear increments in \u2206B led to linear responses in the increasing size of uncertainty bound for both the mean velocity profile and the Reynolds shear stress profile.\nThe anisotropy states of the Reynolds stress tensor were also analyzed using the Lumley\u2019s invariant map and the barycentric map. The Boussinesq anisotropy states based on the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model were clustered around the plane strain line due to the two-dimensional flow condition. On the other hand, the anisotropy states for in-house DNS in the aft portion of the LSB showed an oblate spheroid at the wall, and gradually transitioned to a prolate spheroid with increasing distance from the wall. This revealed that the laminarturbulent transition tended to damp the streamwise stresses in the near-wall region. Downstream of XR in the turbulent boundary layer, anisotropy states shifted from the axisymmetric contraction state to the two-component state. Away from the wall anisotropy states gradually shifed toward the axisymmetric expansion state, indicating increasing streamwsie stresses.\nThe contours of the instantaneous velocity field on the suction side of the SD7003 airfoil were plotted at four different times, i.e., T0 - T3. The LSB structure first originated at T0, and vortex paring began at T1, then coalesced vortices to become a single and larger vortex at T2, followed by vortex shedding breaking down to smaller stochastic small-scale structures at T3 when the LSB moved nearer to the leading edge. The 1c perturbation showed a tendency to suppress the evolution of the LSB, while the 3c perturbation fostered the formation of it instead.\nTurbulent production Pk over the SD7003 airfoil peaked in the LSB, and 1c perturbation gave a lower production compared to the baseline prediction, while the opposite was true for the 3c perturbation. Besides, the 2c perturbation gave comparable magnitude of Pk to the baseline prediction.\n21\nWhen the uncertainty bounds for C f over the airfoil for Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5% were plotted, the 1c and 2c perturbations yielded a smaller magnitude of C f (enhancing \u3008U\u3009) (larger negative value of C f ) than the 3c perturbation (reducing \u3008U\u3009) in the trough (aft portion of the LSB). This behavior is qualitatively similar to the UQ analysis for C f for a turbulent flow over a backward-facing step13. In addition, the 1c and 2c perturbations shifted the XR in the upstream direction, suppressing the LSB length, which showed a tendency to approach closer to the reference data for Tu = 0.03%. While, the 3c perturbation did the opposite. This behavior has been observed by other researchers as well, e.g.,11\u201313. In general, the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model was less sensitive to the eigenvalue perturbations for Tu = 0.5% than Tu = 0.03%. XR for Tu = 0.03% was well captured within the uncertainty bounds.\nThe uncertainty bounds for Cp over the airfoil for Tu = 0.03% and Tu = 0.5% were also analyzed. The model form uncertainty was most prevalent at the flat spot (fore portion of the LSB) as well as in the region around XR (aft portion of the LSB), with the 1c and 2c perturbations giving a larger value of Cp than the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation did the opposite, hence an enveloping behavior was observed. On the other hand, no discernible uncertainty bounds were observed for the rest regions, indicating a low level of the model form uncertainty. Overall, the size of the uncertainty bounds for Tu = 0.03% was larger than that for Tu = 0.5%.\nThe contours of the dimensionless mean velocity \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e over the airfoil for Tu = 0.03% were plotted in an xy plane, a large recirculating region was found in the region of reverse flow (\u3008U\u3009/U\u221e < 0). The size of reverse flow became smaller under the 1c and 2c perturbations, while the 3c perturbation bolstered the region of reverse flow. The dimensionless mean velocity \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profiles across the suction side of the airfoil were also plotted in shifted coordinates y/c|o, the lower sections of the \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e profile in the aft portion of the LSB showed relatively good agreement with the in-house DNS data32. The size of uncertainty bounds was negligible at XT , then reached its maximum near XR. Downstream of XR, \u3008U\u3009/U\u221e increased in magnitude under the 1c and 2c perturbations compared to the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation did the opposite. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed by Luis et al.14.\nThe contours of the dimensionless Reynolds shear stress \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e over the airfoil for Tu = 0.03% were plotted in an xy plane, a peak appeared around the LSB. The 1c perturbation under-predicted the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation increased the magnitude of \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e, showing a tendency to approach closer to the in-house DNS data. The predicted \u2212\u3008u1u2\u3009/U2\u221e profiles were also plotted based on the actual locations on the suction side of the airfoil, and an enveloping behavior with respect to the baseline prediction was observed. The size of uncertainty bounds increased to its maximum near XR, followed by a smooth reduction as the flow proceeded downstream of XR. Overall, the 1c and 2c perturbations under-predicted the baseline prediction, while the 3c perturbation did the opposite. Downstream of XR in the attached turbulent boundary layer, uncertainty bounds generated from the 1c, 2c, and 3c perturbations began to encompass\nnear-wall sections of the in-house DNS profiles. Overall, the eigenspace perturbation framework was effective in constructing uncertainty bounds for a variety of QoIs. Future work will focus on perturbation to the amplitude of Reynolds stress and the eigenvectors of the Reynolds stresses to complete the full range of the model form uncertainty in the SST k\u2212\u03c9 LM model. Also a wider range of RANS-based transition models will be tested using the eigenspace perturbation framework."
