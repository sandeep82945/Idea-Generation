    "abstractText": "This research presents an approach based on artificial intelligence techniques for wheel polygonization detection. The proposed methodology is tested with dynamic responses induced on the track by passing a Laagrss-type rail vehicle. The dynamic response is attained considering the application of a train-track interaction model that simulates the passage of the train over a set of accelerometers installed on the rail and sleepers. This study, which considers an unsupervised methodology, aims to compare the performance of two feature extraction techniques, namely the Autoregressive Exogenous (ARX) model and Continuous Wavelets Transform (CWT). The extracted features are then submitted to data normalization considering the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to suppress environmental and operational effects. Next to data normalization, data fusion using Mahalanobis distance is performed to enhance the sensitivity to the recognition of defective wheels. Finally, an outlier analysis is employed to distinguish a healthy wheel from a defective one. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the influence of the number of sensors and their location on the accuracy of the wheel defect detection system.",

            "text": "Since its emergence, rail transport has been preponderant in developing societies\u2019 living conditions. It is an effective and efficient transportation system for both passengers and goods, for small and large amounts of cargo, as well as for short and long distances [1]. In an increasingly interconnected world, there is a need to continuously update and expand these systems. Moreover, the significant increase in traffic speeds imposes a greater dynamic load on structures [2\u20134]. In this sense, it is essential to implement methodologies for monitoring existing infrastructures and vehicles to assess current safety conditions and limitations [5,6], as well as for the detection of failures or defects at an early stage and, consequently, minimizing damage [5,7,8]. Condition monitoring systems are commonly referred to as wayside and on-board systems, distinguishing them based on the location of the measuring devices, both on the track and the vehicle. Installing sensors on in-use vehicles is useful for monitoring track component failures. For vehicle defects, it is common to adopt trackside embedded systems [9]. Vehicle damage detection methodologies are mainly focused on detecting damage on wheelsets and bogie components, as they have a greater impact on vehicle performance and represent the highest percentage of maintenance costs [6]. The application of sensors on the track allows the extraction of significant amounts of data referring to all the operating vehicles, thus enabling the methodology to monitor various vehicles with a reduced number of sensors. Langneb\u00e4ck [1] pointed out that systems applied to vehicles for detecting damage on the vehicle components are quite expensive,\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23042188 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 2 of 25\nsince sensors are required in all vehicles. Therefore, this method becomes economically infeasible since the costs would be higher than the cost of maintenance or repair caused by the damage to be identified. In addition, the substantial number of existing vehicles represents a significant challenge in terms of the organization and maintenance of the technology for detecting damage in each of them. In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to study a wider range of vehicles. In a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role. At this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions [1]. Although these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents [10,11], causing interruptions in the normal operation of railway transport systems and considerably reducing their reliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and track, increasing maintenance costs. Furthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces [12]. Although a polygonized wheel generates fewer effects on the track compared to a wheel flat [13], this defect may cause serious damage to the track and the vehicle due to the excitation promoted by this phenomenon. It also increases noise emissions inside and outside the vehicle, and decreases comfort levels and railway safety [9]. Moreover, depending on the characteristics of the vehicles and the number of wavelengths of the polygonal defect of the wheel, the vibration frequencies caused by the defect can induce resonance effects in the wheelsets increasing the vibration on these components [13,14]. In the last two decades, polygonization in wheels has been the subject of great interest in the scientific community. Johansson and Andersson [15] used a mathematical model to predict polygonal wear on train wheels with harmonics of 1\u201320. In the research study by Cai et al. [16], the mechanism of polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng [17], the mechanisms of OOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models. Considering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15\u201317] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it is not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades, but rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to motivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in recent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems [18]. Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different types of wheel defects, such as polygonization wheels. Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it is important to improve safety and reduce operating costs by identifying a defective wheel at an early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirp mode decomposition techniques are common approaches used with satisfactory detection results, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19\u201321]. On the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using wayside track monitoring and automatic damage classification methodologies based on machine learning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections [16,22]. This type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extraction\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 3 of 25\nusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modeling with the application of normalization techniques to reduce the effects of environmental and operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carried out concerning the automatic detection of wheel imperfections are mostly dedicated to identifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, it is important that monitoring systems can cover the detection and classification of a more comprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire perimeter of the wheel, such as polygonization. Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series data into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed. Symbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15\u201317], principal component analysis (PCA) [23,24], and autoregressive models [15\u201317] are examples of effective techniques for extracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive models have been widely used due to their easy computational implementation and solely relying on the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data and CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so normally, they are used in offline analysis applications. For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding (NPE) [25], neural networks [26], Mahalanobis distance [27], manifold learning methods [28], and kernel-based methods [29], have been recently employed. This data fusion aims to reduce the volume of the extracted features by persevering the most relevant information. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis distance is widely used [30]. Recent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one [9,31]. Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means [15], self-organizing maps (SOM) [32], and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers [33] and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers [34]. This work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on autoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) to analyze the influence of the number of sensors and their location on the accuracy of the wheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature modeling, (iv) data fusion, and (v) feature discrimination. The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamic vehicle-track interaction were considered in view of a simulation based on real operational conditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken. In more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibration frequencies are more stable provides a more favorable environment for the success of the methodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on a\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 4 of 25\nstraight stretch of the track less subject to large variations in vibration frequencies when traffic passes. After defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid false alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As a final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel from a defective one. It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. [16,22], who demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward in terms of the proposed methodology\u2019s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation for real-world application."

The performance of each technique is studied and compared to obtain the result most sensitive to wheel polygonization.\n2.1.1. ARX Model\nYang and Makis [36] present a method based on ARX parameters capable of detecting the occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same point and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the following equation:\nxj = ma\n\u2211 i=1\naixj\u2212i + mb\n\u2211 k=1 bkyj\u2212k + \u03b5 j (1)\nwhere xj, yj, and \u03b5 j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j. Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and input data. Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize to other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques [18,37]. Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimated statistical model that is determined by the following function:\nAIC = Nt ln \u03b5 + 2Np . . . , \u03b5 = SSR Nt\n(2)\nwhere Np and Nt are the number of estimated data points and the number of predicted parameters, respectively, and \u03b5 is the average sum-of-square residual (SSR) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the order number with the minimum AIC value."

Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functions\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 6 of 25\ncan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT (T) of the signal x(t) is determined as follows [39]:\nT(a, b) = 1\u221a a \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e x(t)\u03c8\u2217 ( t\u2212 b a ) dt (3)\nwhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and \u03c8\u2217 is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains. After the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed followed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression [17,40]. Based on the p-by-q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determined using the following equation:\nSs = XT (4)\nwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q-by-q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p-by-q is transformed into a k-by-q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k \u00d7 q features are extracted for each sensor and each train passage."

            "text": "The feature modeling process aims to remove the changes in features resulting from environmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, it is challenging to remove EOVs effects from dynamic properties to obtain features that are mostly sensitive to damage [16]. Therefore, implementing a latent variable method, namely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde [41], PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find among sample data in order to create clusters. By considering a m-by-f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of features extracted from sensors (i.e., k \u00d7 q), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss, is obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix (C) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores \u039b, as follows:\nC = T\u039bTT (5)\nwhere, \u039b and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C. The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix \u039b, including the eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in \u039b are the variances of the components of Ss and provide the relative importance of each principal component in the entire dataset variation [30]. It is possible to divide matrix \u039b into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n-components is one of the challenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n-components are discarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% [15,35,42,43]. Once n has been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T\u0302 is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T. Using the following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:\nFPCA = XT\u0302T\u0302T (6)\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 7 of 25\nwhere, FPCA is m-by-f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs.

For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies have used this criterion because of its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data to one DI [15,24,45]. The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance between two points in a feature space containing two or more variables [37]. Furthermore, it considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features. It can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis distance (namely here as DI) is calculated by the following function:\nDI = \u221a (xi \u2212 x)\u00b7C\u22121\u00b7(xi \u2212 x)T (7)\nin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C\u22121, and x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features representing the potential damage is defined by xi. The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the damaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions. Mahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations."

The wheel irregularity level (Lw) values are selected based on the irregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization (Figure 6a) or polygonal damage (Figure 6b). Considering phase angles (\u03c8\u03b8) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0, several wheel irregularities are gene ated by each spectrum. In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied at different scale factors for the irregularity profiles generated with Equation (11) in order to obtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between 0.2 mm and 0.6 mm (a1) and the other between 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm (a2). Figures 7 and 8 show examples of wheel profiles generated for he case of initial polygonization and polygonal damage profiles, respectively. By observing these two figures, the difference in irregularities amplitudes between an initial state of a polygonal wheel with amplitudes around 0.035 mm and a damaged polygonal wheel with amplitudes between 0.2 mm and 1.2 can be observed.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 12 of 25\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 26 (b) Figure 6.

In accordance with UIC loading guidelines [46], different unbalanced loading schemes can be applied to the wagon model where the cargo center of gravity is longitudinally and transversally offset.

By comparing the confide ce boundary (143 passages) with ifferent damage indexes (173 passages), Figure 17 illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for distinguishing undamaged from damaged scenarios. The results are evaluated for a set of eight sensors (four on each side) located on the rail at mid-span between the sleepers. They show that the methodology can successfully detect all damage scenarios without any false positives or negatives using the CWT technique for feature extraction (Figure 17b). On the other hand, when the input signal is evaluated by the ARX method, two false positives are observed. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors leads to a slightly less efficient polygonized wheel detection.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 20 of 25 Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 22 of 27\nFigure 17.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations.

As a result of this study, the following main achievements have been made:\ni. the proposed methodology is robust and cost-effective for detecting wheel defects under real-world conditions. A healthy wheel can be distinguished from a polygonized one, regardless of the rail irregularities, train speed, and train loading;\nSensors 2023, 23, 2188 23 of 25\nii. the methodology can successfully detect all damage scenarios without any false positives or negatives when the input signals are evaluated using a CWT technique as a feature extraction; when considering the ARX model in the feature extraction, some false positive detections can be observed, which allows concluding that the use of this technique leads to a slightly less efficient polygonized wheel detection; iii. the system is always able to detect polygonized wheels despite the location of sensors in the track (rail or sleeper), which is a significant advantage regarding the installation process; iv. the proposed methodology offers advantages over previous ones [57,59], as only two sensors are sufficient to detect a polygonized wheel, reducing installation costs and allowing a simpler and more straightforward implementation.\nIn summary, the achieved results demonstrate the high potential of this innovative application of data mining in the railway industry, especially for infrastructure managers. As for future developments, the proposed methodology will be validated through field trials based on on-site measurements. Furthermore, the robustness and efficiency of the methodology under distinct track environments, particularly in the presence of bridges, tunnels and other under passing structures, will be evaluated.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.G. and R.S.; Methodology, A.M.
