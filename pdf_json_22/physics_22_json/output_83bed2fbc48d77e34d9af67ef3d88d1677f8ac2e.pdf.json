    "abstractText": "This paper investigates wireless communications based on a new antenna array architecture, termed modular extremely large-scale array (XL-array), where an extremely large number of antenna elements are regularly arranged on a common platform in a modular manner. Each module consists of a flexible/moderate number of antenna elements, and different modules are separated with an intermodule spacing that is typically much larger than the inter-element spacing/signal wavelength for ease of deployment. By properly modelling the variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across different array modules/elements, we develop the new channel model and analyze the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the modular XL-array based communications. Under the practical non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model, the closed-form expression of the maximum achievable SNR is derived in terms of key geometric parameters, including the total planar array size, module separation distances along each dimension, as well as the user\u2019s location in the three-dimensional (3D) space. Besides, the asymptotic SNR scaling laws are revealed as the number of modules along different dimensions goes to infinity. Moreover, we show that our developed near-field modelling and performance analysis include the existing ones for the collocated XL-array, the far-field uniform plane wave (UPW) This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China with Grant number 2019YFB1803400, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant numbers 62071114 and 61041104, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under grant numbers 3204002004A2 and 2242022k30005.

INTRODUCTION\nAs a key enabling technology for spectral-efficient communications, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been realized in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks [1]\u2013[3]. To support the ambitious goals of 6G, such as ultra-high throughput, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high reliability [4]\u2013[6], several promising transmission technologies have been studied, including extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) [3], [7]\u2013[10], Terahertz communication [11], [12], large intelligent surface (LIS) [13], [14], and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) [15]\u2013[17]. In particular, XL-MIMO that dramatically boosts antenna numbers and physical size beyond the current massive MIMO systems is expected to be able to significantly increase the system spectral efficiency and spatial resolution, which has attracted fast-growing attention recently. Besides XL-MIMO, other terms have also been used in the literature to refer to this technology, such as extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) [3], extremely large aperture massive MIMO (xMaMIMO) [10], and ultramassive MIMO (UM-MIMO) [11].\nAs the number of antennas keeps increasing, there are in general two MIMO architectures to accommodate the physically and electrically large antenna array, namely collocated extremely large-scale array (XL-array) [7], [18] and distributed antenna system (DAS) [3], [19]. For collocated XL-array architecture, the antenna elements are arranged regularly on a common platform with adjacent elements typically separated by the wavelength scale, like standard antenna arrays. When the antenna size becomes large and/or the link distance is small, the conventional uniform plane wave (UPW) based channel model is no longer valid for XL-array communications [13], [18]. Instead, the more general non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) characteristics should be taken into account to more accurately model the variations of signal amplitude and phase across array elements. Some preliminary efforts along this direction have been made in [7], [9], [20]\u2013[24]. For example, in [7], based on the NUSW model, a collocated\n3 extremely large-scale uniform linear array (XL-ULA) was investigated for the single-user nearfield communication. In [22] and [23], the effect of distance and phase variations across array elements has been revealed for XL-MIMO channel estimation. By taking into consideration the variations of signal amplitude, projected aperture, and the polarization mismatch, the authors in [24] studied the near-field channel modelling for XL-MIMO communication. Furthermore, in [9], the authors pursued a generic three dimensional (3D) channel modelling that takes into account both elevation and azimuth angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD) for collocated extremely large-scale uniform planar array (XL-UPA) communication. However, since the conventional collocated XL-array architecture in [7], [9], [12], [22]\u2013[24] requires a contiguous platform for deployment, the array size is typically limited by the available space of the mounting structure in practice [3]. On the other hand, for DAS, the antennas are distributed over a large geographical area with multiple separated sites, which are inter-connected by the backhaul/fronthaul links to perform joint signal processing and provide uniformly good performance ubiquitously [19]. Some representative examples of DAS architecture include network MIMO [25], cloud radio access network (C-RAN) [26] and virtual MIMO [27]. Recently, a novel DAS architecture termed cell-free massive MIMO was proposed, which comprises a large number of distributed access points (APs) to simultaneously serve the users over a wide area [28]\u2013[30]. However, DAS usually requires not only a large number of sites for antenna deployment, but also the high backhaul/fronthaul capacity and sophisticated coordination among different sites [29], [30].\nTo complement the existing collocated XL-array and DAS architectures, in this paper, we investigate a novel modular array architecture to commodate extremely large arrays, termed modular XL-array. As illustrated in Fig. 1, for modular XL-array, the array elements are regularly deployed on a common platform in a modular manner, like Lego-type building blocks [31], [32]. Each module consists of a flexible/moderate number of array elements, and different modules are separated by an inter-module spacing that is typically much larger than the interelement spacing/signal wavelength, so as to enable conformal capability with the actual mounting structure. For example, modular XL-array can be embedded into facades of office buildings, airports, shopping malls, etc., where different modules are separated by windows. Note that the modular design can also be directly extended to IRS/RIS, where high passive beamforming gain usually requires extremely large-scale surface aperture [33]. Compared to the collocated XL-array architecture, modular XL-array is more flexible for deployment. Furthermore, it may also help to improve the communication coverage, especially for cell-edge users [31]. Note that to support\nthe large-scale deployment of modular XL-array, existing cost-effective array techniques can be employed, such as analog beamforming, hybrid analog/digital beamforming, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), etc. On the other hand, compared to DAS architecture, modular XL-array may achieve joint signal processing without having to perform sophisticated inter-site signal exchange or coordination, which may ease the requirement of synchronization and reduce hardware cost associated with the backhaul/fronthaul links for DAS [32]. Furthermore, as different modules of modular XL-array share a common site, it may ease the complex network planning and site selection. However, it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned three array architectures may fit for different application scenarios. For example, collocated and modular XL-array may be used for supporting cellular hot spot, while DAS is a good candidate for providing uniformly good services everywhere over a relatively large area [3], [32]. Therefore, the three array architectures are expected to be complementary to each other, and their choices are dependent on the practical scenarios.\nThe modular concept for antenna arrays was first introduced in the antenna design community [34]\u2013[36]. In [34], a microstrip antenna array was designed via a modular approach, where multiple antenna modules make up a large array to achieve higher gain. In [35], a modular design of phased array antenna was exploited to reduce the array size and achieve conformal capability. In [36], a ring concentric antenna array that is composed of circular rotatable subarrays was designed in a modular manner, which is practically economic. However, all the aforementioned works mainly focused on the antenna designs instead of their communication\n5 channel modelling and performance. To fill this gap, modular massive MIMO (mmMIMO) system was studied in [37], where modules each with a few antennas were utilized to construct a large full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) system. In [38], the authors presented a flexible modular architecture that accommodates multiple antennas connected by a node, and further analysed its distributed computation complexity. By considering mmMIMO architecture with distributed antenna modules, the authors in [31] showed that the average throughput for multi-user systems could be improved than the conventional FD-MIMO. In our previous work [32], we investigated wireless communications with modular XL-array, for which near-field NUSW channel model was developed, and the closed-form expression for the maximal achievable SNR was derived. However, this work only focused on one-dimensional (1D) modular XL-ULA architecture.\nIn this work, we extend our previous study on 1D modular XL-ULA [32] to the more general two-dimensional (2D) modular XL-array architecture. By accurately taking into account the variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array elements, a near-field NUSW channel model for 2D modular XL-array is proposed, and the closed-form expression for its achievable SNR is then derived. We show that our developed near-field modelling and performance analysis include those for the existing collocated XL-array and far-field UPW model as special cases. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 First, we present the mathematical model of modular XL-array architecture, for which XL-\narray is arranged in a modular manner, and different modules are separated by distances much larger than the signal wavelength to cater to the actual mounting structure. With the generic near-field NUSW model, a closed-form expression of the maximum achievable SNR with the optimal maximal-ratio combining (MRC) beamforming is derived. The result shows that the achievable SNR depends on the geometric parameters of modular XL-array, including the total planar array size, module separation distances along each dimension and the user\u2019s 3D location. Besides, for the special case with user located on the front of array center, i.e., the positive x-axis, the SNR can also be expressed in terms of the geometric angles formed by the user location and the array, which are termed horizontal angular span and vertical angular span, respectively [7]. \u2022 Next, we show that our newly derived closed-form SNR expression includes the result for the\nconventional collocated XL-array as a special case. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic performance limit of modular XL-array. It is revealed that as the array size increases by adding more modules along each of the two dimensions, the corresponding SNRs approach\nto different upper bounds, which depend on the module spacing and effective aperture. Besides, by considering the special case of the far-field UPW assumption, we show that the corresponding SNR depends on the projected aperture of the total array, which is usually ignored in the existing far-field model. \u2022 Furthermore, to obtain more insights, we consider the special case of 1D modular XL-\nULA architecture. The result shows that the simplified SNR for the modular XL-ULA is governed by geometric angles, called angular span and angular difference [7]. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the importance of near-field NUSW modelling for modular XL-array communications.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the mathematical modelling for modular XL-array. In Section III, the closed-form SNR expression for modular XL-array is derived, and its performance scaling is studied. Next, numerical results are presented in Section IV. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section V.\nNotations: || \u00b7 || represents the Euclidean norm and | \u00b7 | denotes the absolute value of a complex number. The distribution of a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian vector with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix \u03a3 is denoted by CN (0,\u03a3). CM\u00d7N denotes the space of M \u00d7 N complex-valued matrices.\n7 II. SYSTEM MODEL\nAs shown in Fig. 2, we consider a wireless communication system, where a base station (BS) equipped with a modular XL-array communicates with a single-antenna user. For ease of exposition, we assume that each module is of ULA architecture. Without loss of generality, the modular XL-array is placed on the y-z plane and centered at the origin. The total number of modules is N = NyNz, where Ny and Nz are the number of modules along the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. Each ULA module consists of M antenna elements with inter-element spacing denoted by d, which is on the wavelength scale, e.g., d = \u03bb 2 , with \u03bb denoting the signal wavelength. Furthermore, let Dy = Kyd and Dz = Kzd denote the module separations along the y-axis and z-axis, respectively, where Ky \u2265 1 and Kz \u2265 1 are integers. For the special case when Ky = 1 and Kz = 1, the modular array architecture reduces to the conventional collocated UPA architecture [9]. With the above notations, the physical length of each ULA module is thus Le = (M\u22121)d, and the physical dimensions of the modular XL-array along y\u2212axis and z\u2212axis are Ly = Ky(Ny\u2212 1)d and Lz = [K(Nz \u2212 1) + (M \u2212 1)]d, respectively, with K = M +Kz \u2212 1.\nDifferent from the conventional antenna array modelling in which each antenna element is viewed as a sizeless point, we explicitly take the element size into account, which is denoted as \u221a A\u00d7 \u221a A, where \u221a A \u2264 d [9], [24]. The effective aperture of each antenna element is Ae = eA, where 0 < e \u2264 1 denotes the aperture efficiency. Note that for the hypothetical isotropic antenna element, we have Ae = eA = \u03bb 2 4\u03c0 . Denote by \u03be , A d2 \u2264 1 the array occupation ratio, which signifies the fraction of the total area of each module that is occupied by the antenna elements [9].\nFor notational convenience, we assume that Ny, Nz and M are odd numbers. Therefore, the central position of the mth antenna element of module (ny, nz), where ny = 0,\u00b11, ...,\u00b1Ny\u221212 , nz = 0,\u00b11, ...,\u00b1Nz\u221212 , and m = 0,\u00b11, ...,\u00b1 M\u22121 2 , can be written as wny ,nz ,m = [0, yny , znz ,m]T , where yny = nyKyd and znz ,m = nz[Dz + (M \u2212 1)d] +md = (Knz +m)d.\nLet r denote the distance of the user from the center of the modular XL-array, and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]\nand \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0 2 , \u03c0 2 ] denote the zenith and azimuth angles, respectively. Therefore, the user\u2019s location can be written as q = [r\u03a8, r\u03a6, r\u2126]T , with \u03a8 , sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6, \u03a6 , sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6 and \u2126 , cos \u03b8. Hence, the distance between the user and the mth antenna element of module (ny, nz) is expressed as\nrny ,nz ,m = ||q\u2212wny ,nz ,m|| = r \u221a 1\u2212 2m \u2126\u2212 2Knz \u2126\u2212 2Kyny \u03a6 + (m2 +K2n2z + 2Kmnz +K2yn2y) 2, (1)\n8 where we have defined , d r . Note that since antenna separation d is on the wavelength scale, we have 1.\nLet Sny ,nz ,m = [ nyKyd\u2212 \u221a A 2 , nyKyd+ \u221a A 2 ] \u00d7 [ (Knz +m)d\u2212 \u221a A 2 , (Knz +m)d+ \u221a A 2 ] denote the surface region of the mth antenna element of module (ny, nz). We focus on the basic free-space line-of-sight (LoS) propagation, for which the channel power gain between the user and the mth antenna element of module (ny, nz) can be written as [9], [24]\ng\u0304ny ,nz ,m(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u222b Sny,nz,m\n1\n4\u03c0\u2016q\u2212 s\u20162\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Free-space path loss\n(q\u2212 s)T u\u0302x \u2016q\u2212 s\u2016\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nProjection to signal direction\nds, (2)\nwhere u\u0302x denotes the unit vector along the positive x-axis direction that is the normal direction of each array element. In practice, the size of each array element A is on the wavelength scale, and hence the variations of the wave propagation distance ||q \u2212 s|| and signal direction s\u2212q||q\u2212s|| within each element are negligible. Then, we have\n1 4\u03c0\u2016q\u2212 s\u20162 \u2248 1 4\u03c0 \u2225\u2225q\u2212wny ,nz ,m\u2225\u22252 , (q\u2212 s)T u\u0302x \u2016q\u2212 s\u2016 \u2248 ( q\u2212wny ,nz ,m )T u\u0302x \u2016q\u2212wny ,nz ,m\u2016 ,\u2200s \u2208 Sny ,nz ,m.\n(3)\nAs a result, the channel power gain can be expressed as\ngny ,nz ,m(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2248 1 4\u03c0 \u2225\u2225q\u2212wny ,nz ,m\u2225\u22252 eA\n( q\u2212wny ,nz ,m )T u\u0302x\u2225\u2225q\u2212wny ,nz ,m\u2225\u2225\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nElement projected aperture\n= eAr sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6 4\u03c0 \u2225\u2225q\u2212wny ,nz ,m\u2225\u22253\n= e\u03be 2\u03a8 4\u03c0 [ 1\u2212 2m \u2126\u2212 2Knz \u2126\u2212 2Kyny \u03a6 + (m2 +K2n2z + 2Kmnz +K2yn2y) 2 ] 3 2 .\n(4)\nThe array response vector for the user with the distance r and direction (\u03b8, \u03c6), denoted as\na(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2208 C(NM)\u00d71, is expressed as\nany ,nz ,m(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u221a gny ,nz ,m(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)e \u2212j 2\u03c0 \u03bb rny,nz,m . (5)\nWe focus on the uplink communication, while the results can be extended to the downlink\nscenario. The received signal at the BS after antenna beamforming is given by\ny = vHa(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u221a Ps+ vHz, (6)\nwhere v \u2208 C(NM)\u00d71 is the receive beamforming vector with ||v|| = 1, P is the transmit power, s is the transmitted signal of the user, and z denotes the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\n9 that follows the distribution of a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian vector with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix \u03c32INM , denoted as z \u223c CN (0, \u03c32INM).\nTherefore, the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be written as\n\u03b3NUSW = P\u0304 |vHa(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)|2, (7)\nwhere P\u0304 = P \u03c32 is the transmit SNR. With the optimal MRC receive beamforming v\u2217 = a(r,\u03b8,\u03c6)||a(r,\u03b8,\u03c6)|| , the resulting maximum SNR is \u03b3NUSW = P\u0304 ||a(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)||2. After substituting a(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) in (5), the maximum SNR can be written as\n\u03b3NUSW = P\u0304 eA\u03a8\n4\u03c0r2 \u00d7\nNy\u22121 2\u2211\nny=\u2212 Ny\u22121\n2\nNz\u22121 2\u2211\nnz=\u2212Nz\u221212\nM\u22121 2\u2211\nm=\u2212M\u221212\n1[ 1\u2212 2m \u2126\u2212 2Knz \u2126\u2212 2Kyny \u03a6 + (m2 +K2n2z + 2Kmnz +K2yn2y) 2 ] 3 2 .\n(8)\nIII. CLOSED-FORM SNR AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we first derive the closed-form expression for the maximum SNR in (8), and then obtain the simplified SNR result when (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u03c0 2 , 0). We further study the special cases of the derived expression, including the collocated XL-array architecture, asymptotic SNR limit, far-field assumption as well as 1D modular XL-ULA."

This is expected since the interelement spacing d is much smaller than the link distance r, so that the sum form (8) can be well approximated by the integration result (9). Besides, it is observed that the SNR in (9) is also determined by the array occupation ratio of each module e\u03be and the user\u2019s projected distance along x-axis r\u03a8, which account for the impact of effective projected aperture. Furthermore, the terms inside the bracket of (9) indicate the variation of the total planar array size L\u0303y and L\u0303z, and the user\u2019s projected distance to the array r\u03a6 and r\u2126. Moreover, the closed-form expression (9) is applicable for different practical mounting structures by flexibly adjusting the module separation distances Dy and Dz, or the number of modules N and antenna elements in each module M .\n11\nB. Special Case with User Located on x-axis\nTo gain useful insights from the closed-form expression (9), we consider the following special\ncase.\nCorollary 1: When the user is located on the x-axis, i.e., \u03b8 = \u03c0 2 and \u03c6 = 0, the SNR expression\n(9) reduces to\n\u03b3NUSW\n( \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 , \u03c6 = 0\n) =\ne\u03beP\u0304 dr\n\u03c0Dy[Dz + (M \u2212 1)d]\n[ F1 ( L\u0303y 2r , L\u0303z 2r ) \u2212 F1 ( L\u0303y 2r , L\u0302z 2r )] , (10)\nwhere F1(x, y) , arcsinh (\nx\u221a 1+y2\n) + y arctan ( xy\u221a\n1+x2+y2\n) .\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, denote by D1 \u223c D5 the vertices of one quarter of modular XL-array.\nWe have D1D2 = D3D4 = OD5 = L\u0303y 2 , OD1 = D2D5 = L\u0303z2 and D1D4 = D2D3 = L\u0303e. An alternative expression of (10) can be equivalently written as\n\u03b3NUSW\n( \u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 , \u03c6 = 0\n) =\ne\u03beP\u0304 dr\n\u03c0Dy[Dz + (M \u2212 1)d] [arcsinh (tan \u03b72)\n+ tan \u03b22 arctan (tan \u03b22 sin \u03b72)\u2212 arcsinh (tan \u03b71)\u2212 tan \u03b21 arctan (tan \u03b21 sin \u03b71)] , (11)\nwhere \u03b71 = arctan L\u0303y 2\u221a r2+ ( L\u0302z 2 )2 , \u03b72 = arctan L\u0303y 2\u221a r2+ ( L\u0303z 2 )2 , \u03b21 = arctan L\u0302z2r , and \u03b22 = arctan L\u0303z2r . The expression (11) is used to interpret the obtained SNR result in (10) in terms of geometrical relationships. Specifically, the obtained SNR depends on horizontal angular spans, i.e., \u03b71, \u03b72, and vertical angular spans, i.e., \u03b21 and \u03b22. As horizontal angular span \u03b72 or vertical angular span \u03b22 increases, the term arcsinh (tan \u03b72) + tan \u03b22 arctan (tan \u03b22 sin \u03b72) will become large, leading to the SNR increasing to a higher value. Similarly, the increase of horizontal angular span \u03b71 or vertical angular span \u03b21 will lead to smaller SNR."

The reason behind the phenomenon is that the user\u2019s projected distance along x-axis r\u03a8 is much longer than the array size L\u0303y and L\u0303z, so that the effect of the module separation distances Dy and Dz can be ignored.\nAs a comparison, the SNR under the conventional far-field UPW assumption without consid-\nering the total projected aperture is\n\u03b3UPW = PNyNzM\u03b20\nr2 , (19)\nwhere \u03b20 is the channel gain at the reference distance of r0 = 1 m.

However, such two SNR results \u03b3UPW,1D are independent of the modular separation Dz, due to the UPW assumption that user\u2019s projected distance along x-axis is much longer than the array size, i.e., r\u03a8 L\u0303z.\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nIn this section, numerical results are provided to validate our obtained analytic results for modular XL-array communications. Unless otherwise specified, the number of array elements in each module is M = 9, the transmit SNR is P = 90 dB, the aperture efficiency is e = 1, the carrier frequency is 2.38 GHz, and the inter-element spacing is d = \u03bb 2 = 0.0628 m. Besides, the distance from the user to the center of modular XL-array is r = 25 m, and the number of modules along the y-axis and z-axis are set as Ny = 64 and Nz = 64, respectively. The module separations along the y-axis and z-axis are given by Dy = Dz = 10d = 0.628 m.\nFig. 5(a) shows the SNRs \u03b3NUSW and \u03b3UPW versus the number of total array elements NyNzM , by increasing the number of modules Nz along the z-axis. Note that the direction of the user is given as (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (60\u25e6, 30\u25e6) and the \u201cSNR limit\u201d shown in the figure is obtained by letting Ny, Nz \u2192 \u221e, i.e., (15). As can be seen from Fig. 5(a), the closed-form SNR expression in (9) perfectly matches with the original summation expression in (8), which demonstrates the accuracy of Theorem 1. When the total number of array elements NyNzM is relatively small, both \u03b3NUSW and \u03b3UPW increase linearly with NyNzM , which is consistent with Corollary 4. However, as NyNzM becomes large by increasing Nz, the SNR results based on NUSW and UPW models exhibit two different scaling laws, i.e., approaching to a constant value versus growing linearly unboundedly, which are in accordance with (13) and (18), respectively. It is\n17\nalso observed that the SNR in (19) which ignores the variation of the projected aperture across array elements over-estimates the SNR obtained by (18). Similar to Fig. 5(a), Fig. 5(b) shows the SNRs \u03b3NUSW and \u03b3UPW versus total number of elements NyNzM by increasing the module numbers Ny along the y-axis. It is revealed that similar observations as Fig. 5(a) can be obtained. Moreover, it is also observed from Fig. 5 that the SNR limit of (15) with both Ny and Nz going to infinity is larger than its counterparts when only Ny or Nz grows, as expected.\nFig. 6 plots the SNRs \u03b3NUSW and \u03b3UPW versus zenith angle \u03b8 by fixing the azimuth angle \u03c6 = 30\u25e6. It is observed that for relatively small values of sin \u03b8, e.g., \u03b8 = 10\u25e6 or \u03b8 = 170\u25e6, the SNR under UPW modelling in (18) under-estimates the result in (9), while the reverse is true as sin \u03b8 is large, e.g., \u03b8 = 90\u25e6. It is worth noting that the UPW-based result in (19) without\n18\nconsidering the effect of projected aperture is independent of the user direction \u03b8, since isotropic array elements are assumed.\nFig. 7 plots the SNRs \u03b3NUSW and \u03b3UPW versus the module separation Dy = Dz with two different zenith angles \u03b8 = 30\u25e6 or \u03b8 = 120\u25e6, where the azimuth angle is fixed to \u03c6 = 30\u25e6. The module separation Dy = Dz starting from \u03bb2 corresponds to the conventional collocated array architecture. As shown from Fig. 7, the SNR based on far-field UPW model is independent of Dy and Dz. By contrast, when Dy and Dz are relatively small, the SNRs based on NUSW model for different values of \u03b8 show different trends, while as Dy and Dz increase, the SNRs based on NUSW model for different values of \u03b8 exhibit the general decreasing trends. This illustrates that inter-module separation is an important parameter in the NUSW-based model, which greatly impacts on the system performance.\n19\nFig. 8 plots the SNRs for different architectures versus the total number of array elements by increasing Ny = Nz with two different user directions (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (30\u25e6, 60\u25e6) and (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (45\u25e6, 45\u25e6). It is observed that for the two given user directions, when the physical size of the array is relatively small, the modular and collocated architectures achieve similar SNR performance, while as the array size becomes large, the modular architecture provides slightly better performance than the collocated architecture initially while the opposite result is true when the array size becomes extremely large. It is worth pointing out that the constant SNR difference between collocated architecture and modular architecture is about 12 dB, which matches well with the theoretical result in (16).\nAs a further illustration, Fig. 9 plots the SNRs for different architectures versus the link distance r with two user directions (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (30\u25e6, 60\u25e6) and (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (45\u25e6, 45\u25e6). It is observed that the SNRs for all models generally decrease as the link distance r increases, as expected. It is also observed from Fig. 9 that for the two given user directions, when r is relatively small, the modular architecture has worse SNR performance than the collocated architecture, while as r further increases, the modular architecture outperforms first and then the two models reach similar performance.\nLast, Fig. 10 shows the SNRs \u03b3NUSW,1D and \u03b3UPW,1D versus the total number of array elements NyNzM with Ny = 1 and (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (60\u25e6, 30\u25e6). It is observed from Fig. 10 that for relatively small array element numbers of NzM , both \u03b3NUSW,1D and \u03b3UPW,1D increase linearly with NzM , which is consistent with the result in (23). However, as NzM further increases with Nz, different from the result based on UPW modelling that grows linearly and eventually becomes unbounded,\n20\nthe SNR result under the NUSW model approaches to a constant value. It is also observed that the conventional \u03b3UPW,1D = PNzM\u03b20r2 by ignoring variations of projected aperture across array elements over-estimates the result predicted by the proposed model.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper studied the mathematical modelling and conducted the performance analysis for wireless communications with the modular XL-array, where different array modules are spaced with relatively large separations so as to keep conformal with practical building facades. By taking into account the variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array elements, a generic array model is proposed. With the optimal MRC beamforming at the receiver, the closed-form SNR expression was derived in terms of system geometric parameters, including the total planar array size, module separations, and the user\u2019s 3D location. Besides, the asymptotic SNR scaling laws were obtained as the number of modules along different dimensions goes to infinity. Furthermore, our developed modelling and performance analysis were shown to include the existing SNR results for the collocated XL-array, far-field UPW assumption and 1D modular XL-ULA architecture as special cases. Extensive numerical results were provided to validate the importance of near-field NUSW modelling for accurately characterizing the performance of modular XL-array communications, which was shown to outperform the collocated XL-array for wider coverage due to more flexible array deployment.\n21\nAPPENDIX A\nPROOF OF THEOREM 1\nSimilar to the derivation in [9], by observing the structure of triple summation in (8), we\ndefine the function f(a, b, c) , 1 [1\u22122a\u2126\u22122Kb\u2126\u22122Kyc\u03a6+a2+K2b2+2Kab+K2yc2] 3 2 , which is a continuous function over the domain A = {\n(a, b, c) | \u2212M 2 \u2264 a \u2264 M 2 ,\u2212Nz 2 \u2264 b \u2264 Nz 2 ,\u2212Ny 2 \u2264 c \u2264 Ny 2\n} .\nSince 1, we have f(a, b, c) \u2248 f(m , nz , ny ), \u2200(a, b, c) \u2208 [(m \u2212 12) , (m + 1 2 ) ] \u00d7 [(nz \u2212 1 2 ) , (nz + 1 2 ) ]\u00d7 [(ny \u2212 12) , (ny + 1 2 ) ].
