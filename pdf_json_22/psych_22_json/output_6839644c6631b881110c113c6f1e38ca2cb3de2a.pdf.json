The purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of state anxiety between cyber loafing and the sense of meaning of life, and the moderating role of psychological flexibility in this mediating relationship.\nMethodology: With 964 undergraduates recruited as subjects three-wave-time-lagged quantitative research design was conducted in China. All participants were required to complete a self-reported electronic questionnaire. Then, the mediating mechanism and moderating e ect were explored with utilization of SPSS25.0.\nResults: The results showed that cyberloafing had significant negative correlation with the sense ofmeaning of life. Our analysis testing themediating e ect showed that state anxiety partially mediated the relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life (indirect e ect = \u22120.05, p < 0.01,), while the mediating e ect was 31.25% of the total e ect. Our analysis testing the moderating e ect showed that psychological flexibility significantly moderated the relationship between cyberloafing and state anxiety (interaction e ect = \u22120.26, p < 0.01). And our analysis testing the moderated mediating e ect showed that psychological flexibility played a moderating role in the mediating e ect of state anxiety.\nConclusion: Based on the findings of this study, college students\u2019 cyberloafing negatively a ects their sense of meaning of life. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to supervise and restrict college students\u2019 Internet use and provide them with corresponding guidance; certain psychological adjustment measures should also be taken when necessary to help college students with low psychological flexibility in reducing their state anxiety and improving their sense of meaning of life.\nKEYWORDS\ncollege students, cyberloafing, the sense of meaning of life, psychological flexibility, state anxiety\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "With the leaping development of Internet technology, the widespread use of computers, mobile phones and other devices in the e-learning environment has not only created great convenience for learning, but also prompted college students to enter the era of pan-entertainment. The use of electronic media by college students not for the purpose of learning, in or out of class when completing learning tasks (1, 2) is referred to as cyberloafing in learning. Researchers believe that cyberloafing is a problematic behavior of network use (3), and it has become a prevailing topic in the field of psychological research exploring the impact of this commonly seen network behavior among college students.\nCyberloafing was originally used to describe the phenomenon that employees use the network tools provided by the organization to browse non-work-related websites, sending and receiving personal e-mails, which has an impact on job performance during working hours. Recent research studies on cyberloafing mainly focus on the field of organizational behaviors in firms. However, some studies have revealed that cyberloafing among college students, which has deviated them from learning, is even more serious than that among employees (1). However, empirical studies on college students\u2019 cyberloafing mainly focus on the impact of college students\u2019 cyberloafing on their academic performance and mental health. For example, college students\u2019 cyberloafing could lead to decreased attention toward their academic work and poor performance in learning (4, 5). Also, cyberloafing is negatively correlated with subjective wellbeing (6), which can lead to depression (7). Such studies mainly focus on the outcome variables of cyberloafing, leaving the internal mechanism of this negative impact caused by cyberloafing insufficiently explored. Therefore, this study would provide certain theoretical value and practical significance through expanding the research on the impact of college students\u2019 cyberloafing and revealing related internal mechanisms.\nThe relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life\nCurrent research evidence still show some inconsistencies on the impact caused by cyberloafing. Among these researches, some believe that cyberloafing has a negative impact on both organizations and employees. For example, it is found that cyberloafing will lead to loss of organizational productivity (8) and psychological stress of employees (9); it also triggers negative emotions (10) and reduces job satisfaction among employees (11). Nonetheless, some researchers believe that cyberloafing can promote the recovery of work, temporarily reduce pressure and mental tension brought by work; through\nproviding a feeling of relaxation to employees, cyberloafing can improve employees\u2019 devotion to follow-up work; this is because cyberloafing can further complement important emotional resources for employees and indirectly promotes their efficiency in achieving work tasks (12). Research on college students\u2019 cyberloafing showed that using the Internet in class was related to lower emotional wellbeing, which showed more depression symptoms and higher social anxiety (13). However, some studies have found that students would experience more positive emotions and less negative emotions after participating in cyberloafing (14). Therefore, it is necessary to explore the impact of cyberloafing on individual psychology and behavior.\nThe social displacement hypothesis holds that the use of networkmedia encroaches on people\u2019s time for social interaction and other activities in their daily life and makes it easier for them to fall into depression and suffer alienation, which would eventually reduce individual sense of happiness (15). For college students, cyberloafing takes up a large portion of their time which should have been devoted to learning and consumes certain amount of scarce attention resources (16). The sense of meaning of life is understood as having a strong sense of life purpose, pursuing valuable personal goals, or having a clear value system that can guide one\u2019s actions (17). Internet addiction negatively predicted the sense of meaning of life (18). With the gradual penetration of network media into all fields of people\u2019s life, the relationship between network behavior and the sense of meaning of life is bound to be closer and closer. However, at present, few studies pay attention to the relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life. Therefore, we presume that cyberloafing may create anxiety and trigger confusion as regard to the value and goal of life and learning, and put forward the following hypothesis.\nH1: Cyberloafing significantly and negatively predict the sense of meaning of life.\nThe mediating role of state anxiety\nState anxiety refers to the state of immediate anxiety in a specific scene at present or in a specific period of time (19). When an individual encounters external or internal stimulus (such as thought, psychological needs, etc.), the existence of threat can be felt by his or her body, and the emotion of state anxiety will arise. Researchers have pointed out that cyberloafing will increase employees\u2019 work anxiety, thus depleting their emotional resources and weakening their sense of meaning in work (20). In addition, excessive use of the Internet will have a negative impact on the physical andmental health of individuals, such as the increase of anxiety and depression (13). Previous studies have shown that addiction to social media would have a negative impact on individuals. For example, excessive use of Wechat (a social media platform in China which is equivalent to\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\ntwitter) will also affect teenagers\u2019 physical and mental health, as well as their academic performance (21). According to the stress transactional model of Lazarus and Folkman (22), when people think the events they experience are harmful or threatening, exposure to these pressures will lead to negative physical (such as elevated blood pressure), psychological (anger and anxiety) or behavioral (leaving the status quo) results. According to the research by Becker et al. (13) students who used the Internet in class exhibited more depressive symptoms, higher stress and anxiety. Thus, it can be inferred that college students\u2019 cyberloafing during learning can be regarded as an investment of limited learning resources (such as time and energy) in nonlearning fields. This irrational allocation of learning resources can be problematic, which would lead to increased psychological pressure and anxiety. This transient experience of tension in learning can be very easily changed with variation of the surrounding environment. This is a typical manifestation of psychological distress leading to resource loss (23). Therefore, this study puts forward the following hypothesis.\nH2: Cyberloafing is positively correlated with state anxiety.\nWith occurrence of anxiety in social communication, college students\u2019 perceived subjective wellbeing will also decrease (24). The higher one\u2019s state anxiety level is, the lower one\u2019s sense of wellbeing is, and the sense of wellbeing is positively correlated with the sense of meaning of life (25). In addition, anxiety is a kind of negative emotion. Negative emotional experience increases the risk of anxiety and depression (26), which would diminish their sentiment in the sense of meaning of life (27, 28). Zhang et al. (29) found that there was a significant negative correlation between negative indicators of mental health (such as trait anxiety) and the sense of meaning of life. Individuals with trait anxiety are easily attracted by negative emotional information in the environment, which leads to habitual indulgence in anxiety, resulting in state anxiety, and then in reduced the sense of meaning of life (30). Thus, we propose that cyberloafing will intensify college students\u2019 state anxiety and reduce their sense of meaning of life. Therefore, the following assumptions are put forward.\nH3: State anxiety has a negative impact on the sense of meaning of life. H4: State anxiety mediates the relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life.\nThe moderating role of psychological flexibility\nAccording to the organism-environment interaction model, individuals develop differently (more or less sensitive) to\nsimilar environments depending on certain intrinsic personal attributes, and thus show different adaptive outcomes (31). Yet, there are no empirical studies examining the moderating role of individual intrinsic attributes in the direct or indirect relationship between online loafing and sense of meaning in life. Psychological flexibility means that individuals consciously contact the present situation in a flexible and independent way, and act according to their own values in light of the conditions provided by the environment (32). Individuals with psychological flexibility pay attention to their current life experience and feelings with a receptive attitude, by observing those conceptualized self- experiences from the perspective of a third party, and actively dealing with negative emotional events. As a protective factor (33, 34), psychological flexibility may affect the link between state anxiety and mental health through a moderating effect and can help resist the adverse effects caused by trauma (35). It is considered as an adaptive coping strategy and plays an important role in recovering from adversity and stress (36). Therefore, cyberloafing, individuals with high level of psychological flexibility can pay attention to the current experience and feelings with a receptive attitude, which lead to improved physical and mental functions and reduced level of state anxiety; in comparison, individuals with low psychological flexibility have a more rigid thinking mode, which would lead to a tendency to fall into and be trapped with negative emotions and cognition, thus intensifying their state anxiety. Based on the analysis above, this study puts forward the following assumptions.\nH5: Psychological flexibility negatively moderates the relationship between cyberloafing and state anxiety. The stronger an individual\u2019s psychological flexibility, the weaker the positive relationship between cyberloafing and state anxiety. And the weaker an individual\u2019s psychological flexibility, the stronger the positive relationship between cyberloafing and state anxiety.\nThe relationships demonstrated by H4 and H5 further reveals the moderated mediation model, that is, the mediating effect of state anxiety between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life is strengthened under the condition of low psychological flexibility. Based on the above, this study constructs a moderated mediation model with an overall theoretical framework shown in Figure 1.\nH6: Psychological flexibility moderates the mediating effect of state anxiety between cyberloafing and sense of life meaning, that is, the stronger the psychological flexibility of college students, the weaker the mediating effect of state anxiety; while the weaker the psychological flexibility of college students, the stronger the mediating effect of state anxiety.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Theoretical model."

Our data was collected at three phases, separated by about 2 weeks. In Time-1 (End of October 2021), participants were requested respond to some demographic questions (including gender, age and the experience of using the network) and to evaluate the level of cyberloafing and their own level of psychological flexibility. One thousand one hundred and thirty seven questionnaires were collected, and 1,109 valid questionnaires were obtained after excluding invalid ones. In Time-2 (Mid November 2021), the survey was conducted following the same procedures, with participants being requested to assess their state anxiety. In this phase, 1,031 valid samples were collected. In Time-3 (Early December 2021), participants were requested to evaluate their sense of meaning of life. Finally, a total of 964 valid questionnaires were obtained. The overall data return rate was 84.8%.\nAmong the valid participants, 39.32% were male, 60.68% were female, the average age was 18.67 years (SD = 1.36).

The results revealed that the mutation rate interpretation of the first factor was 28.63%, which was less than the critical value of 40%, indicating that there was no obvious deviation of common method in this study.\nWe compared our hypothesized model (i.e., model 4, the baseline four-factor model) with a three-factor model\n(i.e., model 3, combining cyberloafing and state anxiety), a two-factor model (i.e., model 2 combining cyberloafing and state anxiety and combining the sense of meaning of life and psychological flexibility), and a one-factor model combining all items (i.e., model 1) (Table 1). Considering the changes in chi-square (i.e., \u03c72), two major fit indicators [i.e., comparative fit index (CFI) and incremental fit index (IFI)], and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), our hypothesized four- factor model [with \u03c72/df = 2.41, IFI = 0.95, CFI = 0.95, and RMSEA = 0.04] showed better fit than other alternative models (44, 45). RMSEA < 0.05, and \u03c72/df < 3 indicated good model fit (46), while the other indices such as CFI, IFI > 0.90 can be construed as an acceptable fit (47). Therefore, the discriminant validity of the constructs was confirmed. This suggests that the participants of our survey could distinguish the focal constructs clearly.\nDescriptive statistics and correlation analysis\nMean value, standard deviations, Cronbach\u2019s alpha, and correlation coefficient of the variables are shown in Table 2. Correlation analysis showed that cyberloafing is significantly positively correlated with state anxiety (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with the sense of meaning of life (r = \u22120.16, p < 0.01); state anxiety is significantly negatively correlated with the sense of meaning of life (r = \u22120.20, p < 0.01).

Cyberloafing was a significant predictor of the state anxiety (\u03b2 = 0.34, SE = 0.01, p< 0.01) and the sense of meaning of life (\u03b2 = \u22120.17, SE= 0.03, p< 0.01). State anxiety was a significant predictor of the sense of meaning of life (\u03b2 = \u22120.20, SE = 0.03, p < 0.01). Results of the bootstrapping test (\u03b2 = \u22120.16, SE = 0.03, p < 0.01) supported that CI did not contain zero. Therefore, the hypothesis that state anxiety plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life was supported. The direct (\u22120.11) and mediated (\u22120.05) prediction effects accounted for 68.75 and 31.25% of the overall effect, respectively.\nIn the second step, we employed Model 7 in the SPSS extension macro, and the moderated mediation model was tested.

All results are presented in Figure 2.\nIn addition, we plotted the interaction effects at different levels (i.e., +1 SD or \u22121 SD) of psychological flexibility using the recommendation of Aiken and West (49). Figure 3 shows that cyberloafing is more positively related to state anxiety when psychological flexibility is low rather than high. Accordingly, the hypothesis that the moderating effect of psychological flexibility on the cyberloafing\u2013state anxiety relationship was supported.\nWe further estimated the conditional indirect effect of cyberloafing on the sense of meaning of life via state anxiety across levels of psychological flexibility by bootstrapping the bias-corrected CI. The results are presented in Table 4. The indirect effect of cyberloafing on the sense of meaning of life through state anxiety was stronger and significant at a low level of psychological flexibility (effect size = \u22120.08, 95% bias-corrected CI from\u22120.13 to\u22120.03), but was weaker at a high level of psychological flexibility (effect size = \u22120.00, 95% bias-corrected CI from\u22120.01 to 0.01). Thus, hypothesis that psychological flexibility moderates the mediating effect of state anxiety between cyberloafing and sense of life meaning was supported."

            "text": "Based on the social displacement hypothesis and the stress transactional model, this paper discusses the impact of college students\u2019 cyberloafing on the sense of meaning of life through state anxiety.\nFirstly, this study found that cyberloafing has a significant negative effect on college students\u2019 sense of meaning of life. With the application of the Internet in the classroom, it brings convenience to learning, but it also brings some disadvantages. Cyberloafing on the Internet brings temporary pleasure, but it causes deeper academic problems (50). This is due to the fact that cyberloafing while studying has occupied a portion of college students\u2019 time which should have been devoted in academic and social activities; the consumption of scarce attention resources by cyberloafing has resulted in a sense of loss and helplessness (16), which creates a negative impact on the sense of meaning of life (27, 28). This finding has verified previous research (7) to a certain extent. More importantly, problematic network behaviors could cause college students to lose the pursuit of life and the meaning of life (18), which may be one of the reasons why contemporary youth lack a sense of meaning in life. Therefore, how to guide college students to use the Internet more reasonably in class, and better allocate\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 The moderated mediation model.\nattention and study time, is a problem that educators have to face.\nSecondly, our results show that state anxiety partially mediates the relationship between cyberloafing and the sense of meaning of life. That is, as a problematic network using behavior (3), cyberloafing consumes resources and tends to cause college students\u2019 negative emotions such as stress and state anxiety, thus reducing their sense of meaning of life. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of Becker et al. (13), that is, cyberloafing could lead to higher level of social anxiety among college students. With the occurrence of social anxiety, college students\u2019 subjective wellbeing and sense of meaning of life will also decline (24). Therefore, it is of great significance for college students to maintain a stable and peaceful mental state in their daily study and life and learn to reduce their anxiety.\nFinally, psychological flexibility can moderate the relationship between cyberloafing and state anxiety. In particular, by testing the moderated mediation model, this study\nfurther shows that psychological flexibility negatively moderates the mediating effect of state anxiety on the relationship between cyberloafing and sense of meaning of life. Specifically, individuals with high level of psychological flexibility have more effective adaptive and coping strategies and can better recover from the stressful situation of cyberloafing (36), therefore, their level of state anxiety can be reduced and their sense of value and meaning in life can be maintained and improved."

Second, although there are numerous studies on the sense of meaning of life both at home and abroad, previous studies mainly focus on the impact of the sense of meaning of life on other variables, while hardly has any studies turn their research lenses toward the antecedent variables of the sense of meaning of life and the individual factors affecting the generation of the sense of meaning. This study reveals a possible mechanism of cyberloafing on the sense of meaning of life based on the social displacement theory, which has provided a brand-new perspective for the study of the influencing factors of meaning of life. Third, this study has introduced the variable of psychological flexibility to explore the causes of the sense of meaning of life, which has not only enriched the existing research on the sense of meaning of life, but also has provided a reasonable approach to construct the theoretical system of the sense of meaning of life."

            "text": "Firstly, this study found that college students\u2019 cyberloafing will negatively affect their sense of meaning of life. It is extremely\nnecessary to guide them to use the Internet reasonably and moderately, enhance their self-control ability, and remind them of the potential harm of excessive cyberloafing; meanwhile, it is also necessary to exert the influence of mutual support and encouragement of peers to contribute to the formation of a good learning atmosphere and reduce cyberloafing behavior.\nSecondly, the important intermediary mechanism of state anxiety found in this study requires educators to pay active attention to the mental health and emotional state of college students, and effectively intervene their negative emotions through activities such as individual or group psychological counseling, emotional management lectures, mental health therapies and so on, so as to enhance college students\u2019 ability of emotional adjustment and provide supportive measures for the maintenance of their good emotional state.\nFinally, this study also shows that there exist individual disparities as regard to the mechanism of cyberloafing. Individuals with low level of psychological flexibility tend to adopt more rigid and negative coping styles, resulting in more anxiety; while individuals with high level of psychological flexibility tend to more easily give up their defense against the current situation, feel and experience their current thoughts and feelings, and alleviate their own anxiety. College students are advised to avoid falling into the trap thinking and complaining about the negative results brought by cyberloafing; instead, they should accept the current situation, switch to a more positive way of thinking, and maintain and enhance their own sense of meaning of life. Therefore, educators are advised to provide relevant trainings aiming at enhancing the psychological strength for college students with low level of psychological flexibility, and carry out necessary activities of psychological adjustment, through which the psychological flexibility of such college students can be improved."

Future research can improve the external validity of conclusions by expanding the source and scope of samples. Third, this study found that state anxiety plays a partial mediating role between cyberloafing and sense of life meaning, which indicates the existence of other mediating variables.
