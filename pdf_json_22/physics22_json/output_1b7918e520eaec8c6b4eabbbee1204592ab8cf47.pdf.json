    "abstractText": "We report the first operation of a Ra optical clock, a promising high-performance clock candidate. The clock uses a single trapped Ra ion and operates on the 7s S1/2 \u2192 6d D5/2 electric quadrupole transition. By self-referencing three pairs of symmetric Zeeman transitions, we demonstrate a frequency instability of 1.1\u00d710\u221213/\u221a\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the averaging time in seconds. The total systematic uncertainty is evaluated to be \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = 9\u00d7 10\u221216. Using the clock, we realize the first measurement of the ratio of the D5/2 state to the S1/2 state Land\u00e9 g-factors: gD/gS = 0.598 805 3(11) A Ra optical clock could improve limits on the time variation of the fine structure constant, \u03b1\u0307/\u03b1, in an optical frequency comparison. The ion also has several features that make it a suitable system for a transportable optical clock.",

            "text": "Radium Ion Optical Clock\nC. A. Holliman,1 M. Fan,1 A. Contractor,1 S. M. Brewer,2 and A. M. Jayich1\n1Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA\u2217 2Department of Physics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA\n(Dated: January 27, 2022)\nWe report the first operation of a Ra+ optical clock, a promising high-performance clock candidate. The clock uses a single trapped 226Ra+ ion and operates on the 7s 2S1/2 \u2192 6d 2D5/2 electric quadrupole transition. By self-referencing three pairs of symmetric Zeeman transitions, we demonstrate a frequency instability of 1.1\u00d710\u221213/\u221a\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the averaging time in seconds. The total systematic uncertainty is evaluated to be \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = 9\u00d7 10\u221216. Using the clock, we realize the first measurement of the ratio of the D5/2 state to the S1/2 state Lande\u0301 g-factors: gD/gS = 0.598 805 3(11) A Ra+ optical clock could improve limits on the time variation of the fine structure constant, \u03b1\u0307/\u03b1, in an optical frequency comparison. The ion also has several features that make it a suitable system for a transportable optical clock.\nOptical clocks, based on narrow-linewidth atomic transitions, are the most precise instruments ever realized [1]. The performance of several optical clocks, using different atoms, have now surpassed that of the primary cesium frequency standard [2\u20135], which marks a significant advance toward a proposed redefinition of the second [6]. Optical clocks also have the potential to uncover new physics beyond the standard model at the high-precision, low-energy frontier, including searches for ultralight scalar dark matter [7], the time variation of fundamental constants [8, 9], and violations of Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle [10]. In an effort to improve clock performance, atomic systems that are less sensitive to limiting systematic uncertainties such as Lu+ [11] and Ba4+ [12] have been proposed. For both advancing clock performance and for their enhanced sensitivity to potential sources of new physics, systems including highlycharged ions [13] and a radioactive thorium nuclear clock [14, 15] are being pursued.\nThe radium ion is well suited to realizing a highperformance optical clock [16]. The 7s 2S1/2 \u2192 6d 2D5/2 electric quadrupole clock transition (\u03bb = 728 nm, \u03c4 \u2248 300 ms, \u0393/2\u03c0 = 0.5 Hz) in Ra+ has a small, negative differential static scalar polarizability (DSSP) \u2206\u03b10 = \u221222.2(1.7) a.u. [17]. This leads to both a small frequency shift due to the blackbody radiation (BBR) environment and allows for clock operation at a trap drive frequency (6.2 MHz) such that the micromotion-induced scalar Stark shift and the second-order Doppler shift cancel [18, 19]. Along with the expected clock performance, the radium ion has the largest positive enhancement to the time variation of the fine structure constant, \u03baRa = 2.8, of any demonstrated clock [20]. The current constraint on \u03b1\u0307/\u03b1 is derived from a frequency comparison between an optical clock based on the Yb+ (E2) transition (\u03c4 \u2248 50 ms) and a second clock based on the Yb+ (E3) transition [9]. Considering sensitivities of demonstrated clocks, the Yb+ (E2) transition has the second largest positive enhancement to the time variation of the fine structure constant, \u03baE2 = 1, and the Yb + (E3) tran-\nsition has largest negative enhancement, \u03baE3 = \u22126. This makes the radium ion an appealing system to compare against other clocks to improve constraints on \u03b1\u0307/\u03b1.\nIn this Letter, we demonstrate the first operation of a radium optical clock by stabilizing a narrow-linewidth laser at 728 nm to the 7s 2S1/2 \u2192 6d 2D5/2 transition of a single 226Ra+ ion (I = 0). The 728 nm laser is an external cavity diode laser stabilized to an ultralow expansion glass cavity. We present an evaluation of the key systematic shifts and uncertainties as well as a self-referenced measurement of the clock frequency instability. From measurements made during the clock operation, we report the first measurement of the ratio of the D5/2 state to the S1/2 state Lande\u0301 g-factors.\nThe relevant Ra+ level structure, laser configuration, and quantization field used in this Letter are shown in Fig. 1. A single radium-226 ion is loaded by laser ablation of an \u223c10 \u00b5Ci RaCl2 target located 15 mm from the center of a linear Paul trap with characteristic dimensions r0 = 3 and z0 = 7.5 mm, see [21]. The radio frequency (rf) trap drive is operated at \u2126rf/2\u03c0 = 993 kHz, and for a single radium ion the axial secular frequency is \u03c9z/2\u03c0 = 78.5 kHz and the radial secular frequencies are \u03c9r/2\u03c0 = 141 and 156 kHz. Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) control the frequency and amplitude of all beams during clock operation. Clock state readout is performed by collecting 468 nm photons scattered by the Ra+ ion onto a photomultiplier tube [22]. As there is no magnetic field shielding around the vacuum apparatus, each clock interrogation cycle is synchronized to the laboratory 60 Hz power line to minimize Zeeman shifts due to magnetic field fluctuations.\nLinearly polarized 728 nm light is used to drive the |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 \u2192 |D5/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 (C1), |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 \u2192 |D5/2,m = \u00b13/2\u3009 (C2), and |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 \u2192 |D5/2,m = \u00b15/2\u3009 (C3) symmetric Zeeman transitions to operate the clock in a self-comparison mode [23]. By measuring symmetric Zeeman components that comprise all sublevels of the D5/2 state (|m| = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2), the linear Zeeman shift and the electric\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n07 33\n0v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 2\n6 Ja\nn 20\n22\n2\nquadrupole shift are both canceled [23, 24].\nEach clock interrogation cycle begins with an initial state detection (0.5 ms) to determine correct initialization of the population into the S1/2 or D3/2 laser cooling states. Following the initial state detection, the ion is Doppler cooled (5 ms) and the population is optically pumped to the appropriate |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 state (2 ms). We then coherently interrogate the clock transition (3 ms) on either the blue- or red-detuned half width at half maximum (HWHM), after which a state detection pulse is applied. In addition to probing the HWHM of the Zeeman transitions to determine the transition center frequency, we also interrogate the peak maximum, as well as six detunings around the peak. For every 20 interrogation cycles of the HWHM and peak maximum, we interrogate the six detunings around the peak to ensure that symmetric Zeeman transitions are probed with equal excitation probabilities and that all transitions remain locked, see Fig. 2 inset. To reset the system, we clean out population remaining in the D5/2 state by driving the D5/2 \u2192 P3/2 dipole transition (200 \u00b5s) where decays populate the S1/2 and D3/2 states.\nAfter each interrogation cycle, the frequencies of the six Zeeman transitions are updated with individual lock servos to stabilize the clock laser\u2019s frequency to the 7s 2S1/2 \u2192 6d 2D5/2 atomic resonance. The error signal for an interrogation cycle is given by E = (nb \u2212 nr)/n, where nb and nr are the number of times the population was driven to the excited state during interrogation on the blue- and red-detuned HWHM and n = 20 is the total number of interrogations [23]. If the initial state detection determined that the population was in the D5/2 state, the interrogation is not used in the error signal calculation. The shift of the center detuning of each Zeeman transition is updated from the previous detuning using the error signal and the measured drift rate of the optical cavity. Both of these values are updated throughout the experiment based on the shift of the clock transition center frequency, see Supplemental Material [25]. The\ncenter frequency of the 7s 2S1/2 \u2192 6d 2D5/2 transition is derived from an average of the three Zeeman pairs (C1, C2, and C3) following each interrogation cycle. The total interrogation cycle time for the three pairs of Zeeman transitions is 10 s, where the twenty interrogation cycles of the HWHM and peak maximum takes \u223c 6.1 s, the single interrogation cycle of the six detunings around the peak takes \u223c 0.6 s, and the pulse programming and data saving takes \u223c 3 s.\nThe measured Ra+ clock instability is shown in Fig. 2. An Allan deviation is obtained from the frequency difference of the three Zeeman pairs, (C1, C2), (C2, C3), and (C1, C3). The average of these three Allan deviations is divided by \u221a 6 to obtain the self-referenced fractional frequency stability of \u03c3(\u03c4) = 1.1\u00d7 10\u221213/\u221a\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the averaging time in seconds [23].\nA summary of systematic frequency shifts and uncertainties is shown in Table I. The overall frequency instability is currently limited by the clock interrogation time and the dead time in the total interrogation cycle. The 3 ms interrogation time on the clock transition is mainly limited by decoherence due to short-term ambient magnetic field noise. The 728 nm clock laser intensity used to drive a \u03c0-pulse with a 3 ms interrogation time is 0.5(3) kW/m2, which leads to a probe-induced ac Stark shift of \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (1.7\u00b1 0.9)\u00d7 10\u221215. This shift can be reduced by several orders of magnitude by implementing\n3 upgrades to the apparatus, such as magnetic field shield-\ning and a trap that can support stronger radial confinement, which would enable interrogation times that approach the D5/2 excited state lifetime of \u03c4 \u223c 300 ms [26]. Additionally, techniques such as hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy [27] or frequency stepping [28] could reduce this shift. All other laser beams (468, 802, 1079 nm) are turned off using double-pass AOMs during the clock interrogation pulse. To ensure that there is no leakage light present through the AOMs, they are also backed with mechanical shutters. During each interrogation cycle, the mechanical shutters are closed before the clock laser pulse.\nBlackbody radiation generated by the finite temperature of the trapping environment causes an ac Stark shift on the clock transition which depends on the DSSP of the transition and the effective temperature of the BBR at the location of the ion. The BBR-induced frequency shift is evaluated using the theoretical DSSP, \u2206\u03b10 = \u221222.2(1.7) a.u. [17] and the effective temperature of the BBR field at the ion\u2019s location, TBBR = 295(4) K [29]. To determine the ambient effective temperature and uncertainty observed by the ion, we measured the maximum temperature differential (3 K) of the vacuum chamber and performed a numerical simulation, using a finite element method, to estimate the maximum temperature rise (0.3 K) of the ion trap due to trap drive heating. The resulting BBR-induced frequency shift is evaluated as \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (4.3\u00b1 0.4)\u00d7 10\u221216. At the current level of precision, the total uncertainty in the BBR shift is dominated by the uncertainty in the DSSP, and, based on previous work in Ca+ and Sr+, the dynamic correction to the DSSP is negligible compared to the current theoretical uncertainty [17, 30].\nDuring clock operation, we average the frequencies of symmetric Zeeman pairs to synthesize a clock frequency that is first-order insensitive to magnetic fields. However, we have observed that magnetic field fluctuations at the location of the ion can be significant during the dead time between probing individual transitions in a Zeeman pair. This effect has been observed in previous single ion clocks based on Ca+ and can lead to a frequency shift due to a residual magnetic field drift between clock probes [31, 32]. The longest dead time between probings of a Zeeman pair is 50 ms, which is largely due to synchronizing the measurement with the 60 Hz ac power line. Given an average magnetic field drift rate of (0\u00b1 7)\u00d7 10\u221213 T/s observed in our system, and the maximum Zeeman shift sensitivity among all transitions used, 2.8\u00d7 1010 Hz/T, the pair averaged frequency shift is estimated to be \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (0\u00b1 2)\u00d7 10\u221218.\nCollisions between the Ra+ ion and background gas molecules (i.e. H2) can lead to a phase shift during the clock probe pulse. Here, we bound the corresponding clock frequency shift by assuming a worst case estimate of the phase shift of \u00b1\u03c0/2, which occurs in the middle of\na Rabi pulse. In this case, a collision with a background gas molecule leads to a frequency shift of 0.15Rcoll, where Rcoll is the background gas collision rate [33]. We measure Rcoll in our trap to be 0.0013(4) s\n\u22121 using the technique described in [34], which corresponds to a fractional frequency shift due to background gas collisions of \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (0\u00b1 6)\u00d7 10\u221219.\nFrequency shifts due to ion motion are characterized as that due to excess micromotion (EMM), due to the rf drive, and secular (thermal) motion. Ion motion leads to frequency shifts due to relativistic time dilation and the ac Stark effect [35]. Here, the time-dilation shift is the dominant source of frequency shift and uncertainty and is expressed as \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = \u2212v2/(2c2), where v is the speed of the ion in the laboratory frame and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The EMM-induced frequency shift is evaluated by measuring the amplitude of the ion motion at the trap drive frequency, \u2126rf/2\u03c0 [25]. The frequency shift due to secular motion is evaluated by characterizing the ion temperature during clock operation [24, 25]. The frequency shift due to secular motion is \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (\u22126.0\u00b1 0.6)\u00d7 10\u221219, and the EMMinduced frequency shift is \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = (\u22123.9\u00b1 0.5)\u00d7 10\u221218. The clock frequency shifts and uncertainties due to ion motion can be reduced by using an ion trap design that minimizes residual rf fields and supports higher secular motion frequencies. Trap improvements and operation at the \u201cmagic\u201d rf drive frequency (6.2 MHz) are expected to reduce both the magnitude and uncertainty of motional frequency shifts [17].\nAdditional systematic shifts, including the quadratic Zeeman shift and the electric quadrupole shift and their uncertainties are constrained at the low 10\u221219 level (fractional), see the Supplemental Material.\nThe ratio of Lande\u0301 g-factors, gD/gS , is directly obtained from the clock measurement data [36]. From a single clock measurement, such as shown in Fig. 2, we determine three ratios of Lande\u0301 g-factors from the frequency division of the three Zeeman pairs, see Fig. 3 (a). The weighted average of these three ratios gives a value for gD/gS . The reported gD/gS ratio is calcu-\n4\nlated from a weighted average of five measurements at different magnetic fields. The assigned uncertainty is the standard deviation of the measurements, resulting in gD/gS = 0.598 805 3(11) , see Fig. 3. Because of the rf trapping field, an ac magnetic field is present at the trap frequency, Btrap, at the location of the ion, which shifts the measured gD/gS [37]. By performing direct spectroscopy of individual Zeeman transitions with the rf trapping frequency set to the ground state magnetic sublevel splitting, we are able to set an upper bound of Btrap \u2264 7\u00d710\u22128 T. The systematic shift due to the maximum Btrap value is significantly smaller than the statistical uncertainty of gD/gS for all magnetic fields where the Lande\u0301 g-factor ratio was measured. To improve upon this initial measurement, the S1/2 state Lande\u0301 g-factor in Ra+ could be directly measured to high precision in a Penning trap [38] or in a comparison with a co-trapped ion magnetometer [39], which would, in turn, give the D5/2 state Lande\u0301 g-factor based on the ratio measured here.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the operation of a 226Ra+ ion clock with a total systematic uncertainty of \u2206\u03bd/\u03bd = 9 \u00d7 10\u221216 and a frequency instability of \u03c3(\u03c4) = 1.1\u00d710\u221213/\u221a\u03c4 . The current clock performance is primarily limited by (1) short-term magnetic field noise at the ion\u2019s location, which limits the clock interrogation time, (2) the uncertainty in the DSSP that dominates the uncertainty in the frequency shift due to BBR, and (3) limitations in the trap design that lead to motional decoherence. The ambient magnetic field noise can\nbe reduced by adding magnetic field shielding, as has been done with 40Ca+ [31] and 88Sr+ [24] and motional decoherence can be reduced by using an improved trap design [2, 40]. Reduced magnetic field sensitivity could be realized with radium-225, which has first-order magnetic field insensitive states due to its I = 1/2 nuclear spin. The 14.9 day half-life of radium-225 can be overcome by using an oven based on the decay of thorium229 (\u03c41/2 \u2248 7340 y), as demonstrated with a 10 \u00b5Ci oven source [41]. Such a source promises a long-term in vacuo supply of radium-225, as the thorium vapor pressure is more than a trillion times smaller than radium [42], which also makes it robust to inadvertently exhausting the atom supply by running the oven at high temperatures [43]. These features, along with the photonic-technology compatible wavelengths of Ra+ and the low optical power requirements of an ion clock make it an intriguing candidate for a transportable optical clock.\nWe thank Pierre Dube\u0301, Shimon Kolkowitz, Galan Moody, and Jwo-Sy Chen for helpful discussions and feedback.

CLOCK MEASUREMENT SEQUENCE\nState Detection: The signal for each interrogation are the 468 nm photons spontaneously emitted by the radium\nion, which are collected onto a photomultipler tube (PMT), Hamamatsu H10682-210. During 0.5 ms of state detection\n25 photons are collected on average if the population is in the S1/2 or D3/2 states, and 1.5 photons of background\nscattered light are collected if the population is shelved in the D5/2 clock state. We set the bright-state detection\nthreshold to 5.5 counts.\nState Preparation: We simultaneously drive the |S1/2,m = \u22131/2\u3009 \u2192 |D5/2,m = \u00b13/2\u3009, D3/2 \u2192 P1/2, and D5/2 \u2192 P3/2 transitions to prepare the population in the |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 state.\nCleanout: To prepare for the next interrogation any population shelved in the clock state is cleaned out with light\nat 802 nm, where decays from the P3/2 state populate the S1/2 and D3/2 states.\nFIG. S1. The measurement sequence for a single interrogation. There is a 5 ms Doppler cool period after the first state detection\nwhich is not shown in the figure. Squiggly lines depict E1 allowed decays, straight lines show optical pumping transitions, and\ndouble-arrows indicate optical cycling transitions.\nII. LOCK SERVO\nThe individual locking servos update the frequency detuning of each Zeeman transitions by \u2206\u03bd, following,\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n07 33\n0v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 2\n6 Ja\nn 20\n22\n2 \u2206\u03bd = GE + rcavitytc, (S1)\nwhere E = (nb\u2212nr)/n is the error signal defined in the text, G is a gain parameter, tc is the total interrogation cycle time (10 s), rcavity is the cavity drift rate (\u223c0.2 Hz/s). The cavity drift rate is updated with the average frequency of all transitions probed using an integral servo, with a time constant of \u223c1000 s.\nIII. CLOCK SYSTEMATICS\nA. Excess micromotion shifts\n1. Second-order Doppler shift\nThe second-order Doppler shift in fractional form is\n\u2206\u03bdD2 \u03bd0\n= \u2212 ( \u2126\n\u03c90\n)2 \u2211\nx,y,z\nRi, (S2)\nwhere \u03bd0 is the radium clock transition frequency in Hz, \u2126 is the trap rf drive frequency, \u03c90 = 2\u03c0\u03bd0, and \u2211 Ri is the\nsum of the micromotion sideband intensity ratios [1]. We use \u03bd0 = 412 007.701(18) GHz [2], \u2126rf/2\u03c0 = 993 kHz, and \u2211 Ri = 0.74(8), which we determine from measuring the micromotion sidebands in three near-orthogonal directions.\nWe calculate \u2206\u03bdD2 = \u22121.77(19) mHz.\n2. Scalar Stark shift\nThe scalar Stark shift in fractional form is\n\u2206\u03bdscalar \u03bd0 = \u2212\u2206\u03b10 ~\u03c90\n( m\u21262c\ne\u03c90\n)2 \u2211\nx,y,z\nRi, (S3)\nwhere \u2206\u03b10 is the differential static scalar polarizability and m is the mass of the ion [1]. We use \u2206\u03b10 = \u221222.2(1.7) a.u. [3]. We calculate \u2206\u03bdscalar = 0.045(6) mHz.\n3. Tensor Stark shift\nThe maximum possible tensor stark shift in fractional form is\n\u2206\u03bdtensor \u03bd0 = \u2212 \u03b12 ~\u03c90\n( m\u21262c\ne\u03c90\n)2 \u2211\nx,y,z\nRi, (S4)\nwhere \u03b12 is the D5/2 state tensor polarizability [1]. We use \u03b12(D5/2) = \u221252.6(5) a.u. [3]. We calculate \u2206\u03bdtensor = 0.108(12) mHz. We use the sum of the maximum shift and uncertainty, 0.120 mHz, as the uncertainty for this shift.\n3 B. Thermal motion shift\n1. Second-order Doppler shift\nThe fractional second-order Doppler shift due to the ion\u2019s secular motion is\n\u2206\u03bdD2 \u03bd0 = \u22125kTion 2mc2 , (S5)\nwhere Tion is the temperature of the ion, and k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant [1, 4, 5]. We measured the ion temperature\nalong in the axial and radial mode directions by driving Rabi oscillations on the clock transition and determined\nan average temperature of Tion = 0.6 mK. We estimate the temperature uncertainty to be 0.6 mK to account for\nfluctuations in Doppler cooling laser frequencies and any temperature imbalance between different secular motion\nmodes. This measured Tion is consistent with the Doppler cooling limit Tc = 0.4 mK. The corresponding frequency\nshift is \u2206\u03bdD2 = \u22120.3(3) mHz.\n2. Scalar Stark shift\nThe fractional scalar Stark shift due to the ion\u2019s thermal motion is\n\u2206\u03bdscalar \u03bd0 = \u2212kTion mc2 \u2206\u03b10 ~\u03c90\n( m\u2126c\ne\n)2 , (S6)\nwhere Tion is the temperature of the ion [1, 4, 5]. Here, the shift is measured to be \u2206\u03bdscalar = 0.003(3) mHz.\nC. Electric quadrupole shift\nThe electric quadrupole shift is cancelled because we are averaging Zeeman pairs. We can approximate the uncer-\ntainty on this cancellation from the electric quadrupole shift magnitude, AQ = [\u2206fQ(mj\u2032 = 5/2)\u2212\u2206fQ(mj\u2032 = 1/2)]/6 [1]. From the frequency difference between shifted pairs we determine the average drift rate of AQ to be \u22121.3 \u00b5Hz/s. Given our cycle time of 10 s we estimate the electric quadrupole shift uncertainty to be 0.013 mHz.\nD. Clock laser ac Stark shift\n728 nm: The ac Stark shift due to off-resonant dipole coupling is\n\u2206\u03bdac(\u03bb) = \u2212 \u2206\u03b1ac(\u03bb)\n2hc 0 I = \u03ba(\u03bb)I, (S7)\nwhere \u2206\u03b1ac(\u03bb) = \u2206\u03b1ac(D5/2, \u03bb) \u2212 \u2206\u03b1ac(S1/2, \u03bb), \u03bb is the laser wavelength and \u03ba(\u03bb) is the ac Stark shift intensity coefficient [1]. Using \u2206\u03b1ac(D5/2, 728 nm) = \u2212169(4) a.u. and \u2206\u03b1ac(S1/2, 728 nm) = 140(3) a.u. [6], we calculate \u03ba(728 nm) = 1.45(2) mHz/(W/m2). We measure the clock laser intensity to be 500(300) W/m2. The large uncertainty\nin the clock laser intensity is due to probing all Zeeman transitions with equal contrast, which requires different AOM\ndriving amplitudes. We calculate the clock laser ac Stark shift to be 0.7(4) Hz.\n4 E. Quadratic Zeeman shift\nThe quadratic Zeeman shift is caused by the mixing of the D5/2 and D3/2 sublevels when the ion is exposed to a\nmagnetic field. This shift is\n\u03bdZQ = \u3008\u03bd\u2032ZQ(mj)\u3009 = 2\n15\n( [\u00b5BB(gs \u2212 1)]2\nh2\u03bdDD\n) , (S8)\nwhere B is the magnetic field, gS = \u2212ge, \u00b5B is the Bohr magneton, and \u03bdDD is the energy separation between the D5/2 and D3/2 states [1]. We use a static magnetic field of B = 0.00057369(8) T, and \u03bdDD = 49.730 02(5) THz [2].\nWe calculate \u03bdZQ = 173.66(5) mHz.\nIV. EVALUATION OF THE LANDE\u0301 G-FACTOR RATIO\nFrom the clock measurement data we calculate three Lande\u0301 g-factor ratios from the three Zeeman pairs (C1, C2,\nand C3) defined in the text. For a given Zeeman transition the frequency detuning from the 728 nm transition center\nis given by\n\u03b4 = \u03ba gD gS mD \u2212 \u03bamS , (S9)\nwhere \u03ba = gS\u00b5BB/h, and gS is the ground state Lande\u0301 g-factor, \u00b5B is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field,\nand h is the Planck constant. The C1, C2, and C3 frequency detunings can be written as\nC1 = \u03b41/2\u21921/2 \u2212 \u03b4\u22121/2\u2192\u22121/2 = \u03ba ( gD gS \u2212 1 ) C2 = \u03b41/2\u21923/2 \u2212 \u03b4\u22121/2\u2192\u22123/2 = \u03ba (\n3 gD gS \u2212 1 )\nC3 = \u03b41/2\u21925/2 \u2212 \u03b4\u22121/2\u2192\u22125/2 = \u03ba ( 5 gD gS \u2212 1 )\nThe frequency ratios of C1, C2, and C3 then directly give three Lande\u0301 g-factor ratios\ngD gS\n= C1 C3 \u2212 1\n5C1C3 \u2212 1 =\nC1 C2 \u2212 1\n3C1C2 \u2212 1 =\nC2 C3 \u2212 1\n5C2C3 \u2212 3 (S10)\nThis method cancels out the electric quadrupole shift as C1, C2, and C3 are the frequency differences between\nsymmetric Zeeman transitions.\nV. AUTLER TOWNES SHIFT\nWhen the energy splitting between the ground state Zeeman sublevels, \u03c9S = gS\u00b5BB0/~, equals the rf trapping\nfrequency, \u2126rf/2\u03c0 = 993 kHz, there is an Autler-Townes splitting (gS\u00b5BBtrap/2~) of the clock transition due to the\ntrap\u2019s magnetic field, Btrap, driving the |S1/2,m = \u00b11/2\u3009 \u2192 |S1/2,m = \u22131/2\u3009 transition. To bound Btrap, we set \u2126rf = \u03c9S within 1 kHz by changing the static magnetic field B0. We did not observe any splitting at the sub 200 Hz\n5 level during direct spectroscopy of individual Zeeman transitions, which indicates that the Rabi frequency due to the\ntrap\u2019s magnetic field is not larger than \u223c1 kHz. Therefore the corresponding Btrap must be no larger than 7\u00d7 10\u22128\nT. The Btrap shifts the Lande\u0301 g-factor ratio, gD/gS , by\ngD gS =\n  1 + 12 \u03c92D \u03c92D\u2212\u21262rf \u3008B2trap\u3009 B20\n1 + 12 \u03c92S \u03c92S\u2212\u21262rf \u3008B2trap\u3009 B20\n  r, (S11)\nwhere \u03c9D = gD\u00b5BB0/~ and r is the measured Lande\u0301 g-factor ratio at the given static magnetic field [7]. The shift\nin the measured Lande\u0301 g-factor ratio due to Btrap is much smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the measured\nLande\u0301 g-factor ratio.\n[1] P. Dube\u0301, A. A. Madej, Z.
