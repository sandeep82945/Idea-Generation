    "abstractText": "Quorum sensing is a mechanism of bacterial cell-cell communication that relies on the production and detection of small molecule autoinducers, which facilitate the synchronous expression of genes involved in group behaviors, such as virulence factor production and biofilm formation. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing network consists of multiple interconnected transcriptional regulators, with the transcription factor, RhlR, acting as one of the main drivers of quorum sensing behaviors. RhlR is a LuxR-type transcription factor that regulates its target genes when bound to its cognate autoinducer, C4-homoserine lactone, which is synthesized by RhlI. RhlR function is also regulated by the metallo-\u03b2hydrolase enzyme, PqsE. We recently showed that PqsE binds RhlR to alter its affinity for promoter DNA, a new mechanism of quorum-sensing receptor activation. Here, we perform ChIP-seq analyses of RhlR to map the binding of RhlR across the P. aeruginosa genome, and to determine the impact of C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE on RhlR binding to different sites across the P. aeruginosa genome. We identify 40 RhlR binding sites, all but three of which are associated with genes known to be regulated by RhlR. C4-homoserine lactone is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many of its DNA sites. Moreover, C4-homoserine lactone is required for maximal RhlR-dependent transcription activation from all sites, regardless of whether it impacts RhlR binding to DNA. PqsE is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many DNA sites, with similar effects on RhlR-dependent transcription activation from those sites. However, the effects of PqsE on RhlR specificity are distinct from those of C4-homoserine lactone, and PqsE is sufficient for RhlR binding to some DNA sites in the absence of C4-homoserine lactone. Together, C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE are required for RhlR binding at the large majority of its DNA sites.

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing network consists of multi-\nple interconnected transcriptional regulators, with the transcription factor, RhlR, acting as\none of the main drivers of quorum sensing behaviors. RhlR is a LuxR-type transcription fac-\ntor that regulates its target genes when bound to its cognate autoinducer, C4-homoserine lactone, which is synthesized by RhlI. RhlR function is also regulated by the metallo-\u03b2hydrolase enzyme, PqsE. We recently showed that PqsE binds RhlR to alter its affinity for\npromoter DNA, a new mechanism of quorum-sensing receptor activation. Here, we perform\nChIP-seq analyses of RhlR to map the binding of RhlR across the P. aeruginosa genome,\nand to determine the impact of C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE on RhlR binding to differ-\nent sites across the P. aeruginosa genome.

One of the primary drivers\nof its antimicrobial resistance profile is biofilm formation. Biofilms are multicellular communities that are formed in an ordered mechanism by the collective. In the case of P. aeruginosa, biofilm formation is controlled by a cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing underpins transcriptional changes in a bacterium,\nallowing for the transition from individual, planktonic behaviors to group, sessile behav-\niors. Group behaviors are behaviors that are only beneficial to engage in once a critical\nthreshold of kin population is reached. The transition to group behaviors is mediated by\nquorum sensing through an interconnected regulatory system, with the transcription fac-\ntor receptor RhlR regulating the expression of hundreds of genes. RhlR-dependent tran-\nscription relies on the detection of a ligand produced by its partner synthase, RhlI, and an\naccessory binding protein that alters its affinity for promoter DNA, PqsE, resulting in a\ndual regulatory mechanism that was not previously observed in quorum sensing. The\nmain goal of this study was to determine the molecular basis for promoter selection by\nRhlR using bacterial genetics and DNA-based sequencing methods for measuring site-\nspecific protein binding. Our approach established the entirety of the RhlR direct regulon\nand the contributions of each of the known regulators to RhlR-dependent promoter bind-\ning and gene regulation."

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that can grow in nutrient-limited environments such as the reservoirs of water around sinks and in ventilators found in hospital set-\ntings. As a result, it is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens and is the primary\ncause of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the United States [1,2]. Quorum sensing (QS) is a\nprocess of bacterial cell-cell communication that controls pathogenesis in many bacterial species, including P. aeruginosa. QS relies on the production, accumulation, detection, and population-wide response to extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers (AI) [3]. QS allows\nbacteria to synchronously alter gene expression patterns that underpin collective behaviors,\nsuch as virulence factor production and biofilm formation [4,5]. QS signaling is relayed\nthrough a series of AI synthase/receptor pairs [6\u201312]. At high cell density, the synthase pro-\nduces a secreted AI that diffuses across the membrane and binds its cognate cytosolic receptor,\nultimately resulting in changes in gene expression [13\u201317].\nP. aeruginosa has two LuxI/R-type synthase/receptor pairs that act in concert to regulate virulence factor expression: LasI/R and RhlI/R [8,18\u201320]. QS in P. aeruginosa is best described as a hierarchical system of interconnected regulatory networks, starting with the LasI/R circuit. LasI synthesizes the AI N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, which binds the transcription factor receptor LasR. LasR upregulates the expression of rhlI/R, thereby initiating a\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 2 / 26\nData Availability Statement: EBI ArrayExpress\naccession numbers for all RhlR ChIP-seq data\nwere deposited under E-MTAB-12966 (https://\nwww.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-\nMTAB-12966).\nFunding: This work was supported by National\nInstitutes of Health grant R01GM14436101, New\nYork Community Trust Foundation grant P19-\n000454, and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation grant\nPACZKO21G0 to JEP; NIH Research Supplements\nto Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research\ngrant 1R01GM14436101-S1 to NJCT and JEP; NIH\ntraining grant T32GM132066 to LIP and MWB; and\nNIH grant R35GM144328 to JTW.

Homologous to LasI/R, RhlI synthesizes the AI Nbutyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4HSL), which binds the transcription factor receptor RhlR. Both systems function in a positive feedback manner with the receptor upregulating the tran-\nscription of its partner synthase, thus maximizing the transcriptional response of the system\n[8,11,21\u201327]. LasR and RhlR regulate the transcription of hundreds of genes, both directly and\nindirectly [13,19,21,28\u201332]. Each transcription factor has its own regulon, with a subset of genes co-regulated by both systems. LasR and RhlR co-regulate a third QS pathway, the Pseudomonas quinolone signaling (PQS) system [33\u201335]. LasR upregulates the transcription of pqsR. PqsR is a LysR transcription factor receptor that binds to the AI 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4 (1H)-quinolone (PQS), which is produced by the biosynthetic pathway enzymes encoded by the pqsABCDE operon and pqsH [36\u201340]. Similar to the Las and Rhl system, PqsR upregulates the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of its AI, thereby establishing another posi-\ntive feedback loop, resulting in a fully activated QS network [35,36]. RhlR transcriptionally represses the pqsABCDE operon, highlighting the interconnected regulatory mechanisms that govern the progression of QS in P. aeruginosa [35]. PqsE is a metallo-\u03b2-hydrolase enzyme encoded in the pqsABCDE operon and is involved in PQS synthesis. Recent work from our group and others has shown that PqsE plays a more nuanced role in QS signaling, outside of\nits role as an enzyme in the PQS biosynthetic pathway [29,41\u201347]. Moreover, PqsE is dispensable for the production of PQS, as the deletion of pqsE results in wild-type (WT) levels of PQS [45,46].\nDistinct from its role as an enzyme, PqsE plays an important role in the production of virulence factors; deletion of pqsE results in a failure of the strain to produce pyocyanin, an important virulence factor that is produced in a QS-dependent manner via the regulation of the paralogous phzABCDEFG1 and phzABCDEFG2 operons as well as phzH, phzM, and phzS [29,41,45,48,49]. Furthermore, pyocyanin production could not be restored by the addition of\nPQS, indicating a non-enzymatic role for PqsE in the regulation of pyocyanin production [50].\nWe recently discovered that PqsE physically interacts with RhlR to regulate the ability of RhlR\nto bind DNA and, thus, contributes to the regulation of pyocyanin production [29,44,47].\nMore globally, RNA-seq experiments revealed that the PqsE interaction with RhlR and\nC4HSL-bound RhlR contribute to RhlR-dependent gene regulation in an overlapping manner, with a few notable exceptions [28,29]. For example, the gene encoding rhamnolipid synthase, rhlA, is regulated by RhlR in a C4HSL-dependent manner, with PqsE exerting only a minor influence on its transcription. Conversely, the gene encoding hydrogen cyanide synthase, hcnA, is regulated by RhlR in a PqsE-dependent manner, with C4HSL exerting only a minor influence on its transcription. RNA-seq analyses revealed that these two examples occur on the\nfar ends of a wide spectrum of RhlR-dependent regulation. To date, the RhlR regulon has been\ninferred from gene expression analyses [42,50]. Thus, it is unknown which genes are directly\nregulated by RhlR promoter binding. Moreover, the dependence of RhlR on PqsE and C4HSL for binding different DNA sites has not been determined. Here, we perform ChIP-seq analyses\nof RhlR in different genetic backgrounds to comprehensively map genes that are directly regulated by RhlR in P. aeruginosa. We also assess the different and overlapping contributions of C4HSL and PqsE to RhlR-dependent regulation."

            "text": "Identification of 40 RhlR binding sites across the P. aeruginosa PA14 genome\nPrevious studies identified RhlR-regulated genes but could not determine the direct RhlR-\nmediated regulation due to the lack of binding data [19,27\u201329,42,50]. To distinguish between\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 3 / 26\ndirect and indirect regulation, we mapped RhlR binding to the P. aeruginosa PA14 genome using ChIP-seq in WT PA14 with a polyclonal antibody raised against RhlR [41]. To account\nfor the possibility that the antibody binds proteins other than RhlR, we performed a parallel ChIP-seq experiment in a \u0394rhlR strain. Of the 168 genomic regions enriched in ChIP-seq with the WT strain (S1 Table), 40 had decreased enrichment in the \u0394rhlR strain (S1 Fig). We consider these 40 regions to be true RhlR-bound regions (Table 1; see methods for details). We\nspeculate that the other 128 regions are not RhlR-bound. Indeed, many of these 128 regions\nare known MvaT/U binding sites, suggesting that their enrichment in the RhlR ChIP-seq was\ndue to cross-reactivity of the RhlR antibody with MvaT and/or MvaU [51,52].\nThe 40 RhlR-bound regions we identified include many with well-established RhlR regula-\ntory elements, such as rhlA, hcnA, and phzA1 (Fig 1A\u20131C) [19,20,29,53,54]. We identified a strongly enriched DNA sequence motif associated with 26 of the 40 RhlR-bound regions (Fig\n1D and Table 1). This sequence motif matches the known RhlR binding consensus, which was\npreviously determined using promoter sequences from the core regulon, and is similar to\nthose of other LuxR-type family proteins [55]. Interestingly, we did not find a match to the RhlR motif in the regions upstream of genes phzH and rahU (encodes hemolysin) that are well-established RhlR-regulated genes. These findings suggest that the presence of a luxbox sequence alone is insufficient to explain RhlR binding to all DNA targets, or that some lux-boxes deviate considerably from the consensus motif. We next determined the position of RhlR-bound regions relative to genes (Table 1). 32\nRhlR binding sites are in intergenic regions, <500 bp upstream of the start of a gene. This is an\n8-fold enrichment over the number of intergenic regions expected by chance (~10% of the\ngenome is intergenic). Eight RhlR binding sites are within genes; these include sites within phzB1 and phzB2 that also have stronger upstream RhlR binding sites (Fig 1C). Five of the eight intragenic RhlR-bound regions are <500 bp upstream of a neighboring gene, suggesting\nthat RhlR bound to these regions may regulate transcription of the neighboring gene. Overall,\nRhlR binds predominantly to regions upstream of genes, consistent with its role as a transcrip-\ntion regulator.\nIdentification of directly RhlR-regulated genes\nIntergenic RhlR binding sites are associated with 17 transcripts (defined as single-gene or multi-gene operons) that showed significant (q<0.01) differential expression +/- rhlR in our recent RNA-seq study (Figs 1A\u20131C and 2, and Table 1) [29]. An additional 26 transcripts with associated intergenic RhlR binding sites (e.g., lasB) did not have significant differential expression in our data, but 14 of these transcripts were shown to be regulated by RhlR in\nother RNA-seq studies, bringing the total number of transcripts with an upstream RhlR\nbinding site and evidence of RhlR-dependent regulation to 31. We consider these 31 tran-\nscripts to be direct regulatory targets of RhlR (Table 1). RhlR-dependent regulation of some\ngenes is likely to be condition-specific, which would explain apparent disparities in RNA-\nseq studies. All but one of the directly RhlR-regulated transcripts is positively regulated by RhlR (fhp is negatively regulated), consistent with the known function of RhlR as a transcription activator. Some genes (e.g., chiC, opmD, pelG, and mucA) have been shown to be rhlR-dependent by RNA-seq in multiple studies, but were not associated with RhlR binding [19,29,50]. These genes are likely indirectly regulated by RhlR. Consistent with this idea, multiple genes encoding known or predicted transcription regulators, including vqsR, have associated RhlR binding sites.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 4 / 26\nCharacterization of the role of RhlI-synthesized C4HSL in selective RhlR promoter occupancy\nPrevious work in our lab and others suggested that RhlI-synthesized C4HSL has an unequal impact on regulation of different genes by RhlR [19,29,56,57]. RNA-seq analyses of a \u0394rhlR strain and a \u0394rhlI strain revealed that RhlR-controlled genes are regulated by C4HSL to varying degrees [19,29], suggesting that RhlR may bind and regulate transcription from some DNA\nsites in the absence of its ligand and/or that there are additional factors that assist RhlR binding\nDNA. To understand the impact of C4HSL on RhlR binding to its DNA sites, we repeated ChIP-seq of RhlR in a \u0394rhlI strain and compared the occupancy of RhlR at each of the 40 RhlR-bound regions. The \u0394rhlI strain served to assess the role of C4HSL in regulating RhlR binding; analysis of a strain lacking rhlI is viewed as a strain lacking C4HSL. ChIP-seq data for WT and \u0394rhlI strains report on differences in the relative binding of RhlR to the 40 DNA sites +/- rhlI. Differences in absolute ChIP-seq signal at individual DNA sites +/- rhlI likely reflect\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900.g002\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 8 / 26\ndifferences in absolute occupancy, although this cannot be confirmed without a spike-in con-\ntrol [58].\nThe effect of C4HSL on RhlR binding to DNA varied considerably between RhlR-bound\nregions (Fig 3A and Table 1). For example, binding of RhlR upstream of rhlA decreased 4-fold in the \u0394rhlI strain compared to WT PA14 (Fig 1A). Conversely, binding of RhlR upstream of hcnA increased 1.5-fold in the \u0394rhlI strain relative to WT PA14 (Fig 1B and Table 1). Thus, our data support a variable role of C4HSL in RhlR binding to DNA sites, with some sites requiring C4HSL for maximal RhlR binding and other sites being unaffected by the loss of C4HSL.\nThe binding sites upstream of rhlA and hcnA are examples of two broad classes of RhlRdependent binding sites that are more or less C4HSL-dependent, respectively. However, these dependencies are not binary, and occur on a spectrum with the least C4HSL-dependent binding site upstream of hcnA, and the most C4HSL-dependent binding site upstream of arcD (16-fold decrease in RhlR binding when rhlI was deleted) (Table 1). Known QS-regulated genes associated with RhlR binding sites that are dependent on C4HSL for RhlR binding include, in order from less to more C4HSL-dependent: phzA1, phzH, lasA, lasB, and phzA2 (Table 1). Known QS-regulated genes associated with RhlR binding sites that are not dependent on C4HSL for RhlR binding include lecB, phzB1, and phzB2 (Table 1). We note that few RhlR-bound regions are completely dependent upon C4HSL for RhlR binding, indicating that RhlR can bind most of its DNA sites in the absence of C4HSL, albeit with reduced affinity in many cases.\nTo determine the role of C4HSL in the regulation of RhlR target genes, we compared\nexpression of directly RhlR-regulated genes +/- rhlI from our recent RNA-seq study (Fig 3B and Table 1) [29]. We focused on genes associated with strong RhlR binding sites (see Methods for a description of strong sites) and at least a 2-fold difference in expression +/- rhlR. C4HSLdependent changes in expression of RhlR target genes correlated positively with C4HSLdependent changes in RhlR binding (Fig 3C). The effect of deleting rhlI on expression of rhlA was similar to the effect of deleting rhlR, consistent with strongly C4HSL-dependent binding of RhlR upstream of rhlA. However, even for genes such as hcnA, where RhlR binding is unaffected by C4HSL, we still observed a substantial requirement for C4HSL for regulation by RhlR (Fig 3C). These data strongly suggest that even at sites where C4HSL is not required for RhlR binding to DNA, C4HSL is required for RhlR to maximally activate transcription.\nCharacterization of the role of PqsE in selective RhlR promoter occupancy\nPrevious studies showed that PqsE forms a complex with RhlR and increases the affinity of\nRhlR for some DNA sites [29,44]. PqsE also promotes transcription activation by RhlR\n[28,29,43]. We speculated that PqsE can selectively assist RhlR binding to DNA sites, which\nwould explain the variable dependence of different RhlR binding sites for C4HSL. To investigate the effect of PqsE on RhlR binding to its DNA sites, we repeated ChIP-seq of RhlR in a \u0394pqsE strain and compared the binding of RhlR in the WT strain to each of the 40 RhlRbound regions +/- pqsE (Fig 4A). ChIP-seq data for WT and \u0394pqsE strains report on differences in the relative binding of RhlR to the 40 DNA sites +/- pqsE. Differences in absolute ChIP-seq signal at individual DNA sites +/- pqsE likely reflect differences in absolute occupancy, although this cannot be confirmed without a spike-in control [58].\nThe effect of pqsE deletion on RhlR binding varied dramatically for different RhlR-bound regions. For example, binding of RhlR upstream of hcnA decreased 10-fold in the \u0394pqsE strain compared to WT PA14 (Fig 1B). Conversely, binding of RhlR upstream of rhlA decreased only 1.5-fold in the \u0394pqsE strain (Fig 1A). Thus, our data support a variable role of PqsE in RhlR\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 9 / 26\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900.g003\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 10 / 26\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900.g004\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 11 / 26\nbinding to its DNA sites, with some sites requiring PqsE for maximal RhlR binding and other\nsites being unaffected by loss of PqsE, similar to the role of C4HSL.\nThe binding sites upstream of hcnA and rhlA are examples of two broad classes of RhlRdependent binding sites that are more or less PqsE-dependent, respectively. However, these\ndependencies are not binary, and occur on a spectrum with the least PqsE-dependent binding site upstream of PA14_48530 (no impact of PqsE on RhlR binding), and the most PqsE-dependent binding site upstream of PA14_30840 (189-fold decrease in RhlR binding when pqsE was deleted). Known QS-regulated genes associated with RhlR binding sites that are dependent on PqsE for RhlR binding include lecB and hcnA. Known QS-regulated genes associated with RhlR binding sites that are not dependent on PqsE for RhlR binding include azeB, azeA, and rhlI [50]. We note that 14 of the 31 regulated sites had at least a 2-fold change in RhlR occupancy in the \u0394pqsE strain relative to that in WT PA14, indicating that RhlR binding to many sites is enhanced by PqsE.\nWe previously showed that a D73A substitution in PqsE abolishes catalytic activity but has\nno impact on the interaction with RhlR [47]. We also showed that PqsE with the triple substi-\ntution R243A/R246A/R247A (the \u201cNon-Interacting\u201d [NI] mutant) is impaired for interaction\nwith RhlR [29,44,59]. To test the effect of these mutations on the genome-wide binding profile of RhlR, we performed ChIP-seq of RhlR in strains expressing pqsE D73A or pqsE-NI. Consistent with our prior study, binding of RhlR in cells expressing pqsE D73A was more similar to that in WT cells than \u0394pqsE cells (R2 = 0.16 for WT vs \u0394pqsE, and R2 = 0.98 for WT vs pqsE D73A; compare Fig 4A and S2A Fig). Binding of RhlR in cells expressing pqsE-NI was more similar to that in \u0394pqsE cells than WT cells (R2 = 0.16 for WT vs \u0394pqsE, and R2 = 0.97 for pqsE-NI vs \u0394pqsE; compare Fig 4A and S2B Fig). These data are consistent with the overlapping expression profiles of pqsE D73A with WT (S2C Fig), and pqsE-NI with \u0394pqsE (S2D Fig) [29,47].\nTo determine the role of PqsE in the regulation of RhlR target genes, we compared expres-\nsion of direct RhlR target genes +/- pqsE from our recent RNA-seq study (Fig 4B and Table 1). We focused on genes associated with strong RhlR binding sites and at least a two-fold difference in expression +/- rhlR. PqsE-dependent changes in expression of RhlR target genes correlated positively with PqsE-dependent changes in RhlR binding (Fig 4C). For example, the effect of deleting pqsE on the expression of hcnA was similar to the effect of deleting rhlR, consistent with strongly PqsE-dependent binding of RhlR upstream of hcnA. By contrast, deleting pqsE had no impact on expression of rhlA, consistent with a modest impact of PqsE on RhlR binding upstream of rhlA. Despite the positive correlation between the dependence on PqsE for RhlR binding and activation, the expression of some genes was largely independent of\nPqsE notwithstanding a strong dependence of RhlR binding on PqsE. For example, binding of RhlR upstream of PA14_01490 was 3.7-fold lower in the \u0394pqsE strain than in WT PA14, but the effect of deleting pqsE on expression of PA14_01490 was only 30% the effect of deleting rhlR. This suggests that RhlR bound to DNA in the absence of PqsE is a stronger transcription activator than RhlR bound in complex with PqsE.\nComparison of the roles of C4HSL and PqsE in selective RhlR promoter occupancy\nChIP-seq and RNA-seq data showed that RhlR binding and RhlR-dependent transcription activation of rhlA and lasB are more dependent on C4HSL than PqsE, whereas the opposite is true for hcnA and lecB (Table 1). As an independent test of the impact of C4HSL and PqsE on RhlR-dependent transcription activation of rhlA, lasB, hcnA, and lecB, we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure RNA levels for these genes in WT PA14, \u0394rhlR, \u0394rhlI, \u0394pqsE, and\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 12 / 26\n\u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE strains (Fig 5A). Expression of all five genes was reduced at least 2-fold in \u0394rhlR relative to WT PA14. These data are largely consistent with RNA-seq data. Expression of rhlA and lasB was significantly more dependent upon rhlI than pqsE (one-tailed t test, p-values = 0.04 in both cases). By contrast, expression of hcnA was significantly more dependent upon pqsE than rhlI (one-tailed t test, p-value = 0.03). Expression of lecB was roughly equally dependent upon pqsE and rhlI (two-tailed t test, p-value = 0.23). For all five genes, simultaneous deletion of both rhlI and pqsE mirrored the effect of deleting rhlR, suggesting that RhlR requires one or\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900.g005\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 13 / 26\nboth of C4HSL and PqsE to bind DNA and activate transcription from any DNA site. The effect of deleting both rhlI and pqsE on expression of RhlR target genes was consistent with our ChIP-seq analyses of RhlR performed in a \u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE strain, as deletion of both regulators resulted in nearly the same decrease in binding occupancy at almost all sites compared to the deletion of rhlR (Fig 5B and S3 Fig). Nonetheless, there are a handful of sites where RhlR retains some ability to bind DNA even in the absence of both rhlI and pqsE (S3 Fig). To further assess the role of C4HSL and PqsE on gene expression, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on rhlA, hcnA, and lecB in \u0394rhlI and \u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE strain backgrounds with increasing concentrations of C4HSL. Expression of rhlA was sensitive to the addition of C4HSL in both the \u0394rhlI and \u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE backgrounds, indicating that C4HSL is the main driver of its expression (Fig 5C). Conversely, hcnA and lecB expression levels were largely independent of C4HSL across all concentration ranges tested in the \u0394rhlI strain, and maximal expression was dependent on the presence of PqsE, as the \u0394rhlI strain had higher expression levels for both genes than the \u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE strain, although the differences are not statistically significant in every instance (p-value> 0.05), especially at the highest C4HSL concentration (Fig 5C).\nTo directly assess the role of C4HSL and PqsE in gene expression, we compared the effect of C4HSL and PqsE on RhlR-dependent transcription activation of rhlA, lasB, hcnA, and lecB using luciferase reporter fusions in Escherichia coli expressing either rhlR, or rhlR and pqsE, +/- C4HSL (Fig 6A) [29,47,60]. We chose 4 \u03bcM C4HSL for this assay because higher concentrations abrogate the effects of PqsE on RhlR activity [47]. These data are largely consistent with RNA-seq data, and the regulator dependencies described above. Expression of rhlA and lasB was strongly dependent upon C4HSL and only modestly stimulated by PqsE. By contrast, expression of hcnA and lecB was not significantly enhanced by the addition of C4HSL but was strongly stimulated by PqsE (Fig 6A). Since E. coli does not produce RhlR, PqsE, or C4HSL, we view the E. coli heterologous reporter system as a way to study the regulatory effects at different promoters in the absence of other regulators, permitting us to draw inferences about the direct\neffects of the factors being tested. To determine the effect of PqsE on RhlR binding to DNA sites in vitro, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using 200 bp fragments of the rhlA, hcnA, and lecB promoters centered around the determined RhlR DNAbinding motif sequence (Fig 1D) with purified RhlR +/- PqsE added at equimolar concentra-\ntions (Fig 6B and Table 1). We note that neither we, nor others in the field, have purified WT\nRhlR bound to its native AI. Instead, we solubilized and purified RhlR in the presence of the\nsynthetic agonist meta-bromothiolactone (mBTL), as previously described [41]. mBTL\nbehaves identically to C4HSL in cell-based reporter assays [61,62]. To the best of our knowledge, native WT RhlR cannot be purified from E. coli without a ligand present. Thus, the reciprocal experiment with RhlR +/- C4HSL could not be performed. We also note that the affinity of RhlR for the different binding sites is likely to be different. Consistent with our previous work and with the work shown above, RhlR bound the rhlA promoter in the absence of PqsE, but its binding was enhanced when in complex with PqsE [29]. Conversely, at the concentrations tested, RhlR alone could not bind the hcnA or lecB promoter, and required PqsE to bind DNA (Fig 6B). These data are consistent with our ChIP-seq, E. coli reporter, and P. aeruginosa transcription analyses, and indicate a potential hierarchy of promoter specificity that results\nfrom the mixture of C4HSL and PqsE dependencies at RhlR-regulated promoters."

Our findings are largely consistent with prior\nstudies that focused on RhlR-dependent changes in RNA levels [27,29,42,50], but our data\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 14 / 26\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900 December 8, 2023 15 / 26\nhelp to distinguish direct from indirect regulation. Moreover, apparent inconsistencies in\nRNA-seq data between studies, and the presence of RhlR binding sites upstream of genes with-\nout apparent RhlR-dependent changes in RNA levels, suggest that direct regulation of some\ngenes by RhlR is condition-specific, requiring additional factors. Most genes in the direct RhlR\nregulon have established roles in QS. Direct RhlR regulation of several uncharacterized genes, such as PA14_59180, PA14_22090, and PA14_10360, strongly suggests a role for these genes in QS. Regarding the role of PqsE, our data are also largely consistent with an RNA-seq study\nthat assessed the effect of RhlR and PqsE on transcript levels genome-wide [42]. However, the\nmajority of RhlR-regulated and PqsE-regulated genes are likely to be indirectly regulated,\nhighlighting the value of combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.\nBoth C4HSL and PqsE contribute to RhlR-dependent transcription activation, but to vary-\ning degrees depending on the RhlR site. In the absence of both C4HSL and PqsE, RhlR binding to DNA was abolished for almost all sites (Fig 5B and S3 Fig), resulting in no RhlR-dependent\ngene activation (Fig 5A). We conclude that in most cases, RhlR needs to bind at least one of\nC4HSL or PqsE for maximal activation of gene targets. We speculated that there is an inverse relationship between dependence on C4HSL and dependence on PqsE, as appears to be the case for sites associated with rhlA, lasB, hcnA, and lecB (Figs 5 and 6). However, this is not generally the case, with an R2 value of 0.08 when comparing RhlR binding dependence on C4HSL to RhlR binding dependence on PqsE (Fig 7). Moreover, C4HSL is required for binding at some sites more than others but is essential for maximal expression everywhere, suggesting\nthat C4HSL binding to RhlR imparts substantial conformational changes in RhlR without necessarily impacting the ability of RhlR to bind DNA. These findings indicate that RhlR can be stable without a small molecule ligand in P. aeruginosa, which is not the case in E.coli overexpression systems [61]. The prevailing dogma was that this class of LuxR-type receptors folded\naround their native ligand during complex assembly. However, previous Western blot analyses on RhlR in a \u0394rhlI strain revealed that RhlR remained in the soluble fraction and was not targeted for degradation; it was unclear if the protein was functional [19]. Our results point to a\nscenario where RhlR is stable without C4HSL because of the presence of PqsE. PqsE is required for RhlR binding to some sites more than others, but the ability of RhlR to activate transcription is only weakly affected by loss of pqsE at sites that lose a significant amount of RhlR binding when pqsE is absent. We speculate that C4HSL:RhlR bound to PqsE, while having a higher affinity for promoter DNA than C4HSL:RhlR alone, is an overall weaker activator of transcription.\nThe dependence on C4HSL and/or PqsE for RhlR binding is likely due to differences in the DNA sequences of the RhlR binding sites, or the surrounding sequence. Initially, we hypothe-\nsized that PqsE could drive RhlR to promoters with a more degenerate binding motif, or promoters without a detectable binding motif. While that appears to be the case with hcnA, it is not true for lecB (Table 1). We were unable to infer a PqsE-dependent motif because so few binding sites are strongly associated with PqsE for binding. Future experiments involving chimeric\nbinding sites may reveal the molecular basis for PqsE promoter dependency. Additionally,\nregions surrounding the RhlR-dependent motif could have an effect on binding to the motif\nrepresent standard deviations of the means of biological replicates. Multiple unpaired one-tailed t tests were performed to compare the mean of each promoter fusion between the arabinose only control (gray) and C4HSL (blue) or between C4HSL and C4HSL + PqsE (purple) treatments.

For example, integration host factor (IHF) in Vibrio harveyi regulates LuxR binding and transcription at the luxC promoter by binding to regions upstream of the lux-box binding motif, bending the DNA, and physically interacting with LuxR [63]. Thus, additional regulatory sequences or regulatory elements could alter\nPqsE-dependency by specifically interacting with PqsE only when it is in complex with RhlR.\nThe activation of a transcription factor, in this case, RhlR, via an accessory protein, such as\nPqsE, is unique in QS. We speculate that the relative abundance of C4HSL and PqsE might differ according to different growth conditions, particularly with respect to cell density, and these\nrelative differences affect the timing of RhlR-dependent gene expression. For example, condi-\ntions might exist where PqsE concentrations are low, which would result in a higher depen-\ndence on C4HSL binding and activation, leading to a subset of RhlR-dependent genes being expressed. Given that RhlR represses pqsE expression, we speculate that expression of the PqsE-dependent RhlR regulon decreases as C4HSL accumulates. Thus, there is likely a window at which the C4HSL and PqsE concentrations are \u201coptimal\u201d, where maximal gene expression of both regulons can occur. Further studies are needed to determine whether the timing of\nRhlR activation for different genes is impacted by the dependence on PqsE."

The total\nreads for each called peak in each replicate of the ChIP-seq data were calculated by summing\nthe read count within 100 bases of the center of each peak and normalizing by the total reads\nof the replicate multiplied by 1,000,000. The read counts for each peak were then averaged\nwith their duplicate. The value for each peak in the WT average was then divided by the scores for the rhlR deletion average, and peaks with a ratio > 1 were identified and referred to as \u201creal\u201d RhlR binding sites. We expect that these only include sites that are associated with RhlR\nbinding, but it is formally possible that the antibody cross-reacts with proteins whose abun-\ndance is dependent upon RhlR. The original list of ChIP-sites was used to determine the genes\nwith internal ChIP sites or a ChIP site within 500 bases upstream of the gene or its operon\nstart (S1 Table). Genes were then further filtered by association with a \u201creal\u201d RhlR binding site\nas identified using R (Table 1). Values in Table 1 for RNA-seq data represent fold-change versus WT. Values plotted in Figs 3C and 4C show the effect of deleting rhlI or pqsE on RNA levels relative to that of deleting rhlR. For example, if we consider PA14_01490, normalized RNA levels in WT, \u0394rhlR, and \u0394pqsE strains are 2956, 160, and 2108, respectively. Hence, the ratios of RNA transcripts for WT to \u0394rhlR and WT to \u0394pqsE strains are 18.4 and 1.4, respectively. However, if we consider the absolute difference in RNA levels from WT to \u0394pqsE strains, the number is 848, as compared to 2796 for WT to \u0394rhlR, i.e., 30%. Similarly, the absolute difference in RNA levels for hcnA between \u0394pqsE and WT cells is 80% of the difference between \u0394rhlR and WT cells, despite the fold-change numbers being rather different.

Cyan and pink dots correspond to genes with a RhlR binding site <500 bp upstream of the corresponding operon, as determined by ChIP-seq, that are also differentially expressed +/- rhlR (q< 0.01) as determined by RNAseq in an earlier study [29].\n(TIFF)\nS3 Fig. The combined contribution of both RhlI and PqsE to RhlR binding. The combined\ncontribution of RhlI and PqsE to RhlR binding was calculated using ChIP-seq enrichment\nvalues from Table 1 at each ChIP-seq peak center using the following equation: (WTenrichment\u2014\u0394rhlI\u0394pqsEenrichment)/(WTenrichment\u2014\u0394rhlRenrichment)*100. We note that values were greater than 100% for ten sites (indicated by #), likely due to experimental noise (eight\nvalues were <140%). There were also three values <0, and those were set to 0 (indicated by ^). These were cases where RhlR binding increased in the \u0394rhlI\u0394pqsE strain, but binding in the WT strain was also very low, and we were unable to identify a match to the RhlR consensus motif associated with these sites. Characterized QS genes of interest are highlighted: lecB (magenta), lasB (dark green), hcnA (light green), rhlA (cyan), phzA1 (olive), and phzA2 (brown).\n(TIFF)\nS1 Table. List of all RhlR ChIP-seq binding sites from WT PA14. The average peak values\nare the average of two biological replicates and two independent ChIP experiments. Peak val-\nues were calculated as the sum of all enrichment within 100 bases upstream and downstream\nof the center of the ChIP peak.\n(DOCX)"
