We present a method that estimates food preference over many study sites, even when number of food types vary widely from site to site. Sampling variation is estimated using bootstrapping. We test the precision and accuracy of this method using computer simulations that show the effects of overall number of food types, number of sites, and proportion of missing prey items per site. Accuracy is greater with fewer missing prey types, more prey types and more sites, and is affected by the number of sites more than the number of prey types. We present a case study using lion (Panthera leo) feeding data and show that preference vs prey size follows a bell-curve. Using just two estimated parameters, this curve can be used as a general way to describe predator feeding patterns. Our method can be used to: test hypotheses about what factors affect prey selection, predict preferences in new sites, and estimate overall prey consumed in new sites. Introduction Most natural ecosystems contain animals feeding on many different types of food, but it is difficult to predict what will be eaten when food availabilities change. Ecologists face this issue all the time. For example, if we introduce a biocontrol agent then will it escape regulation by predators? Or if climate change shifts the range of a plant species then how will that affect feeding on other plants eaten by a common herbivore? Or if an invasive species appears then how will its predators respond? We need to be able to predict food preference for any combination of food types. At the moment, theories of predator behaviour explain processes in current study sites but do not predict preference in new study sites. Such theories include optimal foraging [1\u20133] and more specific theories on frequency-dependent predation [4, 5], prey-switching [6, 7], idealfree distributions [8, 9], and functional responses [10\u201312]. These theories were not developed to predict preferences in new study sites. There have also been some excellent studies looking at how dietary preference varies with factors such as amounts of food [7, 13], seasonality [14, 15] or habitat [16, 17].

Ecologists face this issue all the time. For example, if we introduce a biocontrol agent then will it escape regulation by predators? Or if climate change shifts the range of a plant species then how will that affect feeding on other plants eaten by a common herbivore? Or if an invasive species appears then how will its predators respond? We need to be able to predict food preference for any combination of food types.\nAt the moment, theories of predator behaviour explain processes in current study sites but\ndo not predict preference in new study sites. Such theories include optimal foraging [1\u20133] and more specific theories on frequency-dependent predation [4, 5], prey-switching [6, 7], idealfree distributions [8, 9], and functional responses [10\u201312]. These theories were not developed to predict preferences in new study sites.\nThere have also been some excellent studies looking at how dietary preference varies with\nfactors such as amounts of food [7, 13], seasonality [14, 15] or habitat [16, 17].

It has been difficult to predict on a large scale how preference varies with density or habitat or season, because it is difficult to disentangle effects of those factors vs the effects of other food types. One of us (MWH) has simply averaged preferences over many sites, assuming that large sample sizes from diverse food communities across large geographic areas will account for the challenges of comparing preferences between diverse communities [18\u201320].\nOne main reason for this general paucity in predicting preferences is methodology. While\nthere is a mature field of study about ways to estimate prey preference in one study site [21\u2013 25], there is no method to combine preference estimates from many study sites and then predict preference in a new study site that has a unique combination of prey types.\nThe difficulty in combining prey preferences over many sites arises from the fact that all\nmeasures of preference are relative to the prey items present at individual sites. Just adding or subtracting one prey type may completely change preferences for the other prey; thus, it is difficult to combine preferences among sites that have different types of prey.\nFor example, suppose a predator prefers 4 prey items in this order A>B>C>D. In a site containing only prey items C & D, the predator would select for C. In a site containing prey items A, B, C, the predator would select against C. It is not known how to combine data from those 2 sites to predict selection when all prey are present. One would estimate that both C and B have intermediate selection values but it is not known how to estimate overall preference for B vs C. The problem is much more difficult when 20 prey species exist in 40 different sites.\nPrevious studies have calculated prey preference values for each prey type within each study site, then averaged these individual preference values over all study sites for each prey type [26, 27]. The problem with this is that prey preference estimates within one study site are relative to the prey types present and thus cannot be directly combined with other study sites. Johnson [28] developed a method to combine preferences estimates, but rather than estimating a specific preference, the method estimated a rank for each prey item.\nWe present a method that estimates overall prey preference by combining data over many\nstudy sites, even when not all sites contain all prey items. Our method adjusts for the relative nature of preferences at individual study sites, allowing one to predict feeding preferences in new study sites, or when prey items change. This method also produces estimates of sampling variation, and thus, confidence intervals for preference estimates. We show how to increase precision by weighting the estimates by both prey densities and sampling effort. We then illustrate the method with a simple numerical example and test the method\u2019s accuracy and precision using simulations. Finally, we show an example application using data from lion (Panthera leo) feeding."

However, our method applies to all types of animals, not just predators, and the selected items could be vegetation, or even non-food items, such as types of habitat.

Similarly, the measures of prey consumption can originate by any means (e.g. DNA analysis of stomach contents [34], direct counts of the number of kills [35], or hair identification from scat contents [36]).

The dashes show when the prey type is not present at that site.\n\u00f02\u00de\nStep (ii). We are estimating overall prey preferences iteratively. We start with some initial values of overall prey preference (pi values), and then update these at each iteration k. For the first iteration we choose equal values that sum to 1, and for the kth iteration, we use the averages summed over all sites.\nStep (iii). The \u03b1 values at each site initially sum to 1. These are then scaled to the values you would expect if all prey were at that site\u2014this step is the key to the whole method. This scaling is done because preferences cannot be simply averaged over sites, because at each site they are relative to each other\u2014i.e. they sum to 1, even though some prey are missing. Thus, in order to combine them, we rescale the preferences so that they would sum to 1 if all prey items were present.\nWe calculate this scaling constant by the following. Since all prey items are not present, we replace the missing prey items with the overall prey preference estimates.

Compare the new estimate for overall preference to the one used in step (ii). If\nthere is a change in the estimates, then repeat steps (ii)\u2013(v) with the same initial table of preferences but with the new vector of overall prey preferences. The result is a set of overall preference estimates. These preferences range from 0 to 1 and sum to 1, and the important aspect is their values relative to each other, not their absolute values.\nStep (vii). Ecological estimates should always have a measure of their error [37]. This can\nbe estimated using bootstrapping [38], treating each site as an independent sample. Briefly, this would involve taking a random number of m rows (sampled with replacement) from the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 5 / 19\nmatrix in Eq (2) and then estimating preferences using IPA. This would be repeated many times (typically 1,000\u201310,000) [38], and the mean and standard deviation values calculated from the random sample estimates. After each bootstrapping sample, the preferences should be transformed by arcsine(2 x \u2212 1) (since prey preferences represent a proportion, and proportions are known to have variances that depend on the mean). Then means, variances, and confidence intervals would be estimated. The means and confidence intervals should be backtransformed. Note that bootstrapping is not a replacement for adequate sampling\u2014i.e. since the sampling units are sites, using very few sites will result in low precisions (wide confidence intervals).\nPreliminary simulations showed that using this transformation significantly increased accu-\nracy of the estimates."

Typically these variances are not known, however they are decreased by sampling more predators and in areas of higher prey density.

Note that this can only be done when prey consumption and/or density are estimated by the same methods across all sites.\nPrey consumption effort weighting is carried out as follows.

We calculated those indices for prey types at each site, and then calculated the mean for each prey type over all sites (while ignoring the missing prey types at each site)."

For example, Fig 2 shows the results of a simulation with 100 sites, 6 prey types, 50% of prey types present (varying from 10\u201390%) at each site, and 100 replicates. The averaged preference overestimates preference when preference is low and underestimates when preference is high. The lower precision and accuracy of the averaged estimates show the difficulty of estimating overall preference without considering missing prey types at each site.\nThe IPA estimates are more precise when they are weighted by both prey densities and\nnumber of feeding samples for most combinations of parameters (Fig 3). Confidence intervals for weighted estimates are about 75% narrower than those for unweighted estimates. Weighting is more effective with a large number of sites. The proportion of missing prey types, the number of prey types and number of sites interact to affect precision. Precision is greater with fewer missing prey types, more prey types and more sites.\nAccuracy of bootstrapped estimates of confidence intervals varies with prey characteristics.\nThe proportion of missing prey types, and the number of prey types and sites, all interact to affect accuracy. Generally, accuracy is greater with fewer missing prey types, more prey types, and more sites, for most combinations of parameters (Fig 4). There is little effect of weighting on accuracy. When there are more than 20 prey types, then bootstrapped confidence intervals are slightly too narrow\u2014e.g. when there are less then 0.3 of prey types missing in each site, estimated 95% confidence intervals are actually like 90%."

To display the results, we ranked them according to prey weight and then fitted the general bell-shaped\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 9 / 19\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 10 / 19\nfunction:\npref \u00bc k3e \u00f0wt k1\u00de\n2\nk22 \u00f023\u00de\nwhere k1, k2, k3 = fitted parameters pref = overall prey preference estimated by IPA wt = log(prey weight). Since the preferences are relative to each other, we scaled them so that the maximum function value would be 1\u2014i.e. the preferences are all scaled relative to the maximum. We did not estimate the weighted IPA estimates because prey density and consumption surveys were not carried out in the same manner among sites.\nAnalysing overall preference by prey weights in this way yields several biological insights.\nFirst, we can describe feeding preferences by just using two parameters, representing the mean (k1) and standard deviation of the feeding curve (k2) (NB: not k3, since this is the same for all values of preference). k1 is a measure of average size of prey eaten, and k2 is a measure of feeding specialization (the width of the curve). If other predators fit similar curves, we can use those parameters to compare different predators and to estimate competition among predators living in the same system.\nSecond, we can estimate prey consumption by predators in systems with many prey types.\nTypically, potential prey consumption has been measured by classifying potential prey as either preferred vs non-preferred [42]\u2013this assumes that the only preference choices are completely for or against. We can use this fitted curve to scale densities of each prey type according to preference, in order to get realistic estimates of prey consumption.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 11 / 19\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520.g004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 12 / 19\nFinally, we can identify prey types that merit more research. If overall preference for some prey type significantly deviates from the preference vs size curve, this means that the predator selects for that prey using other properties than just prey size. For example, lions prefer wildebeest (Connochaetes sp) more than any other prey species (Fig 5), and the confidence intervals for preference are outside of the preference vs size curve, showing that wildebeest are preyed upon more often than expected simply due to their size. This is supported by results showing that that wildebeest selection is also affected by rainfall [43]."

But, because the method uses relative preferences, these data do not have to be estimated in the same way among sites\u2014just the same within each site. Thus, one could estimate relative consumption based on scat analysis at one site and stomach contents at another site.\nHowever, using the weighting when estimating sampling variation does somewhat limit\napplication. IPA can use two kinds of weighting: based on prey densities and the total number of feeding samples in a site. Both types of sampling have to be carried out in the same way for all sites.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 13 / 19\nIPA overall preferences may need to be scaled appropriately, depending on how they are\nused. Overall preferences are relative to each other and sum to one. But if one wants to predict preferences in a new site with a more limited set of prey types, then those preferences no longer sum to one. Thus overall preferences need to be scaled according to the prey types available at that site, as follows:\nIf A = the set of prey items that are available in the new site, then the predicted preferences\nfor prey type j in that study site are:\np\u0302jX\nj2A\np\u0302j \u00f024\u00de\nFor example, suppose that there are 10 species, and overall preferences are estimated to be:\n\u00bd0:15; 0:05; 0:2; 0:05; 0:24; 0:2; 0:03; 0:03; 0:01; 0:04\ufffd; \u00f025\u00de\nand the new site has prey species {1,3,4,7,8} present. Then we would scale preferences for those species by 0.15+0.2+0.05+0.03+0.03, and get predicted preferences in the new site as:\n\u00bd0:326; ; 0:435; 0:109; ; ; 0:065; 0:065; ; \ufffd \u00f026\u00de\nThe preferences need to be scaled differently for consumption estimation. In order to estimate overall prey consumption, consumption = preference \u00d7 density, and thus the maximum possible preference would be 1. If you assume that the most preferred prey in that site is effectively always chosen, then you would scale all the preferences by dividing by the maximum value. Using the above example, we would divide the values for those species from (25), by the maximum, 0.2, and get predicted preferences in the new site as:\n\u00bd0:749; ; 1; 0:251; ; ; 0:149; 0:149; ; \ufffd \u00f027\u00de\nTo estimate prey consumption, one would multiply the values in (27) by prey densities."

See S1 Appendix for how IPA can incorporate the Jacobs\u2019 index. These indices differ in many ways [37]:\n1. Manly\u2019s/ ranges from (0,1) and Jacobs\u2019 index from (-1, 1).\n2. \u201cNo preference\" for Manly\u2019s/ is 1/(# of prey types), while for Jacobs\u2019 index it is 0.

Jacob\u2019s index is affected by relative prey densities when there are more then two prey types\n[24, 45]\u2013thus, one can only compare preferences in different situations if prey densities are the same. Manly\u2019s/ is independent of prey densities.\n4. The total of Manly\u2019s/ for all prey types is 1 but there is no constant total for Jacobs\u2019 index.\n5. All preference indices are relative. If preferences are estimated for a large suite of prey\nitems, then one cannot just apply those values directly in a different situation with fewer prey. However Manly\u2019s/ can be re-normalized to take into account the dropping of prey items\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 14 / 19\nIPA uses Manly\u2019s \u03b1 because IPA hinges on scaling the preference measures to those you would expect if all prey types were present in each site (Step 1). The scaling requires that prey preferences range from 0 to 1, and sum to 1 in each site\u2014and Manly\u2019s \u03b1 is the only published index that does this.\nHowever, Manly\u2019s \u03b1 has a weakness in that it is sensitive to variations in densities of rare prey. IPA minimizes this problem in two ways: first, mean preference (Step 3) is weighted by prey density, and second, when estimating sampling error during bootstrapping, the preferences are transformed by arcsine(2 x \u2212 1). On the other hand, Manly\u2019s/ is useful when predicting total biomass of prey consumed\u2014 one simply multiplies Manly\u2019s/ by prey density and body mass. In addition, Manly\u2019s/ is biologically relevant in that it represents the relative probability of eating a prey once it is encountered [23]."

            "heading": "Availability biases",
            "text": "When organism densities are estimated, several availability biases can occur, and these can potentially affect preference estimates. False absences occur when individuals are present but undetected, and false presences occur when individuals are not present but are wrongfully identified to be present [46]. If such biases underestimate prey availability, then preferences are overestimated. However, IPA is only affected indirectly by such biases, since it uses estimates of prey availability, but does not specify how those estimates should be obtained. Thus, prey availability estimates can be made using one of the many density estimation methods that minimize such biases [37].\nEcological differences among sites\nIf important ecological differences exist among sites, then this might affect the accuracy of overall estimates of prey preference, and thus of conservation interventions. There are two ways of dealing with this. First, find out if preferences do differ among sites, by comparing standardized preferences within each site (i.e. step (iv)) to overall preferences. Currently this would be done visually, and thus work is needed to develop statistical tests for this. Sites that are different would then be treated separately. Second, instead of analyzing preference based on prey species, one could use prey weights. Many predators select prey mostly based on size, not prey species [27]. The lion example discussed above illustrates this."

            "heading": "Applications",
            "text": "IPA can be generalized. In the description of IPA, we use the term \u201cprey types\u201d; prey can be categorized in many ways. For example, Lungdoh et al. [44] classified prey using broader taxonomic units than species. Or one might use some features of the prey, such as size or microhabitat use. These features could be revealed using IPA. Then, one could classify prey according to that feature and then use IPA to generate final estimates of overall preference. We can also generalize the resource; IPA can be used for any type of resource, such as habitats or nest sites.\nIn studies of predator-prey relationships, IPA can also be used to estimate overall prey con-\nsumption. Many of the key studies of predator-prey relationships have focused on systems with a limited number of main prey types (for example, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)\u2013lynx (Lynx canadensis) system [47] and the wolf (Canis lupus) -moose (Alces alces) system [48]), because it is difficult to estimate overall prey consumption when there are many prey types. When researchers have studied systems with many prey types, they have had to make simplifying assumptions. For example, Lindsey et al. [49] compared cheetah (Acinonyx\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268520 June 3, 2022 15 / 19\njubatus) prey requirements in 12 South African game reserves in order to manage re-introductions of cheetah. To combine data from many sites, the researchers had to focus on only the two most important prey types. Using IPA, we can estimate relative prey preferences for all prey types and thus combine them into one overall measure of prey consumption. Also, if we include prey weight, we can estimate overall biomass of prey consumed. This flexibility will make it easier to build predator-prey models with many varied prey types.\nOne can use IPA to test hypotheses about factors that affect prey preference. The type of\ntest depends on whether the factors are inherent properties of the prey types or ones that can vary among sites. For example, some properties that are inherent are handling time, risk of injury during capture, taste and size of the prey [41]. Some properties that vary among sites are types of habitats, and prey abundance and diversity [41]. Using IPA, we can test for the inherent properties by comparing overall estimated preferences among different prey types. A strength of using IPA to do this is that estimating preferences over many sites ensures that effects of the varying properties should average out. Thus, the more, and different, sites, the better.\nWe can test for the varying properties by analyzing the differences between estimated and\nobserved preferences for each prey type and site. IPA preferences are estimated under the assumption of constant preferences among sites, and thus can be viewed as a null hypothesis. Models can be tested predicting the differences between estimated and observed preferences as a function of prey density, prey diversity, or various habitat features. This allows us to test hypotheses that had previously been limited to a narrow range of study sites. For example, Prugh [7] showed that coyotes (Canis latrans) change prey preference in response to changes in snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) density. Such comparisons were possible because Prugh worked within one study site over several years, with a relatively constant number of prey types. Such an analysis can now be carried out using IPA over a wide range of study sites that differ in prey types. As of July 2019, there are at least 109 studies of coyote feeding habits that could be used in such a comparison.\nApplication of IPA allows us to: test hypotheses about what factors affect prey selection,\npredict preferences in new sites, and estimate overall prey consumption in new sites. The method\u2019s robust flexibility could lead to a general theory of feeding preference that will allow us to understand and predict food choice."
