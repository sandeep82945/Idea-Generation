The horizontal laser cavities are 20\u2212 60 \u00b5m long GaN etched ridge structures with vertical Bragg reflectors. We investigate the laser threshold under optical pumping and assess quantitatively the effect of a varying optically-pumped length. The laser effect is achieved for an exciton reservoir length of just 15% of the cavity length, which would not be possible in a conventional ridge laser, with an inversionless polaritonic gain about 10 times larger than in equivalent GaN lasers. This combination of a very short injection section and a strong gain paves the way to compact microlasers with nonlinear functionalities for integrated photonics.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThere are two conditions required for a laser to operate. The first is population inversion for a given electronic transition, so that the emission of the electronic system at the lasing frequency overcomes absorption, which can eventually vanish if the electronic system is fully inverted. In any case, the gain of the fully inverted system cannot exceed the maximal absorption, as prescribed by the well-known Einstein relations relating the rates of absorption and stimulated emission [1, 2]. The second condition for lasing to occur is that gain overcomes the losses, essentially the decay rate of the photonic cavity constituting the laser.\nPolariton lasers [3\u20135] are coherent emitters based on hybrid quasi-particles arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons, so-called excitonpolaritons. They are by construction close to the socalled exciton lasers introduced in the seventies to explain laser-like emission in certain semiconductors such as ZnO [6]. Their putative advantage over conventional lasers is that they do not require population inversion, but only that the net spontaneous scattering rate from an excitonic reservoir overcomes the decay rate of the polariton mode. Following the proposal of a polariton laser without population inversion [3], the demonstration of polariton lasing [7] was initially described and discussed in terms of cavity losses and an effective polaritonic gain. The focus was later brought to a thermodynamic description in terms of polariton condensation in the ground state of a cavity polariton system [8, 9] and, ultimately, to the competition between kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the condensation process [10\u201314]. One should\n\u2217 Hassen.Souissi@umontpellier.fr \u2020 Thierry.Guillet@umontpellier.fr\nnotice that photon condensation can also be realized in large area surface emitting lasers [15], or by relaxing the population inversion condition in a molecular media with large Stokes shift between emission and absorption [16]. Back to polariton lasers, the most striking evidence of an operation regime without population inversion is the observation of two successive lasing thresholds: polariton lasing and lasing with population inversion [17, 18] [19, 20].\nThe polariton waveguide geometry has been explored for about a decade [21\u201330]. In the context of the current work, it presents the advantage to allow a selective excitation of only a part of the horizontal optical cavity confining the laser mode and revisit, thereby, laser interpretative frameworks, such as the balance between gain in the excited section and absorption.\nIn this work we study GaN-based deep-ridge waveguides delimited by GaN/air distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) and supporting polariton modes. The laser devices display a design very similar to the most common ridge semiconductor lasers, including recent InGaNbased devices [31], however with much shorter cavities. We observe that lasing occurs while pumping only 15% of the cavity length, i.e. much less than half of a cavity filled with an homogeneous active medium. This demonstrates the absence of reciprocity between gain and absorption in our system and represents an alternative and very clear demonstration of the occurrence of polariton lasing. An important outcome of injection sections displaying much stronger gain is the potential reduction of the devices footprint, which is of paramount importance in photonic integration. Furthermore, these polaritonic waveguides benefit from photonic nonlinearities orders of magnitude larger than in conventional nonlinear media due to polaritons dipolar interactions [28\u201330], opening the door for cointegration of laser sources and nonlinear functionalities (e.g modulation). ar X iv :2 20 1.\n04 34\n8v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n7 O\nct 2\n02 2\n2"

            "text": "In order to assess the strong coupling regime between photons and excitons, the most direct method would\n3\nbe to monitor the dispersion of polaritons using diffraction gratings on top of the core layer. This geometry was exploited for polariton waveguides based on GaAs [21, 26], GaN [23, 32], and ZnO [25]. It allowed measuring the lower polariton branch (LPB) dispersion and observing the anticrossing between lower and upper polariton branches (UPB). For laser cavities, in order to avoid the losses associated to such gratings, we can measure and model the cavity FSR (Fig. 3(a)), which is equal to (Lcav/\u03c0) \u2202ELPB/\u2202\u03b2, where ELPB(\u03b2) is the polariton dispersion (Fig. 3(b)). This method has been previously implemented in order to assess the strong coupling regime in the case of ZnO-nanowires [33, 34], and ZnO polaritonic waveguides (Supplemental Material in Ref. 25). Figure 3(a) compares the FSRs extracted from the FP transmission spectra, below and above threshold to the FSRs extracted from calculated dispersions for the LPB and bare photonic mode, i.e. in the absence of strong-coupling (see Appendices C and D for details on calculations). The agreement between experimental and calculated FSR dispersions is obtained for the TE0 mode strongly coupled to excitons, with a reduction of the oscillator strength of 30% below threshold (0.1 and 0.2 \u00d7 Pth), and 40% above threshold (P = 1.66 \u00d7 Pth). This result demonstrates the operation in the strong coupling regime, with a slight diminution of the excitonic oscillator strength below threshold that could be related to a degradation of the structural and optical quality of the GaN active material during the deep-etching of the ridge. The zero-detuning condition (\u03b4 = 0) is realized at an LPB energy of 3.459 eV , and the exciton-\nphoton coupling strength (Rabi splitting) amounts to \u2126Rabi = 66 \u00b1 10 meV (Fig. 3(b)) . The observed lasing mode lies close to zero-detuning, corresponding to an estimated exciton fraction of 40% (Fig. 3(c))."

The energy-dependent FSR and finesse of the Fabry-Perot cavity are important to assess the strong coupling regime and the value of the total losses \u03b1t.\nThe Fabry-Perot transmission is obtained by normalizing the PL spectrum to its envelope. Due to our collection scheme (perpendicular to the waveguide plane), the very strong spontaneous emission of the exciton reservoir under the excitation spot also contributes to the signal collected at the DBRs, even if far apart. The FP transmission can be fitted by the expression:\nTFP (\u03bb) = C + (1\u2212 C). 1\n1 +K. sin2(2\u03c0.ng(\u03bb). Lcav \u03bb + \u03d50)\n(1)\nwhere ng(\u03bb) = \u03d1g c is the group index, \u03d1g is the group velocity, \u03d50 is the adjustment phase, C corresponds to\n4 the background PL of the exciton reservoir and K is the coefficient of finesse. The fit of the experimental spectra at two different energies at negative detuning is presented in the Figures 4(a,b). The finesse F of the cavity can be deduced from the coefficient of finesse K.\nF = \u2206\u03bb \u03bb = \u03c0\n2.arcsin( 1\u221a K\n) (2)\nThe finesse of the FP modes strongly depends on the energy.

They can be decomposed into three contributions:\n\u03b1t = \u03b1cav + \u03b1pol + \u03b1noX .\nThe cavity losses \u03b1cav = \u03b1i + \u03b1m include the internal losses \u03b1i (absorption by defects, roughness-induced losses) and the mirror losses \u03b1m = \u2212ln(RDBR)/Lcav resulting from the finite DBR reflectivity RDBR. The losses without excitons \u03b1noX and the polariton losses \u03b1pol are deduced from the simulations based on the ElliottTanguy susceptibility (Appendix D, [32]). The three contributions are represented in Figure 4(c). The cavity losses \u03b1cav = 250 cm\n\u22121 provide a significant contribution to the total losses only at large negative detunings. We can estimate a lower bound of the DBR reflectivity RDBR = 0.6 if we neglect internal losses and therefore attribute all cavity losses to the mirrors.\nAbove 3.45 eV , the intrinsic contribution of polariton losses \u03b1pol increases and degrades the cavity finesse (Fig. 2(a)), so that the FP transmission exhibits almost sinusoidal oscillations. This prevents a proper fit of their lineshape, so that the finesse cannot be experimentally determined in this energy range corresponding to zero and positive exciton-photon detunings. However, the good quantitative agreement between experimental and simulated total losses at negative detuning (red square dots and dark green curve in Figure 4(c)) allows estimating the total losses at the lasing energy of about 1000 \u00b1100 cm\u22121 (open red square). This value is chosen as the polaritonic gain in our model of the gain versus pump length, in the case of a polaritonic laser (Fig. 6(b), green rectangle).

One can see that below threshold the Fabry-Perot modes do not appear, preventing the proper demonstration of the strong coupling at this high temperature. Still, the laser effect is maintained. The temperature increase has two notorious effects: the first impact is to shift the optimum detuning (i.e. that for which the relaxation rate is maximum) towards more and more negative values; this can be easily understood, since at higher temperatures polaritons thermalize more efficiently along the LPB and are thus able to reach more negative detunings. The second and most important effect is that the laser threshold displays a large increase with temperature, presently preventing CW lasing action up to 300 K, as shown in Figure 5(d)."

The gain is fed by the exciton reservoir in a polariton laser, so that the gain length can be estimated from the spatial profile of the exciton reservoir. The measured size of the exciton reservoir is slightly larger than the length of the excitation spot, which is a signature of a 1 \u2212 3 \u00b5m spatial diffusion of the excitons independent of the excitation power in the investigated power range (Appendix E).\nThe dependence of the spatially integrated laser power at threshold (p (i) th ) versus the gain length Lgain (Fig. 6(a)) presents similar scaling laws for the Lcav = 20 \u00b5m and 60 \u00b5m.

The decay rate \u0393k accounts for both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates. The decay of polaritons through the mirrors affects the spatial propagation terms at the boundaries of the system. The pumping term Pk,r is characterized by the size of the pumping spot in real space, whereas in reciprocal space it creates a thermalized distribution of excitons within the reservoir due to the relatively rapid formation of excitons from the injected electron-hole pairs. The scattering rates Wk\u2192k\u2032,r account for both exciton-exciton and exciton-phonon scattering mechanisms.

            "text": "In a conventional ridge laser, lasing action appears due to the reciprocity between absorption and stimulated emission, and requires to achieve a population inversion in the electron and hole bands: the maximum available gain at a given energy is the product of the absorption at zero carrier density and the difference between the FermiDirac distributions in the conduction and valence bands:\n\u03b3e\u2212h = \u03b10\u00d7(fc\u2212fv) [39]; this gain is smaller than \u03b10, and asymptotically equal at T = 0. In a segmented laser with a gain section smaller than the full cavity, the gain and loss terms in both pumped and unpumped sections are compared in Table I, and the threshold condition writes:\ne\u22122(\u03b1m+\u03b1i).Lcav .e\u22122\u03b10.(Lcav\u2212Lgain).e2\u03b3e\u2212h,th.Lgain = 1,\nwhere \u03b3e\u2212h,th is the electron-hole modal gain at threshold. Assuming \u03b3e\u2212h,th = \u03b10, i.e. in the T = 0 limit, we have:\n\u03b3e\u2212h,th = (\u03b1m + \u03b1i).Lcav 2Lgain \u2212 Lcav = \u03b1cav.Lcav 2Lgain \u2212 Lcav (5)\nLasing action in a conventional ridge laser is obtained if more than half of the cavity is excited (Fig. 6(b), dotted line).\nIn the case of a polariton laser, the polariton losses \u03b1pol and the losses without excitons \u03b1noX are expected in the whole cavity, i.e. even in the gain section. Moreover, the gain originates from the stimulated relaxation from the pumped exciton reservoir to the lasing polariton mode, illustrating that the polariton gain and the polariton losses are not correlated. The condition of laser oscillations at threshold writes:\ne\u22122(\u03b1m+\u03b1i).Lcav .e\u22122(\u03b1noX+\u03b1pol).Lcav .e2\u03b3pol,th.Lgain = 1,\nwhich leads to the expression of the polariton gain at threshold:\n\u03b3pol,th = (\u03b1m + \u03b1i + \u03b1noX + \u03b1pol).Lcav Lgain = \u03b1t.Lcav Lgain (6)\nThe equation (6) allows estimating the polariton gain from the previous analysis of the cavity losses. The modelled total losses \u03b1t have been validated at negative detuning from the analysis of the finesse of the FP cavity, and then extrapolated to the lasing energy. At threshold, the deduced modal gain is shown on the Figure 6(b) (plain line) as a function of the gain length. For a realistic comparison of the polariton and conventional lasing schemes, only the cavity losses are considered for the conventional ridge lasers (indicated in orange), the gain being of the same order of magnitude of the one measured for analogous nitride ridge lasers [31]. Instead, both cavity and polariton losses (indicated in green) are considered in the case of the polariton laser. Our analysis explains why a polariton laser does not require at least\n7 half of the cavity to be pumped, and provides a clear experimental evidence of this striking feature specific to polariton lasers.\nFinally, the polaritonic gain at a given laser threshold is shown in the Figure 6(c), based on the experimental data for both Lcav = 20 \u00b5m and 60 \u00b5m: the two corresponding gain curves are superimposed. It is worth noting that a record modal gain of 6600 cm\u22121 is reached for a short pump length. For a proper comparison with conventional ridge lasers pumped over the full cavity, it is necessary to consider the gain extrapolated for a large pump length (1000 cm\u22121). In an early GaN laser diode, a modal gain of about 400\u2212600 cm\u22121 was initially deduced from experiments [40]. More recently, in order to reach a laser operation in short cavities (Lcav = 45\u2212 280 \u00b5m) with high-reflectivity dielectric DBRs, a modal gain less than 100 cm\u22121 has been extracted [31]. The polariton laser therefore provides a strong increase of the gain for comparable geometry and length."

A laser threshold of the order of few hundreds of kW.cm\u22122 is reached, with a large gain allowing for shorter cavities compared to standard ridge GaN lasers. Beyond the demonstration of lasing, we have assessed the robustness of the strong coupling regime by comparing the cavity FSR to polariton dispersions based on the Elliott-Tanguy model [32]. We demonstrate polariton laser operation up to 150 K. The laser operates on a polaritonic mode with a large exciton Hopfield factor (40%), allowing to exploit strong nonlinearities for an intra-cavity control of the laser dynamics. Most important, we experimentally demonstrated how a ridge polariton laser is different from a standard ridge laser. By monitoring the threshold as a function of the optical pumping length, i.e. the size of the exciton reservoir, we illustrate that a polariton laser can operate with a reservoir (i.e. a gain region) covering only 15% of the full cavity, versus a theoretical lower bound of 50% for the pump length of a conventional laser. This experimental observation agrees quantitatively with simulations based on semiclassical Boltzmann equations for polaritons.\nThe improvement of the available gain by one order of magnitude allows for much shorter laser cavities, while the reduced pump length provides the opportunity to combine additionnal functionalities within the cavity, such as tunable absorbers or couplers for sensing or signal modulation, or topological photonic patterns, in a broad set of polaritonic materials including GaAs, ZnO, perovskites and transition metal dichalcogenides."
