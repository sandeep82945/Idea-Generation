    "abstractText": "Processing chaotic signals is a complicated task due to their nonlinear and non-periodical properties. Conventional linear filters do not allow to properly denoise signals generated by chaotic systems, distorting the carrier while removing the noise, which is critical for such applications as coherent chaotic communications. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising algorithm, called Ensemble Intrinsic TimeScale Decomposition (EITD) using specific chaotic noise generators. We may use specific chaotic noise generators in the known Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), as we also show. Considering the examples of R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz systems as chaotic waveforms generators, we compare the developed algorithm modifications with other filtration algorithms using ITD and EMD. We use the root-mean-square error (RMSE) as a metric to estimate the denoising quality. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range \u221210...20 dB is examined, and white, pink and chaotic noise generators are utilized to disturb signals under study. As a result, we explicitly show that the developed approach provides the error 2-10 times less in the case of white and pink noise, and is capable of denoising chaotic signals in case of all the considered types of noises, in contrast to Conventional and Iterative ITD and EMD algorithms.

INTRODUCTION\nIN recent decades, chaotic signals have been widely usedin the various scientific fields such as chaotic communication [1]\u2013[4], cryptography [5], radars [6], sonars [7], various sensors [8] etc. This type of non-periodic signal often possesses a non-stationarity and broadband spectrum. One of the unique properties of chaotic signals is non-repeatability, which significantly complicates their processing. Coherent chaotic communication systems are especially noise-suffered [9], and the development of denoising algorithms [10] is relevant for this scientific area. Since chaotic signals demonstrate a noise-like behavior, linear filters are no longer useful for this task. Therefore, denoising chaotic time series or extracting chaotic time series from a mixture with a noise\ncomponent becomes a major problem. The performance of any denoising algorithm depends on the amount of information about the signal available. Many approaches are proposed to reduce or clean the noise present in this class of non-linear signals. In [11], [12], an original discrete-time Kalman filtering implementation is proposed to estimate the states of chaotic signals with white noise. Kalman filtering is a state-space estimator that provides recursive minimum mean-squared error estimates for linear systems embedded in Gaussian noise. The latter cannot be used directly to estimate non-linear state space models. Therefore, an approximate solution is required which allows the extension of the Kalman filtering framework to nonlinear state-space models, as is done in the referred studies.

Denoising algorithms based on EMD [13], [14] are widely used in many applications: medicine, seismology, hydroacoustics, radio monitoring, etc. [15]\u2013[18]. Our research team presents new denoising algorithms based on ITD [19] in the context of chaotic signal processing. We study the proposed algorithms on a set of test chaotic signals noised with various noise generators, including chaotic ones, and compare denoising results with other algorithms based on EMD. The novelty and contribution of the paper are as follows:\n\u2022 we applied our recently developed denoising algorithms based on ITD (Ensemble ITD, Conventional ITD and Iterative ITD) to a new class of complicated non-linear signals, namely, chaotic signals, and explored the possibility of their filtering from standard types of noise (white and pink); \u2022 in addition, we investigate the possibility of denoising chaotic signals from sources of chaotic noise.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we consider the concept of decomposition into internal timescale components. Section III describes filtering algorithms based on this concept. In Section IV, we consider chaotic signals and noise generators under study. Section V describes the results obtained. Section VI concludes the paper.\nII. INTRINSIC TIME-SCALE DECOMPOSITION ITD \u2013 an iterative algorithm for decomposition of the original signal into high-frequency (\"proper rotation\", Ht) and lowfrequency (\"baseline signal\", Lt) components [20]:\nL0t = Xt = L D t + D\u2211 j=1 Hjt ;L j t = L j+1 t +H j+1 t ; j = 0...D\n(1) Let there be a signal Xt . We define an operator L that extracts the low-frequency component (\"baseline signal\") from the signal in such a way that the remainder is the highfrequency component (\"proper rotation\"). Then the signal Xt can be written as follows:\nXt = LXt + (1\u2212 L)Xt = Lt +Ht (2)\nLt = LXt \u2013 \"baseline signal\"; Ht = (1\u2212L)Xt \u2013 \"proper rotation\".\nLet there be a signal {Xt, t \u2265 0} and {\u03c4k, k = 1, 2, ...} its local extremes. Introduce the notation: X(\u03c4k) \u2261 Xk and L(\u03c4k) \u2261 Lk.\nThen:\nLXt = Lt = Lk+ (\nLk+1 \u2212 Lk Xk+1 \u2212Xk\n) (Xt\u2212Xk), t \u2208 {\u03c4k, \u03c4k+1}\n(3) where:\nLk+1 = \u03b1 [ Xk + ( \u03c4k+1 \u2212 \u03c4k \u03c4k+2 \u2212 \u03c4k ) (Xk+2 \u2212Xk) ] +(1\u2212\u03b1)Xk+1\n(4) where: 0 < \u03b1 < 1 \u2013 parameter. We define an operator H that extracts the high-frequency component (\"proper rotation\") from the signal. After excluding the trend, we can calculate the remainder:\nHXt \u2261 (1\u2212 L)Xt = Ht = Xt \u2212 Lt (5)\nFig.1 (a, b) shows the operation of the EMD and ITD algorithms, accordingly. The source signal is denoted as the \"raw signal\". It is noticed that the ITD algorithm allows the decomposition of the signal into a lower number of more stable components in comparison with the EMD algorithm. Edge effects in EMD are due to spline interpolation, and a significantly longer runtime is due to the sifting. The ITD algorithm does not have these features and can operate in real-time [20].\nFig.1 (d, e) presents the operation of the EMD and ITD algorithms, accordingly. The initial signal is shown in Fig. 1 (c). It is noticed that the ITD algorithm does not introduce additional distortions in comparison with the EMD algorithm. ITD allows detecting local features (the original signal, in this case, has a series of bursts in the area of 300-350 sec) with high accuracy relative to the EMD algorithm [20]."

DENOISING SIGNALS USING ITD Based on the solutions for filtering signals from noise using EMD [13]\u2013[16] (Ensemble EMD \u2013 EEMD [17], Conventional EMD \u2013 CEMD [18], [21] and Iterative EMD \u2013 IEMD [18]), the research team developed new algorithms for filtering signals from noise Ensemble ITD \u2013 EITD, Conventional ITD \u2013 CITD and Iterative ITD \u2013 IITD [19]. Below we will give a brief mathematical description of them. A thorough comparison with other methodologies, including wavelet analysis, was given in [22].\nA. ENSEMBLE ITD (EITD) Idea. The algorithm consists in sifting an ensemble of signals with the addition of additive white Gaussian noise. The average value for the ensemble of implementations of each EM is considered a solution. Since EITD is a TFE analysis method, the added white noise is averaged with a sufficient number of implementations; the only constant part that withstands the averaging process is the true useful signal. With the help of an ensemble mean, it is possible to naturally divide the scales without any a priori choice of a subjective criterion. This new approach takes full advantage of the statistical characteristics of white noise to distort the signal in its true neighborhood of the solution and to cancel it after completing the task. EITD is a significant improvement over the original ITD and is a method of data analysis using noise: noise-assisted data analysis (NADA).\nAlgorithm\n1) Adding a noise implementation \u03b7i(t) to the original signal x(t):\nzi(t) = x(t) + \u03b7i(t) (6)\n2) Signal zi(t) decomposition using the ITD algorithm. 3) Repeating steps 1 and 2 for i = 1, 2, ..., NE and\nobtaining EM sets {cpi}; p = 1...M ; i = 1...NE; p \u2013 mode number; M \u2013 number of modes; i \u2013 noise implementation number; NE \u2013 number of noise implementations.

CONVENTIONAL ITD (CITD) The main idea of the method is as follows. Initially, the attempt to use ITD as a noise reduction tool arose from the need to know whether a particular mode contains useful\ninformation or is noise. Thus, the procedures for checking the significance of EM were developed on the basis of statistical analysis of EM obtained as a result of the decomposition of signals consisting of white Gaussian noise. The concept underlying the above significance verification procedure is quite simple and at the same time convincing. If the energy of EM noise is known, then in reality, if the signal contains both useful information and noise, a significant discrepancy between the energy of EM noise and the energy of the corresponding EM mixture of noise and useful signal indicates the presence of useful information. In the noise reduction problem, this causes the signal to be restored using only those EM that contain useful information and discarding those EM that carry mainly noise (modes that share the same amount of energy with the corresponding case only for noise).\nIn practice, pure noise is never available for applying ITD and estimating EM energies, so the usefulness of the abovementioned method depends on whether it is possible to estimate the energy of pure noise modes directly based on the actual noisy signal. The latter usually takes place due to the characteristic feature of ITD. In addition to the first purely noise EM, the power spectra of other EM exhibit self-similar characteristics similar to those that manifest themselves in any structure of the dyadic filter bank. As a result, the EM energies Ep should decrease linearly on a semi-logarithmic diagram, for example, log2Ep relative to p. It also turns out that the first EM carries a large amount of energy.\nWe will consider white Gaussian noise.\nAlgorithm\n1) The algorithm is based on the assumption that the energy of \"purely noise\" EM decreases according to the law:\nE\u0302p = E\u03021\n0.719 2.01\u2212p, p = 2, 3, 4, ... (9)\nHere: p \u2013 EM number; E\u0302p \u2013 EM energy. 2) The denoised signal can be written in the following\nform:\nx\u0303(t) = M\u2211 p=1 cp|Ep>E\u0302p(t) + r(t) (10)\nI.e., only those EM whose energy exceeds (due to the presence of a useful signal) the energy of \"purely noise\" EM are summed up.\nC. ITERATIVE ITD (IITD) The direct application of threshold processing of EM values like noise reduction using wavelet coefficients is impossible and can have disastrous consequences in terms of the continuity of the restored signal. This arises as a result of the special attributes possessed by EM, namely, they resemble a sinusoid with AM/FM modulation with a zero mean value. As a result, this ensures that even in the absence of noise, in any interval \u03c7(i)j = [\u03c7 (i) j , ..., \u03c7 (i) j+1], the absolute value of the\nVOLUME 4, 2016 3\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In other words, based on the absolute amplitude of isolated EM, it is impossible to conclude whether they correspond to noise or a useful signal. However, we can guess whether the interval \u03c7(i)j is dominant by noise or dominant by a signal based on a single extremum c(i)(r(i)j ), which corresponds to this interval. If there is no signal, the absolute value of this extreme will be below the threshold value. Alternatively, if there is a strong signal, the extreme value is expected to exceed the threshold value. Moreover, since noise and signal have the same bandwidth in each EM, signal dominance is highly likely to be extended to all EM samples related to a certain interval between zero crossings.\nBased on shift-invariant threshold processing of wavelet coefficients, in which several versions of the signal under consideration with remote noise are iteratively obtained in order to increase noise resistance by averaging, it is possible to develop an ITD-based noise reduction method that uses a similar principle. Note once again that the direct application of shift-invariant noise reduction does not work in the case of ITD. In the case of ITD, the main processing components, the extremes, depend on the signal, which leads to fixed relative positions of the extremes with respect to the signal when the latter is shifted. As a result, the ITD of the shifted versions of the noisy signal corresponds to the ITD of the corresponding ones shifted by the same amount. Therefore, noise averaging cannot be achieved in this way.\nDifferent versions of the signal with remote noise in the case of ITD can only be constructed from different versions of EM after threshold processing. Inevitably, this is only possible by decomposing various noisy versions of the signal itself. Thus, the problem in question boils down to the following question: how, having a signal hidden in the noise, you can create various noisy versions of the actual signal without noise. The answer stems from the ITD concept using the characteristics of the first EM. It is known that in the conditions of white Gaussian noise, the first EM is mainly noise. By circularly shifting a random number of samples of the first IMF, and then adding the resulting noise signal to the sum of the remaining IMF, we get another noisy version of the original signal. In fact, if the first EM consists only of noise, then the total noise variance of the newly generated noise signal coincides with the initial value.\nAlgorithm\n1) Signal z(t) decomposition using the ITD algorithm. 2) Partial reconstruction:\nzp(t) = M\u2211 i=2 c(i)(t) + r(t) (11)\n3) Random cyclic shift of the 1st EM counts:\nc(1)a (t) = CIRCSHIFT (c (1)(t)) (12)\n4) Complete reconstruction:\nza(t) = zp(t) + c (1) a (t) (13)\n5) Signal za(t) decomposition using the ITD algorithm. 6) Performing interval threshold processing of the EM\nsignal za(t):\nc\u0303(i)(\u03c7 (i) j ) =\n{ c(i)(\u03c7\n(i) j ), |c(i)(r (i) j )| > Ti\n0, |c(i)(r(i)j )| \u2264 Ti (14)\nHere: c(i) \u2013 EM with a number i; \u03c7(i)j = [\u03c7\n(i) j , ..., \u03c7 (i) j+1], \u03c7 (i) j , \u03c7 (i) j+1; \u2013 EM zeros; r (i) j \u2013 EM extremum on the interval \u03c7(i)j ; Ti \u2013 threshold.

NOISE GENERATORS In this paper, we consider the following noise generators:\n1) Gaussian white noise; 2) Pink noise; 3) R\u00f6ssler system; 4) Lorenz system. The noise generator based on the R\u00f6ssler system has the following set of parameters a = 0.1, b = 0.1, c = 14. Since we are considering an interfering signal, it should be very different from the filtered signal by some criterion. As such an estimate, we can apply the quantitative return map analysis (QRMA) proposed in [26].\nSimulation parameters are as follows: integration step h = 0.01, simulation time T = 1000 sec. According to this criterion, the signal of the R\u00f6ssler system with parameters a = 0.1, b = 0.1, c = 14 differs by 100% from the denoised signal (see Figure 2).\nThe noise generator based on the Lorentz system has the parameters indicated in 18.\nAgain, these types of oscillators were chosen because of their prevalence in the field of chaotic communication. The admixture of a chaotic oscillator as noise to the signal of another chaotic oscillator can be considered crosstalk, which is relevant for the open transmission of chaotic messages through media in radio or acoustic communications."

All noises were normalized to achieve the same SNR -10 dB.\nFigure 4 illustrates the performance of the denoising algorithms based on EMD and ITD. The Lorenz chaotic signal is considered as an example at SNR = -10 dB and white noise as a disturbance. The black line shows the original chaotic waveform. One may see that EEMD and EITD restore the signal most accurately, with slight high-frequency noise left. Results by CEMD are much more inaccurate, but still an original waveform is recognizable. Other algorithms \u2013 IEMD, CITD, IITD \u2013 show low performance and are practically inapplicable for the task.\nAnalysis of the algorithms\u2019 performance at different SNR levels is presented in Figures 5 and 6. In the case of white and pink noise EEMD and EITD both show the best accuracy, 2- 10 times better than other considered algorithms, with the exponential decay of error as SNR linearly increases. In the case of R\u00f6ssler noise generator, all algorithms except ensemble ones (EEMD and EITD) show an inability to appropriately perform the denoising task. In the case of the Lorenz noise generator, iterative algorithms (IITD and IEMD) provide insufficient results, other methods are approximately equal. According to the results, we may range the methods in the following order:\n1) EITD: most accurate and fast; 2) EEMD: also accurate, but computationally less effi-\ncient [19]; 3) CITD: shows the second denoising accuracy; 4) CEMD, IITD, IEMD: less accurate or even inapplica-\nble in most cases. The same performance test was conducted for the Lorenz system. The list above is generally applicable to the achieved results.\nNote that root-mean-square error (RMSE) between original and denoised signal is given in Figures in absolute values.\nThere is an important remark that all algorithms based on EMD and ITD have many parameters, but in this paper,\nVOLUME 4, 2016 5\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Parameter optimization was not the aim of this work, but with another set of parameters, one could probably achieve better results for outsider methods. However, this does not diminish the positive qualities of the developed algorithm, which works well with default parameters.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose a novel denoising algorithm, EITD, in the application of chaotic signals denoising, and compare it with EMD and ITD-based denoising algorithms. We experimentally found that EITD gives more preferable results in most cases. The quality of noise reduction with the use of EITD is also superior and 2-10 times higher for white and pink noise than when applying other methods. Considering the Lorenz system, SNR = 0 dB and white noise, the normalized RMSE of the denoised signal would be 25% by EITD and EEMD, 75% by CITD, 120% by CEMD, and even higher by IEMD and IITD. The explanation lies in the fact that the noise is averaged in it, no matter what generator of noise \u2013 white, pink, R\u00f6ssler or Lorenz is used; thus, it decomposes the signal into more stable components, and also works faster [19]. Compared with our method, EEMD also performs denoising at a high accuracy level but is not computationally efficient. CITD also demonstrated acceptable denoising efficiency. CEMD, IITD, and IEMD do not always work correctly, but we suppose that there is a possibility to improve their performance by adjusting the parameters.\nThe application of the proposed algorithms will help to improve coherent chaotic communication systems in terms of increasing the resistance to noise in the channel, which is a complicated task due to the noise-like spectrum of chaotic signals. With the developed algorithms, the transmitted chaotic signal will be closer to the original chaotic waveform, which will improve the quality of synchronization between two chaotic oscillators, resulting in a lower bit error rate. Implementation of ITD in the coherent chaotic communication system is the aim of our further research. Other application fields will also be considered.\nREFERENCES [1] Jun-Liang Yao, Yu-Zhe Sun, Hai-Peng Ren, and Celso Grebogi. Experi-\nmental wireless communication using chaotic baseband waveform.
