    "abstractText": "The modification of polymer chain ends is important in order to produce highly functional polymers. A novel chain-end modification of polymer iodides (Polymer-I) via reversible complexationmediated polymerization (RCMP) with different functionalized radical generation agents, such as azo compounds and organic peroxides, was developed. This reaction was comprehensively studied for three different polymers, i.e., poly (methyl methacrylate), polystyrene and poly (n-butyl acrylate) (PBA), two different functional azo compounds with aliphatic alkyl and carboxy groups, three different functional diacyl peroxides with aliphatic alkyl, aromatic, and carboxy groups, and one peroxydicarbonate with an aliphatic alkyl group. The reaction mechanism was probed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The combination of PBA-I, iodine abstraction catalyst and different functional diacyl peroxides enabled higher chain-end modification to desired moieties from the diacyl peroxide. The dominant key factors for efficiency in this chain-end modification mechanism were the combination rate constant and the amount of radicals generated per unit of time.",

            "text": "The modification of polymer chain-ends, in addition to main chains and side chains, is important in order to produce highly functional polymers. Fox et al. first investigated the relationship between the number of polymer chain-ends and the glass transition temperature (Tg) and discovered that lower-molecular-weight polymers, which have more high-mobility chain-ends, have a lower Tg [1]. Since this discovery, many researchers have studied the effects of polymer chain-ends on physical properties. Polymer chain-ends are classified into two chemical moieties, i.e., non-functional and functional groups. For polymers with non-functional groups as chainends, surface orientation [2], self-organization [3], and intermolecular interactions [4,5] have been reported to improve the physical properties of the polymers. For polymers with functional chain-ends, so-called telechelic polymers, interfacial adhesion [6] and particle dispersibility [7] have been reported. Among the methods to modify polymer chain-ends, living polymerization is one of the most effective since it enables not only the control of chain-end groups but also gives a narrow molecular weight distribution, allowing more uniform functionality. Reversibledeactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) with different reversible activation mechanisms has also been reported [8]. RDRP methods include nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) [9] with a dissociation-combination (DC) mechanism, organotellurium-mediated\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15122667 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 2 of 17\nliving radical polymerization (TERP) [10] and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) [11] with degenerative chain transfer (DT) mechanisms, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) [12] and reversible complexation-mediated polymerization (RCMP) [13] with atom transfer (AT) mechanisms, and reversible chain transfer catalyzed polymerization (RTCP) [14] with a reversible chain transfer (RT) mechanism. In these RDRP systems, a functionalized alkyl group of the RDRP initiator is transferred to the \u03b1-position chain-end of the polymer, and a dormant group of the initiator is transferred to the \u03c9-position chain-end. This dormant \u03c9-position chain-end limits the applications of the resulting polymer due to toxicity, coloration, odor or low thermal stability. Therefore, many studies on the removal and modification of dormant chain-ends have been conducted, such as radical-induced reduction [15\u201317] using nucleophilic agents, photoinduction [18], thermal decomposition [19], and reduction [20]. For simultaneous removal and modification of dormant chain-ends, chain-end modification of thiol groups [21] and various functional groups [22] using nucleophilic substitution reactions, hydroxyl groups using an oxidizing agent [23], maleimide groups using radical addition-fragmentation coupling reactions [24] and azido and (meth) acryloyl groups [25] using a click reaction have been reported. Previous reports on the simultaneous removal and modification of dormant chain-ends showed highly efficient chain-end modification (more than about 90%) [21,23\u201325]. However, there are problems such as limitations on the functional groups that can be introduced [21,23] and side reactions such as cyclization [24]. Unfortunately, highly efficient modification of dormant \u03c9-position chain-ends while introducing various moieties with no side reactions, such as cyclization, has rarely been obtained. Herein, we propose a novel method to simultaneously remove and modify chain-end iodine in RCMP polymers, using radical generating agents such as azo compounds and organic peroxides."

Experiment to Estimate the Combination Rate Constant kc It is known that oxy radicals produced by the decomposition of peroxides are more reactive than carbon radicals produced by the decomposition of azo compounds. Thus, different radical-generating agents may lead to different rates for the combination reaction between radicals generated by the decomposition of the radical-generating agent and the polymer radicals generated by iodine abstraction, and this affects the chain-end modification ratio. Therefore, a model experiment was carried out to determine the rate constant kc for the combination reaction between polymer radicals generated by iodine abstraction from the low-molecular-weight alkyl iodide initiator PhE-I instead of Polymer-I with iodine abstraction catalyst BNI, and the radicals generated by decomposition of radical generating agents (azo compound AIBN, diacyl peroxides LPO and BPO). Furthermore, a 1HNMR analysis was carried out to determine the combined ratios for radicals (R\u00b7) generated by the thermal decomposition of radical generating agents (R-R) and PhE radicals (PhE\u00b7) generated by iodine abstraction from alkyl iodide (PhE-I) by BNI. A mixture of PhE-I (1 eq as 0.2 mmol), a radical generating agent (5 eq) decomposed at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h, and BNI (5 eq) was heated in a 30 mL Schlenk flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and dark conditions at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h with magnetic stirring. The reaction was quenched by cooling to room temperature. The radical generating agent was LPO (5 eq, 100% decomposition), BPO (6 eq, 83% decomposition), or AIBN (5 eq, 100% decomposition) at the same molar ratio, taking into account the decomposition ratio at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h using published decomposition parameters [27].\nFigure 2.

Effect of Chemical Structure of Radical Generating Agent with or without Iodine Abstraction Catalyst on Chain-End Modification Efficiency\nTable 1 shows the effect of the chemical structure of the radical generating agent with or without an iodine abstraction catalyst on the modified PMMA molar mass and the iodine chain-end removal ratio determined by 1H-NMR. For the molar mass distribution and the chemical composition before and after chain-end modification of PMMA-I, representative SEC chromatograms and 1H-NMR spectra are shown in Figures S4 and S5, see Supplementary Materials, respectively. The reaction temperatures and times in Table 1 were determined as the conditions under which all the radical-generating agent was decomposed after the reaction. Thus, based on the T1h shown in Figure 2, the reaction temperature and time that gave similar decomposition rates for radical generating agents were used. In order to obtain efficient chain-end iodine abstraction from the Polymer-I, the modification was carried out at temperatures close to 70 \u25e6C, which is the polymerization temperature.\nFrom the molar masses and molar mass distributions shown in Table 1 and Figure S4, see Supplementary Materials, at the same radical generation rate during modification (T1h + 10 \u25e6C, Entries 1\u20133), PMMA modified with TPCO (Entry 3) contains a small amount of high-molecular-weight PMMA (approximately twice as high as the main modified component), while PMMA modified with AIBN (Entry 1) or aliphatic LPO (Entry 2) has almost same molar mass distribution as PMMA-I. These results suggest there are two possible pathways involving higher-molecular-weight PMMA: either recombination of two PMMA radicals derived from iodine abstraction from PMMA-I, or inter-molecular crosslinking\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 7 of 17\nof two PMMA radicals derived from hydrogen abstraction of PMMA by peroxy radicals generated by decomposition of TCPO, which is the highest hydrogen abstraction ability among all type of organic peroxides. As shown in Table 1, AIBN (Entry 1) gives a lower iodine chain-end removal ratio (21%) than the organic peroxides (Entry 2: 44% with LPO; Entry 3: 38% with TCPO peroxydicarbonate). In other words, more effective iodine chain-end removal is possible with organic peroxides than with azo compounds. In the 1H-NMR spectra shown in Figure S5, see Supplementary Materials, (Entries 1\u20133), no peaks derived from PMMA modified with the radical generating agent chain-end are found. This indicates that PMMA with the desired chain-end structure was not obtained. In addition, for PMMA modified with TCPO (Entry 3), a peak associated with -CH2\u2013CH2\u2013 (*, 1.55\u20131.67 ppm) is observed. However, no peaks are seen to be associated with other PMMA structures produced by the side reactions, such as those involving recombination or disproportionation of two PMMA radicals due to iodine abstraction from PMMA-I or combination between PhMe radicals due to hydrogen abstraction from the solvent (methyl group of PhMe) by peroxy radicals generated by decomposition of TCPO and PMMA radicals due to iodine abstraction from PMMA-I. Taking into account the small amount of high-molecular-weight PMMA (Entry 3 in Figure S4, see Supplementary Materials), this result may indicate intermolecular crosslinking of two PMMA radicals derived from hydrogen abstraction of methyl protons from the PMMA main chain by peroxy radicals generated by the decomposition of TCPO.\nEffect of Addition of Iodine Abstraction Catalyst on Chain-End Modification Efficiency\nFrom Table 1 and Figure S4, see Supplementary Materials, PMMA modified by diacyl peroxides containing carboxy groups (Entry 4: SAPO in the absence of BNI, Entry 5: SAPO in the presence of BNI) for the same radical generation rate during modification (T1h + 5 \u25e6C), the presence of BNI maintains the same molar mass distribution as PMMA-I, while the absence of BNI gives rise to a small amount of high-molecular-weight PMMA. In addition, from Table 1, the presence of BNI (Entry 5: 72%) gives a higher iodine chain-end removal ratio than the absence of BNI (Entry 4: 48%). In Figure S5, see Supplementary Materials, in the presence of BNI (Entry 5), a \u2013CH3 peak (c*, 1.67\u20131.75 ppm) and a \u2013CH2\u2013 peak (e, 2.30\u20132.33 ppm) derived from PMMA modified with a SAPO moiety chain-end are observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum. However, no peaks associated with other PMMA structures, such as those produced by inter-molecular crosslinking of two PMMA radicals, recombination or disproportionation of two PMMA radicals, or combination between DOX (solvent) radicals and PMMA radicals, are observed. In contrast, in the absence of BNI (Entry 4), peaks (*, 1.55\u20131.67 ppm) indicating intermolecular crosslinking of two PMMA radicals appear. Considering the iodine removal ratio, it can be concluded that Entry 5 contains PMMA modified with SAPO moiety chainends. This indicates that the iodine abstraction catalyst only abstracts iodine to generate PMMA radicals, and organic peroxides only generate radicals for coupling with PMMA radicals since the iodine abstraction catalyst abstracts iodine from PMMA-I faster than the generating radicals derived from the decomposition of organic peroxides in Entry 5.\nEffect of Chemical Structure of Radical Generating Agent with Iodine AbstractionCatalyst on Chain-End Modification Efficiency\nAs shown in Table 1 and Figure S4, see Supplementary Materials, both PMMA modified with SAPO (Entry 5) and with an azo compound containing a carboxy group (Entry 6: ACVN) in the presence of BNI at the same radical generation rate during modification (T1h + 5 \u25e6C) maintain the same molar mass distribution as PMMA-I. From Table 1, PMMA modified with SAPO (Entry 5, 72%) gives a significantly higher iodine chain-end removal efficiency than that modified with ACVN (Entry 6: 33%). Furthermore, in Figure S5, see Supplementary Materials, Entry 5 contains PMMA modified with a SAPO moiety chain-end, while Entry 6 does not include any particular peaks compared with PMMA-I. From these\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 8 of 17\nresults, only PMMA modified with SAPO in the presence of BNI gives the desired PMMA modified with a SAPO moiety chain-end among all the modified PMMAs in this study. In order to determine the chain-end modification ratio more directly, MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed. The chain-end modification ratio for each polymer chain-end structure was roughly calculated by weight conversion of the area ratio for the corresponding peaks.

It can be seen that there is a significant difference in combination ratios between azo compound AIBN (18%) and diacyl peroxides LPO and BPO (100%). Therefore, since the oxy radicals derived from peroxide decomposition react with PMMA radicals faster than the carbon radicals derived from the azo compound, radicals derived from diacyl peroxide with higher kc are considered to be more effective than those derived from the azo compound with lower kc.

In terms of the molar mass distribution and the chemical composition before and after chain-end modification of PSt-Is, representative SEC chromatograms and 1H-NMR spectra are shown in Figures S6 and S7, see Supplementary Materials, respectively.\na Iodine chain-end removal ratio was calculated by 1H-NMR. b Modification ratio was roughly calculated by area ratio of MALDI-TOF MS spectra for the LPO moiety chain-end. c Dehydrated toluene was used as a solvent. d Mn = 3.03, Mw = 3.72, PDI = 1.23.\nTable 3 and Figure S6, see Supplementary Materials, show that for the same radical generation rate during modification (T1h + 0 \u25e6C, Entries 8\u201310), all PSts modified with iodine abstraction catalysts with different iodine abstraction ratios (Entries 8 and 8\u2032: BNI; 74%; Entry 9: BNBr; 55%; Entry 10: BSI; 27%) [26], the lower-molecular-weight region was slightly extended while maintaining a monodisperse molecular weight distribution. From these results, it is assumed that there are possible pathways containing slightly higher-molecular-weight PSt formed by the recombination of two lower-molecular-weight PSt radicals derived from iodine abstraction from PSt-I because of faster diffusion of such radicals. In Table 3, PSt modified with an iodine abstraction catalyst with a higher iodine abstraction rate (Entries 8 and 8\u2032: BNI; 74%; Entry 9: BNBr; 55%) [26] gives a higher iodine chain-end removal ratio (100%) than that (34%) having a lower iodine abstraction rate (Entry 10: BSI; 27%) [26]. As shown in Entries 8\u20139 in Figure S7, see Supplementary Materials, for iodine abstraction catalysts with a higher iodine abstraction rate (Entries 8 and 8\u2032: BNI; 74%; Entry 9: BNBr; 55%) [26], three distinct peaks are observed for the desired PSt modified with\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 10 of 17\nLPO moiety chain-ends without decarboxylation. The peaks are associated with \u2013CH\u2013 (c*, 5.17\u20135.40 ppm), \u2013CH2\u2013 (e, 1.23\u20131.28 ppm) and \u2013CH3 (f, 0.89 ppm). In addition, the \u2013CH\u2013 peak (c\u2019, 4.48\u20134.75 ppm) associated with PSt-I is found to have disappeared. A peak associated with \u2013(CPh)CH\u2013CH(CPh)\u2013 (*, 2.97\u20133.18 ppm) is also observed. No peaks are observed that are associated with other PSt structures, such as those formed by disproportionation of two PSt radicals, a combination between PhMe (solvent) radicals and PSt radicals, or inter-molecular crosslinking of two PSt radicals derived from hydrogen abstraction of methyl protons from the PSt main chain or phenyl protons of PSt side chains by peroxy radicals generated by decomposition of LPO. The slight extension of the lower-molecular-weight region in the SEC chromatograph in Figure S6, see Supplementary Materials, while maintaining a monodisperse molecular weight distribution, may indicate that PSt derived from bimolecular termination of lowmolecular-weight PSt chain-end radicals was generated. On the other hand, in Entry 5 (PSt modified with BSI with the lowest iodine abstraction rate of 27%) [26], the \u2013CH\u2013 peak (c\u2019, 4.48\u20134.75 ppm) identified as PSt-I and the \u2013(CPh)CH\u2013CH(CPh)\u2013 peak (*, 2.97\u20133.18 ppm) were observed. This suggests that a modification using a low iodine abstraction catalyst resulted in slow iodine chain-end abstraction and polymer radical generation, leaving a large amount of the precursor PSt-I (66%). Figure 3 shows MALDI-TOF MS spectra of PSt modified with LPO in the presence of BNBr (Entry 9, which had the highest LPO moiety modification ratio) and its precursor PSt-I (Entry 7). Polymer peaks at regular intervals of 104 (St unit) are observed. In precursor, PSt-I (Entry 7), PSt with iodine chain-ends are not observed, but polymers P6\u20138 with different chain-end structures are observed. P6 is a PSt-macromonomer with an unsaturated C=C bond (theoretical mass = 3109.9, and experimental mass = 3109.6, chain-end modification ratio = 70%) generated by the elimination of HI from PSt-I. The carbon\u2212iodine bond of PSt-I is so weak that it could be cleaved during the MALDI\u2212TOF MS analysis. Thus, this PSt-macromonomer is considered to be generated from PSt-I during the MALDI-TOF MS analysis [31,32]. P7 is PSt with cyanoisopropyl moieties at both chain-ends (theoretical mass = 3178.9, experimental mass = 3178.6, chain-end modification ratio = 14%) generated by the bimolecular termination of two PSt chain-end radicals. The structure of P8 (chain-end modification ratio = 15%) is unidentified. In PSt modified with BNBr (Entry 9), three polymer series (P9\u201311) were observed. P9 is a PSt with an LPO moiety chain-end (theoretical mass = 4559.8, experimental mass = 4559.5, chain-end modification ratio = 33%). P10 is PSt with a hydrogen chain-end (theoretical mass = 4569.8, experimental mass = 4569.2, chain-end modification ratio = 55%). P11 is a polymer with cyanoisopropyl moieties at both chain-ends (theoretical mass = 4636.8, experimental mass = 4636.3, chain-end modification ratio = 13%) generated by the bimolecular termination of two PSt chain-end radicals. P9\u201311 were also observed in a similar ratio in Entries 8 and 8\u2019. In Entry 10, P6 or P10 (60%), P11 (11%) and an unidentified peak (29%) were observed. P11 is the polymer generated during the polymerization of Entry 7 and chain-end modification reaction for Entry 9. The main chain-end structure for Entry 9 was P10. It is considered that the peak derived from P10 is not observed in Figure S7, see Supplementary Materials, because this peak is thought to appear at the same position as peak c. Due to the fast iodine abstraction and the long lifetime of the chain-end radical, P10 could be generated by chain transfer of PSt chain-end radicals generated by iodine abstraction to the solvent or other reagents. As seen for Entries 8\u201310, PSt modified with BNBr (Entry 9, 33%) gives a higher LPO moiety modification ratio than the control PSt modified with BNI (Entry 8\u2032: 29%) while that with BSI (Entry 10) does not include any chain-end structure with the LPO moiety. The chain-end modification ratio for Entry 9 (33%) having an alkyl group is lower than that for PSt modified with an amine having an alkyl group (75%), as reported by Chen et al. [22]. From the SEC, 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOFMS measurements, PSt modified with LPO moiety chain-ends having no decarboxylation reaction was obtained:\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 11 of 17oly ers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 8\nFigure 3.

These peaks are associated with \u2013CH\u2013 (c*, 4.86\u20134.96 ppm), \u2013CH2\u2013 (h, 2.32\u20132.36 ppm and i, 1.21\u20131.33 ppm) and -CH3 (j, 0.86\u20130.90 ppm). For Entry 13, three distinct peaks are observed for the desired polymer (PBA modified with BPO moiety chain-ends without decarboxylation). These peaks are associated with \u2013CH\u2013 (c**, 5.15\u20135.27 ppm) and \u2013CH\u2013 in the benzene ring of the BPO moiety (l + m, 7.31\u20137.50 ppm), as well as the disappeared \u2013CH\u2013 peak (c\u2019, 4.28\u20134.36 ppm) identified as PBA-I. On the other hand, for PBAs modified with diacyl peroxides having a polar group (SAPO for Entry 14), three distinct peaks are also observed for the desired PBA modified with SAPO moiety chain-ends without decarboxylation. These peaks are associated with \u2013CH\u2013 (c***, 4.94\u20135.08 ppm) and \u2013CH2\u2013 (n+o, 2.60\u20132.79 ppm), as well as a \u2013CH\u2013 peak with reduced intensity (c\u2019, 4.28\u20134.36 ppm) identified as PBA-I. No peaks are observed that are associated with other PBA structures, such as those formed by disproportionation of two PBA radicals or a combination between PhMe or diglyme (solvent) radicals and PBA radicals. Figure 4 shows MALDI-TOF MS spectra of PBA modified with different diacyl peroxides and the precursor PBA-I (Entry 11). In all measurements (Entries 11\u201314), peaks at regular intervals of 128 (BA unit) were observed. In the spectrum of precursor PBA-I (Entry 11), only P12 with an iodine chain-end was observed. In PBA modified with LPO (Entry 12), only P13 with an LPO moiety chain-end (theoretical mass = 6570.3, experimental mass = 6570.7, chain-end modification ratio = 100%) was observed. In PBA modified with BPO (Entry 13), P14 with a BPO moiety chain-end (theoretical mass = 6570.3, experimental mass = 6570.7, chain-end modification ratio = 85%) and unidentified peaks were observed. In PBA modified with SAPO (Entry 14), PBAs P12,15\u201318 with various chain-end structures were observed. P15 is PBA with the SAPO moiety chain-end (theoretical mass = 6488.2, experimental mass = 6488.8, chain-end modification ratio = 25%). P16 is PBA with an OH chain-end (theoretical mass = 6388.1, experimental mass = 6388.9, chainend modification ratio = 19%) generated by hydrolysis of the SAPO moiety of P15. P17 is PBA with a lactone ring structure (theoretical mass = 6442.2, experimental mass = 6442.8, chain-end modification ratio = 23%). The structure of P18 is unidentified. Only peaks derived from PBA modified with SAPO, which is P15, and PBA-I, which is P12, are observed in Figure S9, see Supplementary Materials. Therefore, P16 and P17 could have been generated by hydrolysis of the SAPO moiety of P15 and elimination of CH3(CH2)3I from PBA-I during the MALDI-TOF MS analysis, respectively. PBA modified with LPO (Entry 12) in the presence of BNI gives the highest LPO moiety modification ratio (100%) compared to modified PMMA (Entry 5: 30%) and modified PSt (Entry 8: 27%) under identical conditions. The PBA radical (secondary radical) derived from iodine abstraction from PBA-I is less stable than both the tertiary radical generated by iodine abstraction from PMMA-I and the styryl radical generated by iodide abstraction from PSt. Therefore, PBA-I could undergo slower iodine abstraction and have a shorter lifetime for chain-end radicals than PSt-I and PMMA-I. This suggests that relatively slow iodine abstraction is important for a high chain-end modification ratio. The chain-end modification ratio for modified PBA having an alkyl group (Entry 12, 100%) is the same as that for PBA modified with an amine having an alkyl group (100%), as reported by\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 13 of 17\nChen et al. [22], whose chain-end structure consists of an amine and a cyclic structure of BA. From the standpoint of the desired chain-end modification, Entry 12 is more efficient than PBA modified with the amine.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 18\nlifetime for chain-end radicals than PSt-I and PMMA-I. This suggests that relatively slow iodine abstraction is important for a high chain-end modification ratio. The chain-end modification ratio for modified PBA having an alkyl group (Entry 12, 100%) is the same as that for PBA modified with an amine having an alkyl group (100%), as reported by Chen et al. [22], whose chain-end structure consists of an amine and a cyclic structure of BA. From the standpoint of the desired chain-end modification, Entry 12 is more efficient than PBA modified with the amine. Furthermore, for PBA-I modified with different diacyl peroxides (LPO: aliphatic moiety; BPO: aromatic moiety; and SAPO: aliphatic moiety with carboxyl group), PBA modified with SAPO (Entry 14: 25%) gives a lower chain-end modification ratio than those with LPO (Entry 12: 100%) and BPO (Entry 13: 85%). In Entry 14, when SAPO was added dropwise to the PBA-I solution containing BNI, a rapid color change from clear to black was observed. This peculiar color change could indicate a side reaction between the acidic S PO and t e iodine f BNI. These results suggest that the structure of the diacyl peroxide affects the chain- nd modific tio ratio, which will be discussed later.\nFigure 4.

Effect of Dose of Radical Generating Agents on Chain-End Modification Efficiency Following the highly efficient chain-end modification of PBA in Entry 12, the effect of small amounts of radical generating agent on chain-end modification was investigated. Table 5 shows the effect of the dose of radical generating agents on the modified PBA molar mass, the iodine chain-end removal ratio determined by 1H-NMR, and the iodine chain-end modification ratio determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Representative SEC chromatograms and 1H-NMR spectra are shown in Figure S8 and Figure S9, see Supplementary Materials, respectively, indicating the molar mass distribution and the chemical composition before and after chain-end modification of PBA-I.\nTable 5 and Figure S8, see Supplementary Materials, show that at the same temperature (110 \u00b0C, Entries 12, 15 and 16), for PBAs modified with different doses of LPO (5 eq for PBA-I in Entry 15 and 2 eq for PAB-I in Entry 16) in the presence of BNI, no significant change in either molecular weight (Mn and Mw) or PDI including the molar mass distribution was observed after the reaction. This indicates that recombination or inter-molecular crosslinking of two PBA radicals did not occur. For Entries 15 and 16 in Table 5, all PBAs exhibit a high iodine chain-end removal ratio (100%). Entries 15 and 16 are for PBA modified with LPO moiety chain-ends. No peaks associated with other PBA structures, such as those formed by disproportionation of two PBA radicals or a combination between PhMe or diglyme (solvent) radicals and PBA radicals, are observed. In the MALDITOFMS spectra of modified PBAs (Entries 15 and 16), only P13 with LPO moiety chainends was observed. A high chain-end modification ratio (100%) was also obtained for PBAs modified ith a lower dose of LPO (5 eq for PBA-I in E try 15 and 2 eq for PAB-I in Entry 16) than Entry 12 (10 eq of LPO for PBA-I). This indicates that highly efficient chainend modification of PBA-I is possible with small doses of the radical-generating agents.\nTable 5.

Effect of Concentration of Radicals Generated by Decomposition of Diacyl Peroxides\nThe chain-end modification efficiency for PBA modified with LPO (Entry 12: 100% at 110 \u00b0C) is higher than that for PBA modified with BPO (Entry 13: 85% at 110 \u00b0C). Since LPO has a lower T1h than BPO, LPO decomposes faster than BPO at 110 \u00b0C. It is considered that the higher radical concentration for LPO gives a higher modification efficiency when the polymer radical is generated by BNI abstraction. Different radical concentrations for LPO are brought about by different kd values in Scheme 2. In order to clarify the effect of kd for the radical generating agent on the chain-end modification efficiency, the\nBNI (10)\n110 (T1h + 30)\n1 6.24 7.26 1.16 100 100\n15 c PBA-I(1) LPO (5)\nBNI (10)\n110 (T1h + 30)\n1 6.52 .56 .16 0 10\n16 c PBA-I(1) LPO (2)\nBNI (10)\n110 (T1h + 30)\n1 6.62 7.59 1.15 100 100\na Iodine chain-end removal ratio was calculated by 1H-NMR. b Modification ratio was roughly calculated by the area ratio of MALDI-TOF MS spectra of radical generating agent-derived moiety chain-end. c Dehydrated toluene was used as a solvent.\nTable 5 and Figure S8, see Supplementary Materials, show that at the same temperature (110 \u25e6C, Entries 12, 15 and 16), for PBAs modified with different doses of LPO (5 eq for PBAI in Entry 15 and 2 eq for PAB-I in Entry 16) i the presence of BNI, no significant change in either molecular weight (Mn and Mw) or PDI including the molar mass distribution was observed after the reaction. This indicates that recombination or inter-molecular crosslinking of two PBA radicals did not occur. For Entries 15 and 16 in Table 5, all PBAs exhibit a high iodine chain-end removal ratio (100%). Entries 15 and 16 are for PBA modified with LPO moiety chain-ends.

A high chain-end modification ratio (100%) was also obtained for PBAs modified with a lower dose of LPO (5 eq for PBA-I in Entry 15 and 2 eq for PAB-I in Entry 16) than Entry 12 (10 eq of LPO for PBA-I). This indicates that highly efficient chain-end modification of PBA-I is possible with small doses of the radical-generating agents.\n3.3.3. Effect of Concentration of Radicals Generated by Decomposition of DiacylPeroxides\nThe chain-end modification efficiency for PBA modified with LPO (Entry 12: 100% at 110 \u25e6C) is higher than that for PBA modified with BPO (Entry 13: 85% at 110 \u25e6C). Since LPO has a lower T1h than BPO, LPO decomposes faster than BPO at 110 \u25e6C. It is considered that the higher radical concentration for LPO gives a higher modification efficiency when the polymer radical is generated by BNI abstraction. Different radical concentrations for LPO are brought about by different kd values in Scheme 2. In order to clarify the effect of kd for the radical generating agent on the chain-end modification efficiency, the relationship between kd and the chain-end modification ratio was investigated. Figure 5 shows the relationship between the logarithm of kd for the radical generating agent at the modification temperature and the chain-end modification ratio for the modified PBAs of several diacyl peroxides (LPO and BPO) and BNI (Entries 12 and 13). Entries 12 and 13 using LPO and BPO with the same kc shown in Table S1, see Supplementary Materials, and relatively high initiator efficiencies were compared. All modifications being compared have the same molar ratio of the radical generator to Polymer-I (10 eq for Polymer-I). Furthermore, since chain-end modification is performed at the same temperature (110 \u25e6C) and using the same\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2667 15 of 17\nsolvent (dehydrated toluene), the concentration of radicals generated after all the radical generating agents are decomposed is also equal (20 eq for polymer radical). A proportional relationship between log kd and the chain-end modification ratio can be seen. Therefore, in the modification of PBA, the chain-end modification efficiency is thought to be affected by the radical concentration per time triggered by the decomposition rate constant kd, which is one of the dominant factors in Scheme 2.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 18\nrelationship between kd and the chain-end modification ratio was investigated.

Conclusions A novel chain-end modification method was demonstrated for several types of Polymer-I (PMMA-I, PSt-I and PBA-I) via RCMP with different functionalized radical generation agents such as azo compounds and organic peroxides, which enabled the introduction of the desired moieties from the radical generating agents. The combination of PBAI, iodine abstraction catalyst and different functional diacyl peroxides gave higher chainend modification to the desired moiety.
