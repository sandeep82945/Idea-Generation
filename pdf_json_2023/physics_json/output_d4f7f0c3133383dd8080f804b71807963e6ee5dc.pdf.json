This is a rare report of aniline-induced fungal production of tetrahydronaphthone polyketides.\nKEYWORDS\naniline, tetrahydronaphthone polyketides, NMR, antimicrobial activity, Talaromyces\nfuniculosus\nIntroduction\nIn-depth bioinformatics analysis of fungi has indicated that most of the biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites are unexpressed under general laboratory conditions (Li et\u00a0al., 2020; Lyu et\u00a0al., 2020). Activation of these gene clusters to obtain novel carbon skeleton for drug leads attracted extensive attention (Bauman et\u00a0 al., 2021). Chemical epigenetic modification is an effective method to activate cryptic genes by simply adding DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors to the medium of microorganisms (Cichewicz, 2010). Significantly, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was one of the most popular histone deacetylase inhibitors (He et\u00a0al., 2018; Guo et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2022). However, recent reports showed SAHA could be\u00a0metabolized by fungi into aniline, and then formed aniline-containing metabolites, such as chalaniline A (Adpressa et\u00a0al., 2017), cladosins J-K (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2018), and talaroenamine B (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021). These successes indicate that aniline could be\u00a0 a promising exogenous-added chemical incorporated by microorganisms into the active biosynthetic intermediates to the discovery of new \u201cunnatural\u201d product scaffolds."

To explore the metabolic potential of this fungus, we\u00a0selected this strain for further chemical investigation by cultivating it with aniline instead of SAHA. As a result, HPLC-UV analysis showed obvious differences from the control fermentation (Supplementary Figure S1). Chemical investigation of crude extracts resulted in the discovery of a novel anilinecontaining polyketide tanicutone A (1), two new bicyclic polyketides tanicutones B-C (2\u20133), and a new related trienoic acid 8-methyldeca2,4,6-trienoic acid (5), together with a known compound 4 (Figure\u00a01). Tanicutone B (2) has wide bacteriostatic activities (MIC values: 0.17 ~ 5.53 \u03bcg/mL). This article describes the fermentation, separation, structure identification, and biological activity assay."

All MMFF minima were reoptimized with DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6\u201331 + G(d) level using the Gaussian09 program (Frisch et\u00a0al., 2010). The geometry was optimized starting from various initial conformations, with vibrational frequency calculations confirming the presence of minima. Time-dependent DFT calculations were performed on four lowest-energy conformations for (3R)-1a, three lowest-energy conformations for (1R, 3R)-2a, two lowest-energy conformations for (1S, 3R)-2b, three lowest-energy conformations for (1R, 3R)3a, three lowest-energy conformations for (1S, 3R)-3b, two lowestenergy conformations for (1R, 3R)-4a, two lowest-energy conformations for (1S, 3R)-4b, and four lowest-energy conformations for (8\u2032R)-5 (>3% population) using 30 excited states, and using a polarizable continuum model (PCM) for MeOH. ECD spectra were all generated using the program SpecDis (Bruhn et\u00a0 al., 2011) by applying a Gaussian band shape with 0.25 eV, from dipole length rotational strengths. The dipole velocity forms yielded negligible differences. The spectra of the conformers were combined using Boltzmann weighting, with the lowestenergy conformations accounting for about 97% of the weights. The calculated spectra were shifted by 0 nm for 1a/3a/3b, 10 nm for 2a/2b/5, and 15 nm for 4a/4b to facilitate comparison to the experimental data.

            "text": "Tanicutone A (1) was isolated as a pale-yellow oil. The molecular formula was determined as C30H31NO5 according to HRESIMS analysis, indicating 16 degrees of unsaturation. The 1D NMR data (Tables 1, 2) of 1 suggested the presence of 4 methyls, 1 methylene, 14 sp2 methines, 1 sp3 methine, and 10 non-protonated carbons including three carbonyls. The ester chain (from C-1\u2032 to C-11\u2032) was deduced from the COSY cross peaks (H-2\u2032/H-3\u2032/H-4\u2032/H-5\u2032/H-6\u2032/H-7\u2032/H-8\u2032/ H2-9\u2032/H3-10\u2032/H-8\u2032/H3-11\u2032) and key HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 and H-3\u2032 to C-1\u2032 (Figure\u00a0 2). The tetrahydronaphthalene moiety was indicated by the HMBC correlations from H-7 to C-5 and C-9, from H-9 to C-1, C-5, and C-7, from H-11 to C-1, C-2, and C-10, from H3-12 to C-2, C-3, and C-4 and from H3-13 to C-5, C-6, and C-7, as well as the chemical shifts of C-2 (\u03b4C 191.9) and C-4 (\u03b4C 192.4). The spectroscopic data (Tables 1, 2) of these two fragments showed that they were linked by C3-O-C1\u2032, which were similar to those of known compound JBIR-12 (Izumikawa et\u00a0al., 2009; Figure\u00a01) but differed by the substituted groups in the naphthalene ring. The substituent group in the C-6 was methyl of 1 not hydroxymethyl of JBIR-12, based on the chemical shifts of CH3-13 (\u03b4C 22.8, \u03b4H 2.43), which were also in agreement with the 2D NMR data (Figure\u00a02). Another difference is that the H-7 of 1 was unsubstituted according to the chemical shifts of CH-7 (\u03b4C 116.1, \u03b4H 6.52, d, J = 2.0 Hz), which was supported by the\nFIGURE\u00a02 Key COSY, HMBC, and NOESY correlations of 1\u20135.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nHMBC correlations from H-7 to C-5 and C-9. Detailed analysis of the NMR data of 1 revealed 1 contained one extra aniline group compared with the known compound JBIR-12. Key HMBC correlations from NH to C-1 and C-2\u2033 (C-6\u2033) and from H-11 to C-2, C-10 and C-1\u2033 further proved the presence of an aniline group and attached it to the C-11 atom.\nTanicutones B-C (2\u20133) were all isolated as pale-yellow oils. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 2\u20133 (Tables 1, 2) indicated that both of them possessed the same skeletons as JBIR-12, differing only by the substituting groups at C-6. The substituent group in the C-6 was aldehyde of 2 and methyl of 3, which was based on the chemical shift of CH-13 (\u03b4C 195.7, \u03b4H 10.17) of 2 and CH3-13 (\u03b4C 12.9, \u03b4H 2.30) of 3, together with HRESIMS data.\nThe NMR data of compound 4 (Tables 1, 2) are highly similar to those of JBIR-12 (Izumikawa et\u00a0al., 2009). Then the 1H and 13C NMR data of compound 4 were remeasured in CD3OD instead of DMSO-d6 according to the literature. The results displayed that they should be\u00a0the same compound (\u0394\u03b4H < 0.02, \u0394\u03b4C < 0.2; Supplementary Figures S41, S42). However, the relative and absolute configurations of the known compound JBIR-12, which was isolated from Penicillium sp., were not determined (Izumikawa et\u00a0al., 2009).\nCompound 5 was isolated as a pale-yellow oil with the molecular formula of C11H16O2 based on HRESIMS analysis. The 1D and 2D NMR data of 5 (Tables 1, 2; Figure\u00a02) indicated that 5 possessed a similar triene chain with compounds 1\u20134, differing only by the terminal carboxylic acid of 5 instead of the ester group of 1\u20134.\nThe geometry of double bonds in the triene chain of 1\u20135 was deduced to be\u00a0E by the NOESY correlations (H-2\u2032/H-4\u2032, H-3\u2032/H-5\u2032, H-4\u2032/H-6\u2032, and H-5\u2032/H-7\u2032; Figure\u00a02). The geometry of double bond C1-C11 of 1 was deduced to be\u00a0Z by the NOESY correlation (H-9/H11; Figure\u00a02).\nWith the consideration of the biogenetic origin and co-isolation of 1\u20135, compounds 1\u20135 should have the same absolute configurations. The absolute configuration of C-3 was determined by comparing the experimental ECD curve of 1 with the one calculated from the truncated model (3R)-1a (Figure\u00a03A). The good agreement between the calculated ECD spectra of(3R)-1a with the experimental result suggested the absolute configuration of 1 as 3R (Figure\u00a0 3A).\nThe relative stereo-relationship of the two chiral centers (C-1 and C-3) of compound 2 was not established due to the lack of valid signals. The computational ECD spectra of the two truncated models (1R, 3R)-2a and (1S, 3R)-2b (Figure\u00a0 4A), covering all the possible absolute configurations, were calculated. Although calculated ECD curves of 2a and 2b are similar, the better agreement of the calculated ECD spectra of (1R, 3R)-2a (red curve) with the experimental data (black curve) of 2 suggest the 1R, 3R absolute configuration (Figure\u00a04B). The absolute configurations of 3 and 4 were also established to be\u00a01R, and 3R in the same way as 2 (Figures\u00a04C,D). To determine the absolute configurations of C-8\u2032, the solution conformers and ECD spectra of (8\u2032R)-5 were calculated. By comparing its experimental and calculated ECD curves, the absolute configuration of 5 was established to be\u00a08\u2032R (Figure\u00a03B). Finally, the absolute configurations of all compounds were determined as (3R, 8\u2032R)-1, (1R, 3R, 8\u2032R)-2, (1R, 3R, 8\u2032R)-3, and (1R, 3R, 8\u2032R)-4."

We\u00a0propose that the addition of aniline could intercept the aldehyde intermediate a to form the Schiff base b (Adpressa et\u00a0al., 2017), and then blocked the formation of azaphiliones. Further oxidation at C-3 of b and intramolecular nucleophilic addition (shown as the blue arrow, not the red arrow which was the way to form azaphiliones) afforded the core skeleton c. Then, 1 was generated by intermolecular dehydration involving 8-methyldeca-2,4,6-trienoic acid (5) with c. Finally, the removal of aniline moiety and further oxidation of 1 resulted in the formation of 2\u20134."

The absolute configurations of 1\u20135 were determined by calculating ECD. Compound 2 containing a highly reactive aldehyde group exhibited the best antimicrobial activity against V. parahaemolyticus with an MIC value of 0.17 \u03bcg/mL. Our findings indicate that small molecule aniline could be\u00a0 an effective tool in exploiting the metabolic potential of fungi by interfering with conventional biosynthetic pathways.\nFIGURE\u00a04 (A) Structures of truncated models 2a-4a and 2b-4b.
