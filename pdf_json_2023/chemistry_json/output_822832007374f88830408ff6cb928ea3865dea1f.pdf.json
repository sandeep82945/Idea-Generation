    "abstractText": "The Escherichia coli ATP-dependent ClpYQ protease constitutes ClpY ATPase/unfoldase and ClpQ peptidase. The Tyr91st residue within the central pore-I site of ClpY-hexamer is important for unfolding and translocating substrates into the catalytic site of ClpQ. We have identified the degron site (GFIMRP147th) of SulA, a cell-division inhibitor recognized by ClpYQ and that the Phe143rd residue in degron site is necessary for SulA native folded structure. However, the functional association of this degron site with the ClpYQ degrader is unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular insights into substrate recognition and discrimination by the ClpYQ protease. We found that the point mutants ClpYY91FQ, ClpYY91HQ, and ClpYY91WQ, carrying a ring structure at the 91st residue of ClpY, efficiently degraded their natural substrates, evidenced by the suppressed bacterial methylmethane-sulfonate (MMS) sensitivity, the reduced \u03b2-galactosidase activity of cpsB::lacZ, and the lowest amounts of MBP-SulA in both in vivo and in vitro degradation analyses. Alternatively, mimicking the wild-type SulA, SulAF143H, SulAF143K and SulAF143W, harboring a ring structure or a cation side-group in 143rd residue of SulA, were efficiently degraded by ClpYQ in the bacterial cells, also revealing shorter half-lives at 41 \u25e6C and higher binding affinities towards ClpY in pull-down assays. Finally, ClpYY91FQ and ClpYY91HQ, were capable of effectively degrading SulAF143H and SulAF143K, highlighting a correspondingly functional interaction between the SulA 143rd and ClpY 91st residues. According to the interchangeable substituted amino acids, our results uniquely indicate that a transient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 or cation\u2212\u03c0 interaction between the SulA 143rd and ClpY 91st residues could be aptly gripped between the degron site of substrates and the pore site of proteases (degraders) for substrate recognition and discrimination of the processive degradation.",

            "text": "In Escherichia coli, there are five AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) proteases, namely Lon, FtsH, ClpAP, ClpXP, and ClpYQ (HslUV) [1,2]. Uniquely, the two-component ClpYQ protease, consisting of ClpQ similar to a \u03b2 subunit in the 20S proteasome and ClpY with an extra intermediate domain, was first found in E. coli [3\u20136]. According to bioinformatic, phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, ClpYQ is found in almost all eubacteria [5,7,8]. ClpQ (19 kDa) peptidase and ClpY (49 kD) ATPase/unfoldase are encoded by clpQ+Y+ heat shock operons [3,4,6,9]. Using biochemical size-exclusion-chromatography, electronic microscopy, and X-ray crystal structure analysis, Y6Q6Q6Y6 was shown to exhibit a dumbbell-shaped complex with two ClpY and two ClpQ\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17353. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242417353 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17353 2 of 17\nhexameric rings [5,10\u201312]. In the presence of ATP, ClpY is capable of delivering substrates into the catalytic ClpQ core site for degradation [6,13]. Hence, ClpY is responsible for substrate recognition, unfolding, and translocation with ATP hydrolysis [6,14\u201317]. Molecular dynamic multi-scale modeling demonstrates that the ClpYQ complex has a narrow central pore, and through it, only a single stretched peptide can pass [18]. However, another modeling study suggested that four-helix bundle protein substrates can be transported into the ClpQ core site for degradation with the ancillary ClpY-I domain [19]. From crystal structure analyses, the ClpY monomer constitutes three domains [12,20]. The N\u2013terminal domain (N\u2013domain, 2\u2013109 aa and 244\u2013332 aa) has ATPase activity; the pore I, II sites, and the intermediate\u2013domain (I\u2013domain, 110\u2013243 aa) organize substrate binding; and the C\u2013terminal domain (C\u2013domain, 333\u2013433 aa) allows for ClpY self-oligomerization and the activation of ClpQ catalytic function [6,12,16,17,20,21]. Inversely, ClpQ, with the substrate bound at the first threonine (Thr-1) catalytic residue, can allosterically activate the ATPase activity of ClpY-hexamer and increase its binding affinity toward ClpY [22]. Moreover, there are twelve potential active sites in the ClpQ dodecamer. However, only a maximum of six active sites are used for substrate degradation [23] and ClpQ demonstrates optimal proteolytic activity at pH 9 [24]. The GYVG93rd amino acid sequence, especially the Tyr91st residue, of pore site I central to the ClpY hexamer(s) is necessary for the binding/unfolding/translocation of substrates [15,16]. Moreover, two loops (130~159 aa and 175~209 aa) in the ClpY-I domain are involved in substrate delivery, in which three loop 2 unblock at higher temperatures, opening the route to the pore site for substrate degradation [6,17,25]. So far, several proteins have been identified as the cellular substrates for ClpYQ protease, including SulA, RcsA, RpoH, TraJ, RNaseR, YbaB and LpxC [26\u201334]. Both Lon and ClpYQ are capable of degrading SulA [28,29,33,34]. SulA functions as a cell division inhibitor by interacting with and inhibiting the activity of FtsZ, a critical GTPase essential for septum formation [35,36]. The tertiary structure of SulA comprises four \u03b1 helices and five \u03b2 sheets [37,38]. FtsZ individually binds to each monomer of the SulA dimer in a crystal structure [37] and has been shown to protect SulA from degradation by ClpYQ protease [34,39]. A recently identified degron site of SulA, GFIMRP147th, near the C-terminal was shown to be necessary for the recognition and binding of ClpYQ protease in degradation [38]. However, as of now, there is no reported crystal structure for the ClpY(6x)-substrate complex, and the mechanism underlying the recognition and discrimination of the degron site in natural substrates by the degrader for degradation remains unknown. Specifically, the Phe143rd residue within SulA degron site has been found to be vital for folding the structure of SulA [38]. Thus, we suspected that these two residues, SulA-Phe143rd and ClpY-Tyr91st, may be both involved in substrate denaturation and degradation at the molecular level. Notably, the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction, an important noncovalent interaction responsible for \u03c0\u2013electron interaction patterns, was progressively identified in the biological sciences [40]. Furthermore, the cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction, which represents another biological noncovalent interaction functioning within a limited distance between cations and adjacent \u03c0 systems, has also presented its significance in biology [41]. Recently renowned studies have demonstrated that the amino acids with aromatic, imidazole or cation side chains in proteins for \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions and cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions between the residues have been indexed for protein stability [42], protein\u2013protein interaction [43], protein-ligand interactions [44], phase separation [45], catalysis [46] and protein assembly [40]. However, such interactions have not been reported for synthetic or natural substrate degradation by proteases. Here, by using site-directed mutagenesis to engineer protein molecules in physiological and functional-degradation assays, we explicitly demonstrate that a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 or an amenable cation\u2013\u03c0 transient interaction between SulA-Phe143rd residue in the degron and ClpYTyr91st residue in the pore site of the degrader occurs for the substrate recognition and discrimination, and is necessary for the ultimate degradation of this natural substrate by the ATP-dependent protease.\nInt.

            "text": "To investigate the underlined molecular mechanisms between SulA-Phe143rd and ClpYTyr91st residues, we constructed several ClpY variants bearing single substitutions of Y91F, Y91H, Y91K, Y91R, Y91S, and Y91W on the basis of both pBAD24-clpY+ and His(6x)-tagged pET21a-clpY+ plasmids. We also constructed SulA variants with point mutations of F143A, F143D, F143H, F143K, F143N, F143P, F143R, F143S, F143W and F143Y on the basis of both pTH18kr-mbp-sulA+ and pMal-c2X-sulA+ plasmids. In addition, new E. coli mutants were constructed in series as described in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S1, Table 1 and Table S1), including CH21408 (lon, sulA), CH21409 [(lon, sulA, ftsZ(SfiB*)], CH21410 (lon, clpQ, clpY, sulA) and CH21411 [(lon, clpQ, clpY, sulA, ftsZ(SfiB*)] strains.\nNext, to explore the intracellular activities of wild-type ClpY and its derivative mutants in bacteria, an AC3112 strain (lon, clpQ, clpY) carrying pBAD33-clpQ+ was used as the host, which was transformed individually with pBAD24-clpY+ or its derivatives. An AC3112 strain carrying two empty vectors, pBAD24 and pBAD33, was used as a negative control. The resulting co-transformant carrying pBAD24-clpQ+ and pBAD33-clpY+ was then used as a positive control. The negative control AC3112 strain expressed higher \u03b2-galactosidase activity of cpsB::lacZ and was sensitive to methyl-methane-sulfonate (MMS) with a lower efficiency of plating (EOP) of 10\u22124, due to the reason that RcsA and induced-SulA were exceedingly stable in the absence of both Lon and ClpYQ proteases (Figure 1A,B). In contrast, similar to the wild-type ClpY, ClpYY91F, ClpYY91W and ClpYY91H degraded RcsA and SulA proteins in the presence of ClpQ on L-arabinose media, as demonstrated by their host cells with lower \u03b2-galactosidase activity of cpsB::lacZ and a higher EOP (EOP > 10\u22122) for the resistance to MMS (Figure 1A,B). However, the bacterial cells expressing ClpYY91SQ, ClpYY91KQ or ClpYY91RQ did not degrade RcsA and SulA proteins due to their higher \u03b2-galactosidase activity and a lower EOP of 10\u22124 (Figure 1A,B). For additional confirmation of the aforementioned data, we transformed CH21410 (lon, clpQ, clpY, sulA) with pTH18krmbp-sulA+ and pBAD33-clpQ+. The resultant bacterial cells were again transformed in series with pBAD24-clpY+ and its derivatives. In Figure 1C, as our negative control, CH21410 bacterial cells carrying pBAD33, pBAD24 and pTH18kr-mbp-sulA+ (a low copy plasmid) exhibited poor growth with an EOP of 10\u22123 after IPTG induction. However, we were\nInt. J. Mol.

As shown in Figure 1C, in the presence of ClpQ, ClpYY91F and ClpYY91H, like the wild-type ClpY, were also able to survive the intracellular lethality of MBP-SulA (EOP of 10\u22121). Interestingly, under similar conditions, bacterial cells carrying ClpYY91WQ did not grow well (EOP of 10\u22123), and analogous results were found in bacterial cells carrying ClpYY91SQ, ClpYY91KQ or ClpYY91RQ (EOP of 10\u22124). Coincidently, Western blot assays demonstrated that MBP-SulA was largely degraded by ClpYQ, ClpYY91FQ and ClpYY91HQ. However, an intermediary accumulation of MBP-SulA was detected in the bacteria with ClpYY91WQ. In contrast, higher accumulation of MBP-SulA was significantly detected in the bacterial cells carrying either ClpYY91SQ, ClpYY91KQ or ClpYY91RQ. These results indicate that ClpY mutants, with the aromatic residues, Phe (F) and Trp (W), as well as the imidazole ring residue, His (H), at the 91st position, retain their normal activity for natural substrate degradation in the presence of ClpQ.

After about 2 h of induction, half of the bacterial cells were diluted and spotted on LB plates with 0.5% L-arabinose. The EOP value was also determined via averaging the number of colonies counted on the growth media with an addition of IPTG, divided by the number of colonies counted on the growth media without IPTG.

The other half of bacterial cells after 2 h of induction were collected by means of centrifugation and re-suspended in 2X SDS-sample buffer. Next, in our Western blot analyses, equal amounts of the samples, normalized using recorded OD600 values, were loaded on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Then, all the samples were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Thermo Scientific\u2122, Waltham, MA, USA). Anti-MBP monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used for detection of the residual MBP-SulA proteins. ClpQ, ClpY and ClpY derivatives were detected using polyclonal ClpQ and ClpY anti-serum. Western blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit procured from Pierce."

Our data also indicated that the Phe143rd residue of SulA is important for its own native proteinfolding.

Specifically, the Tyr91st residue of ClpY plays a vital role in the unfolding/translocation of the substrate proteins for terminal degradation by ClpQ [15\u201317]. Here, we explore the interactive functional roles of the Phe143rd residue of SulA and the Tyr91st residue of ClpY in natural substrate degradation. Since these two important amino acid residues have aromatic rings, we hypothesized that a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 or an additionally amenable cation\u2013\u03c0 transient interaction possibly occurs between these two residues and is likely necessary for the recognition and discrimination of substrates by ClpYQ degrader in the processive degradation. To rigorously explore the unknown mechanisms for SulA degradation by ClpYQ protease, we constructed various point mutations in the ClpY-Tyr91st residue and the SulA-Phe143rd residue. We first conducted a series of physiological tests for the bacteria to demonstrate that the bacterial cells carrying ClpQ with either ClpY, ClpYY91F, ClpYY91W or ClpYY91H have lower \u03b2-galactosidase activity for cpsB::lacZ expression and can survive MMS-induced SulA lethality. These results indicate that the aforementioned ClpY mutants degrade RcsA and SulA proteins. Then, in both in vivo and in vitro degradation assays, ClpYY91F and ClpYY91H, much like wild-type ClpY, were able to degrade MBP-SulA in the presence of ClpQ. Additionally, ClpYY91W can minorly degrade MBP-SulA in vitro at a higher temperature. However, from our results, ClpY mutants carrying Y91S, Y91K, and Y91R residues were all defective in their degradation of SulA protein. Similarly, earlier studies demonstrated that ClpY mutants carrying Y91I, Y91C, Y91A and Y91S residues were too defective for SulA degradation [15]. Notably, the F (Phe), W (Trp) and H (His) are aromatic or imidazole amino acids with a ring structure. Therefore, the 91st site of ClpY with a ring structure is important for SulA degradation. Meanwhile, ClpYQ efficiently degrades MBP-SulA, MBP-SulAF143H, MBP-SulAF143W and MBP-SulAF143K. In addition, all of them possessed the shorter half-life in the intracellular degradation assays. Again, in addition to the ring structure at the 143rd residue adaptable for the substrate degradation, K (Lys) residue that has a cation in the side group can also be apt for the similar degradation. Moreover, in the presence of ClpQ and ATP, both ClpY and ClpYY91F efficiently degrade MBP-SulA, MBP-SulAF143H and MBP-SulAF143K in vitro. Additionally,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17353 12 of 17\nunder similar conditions, ClpYY91H also moderately degrades the above substrates. Thus, we conclude that the Phe143rd residue of SulA is functionally involved in a transient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the Tyr91st residue of ClpY in the degradation process. Moreover, an alternative transient cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction can occur between SulA-143rd and ClpY-91st residues for the substrate processive degradation. Next, from our in vitro pull-down analyses, ClpY associated well with MBP-SulA, MBP-SulAF143H and MBP-SulAF143K, but not with SulAF143A*. These results indicate that ClpY was less interactive with SulAF143A* and likely also defective on the unfolding/ translocation of SulAF143A* during degradation. Moreover, after normalizing purified protein levels and quantifying ClpY and MBP-SulA amounts via Image J analyses, we determined the molar ratio for the association between ClpY and MBP-SulA and its derivatives to be 6:1 or 6:2. These results suggest that the ClpY hexamer binds to one or two MBP-SulA molecules and/or its derivatives and also support the hypothesis that ClpYQ degrades its target substrate by means of the translocation of an unfolded polypeptide through the pore site of ClpY-hexamer [18]. In addition, there are two configurations for Y91 residue in the pore site; one is the closed-down state with a functional gripping of the substrate for delivery into the inner region towards the catalytic site, and the other is the opened-up state for slipping in the delivered unfolded substrate for the release [18]. However, all of these studies utilized computational techniques to extrapolate the findings, which still need to be validated through experimental data. Through our studies, we were able to experimentally identify that an initial transient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction or cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction is essential for the functional recognition and degradation of a natural substrate by an ATP-dependent protease. Notably, there are three \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction geometries in aromatic amino-acids: T-shaped, parallel-displaced, and co-facial parallel stacked (sandwich) [42]. In proteins, the former two are the most stable, with nearly iso-energetic symmetry. The last one is the least favorable, with benzene dimers [42]. Both T-shaped and parallel-displaced geometries are electrostatically attractive, yet the direct stacking of aromatic rings is electrostatically repulsive [42]. For our studies, we propose that all three geometries can be adopted for SulA degradation by ClpYQ protease: the 91st-Tyr (Y) of the ClpY hexamer conjugates with SulA at its 143rd-Phe (F) through transient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 attractive activity, to unfold/translocate SulA into the inner region for further degradation by ClpQ. In the subsequent process, a transient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 repulsive interaction likely occurs between these ClpY and SulA to release the unfolded protein for the processive degradation. Similarly, a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction could be attractive or repulsive between amino acids [53]. Yet, its T-shaped geometry has an interaction stronger than the parallel stacking geometry. Our data indicated that these different geometries could also be applied in SulAF143K degradation by ClpYQ and its derivative degraders. Conversely, the mutants SulAF143R and SulAF143Y may adopt the parallel stacked geometry when their 143rd residue interacts with ClpYTyr91st residue, thereby hindering the initial unfolding/translocation action and subsequent degradation process. Moreover, the cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions of neutral histidine (His) are attractive, and the cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions of protonated histidine (His+) are repulsive [54]. These propositions also further support that a transient cation\u2013\u03c0 attractive interaction first occurs between SulAF143K and ClpYY91H hexamers for the closed-down state, and after translocating substrates into the inner region near the ClpQ catalytic site, a cation\u2013\u03c0 repulsive interaction for the opened-up state is adopted for the substrate release in the degradation process. We assume that cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions with a histidine can be reversibly switched between attractive and repulsive interaction under different pH condition, as the histidine becomes protonated and unprotonated. Perceptibly, cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions affect the two protonation types of histidine. Since the pKa value of histidine changes according to its ambient environment, the amino acid can act as a proton donor or acceptor, in addition to being neutral. Our degradation buffer has a pH value of 7.4, which indicates that the exposed 91st-histidine in the ClpYY91H hexamer carries a neutral charge and favors an attractive interaction with\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17353 13 of 17\nthe cation lysine in SulAF143K. This pH value (7.4) also reflects the physiological state of intracellular fluids in bacteria, in which the exposed 91st-histidine in ClpYY91H also retains the neutral state for the attractive interaction. However, after the unfolding/translocation of the substrates through the pore site into the inner spaces near the ClpQ core site, the 91st histidine residue of ClpYY91H could be surrounded in a localized acidic environment, which promotes a repulsive interactive activity between SulA-Lys143rd and ClpY-His91st residues to release the unfolded substrate for the progressive degradation. However, notably, ClpQ exhibits higher catalytic activity in an alkaline environment [24], and the substrate-bound ClpQ at the N-terminal Thr-1 active site could allosterically enhance the ATPase activity of ClpY hexamers and their reciprocal binding affinity [22]. Consequently, it cannot be ruled out that ClpQ, with its catalytic Thr-1 site, might subsequently interact with the unfolded polypeptide in the inner core, facilitating the release of denatured substrate from ClpY for the final cleavage. Although this study is the first report characterizing the specific \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 or cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction towards the natural substrate degradation by an ATP-dependent protease, we expect that similar evidence for substrate degradation by other proteases could be found in the future to strengthen the mechanistic model. Other arduous experiments are still needed to explore the molecular mechanisms of substrate degradation by ATP-dependent proteases."

At 30 \u25e6C, the overnight transformed bacterial cultures were inoculated at 1:100 dilution onto LB media with 0.5% L-arabinose and the appropriate antibiotics. When the growth of bacterial cells reached the mid-log phase, 1 mM IPTG was added. After incubation for about 2 h, 2 mL cell cultures of the samples were collected by means of centrifugation after recording OD600. The bacterial cell pellets were then dissolved in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Each sample normalized to OD600 was loaded individually on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. After gel running, the proteins were transferred to the PVDF membrane. Subsequently, MBP-SulA and its derivatives on the PVDF membranes were detected by monoclonal anti-MBP (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) in Western blot assays. In\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17353 14 of 17\naddition, ClpY and its derivatives were detected using a multiple ClpY anti-serum and ClpQ was also detected using a multiple ClpQ anti-serum. The other in vivo degradation assays were performed via the following procedures. The CH21411 [(lon, clpQ, clpY, sulA, ftsZ (SfiB*)] mutant strain carrying pBAD33-clpQ+ and pBAD24-clpY+ was serially transformed with pTH18kr-malE-sulA+ and its derivatives. Then, the overnight-transformed bacterial cultures were inoculated into LB media with 0.5% L-arabinose and appropriate antibiotics. Subsequently, IPTG (at a final concentration of 1mM) was added after the bacterial cells grew to the mid-log phase. In addition, with an incubation of about 2 h, 2 mL cell cultures of the samples were collected and OD600 was recorded. The collected bacterial cell pellets were then dissolved in 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer with boiling and the dissolved proteins were normalized according to OD600 before being loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and later transferred to PVDF membranes. Afterward, MBP-SulA and its derivatives on the PVDF membranes were detected using methods described above. The third set of in vivo degradation experiments were performed using the following methods. The CH21409 [(lon, sulA, ftsZ (SfiB*)] and CH21411 [(lon, clpQ, clpY, sulA, ftsZ (SfiB*)] mutant strains were both serially transformed with pTH18kr-malE-sulA+ and its derivatives. The resultant transformed bacterial cells carrying sulA+ or different sulA mutant plasmids were then separately grown on LB with kanamycin antibiotic at 41 \u25e6C. After the bacterial cells grew to the mid-log phase, IPTG with a final concentration of 1 mM was added to induce protein synthesis for about 1h. Immediately, spectinomycin, with a final concentration of 150 \u00b5g/mL, was added to stop the new synthesis of proteins at time 0 and the bacterial cultures were then collected at specific time intervals alongside the recording of OD600 reading values. After centrifugation, the bacterial pellets were then dissolved in 2X SDS-PAGE sampling buffers for Western blot assays. Sample loading was normalized according to OD600 and equal amounts of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE before transferring to PVDF membrane. MBP-SulA and its derivatives on the PVDF membranes were detected using the methods described above. The relative amounts of MBP-SulA and its derivatives in bacteria were analyzed using Image J (version 1.45d) [56]."
