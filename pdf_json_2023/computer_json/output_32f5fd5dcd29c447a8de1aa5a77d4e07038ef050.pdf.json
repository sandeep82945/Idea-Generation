    "abstractText": "Sampling from the q-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer science. On general graphs, this problem is computationally hard, and this hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the q-state ferromagnetic Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of the widely-used Swendsen\u2013Wang dynamics and the closely related random-cluster dynamics. These are non-local Markov chains that have long been believed to converge rapidly to equilibrium at low temperatures. At the same time, the hardness of the sampling problem suggests that even among bounded degree graphs, this cannot always be the case. Our results demonstrate that the key graph property behind fast or slow convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at large p \u0103 1, it has a unique giant component of linear size, and the complement of that giant component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the Swendsen\u2013Wang and random-cluster dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a) graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold. In the process, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local Markov chains, including a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the presence of long-range correlations, an understanding of spatial mixing properties on trees with random boundary conditions, and an analysis of burn-in phases at low temperatures.",

            "text": "The q-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a classical spin system model central to probability theory and with applications in statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and other fields. It is defined on a graph G \u201c pV pGq, EpGqq as a probability distribution over configurations in \u2126P \u201c t1, ..., quV pGq, with a parameter \u03b2 \u0105 0, corresponding to the inverse temperature in physical applications, controlling the strength of the interaction between the edges ofG. Formally, the probability of each configuration \u03c3 P \u2126P is given by:\n\u00b5G,\u03b2,qp\u03c3q \u201c 1\nZPG,\u03b2,q exp\n\u00b4\n\u03b2 \u00ff\ntu,vuPEpGq 1t\u03c3puq \u201c \u03c3pvqu\n\u00af\n. (1.1)\nThe factor ZPG,\u03b2,q is a normalization constant and is known as the partition function; \u03c3puq denotes the color or spin value of the configuration \u03c3 at vertex u. The classical Ising model corresponds to the q \u201c 2 case.\nThe question of sampling from the ferromagnetic Potts model is an important one and has been extensively studied on a variety of graphs and temperature regimes (i.e., different values of \u03b2). In general, it is known that the problem of approximately sampling from the ferromagnetic Potts model for q \u011b 3 and \u03b2 large is #BIS-hard, in the sense that there exist graphs, including bounded degree ones, for which the approximate sampling problem is as hard as approximately counting the number of independent sets on bipartite graphs [GJ12, GS\u030cVY16]. This sharply contrasts with the ferromagnetic Ising case (q \u201c 2), where polynomial-time samplers have been known since the 1990s [JS93, RW99]. At the same time, for some families of graphs, notably including Zd and expander graphs, the existence of polynomial-time sampling algorithms has recently been shown for the Potts model at low temperatures: see, e.g., [HPR20, BCH`20, CDK20, JKP20, CGG`21, HJP23, CDF`22, GS23]. This begs the question of what are the underlying graph structures and temperatures that cause tractability or hardness of approximately sampling from (1.1). We study this from the perspective of widely-used Markov chain-based algorithms.\nar X\niv :2\n30 4.\n03 18\n2v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nPR ]\n6 A\npr 2\n02 3\nOne fundamental approach to sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form of (1.1) is via Markov chains whose stationary distribution is exactly \u00b5G,\u03b2,q. The simplest such Markov chain is the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model (also known as the Gibbs sampler), which updates the state of a randomly chosen vertex at each step. Its simplicity makes it quite appealing to practitioners, but it is known to take exponentially (in polyp|V |q) many steps to equilibrate at low temperatures (\u03b2 large). In lieu of this, in order to sample from (1.1), an oft-used approach is a different family of Markov chains based on the Edwards\u2013Sokal coupling of the ferromagnetic Potts model to a graphical model called the random-cluster model [ES88]: see (2.1) for its definition. This family of Markov chains includes the extensively studied Swendsen\u2013Wang (SW) dynamics, and its close relative, the Glauber dynamics for the random-cluster model.\nThese Markov chains make non-local updates, and it has long been conjectured that they bypass the bottlenecks that slow down the convergence of the Potts Glauber dynamics at low temperatures when q \u011b 3. At the same time, the aforementioned #BIS-hardness of the sampling problem at low temperatures suggests that these Markov chains could not have a polynomial speed of convergence on all graphs. For the sake of completeness, we mention that at high temperatures (small \u03b2), these Markov chains converge quickly but have a larger computational overhead per step than the Potts Glauber dynamics [BCC`22]; there are also \u201cintermediate\u201d temperature regimes corresponding to first-order phase transitions where these Markov chains are known to converge exponentially slowly to equilibrium [GJ97,BCT12,GL18,GLP19,COGG`23].\nIn this paper, we systematically analyze these Edwards\u2013Sokal based Markov chains on general graphs at low temperatures. In the process, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local chains and arrive at a fundamental explanation for the graph properties determining whether these Markov chains converge quickly or slowly at low temperatures (i.e., large, but independent of the system size, values of \u03b2).\nLet us define the Markov chains of interest. For a unified discussion, it is convenient to reparametrize \u03b2 by p \u201c 1 \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03b2 . Notice that low-temperature settings corresponding to \u03b2 large correspond to p close to 1. The SW dynamics transitions from a configuration \u03c3t P \u2126P to \u03c3t`1 P \u2126P as follows:\n(1) Independently, for every e \u201c tu, vu P EpGq if \u03c3tpuq \u201c \u03c3tpvq include e in Et with probability p; (2) Independently, for every connected component C in pV pGq, Etq, draw a color c P t1, ..., qu uni-\nformly at random, and set \u03c3t`1pvq \u201c c for all v P C. It can be checked that the SW dynamics is reversible with respect to \u00b5G,\u03b2,q and thus converges to it. In effect, the SW dynamics moves on the larger probability space of Potts model configurations together with randomcluster configurations. The configurations of this model consist of edge subsets, i.e., \u2126RC \u201c t0, 1uEpGq, and the SW dynamics can be interpreted as alternating steps of sampling a random-cluster configuration Et conditionally on the Potts configuration \u03c3t, then sampling the Potts configuration \u03c3t`1 conditionally on Et.\nA closely related Markov chain is the Glauber dynamics that moves in the space of random-cluster configurations; for brevity, we call this Markov chain the FK dynamics since the random-cluster model is also known as the FK model. Here, given an edge subset Et P \u2126RC, we generate Et`1 by:\n(1) Pick an edge e P EpGq uniformly at random; (2) Set Et`1 \u201c Et Y teu with probability:\n#\np if e is a cut-edge in Et; p\u0302 :\u201c pp`p1\u00b4pqq if e is not a cut-edge in Et;\n(1.2)\nand Et`1 \u201c Etzteu otherwise. A cut-edge is an edge whose state affects the number of connected components of the configuration. It can be checked that the FK dynamics converges to the random-cluster distribution (2.1). After convergence, one may produce a sample from the corresponding q-state Potts measure (the one with \u03b2 so that p \u201c 1 \u00b4 e\u00b4\u03b2) with little overhead by independently assigning states uniformly amongst t1, ..., qu to each connected component of the random-cluster configuration, as in step (2) of the SW dynamics above. As such, the FK dynamics provides an alternative Markov chain that can be used to sample from (1.1).\nTo formalize convergence rates of these Markov chains, recall that the mixing time of a Markov chain is the number of steps required to reach a distribution close to the stationary distribution (in total variation\ndistance), assuming the worst possible starting state: see (2.2) for the formal definition. It is known that the mixing times of the SW and FK dynamics can differ only up to a Op|EpGq|q factor (see [Ull14]).\nBoth the SW and FK dynamics are conjectured to overcome some of the key difficulties associated with sampling from the Potts distribution quickly at low temperatures. They are, therefore, quite popular, but their non-locality makes the rigorous analysis of their mixing times significantly more challenging than their Potts Glauber dynamics counterparts. In recent years, significant progress has been made in establishing optimal mixing time bounds for the SW and FK dynamics in high-temperature regimes where the corresponding Potts Glauber dynamics is also known to be fast mixing; see, e.g., [BCP`21, BCS\u030cV22, BCC`22, GS23]. These works have resulted in optimal (or nearly optimal) mixing time bounds for SW and FK dynamics that hold under various correlation decay conditions (e.g., strong spatial mixing, tree uniqueness, Dobrushin uniqueness, spectral independence, etc.). In particular, p \u00c0 1{\u2206 implies fast mixing for all graphs of maximum degree \u2206. By contrast, in the low-temperature setting, where correlations do not decay, the Potts Glauber dynamics converges slowly, and alternative efficient sampling algorithms are most needed, there is no generic criterion guaranteeing that the SW and FK dynamics mix quickly.\nIn fact, rigorous bounds for the mixing time of the SW and FK dynamics at low temperatures are rare and can be summarized as follows. In the Ising case of q \u201c 2, [GJ17] showed that these Markov chains mix in Opn10q time on all n-vertex graphs and all p. On the complete graph, [BS15, GS\u030cV15, BSZ22] establish nearly-optimal mixing time bounds throughout the low-temperature regime. On more sophisticated geometries, progress has been limited to the special case of the integer lattice Zd. In particular, in [Ull13, BS17], fast mixing was shown in the low-temperature regime on subsets of Z2 via planar duality to hightemperatures (see also [Mar92] for sharper bounds for the SW dynamics at low temperatures in the Ising case). Recently [GS23] showed fast mixing at low temperatures in cubes in Zd. For general graphs, the only low-temperature criterion known to ensure fast mixing is p \u0105 1\u00b4Op1{|EpGq|q [Hub04].\nThis leaves a wealth of questions to explore on general families of graphs, notably including the mixing times of the SW and FK dynamics at values of p close to 1, but importantly, independent of the graph size. We consider this question for two broad families of bounded-degree graphs: graphs of at most stretchedexponential volume growth, and locally treelike graphs (which allow for exponential volume growth). We show that for all such graphs, fast mixing of the SW and FK dynamics at low enough temperatures is ensured if the independent edge-percolation process on the graph, where an edge-set r\u03c9 \u0102 EpGq is obtained by keeping each edge with probability p\u0303, independently, has a strongly supercritical phase (i.e., for p\u0303 close to 1, all large connected sets in G intersect the giant component of \u03c9\u0303; see Definition 1.2 and 1.4 for precise definitions). To illustrate the necessity of this condition, for any arbitrarily large p \u0103 1, we construct explicit graphs\u2014both ones of polynomial volume growth, and ones that are locally treelike\u2014on which the edge-percolation is not in a strongly supercritical phase, and in turn, the SW and FK dynamics mix slowly.\nThe class of graphs that have strongly supercritical phases for their edge-percolation at is an area of deep mathematical research, and it is closely connected to whether the graph has isoperimetric dimension strictly larger than 1. The key takeaway from our results is thus a purely geometric mechanism underlying fast or slow mixing of the SW and FK dynamics at large p \u0103 1 on two large families of bounded degree graphs.\n1.1. Graphs of at most stretched-exponential growth. The first general class of graphs for which we establish fast mixing of the SW and FK dynamics at low temperatures under the percolation condition are bounded-degree graphs that have at most stretched-exponential volume growth. Let us introduce some notation: in what follows, we think of G \u201c pV pGq, EpGqq as a connected graph on n vertices, with maximum degree \u2206 \u011b 3, and we fix any q \u011b 2. For a vertex v P V pGq, let BRpvq \u201c tw : dGpv, wq \u010f Ru be the set of vertices at graph distance at most R from v. For a subset A \u0102 V pGq, let BeA \u0102 EpGq denote the edge boundary of A, i.e., the set of edges in EpGq with exactly one endpoint in A. Definition 1.1. The graph G has \u03b7-stretched-exponential volume growth if |BRpvq| \u010f eR \u03b7 all v P V pGq and all R sufficiently large (i.e., R \u011b R0 for some R0 independent of n; for convenience, take R0 \u201c 1{\u03b7). We show that the SW and FK dynamics on these graphs are rapidly mixing when the independent edge-\npercolation process on the underlying graph G has a \u201cstrong supercritical phase\u201d which we define next. For\np\u0303 P p0, 1q, let r\u03c0G \u201c \u00c2 ePEpGq Bernoullipp\u0303q denote the independent edge-percolation distribution for G. We note that if r\u03c9 is drawn from r\u03c0G (i.e., r\u03c9 \u201e r\u03c0G), then we can think of r\u03c9 as, both, a vector in t0, 1uEpGq or as a subset of edges of EpGq. For B \u0102 EpGq, let r\u03c9pBq P t0, 1uB denote the state of the edges from B in r\u03c9pBq.\nDefinition 1.2. Let r\u03c9 \u201e r\u03c0G. We say that G has a strong supercritical phase (with parameters \u03b4, p\u0303) if there exists p\u0303 \u0103 1 and \u03b4 \u0105 0 such that for every v P V pGq, the probability that there exists a connected set A Q v having ` \u010f |A| \u010f n{2 with r\u03c9pBeAq \u201d 0 is at most expp\u00b4`\u03b4{p1`\u03b4qq, for all ` sufficiently large (again, meaning ` \u011b `0 for some `0 independent of n, for instance for convenience `0 \u201c 1{\u03b4).\nRoughly the definition says that the probability that there exists a set A \u0102 V pGq that is connected in G, contains v, and has size at least `, but does not intersect the largest component in r\u03c9, is stretchedexponentially small in ` (with the exponent governed by the parameter \u03b4 \u0105 0, which as we will comment on shortly is related to the isoperimetric dimension of the underlying graph).\nTheorem 1.3. There exists \u03b70p\u03b4q \u0105 0 and p0p\u2206, q, \u03b4, p\u0303q \u0103 1, such that for every graph G with a strong supercritical phase (with parameters \u03b4, p\u0303) and \u03b7-stretched-exponential volume growth for some \u03b7 \u010f \u03b70:\n(1) The mixing time of SW dynamics on G is Opn2 log nq for every p \u011b p0. (2) The mixing time of the FK dynamics on G is Opn log nq for every p \u011b p0.\nIn view of this theorem, it is natural to wonder what graphs have a strong supercritical phase. It is expected that general graph families with isoperimetric dimension at least 1 ` \u03b4 (meaning that |BeA| \u011b |A|\u03b4{p1`\u03b4q for all subsets A \u0102 V pGq with |A| \u010f n{2) have a strong supercritical phase. Implications of this sort are the subject of deep mathematical work under the additional assumption of vertex transitivity; see e.g., the recent work of [HT21, EH21]. In particular, if one assumes both vertex transitivity and polynomial volume growth, then the graph has strong supercritical phase, (see e.g., [CMT21], which tackles the harder problem of understanding the supercritical phase down to a sharp threshold). Subsets of Zd and other lattices that are uniformly at least p1 ` \u03b4q-dimensional, and planar graphs with a bounded-degree planar dual are concrete examples of graphs that have a strong supercritical phase.\nOur proof of Theorem 1.3 relies on a novel framework for controlling the rate at which discrepancies spread between two coupled low-temperature FK dynamics chains that agree inside, say, a ball of radius R around a vertex, but that may disagree outside it. This is sometimes called disagreement percolation, and we use it, after a burn-in period for the chain (a short period of time after which we can ensure that the certain \u201ctypical\u201d properties of random-cluster configurations are achieved, even though the chain has not equilibrated), to perform space-time recursions to derive our mixing time bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time disagreement percolation has been implemented in a low-temperature setting for non-local Markov chains like the SW or FK dynamics, where the giant component could hypothetically spread disagreements instantaneously (except in the special case of Z2 where low and high temperatures are dual to one another). We say more about the obstacles to proving Theorem 1.3 using existing tools and the technical novelties in our low-temperature disagreement percolation framework in Section 1.4.\nSince [vdB93], bounds on the rate of disagreement percolation have been a tool used to prove a variety of other results for spin systems, including bounds on uniqueness thresholds, equivalences of spatial and temporal mixing [DSVW04], and tight lower bounds for the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics [HS05]. We do not explore these directions here, but our low-temperature disagreement percolation, which is selfcontained to Section 3, opens up those same arguments for the low-temperature random-cluster model and its dynamics. For example, extending the lower bounds of [HS05] would show that the Opn log nq in (2) in Theorem 1.3 is tight; by contrast the resulting lower bound for SW dynamics would be \u2126plog nq.\n1.2. Locally treelike graphs. We consider next the SW and FK dynamics on locally treelike graphs. In this setting, we establish fast mixing on graphs that have a strong supercritical phase with \u201c\u03b4 \u201c 8\u201d in Definition 1.2. That is to say that we assume true exponential tails on the boundaries of non-giant components, to compete with the exponential volume growth.\nDefinition 1.4. We say that G has an exponentially strong supercritical phase if there exists p\u03030 \u0103 1 such that for every p\u0303 \u0105 p\u03030 and every v P V pGq, the probability that there exists a connected set A Q v having ` \u010f |A| \u010f n{2 with r\u03c9pBeAq \u201d 0 is at most expp\u00b4cp\u0303 `q for some cp\u0303 going to8 as p\u0303 to 1.\nWhile the notion of an exponentially strong supercritical phase is a property of independent edge-percolation on the graph, a simple geometric criterion of expansion, for instance, ensures that this property holds. In particular, if G is an \u03b1-edge-expander graph, in the sense that for all A \u0102 V pGq such that |A| \u010f n{2, we have |BeA| \u011b \u03b1|A|, then the assumption holds for a cp\u0303p\u03b1,\u2206q \u0105 0.\nIn this regime where the exponential volume growth is permitted, we restrict to locally treelike graphs.\nDefinition 1.5. We say a graph G is pK,Lq-locally treelike if for every v P V pGq, the removal of at most K edges from EpBLpV qq induces a tree on BLpvq.\nOur main result for locally treelike graphs is the following near-optimal fast mixing bound.\nTheorem 1.6. Fix any \u03b5, \u03b7 \u0105 0. There exists p0p\u2206, q,K, p\u03030, cp\u0303, \u03b7, \u03b5q \u0103 1 such that ifG has an exponentially strong supercritical phase (with parameter p\u03030), minimum degree 3, and is pK, \u03b7 log nq-locally treelike:\n(1) The mixing time of SW dynamics on G is Opn2`\u03b5q for every p \u011b p0. (2) The mixing time of FK dynamics on G is Opn1`\u03b5q for every p \u011b p0.\nThe most canonical example of a graph that satisfies all the conditions in this theorem is a \u2206-regular random graph (i.e., a graph drawn uniformly at random from the set of all \u2206-regular graphs on n-vertices). This is a setting that has attracted plenty of attention (see, e.g., [BGG`18, BG21, COGG`23, HJP23]), and Theorem 1.6 provides fast mixing bounds for the SW and FK dynamics on these graphs at low temperatures. (Note that the bounds will hold with probability 1\u00b4 op1q over the choice of the random graph.)\nUnlike the sub-exponential growth setting, alternative sampling algorithms were known to exist for the Potts model on expander graphs at low temperatures using the cluster expansion and polymer dynamics (see, e.g., [JKP20,CGG`21,BCP22,CDF`22]). Still, to our knowledge, ours is the first proof of sub-exponential mixing times for the SW and FK dynamics at low temperatures (even just for random graphs).\nRegarding the proof techniques, on graphs of exponential growth, the low-temperature disagreement percolation framework used to establish Theorem 1.3 breaks down. Even in ideal situations like the Ising model, the optimal recursion obtained from the disagreement percolation framework would not yield rapid mixing on graphs of exponential growth. We, therefore, resort to a vastly different approach, where we utilize a burn-in phase, the censoring technique of [PW13], and new spatial mixing results for the randomcluster model on trees amongst a (random) class of sufficiently wired boundary conditions. The latter bound applies in settings where spatial mixing between the wired and free boundary conditions does not hold.\nRemark 1.7. The bounds of Theorems 1.3 and 1.6 are stated for any integer q \u011b 2 so that statements apply both to the SW and FK dynamics. The random-cluster model also makes sense for non-integer q \u011b 1 and our fast mixing results for the FK dynamics apply in this level of generality. In fact, the random-cluster model is defined for q \u0105 0 but has very different features (negative vs. positive correlations) when q P p0, 1q. It was shown in [ALGV19] that the FK dynamics mixes in polynomial time on all graphs when q P p0, 1q.\n1.3. Slow mixing in worst-case graphs. We complement our fast mixing result by establishing the existence of graphs for which, even at arbitrarily low temperatures, the SW and FK dynamics slow down exponentially. This is already suggested, though not guaranteed, by the #BIS-hardness of the sampling problem at low temperatures, and our constructions will illuminate the relationship between the notion of a strong supercritical phase for the underlying edge-percolation and the slow mixing of the dynamics.\nTheorem 1.8. Fix any q \u011b 3 and any p0 \u0103 1. There exists p P pp0, 1q and a sequence of graphs Gn on n vertices and maximum degree \u2206 such that the mixing time of the SW and FK dynamics on Gn is expp\u2126pnqq.\nThe constructions for Theorem 1.8 are simple and explicit. In particular, any family of graphs Hn that have slow mixing at some parameter value ps P p0, 1q\u2014typically the location of its order/disorder phase transition\u2014can be used as a gadget to construct augmented graphs Gn (depending on ps and p0) with many\nof the same properties as Hn (in terms of degree, rate of volume growth, etc.), and a comparable number of edges, for which the SW and FK dynamics are slowly mixing at some p P pp0, 1q. The graph augmentation leverages the series law of the random-cluster model to repeatedly split the edges ofHn, effectively inducing the behavior at ps in Hn to occur in Gn at p P pp0, 1q. Using the slow mixing of SW and FK dynamics at the critical point on random regular graphs from [COGG`23] as the gadget, Theorem 1.8 holds even if we impose that the graph is locally treelike and has exponential volume growth. Using the slow mixing at the critical point on pZ{nZq2 from [GL18], a variant of this theorem also holds for graphs of polynomial growth, but the lower bound there is of the form expp\u2126p ? nqq: see Theorem 7.1.\nRemark 1.9. Let us comment on the relationship of Theorem 1.8 to Theorems 1.3 and 1.6, given the slow mixing constructions can either have stretched-exponential growth or be locally treelike. Even if Hn has a strongly supercritical phase for its edge-percolation, when we perform the graph augmentation with the series law, the p\u0303 for which the edge-percolation on Gn has a strongly supercritical phase is pushed closer to 1. In geometric language, this is because the isoperimetric dimension is decreasing to 1, or the edgeexpansion is decreasing to 0, as the edges are split in series. In turn, this makes the p0 in Theorems 1.3 and 1.6 (above which we can prove fast mixing) larger than the p for which Theorem 1.8 gives slow mixing.\n1.4. Proof ideas. We now discuss our proof ideas for the fast mixing results, which are the more technically involved. (Our bounds on the SW dynamics follow from the bounds on the FK dynamics by [Ull14], so we focus on the FK dynamics.) We begin by describing some of the issues one runs into when trying to apply standard proof approaches to general families of graphs at large p.\n1.4.1. Difficulty with classical arguments. The first tool one might try is path coupling, arguing that the number of discrepancies between two configurations that differ on one edge contracts in expectation. The non-locality of the FK dynamics, however, and the presence of \u2126plog nq sized components at equilibrium means that a single discrepancy at an edge e can cause discrepancies at some \u2126plog nq many nearby edges, whereas the discrepancy only decreases if the edge e is selected to be updated. A smarter path coupling was used in [CF99, Hub04] to deduce fast mixing for the SW dynamics at high enough (but constant) temperatures, but in the low-temperature regime, their argument for fast mixing requires p \u0105 1\u00b4Op1{|EpGq|q.\nMany of the early fast mixing bounds on, say, the high-temperature Ising model are based on space-time recursions, i.e., arguments that compare the distance to stationarity across balls of time-dependent radii. This type of argument runs into the problem when translated to the FK dynamics that the updates in a small portion of the graph (say a small ball around a vertex) could depend on the configuration in the entire remainder rather than a local neighborhood. The one exception to this is the approach of [MO94] for the torus in Zd, which gave an implication from the weak-spatial mixing (WSM) condition to fast mixing of the Glauber dynamics. This implication was seen to indeed generalize to the FK dynamics in [HS22] (see also [GS23] where finite boxes with boundary conditions were allowed). However, WSM for the randomcluster model at large p is a delicate property whose proofs are very geometry specific. It is the case, for example, that on locally treelike graphs like the random regular graph, WSM fails at arbitrarily large p.\nAt high temperatures (small p), some of the difficulties with non-locality can be handled using the fact that in the random-cluster model, all connected components are small, and information is only propagated through these connected components. For instance, such an argument was used in [BS17] to implement the disagreement percolation space-time recursion for the high-temperature regime on Z2. (In Z2, the high and low temperature regimes are dual to one another, so the same argument could be performed using the dual model at low temperatures; that would be similar to the work of [Mar92] on the Ising SW dynamics.)\n1.4.2. Low-temperature disagreement percolation bounds. On graphs where the low-temperature randomcluster model does not have a natural high-temperature dual model, however, even at equilibrium, the nonlocality of the dynamics is hypothetically not confined since the giant component percolates through the entire graph. The starting point for many of our observations is that a (well-connected) giant component does not create non-local dependencies on its own. In particular, if two configurations that agree at distance R away from an edge e induce different marginals on e, it must be the case that in one of the two configurations,\neither e is incident to a non-giant component of size at leastR, or it disconnects a portion of the giant of size at least R from the 2-connected core of the giant. Whereas the giant component percolates throughout the whole graph, we show that under the assumption of a strong supercritical phase (Definition 1.2), these nongiant, or non-2-connected core connections have (stretched) exponential tails in FK dynamics configurations after an Opnq burn-in period. (In the first Opnq steps, disagreements can spread arbitrarily quickly.)\nThere are various other delicate points in implementing this argument, both combinatorial and probabilistic in nature that we describe in greater detail in Section 3 and 4. These include having to carefully approach various counting arguments and union bounds due to the non-localities and possible stretched exponential volume growth: see Remark 3.7 and the proof strategy described in Section 4.2. In all, we are able to obtain a space-time recursion on the probability of a disagreement at an edge after time t; the large value of p is used for as crude initial bound on this probability, which the recursion boosts into exponential decay, leading to the optimal Opn log nq mixing time bound of Theorem 1.3.\n1.4.3. Mixing after a burn-in phase on locally treelike graphs. When the volume growth is exponentially fast, the bounds and resulting space-time recursions from disagreement percolation break. Our approach here is therefore closer in inspiration to high-temperature arguments from [BG21, BG23] (also [MS09] in the Ising setting). Those papers localized the dynamics to the treelike balls BRpvq of the underlying graph using the censoring technique of [PW13], and used the high-temperature uniqueness on trees to reason that if two censored dynamics chains mix in BRpvq with their respective boundary conditions, then they are coupled at the root of the ball with high probability. The mixing time on the local balls was relatively simple to deduce since the trees would have nearly free boundary conditions, which induce product chains.\nIn our low-temperature setting, the key intuition is that after a burn-in period, the boundary conditions induced on balls of radius \u03b7 log n are \u201csufficiently wired\u201d, i.e., that they have one (random) linear-sized wired component, and only Op1q many other Op1q-sized components. Given this, to get Theorem 1.6, we show that FK dynamics on trees with such boundary conditions mix in polynomial time, and that although there is no WSM between the free and wired boundary conditions on trees, two sufficiently wired boundary conditions do induce similar marginals on the root. This latter step requires a careful revealing scheme to prove spatial mixing on trees with randomly wired boundary conditions; that is the content of Section 5.1."

            "text": "In this section, we outline our global notation, and describe some preliminaries on the random-cluster model and the FK dynamics. Throughout the paper, n will be assumed to be sufficiently large. We also use C to denote a generic constant C \u0105 0, not depending on n, which may vary from line to line. Our underlying graph will be G \u201c pV pGq, EpGqq and will have n vertices and maximum degree \u2206.\nFor an edge-subset A \u0102 EpGq, we write V pAq for the set of vertices contained in edges in A. Its vertex boundary BA is the set of vertices in A with neighbors in Ac \u201c EpGqzA. Its (outer) edge-boundary BeA is the set of edges in EpGqzA that have one end-point in V pAq and one endpoint in V pGqzV pAq. We use CvpAq to denote the connected component of v in the subgraph pV pGq, Aq. An edge e is a cut-edge in A if there is a vertex v for which CvpA Y teuq \u2030 CvpAzteuq. We use C1pAq to denote the largest component in \u03c9 (chosen arbitrarily if two have the same size).\n2.1. The random-cluster model. The random-cluster model with parameters p P p0, 1q and q \u0105 0 is a probability distribution over edge-subsets \u03c9 \u010e EpGq, equivalently identified with \u03c9 P t0, 1uEpGq, given by\n\u03c0G,p,qp\u03c9q9 p|\u03c9|p1\u00b4 pq|EpGq|\u00b4|\u03c9|qkp\u03c9q , (2.1)\nwhere kp\u03c9q denotes the number of connected components in pV pGq, \u03c9q. When clear from context, we drop p and q and sometimes G from the notation. The random-cluster model satisfies the following domain Markov property: for A \u0102 EpGq, conditional on \u03c9pEpGqzAq, the distribution of \u03c9pAq is a random-cluster model with the same parameters, with boundary conditions on BA induced by \u03c9pEpGqzAq. Random-cluster boundary conditions are defined in generality as follows.\nDefinition 2.1. Given a graph G and a vertex subset BB, a boundary condition \u03be on BB is a partition of BB. The random-cluster model on G with boundary conditions \u03be, denoted \u03c0\u03beG is defined as in (2.1), except that the components of \u03be are identified (\u201cwired\u201d) when counting the number of components kp\u03c9q.\nCertain important boundary conditions are the wired one, denoted 1, where all vertices of BA are in the same component of \u03be; the free, denoted 0, where all vertices of BA are in distinct components of \u03be, and if A is a subgraph of G, those induced by \u03c9pEpGqzEpAqq, meaning vertices of BA are in the same component of \u03be if and only if they are connected through \u03c9pEpGqzEpAqq. In this paper, we restrict our attention to the case of q \u011b 1 where the model exhibits positive correlations. As a consequence, given two boundary conditions \u03be and \u03be1 on G, where \u03be \u011b \u03be1 (meaning \u03be is a coarser partition than \u03be1), we have \u03c0\u03beG \u013e \u03c0 \u03be1 G .\n2.2. Mixing times. For a Markov chain pXkqk on a finite state space \u2126 with transition matrix P , reversible with respect to a distribution \u00b5, its mixing time is defined as:\ntMIX \u201c tMIXp1{4q , where tMIXp\u03b5q \u201c mintk : max x0P\u2126 }PpXx0k P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u00b5}TV \u010f \u03b5u , (2.2)\nwhere Xx0k indicates that Xk is initialized from x0, and where } \u00a8 }TV denotes total-variation distance. The total-variation distance to \u00b5 satisfies a sub-multiplicativity property, whereby tMIXp\u03b5q \u010f tMIX \u00a8 log2p2{\u03b5q.\n2.3. FK dynamics. Recall the definition of (discrete-time) FK dynamics from the introduction. It will be preferable in our proofs to work with the continuous-time FK dynamics pXtqt\u01050. In this variant, the edges of EpGq are assigned rate-1 Poisson clocks and if the clock at an edge e rings at time t, we make an update according to (1.2). It is a standard fact that the mixing time of the discrete-time chain is comparable, up to constants, with |EpGq| times the mixing time of the continuous-time process. In particular, it suffices to show an Oplog nq bound for Theorem 1.3 and an n\u03b5 bound for Theorem 1.6 for the continuous-time FK dynamics. FK dynamics updates with boundary conditions \u03be are like (1.2), except that the cut-edge status of e is determined taking into account the wirings of the components of \u03be.\nThe FK dynamics is monotone, meaning that if x0 \u011b y0 (under the natural partial order on subsets) then Xx0t \u013e X y0 t for all t \u011b 0, where \u013e denotes stochastic domination. I.e., there exists a grand coupling of all the Markov chains tpXx0t qtux0P\u2126RC (generated by independent Poisson clocks and independent sequences of i.i.d. Unifr0, 1s random variables at every edge) such that Xx0t \u011b X y0 t for all x0 \u011b y0 and t \u011b 0.\nA further monotonicity property we will use is with respect to the independent edge-percolation (the random-cluster model with q \u201c 1). Recall p\u0302 from (2.1); it is easy to see that \u03c0G,p,q \u013e \u03c0G,p\u0302,1."

            "heading": "3. LOW-TEMPERATURE DISAGREEMENT PERCOLATION",
            "text": "In this section, we develop the FK-dyanmics disagreement percolation framework that works at sufficiently low temperatures, in particular in the presence of a giant component. In reality, this new disagreement percolation bound works simultaneously at high and low temperatures and localizes the spread of disagreements even in the presence of a large giant component, so long as all other components (and portions of the giant dangling off of its 2-connected core) are small. Moreover, it can work on graphs that have volume growth up to a stretched exponential, which requires new ideas: see Remark 3.7.\nIn this section, G can be an arbitrary graph of maximum degree \u2206. We fix an arbitrary o P V pGq and R \u0105 0, and letBR \u201c BRpoq. The dependencies on o will be kept implicit. The fundamental building blocks of our disagreement set will be finite-connectivity clusters; these will disentangle the non-locality of the giant component, which percolates at low temperature, from the edges through which disagreements arise.\nDefinition 3.1. Define the finite (or non-giant) component of a vertex v in a random-cluster configuration \u03c9 as Cvp\u03c9zEpC1p\u03c9qqq, and denote it by C\u20301v p\u03c9q.\nSince the FK dynamics updates at edge e \u201c tu, vu are oblivious to the state of e in the configuration, and only care about the connectivity of u and v in \u03c9ze \u201c \u03c9zteu, we consider the finite component of a vertex with respect to the configuration \u03c9ze rather than \u03c9 itself. Specifically, we often consider C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq for an\nedge e that is incident to Cvp\u03c9q. In that case, if v R C1p\u03c9q, then C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq \u201c Cvp\u03c9zeq; if v P C1p\u03c9q but v R C1p\u03c9zeq, we also have C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq \u201c Cvp\u03c9zeq; otherwise, C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq \u201c tvu.\nDefinition 3.2. Let CE\u20301v p\u03c9q be the set of all cut-edges e in \u03c9 that are incident to C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq; i.e., CE\u20301v p\u03c9q :\u201c te P EpBRq : e P Cutedgep\u03c9q , e \u201e C\u20301v p\u03c9zequ ,\nwhere Cutedgep\u03c9q denotes the set of cut-edges in \u03c9.\nObserve that for a configuration \u03c9 and a vertex v, if v R C1p\u03c9q, then CE\u20301v p\u03c9q contains all edges of BeCvp\u03c9q together with all cut-edges from EpCvp\u03c9qq. Otherwise, if v P C1p\u03c9q, the set CE\u20301v essentially captures the set of cut-edges in Cvp\u03c9q that disconnect v from the 2-connected core of C1p\u03c9q. We refer to Figure 3.1 for some illustrative depictions of such sets in Z2 (this is easiest for visualization, but it is key that our definitions do not rely on properties of Z2 like its dual graph, and thus work on general graphs).\nSuppose pXtq and pYtq are two instances of the FK dynamics on G coupled via the grand coupling introduced in Section 2.3; suppose also that X0pEpBRqq \u201c Y0pEpBRqq.\nDefinition 3.3. Iteratively construct what we call the disagreement set as follows. Let ptiqi\u011b1 be the times of the clock rings in EpBRq, let t0 \u201c 0, and let Ii \u201c rti\u00b41, tiq. Then\n(1) Initialize Dt \u201c EpGqzEpBRq for t P I1. (2) Suppose ei is the edge whose clock rings at time ti. If ei is in EpBRqzDt\u00b4i and ei is in CE \u20301 v pZq for\nsome v P BDt\u00b4i and Z P tXt\u00b4i , Yt\u00b4i u, let\nDt \u201c Dt\u00b4i Y teiu for all t P Ii`1;\nelse, let Dt \u201c Dt\u00b4i for all t P Ii`1. (We use the standard notation At\u00b4 to denote lims\u00d2tAs.)\nThe role of Dt is that it confines the set of edges on which a disagreement can possibly exist at time t.\nProposition 3.4. For all t \u011b 0, we have Xtpeq \u201c Ytpeq for all e R Dt.\nProof. We prove the claim inductively. It holds for all t P I1 since we assumed Xtpeq \u201c Ytpeq for e P EpBRq, and no clock rings occur in the interval I1. Supposing it holds for Ii, the only way it can not hold for t P Ii`1 is if the disagreement arises at the edge ei \u201c tui, viuwhen the clock rings at time ti. If ei P Dt\u00b4i , then since Dt\u00b4i \u0102 Dt, we have the claim. Per (1.2), if ei R Dt\u00b4i , in order for a disagreement to arise at ei, it must be the case that ei is a cut-edge in one of Xt\u00b4i , Yt\u00b4i but not in the other; that is, that ei P CutedgepZq for a Z P tXt\u00b4i , Yt\u00b4i u, but ei R CutedgepZ\u0302q for Z\u0302 \u201c tXt\u00b4i , Yt\u00b4i uztZu. In Z\u0302, the two endpoints of ei must be\nconnected. Since Xt\u00b4i pD c t\u00b4i q \u201c Yt\u00b4i pD c t\u00b4i q, this can only happen via a pair of paths from ui and vi that reach BDt\u00b4i in D c t\u00b4i\n. One of these paths must be in ZzEpC1pZzteuqq, since if both are in EpC1pZzteuqq, then ui and vi are in the same connected component of Zzei, contradicting the claim that ei was a cutedge in Z. As such, it must be that ei P CE\u20301v pZq for some v P BDt\u00b4i .\nWe now define an event on the realizations of the coupling pXt, Ytqt\u011b0 that guarantees that disagreements are unlikely to spread rapidly. This will be a bound on the size of finite-connections in EpBRq, as well as a bound on the number of cut-edges in a finite-component, which we will later show holds with high probability for the FK dynamics after a burn-in for G satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.3: see Proposition 4.2\nDefinition 3.5. A random-cluster configuration \u03c9 is in E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 if: p1q max\nvPBR max ePEpBRq diampC\u20301v p\u03c9zeqq \u010f `\u03b1 , and p2q max vPBR |CE\u20301v p\u03c9q| \u010f \u2206`\u03b3 .\nIn the applications in Section 4, we will take \u03b1 \u201c \u03b3 (depending on the \u03b4 for which Definition 1.2 holds); however, we write this section for general \u03b1, \u03b3 in case there are better choices in specific situations.\nProposition 3.6. Suppose pXtqt, pYtqt are FK dynamics chains, coupled by the grand coupling, and such that X0pEpBRqq \u201c Y0pEpBRqq.

By Proposition 3.4, the probability of the event under consideration is at most that of the event tDtXBR{2 \u2030 HuXE`,t where for ease of notation, E`,t :\u201c \u015et s\u201c0tXs, Ys P E`,\u03b1,\u03b3u .

Let w0 be the vertex in BDt\u00b4j0 for which f0 P CE\u20301w0 pZ0q for Z0 P tXt\u00b4j0 , Yt\u00b4j0 u (if there are multiple choices for w0 or Z, we choose arbitrarily). Given pfj , wj , Zjqj\u0103i, we construct the witness iteratively as follows: \u201a Let fi be the first edge incident to wi\u00b41 to be included in pDsqs\u011b0; i.e., fi\u2019s clock rang at time\ntji :\u201c infts : wi\u00b41 P Dsu\n\u201a Let wi be the vertex in BDt\u00b4ji and Zi P tXt\u00b4ji , Yt\u00b4ji u for which fi P CE\u20301wi pZiq.\n(Again, ambiguities are resolved arbitrarily.) Under this construction, the event XtpBR{2q \u2030 YtpBR{2q implies the existence of a witness pfi, wi, ZiqKi\u201c0 for some K such that\n(1) f0 P EpBR{2q and wK P BBR; (2) fi P CE\u20301wi pZiq for all i; (3) wi\u00b41 P fi for all i; (4) the clock ring at time tji is at edge fi.\nNotice that this construction is done backwards in time, i.e., tj0 \u0105 tj1 \u0105 \u00a8 \u00a8 \u00a8 \u0105 tjK . See Figure 3.2 for a depiction.\nWe will show that the probability that there exists such a witness and the event E`,t occurs satisfies the claimed bound. On the event E`,t, it must be the case that K \u011b R{p2`\u03b1q since the distances between fi and fi\u00b41 are bounded by `\u03b1. Furthermore, for any witness pfi, wi, ZiqKi\u201c0, there is a projection, which we also call a witness, pfi, wi, LiqKi\u201c0 where the label Li P tX,Y u indicates whether Zi \u201c X \u00b4 tji or Zi \u201c Yt\u00b4ji .\nThe total number of clock rings in G in r0, ts has a Poissonpt|EpGq|q distribution; let M denote this quantity. Note that by standard Poisson concentration, we have PpM \u011b 4t|EpGq|q \u010f expp\u00b4t|EpGq|q . Let us work on the event that M \u010f 4t|EpGq|. Let T \u201c tt1, ..., tMu be the sequence of clock ring times in |EpGq|.

For any subset of times J \u201c tjK , ..., j0u, given T , we denote by WJ,L the event that there exist pfi, wiqKi\u201c0 such that the triple pfi, wi, LiqKi\u201c0 is a witness and the clock ring at fi is at time tji for i \u201c 0, . . . ,K. There being ` M K \u02d8 choices of J , for any L P tX,Y uK :\nP ` Dpfi, wiqKi\u201c0 : pfi, wi, LiqKi\u201c0 is witness, E`,t | T q \u010f max J\n\u02c6\nM\nK\n\u02d9\nP ` WJ,L, E`,t | T \u02d8 .\nFor s \u011b 0, let Fs be the \u03c3-algebra generated by the grand coupling up to time s. We will now sequentially condition on Ft\u00b4ji , and enumerate over the possible choices for the edge fi (of which there will be at most `\u03b3 per item (2) of Definition 3.5), and then ask that the clock ring at time tji be at fi. More precisely, if for an edge g, Agl is the event that in the witness fl \u201c g, then we have for every i \u0103 K,\nmax gi`1,...,gK\nP ` WJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji , pAgll ql\u0105i \u02d8\n\u010f max gi`1,...,gK\n\u00ff\nwiPgi`1\n\u00ff\ngiPCE\u20301wi pZiq\nPpAgii ,WJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji , pAgll ql\u0105iqPpWJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji , pAgll ql\u011biq\n\u010f 2\u2206` \u03b3\n|EpGq| \u00a8 maxgi,...,gK P ` WJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji , pAgll ql\u011bi \u02d8 . (3.1)\nHere, the first inequality is a union bound over the potential choices of wi and then the potential choices of gi in the witness. (Notice that conditional on Ft\u00b4jK , the configuration ZK can be read-off from its label LK .) For the second inequality, we used the definition of E`,t to bound the number of summands in the second line by 2\u2206`\u03b3 , and we used the fact that conditionally on T , the locations of the clock rings are independent and uniform on EpGq, so given T and Ft\u00b4ji , the probability that the clock ring at time tji is at a fixed edge gi is 1{|EpGq|. We can condition (3.1) further on Ft\u00b4ji\u00b41 (recalling that tji \u0103 tji\u00b41) to arrive at the following relation between the probabilities for index i and index i\u00b4 1:\nmax gi`1,...,gK\nP ` WJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji , pAgll ql\u0105i \u02d8\n\u010f 2\u2206` \u03b3\n|EpGq| \u00a8 maxgi,...,gK P ` WJ,L, E`,t | T ,Ft\u00b4ji\u00b41 , pAgll ql\u011bi \u02d8 .\nThe same inequality holds for i \u201c K with an extra multiplicative factor of |BBR| for the initial choice of wK . Iterating this over all i, we arrive at the following bound on PpXtpBR{2q \u2030 YtpBR{2q, E`,tq:\n|BBR| \u00ff K\u011bR{p2`\u03b1q 2K max M\u010f4t|EpGq|\n\u02c6\nM\nK\n\u02d9\n\u00b4 2\u2206`\u03b3\n|EpGq|\n\u00afK ` e\u00b4t|EpGq| \u010f |BBR|\n\u00ff\nK\u011bR{p2`\u03b1q\n\u00b48\u2206`\u03b3et\nK\n\u00afK ` e\u00b4t|EpGq| .\nAt this stage, we see that if t \u010f \u03b5R{p16\u2206e`\u03b1`\u03b3q for \u03b5 \u0103 1{e, then this is at most\n|BBR|\u03b5R{p2` \u03b1q\n\u00ff j\u011b0 \u03b5j ` e\u00b4t|EpGq| \u010f C|BBR|e\u00b4R{p2` \u03b1q ` e\u00b4t|EpGq| .\nThe term e\u00b4t|EpGq| is absorbed since we have R \u010f diampGq \u010f EpGq trivially.\nRemark 3.7. Beyond the low-temperature construction of the disagreement region, we point out a subtlety in the above that may have gone unnoticed. In disagreement percolation bounds for high-temperature FK dynamics (e.g., in [BS17]), the typical analogue of E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 is simply that the largest cluster in BR has volume at most `. When counting the number of possible witnesses, one takes |B`pwiq| as a worst-case bound for the number of locations of the next disagreement along the chain in the witness. If the volume growth is stretched exponential, however, this does not work. The careful conditioning in (3.1) was essential to only count those edges CE\u20301wi that could be vulnerable to be the next edge in the witness, rather than the entire volume of a ball, keeping the count to a polynomial even in the presence of exponential volume growth."

            "text": "With the bound on the speed of information propagation at low temperatures from the previous section on hand, we proceed to establish Theorem 1.3. The event E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 from Definition 3.5 was crucial to controlling the speed of disagreement propagation, and our first aim (Section 4.2) is to establish that after an Op1q time burn-in period, E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 holds for a further Op1q ammount of time. Then in Section 4.3, we will build a space-time recursion to establish the desired mixing time bound.\n4.1. Dominating edge-percolation after a burn-in period. We start with a simple estimate showing that after an Op1q (continuous-time) burn-in period, the FK-dynamics started from any initialization stochastically dominates the edge-percolation at a parameter arbitrarily close to p\u0302 \u201c pqp1\u00b4pq`p . This will be crucial to many of our arguments throughout the paper.\nLemma 4.1. Fix p, q, \u03b4. There exists T0p\u03b4q such that X0t stochastically dominates \u03c0p\u0302\u00b4\u03b4,1 for all t \u011b T0. This also holds conditioned on TrT0,8q (the \u03c3-algebra generated by the clock rings from time T0 on).\nProof. Consider any edge e. Uniformly over all the possible randomness (Poisson clocks and uniform random variables) on edges of EpGqzteu, as well as all clock rings at e after time T0 (a to be determined constant depending only on \u03b4), on the event that the clock at e has rung by time t, its distribution stochastically dominates Berpp\u0302q per (1.2). The result follows if we let T0 be large enough that the probability that the clock at e has not rung by time T0 is less than \u03b4 (this is independent of the clock rings at e after T0).\nWe consistently use the notation r\u03c9 for independent edge-percolation processes on EpGq with parameter p\u0303, i.e., r\u03c9 \u201e \u03c0G,p\u0303,1. For ease of notation, we simply write r\u03c0G for the law of r\u03c9 on G.\n4.2. Burnt-in FK dynamics are in E`. Our next aim is to show that burnt-in FK dynamics configurations are in E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 with high probability. Recall the main assumption on our underlying graphs for Theorem 1.3, that the independent percolation on them has a strongly supercritical phase: Definition 1.2.\nRecall the event E`,\u03b1,\u03b3 from Definition 3.5 that governed the size of regions through which disagreements could possibly spread. In what follows, we fix \u03b4 \u0105 0 given to us by Definition 1.2, and let\nE` :\u201c E`,p1`\u03b4q{\u03b4,p1`\u03b4q{\u03b4 , i.e., \u03b1 \u201c \u03b3 \u201c p1` \u03b4q{\u03b4 . (4.1) For ease of notation, we use \u03b1 \u201c p1`\u03b4q{\u03b4 in the below. We continue to imagine a fixed vertex o P V pGq, and fixed R large, but independent of the graph, and let BR \u201c BRpoq; events and sets from the previous section\nare all defined with respect to this ball. Finally, `, R can be assumed to be sufficiently large (depending on \u03b7, \u03b4q. Our main result in this subsection is the following.\nProposition 4.2. Suppose G satisfies Definition 1.2 and has \u03b7-stretched exponential growth for \u03b7 less than some \u03b70p\u03b4q. There exists T0p\u03b4, \u03b7, qq such that for every initial configuration \u03c90 and every t \u011b T0,\nP \u00b4\n2t \u010f s\u201ct tX\u03c90s R E`u \u00af \u010f CteR\u03b7e\u00b4` .\nProof strategy. Establishing Proposition 4.2 is quite a bit more involved than it would be in a hightemperature setting (i.e., for small p). This is due both to the delicate graph-theoretic aspects of the event E`, its non-monotonicity, and its non-locality. In particular, the last one means that in the time interval rt, 2ts the number of edge updates that could hypothetically cause the FK dynamics to leave E` are t|EpGq|, rather than t|BR|; a naive union bound over this number would fail. We outline our strategy as follows:\n(1) In Definition 4.3 below, we define a proxy event G` which is monotone, ensures that E` occurs, and is more \u201clocal\u201d than E`. The relationship to E` under minimal assumptions on G is in Lemma 4.4. (2) Using Definition 1.2, we will show in Lemma 4.6 that G` holds with high probability for independent edge-percolation on G with a large enough parameter p\u0303. Since G` is monotone, we can translate this bound to the FK dynamics after an Op1q burn-in time per Lemma 4.1. (3) We then perform a careful \u201cunion bound\u201d over the update times between s P rt, 2ts. This could be a problem since there are order |EpGq| many updates in this time interval, whereas the probability of Gc` is only exponentially small in the local quantity `. Importantly, though, we use that the event G` is \u201clocalized\u201d to reason that far away edge updates are unlikely to induce a change in Gc` , in a summable manner. This argument is executed via Lemma 4.5 in the proof of Proposition 4.2.\nLet us begin by defining the proxy event G` and its variant G\u0304m for m \u011b `.\nDefinition 4.3. Define the event G` as the event that there does not exist a connected set A intersecting BR having `\u03b1 \u010f |A| \u010f n{2, and an edge e P BeA such that \u03c9pBeAzteuq \u201d 0.\nDefine the event G\u0304m as the event that there does not exist a connected set A intersecting BR, of size m\u03b1 \u010f |A| \u010f n{2, and a pair of edges e1, e2 P BeA such that \u03c9pBeAzte1, e2uq \u201d 0.\nNotice that unlike Ec` , the event Gc` is a monotone decreasing event, since it is the union (over A, e) of decreasing events. Similarly, the event G\u0304cm is a decreasing event.\nThe following graph theoretic lemma demonstrates that G` controls E`. It is important here to relate the number of cut-edges in the carefully constructed set of vulnerable edges in the disagreement percolation CE\u20301v to an easier quantity: the volume of a set of size smaller than n{2 with closed boundary.\nLemma 4.4. The event Ec` is a subset of the event Gc` .\nProof. On the complement of item (1) in Definition 3.5, there exists v P BR and e P EpBRq such that diampC\u20301v p\u03c9zeqq \u011b `\u03b1. Letting A \u201c C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq, we notice that |A| \u011b diampAq \u011b `\u03b1. At the same time, |A| \u010f n{2 since if |A| \u011b n{2 then Cvp\u03c9zeq \u201c C1p\u03c9zeq and C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq would be the trivial tvu. Finally A intersects BR since it contains v P BR, and under \u03c9, all of BeAzteu must be closed since A is a connected component of \u03c9ze.\nWe now show that the complement of item (2) in Definition 3.5 also implies Gc` . The essence of the argument is that CE\u20301v lower bounds the size of C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq for some e, but a little care must be taken due to the definition of CE\u20301v . We begin by constructing a tree from the set of all e P Cutedgep\u03c9q that are incident to Cvp\u03c9zeq; note this is a larger set than those e P Cutedgep\u03c9q that have e \u201e C\u20301v p\u03c9zeq, but we will subsequently restrict to this latter set. Suppose e is the set of all edges e in Cutedgep\u03c9q such that e \u201e Cvp\u03c9zeq. We iteratively associate a tree Tv \u201c Tvp\u03c9q to tvu Y e in the following natural way.\n(1) Identify the root of the tree with the vertex v; (2) All cut-edges in e are associated to descendants of the root.\n(3) For a vertex w of the tree (asssociated to a cut-edge ew in e), a cut-edge f P e is associated to a descendant of w if and only if it is disconnected from v by ew in \u03c9.\nThis process uniquely determines the tree since the children of wi,j are those descendants of wi,j that are not descendants of any of wi,j\u2019s other descendants. The fact that all of these are cut-edges also ensures that no cycles arise in the construction. Notice that the leaves of Tv are exactly BeCvp\u03c9q.\nWe next claim that the edges in\ne1 \u201c te P e : |Cvp\u03c9zeq| \u010f n{2u ,\nare a sub-tree of Tv. An edge e is in e but not in e1 if the component Cvp\u03c9zeq \u201c C1p\u03c9zeq. If this occurs for an edge e associated to vertex w in the tree, any edge f associated to a descendant of w will also have Cvp\u03c9zfq \u201c C1p\u03c9zfq since the difference in the component structures of \u03c9ze and \u03c9zf is that the latter has a larger Cv and one other component is correspondingly smaller. Therefore, the event that an edge is in e but not in e1 is a decreasing event on the tree Tv. As such the restriction of Tv to tvu Y e1 is itself a tree, which we can call T 1v.\nSelect an arbitrary vertex in BT 1v, i.e., its descendants are all in Tv but not in T 1v, and call its corresponding cut-edge e\u2039; also define \u03c9\u2039 \u201c \u03c9ze\u2039. Note that the tree Tvp\u03c9\u2039q is exactly Tvp\u03c9qzS\u2039 where S\u2039 are all descendants of e\u2039. If we let A \u201c Cvp\u03c9\u2039q, then evidently \u03c9pBeAze\u2039q \u201d 0 since \u03c9\u2039pBeAq \u201d 0. Also, |A| \u010f n{2 since otherwise e\u2039 would not belong to T 1v. All edges of e1 belong to Tvp\u03c9\u2039q so they are all incident to A; therefore\n\u2206|A| \u011b |e1| \u011b |CE\u20301v | \u011b \u2206`\u03b1 ,\nusing the fact that e1 \u0104 CE\u20301v . Lastly, A contains v P BR since v P Tvp\u03c9\u2039q. Thus, A violates G`.\nThe following lemma relates the vulnerability of a configuration to leaving G` by means of an edgeupdate at distance m from BR to the event G\u0304cm, allowing us to control the probability that far away updates (of which there are many in order-one continuous time) induce the dynamics to leave G`.\nLemma 4.5. For any m \u011b `, in order for an edge e R BR`m\u03b1 to be pivotal to \u03c9 P G`, i.e., for \u03c9\u2018 teu P Gc` while \u03c9 P G`, it must be that \u03c9 P G\u0304cm.\nProof. Suppose \u03c9 P G`, e P EpBR`m\u03b1q such that e R \u03c9 and \u03c9 Y teu P Gc` or e P \u03c9 and \u03c9zteu P Gc` . In the first case, the component in \u03c9 adjacent to e only grows, and thus it must be that that component had size at most ` in \u03c9, that component has boundary size more than ` in \u03c9Yteu, and intersects BR already in \u03c9 (since otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be able to intersect BR in \u03c9 Y teu). Since every set of diameter greater than `\u03b1 has |A| \u011b `\u03b1, this means e must be within distance `\u03b1 of BBR and thus be in BR``\u03b1 . In particular, no edge outside BR``\u03b1 that is not in \u03c9 can be pivotal.\nIn the second case, the removal of an edge e P \u03c9 outside BR`m\u03b1 causes a component A to become part of Gc` . Call A the set in \u03c9ze that violates Gc` . Then the edge e must be in BeA, meaning that the set A is a set of size at most n{2, intersecting BR and with one other edge e1 P BeA such that \u03c9pBeAzte, e1uq \u201d 0. Since the distance of e to BR is at least m\u03b1, it must be that |A| \u011b diampAq \u011b m\u03b1.\nWe now turn to the probabilistic estimates. The following lemma utilizes Definition 1.2 to bound the probability of Gc` (as well as of G\u0304cm) under the independent edge-percolation measure r\u03c0 \u201c \u03c0G,p\u0303,1.\nLemma 4.6. If G satisfies Definition 1.2 and has \u03b7-stretched exponential volume growth for \u03b7 \u0103 \u03b70p\u03b4q, for all p\u0303 sufficiently large,\nr\u03c0pr\u03c9 R G`q \u010f C|BR| expp\u00b4`q ,\nfor some Cpp\u0303, \u03b7, \u03b4q. Similarly,\nr\u03c0pr\u03c9 R G\u0304mq \u010f C|BR| expp\u00b4mq .\nProof. The lemma is almost a union bound together with Definition 1.2, the only distinction being that we allow one or two of the edges in BeA to be open. Fix a vertex v, and for every configuration r\u03c9 in G` by means of a set A containing v, such that r\u03c9pBeAzeq \u201d 0, let \u03c6epr\u03c9q \u201c \u03c9ze. Evidently,\nr\u03c0pr\u03c9q r\u03c0p\u03c6epr\u03c9qq \u010f p\u0303 1\u00b4 p\u0303 .\nFor every r\u03c9, the configuration \u03c6epr\u03c9q has a set A intersecting v such that `\u03b1 \u010f |A| \u010f n{2 and such that p\u03c6epr\u03c9qqpBeAq \u201d 0, the probability of which is governed by Definition 1.2. Furthermore, if this A has size exactly r, the set of all pre-images of a single r\u03c9 under the map \u03c6e is bounded by the set of all e such that dpv, eq \u010f r, which is at most er\u03b7 per the \u03b7-stretched exponential growth assumption. Putting this all together, we get\nr\u03c0pr\u03c9 R Gc` q \u010f \u00ff\nvPBR\nn{2 \u00ff\nr\u201c`\u03b1 r\u03c0pr\u03c9q \u010f p\u0303 1\u00b4 p\u0303 \u00ff vPBR\nn{2 \u00ff\nr\u201c`\u03b1 er \u03b7 e\u00b4r \u03b4{p1`\u03b4q . (4.2)\nAs long as \u03b7 is smaller than \u03b1 \u201c \u03b4{p1 ` \u03b4q, the above quantity is at most some constant (depending on \u03b7, \u03b4, p\u0303) times e\u00b4`.\nThe argument for G\u0304m is essentially identical, with the only differences being that in (4.2), the pre-factor p\u0303{p1 \u00b4 p\u0303q is squared, and the number of choices of two edges that could be closed contributes a factor of e2r \u03b7 instead of er \u03b7 .\nThe last lemma we need towards proving Proposition 4.2 is one for bounding the number of clock rings in BR`m\u03b1 . This follows from a standard Poisson tail bound together with a union bound.\nLemma 4.7. For a set A, let N rt,2tsA be the number of clock rings in A in the time interval rt, 2ts. We have\nP \u00b4 \u010f m\u011b1 tN rt,2tsBR`m\u03b1 \u011b 4t|BR`m\u03b1 |u \u00af \u010f expp\u00b4t|BR|q .\nProof. The number of clock rings in a set A in an interval of length t \u0105 0 is distributed as a Poisson with rate |A|t. Therefore,\nP ` N rt,2ts A \u011b 4t|A| \u02d8 \u010f expp\u00b42t|A|q .\nBy a union bound, we then get\nP \u00b4 \u010f\nm\ntN rt,2tsBR`m\u03b1 \u011b 4t|BR`m\u03b1 |u \u00af \u010f \u00ff\nm\ne\u00b42t|BR`m\u03b1 | .\nUsing that |BR`m\u03b1 | is at least |BR| `m\u03b1 by the fact that m only ranges until expanding the radius doesn\u2019t add any vertices, and using that t \u0105 0, this sums out to give Ce\u00b42t|BR|, whence we absorb the constant C by changing the 2 in the exponent.\nProof of Proposition 4.2. By Lemma 4.4 it suffices to bound the probability of \u01642t s\u201cttXs R G`u. Condition on the clock rings between times t and 2t, with Trt,2ts denoting the \u03c3-algebra that generates. Let\nErt,2ts :\u201c \u010d\nm\u011b`\nN rt,2ts BR`m\u03b1 \u010f 4t|BR`m\u03b1 | ( ,\nmeasurable with respect to Trt,2ts. Lemma 4.7 showed that PpEcrt,2tsq \u010f expp\u00b4t|BR|q. We can then write\nP \u00b4\n2t \u010f s\u201ct tXs R G`u \u00af \u010f max pei,siqiPErt,2ts P \u00b4 \u010f i tXsi R G`u | pei, siqi \u00af ` e\u00b4t|BR| ,\nwhere pei, siqi denotes the sequence of pairs of edges and corresponding clock rings between times t and 2t.

Our aim is to now combine the above ingredients to establish that after a burn-in period that keeps our configuration in the set E` per Proposition 4.2, the disagreement propagation bounds of Section 3 can be implemented to guarantee exponential relaxation to equilibrium as long as p is sufficiently close to 1 to kickstart the spacetime recursion.\nProposition 4.8.

If we make the choices\n` \u201c 2R2\u03b7 , and t \u201c `{2 \u201c R2\u03b7 .\nwe find that as long as \u03b7 \u0103 \u03b70p\u03b4q and t, `, R are sufficiently large (as a function of \u03b4, \u03b7, \u03b5), we maintain t \u010f \u03b5R{`2\u03b1 and we can absorb the pre-factors above to obtain the claimed (4.3). That recurrence will hold for all t \u011b T0pq, \u03b4, \u03b7q and as an upper bound, for all t \u010f plog nq2 since our arguments are all valid as long as R \u010f diampGq which for G of \u03b7-subexponential volume growth is for all R \u010f plog nq1{\u03b7, which translates to t \u010f plog nq2.\nIt remains to deduce the exponential decay on \u03c1ptq from (4.3); consider the function\n\u03c6ptq \u201c e ? t ` \u03c1ptq ` e\u00b4t{2 \u02d81{2 .\nThen by (4.3), and the fact that ? a` b \u010f ? a` ? b,\n\u03c6p2tq \u010f e ? 2 ? t ` e ? t\u03c1ptq2 ` e\u00b4t ` e\u00b4t \u02d81{2 \u010f ep ? 2`.5q ? t\u03c1ptq ` ? 2e ? 2te\u00b4t{2 .\nSince 2 \u011b ? 2 ` .5 and ? 2e ? 2t \u010f e2 ? t for all t \u011b 1, this is at most \u03c6ptq2. Therefore, for any t0 \u011b 1, we have\n\u03c6p2kt0q \u010f \u03c6pt0q2 k ,\nwhence if \u03c6pt0q \u0103 1{e, then for r \u201c 2k, we have \u03c6prt0q \u010f e\u00b4r. From there, we note that \u03c1prt0q \u010f e\u00b42r \u00b4 e\u00b4rt0{2. As long as t0 is at least 6, say, this is at most e\u00b4r, whence \u03c1ptq \u010f e\u00b4t{t0 for t \u201c 2kt0. The fact that \u03c1ptq is monotone decreasing in time implies the bound \u03c1ptq \u010f e\u00b4t{p2t0q for all t \u011b t0.\nThe last step is to show that \u03c6pt0q \u0103 1{e for some t0 larger than maxt6, T0pq,\u2206, \u03b4, \u03b7qu. Towards this purpose, notice that by the update rule (1.2),\n\u03c1psq \u010f p1\u00b4 p\u0302q ` PpPoispsq \u201c 0q \u201c p1\u00b4 p\u0302q ` e\u00b4s .\nThere exists s0 independent of everything else such that e ? sp2e\u00b4s` e\u00b4s{2q1{2 is less than 1{e for all s \u0105 s0 because e ? tp2e\u00b4t ` e\u00b4t{2q1{2 is at most 3e\u00b4t{4` ? t, say.

Then by Proposition 4.8, each term in the right-hand side is bounded by n\u00b44 for large enough n. Since there are at most \u2206n \u010f n2 many summands, the sum above is op1q, implying mixing in Oplog nq time. This gives Opn log nq mixing time for the discrete-time FK dynamics as described in the preliminaries.\nThe result for the SW dynamics follows from the comparison result of [Ull14].\n5. SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL MIXING ON TREES WITH r-WIRED BOUNDARY\nOur next goal in the paper is to establish Theorem 1.6 concerning FK dynamics on treelike expanders. Recursive mixing time arguments based on disagreement percolation, like those in the previous section, are known to fail on graphs with exponential volume growth. At the same time, localizing the dynamics can be difficult in treelike graphs because there is no weak spatial mixing when p is close to 1; see the discussion at the beginning of Section 5.1 for more details. In this section, we define a class of boundary conditions that are sufficiently \u201cwired\u201d to support a notion of weak spatial mixing with respect to the wired boundary conditions. This class of boundary conditions captures the boundary conditions induced by the FK dynamics configuration on a treelike ball centered at a vertex of an expander graph after a short burn-in.\nThis section focuses on general rooted trees Th \u201c pV pThq, EpThqq having depth h, minimum internal degree 3 and maximum degree \u2206. For any m \u010f h, Tm will denote the tree given by truncating Th at depth m. The boundary BTm is the set of vertices of Tm at depth m. For any vertex w P V pThq, we use Th,w to denote the sub-tree of Th rooted at w, with boundary BTh,w \u201c BTh X Th,w.\nDefinition 5.1. A boundary condition \u03be of Th is single-component if the boundary partition corresponding to \u03be has at most one non-singleton element; we call this its wired component.\nDefinition 5.2. A distribution P over boundary conditions \u03be on Th is r-wired if it is supported on singlecomponent boundary conditions, and the distribution of the wired component of \u03be stochastically dominates the distribution over random subsets A \u0102 BTh in which each vertex of BTh is included in A with probability r independently (the partial order being the natural one on vertex subsets).\nThe following shows that except with double-exponentially small probability, the random-cluster model on Th with r-wired boundary conditions satisfies weak spatial mixing with respect to the all-wired boundary condition (the TV-distance between the two decays exponentially in the distance from the boundary).\nLemma 5.3. Let P be r-wired and let \u03be \u201e P. Then, with P-probability 1\u00b4 e\u00b4cpp1.1qh , we have }\u03c0\u03beThp\u03c9pTh{2q P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u03c0 1 Thp\u03c9pTh{2q P \u00a8q}TV \u010f e \u00b4cph ,\nfor some cp \u201c cppq,\u2206q, which is positive as long as p \u0105 p0pq,\u2206q for a suitable p0pq,\u2206q P p0, 1q, and which goes to8 as p\u00d1 1. Remark 5.4. The double exponential concentration under P in Lemma 5.3 is not strictly needed for the results in this paper. A single-exponential concentration under P would suffice and would be easier to establish by averaging over \u03be \u201e P and then applying Markov\u2019s inequality. However, we include this stronger form since it provides insight into the good qualities of r-wired boundary conditions and could be used to get an improved mixing time bound for the FK dynamics on trees with r-wired boundary. Unfortunately, with our current methods in Section 6, this improvement would not translate into better bounds for the FK dynamics on treelike graphs, so we do not pursue them.\n5.1. Spatial mixing on trees with r-wired boundary conditions. Our first aim in this section is to establish Lemma 5.3. Spatial mixing in the traditional sense, where one takes a maximum over the boundary conditions on the tree, does not hold even when p is very close to 1. This can be seen by considering Th with wired vs. free boundary conditions, and noticing that the marginal of any edge in the tree with the free boundary condition is Berpp\u0302q, whereas the marginal of an edge in the wired tree gives at least constant probability to that edge being distributed as Berppq, and otherwise, as Berpp\u0302q, so the total-variation distance on that edge does not go to zero as h \u00d1 8. Our solution to this issue is to restrict attention to r-wired boundary conditions and establish that, at least among these boundary conditions, the random-cluster model exhibits spatial mixing on Th. Considering only such boundary conditions will suffice for us, since these are the boundary conditions that appear after a burn-in period of the FK dynamics on treelike expander graphs.\nThe mechanism for coupling random-cluster configurations with r-wired and wired boundary conditions is based on what we call wired separating sets. These will be a set of vertices that are all connected down to the wired component of \u03be in BTh and therefore wired together; as such, they separate the influence of the boundary condition of BTh from, say, BTh{2.\nDefinition 5.5. A separating set in Th is a set of vertices S \u0102 V pThqzV pTh{2q such that every path from BTh{2 to BTh must intersect S. A configuration \u03c9 \u0102 EpThq has a wired separating set if there exists a separating set S such that every vertex v P S is connected in \u03c9pTh,wq to a vertex u P BTh,w belonging to the wired component of \u03be. Let Sh,\u03be be the event that \u03c9 has a wired separating set in Th with boundary condition \u03be.\nThe following lemma shows how the event of having a wired separating set governs the probability of coupling random-cluster configurations to \u03c9 \u201e \u03c01Th in Th{2. Lemma 5.6. For any single-component boundary condition \u03be on Th,\n}\u03c0\u03beThp\u03c9pTh{2q P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u03c0 1 Thp\u03c9pTh{2q P \u00a8q}TV \u010f \u03c0 \u03be ThpS c h,\u03beq .\nProof. We construct a monotone coupling for \u03c0\u03beTh and \u03c0 1 Th such that if p\u03c9\u03be, \u03c91q is sampled from this coupling, then \u03c9\u03be \u201e \u03c0\u03beTh , \u03c91 \u201e \u03c0 1 Th and\nt\u03c9\u03be P Sh,\u03beu \u00f9\u00f1 t\u03c9\u03bepTh{2q \u201c \u03c91pTh{2qu.\nOur construction relies on revealing the values of p\u03c9\u03be, \u03c91q on an edge set R under a monotone coupling, where crucially, R will be designed to be the set of edges in the \u201clowest\u201d wired separating set (if one exists). We construct \u03c9\u03be and \u03c91 as follows (and refer to Figure 5.1 for a depiction):\n(1) Initialize P0 as the parents of BTh, and R0 \u201c H. (2) Starting with i \u201c 1, pick a vertex wi P Pi\u00b41, and sample the configurations p\u03c9\u03bepTh,wiq, \u03c91pTh,wiqq\nfrom the monotone coupling between the marginals\n\u03c0\u03beThp\u03c9\u03bepTh,wiq P \u00a8 | \u03c9\u03bepRi\u00b41qq , and \u03c0 1 Thp\u03c91pTh,wiq P \u00a8 | \u03c91pRi\u00b41qq .\n(3) Let Ri \u201c Ri\u00b41 Y EpTh,wiq and form \u03c9\u03bepRiq and \u03c91pRiq by adding the configurations \u03c9\u03bepTh,wiq and \u03c91pTh,wiq, respectively. (4) If wi is connected to the wired component of \u03be in \u03c9\u03bepTh,wiq, then let Pi \u201c Pi\u00b41zThpwiq; else, let Pi \u201c pPi\u00b41zThpwiqq Y tw1iu where w1i is the parent of wi. While i is such that Pi\u00b41 is non-empty, RizRi\u00b41 \u2030 H. This is because the edges from wi to its children will be in Ri but not in Ri\u00b41 (if they were in Ri\u00b41 then wi P Twj for some j \u0103 i and wi would have been removed from Pj). Therefore, the revealing process will terminate after a finite number of steps, and we can call R \u201c Rf if f is the first index for which Pf \u201c H.\nNow, consider the subset BTOPR of vertices of R whose parents are not in R. As long as the process terminates with RXEpTh{2q \u201c H, the vertices in BTOPR will be connected to the wired component of \u03be in \u03c9\u03bepTh,wq, and so they will form a wired separating set. Conversely, if there exists a wired separating set S in \u03c9\u03bepTh,wq, no parent of any vertex in S will ever be added to P , and therefore, the vertices from BTOP will form exactly the lowest wired separating set.\nUpon termination of the iterative procedure above, we can then sample \u03c9\u03bepThzRq \u201c \u03c91pThzRq, since both \u03c9\u03bepRq and \u03c91pRq induce wired boundary conditions on EpThqzR. Therefore, under this coupling, we always have \u03c9\u03bepThzRq \u201c \u03c91pThzRq. Since the process terminates at the lowest wired separating set of \u03c9\u03be, on the event \u03c9\u03be P Sh,\u03be, necessarily ThzR contains all of Th{2. As such, using P to denote the probability under the coupling we just designed,\n}\u03c0\u03beTh{2 \u00b4 \u03c0 1 Th{2}TV \u010f PpRX Th{2 \u2030 Hq \u010f Pp\u03c9\u03be P S c h,\u03beq \u201c \u03c0 \u03be ThpS c h,\u03beq ,\nas claimed.\n5.1.1. Good boundary conditions. Our aim is now to control the probability of Sch,\u03be under a random rwired boundary condition \u03be \u201e P. Recalling the definition of Sh,\u03be, notice that it is an increasing event in\nthe random-cluster configuration. Since the random-cluster measure with parameters p and q stochastically dominates independent percolation with parameter p\u0302 \u201c pqp1\u00b4pq`p configuration (i.e., the random-cluster measure with parameters q \u201c 1 and p\u0302), it will suffice for us to consider the probability of Sh,\u03be under the product measure r\u03c0Th \u201c \u03c0 \u03be Th,p\u0303,1 for some p\u0303 \u010f p\u0302 still going to 1 with p (e.g., p\u0303 \u201c 2p\u0302\u00b4 1).\nDefinition 5.7. A boundary condition \u03be on Th is called c-good if\nr\u03c0Thpr\u03c9 P S c h,\u03beq \u010f expp\u00b4chq .\nNotice that if \u03be is c-good, then any single-component boundary condition \u03be1 \u011b \u03be will also be c-good, since any r\u03c9 P Sh,\u03be will also be in Sh,\u03be1 . Therefore, the event t\u03be is c-goodu is itself increasing in the partial order on subsets of BTh. In particular, if P is r-wired, then\nPp\u03be is c-goodq \u011b PBerprqp\u03be is c-goodq\nwhere PBerprq is the distribution over boundary conditions on BTh where the wired component contains each vertex independently with probability r. Given this, the following lemma implies Lemma 5.3.\nLemma 5.8. Suppose \u03be \u201e PBerprq. There exists c \u201c cpp, q, rq going to8 as p, r \u00d1 1, such that\nPp\u03be is not c-goodq \u010f expp\u00b4cp1.1qhq .\nProof. For some \u03b3 \u201c \u03b3pp, q, rq \u0105 0 to be chosen later, going to 1 as p, r \u00d1 1, consider the event E\u03b3 that \u03be belongs to the set of boundary conditions on Th that satisfy the following property:\n(P1) for each downward path from BTh{2 to BTh: v0, v1, ..., vh{2, for each i \u201c 1, ..., h{4, if we draw a configuration r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q from r\u03c0TvizTvi`1 , the probability that the component of vi in r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q intersects the wired component of \u03be X BpTvizTvi`1q is at least \u03b3.\nWe first show that \u03be P E\u03b3 implies \u03be is c-good for a suitable c \u0105 0. Fix any \u03be P E\u03b3 . In order for Sch,\u03be to occur, there must exist a path from BTh{2 to BTh such that no vi is connected to \u03be through r\u03c9pTviq. For any fixed path, that probability is upper bounded by\nr\u03c0Th\n\u00b4 h{4 \u010d\ni\u201c1 tr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c Hu\n\u00af \u201c h{4 \u017a\ni\u201c1 r\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c Hq \u010f p1\u00b4 \u03b3q\nh{4 .\nHere we have abused notation slightly to identify \u03be with the subset of BTh that is its wired component. (The change from the intersection to the product comes from the fact that r\u03c0Th is a product measure and that the sets TvizTvi`1 are disjoint for different i.) A union bound over the \u2206h many paths implies that the probability that \u03c9 R Sh,\u03be is at most \u2206h{2p1\u00b4 \u03b3qh{4 which is at most expp\u00b4chq for some c \u0105 0 going to 8 as \u03b3 \u00d1 1, which happens as p, r \u00d1 1.\nIt now suffices to find such a \u03b3 \u0105 0, and a c\u0302 \u201c c\u0302pp, q, rq \u0105 0 such that\nPBerprq ` \u03be R E\u03b3 \u02d8 \u010f expp\u00b4c\u0302p1.1qhq . (5.1)\nFix a downward path v0, ..., vh{2 from BTh{2 to BTh and an i P t1, ..., h{4u (these will subsequently be union bounded over), and consider the probability that \u03be is such that (P1) above holds for that path and that i.\nDefine the event F i that the connected component of vi in r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q intersects BpTvizTvi`1q in at least p2p\u0303 \u00b4 \u03b5qhpviq\u00b41 many sites, where hpviq denotes the height of Tvi . Note that hpviq \u201c i \u00b4 h{2 \u011b h{4, and \u03b5 will be chosen later. For intuition, the component of vi in r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q is a branching process which (besides its first level) has 2p\u0303 expected number of children since we assumed that in Th all internal vertices have degree at least 3. By a standard branching process argument (see Fact 5.9 below from which this follows after asking that the first level have an open edge with probability at least p\u0303), we known there exists \u03b4 going to 0 as p\u0303\u00d1 1 (equivalently as p\u00d1 1) such that\nr\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q R F iq \u010f \u03b4 .\nBy the independence of r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q from \u03be, we have\nPBerprq b r\u03c0Th \u00b4 r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c H, r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q P F i \u00af \u010f p1\u00b4 rqp2p\u0303\u00b4\u03b5qhpviq\u00b41 .\nBy Markov\u2019s inequality and the fact that hpviq \u011b h{4,\nPBerprq\n\u00b4\n\u03be : r\u03c0Th ` r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c H, r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q P F i \u02d8\n\u0105 p1\u00b4 rqp2p\u0303\u00b4\u03b5qh{4{2 \u00af\n\u010f exppp2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5qh{4 logp1\u00b4 rq{2q .\nAt the same time, for any fixed \u03be,\nr\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c Hq \u010f r\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c H, r\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q P F iq\n` r\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q R F iq .\nIf the first of these terms is at most p1\u00b4 rqp2p\u0303\u00b4\u03b5pqh{4{2 and the second is at most \u03b4, we set \u03b3 \u201c 1\u00b4 \u03b4 \u00b4 p1\u00b4 rqp2p\u0303\u00b4\u03b5qh{4{2. Then, \u03b3 goes to 1 as p\u00d1 1 and by the above, r\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u2030 Hq \u011b \u03b3. Thus,\nPBerprq ` \u03be : r\u03c0Thpr\u03c9pTvizTvi`1q X \u03be \u201c Hq \u0105 1\u00b4 \u03b3 \u02d8 \u010f exppp2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5qh{4 logp1\u00b4 rq{2q .\nWe now upgrade this into the probability that \u03be is in E\u03b3 by a union bound over all \u2206h{2 many paths in Th and the h{4 many possible i\u2019s; both these terms are absorbed by the double exponential above. As long as \u03b5 is sufficiently small, and p is sufficiently large, p2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5q1{4 is greater than 1.1, and the prefactor evidently blows up as r \u00d1 1 as claimed.\nFor completeness, we have included the following simple branching process concentration estimate.\nFact 5.9. In a branching process with progeny distribution stochastically dominating Binp2, p\u0303q, let Zk be the population size at level k. Then for every \u03b5 \u0105 0, there exists \u03b4 \u0105 0 going to 0 as p\u00d1 1 such that\nP \u00b4 \u010d\nk\u011b1 tZk \u011b p2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5qku\n\u00af\n\u011b 1\u00b4 \u03b4 .\nProof. Since the event in question is an increasing event, it suffices to show the above for the branching process with progeny distribution exactly Binp2, p\u0303q. If we let Ak be the event tZk \u011b p2p\u0303 \u00b4 \u03b5qku, then we can write\nP \u00b4 \u010f\nk\u011b1 Ack\n\u00af\n\u010f PpAc1q ` \u00ff k\u011b2 P \u00b4 Ack, \u010d j\u0103k Aj \u00af \u010f PpAc1q ` \u00ff k\u011b2 P \u00b4 Ack | \u010d j\u0103k Aj \u00af .\nSince Z1 \u201c 1, the probability of A1 is 1. For any k \u011b 2, since Zk is Markov, it suffices to condition on Zk\u00b41 : Zk\u00b41 P Ak\u00b41; given Zk\u00b41, the distribution of Ak\u00b41 is\nZk\u00b41 \u00ff\ni\u201c1 Xi where Xi are i.i.d. Binp2, p\u0303q .\nThus, PpAck | Zk\u00b41,Ak\u00b41q is at most the probability of a sum of Zk\u00b41 \u011b p2p\u0303 \u00b4 \u03b5qk\u00b41 i.i.d. Binp2, p\u0303q random variables, being at least \u03b5Zk\u00b41 below its mean. By Hoeffding\u2019s inequality (the Xi\u2019s being bounded by 2), this has probability at most expp\u00b412\u03b5 2p2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5qk\u00b41q for every k. Let K equal log2p\u0303\u00b4\u03b5p2{p\u03b52 ?\n1\u00b4 p\u0303qq. For the first K generations, we can use the simpler union bound over the probability that one of the first p2p\u0303\u00b4 \u03b5qk many Xi\u2019s is not equal to 2. Putting these together, we get\nP \u00b4 \u010f\nk\u011b1 Ack\n\u00af \u010f 4 \u03b52 p1\u00b4 p\u0303q1{2 ` \u00ff k\u0105K e \u00b4 1? 1\u00b4p\u0303 pk\u00b4Kq .\nFor any fixed \u03b5, this is then seen to be at most some \u03b4 going to zero as p\u0303\u00d1 1, which happens as p\u00d1 1.\n5.2. Mixing time for trees with single-component boundary conditions. In this section, we provide a bound on the mixing time of the FK dynamics on trees with single-component boundary conditions. In view of its application in the following section for treelike balls of expanders (possibly having a finite number of cycles), it will be helpful for us to recall certain standard definitions that will allow us to relate the convergence rate of various Markov chains.\nFor a Markov chain on a finite state space \u2126 with transition matrix P and stationary distribution \u00b5, the Dirichlet form of the chain is defined for any function f : \u2126 \u00d1 R by\nEpf, fq :\u201c 1 2 \u00ff \u03c9,\u03c91P\u2126 \u00b5p\u03c9qP p\u03c9, \u03c91qpfp\u03c9q \u00b4 fp\u03c91qq2 , (5.2)\nand its spectral gap is given by\n\u03bbP :\u201c min f :Var\u00b5rf s\u20300 Epf, fq Var\u00b5rf s , (5.3)\nwhere Var\u00b5rf s \u201c E\u00b5rf2s \u00b4 E\u00b5rf s2 with E\u00b5rf s \u201c \u0159 \u03c9P\u2126 \u00b5p\u03c9qfp\u03c9q. The inverse of the spectral gap is closely connected to the mixing time of a Markov chain. In particular,\np\u03bb\u00b41P \u00b4 1q log ` 1 2\u03b5 \u02d8 \u010f tMIXp\u03b5q \u010f \u03bb\u00b41P log ` 1 \u03b5\u00b5min \u02d8 , (5.4)\nwhere \u00b5min \u201c min\u03c9P\u2126 \u00b5p\u03c9q. (We refer the reader to e.g., [LP17, Chapter 12.2] for more details.) We establish the following bounds for the mixing time and inverse spectral gap of the FK dynamics on a\ntree with any single-component boundary condition.\nLemma 5.10. Consider any tree Th of maximum degree \u2206 and depth h with single-component boundary condition \u03be. There exist constants a \u201c ap\u2206, qq \u0105 0 and C \u201c Cpp, qq \u0105 0 such that the inverse spectral gap of the FK dynamics on Th with boundary condition \u03be are at most C exppahq.\nProof. We use the classical bound on the spectral gap obtained from cut-width of a graph via the canonical paths method, though a little care is needed for the purpose of handling the random-cluster boundary condition. The edge-cut-width of Th (in other words, the cut-width of its line graph) is defined as follows: enumerate the edges of Th as 1, ..., |EpThq| and define\nCWpThq \u201c max i min \u03c3 |V pte\u03c3pjq : j \u010f iuq X V pte\u03c3pjq : j \u0105 iuq|\nwhere the max is over permutations \u03c3 on t1, ..., |EpThq|u. We claim that there exists a constant Kp\u2206q such that uniformly over all trees of degree at most \u2206, their edge-cut-width is at most Kh; this follows e.g., from [BKMP05, Proposition 1.2] and the fact that the edge-cut-width is within a factor of \u2206 of the (vertex) cut-width. Let \u03c3 be the permutation that attains this edge-cut-width bound for Th.\nFor any two random-cluster configurations I, F P \u2126 on Th, define the canonical path \u03b3I,F as the path of FK dynamics transitions which sequentially processes the edges ofEpThq according to the ordering induced by \u03c3, i.e., e\u03c3p1q, e\u03c3p2q, ..., e\u03c3p|EpThq|, and whenever there is a discrepancy Ipe\u03c3piqq \u2030 F pe\u03c3piqq, the transition is the one that changes the state of e\u03c3piq from Ipe\u03c3piqq to F pe\u03c3piqq.\nFor an FK dynamics transition p\u03b7, \u03b7iq where \u03b7i :\u201c \u03b7 \u2018 e\u03c3piq, construct a bijection from the set of tI, F : p\u03b7, \u03b7iq P \u03b3I,F u to \u2126 by setting\n\u03c9\u03b7pI, F q \u201c tIpe\u03c3pjqq : j \u010f iu Y tF pe\u03c3pjqq : j \u0105 iu .\nThis is a bijection because I is recovered via I \u201c t\u03c9\u03b7pe\u03c3pjqq : j \u010f iu Y t\u03b7pe\u03c3pjqq : j \u0105 iu and F is analogously recovered via F \u201c t\u03b7pe\u03c3pjqq : j \u010f iu Y t\u03c9\u03b7pe\u03c3pjqq : j \u0105 iu.\nFor ease of notation, let \u03c0 \u201c \u03c0\u03beTh . The standard canonical paths bound (see [LP17, Corollary 13.20]) then ensures the inverse gap satisfies\n\u03bb\u00b41P \u010f maxi max\u03b7 1 \u03c0p\u03b7qP p\u03b7, \u03b7iq \u00ff\nI,F :p\u03b7,\u03b7iqP\u03b3I,F\n\u03c0pIq\u03c0pF q|\u03b3I,F |\n\u010f |EpThq|max \u03b7,i max I,F :p\u03b7,\u03b7iqP\u03b3I,F\n1 P p\u03b7, \u03b7iq \u03c0pIq\u03c0pF q \u03c0p\u03b7q\u03c0p\u03c9\u03b7pI, F qq .\nThe probability P p\u03b7, \u03b7iq is at least the probability of picking the edge e\u03c3piq to update (1{|EpThq|) times the minimal probability of flipping an edge, which is some C \u201c Cpp, qq \u0105 0. The ratio of probabilities is bounded by noticing that the number of edges present in the multisets tI, F u and t\u03b7, \u03c9\u03b7pI, F qu are the same, leaving only the factor of q to contribute. Without the boundary conditions on Th, we claim that\n|kpIq ` kpF q \u00b4 kp\u03b7q \u00b4 kp\u03c9\u03b7pI, F qq| \u010f 2|V pe\u03c3pjq:j\u010fiq X V pe\u03c3pjq:j\u0105iq| , (5.5) where we recall that kp\u03c9q is the number of connected components in the subgraph pV pGq, \u03c9q (2.1). To see (5.5), note that the only component counts that can differ between kpIq` kpF q and kp\u03b7q` kp\u03c9\u03b7pI, F qq are from components that intersect the vertex boundary between te\u03c3pjq : j \u010f iu and te\u03c3pjq : j \u0105 iu.\nThe addition of the boundary conditions can only change the bound on the left-hand side of (5.5) additively by at most 2. This is because up to a change of the number of components by at most 1, we can split the boundary condition \u03be into two parts, one being its part that intersects vertices of te\u03c3pjq : j \u010f iu and one being its part that intersects vertices of te\u03c3pjq : j \u0105 iu. With this modification, the same reasoning as in the no boundary condition case holds, that the component counts only differ through components that hit the vertex boundary, and this number of components is evidently bounded above by the size of the vertex boundary. Altogether, we get that the spectral gap satisfies\n\u03bb\u00b41P \u010f C|EpThq| 2 exp ` 2pCWpThq ` 1q log q \u02d8 \u010f C\u2206he2Kh log q , which implies the claimed bound up to a change of constants."

            "heading": "6. MIXING TIME ON LOCALLY TREELIKE GRAPHS",
            "text": "We now use the understanding from Section 5 on the random-cluster model on trees with r-wired boundary conditions to control their mixing time on treelike graphs having exponentially strong supercritical phases for the edge-percolation: namely, to prove Theorem 1.6. As mentioned in the introduction, the prototypical example to have in mind in this section is a treelike expander like the random \u2206-regular graph.\nThe proof strategy of Theorem 1.6 consists of the following three steps, which will organize the section: (1) An Op1q burn-in period to obtain (nearly) r-wired boundary conditions on the locally treelike\nOplog nq-radius balls of the graph; (2) Censoring of the dynamics after burn-in to localize to a treelike ball (and an estimate on how long\nthe mixing time will be on the local ball with (nearly) r-wired boundary conditions); (3) A spatial mixing property with (nearly) r-wired boundary conditions to couple the two censored\ncopies after they have each respectively reached equilibrium.\n6.1. Burn-in to induce pr, Lq-wired boundary conditions on treelike balls. In this subsection, we demonstrate that FK dynamics after an Op1q burn-in period will be such that the boundary conditions it induces on \u03b72 log n sized balls are (almost) r-wired. This will be essential to application of the spatial mixing results of the previous section. Since the property of being r-wired is a monotone increasing property on the distribution over boundary conditions, it will essentially suffice to establish it for the Berpp\u0303q edge percolation r\u03c9, and use Lemma 4.1. (There are some added complications by the fact that there may be some Op1q many extra wirings, and the bound on those extra wirings is no longer an increasing event.)\nIn what follows, given a graph G, let Bh \u201c Bhpoq be the ball of radius h about a fixed vertex o and suppose it is K-treelike, meaning the removal of at most K edges from EpBhq leaves a tree. By taking the breadth-first exploration of Bh, any vertex w can be assigned a height via h \u00b4 dpw, oq and children which\nare all vertices adjacent to w having smaller height. Let the descendant graph of w, denoted Dw (in analogy with Th,w), be the set of all descendants of w, together with their descendants etc.\nDefinition 6.1. A distribution P over boundary conditions on a K-treelike ball Bh is called pr, Lq-wired if it is generated as follows:\n\u201a Some arbitrary L vertices in BBh are chosen and an arbitrary wiring is placed on them; \u201a On the remainder, a subset stochastically dominating the product Berppq subset is wired together\ninto one large component.\nThe main result of this subsection is that the boundary conditions induced on a treelike ball by the FK dynamics after an Op1q burn-in time are pp, Lq-wired. This will follow from the following.\nLemma 6.2. Suppose G has an exponentially strong supercritical phase per Definition 1.4, and for h \u201c \u03b7 log n, the graph G is pK,hq-treelike. For every r, there exists p\u0303p\u03b7, r, cp\u0303, p\u03030q such that if \u03c9 \u013e r\u03c9, then for every o P V pGq, the distrbituion over boundary conditions induced by \u03c9pEpGqzEpBh{2qq on BBh{2 is within TV-distance n\u00b45 of a pr,Kq-wired boundary condition.\nThe complications for establishing the above lemma are that the class of pr, Lq-wired boundary conditions are not a monotone family, and that the wirings of boundary vertices of Bh are dictated by events of connectivity to a giant which are not independent even under r\u03c9. We develop an auxiliary set of events on the random-cluster configuration which provide the necessary monotonicity and independence.\n\u201a Define E1 as the event that every component of \u03c9 of size at least \u03b72 log n coincides (i.e., \u03c9 has at most one component of size greater than \u03b72 log n). \u201a For vertices w P BBh{2 whose descendant graph Dw in Bh is a tree, let Ew be the event that the configuration \u03c9pDwq has size greater than \u03b72 log n. (For other w, let Ew be vacuous.)\nOn the event E1, the subset of w P BBh{2 such that Ew holds will all be wired together through the giant, and the set of additional wirings of boundary vertices must be confined to those w for which its descendant graph inBh has a cycle, which is deterministically at mostK sinceG is pK,hq-treelike. It therefore suffices for us to establish that for all p\u0303 sufficiently large, if \u03c9 \u013e r\u03c9,\nPp\u03c9 R E1q \u010f n\u00b45 and tw : \u03c9 P Ewu \u013e \u00e2\nw\nBerppq ,\nwhence on the event E1, the boundary conditions induced by \u03c9pEpGqzEpBh{2q on BBh{2 would be pr,Kqwired. In particular, Lemma 6.2 is an immediate consequence of the following two lemmas.\nLemma 6.3. Suppose G satisfies Definition 1.4 with some cp\u0303, p\u03030. For every \u03b7 \u0105 0, there exists p\u030310 such that if p\u0303 \u011b p\u030310, and \u03c9 \u013e r\u03c9, then\nPp\u03c9 R E1q \u010f n\u00b45 .\nProof. In order for \u03c9 R E1, there must exist a component of size between \u03b72 log\u2206 n and n{2 (two components both of size at least n{2 evidently coincide). Thus, by a union bound the probability of \u03c9 R E1 is bounded by the probability that there exists some A of size between \u03b72 log\u2206 n and n{2 with \u03c9pBeAq \u201d 0; this being a decreasing event, it suffices to upper bound its probability under r\u03c9, whence we can apply Definition 1.4 with ` \u201c \u03b72 log\u2206 n to get\nr\u03c0pr\u03c9 R E1q \u010f ne\u00b4cp\u0303\u03b7 logn .\nAs long as p\u0303 is larger than p\u03030 and sufficiently large as a function of cp\u0303 and \u03b7, this will be at most n\u00b45.\nLemma 6.4. Suppose G is pK,hq-treelike For every r \u0103 1, there exists p\u0303 such that if \u03c9 \u013e r\u03c9 then the distribution of tw : \u03c9 P Ewu stochastically dominates a Bernoulliprq subset of BBh{2.\nProof. Since the Ew are increasing events, tw : \u03c9 P Ewu stochastically dominates tw : r\u03c9 P Ewu, it suffices to establish the above for r\u03c9. Since the descendant graphs Dw are disjoint for the w P BBh{2 for which Ew is not vacuous, the events Ew are independent under r\u03c9. It remains to argue that Ppr\u03c9 P Ewq \u011b p as long as p\u0303\nis sufficiently large. Since the descendant graphs Dw contain full binary trees as subgraphs, the probability of r\u03c9 P Ew is larger than the probability that the branching process with offspring distribution Binp2, p\u0303q survives \u03b72 log n generations, which happens with probability going to 1 as p\u0303 \u00d1 1: see e.g., Fact 5.9. In particular, for every r, the probability of r\u03c9 P Ew is greater than r as long as p\u0303 is large enough (depending only on r).\n6.2. Spatial mixing on treelike balls with pr, Lq-wired boundary. We now describe how minor adjustments to Section 5.1 lead to spatial mixing on treelike graphs with boundary conditions that are pr, Lq-wired.\nLemma 6.5. Suppose Bh is K-treelike, and suppose P is pr, Lq-wired. Then except with P-probability e\u00b4crp1.1q h{p2Kq (with cr \u0105 0 for r large), \u03be is such that\n}\u03c0\u03beBhp\u03c9pBh{2q P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u03c0 1 Bh p\u03c9pBh{2q P \u00a8q}TV \u010f Ce\u00b4cpph{p2Kq\u00b4K\u00b4Lq .\nfor some constant cp going to8 as p\u00d1 1.\nProof. Since Bh is K-treelike, there is an edge-set H of size at most K such that BhzH is a tree. Following the breadth-first search of Bh, there is a a stretch of at least h{p2Kq consecutive levels between depth h{2 and h such that the restriction of Bh to those levels is a forest and every tree in that forest contains a full binary tree as a subgraph. There exists m \u011b h{2` h{p2Kq such that this forest is BmzBm\u00b4h{p2Kq.\nLet S\u0303h,\u03be be the event that there is a wired separating surface in every of the constituent trees of height h{p2Kq in the configuration \u03c9pBhzHq. (Notice that since the boundary conditions are at depth h, this depends on the full configuration, not just the restriction to the stretch of h{p2Kq heights; moreover by definition of wired separating surface, if \u03c9pBhzHq has a wired separating surface then so does \u03c9pBhq.)\nThe first claim is that under this definition, there is a minor modification of the revealing procedure of Lemma 5.6 such that the probability of \u03c9\u03be P S\u0303ch,\u03be upper bounds the total-variation distance. This is done by first revealing the entire configurations \u03c9\u03be and \u03c91 on pBhzHqzBm`h{p2Kq under the monotone coupling. In this manner, the revealed part of \u03c9\u03be induces some single-component boundary conditions \u03be\u0303 on Bm`h{p2Kq. We can then apply Lemma 5.6 to each of the constituent trees of BmzBm\u00b4h{p2Kq and it follows that on the event that they all have wired separating surfaces in \u03c9\u03be, then \u03c9\u03be is coupled to \u03c91 above those wired separating surfaces and in particular on all of Bm. As such, we have the analogous\n}\u03c0\u03beBhp\u03c9pBh{2q P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u03c0 1 Bh p\u03c9pBh{2q P \u00a8q}TV \u010f \u03c0B\u03behp\u03c9pBhzHq P S\u0303 c h,\u03beq .\nTo control the probability of S\u0303ch,\u03be, we follow the reasoning of Lemma 5.8, with the modifications being minimal. The only difference that arises is that when considering the probability of the event in item (2) in that proof, the sub-tree from a vertex vi P Bm`h{p2KqzBm in BhzH no longer necessarily contains a full binary tree: for up to K many vertices, it could be the pruning of a binary tree with up to K many subtrees of depth at least h{2K deleted from it. The easiest thing to do is to simply disregard these vertices which leads to a change from h to h\u00b4K in the concentration quality. Similarly, at most L of the subtrees contain at their boundary one of the L vertices where the pr, Lq boundary conditions are arbitrarily rewired, and we can disregard these L vertices as well. Nothing else will be affected in the proof.\n6.3. Local mixing time on treelike balls with pr, Lq-wired boundary. We now show that the \u03b7 log nradius balls in the treelike expander, with the boundary conditions induced on them by the remainder of the FK dynamics configuration, have a polynomial mixing time. By Lemma 6.2, after a burn-in, these will look like treelike balls with boundary conditions that have an Op1q number of distinct components, one of them being macroscopic, and the rest all being Op1q sized. At this point we can appeal to a comparison estimates for Markov chains together with the bound on the inverse spectral gap on trees with single-component mixing times from Lemma 5.10.\nRemark 6.6. We do not use any further information on the boundary conditions (like the r-wired property or the randomness), only the fact that there is at most 1 large component andOp1qmany vertices in the union of all other components. In theory, it is likely that we could use the r-wired property to get a significantly\nbetter bound on the mixing time of a tree. However, the extra Op1q wirings and the Op1q many non-tree edges force us to at some point perform a comparison through a spectral gap, and getting back a mixing time bound from this will anyways end up costing a factor of the volume per (5.4).\nTo perform comparisons, we formalize a notion of distance between boundary conditions. Two \u201csimilar\u201d random-cluster boundary conditions (in terms of the wiring they induce) have similar effects on the underlying random-cluster distribution and on the behavior of the corresponding FK dynamics. In turn, the Dirichlet form, and spectral gaps of their corresponding dynamics should be \u201cclose\u201d to one another. We compile a few definitions and results that formalize this idea.\nDefinition 6.7. For two boundary conditions \u03c6 \u010f \u03c61, define Dp\u03c6, \u03c61q :\u201c kp\u03c6q \u00b4 kp\u03c61q where kp\u03c6q is the number of components in \u03c6. For two partitions \u03c6, \u03c61 that are not comparable, let \u03c62 be the smallest partition such that \u03c62 \u011b \u03c6 and \u03c62 \u011b \u03c61 and set Dp\u03c6, \u03c61q \u201c kp\u03c6q \u00b4 kp\u03c62q ` kp\u03c61q \u00b4 kp\u03c62q.\nThe following lemma is then straightforward from the definition of the random-cluster measure (2.1).\nLemma 6.8 (E.g., Lemma 2.2 from [BGV20]). Let G be arbitrary, p P p0, 1q and q \u0105 0. Let \u03c6 and \u03c61 be any two partitions of V pGq. Then, for all random-cluster configurations \u03c9 P t0, 1uE , we have\nq\u00b42Dp\u03c6,\u03c6 1q\u03c0\u03c6 1\nG p\u03c9q \u010f \u03c0 \u03c6 Gp\u03c9q \u010f q\n2Dp\u03c6,\u03c61q\u03c0\u03c6 1\nG p\u03c9q .\nThe following corollary is a standard comparison of spectral gaps, and follows from Lemma 6.8, the definition of the transition matrix of the FK dynamics, and Theorem 4.1.1 in [SC97].\nCorollary 6.9. Let G \u201c pV,Eq be an arbitrary graph, p P p0, 1q and q \u0105 0. Consider the FK dynamics on G with boundary conditions \u03c6 and \u03c61, and let \u03bb, \u03bb1 denote their respective spectral gaps. Then,\nq\u00b45Dp\u03c6,\u03c6 1q\u03bb1 \u010f \u03bb \u010f q5Dp\u03c6,\u03c61q\u03bb1 .\nUsing the above, we are able to deduce the following bound.\nLemma 6.10. Consider a K-treelike ball Bh with boundary conditions \u03be that have one component of arbitrary size together with at most L many additional boundary wirings. There exists ap\u2206, qq such that the inverse spectral gap on B\u03beh is at most Cp,q exppaph`K ` Lqq.\nProof. Consider the modification of B\u03beh where all endpoints of the set H are wired up to one another via a boundary condition, and denote it by rB\u03beh. By Corollary 6.9, their spectral gaps are within a factor of q\n10|H| of one another. The FK dynamics on rB\u03beh are a product of the FK dynamics on BhzH with boundary conditions \u03be and the wirings of the edges ofH (call this p\u010cBhzHq\u03be), and |H| independent FK dynamics chains on single edges with wired boundary. By tensorization of the spectral gap (see e.g., [SC97]) the spectral gap of the FK dynamics on Bh is then the minimum of the gap on those individual edges, and the gap of the FK dynamics on p\u010cBhzHq\u03be.\nThe spectral gaps of the individual edges are clearly some constant depending on p, so it suffices to bound the spectral gap of FK dynamics on p\u010cBhzHq\u03be. For this purpose, notice that with a cost of q5p|H|`Lq we can perform a further boundary modification and remove the wirings of the edges in H as well as those L additional wirings in \u03be to end up with the treeBhzH with a single-component boundary condition. At this point, we can bound the spectral gap of this resulting single-component tree of depth h using Lemma 5.10. Putting together the costs from the various comparisons we obtain the desired.\n6.4. Mixing times on locally treelike graphs. In this section, we combine the above parts to establish the near-linear mixing time bound of Theorem 1.6 for FK dynamics on locally treelike graphs, as long as they have an exponentially strong supercritical phase for edge-percolation.\nProof of Theorem 1.6. Recall that we use X\u03c90t to denote the FK dynamics at time t from initialization \u03c90. By monotonicity, under the grand coupling, we have\nmax \u03c9,\u03c91\nPpX\u03c9t \u2030 X\u03c9 1 t q \u010f \u00ff\nePEpGq PpX\u03c9t peq \u2030 X\u03c9\n1 t peqq\n\u010f \u00ff\nePEpGq PpX0t peq \u2030 X1t peqq \u201c\n\u00ff\nePEpGq ErX1t peqs \u00b4 ErX0t peqs . (6.1)\nFix an edge e P EpGq and consider the difference in expectations on the right. Set X\u03040t to be the censored FK dynamics that agrees with X0t for all times until some T0 but that then censors (ignores) all updates after time T0 outside of Bh \u201c Bhpoq for some o P e and for h \u201c \u03b72 log n. Let X\u0304 1 t be the Markov chain that censors all updates of X1t outside of Bh (regardless of t). Then, by the censoring inequality of [PW13],\nErX1t peqs \u00b4 ErX0t peqs \u010f ErX\u03041t peqs \u00b4 ErX\u03040t peqs . (6.2)\nBy Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 6.2, for every r, there exist T0pr, qq and p0 large enough that for all p \u011b p0, the FK dynamics X0T0 , X 1 T0\ninduce pr,Kq-wired boundary conditions on BBh{2. LetA\u03b3 \u201c A\u03b3pBhq be set of boundary conditions \u03be onBh that are single-component together with at most K additional wirings, and furthermore that are such that the inequality of Lemma 6.5 holds with constant cp \u201c \u03b3. Since X0T0 , X 1 T0 induce pr,Kq-wired boundary conditions on BBh{2, by Lemma 6.5,\nPpX0T0pB c h{2q R A c \u03b3q \u010f e\u00b4crp1.1q h{2K .

We have used here the definition of the censored dynamics and monotonicity. The first term is at most e\u00b4crp1.1q h{2K by (6.3).\nFor the second term, fix any \u03be P A\u03b3pBhq, let Ys \u201c Y 1s,B1h and Zs \u201c Z 0 s,B\u03beh , and write\nErYSpeqs \u00b4 ErZSpeqs \u201c ` ErY 1S peqs \u00b4 \u03c0B1hp\u03c9eq \u02d8 ` ` \u03c0B1h p\u03c9eq \u00b4 \u03c0B\u03behp\u03c9eq \u02d8 ` ` \u03c0 B\u03beh p\u03c9eq \u00b4 ErZ0Speqs \u02d8 .\nThe middle term is at most Ce\u00b4\u03b3h{p3Kq by (6.4). For the first and third, suppose\nS \u011b C0 log n \u00a8 max \u03bePA\u03b3pBhq\nlog \u00b4 1\nmin\u03c9 \u03c0 \u03be Bh p\u03c9q\n\u00af\n\u00a8 \u03bb\u00b41 B\u03beh ,\nwhere \u03bb\u00b41 B\u03beh is the inverse spectral gap of the FK dynamics on Bh with boundary conditions \u03be. Then by (5.4) and sub-multiplicativity of TV-distance to stationarity, for a universal constant C0, both the first and third terms will be at most n\u00b45. Combining, we get\nErX\u03041T0`Speqs \u00b4 ErX\u0304 0 T0`Speqs \u010f Cpe\n\u00b4crp1.1qh{p2Kq ` e\u00b4\u03b3h{p3Kq ` n\u00b45q .

Furthermore, by taking r large, we can make \u03b3 and cr arbitrarily large, to satisfy items (3)\u2013(4). Finally, Lemma 6.2 ensures we can take T0, p0 large enough that for all p \u011b p0, item (5) is satisfied.\nWith these choices, for n sufficiently large, the right-hand side of (6.5) is at most n\u00b44. Combining these with (6.1)\u2013(6.2), we get that there exists p0pcp\u0303, p\u03030,\u2206, \u03b7, q,Kq such that for all p \u011b p0,\nmax \u03c9 }PpX\u03c9T0`S P \u00a8q \u00b4 \u03c0}TV \u010f max\u03c9,\u03c91 PpX \u03c9 T0`S \u2030 X \u03c91 T0`Sq \u201c op1q ,\nwhich concludes the proof since evidently T0 ` S \u201c Opn\u03b5{2 log nq \u201c Opn\u03b5q."

            "text": "In this section, we establish the following slow mixing result for the FK dynamics. Theorem 1.8 is the special case where we have restricted to integer q and used the comparison results of [Ull14].\nTheorem 7.1. Fix \u2206 \u011b 3 and p0 \u0103 1. (1) For any q \u011b 3, there exists p \u0105 p0 and a sequence of locally treelike graphs pGnqn of maximum\ndegree \u2206 such that the FK dynamics on Gn have tMIX \u011b expp\u2126pnqq. (2) For any q \u0105 4 (possibly non-integer), there exists p \u0105 p0 and a sequence pGnqn of polynomial\nvolume growth and maximum degree \u2206 such that the FK dynamics ofGn have tMIX \u011b expp\u2126p ? nqq.\nThe key tool for this proof will be the so called \u201cseries law\u201d for the random-cluster model. That is, splitting any edge e into two edges, and changing the edge probability parameter for e from pe to approximately? pe for each of the two new resulting edges, preserves the random-cluster measure when one reidentifies the edges and takes the status of e as being open if the two new edges are open. This gives a mechanism for boosting any fixed p into a p1 which gets closer and closer to 1, while only increasing the number of edges and vertices in the graph by a constant factor. In this manner, if a graph H has slow mixing for its FK dynamics at some value of p (no matter how small), then its modification G (obtained by multiple applications of the series law) can be made to have slow mixing at p1, for p1 that can be arbitrarily close to 1. Moreover, the graph modifications do not distort the maximum degree and volume growth (though they importantly do distort the isoperimetric dimension, and expansion rates, which we recall were fundamental to presence of a strongly supercritical phase for the edge-percolation on the graph).\nRemark 7.2. Both items (1)\u2013(2) of Theorem 7.1 should hold for all q \u0105 2. The gap for q non-integer in item (1) and q P p2, 4s in item (2) come from the present lack of proof (to our knowledge) of a slowdown for FK dynamics on bounded degree graphs (satisfying the corresponding graph condition) at those values of q. Such a slowdown is widely expected at the critical points both for the random regular graph and on pZ{mZqd for large d. The values of q for which we can establish our lower bound come from the slowdowns of the random regular graph at integer q \u011b 3 [COGG`23], and the torus pZ{ ? nZq2 at q \u0105 4 [GL18].\nLet us precisely recall the series law of the random-cluster model from [Gri04, Theorem 3.89].\nLemma 7.3. Two edges e, f of a graph G \u201c pV,Eq are in series if e \u201c tu, vu and f \u201c tv, wu and v has no other incident edges. Let\n\u03c3px, y, qq \u201c xy 1` pq \u00b4 1qp1\u00b4 xqp1\u00b4 yq .

For item (1), let pHnqn be a locally treelike sequence of n-vertex graphs of degree at most \u2206 such that the mixing time of FK dynamics at some fixed value of p P p0, 1q is expp\u2126pnqq. From the results in [COGG`23], we know that a randomly drawn sequence of \u2206-regular graphs satisfies this bound with high probability if q \u011b 3 is integer and p \u201c pcpq,\u2206q. For item (2), let pHnqn be the torii pZ{ ? nZq2\nsatisfies that at fixed p \u201c pcpqq P p0, 1q the mixing time of FK dynamics on Hn is expp\u2126p ? nqq for all real q \u0105 4. Let Gn be the modification of Hn in which every edge of Hn is split into 2K edges in series, for K determined as follows. Let \u03b6qppq be the inverse of \u03c3px, x, qq from (7.1), i.e.,\n\u03c3p\u03b6qppq, \u03b6qppq, qq \u201c p.\nSuch an inverse exists and is increasing for p P p0, 1q by virtue of the fact that \u03c3px, x, qq is continuously increasing from 0 to 1 as x ranges from r0, 1s. Since x2{q \u010f \u03c3px, x, qq \u010f x2 it must be the case that \u03b6qppq2{q \u010f \u03c3p\u03b6qppq, \u03b6qppq, qq \u010f \u03b6qppq2. In order for this to be equal to p, it must be that ? p \u010f \u03b6qppq \u010f ? pq.\nTake K such that \u03b6\u02ddKq ppq :\u201c \u03b6qp \u03b6qp \u00a8 \u00a8 \u00a8 \u03b6q\nK\nppq \u00a8 \u00a8 \u00a8 qq \u011b p0 .\nThe inequality ? p \u010f \u03b6qppq ensures that for any\nK \u011b log2 \u00b4 log p\nlog p0\n\u00af\n,\nwe have \u03b6\u02ddKq ppq \u011b p0. By Lemma 7.3, if \u03c91 is a random-cluster configuration on Gn with parameters p1 \u201c \u03b6\u02ddKq ppq and q, and \u03c9e \u201c \u015b ei \u03c91ei for every edge e P EpHnq, where peiq 2K i\u201c1 are the edges in Gn derived from splitting e, then \u03c9 is a sampled from the random-cluster measure on Hn with parameters p and q. We now claim that the FK dynamics on Gn with parameters p1 and q have expp\u2126pnqq mixing if Hn has\nexpp\u2126pnqqmixing at parameters pp, qq (the reasoning that it has expp\u2126p ? nqqmixing ifHn has expp\u2126p ? nq mixing is identical, so we omit it). This is achieved by lifting a bottleneck set from Hn to Gn. In what follows, it is convenient to work with the discrete-time Glauber dynamics (though the same proof would work in the continuous-time setting as well). Let PH denote the transition matrix of the discrete-time FK dynamics on Hn at parameter p and PG the transition matrix of the discrete-time FK dynamics on Gn at parameter p1. Similarly, \u03c0Hn is at parameter p while \u03c0Gn is at parameter p\n1. By assumption, the mixing time of FK dynamics onHn is exponential in n. As such, there exists a subset of configurations A \u0102 t0, 1uEpHnq of exponentially small conductance. More precisely, there must exist A \u0102 t0, 1uEpHnq such that \u03c0HnpAq \u010f 1{2 and\n\u03a6HpAq :\u201c \u0159 xPA,yPAc \u03c0HnpxqPHpx, yq \u03c0HnpAq \u201c expp\u00b4\u2126pnqq ; (7.2)\nsee, e.g., [LP17, Theorem 13.10]. Let BPHA \u201c tx P A : PHpx, yq \u0105 0 for some y P Acu. Since for each x P BPHA, each entry of PHn is at least 1n p\u0302, we see that there exists a constant c \u0105 0 such that\n\u03c0HnpBPHAq \u03c0HnpAq \u201c\n\u0159\nxPBPHA \u03c0Hnpxq\n\u03c0HnpAq \u010f np\u0302\u00b41\u03a6HpAq \u010f expp\u00b4cnq .

By Lemma 7.3, \u03c0GnpTAq \u201c \u03c0HnpAq. Every configuration in BTA must be in TBA because if PGp\u03c91, \u03c31q \u0105 0, for \u03c31 R TA, then \u03c31 projects down to a configuration in Ac,\nso \u03c91 must project into BA. Therefore, by Lemma 7.3, \u03c0GnpBPGTAq \u010f \u03c0HnpBPHAq. Altogether, it follows from (7.3) that\n\u03c0GnpBPGTAq \u03c0GnpTAq \u010f expp\u00b4cnq .\nUsing the facts that for every x, the number of y P TAc for which PGpx, yq is positive is at most EpGnq, \u0159\nxPTA,yPT cA \u03c0GnpxqPGpx, yq\n\u03c0GnpTAq \u010f |EpGnq| \u03c0GnpBPGTAq \u03c0GnpTAq ,\nimplies that TA is a set of exponentially small conductance for the FK dynamics on Gn. This then implies the inverse gap and mixing time of FK dynamics on Gn are both exponential in n.\nIt remains to reason that the number of vertices and edges of Gn are of the same order as the number of vertices and edges of Hn, so that the resulting bounds are indeed exponential in |V pGnq|. Notice that as long as p \u201c \u2126p1q and 1 \u00b4 p0 \u201c \u2126p1q, then K \u201c Op1q. As such, Gn will have |V pGnq| \u010f |V pHnq| ` 2K |EpHnq| \u201c Op|V pHnq|q, and |EpGhq| \u010f 2K |EpHnq|. This yields the claimed bound.\nAcknowledgements.
