Impact of Policy Reforms on Urbanization Balance: A detailed comparative study could investigate how specific policy reforms, particularly those targeting the dual household registration system, dual land system, and the tax distribution system, affect the balance between population urbanization and land urbanization. This research could utilize case studies of regions that have implemented reforms to see if and how these changes have led to improved urbanization balance.

Urbanization Dynamics in Mega Cities vs. Smaller Cities: Focusing on the disparities in urbanization processes between mega-cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, and smaller cities or towns. This study could explore how the challenges and opportunities in managing population and land urbanization differ by city size and suggest tailored strategies for different urban settings.

Socio-economic Impacts of Urbanization Imbalance: Investigating the socio-economic impacts of the observed urbanization imbalance, such as on housing affordability, social inequality, and access to public services. This research could help identify which aspects of the urbanization process need more urgent attention to improve living conditions and social equity.

Sustainable Urbanization Practices: Exploring sustainable urbanization practices that could help balance the development of land and population urbanization. This study could look into international case studies of successful urbanization strategies that minimize environmental impact, maximize efficient land use, and ensure inclusive growth. The findings could offer valuable lessons for China and other countries experiencing rapid urbanization.

Technology's Role in Harmonizing Urbanization: Assessing how advancements in technology, such as smart city initiatives, can facilitate more balanced urbanization by improving land use efficiency, enhancing public service delivery, and enabling better integration of migrant populations. This research could examine existing technologies and propose innovative solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by various regions in China.
