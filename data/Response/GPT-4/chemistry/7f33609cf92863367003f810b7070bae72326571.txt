Investigation of the Enzymatic Pathways for cis-Lutein Formation in Plants: Given the presence of cis-isomers of lutein in the studied flowers, it would be interesting to explore the enzymatic pathways responsible for the formation of these isomers. This research could provide insights into how plants regulate the presence of these isomers, which might have implications for their stress response mechanisms or adaptation strategies.

Bioavailability and Health Impact of Different Lutein Isomers in Human Diets: Although the paper mentions that cis-isomers of lutein might have higher bioavailability and antioxidant activities than the all-E isomers, comprehensive studies on the bioavailability, metabolism, and health effects of these isomers in humans are lacking. Future research could involve clinical trials to investigate these aspects, which could have significant implications for dietary recommendations and functional food development.

Genetic Engineering of Crops for Enhanced Lutein Content: Considering the importance of lutein in preventing age-related macular degeneration and other diseases, there could be a focus on genetically engineering crops to enhance their lutein content, especially focusing on the more bioavailable cis-isomers. This research could involve identifying and manipulating the genes responsible for lutein synthesis and isomerization in plants.

Exploring the Use of Lutein Isomers as Natural Dyes and Antioxidants in the Food Industry: Given the natural pigmentation properties of lutein and its isomers, there is potential for their use as natural dyes in the food industry. Additionally, their antioxidant properties could be beneficial for extending the shelf life of food products. Research could focus on the extraction, stability, and application of these compounds in various food matrices.

Environmental and Agronomic Factors Affecting Carotenoid Profiles in Plants: The paper highlights the variation in carotenoid composition among different plant species and even within the same species collected from different locations. Future studies could aim to understand how environmental and agronomic factors (such as light exposure, temperature, soil nutrients, and water availability) influence the synthesis and isomerization of carotenoids in plants. This research could lead to optimized cultivation practices for maximizing the nutritional value of crops.
