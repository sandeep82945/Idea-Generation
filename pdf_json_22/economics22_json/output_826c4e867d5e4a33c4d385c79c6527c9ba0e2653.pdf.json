The ecological restoration and civilization construction is one of the key tasks in China. The economic development of different regions has different effects on the resource protection and utilization. In the face of complex natural conditions and resource-rich areas, how to carry out the ecological environment promotion work is put forward. The urbanization level of the Yangtze River region increases from 17.9% to 60.6%, showing the characteristics of rapid expansion. In the face of urban diseases such as unreasonable industrial layout, it is urgent to improve regional economy and promote green urban development from the perspective of big data. Adhering to the concept of ecological priority, the development of digital technology drove the development of local economy in 2019, accounting for 43% of the national population. While promoting the economic development, it is of great significance to ensure the efficiency of resource utilization and promote the high-quality development of common economy."

            "text": "Urban green transformation is to develop within the carrying capacity of economy, society and environment, realize green production mode, green lifestyle, and inclusive social environment, and promote the city to take the road of intensive, intelligent, and beautiful ecology. It can be seen that the concept of \u201cgreen transformation\u201d has a strong consistency with the goal of \u201cproduction-living-ecological\u201d space optimization in connotation, that is, to promote intensive and efficient production space, livable, and moderate living space, and beautiful ecological space. As an advanced form of economic and social development, digital economy strengthens the integration of urban development and industrial development from the perspective of big data, plays an important role in industrial transformation and upgrading, social governance, and other fields. And it gradually becomes a new driving force leading the green transformation and development of cities. It is of great significance to further exert the development of digital economy to lead the green transformation of cities and boost the high-quality development of\ncities. Urban agglomeration is the highest form of spatial organization in the mature stage of urban development. It refers to a specific region with at least one megalopolis as its core and at least three large cities as its units. Relying on the developed infrastructure network such as transportation and communication, it forms a city group with compact spatial organization and close economic connection, and finally realizes the high degree of integration. Urban agglomeration is a large, multicore and multilevel city group formed by a number of geographically concentrated megacities and big cities, which is the union of metropolitan areas. At present, there are six world-class urban agglomerations universally recognized around the world: the Atlantic coastal urban agglomerations in the northeast of the United States, the Great Lakes urban agglomerations in North America, the Pacific coastal urban agglomerations in Japan, the British urban agglomerations in the northwest of Europe, and the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations. Urban agglomeration will be the most dynamic and potential strategic support and growth pole in China\u2019s future economic development pattern and dominate the lifeblood of national\nHindawi Journal of Environmental and Public Health Volume 2022, Article ID 9461377, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9461377\nRE\nTR AC\nTE\nD\neconomic development. As a link of regional economic and social connection, transportation is a necessary guarantee for the formation and development of urban agglomerations. Meanwhile, the layout of transportation facilities will also affect the spatial structure and evolution mode of urban agglomerations. Since the reform and opening up, China\u2019s urban agglomeration and regional transport system has been constantly mature, the quality of transport facilities and transport mileage has been constantly improved. At present, all urban agglomerations in China have formed relatively perfect high-speed transportation systems, which play an important driving role in the spatial conduction and effective allocation of inter-city production factor flow and the optimization and reorganization of urban agglomerations spatial structure, as shown in Figure 1.\nTransportation integration is an important support and guarantee for the implementation of regional coordinated development strategy and national development strategy of Yangtze River Delta regional integration. In particular, high-speed transportation system can produce many linkage development effects and is an important driving force for shaping urban gateway effect and efficient utilization of resources. On September 19, 2019, the Outline of Building China into a Transport Country issued by the CPC Central Committee and The State Council clarified the development goal of \u201cbasically building China into a transport country by 2035 and comprehensively building China into a transport country that is satisfactory to the people and at the forefront of the world by the middle of the 21st century\u201d. At the end of 2019, the Outline of the Plan for regional Integrated Development of the Yangtze River Delta defined the transportation tasks of \u201cjointly building the Yangtze River Delta on the track\u201d. Although the construction of high-speed transportation system in the Yangtze River Delta region has a good foundation for development, it still faces some bottleneck problems, such as unbalanced development of high-speed transportation system, uncoordinated high-speed transportation subsystem and the overall competitiveness of transportation to be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to put the construction of high-speed transportation into the overall regional integration development of the Yangtze River Delta, and fully realize the role of high-speed transportation in the implementation of the integration strategy of the Yangtze River Delta, as shown in Figure 2.\nIn recent years, China\u2019s international and domestic tourism income has achieved fruitful results. The tourism performance and tourism market are well-developed. However, with the advent of the era of mass tourism, some quality shortcomings in the development of China\u2019s tourism industry are gradually exposed. For example, the insufficient tourism products effective supply cannot adapt to the people\u2019s growing travel demand. The imbalance of urban and rural tourism development cannot adapt to the global tourism development. The insufficient novelty of tourism product forms cannot adapt to individuation and diversification of tourism consumption demand. The tourism theory research cannot adapt to the rapid development of tourism industry practice. The huge tourism economies are not coordinated\nwith the low operational efficiency of tourism industry. With the fragmentation of the tourism market of consumer demand and multiple overlays is forming, if China\u2019s tourism industry cannot improve, transform, and innovate in terms of supply side, demand side, and industrial operation efficiency in a timely manner, it may be difficult to jump out of the \u201cprimary stage of mass tourism trap\u201d. If it follows the trend of great changes unseen in the world and highquality economic development, the tourism industry will enter a new blue ocean, as shown in Figure 3.\n2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018\n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\nPe rc\nen ta\nge\nO pe\nra tin\ng m\nile ag\ne, pa\nss en\nge r t\nra ffi\nc\nYear\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nOperating mileage (km) Passenger traffic (10,000 people) Proportion of railway operating mileage (%) Proportion of railway passenger traffic (%)\nFigure 1: Basic situation of China\u2019s high-speed railway development.\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\nH ig\nhw ay\nm ile\nag e,\nsc he\ndu le\nd fli\ngh t r\nou te\nm ile\nag e\nYear\nR2 = 0.9863\ny = 1.0554x2 + 18.857x\ny = 0.0752x2 + 6.334x\nR2 = 0.8757\nRegular flight route mileage (10,000 kilometers) Highway mileage (thousand kilometers) Polynomial (scheduled flight route mileage (10,000 km)) Polynomial (highway mileage (thousand km))\nFigure 2: Basic situation of China\u2019s expressway mileage and civil aviation route mileage.\nRE\nTR"

The specific research ideas are as follows:first, it is based on theoretical model construction and comprehensive development level calculation of geographical elements [1]. On the basis of constructing the theoretical evaluation model framework of high-speed traffic superiority degree and tourism intensity, the mathematical statistics methods, such as entropy weight TOPSIS method, Bootstrap-DEA model, box graph and kernel density curve, and Arc GIS spatial analysis technology are used to measure the high-speed traffic superiority degree and tourism intensity of cities in the Yangtze River Delta region.

ArcGIS spatial analysis technology is used to measure the spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics of high-speed traffic dominance and tourism intensity, which is the basic work for the follow-up indepth research of the thesis. The range standardization method is used for data processing, and the normalized index matrix is multiplied by the weight matrix determined by the entropy weight method to obtain the weighted normalized evaluation matrix Y, as shown in Y = Y11 Y12 \u22ef Y1m Y21 Y22 \u22ef Y2m \u22ef \u22ef \u22ef \u22ef Yn1 Yn1 \u22ef Ynm 2 666664 3 777775 = r11 \u22c5 \u03c91 r12 \u22c5 \u03c92 \u22ef r1n \u22c5 \u03c9n r21 \u22c5 \u03c91 r22 \u22c5 \u03c92 \u22ef r2n \u22c5 \u03c9n \u22ef \u22ef \u22ef \u22ef rm1 \u22c5 \u03c91 rm2 \u22c5 \u03c91 \u22ef rmn \u22c5 \u03c9n 2 666664 3 777775 : \u00f01\u00de\nIn Formula (1), rmn represents the nth index in the mth year after standardization, and \u03c9 refers to weight.

Y- represents the minimum value of the jth index in the year i, and Y- is the negative ideal solution, namely the worst scheme [2], as shown in Figure 4.\nThe second is based on the verification of the spatialtemporal dynamic relationship between high-speed traffic dominance and tourism intensity. Determining the spatiotemporal dynamic relationship between the superiority degree of high-speed transportation and tourism intensity and the degree of interaction is a prerequisite for calculating the coupling coordination degree of transportation and tourism [3]. Bivariate LISA model, decoupling effect model, and panel vector autoregressive model are used to verify the spatio-temporal dynamic relationship between high-speed transportation superiority and tourism intensity from different perspectives of spatio-temporal correlation effect, decoupling effect, and dynamic interaction effect.\nThe third is to grasp the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the coupling coordination degree of highspeed transportation superiority and tourism intensity at multiple scales and from multiple perspectives and predict its future development trend. Based on the coupling coordination degree model, Arc GIS trend surface analysis module, Exploratory spatial Data analysis (ESDA), standard Deviation ellipse model (SDE), LISA time path and temporal, and spatial transition analysis (ESTDA) are used to calculate the coupling coordination index of high-speed transportation superiority and tourism intensity.

From the perspectives of internal endogenous force, interaction influence and external driving force, the internal action mechanism, interaction influence mechanism, and external driving mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of the travel-travel coupling coordination degree in the Yangtze River Delta region are extracted, respectively. The effect process, intensity and nature of each variable on the change of travel-travel coupling coordination degree in the Yangtze River Delta are systematically analyzed, and the main driving forces affecting the spatial differentiation of travel-travel coupling coordination degree are clarified [6]. Secondly, according to a series of empirical research conclusions, as well as the actual situation of high-speed transportation construction and tourism development in the Yangtze River Delta region, the optimization path and policy suggestions are proposed to promote the coupling and synergistic development of high-speed transportation superiority degree and tourism intensity in the Yangtze River Delta region. It provides an important basis for the construction of high-speed transportation system and the decision of regional tourism spatial integration and optimization in Yangtze River Delta.\n3.

            "text": "3.1.1. Regional Pole Theory. French economists formally put forward the concept of \u201cgrowth pole\u201d in the article On the Concept of \u201cGrowth Pole\u201d. In 1966, French geographer defined \u201cgrowth pole\u201d as the industrial complex with expanding urban area configuration and guiding the further development of economic activities under its influence. Growth pole is the \u201cengine\u201d of regional social activities and economic growth, which can form a polar core spatial structure. Later, on this basis, economic geographer Miller and Kiernan proposed the theory of \u201cdual-core\u201d spatial structure according to the development reality of China\u2019s coastal and riverside areas [8], as shown in Figure 7.\nAccording to the growth pole theory, the backward regions are generally broad in area and rich in natural resources, but these regions tend to have poor natural conditions, low degree of development, weak economic foundation, low transportation accessibility, and poor investment environment, etc., which seriously lack central cities to drive the overall development of the region. In this case, in order to accelerate the economic development of the above regions, the key is to cultivate the rise of central cities that can drive the overall development of the region and implement the unbalanced development strategy [9]. There are two ways to form the growth pole. One is to realize the agglomeration of factors of production in large central cities by using the mechanism of market spontaneous regulation, and give play to its agglomeration and scale effect to form the regional growth pole. The second is to give full play to\n(a) Centripetal polarization (b) Hierarchical polarization (c) Wavy ring layer polarization\nFigure 10: Evolution of the \u201cpoint-axis\u201d spatial structure system.\nRE TR AC\nTE\nthe government\u2019s macrocontrol role and use the government\u2019s intervention role. Adhering to the concept of \u201cconcentrated investment, key construction, agglomerated development, focusing on diffusion\u201d, regions, and industries with better conditions are selected to give key support and large-scale economic growth poles are cultivated, so as to give full play to the linkage role of the growth pole of \u201cpoint to surface\u201d, as shown in Figure 8. The tourism growth pole accelerates or restrains the tourism in the surrounding areas mainly through its polarization and diffusion. On the one hand, the polarization of tourism growth pole will lead to the gap of tourism development strength between it and its neighboring regions. On the other hand, by exerting its scale and agglomeration effect, tourism growth pole can transfer its tourism information flow, talent flow, capital flow, and tourism flow to the adjacent areas, and then play a driving role in the development of tourism in the adjacent areas. To a certain extent, it enlarges the tourism connection intensity among the tourism nodes and makes the node tourism economic connection model tend to compound network. At the same time, the tourism growth pole theory also provides useful theoretical guidance for less developed tourism areas to develop core tourism nodes by centralizing superior resources through government macrocontrol policies and exerting the regional linkage effect of tourism core nodes on surrounding cities, as shown in Figure 9.\nThe quality and radiation range of tourism nodes have also expanded significantly. Tourism exchanges and connections between tourism nodes must be supported by the transportation network system, which puts forward higher requirements for the quality and scale of transportation construction (axis). That is, the tourism axis between the nodes will gradually penetrate vertically and horizontally, thereby forming a set of tourism connection networks between multiple nodes. In a word, in the \u201cpoint-axis\u201d system theory of regional tourism destination, its basic elements include tourism nodes, tourism transportation axis, and tourism element flow [10]. The difference in development strength and industrial structure among tourism nodes is the internal dynamic mechanism for the formation of their agglomera-\ntion and diffusion effects. The tourism development axis is the bridge and carrier of the spatial transmission and configuration of the development factor flow between tourism nodes. Tourism element flow is the material and nonmaterial medium of spatial interaction between tourism nodes, as shown in Figure 10."

The construction of \u201ctransport-travel\u201d collaborative evaluation model is the basic work to calculate the coupling coordination degree of high-speed transportation superiority degree and tourism intensity. In the past, few studies have constructed the collaborative evaluation model of the two, which is not conducive to the understanding of the connotation of the coordination degree of transport and travel coupling and the systematic disclosure of its evolution law. High-speed transportation system and urban tourism development have a coupling and synergistic development trend and dynamic interaction process in geographical space, and this trend and process often promote the synergistic effect of transportation and tourism in physical space and virtual space, showing the continuous improvement of the coupling coordination level of transportation and tourism [11]. It is difficult to find an accurate model to evaluate these coupling synergistic relationships. In order to solve this problem, a more flexible evaluation system is needed to analyze the coordination process of \u201ctransport-travel\u201d, as shown in Figure 11.\nThe relationship between high-speed traffic advantage degree and intensity of tourism space coupling coordination degree (D), tourism intensity (TI), and high-speed traffic dominance (HST) is not a simple linear, but reflects the process of mutual optimization and integration and reorganization between systems [12]. It is the continuous process of driving reconstruction, mutual integration, and configuration optimization of the intersystem element system that can promote the coupling synergistic effect of high-speed transportation superiority and tourism intensity from low level (extreme imbalance) to high level (excellent coordination), as shown in Figures 12\u201314.\nY0\nY1\nY Y\nY0\nY1\nAS1\nAS0\nAD0\nAD1\nE1\nE0\nP0 P1 I0I1\nf(I)0\nf(I)1\nf(I)2\n(a) (b)\nRE\nTR\nAC\nTE D"

People enjoy a certain sense of gain and happiness [13]. However, there is no denying that there are also some problems in big cities, such as traffic congestion, shortage of education and medical resources, environmental pollution, group anxiety caused by stylized life pace, great psychological pressure of residents in big cities, and the proportion of people in subhealth state is increasing. On the whole, China\u2019s production capacity of modern industrial products has increased, while the supply capacity of ecological products has weakened, as shown in Figure 15.\nWith the improvement of people\u2019s income level and living standard, the demand for fresh air, clean water, pleasant\nclimate, and other ecological products, as well as the demand for leisure and health care seeking spiritual \u201chabitat\u201d and relieving pressure of tourism consumption is increasing day by day. An important reason for the sustainable development of small tourism towns in ethnic minority areas in the upper reaches of Minjiang River lies in the fact that this region can produce and provide characteristic products and play special functions. Relying on the huge population volume of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, it forms normal complementarity and communication with the products and functions provided by the large urban agglomeration. In other words, the region offers specific products and features that people in big cities need. Correspondingly, products such as strong and diverse ideas, advanced technological equipment, advanced concepts, convenient official service products, and huge consumer groups infused with postmodern consumer culture in big cities are urgently needed for the development of the region.

Based on high-quality characteristic natural tourism resources, they produce and provide highquality tourism products covering happiness industries. Relying on Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations, they radiate to major urban agglomerations in southwest China and even the whole country. It can meet the needs of people in large urban agglomerations for food safety, green ecological agricultural products, parent-child education, ethnic culture with different characteristics, handicrafts of minority ethnic groups, and other aspects [15]. It is complementary to the products produced and provided by the large urban agglomeration, and the two have formed perfect and regular complementarity in terms of products and functions. The tourism towns in this region and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration present their own continuous optimization and upgrading situation through two-way complementarity of products, which promotes the innovation and upgrading of tourism products and the development of tourism industry structure in this region, as well as the economic\nand social development and the sustainable development of tourism towns in this region. The complementary relationship between the two is shown in Figure 16.\nThe supply-side structural reform of tourism in ethnic minority areas in the upper reaches of Minjiang River should be actively promoted to improve the supply system structure and quality of tourism products in the region, so as to consolidate the industrial foundation for the sustainable development of small tourism towns in the region. Continuous tourist flow is the fundamental guarantee for the sustainable development of small tourist towns, and the continuous innovation and development of tourism products and their characteristics is the key to attract tourists. The upgrading of tourism product structure and the continuous improvement of tourism product quality are the foundation of the upgrading of tourism industry structure. Due to the inertia of tourism industry, minority areas in the upper reaches of Minjiang River fail to timely adapt to the consumer demand of independent personalized tourism era, and the concept and quality of the main body of the product supply system lag behind the changing trend of consumer demand of tourists for a long time, which affects and restricts the sustainable development of tourism economy in this region [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to innovate and upgrade the supply system of tourism products in this region, so as to promote the innovation and upgrade of tourism industry in this region and consolidate the industrial foundation of tourism towns in this region. Tourism products have obvious characteristics of simultaneous production and consumption and nontransferability, which makes the location conditions and accessibility of tourist destinations become important factors affecting the development of tourism in ethnic areas. The natural and cultural tourism resources and ethnic cultural resources of tourist destinations affect the location conditions to a great extent.

Excellent natural ecological environment itself is tourism resources, which can be developed into tourism products and extend the industry chain of tourism industry. At the same time, it can serve as environmental support for other tourism products, provide benign development space for the development of tourism in the region and the construction of tourism towns, and participate in the production and supply of tourism products in the region, becoming an important part of the tourism product system in the region. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ecological environment protection and environmental restoration in minority areas of the upper reaches of Minjiang River to provide environmental support for the development of tourism towns in this area. Building unique and outstanding traditional culture based on regional economy is abundant resources in national regions of the upper reaches of Minjiang river, the continuous culture source power of the region\u2019s tourism product innovation and development, the source of the core of the regional tourism products attractive tourism in the construction of small towns in the region, and the cultural source of highlighting its local characteristics. For the inno-\nvation and upgrading of tourism products, the sustainable development of tourism industry and the continuous promotion of tourism small towns in this region, the advantage resources of ethnic characteristic culture must be grasped, which has the most vitality. The stability and harmony of soft environment in minority areas in the upper reaches of Minjiang River depends on the effect of social governance. A stable and harmonious social environment is the social guarantee for the steady development of tourism in this region and the continuous promotion of tourism towns. The development of tourism depends on a safe and stable social environment. With the development of tourism in ethnic areas, a large number of tourists flood in, resulting in a variety of contradictions and disputes due to cultural differences, conflicts of interests, and other reasons. The uneven distribution of benefits brought by the development of tourism economy also leads to the increase of contradictions among the people in small tourist towns. If this situation is not managed well, it will inevitably affect the sustainable development of tourism in this region and the healthy development of tourism towns.\nRural revitalization and new-type urbanization, the two national strategies will have a significant impact on the economic and social development of China\u2019s rural areas, especially the ethnic minority areas in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River for a long period of time. Therefore, small tourist towns in this region, as well as economic and social development, national culture protection and inheritance, and rural grass-roots governance are research hotspots and directions for further research in this region. The research is expected to make due contributions to the economic and social development of the region. In view of the insufficient application of measurement methods in the research, it will continue to be improved according to my own actual situation, so as to conduct an in-depth research on the region."
