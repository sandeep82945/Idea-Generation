    "abstractText": "The responsivity of AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) when operating as zero-bias RF detectors in the subthreshold regime exhibits different behaviors depending on the operating temperature and gate length of the transistors. We have characterized in temperature (8\u2013400 K) the detection performance of HEMTs with different gate lengths (75\u2013250 nm). The detection results at 1 GHz can be reproduced by a quasi-static model, which allows us to interpret them by inspection of the output ID \u2212 VDS curves of the transistors. We explain the different behaviors observed in terms of the presence or absence of a shift in the zero-current operating point originating from the existence of the gate-leakage current jointly with temperature effects related to the ionization of bulk traps.",

            "text": "Field-effect transistors (FETs), thanks to their intrinsic nonlinearities, exhibit competitive performance as detectors of RF and THz signals [1]. Different FET technologies have been explored to this end: Si CMOS, graphene FETs, HEMTs based on GaN, GaAs, InGaAs, InAs, etc. [1\u201311]. Both when operating as zero-current and zero-voltage detectors (ZCDs and ZVDs, respectively), the maximum value of responsivity \u03b2 is typically achieved around threshold conditions. However, when entering the subthreshold region (the focus of this study), in ZVDs \u03b2 always vanishes, whereas in ZCDs, different behaviors can be observed. In some studies, a decrease in \u03b2 similar to that of ZVDs takes place [1,11], whereas in others, a saturation at the maximum value achieved around the threshold voltage is observed [6,7,10]. Attempts to explain these behaviors as due to the influence of gate-leakage current [4] or detector loading conditions [2,5] have been reported, but a comprehensive physical explanation is still lacking. In this study, we tackle this problem in the particular case of GaN HEMTs [4\u20139]. These devices present issues related to traps and leakage currents, widely studied and well understood when working as amplifiers [12\u201314]. Here, we focus on their influence on subthreshold zero-bias RF detection, with the devices working under totally different conditions. GaN HEMTs with several different gate lengths are measured in a wide temperature range, finding the aforementioned diverse behaviors of \u03b2 in the subthreshold results. We provide a global interpretation for them in terms of the competition between buffer and gate leakage currents, ionization of traps and third-quadrant conduction. Even if the results reported here are specific to GaN HEMTs, a\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22041515 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515 2 of 10\nsimilar influence of the gate-length and associated short-channel effects could be expected in other technologies. However, we have to remark that our conclusions are only valid up to frequencies for which the resistive mixing theory for current rectification is applicable. Within this theory, the RF responsivity can be related to the non-linearity of the I \u2212 V curves of the devices, and were applied in this study through a quasi-static analytical model. The same rectification mechanism still holds above the cut-off frequency of the devices as long as it is the result of distributed mixing, when the channel of the FET can no longer be treated as a lumped element, but rather as an ultra-high-frequency waveguide [15,16]. This is the frequency range typically addressed in the literature of FET-based detectors, where our conclusions can be directly applicable. However, it is not the case when entering into the THz range, where thermoelectric or plasmonic effects are involved in the rectification [17,18], and thus are not directly related to the DC characteristics of the devices."

The epilayer consists of a Si substrate with a 1.73 \u00b5m thick GaN buffer, a 1 nm AlN spacer, 14 nm of AlGaN (29% Al) and a top 0.5 nm GaN cap layer (more information about the devices is provided in Refs. [15\u201317]). In order to obtain a high-resistivity buffer and improve the device pinch-off, the n-type conductivity of the GaN buffer must be compensated with p-type doping. Typically, intentional (or unintentional) Fe or C doping is used to this end [22\u201325]. In our devices, C atoms in a concentration about 1017 cm\u22123 play this role [26]. This will have a strong influence on the results obtained, mainly at low temperature, when the acceptor ions are not ionized and the pinch-off behavior of the GaN HEMTs is degraded. For the measurements, the sample, placed inside a LakeShore CRX-VF (Lake Shore Cryotronics, Westerville, OH, USA) cryogenic probe station, was connected on-wafer to a Keysight N5244A PNA-X VNA, used as RF source, and a two-channel Keysight B2902A SMU, Keysight Technologies, Santa Rosa, CA, USA, (with 15 G\u2126 input impedance), which enabled both biasing of the device and recording the DC output. The injected RF signal of power Pin was coupled to the drain terminal and the average DC voltage shift \u2206VDS, whereas biasing with ID = 0 (or the DC current variation \u2206ID, while biasing with VDS = 0), was taken as the output signal; thus, the device operated as ZCD (or ZVD). The resultant responsivities are calculated as \u03b2ZCD = \u2206VDS/Pin or \u03b2ZVD = \u2206ID/Pin, and the corresponding noise equivalent powers as NEPZCD = (4kBTR)\n1/2/\u03b2ZCD and NEPZVD = (4kBT/R)\n1/2/\u03b2ZVD, with the resistance R measured at the zero-current or zero-voltage operating point, respectively. Operating temperatures T of 8, 20, 100, 200, 300 and 400 K were explored. The frequency of the RF signal was 1 GHz and Pin = \u221215 dBm. We remark that a simple quasi-static model based only on the DC ID \u2212 VDS curves [27] accurately reproduces the measurements of the RF responsivity in the entire gate-bias sweep and for all the temperature range."

Both responsivities take very low values in open-channel conditions and increase when VGS approaches Vth. However, when entering the subthreshold region, whereas \u03b2ZVD d creases (after reaching a maximum around Vth) irrespectively of the values of Lg and T, \u03b2ZCD ten s to ke p its maximum value for a wider range of VGS as Lg b comes longer and T increases above 100 K. Remarkably, in the case of Lg = 250 nm d T \u2265 300 K, \u03b2ZCD remains constant in the whole measured range of subthreshold operation, as in Reference [6]. In general, increasing values of Lg and T (below 300 K) lead to higher values of \u03b2ZCD. However, when T exceeds 300 K, \u03b2ZCD decreases [6]. The sensitivity of the transistors as RF detectors is assessed in terms of the NEP. NEPZCD and NEPZVD, shown in Figure 2c at 300 K, exhibited the typical minimum at VGS, slightly higher than Vth [2,6,8]. Interestingly, thanks to the plateau found in \u03b2ZCD when entering in the subthreshold regime, for Lg = 150 and 250 nm, the ZCD scheme provides improved values of NEP as compared with the ZVD case. We have confirmed (results no shown here) that if the load resistance in ZCD measurements is reduced, the responsivity is attenuated in subthreshold conditions, such as in [2,5], because the HEMT, operating in pi c -off, is not able to eliver the increasing c rent required by a lower load re stance to maintain the same r p nsivity. On the other hand, the observed dependencies are essentially the same when the frequency of the RF signal is increased up to 43.5 GHz (limit of our setup).\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515 4 of 10Sensors 20 2, 2 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 10\nA quasi-static (QS) model [27] based on the second-order Taylor series expansion of\nthe current as a function of the voltage is able to reproduce the previous results at 1 GHz.\nThe parameters of the model are calculated from the measured static \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46\u2013 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46 characteristics.

The two main contributions to the drain-leakage current IleakD in the subthreshold regime are schematically depicted in Figure 5. A primary contribution, IleakD\u2212G, comes from the electrons tunneled through the gate which, due to the practically symmetric electric potential profile present at low VDS under the gate, move towards its nearest edge. Thus, the gate current IG is split into two halves directed towards the source and drain [30,31]; thus, IleakD\u2212G \u223c= |IG|/2, with IG as the gate current. The second contribution is the source-to-drain buffer leakage IleakD\u2212B due to a poor electron confinement in the channel [32]. Figure 6a shows the transfer characteristics of the transistor with Lg = 250 nm at VDS = 0.1 V and different T, jointly with IleakD\u2212G. As observed in Figure 6b, for all the three gate lengths, a different behavior is observed for a T lower or higher than 200 K depending on the level of ionization of the acceptor-like doping present in the buffer:\n\u2022 At T < 200 K, the low ionization level of the GaN buffer acceptor levels allows for a significant leakage of drain current through the buffer IleakD\u2212B (see Figure 5a), which becomes the main contribution to IleakD and the zero-ID point remains close to VDS = 0 (see Figure 4 for 20 K and 100 K); \u2022 At T > 200 K, when full ionization is achieved, IleakD\u2212B is strongly suppressed, leading to an improved pinch-off (see Figure 4 for 200 and 300 K) [32\u201336]. Consequently, the two drain-leakage contributions become of the same order (\u00b5A), as sketched in Figure 5b, or even IleakD\u2212G as key:\n# For Lg = 75 nm, even if IleakD\u2212B is reduced, it is still significant (due to short channel effects) and of the order of IleakD\u2212G, as can be deduced from Figure 6b, where it is observed that IleakD > |IG|/2. In such a case, because IleakD\u2212G is positive and almost constant with VDS, the zero-ID condition is accomplished for a negative value of VDS, for which a negative IleakD\u2212B compensates I leak D\u2212G. As VGS\ntakes higher negative values, IleakD\u2212B decreases and a higher negative value of VDS is necessary to achieve zero current, but not yet reaching the third-quadrant conduction condition. At such a zero-ID point, the asymmetry of the ID \u2212VDS curves is degraded due to the symmetric contribution of IleakD\u2212B (similarly to what happens at T < 200 K, regardless of the gate length). This is the reason for the decrease in \u03b2ZCD observed at 300 K for this gate length in subthreshold conditions (see Figure 2a);\n# For long gates (Lg = 150 and 250 nm), thanks to the better gate control of the channel concentration (short channel effects are absent in this case), IleakD\u2212B is further reduced and IleakD essentially coincides with |IG|/2 (Figure 6b). Thus, the zero-ID point is only achieved when VDS reaches a value near VGS \u2212 Vth, at which the onset of third-quadrant conduction takes place in the transistor [9,28,29], and the significant increase in ID (no longer due to buffer leakage but to the opening of the channel for sufficiently negative values of VDS) can compensate IleakD\u2212G. These are the conditions shown in Figure 7a, for Lg = 250 nm and T = 300 K, for which the ZCD operation takes place at a point (ID = 0) with strong asymmetry (mainly due to the pronounced increase in ID once thirdquadrant conduction is reached). Consequently, the high value of \u03b2ZCD remains almost constant for VGS < Vth.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515 7 of 10\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 10 drain [30,31]; thus, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc37\u2212\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58 \u2245 |\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3a|/2, with \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3a as the gate current.

We attribute this\nbehavior to the ionization of deep donor-like traps, most probably located at the surface\nIn contrast to the complex behavior of the zero-ID point when entering into the subthreshold regime, the ID \u2212 VDS curve is essentially linear at the zero-VDS point for all temperatures and gate lengths. This originates in the decreasing values of \u03b2ZVD when VGS approaches Vth, as observed in Figure 3. Interestingly, when the device is illuminated with a 405 nm laser diode, the case shown in Figure 7b, the zero-ID conditions are achieved at lower values of VDS, where asymmetry is smaller. Consequently, \u03b2ZCD decreases in the subthreshold (blue curve in the inset) and exhibits a maximum as in low temperatures (T \u2264 100 K). We attribute this behavior to the ionization of deep donor-like traps, most probably located at the surface of the device in the vicinity of the gate, such as those originating in virtual-gate effects [37\u201339], although they could also be located in the buffer [36]. These traps, by becoming positively charged when electrons are released, weaken the pinch-off of the channel, allowing the presence of a higher IleakD\u2212B; thus, \u03b2ZCD shows a similar behavior to that observed at low T. Figure 7b clearly shows the onset of the third-quadrant conduction, evidenced by a sharp increase in ID for VDS < VGS \u2212Vth, whereas above that value the slope of the ID \u2212 VDS is small (and nearly constant). The key point here is that the illumination is able to shift the location of the zero-ID bias point from the onset of the third-quadrant conduction (as occurs in dark conditions) to the almost flat ID \u2212VDS region, thus leading to the decrease in \u03b2ZCD.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515 8 of 10\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 10\nFigure 6. \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58 and |IG|/2 at \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46= 0.1 V (a) as a function of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc46 measured at different T for the case of the transistor with Lg = 250 nm and (b) as a function of T for \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc46= \u22124.5 V for the three transistors under test.\nshown in Figure 7b, the zero-\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc37 conditions are achieved at lower values of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46, where asymmetry is smaller.

            "text": "The different behaviors exhibited by the subthreshold responsivity of zero-bias RF detectors based on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs (with the signal coupled to the drain) have been explained in terms of the competition between the two (gate and buffer) contributions to the drain leakage current and the influence of bulk traps. When the channel is properly pinched off (high temperature and long gate), due to the presence of a gate-leakage current, the zero-ID point is shifted to negative values of VDS, where the nonlinearity of the ID \u2212VDS curves is enhanced, leading to the saturation of the responsivity at its maximum value in subthreshold operation and thus to an improved sensitivity in terms of the NEPZCD. The shift is not present (or is less pronounced) at low temperature and/or in transistors with strong short-channel effects, cases in which the responsivity just shows a maximum around the threshold voltage for then decreasing when entering deep into the subthreshold region (leading to a poorer NEP), as happens in all cases when detection takes place under zero-VDS operation. While the trap-related temperature effects are distinctive of GaN HEMTs, the influence of gate length and associated short-channel effects discussed in this paper could also be of importance in other FET technologies. Finally, we remark that although in this study we used a drain-coupling scheme for the RF characterization of the devices under probes, in the case of free-space THz characterization, a gate-coupling scheme is used more often [3,6,8,10,11]. However, the conclusions drawn from our experiments are also valid for the case of gate coupling, because the responsivity for both schemes is related to the non-linearity of the I \u2212 V curves of the HEMTs (around the DC bias point).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., J.M. and T.G.; Data curation, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., J.M. and T.G.; Formal analysis, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., J.M. and T.G.; Funding acquisition, J.M. and T.G.; Investigation, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., H.S.-M. and J.A.N.-L.; Methodology, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., J.M. and T.G.; Project administration, J.M. and T.G.; Resources, V.H. and Y.C.; Software, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., H.S.-M. and J.A.N.-L.; Supervision, J.M. and T.G.; Validation, G.P.-M. and I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T.;\nSensors 2022, 22, 1515 9 of 10\nVisualization, G.P.-M. and I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T.; Writing\u2014original draft, G.P.-M. and T.G.; Writing\u2014review and editing, G.P.-M., I.\u00cd.-d.-l.-T., J.M. and T.G.
