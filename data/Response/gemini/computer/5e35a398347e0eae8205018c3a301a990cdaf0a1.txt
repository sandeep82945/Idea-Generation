1. **Investigate the relationship between the geometry of viral structures and their infectivity.** This could involve studying how the shape and size of a virus particle affects its ability to attach to and enter host cells. This knowledge could be used to design antiviral drugs that target specific geometric features of viruses.


2. **Develop new methods for simulating the dynamics of viral structures.** This could involve using more powerful computer hardware or developing new algorithms that are more efficient at simulating the motion of large molecules. This knowledge could be used to study how viruses move and interact with each other and with host cells.


3. **Explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze viral structures.** AI could be used to identify patterns in viral structures that are associated with infectivity or drug resistance. This knowledge could be used to develop new antiviral drugs or vaccines.


4. **Investigate the role of the environment in viral infections.** This could involve studying how the temperature, pH, and other environmental factors affect the infectivity of viruses. This knowledge could be used to develop new strategies for preventing and treating viral infections.


5. **Develop new methods for delivering antiviral drugs to infected cells.** This could involve using nanotechnology or other novel drug delivery systems to target antiviral drugs specifically to infected cells. This knowledge could lead to more effective and less toxic antiviral therapies.
