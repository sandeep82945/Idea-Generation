    "abstractText": "Background Gastric carcinoma is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide. Gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon in incidence, and has been rarely described in acute-appendicitis-related literature reviews. In this presented case, we have reported a rare case of appendiceal phlegmon, due to a diagnosis of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with uncommon symptoms. Case presentation A 79-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with history of weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and mood changes for 2 months. Abdominopelvic computed tomography showed an abscess in right iliac muscle. After percutaneous drainage of the abscess and 6 weeks antibiotic therapy, an appendectomy was done for the patient. Histopathologic findings revealed the involvement of the appendiceal wall by adenocarcinoma, most probably with gastrointestinal origin. Gastric cancer was confirmed later by upper endoscopy and pathologic report. Conclusions Although the presence of tumor in appendectomy specimens is rare, and metastasis to appendix is even rarer, it should be considered as a cause of appendicitis, especially in elderly patients.",

Gastric adenocarcinoma, with a prevalence of 85% among gastric cancers, is considered the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide [2]. Most patients with gastric carcinoma are symptomatic, and are often diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease when they have metastatic lesions in other organs [3]. Gastric cancer disseminates through straight development across the gastric wall to the perigastric organs (liver and pancreas) and lymphatics, and results in seeding of peritoneal regions [2]. Liver, peritoneum, lung, and bone are the most frequent sites of gastric metastasis. The average survival after diagnosis in metastatic gastric carcinoma is 3\u00a0months, worse among individuals with metastasis to bone and liver (2\u00a0months) [4]. Gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon in terms of incidence, and has been rarely described in acute-appendicitis-related literature reviews [5\u20138]. In this presented case, we have reported a case of appendiceal phlegmon, due to the diagnosis of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma admitted with septic shock."

Eventually, the patient underwent upper endoscopy, which revealed an infiltrative and circumferential tumoral stenosis in the body of the stomach. The pathology report showed severe dysplastic gastric mucosa, with an ulcerative feature compatible with gastric well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig.\u00a02). Due to distant metastasis, the patient was referred to the oncology ward with diagnosis of stage IV gastric cancer and underwent chemotherapy.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "There is limited evidence in studies describing the presence of appendiceal metastasis as the first manifestation of primary cancer. Araujo et\u00a0al. study showed that incidental appendiceal tumor followed by appendectomy occurs in only 0.9% of patients and metastasis to the appendix is very rare and the most origin sites are lungs, stomach and colon [9]. Yoon et\u00a0 al. found that appendiceal metastasis is usually associated with an extensive stage of disease, in which the average survival rate was 22.6\u00a0months. The combination of the female sex, simultaneous diagnosis of appendiceal metastasis with the primary tumor, and initiation of chemotherapy ensured a longer survival [10].\nGastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies around the world and the patients are already in the advanced stages of such incurable disease [1\u20133].\nThe average prognosis in metastatic gastric carcinoma is 3\u00a0months, which is worse among individuals with metastasis to bone and liver (2\u00a0months) [4].\nAlthough gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon, it can remain asymptomatic and be diagnosed accidentally [8]. However, in the most documented cases, due to adherence of metastatic cancer cells to the serosa and infiltration of all the appendix layers, lumen obstruction can develop, leading to inflammation, appendicitis symptoms, and perforation [7]. The mechanism of metastasis remains unknown, but it has been considered that the appendix is infiltrated by peritoneal seeding, or even indicates a single peritoneal mass [6].\nGastric adenocarcinoma is radioresistant neoplasm, and for sufficient control of the primary tumor, doses of external beam irradiation are required, specifically which overpass adjacent organs\u2019 resistance, for example, bowel mucosa. Therefore, pain relief is the prominent role of radiation therapy in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma. Among patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, 30\u201350% respond relatively well to a combination of cytotoxic agents. Regardless of the response rates, complete remission is rare, partial responses are temporary, and the general effect of combination therapy on survival is low [2].\nThirteen to twenty percent of acute appendicitis cases lead to perforation, with higher rates occurring in men and elderly adults [11]. In imaging studies, appendicitis may present with a localized perforation (an inflammatory lesion frequently referred to as a \u201cphlegmon\u201d) or, infrequently, a free perforation. The management of perforated appendicitis is determined by the patient\u2019s situation (stable versus unstable), the type of perforation, and whether an abscess or phlegmon is present in imaging studies [12]. Stable patients with extensive (> 3\u00a0 cm) abscesses must first be managed with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage [13]. Urgent surgery in patients presenting with symptoms over a long period, and phlegmon or abscess development, has been shown to lead to increased morbidity due to firm adhesion and inflammation. Conservative management of the initial admission enables a decrease in regional inflammation, and interval appendectomy can be performed at a lower risk [14]. Following favorable conservative management of perforated appendicitis, all patients should undergo follow-up in 6\u20138\u00a0weeks, to carry out interval appendectomy to rule out an appendiceal tumor. The appendiceal tumor is much more prevalent in the interval appendectomy specimens (10\u201329%), compared with conventional appendectomy specimens (0.9\u20131.4%), particularly in patients over 40\u00a0years old [15, 16].\n\u2022 fast, convenient online submission\n\u2022 thorough peer review by experienced researchers in your field\n\u2022 rapid publication on acceptance\n\u2022 support for research data, including large and complex data types\n\u2022 gold Open Access which fosters wider collaboration and increased citations\nmaximum visibility for your research: over 100M website views per year \u2022\nAt BMC, research is always in progress.\nLearn more biomedcentral.com/submissions\nReady to submit your research ?
