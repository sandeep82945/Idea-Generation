This article presents a simple and effective method to correct for ionospheric effects, with an evaluation on data obtained with GRAVES, the French space surveillance radar. This method relies on GPS data, and our evaluation relies on GRAVES and DORIS data. We found that the gain in terms of evaluated radial velocity can be as high as 1.76\u03ba, where \u03ba is the typical root mean square of the noise on radial velocity measurements for GRAVES (excluding ionospheric effects): the error decreases from 2.60\u03ba to 0.83\u03ba for daytime satellite overhead passes. Our conclusion is that, while this method is very simple to implement, it has proven to be a good correction for ionospheric effects in practice. \u00a9 2022 COSPAR.

The quality of the data is critical for the precision of the satellite ephemeris produced by the system. An important source of error in the data is the influence of the ionosphere.\nEngineers who design a space surveillance radar thus have to measure and compensate the perturbation on the radar wave that is induced by its propagation in the ionosphere (Hapgood, 2010).\nThe aim of this article is to describe a robust and very easyto-use method to take into account the influence of the ionosphere, along with an assessment of the performance of this method using data acquired by GRAVES (grand re\u0301seau adapte\u0301 a\u0300 la veille spatiale) \u2014 the French space surveillance radar \u2014 on DORIS (Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite) satellites. This method relies only on two\n\u2217Corresponding author Email address: olivier.herscovici@onera.fr (Olivier\nHerscovici-Schiller)\ndual-frequency GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers: one at the emission site of the radar, and one at the reception site. Our goal is to allow an estimation of the total electronic content of the ionosphere using only a single station at the reception site and a single station at the reception site.\nIn section 2, we describe the influence of the ionosphere on electromagnetic waves. In section 3, we introduce how we retrieve the total electron content from GNSS data. In section 4, we assess the gain in accuracy on the radial velocity. We do this by taking DORIS data as the ground truth, and use it to calculate the error that is made in the evaluation of the radial velocity measurement with and without the correction."

            "text": "The ionosphere is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized, mainly under the influence of the Sun. A good description of the ionosphere from the point of view of ionospheric tomography is given by Fehmers (1996). The quantity of interest is the\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n15 64\n4v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. sp\nac e-\nph ]\n3 1\ntotal electron content (TEC). It is the linear integral of the electron density in a given direction. The total electron content from the ground to the zenith at any point of the Earth is called the vertical total electron content (vTEC). The total electron content in a given direction, for example from a ground station to a satellite, is called the slant total electron content (sTEC). The TEC (or vTEC, or sTEC) is measured in m\u22122 in the international system, but it is often expressed in TECu (total electron content unit), with 1 TECu = 1016 m\u22122.\nA review of the techniques for modeling the total electron content of the ionosphere can be found in Bust & Mitchell (2008). New developments are still ongoing (see for example Bidaine & Warnant (2010); Ansari et al. (2017); Li et al. (2020b); Yasyukevich et al. (2015, 2020, 2022); Li et al. (2021); Pudlovskiy (2021)); notably machine learning techniques have developed in this field like many others (Orus Perez, 2019; Mallika I et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2017). Typical examples of tomography reconstruction algorithm of the ionosphere in the literature, such as Seemala et al. (2014), model the TEC over wide timescales (more than an hour, possibly more than a half day) and wide geographical regions (with cells hundreds of kilometers wide). The goal of such methods is usually to model the ionosphere as precisely as possible, using as many data point as possible. This is quite different from our goal here, which is to model the impact of the ionosphere as seen from a single ground station as easily as possible, using only data from the station.\nAmong the models of the ionosphere in the context of GNSS, two notable ones are the Klobuchar model, and NeQuick. The Klobuchar model (Klobuchar, 1987), which is particularly simple (Petit & Luzum, 2010), is used to correct the signal received from GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites. The NeQuick model (Nava et al., 2008), is used to correct the signal received from Galileo satellites. There are many more models available. The interested reader can refer to Collective (2014)."

This induces a shift in the Doppler measurement \u2206v of the radial velocity of the satellite as seen by the radar, which is well approximated (Parkinson & Spilker, 1996) by\n\u2206v = 40.3 f 2 \u00d7 dIs dt , (1)\nwhere f is the frequency of the radar wave, Is is the sTEC (slant total electron content) and t is the time. The factor 40.3 is correct as long as all parameters are expressed in the units of the international system. A key point for ionospheric tomography is that this phase shift is chromatic, which allows the use of dual-band GNSS receivers to retrieve the electron content (Odijk, 2003) of the ionosphere. Our theoretical framework for the retrieval of the slant electron content is close to the one used by Lanyi & Roth (1988)."

Following (El-Rabbany, 2011), we will regard those biases as constants over a few hours, although they may sometimes change faster (Li et al., 2020a).\nWe chose to characterize the ionosphere by a single coefficient, which is the vTEC at the zenith over the ground station. We follow Klobuchar (1987) and choose a single-layer representation of the ionosphere. The relationship between the vTEC and the sTEC (Is) is then\nIs(e) = Iv cos { sin\u22121 [ RT\nRT +h \u00d7 cos(e) ]} , (3) where e is the elevation of the satellite, Iv is the vTEC, RT is the radius of the Earth and h = 350 km is the altitude of the ionosphere layer. Using the fact that cos = \u00b1 \u221a 1 \u2212 sin2, this is equivalent to the equation (3) of Wielgosz et al. (2021) (for \u03b1 = 1), itself building upon Schaer (1999).

The DORIS system (Auriol & Tourain, 2010) allows us to obtain (a posteriori) the orbit of some satellites with centimetric precision (Jayles & Costes, 2004). This in turn allows us to simulate the Doppler measurements that GRAVES should have produced, in the absence of any perturbation, according to the DORIS orbit reconstruction. So, on the one hand, we have the radial velocity data points that GRAVES should have produced on some satellites in the absence of perturbation. On the other hand, we have the raw radial velocity data points that GRAVES actually produced on those satellites. We call \u2206v the difference between those radial velocities. Most of it is expected to be a consequence of the influence of the ionosphere.\nWe will call this \u2206v the \u2206v without ionospheric correction. We will compare it to \u2206v with ionospheric correction, that is, with the correction calculated in section 3. Since the correction is applied to satellite in low Earth orbit, but the correction is calculated on GPS satellites, we apply a factor 0.9 to the correction, because about 10% of the ionosphere is included between the altitdue of 1 000 km (low Earth orbit) to 25 000 km (orbit of GPS satellites) (Nava et al., 2008).\nIn this paper, all \u2206v are expressed in units of \u03ba, which is homogeneous to m.s-1, and which is the typical root mean square of the noise on radial velocity measurements for GRAVES (excluding ionospheric effects). We chose to express \u2206v in units of \u03ba because the detailed performance of GRAVES is not public at the moment."

            "text": "The previous quantitative results are brought together for comparison in table 2.\nFirst, we recall that \u03ba is the typical root mean square of the noise on radial velocity measurements for GRAVES excluding ionospheric effects, while \u2206v is the root mean square of the noise on radial velocity measurements due to ionospheric effects. Since \u2206v > \u03ba, ionospheric effects are clearly an important contributor to the overall error, thus it is indeed important to correct them, as stated in the introduction.\nWe can see that ionospheric effects are more important during daytime than during nighttime. This is not surprising, as the Sun is largely the main driver of ionospheric activity.\nAlso, while our proposed correction works during nighttime, it is during daytime that it is both most efficient and most necessary."

            "text": "The method presented here can be refined in various ways. Instead of using the simple standard single layer model for equation 4, we could use a modified single layer model mapping as in Feltens et al. (2018). We could also constrain the reconstruction of the parameters like in Yasyukevich et al. (2020).\nWe could test our reconstructions with a more general formula to take into account the altitude of the satellite, as well as the climatological state of the ionosphere, which is more contracted during solar minimum and expanded during solar maximum.\nFinally, we did not investigate the influence of solar activity (which is responsible for extreme ultraviolet photons production) nor geomagnetic activity on the ionosphere, while these are well-known factors. We expect the correction of ionospheric effects to be more important during episodes which induce high ionospheric activity, and we will have to study this during the next solar maximum, in a few years."

            "heading": "6. Conclusion",
            "text": "We developed a simple method to address the need for taking into account ionospheric effects in the use of a space surveillance radar. This method relies only on data produced by dualfrequency GNSS receivers at the emission and reception sites.\nWe tested this method on GRAVES data using DORIS a posteriori orbits as ground truth. This method allows a notable reduction of the error due to the ionospheric effect. In particular, we reach a reduction in the radial velocity estimate from 2.60\u03ba to 0.83\u03ba (root mean square average) on daytime measurements.\nSo, while the method that we propose is very simple to implement, it has proven to be a good correction for ionospheric effects in practice."
