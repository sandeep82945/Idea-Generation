We propose a receiver robust to the Doppler shifts derived from a non-coherent detection criterion. We compare its performance to another non-coherent receiver based on a linear approximation of the CPM signal (Laurent decomposition) to which we add a Doppler compensation. Simulation results show that the first algorithm is robust to low-moderate Doppler shifts, while the second is robust to any one. We finally compare these two algorithms to delay-optimized differential detectors which do not require any Doppler shift estimation.

INTRODUCTION\nImproving the connection of Objects to the Internet (IoT) is possible by relaying the communication through Low Earth Orbits (LEO) satellites [1], especially in areas where setting up gateways is costly. There are two options: use an existing wireless communication standard or design an ad-hoc one [2]. In this paper we are interested in the latter one for the uplink and suggest using a Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM). Its constant envelop enables an optimized energy efficiency of the amplifier which is of utmost importance both for satellites and objects.\nThis communication segment is affected by Doppler shifts due to the high orbiting speed of LEO satellites. So the detection algorithms should be robust to Doppler shifts. We focus in this article on non-coherent CPM detection which can be grouped into two families depending on the criterion they are based on. The first one pre-processes the received signal to neutralize the phase contribution making possible the application of the maximum-likelihood criterion for coherent detection on the resulting signal. Numerous papers based on differential preprocessed signals can be found in the state-of-the-art. The common feature is the use of the product of the received baseband signal and a conjugate time-delayed version of it, yielding a signal that is referred to as differential signal.\nThis work has been financially supported by Thales Alenia Space and Brest Me\u0301tropole.\nDifferent algorithms are proposed and applied either on timediscrete differential signals (see e.g. [3]) or on time-continuous differential signals (see e.g. [4]\u2013[8]). The main advantage of differential algorithms is their robustness to Doppler shifts, but the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss can be important depending on the algorithm. The second non-coherent detection class is derived from the generalized maximum-likelihood criterion [9], [10] and only requires the knowledge of the phase distribution. Algorithms proposed either in [11] or in [12] with an uniformly-distributed phase assumption belong to it. In this article, we propose two algorithms both based on this non-coherent criterion and robust to Doppler shifts. The contributions are (i) a novel CPM non-coherent detection based on the direct application of the generalized maximum likelihood principle (ii) the insertion of blind Doppler estimation principle of [13] in the proposed algorithm as well as in the CPM non-coherent detection of [12] (iii) the comparison of the two resulting receivers with the delay-optimized differential detector of [8] in presence of Doppler shifts. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: model and notations are introduced in Section II. In Section III, we derive the non-coherent detection criterion and the two proposed detection algorithms. Simulation results are provided in Section IV and a conclusion is given in Section V."

            "text": "This receiver combines the non-coherent CPM detection algorithm [12] with the Doppler estimation and joint detection algorithm applied to a linear modulation [13]. We consider a linear decomposition of the CPM modulation [14], [15] to get an approximation of the modulated signal: s(t,a) \u2243\u2211K\u22121\nk=0 \u2211N\u22121 i=0 \u03b1k,ihk(t \u2212 iTs) where K is the number of\nprincipal components, hk(t) the impulse response of the kth linear filter and \u03b1k,i a symbol defined from a (see [15] for exact expressions). The receiver consists of a cascade of a filter bank where filters are adapted to hk(t), followed by a sampler at period Te, and a whitening filter. Te should be small enough to assume that the samples are a sufficient statistic [16]. However, for a moderate frequency offset (fDTs \u226a 1), Te = Ts is small enough. The sampler outputs are given by:\nxk,n = r(t,a)\u2297 hk(\u2212t)|t=nTs \u2243 sk,nej(2\u03c0fDnTs+\u03d5) + \u03b7k,n\nwhere\nsk,n = K\u22121\u2211 m=0 \u2211 i \u03b1m,ipm,k((n\u2212 i)Ts), (7)\nwith pm,k(t) = hm(t) \u2297 hk(\u2212t) and \u03b7k,n = \u03b7(t) \u2297 hk(\u2212t)|t=nTs . We introduce the notation xn = (x0,n, x1,n, ..., xK\u22121,n)\nT and define sn, \u03b1n and \u03b7n likewise. We will also use the discrete impulse response matrices Pn = [pi,j(nT )] for i, j = 0, 1, ...,K \u2212 1. With these notations, the observation vector reads:\nxn \u2243 ej(2\u03c0fDnT+\u03d5) Lw\u2211\nl=\u2212Lw\nPTl \u03b1n\u2212l + \u03b7n, (8)\nwhere Lw is a parameter that depends on L. As the noise samples \u03b7k,n are correlated, a multidimensional whitening filter (WMF) is implemented [12]. It is specified by the sequence of matrices {Wl}0\u2264l\u2264Lw . The WMF output observation vector, denoted by zn, is given by:\nzn = Lw\u2211 l=0 Wlxn\u2212l\n= ej(2\u03c0fDnTs+\u03d5) Lw\u2211 l=0 Wlsn\u2212le \u2212j2\u03c0lfDTs +wn,\n(9)\nwhere wn = Lw\u2211 l=0 Wl\u03b7n\u2212l. Going back to the detection criterion, we apply two approximations. The first one is to consider log I0(x) \u2243 x. The second one depends on the context: we assumes that fDTs is small and that e\u2212j2\u03c0lfDTs \u2243 1 in the expression (9) of zn. Given a sequence a\u0303 of symbols in A, we define s\u0303n with (7) and finally\ny\u0303n = Lw\u2211 l=0 Wls\u0303n\u2212l.

As in [13], a per-survivor processing (PSP) approach enables to estimate f\u0302D(a\u0303nn\u2212ND ) based on a\u0303n and the partial sequence a\u0303n\u22121n\u2212ND = (a\u0303n\u22121 . . . a\u0303n\u2212ND+1) associated to the surviving path at state level at time n \u2212 1. The dataaided (DA) estimation algorithms proposed for linear phase modulations in [17] are easily applied to the CPM case."

To reduce the complexity, we apply the iterative approximation of \u039b(a\u0303) under the same principles of windowing and of definition of the cumulative and branch metrics:\n\u03bbn(a\u0303) = \u0393n(a\u0303)\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b (n\u22121)Ts (n\u2212Nv)Ts vn(t,a)s \u2217(t, a\u0303)dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (12) where \u0393n(a\u0303) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b tn tn\u2212Nv vn(t, a\u0303)s \u2217(t, a\u0303)dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223.

The estimation f\u0302D(a\u0303nn\u2212ND ) is done as for receiver A using the PSP approach on a window of length ND.

(13)\nThe term depending on \u03b8(t, a\u0303) in the interval [tn\u2212m\u22121, tn\u2212m] can be simplified:\n\u03b8(t, a\u0303) = 2\u03c0h n\u2212m\u22121\u2211 u=0 a\u0303uq(t\u2212uTs) = \u0398(t, a\u0303)+\u03c0h n\u2212m\u2212L\u22121\u2211 u=0 a\u0303u (14) with \u0398(t, a\u0303) = 2\u03c0h \u2211n\u2212m\u22121 u=n\u2212m\u2212L a\u0303uq(t\u2212 uTs).

These performances will also be compared to differential detection based decoders [8] which are robust to any constant Doppler shift. Differential detection is built on the generation of a differential signal which is obtained by multiplying the received signal with its delayed version. The considered delay is given by the number K of symbols and is usually K = 1. However, performances can be improved by optimizing K as proposed in [8].

            "text": "In this section, bit error rates (BER) are estimated through Monte-Carlo simulations as a function of the ratio Eb/N0 where Eb denotes the average information bit energy. To this aim, we take into account the overhead used for initialization and estimation in the calculation of Eb/N0. We illustrate the error rate performance by first considering the GMSK waveform in Figure 1, with BT = 0.25 and L = 2 to transmit short frames of N = 120 symbols. The symbol duration is fixed to Ts = 10\u22124s. The blind estimation of fD in detectors A and B is obtained by an algorithm from Rife and Boorstyn [17]. For detector A, we proceed as in [18] by keeping only the first of the principal components resulting from the linearization of the GMSK leading to a one-dimensional whitening filter (K = 1) with Lw = 2. In the simulations, the choice of Nv = 5 and ND = 8 proved to be the best trade-off between complexity and performance for both detectors.\nFor a small Doppler shift fDTs = 0.05, detector A and B perform nearly the same with a loss of 1 dB compared to the NSD performance which correspond to the performance without any Doppler shift. When the Doppler shift is increased to fDTs = 0.1, the performance of detector A is degraded and a gap of 3 dB compared to the NSD is observed at a BER of 10\u22124. Indeed, when the Doppler shift increases,\nthe assumption of sufficient statistics does not hold anymore. This is not the case with detector B whose performance is only limited by the capabilities of the Doppler shift estimation algorithm. In fact, with a perfect Doppler shift estimation, the detector B and NSD curves are superimposed.\nDifferential detectors are insensitive to the Doppler shift and exhibit the same error rate whatever the value of fD. We observe that fDTs = 10\u22121 is the threshold beyond which the BER curve of the differential detection with optimized delay crosses the BER curve of Detector B at a BER of 2.10\u22125. The error rate comparison between Detector B and differential detections for a 3REC CPM with h = 0.75 is illustrated in Figure 2 using the same Doppler shift estimation as for the previous GMSK case (same frequency resolution size). We observe that the gap to NSD is however higher (about 3 dB for a BER of 10\u22123). We also observe that the performance of differential detection with optimized delay peforms better below a BER of 10\u22122. It is of course possible to improve the gap between Detector B and NSD by improving the Doppler shift estimation, yielding a higher complexity. In the following, a complexity estimation is proposed to unveil the best performance-complexity trade-offs."

            "text": "In this Section, we propose to estimate the complexity of detectors in terms of the number of trellis states (S), the number of multiplications for metric calculation (QM ) per trellis section and the number of multiplications for Doppler Shift estimation per trellis section (QD). The complexity of the three detectors is summarized in the Table I.\nDetector A based on Laurent\u2019s decomposition enables sampling at symbol time if the Doppler frequency shift remains moderate. The calculation of branch metrics amounts\nto NvMNv+Lw multiplications per trellis section, while the matched filtering involves (Lw + 1)K2 per trellis section.\nIn the case of detector B, the multiplications come solely from the branch metric calculations. The numerical calculation of the integral requires a discretization of the signal. Assuming it is done with \u03c1 samples per symbol time, the total number of multiplications per trellis section is given by \u03c1NvMNv+L\u22121.\nBoth detectors A and B use the Rife and Boorstyn [17] algorithm to blindly estimate the Doppler shifts. Its implementation uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a vector of \u03c1ND samples (\u03c1 = 1 for detector A) obtained by multiplying the received signal with the complex conjugate of the signal reconstructed from the last ND symbols using the PSP approach (amounting to S\u03c1(ND \u2212 1) + MS\u03c1 multiplications). Zero padding this vector up to NFFT samples is used to increase the FFT resolution and thus the blind Doppler shift estimation resolution which affects the overall performance (amounting to MSNFFT2 log2(NFFT) multiplications).\nThe optimized-delay differential detector is also based on a trellis and the calculation of its metrics requires oversampling the signal as well, that is \u03c1 samples per symbol time. The\nnumber of multiplications is then given by \u03c1MKopt+L and no Doppler estimation is needed for the differential detector.\nTable II summarizes the numerical values of S, QM and QD used in our simulations in the case of GMSK with \u03c1 = 8. NFFT = 32 for detector A and NFFT = 32 \u00d7 \u03c1 = 256 for detector B so that the frequency resolution is the same.\nConsidering both complexity and error rates, we can state that differential detection with optimized delay from [8] is to be chosen in the high SNR regime or if low complexity is mandatory. If the constraint on complexity is a bit relaxed and lower SNR is considered, then detector A can be chosen if the Doppler shift is small. For larger Doppler shifts and low SNR, improved performance can be obtained close to the nonDoppler case with Detector B while increasing the complexity (both on the metric part and on the Doppler estimation part). The thresholds involved in this comparison do depend on the considered CPM parameters."

            "text": "In this article, we proposed two CPM detectors robust to phase uncertainty and Doppler shift. The first one (A) is adapted from a non-coherent CPM detection based on a linear decomposition that we complemented by a blind Doppler shift estimation part. The second one (B) is directly derived from the non-coherent detection criterion applied to the CPM waveform. The simulation results confirm the robustness of these detectors to small Doppler shifts, and to higher Doppler shifts for Detector B for which the only limitation is the performance of the blind Doppler shift estimator. Detector A and B are also compared to differential detectors. When an optimized delay is used, differential detection performs better in the high SNR / low error rate regime, while keeping a low complexity: differential detection does not include any Doppler shift estimation. As far as a lower SNR regime is concerned, provided that complexity is not an issue, Detector A for low Doppler shifts and Detector B otherwise offer better performances."
