    "abstractText": "In this paper, the problem of wireless resource allocation and semantic information extraction for energy efficient semantic communications over wireless networks with rate splitting is investigated. In the considered model, a base station (BS) first extracts semantic information from its large-scale data, and then transmits the small-sized semantic information to each user which recovers the original data based on its local common knowledge. At the BS side, the probability graph is used to extract multi-level semantic information. In the downlink transmission, a rate splitting scheme is adopted, while the private small-sized semantic information is transmitted through private message and the common knowledge is transmitted through common message. Due to limited wireless resource, both computation energy and transmission energy are considered. This joint computation and communication problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the total communication and computation energy consumption of the network under computation, latency, and transmit power constraints. To solve this problem, an alternating algorithm is proposed where the closed-form solutions for semantic information extraction ratio and computation frequency are obtained at each step. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe rapid development of emerging applications such as digital twin, edge learning, and metaverse requires wireless networks to support high transmission data rate, ultra low latency, and seamless connectivity [1]\u2013[4]. However, due to limited wireless resources such as frequency and time, conventional orthogonal multiple access schemes cannot support massive connectivity concern for next-generation wireless communication networks [5]. Through using the same time\nThis work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61725104 and U20A20158, and National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1801104 and 2020YFB1807101.

Since additional users can be served with superposition coding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, the spectral efficiency of NOMA is generally higher than conventional orthogonal multiple access schemes.\nIn downlink NOMA transmission, the receiver side decodes the interference for all received strong messages [11]. Thus, the computation capacity of NOMA decoding is generally high. To balance the decoding tradeoff of intended signal and interference signal, the concept of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) was introduced in [12]\u2013[15]. For downlink RSMA transmission, the transmission message intended for each user is divided into both common and private parts. All users intend to receive the common part of the message, i.e., common message, while only part of the users wish to receive and decode the specific private part of the message, i.e., private message. At the user side, the common message is decoded first with regarding all private messages as interference, while the intended private message is decoded with only considering the private messages intended for other users as interference. Through dynamically controlling the split of private and common messages, the computation complexity of RSMA can be adjusted to achieve the specific spectral efficiency requirements. To implement RSMA for wireless communication systems, there are still many challenges, which include the resource allocation for private and common messages, decoding order optimization, system design in imperfect channel and hardware mismatch cases.\nThere are many contributions investigating the problems of RSMA in wireless communication systems. The general challenges of RSMA were pointed out in [14] for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems. To maximize the sum rate of all users, a distributed rate splitting technique was proposed in [16]. For a two-receiver multiple input single output (MISO) communication system with limited rate feedback, the rate analysis was investigated in [17]. Compared with NOMA and space-division multiple access (SDMA), it was shown in [18] that RSMA can achieve the best performance in terms of spectral and energy efficiency [19]. In particular, the energy efficiency optimization for RSMA and NOMA transmissions in a unmanned aerial vehicle assisted wireless communication system was investigated in [20] . Considering wireless energy transfer and information transmission, the linear precoding method for RSMA was investigated in [21]. For the case with imperfect channel state information, the sum rate maximization with partial channel\n2 state information for RSMA was studied in [22], while a downlink MISO RSMA system with bounded channel errors was investigated in [23].\nThe interplay between rate splitting with emerging technologies has been investigated. With the help of reconfigurable intelligent surface, the energy efficient resource allocation for reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted RSMA was investigated in [24], where the phase shift, rate allocation, and trasnmit beamforming were jointly scheduled. The learning based traffic prediction method was studied in [25] for unmanned aerial vehicle enabled wireless communication system with rate splitting. The neural network was proposed in [26] to solve the user clustering problem in hierarchical rate splitting communication systems. Due to coupled rate and power allocation relationship, the resource allocation of RSMA usually leads to the nonconvex problem, which can be solved by utilizing the learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning. Several deep learning algorithms were designed to solve various complex resource allocation problems for RSMA, which include total power minimization problem [27], joint power control, beamforming design, and splitting optimization problem [28], [29], power allocation problem with limited channel state information knowledge [30], [31], joint transmit power, user clustering, and resource block allocation problem [32], joint passive precoding at the reconfigurable intelligent surface and active precoding at the transmitter [33]. In the federated learning frameworks [34], the authors in [35] utilized RSMA for uplink model transmission to minimize the total delay of the whole system. A modelbased deep learning algorithm was developed to solve the receiver design problem of RSMA in [36].\nRecently, semantic communication has attracted a lot of attention [37]\u2013[46]. For the wireless communication system characterized by Shannon capacity, the receiver side needs to recover the information that is exactly the same as the transmitted information. However, in the emerging wireless applications such as virtual reality, personalized healthcare, autonomous driving, and the Internet-of-Everything (IoE), the wireless communication systems aim to meet the multimodal quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements with massive data, which makes the traditional Shannon capacity characterized transmission infeasible. Especially in human-computer interaction scenarios, humans can control multiple IoE devices simultaneously through voice and augmented/virtual reality commands, making communication ubiquitous in small-range wireless networks, which poses severe challenges to traditional bit-oriented communication challenge. Supporting realtime human-machine interaction and machine-to-machine interaction through the use of text, speech, images, and augmented/virtual reality is important for future wireless communications. In order to support this interaction, the important information finally received depends mainly on the intent, rather than the bit information dependence of common sense. These applications use advanced signal processing to facilitate the development of task-oriented semantic communication [3], [47], [48]. In semantic communication, both transmitter and receiver share common knowledge, which can be used to extract small-size information at the transmitter and recover\nthe original information at the receiver [49]. Similarly, in downlink RSMA, all users also need to receive both common information and private information. Due to the inherent similarity of common knowledge and common message, RSMA can be utilized to enhance the system performance of downlink semantic communication. To our best knowledge, there is no prior works that consider the integration of semantic communication and RSMA.\nThe main contributions of this paper include:\n\u2022 The problem of wireless resource allocation and semantic\ninformation extraction for energy efficient semantic communications over wireless networks with rate splitting is investigated. In the considered model, the BS first extracts the semantic information from its large-scale data, and then transmits the small-sized semantic information to each user which recovers the original data based on the local common knowledge. \u2022 In the downlink transmission, the rate splitting scheme\nis adopted, while the private small-sized semantic information is transmitted through private message and the common knowledge is transmitted through common message. Due to limited wireless resource, both computational energy and transmission energy must be considered. This joint computation and communication problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the network under a latency constraint. \u2022 To solve this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed\nwhere, at every step, closed-form solutions for semantic information extraction ratio and computation frequency are derived. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system model and problem formulation are described in Section II. The algorithm design is presented in Section III. Simulation results are analyzed in Section IV. Conclusions are drawn in Section V."

Illustration of the considered SWC network with rate splitting.\nthe semantic information is. The link between any two vertexes represents the probability.\nTo construct the directional probability graph, we use the deep neural network to train the stored dataset, which includes three main steps. In the first step, the semantic entity is recognized from the dataset, where the semantic entity means the names in text, including person names, place names, etc. The name of semantic entity is highly open (various types, flexible lengths, unregistered words), contains rich knowledge and highlights individuality. Three common methods, i.e., rule method, taxonomy method, and sequence labeling [50] can be used to identify the semantic entity. The semantic entity is presented as a vertex in the directional probability graph. In the second step, the link between any two vertexes means the probability that one vertex can be linked with the other vertex. Through training the dataset, the probability between two vertexes can be calculated via convolutional neural networks. In the third step, the semantic information fusion is conducted. For two vertexes, if the link probabilities between these two vertexes are higher than a predefined threshold. As a result, the final directional probability graph becomes a multi-tier graph, as shown in Fig. 2.\nTo obtain the small-size semantic communication, the extraction process includes two parts, as shown in Fig. 3. In the first part, the directional probability graph is used to extract semantic information and the output is denoted by G(Dk). To efficiently transmit information, in the second part, a subset Sk out of G(Dk) is selected at user k, which is used for data transmission.\nAt the user side, each user utilizes the shared common directional probability graph to recover the original data and the recovered data is denoted by R(Sk).

            "text": "In RSMA, the message intended for each user can be split into two parts, i.e., common part and private part [51]. The common parts from all users are collected and combined into a common message. Through sharing the same codebook for all users, the common message is encoded into the common message s0, which all users need to decode. The private part of each user k is encoded into the private stream sk, which is intended for the specific user k. As a result, the transmitted signal x of the BS can be written as:\nx = \u221a p0w0s0 +\nK \u2211\nk=1\n\u221a pkwksk, (2)\nwhere w0 is the transmit beamforming of the common message s0 , wk is the transmit beamforming of the private message sk intended for user k, p0 is the transmit power of the common message s0, and pk is the transmit power of the private message sk.\n4 For user k, the received message can be represented by:\nhHk x+ nk = h H k \u221a p0w0s0 +\nK \u2211\nj=1\n\u221a pkh H k wksj + nk, (3)\nwhere hk stands for the channel between user k and the BS. To decode the common message s0, the rate of user k can be given by:\nck = B log2\n(\n1 + p0|hHk w0|2\n\u2211K j=1 pj |hHk wj |2 + \u03c32\n)\n. (4)\nwhere B is the bandwidth of the BS. Note that all users need to decode the same common message. To ensure that all users can successfully decode the common message, the rate of the common message can be set as [18]\nc0 = min k\u2208K ck. (5)\nIn our considered SWC with rate splitting, the common knowledge is shared by all users. Thus, the common knowledge required for semantic communication can be encoded in the common message. Besides, the common message also includes the parts that are allocated for different users, i.e., the rate in the common message allocated to user k is denoted by ak. As a result, the rate constraint for the common message can be given by\na0 +\nK \u2211\nk=1\nak \u2264 ck, \u2200k \u2208 K, (6)\nwhere a0 is the rate allocated to updated common knowledge that all users need to receive. In SWC, a0 represents the rate of transmitting the information of updated directional probability graph.\nFor each user, the common message is decoded first, and then the common message can be subtracted for decoding the private message. As a result, the rate for decoding the private message for user k can be calculated as\nrk = B log2\n(\n1 + pk|hHk wk|2\n\u2211K j=1,j 6=k pj |hHk wj |2 + \u03c32\n)\n. (7)"

(20c)\nProblem (20) is hard to solve because of two general difficulties. The first difficulty lies in the discrete value space of variable Sk, which leads to the discrete optimization problem and the complexity to find the optimal solution is usually extremely too high. The second difficulty is the implicit expressions of accuracy function uk(Dk,Sk) and computation functions f1k(Dk,Sk) and f2k(Dk,Sk).\nTo handle the first difficulty, we introduce the new variable,\nextraction rate \u03c1k, which is defined as\n\u03c1k = Z(Sk)\nZ(G(Dk)) . (21)\nAbsolutely, the value of \u03c1k lies in (0,1]. In the following, we use variable to replace Sk for the purpose of obtaining the insights about extraction rate.\nTo handle the second difficulty, we first analyze the trend of accuracy and computation functions. For the accuracy function, the accuracy always increases with the extraction rate since more information can be used to recover the original data, as shown in Fig. 5. As a result, the minimum accuracy constraint (20c) can be equivalent to\n\u03c1k \u2265 \u0393k, (22)\nwhere \u0393k is the minimum extraction rate satisfying uk(Dk,\u0393k) = Ak. For computation function y1k(Dk, \u03c1k) is the number of required CPU cycles for computing the\n6 information with extraction rate \u03c1k out of Dk, y1k(Dk,Sk) includes two parts. The first part is computing the directional probability graph, which can be modeled as a function only related to the size of Dk, i.e., y3k(Dk). The second part is selecting the information with extraction rate \u03c1k out from the directional probability graph. Since \u03c1k = 0 or \u03c1k = 1, the selection scheme is straightforward, which leads to the lowest computation cycles. Hence, the computation of the second part first increases and then decreases with the extraction rate \u03c1k. As an example, computation function y1k(Dk, \u03c1k) can be expressed as\ny1k(Dk, \u03c1k) = y3k(Dk) + Ck1(\u03c1k \u2212 Ck2)Ck3 , (23) where Ck1 > 0, Ck2 \u2208 (0, 1), and Ck3 > 0 are constant parameters and theses parameters can be obtained through simulations. For computation function y2k(Dk, \u03c1k), the number of computation cycles decreases with \u03c1k since more semantic information can be helpful in recovering the original information. As an example, the computation function y2k(Dk, \u03c1k) can be expressed as\ny2k(Dk, \u03c1k) = Ck4\u03c1\u2212Ck5k , (24) where Ck4 > 0 and Ck5 > 0 are constant parameters through simulations.\nWith the above variable substitution (21) and expressions\n(22)-(24), problem (20) can be reformulated as:\nmin \u03c1\nK \u2211\nk=1\n(\n\u03baf2k (y3k(Dk) + Ck1(\u03c1k \u2212 Ck2)Ck3)\n+ Z(G(Dk))pk\u03c1k\nrk + ak + \u03baCk4\u03c1\n\u2212Ck5 k g 2 k\n)\n+ K0p0 a0\n(25)\ns.t. y3k(Dk) + Ck1(\u03c1k \u2212 Ck2)Ck3\nfk\n+max\n{\nZ(G(Dk))\u03c1k rk + ak , K0 a0\n}\n+ Ck4\u03c1\n\u2212Ck5 k\ngk \u2264 T,\n\u2200k \u2208 K, (25a) \u0393k \u2264 \u03c1k \u2264 1, \u2200k \u2208 K, (25b)\nwhere \u03c1 = [\u03c11, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c1K ]T .

In problem (44), the objective function is transformed into convex. Because of nonconex constraints (44f) and (44g), problem (44) is nonconvex. In the following, we utilize the SCA method to handle these two nonconvex constraints.\nFor constraint (44f), it can be equivalent to\np2k|hHk wk|2 \u2265 \u03b3k\u03b1k, (45) K \u2211\nj=1,j 6=k\np2j |hHk wj |2 + \u03c32 \u2264 \u03b1k, (46)\nwhere \u03b1k is a nonnegative slack variable. In (45), we can always choose the term hHk wk as a real value through changing the phase of beamforming wk. Thus, constraint (45) can be rewritten as\nR(hHk wk) \u2265 \u221a \u03b3k\u03b1k\npk , (47)\nwhere the left hand side is convex now. Through using the first-order Taylor series to replace the right hand side of (47), constraint (47) can be approximated by\nR(hHk wk) \u2265\n\u221a\n\u03b3 (n) k \u03b1 (n) k\np (n) k\n+\n\u221a\n\u03b3 (n) k\n2p (n) k\n\u221a\n\u03b1 (n) k\n(\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b1(n)k )\n+\n\u221a\n\u03b1 (n) k\n2p (n) k\n\u221a\n\u03b3 (n) k\n(\u03b3k \u2212 \u03b3(n)k )\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b3 (n) k \u03b1 (n) k (p (n) k ) 2 (pk \u2212 p(n)k ), (48)\nwhere the superscript (n) means the value of the variable in the n-th iteration.

(49)\nThrough replacing the left hand side of (49) with its first-order Taylor approximation, we can obtain\nK \u2211\nj=1,j 6=k\n1\n4\n[\n((p (n) j ) 2 + |hHk w (n) j |2)2 + 4((p (n) j ) 2\n+ |hHk w (n) j |2)p (n) j (pj \u2212 p (n) j )\u2212 (p2j \u2212 |hHk wj |2)2\n+ 4((p (n) j ) 2 + |hHk w (n) j |2)(R(hHk w (n) j h H k wj)\u2212 |hHk w (n) j |2)\n]\n+ \u03c32 \u2264 \u03b1k. (50)\nSimilarly, we can introduce slack variable \u03b2k and constraint (44g) can be rewritten as:\n1 4 ((p20 + |hHk w0|2)2 \u2212 (p20 \u2212 |hHk w0|2)2)\n=p20|hHk w0|2 \u2265 \u03b2k\u03b7k = 1\n4 ((\u03b2k + \u03b7k)\n2 \u2212 (\u03b2k \u2212 \u03b7k)2), (51)\nK \u2211\nj=1\np2j |hHk wj |2 + \u03c32 \u2264 \u03b2k. (52)\nNote that we cannot make hHk w0 as real values for all k through changing the phase of w0. To handle the nonconvexity of (51), we use first-order Taylor approximation on both sides of (51), which is different from the method in [52].\n9 Considering the first-order Taylor approximation on both sides, (51) can be transformed to\n((p (n) 0 ) 2 + |hHk w (n) 0 |2)2 + 4((p (n) 0 ) 2\n+|hHk w (n) 0 |2)p (n) 0 (p0 \u2212 p (n) 0 )\u2212 (p20 \u2212 |hHk w0|2)2 +4((p (n) 0 ) 2 + |hHk w (n) 0 |2)(R(hHk w (n) 0 h H k w0)\u2212 |hHk w (n) 0 |2) \u2265(\u03b2k + \u03b7k)2 \u2212 (\u03b2(n)k \u2212 \u03b7 (n) k )(\u03b2k \u2212 \u03b7k) + (\u03b2 (n) k \u2212 \u03b7 (n) k )\n2, (53)\nFor constraint (52), we can use the similar method to handle the nonconvexity of (46). Thus, (52) can be approximated by\nK \u2211\nj=1\n1\n4\n[\n((p (n) j ) 2 + |hHk w (n) j |2)2 + 4((p (n) j ) 2\n+|hHk w (n) j |2)p (n) j (pj \u2212 p (n) j )\u2212 (p2j \u2212 |hHk wj |2)2\n+4((p (n) j ) 2 + |hHk w (n) j |2)(R(hHk w (n) j h H k wj)\u2212 |hHk w (n) j |2)\n]\n+ \u03c32 \u2264 \u03b2k. (54)\nWith the above approximations, we can approximate the nonconvex constraints (44f) and (44g) with the corresponding convex approximation terms. Thus, the original problem (44) can be approximated by the following convex one:\nmin p,a,r,w,\u03b3,\u03b1,\u03b7,\u03b2\nK \u2211\nk=1\n(\n\u03bay1k(Dk,Sk)f2k + Z(Sk)p2k rk + ak\n+ \u03bay2k(Dk,Sk)g2k ) + K0p 2 0\na0 , (55)\ns.t.

For the pathloss model between each user and the BS, we set 128.1+37.6 log10 d (d is in km) [54] and the standard deviation of shadow fading is 4 dB [52]. Furthermore, the total bandwidth of the system is B = 20 MHz and the power spectral density of the noise power is \u2212174 dBm/Hz. Unless specified otherwise, we set maximum transmit power Pmax = 30 dBm, the effective switched capacitance in local computation is \u03ba = 10\u221228, maximum local computation capacity gmax1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = gmaxK = 2 GHz. For the considered semantic information task, we consider the same parameters as in [55]. The main system parameters are summarized in Table I.\nThe proposed joint communication and computation resource allocation for SWC with RSMA is labeled as \u2018RSMA\u2019. To compare the results of the proposed scheme, we consider the conventional orthogonal multiple access, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) [56], which is labeled as \u2018FDMA\u2019, the total energy minimization problem for NOMA [57], which is labeled as \u2018NOMA\u2019. To better show the performance of multiple antenna scheme, we consider the SDMA system as in [18].\nFig. 6 illustrates that the total communication and computation energy changes as the maximum transmit power of each user varies. According to this figure, the EXH-RSMA scheme stands for the exhaustive search method, which can\n10\nyield a near globally optimal solution through running the proposed algorithm with 1000 initial solutions. It can be shown from this figure that the total energy decreases with the maximum transmit power of the BS. This is due to the fact that large transmit power can lead to low transmit time, which allows more time for computation and yields low total energy consumption. It is observed that the proposed RSMA outperforms FDMA, NOMA, since RSMA can achieve higher spectral efficiency than FDMA and NOMA. Compared to SDMA, RSMA can still achieve better energy consumption, in particular the maximum transmit power is high. The reason is that SDMA is more likely to serve the users with higher channel gains, while the users with poor channel gains tend to have long transmit time and high computation power is needed for task computation, thus leading to higher total energy consumption than RSMA. It can be also found that the proposed RSMA achieves near performance as the EXHRSMA, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\nFig. 7 shows the total energy versus bandwidth of the system. Based on this figure, the total communication and computation energy decreases as the bandwidth of the system increases for all schemes. This is because high bandwidth decreases the transmit time between users and the BS, which allows long computation time and consequently reduces the local computation energy consumption.\nFig. 8 illustrates the trend of total communication and computation energy with the transmit data size of each user. It is observed that the total energy increases as the data size for all schemes. This is due to the fact that more information needs to be transmitted, thus increasing the transmit and computation power. It can be found that the growing speed of total energy od the proposed RSMA is slower than that of NOMA and FDMA, which shows the robustness of the RSMA.\nTo show how the computation capacity affects the system performance, Fig. 9 presents the total communication and computation energy versus the maximum computation capac-\nity of each user. According to this figure, the total energy first decreases rapidly and then the total energy tends to approach a fixed value. The reason lies in that for small computation capacity region, the increase of maximum computation capacity can greatly decrease the computation time and more time can be used for transmission, thus reducing the transmit power and total energy. For high computation capacity region, each user has chosen its optimal computation capacity and the increase of maximum computation capacity does not affect the computation capacity allocation result, thus leading to stable energy consumption."

            "text": "In this paper, the problem of wireless resource allocation and semantic information extraction for energy efficient semantic communications over wireless networks with rate splitting is investigated. In the considered model, the BS first extracts the semantic information from its large-scale\n11\ndata, and then transmits the small-sized semantic information to each user which recovers the original data based on the local common knowledge. In the downlink transmission, the rate splitting scheme is adopted, while the private small-sized semantic information is transmitted through private message and the common knowledge is transmitted through common message. Due to limited wireless resource, both computational energy and transmission energy need to be considered. This joint computation and communication problem is considered as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the network under both task completion and semantic accuracy constraints. An iterative algorithm is presented to solve this problem, where at each step, the optimal solutions for semantic information extraction ratio and computation frequency are derived. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
