    "abstractText": "Dispersion relations for S-matrices and CFT correlators translate UV consistency into bounds on IR observables. In this note, we construct dispersive sum rules for 1D CFTs. We use them to prove bounds on higher-derivative couplings in weakly-coupled non-gravitational EFTs in AdS2. At the leading order in the bulk-point limit, the bounds agree with the flat-space result. We compute the leading universal effect of finite AdS radius on the bounds. Along the way, we give an explicit formula for anomalous dimensions in general higher-derivative contact Witten diagrams in AdS2.",

            "text": "One of the most powerful ideas in theoretical physics is the systematic application of universal principles, such as symmetry, causality and unitarity, to constrain observable quantities. This approach, generally referred to as the bootstrap, has led to many insights into the dynamics of quantum field theory and quantum gravity, see [1\u20135] and references therein. The precise form of observables and thus also the implementation of the bootstrap strategy depends on the global geometry of spacetime. For example, in asymptotically flat space, a relevant set of observables is the S-matrix. In asymptotically AdS space, it is the correlators of the boundary CFT. In this work, we will focus on scattering in 1+1 dimensions. We will use the conformal bootstrap in 1D CFTs to constrain scattering in QFTs in AdS2. We will also draw parallels with the analogous results about 2D S-matrices in flat space. In principle, the ultimate goal of the S-matrix bootstrap is to construct the most general Lorentz-invariant S-matrix consistent with unitarity and causality. Needless to\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nsay, the solution of this problem is currently far out of reach. On the other hand, if we only demand consistency order by order at small energy, then the complete solution is known. The solution is called low-energy effective field theory (EFT). Indeed, the purpose of low-energy EFT is to provide a parametrization of the most general S-matrix consistent at low energy [6\u20138]. The situation is similar for scattering in AdS. We can study solutions of the conformal bootstrap equations in the boundary CFT order by order in an expansion around mean field theory, i.e. free theory in AdS. Again, the most general perturbative solution of the bootstrap is parametrized by a bulk effective Lagrangian and computed using bulk Witten diagrams [9\u201311]. However, there is no guarantee that a perturbative solution of the bootstrap equations arises from a theory consistent at all energies. In other words, the set of solutions of the full bootstrap could be much smaller than the set of EFTs. Indeed, it has long been known that low-energy couplings must satisfy various inequalities if the EFT arises from a UVcomplete theory [12, 13]. Such bounds have recently received a renewed attention, see for example [14\u201320]. A central task facing the modern S-matrix and conformal bootstrap is to find the complete set of constraints on the low-energy parameters arising in fully consistent theories. A fruitful approach to deriving constraints on IR observables following from UV consistency stems from dispersion relations. Dispersion relations distill causality and unitarity into precise sum rules satisfied by the dynamical data. In flat space, dispersion relations follow from analyticity and boundedness of the S-matrix at high energy by a contour deformation in the space of complexified momenta. Recently, dispersive sum rules for the S-matrix were explored systematically in [21\u201325]. Following [21], one can introduce the arcs, which are certain integrals of the two-to-two S-matrix defined at a variable energy scale M . On one hand, the arcs are computable in terms of a low-energy EFT valid at the scale M . On the other hand, a contour deformation expresses the arcs as moments of the imaginary part of the S-matrix at energies above M . UV unitarity leads to positivity properties of these moments, yielding inequalities satisfied by the IR parameters. An interesting outcome of these inequalities is a justification of the expectation that higher-derivatives couplings in the EFT should be suppressed by inverse powers of the UV cutoff M dictated by dimensional analysis. Dispersive arguments have a natural implementation for scattering in AdS in the language of the conformal bootstrap. Indeed, causality and unitarity are deeply embedded in the conformal bootstrap. In particular, the CFT crossing equation is a statement of causality, expressing the commutativity of spacelike-separated local operators in a fourpoint function. Dispersive CFT sum rules can be derived as rigorous consequences of the CFT crossing equation in Lorentzian signature by applying suitable linear functionals to it [26, 27]. The defining property of a dispersive functional is that heavy operators enter only through the double commutator a.k.a. double discontinuity. This statement is the AdS analogue of the idea that heavy states enter the dispersive sum rules in flat space only through the imaginary part of the S-matrix. Dispersive CFT sum rules have appeared in various forms in the conformal bootstrap literature, for example as superconvergence sum rules [28], analytic extremal function-\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nals [29\u201332], or as sum rules arising in the Polyakov-Mellin approach to the conformal bootstrap [33\u201336]. In the context of CFTs in d \u2265 2 dimensions, they were studied systematically in [37]. In analogy with flat space, these sum rules can be used to prove bounds on couplings in a low-energy EFT in AdS. The bounds follow by splitting the contributions to the CFT crossing equation into those of light and heavy operators, where the separation occurs at a scaling dimension \u2206gap \u223c MRAdS. The contribution of the light operators to a dispersive sum rule defines the AdS analogue of the arc variables. These arcs can be computed in terms of an EFT in AdS assuming this EFT is valid up to the scale \u2206gap. The crossing equation relates the arcs to moments of the contribution of heavy operators to the double commutator. Positivity of these contributions then implies bounds on the arcs and hence on the IR observables. This logic was used in [38] to prove bounds on higher-derivative couplings in weakly-coupled gravitational theories in AdSD with D \u2265 4, building on the flat-space arguments of [25]. It was shown that at the leading order at large \u2206gap, the bounds are at least as strong as the corresponding bounds in flat space. In particular, there remains the logical possibility that the AdS bounds are strictly stronger than the flat space bounds. The main purpose of this note is to extend dispersive arguments to AdS2 and deduce EFT bounds in that case. We imagine placing a non-gravitational QFT in AdS2 and study it through the lens of the boundary correlators, as advocated in [39] and further explored more recently in [40]. The latter reference also derives a bound on the leading irrelevant interaction in a scalar theory. The set of boundary correlators defines what one may call a 1D CFT. While not including a stress tensor, such 1D CFT satisfies a natural extension of the higher-d conformal bootstrap equations to d = 1. The 1D conformal bootstrap is the simplest nontrivial case of the conformal bootstrap. It allows one to study the conformal bootstrap equations in the simplest possible setting and has already lead to many insights [41\u201345]. It is therefore natural to look for the analogue of dispersive bounds in this case. In particular, we will address the question of optimality of the AdS bounds by showing that at the leading order at large \u2206gap, they exactly agree with the flat-space bounds. The main difference between d > 1 and d = 1 is the absence of a transverse impact parameter space in the bulk in the latter case. This considerably simplifies kinematics, but does not limit the power of the bootstrap in constraining bulk scattering. Our central technical result is an explicit construction of dispersive sum rules Ck for 1D CFTs. These play the same role for AdS2 scattering as the spin-k subtracted dispersion relation plays for the 2D S-matrix. The construction of Ck follows the template of 1D analytic extremal functionals of [29\u201331]. Ck is defined as a weighted integral of the 1D conformal bootstrap equation. A contour deformation then shows that heavy operators enter Ck only though their double discontinuity. The parameter k controls the inverse power of \u2206 suppressing the heavy contributions. We will define the AdS2 arc variables as the contribution of operators with \u2206 < \u2206gap to the dispersive sum rule Ck. This definition makes sense without resorting to any EFT description of bulk physics. Assuming bulk physics is well-approximated by a tree-level\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nEFT valid up to scale \u2206gap, the arc variables defined by Ck compute precisely the quartic higher-derivative couplings. The logic of dispersive sum rules explained above then leads to bounds on the higherderivative couplings. The bounds are nontrivial functions of \u2206gap. This is because by placing a theory in AdS2 with finite radius, we introduce a new dimensionless parameter into the problem. \u2206gap is this parameter. We will see that in the regime \u2206gap 1, our bounds agree with the flat space results. In particular, the couplings are suppressed by the expected inverse powers of \u2206gap. Unlike in the case of higher dimensions, it will be manifest that the AdS2 bound can not be improved beyond the flat-space bound (at the leading order in 1/\u2206gap) without considering other correlation functions. We will also compute the universal leading correction to the bounds coming from finite size of AdS. The rest of this note is organized as follows. In section 2, we review dispersive arguments in the context of scattering in 2D flat space. In section 3, we review the kinematics of AdS2/CFT1, give a general construction of dispersive sum rules and construct higher-derivative contact Witten diagrams. Our main results appear in section 4, where we construct the Ck sum rules, and use them to prove bounds on higher-derivative couplings in AdS2. We conclude in section 5. Appendix A includes an explicit formula for the anomalous dimensions in higher-derivative contact Witten diagrams in AdS2.\nNote added. We are coordinating our submission with [46], which studies complementary aspects of scattering in 1+1 dimensions using the conformal bootstrap in 1D CFTs."

Particles in 1+1 dimensions do not carry spin, but can possess either bosonic or fermionic statistics. We will consider both possibilities.

The states carry the standard relativistic normalization\n\u3008q|p\u3009 = 4\u03c0E \u03b4(p\u2212 q) , (2.1)\nwhere E(p) = \u221a p2 +m2. One can define the scattering in states and out states of two identical particles |p1, p2\u3009in, |p1, p2\u3009out. They satisfy |p1, p2\u3009in = \u00b1|p2, p1\u3009in, where here and in what follows, the upper and lower sign corresponds respectively to bosons and fermions. They are normalized as tensor products of one-particle states\nin\u3008p3, p4|p1, p2\u3009in = (4\u03c0)2E1E2[\u03b4(p1 \u2212 p3)\u03b4(p2 \u2212 p4)\u00b1 \u03b4(p1 \u2212 p4)\u03b4(p2 \u2212 p3)] . (2.2)\nThe S-matrix S\u0302 is the operator carrying out states to in states\n|p1, p2\u3009in = S\u0302|p1, p2\u3009out . (2.3)\nIt is standard to write S\u0302 as follows\nS\u0302 = 1 + iT\u0302 , (2.4)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nwhere iT\u0302 is the connected amplitude.

(2.6)\nThe energy-momentum conserving delta functions in (2.5) are supported in the region (p1 = p3 and p2 = p4) or (p1 = p4 and p2 = p3). Thus two-to-two scattering is fully encoded in T (p1, p2, p1, p2). Symmetry under p1 \u2194 p2 and Lorentz invariance imply\nT (p1, p2, p1, p2) =M(s) , (2.7)\nwhere\ns = \u2212(p1 + p2)2 , t = \u2212(p1 \u2212 p4)2 = 4m2 \u2212 s , u = \u2212(p1 \u2212 p3)2 = 0 . (2.8)\nIt follows that the S-matrix elements take the form\nin\u3008p3, p4|S\u0302|p1, p2\u3009in = (4\u03c0)2E1E2[\u03b4(p1 \u2212 p3)\u03b4(p2 \u2212 p4)\u00b1 \u03b4(p1 \u2212 p4)\u03b4(p2 \u2212 p3)]S(s) , (2.9)\nwhere S(s) = 1 + iM(s)\n2 \u221a s(s\u2212 4m2) . (2.10)\nThe square root in the denominator comes from the Jacobian transforming between the two types of delta-functions. Physical scattering occurs for s \u2265 4m2 but S(s) admits an analytic continuation to the complex s-plane. The analytic continuation exhibits a pair of branch cuts for s \u2265 4m2 and s \u2264 0, corresponding to s- and t-channel scattering. The physical scattering amplitude (2.10) is the limiting value of S(s) as we approach the s-channel branch cut from Im(s) > 0. S(s) is meromorphic away from these cuts. Its poles must all be simple and are only allowed to occur for real s with 0 < s < 4m2. They correspond to bound states of the two scattered particles. Crossing symmetry is the statement that S(s) below the t-channel cut computes the physical scattering amplitude of particle-antiparticle scattering. In the rest of this note, we will assume that the scattered particles are their own antiparticles. In that case, crossing symmetry becomes the statement\nS(s) = S(4m2 \u2212 s) . (2.11)\nNote that there is no overall minus sign here even for identical fermions. The S-matrix is a unitary operator\nS\u0302\u2020S\u0302 = 1. (2.12)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nBy computing the matrix element of this identity between two-particle in states, and inserting a complete set of in states between S\u0302\u2020 and S\u0302, we recover the upper bound\n|S(s)|2 \u2264 1 (2.13)\nvalid in the physical region s \u2208 [4m2,\u221e). Using (2.10), it becomes the following statement aboutM(s)\nIm[M(s)] \u2265 |M(s)| 2 4 \u221a s(s\u2212 4m2) . (2.14)\nIn particular, Im[M(s)] > 0 for s \u2208 [4m2,\u221e) + i . Analyticity away from the real axis and the bound |S(s)| \u2264 1 for s > 4m2 imply that |S(s)| is bounded by a constant in the complex s plane, for sufficiently large |s|. Hence |M(s)| = O(|s|) as s \u2192 \u221e along any direction in the complex plane. We will only need the weaker condition\nM(s) s2 \u2192 0 as s\u2192\u221e . (2.15)"

(2.20)\nThe dispersion relation (2.17) states that Ak(M) is equal to the moment of Im[M(s)] shown on the r.h.s. of (2.19).\nThe arcs Ak(M) satisfy various inequalities as a result of UV unitarity Im[M(s)] \u2265 0. On the other hand, they can be computed using the low-energy effective field theory (EFT), provided the EFT is valid up to the scale M . In this way, dispersion relations lead to interesting bounds on the parameters of the EFT as a consequence of UV consistency.\nFor concreteness, let us assume that the tree-level approximation in the EFT is valid up to scale M . This can be made rigorous by considering a one-parameter family of Smatrices which are becoming arbitrarily weakly coupled.

            "text": "Let us discuss bounds on the arcs in more detail. Unless stated otherwise, we do not assume the validity of any specific EFT description, such as (2.21).\nFirst of all, positivity of the integrand in (2.19) immediately implies\nAk(M) > 0 for all k = 2, 4, . . . and M > 2m. (2.24)\nTo obtain more refined bounds, let us perform the change of variables\nx = M 2(M2 \u2212 4m2) s(s\u2212 4m2) (2.25)\nto arrive at\n[M2(M2 \u2212 4m2)] k 2Ak(M) = 1\u222b 0 dxx k\u22122 2 Im[M(s(x))] \u03c0 . (2.26)\nIn other words, [M2(M2 \u2212 4m2)] k 2Ak(M) are moments of a measure in the unit interval. The question of determining a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence of positive numbers to arise as moments of a measure in a compact interval is known as the Hausdorff moment problem. It has a known solution, reviewed in [21]. More generally, we can ask for the complete set of constraints on a finite subset of moments. This too has a known solution in terms of Hankel matrices [21, 22]. Here, we will confine ourselves to reviewing the complete set of bounds on a pair of arcs Ak(M), A`(M), where k, ` are positive even integers with ` > k. First, let us introduce the normalized arcs\nA\u0302k(M) \u2261 [M2(M2 \u2212 4m2)] k\u22122 2 Ak(M) A2(M) . (2.27)\nFrom (2.26), we have\nA\u0302k(M) = 1\u222b\n0\ndxw(x)x k\u22122 2 , where w(x) \u2265 0 and 1\u222b\n0\ndxw(x) = 1 . (2.28)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nClearly, 0 \u2264 A\u0302k(M) \u2264 1 for all k. Furthermore, A\u0302k(M) for a fixed k > 2 can take any value between 0 and 1 by setting w(x) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0) and varying x0. For a fixed A\u0302k(M), A\u0302`(M) must satisfy the lower and upper bounds\n[A\u0302k(M)] `\u22122 k\u22122 \u2264 A\u0302`(M) \u2264 A\u0302k(M) for ` > k . (2.29)\nThe upper bound follows from x `\u22122 2 \u2264 x k\u22122\n2 for all x \u2208 [0, 1]. The bound is sharp since it is saturated by the measure w(x) = \u03bb\u03b4(x) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b4(x\u2212 1) with varying \u03bb. On the other hand, the lower bound is saturated by the measure w(x) = \u03b4(x\u2212 x0) with varying x0. We give two proofs of the lower bound. The first proof uses the H\u00f6lder inequality\n1\u222b 0 dx|f(x)g(x)| \u2264  1\u222b 0 dx|f(x)|p  1 p  1\u222b 0 dx|g(x)|q  1 q where p, q \u2265 1 , 1 p + 1 q = 1 .\n(2.30) The lower bound follows immediately after setting\nf(x) = w(x) `\u2212k `\u22122 , g(x) = w(x) k\u22122 `\u22122 x k\u22122 2 , p = `\u2212 2 `\u2212 k , q = `\u2212 2 k \u2212 2 . (2.31)\nThe second proof of the lower bound is a direct application of Jensen\u2019s inequality. Let w(x) be a probability measure in the unit interval as above, let f(x) be a convex function and let g(x) be any (measurable) real-valued function. Jensen\u2019s inequality states\nf  1\u222b 0 dxw(x)g(x)  \u2264 1\u222b 0 dxw(x)f(g(x)) . (2.32)\nThe lower bound in (2.29) follows from this after setting\nf(x) = x `\u22122 k\u22122 , g(x) = x k\u22122 2 . (2.33)\nSince ` > k, f(x) is indeed convex as required. It is the second proof which will generalize to the AdS case. When the tree-level EFT description (2.21) is valid, the above bounds translate into bounds on the four-point couplings gk. We get the strongest bounds by choosing the largest possible M where (2.21) converges. Thus M is the mass of the lightest state not included in the EFT. Firstly, we have gk \u2265 0 for all k \u2265 2. The bound A\u0302`(M) \u2264 A\u0302k(M) for all 2 \u2264 k \u2264 ` becomes\n0 \u2264 g` gk \u2264 1 [M2(M2 \u2212 4m2)] `\u2212k 2 for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 ` . (2.34)\nThus, these ratios are bounded by inverse powers of the UV cutoff dictated by the dimensional analysis. On the other hand, the lower bound [A\u0302k(M)] `\u22122 k\u22122 \u2264 A\u0302`(M) for ` \u2265 k becomes ( g` g2 )k\u22122 \u2265 ( gk g2 )`\u22122 for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 ` , (2.35) with no M -dependence. These inequalities can be tested by performing low-energy measurements without knowing the UV cutoff M .\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8"

            "text": "We will conclude this section by a discussion of how the bounds are corrected by one-loop effects in the EFT. For simplicity, we will focus on scattering of massless particles, i.e. m = 0, and suppose that they are derivatively coupled, i.e. g0 = 0. This is automatic in the fermionic case. In the bosonic case, this set-up applies to scattering of excitations on a flux tube in three dimensions. The flux-tube theory is weakly-coupled in the limit of a large number of colors. Bootstrap of the flux-tube S-matrix at finite coupling was performed in the interesting recent papers [47, 48].\nAt one loop, the tree-level amplitude (2.21) gets corrected to\nMEFT(s) = \u221e\u2211 k=2 k even gks k + i4 \u221e\u2211 k,`=2 k,` even gkg`s k+`\u22121 for Im(s) > 0 . (2.36)\nThis can be seen most quickly from (2.14) by noting that at one loop in the EFT, the inequality becomes an equality. The expression in the lower half-plane follows fromM(s) = M(s). The upper and lower half-planes are seperated by a branch cut that now extends along the entire real axis The one-loop effects modify the expression for the arcs in terms of the low-energy couplings\nAk(M) = gk \u2212 1\n2\u03c0 \u221e\u2211 i,j=2 i,j even gigj i+ j \u2212 k \u2212 1M 2(i+j\u2212k\u22121). (2.37)\nWe would like to analyze the effect of this correction on the bounds in the space of the gk couplings. Let us focus on the first three couplings g2, g4, g6. Using the UV cutoff M , we can form the dimensionless combinations\ny4 = M4g4 g2\ny6 = M8g6 g2 . (2.38)\nThe tree-level bounds on y4, y6 derived in the previous subsection are 0 \u2264 y4 \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 y6 \u2264 1, together with\ny24 \u2264 y6 \u2264 y4 . (2.39)\nTo find the one-loop corrections to these bouds, we can use the following inequalities satisfied by the arcs A2, A4 and A6\nM4A4 \u2212A6 \u2265 0 , A6A2 \u2212A24 \u2265 0 (2.40)\nThe one-loop bounds are shown in figures 2 and 3. To produce the plots, we truncate the expansion of the arcs (2.37) to finitely many couplings gk with k = 2, 4, . . . , kmax and ask if the inequalities (2.40) are satisfied. Note that since the one-loop arcs are not homogeneous in the couplings, the bounds have a nontrivial dependence on the value of g2. As expected, for very small g2, the region differs very little from the tree-level result. The one-loop corrections weaken the tree-level bounds. Importantly, they now allow for slightly negative g4 and g6. A lower bound on g4 for g2 was found in [47, 48] using nonperturbative methods. This gives g4 \u2265 \u2212 1768 , which is saturated by the following S-matrix:\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nFigure 2.

By a 1d CFT we mean the following. The space of states is a unitary representation of the Lorentzian conformal group S\u0303O(2, 1). Each of its irreducible components gives rise to a primary operator which\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\ncan be inserted on the AdS boundary. These operators admit a standard operator product expansion and their correlators satisfy the constraints of conformal invariance, unitarity and crossing symmetry. Compared to gravitational holography, the main difference is the absence of a boundary stress tensor. However, this distinction does not preclude a successful application of the conformal bootstrap to these theories.2 Let us vary the AdS radius R while keeping the masses and couplings of the bulk theory fixed. We obtain a continuous 1-parameter family of 1d CFTs. The flat-space theory is encoded in the large-R properties of this family. If the flat space theory contains a particle of mass m, the CFT contains a primary operator of dimension \u2206 > 0, satisfying\n\u2206(\u2206\u2212 1) = m2R2 . (3.1)\nThus, \u2206 \u223c mR as R\u2192\u221e. To compare with our flat-space analysis, we will study scattering of identical particles of mass m in AdS2. When the scattered particles are bosons, we will denote their dual primary operator \u03c6, and \u03c8 when they are fermions. Two-to-two scattering is encoded in the four-point functions \u3008\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u3009, \u3008\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8\u3009.

(3.2)\nThe operators of the dual 1d CFT live on the boundary y = 0 and are parametrized by the Euclidean coordinate x.

The general form of a dispersive functional is\n\u03c9[G] = \u00b112\n1 2 +i\u221e\u222b\n1 2\ndzf(z)G(z)\u00b1 12\n1 2\u2212i\u221e\u222b\n1 2\ndzf(z)G(z) + 1\u222b\n1 2\ndz g (z)G(z) + 0\u222b\n1 2\ndz g (1\u2212 z)G(z) .\n(3.21) 3For example, \u03c9 can be a linear combination of derivatives of odd order at z = 1/2, which is the standard choice in the numerical conformal bootstrap. 4From now on, we will treat the bosonic and fermionic cases in parallel, but will only give explicit formulas for bosons, unless the fermionic case is different.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nf(z)\ng(z)\nf(z)\ng(1\u2212 z)\nz = 1z = 0\nFigure 5. The contours defining the general dispersive functional (3.21).\nThe contours are shown in figure 5. The top and bottom sign applies respectively to bosons and fermions. f(z), g(z) are a pair of kernels related as follows\ng(z) = (1\u2212 z) 2\u2206\u03c6\u22122f ( z z\u22121 ) (bosons) (1\u2212 z)2\u2206\u03c8\u22122f (\nz z\u22121\n) (fermions) .\n(3.22)\nf(z) is holomorphic away from a branch cut at z \u2208 [0, 1] and satisfies the symmetry\nf(z) = f(1\u2212 z) (3.23)\nas well as the identity\nz2\u2206\u03c6\u22122f (1 z ) + (1\u2212 z)2\u2206\u03c6\u22122f ( 1 1\u2212 z ) + Re[f(z)] = 0 (bosons)\nz2\u2206\u03c8\u22122f (1 z ) + (1\u2212 z)2\u2206\u03c8\u22122f ( 1 1\u2212 z ) \u2212 Re[f(z)] = 0 (fermions)\n(3.24)\nfor z \u2208 (0, 1). The logic behind (3.21) and properties (3.22), (3.23) and (3.24) is the following. Firstly, symmetry (3.23) guarantees that the functional is antisymmetric under crossing, i.e. \u03c9[G(z)] = \u2212\u03c9[G(1\u2212 z)] as required. Secondly, the identities (3.22) and (3.24) guarantee that the action of \u03c9 on a general function G(z) can be written as an integral of dDiscG weighted by f(z)\n\u03c9[G] = 0\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndzf(z) dDiscG(z) . (3.25)\nThis can be shown by deforming the vertical contours in (3.21) to the left-hand branch cut. In particular, the action on the conformal blocks is\n\u03c9[G\u2206\u03c6\u2206 ] = 2 sin 2 [\u03c0 2 (\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c6) ] \u222b 0 \u2212\u221e dzf(z) G\u0302 \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 (z) (bosons)\n2 cos2 [ \u03c0 2 (\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c8) ] \u222b 0 \u2212\u221e dzf(z) G\u0302 \u2206\u03c8 \u2206 (z) (fermions) ,\n(3.26)\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nwhere G\u0302\u2206\u03c6\u2206 is a transformed conformal block defined in (3.19). The integral converges for all \u2206 > \u2206\u2217, manifesting the fact that \u03c9 is dispersive. The value of \u2206\u2217 depends on the strength of the singularity of f(z) at z = 0."

            "text": "An important quantity attached to a dispersive functional is its Regge spin k. We say that the functional (3.21) has Regge spin k if f(z) \u223c b z\u2212k as z \u2192 i\u221e for some b 6= 0. Similarly, we say that a four-point function G(z) has Regge spin J if\nG(z) \u223c b zJ\u22121 as z \u2192 i\u221e (3.27)\nfor some b 6= 0. The reason for this terminology is that the limit z \u2192 i\u221e is analogous to the u-channel Regge limit of four-point functions in d > 1 CFTs. When G(z) arises from a d > 1 correlator by restricting the operators to lie on a line, then z \u2192 i\u221e is literally the u-channel Regge limit. In that case, the notion of the Regge spin defined here agrees with the standard notion of Regge spin in d > 1. Let \u03c9 be a functional of Regge spin k and G(z) a crossing-symmetric four-point function of Regge spin J . If k > J , then \u03c9 can be swapped with the conformal block expansion of G(z) and we get the sum rule (3.20). Nonperturbative four-point functions in unitary theories satisfy J \u2264 1, so only functionals of Regge spin k > 1 generally lead to valid sum rules. Note that since f(z) = f(1 \u2212 z), the Regge spin of the dispersive functional (3.21) is always an even integer. Requiring the swapping property with physical correlators then restricts the possible values of k to positive even integers. The Regge spin of a dispersive functional translates to a specific power-law suppression of its action on heavy conformal blocks. Let \u03c9 be a functional of the form (3.21) such that f(z) \u223c b \u00b7 z\u2212k as z \u2192 i\u221e for some b 6= 0. The leading asymptotics of its action reads\npMFT\u2206 \u03c9[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] 2 sin2 [ \u03c0 2 (\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c6) ] \u223c b \u00b7 2 \u0393(2\u2206\u03c6 + k \u2212 1)2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6)2 \u22061\u22122k as \u2206\u2192\u221e . (3.28) We multiplied the action by pMFT\u2206 , which is the density of squared OPE coefficients in mean field theory\npMFT\u2206 = \u0393(\u2206)2\u0393(\u2206 + 2\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 1)\n\u0393(2\u2206\u2212 1)\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6)2\u0393(\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c6 + 1) . (3.29)\nIt is known that the asymptotic OPE density of heavy operators must be equal to that of mean field theory on average [51, 52]. It follows that the heavy contributions to the sum rule (3.20) generally go like the power law \u22061\u22122k at large \u2206. Thus, the sum rule is convergent only if k > 1, as anticipated. It will be convenient to define the heavy density \u03c9[\u2206] associated to the functional \u03c9 as the l.h.s. of (3.28)\n\u03c9[\u2206] = pMFT\u2206 \u03c9[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] 2 sin2 [ \u03c0 2 (\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c6) ] = pMFT\u2206 0\u222b \u2212\u221e dzf(z) G\u0302\u2206\u03c6\u2206 (z) . (3.30)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nThe contribution of operators with \u2206 > \u2206gap to the sum rule (3.20) is then\n\u03c9|UV = \u2211\n\u2206O>\u2206gap\n(c\u03c6\u03c6O)2\npMFT\u2206O 2 sin2\n[ \u03c0 2 (\u2206O \u2212 2\u2206\u03c6) ] \u03c9[\u2206O] . (3.31)\nThe definition of \u03c9[\u2206] for fermionic functionals is the same, with cos instead of sin. The preceding discussion can be conveniently extended to a systematic expansion around the Regge limit by introducing the Regge moments. Following [38], we define the kth Regge moment of G(z) as the weighted integral of dDiscG(z)\n\u03a0k[G] = 1\u222b\n0\nd\u03c1\u03c1k\u22122dDiscG(z(\u03c1)) . (3.32)\nHere \u03c1 is the standard u-channel rho-coordinate [49], which is related to z as follows\n\u03c1(z) = 1 ( \u221a \u2212z + \u221a 1\u2212 z)2 , z(\u03c1) = \u2212(1\u2212 \u03c1) 2 4\u03c1 . (3.33)\nAny dispersive functional \u03c9 of Regge spin k has a formal expansion in the Regge moments\n\u03a0k, \u03a0k+2 ,\u03a0k+4, . . . . (3.34)\nTo see this, note that the measure f(z)dz of the dispersive functional (3.25) can be expanded in the Regge moment measures \u03c1k\u22122d\u03c1\nf(z)dz = \u221e\u2211 n=0 bn \u03c1 k+2n\u22122d\u03c1 , (3.35)\nwhich is just the Taylor series around the Regge limit z = \u2212\u221e. Since f(z) = f(1 \u2212 z), only even moments appear. The expansion of \u03c9 into Regge moments encodes the large-\u2206 asymptotics of the heavy action \u03c9[\u2206]\n\u03c9[\u2206] = N\u22121\u2211 n=0 bn \u03a0k+2n[\u2206] +O(\u22061\u22122k\u22124N ) as \u2206\u2192\u221e . (3.36)\nIt is important to stress that \u03a0k is not a genuine functional, i.e. it does not give rise to an exact sum rule. This is because the kernel f(z) corresponding to \u03a0k does not satisfy the functional equation (3.24). However, we will see that \u03a0k can be approximated using genuine functionals to arbitrarily high order around the Regge limit, effectively inverting the expansion (3.36).\n3.5 AdS2 contact diagrams from Mellin space\nThe flat-space dispersive sum rules Ck were chosen to be dual to the flat-space contact diagrams with amplitudes Mk(s) = [s(s \u2212 4m2)] k 2 . One of our main goals is to construct analogous CFT1 sum rules which are dual to the corresponding contact diagrams in AdS2. These diagrams were analyzed previously in the nice paper [53]. Here we will review the constructions and OPE of these diagrams.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nAdS2 contact diagrams are precisely the four-point functions which are crossing-symmetric and admit an OPE of the form\nD(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 [\u03b4anG\u2206n(z) + an\u03b3n\u2202\u2206G\u2206n(z)] , (3.37)\nwith the anomalous dimensions \u03b3n bounded by a power of n. Here an are the squared OPE coefficients in mean field theory, i.e. an = 2pMFT\u2206n , where p MFT \u2206 is the OPE density of mean field theory, given in (3.29). The formula an = 2pMFT\u2206n applies also for fermions after the substitution \u2206\u03c6 \u2192 \u2206\u03c8 and \u2206n = 2\u2206\u03c8 + 2n+ 1. We will define Dk(z) to be the contact diagram that goes like spin k in the Regge limit. For bosons, Dk(z) corresponds to the bulk interaction with four \u03a6s and 2k derivatives, i.e. (\u03a6\u2202k\u03a6)2, where k = 0, 2, 4, . . . . For fermions, it corresponds to an interaction with four \u03a8s and 2(k\u2212 1) derivatives, i.e. (\u03a8\u2202k\u22121\u03a8)2, and we have k = 2, 4, 6, . . . . As k ranges over these values, Dk(z) produces a complete set of contact diagrams. Saying that Dk(z) goes like spin k leaves the ambiguity of adding linear combinations of contact diagrams with smaller k. We will fix this ambiguity by demanding\nDBk (z) : \u03b3n = 0 for all n = 0, . . . , k\n2 \u2212 1\nDFk (z) : \u03b3n = 0 for all n = 0, . . . , k 2 \u2212 2 . (3.38)\nThese conditions correspond to the fact thatMk(s) = [s(s\u22124m2)] k 2 has a zero of order k/2 at the threshold s = 4m2. Finally, we will fix the overall normalization of Dk by demanding it goes to Mk(s) in the bulk-point limit n \u2192 \u221e. At large n, the energy squared of the intermediate bulk state goes like R2s \u223c 4n2. At the same time, the scattering phase shift is related to the anomalous dimensions through the formula\nS(s) = 1 + iM(s) 2 \u221a s(s\u2212 4m2) \u223c e\u2212i\u03c0\u03b3n . (3.39)\nIt follows that the anomalous dimension dual to the interaction gkMk(s) go like\n\u03b3n \u223c \u2212gkR2\u22122k 22k\u22123\n\u03c0 n2k\u22122 as n\u2192\u221e . (3.40)\nThus, we will normalize Dk to satisfy \u03b3n \u223c \u2212(22k\u22123/\u03c0)n2k\u22122 as n\u2192\u221e. Note that in this argument, we are not taking the flat space limit R \u2192 \u221e but rather the bulk-point limit n\u2192\u221e at fixed AdS radius. Contact diagrams DBk (z), DFk (z) satisfying these properties can be conveniently represented as Mellin integrals. The general Mellin representation of bosonic AdS2 contact diagrams takes the form\nDB(z) = \u222b\u222b\nds dt (4\u03c0i)2 u s 2\u2212\u2206\u03c6v t 2\u2212\u2206\u03c6\u0393\n( \u2206\u03c6 \u2212\ns 2\n)2 \u0393 (\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 t 2\n)2 \u0393 (\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 u 2\n)2 MB(s, t) ,\n(3.41)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nwhere we restrict to 1D CFT kinematics u = z2, v = (1\u2212 z)2. The Mellin variables satisfy s + t + u = 4\u2206\u03c6. The Mellin amplitude MB(s, t) is a polynomial satisfying\nMB(s, t) = MB(t, s) = MB(s, u) . (3.42)\nThe first equality ensures that DB(z) is crossing symmetric, and the second one ensures it only contains double-trace dimension \u2206Bn in its OPE (otherwise, it would also contain conformal blocks with dimensions 2\u2206\u03c6 + n with n odd). There is no problem with using the two-variable Mellin representation (3.41) to describe 1D correlators, which only depend on a single cross-ratio. The absence of a unique inversion D(z) 7\u2192M(s, t) is of no concern here since we only use (3.41) as a convenient representation of D(z).\nThe Mellin amplitude which gives rise to the contact diagram DBk (z) is\nMBk (s, t) = cBk (\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 s 2 ) k 2 ( \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 t 2 ) k 2 ( \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 u 2 ) k 2 . (3.43)\nThe Pochhammer symbols ensure the vanishing of the first k/2 anomalous dimensions as required by (3.38). cBk is a normalization ensuring the correct flat-space limit\ncBk = (\u22121) k 2\n24\u2206\u03c6+3k\u22125\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6 + k \u2212 1)\u0393 ( 2\u2206\u03c6 + 3k2 \u2212 1 2 ) \u03c03/2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6)2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6 + 2k \u2212 1) . (3.44)\nIn AdS2, the amplitude MBk (s, t) gives rise to a contact diagram with 2k derivatives. This is in contrast with AdSD>2, where it would have 3k derivatives. The difference is explained by noting that the Mandelstam variable u vanishes in 2D flat space and therefore the last factor in (3.43) does not contribute to the bulk mass dimension in D = 2. Fermionic contact diagrams can be treated almost identically. Their general Mellin representation reads DF(z) = \u222b\u222b\nds dt (4\u03c0i)2 u s 2\u2212\u2206\u03c8v t 2\u2212\u2206\u03c8\u0393\n( \u2206\u03c8 +\n1\u2212 s 2\n)2 \u0393 ( \u2206\u03c8 + 1\u2212 t\n2\n)2 \u0393 ( \u2206\u03c8 + 1\u2212 u\n2\n)2 MF(s, t) ,\n(3.45) where u = z2, v = (1 \u2212 z)2 and MF(s, t) = MF(t, s) = MF(s, u). The Mellin amplitude giving rise to DFk (z) reads\nMFk (s, t) = cFk ( \u2206\u03c8 + 1\u2212 s\n2 ) k\u22122\n2\n( \u2206\u03c8 +\n1\u2212 t 2 ) k\u22122\n2\n( \u2206\u03c8 +\n1\u2212 u 2 ) k\u22122\n2\n, (3.46)\nwith normalization\ncFk = (\u22121) k 2 +1\n24\u2206\u03c8+3k\u22125\u0393(2\u2206\u03c8 + k \u2212 1)\u0393 ( 2\u2206\u03c8 + 3k2 \u2212 1 2 ) \u03c03/2(2\u2206\u03c8 + k \u2212 1)\u0393(2\u2206\u03c8)2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c8 + 2k \u2212 2) . (3.47)\nIn appendix A, we give closed formulas for the anomalous dimension \u03b3n of the contact diagrams DBk (z) and DFk (z) for general k, n.

            "text": "Let us now explain how to construct the dispersive functionals Ck, which will play the same role for AdS2 scattering as the S-matrix sum rules Ck play in flat space. Thus Ck should have Regge spin k and satisfy\nCBk \u3008DBk\u2032\u3009 = \u2212\u03b4kk\u2032 , CFk \u3008DFk\u2032\u3009 = \u2212\u03b4kk\u2032 . (4.1)\nHere the notation \u03c9\u3008G\u3009 means that we expand G using the OPE and swap the sum over conformal blocks with the action of \u03c9. Thus in general we have \u03c9\u3008G\u3009 6= 0 even if G is crossing symmetric, since \u03c9 may not commute with the OPE of G. Since Ck has Regge spin k and Dk\u2032 has Regge spin k\u2032, it follows that Ck\u3008Dk\u2032\u3009 = 0 automatically for k > k\u2032, but not for k \u2264 k\u2032. To construct Ck satisfying the above properties, we can proceed as follows. In [31], it was shown that there is a basis for the space of functionals for the 1D crossing equation (3.9), consisting of dispersive functionals \u03b1n, \u03b2n. These functionals are dual to the double trace conformal blocks and their derivatives. In the bosonic case, this means\n\u03b1Bm[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206Bn ] = \u03b4mn \u03b2Bm[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206Bn ] = 0\n\u03b1Bm[\u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206Bn ] = 0 \u03b2Bm[\u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206Bn\n] = \u03b4mn , (4.2)\nwhere we use the notation \u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206Bn = (\u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 )|\u2206=\u2206Bn . Similarly, in the fermionic case, we have \u03b1Fm[G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206Fn ] = \u03b4mn \u03b2Fm[G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206Fn ] = 0\n\u03b1Fm[\u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206Fn ] = 0 \u03b2Fm[\u2202\u2206G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206Fn\n] = \u03b4mn . (4.3)\nThe functionals \u03b1Bn and \u03b2Bn have Regge spin k = 0 while \u03b1Fn and \u03b2Fn have Regge spin k = 2. We will construct CBk and CFk as finite linear combinations of the \u03b2n functionals\nCBk = k 2\u2211\nn=0 xBk,n\u03b2 B n , C F k =\nk\u22122 2\u2211 n=0 xFk,n\u03b2 F n . (4.4)\nThe expansion coefficients xBk,n, xFk,n are uniquely fixed by the conditions (4.1). For example, the k = k\u2032 conditions imply\nxBk,k/2 = \u2212 1\naBk/2\u03b3 B k/2\n, xFk,(k\u22122)/2 = \u2212 1\naF(k\u22122)/2\u03b3 F (k\u22122)/2\n, (4.5)\nwhere \u03b3Bk/2 is the first nonvanishing anomalous dimension of D B k , and \u03b3F(k\u22122)/2 the first nonvanishing anomalous dimension of DFk . The remaining xk,n can be fixed by demanding (4.1) for k\u2032 < k, or equivalently by demanding that Ck has spin k in the Regge limit, i.e. f(z) = O(z\u2212k). In both cases, the number of constraints equals the number of unknowns, and there is a unique solution.

CBk exists for k = 0, 2, 4, . . . but only gives a nonperturbatively valid functional for k > 0. On the other hand CFk only exists for k = 2, 4, 6, . . . . We will present the explicit construction of CBk and CFk using the f(z) kernel appearing in (3.21). Let fBk (z) and fFk (z) be the kernels defining CBk and CFk . We found fBk (z) = 2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6)2\u0393(\u2206\u03c6 + k\u221212 )\u0393(\u2206\u03c6 + k+ 1 2)\n\u03c0\u0393(2\u2206\u03c6 + k\u2212 1)2 1\u2212 2z [z(z\u2212 1)] k+1 2 \u00d7\n\u00d7 {\n3F\u03032 ( \u2212k+ 12 , k+ 3 2 , 2\u2206\u03c6 + 3k\u2212 3 2 ; \u2206\u03c6 + k\u2212 1 2 ,\u2206\u03c6 + k+ 1 2; 1 4z(1\u2212 z) ) +\n+3(k+ 1)(k+ 3)16z(z\u2212 1) 3F\u03032 ( \u2212k\u2212 12 , k+ 5 2 , 2\u2206\u03c6 + 3k\u2212 1 2 ; \u2206\u03c6 + k+ 1 2 ,\u2206\u03c6 + k+ 3 2; 1 4z(1\u2212 z) )} (4.6)\nand\nfFk (z) = 2\u0393(2\u2206\u03c8)2\u0393(\u2206\u03c8 + k2 )\u0393(\u2206\u03c8 + k) \u03c0\u0393(2\u2206\u03c8 + k\u2212 1)2 1\u2212 2z [z(z\u2212 1)] k+1 2 \u00d7\n\u00d7 {\n3F\u03032 ( \u2212k\u2212 12 , k+ 1 2 , 2\u2206\u03c8 + 3k\u2212 3 2 ; \u2206\u03c8 + k 2 ,\u2206\u03c8 + k; 1 4z(1\u2212 z) ) +\n+3(k\u2212 1)(k+ 1)16z(z\u2212 1) 3F\u03032 ( \u2212k\u2212 32 , k+ 3 2 , 2\u2206\u03c8 + 3k\u2212 1 2 ; \u2206\u03c8 + k+ 2 2 ,\u2206\u03c8 + k+ 1; 1 4z(1\u2212 z) )} .\n(4.7) Here 3F\u03032 is the regularized hypergeometric function. These formulas are valid for z < 0 and are extended from there by analytic continuation. The analytic continuation satisfies f(z) = f(1 \u2212 z) as required. These results generalize the construction of CF2 \u223c \u03b2F0 , given in [30]. In practice, the formulas were found in the same manner as the f(z) kernel for \u03b2F0 was found in [30]. Namely, we first constructed f(z) for many discrete values of \u2206\u03c6 \u2208 N and \u2206\u03c8 \u2208 N + 12 by explitly solving the constraints. Next, we performed a Mellin transform of f(z) and noticed that it admits a simple analytic continuation to general \u2206\u03c6, \u2206\u03c8. Formulas (4.6), (4.7) were then obtained by the inverse Mellin transform. See [30] for more details. One can check a posteriori that (4.6) and (4.7) satisfy all the constraints.\nAn important property of fBk (z) and fFk (z) is positivity\nfBk (z) > 0 and fFk (z) > 0 for all z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0) . (4.8)\nWe expect this to be valid for all \u2206\u03c6,\u2206\u03c8 > 0 and all k \u2265 2. Although we have not found a general proof of positivity, we were able to verify it by numerically computing the kernels in many cases, and also by observing positivity of coefficients in their Taylor expansion around z = \u221e. A direct consequence of positivity of f(z) is positivity of action of Ck on heavy conformal blocks. Indeed, it follows from (3.26) and f(z) > 0 that\nCBk [G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] \u2265 0 for all \u2206 \u2265 2\u2206\u03c6 + k CFk [G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206 ] \u2265 0 for all \u2206 \u2265 2\u2206\u03c6 + k \u2212 1 .\n(4.9)\nIn summary, CBk [G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] has simple zeros at \u2206 = 2\u2206\u03c6 + 2n for all 0 \u2264 n \u2264 k/2, double zeros on all higher double traces, and is nonnegative for \u2206 \u2265 2\u2206\u03c6 + k. Similarly, CFk [G \u2206\u03c8 \u2206 ] has\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nsimple zeros at \u2206 = 2\u2206\u03c8 + 2n + 1 for all 0 \u2264 n \u2264 (k \u2212 2)/2, double zeros on all higher double traces, and is nonnegative for \u2206 \u2265 2\u2206\u03c8 + k \u2212 1. In many applications, such as to prove the bounds at large \u2206gap later in this section, it is sufficient to use positivity of f(z) at the leading order as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, which is manifestly true in (4.6) and (4.7).\n4.2 AdS2 arcs\nHaving defined functionals Ck, we can proceed in parallel with the flat-space discussion of section 2.2. The application of Ck to the OPE of a crossing-symmetric correlator leads to the sum rule\n\u2212 Ck|IR = Ck|UV . (4.10)\nHere Ck|IR = \u2211 \u2206O<\u2206gap (c\u03c6\u03c6O)2Ck[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206O ]\nCk|UV = \u2211\n\u2206O\u2265\u2206gap (c\u03c6\u03c6O)2Ck[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206O ] .\n(4.11)\n\u2206gap is a scaling dimension defining the split between what we call light and heavy operators. It is related to the scale M of section 2.2 by M2R2 = \u2206gap(\u2206gap \u2212 1). We demand \u2206gap > 2\u2206\u03c6+k so that (3.26) converges for all \u2206 \u2265 \u2206gap, i.e. Ck[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] \u2265 0 for all \u2206 \u2265 \u2206gap and Ck[G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] has double zeros on all double-trace dimensions above \u2206gap. It is now natural to define the AdS2 analogue of the arc variables Ak(M) as minus the IR contribution to the Ck sum rule\nABk (\u2206gap) = \u2212 \u2211\n\u2206O<\u2206gap (c\u03c6\u03c6O)2CBk [G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206O ] . (4.12)\nThe arcs ABk (\u2206gap) of any unitary solution to the 1d bootstrap equation (3.9) satisfy various bounds as a result of the dispersive sum rule (4.10) and positivity of the UV contributions. Before discussing these bounds in detail, let us explain how ABk (\u2206gap) can be computed in terms of an EFT in AdS2. Let us assume that the physics up to scale \u2206gap is captured by an EFT containing a single bulk scalar field \u03a6 dual to a boundary primary operator \u03c6. This means that the only primary states with dimensions \u2206 < \u2206gap are the identity, and multitrace operators built out of \u03c6 and derivatives. Furthermore, if the EFT is weakly-coupled up to scale \u2206gap, the \u03c6\u00d7\u03c6 OPE has a simple structure. At the zeroth order in the coupling, it contains only the identity and double-trace operators [\u03c6\u03c6]n with dimensions 2\u2206\u03c6 + 2n. At the first order, the double traces acquire anomalous dimensions and anomalous OPEs. The most general tree-level four-point function is a combination of bulk contact diagrams DBk , discussed in section 3.5\nGB(z)|tree = \u221e\u2211 k=0 k even gkDBk (z) . (4.13)\nIt follows directly from the definition of the Ck functionals (4.1) that at tree-level\nABk (\u2206gap) = gk , (4.14)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nprovided \u2206gap > 2\u2206\u03c6 + k. In other words, the arc extracts the bulk four-point coupling gk. At one-loop, the arc (4.12) receives contributions linear in one-loop anomalous dimensions, as well as quadratic in the tree-level anomalous dimensions. The latter come from expanding CBk [G \u2206\u03c6 \u2206 ] to the second order around the double zeros at \u2206 = 2\u2206\u03c6 + 2n. In flat space, these correspond to the imaginary part of M(s) for 4m2 < s < M2, which indeed appears at one loop. Even at finite coupling, (4.12) is a well-defined expression for the AdS arc in terms of quantities measurable by an observer who has access to bulk physics up to energy \u2206gap/R. Let us conclude this subsection by giving a formula for the action of a general dispersive functional \u03c9 on a general tree-level correlator G(z). Thus, let \u03c9 be given by (3.21) and let G(z) be a crossing-symmetric combination of contact and exchange Witten diagrams. This means that \u03c9\u3008G\u3009 only receives contributions from the finitely-many double-traces where \u03c9 does not have a double zero, as well as from the finitely-many single-trace operators coming from exchange diagrams. By deforming the contour in the z-plane from the lefthand branch cut to the right-hand branch cut, we get\n\u03c9\u3008G\u3009 = \u2212\u03c9\u3008G\u3009 \u00b1 2\u03c0i[f(z)G(z)]z\u22121 , (4.15)\nwhere the second term on the r.h.s. is the contribution from the residue at z = i\u221e and the upper and lower sign corresponds to bosons and fermions. Notation [f(z)G(z)]z\u22121 means the coefficient of z\u22121 as z \u2192\u221e in the upper half-plane. Thus,\n\u03c9\u3008G\u3009 = \u00b1i\u03c0[f(z)G(z)]z\u22121 . (4.16)\nThis formula is the AdS analogue of evaluating the tree-level contributions to the flat-space arc (2.18) as a residue at s =\u221e. In particular, we must have\ni\u03c0[fBk (z)DBk\u2032(z)]z\u22121 = \u2212\u03b4kk\u2032 , i\u03c0[fFk (z)DFk\u2032(z)]z\u22121 = \u03b4kk\u2032 , (4.17)\nwhich is a nontrivial statement about the z \u2192 i\u221e expansion of the contact diagrams. It is also immediate from (4.16) that tree-level couplings of \u03a6 to other light matter fields do not contribute to the arcs. This is because exchange Witten diagrams in AdS2 have Regge spin 0, and thus the residue (4.16) vanishes."

One can check that the expansion proceeds in inverse powers of the Casimir \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 1). While CBk [\u2206] and CFk [\u2206] agree with each other to the order shown here, they differ already at the next order. At the leading order as \u2206 \u2192 \u221e, CBk and CFk exactly agree with the flat-space sum rules Ck.

We see that the bound agrees with the flat-space bound (2.34) at the leading order in the bulk-point limit. The subleading order in (4.27) constitutes a universal correction coming from the finite size of AdS. We expect that (4.25) exactly reproduces (2.34) at finite M and m by taking the flat-space limit \u2206\u03c6,\u2206gap \u2192 \u221e, with \u2206\u03c6/\u2206gap = m/M .

We can also derive the AdS version of the flat-space bound (2.35). To do that, note that the dispersive sum rules can be stated as\ngk g2\n= \u221e\u222b\n\u2206gap\nd\u2206w(\u2206)C\u0302k[\u2206] , where w(\u2206) \u2265 0 and \u221e\u222b\n\u2206gap\nd\u2206w(\u2206) = 1 , (4.28)\nwhere C\u0302k[\u2206] = Ck[\u2206]/C2[\u2206].

This was done by constructing a set of CFT functionals Ck, labelled by their Regge spin k. When we apply functional Ck to a tree-level correlator in AdS2, it extracts the bulk coupling of (\u03a6\u2202k\u03a6)2 in the bosonic case and (\u03a8\u2202k\u22121\u03a8)2 in the fermionic case.\nThe action of the dispersive functionals Ck on a general 1D CFT correlator is given by\nCk[G] = 0\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ndzfk(z) dDiscG(z) , (5.1)\nwhere the kernels fk(z) appear in (4.6) and (4.7). This formula demonstrates that the functionals are dispersive, i.e. that they compute moments of the double commutator. If we assume that the bulk theory is described by an EFT up to scale \u2206gap, the application of Ck to the conformal bootstrap equation relates the bulk higher-derivative couplings to positive averages of the heavy OPE density for \u2206 > \u2206gap, weighted by sin2[\u03c02 (\u2206\u2212 2\u2206\u03c6)]\u2206\n\u22122k at large \u2206, see (4.22). This leads to bounds on ratios of the higherderivative couplings depending on \u2206gap. As \u2206gap \u2192 \u221e, these bounds reproduce the flat space bounds following from unitarity and causality of the S-matrix. We computed the first subleading correction to the bounds at large \u2206gap, coming from the finite size of AdS, see (4.27) and (4.31). We conclude by several suggestions for further work. We have studied the bounds in the bulk-point limit \u2206gap \u2192\u221e at fixed \u2206\u03c6. This corresponds to high-energy scattering in AdS of finite size. It would be interesting to consider also the flat-space limit \u2206gap,\u2206\u03c6 \u2192\u221e at fixed \u2206\u03c6/\u2206gap = m/M . We expect that in this limit, the AdS bound (4.25) will exactly reproduce the flat-space bound (2.34) and the leading correction away from the flat space limit should be computable.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 8\nIt would also be interesting to come up with a more conceptual derivation of the dispersive kernels fk(z) given in (4.6) and (4.7). In higher dimensions, dispersive sum rules arise by integrating the crossing equation along a pair of null rays. While there are no null rays in 1D CFTs, there are null rays in AdS2. Could the relatively complicated formulas for fk(z) admit a simple representation as integrals in AdS2? In a similar spirit, dispersion relations in higher-dimensional CFTs take a simple form in Mellin space [34, 36, 37]. Can the Mellin space derivation be extended to 1D CFTs?"

            "text": "One can find the anomalous dimensions of the contact diagrams (\u03a6\u2202k\u03a6)2 and (\u03a8\u2202k\u22121\u03a8)2, starting from their Mellin representations (3.41), (3.45) as follows. First, we close the s contour to the right, picking terms proportional to log(z) from the double poles at s = 2\u2206\u03c6 + 2n. For each residue, the remaining integral over t can be evaluated in terms of a 2F1 hypergeometric function. The final step is to reorgranize the sum over n in terms of 1D conformal blocks to read off the anomalous dimensions. By computing \u03b3n in this manner explicitly in many examples, we were able to guess the formula for \u03b3n of a general contact diagram.
