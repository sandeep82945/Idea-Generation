 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions between gravity-capillary and sloshing modes in a torus of fluid:

1. Further investigate the theoretical modeling of the interaction between the gravity-capillary and sloshing modes. The authors mention the interaction coefficients are unknown, so deriving these could allow more quantitative predictions. 

2. Explore how the efficiency of energy transfer depends on parameters like the torus dimensions, fluid properties, and forcing amplitude/frequency. This could uncover ways to optimize the energy transfer.

3. Study if similar two-branch interactions occur for other wave modes besides gravity-capillary and sloshing, such as Rossby waves. This could demonstrate the generality of the mechanism. 

4. Examine if analogous three-wave interactions can happen in other nonlinear wave systems like optics, plasmas, or quantum fluids. This could show the phenomenon has broad relevance.

5. Analyze the long-term statistical properties and dynamics of the wave turbulence generated by the cascading three-wave interactions. This could connect to wave turbulence theory for an atypical excitation mechanism.
