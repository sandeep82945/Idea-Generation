"Limitations Despite establishing a new state-of-the-art, DreamAvatar encounters limitations: (1) Animation was not considered in our current implementation of DreamAvatar; (2) The model inherits biases from the pretrained diffusion model due to the text-image data distribution, such that performance on more frequently appeared subjects in the pretraining data may be better than the others."
