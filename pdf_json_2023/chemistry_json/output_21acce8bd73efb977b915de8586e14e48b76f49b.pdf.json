    "abstractText": "Ceratocystis fimbriata (C. fimbriata) is a notorious pathogenic fungus that causes sweet potato black rot disease. The APSES transcription factor Swi6 in fungi is located downstream of the cell wall integrity (CWI)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and has been identified to be involved in cell wall integrity and virulence in several filamentous pathogenic fungi. However, the specific mechanisms by which Swi6 regulates the growth and pathogenicity of plant pathogenic fungi remain elusive. In this study, the SWI6 deletion mutants and complemented strains of C. fimbriata were generated. Deletion of Swi6 in C. fimbriata resulted in aberrant growth patterns. Pathogenicity assays on sweet potato storage roots revealed a significant decrease in virulence in the mutant. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis using LC-MS identified a total of 692 potential differentially accumulated metabolites (PDAMs) in the \u2206Cfswi6 mutant compared to the wild type, and the results of KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of PDAMs within various metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, GPI-anchored protein synthesis, and ABC transporter metabolism. These metabolic pathways were believed to play a crucial role in mediating the growth and pathogenicity of C. fimbriata through the regulation of CWI. Firstly, the deletion of the SWI6 gene led to abnormal amino acid and lipid metabolism, potentially exacerbating energy storage imbalance. Secondly, significant enrichment of metabolites related to GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis implied compromised cell wall integrity. Lastly, disruption of ABC transport protein metabolism may hinder intracellular transmembrane transport. Importantly, this study represents the first investigation into the potential regulatory mechanisms of SWI6 in plant filamentous pathogenic fungi from a metabolic perspective. The findings provide novel insights into the role of SWI6 in the growth and virulence of C. fimbriata, highlighting its potential as a target for controlling this pathogen.",

            "text": "As one of the most important tuber crops in the world, sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is extensively cultivated, particularly in Asia and Africa, due to its high yield and rich content of starch and other beneficial nutrients for human consumption [1\u20133]. C. fimbriata is the causative agent of sweet potato black rot, a highly destructive storage disease that poses a significant threat to sweet potato crops, and this plant fungal pathogen exhibits a hemi biotrophic infection style, primarily targeting the nutrient tissues of sweet potatoes [4\u20137]. C. fimbriata not only infects sweet potato storage roots through wounds but also invades the vascular xylem, ultimately causing plant wilting and death [5,8]. C. fimbriata infection in sweet potato storage roots can induce the production of furanoterpenoid toxins, namely\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11112666 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 2 of 23\nipomeamarone, dehydroipomeamarone, and ipomeamaronol [3,9]. Consumption of sweet potatoes contaminated with these toxins can result in severe liver and lung damage in both humans and animals [4,10]. Currently, research on sweet potato black rot primarily focuses on the development of chemical reagents to combat C. fimbriata, the breeding of resistant sweet potato varieties, and comprehensive prevention and control measures in agricultural cultivation [5,11\u201314]. However, there is little research on the pathogenic mechanism of C. fimbriata to help develop effective prevention and control measures for sweet potato black rot. Studying key pathogenic genes is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of pathogenic fungi. It enables the identification of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for the prevention and treatment of fungal infections [15\u201320]. The APSES (Asm1p, Phd1p, Sok2p, Efg1p, and Stuap) protein family, characterized by a basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) domain, consists of fungus-specific transcription factors that play crucial roles in various cellular processes [21,22]. In Aspergillus fumigatus, the APSES transcription factor MbsA regulates growth, spore wall architecture, Gliotoxin production, and virulence via the SakA signaling pathway [22]. The APSES protein Swi6 interacts with Mbp1 to form the MluI cell cycle box-binding complex, regulating mycelial differentiation and virulence in Beauveria bassiana [23,24]. The transcription factor CsXbp1 plays a role in appressoria formation and sclerotial development in Ciboria shiraiana. Additionally, the pathogenicity of CsXbp1 RNAi strain to tobacco is significantly weakened [25]. In the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora, AoPkc, AoSlt2, and AoSwi6 are involved in regulating trap formation and pathogenicity. Additionally, the deletion of genes encoding these proteins significantly impacts the changes in secondary metabolites [26]. The transcriptional cofactor FgSwi6 is indispensable for cellulose utilization and deoxynivalenol production in Fusarium graminearum. Furthermore, FgSwi6 plays a role in phenotypic alterations induced by F. graminearum virus 1 infection. The deletion of the FgSWI6 gene significantly diminishes F. graminearum virulence on wheat plants by approximately 80% [27,28]. The deletion of Mstu1 or Swi6 in APSES transcription factor resulted in notable alterations in mycelial growth and morphology in Magnaporthe oryzae. Moreover, these mutants exhibited impaired ability to penetrate rice leaves [29,30]. However, the functionality of Swi6 in C. fimbriata has not been reported to date. In this study, we aimed to investigate the growth and pathogenicity mechanisms of C. fimbriata through analysis of the metabolic profile changes resulting from SWI6 gene deletion. The deletion of the SWI6 gene in C. fimbriata resulted in the loss of infectivity towards sweet potato storage roots. Metabolomic analysis of C. fimbriata and the \u2206Cfswi6 identified 692 PDAMs across 13 categories, including organic acids and derivatives, lipids and lipid-like molecules, and organoheterocyclic compounds. The disruption of SWI6 primarily reprogrammed metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis, and ABC transporters, which may lead to impaired growth and reduced virulence in C. fimbriata. Our survey offers a novel perspective for investigating the growth and virulence mechanism of C. fimbriata, and establishes a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of sweet potato black rot."

The colony diameter of the \u2206Cfswi6 mutants exhibited a significant decrease on both media (Figure 1B). In the CM liquid medium, the hyphal balls of the \u2206Cfswi6 mutants were notably smaller compared to BMPZ13 (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the biomass of the \u2206Cfswi6-3 and \u2206Cfswi65 mutants cultured in CM liquid medium decreased by 27.7% and 35.3% compared with BMPZ13, respectively (Figure 1D). Conversely, these growth defects were absent in the \u2206Cfswi6/CfSWI6 complemented mutant. The findings suggested that CfSWI6 played a critical role in the normal growth and development of C. fimbriata, aligning with previous studies that highlighted the involvement of APSES transcription factors in the regulation of fungal growth [21\u201323,29,34,35].\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 5 of 23icroor i , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 23\nFigure 1.

Deletion of CfSWI6 Gene Significantly Reduced the Virulence of C. fimbriata to Sweet Potato To assess the effect of CfSWI6 on the virulence of C. fimbriata to sweet potato, pathogenicity assays of sweet potato storage roots with conidial suspensions of BMPZ13 and \u2206Cfswi6 were conducted. After incubating sweet potato storage roots with a suspension of C. fimbriata conidia for 25 days, significant differences were observed between samples inoculated with the wild-type strain and the mutant strains (Figure 2A). Inoculation with the wild-type strain resulted in pronounced depressions at the site of sweet potato storage root wounds, accompanied by browning of the epidermis and the presence of conspicuous aerial hyphae ((ii) in Figure 2A). Upon removal of the sweet potato storage root epidermis, distinct black spots were observed at the inoculation site, indicating tissue collapse and the production of a foul odor ((iii) and (iv) in Figure 2A). These symptoms closely resembled those observed in sweet potato storage roots infected with C. fimbriata in previous research [5,7,36]. There were no significant differences observed in the sweet potato storage roots, both in terms of the outer skin and internal tissues, between the mutant strain-inoculated group and the H2O. The measurements of weight loss and lesion area in the samples also confirmed the above conclusion (Figure 2B,C). Additionally, the phenotype of sweet potato storage roots inoculated with the complemented strains resembled that of the wild-type samples, suggesting the significant involvement of the SWI6 gene in the virulence of C. fimbriata. This finding aligns with previous functional studies on the SWI6 gene in other fungi [23,26\u201329].\nFigure 1. Vegetative gro th of C. fimbriata and the utants.

These symptoms closely resembled those observed in sweet potato storage roots infected with C. fimbriata in previous research [5,7,36]. There were no significant differences observed in the sweet potato storage roots, both in terms of the outer skin and internal tissues, between the mutant strain-inoculated group and the H2O. The measurements of weight loss and lesion area in the samples also confirmed the above conclusion (Figure 2B,C). Additionally, the phenotype of sweet potato storage roots inoculated with the complemented strains resembled that of the wild-type samples, suggesting the significant involvement of the SWI6 gene in the virulence of C. fimbriata. This finding aligns with previous functional studies on the SWI6 gene in other fungi [23,26\u201329].\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 6 of 23icroorganis s 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 23\nproducing the toxins, including furanoterpenoids such as ipomeamarone [3,4,9,10].

A total of 692 PDAMs were categorized into 13 categories (Table S6) based on the HMDB in Figure 5E. Among these metabolites, 183 PDAMs were classified as organic acids and derivatives, 98 PDAMs as lipids and lipid-like molecules, 94 PDAMs as organoheterocyclic compounds, 46 PDAMs as benzenoids, 43 PDAMs as organic oxygen compounds, 39 PDAMs as phenylpropanoids and polyketides, 20 PDAMs as nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues, and 10 PDAMs as alkaloids and derivatives. Figure 5E illustrates that among the 13 selected categories, the majority of differentially expressed metabolites were found to accumulate in organic acids and derivatives, lipids, and lipid-like molecules, and organoheterocyclic compounds.

            "text": "To examine the distribution of differential metabolites within the potential metabolic profiles of wild-type and mutant strains, hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the top 50 PDAMs based on their abundance (Figure 6 and Table S7). Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the formation of five distinct clusters, with the results indicating that the relative abundance of potential metabolites in clusters 1, 4, and 5 were upregulated in the mutant group compared to the wild-type group. Conversely, clusters 2 and 3 showed downregulation in the mutant group. Among the 36 upregulated potential metabolites (Table S7) of clusters 1, 4, and 5, 18 were classified as organic acids and derivatives, primarily amino acids, peptides, and analogues. Additionally, eight potential metabolites were classified as lipids and lipid-like molecules, while two metabolites belonged to nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues. Studies have demonstrated the crucial role of amino acids in the metabolic processes of pathogenic fungi, as the balance of amino acid metabolism is essential for their successful host invasion [39\u201341]. In M. oryzae, the model species of filamentous fungi, disruption of lysine [42,43], leucine, isoleucine, and valine synthesis [41,44], as well as methionine [45,46] and arginine [40,47,48], significantly impacted mycelial development and virulence. Similarly, in human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, the mutants without ILV2 gene were unable to grow on nutrient-poor yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium and exhibited loss of virulence [49]. Additionally, the \u2206ilv2 mutants in Candida albicans displayed a significant decrease in viability and a notable reduction in virulence during isoleucine and/or valine starvation [50]. Lipids and lipid-like molecules are essential components of cells and participate in various biological processes, including the formation of biological membranes, energy reserves, and signal transduction [51]. Studies have shown that abnormalities in lipid metabolism led to significant changes in fungal growth, development, and pathogenicity [52\u201356]. Compared to the wild type, the mutant exhibited a significant upregulation in the abundance of potential metabolites related to organic acids and derivatives, as well as lipids and lipid-like molecules. Among the 14 downregulated potential metabolites (Table S7), five were classified as phenylpropanoids and polyketides. Polyketide play a crucial role in fungal growth and pathogenicity. Melanin, a polyketide compound produced by M. oryzae, is essential for rice infection [29,57]. Pyriculol, a secondary metabolite of M. oryzae, induces rice leaf lesions, while extracts from MoPKS19 (a polyketide synthase gene) knockout mutants fail to induce plant toxic lesions [58].

            "text": "To investigate the significance and abundance trends of PDAMs between the mutants and wild-type groups, we utilized the VIP score within the framework of the OPLS-DA model to evaluate PDAMs. The top 30 potential metabolites exhibiting significant differences in VIP score between the two groups were identified (Figure 7 and Table S8). According to Figure 7, significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of 30 potential metabolites between the two groups (p < 0.01). Notably, aminomethyl fluorescein, esculentic acid and (3beta,17alpha,23R)-17, 23-EPOxy-3, 29-Dihydroxy-27-Norlanost8-ene-15,24-dione exhibited lower abundance levels in the mutant group compared to the wild type group. Conversely, the remaining potential metabolites displayed the opposite trend (Figure 7). The top 5 potential metabolites with the highest VIP scores were identified as Spironolactone, Ile-Ser-Leu, Tsangane L 3-glucoside, 1-Methyluric acid, and Val-Ile-Ile. Spironolactone is a steroid lactone, and existing research has demonstrated the impact of steroid hormones on fungal growth [59\u201362], morphology [63,64], and virulence [65,66]. Specifically, steroids disrupt fungal cell wall- or membrane-specific sensor proteins, leading to membrane stretching and activation of the CWI pathway [67,68]. Tsangane L 3-glucoside is a terpene glucoside, and previous studies have highlighted the essential role of glucosidases in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in glycoprotein processing [69]. In fungi, defects in protein glycosylation pathways have been associated with reduced virulence, delayed dimorphism, and impaired interaction with the host immune system [70\u201373]. Furthermore, deficiencies in glucosidase activity led to changes in cell wall composition and tissue, ultimately activating the cell integrity pathway [74]. In S. cerevisiae, Swi6 was a transcription factor that functions downstream of the CWI-MAPK signaling pathway, playing a role in cell wall biogenesis and cell cycle regulation [68,75\u201377]. CWI defects resulting from the deletion of the SWI6 gene have been observed in Ganoderma lucidum [35,78], M. oryzae [29], B. bassiana [23], Fusarium granulosa [28], and Oligospora oligospora [26]. Additionally, SWI6 has been implicated in mediating morphological transformations in B. bassiana and O. oligospora, and these observations can be attributed to the involvement of SWI6 in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which in turn mediates CWI [26,29,35,75\u201380]. Therefore, we speculate that the loss of the SWI6 gene impairs the regulation of CWI in C. fimbriata, resulting in slow growth and decreased virulence. Purines are fundamental constituents of nucleotides in living organisms, serving as essential metabolites for cellular physiology [81]. They play crucial roles as structural components of DNA and RNA, energy carriers, and enzyme cofactors [82]. Perturbations in purine nucleotide metabolism have been shown to significantly impact fungal development and virulence [81\u201385]. 1-Methyluric acid, a purine and purine derivative, has received limited attention in fungal research. However, in clinical studies on human kidney stones, abnormal purine metabolism has been associated with increased synthesis of 1-methyluric acid. This compound, a major component of caffeine metabolites, has been shown to induce innate immune cell responses and acute kidney injury. In mouse experiments, 1-methyluric acid affects the bladder mucosa, leading to elevated levels of serum glucose, insulin, true triglycerides, and total cholesterol, ultimately resulting in metabolic syndrome [86\u201388]. The observed higher abundance of 1-Methyluric acid in \u2206Cfswi6-3 compared to the wild type suggests a potential role for SWI6 in regulating the growth and pathogenicity of C. fimbriata through purine nucleotide metabolism.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 13 of 23Microorganisms 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 23\nFigure 7.

            "text": "To elucidate the potential key metabolic or biosynthetic pathways linked to the differential metabolites, annotation, and analysis of the 692 PDAMs were performed using the KEGG database, resulting in the classification into 15 KEGG second-grade pathways (Figure 8A and Table S9). Among these pathways, 320 potential metabolites were classified under \u201cmetabolism\u201d. Within the \u201cMetabolism\u201d category, the top priority pathway was \u201cGlobal and overview maps\u201d, followed by \u201cAmino acid metabolism\u201d, \u201cBiosynthesis of other secondary metabolites\u201d, \u201cCarbohydrate metabolism\u201d, \u201cMetabolism of other amino acids\u201d, \u201cMetabolism of cofactors and vitamins\u201d, \u201cLipid metabolism\u201d, \u201cNucleotide metabolism\u201d, \u201cEnergy metabolism\u201d, \u201cMetabolism of terpenoids and polyketides\u201d, and \u201cGlycan biosynthesis and metabolism\u201d. In addition, a metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on the 692 PDAMs (Figure 8B and Table S10). The results revealed significant differences in the enrichment rates of these potential metabolites in 14 metabolic pathways when comparing the mutant strain to the wild type. Notably, the pathways tryptophan metabolism, lysine degradation, arginine and proline metabolism, and ABC transporters exhibited highly significant differences (p < 0.001). Tryptophan is an indispensable amino acid for the biosynthesis of the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in fungi, and it plays a critical role in fungal pathogenicity [89]. Treatment with tryptophan has been shown to enhance the production of 15- acetyldeoxynivalenolchanl in F. graminearum [90]. Moreover, in Sporisorium scitamineum, tryptophan-related synthetic enzymes exert a positive regulatory effect on filamentous growth, oxidative stress tolerance, and full pathogenicity [91]. Perturbations in lysine metabolism have been found to impede mycelial development and diminish virulence in M. oryzae [42,43] and A. oligospora. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid crucial for spore germination, growth, and pathogenicity in fungi. Disruption of arginine biosynthesis genes leads to defects in asexual reproduction and pathogenicity in Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [92,93] and M. oryzae [40,47,48]. Arginine also plays a vital role in mycelial morphology through nitrogen metabolism in C. albicans [94], Metarhizium acridum [95], and Arbuscular Mycorrhizal [96]. Furthermore, arginine accumulation inhibits the synthesis of fungal toxins such as ochratoxin (OTA), citrinin (CIT), alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethylether (AME), and tenuazonic acid (TeA) in various fungal species [97]. Proline acts as an antioxidant and osmoprotectant, effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species in S. cerevisiae cells and maintaining redox balance [98\u2013102]. Furthermore, proline synthesis plays a crucial role in the fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity of C. albicans [103,104]. The enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways suggests that disruption of SWI6 perturbs the metabolism of tryptophan, lysine, arginine, and proline, which are crucial for fungal growth and development. This provides a potential reasonable explanation for the inability of the \u2206Cfswi6 to colonize sweet potato storage roots and exhibit abnormal pathogenicity. ABC transporters, the largest gene family of transporter proteins, are present in all organisms [105]. They consist of structurally conserved nucleotide-binding domains and transmembrane domains [106]. By harnessing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, ABC transporters facilitate the transmembrane transport of diverse substrates, including amino acids, proteins, metal ions, fungal secretions, metabolites, sugars, peptides, and antibiotics [107]. Beyond their transport role, ABC transporters also participate in various physiological processes such as virulence, mitochondrial iron homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, and RNA translation [106,108,109]. Notably, in plant pathogenic fungi like M. oryzae [110,111], F. graminearum [106,112\u2013114], Neofusicoccum parvum [115], Mycosphaerella graminicola [116,117], Colletotrichum lindemuthianum [118], C. albicans [119,120], and Botrytis cinerea [121], ABC transporters have been identified as an important virulence determinant. In Figure 8B, the deletion of SWI6 in C. fimbriata leads to a significant enrichment of ABC transporters in the metabolic profile. This observation implies that ABC transporters potentially have a crucial involvement in the virulence of C. fimbriata, primarily through their transport function.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 15 of 23Microorganisms 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 23\nFigure 8.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a conserved complex glycolipid derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes [122,123]. It acts as a cell surface anchor for over 100 cell wall proteins in yeast, initially covalently linked to \u03b21-6 glucan [124,125]. Previous research has revealed that manogepix, a novel antifungal drug, targets the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins by inhibiting Gwt1, an inositol acyltransferase in the ER [126]. Gwt1 is essential for the transport and anchoring of mannose-containing proteins to the fungal cell membrane and wall [127]. Furthermore, the inability of GPI proteins to anchor to the plasma membrane or successfully crosslink with \u03b21,6-glucan polymers may fail to form glycosylphosphatidylinositol-cell wall proteins (GPICWPs) [128], which constitute the outer layer structure of the cell wall, thereby disrupting cell wall integrity. Thus, the biosynthesis and metabolism of GPI-anchored proteins were vital for fungal virulence and CWI [124\u2013126,128\u2013133]. Cell wall damage, stress sensitivity, and reduced pathogenicity in SWI6 mutants observed in several fungi [26,28,29,78], may be attributed to abnormal GPI synthesis and metabolism. Disruption of the SWI6 gene in C. fimbriata affects potential key metabolic pathways, including tryptophan, lysine, arginine, and proline metabolism. It also impacts the function of ABC transporters, crucial for virulence. Additionally, this disruption affects GPI anchor biosynthesis, essential for cell wall integrity and fungal virulence. These factors likely form an interconnected regulatory network that collectively mediates the growth and pathogenicity of SWI6 in sweet potato (Figure 9).

Conclusions In this study, we investigated the essential factors contributing to the growth and virulence of C. fimbriata by characterizing the potential metabolic profile of the SWI6 deletion mutants using LC-MS-based non-targeted metabolomics. Our findings demonstrated that the mutant strain exhibited differential abundance of potential metabolites, primarily belonging to organic acids and derivatives, lipids, and lipid-like molecules, and organoheterocyclic compounds, compared to the wild type. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism, ABC transport proteins, and GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis. These potential metabolic pathways are likely involved in mediating the virulence of C. fimbriata through processes such as energy supply, intracellular transmembrane transport, and cell wall integrity. Targeted identification and quantification of PDAMs identified in the analysis will be the focus of future investigations. Future studies also should evaluate the additional functions of the APSES transcription factor CfSwi6, such as its role in CWI and molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes. These studies will provide valuable targets for the control of C. fimbriata in sweet potatoes, thereby enhancing the strategies for the biological management of sweet potato black rot disease.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1: Targeted CfSWI6 deletion and complementation in C. fimbriata; Table S1: Mobile phase elution gradient in LC-MS; Table S2: Potential metabolites in POS mode; Table S3: Potential metabolites in NEG mode; Table S4: PDAMs in POS mode; Table S5: PDAMs in NEG mode; Table S6: 13 categories of potential metabolites based on the HMDB; Table S7: Top 50 metabolites based on abundance in PDAMs; Table S8: Top 30 PDAMs in VIP score; Table S9: KEGG pathway annotated and classification of the PDAMs; Table S10: KEGG enrichment analysis of the PDAMs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.C., D.M., L.L. and J.J.; Formal analysis, L.L.; Funding acquisition, J.J.; Investigation, H.C., C.L., Y.W. and Y.Z.; Methodology, H.C.; Project administration, J.J.; Resources, D.M.; Validation, H.C. and C.L.; Writing\u2014original draft, H.C.; Writing\u2014review and editing, L.L. and J.J.

Our findings emonstrated that he mu ant strain exhibited differential abundance of potential metabolites, primarily belonging to organic acids and derivatives, lipids, and lipid-like molecules, and organoheter cyclic compounds, compared to the wild type. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2666 17 of 23\nrevealed significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism, ABC transport proteins, and GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis. These potential metabolic pathways are likely involved in mediating the virulence of C. fimbriata through processes such as energy supply, intracellular transmembrane transport, and cell wall integrity. Targeted identification and quantification of PDAMs identified in the analysis will be the focus of future investigations. Future studies also should evaluate the additional functions of the APSES transcription factor CfSwi6, such as its role in CWI and molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes.
