            "text": "Resin kinetics inform polymerization extent of cure and processing conditions, which are central to polymer network formation. How the polymer network is formed influences the final physical and mechanical properties of the material, and insufficient curing can be detrimental to the material\u2019s performance.1\u20135 Thus, characterization of the kinetics is important for understanding the structure\u2013property\u2013processing relationships of polymers, which is essential for industrial process development and quality control.6 Additionally, ensuring sufficient curing mitigates safety risks as unreacted monomers and other low molecular weight components could diffuse out of the material, causing adverse health effects. Cure kinetics are also important for determining adequate\nmanufacturing times and establishing safe processing and storage conditions, especially in formulations that contain multicomponent reagents and initiators.7 Because of the complexity of multicomponent resin systems, there is a need for chemically independent techniques that can be implemented in situ into manufacturing processes.\nMany experimental techniques are used to monitor resin cure kinetics including changes in refractive index,8\u201310 rheology,11,12 and dielectric analysis13\u201315 although differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are perhaps the most widely implemented. DSC exposes a sample to a thermal profile and measures the heat flow during the curing process.16\u201320 Monitoring kinetics with DSC assumes that the heat evolved is proportional to the extent of cure of reactive groups and that the reaction rate is proportional to the measured heat flow.17 Similarly, photoDSC monitors the heat release of photocurable resins after being irradiated with UV or visible light.6,7,21,22 In both DSC and photo-DSC, factors such as the method of sample preparation, the heating rate of the DSC test, and specificity of temperature integral approximation can have effects on the calculations and results.17,23 Photo-DSC is also limited by the relatively long delay times due to the required low-intensity light.6\nFTIR is used for monitoring the kinetics of both thermal and photocurable systems and provides chemical information about the resin as the absorption band is proportional to the \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Alternatively, conversion of the bulk polymer can be monitored in the near-IR range through transmission measurements, which can be adapted for in-line process monitoring.28\u201331 While effective for monitoring both physical and chemical properties of polymers, near-IR spectra contain overlapping overtones and combinations of bands from the mid-IR that often require nontrivial post-processing and chemometric data analysis.32,33\nRaman spectroscopy has been used to study the real-time kinetics of different polymerization reactions such as those of microemulsions and epoxy resin systems.4,34\u201336 Raman is a sensitive probe of nonpolar molecules, and as a noncontact, non-destructive technique, it is suitable for in situ monitoring of cure kinetics. Raman spectra can be subdivided into three main regions known as the stretch region (>2000 cm\u22121), the chemical fingerprint region (\u223c500 cm\u22121\u2013\u223c2000 cm\u22121), and the structural region (<500 cm\u22121). However, thus far, Raman-based polymerization kinetics studies have focused exclusively on signals in the chemical fingerprint region,4,34,35 such as the methacrylate (CvC) band at \u223c1640 cm\u22121 and the epoxy band (\u2013CH\u2013O\u2013CH2) at \u223c1250 cm\u22121.\nRaman scattering in the low-frequency (terahertz) region, which is a subset of the structural region, is directly related to the phonon density of states g(\u03bd).37\u201340 In highly ordered crystalline materials, acoustic phonon modes produce sharp bands in the Raman spectrum, but as the material becomes less ordered, these modes tend to broaden and redshift simultaneously. For soft amorphous materials, g(\u03bd) is dominated by two main features \u2013 the Boson and van Hove peaks.40\u201350 In amorphous polymers, the Raman scattering intensity IR(\u03bd) can be directly related to g(\u03bd) by\nIR \u03bd\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc C \u03bd\u00f0 \u00deg \u03bd\u00f0 \u00de \u03bdj j n \u03bd;T\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe H \u03bd\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03bd is the frequency of the Raman shift, C(\u03bd) is the coupling coefficient, n(\u03bdT ) = (eh\u03bd/kBT \u2212 1)\u22121 is the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution function with kB being Boltzmann\u2019s constant, h is Planck\u2019s constant, and T is the temperature.37\u201339,51\u201353 The Heaviside function H(\u03bd) = 1 for \u03bd \u2265 0, 0 otherwise, accounts for the difference in the probability between the Stokes and antiStokes shifted photons.\nWe have previously shown that these phonon modes result in a broad (\u223c150 cm\u22121 wide) disorder band in polymers with an apparent peak near 15 cm\u22121 and a well-defined shoulder dominated by the Boson and van Hove peaks, respectively.37 In that work, we showed that by normalizing the disorder band to the shoulder, the integrated intensity near the peak of the disorder band could be used to measure the effective change in conformational entropy as a polymer goes through the glass\ntransition, without the need for advanced spectral processing or peak fitting.\nIn this work, we describe how this same methodology can be applied to measure polymerization kinetics by monitoring the decrease in the normalized disorder band as a resin polymerizes. Since the disorder band in soft amorphous materials is a universal feature, this approach benefits from combining the \u201cchemically agnostic\u201d nature of traditional thermalmechanical analysis methods with the non-contact, nondestructive nature of laser-based vibrational spectroscopy. Herein, we demonstrate the universality of this technique by detecting transient structural changes during the curing process of methacrylate, epoxy\u2013amine, and dual-cure methacrylate/epoxy interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) resins."

Light from an Omnicure Series 2000 high-\npower xenon source (Excelitas Technologies) was passed through a 365 nm bandpass filter, fiber-coupled to a large core \u201clight pipe\u201d, and then collimated directly above the sample platform to allow for relatively uniform illumination of the resins.

An unconstrained fit of the chemical conversion data resulted in \u03b1u = 0.79, k = 0.09, and n = 4.3 with a sum square error, SSE, of 0.59. The previous FTIR analysis of DA-2 with 0.7 wt% phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide as the photoinitiator, under various illumination intensities at a wavelength of 405 nm yielded \u03b1u = 0.74 and n = 4.4. The k values cannot be compared as the previous analysis modified the rate constant by including an intensity dependent prefactor in the kinetic rate equation: d\u03b1 dt\n\u00bc I\u03c9E k \u03b1u \u03b1\u00f0 \u00den, where IE is the light intensity and \u03c9 the dose rate exponent with a reported value of 0.71.5\nVisual inspection of the structural kinetics data (Fig. 3b) clearly shows the same general shape of the curve, with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. It should be noted that an unconstrained fit produced kinetic constants of \u03b1u = 0.51, n = 3.0, and k = 0.12 with an SSE of 0.14, which do not match the chemical kinetics values. This is not unexpected since chemical conversion is a direct measure of monomer polymerization whereas structural conversion reflects the change in phonon dispersion. Therefore, the conversion values do not have the same physical meaning in structural kinetics as they do in chemical kinetics. However, as shown in Fig. 3c, there is a scaling factor c = 1.39 between the chemical and structural conversion curves of DA-2\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Analyst, 2023, 148, 5698\u20135706 | 5701\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Over the course of 12 different DA-2 experiments (see ESI Table S.1\u2020) with light intensities ranging from 0.22\u20131.08 mW cm\u22122 we found the scaling constant was robust with a value of c = 1.40 \u00b1 0.02.

Results shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate the ability to generate both chemical and structural conversion curves. Unconstrained fitting produced kinetic constants of \u03b1u = 0.88, k = 0.002, and n = 1.2 for the chemical conversion, and \u03b1u = 0.58, k = 0.01, and n = 2.1 for the structural conversion. Due to the combination of low Raman scattering efficiency and the broad overlapping shape of peaks in this region, the chemical conversion is inherently noisy (Fig. 4a) with a large SSE of 24.11. By contrast, the noise in the structural conversion data (Fig. 4b) is comparable to that of the data of the UV-cured resin system. Fig. 4c gives c = 1.57 for the two curves with an MSR of 0.0025, further demonstrating the self-consistency between the chemical and structural kinetics. It should be noted that, unlike the DA-2 resin where the proportionality constant settled in under 1 min, the EPON 828 took nearly 15 min before the proportionality constant stabilized. Over the course of 10 different experiments (see ESI Table S.2\u2020) with the EPON 828 system with \u223c180 \u00b0C cure temperature, the average proportionality constant was c = 1.71 \u00b1 0.26.\nIt should also be noted that in some of the EPON 828 experiments there was an apparent initial dip in the structural conversion, likely due to a transient drop in viscosity prior to gelation. For the purposes of calculating the c values, the conversion curves were truncated to remove any such initial drops, if necessary (see ESI\u2020).\nUpon peak fitting, we determined the relative contributions to the disorder band from the quasi-elastic Rayleigh scattering, Boson peak, and normal mode dominated by the van Hove peak.37,57 Fig. 5 shows the fitted results at the end of the cure for both resin formulations, clearly demonstrating the simultaneous blueshift and decrease in the Boson peak after cure. It is important to note that EPON 828 is softer than the DA-2, with the two polymers having reported storage moduli of 2.1 GPa and 3.0 GPa, respectively54,58 and EPON 828 is cured at elevated temperatures, further softening it which accounts for the difference in the final Boson peak locations: 12 cm\u22121 for EPON 828 and 16 cm\u22121 for DA-2. Nonetheless, these differences in the phonon dispersion have no noticeable impact on the applicability of this method to measure the polymerization of the two resin systems, but the difference in moduli likely contributes to the difference in the c values between the two resin systems."

Fig. 6 shows the results of both the methacrylate, epoxy, and structural conversions at room temperature over a 1 h exposure to 365 nm light with an intensity of 1.01 mW cm\u22122. Using the same methodology as the previous resin, we were able to measure both chemical (methacrylate and epoxy) and structural conversion. Unconstrained fitting produced kinetic constants of \u03b1u = 0.76, k = 0.01, and n = 1.8 for the methacrylate chemical conversion,\n5702 | Analyst, 2023, 148, 5698\u20135706 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As expected, there was no observable epoxy chemical conversion (Fig. 6b). Both the methacrylate chemical and structural conversion fits had a relatively low SSE of 1.92 and 0.24, respectively. However, upon visual inspection of Fig. 6a and c, it is obvious that below 500 s, the fit is not as good as those in the other two resin systems, resulting from the relatively long inhibition time (higher activation energy) of the PBE resin. Both fits could have been improved by accounting for inhibition, but that was beyond the scope of this study.\nFig. 6d shows that for the methacrylate fingerprint and structural conversion curves c = 1.95 with an MSR of 0.0003. Over the course of 14 different PBE experiments (see ESI Table S.3\u2020) with light intensities ranging from 0.21\u20131.03 mW cm\u22122, we found c = 1.98 \u00b1 0.02. In addition to further validating the self-consistency between the chemical and structural conversions, this is also in accord with our hypothesis regarding the correlation between the modulus and the proportionality constant. Since the PBE resin was not thermally post-cured, the epoxy\u2013amine network was not able to form, resulting in a significantly softer material and, therefore, a higher proportionality constant. Upon peak fitting, the final Boson peak position of the photocured PBE resin was determined to be 16 cm\u22121, which is identical to the results of the fully methacrylate DA-2 resin.\nLastly, we evaluated the PBE resin through the entire dual cure process. First it was photocured with an illumination intensity of 1.02 mW cm\u22122 for 1 h, at which time the UV lamp was turned off, and data collection was paused. The sample was removed while the stage was heated to 180 \u00b0C. The sample was then placed back on the temperature stage, and data collection was resumed for 2 h, simulating a traditional post-cure in a preheated oven. Fig. 7 shows the change in the spectral\nweight of the disorder band, which reflect the kinetics of both the UV and thermal cures. The sizeable negative step discontinuity in the data is due primarily to the temperature depen-\nFig. 5 Intensity corrected Raman spectra (blue) fitted to the total intensity (red) as well as the associated QERS (yellow), Boson peak (purple), and normal mode (green) contributions for DA-2 pre (a) and post cure (b) and EPON 828 pre (c) and post cure (d).\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Analyst, 2023, 148, 5698\u20135706 | 5703\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, there may also be additional contributions due to uncertainty in sample placement during the thermal cure.\nWe independently analysed the UV and thermal cure regions to gain a deeper insight into the cure kinetics. During the photocure, no measurable conversion was present from the epoxy. The kinetic constants from the methacrylate chemical conversion were \u03b1u = 0.79, k = 0.010, and n = 1.83 with an SSE of 1.72, and the kinetic constants from the structural conversion were \u03b1u = 0.39, k = 0.010, and n = 1.4 with an SSE of 0.34. We also determined that the methacrylate-to-structural proportionality constant was c = 1.97. As expected, these results are extremely close to those shown in Fig. 6.\nThe thermal cure kinetics unveiled several interesting kinetic processes beyond simple epoxy\u2013amine polymerization. One interesting observation is additional methacrylate polymerization during the first 500 s of the thermal cure (Fig. 8a). We believe this may result from increased chain mobility above the glass transition temperature and increased internal energy allowing the release of trapped free radicals from dissolved oxygen. We were able to determine kinetic constants for the additional methacrylate conversion of \u03b1u = 0.3, k = 0.010, and n = 1.35; although it should be noted that the data were quite noisy, resulting in an SSE of 81.6. Still, an additional cure of 0.3 indicates a 30% increase over the photocure, which had an ultimate cure of 0.79, implying complete methacrylate conversion after thermal processing.\nDuring the thermal cure, the epoxy chemical conversion was given by kinetic constants \u03b1u = 0.89, k = 0.010, and n = 2 with an SSE of 25.99 (Fig. 8b), and the kinetic constants from the structural conversion were \u03b1u = 0.17, k = 0.010, and n = 2 with an SSE of 0.07 (Fig. 8c). As illustrated in Fig. 8d, the structural conversion appears to lag the chemical conversion for the first half hour of the thermal cure. We hypothesize this is an indication that during the initial polymerization of the sec-\nondary network (epoxy\u2013amine), the modulus is still dominated by the primary network (methacrylate), resulting in slower structural kinetics. However, since both curves tend to overlap\nFig. 7 PBE dual UV-thermal cure kinetics obtained using structural region.\n5704 | Analyst, 2023, 148, 5698\u20135706 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

            "text": "These results demonstrate the applicability of utilizing the disorder band present in the low-frequency region of the Raman spectra as a measure of the polymer extent of cure. This band is a universal feature of amorphous materials, providing a noncontact and chemically agnostic methodology for determining polymerization kinetics. Through the use of the structural-to-chemical proportionality constant, we have demonstrated the ability to correlate the decrease in the overall disorder of the material and the reduction in the bond concentration of polymerization reactive functional groups. The large Raman scattering efficiency in the lowfrequency provides a noticeable improvement in the signalto-noise ratio. Although the effects of curing at elevated temperature (e.g., changes in viscosity and low-frequency Raman scattering intensity) require additional exploration, the improved signal-to-noise and chemically agnostic nature of structural cure kinetics is particularly promising for epoxy systems which have been historically difficult to measure with traditional vibrational spectroscopy.59 Analysis of a dual-cure IPN has shown a discrepancy between the structural and chemical conversion kinetics, indicating a different relationship between polymerization and modulus as the secondary network forms in the presence of the primary network. Further rheological studies are needed to test this hypothesis.\nAuthor contributions\nRobert V.
