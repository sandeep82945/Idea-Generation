    "abstractText": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens is widely conducted in microbiological, medical, and clinical research to explore genetic insights that could impact clinical treatment and molecular epidemiology. However, analyzing WGS data of bacteria can pose challenges for microbiologists, clinicians, and researchers, as it requires the application of several bioinformatics pipelines to extract genetic information from raw data. In this paper, we present BacSeq, an automated bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of next-generation sequencing data of bacterial genomes. BacSeq enables the assembly, annotation, and identification of crucial genes responsible for multidrug resistance, virulence factors, and plasmids. Additionally, the pipeline integrates comparative analysis among isolates, offering phylogenetic tree analysis and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To facilitate easy analysis in a single step and support the processing of multiple isolates, BacSeq provides a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the JAVA platform. It is designed to cater to users without extensive bioinformatics skills.",

            "text": "High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have revolutionized the field of genomics by allowing researchers to analyze large quantities of genetic material in a relatively short amount of time [1,2]. Short-read sequencing (SRS) and long-read sequencing (LRS) are powerful tools to study the entire genomes of bacteria [2]. The sequence reads from these technologies are generated as a fastq file, which needs bioinformatics tools for further analysis. Command-line, web-based, and program-based tools are currently used for sequence analyses [3]. Among them, command-line tools provide maximum flexibility and are highly customizable, but require a higher level of technical expertise and may be more time-consuming for certain tasks. Web-based tools, on the other hand, are generally more user-friendly and accessible to users without extensive bioinformatics training, but may have limitations in terms of customization and flexibility. Program-based tools provide a balance between the two, offering a graphical user interface that is more accessible than command-line tools while still providing a high degree of flexibility. In a previous study, Quijada et al., (2019) developed automated pipelines called TORMES for analyzing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of bacteria generated by Illumina platforms [4]. TORMES automates the bioinformatic analysis steps, including\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1769. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11071769 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1769 2 of 14\nsequence quality filtering, de novo assembly, draft genome ordering against a reference, genome annotation, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), searching for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and pan-genome comparisons. The pipeline can be used for any set of bacteria from any species and origin, and more extensive analyses for Escherichia and Salmonella can be enabled using the \u2212g/\u2212 genera option. Once the analysis is finished, TORMES generates an interactive web-like report that can be opened in any web browser, and shared and revised by researchers in a simple manner. However, it should be noted that TORMES may not be suitable for all types of WGS data, and researchers probably consider using other inputs, such as short-read sequences and long-read sequences from different platforms, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of their bacterial genomes. Additionally, many researchers may not have the necessary bioinformaticians to fully utilize TORMES or other sequencing analysis tools. We then aimed to generate and improve an easy-to-use automated pipeline for WGS and bioinformatics analyses of bacterial genomes, which is beneficial for non-bioinformatician users."

The pipeline begins with loading compressed raw read files (.fastq.gz; accessed on 5 May 2023) and checking the quality via FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ fastqc/; accessed on 5 May 2023), and the results are imported into MultiQC [5] to generate summary reports. The trimming step is then performed using fastp [6] to remove the adapter sequence, cut low-quality bases, and trim all reads at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends. Next, SPAdes [7] is used for assembling the filtered sequences into contigs and scaffolds using various k-mer lengths. Next, genome assembly assessment and completeness evaluation are performed using QUAST [8] and BUSCO [9], respectively. For the annotation process, Prokka [10] is called to identify genomic features of interest in the assembled genome. Functional annotation is then performed with eggNOG-mapper [11] which combines HMMER [12], DIAMOND [13], MMSEQS2 [14], and PRODIGAL [15] to search against several databases including Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) [16], Gene Ontology (GO) [17], Protein family (PFAM) [18], and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [19]. Next, the downstream analysis to identify pathogenic-related genes starts by running the ABRicate pipeline (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate/; accessed on 5 May 2023) to search against several databases including the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) [20], ResFinder [21], Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation (ARG-ANNOT) [22], MEGARes [23], Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) [24], PlasmidFinder [25], and ISfinder [26]. Carbohydrateactive enzymes (CAZyme) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) are then searched via automated CAZyme annotation [27,28] and CRISPRCasFinder [29], respectively. A pan-genome analysis was then performed by Roary [30] to identify the core and accessory genes from a collection of assembled genomes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of core genes are called by SNP-sites [31] and constructed the phylogenetic tree using FastTree [32]. All analysis reports are finally generated by combining all results into web format and Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. The overall bioinformatics workflow is presented in Figure 1."

The qualified genomes of 10 isolates were deposited into the NCBI GenBank, except for the PA020, ST028, and ST036 isolates. Although the unqualified genomes existed in these 3 isolates, they were still included here as examples. The isolates were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) from Prince of Songkla University, Thailand\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1769 5 of 14\n(reference number: 64\u2013284-14\u20131, date of approval: 9 June 2021). A. baumannii is a Gramnegative, rod-shaped, and aerobic bacterium that commonly causes hospital-acquired infection, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) and among critically ill patients [33]. It has gained notoriety for its remarkable ability to acquire resistance to multiple antibiotics, especially carbapenem, through several mechanisms [33]. Moreover, their genetic materials, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence-associated genes (VAGs), could be transferred between the genus and other Gram-negative bacteria [34]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD) have classified carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. as an urgent threat level [35]. Thus, the entire genome of this pathogen is necessary to be sequenced, which may provide more understanding of the genetic features related to its molecular evolution.\n3.2.1. Quality Control\nAccording to the analysis workflow (Figure 1), quality control was initially performed to verify the raw reads. The reports exhibited total sequences, sequences flagged as poor quality, sequence length, %GC, total deduplicated percentage, average sequence length, basic statistics, Per base sequence quality, Per sequence quality scores, Per base sequence content, Per sequence GC content, Per base N content, sequence length distribution, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and adapter content (Table S1). The results were reported as quantity or quality (pass, warn, and fail).

We found that assembly of the ST036 genome provided a high number (n = 818) of total contigs, which generally indicates a more fragmented assembly. It means that the genome was not fully reconstructed into large, contiguous sequences but rather fragmented into numerous smaller pieces. This may occur due to various reasons, including repetitive or complex regions in the genome, sequencing errors, low coverage depth, or difficulties in resolving repetitive sequences [37]. However, a high number of contigs might be acceptable for some applications, such as comparative genomic analysis or identification of gene families; it is often desirable to have fewer contigs for a more complete and accurate representation of the genome. We also found that the PA020 and ST028 genomes consist of 9,243,789 bp and 9,539,281 bp, which is over the common length (approximately 3.7\u20134.4 bp) of the A. baumannii genome [38].

Additionally, Prokka also provided a GFF (General Feature Format) file that can be used as an input file in Roary for pan-genome analysis.\n3.2.3. Antibiotic Resistance, Also including Plasmids and Virulence Factors\nFor the identification of acquired ARGs, we provided an analysis against various databases in the ABRicate pipeline, including National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), CARD, ResFinder, ARG-ANNOT, and MEGARes. Plasmid makers, VAGs, and sequence type (ST) could be also investigated, and their results were reported together with antibiotic resistance on the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. In our case study, we reported the results of ARGs, plasmids, and VAGs, as illustrated in Figures 6\u20138. We found that all clinical isolates of CRAB carried the genes that encoded for antibiotic efflux pumps conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone (abaQ and abeM), macrolide (amvA and abeS), and tetracycline (adeA, adeB, adeL, adeR, and adeS) (Figure 6). They also carried the genes that encoded for resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) antibiotic efflux pump conferring multidrug resistance to tetracycline and fluoroquinolone (adeF, adeG, and\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1769 7 of 14\nadeH) and to rifamycin, diaminopyrimidine, penem, carbapenem, phenicol, tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, fluoroquinolone, and cephalosporin (adeI, adeJ, adeK, and adeN). In addition, antibiotic target alteration conferring aminoglycoside resistance (armA) and antibiotic inactivation (e.g., blaOXA-23, blaNDM-1, blaCARB-16, aph(3\u201d)-Ib, aph(6\u2019)-Id, mphE, msrE, fosA6, and so on) were also detected in a high number of these CRAB isolates. Plasmid identification revealed that three plasmids, including IncFIA(HI1)_1_HI1, IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3, and IncFII_1_pKP91, were only observed in the ST028 isolate (Figure 7). These plasmids, which have been classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids, are commonly found in the Enterobacterales family, particularly Salmonella spp. and Klebsiella spp. [39\u201342], implying that the ST028 isolate may be contaminated with Salmonella spp. and/or Klebsiella spp. In virulence factor detection, we found that thiol-activated cytolysin gene (BAS3109), cytotoxin K (cytk), immune inhibitor A (inhA), hemolytic enterotoxin HBL complex genes (hblA, hblC, and hblD), and non-hemolytic enterotoxin genes (nheA, nheB, and nheC) were only harbored by the PA020 isolate (Figure 8). Enterotoxin genes (entA, entB, and fepC), outer membrane protein A gene (ompA), and adhesive virulence genes (yagV/ecpE, yagW/ecpD, yagX/ecpC, yagY/ecpB, yagZ/ecpA, and ykgK/ecpR) were only harbored by the ST028 isolate.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 14\nprovided a GFF (General Feature Format) file that can be used as an input file in Roary for pan-genome analysis.\nTable 1.

Comparative Analysis\nIn comparative genomic analysis, we provided Roary for analyzing pan-genome profiles among the studied genomes, which provide valuable insights into the genetic complexity and adaptability of species, helping us better understand their biology and evolution. For our case study, we found that 2509 (14.22%) core genes and 15,135 (85.78%) accessory genes were observed from 17,644 pan genes (Figure 9). Contaminant sequences in the PA020 and ST028 genomes resulted in the presence of high-level accessory genes existing in the pan-genome profile. The uncommon presence of these accessory genes\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1769 8 of 14\ncould also be observed from the results of genome annotation and downstream analysis. In general, a large proportion of accessory genes in a pan-genome analysis can be indicative of an open pan genome, suggesting substantial genetic diversity within the studied population or species [43]. This observation further suggests the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, facilitating the acquisition of novel genes from different isolates, species, or organisms [44,45]. Such pan-genome analysis provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of the species, including ongoing speciation processes and the existence of subpopulations harboring distinct gene sets [44,45].

Meanwhile, CRISPRCasFinder reported the location of CRISPR-Cas systems (bacterial adaptive immune system), which included the sequences of direct repeats and spacers as well as the types of Cas gene groups. The presence of this system could imply the adaptive evolution of the studied genomes to foreign genetic elements, especially bacteriophage genomes [49]. This tool is good for bacterial evolution study as well, as it could be the model of genetic engineering [50,51]. Furthermore, the identification of bacteriocin-encoding genes and restriction\u2013modification (R-M) sites will be implemented in the future versions of BacSeq."

            "text": "Long-read WGS is commonly beneficial for studying the complete genome of particular bacteria because it can be used to distinguish bacterial chromosome(s) and plasmids. The analytical steps in BacSeq were almost similar, except for genome assembly. Here, we used Unicycler for assembling the bacterial genome using both SRS and LRS data with a hybrid assembly method. The complete genome probably includes the chromosome and plasmids, which can be separated into distinct contigs or fragments. The separation of chromosome and plasmid sequences within a complete genome assembly enhances the understanding of the bacterial genomic structures, facilitates comparative genomics studies, enables functional analysis of plasmid-borne elements, and supports various applications in genetic engineering and biotechnology."

However, the main limitation of BacSeq is that when the user runs the program and contaminant sequences occur in the analysis, the program cannot exclude contaminating sequences from the studied genome. We suggest using Kraken [52] or other tools to identify the contaminated sequences and remove them from the analysis, as demonstrated in our previous study [38]. Nevertheless, we recommend that the researcher avoid the contamination in the bacterial culture and pick a single isolated pure colony for genomic DNA extraction before performing WGS and bioinformatics analysis. This limitation will be addressed in future versions of BacSeq."
