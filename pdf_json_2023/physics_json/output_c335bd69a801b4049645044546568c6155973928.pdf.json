    "abstractText": "This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of dual-layer sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone (SPPSu) nanocomposite hollow fiber nanofiltration membranes incorporating titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles through the phase inversion technique. Advanced tools and methods were employed to systematically evaluate the properties and performance of the newly developed membranes. The investigation primarily centered on the impact of TiO2 addition in the SPPSu inner layer on pure water permeability and salt rejection. The nanocomposite membranes exhibited a remarkable three-fold increase in pure water permeability, achieving a flux of 5.4 L/m2h.bar compared to pristine membranes. The addition of TiO2 also enhanced the mechanical properties, with an expected tensile strength increase from 2.4 to 3.9 MPa. An evaluation of salt rejection performance using a laboratory-scale filtration setup revealed a maximal rejection of 95% for Mg2SO4, indicating the effective separation capabilities of the modified dual-layer hollow fiber nanocomposite membranes for divalent ions. The successful synthesis and characterization of these membranes highlight their potential for nanofiltration processes, specifically in selectively separating divalent ions from aqueous solutions, owing to their improved pure water flux, mechanical strength, and salt rejection performance.",

            "text": "Water scarcity has become a critical global issue impacting numerous regions worldwide. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and climate change have exacerbated the demand for clean and fresh water, while the availability of freshwater resources continues to diminish. This escalating water scarcity necessitates innovative solutions to address the challenge and ensure sustainable water management practices [1\u20134]. Membrane technology has emerged as a crucial tool in tackling water scarcity by offering efficient and effective water treatment and purification solutions. Membrane-based processes provide several advantages, including high efficiency, low energy consumption, and the ability to remove contaminants at the molecular level [3]. These processes find extensive application in desalination, wastewater treatment, and water reuse. Among the various membrane configurations, hollow-fiber membranes have gained significant attention in academia and industry due to their inherent advantages, including a large surface area per unit volume, favorable mechanical strength, and ease of handling. However, the performance of conventional hollow-fiber membranes requires further improvement to achieve highly selective separation while maintaining enhanced thermal and mechanical stability [5\u201312].\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714. https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13080714 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 2 of 21\nIn response to these challenges, researchers have directed their focus towards the development of dual-layer hollow-fiber (DLHF) membranes, which offer the potential for a selective surface layer with a mixed matrix. This unique characteristic enables highly selective separation while maintaining excellent mechanical strength, allowing for long-term operation without fiber failure or significant deterioration. Recent studies have demonstrated successful applications of DLHF membranes in various separation processes [13\u201315]. The fabrication of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes has garnered considerable interest due to its numerous advantages, including low material cost, favorable thermal and mechanical stability, and the ability to optimize membrane performance using high-performance selective layers [12,16\u201318]. Notable advancements in this field include the work of Liu et al. [15], who reported the fabrication of a dual-layer hollow-fiber membrane using poly(styrene-b4-vinylpyridine)-based (PS4VP-based) and poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based (PVDF-based) materials. The membrane was fabricated using block copolymer self-assembly through non-solvent induced phase separation, resulting in a highly ordered isoporous surface and excellent mechanical strength. Furthermore, dual-layer nanocomposite hollow fiber membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES) and PVDF, incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), have been successfully fabricated using a two-step thermally induced phase separation/non-solvent induced phase separation (TIPS/NIPS) process. These membranes exhibited the ability to withstand high pressures with relatively low membrane compaction, making them suitable for ultrafiltration applications. The fabrication of novel dual-layer hollow-fiber membranes using a single-step co-extrusion technique has also been explored by Dzinun et al. [19]. These membranes incorporated immobilized titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in their outer layer, exhibiting favorable interfacial adhesion and well-dispersed TiO2 particles. Comparative studies revealed the superior mechanical strength of DLHF membranes compared to flat sheet cellulose acetate (CA) membranes, with smaller pore sizes in the outer layer of the hollow-fiber membranes. Additionally, dual-layer hollow-fiber membranes based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) and PES materials have demonstrated high rejection rates for heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and chromium, as reported by Zhu et al. [14]. These advancements highlight the progress made in the field of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes, showcasing the potential for enhanced membrane performance and the utilization of various functional materials to achieve specific separation requirements. Polyphenylsulfone (PPSu) stands out as an especially promising membrane material for ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and forward osmosis. PPSu possesses desirable characteristics, including ease of membrane formation and favorable thermal and mechanical stability, making it an ideal choice for membrane materials [20]. Moreover, PPSu exhibits superior properties compared to commonly used materials like polysulfone (PSf) and polyether sulfone (PES). Furthermore, the relatively low cost of PPSu resin enhances its appeal as an alternative for next-generation membrane preparation. However, similar to PSf and PES, PPSu is prone to fouling due to its hydrophobic nature. Fouling not only increases the frequency of membrane cleaning and energy expenditure required to maintain productivity but also necessitates larger membrane areas and frequent membrane replacements. Therefore, alternative approaches must be explored to develop more hydrophilic membranes through chemical modification, surface membrane functionalization, and incorporation of nanoparticles within the membrane matrix (MMM) [21\u201324]. The incorporation of different nanomaterials in polymer matrices has gained significant attention due to their ability to impart unique properties to the resulting polymer nanocomposites. Various types of nanomaterials have been explored for their incorporation, including carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, metallic nanoparticles such as silver (Ag) and gold (Au), metal oxide nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), and clay nanoparticles like montmorillonite (MMT) and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). Each of these nanomaterials offers distinct characteristics that can be beneficially transferred to the polymer matrix [25\u201331].\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 3 of 21\nThe incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into polymer matrices has gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential for synergistic effects in various applications. In particular, the combination of TiO2 nanoparticles with SPPSu polymer presents a promising strategy for improving the performance of membranes. The synergy between TiO2 nanoparticles and SPPSu polymer arises from their complementary properties and functionalities. TiO2 nanoparticles offer advantages such as high surface area, photocatalytic activity, and enhanced mechanical strength, while SPPSu polymer provides excellent ion exchange capacity and thermal stability. By combining these two components, it is possible to exploit their individual strengths and achieve enhanced membrane properties, including improved water permeability, selectivity, fouling resistance, and stability. This introduction aims to provide an overview of the potential synergistic effects resulting from the combination of TiO2 nanoparticles with SPPSu polymer and highlights the importance of understanding their interactions and optimized integration in membrane systems. Various researchers have presented SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD analyses of well-known TiO2 nanoparticles [32\u201334]. The main objective of this work is to design and fabricate dual-layer sulfonated polyphenylsulfone nanocomposite hollow fiber nanofiltration membranes for high-efficiency salt separation. By incorporating innovative strategies such as chemical modification, surface membrane functionalization, and nanoparticle loading within the inner surface of membrane matrix, these membranes aim to enhance their hydrophilicity, surface charge, surface morphology, and achieve high-efficiency salt separation. The purpose of choosing a TiO2 incorporated PPSu/SPPSu dual-layer structure in our study is to capitalize on the unique properties and synergistic benefits offered by these two materials. Firstly, PPSu is known for its excellent mechanical strength, thermal stability, and chemical resistance. It is widely used in various applications where robustness and durability are crucial factors. By incorporating PPSu as one of the layers in our dual-layer structure, we aim to enhance the overall mechanical integrity and long-term stability of the membrane. On the other hand, SPPSu is a sulfonated variant of PPSu, which possesses ion-exchange properties due to the presence of sulfonic acid groups. These ion-exchange characteristics make SPPSu suitable for various applications in the field of membrane technology, particularly in water treatment. By utilizing SPPSu as the second layer in our dual-layer structure, we introduce the potential for ion selectivity and facilitated transport of specific ions or molecules through the membrane. The combination of PPSu and SPPSu in a dual-layer structure allows us to harness the strength and stability of PPSu while incorporating the ion-exchange properties of SPPSu. This design strategy aims to optimize the membrane\u2019s performance by achieving a balance between mechanical robustness and ion selectivity. Furthermore, the dual-layer structure provides additional advantages such as the prevention of delamination between layers, improved adhesion, and enhanced overall membrane integrity."

Initially, predried PPSu was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) by constant stirring. The chloro sulfonic acid was slowly added to the DCM solution over a period of 2 h at 0 \u25e6C using a dropping funnel. The resulting solution, which became viscous, was further stirred for 2 h at room temperature. To precipitate the SPPSu, the viscous polymer solution was treated with ethanol, and the resulting precipitate was thoroughly washed until the pH reached 7. The obtained white precipitate of SPPSu was then dried for 24 h in a vacuum oven. To modify the SPPSu, it was re-dissolved in NMP, and an excess amount of sodium methoxide was added. The mixture was continuously stirred for 3 h to allow for the reaction to take place. The sodium salt of SPPSu was then re-precipitated in distilled water and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven. The resulting dried SPPSu exhibited a highly crystalline structure, making it suitable for the preparation of hollow-fiber membranes and blend nanocomposite hollow-fiber membranes [35]. This synthesized sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone offers additional properties beyond those of the polyphenylenesulfone polymer. The highly crystalline nature of the SPPSu ensured its stability and enhanced performance in subsequent membrane fabrication processes. The incorporation of additional sulfone functional groups into the PPSU polymer matrix expands its potential applications and facilitates further customization of the resulting membranes, enabling tailoring to specific requirements. Overall, this synthesis process laid the foundation for the preparation of hollow-fiber membranes and blend nanocomposite hollow-fiber membranes with improved properties and performance."

First, PPSu, SPPSu, and TiO2 nanopowder were dried overnight at 60 \u25e6C in a vacuum oven to eliminate moisture content. The concentrations of the dope solutions were determined based on the viscosity\u2013concentration profile. A 24 wt% PPSu solution was chosen as the outer dope solution, while a 22 wt% SPPSu solution was used as the inner dope solution [36]. For the inner dope solution, TiO2 was dispersed in NMP and sonicated for 40 min using a Branson digital probe sonicator. After sonication, the TiO2 dispersion was mixed with the SPPSu polymer solution. The outer dope solution was prepared by dissolving PPSu polymer in NMP solvent and subsequently incorporating PEG-600 directly into the solution. The specific blend compositions are provided in Table 1. Both mixtures were stirred at 70 \u25e6C for 24 h to achieve a homogeneous solution and subsequently degassed in a sealed container for 12 h to remove any trapped air bubbles.\nDuring the spinning process, a bore fluid composed of a 9:1 ratio of double distilled water and NMP was used. Tap water served as the external coagulant. Hollow-fiber membranes were prepared using a hollow fiber spinning line from Delta, Via Pietro Bucci,\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 5 of 21\nCubo, Italy. The spinning process involved employing triple-orifice spinnerets and a spinning machine, and spinning conditions of dual-layer hollow-fiber membranes provided in Table 2. The spun hollow-fiber membranes were then immersed in a water bath for 24 h to remove residual solvent. To improve membrane wettability and prevent pore collapse, the membranes underwent post-treatment using a 20% glycerol solution for 1 h. Following post-treatment, the membranes were dried at room temperature for 72 h before module fabrication.\nFor module preparation, defect-free hollow fibers (100 in total) were selected. These hollow fibers were wrapped with a polymeric mesh and inserted into acrylic-based modules. The ends of the module were sealed using epoxy resin. Freshly prepared epoxy resin was poured onto the module through the permeate pathway. The module was shaken thoroughly and then dried."

The angular frequency (\u03c9) of the rheometer was set in the range of 0.01 to 100 rad/s to obtain the necessary rheological parameters and viscosity values. All experiments were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent any unwanted reactions or interactions.\n2.5. Membrane Characterization 2.5.1. Morphological Studies\nThe cross-sectional morphology of the prepared DLHF membrane was analyzed using a JEOL instrument from Akishima, Tokyo, Japan through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Prior to imaging, the membrane samples were allowed to air dry to remove any surface water. The dried samples were then fractured under cryogenic conditions using liquid nitrogen and further dried at a temperature of 21 \u25e6C. To enhance the electrical conductivity of the polymeric membranes for SEM imaging, a thin layer of gold was sputtered onto the sample surface. The SEM images were captured under a high vacuum environment at an operating voltage of 5\u201315 kV, depending on the specific characteristics of the sample being analyzed. This allowed for detailed visualization and examination of the cross-sectional structure of the dual-layer nanocomposite hollow fibers. The SEM images provided insights into the internal morphology, layer arrangement, and overall integrity of the membranes. Furthermore, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Bruker, San Jose, CA, USA, was employed to characterize the surface features of the membranes, such as texture and roughness. Surface imaging was conducted in tapping mode at ambient temperature using a silicon (Si) tip. The AFM measurements were performed with a scan frequency of 0.999 Hz using the 6.13 Veeco NanoScope V MultiMode software. The scan ranges for surface roughness and structure analysis were set at 5 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m and 500 \u00d7 500 nm, respectively. By utilizing AFM, the topography and surface properties of the DLHF could\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 6 of 21\nbe examined at a nanoscale level, providing information about the surface roughness, texture, and any potential surface modifications or enhancements. The surface elemental compositions of the membranes were quantified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a JEOL JPS-9030 instrument from Akishima, Tokyo, Japan. For the analysis of nanocomposite membrane samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) with high-intensity Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The measurements were performed on oriented samples, scanning over an angle range from 10\u25e6 to 60\u25e6.\n2.5.2. Measurement of Membrane Zeta Potential\nThe zeta potential of a manufactured hollow fiber (HF) membrane (inner surface) was measured using the tangential streaming potential method using a SurPASS\u201d electrokinetic analyzer (Anton Paar, GmbH, Graz, Austria). The membrane sample was preserved to a length of 5 mm and put into a sample holder of HF membrane with a diameter of 1.4 mm. The zeta potential of the inner surface of a hollow fiber membrane as a function of pH was calculated using a 1 mM KCl electrolyte solution. SurPASS\u2019s in-built titration device has been used to test the streaming potential under various pH conditions ranging from pH 6 to pH 2. In addition, the pH of the electrolyte solution was adjusted using a titration device and 0.05 M HCl and 0.05 M NaOH. Finally, Attract\u00ae software estimated zeta potential from streaming potential readings using the Fairbrother and Mastin (F-M) equation provided in Equation (1):\n\u03b6 = \u2206U \u2206p \u00d7 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u00d7 \u03b50 \u00d7 L D\n(1)\nwhere \u2206U and \u2206P are streaming potential (mV), applied pressure (Pa), and L and D are the channel length (m) as well cross section area (m2), respectively.\n2.5.3. Porosity and Contact Angle Measurement\nThe porosity of the hollow fibers is determined by soaking the membranes in kerosene for 2 days. The residual kerosene on the surface of the hollow fibers will be removed by blotting with tissue paper. The mass of the membranes before and after immersing in kerosene will be obtained using a digital microbalance. The porosity of the membranes (\u03b5) is defined as the pore volume divided by the total volume of the membrane as follows:\n\u03b5(%) = WW \u2212 WD \u03c1 . A . lm \u00d7 100 (2)\nwhere WW represents the weight of the wet membrane, WD represents the weight of the dry membrane, A represents the membrane effective area (m2), \u03c1 represents the water density (0.998 gcm\u22123), and lm represents the membrane thickness (m). The contact angle of the hollow-fiber membranes was measured by the sessile drop technique. Ten different locations had their contact angles measured, and the average results were then given. The drop-shape analysis system was entirely automated, and the contact angles were measured.\n2.5.4. Thermal and Mechanical Properties of the Membranes\nA Thermogravimetric analyzer (Giessen, Germany, METTLER) was used to monitor the degradation temperature while heating the manufactured hollow-fiber membranes at a rate of 10 \u25e6C min\u22121 in order to examine their thermal stability. The Double column Lloyd (UTM 5KN Model LR5K Plus, USA) was used to test the mechanical parameters of the hollow fibers at room temperature, including extension at break, tensile strain, and the Young\u2019s modulus. In order to obtain reliable findings, at least five membrane samples per membrane were analyzed.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 7 of 21\n2.5.5. Performances of the Membranes\nThe pure water flux through the membranes will be determined by measuring the time required for the permeation of a specific amount of water. The flux of water will be calculated using the following formula:\nJw = V At = Q A\u2206t (3)\nwhere Jw is the water flux (L/m2 h); Q is the quantity of water permeated (l); \u2206t is the sampling time (h); and A is the membrane area (m2). Water permeability (Wp) was determined by calculating the slope of the linear relationship between the water flux and the transmembrane pressure (\u2206P), as described by the following formula:\nWp = Jw \u2206P\n(4)\nThe rejection performances of the membrane module were evaluated using a crossflow system operating in total recycle mode. Two distinct salt solutions, Na2SO4 and MgSO4, were prepared with an identical concentration of 500 ppm. The experiments were conducted at a pressure of 3 bar and neutral pH conditions. Solute rejection was determined by calculating the ratio between the permeate concentration (Cp) and the feed concentration (Cf) using Equation (5). The concentrations of the feed and permeate samples were analyzed using Ion Chromatography (ICS 5000-DIONEX, Ramsey, MN, USA) to determine the rejection ability of the membrane module.\nRejection% = 1 \u2212 Cp Cf \u00d7 100 (5)\nAll experiments were conducted three times to minimize errors, and the average values were calculated. In order to ascertain the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the membrane, we utilized a PEG solution with a concentration of 1.0 g/L. More specifically, PEG with different molecular weights spanning from 200 to 1000 Da was selected for the experiments. The concentrations of PEG present in both the feed and permeate solutions were determined using a Sievers 5310 C total organic carbon analyzer, which is manufactured by GE Analytical Instruments, Boston, MA, USA. Subsequently, the rejection of the PEG solution was calculated using Equation (4)."

            "text": "The performance of membranes is greatly influenced by their surface properties, particularly porosity and hydrophilicity. In a study, these properties were investigated using overall porosity and contact angle measurements, and the results are presented in Figure 5. When examining the overall porosity, it was observed that the inclusion of TiO2 nanoparticles in the SPPSu/PPSu DLHF nanocomposite membranes led to a significant increase in porosity compared to the pure SPPSu/PPSu membrane. The addition of TiO2 resulted in an increase in the void volume within the substructure of the fibers, as evidenced by morphological studies. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles in the membrane formulation appears to play a significant role in the formation of a more porous membrane structure. The incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles likely influences the phase separation process during membrane fabrication, leading to increased pore formation. TiO2 nanoparticles can act as nucleation sites for pore formation, facilitating the creation of void spaces within the membrane matrix. Additionally, the interaction between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix can induce phase separation and enhance the demixing of the polymer solution, further promoting the development of a porous structure. The increased porosity offers advantages such as improved permeability and enhanced surface area, which are beneficial for various applications, including filtration and separation processes. Further characterization and analysis are required to elucidate the specific mechanisms and interactions between TiO2 nanoparticles and the polymer matrix to optimize and tailor the porous membrane structure for specific applications. The contact angle of the DLHF membrane, which indicates its hydrophilicity, exhibited a gradual decrease with increasing TiO2 content in the SPPSu/PPSu DLHF inner surface. This can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of TiO2, which is attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups on its surface. As the amount of TiO2 increased, more hydroxyl groups were available to interact with the surrounding water molecules, leading to a decrease in the contact angle and an increase in hydrophilicity. However, it should be noted that the hydrophilicity of the membrane decreased when the TiO2 content exceeded 1.0 wt%. This can be explained by the increased roughness and irregular positioning of the TiO2 particles within the membrane structure. These factors hindered the exposure of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the membrane, resulting in a reduction in hydrophilicity. In summary, the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles to the SPPSu/PPSu nanocomposite DLHF membranes enhanced their overall porosity and hydrophilicity. The increased porosity observed in the fiber substructure can be attributed to the greater void volume present within it. Porosity refers to the percentage of void spaces or empty areas within a material, and it directly affects properties such as permeability, mechanical strength, and surface area. In the case of the fiber substructure, the presence of more void spaces indicates a higher porosity level. This could be a result of various factors, including the arrangement and packing of fibers, interstitial gaps between fibers, or the incorporation of porogens or sacrificial materials during the fabrication process. The increased void volume contributes to the overall porosity, allowing for enhanced fluid flow, increased surface area for adsorption or reaction, and potentially improved mechanical flexibility. Understanding and controlling the void volume within the fiber substructure are crucial for tailoring the material\u2019s properties to specific applications. Furthermore, the results obtained for the MWCO (Figure 5b) clearly illustrate a substantial improvement in pore characteristics following the incorporation of TiO2 into the inner surface of the SPPSu/PPSu DLHF membrane. The membrane comprising SPPSu/PPSu exhibits an MWCO of approximately 1000 Da. However, with the inclusion of SPPSu-TiO2 (2.0 wt%)/PPSu, SPPSu-TiO2 (1.0 wt%)/PPSu, and SPPSu-TiO2 (0.50 wt%)/PPSu, the MWCO is notably reduced to a range between 300 and 600 Da. This modification of the membrane\u2019s pore structure holds immense significance as it directly influences the membrane\u2019s performance concerning solute rejection and flux.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 13 of 21Membranes 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 21\nMembranes 2023, 13, 714 14 of 21"

Mg2SO4 rejection and flux performance of prepared DLHF membranes.\nFigures 9 and 10 showed results of Mg2SO4 and Na2SO4 rejections for the prepared DLHF membranes. The rejection mechanism of the nanocomposite DLHF membranes can be explained by several phenomena. Firstly, the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles in the inner layer introduces additional tortuous pathways for solute transport, resulting in increased diffusion path lengths and improved rejection. This can be attributed to the increased surface area of the membranes and the resulting longer diffusion paths, which hinder the passage of salt ions. Secondly, the TiO2 nanoparticles may contribute to the formation of a more compact and dense membrane structure, leading to reduced pore size and increased selectivity. The enhanced rejection can also be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the salt ions, as TiO2 is known to possess surface charges that can facilitate the rejection of charged species. Furthermore, the nanocomposite DLHF membranes demonstrated comparable permeation flux to that of pure water flux, indicating minimal flux decline due to the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles.\nFigure 9.

The water permeability increased with the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles, attributed to their hydrophilic nature and the modifications in membrane morphology. The rejection performance of the nanocomposite membranes was evaluated using Na2SO4 and MgSO4 as model salts. The incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles in the inner layer of the nanocomposite membranes resulted in higher rejection percentages for both salts compared to the pure membrane. The rejection increased with increasing TiO2 content, indicating an improved salt rejection performance. Overall, the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into SPPSu/PPSu DLHF membranes enhanced their structural, surface, thermal, mechanical, water permeability, and rejection properties. These findings provide valuable insights for the development and optimization of DLHF membranes with enhanced performance for various applications, including water treatment and desalination.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.A. and A.K.S.; methodology, J.A.; software, A.K.S.; validation, J.A. and A.K.S.; formal analysis, L.A.; investigation, A.K.S. and J.A.; resources, M.A.; data curation, J.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.A. and A.K.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.A. and A.K.S.; visualization, J.A. and M.A.; supervision, M.A.; project administration, J.A.; funding acquisition, J.A. and L.A.
