1. **Investigate the impact of different types of relational cohesion on knowledge acquisition performance.** This study focused on two types of relational cohesion: alliance duration and investment commitment. Future research could explore other types of relational cohesion, such as trust, reciprocity, and shared values, and examine how they influence knowledge acquisition performance.


2. **Examine the moderating role of firm-specific factors on the relationship between network configuration and knowledge acquisition performance.** This study did not consider the role of firm-specific factors, such as firm size, age, and industry, on the relationship between network configuration and knowledge acquisition performance. Future research could investigate how these factors moderate the effects of network configuration on knowledge acquisition performance.


3. **Explore the impact of network configuration on other organizational outcomes, such as innovation performance and competitive advantage.** This study focused on knowledge acquisition performance as the outcome of interest. Future research could examine how network configuration influences other organizational outcomes, such as innovation performance, competitive advantage, and financial performance.


4. **Investigate the dynamics of network configuration over time.** This study adopted a static view of network configuration, assuming that it remains constant over time. Future research could take a dynamic perspective and examine how network configuration changes over time and how these changes affect knowledge acquisition performance.


5. **Conduct comparative studies of network configuration in different industries or countries.** This study focused on the pharmaceutical industry. Future research could conduct comparative studies of network configuration in different industries or countries to examine how industry-specific or country-specific factors influence the relationship between network configuration and knowledge acquisition performance.
