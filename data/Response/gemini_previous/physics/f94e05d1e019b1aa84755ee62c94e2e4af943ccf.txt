1. **Investigate the use of IR spectroscopy for the early detection of oral cancer.** IR spectroscopy has been shown to be effective in detecting changes in the chemical composition of saliva in patients with oral cancer. Future research could focus on developing a non-invasive IR spectroscopy-based test for the early detection of oral cancer. This could involve collecting saliva samples from patients with oral cancer and healthy controls and using IR spectroscopy to identify spectral biomarkers that are associated with the disease.


2. **Explore the use of IR spectroscopy for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.** IR spectroscopy has been shown to be effective in detecting changes in the chemical composition of saliva in patients with infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 and neonatal sepsis. Future research could focus on developing IR spectroscopy-based tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. This could involve collecting saliva samples from patients with infectious diseases and healthy controls and using IR spectroscopy to identify spectral biomarkers that are associated with the disease.


3. **Investigate the use of IR spectroscopy for the monitoring of chronic diseases.** IR spectroscopy has been shown to be effective in detecting changes in the chemical composition of saliva in patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Future research could focus on developing IR spectroscopy-based tests for the monitoring of chronic diseases. This could involve collecting saliva samples from patients with chronic diseases and healthy controls and using IR spectroscopy to identify spectral biomarkers that are associated with the disease.


4. **Develop portable IR spectrometers for point-of-care testing.** Portable IR spectrometers are devices that can be used to perform IR spectroscopy in a clinical setting. Future research could focus on developing portable IR spectrometers that are small, lightweight, and easy to use. This would make it possible to use IR spectroscopy for the rapid and non-invasive diagnosis of diseases in a clinical setting.


5. **Explore the use of new IR spectroscopy techniques for salivary analysis.** New IR spectroscopy techniques, such as surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, have the potential to provide higher sensitivity and specificity for the analysis of salivary biomolecules. Future research could focus on exploring the use of these techniques for salivary analysis. This could involve developing new methods for sample preparation and analysis and investigating the use of these techniques for the diagnosis of diseases.
