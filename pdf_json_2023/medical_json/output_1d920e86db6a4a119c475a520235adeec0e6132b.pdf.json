    "abstractText": "During the last decade, the CHA2DS2-VASc score has been used for stratifying the mortality risk in both atrial fibrillation (AF) and non-AF patients. However, no previous study considered this score as a prognostic indicator in non-AF patients with mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). All consecutive non-AF patients with mild-to-moderate IPF, diagnosed between January 2016 and December 2018 at our Institution, entered this study. All patients underwent physical examination, blood tests, spirometry, high-resolution computed tomography and transthoracic echocardiography. CHA2DS2-VASc score, Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) index and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were determined in all patients. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, while the secondary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality and rehospitalizations for all causes over mid-term follow-up. 103 consecutive IPF patients (70.7 \u00b1 7.3 yrs, 79.6% males) were retrospectively analyzed. At the basal evaluation, CHA2DS2-VASc score, GAP index and CCI were 3.7 \u00b1 1.6, 3.6 \u00b1 1.2 and 5.5 \u00b1 2.3, respectively. Mean follow-up was 3.5 \u00b1 1.3 yrs. During the follow-up period, 29 patients died and 43 were re-hospitalized (44.2% due to cardiopulmonary causes). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, CHA2DS2-VASc score (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.59\u20132.91) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86\u20130.97) were independently associated with all-cause mortality in IPF patients. CHA2DS2-VASc score (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.39\u20131.99) and LVEF (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90\u20130.98) also predicted the secondary endpoint in the same study group. CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4 was the optimal cutoff for predicting both outcomes. At mid-term follow-up, a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4 predicts an increased risk of all-cause mortality and rehospitalizations for all causes in non-AF patients with mild-to-moderate IPF.",

            "text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, interstitial lung disease of unknown cause, with a median survival of about 2.5\u20135\u00a0years after definite diagnosis [1]. Its prevalence is increasing worldwide [2].\nIn addition to the adverse effects caused by pulmonary fibrosis, IPF patients have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular manifestations, such as pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiac arrhythmias and stroke [3\u20135]. Indeed, after respiratory failure, cardiovascular disease is the second main cause of death in these patients [5].\nFor this reason, it is mandatory to research prognostic indicators that could independently predict the risk of death and/or cardiovascular events in IPF patients.\nDuring the last decade, several biochemical, spirometric, radiological and echocardiographic prognostic indicators [6\u201320] have been separately investigated in IPF patients. In\naddition, a number of clinical scores evaluating comorbid conditions, such as the coronary artery calcification (CAC) score [21], the Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) index [22] and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [23], have been employed for predicting the risk of mortality and/or adverse clinical events in IPF patients.\nGiven the association between IPF and increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events [24], the CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, Hypertension, Age \u2265 75\u00a0years, Diabetes, Stroke/TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65\u201374\u00a0years, and Sex category) score might improve the prognostic risk stratification of these patients. This score, developed by Lip GY et\u00a0al. [25] in 2010, is actually recommended for estimating thromboembolic risk and deciding on anticoagulation therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients [26, 27]. In the last few years, the incremental prognostic role of CHA2DS2-VASc score has been demonstrated in several cardiovascular [28\u201333] and non-cardiovascular diseases [34, 35], irrespective of AF presence.\nWhether the CHA2DS2-VASc score stratifies mortality risk in non-AF patients with mild-to-moderate IPF is unknown and, as far as we know, literature data are missing.\nAccordingly, the present study was primarily designed to investigate whether the CHA2DS2-VASc score can predict the primary outcome of \u201call\u2010cause mortality\u201d over a medium-term follow-up in a consecutive population of IPF patients without severe pulmonary hypertension and with no evidence of AF. The prognostic value of other clinical scores, such as the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly > 65\u00a0years, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) score [36], the CAC score, the GAP index and the CCI was also examined in the same study population."

The amount of CAC was quantified using semiautomatic software (CaScoring, Syngo. via VB30A, Siemens Healthineers). Notably, the software employed a deep-learning approach based on two consecutive convolutional neural networks to detect calcifications and to label them according to the affected vascular bed. In\n1 3\nthis study, the total amount of calcification detected in the coronary arteries (CAC score) was calculated. Only voxels with an intensity of at least 130 Hounsfield unit (HU), which is the standard threshold for calcium scoring, were taken into consideration [40]. The calcified plaques were assigned manually to their respective coronary artery by a mouse click, with a subsequent automatic evaluation of the lesions by a 3D segmentation algorithm."

Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) was derived by the modified Bernoulli equation, where SPAP = 4 x (tricuspid regurgitation velocity)2 + right atrial pressure [37]. The latter was estimated from IVC diameter and collapsibility.\nDegree of valvulopathy was assessed according to the AHA/ACC recommendations for the management of patients with valvular heart disease [43]."

Assuming that IPF patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4 and those with CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2264 4 might have 3-year mortality of 20 and 9%, respectively, a sample size of 103 IPF patients would reach a statistical power of 100% for determining a statistically significant difference between mortality rates, using a two-tailed t test with type I error at 5%.\nFor the whole cohort of IPF patients included, continuous data were summarized as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, while categorical data were presented as number (percentage).\nUnivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the main demographics and anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical predictive scores (expressed as continuous variables), biochemical parameters, ECG and echoDoppler variables and discharge medical treatment, on the occurrence of both primary and secondary endpoints during the follow-up period, in the whole study population. For each variable investigated, correspondent hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Only the variables with the statistically significant association on univariate analysis (p value < 0.05) were thereafter included in the multivariate Cox regression model.\nThe receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for predicting the above-mentioned endpoints. Area under the curve (AUC) was estimated. The optimal cutoff of CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated using the maximum value of the Youden Index (determined as sensitivity + [1-specificity]).\nKaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were designed to measure differences between CHA2DS2-VASc score categories in the rates of \u201call-cause mortality\u201d and \u201call-cause mortality and rehospitalizations for all causes\u201d respectively, over a mid-term follow-up, for the whole study population.\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA), with two-tailed p values below 0.05 deemed statistically significant.\n1 3"

            "text": "Between January 2016 and December 2018, 170 patients referred to our Division of Pneumology received a diagnosis of IPF, confirmed by adopting a multidisciplinary approach: among them, 18 patients with AF and 49 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension were excluded from the present study according to the above-mentioned exclusion criteria. The remaining 103 IPF patients (mean age 70.7 \u00b1 7.3 yrs) were retrospectively analyzed.\nAll clinical parameters recorded in the study population at baseline are summarized in Table\u00a01.\nAs expected, IPF patients were predominantly men (79.6%) with a smoking history (80.6%) and a moderate prevalence of hypertension (57.3%) and dyslipidemia (51.4%). Moreover, they showed a moderate atherosclerotic disease burden, expressed by more than mild carotid artery stenosis in 30.1% of patients, diffuse CAC on HRCT in 48.5% of patients and polidistrectual vasculopathy in 13.6% of patients.\nBlood tests revealed chronic renal failure (eGFR < 60\u00a0ml/ min/1.73 m2) in 16.5% of patients; in addition, the whole series of IPF patients was found with a mild chronic inflammation (serum CRP 1.2 \u00b1 1.6\u00a0mg/dl; normal value < 0.05\u00a0mg/ dl) and a moderate increase in serum NT-proBNP levels (384.8 \u00b1 912.0\u00a0pg/ml; normal value < 125\u00a0pg/ml).\nThe values of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.7 \u00b1 1.6) and HAS-BLED score (2.6 \u00b1 1.7) measured in our study population at baseline suggested a moderate-to-high risk for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, respectively.\nMain non-cardiovascular comorbidities detected in our cohort of IPF patients were GERD, COPD and hypothyroidism; cancers and OSAS were observed less frequently. GAP index was 3.6 \u00b1 1.2, whereas the CCI score was 5.5 \u00b1 2.3, indicating high comorbidity.\nConcerning the pharmacological treatment, less than half of IPF patients were regularly treated with cardioprotective drugs. Notably, oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers and statins were prescribed in only 10.7%, 35.9% and 33% of IPF patients. In addition, 42.7% of IPF patients were in oxygen therapy; approximately one-third of IPF patients (30.1%) received a low dose of oral corticosteroids (< 10\u00a0mg/die); finally, 37.9% and 54.4% of IPF patients were treated with pirfenidone and nintedanib, respectively.\nTable\u00a0 2 lists all instrumental variables detected by HRCT, spirometry, ECG and conventional TTE, respectively, in our cohort of IPF patients, at basal evaluation.\nConcerning the radiological findings, the definite UIP pattern at HRCT was the prevalent pattern (62.1% of cases), followed by a pattern of probable UIP (23.3% of cases), whereas an indeterminate pattern was detected in 14.6% of cases. CAC score at basal evaluation was 768.9 \u00b1 998.4 HU.\nAnalysis of spirometric parameters revealed that FVC (81.8 \u00b1 17.9% of predicted) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (86.0 \u00b1 17.8% of predicted) were slightly impaired, while DLCO (52.0 \u00b1 15.5% of predicted) was moderately reduced. 58.2% of IPF patients had a restrictive pattern. Moreover, IPF patients showed a moderate decrease in pulse oximetry and a moderate reduction in effort tolerance during the 6MWT.\nOn resting ECG, the hear t rate was normal (73.3 \u00b1 11.4\u00a0bpm) and 17.5% of IPF patients had delayed intraventricular conduction.\nConventional TTE examination showed normal biventricular and biatrial cavity chamber sizes. The LV concentric remodeling was the most common LV geometric pattern detected in IPF patients (49.5% of total), followed by normal LV geometry (34.0% of cases); on the other hand, LV concentric hypertrophy (10.7% of cases) and LV eccentric hypertrophy (5.8% of cases) were rarely detected. The great majority of IPF patients (75.7%) had preserved LV systolic function (LVEF \u2265 55%), whereas 25 patients (24.3% of total) presented LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 55%). Among IPF patients with LV systolic dysfunction, the vast majority (23 patients, 92% of total) showed a mild reduction in systolic function (LVEF between 45 and 54%), whereas only two patients had LVEF < 45%. Analysis of LV diastolic function revealed that grade 1 diastolic dysfunction was the most frequently detected LV diastolic filling pattern (95.2% of patients), while a pseudonormal filling pattern of the left ventricle was rarely detected (4.8% of patients). Moreover, left ventricular filling pressures measured in IPF patients were in the gray zone of 8 to 13 (average E/e\u2019 ratio 11.6 \u00b1 3.1). In addition, we observed a low prevalence of valvular heart disease: a more than mild mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation was observed in 14.6% and 7.8% of IPF patients, respectively, while no IPF patient was diagnosed with aortic stenosis. Finally, a mild pulmonary hypertension (TRV 2.9 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0m/sec) was detected in our cohort of IPF patients. Only 23 patients (22.3% of the total) were found with right ventricular systolic dysfunction, expressed by reduced TAPSE (< 20\u00a0mm)."

            "text": "This monocentric study, specifically designed to evaluate the main indicators of adverse clinical outcomes in a consecutive cohort of non-AF patients with mild-to-moderate IPF, demonstrated that: (1) the CHA2DS2-VASc score was independently associated with \u201call-cause mortality\u201d and with the composite of \u201call-cause mortality and rehospitalizations for all causes\u201d in the whole study population, over a medium-term follow-up; (2) the CHA2DS2-VASc score showed an incremental prognostic value over the individual components of the score, over other clinical (GAP, CCI and HAS-BLED) and radiological (CAC) scores and over biochemical predictors, such as RDW, eGFR, CRP and NT-proBNP; (3) IPF patients had a significantly increased prevalence of adverse cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary events; (4) \u201call-cause deaths\u201d were recorded within 4 yrs after hospital discharge in the great majority of IPF patients.\nOur results revealed that a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4 at basal evaluation allowed us to distinguish, among IPF patients, those with an increased probability of all-cause mortality, over a medium-term follow-up. Notably, IPF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4 had about a twofold higher risk of mortality and rehospitalizations for all causes than those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2264 4. This finding could be related to the older age, to the increased prevalence of hypertension, chronic renal failure and congestive clinical signs and to the higher atherosclerotic disease burden detected in most patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4. On the other hand, IPF patients\n1 3\nwith CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2264 4 had a significantly increased probability of event-free survival over the follow-up period.\nLVEF assessed by 2D-TTE examination was another independent prognostic indicator of increased risk of mortality and adverse clinical events in IPF patients.\nComparison with\u00a0other studies and\u00a0interpretation of\u00a0results\nConsistent with the literature data [46\u201348], our findings confirmed the poor prognosis of IPF patients. Indeed, approximately one-third of the IPF patients enrolled (28.1%) died within 4\u00a0years of follow-up.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous study employed the CHA2DS2-VASc score for the mortality risk stratification of a retrospective cohort of IPF patients without severe pulmonary hypertension and no evidence of AF.\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc score was originally developed for stroke risk stratification of nonvalvular AF patients, particularly for detecting patients at low risk who require no antithrombotic therapy [49, 50].\nAlthough current guidelines recommend using the CHA2DS2-VASc score for evaluating embolic risk in AF patients [26, 27], during the last decade this score has been assessed in many categories of patients without AF. Notably, a number of studies have tested the predictive value of CHA2DS2-VASc score for clinical outcomes different from stroke such as death, heart failure hospitalizations and cardiac hospitalizations in various cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases [28\u201335]. In particular, CHA2DS2-VASc score has been strongly associated with major adverse cardiac outcomes in non-AF community populations [28] and in the following categories of non-AF patients: patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome and/or acute myocardial infarction [29]; heart failure patients [30, 31]; patients with arterial hypertension [32]; patients with peripheral artery disease [33]; finally patients with COPD [34] and SARS-CoV-2 [35].\nThe results of our study revealed that approximately two-thirds of rehospitalizations observed in IPF patients during the study period were related to cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary causes.

Secondly, our cohort of IPF patients was undertreated with cardioprotective drugs, especially betablockers and statins. This finding was in alignment with the literature data [51] and with our previous findings [52].\nIn addition, our findings highlighted the high negative predictive value of a CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2264 4 for future major adverse clinical events over the follow-up period, similarly to that observed by previous authors in AF patients [53].\nThe present study also revealed that IPF patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 55%) had an increased risk of both mortality and rehospitalizations during the follow-up period. The impairment in LV systolic function, detected in 24.3% of our cohort of patients, was predominantly of mild degree (LVEF between 45 and 55%). This finding was in alignment with what observed by previous authors [54, 55], which demonstrated the absence of a significant reduction in LVEF in IPF patients at an early stage of the disease; on the other hand, a subclinical myocardial dysfunction, expressed by the early impairment in left ventricular global longitudinal strain [54] and left atrial reservoir strain [55], was detected by\nFig. 1 Prognostic ROC curves and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were drawn to compare the rates of the endpoint \u201call-cause mortality\u201d (Panels A1 and A2) and the endpoint \u201call-cause mortality + rehospitalizations for all causes\u201d (Panels B1 and B2) in IPF patients, categorized according to CHA2DS2-VASc score \u2264 4 and > 4, respectively.\nAUC, area under the curve; CHA2DS2-VASc, Congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, Hypertension, Age \u2265 75\u00a0 years, Diabetes, Stroke/TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65\u201374\u00a0 years, and Sex category; IPF, idiopathic pulmonar fibrosis; ROC, receiver operating characteristics\n1 3\n2D speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) in the same patients."

Moreover, IPF patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score > 4, given the highest cardiovascular risk profile, would need a more intensive treatment of comorbidities, a closer clinical follow-up and/or uptitration of cardioprotective drugs, such as beta-blockers and statins."

However, even if these markers have been identified as having a potential diagnostic and prognostic value in IPF [8\u201311], they are not yet considered applicable for routine risk assessment of these patients."
