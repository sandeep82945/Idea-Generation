The Nse1 subunit in the Smc5/6 complex contains 25\u00a0 a RING domain with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and essential functions in genome 26\u00a0 integrity. However, Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets remain largely unknown. Here, 27\u00a0 we use label-free quantitative proteomics to analyse the nuclear ubiquitinome of 28\u00a0 nse1-C274A RING mutant cells. Our results show that Nse1 impacts on the 29\u00a0 ubiquitination of several proteins involved in DNA damage tolerance, ribosome 30\u00a0 biogenesis and metabolism that, importantly, extend beyond canonical functions of 31\u00a0 the Smc5/6 complex in chromosome disjunction. In addition, our analysis uncovers 32\u00a0 an unexpected connection between Nse1 and RNA polymerase I (RNAP I) 33\u00a0 ubiquitination. Specifically, Nse1 and the Smc5/6 complex promote the ubiquitination 34\u00a0 of K408 and K410 in the clamp domain of Rpa190, a modification that induces its 35\u00a0 degradation in response to blocks in transcriptional elongation. We propose that this 36\u00a0 mechanism contributes to Smc5/6-dependent segregation of the rDNA array, the 37\u00a0 locus transcribed by RNAP I. 38\u00a0\n\u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0 INTRODUCTION 39\u00a0 Post-translational modification of proteins is one of the most frequently used 40\u00a0 mechanisms to control protein function. These modifications can trigger 41\u00a0 conformational changes in the substrate, new interactions, or change the subcellular 42\u00a0 localization and stability of proteins. Ubiquitination can modify proteins through the 43\u00a0 formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin 44\u00a0 (Ub) and the -amino group of a lysine in the target protein 1. Ub itself can also be 45\u00a0 targeted for ubiquitination. To this end, it uses one of its seven lysines as acceptor 46\u00a0 sites, giving rise to a wide diversity of ubiquitin chains and possible signaling modes 47\u00a0 1. Depending on the type of Ub chain decoration of the substrate, ubiquitination may 48\u00a0 signal for proteasomal degradation, DNA repair, protein trafficking or extraction from 49\u00a0 a specific compartment or protein complex. Ubiquitination depends on an enzymatic 50\u00a0 cascade, involving a Ub activating enzyme (E1), a Ub conjugating enzyme (E2) and 51\u00a0 a Ub ligase enzyme (E3). In budding yeast, one E1, eleven E2s and a large family 52\u00a0 of E3 enzymes catalyze the transfer of Ub molecules to specific substrates 2. Protein 53\u00a0 ubiquitination is balanced by ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs), which cleave the 54\u00a0 isopeptide bond between Ub and the target thus reversing the modification 3. 55\u00a0 Although ubiquitination is regulated at multiple levels, E3 enzymes are strategic 56\u00a0 players, as they provide specificity to the ubiquitination reaction. Most E3s catalyze 57\u00a0 the transfer of ubiquitin by bridging the interaction between a Ub-charged E2 enzyme 58\u00a0 and the substrate. The most abundant type of E3 ligases contain RING domains, 59\u00a0 which interact with the E2 and reorient the E2-Ub thioester bond to favor the 60\u00a0 discharge of Ub onto the substrate 4. Proper folding of RING domains requires the 61\u00a0 presence of eight conserved cysteine or histidine residues coordinating two zinc 62\u00a0 atoms in a cross-brace conformation 5. This folding is essential for their E3 activity, 63\u00a0 and mutation of these residues severely affects ubiquitination of their targets. 64\u00a0 Ubiquitination plays crucial roles in DNA repair, by enabling extensive signaling in 65\u00a0 response to DNA damage and replicative stress 6,7. The maintenance of genome 66\u00a0 integrity also requires the action of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosome 67\u00a0 (SMC) complexes, present in all domains of life. SMC complexes use their ATPase 68\u00a0 activity to form loops and organize genomes during chromosome replication, 69\u00a0 segregation and DNA repair. Particularly, the Smc5/6 complex enables chromosome 70\u00a0\n\u00a0 4\u00a0 \u00a0 disjunction by promoting removal of DNA-mediated connections between sister 71\u00a0 chromatids, which mainly arise during DNA replication and recombinational repair 72\u00a0 8,9. 73\u00a0 The Smc5/6 complex is assembled from eight subunits: Smc5 and Smc6, which 74\u00a0 constitute the core of the complex, and six non-SMC subunits (Nse proteins), Nse1 75\u00a0 to Nse6. Unlike other SMC complexes, Smc5/6 contains two RING domains, located 76\u00a0 in the C-terminal part of the Nse1 and Nse2 subunits 10. The RING domain in Nse2 77\u00a0 has SUMO ligase activity, while the RING domain in Nse1 has Ub ligase activity 11\u201378\u00a0 15. Nse1 interacts with Nse3, a member of the highly conserved MAGE (melanoma-79\u00a0 associated antigen) family of proteins through its N-terminal domain. The central part 80\u00a0 of Nse1 associates with Nse4, a member of the kleisin family of SMC subunits 16, to 81\u00a0 form a subcomplex that then binds to the ATPase domain of Smc5 and the neck 82\u00a0 region of Smc6. The C-terminal RING domain in Nse1 homologues (NH-RING) is 83\u00a0 characterized by the presence of a C4HC3 configuration of zinc-coordinating 84\u00a0 residues, closely related to the PHD (Plant Homology) domain and different from the 85\u00a0 conventional C3HC4 consensus found in other E3 RING domains 17. Nse1 proteins 86\u00a0 show other features of Ub E3 ligases, including the capacity to form Ub chains in 87\u00a0 vitro 14,15. In vitro, Nse1 ubiquitinates Nse3 and Nse4, and its E3 ligase activity is 88\u00a0 enhanced by Nse3 14,18,19. In human cells, Nse1 targets Mms19 in an Smc5/6-89\u00a0 independent manner for its ubiquitination and degradation, with relevant implications 90\u00a0 in DNA polymerase function and genome stability 20. However, and differently to 91\u00a0 Nse2, no other in vivo targets for Nse1 have been identified until now. Although the 92\u00a0 NSE1 RING domain is not essential for viability, it contributes to the DNA repair 93\u00a0 functions of the Smc5/6 complex, and nse1 mutant cells carrying mutations in zinc-94\u00a0 coordinating residues show an aberrant morphology and severe growth defects, 95\u00a0 particularly under DNA damaging conditions 17,21,22. 96\u00a0 To fill the gap in our current knowledge of Nse1-dependent Ub targets, we have 97\u00a0 compared the nuclear ubiquitinome of wild type yeast cells and nse1 mutants 98\u00a0 bearing a C274A mutation in the RING domain 21. Our analysis reveals that Nse1 99\u00a0 affects the ubiquitination status of several proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis 100\u00a0 and metabolism, extending beyond canonical functions of the Smc5/6 complex in 101\u00a0 chromosome segregation. Moreover, Nse1 promotes the ubiquitination Rpa190, the 102\u00a0\n\u00a0 5\u00a0 \u00a0 largest subunit in RNA Polymerase I (RNAP I), at K408 and K410, a modification 103\u00a0 that promotes Rpa190 destruction. In addition, we show that this modification is 104\u00a0 triggered by blocks in RNAP I elongation, including those inflicted by UV-light. 105\u00a0 Overall, we propose that Rpa190 ubiquitination clears stalled RNAP I complexes 106\u00a0 from rDNA chromatin to facilitate other chromosomal transactions in this locus. 107\u00a0\n\u00a0 6\u00a0 \u00a0 RESULTS 108\u00a0"

            "text": "To identify Nse1-sensitive ubiquitin sites, we profiled the ubiquitinome of wild type 110\u00a0 and nse1-C274A mutant cells using diGly proteomics 23. The latter are affected in a 111\u00a0 conserved zinc-coordinating cysteine residue in the RING domain 21. As nse1-112\u00a0 C274A mutant cells are sensitive to DNA damage, and to maximize differences with 113\u00a0 their wild type counterpart, exponentially growing cultures were treated with 0.02% 114\u00a0 MMS for 1.5 hours. In addition, we fractionated whole cell extracts into soluble and 115\u00a0 nuclear fractions to reduce the complexity of the sample. Protein extracts from the 116\u00a0 nuclear fraction were trypsinized and peptides containing the signature di-glycine 117\u00a0 remnant from ubiquitin were enriched by immunopurification. Finally, ubiquitinated 118\u00a0 peptides from two biological and two technical replicates were quantified by label-119\u00a0 free mass-spectrometry (Figure 1A)24. We used the flowthrough from the 120\u00a0 immunoprecipitation to quantify the total protein content in the nuclear extract, 121\u00a0 allowing the identification of 3657 proteins (Supplementary Data 1). 62 proteins were 122\u00a0 significantly less expressed (q-value<0.05) and 207 proteins were upregulated in 123\u00a0 nse1 samples (Supplementary Figure 1B). Proteins showing higher expression in 124\u00a0 nse1 mutant cells were enriched in functions related to purine ribonucleotide 125\u00a0 metabolism and cellular respiration (FDR 4.32E-2 and 3.90E-2). One of the proteins 126\u00a0 showing the highest expression in nse1 mutant cells was Leu2, the auxotrophic 127\u00a0 marker used for selection of the nse1-C274A allele, and an internal control for the 128\u00a0 total protein quantitation (Supplementary Figure 1B). Proteins less expressed in the 129\u00a0 nse1 mutant cells were enriched in functions related to amino acid metabolism 130\u00a0 (FDRs 2.84E-06 to 3.60E-02). In addition, three proteins encoded by 2 plasmids 131\u00a0 (Rep1, Rep2 and Raf1) were downregulated in the nse1-C274A mutant, suggesting 132\u00a0 that the mutation might restrict the maintenance of episomal plasmids. Interestingly, 133\u00a0 a recent screen for mutants defective in maintenance of 2 plasmids identified a 134\u00a0 variant in the Nse2 subunit of the Smc5/6 complex 25. 135\u00a0 809 of the proteins in the flowthrough (around 20%) were also found after di-Gly 136\u00a0 immunoprecipitation (Figure 1B). In total, we identified 1932 ubiquitinated sites. The 137\u00a0 nuclear enrichment step used in our protocol most probably accounts for the lower 138\u00a0\n7\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 8\u00a0 \u00a0 form wild type and nse1-C274A mutant cells.

D. Cytoscape Markov cluster analysis of ubiquitin sites significantly downregulated in nse1-162\u00a0 C274A cells. Note the presence of a cluster of (mainly) ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in 163\u00a0 glycolytic functions, RNA polymerase subunits, DNA replication factors and ergosterol biosynthesis 164\u00a0 enzymes. Red circles highlight targets analyzed through ubiquitin pull downs in this study. 165\u00a0 Next, we selected seven potential Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets from different 166\u00a0 subclusters and subjected them to further validation: Rpl24b, a 60S ribosomal 167\u00a0 subunit protein; Cdc73, a component of the Paf1 transcription elongation complex; 168\u00a0 Yhb1, a yeast flavohemoglobin involved in oxidative stress responses; Erg9, also 169\u00a0 known as squalene synthase, an enzyme that participates early in the sterol 170\u00a0 biosynthesis pathway; Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective segregase able to extract 171\u00a0 proteins from larger cellular structures; and Pol30, a replication factor also known as 172\u00a0 sliding clamp or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In addition, we also 173\u00a0 confirmed Nse1-dependent ubiquitination of Rpa190 (see below). Ubiquitination of 174\u00a0 Pol30 at K164 in response to DNA damage has been extensively documented and 175\u00a0 plays important roles in genomic integrity 28. In contrast, the role of Rpl24b, Cdc73, 176\u00a0 Yhb1, Erg9 or Cdc48 ubiquitination is unknown. Each target was tagged with a C-177\u00a0 terminal 6xHA epitope at its endogenous location except Pol30, which was analyzed 178\u00a0 with specific antibodies. Besides, we introduced a multicopy plasmid expressing a 179\u00a0 7xHis tagged version of ubiquitin from the CUP1 promoter. Protein extracts from 180\u00a0 exponentially growing cells treated or not with 0,02% MMS for 1,5 hours were 181\u00a0 prepared under denaturing conditions and ubiquitinated proteins were pulled down 182\u00a0 using NiNTA beads and analyzed by western blot. As shown in Figure 2, 183\u00a0 ubiquitination of targets was either not detectable or severely impaired in nse1-184\u00a0 C274A cells, relative to wild type cells, confirming our proteomic data. For Rpl24b, 185\u00a0 Cdc73 and Erg9, MMS-induced DNA damage had little effect on ubiquitination levels 186\u00a0 (Figure 2A-C). In contrast, treatment of cells with MMS upregulated the ubiquitination 187\u00a0\n\u00a0\n9\u00a0 \u00a0\nOverall, the altered ubiquitin site usage in nse1-C274A mutant cells indicates that 198\u00a0 Nse1 participates in various cellular processes that, importantly, extend beyond 199\u00a0 canonical Smc5/6 functions in chromosome replication, segregation and repair. 200\u00a0\n\u00a0 10\u00a0 \u00a0 Ubiquitination of lysine 408 and 410 modulates Rpa190 function 201\u00a0 Another group of Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets revealed in our data comprises 202\u00a0 RNA polymerase subunits. This cluster includes one subunit of RNAP I (Rpa190), a 203\u00a0 subunit shared by RNAP I and III complexes (Rpc19) and an RNAP III specific 204\u00a0 subunit (Rpc25). The ubiquitin site showing the greatest difference between wild type 205\u00a0 and nse1 mutants is K122 in Rpc19, followed by the double ubiquitination of K408 206\u00a0 and K410 in Rpa190 (Supplementary Figure 2). Of note, Smc5/6, RNAP I and RNAP 207\u00a0 III localize and operate in the rDNA array 29,30, and inactivation of RNAP I alleviates 208\u00a0 the rDNA non-disjunction defects of Smc5/6 thermosensitive mutants 8. Therefore, 209\u00a0 we centered our interest in Rpa190, the largest subunit in RNAP I. 210\u00a0 The K408 and K410 residues are located on top of the clamp module in the RNAP I 211\u00a0 complex (Figure 3A), a region that participates in the transition between the open 212\u00a0 and closed conformation of the polymerase 31,32. Of note, sequence and structure 213\u00a0 alignment of yeast Rpa190 and human Rpa194 indicate that K408 is conserved in 214\u00a0 evolution and is occupied by K350 in the human RNAP I complex (Supplementary 215\u00a0 Figure 3A and 3B) 33. Rpa190 has a prominent ubiquitination band, with an 216\u00a0 electrophoretic mobility equivalent to a mass increase of around 29 KDa, which 217\u00a0 might reflect the addition of 3 ubiquitin molecules (Figure 3A); besides, there are two 218\u00a0 extra fainter bands with a mass increase comparable to the addition of 4 and 6 219\u00a0 ubiquitin molecules, respectively. To study the effect of ubiquitination at K408/K410, 220\u00a0 we mutated both residues to arginine, generating an rpa190-K408R,K410R 221\u00a0 (hereafter referred to as rpa190-KR) allele. This mutant was first expressed from a 222\u00a0 centromeric plasmid in an RPA190/rpa190 diploid strain. Tetrad analysis of the 223\u00a0 progeny showed that rpa190-KR mutants are viable and not affected in growth. Next, 224\u00a0 we integrated the rpa190-KR allele and studied the ubiquitination status of the 225\u00a0 mutant protein using ubiquitin pull downs. As shown in Figure 3B, Rpa190 226\u00a0 ubiquitination is severely impaired in rpa190-KR cells, with almost no ubiquitination 227\u00a0 forms detected in the western blot, indicating that ubiquitin mainly targets K408 and 228\u00a0 K410 in Rpa190. 229\u00a0 Rpa190 is deubiquitinated by the Ubp10 ubiquitin-specific peptidase, preventing its 230\u00a0 proteasomal degradation 34. In accordance, Rpa190 protein levels decreased in 231\u00a0\n\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0 ubp10\u2206 cells (Figure 3C). Remarkably, the rpa190-KR allele restored Rpa190 232\u00a0 protein levels in ubp10\u2206 mutant cells (Figure 3C). To test if Rpa190 protein and 233\u00a0 ubiquitination levels are inversely correlated, we performed ubiquitin pull downs in 234\u00a0 wild type and ubp10\u2206 cells expressing RPA190 or the rpa190-KR alleles from a 235\u00a0 centromeric plasmid. As previously described 34, deletion of UBP10 led to higher 236\u00a0 levels of Rpa190 ubiquitination (Figure 3D), an effect that could be also directly 237\u00a0 detected in protein extracts (Figure 3C). In contrast, ubiquitination was impaired in 238\u00a0 the Rpa190-KR mutant protein, a situation that was more evident in ubp10\u2206 cells 239\u00a0 (Figure 3D). Overall, these results demonstrate that ubiquitination at lysines K408 240\u00a0 and K410 targets Rpa190 for destruction, a process that is normally counteracted 241\u00a0 by the Ubp10 deubiquitinase. 242\u00a0 Next, we explored situations that might promote Rpa190 ubiquitination. Rpa190 243\u00a0 ubiquitination did not change in cells with high (190) or low (25) rDNA copy number 244\u00a0 35, suggesting that the relative number of actively-transcribed copies of rDNA (higher 245\u00a0 in the 25 copy number strain) does not affect Rpa190 ubiquitination (Supplementary 246\u00a0 Figure 4A). rDNA copy number in these strains is maintained through deletion of the 247\u00a0 FOB1 gene, which normally prevents collisions between replication and RNAP I-248\u00a0 dependent transcription, further suggesting that head-on encounters between the 249\u00a0 two machineries are also not responsible for Rpa190 ubiquitination. Rpa190 250\u00a0 ubiquitination did not change at different stages in the cell cycle, monitored by 251\u00a0 arresting cells in G1 with alpha factor, in S phase with hydroxyurea or in G2/M with 252\u00a0 nocodazole (Supplementary Figure 4B). On the other hand, MMS-induced alkylation 253\u00a0 DNA damage slightly increased Rpa190 ubiquitination (Supplementary Figure 4B), 254\u00a0 while irradiation of cells with UV light promoted the accumulation of ubiquitinated 255\u00a0 Rpa190 species (Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure 4B), suggesting that Rpa190 256\u00a0 is modified in response to bulky lesions on DNA, which are most probably 257\u00a0 encountered by RNAP I during transcriptional elongation. However, UV-induced 258\u00a0 ubiquitination was not accompanied by a reduction in Rpa190 protein levels (Figure 259\u00a0 3E). Thus, either UV-dependent Rpa190 ubiquitination does not signal for its 260\u00a0 proteasomal degradation, or only a small pool of stalled RNAP I complexes are 261\u00a0 targeted by ubiquitin for destruction in response to UV damage. In addition, rpa190-262\u00a0 KR mutant cells were not sensitive to UV irradiation or alkylation DNA damage 263\u00a0\n\u00a0\n12\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0 phosphorylated forms. F. Growth test analysis of wild type (wt) and rpa190-KR (KR); 10-fold serial 281\u00a0 dilutions of the liquid cultures were spotted on YPD (up) or YPD with BMH-21 15 M (bottom). G. 282\u00a0 Wild type (wt) and ubp10 cells transformed with a centromeric vector expressing the indicated 283\u00a0 RPA190 alleles were grown overnight in selective media and spotted on YPD (up) or YPD with 15 284\u00a0 M BMH-21 (bottom); pictures were taken after 48 hours. In B, C, D and E, 6xHA-tagged Rpa190 285\u00a0 was detected with anti-HA antibodies; ubiquitinated forms are indicated with a vertical bar. 286\u00a0 To further explore the effects of a transcriptional elongation block on Rpa190 287\u00a0 ubiquitination, we analyzed the sensitivity of rpa190-KR cells to BMH-21, a specific 288\u00a0 inhibitor of RNAP I 36. BMH-21 is a DNA intercalator that inhibits rRNA synthesis, 289\u00a0 promoting the disassembly of the polymerase from the rDNA and the subsequent 290\u00a0 degradation of Rpa190 36,37. Interestingly, rpa190-KR mutant cells were more 291\u00a0 resistant to BMH-21 (Figure 3F). This phenotype was dominant, as expression of an 292\u00a0 rpa190-KR allele from a centromeric vector in wild type cells conferred resistance to 293\u00a0 BMH-21 (Figure 3G). In addition, ubp10\u2206 mutant cells were more sensitive to BMH-294\u00a0 21, as expected from their increased Rpa190 ubiquitination levels. Moreover, ectopic 295\u00a0 expression of an rpa190-KR allele rescued the BMH-21 sensitivity of ubp10\u2206 mutant 296\u00a0 cells, evidencing that K408 and K410 play a pivotal role in the response to BMH-21. 297\u00a0 Overall, our findings indicate that Rpa190 ubiquitination at K408 and K410 regulates 298\u00a0 RNAP I under conditions that prevent transcriptional elongation. 299\u00a0"

The reduction was even more evident after treatment with MMS, conditions 306\u00a0 that increased Rpa190 ubiquitination in wild type cells. In addition, the Rpa190 307\u00a0 ubiquitination impairment was similar in nse1-C274A and rpa190-KR cells 308\u00a0 (Supplementary Figure 5). To analyze the participation of the Smc5/6 complex in 309\u00a0 Rpa190 ubiquitination, we tested various hypomorphic Smc5/6 mutants. As shown 310\u00a0 in Figure 3B, nse5-ts3 and nse1-16, displayed reduced Rpa190 ubiquitination levels, 311\u00a0\n\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0 indicating that a fully functional Smc5/6 complex is required to sustain normal 312\u00a0 Rpa190 ubiquitination. 313\u00a0 Monoubiquitination of Pol30 depends on Rad6, while the Ubc13-Mms2 E2 enzymes 314\u00a0 stimulate its polyubiquitination. Since Pol30 ubiquitination is reduced in nse1-C274A 315\u00a0 cells, we tested if these E2s also participate in modification of Rpa190. As shown in 316\u00a0 Figure 4C, Rpa190 ubiquitination levels were lower in rad6\u2206 cells, while they were 317\u00a0 not affected by the mms2\u2206 mutation, suggesting that Rad6 promotes ubiquitination 318\u00a0 of Rpa190. 319\u00a0 Interestingly, SUMOylation of RNAP I subunits is controlled by the Nse2 subunit in 320\u00a0 the Smc5/6 complex 39. Thus, Rpa190 SUMOylation and ubiquitination might be 321\u00a0 interdependent. To analyze this possibility, we tested Rpa190 ubiquitination in 322\u00a0 nse2\u2206C mutant cells, which are severely impaired in Rpa190 SUMOylation (Figure 323\u00a0 4E). Interestingly, Rpa190 ubiquitination was diminished in nse2\u2206C mutants, relative 324\u00a0 to wild type cells (Figure 4D). This suggests that perturbing RNAP I SUMOylation 325\u00a0 might affect its subsequent ubiquitination; alternatively, the reduced Rpa190 326\u00a0 ubiquitination might derive from deficient Smc5/6 function in nse2\u2206C cells, as occurs 327\u00a0 in nse5-ts3 and nse1-16 mutants (Figure 4B). In contrast, Rpa190 SUMOylation was 328\u00a0 severely impaired in rpa190-KR cells (Figure 3E), suggesting that Rpa190 329\u00a0 ubiquitination is required for its subsequent SUMOylation (Figure 4F). Of note, 330\u00a0 despite the reduced SUMOylation of the Rpa190-KR protein, the pattern of SUMO 331\u00a0 bands was similar to that of wild type Rpa190 (Figure 4E), suggesting that SUMO 332\u00a0 may not target K408 and K410. Overall, our results indicate that Smc5/6 function is 333\u00a0 required to sustain proper Rpa190 ubiquitination levels which, in turn, promotes its 334\u00a0 subsequent modification with SUMO. 335\u00a0\n15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0 Rpa190 was detected with anti-HA antibodies; ubiquitin or SUMO-conjugated forms of Rpa190 are 347\u00a0 indicated with a vertical bar. 348\u00a0 Rpa190 ubiquitination improves rDNA segregation in smc5/6 mutants 349\u00a0 We have previously demonstrated that RNAP I function is detrimental for rDNA 350\u00a0 segregation in smc5/6 mutants 8. Therefore, it is possible that Smc5/6 might promote 351\u00a0 local clearance of stalled RNAP I complexes through ubiquitination of the Rpa190 352\u00a0 subunit, thus ensuring completion of rDNA replication and sister chromatid 353\u00a0 disjunction. To test this idea, we analysed rDNA segregation, using a battery of tet 354\u00a0 operators (tetO:487) inserted in the telomeric flank of the rDNA array 40. Cultures of 355\u00a0 smc5/6 mutants cells typically fail to segregate tetO:487 in 50% of the population 29. 356\u00a0 To inactivate Smc5/6 function, we used an auxin inducible degron allele of SMC5 357\u00a0 (smc5-aid). After synchronization of cells in G1 with alpha factor, cultures were 358\u00a0 treated with auxin to promote Smc5-aid degradation. Next, cells were released from 359\u00a0 the arrest and observed under the microscope. Cells started budding at 40 minutes, 360\u00a0 entered anaphase between 80 and 100 minutes, and most of them completed 361\u00a0 nuclear fission 140 minutes after release from G1 (Figure 5A). Cells with two divided 362\u00a0 nuclei at time points between 120 and 160 minutes were scored for segregation of 363\u00a0 tetO:487 operators (Figure 5B). As shown in Figure 5C, the rpa190-KR allele 364\u00a0 significantly aggravates the rDNA segregation defect of smc5-aid cells. In contrast, 365\u00a0 deletion of UBP10 had the opposite effect and improved rDNA segregation in smc5-366\u00a0 aid cells. Therefore, our results indicate that Rpa190 ubiquitination levels affect 367\u00a0 rDNA segregation in smc5-aid mutant cells and suggest that rDNA missegregation 368\u00a0 in smc5/6 mutant cells partly stem from insufficient Rpa190 ubiquitination. Overall, 369\u00a0 these observations suggest that Smc5/6-dependent ubiquitination of Rpa190 might 370\u00a0 be a mechanism to dislodge stalled RNAP I complexes from chromatin, thus 371\u00a0 preventing non-disjunction events in the rDNA array. 372\u00a0\n17\u00a0 \u00a0\nindicate individual measurements from 3 independent experiments; horizontal lines show medians; 386\u00a0 p=p-value, ANOVA test. 387\u00a0\n\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0 DISCUSSION 388\u00a0"

            "text": "The notion that inactivation of the RING domain in Nse1 impairs cell growth and 390\u00a0 sensitizes cells to DNA damage highlights its important functions in cell proliferation 391\u00a0 and genome integrity 17,21,22. Nse1 has ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro. This activity 392\u00a0 is enhanced by the Nse3 subunit 14. However, the only in vivo substrates identified 393\u00a0 for Nse1 are (i) the Nse4 subunit of the Smc5/6 complex in yeast 19 and (ii) Mms19, 394\u00a0 a cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) component, in humans 20. Our label-free 395\u00a0 proteomic approach has allowed us to identify a large set of Nse1-dependent 396\u00a0 ubiquitin targets, and to reveal novel and important connections of Nse1 with DNA 397\u00a0 replication and DNA damage tolerance, ribosomal biogenesis and cell metabolism. 398\u00a0 Thus, our study should constitute a valuable source of information about the 399\u00a0 ubiquitin-dependent processes and pathways affected by the RING domain in Nse1. 400\u00a0 Network analysis of Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets exposes several functional 401\u00a0 clusters (Figure 1). Interestingly, a large set of proteins, including Pol I subunits, RNA 402\u00a0 processing elements and ribosomal proteins, show deregulated ubiquitination in 403\u00a0 nse1 mutants cells, what points to ribosome biogenesis as one of the main 404\u00a0 processes controlled by Nse1. This is in accordance with the previously reported 405\u00a0 nuclear accumulation of ribosomal proteins and the ribosome biogenesis defects in 406\u00a0 smc5/6 and nse2\u2206RING mutants 41, which could result from deficient controls during 407\u00a0 ribosome biogenesis. Given the relevance of ribosome biogenesis for optimal cell 408\u00a0 growth and proliferation, it is possible that the impaired fitness of nse1 mutant cells 409\u00a0 21,22 may be partly due to defects in ribosome synthesis and altered protein 410\u00a0 translation. 411\u00a0 Another notable ubiquitin target identified in our proteomic screen is K164 in Pol30 412\u00a0 (PCNA). PCNA is known to be monoubiquitinated at K164 by Rad6-Rad18 and 413\u00a0 further polyubiquitinated with K63-linked ubiquitin chains by Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 414\u00a0 42,43. In vitro, PCNA ubiquitination is very inefficient and requires prior RFC-415\u00a0 dependent loading of PCNA onto partially heteroduplex DNA 44,45. The requirements 416\u00a0 may be even more intricate in vivo, as PCNA ubiquitination occurs in a context of 417\u00a0 damaged and partially replicated chromatin fibers. We envisage that Smc5/6-Nse1 418\u00a0\n\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0 may coordinate sister chromatid organization and PCNA modification behind forks 419\u00a0 to enable efficient bypass of DNA lesions. In accordance, the Smc5/6 complex is 420\u00a0 recruited to damaged forks, where it aids in replisome stability and fork remodeling 421\u00a0 46,47. Notably, a direct link between the Smc5/6 complex and the PCNA ubiquitination 422\u00a0 machinery has been previously reported in vertebrates: Rad18 interacts with the 423\u00a0 Nse5-Nse6 homologs to recruit the Smc5/6 complex to interstrand crosslinks, a 424\u00a0 burdensome lesion that stalls replication forks 48. However, we cannot discard the 425\u00a0 possibility that Nse1 plays an ancillary role in Pol30 ubiquitination, perhaps by 426\u00a0 reconfiguring the topology of damaged replication forks, in an unknown way, to prime 427\u00a0 full PCNA ubiquitination. 428\u00a0 Other groups of ubiquitin targets identified in our study are related to glycolytic or 429\u00a0 sterol synthesis processes that, apparently, are not directly related to Smc5/6 or 430\u00a0 Nse1 functions on chromatin. Interestingly, some mutants in the ergosterol 431\u00a0 biosynthesis are sensitive to DNA damage, suggesting that one or more metabolite/s 432\u00a0 in this pathway could play a role in DNA damage repair 49. On the other hand, it is 433\u00a0 worth noting that previous studies have also established a connection between the 434\u00a0 Smc5/6 complex, DNA damage and carbon metabolism 50. Moreover, hypomorphic 435\u00a0 NSMCE2 mutations identified in two patients have been related to a human 436\u00a0 syndrome linked to dwarfism, insulin resistance and severe metabolic abnormalities 437\u00a0 51. Based on our proteomic data, we propose that the Smc5/6-dependent regulation 438\u00a0 of metabolic processes may be channeled, at least partly, through protein 439\u00a0 ubiquitination. 440\u00a0"

            "text": "Another ubiquitin target identified in our screen is Rpa190, the large subunit of RNAP 442\u00a0 I. Based on our proteomics and pull-down experiments, we propose that 443\u00a0 ubiquitination of lysines 408 and 410 depends on Nse1. Of note, the Smc5/6 444\u00a0 complex and RNAP I show some interesting connections. First, both of them bind to 445\u00a0 the rDNA array 29,52; besides, RNAP I is SUMOylated in an Nse2-dependent manner 446\u00a0 39; in addition, inactivation of RNAP I partially relieves the rDNA missegregation 447\u00a0 phenotype of smc5/6 mutants 8. 448\u00a0\n\u00a0 20\u00a0 \u00a0 Ubiquitination levels of two Nse1-dependent ubiquitin targets identified in this study, 449\u00a0 Rpa190 and Pol30, seem to be regulated by similar players, as both depend on Rad6 450\u00a0 but also on the Ubp10 ubiquitin protease 34,53. However, the outcome of the 451\u00a0 modification might be different in each target: Rpa190 ubiquitination affects its 452\u00a0 stability, while Pol30 ubiquitination does not. Our findings also suggest that stalling 453\u00a0 of elongating RNAP I complexes by UV light damage induces Rpa190 ubiquitination. 454\u00a0 In turn, Rpa190 ubiquitination can promote its degradation by the proteasome, a 455\u00a0 situation that is normally counteracted by Ubp10. The analysis of double rpa190-KR 456\u00a0 ubp10\u2206 mutants indicates that K408 and K410 are the relevant targets for ubiquitin-457\u00a0 dependent Rpa190 degradation. We speculate that cells may ubiquitinate stalled 458\u00a0 RNAP I complexes to degrade them and prevent further interferences with other 459\u00a0 transactions at the rDNA locus. As ongoing RNAP I complexes run into DNA 460\u00a0 replication and repair processes, Nse1 dependent-ubiquitination may promote 461\u00a0 RNAP I clearance from individual rDNA repeats and allow resolution of sister rDNAs. 462\u00a0 In accordance, we have shown that preventing Rpa190 deubiquitination worsens 463\u00a0 rDNA missegregation in Smc5/6 mutant cells, while the rpa190-KR mutant improves 464\u00a0 it. Thus, Rpa190 ubiquitination facilitates disjunction of the rDNA array, helping to 465\u00a0 maintain its integrity. 466\u00a0 The localization of the ubiquitination sites in Rpa190, at the tip of the clamp domain 467\u00a0 (Figure 3A), might shed clues about the role of this modification. During initiation of 468\u00a0 transcription, the cleft aperture in RNAP I changes from an open conformation when 469\u00a0 bound to the Rrn3 transcription factor, to a fully closed configuration in the elongating 470\u00a0 complex 54,55. In addition, the Rpa49 linker crosses on top of the cleft, passes over 471\u00a0 the downstream rDNA, and binds just behind the clamp domain, acting as a safety 472\u00a0 belt and securing the rDNA inside the transcribing RNAP I complex. Ubiquitination 473\u00a0 sites in Rpa190 lay close to the path followed by the Rpa49 linker domain, whose 474\u00a0 roles seem to be the stable clamping of the rDNA during transcriptional elongation. 475\u00a0 Thus, we hypothesize that ubiquitination at the tip of the clamp might interfere with 476\u00a0 Rpa49, perhaps reducing the processivity of RNAP I in preparation for its unloading 477\u00a0 from the rDNA. Sequence and structure alignment indicates that lysine 350 in the 478\u00a0 RPA194 subunit of the human RNAP I complex occupies the same position as lysine 479\u00a0 408 in yeast (Supplementary Figure 3); moreover, quantitative diGly proteomics has 480\u00a0\n\u00a0 21\u00a0 \u00a0 shown that K350 in RPA194 is also modified in vivo 23, suggesting that this 481\u00a0 mechanism might be conserved in humans. 482\u00a0 Although UV damage-induced Rpa190 ubiquitination is not accompanied by a global 483\u00a0 reduction in Rpa190 protein levels, it is probable that Rpa190 ubiquitination occurs 484\u00a0 locally, to remodel RNAP I complexes stalled by UV damage and facilitate DNA 485\u00a0 repair, in an analogous way to RNAP II ubiquitination during transcription coupled 486\u00a0 nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) 56. In accordance, RNAP I density along rDNA 487\u00a0 units is altered after UV-light damage, most probably as a result of its dissociation 488\u00a0 from the central and 3\u2019-terminal side of the transcriptional unit 57. One intriguing 489\u00a0 aspect of our study is that rpa190-KR mutants are generally healthy and do not 490\u00a0 exhibit other phenotypes in common with Smc5/6 mutants, such as sensitivity to 491\u00a0 DNA damage, including lesions inflicted by UV light. However, while RNAP II 492\u00a0 ubiquitin mutants are not UV sensitive, they aggravate the sensitivity of TC-NER 493\u00a0 mutants 58. Thus, onsite RNAP I ubiquitination might be used as a backup resort 494\u00a0 when conventional DNA repair pathways fail. Interestingly, we have identified other 495\u00a0 ubiquitin sites in RNAP I significantly under-ubiquitinated in nse1-C274A mutant 496\u00a0 cells. For example, Rpc19, a subunit shared by RNAP I and RNAP III, showed lower 497\u00a0 ubiquitination on two different sites (with 3.5 and 2.6 fold reduction) in nse1 mutant, 498\u00a0 relative to wild type. In comparison, Rpa190 ubiquitination at both K408 and K410 499\u00a0 was reduced 2.8 fold in nse1 mutant extracts. In addition, K120 in Rpa34 and K88 500\u00a0 in Rpa43 were also less ubiquitinated in nse1 mutants. Moreover, our proteomic 501\u00a0 screen allowed us to identify five additional sites under-ubiquitinated in nse1 mutant 502\u00a0 cells (two sites in Rpa190 and one in Rpa135, Rpb5 and Rpb10), although 503\u00a0 differences were not statistically significant, relative to the wild type. Therefore, if 504\u00a0 ubiquitin redundantly targets multiple lysines in RNAP I, the modification of other 505\u00a0 sites in the complex may be masking a more severe phenotype in rpa190-506\u00a0 K408,410R cells. It will be interesting to extend RNAP I KR mutations to other Nse1-507\u00a0 dependent sites, and test how it relates to Smc5/6-dependent functions. 508\u00a0 Cancer cells frequently increase rRNA expression, thus making RNAP I as an 509\u00a0 attractive candidate for cancer treatment 59. Remarkably, rpa190-KR mutants are 510\u00a0 resistant to BMH-21, a specific transcriptional elongation inhibitor of RNAP I. The 511\u00a0 resistance of rpa190-KR cells to BMH-21 opens the question about what is the 512\u00a0\n\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0 nature of the problem generated by this inhibitor. BMH-21 is believed to bind G-C 513\u00a0 rich areas at the rDNA and to block transcriptional elongation by RNAP I 36,37. The 514\u00a0 resistance of non-ubiquitinable rpa190-KR mutants suggests that the sensitivity to 515\u00a0 BMH-21 is primarily due to Rpa190 ubiquitination, and not to the inability to proceed 516\u00a0 with transcriptional elongation. As yeast and human cells are equipped with similar 517\u00a0 tools to regulate Rpa190 ubiquitination, analysis of the physiological situations and 518\u00a0 mechanisms that promote RNAP I ubiquitination in cancer cells will be of great 519\u00a0 interest. 520\u00a0\n\u00a0 23\u00a0 \u00a0 METHODS 521\u00a0"
