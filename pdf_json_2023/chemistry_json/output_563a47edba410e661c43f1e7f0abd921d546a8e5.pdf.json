    "abstractText": "Replication protein A (RPA) is the major single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that is essential for DNA replication and processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologydirected repair pathways. Recently, small molecule inhibitors have been developed targeting the RPA70 subunit and preventing RPA interactions with ssDNA and various DNA repair proteins. The rationale of this development is the potential utility of such compounds as cancer therapeutics, owing to their ability to inhibit DNA replication that sustains tumor growth. Among these compounds, (1Z)-1-[(2-hydroxyanilino) methylidene] naphthalen-2-one (HAMNO) has been more extensively studied and its efficacy against tumor growth was shown to arise from the associated DNA replication stress. Here, we study the effects of HAMNO on cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), focusing on the effects on the DNA damage response and the processing of DSBs and explore its potential as a radiosensitizer. We show that HAMNO by itself slows down the progression of cells through the cell cycle by dramatically decreasing DNA synthesis. Notably, HAMNO also attenuates the progression of G2-phase cells into mitosis by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, HAMNO increases the fraction of chromatin-bound RPA in S-phase but not in G2-phase cells and suppresses DSB repair by homologous recombination. Despite these marked effects on the cell cycle and the DNA damage response, radiosensitization could neither be detected in exponentially growing cultures, nor in cultures enriched in G2-phase cells. Our results complement existing data on RPA inhibitors, specifically HAMNO, and suggest that their antitumor activity by replication stress induction may not extend to radiosensitization. However, it may render cells more vulnerable to other forms of DNA damaging agents through synthetically lethal interactions, which requires further investigation.",

Therefore, cancer could be effectively treated by targeting the replication stress response and specifically proteins necessary for DNA synthesis. Replication protein A (RPA) is the major\nInt. J.

Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 2 of 20\nsingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein in eukaryotic cells that is essential for DNA replication and homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) pathways such as homologous recombination (HR) and single-strand annealing (SSA) (reviewed in [2]). DNA end resection (henceforth simply resection) is a vital step of HDR pathways, particularly the HR repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), whereby a long 3\u2032-ssDNA tail is generated by removing nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end. RPA rapidly coats the ssDNA that is generated by the function of helicases during DNA replication or after resection of DSBs, as protection from nucleolytic cleavage and the unproductive folding into secondary structures [3]. Besides an increased structural stability, RPA-coated ssDNA also serves as a checkpoint signaling intermediate [4,5] and is involved in the regulation of the resection rate [6]. RPA is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of RPA70/RPA1, RPA32/RPA2, and RPA14/RPA3 subunits with molecular weights of 70 kDa, 32 kDa, and 14 kDa, respectively. RPA70 has a primary role in ssDNA binding and confers protein\u2013protein interactions. A key feature of RPA32 is its N-terminal phosphorylation motif, while RPA14 is thought to provide a structural stability to the complex (reviewed in [2]). RPA becomes phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [7\u20139] and hyperphosphorylated in response to genotoxic stress by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family members ATR, ATM, and DNA-PKcs [2,5,10\u201318]. Therefore, chromatin-bound or hyperphosphorylated RPA is commonly used as a readout of resection [19\u201327]. Considerable activity has been recently directed toward the development of drugs that inhibit the function of RPA with the rationale that they will strongly attenuate cancer cell proliferation, while exerting reduced effects on normal cells owing to their lower proliferation activity. (1Z)-1-[(2-hydroxyanilino)methylidene]naphthalen-2-one (HAMNO) [28], TDRL-505 [29], and fumaropimaric acid (NSC15520) [30,31] are well-characterized small molecule inhibitors targeting RPA70 in vitro, but their potential as cancer therapeutics requires further validation. Moreover, their effect on DNA damage response (DDR) and DSB repair in cells exposed to IR has not been analyzed. HAMNO selectively binds the N-terminal domain of the largest RPA subunit (70N) [28], potentially inhibiting critical interactions with other proteins that depend on this domain, such as p53, ATRIP, ETAA1, RAD9, MRN, BLM, PrimPol, etc. [32\u201341]. Furthermore, the interaction between 70N and phosphorylated 32N [42] is likely abrogated by HAMNO. Glanzer et al. studied the effect of HAMNO on cancer cells and found that HAMNO increased the level of replication stress as detected by elevated pan-nuclear \u03b3H2AX staining in S-phase cells. They further showed that HAMNO abrogated the auto-phosphorylation of ATR kinase as well as the phosphorylation of RPA32 at Ser33 by ATR [28]. However, whether HAMNO affects DDR and HDR repair pathways in irradiated cells remains to be investigated. Since HAMNO acts synergistically with etoposide to kill cancer cells [28], we investigate here whether HAMNO functions as a radiosensitizer owing to the anticipated suppressive effects on checkpoint activation and the function of resection-dependent pathways of DSB repair. Our findings extend previous work on the effect of HAMNO on cancer treatment and provide guidelines for the validation of other RPA inhibitors."

Cells treated with 5 \u00b5M HAMNO continued to grow actively with only a small initial delay and eventually reached similar cell numbers in the plateau phase, where cells accumulated in the G1/G0-phase with a consequent reduction in S- and G2/M-phase cells. On the other hand, cells incubated with 20 \u00b5M HAMNO showed an initial reduction in doubling time that was overcome after two days and reached markedly lower cell numbers in the plateau phase of growth. The flow cytometry histograms in Figure 1B show that HAMNO had no detectable effects on the cell cycle distribution up to 20 \u00b5M, in either phase of growth, i.e., logarithmic or plateau phase.\nInt.

Treatment with 40 \u00b5M HAMNO also caused a decrease in the mean cell diameter from ~15 \u00b5m to ~11 \u00b5m. These results imply that HAMNO can be used for long-term experiments at 5 and 20 \u00b5M, while 40 \u00b5M causes excessive apoptotic cell death that precludes a mechanistic analysis of its mode of action.\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 20\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Results\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0RPA\u00a0Inhibition\u00a0by\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0Transiently\u00a0Inhibits\u00a0Cell\u00a0Growth\u00a0and\u00a0DNA\u00a0Synthesis\u00a0\nAs\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0step\u00a0in\u00a0our\u00a0analysis,\u00a0we\u00a0measured\u00a0the\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0A549\u00a0cells\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0 of\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0(Figure\u00a01A).\u00a0Untreated\u00a0cells\u00a0grew\u00a0 logarithmically.\u00a0Cells\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0 HAMNO\u00a0 continued\u00a0 to\u00a0 grow\u00a0 actively\u00a0with\u00a0 only\u00a0 a\u00a0 small\u00a0 initial\u00a0 delay\u00a0 and\u00a0 eventually\u00a0 reached\u00a0 similar\u00a0 cell\u00a0 numbers\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 plateau\u00a0 phase,\u00a0 where\u00a0 cells\u00a0 accumulated\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 G1/G0\u2010phase\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0consequent\u00a0reduction\u00a0in\u00a0S\u2010\u00a0and\u00a0G2/M\u2010phase\u00a0cells.\u00a0On\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0hand,\u00a0 cells\u00a0incubated\u00a0with\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0showed\u00a0an\u00a0initial\u00a0reduction\u00a0in\u00a0doubling\u00a0time\u00a0that\u00a0 was\u00a0overcome\u00a0after\u00a0two\u00a0days\u00a0and\u00a0reached\u00a0markedly\u00a0 lower\u00a0cell\u00a0numbers\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0plateau\u00a0 phase\u00a0of\u00a0growth.\u00a0The\u00a0flow\u00a0cytometry\u00a0histograms\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a01B\u00a0show\u00a0that\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0had\u00a0no\u00a0 detectable\u00a0effects\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0cell\u00a0cycle\u00a0distribution\u00a0up\u00a0to\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM,\u00a0in\u00a0either\u00a0phase\u00a0of\u00a0growth,\u00a0i.e.,\u00a0 logarithmic\u00a0or\u00a0plateau\u00a0phase.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0cells\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0were\u00a0unable\u00a0to\u00a0 divide\u00a0and\u00a0began\u00a0to\u00a0show\u00a0signs\u00a0of\u00a0apoptosis\u00a0that\u00a0became\u00a0evi ent\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0sub\u2010G1\u00a0peak\u00a0after\u00a03\u00a0 days\u00a0(Figure\u00a01A,B).\u00a0Treatment\u00a0with\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0also\u00a0caused\u00a0a\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0mean\u00a0 cell\u00a0diameter\u00a0from\u00a0~15\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0to\u00a0~11\u00a0\u03bcm.\u00a0These\u00a0results\u00a0imply\u00a0that\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0 long\u2010term\u00a0experiments\u00a0at\u00a05\u00a0and\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM,\u00a0while\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0causes\u00a0excessive\u00a0apoptotic\u00a0cell\u00a0death\u00a0 that\u00a0precludes\u00a0a\u00a0mechanistic\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0its\u00a0mode\u00a0of\u00a0action.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Cell\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0A549\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0RPA\u00a0inhibitor\u00a0HAMNO.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Growth\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0\ncells\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0increasing\u00a0concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0presented\u00a0as\u00a0cell\u00a0number\u00a0per\u00a0dish\u00a0as\u00a0\na\u00a0function\u00a0of\u00a0time.\u00a0The\u00a0data\u00a0were\u00a0statistically\u00a0analyzed\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0Kruskal\u2013Wallis\u00a0one\u2010way\u00a0ANOVA\u00a0on\u00a0\nranks\u00a0and\u00a0Dunn\u2019s\u00a0post\u00a0hoc\u00a0test\u00a0within\u00a0each\u00a0time\u00a0point,\u00a0*\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.05,\u00a0ns\u00a0(not\u00a0significant).\u00a0(B)\u00a0Repre\u2010\nsentative\u00a0 cell\u00a0cycle\u00a0histograms\u00a0of\u00a0untreated\u00a0and\u00a0HAMNO\u2010treated\u00a0 cells\u00a0after\u00a0 three\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0 treat\u2010\nment.\u00a0DNA\u00a0was\u00a0stained\u00a0with\u00a0propidium\u00a0iodide\u00a0(PI).\u00a0\nSince\u00a0RPA\u00a0is\u00a0required\u00a0for\u00a0replication,\u00a0we\u00a0next\u00a0evaluated\u00a0the\u00a0effects\u00a0of\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0on\u00a0 DNA\u00a0synthesis\u00a0using\u00a0EdU\u00a0incorporation\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0endpoint\u00a0combined\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0analysis\u00a0by\u00a0 flow\u00a0cytometry.\u00a0We\u00a0added\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0EdU\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0culture\u00a0medium\u00a020\u00a0min\u00a0before\u00a0harvesting\u00a0 the\u00a0cells\u00a0 following\u00a0different\u00a0 times\u00a0of\u00a0exposure\u00a0 to\u00a0HAMNO\u00a0 (Figure\u00a02A).\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0 DNA\u00a0content\u00a0and\u00a0EdU\u00a0fluorescence\u00a0identified\u00a0cells\u00a0in\u00a0G0/G1\u2010,\u00a0S\u2010,\u00a0and\u00a0G2/M\u2010phases\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0\nSince RPA is required for replication, we next evaluated the effects of HAMNO on DNA synthesis using EdU incorporation as the endpoint combined with an analysis by flow cytometry. We added 10 \u00b5M EdU to the culture medium 20 min before harvesting the cells following different times of exposure to HAMNO (Figure 2A). An analysis of DNA content and EdU fluorescence identified cells in G0/G1-, S-, and G2/M-phases of the cell cycle and allowed the evaluation of the DNA synthesis activity (Figure 2B). While untreated cell cultures contained a fraction of nearly 40% actively replicating S-phase (EdU+) cells that remained relatively constant throughout the experiment, the addition of 5 \u00b5M HAMNO transiently decreased the number of EdU+ cells to 5\u201310% within the first 1 h, which indicated a strong inhibition of DNA synthesis, without affecting the percentage of cells in the S-phase. However, the cells quickly recovered from this replication block and resumed normal levels of DNA synthesis 4 h later (Figure 2C). Upon treatment with 20 \u00b5M HAMNO, the percentage of EdU+ cells rapidly dropped to 0% within the first 1 h of treatment and persisted for ~4 h before recovering to control values at 6 h. These data demonstrate that HAMNO causes a concentration-dependent, transient inhibition of DNA replication.\nInt. J. Mol.

We have reported that the inhibition of ATR abrogates IR-induced G2-phase checkpoint activation in cells irradiated in the G2-phase [21,22]. We therefore postulated that HAMNO acts as an ATR inhibitor and designed experiments to test this by probing effects on the G2-checkpoint. To study activation and recovery of the G2-checkpoint using an exponentially growing cell culture, specifically for cells irradiated in the G2-phase, we employed a two-parameter flow cytometry method combining DNA and H3pS10 staining to detect mitotic cells and quantitate the mitotic index (MI: fraction of cells in mitosis) [21,43\u201346]. In unirradiated and untreated cells, the MI remained constant at approximately 2.5% (Figure 3A,B (left)). The addition of 5 \u00b5M HAMNO caused a small drop of the normalized MI 2 h after treatment that indicated a small transient inhibition in the progression of G2-phase cells into mitosis\nInt. J.

of HAMNO on IR-induced G2-checkpoint activation by exposing replicate cultures to 1 Gy. The results obtained with 5 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M failed to detect any suppression of the G2-checkpoint as it would have been expected from a HAMNO-mediated inhibition of ATR. We conclude that the effects of HAMNO on cell cycle progression and checkpoint regulation derive from mechanisms that are more complex than the mere inhibition of ATR (Figure 3B (right)). Although the above experiment mainly reflects the response of G2-phase cells, contributions from other phases of the cell cycle cannot be excluded and the response of S-phase cells cannot be analyzed specifically. Therefore, in the next set of experiments, we investigated the effects of HAMNO on IR-induced cell cycle arrest and checkpoint activation in a strictly cell cycle-dependent manner taking advantage of EdU signal. To measure exclusively effects in the S- and G2-phases, EdU was added for 30 min before irradiation (4 Gy) and the fraction of EdU-negative cells (EdU\u2212) was followed as a function of time thereafter (Figure 4A).

Indeed, this experiment confirmed that HAMNO abrogated the progression of early and mid S-phase cells into the late S-phase (Figure 4B, lower panel). For a more in-depth analysis, we carried out kinetics experiments. In the absence of IR, or any other treatment, EdU\u2212 cells in the G2-phase divided and depleted the G2 compartment, which manifested as a steady decrease reaching almost zero in the fraction of EdU\u2212 G2-cells by 9 h (Figure 4C, upper left panel). The fraction of EdU\u2212 G2-cells increased again after 12 h as cells that where in the G1-phase at the start of the experiment\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 7 of 20\n(and therefore remained EdU\u2212) arrived in the G2-phase, reaching a new maximum at 15 h. This fraction decreased again when newly arrived cells from the G1-phase also started dividing. The early response of EdU\u2212 G2-phase cells remained unaffected by 20 \u00b5M HAMNO (Figure 4C, upper left panel), as also did the late response reflecting the cell cycle progression of cells originally in the G1-phase. This result suggests that when G1-phase cells face HAMNO a few hours after treatment inception, their DNA synthesis is not affected, and they reach the G2-phase with kinetics similar to untreated controls. This is perfectly in line with the transient inhibition of DNA replication shown above that indicates recovery even after treatment with a higher HAMNO concentration. When cells in this experiment were irradiated, no reduction in the EdU\u2212 G2-phase fraction was detected up to 10 h, which directly reflects the activation of the G2-checkpoint. At later times, the fraction of EdU\u2212 cells in the G2-phase increased, obviously from G1-phase cells reaching the G2-phase. HAMNO had an effect only in this late increase generating a ~5 h delay (Figure 4C, upper right panel). This is again in line with the inability of HAMNO to suppress the checkpoint, despite the anticipated inhibition of ATR. EdU+ cells in the G2-phase compartment increased as a function of time, as cells from the early and mid S-phase successfully reached the late S-phase, and this increase was delayed by HAMNO (Figure 4C, lower left panel), which is in line with the above documented inhibition of DNA synthesis that generated effects propagating to later times. Radiation exposure of these cells strongly increased the accumulation of HAMNO-untreated cells in the G2-phase as a consequence of the superimposed checkpoint activation. However, this activation remained intact after treatment with HAMNO and was only delayed similarly to the nonirradiated controls, presumably for the same reasons (Figure 4C, lower right panel). Collectively, these results suggest that HAMNO fails to modify the IR-induced G2checkpoint both in cells irradiated in the G2-phase as well as in cells irradiated in the S-phase."

            "text": "During resection, RPA-coated ssDNA stimulates the activity of ATR. It has been reported that phosphorylated RPA serves as a feedback regulator between DSB end resection and DDR where it impedes resection by inhibiting BLM helicase [6]. Since HAMNO was reported to disrupt RPA phosphorylation [28], we next investigated the effect of the HAMNO treatment on this process. We anticipated that since HAMNO leaves the function of ssDNAbinding domains of RPA70 unaffected, RPA binding to ssDNA may remain sufficiently intact to stimulate ATR activation. On the other hand, RPA unloading or exchange with other proteins such as RAD51 might be affected. To address such potential effects, we used RPA accumulation to chromatin at different times after IR as an endpoint. To discriminate between DSBs arising in the S- and G2-phases, pulse-labeling with EdU was applied 30 min before irradiation as outlined above. Figure 5A depicts the analysis of the IR-induced resection, based on an RPA70 signal analysis with a related antibody. In U2OS cells, 10 Gy of IR caused a substantial increase in chromatin-bound RPA, as compared to nonirradiated cells (Figure 5A). During the 30 min pretreatment with HAMNO, we detected an increased binding of RPA to chromatin in nonirradiated S-phase A549 cells (Figure 5B, left upper panel)\u2014probably associated with DNA synthesis inhibition (Figure 2), as reported by Glanzer et al. [28]. Moreover, these authors also showed that RPA70 binding to ssDNA was stimulated by HAMNO [28]. In A549 cells, the marked HAMNO-mediated increase in RPA signal in the S-phase (EdU+) was reduced after IR. In contrast to A549 cells, U2OS cells irradiated in the S-phase showed only a modest HAMNO-associated increase in RPA signal that was strongly enhanced after IR (Figure 5B, upper panel). Similar results were obtained with an antibody targeting the middle RPA32 subunit of the RPA complex (Figure 5C).\nInt. J. Mol.

            "heading": "2.3. HAMNO Abrogates Repair by HR in a Cell Type-Specific Manner",
            "text": "HAMNO binds and blocks the N-terminal domain of RPA70 [28] which is required for RPA protein interactions with multiple proteins involved in DDR and replication stress. During HR repair, RPA is displaced from ssDNA by RAD51 recombinase [47\u201355]. Thus, the increased accumulation of RPA on chromatin in cells irradiated in the S-phase (Figure 5B,C)\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 9 of 20\nmay be attributed to abrogated RPA interactions with multiple DDR factors. Therefore, we queried the effect of HAMNO on RAD51 foci formation in G2-phase cells using quantitative image-based cytometry (QIBC). A549 cells analyzed in the S-phase (EdU+) displayed a relatively low (~five) number of RAD51 foci in the absence of IR, which probably reflected collapsed DNA replication forks. This number remained constant during the period of observation (Figure 6A, upper left panel). Notably, after exposure to 4 Gy the number of RAD51 foci strongly increased (~20) at 3 h and subsided only slightly at 6 h. Under these conditions HAMNO reduced the number of RAD51 foci in unirradiated S-phase cells by half, and at 3 h after IR, by nearly 80% (Figure 6A, lower left panel). While HAMNO administration generated similar trends in U2OS cells, the effects failed to reach statistical significance (Figure 6B). The analysis of RAD51 responses in A549 G2-phase (EdU\u2212) cells also indicated similar trends, but there again, the effects were smaller and failed to reach statistical significance (Figure 6A, right panel). Thus, while HAMNO seems to interfere with RAD51 filament formation, the effect is cell line-specific and may derive from excess RPA binding to DNA that is specifically observed in S-phase cells [23,56]. For an alternative investigation of HAMNO\u2019s effects on HR and other DSB repair pathways, we employed GFP reporter cell lines carrying DR-GFP or SA-GFP constructs for monitoring HR and SSA events, respectively. The transient expression of I-SceI endonuclease introduces a DSB, which, when repaired by HR or SSA, creates a functional GFP gene. GFP expression is then the readout for the successful repair of these DSBs [57]. Increasing concentrations of HAMNO failed to significantly decrease HR or SSA (Figure 7A). NHEJ was suppressed by about 20% in the EJ5-GFP cell line at increasing concentrations of HAMNO, but the effect again failed to reach statistical significance. The results with the EJ2-GFP cell line, which contains a construct for analyzing alt-EJ events, were variable but showed a tantalizing increase after treatment with HAMNO (Figure 7A). They are interesting vis-\u00e0-vis the reported role of RPA in mutagenic microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) by Symington\u2019s lab [58]. Therefore, we next analyzed the contribution of alt-EJ with pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which allows the evaluation of DSB induction and repair directly from the generated physical DNA fragmentation. PFGE requires IR doses higher than 5 Gy for fragmentation to be detectable. Consequently, the involvement of HR is undetectable by PFGE since HR operates most efficiently at low DSB loads and is completely suppressed at the high IR doses PFGE requires [23,56]. The DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 was employed in these experiments to inhibit c-NHEJ and to allow alt-EJ analysis (Figure 7B). Furthermore, since alt-EJ is growth state-dependent [59,60], experiments were performed with cells either in the exponential or the plateau phase of growth. Plateau phase cells are deprived of S- and G2-phase cells, which simplifies their analysis and interpretation, as HR is inactive. In both exponentially growing and plateau phase c-NHEJ-competent cells, DSBs were efficiently rejoined in the presence of HAMNO up to 4 h after IR. In actively growing cells, DSB rejoining after treatment with NU7441 (reflecting mainly alt-EJ) also remained unaffected by HAMNO, while a small suppression that failed to reach statistical significance was observed in plateau phase cells (Figure 7B). In sum, the results obtained suggest that RPA inhibition only marginally inhibits alt-EJ or c-NHEJ; HR appears to be the main DSB repair pathway affected by RPA inhibition, though the effect remains small and is cell line- and cell cycle-dependent."

            "text": "We next examined, by employing clonogenic survival assays, whether HAMNO could radiosensitize tumor cells. When plated immediately after IR and in the presence of HAMNO, at concentrations of 0.1 \u00b5M or 0.5 \u00b5M, no radiosensitization could be observed. HAMNO at concentrations \u22651.0 \u00b5M dramatically reduced the plating efficiency of unirradiated cells. Therefore, experiments using short-term postirradiation exposure to HAMNO were carried out. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 \u00b5M HAMNO, irradiated\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 10 of 20\nand incubated for 4 or 16 h in the presence of the inhibitor. Cells were then plated for colony formation in cell growth media devoid of HAMNO. The results show that under these conditions, even treatment with 20 \u00b5M HAMNO failed to significantly radiosensitize exponentially growing A549 cells (Figure 8A). Since HAMNO exerts its effect mostly in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Figures 2 and 6), we next exposed to IR populations of cells enriched in the S-phase, which is the most radioresistant cell cycle phase [61]. The results showed that even S-phase cells, where HAMNO exerts full effects, failed to be radiosensitized (Figure 8B). We note that in some experiments we observed a slight radioresistance after exposure to HAMNO, which may reflect the effects on the ability of cells to repair potentially lethal damage after stopping DNA replication [62].

            "text": "RPA is the major eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein and its roles in several aspects of DNA metabolism are well studied. The overexpression of RPA subunits in various cancers is associated with unfavorable treatment outcome. Therefore, the development of RPA protein inhibitors has been pursued intensively and great progress has been made in the last decade (reviewed in [2]). HAMNO is one of the most studied RPA70 inhibitors owing to its promising effects on cancer treatment. Its neutral charge and hydrophobic ring structures enable it to cross the cell membrane more easily than previous RPA70 inhibitors [28]. In this report, we explored the effects of HAMNO on IR-induced DDR. At nontoxic concentrations, the ability of HAMNO to transiently inhibit DNA synthesis resulted in an altered cell cycle progression but did not affect IR-induced G2-checkpoint activation or RPA association with chromatin during the G2-phase. In some experimental settings, we even observed increased RPA binding induced by HAMNO. To our knowledge, it remains unknown whether RPA inhibitors affect RPA\u2019s dynamics on ssDNA, particularly its diffusion along ssDNA and phase separation properties [63\u201366].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 13 of 20\nIncreased RPA association with chromatin, i.e., increased resection rate, does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in Rad51 foci and is not predictive of an increased efficiency of HR. Moreover, the unchanged level of RAD51 foci formation is also not proving an intact HR pathway, especially at radiation doses higher than 4 Gy [23,56]. The increased accumulation of RPA on chromatin may reflect reduced or abolished RPA interactions with multiple DDR factors and particularly its failed replacement by RAD51. Indeed, using QIBC, we showed that in the presence of HAMNO, RAD51 foci formation was significantly reduced in A549 cells but not in U2OS cells, indicating poor RPA exchange with RAD51 and defective repair by HR in a cell line-specific manner. Experiments using GFP reporter cell lines were unable to confirm that HAMNO has a clear negative impact on the homology-directed DSB repair pathways, HR and SSA. The evidence that RPA inhibition favors alt-EJ requires further studies. Indeed, Deng et al. showed that in budding yeast, RPA prevented the annealing of microhomologies and therefore mutagenic MMEJ\u2014a form of Ku- and ligase IV-independent form of alt-EJ [58]. Nevertheless, HR and SSA are competing mechanisms, and we expected differential results when using the two corresponding reporter cell lines. It should also be noted that the events analyzed with these reporter cell lines occurred over a rather protracted period of time (up to 72 h), which compromised the study of inhibitor effects, particularly when the inhibitor exerts cytotoxicity as HAMNO does\u2014this has actually been reported and analyzed before [67]. Therefore, we employed PFGE to analyze the effects of HAMNO on alt-EJ, which allows the evaluation of DSB induction and repair based on the analysis of actual DNA fragmentation, rather than the indirect assessment of the DSB signaling response, for example by analyzing \u03b3H2AX foci formation. The results obtained, however, failed to reveal inhibitory effects either on c-NHEJ or on alt-EJ. However, we speculate that higher concentrations may generate detectable effects. Mounting evidence suggests that RPA is a critical factor in regulating resection at DSBs. RPA becomes phosphorylated by PIKK family members ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, where phosphorylation of Ser33 by ATR primes the sequential phosphorylation at other sites [2,5,10\u201318]. The Finkelstein lab reported that phosphorylated RPA suppressed DNA resection [6]. Moreover, RPA phosphorylation is altered by HAMNO; in particular, the etoposide-induced phosphorylation at Ser33 and Ser4/8 is reduced in HAMNO-treated cells [28]. All this led us to suggest that the increased RPA association with chromatin in HAMNO-treated U2OS cells upon irradiation can be attributed to increased resection, which may result in prolonged ssDNA exposure, replication fork collapse, and genomic instability. ATR has been implicated as a key regulator of cell cycle checkpoints. In addition, ATR is the primary kinase that senses replication stress [68,69]. Glanzer et al. reported defective ATR signaling in the presence of HAMNO [28], which in part is in line with our data showing inefficient HR. Based on these results, we inferred a genomic instability that should potentiate IRinduced cell death. Despite the recently reported HAMNO-induced radiosensitization of glioblastoma cancer stemlike cells [70], we did not observe any significant change in cell survival after irradiation in A549 cells. Nevertheless, we also observed that HAMNO alone impaired cell viability and colony formation as previously reported [28]. The implications of HAMNO as a radiosensitizer are likely cell line-dependent. A promising research line in this direction involves the interaction of RPA with the tumor suppressor p53. The RPA-p53 complex dissociates upon DNA damage induction and is followed by the phosphorylation of both RPA and p53 [71,72]. As p53 is frequently mutated in cancer, it may have an impact on the overall effectiveness of HAMNO as a radiosensitizer. In conclusion, the current findings extend previous work on HAMNO [28,70,73] by showing that it affects DSB signaling and repair but that these effects are relatively small and cell line- and cell cycle-dependent. Furthermore, at nontoxic concentrations, HAMNO can be used as a transient inhibitor of DNA replication in cell culture experiments. We also confirmed previously reported findings that by itself, HAMNO impaired cell viability\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14941 14 of 20\nand colony formation [28] and further showed that it did not render cells more sensitive to IR. More work will be required to assess the mechanisms by which HAMNO exerts its effects and to develop means to enhance them using agents inhibiting compensating cellular effects with potential to generate synthetic lethality."

At different times after IR, cells were fixed with 2% PFA in PBS for 15 min, washed once with PBS, and then incubated in a freshly prepared prechilled permeabilization solution (100 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 7 min at RT. Subsequently, cells were washed again with PBS and blocked in PBS containing 0.5% BSA overnight at 4 \u25e6C. Cells were then stained with primary anti-Rad51 antibody (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) or anti-RPA32 [76] for 1.5 h and with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h, both diluted in a blocking buffer. The incorporated EdU was conjugated to 6-FAM azide by \u201cclick\u201d chemistry. Subsequently, the DNA was stained by incubating cells with PBS containing 200 ng/mL 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 20 min. Finally, cells were washed with PBS and the coverslips mounted with the ProLong Gold antifade mountant (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on microscope slides. For the cell cycle-dependent analysis of repair foci formation by QIBC, samples were scanned on an AxioScan.Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) as described before [23]. The image analysis was performed using Imaris 9.5.1 software (Bitplane, Belfast, UK), and the data generated were processed by open-source Orange software v3.3 (University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia)."

            "text": "In all experiments, exponentially growing A549 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of HAMNO for 30 min and exposed to different doses of IR. Cells were then seeded for colony formation immediately after irradiation in the presence of the inhibitor. For delayed plating (DP), cells were allowed to repair DNA damage for 4 h or 16 h in the presence of HAMNO and then plated for colony formation in HAMNO-free media. Colonies were stained with 1% crystal violet dissolved in 70% ethanol and counted under a stereomicroscope. The plating efficiency (PE) of untreated cells was calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies counted to the number of cells seeded. The surviving fraction (SF) at a given dose was calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies that arise after the treatment to the number of cells seeded, normalized to the PE of unirradiated controls."

Ethidium bromide (EtBr)-stained agarose gels were scanned with a Typhoon Imager (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and the fraction of DNA released (FDR) from the plug into the lane was quantified by ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Dose\u2013response curves (FDR value versus IR dose) were used to estimate dose-equivalent (Deq) values for each FDR measured at a given time point. Repair kinetics are presented as Deq versus repair time."
