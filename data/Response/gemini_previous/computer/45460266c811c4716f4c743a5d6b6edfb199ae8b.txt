1. **Investigate the applicability of 2F-FPCA to other cryptographic algorithms:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of 2F-FPCA against the AES-128 algorithm. Future research could explore whether the method can be successfully applied to other commonly used cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, ECC, or SHA-256.


2. **Explore the use of machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of 2F-FPCA:** The paper relies on traditional statistical methods for selecting points of interest (POIs) and calculating the correlation coefficient. Future research could investigate the use of machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or reinforcement learning, to automate these processes and potentially improve the efficiency and accuracy of 2F-FPCA.


3. **Investigate the impact of different fault injection methods on the effectiveness of 2F-FPCA:** The paper utilizes voltage glitch injection as the fault injection method. Future research could explore the impact of using other fault injection methods, such as laser fault injection or electromagnetic fault injection, on the effectiveness of 2F-FPCA.


4. **Develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk of 2F-FPCA attacks:** The paper highlights the potential security risks posed by 2F-FPCA. Future research could focus on developing countermeasures to mitigate these risks, such as implementing fault detection and correction mechanisms or using more robust cryptographic algorithms that are less susceptible to side-channel attacks.


5. **Investigate the use of 2F-FPCA in combination with other side-channel analysis techniques:** The paper presents 2F-FPCA as a standalone side-channel analysis technique. Future research could explore the potential benefits of combining 2F-FPCA with other side-channel analysis techniques, such as differential power analysis (DPA) or correlation power analysis (CPA), to further enhance the effectiveness of side-channel attacks.
