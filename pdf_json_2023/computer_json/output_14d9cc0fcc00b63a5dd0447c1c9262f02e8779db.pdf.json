    "abstractText": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an emerging technology with several applications in surveillance, security, and healthcare sectors. Noninvasive HAR systems based on Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) signals can be developed leveraging the quick growth of ubiquitous Wi-Fi technologies, and the correlation between CSI dynamics and body motions. In this paper, we propose Principal Component-based Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (or PCWCNN) \u2013 a novel approach that offers robustness and efficiency for practical real-time applications. Our proposed method incorporates two efficient preprocessing algorithms \u2013 the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). We employ an adaptive activity segmentation algorithm that is accurate and computationally light. Additionally, we used the Wavelet CNN for classification, which is a deep convolutional network analogous to the well-studied ResNet and DenseNet networks. We empirically show that our proposed PCWCNN model performs very well on a real dataset, outperforming existing approaches.",

            "text": "Human activity recognition (HAR) is becoming extensively popular due to its abundant and far-reaching applications in smart homes, monitoring, and surveillance. HAR offers valuable insights into a person\u2019s physical functioning and behavior, which can be automatically monitored to provide individualized assistance. With the advancement of Wi-Fi technologies, individuals are now surrounded by devices capable of sensing and communication, which makes activity identification significantly efficient than image/video-based and wearable sensors-based approaches. More specifically, there are several techniques to recognize human activities: one strategy employs camera-based techniques, which have the drawbacks of requiring line of sight and suitable lighting conditions. Another strategy is using wearable sensors, which are more accurate and straightforward, but inconvenient and costly Wang et al. [2015]. Both of these approaches have the issue of potentially breaching personal privacy.\nThe use of Channel State Information (CSI) from Wi-Fi signals to detect human activity has developed rapidly in recent years. CSI measurement is a fine-grained metric that captures a Wi-Fi channel\u2019s amplitude and phase variations at distinct subcarrier levels. CSI is more stable than Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); therefore, it is often the preferable option for implementing HAR systems T. F. Sanam and H. Godrich [2020]. CSI signals allow us to observe activity across walls and behind closed doors and detect basic motions or a sequence of gestures based on the properties of signal penetration Adib and Katabi [2013]. Due to the unique capacity to decrease multipath effects, CSI signals carry useful information for activity recognition. As such, modern Wi-Fi-based device-free HAR systems exploit correlations between CSI signal changes and body motions Wang et al. [2018a]. However, only a limited number of Wi-Fi receiving devices, such as Wi-Fi 5300 NICs, offer access to the CSI data Gu et al. [2015]. CSI tools Halperin et al. [2011] have made it feasible to capture CSI data and explore the association between signals and human activities.\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n13 16\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n6 D\nec 2"

            "text": "In recent years, researchers have developed several methods for CSI-based activity recognition. Yang et al. proposed a CSI signal enhancement method and antenna selection-based framework for human activity identification Yang et al. [2021]. Wang et al. proposed a channel selective activity recognition system (CSAR), where they showed how the channel selection and the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) can work together for HAR Wang et al. [2018b]. Gao et al. used a deep neural network to learn optimized deep features from radio images Gao et al. [2017]. Hsieh et al. proposed a simple deep neural network for HAR Hsieh et al. [2021], that incorporates the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN). Dayal et al. proposed a method with upgraded PCA technique and a deep neural network Dayal et al. [2015]. Yang et al. designed an occupancy detection system based on the CSI to demonstrate its effectiveness on the Internet of Things (IoT) platform Yang et al. [2018]. Another method that utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for activity recognition was proposed by Ding and Wang Ding and Wang [2019]. Modern generative adversarial networks (GAN) are also being used for HAR, see the work of Wang et al. Wang et al.

Additionally, CSI-based methods have their own set of difficulties and limitations. In this paper, we propose a unique approach to integrate PCA-based dimensionality reduction, DWT-based feature extraction and a CNN-based multi-class classification scheme that is capable of identifying activities regardless of the physiological and behavioral aspects of the individual and environmental elements, and is suitable for real-time applications."

            "text": "A radio signal transmitted from a stationary source will encounter random objects in an indoor environment, producing replicas of the transmitted signal. When a single pulse is transmitted over a multipath channel, the received signal appears as a pulse train, with each pulse corresponding to a line-of-sight component or a different multipath component associated with different scatterers Goldsmith [2005]. Because of the surroundings, there is one primary path (Line-OfSight, LOS) and multiple reflected paths (Non-Line-Of-Sight, NLOS). These NLOS components are duplicates of the transmitted signal that have been reflected, diffracted, or scattered and can be reduced in power, delayed in time, and phase and frequency displaced from the LOS signal path.\nThe Friis free space propagation model Wang et al. [2016] is used to model the path loss of line-of-sight (LOS) path in a free space environment, applicable in the transmitting antenna\u2019s far-field region, and is based on the inverse square law of distance. The model expresses the received power Pr(d) of a receiver antenna in terms of the distance d from a radiating transmitter antenna in the free space:\nPr(d) = PtGtGr\u03bb\n2\n(4\u03c0)2d2 , (1)\nwhere Pt is the transmitted power, Gr denotes the receiving antenna gain, Gt denotes the transmitter antenna gain, \u03bb denotes the wavelength in meters and d denotes the distance from the transmitter to a receiver in meters Wang et al. [2016].\nLet, s(t) denote the transmitted signal as: s(t) = < { a(t)ej(2\u03c0fct+\u03c60) } , (2)\nwhere a(t) is the time-varying complex-valued amplitude, fc is the carrier frequency. Then the total received signal is calculated as the sum of the LOS path and all the multipath components, and can be shown as:\nr(t) = <  N(t)\u2211 n=0 \u03b1n(t)e \u2212j\u03c6n(t)a (t\u2212 \u03c4n(t))  ej2\u03c0fct  , (3)\nwhere n = 0 represents the LOS path. The number of resolvable multipath components, the multipath delay, the amplitude, and the phase shift due to the nth multipath are denoted by N(t), \u03c4n(t), \u03b1n(t), and \u03c6n(t), respectively. Let\u2019s consider an indoor stationary environment where the objects are fixed. The expected values of the variables in the equation (3) will be time-invariant, assuming a(t) is also time-invariant, as:\nA(t) = N(t)\u2211 n=0 \u03b1n(t)e \u2212j\u03c6n(t)a (t\u2212 \u03c4n(t)) . (4)\nIf an object is in motion in the environment, the multipath reflected or scattered from that object will have time-varying amplitudes. Let the multipath components corresponding to n \u2208 S have time-varying amplitudes. It can be shown that A(t) = AS +AD(t), the received signal amplitude will be the sum of two components: the time-invariant static component, AS , and the time-varying dynamic component AD. The dynamic component will capture any motion occurring in the indoor environment. Therefore, the received CSI data will have both a static and a dynamic component. By focusing on the dynamic components at various subcarrier or frequency levels, it is possible to determine the association between the variation in human activity speed and the CSI dynamics."

            "text": "Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Channel State Information (CSI) are the two components of Wi-Fi signals. RSSI is the total energy of all signal channels combined, whereas CSI characterizes the properties of the wireless propagation channel between the transmitter and the receiver. Because of multipath fading and background noise, RSSI measurements change over time and are therefore somewhat unreliable. On the other hand, CSI amplitude values exhibit significant consistency over time at a given point T. F. Sanam and H. Godrich [2020], Sanam and Godrich [2018]. As mentioned before, the multipath propagation causes a delay spread in the time domain and selective fading in the frequency domain. These effects are incorporated in CSI, exhibiting channel selective fading on several subcarrier levels. The frequency response of the channel corresponding to each subcarrier can be expressed as:\nH(k) = |H(k)|ej\u2220H(k), (6)\nwhere H(k) denotes the CSI of kth subcarrier, |H(k)| denotes the amplitude of the kth subcarrier, and \u2220H(k) denotes the phase.\nCSI data can be extracted at the receiver as a NT \u00d7NR\u00d7NS matrix, where NT is the number of transmitting antennae, NR is the number of receiving antennae, and NS is the number of OFDM subcarriers. More specifically, CSI data can be expressed as:\nCSI1 = [CSI1,1, CSI1,2, . . . , CSI1,NS ]\nCSI2 = [CSI2,1, CSI2,2, . . . , CSI2,NS ]\n...\nCSIK = [CSIK,1, CSIK,2, . . . , CSIK,NS ],\nwhere K = NRNT is the number of streams present for each transmitter-receiver pair. Each pair contains a NS number of subcarriers, so the total number of CSI streams is NTNRNS . Fig. 2 shows the raw CSI data for a particular activity \u2013\nbending. The activity data consist of three-receiver antenna data, each of which further consists of 30 subcarrier data (20 subcarrier data has been plotted for simplicity). We observed that some antennas are more insensitive to some activity and as such, the CSI response of an insensitive antenna is not quite useful for activity recognition. Since the wireless channel is a frequency selective fading channel, different frequencies show different responses to the same activity. Therefore, CSI for each subcarrier is different. In general, subcarriers of low frequencies are less responsive to the activity, whereas subcarriers of high frequencies are more responsive T. F. Sanam and H. Godrich [2018]. Moreover, lowfrequency subcarriers are more prone to noise compared to high-frequency ones. If we arbitrarily choose a subcarrier for the purpose of HAR, the recognition performance may not be good. Therefore, further analysis is necessary for merging these subcarriers to remove redundancy, reduce noise and preserve maximum activity information.\nIn an ideal situation, if a particular activity is considered for the same antenna and subcarrier, Wi-Fi CSI data should not differ much for different volunteers. But in practice, CSI data depends on many factors relating to the subject, namely the body shape, height, duration of activity performed, etc. Also, each individual\u2019s time to complete a particular activity is different.\nThe objective of human activity recognition system modeling is to generate a robust system resilient to changes to the system, i.e., environmental changes, different subjects, etc. In an indoor environment, the Channel Frequency Response (CFR) is a linear combination of multipath components reflected off objects in the environment, including the subject\u2019s body Wang et al. [2015]. Thus, CSI data amplitude variation and phase change significantly depend on the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish the change in speed of the multipath components of each activity irrespective of the background and subject. Environmental changes significantly dominate statistical features. Time-Frequency analysis tools, such as Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), relate to the speed of the multipath changes Wang et al. [2015]. Fig. 3 shows Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) scalogram for three activities. CWT has been chosen since it provides high-resolution analysis capability. These CWT scalograms can be considered a fingerprint of the activity being performed. In the scalogram of horizontal arm wave, there are high-frequency components of around 8 Hz and 12 Hz in 4-8 s time slot. For bend activity, significant low-frequency components in 2-5 s indicate the slow torso movement. Since upper body movement is also present, there are few high-frequency components. On the other hand, for the last activity, squat, there are only low-frequency components in 2-5 s, indicating slow lower body movement. The sampling rate of WiAR CSI data was 30 Hz. So the highest frequency to show on the scalogram is Nyquist frequency 15 Hz.\nThe primary challenge with CSI-based activity recognition is that CSI data contains noise, making it difficult to use any detection system directly on the raw data. To eliminate these artifacts, several pre-processing strategies are required. The second challenge is choosing a proper feature extraction approach. For the same activity, different individuals need varying times- pans. The duration of an activity might change over time, even for the same individual. Moreover, a segmentation task is required to identify the activity part; however, inaccurate segmentation may lead to low accuracy. This study proposes a technique that addresses these issues and yields acceptable outcomes."

We can arrange all the CSI streams column-wise to form the matrix as X = [X1,X2,X3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,XN]. We can find the correlation estimate from the auto-correlation matrix R = XTX \u2208 RN\u00d7N . As the Eigenvectors of an auto-correlation matrix are orthogonal to each other, it is possible to project the data on the eigenvectors to find the components in their signal subspace. The kth principal component can be constructed as hk = Rvk. If we arrange the eigenvectors according to the decreasing order of their corresponding eigenvalues, then the smallest few eigenvalues will be associated with the noise and the principal components corresponding to these eigenvalues can be ignored. This will effectively filter out a portion of the noise. Discarding these principal components will also result in dimensionality reduction. Additionally, the first principal component has the largest possible variance. Although the first principal component captures most of the data variability, it simultaneously captures the burst noise in all the CSI streams. As discussed in Wang et al. [2015], noises caused by internal state changes are most prominently present in the first principal component. Therefore, we discard the first principal component and utilize the second and third principal components in our method.

Activity segmentation is necessary to distinguish the dynamic activity segment from the static non-activity section. Non-activity data is excluded from the recognition process for improved efficiency since it contains no information about the activity. To that end, a sliding window-based segmentation algorithm is proposed in Yang et al. [2021]. It finds an array of the mean-variance of raw CSI data and filters out the part lower than a threshold corresponding to the third quartile of the sorted variance values. There are certain limitations to such an approach. Some activities may be erroneously segmented with a non-adaptive window since they are performed for a different duration. Some activities may last longer than the segmented window, whereas others may be of less duration. As a result, an adaptive algorithm is required to modify the threshold value according to the nature of the signal. A modified sliding window-based segmentation process has been used to solve this issue. After the sliding window is applied to the denoised principal components, the variance in that window is computed and saved in V. Then, the sliding window is shifted across V, and the mean in that window is calculated and stored in M. The values of M are sorted and the maximum value is obtained. A threshold value T = p\u00d7max (M) is computed where 0 < p < 1, and the values in M less than T are discarded. Value of p is set such that the segmentation length t, normalized to the length of the CSI data sequence is greater than some prefixed value t1 and less than t2, and 0 < t1 < t < t2 < 1. In this work, the value of the parameters t1 and t2 were selected to be 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. The value of normalized segment length t is minimized in an iterative manner. The start time and end time of the activity segment are obtained from the filtered M. Once the segmented activity parts of PC2 and PC3 have been obtained, activity recognition followed by feature extraction is performed."

In contrast to the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), which provides uniform time resolution across all frequencies, DWT offers high time resolution and low-frequency resolution for high frequencies and high-frequency resolution and low time resolution for low frequencies Tzanetakis et al.

One activity sample from the dataset used in this study yielded a CSI with 90 subcarriers, of which only two principal components remained following subcarrier fusion.\nIn this work, we propose a modified WCNN network, namely the Principal Component-based Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (PCWCNN). This model takes the second and third principal components from the SF module and feeds them into the WCNN, and a three-level multi-resolution decomposition of both principal components is performed. The lower resolution counterpart of the DWT output captures the bulk of the original signal since the information in the fine-grained signal is typically sparse. As a result, the low-frequency version or approximation coefficients of the DWT output are used throughout this network.\nThe original principal components are concatenated and fed as input into a deep CNN network. The approximation coefficients from one step of the wavelet transformation are iteratively passed through multiple identical transformations to yield various frequency renditions of the original principal components. Using the feature concatenation method, the approximation coefficients of these stages are combined with the feature maps of the convolutional layers across the CNN. The CNN consists of convolution layers with 3 \u00d7 1 kernels. To minimize feature map dimensions, 3 \u00d7 1 convolutional kernels, a stride of 2 and 1\u00d71 padding are employed. Incorporating the ResNet and Densenet architectures, along with wavelet decomposition, may significantly improve the recognition accuracy of a deep CNN Fujieda et al. [2018]. Because DWT inherently comprises a decimation of the input signal, the approximation coefficient size must be\nanalogous to that of the feature maps of the convolutional layers across the CNN to employ the feature concatenation approach. A method can be used that employs 1\u00d7 1 padding with a stride of 2 to halve the output to the size of the input layer Fujieda et al. [2018].

WiAR gathers Wi-Fi CSI data from three locations. The performance of the recognition method is influenced by the environment in which it is implemented. The WiAR dataset comprises sixteen activities that may be grouped into three major categories based on the body parts associated: upper body, lower body, and entire body activities. Upper body activities are those in which volunteers do the task primarily with their upper skeleton joints. Lower-body movements only move the lower skeleton joints, entire body activities combine upper and lower body activities. The data set is more diverse when there are multiple forms of categorization. WiAR dataset acquired more than 7s of data for each activity sample, which includes 2-3s of activity data and 4-6s of no-activity data (static component from the environment). In general, it takes a volunteer about 2-3 seconds to complete an activity at a moderate pace.\n4.1 Data Acquisition\nWiAR collected activity data on two T400 laptops using the Intel 5300 NIC. The CSI tool that was developed Halperin et al. [2011] was employed. One T400 laptop with one antenna transmits outbound signal data, while another with three\nantennas receives signal data from multiple paths upon reflection. The volunteers were placed in between these two computers to do their activities. The 802.11n NIC cards monitor the channel integrity for each packet that it receives. The CSI is then transmitted to a user-space program for processing by the driver. The Intel 5300 NIC delivers CSI for 30 bands of subcarriers, which are evenly divided across the 56 subcarriers of a 20 MHz channel or the 114 carriers of a 40 MHz channel Halperin et al. [2011]."

SVM and RF perform similarly in both cases, however KNN performance degrades when using the subcarrier fusion method.\nThe performance comparison of several principal component groupings is demonstrated in Fig. 7. We applied a 1D-CNN network together with DWT-based feature extraction to illustrate this comparison. The effect of combining\nthe first principal component (PC1) with other components is depicted in Fig. 7a. It is obvious that the first principal component is insufficient. The accuracy improves from 88% to 92% when PC2 or PC3 are integrated with PC1. However, PC2 and PC3 pair performs significantly better than any other combination that includes PC1. Comparisons between several PC pairings are shown in Fig. 7b. Evidently, PC-2,3 pair outperforms others. PC-4,5 pair performs much worse (75%), which points to noise in the later-end PCs. Fig. 7c compares the performance of combining various PCs with PC-2,3. Performance always degrades regardless of which PC is added to the pair PC-2,3. The rationale for using the PC-2,3 combination in our proposed PCWCNN model is demonstrated by this comparison study.\nThe accuracy, recall, and F1-score of all the volunteers using the proposed PCWCNN technique are shown in Table 2. The results show the superiority of this method over previous reference models. Fig. 8 depicts the approach\u2019s confusion matrix. Whereas the majority of activities were competently recognized, the detection accuracy of some of them was low (89%), which might be attributed to similarities between them or related activities. High arm waves, high throw, phone call, and drink water are all upper body activities. Although these activities can be identified visually, using CSI alone would make it substantially more challenging. Additionally, the activity patterns of these activities are very dependent on the specific individual. Therefore, in comparison, the detection accuracy of these activities is somewhat lower. Moreover, compared to the results obtained for one volunteer, the overall performance findings demonstrate a considerable performance decline. The reasoning can be deduced due to some individuals\u2019 poor quality data and the system becoming more complex due to the inclusion of more volunteers.\nTable 3 compares the accuracy of the methodologies described in previous literature, as well as a synopsis of the dataset that was used. In terms of accuracy, the PCWCNN method yields promising results, with accuracy surpassing 95%. Because additional classes of activities complicate the problem, the best analogy is the LCED technique, which has a 95% overall accuracy."

            "text": "The performance of the proposed PCWCNN technique for various distance and height data is shown in Fig. 9. The distance factor data is collected for three distances: 1 m, 3 m, and 6 m. The results outperform reference models considerably. Performance for 6m data is the best for distance factor data. But Wi-Fi signals have a transmission range of fewer than 15 meters and a detecting range of fewer than 5 meters Guo et al. [2021]. Therefore the results obtained are contradictory to the general idea.\nSince different height data correlates to various body sections, the WiAR dataset provides various height data. The lower body corresponds to 60 cm in height. The whole body corresponds to 90 cm. Upper-body activities correlate to a height of 120 cm. Regarding height factor data, the highest performance comes from 90 cm data, which can be linked to the fact that at this height, all activities relating to all heights are given equal attention."

            "text": "In this paper, we proposed a novel human activity recognition method that is accurate and robust for real-time applications. We achieved this by employing an adaptive activity segmentation algorithm, PCA- and DWT-based preprocessing and CNN-based classification. We performed extensive experimentation on a real dataset, and empirically compared the performance of our method against several recent approaches. We demonstrated that our method comfortably outperforms the existing ones. An interesting future work could be enhancing the resilience of our\nproposed method against environmental changes. Another direction could be incorporating formal privacy guarantees in our method, as CSI data correlated with human movement is potentially privacy-sensitive."
