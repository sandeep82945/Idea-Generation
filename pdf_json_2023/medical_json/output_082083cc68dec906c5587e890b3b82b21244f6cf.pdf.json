    "abstractText": "Psoriasis is a skin disease with occasional involvement of non-cutaneous territories. Beyond the usual, cardiovascular events are more frequent in these patients and correlate only partially with disease activity, suggesting the presence of other unknown factors. We selected ten psoriatic patients without treatment in the last year and matched them for age and gender with eleven healthy subjects. Ficoll-extracted mononuclear cells were analyzed with flow cytometry for monocyte surface phenotype markers, intracellular NF\u03baB/inflammasome-dependent interleukins, and chemotaxis receptor CXCR3. Using ELISA, patient serum was evaluated for ADAMTS7 and CXCL10. Inflammatory M1 monocytes showed higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in psoriatic patients. M2 monocytes also showed higher levels of intracellular inflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, IL-6 values were higher compared to other monocytes and IL-1\u03b2. The mTORC activation markers ADAMTS7 and S6Rp were higher in psoriatic patients than in healthy controls. In psoriatic patients, serum levels of ADAMTS7 were elevated, and M2 monocytes showed a distinct inflammatory response with higher relative levels of NF\u03baB-dependent IL-6 and less activity of the CXCR3\u2013CXCL10 chemotactic pathway. These data suggest pathways with potential markers for prediction and early detection of cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.",

            "text": "Psoriasis is a systemic disease with occasional comorbidities involving joints, enthesis, eyes, and gastrointestinal territories. Nonetheless, cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of death in these patients [1]. The severity of the disease has been considered as a predictor of extra-cutaneous involvement; however, particularly in accelerated atheromatosis and cardiovascular risk, increased frequency of Framingham traditional cardiovascular risk factors and higher clinical inflammation measured as Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) are not able to accurately predict major cardiovascular events (MACE) in psoriatic patients [2]. Multiple attempts to better predict cardiovascular risk in these patients have been proposed [3]. Other factors are being studied to narrow the gap between predicted and actual incidence of cardiovascular events [4]. In psoriasis pathophysiology, Th1 and Th17 pathway activation could be associated with accelerated atheromatosis by multiple mechanisms [5]; moreover, which modules are involved in specific aspects of vessel wall changes have yet to be fully elucidated [5]. The\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 116. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13010116 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nmammalian adaptation complex (mTORC) also has an important role in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerosis process. mTORC inhibition is a therapeutic tool after angioplasty [6]. Moreover, mTORC interacts with inflammatory and matrix-changing proteins such as the transcription factor NF\u03baB [7], and Disintegrin, and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs 7 (ADAMTS7) [8]. The ADAMTS family member, ADAMTSL5, has already been associated with psoriasis and its musculoskeletal manifestations, showing an association between psoriatic arthritis and ADAMTSL5 antibodies. Since ADAMTS7 has been described as an emerging factor in an accelerated atheromatous, measuring its levels in psoriatic patients is of great interest [9]. On the other hand, activation of the mTORC1 pathway, which targets the phosphorylation of multiple proteins, plays a critical part in monocyte/macrophage inflammatory phenotyping [10]. These cells actively participate in the atheromatous plaque formation and expansion [11]. ADAMTS7 is secreted by macrophages and monocytes and interacts with extracellular matrix proteins, changing blood vessel wall structure and creating conditions for unstable atheromatous plaques [12]. How mTORC activation and ADAMTS7 levels behave in psoriatic patients has, to date, not been published."

            "text": "After gathering psoriasis-related clinical features, cardiovascular risk factor was assessed. No significant differences in age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors were found (Table 1). First, an immunophenotype analysis was designed for peripheral monocytes using the previously described M1\u2013M2 classification. CD14, CD163, CCR2, and HLA-DR markers allowed us to define M1 monocytes (CD14+HLADR+CCR2+) and M2 monocytes (CD14+CD163+CCR2-) (Supplementary Figure S1A). In these subsets and in the total CD14+ monocytes, we subsequently performed a cytokine characterization by measuring inflammasome-derived intracellular IL-1\u03b2, NF-kB-dependent intracellular inflammatory IL-6, and the chemotaxis axis by measuring surface CXCR3 receptor and serum CXCL10 chemokine. IL-1\u03b2+ and IL-6+ cells among CD14+ monocytes were three times higher in psoriatic patients than in the control group (Figure 2.5A). M1, but not M2, the frequency was higher in the psoriatic group (Figure 2.5B), and only M1 showed an elevated fluorescence for IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 2.5C) and IL-6 (Figure 2.5D). Chemokine CXCR3 was elevated in psoriasis both in M1 and M2, with values six times higher in the first (Figure 2.5E). Further analysis showed that the difference between the IL-6 MFI ratio in M2/total CD14+ monocytes in psoriatic versus controls was higher than IL-1\u03b2 in M2/total CD14+ monocytes, indicating that IL-6, despite being an inflammatory cytokine, does not behave in the same manner as IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 2.5F). ADAMTS7 levels were analyzed in both groups; psoriatic patients had higher serum levels, which have not been previously reported (Figure 2.5G). To better understand this unusual behavior of IL-6 in psoriasis, we performed a dimensional reduction using a flow-cytometry approach with tSNE and found that the two subpopulations of monocytes were perfectly differentiated, and its cytokine signature confirmed steady IL-6 values in the M2 subset from psoriatic patients (Supplementary Figure S1B). We further confirmed this observation by mathematical dimensional reduction of our variables using Principal Component Analysis. IL-6 MFI in M2 monocytes showed an orthogonal vectorial direction for both groups of patients in the PC1\u2013PC2 biplot (Supplementary Figure S1C). Additional correlation analysis showed that only M2 monocytes correlate with ADAMTS7 serum levels (Figure 2A,B) and IL-6 (Figure 2C,D), but there is no correlation with IL-1\u03b2 MFI levels in psoriasis (Figure 2E). Inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL10 correlate with M1 monocytes but not M2 monocytes (results not shown). At this point, IL-6 cytokine in M2 monocytes appears to correlate better with cardiovascular risk marker ADAMTS7. Since mTORC is a key participant in atheromatosis by modulating cell differentiation and phenotyping, we analyzed its activity via phosphorylation of S6R protein, a target of mTORC 1-protein synthesis pathways. S6Rp levels were higher in psoriatic patients, particularly M2 monocytes (Figure 2F). Following this, knowing that IL-6 is an NF\u03baB-dependent cytokine associated with ADAMTS7 production, we assessed this association and found a positive correlation in psoriasis (Figure 2G,H). Finally, we could not find a correlation between clinical psoriasis features and molecular variables, indicating that clinical evaluation does not fully assess some of the underlying inflammatory processes (Supplementary Figure S2A\u2013J).\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 116 6 of 8\nMetabolites\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 8\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nlevels\u00a0were\u00a0higher\u00a0in\u00a0psoriatic\u00a0patients,\u00a0particularly\u00a0M2\u00a0monocytes\u00a0(Figure\u00a02F).\u00a0Following\u00a0 this,\u00a0knowing\u00a0 that\u00a0 IL\u20106\u00a0 is\u00a0an\u00a0NF\u03baB\u2010dependent\u00a0cytokine\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0ADAMTS7\u00a0pro\u2010 duction,\u00a0we\u00a0assessed\u00a0this\u00a0association\u00a0and\u00a0found\u00a0a\u00a0positive\u00a0correlation\u00a0in\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0(Figure\u00a0 2G,H).\u00a0Finally,\u00a0we\u00a0could\u00a0not\u00a0find\u00a0a\u00a0correlation\u00a0between\u00a0clinical\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0features\u00a0and\u00a0mo\u2010 lecular\u00a0variables,\u00a0 indicating\u00a0that\u00a0clinical\u00a0evaluation\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0fully\u00a0assess\u00a0some\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0un\u2010 derlying\u00a0inflammatory\u00a0processes\u00a0(Supplementary\u00a0Figure\u00a0S2A\u2013J).\u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0Correlation\u00a0of\u00a0serum\u00a0ADAMTS7,\u00a0IL\u201018,\u00a0and\u00a0CXCL10\u00a0levels\u00a0with\u00a0inflammatory\u00a0cytokines,\u00a0\nmTOR,\u00a0 and\u00a0 monocyte\u00a0 phenotype\u00a0 in\u00a0 psoriatic\u00a0 patients.\u00a0 (A,B)\u00a0 Correlation\u00a0 between\u00a0 serum\u00a0"

            "text": "Here, we presented an exploratory study in a non-treated setting of severe psoriatic patients where unknown immunological factors potentially related to cardiovascular risk could be overexpressed. Considering this, three essential elements in atherosclerotic plaque development were first assessed: macrophage recruitment and their inflammatory and phagocytic differentiation, activation of adaptive pathways such as mTORC that help with myofibroblast trans-differentiation, and the hemodynamic and endothelial changes associated with the inflammatory process itself. We analyzed the first two elements, looking for aspects in a monocyte phenotype that would suggest specific recruitment to the plaque and then activation of the mTORC pathway. This pathway was activated in the psoriatic group even when CVD and obesity were similar between groups, suggesting an inflammatory\u2013immune-mediated activation. We demonstrated the presence of M2 monocytes with a different pattern of inflammatory activation than M1 monocytes and less activity of the CXCL10-CXCR3 chemotaxis pathway. Chemotaxis pathways have recently been described as an alternative way to diminish the trafficking of inflammatory cells to ingrowing plaques [13]. This reinforces the idea of better understanding the movement of these cells between different compartments as an important aspect of accelerated atheromatosis. Besides higher mTORC1 activation, our monocytes exhibited another interesting feature: the dissociation of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in M2 monocytes; IL-6 remains at elevated basal values in psoriatic patients and is mathematically demonstrated to behave differently from other cytokines in M2 monocytes (Supplementary Figure S1). Given that IL-6 depends on the activation of NF\u03baB and not an inflammasome such as IL-1\u03b2, the idea of an NF\u03baB-dependent activation of adaptation pathways such as mTORC or ADAMTS7 overproduction could be proposed. In previous studies, IL-6 induces endothelial dysfunction upregulating adhesion molecules in vitro [14]. On the other hand, in line with our findings, mTOR modulation drives inflammatory changes in endothelial cells [15]. Despite this, it is an exploratory study with a limited number of patients and without specific pathway analysis in other research models, so a causal relationship cannot be established."

Despite this, the monocyte\u2019s phenotype showed complex behavior with different features between each subset. Non-inflammatory cells showed distinct interleukin marks, which can influence their participation in atheromatosis. Further studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to clarify whether ADAMTS7, NF\u03baB-dependent interleukins, M2 monocyte phenotype, or mTORC activity could be added as early markers of cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo13010116/s1, Figure S1: Surface, intracellular, and serum variables analysis performing dimensional reduction using t-SNE and Principal Component Analysis; Figure S2: Correlation analysis between clinical features, intracellular cytokine levels, serum ADAMTS7, and monocyte phenotype.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: C.K., L.H., K.L. and R.C.; Data Curation: L.H., C.K.; Formal Analysis: L.H., C.K. and K.L.; Funding Acquisition: L.H. and C.K.; Investigation: C.K., L.H., K.L., R.C. and C.P.; Resources: L.H., C.K. and K.L.; Supervision: L.H. and C.K.; Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation: L.H., C.K. and K.L.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing: L.H., C.K. and R.C.
