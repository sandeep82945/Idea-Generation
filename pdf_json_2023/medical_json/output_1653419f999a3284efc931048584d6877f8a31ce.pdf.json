    "abstractText": "The research community is actively exploring ways to create cost-efficient and highperforming electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this investigation, an innovative technique was employed to produce heteroatom-doped carbon containing NiCo oxides, i.e., HC/NiCo oxide@800, in the form of a three-dimensional hierarchical flower. This method involved the reduction of a bimetallic (Ni, Co) metal\u2013organic framework, followed by carefully controlled oxidative calcination. The resulting porous flower-like structure possess numerous advantages, such as expansive specific surface areas, excellent conductivity, and multiple electrocatalytic active sites for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Moreover, the presence of oxygen vacancies within HC/NiCo oxide@800 significantly enhances the conductivity of the NiCo substance, thus expediting the kinetics of both the processes. These benefits work together synergistically to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of HC/NiCo oxide@800. Empirical findings reveal that HC/NiCo oxide@800 electrocatalysts demonstrate exceptional catalytic activity, minimal overpotential, and remarkable stability when deployed for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline environments. This investigation introduces a fresh avenue for creating porous composite electrocatalysts by transforming metal\u2013organic frameworks with controllable structures. This approach holds promise for advancing electrochemical energy conversion devices by facilitating the development of efficient and customizable electrocatalytic materials.",

            "text": "A sustainable way to produce hydrogen is water electrolysis. Until now, only 4% of H2 has been produced through water splitting [1\u20133]. The overall electrochemical water splitting includes hydrogen evolution at the cathode and oxygen evolution at the anode, which is represented in the following equations [1\u20136]:\nIn acidic solution At cathode : 2H+ + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2 (1)\nAt anode : H2O\u2192 2H+ + 1 2 O2 (2)\nOverall reaction : H2O\u2192 H2 + 1 2 O2 (3)\nIn neutral and alkaline solution\nAt cathode : 2H2O + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2 + 2OH\u2212 (4)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15173588 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 2 of 16\nAt anode : 2OH\u2212 \u2192 H2O + 1 2 O2 + 2e\u2212 (5)\nOverall reaction : H2O\u2192 H2 + 1 2 O2 (6)\nThe kinetics of the overall reaction depend on an oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as OER is a kinetically sluggish process [4\u20138]. Therefore, an efficient electrocatalyst to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER and thus reduce the activation energy barrier of both the OER and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) is required. In this regard, commercial electrocatalysts based on noble metal (Pt) and metal oxides (RuO2/IrO2) are available, in terms of which Pt is effective regarding HER and RuO2/IrO2 is effective regarding OER [8\u201311]. But due to their high cost and low availability, their large-scale production is hindered. Therefore, there is an urge to synthesize non-precious electrocatalysts. With innumerable research works, it was found that non-noble metals, such as transition metal alloys, oxides, hydroxides, (oxy) hydroxides, carbides, phosphides, and chalcogenides were found to perform as effective electrocatalysts regarding HER and OER, and moreover, these materials are cheap and are abundantly available [12\u201318]. Among the above mentioned materials, transition metal oxides, in particular, bimetal oxides (where \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 represent transition metals) are preferred due to their variable valence state, tunable morphology, and enhanced redox stability. The bimetal oxide formed from Ni and Co was found to be efficient regarding HER and OER performances due to their synergistic effect produced by multiple valence states and their resistance regarding alkaline electrolyte [19\u201323]. Metal oxides along with carbon materials can perform as a proper electrocatalyst, as carbon materials form a base structure and support the metal oxide growth on it with suitable morphology [24,25]. Instead of using pure carbon material, heteroatom-doped carbon (HC) materials like nitrogen-, oxygen-, phosphorous- and sulfur-doped carbon materials are effective, as these dopants (i) enhance the catalytic performance by increasing the interfacial charge transfer between the bimetal oxides and HC, and (ii) improve the stability of the electrocatalysts by binding well with the bimetallic species. The catalytic activity of these hybrid electrocatalysts (bimetal oxides along with HC) depends on their morphology, structure, dimension, crystal structure orientation, and the number of active sites. Therefore, an appropriate synthetic strategy should be adopted to extract the electrocatalytic property of the synthesized materials to their fullest [26\u201330]. There are many reports related to Ni- and Co-based electrocatalysts that could efficiently enhance the water-splitting process. Martini et al. [31]. synthesized nanocomposites with Ni and Co salts along with MoSe2 and MoS2 through hydrothermal and calcination methods. The work revealed that the synthesized nanocomposites, i.e., NiCoMo, CoMoSeS, CoMo, and NiCoMoSe, act as effective electrocatalysts regarding OER, with an overpotential at 10 mA cm\u22122 current density of 356, 375, 375, and 390 mV, respectively. Wen et al. [32] synthesized two different electrochemically active materials, viz., CoNi-ZIF-67 and hybrid CoNi-ZIF-67@Ti3C2Tx, through co-precipitation reaction. The work reports that the hybrid material, CoNi-ZIF-67@Ti3C2Tx, is effective regarding OER, showing a lower overpotential of 275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 than the pure CoNiZIF-67 (overpotential = 341 mV at \u03b7j = 10 mA cm\u22122). Zhang et al. [33] synthesized two different electrocatalysts, CoNi-MOFs and CoNi-MOFs-DBD, with multiple active sites by creating a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) and adopting low-temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma (DBD). The electrocatalysts, CoNi-MOFs-DBD, show a lower overpotential of 563 and 168 mV, respectively, at a current density of 40 mA cm\u22122 regarding OER and overpotential of 322 and 203 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, regarding HER. In all these works, the authors modified the metallic counterpart by preparing alloys, oxides, hydroxides, sulfurization, selenization, and creating oxygen vacancies, but the carbon part is not given much importance. Hence, in this work, we emphasized on both metal and carbon parts. In case of metal, we preferred the bimetallic oxides of Ni and Co to\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 3 of 16\ncreate multiple vacancies. The carbon part, containing different heteroatoms, was prepared from a polymer source (polybenzoxazine). The combination of heteroatom-containing carbon with bimetallic oxides can result in a 3D hierarchical structure when hydrothermal and calcination methods are adopted. The performance of the electrocatalyst regarding OER and HER was examined and discussed in detail."

Eu-Bzo is derived through Mannich condensation, where ethylenediamine (3 g), eugenol (16.42 g), and paraformaldehyde (6 g) were taken in 1:2:4 molar ratio and reacted for 3 h at 120 \u25e6C. The resulting product, containing Eu-Bzo, is precipitated in NaOH solution and left to dry completely overnight. Subsequently, the monomer undergoes a step-wise curing process up to 250 \u25e6C, transforming into a self-curing thermoset polymer known as poly(Eu-Bzo). The hetero-doped carbon was synthesized from this polymer. The formed polymer is subjected to heating at 600 \u25e6C in a nitrogen atmosphere, effectively eliminating oxygen and leaving behind a carbon skeleton. Next, the carbonized material undergoes activation with aqueous KOH (the ratio of KOH and carbon material is 2:1). This activation process introduces heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, into the carbon skeleton. Further activation of the resulting material occurs in a tubular furnace at 600 \u25e6C, leading to the production of the final product, HC (hetero-doped carbon)."

The solution is stirred at room temperature for 60 min. This step allows the metal salts to dissolve and interact with each other. Afterward, the resulting suspension is aged at room temperature for 12 h while air is bubbled throughout the process. This step oxidizes Ni and Co, which is necessary for the formation of the HC/NiCo oxide@600 composite. Next, the solution is sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 120 \u25e6C for 24 h. This step causes the metal salts to react and form the HC/NiCo oxide@600 composite. Once cooled to room temperature, the black powder formed is washed several times with DMF and EtOH and then dried overnight at 100 \u25e6C. This step removes any residual solvent and metal salts from the composite. For HC/NiCo oxide@600, the as-synthesized HC/NiCo (30 mg) is transferred to a tube furnace and heated up to 600 \u25e6C at a rate of 5 \u25e6C min\u22121 under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. This step further stabilizes the composite and gives it its final properties. Sample-700, Sample-800, and Sample-900 were prepared using the same procedure, but with different calcination temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 \u25e6C, respectively (Scheme 1).\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 4 of 16ol ers , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of\nScheme 1.

Subsequently, the HC/NiCo material underwent calcination at various temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 \u25e6C. It was observed that the optimal temperature for obtaining the desired 3D structure was 800 \u25e6C. Thus, the calcination temperature significantly influences the formation of the 3D hierarchical morphology.

The XRD patterns of HC/NiCo, calcined at different temperatures, are shown in Figure 1a. The figure reveals that the diffraction peaks correspond to the cubic planes of NiCo oxide [(111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (620)] at distinct 2\u03b8 values. These peaks indicate that the NiCo oxides are well crystallized and have a high degree of phase purity (JCPDS no. 73-1702). In addition to the NiCo peaks, a broad diffraction peak is observed between 15 and 30\u25e6. This peak is attributed to the characteristic (002) plane of the hexagonal graphitic structure of carbon. The broadening of this peak suggests that the carbon in HC/NiCo oxide is not highly graphitized [34\u201337]. This is likely due to the presence of the bimetallic NiCo oxide, which disrupts the ordered arrangement of the carbon atoms. As a result, the carbon in HC/NiCo oxide has a lower degree of graphitization than pure carbon [11,14,19]. The results of the XRD analysis show that HC/NiCo oxide is a highly crystalline material with a high degree of phase purity. However, the carbon in HC/NiCo oxide is not highly graphitized, likely due to the presence of the bimetallic NiCo oxide. This has implications for the catalytic properties of HC/NiCo oxide, as the degree of graphitization of the carbon can affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. In addition to the XRD analysis, other techniques can be used to investigate the structure and properties of HC/NiCo oxide. For example, SEM and TEM can be used to visualize the morphology of the NiCo oxide and the carbon matrix. Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the degree of graphitization of the carbon.

The survey spectrum (Figure 2a) confirms the presence of C, N, O, Co, and Ni elements. The intensity of the O 1s peak is greater than that of the N 1s peak, suggesting that the oxygen atoms come from both the carbon surface and the formation of bimetallic oxides. To gain a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry, the spectra for each element were deconvoluted. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Figure 2b) is resolved into four peaks: 284.2 eV (C=C carbon of the aromatic ring), 285.4 eV (C\u2013C single bond), 287.5 eV (carbonyl carbon, C=O/C\u2013O), and 290.6 eV (C\u2013N carbon). The N 1s spectrum (Figure 2c) is deconvoluted into three peaks, representing different nitrogen forms: pyridinic N at 397.8 eV, pyrrolic N at 399.6 eV, and quaternary N at 401.3 eV. The presence of these different nitrogen species enhances the capacitance of the material, with pyridinic and pyrrolic N participating in pseudo-capacitive interactions and quaternary N improving the carbon material\u2019s conductivity through efficient ion transfer. The O 1s spectrum (Figure 2d) is deconvoluted into three peaks: a dominant peak at 530.7 eV attributed to metal\u2013oxygen bonds, and two smaller peaks at 531.9 and 533.1 eV corresponding to surface-adsorbed hydroxyl (\u2013OH) and carbonyl (C\u2013O) oxygens, respectively. The presence of oxygen atoms enhances the wettability of the electrode material and its overall capacitance. The bimetallic components, Co and Ni, were also analyzed. The deconvoluted spectrum of Co 2p (Figure 2e) shows two spin states at 781.6 and 797.4 eV corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, along with satellite peaks indicating the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+.

            "text": "The synergistic effect of bimetal oxides and heteroatom-doped carbon (HC/NiCo oxide) is expected to enhance the OER activity in water-splitting process. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized materials was analyzed using a three electrode system,\nsynergistic effect of bimetal oxides and heteroatom-doped carbon (HC/NiCo oxide) is exp cted to e hanc the OER activity in water-splitting process. The electrohemical performance of t ynthesiz d materi ls was analyzed using a th ee lectrode system, where HC/NiCo oxide is used as working electrode against Hg/HgO as reference electrode with Pt as counter electrode using 1 M KOH electrolytic solution. Figure 5 depicts the electrochemical measurements of HC/NiCo oxide electrodes toward OER. As can be seen from the LSV measurements (Figure 5a), the overpotential corresponding to the current density of 10 mA/cm\u22122 was found to be 350 mV for HC/NiCo oxide@600; 295 mV for HC/NiCo oxide@700; 280 mV for HC/NiCo oxide@800; and 330 mV for HC/NiCo oxide@900. Among the prepared materials, HC/NiCo oxide@800 exhibits the lowest overpotential of 280 mV with the lowest Tafel slope of 59.24 mV dec\u22121 (Figure 5b). This could be attributed to the fact that the bimetallic oxides are enclosed by the carbon material, which prevents the corrosion of bimetals in an alkali solution. By doing so, the carbon material paves the way for electron transition from the transition metal oxides and thus accelerates the oxygen evolution reaction. As can be evidenced by the SEM images, a proper morphol-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 11 of 16\nogy is obtained at a calcination temperature of 800 \u25e6C and thus HC/NiCo oxide@800 can provide a continuous pathway for electron transfer through the hierarchical 3D morphology, exhibiting a lower overpotential value. These overpotential values are much lower or comparable to previously reported works: 356 mV for NiCoMo [4]; 275 mV for CoNi-ZIF67 [5]; 563 mV at 40 mA cm\u22122 current density for CoNi-MOFs-DBD; and 290 mV for NC-2@CoO. Figure 5c displays the double-layer capacitance obtained from the CV measurements in the non-Faradaic region at different scan rates. The Cdl values were found to be 11.24, 6.25, 5.88, and 8.23 mF cm\u22122 for HC/NiCo oxide@600, HC/NiCo oxide@700, HC/NiCo oxide@800, and HC/NiCo oxide@900, respectively. The higher Cdl value implies larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Even though HC/NiCo oxide@600 possess larger surface area, its surface is not effective in transferring electrons during the electrochemical process. Even with low surface area and proper morphology, HC/NiCo oxide@800 could effectively transfer electrons, showing enhanced electrocatalytic activity regarding OER [44\u201346]. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 12 of 16\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to evaluate the kinetics of the electrocatalytic process. Figure 5d represents the EIS spectra of the prepared materials. The EIS spectra reveals that among the four materials, HC/NiCo oxide@800 has the lowest Rct (charge transfer resistance) of 1.08 \u2126, evidenced by the smallest semicircle, when compared with others (7.67 \u2126 for HC/NiCo oxide@600; 3.1 \u2126 for HC/NiCo oxide@700; and 4.8 \u2126 for HC/NiCo oxide@900). This is attributed to the fact that the interconnected 3D flower-like morphology formed from the HC and bimetal oxides paves the way for effective electron transfer from the highly conductive HC to bimetal oxides, thereby reducing their charge transfer resistance. The electrochemical stability of HC/NiCo oxide@800 was measured at different potentials with varying current densities from 10 to 100 mA cm\u22122 for 12 h and displayed in Figure 5e, and the inset of the figure displays the stability at 10 mA cm\u22122 current density for 20 h. There is only a very slight decrease in current densities from lower to higher region, indicating the enhanced electrochemical stability of the prepared material. Figure 5f depicts the LSV curves before and after the stability measurement, showing a slight shift from the original spectrum, indicating the long-term stability of the electrocatalytic material. The electrocatalytic behavior of the prepared materials regarding HER was measured using LSV and depicted in Figure 6a. The figure shows an overpotential value at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 to be 300, 250, 186 and 275 mV for HC/NiCo oxide@600, HC/NiCo oxide@700, HC/NiCo oxide@800, and HC/NiCo oxide@900, respectively. Tafel plots were constructed using logarithmic current density against potential, represented in Figure 6b, and the Tafel slopes were found to be 113 mV dec\u22121 for HC/NiCo oxide@600; 81 mV dec\u22121 for HC/NiCo oxide@700; 76 mV dec\u22121 for HC/NiCo oxide@800; and 96 mV dec\u22121 for HC/NiCo oxide@900. It could be seen that HC/NiCo oxide@800 has the lowest overpotential value of 186 mV and a Tafel slope value of 76 mV dec\u22121. This proves that a perfect 3D hierarchical structure along with sufficient surface area helps in creating more active sites that could predominantly transfer electrons continuously via interconnected petal-like morphology and thus result in lower overpotential value. The obtained value regarding HER is much lower than the previously reported works; using Co and Ni: at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, CoNi-MOFs displayed an overpotential of 322 mV, and CoNi-MOFs-DBD-2mins displayed an overpotential of 203 mV regarding HER [47,48]. It can be clearly visualized that bimetallic oxides along with heteroatom-doped porous carbon synergistically improved the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, the electrochemical stability of HC/NiCo oxide@800 was assessed at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122, represented in Figure 6c, exhibiting excellent stability for 20 h. The LSV (Figure 6d), measured after 20 h, shows a very slight variation from the LSV measurement taken before stability analysis. This further proves that HC/NiCo oxide@800 has excellent structural stability that could be retained even after stability measurements.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3588 13 of 16\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 16\nergistically improved the electrocatalytic performance.
