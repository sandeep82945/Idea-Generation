1. **Investigate the in vivo efficacy of DBNs 1, 2, and 4 against T. cruzi infection in animal models.** This would involve administering the compounds to infected animals and monitoring the course of infection to determine if the compounds can effectively suppress parasite growth and reduce symptoms of disease.


2. **Explore the potential of DBNs 1, 2, and 4 as broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents.** This could involve testing the compounds against other species of Trypanosoma, as well as against other protozoan parasites such as Leishmania and Plasmodium.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of DBNs 1, 2, and 4 against T. cruzi.** This could involve studying the effects of the compounds on tubulin polymerization and other cellular processes that are essential for parasite survival.


4. **Design and synthesize new DBNs with improved antitrypanosomal activity and reduced toxicity.** This could involve modifying the structure of the compounds to improve their binding affinity for tubulin or other targets, or to reduce their toxicity to mammalian cells.


5. **Investigate the potential of DBNs 1, 2, and 4 as adjuvants for vaccines against T. cruzi infection.** This could involve formulating the compounds with vaccine candidates to enhance the immune response and provide protection against infection.
