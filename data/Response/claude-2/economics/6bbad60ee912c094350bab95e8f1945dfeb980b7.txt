 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the long-term effects of not implementing a lockdown in Sweden by looking at excess mortality over a longer time period, such as through 2021 and 2022. This could provide insights into whether the increased mortality was just displaced mortality or represented a permanent increase. 

2. Conduct similar analyses looking at excess mortality in other countries that did not implement lockdowns, such as Belarus. Comparing results across multiple countries could strengthen the evidence for or against lockdown policies.

3. Examine the effects of voluntary behavioral changes versus mandatory lockdowns on excess mortality. The paper suggests Swedes still reduced mobility without a lockdown, so quantifying this could shed light on the relative impacts of policy versus voluntary action.

4. Look at cause-specific excess mortality, such as for cardiovascular diseases or cancer, to see which causes were most affected by not locking down. This could reveal important details about how the pandemic mortality effects manifested.

5. Analyze the cost-benefit tradeoff of lockdowns more comprehensively, incorporating factors like economic impacts, mental health, deferred healthcare, and more. The paper acknowledges that mortality is not the only consideration, so a more holistic evaluation could better inform policy.
