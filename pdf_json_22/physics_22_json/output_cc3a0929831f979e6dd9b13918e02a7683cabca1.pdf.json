This method is based on surface integral equations dealing with equivalent magnetic and electric surface current densities. Many works have shown the potentiality of BEM especially for the modeling of non-destructive testing devices. In this paper, after selecting formulations enabling the modeling of multiply-connected regions, an original coupling is proposed in order to take into account external electric circuit in the problem.\nIndex Terms\u2014Boundary Element Method, eddy currents, quasi-static, circuit coupling.\nTHIS study is motivated by the need of efficient quasi-static electromagnetic formulations associated to nonsimply connected domains and which can be coupled with circuit equations. For this kind of problems, methods based on coupling between BEM and Finite Element Method (FEM) have already shown very good results. However, the accuracy of these methods is strongly influenced by the volume mesh of the conductive region which has to be adapted to the skindepth in the FEM context. The pure BEM method does not suffer from this disadvantage because it is only based on surface discretizations and is more insensitive to frequency increase keeping the same mesh.\nMany BEM formulations have already been proposed to solve Eddy Current (EC) problems and two options are possible. The first one consists in solving the full Maxwell equations including capacitive effects and to use an HelmholtzHodge decomposition to remove low-frequency numerical noise like proposed in [1]. The second option is to solve directly Maxwell equations under the quasi-static assumption (i.e the EC problem) as proposed in [3],[4] or [5]. In this work, the preference is given to the last approach.\nIn classical EC problems (like eddy current testing problems for instance), the active region can be multiply connected, meaning that it can have through-holes. It is fundamental to develop formulations which can solve accurately such a problem. An another key point is the ability of the formulation to be coupled with external electric circuits which create the external inductor field. This is what we aim to do in this paper. After selecting efficient BEM formulations for EC problems, an original circuit coupling is proposed. All the formulations are validated on numerous examples by a comparison with FEM."

I.\nThe obtained formulations called from EC1 to EC6. EC1 and EC2 have already been presented in [3]. EC4, EC5 with a combination such as the PMCWHT formulation was presented in [1], [5]. EC5 was proposed in [4], the idea of combination comes from formulation of Muller [7]. The EC6 formulation has been added to complete the set of combinations.\nB. Choice of BEM formulation\nFormulations in Tab. I are now examined in the context of a low frequency eddy current problem. A conductive ring (rint = 4mm, rext = 10mm,h = 2mm) is considered. An excitation coil is placed 1mm above (rint = 6.75mm, rext = 7.25mm,h = 0.5mm, I = 10A, 1 turn). The surface of the ring is discretized by 1792 quadrangle elements. The current density Ms, Js are interpolated by the facet shape function (2-form Whitney elements) and the 0-form Whitney elements for E0n.\nMs = nM\u2211 i=1 wiMsi, Js = nJ\u2211 i=1 wiJsi, E0n = nE\u2211 i=1 \u03b1iE0ni.\nwhere nM , nJ , nE are numbers of degree of freedom corresponding to Ms,Js and E0n. Using the Galerkin approach, we perform calculations with frequencies ranging from 10Hz to 100kHz for each formulation. The reference result is computed by axisymmetric finite element method. Figure 1 shows the relative loss in three cases respectively: \u03c3 = 5.5E7, \u00b5r = 1 (case 1), \u03c3 = 5.5E6, \u00b5r = 10 (case 2), \u03c3 = 5.5E5, \u00b5r = 100 (case 3). The skin depth varies from 21.46mm to 0.21mm in these cases.

That\u2019s why we don\u2019t show results of EC1 formulations. For the circuit coupling problem, it is necessary to have the magnetic potential A outside the conductor (see next section) which depends on E0n. In EC4, this quantity is not computed. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t test this formulation. The number of candidate formulations for circuit coupling is then reduced to EC2, EC3, EC5 and EC6, which are compatible with multiply connected problems and enable the computation of the magnetic vector potential outside. In the case of non-magnetic conductivity, the results obtained with EC2, EC5 and EC6 lead to a better accuracy than EC3 up to a few kHz. However, with a higher frequency, EC3 becomes more accurate. In the case of conductive and magnetic material, when relative permeability is high at 100, all three formulations give poor results, especially for EC3, EC6 at a frequency below 10kHz and for EC2, EC5 at a frequency above 1kHz. With a lower magnetic permeability \u00b5r = 10, EC2 gives better results than the others in the frequency range considered.Let us notice that if an iterative solver like GMRES is used, EC6 presents the best convergence rate."

In the context of circuit coupling, the conducting region \u2126 is excited by a set of n electrical circuits in which the kth electrical circuit \u2126sk is connected to voltage sources Uk. The governing equation is (18). Let us consider (2).

Resolution\nBoth eddy current BEM formulations and their coupling with electric circuits are solved simultaneously. According to (5), the electric and magnetic source fields in BEM formulations can be represented by integral depending on Ik which are additional unknowns. The final matrix system to solve is presented in Fig. 2.\nIn the system, Ms(nM\u00d71), Js(nJ\u00d71), En0(nE\u00d71) are vectors of the degrees of freedom corresponding to Ms, Js and En0. The matrix M11 is constructed as the one used to solve the single eddy current problem by BEM formulation. The M11 matrix is built like the one used to solve the eddy current problem by BEM formulation. Let\u2019s establish the matrices M12, M21 and M22. The current density js0k is interpolated also by the facet shape function:\njs0k =\nnk\u2211\ni=1\nwkijki\nwhere jki can be determinded thanks to the pre-computation of the electrokinetic current density j0k discussed in the section III.B. Suppose that the M21 matrix is composed of three parts N1, N2, N3 corresponding to three sets of unknown Ms, Js, En0 respectively.

Validation\nThe circuit coupling has been tested with EC6 formulation. A conductive square section ring is taken into account. The system is excited by an external circuit, which is concentric and coaxial with the ring. The geometric and property descriptions are shown in Tab. II and Fig. 3. In BEM, the geometry is meshed with about 2464 quadrangle elements. The reference is calculated by the FEM method with a 2D axisymmetric model and a circuit coupling in which a mesh of 43500 triangles is used. The total currents flowing in the electrical circuit are compared in Tab. III. The magnetic flux density is calculated on line segment A(28.5, 0, 5) \u2212 B(28.5, 0, 30) at frequency f = 10Hz and shown in Fig. 4. The component By = 0 is not displayed in the figure.

Validation\nThe circuit coupling has been tested with EC6 formulation. A conductive square section ring is taken into account. The sy tem is excited by an external circuit, which is concentric and coaxial with the ring. The geometric and property descriptions are shown in Tab. II and Fig. 3. In BEM, the geometry is meshed with about 2464 quadrangle l ments. The reference is calculated by the FEM method with a 2D axisym etric model and a circuit coupling in which a mesh of 4350 triangles is used. The to al currents flowing in the el ctrical circuit are compared in Tab. III. The magnetic flux density is calculated on line segment A(28.5, 0, 5) \u2212 B(28.5, 0, 30) at frequency f = 10Hz and shown in Fig. 4. The component By = 0 is not displayed in the figure. The eddy current distribution in this case is hown in Fig 3.\nTABLE II PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS\nRing with square section Electrical circuit Conductivity 3.526E7 (S/m) Imposed voltage 10 (V) Relative permeability 1 Height/width 5 (mm) Height 60 (mm) Number of turns 100 External radius 25 (mm) External radius 31 (mm) Internal radius 10 (mm) Internal radius 26 (mm)\nTABLE III CURRENT IN THE EXTERNAL ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT\nThe BEM circuit coupling leads to results very close to those calculated by FEM method with a axisymetric model.

CONCLUSION In this article, different formulations for the eddy current problem have been recalled and compared at low frequency. These formulations generally work well with low relative permeability. A coupling model that simultaneously solves the eddy current and electrical circuit equations has also been proposed.\nREFERENCES [1] Vigneron A.
