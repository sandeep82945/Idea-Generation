    "abstractText": "In this study, the conversion mechanisms and kinetics of propadiene (CH2]C]CH2) induced by NO3 were researched using density functional theory (DFT) and transition state theory (TST) measurements. The NO3addition pathways to generate IM1 (CH2ONO2CCH2) and IM2 (CH2CONO2CH2) play a significant role. P3 (CH2CONOCHO + H) was the dominant addition/elimination product. Moreover, the results manifested that one H atom from the \u2013CH2\u2013 group has to be abstracted by NO3 radicals, leading to the final product h-P1 (CH2CCH + HNO3). Due to the high barrier, the H-abstraction pathway is not important for the propadiene + NO3 reaction. In addition, the computed ktot value of propadiene reacting with NO3 at 298 K is 3.34 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm per molecule per s, which is in accordance with the experimental value. The computed lifetime of propadiene oxidized by NO3 radicals was assessed to be 130.16\u20136.08 days at 200\u2013 298 K and an altitude of 0\u201312 km. This study provides insights into the transformation of propadiene in a complex environment.",

The NO3addition pathways to generate IM1 (CH2ONO2CCH2) and IM2 (CH2CONO2CH2) play a significant role. P3 (CH2CONOCHO + H) was the dominant addition/elimination product. Moreover, the results manifested that one H atom from the \u2013CH2\u2013 group has to be abstracted by NO3 radicals, leading to the final product h-P1 (CH2CCH + HNO3). Due to the high barrier, the H-abstraction pathway is not important for the propadiene + NO3 reaction. In addition, the computed ktot value of propadiene reacting with NO3 at 298 K is 3.34 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm3 per molecule per s, which is in accordance with the experimental value. The\ncomputed lifetime of propadiene oxidized by NO3 radicals was assessed to be 130.16\u20136.08 days at 200\u2013 298 K and an altitude of 0\u201312 km.

            "text": "During daytime, the main oxidants in the troposphere are OH radicals; at night, because there is no photochemical reaction in the troposphere, the concentration of OH radicals decreases sharply, NO3 radicals and O3 become the main oxidants,1\u20133 and nocturnal chemistry develops with NO3 and N2O5 as the center. NO3 can react with a series of volatile organic compounds to degrade them.4 However, NO3 can be directly converted into nitrate via a heterogeneous reaction or converted into N2H5 and then reacted with water or aerosol to be removed from the atmosphere, resulting in the removal of NOx.5 Propadiene (CH2]C]CH2) has been measured in planetary atmospheres and in combustion.6,7 In recent years, the reactions of NO3 with unsaturated hydrocarbons have been a subject of many experimental investigations.8\u201316 The reactions of NO3 withmany other small hydrocarbons have been poorly characterized.

However, Grosjean et al.24 measured the rate coefficients at 298 K for the reaction of NO3 with C3H4 (3.39 \u00d7 10\n\u221215 cm3 per molecule per s in air). Moreover, Arrhenius exponential factor, activation energy and product distribution have not yet been identied for the reaction of NO3 with C3H4. Previous investigations of the reactions of NO3 with saturated hydrocarbons have indicated that the Habstraction pathways dominate the reaction,25 and the addition/ elimination pathways dominate the reactions of NO3 with unsaturated hydrocarbons at room temperature.26\u201329 According to similar size and structure, the reaction of NO3 with propadiene could be estimated to be similar to those of ethylene and propylene based on their similar size and structure. To date, no theoretical work has been reported on the reaction of NO3 with propadiene. Thus, we decided to employ a theoretical investigation of the reaction of NO3 with propadiene for two purposes: (i) to rationalize the reported experimental data and (ii) to put forward a point of mechanistic view for exhaustive NO3-oxidation processes."

Here, we will research the pathways of NO3-addition to the C]C bond and the H-extraction from the C\u2013H bonds in detail.\nAs revealed in Fig. 1, the NO3-association could react via two unequal reaction channels owing to the difference of the carbon atom in the C]C bond of CH2]C]CH2 molecules. The NO3\u2013 C3H4 adduct isomers can be generated via NO3 addition to a-C atom and b-C atom of CH2]C]CH2 via TS1 and TS2, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 1. The corresponding intermediates are denoted as IM1 (CH2ONO2CCH2) and IM2 (CH2CONO2CH2). In TS1 and TS2, the reactive C\u2013O bonds are 2.046 and 2.108 \u00c5, respectively. The energy of TS1 is 0.71 kcal mol\u22121 lower than that of TS2, suggesting that the a-C-association is superior to the b-C-association. In addition, IM1 could rearrange as IM2 needing to overcome 27.04 kcal mol\u22121 barrier via an annular transition state TS3, which is 5.01 kcal mol\u22121 higher than TS1, indicating that this interconversion process might contribute less to the CH2]C]CH2 + NO3 reaction. IM1 and IM2 are activated C-centered radicals, which are 17.37 and 42.38 kcal mol\u22121 more stable than NO3 + CH2CCH2.

This IM5 / TS11 / P4 is exothermic by 83.24 kcal mol\u22121. The second pathway begins with a 1,3-H shi from the C atom in the \u2013 CH2ONO group to the other terminal-C atom in IM5, accompanied by the \u2013NO group leaving away to generate P5 (CH3COCHO + NO). This stepwise channel goes through a HCCC four-centered ring structure TS12 with 50.35 kcal mol\u22121 barrier height. The third channel is to generate the P6 (CH2COHCHO + NO) via a HCCO four-centered ring structure TS13 overcoming a barrier of 55.85 kcal mol\u22121. The order of the barrier heights for the above-mentioned three decomposition pathways is TS11 (37.35 kcal mol\u22121) < TS12 (50.35 kcal mol\u22121) < TS13\n21386 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 21383\u201321392\n(55.85 kcal mol\u22121).

The barrier heights of IM6 / TS15 / P7 and IM6 / TS16 / P8 are 12.57 and 47.26 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. Therefore, the pathway of generation of P7 (CH3COCH + NO2) from IM6may be signicant to the NO3 + CH2]C]CH2 reaction. However, the high isomerization barrier of IM2/ TS14/ IM6 prevents the generation of the P7 pathway from taking place.\nOnly one H-extraction channel is discovered for the CH2] C]CH2 + NO3 reaction. The oxygen atom of NO3 could extract the H atom in the \u2013CH2 group of CH2]C]CH2 through TS17 to generate h-P1 (CH2CCH + HNO3), and the H-extraction is exothermic by 11.93 kcal mol\u22121. The barrier of the H-extraction is 10.25 kcal mol\u22121, which is 5.59 and 4.88 kcal mol\u22121 higher than that of TS1 and TS2, respectively. Thus, the H-extraction pathway is less competitive than the addition/elimination pathway for the CH2]C]CH2 + NO3 reaction."

Unfortunately, these methods are too complex to be used in our multi-channel RRKM program.\nTo check the reliability of such a simplication, we estimated the tunneling effect qualitatively. An asymmetric Eckart potential43 was used to calculate the tunneling factor k(T). For the addition mechanism, k(T) was always in the range 1.2\u20131.0 from 200 to 3000 K.
