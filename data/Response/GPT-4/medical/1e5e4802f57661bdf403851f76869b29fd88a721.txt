Exploring the Effects of Different Types of Ability Grouping on Subjective Well-Being: Investigate the impacts of within-school and course-by-course tracking on students' life and school satisfaction. This research could examine whether different forms of ability grouping have distinct effects on adolescents' subjective well-being, considering the nuances between various tracking systems.

Understanding the Role of Classroom-Level Achievement Composition: Conduct a detailed analysis of how class-level achievement composition influences students' life satisfaction and school satisfaction. This study would delve deeper into the Big-Fish-Little-Pond effect by focusing on the more immediate academic environment of the classroom, which may have a stronger impact on students' subjective well-being compared to school-level achievement composition.

Longitudinal Studies on the Development of Subjective Well-Being in Upper Secondary School: Extend the current research to include upper secondary school years to understand the longer-term trajectories of life satisfaction and school satisfaction. This could help identify any recovery or further decline in subjective well-being during later adolescence, providing insights into critical periods for intervention.

Examining the Influence of Institutional Resources and Social Comparison Processes: Explore how variations in institutional resources (e.g., teacher quality, extracurricular activities) and the nature of social comparison within school tracks affect students' subjective well-being. This research could help disentangle the complex interactions between environmental factors and individual perceptions of well-being.

Interventions to Improve School Satisfaction During Secondary School Transitions: Develop and evaluate intervention programs aimed at supporting students through the transition to secondary school, focusing on enhancing school satisfaction. These interventions could target aspects like school engagement, peer relationships, and coping strategies to mitigate the decline in school satisfaction and potentially life satisfaction as well.
