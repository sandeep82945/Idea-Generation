            "text": "Thyroid hormone (TH) effects are mediated through TH receptors (TRs) TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, and\nTR\u03b22. The TRs bind to thyroid hormone responsive elements on the DNA and regulate\nexpression of TH target genes as ligand dependent transcription factors (canonical signaling).\nIn addition, the TRs \u03b1 and \u03b2 mediate activation of signaling pathways, e.g. the PI3K/AKT and\nMAPK/ERK pathways (noncanonical signaling). Whether such DNA-binding independent TR\naction contributes to the spectrum of physiological TH effects is largely unknown. The aim of\nthis study was to attribute physiological effects to the two TR isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 and their\ncanonical and noncanonical signaling. We conducted multi-parameter phenotyping in male and female TR knockout mice (TR\u03b1KO, TR\u03b2KO), mice with disrupted canonical signaling due to a mutation in the TR DNA-binding domain (TR\u03b1GS, TR\u03b2GS) and their respective wild-type\nlittermates. Perturbations in senses, especially hearing (mainly TR\u03b2 with a lesser impact of\nTR\u03b1), visual acuity and retinal thickness (TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2), in muscle metabolism (TR\u03b1) and in\nheart rate (TR\u03b1) highlighted the role of canonical TR action. Strikingly, selective abrogation of\ncanonical TR action often had little to no phenotypic consequence, suggesting that\nnoncanonical TR action sufficed to maintain the wild-type phenotype for specific effects. For\ninstance, macrocytic anemia, reduced retinal vascularization or increased anxiety related behavior were only observed in TR\u03b1KO, but not TR\u03b1GS mice. Noncanonical TR\u03b1 action increased the efficiency of energy utilization and prevented hyperphagia observed in TR\u03b1KO\nmice. In summary, by examining the phenotypes of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 knockout models alongside\ntheir DNA-binding-deficient GS mutants and wildtype counterparts, we could establish that the\nindependent noncanonical actions of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 play a crucial role in modulating sensory,\nbehavioral, and metabolic functions. This comparison underscores the significance of the TRs\nin orchestrating a spectrum of physiological processes beyond their traditional genomic\npathways."

            "text": "Thyroid hormone (TH; T4, 3,5,3\u2019,5\u2019-tetraiodothyroxine, thyroxine and its active form T3, 3,5,3\u2019- triiodothyronine, thyronine) is essential for development and physiology 1. TH effects are\nmediated through TH receptors (TRs) TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, and TR\u03b22. The TRs bind to thyroid\nhormone responsive elements (TREs) on the DNA and regulate expression of TH target genes\nas ligand dependent transcription factors. This TR action by direct binding of TRs to DNA is referred to as canonical or type 1 signaling TH/TR action 2,3. In addition, the TRs \u03b1 and \u03b2\nmediate activation of pathways including phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT and MAPK/ERK 4-8, which is known as noncanonical or type 3 TH/TR signaling.\nTo determine TR isoform functions, knockout (KO) mice for TRs \u03b1 and \u03b2 have been generated 9. Studies of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 KO mice allowed the characterization of TR isoform functions.\nPredominantly TR\u03b1-regulated are bone development and linear growth, maturation of the small\nintestine and heart rate, whereas TSH suppression and hepatic gene expression are predominantly regulated by TR\u03b2 10.\nAn important question is whether DNA-binding independent noncanonical TR actions\ncontribute to the overall physiological effect of TH. While studies of TR KO mice revealed the\ncontribution of the TR isoforms, they could not determine the mode of TR action underlying the\nphysiological effects, whether canonical or noncanonical, because both modes of action are\npresent in WT mice but absent in TR KO mice. To determine whether DNA binding of TRs is\nrequired for physiological effects, we generated mouse models with a mutation in the P box of\nthe DNA-binding domain (DBD), leading to substitution of the first two amino acid (EGG to GSG) of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 were generated (referred to as TR\u03b1GS and TR\u03b2GS mice, respectively).\nIn vitro EMSA, luciferase reporter assays, ChIP, ChIP-Seq and microarray studies from mouse\nliver samples confirmed the loss of DNA binding, histone acetylation and transcriptional activity of TR\u03b2 due to the GS mutation 11-13. This mutation specifically abrogates DNA-binding to TREs\nwhile preserving noncanonical TR action. This approach allows us to discern the necessity of\nDNA binding in eliciting physiological effects, providing valuable insights into the intricate\nmechanisms of TR-mediated actions. Comparing WT, TR KO, and TR DNA-binding-deficient\nGS mice clarified each TR isoform's role in thyroid hormone action and the requirement of DNA\nbinding for their physiological effects: Arterial vasodilation was identified as a rapid\nnoncanonical TR\u03b1 effect, whereas longitudinal growth and bone development were regulated by canonical TR\u03b1 action 13,14. Negative feedback in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis\ndepended on DNA binding of TR\u03b2, whereas liver triglyceride content and rapid effects on blood glucose appeared to be regulated by noncanonical TR\u03b2 action 13. This prompted us to\nundertake a much broader approach and assess the contribution of canonical and\nnoncanonical TR signaling to multiple physiological parameters. Specifically, we compared male and female TR\u03b1KO, TR\u03b1GS, TR\u03b2KO, and TR\u03b2GS mice with their respective WT littermates\nin a comprehensive multi-parameter phenotyping screen ranging from clinical chemistry and\nenergy metabolism to eye and ear function and behavioral tests, with the aim to attribute\nphysiological effects to the two TR isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 and their canonical and noncanonical\nsignaling."

Studies were performed in accordance with the German regulations for\nLaboratory Animal Science (GVSOLAS) and the European Health Law of the Federation of\nLaboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) (84-02.04.2017.A157 and 84- 02.04.2014.A092). TR\u03b1 KO (TR\u03b10) and TR\u03b2 KO (TRb-) mice 9,15 mice, here referred to as\nTR\u03b1KO and TRbKO, respectively, were acquired from the European Mouse Mutant Archive\n(https://www.infrafrontier.eu). TR\u03b1GS and TRbGS mutant mice were created with a zinc finger\nnuclease approach as described previously 13. Mice were bred and housed in the central\nanimal facility at the University Hospital Essen. All mice were housed in individually ventilated\ncages (IVC) at 21\u00b11 \u00b0C or 22\u00b11 \u00b0C (GMC) in an alternating 12:12 hour light-dark cycle with\nstandard chow and tap water provided according to University Hospital Essen and GMC\nstandard housing conditions (https://www.mouseclinic.de/about-gmc/mouse-\nhusbandry/index.html), respectively. Mice were bred at the same time and subsequently\nmarked with ear punches. They were genotyped at the age of 3-4 weeks and sent to the GMC\nat the age of 6 weeks via overnight shipping. Upon arrival they were housed for 2 weeks before\nthey entered the phenotyping pipeline. Male and female mice were compared which allowed\nto detect not only canonical and noncanonical TR effects, but also sex-related differences as\nwell.\nMouse phenotyping pipeline At the German Mouse Clinic female and male TR\u03b1KO, TR\u03b1GS, TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mouse cohorts\nand corresponding wild type controls were subjected to an extensive phenotypic screening in\nthe areas of behavior, neurology, energy metabolism, cardiology, eye, clinical chemistry, immunology and pathology 16,17 (www.mouseclinic.de).\nA cohort of 10 male and 10 female TR\u03b2KO was compared with an equivalent number of control males and females. Similarly, 10 male and 10 female TR\u03b2GS were compared to the same number of control males and females. Additionally, 12 male and 12 female TR\u03b1KO were compared to 15 male and female controls, and 15 male and 15 female TR\u03b1GS compared to 14\nmales and 15 female controls. The phenotyping measurements were taken from weeks 8 to 16 for TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS, and weeks 9 to 19 for TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS. Assignment of experimental\ngroups was based on the genotype of the animals, and metadata for each data point were\nrecorded throughout the measurements.\nThe phenotypic tests were part of the GMC screening pipeline and performed according to standardized protocols as described before 18-23.

Compared to TR\u03b1 mutant mice, both TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice showed a much more severe hearing loss across the entire\nfrequency spectrum with no difference between the two mutant strains, suggesting that normal\nhearing requires canonical TR\u03b2 action (Fig. 1B).\nThe acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of both TR\u03b1 mutant genotypes did\nnot differ from their WT littermates (Fig. S1). Global PPI, calculated as the mean PPI [%] for the different prepulse responses, was decreased in TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice (Fig. 1C). Both\nTR\u03b2 mutant lines showed significantly reduced PPI at intensities of 67 dB and 69 dB but\nreached levels similar to their WT controls at 73 dB and 81 dB (Fig. 1D). The startle amplitude with a stimulus of 110 dB was slightly but not significantly reduced in TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice (Fig. 1E), whereas prepulse-alone trials confirmed a generally lower startle amplitude in TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice (Fig. 1F). The reduced responses to prepulses up to 69 dB and the reduced\nstartle amplitude up to 81 dB in TR\u03b2 mutant mice, along with the absence of differences\nbetween TR\u03b1 mutant mice and WT mice, is consistent with the possibility that the apparent\nimpaired sensorimotor gating in this case reflects the hearing impairment in the mutant mice\ncompared to TR\u03b1 mutant mice.\nSimilar results had been previously found in TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 KO mice, supporting the conclusion\nthat TR\u03b21 serves as the major mediator of TH action in the ear, while TR\u03b1 action is also necessary for complete auditory function 24-28. It was suggested that patients with RTH\u03b1\n(resistance to thyroid hormone \u03b1) may also suffer from mild hearing loss and the present data support this hypothesis. We did not detect differences between TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice at 15 weeks of age although less pronounced hearing loss had been reported in 8-week-old TR\u03b2GS mice 12 and cannot exclude the possibility of progressive hearing loss between weeks 8 and\n15."

But retinal thickness was decreased in female TR\u03b1 (TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS) and TR\u03b2 mutants (TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS) (Fig. 2A). Compared to WT mice, the number of main fundus vessels was decreased in male and female TR\u03b1KO but not in TR\u03b1GS mice (Fig. 2B). This similarity between TR\u03b1GS and\nWT mice suggests that noncanonical TR\u03b1 action contributes to retinal vascularization. The\nspatial frequency threshold, determined with a virtual optokinetic drum as a measure of visual acuity, was decreased in TR\u03b1KO mice whereas TR\u03b1GS mice were less affected (Fig 2C, left\npanel). Similarly, this phenotype was observed in TRbKO mice but not in TRbGS mice (Fig. 2C,\nright panel). The impairment of visual acuity and retinal development in TR\u03b2KO mice is expected. TR\u03b22\nregulates cone maturation and the expression of the light-sensing pigment protein cone opsin 29,30. In a previous study of TR\u03b2GS and TR\u03b2KO mice, both showed S opsin expression in\nsignificantly more dorsal regions compared to WT mice, along with an absence of M opsin\nexpression throughout the retina, which demonstrated that the DNA-binding function of TR\u03b2 is essential for cone opsin gene expression in the retina 12. The absence of canonical TR\u03b2 action\nappears to impair the development and maturation of the retina, resulting in reduced thickness,\nwhich together may contribute to the impaired visual function. Furthermore, female hypothyroid\nrats studied between embryonal day E19 and postnatal day P5 demonstrated reduced global\nand layer-specific retinal thickness, neuroblast size and density, ganglion cell density, and mitotic index 31, which appears to correspond to the reduced thickness observed here,\nespecially in female TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 KO and GS mice. The Thra gene is also expressed in the mouse retina 32, but its function remains unknown. The reduced retinal thickness and visual acuity observed in TR\u03b1KO mice, which closely resemble the phenotype of TR\u03b2KO mice, indicate that TR\u03b1 is necessary for normal retinal development\nand that its absence cannot be compensated by TR\u03b2. The coordinated expression and action\nof both TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 during development could be required for the full maturation of the retina.\nAdditionally, noncanonical TR\u03b1 action appears to contribute to retinal vascularization. These\nresults suggest that both TRs are necessary for normal retinal development and visual acuity.\nFurther investigation is needed to determine the timing and cell types of the respective TR\nexpressions."

Latency to first entry into the center was higher in TR\u03b1KO mice (Fig. 3B). Additionally, TR\u03b1KO mice showed a decrease in the total number of entries into the center,\ncenter distance traveled, and time spent in the center, accompanied by an increase in time spent in the periphery (Fig. 3C-F). Interestingly, TR\u03b1GS mice did not differ from their WT\nlittermates in these anxiety-related indicators. Comparable results were obtained for female\nanimals, although not every parameter reached statistical significance due to higher variation\n(Fig. S2).\nPrevious studies have associated loss or impairment of TR\u03b1 signaling with increased anxietyrelated behavior in TR\u03b1KO mice and mice with a dominant-negative, neuron-specific mutation of TR\u03b1 33,34. This behavior has been attributed to a reduced number of GABAergic interneurons and decreased density of GABAergic terminals in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 35. As TR\u03b1GS mice did not display the hypoexploratory and anxiety-related features observed in TR\u03b1KO mice, we hypothesize that central noncanonical TR\u03b1 signaling plays a significant role\nin the regulation of behavior."

However, no significant differences were observed in overall\nappearance, movement, and reflexes in both TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 mutant mice compared to their WT\nlittermates. Furthermore, measurement of grip strength, assessing muscle function, and\nevaluation of motor coordination and balance by Rotarod did not reveal any differences between TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS or TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice and their WT littermates. The lack of a phenotype in muscle function and coordination in TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS mice was\nsurprising as TR\u03b1 is the predominant TR isoform in brain and muscle and hypothyroidism or defective TH transport into brain result in locomotor impairment 36-38. An explanation for the\nabsence of a phenotype could be a TRb-specific effect on locomotor activity. Mice that\nspecifically express a dominant-negative TRb (TRbG345R) in Purkinje cells had impaired\ncerebellar development resulting in significant disrupted motor coordination 39. Expression of\na dominant-negative TRb could also impair any TR\u03b1-mediated effects in these cells, thus this\nresult does not allow determining the relevant TR isoform but rather helps to define the\nunderlying cell-type. Global deletion of TR\u03b11 prevented structural alterations of the Purkinje\ncell layer induced by hypothyroidism and these alterations can only be rescued by T3 and not\nGC-1, a TRb specific agonist 40. This led to the conclusion that the impaired cerebellar\ndevelopment is rather the result of the apo-receptor function of TR\u03b1. This was further confirmed\nwith TR\u03b1R384C mutant mice. The mutation results in a more than 10-fold lower affinity of TR\u03b1 for T3 41 and these mutant mice had locomotor dysfunctions that could be ameliorated by postnatal T3 injection, overcoming the reduced T3 affinity of the mutant receptor 35. Here, both the TR\u03b1KO and the TR\u03b1GS mice do not have any apo-receptor function as either the entire receptor\nis missing or the receptor lacks DNA-binding. Therefore, the absence of a neuromuscular phenotype in TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS mice can be explained by the lack of the apo-receptor function and thus rather reflects the phenotype of the TR\u03b11KO mice 40. This also implies that the role of\nTR\u03b1 is redundant and can be compensated for grip strength and motor coordination, either by\nTR\u03b2 or other regulatory mechanisms."

This weight reduction could primarily be attributed to decrease in fat mass accumulation in TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS mice compared to their WT\nlittermates. Body composition analysis by two NMR measurements at 13 and 18 weeks confirmed that TR\u03b1GS mice had less fat but preserved lean mass (Table 1). In TR\u03b1KO mice both\nfat mass as well as lean mass were reduced, indicating that lean mass maintenance is linked to noncanonical TR\u03b1 action. Interestingly, TR\u03b1GS mice showed slightly but significantly\ndecreased maximum oxygen consumption accompanied by an increased rearing behavior compared to their WT controls. However, in TR\u03b1KO mice food intake and minimum oxygen\nconsumption was increased, resulting in a higher respiratory exchange rate (RER)(Table 1).\nThese findings collectively indicate that TR\u03b1 mutants were in a mild hypermetabolic state, which was more pronounced in TR\u03b1KO mice.\nThese results are generally consistent with previous findings that TR\u03b1 mutant mouse models\nshowed hypermetabolism and defects in adipogenesis, resulting in resistance to obesity and a lean phenotype 41-44. However, there were differences: TR\u03b1KO mice were hyperphagic, but\nTR\u03b1GS mice were not. Furthermore, TR\u03b1KO mice showed a shift towards carbohydrates as fuel\nfor oxidative phosphorylation indicated by increased RER (Table 1). These data suggest that TR\u03b1KO mice are much less efficient than TR\u03b1GS mice in using energy sources, pointing to a\nrole of noncanonical TR\u03b1 signaling in energy metabolism. We have previously reported that TR\u03b2GS mice exhibited increased locomotor activity and metabolic rate (higher minimal and average oxygen consumption) compared to TR\u03b2KO mice,\nwhereas food consumption did not differ between genotypes, which we interpreted as a contribution of noncanonical TRb signaling 13."

After a 6-hour food withdrawal, basal glucose levels were lower in TR\u03b1GS mice\ncompared to their respective controls (Fig. 4B), while no significant differences were observed for TR\u03b1KO mice and their WT litter mates. However, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test\n(IPGTT) showed no differences in glucose tolerance between the mutants and the WT controls\n(Fig. 4C-E).\nIn the TR\u03b2 strains, we found no major differences in basal insulin levels, determined in samples collected by final bleeding from ad libitum fed animals (Fig. 4F). However, both TR\u03b2KO and TR\u03b2GS mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance (lower area under the curve (AUC) glucose\nvalues during the 30-120 min interval, Fig. 4J).\nTH regulates glucose homeostasis through actions in various organs such as pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system 45. One\nexplanation could be that canonical TR\u03b1 action contributes to maintaining insulin concentration\nin the ad libitum fed condition. TH and TR signaling is important for pancreatic b-cell function\nand survival 46,47. Both main TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 isoforms contribute to pancreatic homeostasis, with TR\u03b1 stimulating \u03b2-cell proliferation and formation of insulin-producing cells 48,49, and TR\u03b2 improving survival and insulin secretion 47,50,51. A recent study highlighted the importance of\nTR\u03b1 p43, a truncated isoform, in \u03b2-cell maturation and regulation of postnatal insulin content\n52. Therefore, the loss of canonical TR\u03b1 action by the GS-mutation, which also affects the\ntruncated p43 isoform, may lead to a decreased \u03b2-cell number and subsequently in reduction\nin serum insulin concentrations. However, a decreased \u03b2-cell number is not well compatible\nwith preserved glucose tolerance and unaltered or even lower glucose concentrations during\nfasting in these animals. Therefore, a better explanation would be an increased glucose metabolism due to an increased overall energy demand in TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS mice. TR\u03b1 mutant\nmice, KO as well as GS, have lower body weights, especially fat mass, due to\nhypermetabolism, which supports this hypothesis. Therefore, the lower insulin concentrations\npossibly reflect improved glucose tolerance and leanness. The loss of canonical TR\u03b2 action in both TR\u03b2KO or TR\u03b2GS mice resulted in improved glucose\ntolerance. Both TR\u03b2 mutants are resistant to TH due to impaired negative feedback on the HPT axis, resulting in elevated TH serum concentrations 12,13. Therefore, the improved glucose\ntolerance in both TR\u03b2 mutant mouse lines can probably be attributed to increased TH effects on tissues predominantly expressing TR\u03b1, including adipocytes 53,54, skeletal muscle 55,56 and other cell types like thymocytes 57, by promoting the expression of glucose transporters and\ntheir translocation to the membrane. The pancreatic \u03b2-cells seem not to be affected, as insulin\nconcentrations were not changed in these animals. Of note, acute glucose uptake after T3 treatment requires noncanonical TR\u03b2 signaling 13."

The\nmajority of observed genotype effects were moderate and consistent in both TR\u03b1 mutant lines,\nindicating their mediation through the canonical pathway. For example, in female and male\nTR\u03b1 mutant mice, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and lactate levels were significantly\nincreased (Fig. 5A & B). Leptin levels were decreased in both mutant lines (Fig. 5C). There\nwere a few exceptions to these trends. Specifically, plasma albumin concentration was mildly decreased in TR\u03b1GS mice but unchanged in TR\u03b1KO mice. (Fig. 5D). Creatinine levels were increased in TR\u03b1 mutants, with a more pronounced effect in TR\u03b1GS mice (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, the opposite trend was observed in TR\u03b2GS mice, where creatinine levels were\ndecreased (Fig. 5F). However, no significant effects on other clinical chemistry parameters were observed in TR\u03b2 mutant animals. Iron levels showed only minor changes in TR\u03b1KO mutant\nmice, with no significant alterations in unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC). However, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was noticeably increased in TR\u03b1KO mutant mice (Fig. 5G). In contrast, neither iron levels nor UIBC and TIBC were significantly affected in TR\u03b1GS mice.\nThe results from clinical chemistry parameters in mice with TR mutations provide insights into\nthe physiological effects of the TRs and their signaling. The increase in lactate concentration\nin mice lacking the canonical TR\u03b1 signaling pathway suggests a shift towards anaerobic\nmuscle metabolism. In rats, T3 treatment enhanced glycolysis, influenced mitochondrial uncoupling, and affected mitochondrial substrate utilization in skeletal muscle 59. T3-induced increase in energy expenditure in skeletal muscle required TR\u03b1 in mice 25. The elevated lactate\nconcentrations observed in TR\u03b1 mutant mice may reflect alterations in muscle metabolism and\nenergy utilization, e.g. increased glycolysis.\nThe elevated serum creatinine levels in TR\u03b1 mutants also indicate metabolic changes in skeletal muscle, which experience sudden demands for energy 60. However, it is important to\nnote that the accumulation of plasma creatinine could also be attributed to impaired renal clearance, as thyroid hormone status affects renal function 61,62. The lower concentrations of leptin in the plasma of TR\u03b1KO and TR\u03b1GS mutants can be attributed\nto the reduced white adipose tissue (WAT) mass observed in these animals, as plasma leptin levels are known to correlate with adipose mass 63. However, the relationship between thyroid\nhormone and leptin is complex. Some studies reported elevated leptin levels in hypothyroidism\nand reduced levels in hyperthyroidism, correlating with body mass index (BMI) and thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) levels 64. In contrast, another study found no correlation between leptin levels, BMI, or TSH, but instead correlated leptin with visceral adipose tissue mass 65.\nThus, the specific mechanisms linking TH/TR signaling and leptin regulation require further\ninvestigation. Only TR\u03b1GS mice, male and female, had reduced albumin serum concentrations. While we\ncannot with certainty explain this finding, a smaller liver size may contribute to this effect. Liver\nweight as well as the liver to body weight and the liver to tibia length ratio were significantly decreased in female (P=0.016) and male (P=0.032) TR\u03b1GS mice. Interestingly, no such changes were observed for TR\u03b1KO mice and their albumin concentration was the same as that\nin WT mice.\nRegarding iron metabolism, in cases of iron-deficiency anemia, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is increased. Similarly, TR\u03b1KO mice with mild macrocytic anemia (see below) had an increased TIBC, which suggests a compensatory mechanism 66."

Significant positive linear relationships existed between free TH and hemoglobin, hematocrit and erythrocyte count 69.\nStrikingly, lower T3 concentration was associated with higher MCV and MCH, matching the phenotype in TR\u03b1KO mice.

Interestingly, elevated total numbers of T cells were found in female and male TR\u03b1GS, while the T lymphocyte populations of TR\u03b1KO mice showed no significant alterations (Fig. 6D). The\nincrease in T lymphocytes is predominantly caused by an elevation in CD4+ T cells, the\nmajority of which are expressing CD62L+ CD44-, characterizing them as naive cells (Fig.\n6E,F), F & G). Similarly, a reduction in CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells has been observed\n(Fig. 6G). However, the analysis of these animals has been in unchallenged conditions, and\nalthough it may not necessarily imply a pathological state, it could be crucial in an infection or\nchallenge of the immune system. Despite reduced frequencies of B cell subpopulations in TR\u03b1GS mice, with only percentages changed potentially due to the increase in T cells (Fig. 6H),\nwe found higher concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig), particularly IgA and IgG1, which are\nassociated with gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases or autoimmune conditions (Fig. 6I). The effect of TH on the immune system has already been the subject of previous studies 76-78.\nHowever, the results obtained so far are conflicting, showing both inhibitory and stimulatory\nactions of TH within the same type of immune cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms,\nincluding the contribution of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 signaling, which are expressed in immune cells,\nremain elusive. Regarding T cell immunity, previous studies have demonstrated reduced T cell numbers in TR\u03b1KO mice 79. Conversely, enhanced T cell proliferation and anti-tumor immunity were observed after T4 treatment in a murine lymphoma model 80,81. On the contrary, TH were induced T cell apoptosis upon in vitro stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes 82.\nImportantly, previous studies did not distinguish between different T cell subtypes, such as\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and therefore may have reported conflicting results. Here, we report\na differential action of TH in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, as well as a potential prominent\nrole of noncanonical TR\u03b1 action in CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. In addition to T lymphocytes, previous studies have found reduced frequencies of B cells in peripheral blood of na\u00efve TR\u03b1KO\nmice and a murine model of TR\u03b1 resistance (TR\u03b11PV/+), indicating an essential role of TR\u03b1 for primary B cell development 79,83. Consistent with these findings, our results from TR\u03b1GS mice\nsuggest that canonical TR\u03b1 action is relevant for lymphocyte development. Additionally, it\nshould be noted that the elevated TH serum levels in TR\u03b2 mutant mice may lead to a\ndesensitizing effect on TR\u03b1-mediated signaling, potentially resulting in a phenotype similar to that of TR\u03b1 mutant mice 84,85. The present data suggest a differential role of noncanonical and\ncanonical TR\u03b1 signaling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, while primary B cell development appears\nto rely on canonical TR\u03b1 actions.

However, the specific organ or cell type, as well as the\nbiochemical pathway through which noncanonical TR\u03b1 action influences metabolic efficiency,\nremains to be determined. From these findings, we may conclude that noncanonical TR action\ncontributes to the diverse spectrum of TR effects in physiology.\nMore mechanistic conclusions can be drawn from a comparison of present data with the phenotype of RTH\u03b1 patients that show mild anemia 73. Similarly, TR\u03b1KO mice, but not TR\u03b1GS\nmice, showed mild anemia, indicating that noncanonical TR\u03b1 action sufficed to produce the\nWT phenotype and contribute to normal erythrocyte maturation. We hypothesize that the\npreserved PI3K activation, which is one mode of noncanonical TR\u03b1 action, mediates terminal differentiation of erythroblasts and enucleation 75. Similarly, hepatic TG content is regulated by\nTR\u03b2, increased in T3-resistant TR\u03b2PV mice and RTH\u03b2 patients, but not in mice with preserved noncanonical TR\u03b2 action (TR\u03b2GS) 13,86,87. From these results, we conclude that the dominant\nnegative effect of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 is not restricted to their canonical action and gene expression,\nbut also extends to their noncanonical action. The current concept on noncanonical TR\nactivation of the PI3K pathway assumes that the TRs bind the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85\u03b1, and release it after T3 binding 7,88, which leads to AKT phosphorylation and activation of the\npathway. Impaired T3 binding thus would leave p85\u03b1 bound to the unliganded TR, effectively\ninactivating p85\u03b1.\nIt is tempting to speculate that the phenotype of potential human TR mutations that exclusively\nabrogate canonical signaling would differ from classical RTH with mutation that impair\nhormone binding due to preserved noncanonical TR signaling. Based on the present data, we\nhypothesize that mutations abrogating only DNA-binding of TR\u03b1, a \u2018canonical-only RTH\u03b1\u2019,\nwould not result in anemia and hypermetabolism, and anxiety would be less severe compared\nto classical RTH\u03b1.\nIn general, the mice with absent canonical (GS) or both canonical and noncanonical TR action\n(KO) presented a rather mild phenotype. This may be explained by several mechanisms. For\nexample, absence of one TR isoform could be compensated by the other isoform, which would\nprevent an overt phenotype. Furthermore, the relative lack of effects in TR KO mice does not\nnecessarily indicate that TH/TRs are not involved in regulating key physiological processes.\nRather, it indicates that those processes are redundantly regulated starting at germline\ndevelopment, and absence of TR is compensated by other hormones, receptors, and\npathways. Studies of mice with a dominant negative TR mutant, such as TR\u03b1AMI, TR\u03b1PV or\nTR\u03b2PV mice, would address this and reveal TR involvement. However, dominant-negative\neffects of one isoform could impair effects where TRs play only a minor role and could spill\nover to functions of the other isoform, whereas our approach reveals physiological effects\nwhere TRs are crucially involved. Thus, when studying TR KO and dominant-negative TR\nmutant mice, the possibility of under- and overestimation of TR effects needs to be considered.\nAnother reason for the mild phenotype could be that we studied untreated mice. Some\nphysiologically significant changes or their absence may become apparent only after T3\ntreatment.\nHere, we studied global KO and knock-in (KI) mice. A future challenge is to determine the cell-\ntype where TH/TRs act, possibly in cell-type specific KO and KI mice, both untreated and with\nT3 treatment in comparison. One aspect to consider in interpreting the results here is that they\nmay include effects of altered TR action during development. Overcoming this requires\ninducible TR KO and KI mouse models. Cell type-specific models would also help to distinguish\ndirect from remote TR effects, which occur on peripheral organs after central TH/TR action 43,89,90. Clearly, experiments addressing cell-type specificity, developmental aspects and T3-\ntreatment will be reserved for focused questions that could derive from the present data, e.g.\nstudying erythrocyte maturation or energy metabolism.\nIn summary, the TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 KO and GS comparison demonstrates that canonical and\nnoncanonical actions of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 contribute to various physiological processes, e.g.\nretinal development, anxiety-related behavior, body composition, metabolic efficiency, muscle\nmetabolism, heart rate, hematological parameters, and immune cell populations. These data\nunderscore the importance of both canonical and noncanonical TR signaling pathways in\ndifferent aspects of physiology and the need for more detailed investigations of the precise\nmechanisms for each effect."
