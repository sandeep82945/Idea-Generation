    "abstractText": "The contamination of agricultural products with mycotoxins causes risks to animal and human health and severe economic losses. Mycotoxicoses can be reduced by preventing fungal infection using chemical and biological approaches. The chemical strategies can release toxic molecules; therefore, strategies for biological control are being evaluated, such as using nontoxic fungi and their metabolites. This work evaluated the effect of exoenzymes produced by the beneficial fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum strain T22 in degrading Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and Ochratoxin A (OTA). The ability of Trichoderma to produce hydrolases was stimulated by using different inducing substrates. The highest AFB1 and OTA degradation activity was obtained using a medium containing lyophilized mushrooms and crude fiber. The T. afroharzianum T22\u2019s ability to reduce mycotoxins may be attributed to peroxidase enzymes. This study showed that T. afroharzianum strain T22 or its peroxidase supplementation could represent a sustainable strategy for the degradation of AFB1 and OTA in feed and food products.",

            "text": "Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by plant-parasitic fungi, which can produce acute or chronic diseases in animals and humans [1]. Some of these compounds are lipophilic molecules mainly absorbed in the intestine and distributed in fat and soft tissues [2], with subsequent detoxification and detriment of the kidney and liver [3]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified some mycotoxins (i.e., Aflatoxin B1-AFB1 and Ochratoxin A-OTA) as the most potent natural carcinogens [4]. Mycotoxins contamination can occur in the field or during processing and storage periods. Cereals; fruits; coffee; cocoa; herbal infusions; spices; fodder; products of animal origin; and derivatives (e.g., juices, fermented beverages, milk, and dairy products) are at high risk of contamination, considering their resistance to several processes used in food preparation [5]. The aflatoxins and ochratoxins (especially AFB1 and OTA) are among the most toxic and studied fungal compounds and have a significant economic and biological impact. The consumption of contaminated food and feed induces neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, and carcinogenic effects in humans and animals [6].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3959. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27123959 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nThe fungi Aspergillus parasiticus and A. flavus are the leading producers of AFB1, which affect oilseeds, cereals, spices, milk, tree nuts, and dried fruits. In humans, AFB1 can cause mutagenicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [7]. Different fungal species produce OTA, e.g., A. westerdijkiae, A. steynii, A. niger, A. ochraceus, and Penicillium verrucosum. OTA contaminates maize, rice, wheat, barley, sorghum, oats, wine, coffee, tea, dried fruits, vegetables, spices, milk, and cheese. The presence of OTA in food is associated with hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity, embryotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [8]. The mycotoxin contamination can be reduced by preventing fungal proliferation on the raw material by adopting agricultural practices (i.e., appropriate irrigation and fertilization techniques for crops, pesticides, and resistant cultivars) and optimizing the postharvest transport and storage conditions by physical, chemical, and biological strategies [9,10]. The physical methods include high-pressure cooking, extrusion process, and gamma rays irradiating [11]. The chemical strategies use organic solvents, adsorbent materials (e.g., clays, alumina, silica, zeolites, aluminosilicates, and activated carbons), and essential oils [12,13]. Finally, the biocontrol approaches involve microorganisms (i.e., fungi, bacteria, and yeasts) and enzymes [14,15]. Biocontrol is an eco-friendly strategy, since it does not produce unwanted by-products and toxic residues. Many scientific papers report that fungi (i.e., species of Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Penicillium) are active in reducing mycotoxins contamination [9]. Among these, the fungi of the genus Trichoderma are attractive for their extensive use in agriculture [16,17]. They are free-living, filamentous fungi, mostly soil-resident, including rhizosphere-competent strains [18]. Trichoderma fungi suppress foliar and soil-borne plant pathogens; enhance plant resistance to diseases and abiotic stresses; and promote mineral nutrition, plant growth, and crop productivity [19,20]. These beneficial fungi are competitors in the soil environment to pathogen species and synthesize secondary metabolites to decrease plant pathogens [21] by an interference competition [22]. Moreover, Trichoderma fungi can produce peroxidases, glucanases, chitinases, and cellulases, enzymes active against phytopathogens [23,24] used in the postharvest disease management of papaya, apple, tomato, pear, mango, banana, potato, and berries [25\u201337]. In this work, we evaluated the ability of Trichoderma afroharzianum strain T22 to synthesize peroxidases using different substrates. Then, we tested the effect of the exoenzymes on the degradation of mycotoxins AFB1 and OTA in different doses and at different incubation times."

            "text": "Mycotoxins are natural compounds produced by filamentous fungi, which, under suitable temperature and humidity conditions, may develop on various foods and feeds, causing severe risks to human and animal health [38]. Some works have been performed to safeguard foodstuffs from the contamination of mycotoxins and detoxify contaminated products [39]. Biological detoxification, or the enzymatic degradation of mycotoxins by microorganisms, represents an attractive approach to conventional mycotoxin inactivation. For example, Trichoderma fungi can synthesize several enzymes, such as peroxidase, chitinase, \u03b2-1, 3-glucanase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, to overcome environmental stresses [40\u201342]. Previous works have shown the involvement of peroxidases in mycotoxin (especially OTA and AFB1) degradation and decontamination [43\u201345] as they are capable of oxidizing aflatoxins into polar and less toxic molecules [46]. The fungal strain and growing condition (i.e., media) affect the Trichoderma\u2019s ability to produce peroxidases [47]. In this work, the ability of T. afroharzianum T22 to release peroxidases was evaluated on different substrates at two different times (7 and 14 days). The best performance was obtained using a medium containing lyophilized mushrooms and crude fiber (enzymatic units = 0.075) after 14 days (Figure 1). Therefore, this substrate was used to test Trichoderma\u2019s ability to induce mycotoxin degradation."

Figure 2 reports the kinetics degradation of OTA (at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L) following treatment with Trichoderma enzyme mixtures. After 8 days, the concentration of OTA decreased in a different and nonproportional way from the initial mycotoxin concentration. The best degradation of OTA was achieved at 0.01 mg/L with a degradation rate of 46% (Figure 2B), followed by 37% when OTA was 0.001 mg/L (Figure 2A) and 31% when OTA was 0.1 mg/L (Figure 2C). Figure 3A\u2013C reports the kinetics degradation of AFB1. After 8 days of incubation, the degradation rate was 100% at 0.001 mg/L, 63% at 0.01 mg/L, and 28% at 0.1 mg/L. Thus, the degradation of AFB1 after treatment with the T22 culture filtrate was inversely proportional to the mycotoxin concentration. The reduction of both mycotoxins confirmed the involvement of fungal enzymes in the mycotoxin degradation (Figures 2 and 3). In both cases, the optimum reduction time was 8 days. The different decontamination yields depending on the dose of mycotoxin treated suggested a relationship between the levels of decontaminating agent and toxin. Different mechanisms could explain the slightly different behaviors of the two enzymatic kinetics. The T22 culture filtrate decontamination inversely proportional to the mycotoxin concentration could depend on the direct action of peroxidases on AFB1, which generates lower toxicity products (i.e., Aflatoxins P1, M1, B2a, Q1, and aflatoxicol) by opening the difurocoumarin moiety of Aflatoxin B1 and hydrolyzing the vinylene group [52]. The changes in the lactone and furan rings negatively affect the AFB1 toxicity, since the unsaturated 8,9-bond in the furofuran ring and the lactone ring are interested in the AFB1\u2013DNA and AFB1\u2013protein interactions [50,51]. The severity\u2019s order of toxicity (acute to chronic: AFB1 > AFB2 > AFM1) is ascribable to the chirality, steric hindrances, and resonance energy [53]. It has not fully elucidated the peroxidase action on ochratoxin A. It is known that the OTA contamination determines ROSs production, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and the loss of cell function [54]. ROSs production is due to the inhibition of antioxidative enzymes. Lipid peroxidation determines an increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) level [54]. On the contrary, Trichoderma spp. releases antioxidant enzymes and decreases the MDA content [54]. Therefore, at the same concentration of Trichoderma culture filtrates and different OTA levels, the peroxidase level decreases as the OTA concentration increases. Moreover, the maximum degradation levels of OTA occurred at 0.01 mg/L and could\ndepend on the release of H2O2 in the reaction mixture. H2O2 is the peroxidase cosubstrate, which can create an intermediate molecule that transforms a phenolic substrate into a free radical [54]. It is known that the peroxidases reveal a kinetic performance of inactivation, both in the excess or absence of H2O2 [55]. Noteworthy, the prolongation of detoxification for one week at 37 \u25e6C suggests that these enzymes are stable at this time and temperature."

They are easier to dose and store than producing fungi while retaining the ability to make nontoxic or less toxic products than chemical approaches. HPLC gel filtration chromatography and SDS-page electrophoresis were used to isolate the enzyme responsible for the mycotoxin degradation. The HPLC chromatogram of T. afroharzianum strain T22 culture filtrates (Figure 5) showed ten main peaks. Standard solutions of AFB1 were added to each isolated fraction to test the degrading activity. Fraction number 3 (peak at Rt 12.8 min\u2014Figure 5) showed the best activity, with a degradation rate of 100% at 0.001 mg/L, 52% at 0.01 mg/L, and 51.63% at 0.1 mg/L (data not shown). SDS page electrophoresis showed three prominent bands that were isolated and used to determine which was responsible for the AFB1 reduction. Fraction 2 gave the maximum degradation percentage of AFB1. Thus, it was possible to assume that one or more Trichoderma enzymes with a molecular weight range of 60\u201390 kDa were involved in the degradation of this mycotoxin.\n1\u00a0 \u00a0"

The\nchromatographic course was conducted under isocratic conditions (1 mL/min flow) using water as a mobile phase.\n3.6.2. Electrophoresis\nThe fractions were concentrated to obtain a final volume of 1 mL. The samples (4 \u00b5L) were diluted in the running buffer (5 \u00b5L of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and a 95-\u00b5L Laemmli sample buffer) (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology) and separated by vertical electrophoresis under tricine denaturing conditions -SDS-PAGE (PHAST GEL\u00ae electrophoresis system, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology).

The running buffers were made with 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M tricine, and 0.1% SDS pH 8.5 at the cathode and 0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.9 at the anode. The time course was 30 min, the power 80 volts. The gel at the end of the electrophoretic course was colored with silver nitrate according to the procedure described by Blum et al. [36]. The gel was fixed (10 min) in a solution containing 50% ethanol and 10% acetic acid (v/v) to remove the electrophoresis buffer and the urea. Then, it was washed (three minutes) with deionized water, incubated (1 min) in a solution consisting of 0.02 g/100 mL of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, and washed with deionized water (3 times for 30 s). After fixing, the gel was placed (20 min) in a staining solution (containing 0.1 g/50 mL of silver nitrate + 38 \u00b5L of 37% formaldehyde). Subsequently, it was rinsed in deionized water (twice for 20 s) to remove the silver in excess and developed in an alkaline solution containing sodium carbonate (0.3 g/50 mL) + 37% formaldehyde (25 \u00b5L) + 1 mL Na2S2O3\u00b75H2O (0.02 g solution/100 mL).

            "text": "Contamination of agricultural products with mycotoxins is dangerous for animal and human health. The risk of mycotoxicosis can be reduced by using beneficial microorganisms and their enzymes. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of Trichoderma spp. as a biocontrol agent, but only a few studies have been concerned about its ability to degrade mycotoxins. For the first time, our results demonstrated the ability of Trichoderma afroharzianum T22 to degrade AFB1 and OTA using an inducing media to release exohydrolases with peroxidase activity. High levels of degradation have been demonstrated both in vitro (up to 100% of degradation at a low concentration of AFB1) and in contaminated maize flour (30% of degradation of AFB1). The results obtained in this study showed that T22 or Trichoderma peroxidase supplementation could represent sustainable strategies for the degradation of AFB1 and OTA. The characterization of Trichoderma peroxidases, the adverse effects of enzyme preparations on food/feed, and the toxicity of the degradation products of the selected mycotoxins are underway in our laboratory.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/molecules27123959/s1: Figure S1: Aflatoxin B1 calibration line and Figure S2: Ochratoxin A calibration line.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.D., R.M., N.L. and F.V.; data curation, V.A., S.L.W. and S.L.; formal analysis, V.A., A.B. and R.M.; investigation, V.A. and A.B.; and project administration, F.V., S.L.W. and A.R.
