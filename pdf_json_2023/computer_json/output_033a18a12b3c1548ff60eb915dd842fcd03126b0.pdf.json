    "abstractText": "In a number of problems in applied mathematics, physics (theoretical and mathematical), statistics, and other fields the hypergeometric functions of one and several variables naturally appear. Hypergeometric functions in one and several variables have several known applications today. The Appell\u2019s four functions and the Horn\u2019s functions have shown to be particularly useful in providing solutions to a variety of problems in both pure and applied mathematics. The Hubbell rectangular source and its generalization, non-relativistic theory, and the hydrogen dipole matrix elements are only a few examples of the numerous scientific and chemical domains where Appell functions are used. The Appell series is also used in quantum field theory, especially in the evaluation of Feynman integrals. Additionally, since 1985, computational sciences such as artificial intelligence (AI) and information processing (IP) have used the well-known Horn functions as a key idea. In literature, there have been published a significant number of results of double series in particular of Appell and Horn functions in a series of interesting and useful research publications. We find three general transformation formulas between Appell functions F2 and F4 and two general transformation formulas between Appell function F2 and Horn function H4 in the present study, which are mostly inspired by their work and naturally exhibit symmetry. By using the generalizations of the Kummer second theorem in the integral representation of the Appell function F2, this is accomplished. As special cases of our main findings, both previously known and new results have been found.",

Introduction\nWe begin by recalling the definition of the well-known and useful Pochhammer symbol (or the shifted factorial) (a)n defined for every complex number a( 6= 0) by\n(a)n = { a(a + 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (a + n\u2212 1) ; n \u2208 N, 1 ; n = 0.\n(1)\nIn terms of the well-known gamma function, this can be written as\n(a)n = \u0393(a + n)\n\u0393(a) .\nIn the Gauss\u2019s hypergeometric function\n2F1\n[ a, b c ; z ] ,\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 696. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15030696 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nthere are two numerator parameters a and b and one denominator parameter c; z is called the variable of the function. A natural generalization of this function is accomplished by increasing any number of numerator and denominator parameters as follows:\npFq [ a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ap b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bq ; z ] = \u221e \u2211 n=0 (a1)n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ( ap ) n (b1)n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ( bq ) n zn n! , (2)\nin which (a)n is the well-known Pochhammer symbol, already defined in (1). The function defined in (2) is called generalized hypergeometric function. Here p and q are nonnegative integers. It is also assumed that the variable z, the numerator parameters a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ap and the denumerator parameters b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bq can take on real or complex values with an exception that the denumerator parameters b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bq should not be zero or a negative integer. By ratio test, it can be easily see that the series pFq (i) Converges for all |z| < \u221e if p \u2264 q; (ii) Converges for all |z| < 1 if p = q + 1; (iii) Diverges for all z, z 6= 0 if p > q + 1.\nMoreover, if we set\n\u03b4 = q\n\u2211 j=1\nbj \u2212 p\n\u2211 i=1 ai,\nthen the series pFq with p = q + 1 is\n(i) Absolutely convergent for |z| = 1, if Re(\u03b4) > 0; (ii) Conditionally convergent for |z| = 1, z 6= 1 if \u22121 < Re(\u03b4) \u2264 0; (iii) Divergent for |z| = 1 if Re(\u03b4) \u2264 \u22121 .\nIt is interesting to note that the generalized hypergeometric function (2) has symmetry in both the numerator parameters a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ap and the denominator parameters b1, b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bq. This means that every arrangement of the generalized hypergeometric function\u2019s numerator parameters a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ap produces the same function, and every arrangement of the denominator parameters b1, b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bq generates the same function. For a detailed account of hypergeometric function 2F1 and generalized hypergeometric function pFq, the reader may consult the book by Andrews et al. [1], Bailey [2], Rainville [3], and Slater [4]. The vast popularity and immense usefulness of the hypergeometric function 2F1 and the generalized hypergeometric function pFq in one variable have inspired and stimulated a large number of mathematicians and researchers to study hypergeometric functions in two or more variables. In this regard, serious and very significant study of the functions of two variables initiated by Appell [5], who introduced the so-called four functions F1, F2, F3, and F4 named in the literature, the Appell functions in two variables which are the natural generalizations of the hypergeometric function 2F1. It is interesting to mention here that Appell established the set of partial differential equations of which the above mentioned four functions are solutions. In addition to this, Appell found various very interesting reduction formulas together with expressions of these functions in terms of the hypergeometric function 2F1. Moreover, in our present investigations, we are interested in the following two Appell functions [5] viz.\nF2[\u03b1, \u00b51, \u00b52; \u03bd1, \u03bd2; x1, x2] = \u221e\n\u2211 m=0\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0 (\u03b1)m+n(\u00b51)m(\u00b52)n (\u03bd1)m(\u03bd2)n m! n! xm1 x n 2 , (3)\nprovided |x1|+ |x2| < 1,\nF4[\u03b1, \u03b2; \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ; x, y] =\n\u221e\n\u2211 m=0\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0 (\u03b1)m+n(\u03b2)m+n (\u03b3)m(\u03b3 \u2032)n m! n! xmyn, (4)\nprovided \u221a |x|+ \u221a |y| < 1.\nFurthermore, the following integral representation for the Appell function F2 viz.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; \u03bd1, \u03bd2; x1, x2]\n= 1\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t t\u03bb\u221211F1 [ \u00b51 \u03bd1 ; x1t ] 1F1 [ \u00b52 \u03bd2 ; x2t ] dt, (5)\nprovided Re(\u03bb) > 0 and Re(x1 + x2) < 1. It should be noted that two most significant functions described in the paper, the generalized hypergeometric function pFq and the two Appell\u2019s functions F2 and F4 involving two variables, naturally exhibit symmetry. Moreover, in the theory of special functions in mathematics, there are the 34 distinct convergent hypergeometric functions in two independent variables enumerated by Horn [6] (including the above mentioned four Appell functions). The total 34 Horn functions can be further categorized into 14 complete hypergeometric functions and 20 confluent hypergeometric functions. For details, we refer Erd\u00e9lyi [7]. However, here we would like to mention Horn H4 function which is defined as follows [6]:\nH4[\u03b1, \u03b2; \u03b3, \u03b4; x, y] = \u221e\n\u2211 m=0\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0 (\u03b1)2m+n(\u03b2)n (\u03b3)m(\u03b4)n m! n! xmyn, (6)\nprovided |x| < \u03b3 and |y| < \u03b4 with 4\u03b3 = (\u03b4\u2212 1)2. It is not out of place to mention here that the symmetry occurs in the numerator parameters \u00b51 and \u00b52 and also symmetry occurs in the denominator parameters \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 of the Appell functions F2 while the symmetry occurs in the denominator parameters \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 of the Appell function F4 and the denominator parameters \u03b3 and \u03b4 of the Horn function H4.\n2. Preliminaries\nWe start with the following interesting transformation formula between Appell functions F2 and F4 was given by Bailey [8] viz.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5, 2\u03bd; 2x1, x2] (7) = (1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\u2212\u03bb F4 [\n1 2 \u03bb, 1 2 (\u03bb + 1); \u00b5 + 1 2 , \u03bd + 1 2\n; (\nx1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2] .\nSimilarly, the following interesting transformation formula between Appell function F2 and Horn function H4 is given by Erd\u00e9lyi [7] viz.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb H4 [\n\u03bb, \u00b52; \u00b51 + 1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x2\n)] . (8)\nFor a detailed account of hypergeometric functions in two and more variables, the reader may consult the book by Srivastava and Karlsson [9]. We remark in passing that the results (7) and (8) can be established by employing the following Kummer\u2019s second theorem [3] viz.\ne\u2212 1 2 x1F1\n[ \u03bb 2\u03bb ; x ] = 0F1 [ \u2212\n\u03bb + 12 ;\nx2\n16\n] . (9)\nIn 1995, Rathie and Nagar [10] established the following two results closely related to the Kummer\u2019s second theorem (9) viz.\ne\u2212 1 2 t 1F1\n[ \u03bb 2\u03bb + 1 ; t ] = 0F1 [ \u2212\n\u03bb + 12 ;\nt2\n16\n] \u2212 t\n2(2\u03bb + 1) 0 F1\n[ \u2212\n\u03bb + 32 ;\nt2\n16\n] , (10)\nand\ne\u2212 1 2 t 1F1\n[ \u03bb 2\u03bb\u2212 1 ; t ] = 0F1 [ \u2212\n\u03bb\u2212 12 ;\nt2\n16\n] +\nt 2(2\u03bb\u2212 1) 0F1\n[ \u2212\n\u03bb + 12 ;\nt2\n16\n] , (11)\nby employing two results closely related to Gauss\u2019s second summation theorem. These results are also recorded in [11]. In 2019, Mathur and Solanki [12,13], by employing the results (9), (10), and (11) in the integral representation (5) of F2, established certain transformation formulas between F2, F4 and H4 out of which some were corrected very recently by Mohammed et al. [14] in the following form:\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + 1, 2\u03bd + 1; 2x1, x2] = (1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\u2212\u03bb { F4 [ 1 2 \u03bb, 1 2 (\u03bb + 1); \u00b5 + 1 2 , \u03bd + 1 2 ; ( x1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2 , ( x2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] \u2212 \u03bbx1\n(2\u00b5 + 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2) F4 [ 1 2 (\u03bb + 1), 1 2 \u03bb + 1; \u00b5 + 3 2 , \u03bd + 1 2 ; ( x1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2 , ( x2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] \u2212 \u03bbx2\n(2\u03bd + 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2) F4 [ 1 2 (\u03bb + 1), 1 2 \u03bb + 1; \u00b5 + 1 2 , \u03bd + 3 2 ; ( x1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2 , ( x2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] +\n\u03bb(\u03bb + 1)x1x2 (2\u00b5 + 1)(2\u03bd + 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)2\n\u00d7 F4 [\n1 2 \u03bb + 1, 1 2 \u03bb + 3 2 ; \u00b5 + 3 2 , \u03bd + 3 2\n; (\nx1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2]} , (12)\nprovided Re(\u03bb) > 0 and Re(x1 + x2) < 12 .\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5\u2212 1, 2\u03bd\u2212 1; 2x1, x2] = (1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\u2212\u03bb\n\u00d7 {\nF4 [ 1 2 \u03bb, 1 2 (\u03bb + 1); \u00b5\u2212 1 2 , \u03bd\u2212 1 2 ; ( x1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2 , ( x2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] +\n\u03bbx1 (2\u00b5\u2212 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\n\u00d7 F4 [\n1 2 (\u03bb + 1), 1 2 \u03bb + 1; \u00b5 + 1 2 , \u03bd\u2212 1 2\n; (\nx1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] +\n\u03bbx2 (2\u03bd\u2212 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\n\u00d7 F4 [\n1 2 (\u03bb + 1), 1 2 \u03bb + 1; \u00b5\u2212 1 2 , \u03bd + 1 2\n; (\nx1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )2] +\n\u03bb(\u03bb + 1)x1x2 (2\u00b5\u2212 1)(2\u03bd\u2212 1)(1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)2\n\u00d7 F4 [\n1 2 \u03bb + 1, 1 2 \u03bb + 3 2 ; \u00b5 + 1 2 , \u03bd + 1 2\n; (\nx1 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\n)2]} , (13)\nprovided Re(\u03bb) > 0 and Re(x1 + x2) < 12 .\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + 1, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb { H4 [ \u03bb, \u00b52; \u00b51 +\n1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1 )] \u2212 2\u03bbx1\n(2\u00b51 + 1)(1\u2212 2x1) H4\n[ \u03bb + 1, \u00b52; \u00b51 +\n3 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1\n)]} , (14)\nprovided Re(\u03bb) > 0 and Re(4x1 + x2) < 1, and\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 \u2212 1, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb { H4 [ \u03bb, \u00b52, \u00b51 \u2212\n1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1 )] +\n2\u03bbx1 (2\u00b51 \u2212 1)(1\u2212 2x1) H4\n[ \u03bb + 1, \u00b52; \u00b51 +\n1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1\n)]} , (15)\nprovided Re(\u03bb) > 0 and Re(4x1 + x2) < 1. We remark in passing that the results (12) and (13) are closely related to the result (7) from Bailey while the results (14) and (15) are closely related to the result (8) from Erd\u00e9lyi. In order to establish our general results, we shall need the following two results recorded in [15] written here in a slightly different form, valid for i \u2208 N0 viz.\n1F1\n[ \u03b1\n2\u03b1 + i ; 2x ] = ex i\n\u2211 k=0\n(\u2212i)k(2\u03b1\u2212 1)k xk\n(2\u03b1 + i)k(\u03b1\u2212 12 )k 2k k! 0F1\n[ \u2212\n\u03b1 + 12 + k ;\nx2\n4\n] , (16)\nand\n1F1\n[ \u03b1 2\u03b1\u2212 i ; 2x ]\n= ex i\n\u2211 k=0\n(\u22121)k(\u2212i)k(2\u03b1\u2212 2i\u2212 1)k xk\n(2\u03b1\u2212 i)k(\u03b1\u2212 12 \u2212 i)k 2k k! 0F1\n[ \u2212\n\u03b1 + k\u2212 i + 12 ;\nx2\n4\n] . (17)\nAppell functions have numerous uses in several physical and chemical domains. In this follow-up, we refer to [16] for application in radiation field problems, [17] for application in Hubbell rectangular sources and its generalization, [18] for application in non-relativistic theory and [19] for application in the hydrogen dipole matrix element. Additionally, it can be shown in the interesting works [20,21], the Appell series is used in quantum field theory, specifically in the evaluation of Feynman integrals. In the computational sciences, including artificial intelligence (AI) and information processing (IP), the well-known Horn functions have also been used since 1985 as a fundamental idea. The papers [22\u201324] provide more information. In recent years, in a series of research papers, Brychkov and Saad [25\u201327], Brychkov [28,29], Brychkov et al. [30], and Brychkov and Savischenko [31\u201337] have established a large number of results on Appell and Horn functions. Inspired mainly by their work, in this paper, our main objective is to generalize Bailey\u2019s result (7) and Erd\u00e9lyi\u2019s result (8) in the most general form. For this, the rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 3, we shall establish three general transformation formulas between Appell functions F2 and F4 while in Section 3, two general transformation formulas between Appell function F2 and Horn function H4. The results obtained earlier by Mohammed et al. [14] (which are corrected forms of the results from Mathur and Solanki)\nfollow special cases of our main findings. A few new interesting special cases have also been mentioned.\n3. Transformation Formulas between Appell Functions F2 and F4 In this section, we shall establish three general transformation formulas between Appell functions F2 and F4 asserted in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. For Re(\u03bb) > 0, Re(x1 + x2) < 12 and i, j \u2208 N0, the following transformation formulas hold true.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + i, 2\u03bd + j; 2x1, 2x2] = (1\u2212 x1 \u2212 x2)\u2212\u03bb\n\u00d7 i\n\u2211 k1=0\nj\n\u2211 k2=0\n(\u2212i)k1 (\u2212j)k2 (2\u00b5\u2212 1)k1 (2\u03bd\u2212 1)k2 (\u03bb)k1+k2 x k1 1 x k2 2\n(2\u00b5 + i)k1 (2\u03bd + j)k2 2 k1+k2 (k1)!

(20)\nProof. In order to establish our first result (18) asserted in the Theorem 1, we proceed as follows. For this in the integral representation (5) of F2, if we set \u00b51 = \u00b5, \u03bd1 = 2\u00b5 + i, \u00b52 = \u03bd, \u03bd2 = 2\u03bd + j and replacing x1 and x2 by 2x1 and 2x2 , respectively, then for i, j \u2208 N0, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + i, 2\u03bd + j; 2x1, 2x2]\n= 1\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t t\u03bb\u22121 1F1 [ \u00b5 2\u00b5 + i ; 2x1t ] 1F1 [ \u03bd 2\u03bd + j ; 2x2t ] dt.\nUsing the result (16) in both 1F1 functions, we have after some simplification\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + i, 2\u03bd + j; 2x1, 2x2] = 1\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t t\u03bb\u22121\n\u00d7 { ex1t i\n\u2211 k1=0\nC1(k1) x k1 1 t k1 0F1\n[ \u2212\n\u00b5 + 12 + k1 ;\nx21 t 2\n4\n]\n\u00b7 ex2t j\n\u2211 k2=0\nC2(k2) x k2 2 t k2 0F1\n[ \u2212\n\u03bd + 12 + k2 ;\nx22 t 2\n4\n]} dt,\nwhere\nC1(k1) = (\u2212i)k1(2\u00b5\u2212 1)k1\n(2\u00b5 + i)k1(\u00b5\u2212 1 2 )k1 2 k1(k1)! ,\nand\nC2(k2) = (\u2212j)k2(2\u03bd\u2212 1)k2\n(2\u03bd + j)k2(\u03bd\u2212 1 2 )k2 2 k2(k2)! .\nNow, changing the order of integration and summation, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + i, 2\u03bd + j; 2x1, x2]\n= i\n\u2211 k1=0\nj\n\u2211 k2=0\nC1(k1)C2(k2) x k1 1 x k2 2 1 \u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t(1\u2212x1\u2212x2) t\u03bb+k1+k2\u22121\n\u00d7 0F1 [\n\u2212 \u00b5 + 12 + k1 ; x21 t 2 4\n] 0F1 [ \u2212\n\u03bd + 12 + k2 ;\nx22 t 2\n4\n] dt.\nNext, expressing both 0F1 functions as series, change the order of integration and summation, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b5, \u03bd; 2\u00b5 + i, 2\u03bd + j; 2x1, x2]\n= i\n\u2211 k1=0\nj\n\u2211 k2=0\nC1(k1)C2(k2) x k1 1 x k2 2\n\u00d7 { \u221e\n\u2211 m=0\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0\nx2m1 x 2n 2\n(\u00b5 + 12 + k1)m(\u03bd + 1 2 + k2)n 2 2m+2n m! n!\n\u00d7 1 \u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212(1\u2212x1\u2212x2)t t\u03bb+k1+k2+2m+2n\u22121dt } .\nEvaluating the Gamma integral and noting that\n\u0393(\u03bb + k1 + k2 + 2m + 2n) \u0393(\u03bb)\n= 22m+2n (\n1 2 (\u03bb + k1 + k2) ) m+n ( 1 2 (\u03bb + k1 + k2 + 1) ) m+n (\u03bb)k1+k2 ,\nand summing up the series, we after some simplification, easily arrive at the right-hand side of (18).

Transformation Formulas between Appell Functions F2 and Horn Function H4 In this section, we shall establish two general transformation formulas between Appell function F2 and Horn function H4 asserted in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. For Re(\u03bb) > 0, Re(4x1 + x2) < 1 and i \u2208 N0, the following transformation formulas hold true.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2]\n= (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb i\n\u2211 k=0 (\u2212i)k (2\u00b51 \u2212 1)k (\u03bb)k xk1 (2\u00b51 + i)k(\u00b51 \u2212 12 )k (1\u2212 2x1)k k!\n\u00d7 H4 [\n\u03bb + k, \u00b52; \u00b51 + k + 1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1\n)] , (21)\nand\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 \u2212 i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2]\n= (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb i\n\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)k(\u2212i)k (2\u00b51 \u2212 2i\u2212 1)k (\u03bb)k xk1 (2\u00b51 \u2212 i)k (\u00b51 \u2212 i\u2212 12 )k (1\u2212 2x1)k k!\n\u00d7 H4 [\n\u03bb + k, \u00b52; \u00b51 \u2212 i + 1 2 + k, \u03bd;\n( x1\n1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1\n)] . (22)\nProof. In order to establish first result (21) asserted in the Theorem 2, we proceed as follows. For this, in the integral representation (5) of F2, if we set \u03bd1 = 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd2 = \u03bd and replacing x1 by 4x1, then for i \u2208 N0, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2]\n= 1\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t t\u03bb\u22121 1F1 [ \u00b51 2\u00b51 + i ; x1 t ] 1F1 [ \u00b52 \u03bd ; x2 t ] dt.\nUsing the result (16) in the first 1F1 function, we have after some simplification\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2]\n= 1\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212t t\u03bb\u22121 { e2x1t i \u2211 k=0 C(k) xk1 t k 0F1 [ \u2212 \u00b51 + k + 12 ; x21 t 2 ]}\n\u00d7 1F1 [\n\u00b52 \u03bd\n; x2 t ] dt,\nwhere\nC(k) = (\u2212i)k (2\u00b51 \u2212 1)k\n(2\u00b51 + i)k (\u00b51 \u2212 12 )k (k)! .\nNow, changing the order of integration and summation, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = i\n\u2211 k=0 C(k) xk1\n\u00d7 1 \u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212(1\u22122x1)t t\u03bb+k\u22121 0F1 [ \u2212 \u00b51 + k + 12 ; x21 t 2 ] 1F1 [ \u00b52 \u03bd ; x2 t ] dt.\nNext, expressing both 0F1 and 1F1 generalized hypergeometric function as series, changing the order of integration and summation, we have\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + i, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = i\n\u2211 k=0 C(k) xk1\n\u00d7 { \u221e\n\u2211 m=0\n\u221e\n\u2211 n=0\nx2m1 x 2n 2 (\u00b52)n\n(\u00b51 + k + 12 )m (\u03bd)n m! n! 1 \u0393(\u03bb) \u222b \u221e 0 e\u2212(1\u22122x1)t t\u03bb+k+2m+n\u22121dt } .\nEvaluating the Gamma integral and noting that\n\u0393(\u03bb + k + 2m + n) \u0393(\u03bb) = (\u03bb + k)2m+n (\u03bb)k,\nand summing up the series, we after some simplification, easily arrive at the right-hand side of (21). This completes the proof of the first result (21) asserted in the Theorem 2. In exactly the same manner the result (22) can be established.\nCorollaries\nIn this subsection, we shall mention some known as well as new special cases of the results (21) and (22) asserted in the Theorem 2.\nRemark 4. In (21) or (22), if we take i = 0, the result (8) follows in view of the work conducted by Erd\u00e9lyi [7], (Eq. (4.7), p. 239).\nRemark 5. In (21), if we take i = 1, we obtain a known result from Mathur and Solanki in the corrected form (14) given very recently by Mohammed et al.\nCorollary 4. In (21), if we take i = 2, we obtain the following interesting contiguous result.\nF2[\u03bb, \u00b51, \u00b52; 2\u00b51 + 2, \u03bd; 4x1, x2] = (1\u2212 2x1)\u2212\u03bb { H4 [ \u03bb, \u00b52; \u00b51 +\n1 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1 )2] \u2212 2\u03bb x1\n(\u00b51 + 1) (1\u2212 2x1) H4\n[ \u03bb + 1, \u00b52; \u00b51 +\n3 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1 )2] +\n4\u03bb (\u03bb + 1) x21 (\u00b51 + 1) (2\u00b51 + 1) (2\u00b51 + 3) (1\u2212 2x1)2\n\u00d7 H4 [\n\u03bb + 1, \u00b52; \u00b51 + 5 2\n, \u03bd; (\nx1 1\u2212 2x1\n)2 , (\nx2 1\u2212 2x1\n)2]} .\nRemark 6.

Conclusions\nIn this study, three general transformation formulas between Appell functions F2 and F4 and two general transformation formulas between Appell function F2 and Horn function H4 have been established. To achieve this, in the integral formulation of the Appell function F2, generalizations of the Kummer second theorem are used. As special cases of our major discoveries, both previously known and new results have been found. The findings in this work are thought to be novel to the literature and provide a significant advance to the understanding of generalized hypergeometric functions of one and two variables. It is believed that the findings in this work may have possible applications in a variety of physical and chemical domains, such as Hubbell\u2019s radiation field problems, Hubbell rectangular source and its generalization, non-relativistic theory, and hydrogen dipole matrix element. The Appell series is also used in quantum field theory, namely for the evaluation of Feynman integrals. Furthermore, since 1985, computational sciences such as artificial intelligence (AI) and information processing (IP) have used the well-known Horn functions as a key notion. A forthcoming paper in this area will explore the applications of the findings from this work as well as the geometrical interpretation of the general transformation formulas for the Appell and Horn functions.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft, I.K. and A.K.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.K. and A.K.R.
