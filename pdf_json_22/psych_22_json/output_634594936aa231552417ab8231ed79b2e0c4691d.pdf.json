    "abstractText": "Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has been studied to comprehend human motivation, particularly in education. Numerous studies have been conducted at universities regarding online learning as a technology to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. On the basis of these expansions, however, there is a knowledge gap regarding what constitutes advancement, future direction, and research gaps regarding SDT in university online learning. This new systematic literature review analyzed 49 articles using PRISMA to bridge the knowledge gap. Currently, SDT research in online learning at university does not extensively integrate other theories and models, but there is a trend toward acceptance models and cognitive theories. Future research should incorporate additional SDT factors such as intrinsic motivation, external regulation, identified regulation, and amotivation in addition to autonomy, competence, and relatedness. As most research samples students, a research gap involving lecturers and mixed groups is suggested. The future is anticipated to be dominated by quantitative research, leaving qualitative and mixed methods as points of exploration. This review sheds light on the advancements, future direction, and research gaps regarding SDT in universitylevel online learning. It could serve as a basis for future research in SDT within the context of online education.",

            "text": "Human life is influenced by internal factors, external factors, and the surrounding environment. Every one of these is influenced by motivation. Numerous theories and models were able to explain motivation. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is one of them and has become one of the most popular. According to Deci, Connell, and Ryan [1], selfdetermination is the capacity to initiate and control one\u2019s own actions. SDT includes the basic psychological need of autonomy, competence, and relatedness [2]. Later, as SDT continued to develop, the theory grew to include intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation. Researchers such as Rosli and Saleh [3] refer to this as the full spectrum of SDT. Extrinsic motivation includes four types of regulations: external regulation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, and integrated regulation [4]. SDT is a universally recognized motivational theory. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the theory has become more crucial for comprehending human psychology. Based on the initial search carried out by the authors, in 2020, there were 926 articles published in Scopus that utilised SDT as one of their fundamental theoretical frameworks, whereas in 2019 there were only 814 articles. The number of articles increased to 1073 and 1002 in 2021 and early August 2022, respectively. Compared to SDT-related articles published between 2014 and 2019, a significant increase is noticeable.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142114655 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655 2 of 21\nIn addition to its applications in the transportation [5] and tourism industries [6], SDT is also widely utilised in the education sector [7\u20139]. The application of SDT in the educational sector takes place in primary schools [10], secondary schools [11], and universities [7,12,13]. Clearly, SDT research was conducted with greater intensity in universities. The research conducted within the context of the university included studies on online learning and its variants [14\u201318]. As the development of SDT in online learning has matured, it is the ideal time to present the academic community with a systematic literature review that reveals and illustrates the development, future direction, and current research and knowledge gaps on this topic. Despite the increased intensity of online learning as a result of the pandemic, such a systematic literature review has never been conducted as far as we are aware. The information synthesised by this new systematic literature review would enable future researchers to comprehend the SDT not only within the scope of online learning, but also beyond the context of educational approaches, such as the online working ecosystem, given that universities are the primary source of digitally savvy labour for the economy. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of advancement, future direction, and gaps, it is suggested to establish research paradigms [19]. Due to the increased interest in SDT, the researchers are unable to determine which other theories should be integrated into their research model. Expanding SDT with other suitable theories or frameworks is one of the long-term research gaps identified by SDT\u2019s founders, Ryan and Deci [2]. Therefore, the first objective of this new systematic literature review is to determine the current state of SDT integration with other theories. The data had the opportunity to profoundly enlighten scholars about the current state of research and potential research gaps for further exploration. This will contribute significantly not only to the understanding of the development and future direction of SDT in the context of online learning, but also to the overall understanding of SDT outside of the educational context. This would aid academics in determining which theories are compatible with SDT for future research. This would aid in our comprehension of human motivation. As the theory of SDT evolved from a primary emphasis on internal perception based on autonomy, competence, and relatedness to its expanded version, its focus shifted from internal perception to external perception. As suggested by Rosli and Saleh [3], the term \u201cfull spectrum of SDT\u201d emerges. The SDT had been expanded by Ryan and Deci [20] to include intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation (external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration), and amotivation. However, this expansion diverts SDT research, as some researchers continue to use autonomy, competence, and relatedness as representations of SDT [21\u201323]. For others, the version of SDT used is the combination of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation [3,24,25]. This created a knowledge gap regarding what should actually be included in SDT-focused research. Due to the fact that SDT is comprised of five mini-theories and that basic psychological needs play a central role in SDT [26], it is essential to establish what should be included in an SDT study. Therefore, this new systematic literature review would give insight into what are actually the trends of factors included from the SDT to represent it as a theory. On the basis of the current state of research in SDT, it would eventually aid the scientific community in understanding the future direction of research and the formulation of research gaps. For a comprehensive understanding of the advancement, future direction, and gaps of the current state of SDT in online learning at the university, crucial methodological information is required, such as the samples used, research methods, and analysis employed [19]. This would not only provide an overview of the current state of research, but it would also enable future researchers to make decisions and formulate justifications for their research. SDT, a globally recognised theory, was implemented in numerous locations. Therefore, it is crucial for the global research community to comprehend the current state of research from a geographical perspective. By analysing the sampled articles, it is anticipated that\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655 3 of 21\nthis article will provide future researchers with the knowledge and inspiration to formulate research gaps based on the location of research. Finally, to further understand the future direction and research gaps based on this new systematic literature review, studying the future work suggests by the sampled articles would be beneficial. This information could be synthesised in order to suggest research gaps to be addressed in future studies. Our new systematic literature review provides not only information about the development and future direction of SDT, but also a list of future work that could be tapped for further exploration. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a new systematic literature review that could provide future researchers with novel information regarding the advancement, future direction, and research gaps of SDT in online learning conducted within the context of universities. Correspondingly, the following research questions have been formulated:\n1. What theories are used in the studies? 2. What factors are included in the studies? 3. What types of samples are included in the studies? 4. What research approaches and analysis were employed in the studies? 5. Where were the studies conducted geographically? 6. What are the future works suggested in the studies?"

            "text": "SDT is a widely used motivational factor that was developed by Deci, Connell, and Ryan [1]. The theory has earned international and multidisciplinary recognition for the study of human motivation. It is being used to understand motivational aspects in higher education [3], tourism [6], and sport [27]. In the context of education, SDT has been implemented in a variety of ecosystems, including universities [7], medical schools [28], AI education [11], and teacher innovation [29]. After more than thirty years of SDT\u2019s introduction as a theory and, later, as a theory that meets the needs of education, SDT has never escaped the attention of previous studies as a research topic. The previously published reviews of SDT identified in this new systematic review are listed in Table 1.\nThe literature reviews on SDT were analyzed to better comprehend the gaps not yet addressed by these reviews. At the same time, this could help us perceive the current state of the subject under review more accurately [35].\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655 4 of 21\nIn general, SDT reviews covered studies published from 1993 to 2011, as did those by Teixeira et al. [30] covering research about SDT in the context of exercises and physical activity. Even though it is a comprehensive review, it does not address SDT in online education, particularly in universities. Second, the reviews are restricted to articles published through 2011. A review in almost the same discipline was continued by Manninen et al. [32] with articles that were published until 2021. Both studies indicated that SDT influences physical activity. The impact of SDT is not limited to influencing individuals\u2019 perceptions of physical activity. In education, the same effect can be observed [31,33,34]. In 2009, Niemiec et al. [31] reported that students\u2019 motivation is influenced in multiple dimensions by implicit SDT. However, the review does not focus on online learning and university. A systematic review of SDT in educational research spanning two decades of published articles was subsequently published. As per the findings, satisfaction is a crucial indicator of academic performance and intrinsic motivation [33]. This review\u2019s exclusive focus on school students leaves open the question of the role, direction, and development of SDT research in higher education and online learning. In 2022, a review was conducted that focused on SDT in the context of MOOC research conducted between 2015 and 2020. Although this review partially addresses the aforementioned gap, it does not exclusively address online education. This leaves unanswered the question of the advancement and future direction of SDT research in the context of online learning in universities. It is also noteworthy that this article does not discover any review of SDT in online learning, despite the article\u2019s emphasis on SDT\u2019s educational applications. This demonstrates a knowledge gap regarding a review of SDT research in online education and universities. As a result, this new systematic review is crucial to alleviate the identified research and knowledge gap."

            "text": "The search for articles was conducted at the end of September 2022. This research will analyze all articles discovered in the involved databases, as the search does not restrict results based on publication year. This maneuver would enable this new systematic literature review to investigate the entire nature and structure of existing research and produce findings that are both comprehensive and in-depth. Two databases, Scopus, and Web of Science were used as data sources because these two databases cover multiple publishers and are well-known and widely used indexing bodies worldwide. Using the logic of Boolean operators, specific and highly exclusive keywords and search terms were used to ensure that the vast majority of relevant articles were included in this systematic literature review. Both \u201cSelf-Determination Theory\u201d and \u201cOnline Learning\u201d are used as keywords. It resulted in the search for information (TITLE-ABS-KEY (\u201cSelfDetermination Theory\u201d) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (\u201cOnline Learning\u201d)). For search in Web of Science, the same search terms \u201cSelf-Determination Theory\u201d and \u201cOnline Learning\u201d are used. Seventy-five articles were included in the initial version of this review after a search of Scopus. The initial data search on Web of Science yielded 103 articles based on the search terms used for this study. This study included a total of 178 articles published on SDT in online learning within a university context. Later, the researchers downloaded the Scopus and Web of Science-generated article information for further investigation. After comparing both sets of data, it was determined that 57 Web of Science articles are identical to Scopus results. The 57 duplicated articles were eliminated, reducing the number of articles from 178 to 121. The analysis is continued by searching for and downloading the complete articles of the 121 documents. Only 28 of the 121 articles could not be evaluated due to various factors. The remaining articles, a total of 93, were downloaded for further analysis. Analysis based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria further reduced the number of articles to 49, which covered research involving diverse samples, statistical approaches, geographical regions, as well as varying perspectives on SDT integration. The number of articles as well as the diversity of the articles satisfied the authors. After screening using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 articles were excluded for a variety of reasons, including the use of samples from outside the university ecosystem, such as school-based research. Another reason for exclusion is the absence of a clear framework or element of SDT in the conducted study. Figure 1 depicts the research flow based on the guidelines and procedures of PRISMA.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655 6 of 21Sustainability 2022, 14, 14655 6 of 23\nTo answer the formulated research questions, the 49 articles that had undergone the\nidentification, screening, and inclusion processes as recommended by PRISMA [36] were\nsubsequently analyzed critically and analytically for the trends and direction of SDT in\nonline learning research. Appendix A contains the articles being reviewed and included\nin this systematic review.\n4.1. Theory Integration\nThe majority of articles neither expand nor integrate SDT with other theories. Only\nnine of the fifty-nine articles, or 18.37 percent of the total, incorporate other theories into\nthe SDT.

According to the sampled articles, the majority of studies implement SDT without incorporating other theories. Nonetheless, there is a discernible trend toward integrating theories and models from the cognitive dimension. The integration of cognitive into SDT is spearheaded by the pioneers of the SDT, Deci and Ryan [75], who had integrated Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) into SDT. The CEF emphasized two types of motivation, namely intrinsic and extrinsic motivation [76]. The theory was also proposed by Deci, one of the SDT pioneers. The incorporation of CET into SDT is also evident in the articles sampled for this systematic review of the literature [25]. We infer that the preference for cognitive integration within SDT is due to the inclusion of cognitive dimensions such as CET within the mini theories that comprise SDT. Five mini theories comprise SDT:\nSustainability 2022, 14, 14655 11 of 21\nCognitive Evaluation Theory (CEF), organismic integration theory, causality orientations theory, basic psychological need theory, and goal content theory [77]. There is also some indication of the integration of SDT with the acceptance model. The sampled articles, for instance, incorporated the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology [70] and Task-Technology Fit [42] into SDT. For this reason, we infer that this behavior is caused by the nature of acceptance models such as the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which encourage the addition of external variables to the models. Future research in SDT, either in online learning or outside of the educational context, is anticipated to focus more on the integration of SDT with other theories and models, such as cognitive and acceptanceoriented theories and models. Integration with learning theories such as constructivism [61] and inquiry-based learning [78] is also possible."

The theory of basic psychological need identifies psychological nutrients that are essential for human psychology [77]. Intrinsic motivation, which originated from CET, is another element of SDT [37,77]. However, intrinsic motivation is rarely implemented without any SDT-related factors, such as extrinsic motivation. Originating from the Organismic Integration Theory, extrinsic motivation describes activities that are not intrinsically pleasurable [77,79]. Then, the SDT expanded further to external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration [20]. This resulted in various implementations of SDT in global research. Some studies identify autonomy, competence, and relatedness as fundamental SDT components [18,60,62,69,71]. In addition to basic psychological need, research also appears to include amotivation [46]. For a substantial portion of the studies, SDT is implemented through the use of intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation [38,39,41,43]. We suggest, based on the sampled article, that a research gap exists, namely, less emphasis is placed on understanding human motivation using SDT by integrating all of its components into a single package. Integration of autonomy, competence, relatedness, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation is believed to be necessary."

Therefore, the discussion should be incorporated into the research using the similar context of online learning. The results of this study are supported by findings from prior studies [19,80]. The opinions and feedback of students are essential for universities [81]. As no previous review was identified about SDT in online learning, thus there were no clear conclusions about the direction of research using lecturers as samples. Nonetheless, future research could use this information void as an impetus for exploration and research gap formulations. In addition to the lack of attention paid to the use of lecturers as samples, a trend is emerging to use mixed samples of lecturers and students [14,18,55,61].

The application of the Structural Equation Model technique constitutes a significant portion of quantitative analysis [14,43,58\u201362,73,83,84].

Other less complex statistical analyses, such as factor analysis [46], regression analysis [66,67], correlation analysis [39,44,68], MANOVA [22], MANCOVA [72], and nonparametric analyses such as the Mann-Whitney test [38,41], are also appropriate for future research. The quantitative dominance may be due to the availability of questionnaire-based instruments such as ASRQ and AMS. These closed-ended questionnaires have a strong correlation with quantitative analysis [49,85,86].

As the significance of online learning increased, the knowledge gap regarding advancements, future directions, and research gaps in this field of study became more important. This new systematic review of the literature examined the identified studies in terms of theory integration, sample type, methodological and statistical component, location, and future work. It is suggested that SDT should integrate with other theories and models in the future, as well as include lecturers or a mixed sample of lecturers and students in future research. As qualitative and mixed-methods research have yet to be exhaustively explored, quantitative analyses such as the Structural Equation Model are anticipated to remain a popular option. With research in other continents, such as Africa and South America, the scientific community may be able to comprehend the SDT in university-level online education in a more comprehensive and profound manner. Using a larger sample size and a more complex research design, such as longitudinal, time-series, and experimental studies, are two methods for bridging the research gap for future studies. This new systematic review synthesized the future direction that SDT should be integrated with other theories, with the integration of acceptance models such as TAM and UTAUT as well as cognitive theories serving as a bridgehead. It is anticipated that SDT research will include a greater number of SDT factors, such as amotivation, intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, and external regulation, using mixed samples of lecturers and students. Quantitative approaches and Asia will continue to be relevant with an emphasis on the Structural Equation Model analysis technique. Lack of research on the integration of SDT with other appropriate theories, fullspectrum SDT, and the inclusion of all SDT mini-theories in a single study were identified as research gaps. In addition to methodological gaps such as a lack of qualitative research, the need for a larger sample size, and the improvement of research design through the implementation of longitudinal and time series design, there is a gap in the sample of lecturers. It is anticipated that future research in South America and Africa will contribute to the global understanding of SDT, particularly in university-level online education.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.S.R.; Data curation, M.S.R. and N.S.S.; Formal analysis, M.S.R. and N.S.S.; Funding acquisition, M.S.R.; Investigation, M.S.R. and N.S.S.; Methodology, A.M.A. and S.A.B.; Project administration, M.S.R.; Validation, A.M.A. and S.A.B.; Visualization, A.M.A. and S.A.B.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.S.R.; Writing\u2014review & editing, N.S.S., A.M.A. and S.A.B.
