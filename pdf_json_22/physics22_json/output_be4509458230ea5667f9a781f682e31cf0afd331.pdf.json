    "abstractText": "Abstract We present the theoretical treatment of laser-assisted (e, 2e) ionizing collisions in hydrogen for fast electrons, in the framework of the first-order Born approximation at moderate laser intensities and photon energies beyond the soft-photon approximation. The interaction of the laser field with the incident, scattered, and ejected electrons is treated nonperturbatively by using Gordon-Volkov wave functions, while the atomic dressing is treated by using first-order perturbation theory. Within this semi-perturbative formalism we obtain a new closed formula for the nonlinear triple differential cross section (TDCS), which is valid for linear as well circular polarizations. New analytical simple expressions of TDCS are derived in the weak field domain and low-photon energy limit. It was found that for non-resonant (e, 2e) reactions the analytical formulas obtained for the atomic matrix element in the low-photon energy limit give a good agreement, qualitative and quantitative, with the numerical semi-perturbative model calculations. We study the influence of the photon energy as well of the kinetic energy of the ejected electron on the TDCS, in the asymmetric coplanar geometry, and show that the dressing of the atomic target strongly influences the (e, 2e) ionization process.",

INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that the study of the atomic ionization process by collisions with electrons, the so-called (e, 2e) reaction, reveals information about the electronic structure of the atomic target and residual ion [1], and is of interest in collision theory or in other fields such as plasma physics or astrophysics, which need reliable scattering cross section data [2]. Camilloni and coworkers [3] were the first to use (e, 2e) reaction as a tool for measuring the momentum distribution of the ejected electrons, in a coplanar symmetric scattering geometry where the outgoing electrons have equal energies and polar angles, at high incident and outgoing electron energies. Since then, an increasing number of (e, 2e) experiments have been performed over the years for different target atoms and for various kinematical configurations, and the electron momentum spectroscopy (EMS) has been developed to provide information on the electronic structure of atoms and molecules [4, 5]. The symmetric (e, 2e) reaction is the basis of EMS, also known as binary (e, 2e) spectroscopy, and is kinematically characterized by a large momentum transfer of the projectile electron and a small momentum of the residual ion. Another useful scattering configuration is the coplanar asymmetric geometry with fast incident electrons (keV) and ejected electrons of low and moderate energies, where most of the (e, 2e) reactions occur [6].\nIn the past few decades the electron-impact ionization of an atom in the presence of a laser field has become increasingly interesting and it is often referred to as the laser-assisted (e, 2e) collision [7]. Recently, H\u00f8\u0308hr and coworkers [8] performed the first kinematically-complete experiment for laser-assisted ionization in electron\u2013helium collisions at high incident electron energy (1 keV) and showed significant differences of the triple differential cross section (TDCS) in comparison to the field-free cross-sections. Very recently, Hiroi and coworkers [9] reported the observation the laser-assisted electron-impact ionization of Ar in an ultrashort intense laser field, and showed that the signal intensity of the laser-assisted process for one-photon absorption obtained by integrating the signals over the detection angle ranges is about twice as large as that estimated by previous theoretical calculations in which the atomic dressing by the laser field is neglected [12].\nA large number of papers have been published so far and several theoretical approaches have been proposed, involving ejected electrons of low energies that are studied under the combined influence of the laser field and the Coulomb field of the residual ion. The early\ntheoretical works on laser-assisted (e, 2e) scattering have neglected the dressing of the atomic target by the laser field or have used the closure approximation for laser-atom interaction. First, Jain and Tzoar introduced the Coulomb-Volkov wave functions [10], which takes into account the influence of the Coulomb field of the nucleus on the final electron state. Since then, the effect of the Coulomb interaction in the laser-assisted (e, 2e) collisions on hydrogen atom was studied in several papers by employing different types of final state wave functions like the Coulomb-Volkov or Coulomb corrected Gordon-Volkov wave functions. Banerji and Mittleman [11] calculated TDCS for ionization of hydrogen by electron impact, at low photon energies, in which the slow ejected electron was described by a modified Coulomb wave function, and the laser-electrons interactions were included in the low-frequency approximation. Cavaliere and coworkers [12] studied laser-assisted (e, 2e) collisions in hydrogen at low photon energies, high incident electron energies, and ejected electrons with moderate as well as small energies, in the first-order Born approximation, with the incident and scattered electrons described by the Gordon-Volkov wave functions [13, 14], while the ejected electron is represented by a modified Coulomb wave function. Later on, the dressing of the atomic target by the laser field has been included in the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT), and therefore the influence of the laser parameters such as intensity, polarization, and photon energy has attracted a lot of interest from the theoretical point of view. Joachain and coworkers [15] extended the semi-perturbative theory of Byron and Joachain [16], and showed the strong influence of a laser field on the dynamics of laser-assisted (e, 2e) collisions in hydrogen, for fast incident and scattered electrons and slow ejected electrons, in the Ehrhardt asymmetric coplanar geometry [17]. For (e, 2e) collisions in hydrogen with slow ejected electrons, Martin and coworkers [18] analyzed the influence of the laser parameters: photon energy, laser intensity, and polarization direction on the angular distribution of the ejected electrons. The influence of laser polarization has also been discussed by Ta\u0308\u0131eb and coworkers [19], who developed a dressed atomic wave functions on a basis of Sturmian functions, which allowed to take into account accurately the contribution of the continuum spectrum to the dressing of the atomic states [20]. Very recently, Makhoute and coworkers [21] presented their numerical results obtained for (e, 2e) collision in atomic hydrogen in the symmetric and asymmetric coplanar scattering geometries, at large photon energies. For the direct scattering channel the calculation of the specific radial amplitudes was performed by expanding the atomic wave functions in a Sturmian basis, whereas the closure approxi-\nmation was employed for the exchange channel. As mentioned before most of these previous theoretical works were focused on scattering geometries involving slow ejected electrons, and only recently it was shown for ejected electrons of high energies that the laser field strongly modifies the (e, 2e) collisions. New theoretical studies for laser-assisted EMS at high impact energy and large momentum transfer were published and it was found that the atomic dressing, calculated in the closure- and low-frequency approximations, substantially influences the laser-assisted TDCSs at low [22, 23] and large photon energies [24].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study the laser-assisted (e, 2e) reactions in hydrogen, in which the target atom is ionized in collision with an electron beam in the presence of a laser field, for fast incident and outgoing electrons, in an asymmetric coplanar scattering geometry, beyond the soft-photon approximation. We present a new method to derive the relevant atomic transition amplitude which takes into account the dressing of the target by the laser field. The laser field alone cannot significantly ionize the hydrogen atom since the photon energy is considered below the ionization threshold and the laser intensity is not high enough to allow ionization through a multiphoton process. We assume fast scattered electrons of sufficiently high velocity, such that we neglect their interaction with the Coulomb field of the remaining ion. Similar to the approach used in the Keldysh-FaisalReiss approximation [25\u201327], the influence of the remaining ion on the final state of the fast ejected electron is neglected, since the residual Coulomb field is weak compared to the laser field strength. We follow the approach of Ref. [15] in which the semi-perturbative theory [16] was generalized to laser-assisted fast (e, 2e) collisions in atomic hydrogen. In order to simplify the calculations we introduce several assumptions: (a) It is reasonable to employ a first-order Born treatment of the projectile-atom interaction, since we consider fast nonrelativistic collisions such that the velocities of the projectile and outgoing electrons are much larger than the atomic unit [28, 29]. (b) The non-relativistic Gordon-Volkov solutions are used for the incident and outgoing electrons to describe their interaction with the laser field. (c) The laser field intensity is considered moderate, but much weaker than the atomic unit (3.51\u00d7 1016 W/cm2), in order to avoid direct one- and multiphoton ionization. In contrast to other theoretical works we take into account the atomic dressing effects in the first-order TDPT in the laser field, going beyond the soft-photon approximation. The photon energy is considered below the ionization threshold of the hydrogen atom, and onephoton resonance transitions are allowed between the ground and excited states. (d) Since\nthe scattered and ejected electrons have high energies and of comparable order of magnitude, our semi-perturbative formalism takes into account the exchange effects in the first-order Born approximation. The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the theoretical method used in laser-assisted ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact, and derive new analytical formulas for the ionization transition amplitudes and TDCSs by electron impact. In the low-photon energy limit we provide simple analytic formulas of TDCSs, in a closed form, for the laser-assisted (e, 2e) ionization process which include the atomic dressing effects. Numerical results are presented in Sec. III, where the TDCSs for laser-assisted electron impact ionization of hydrogen are analyzed as a function of the scattering angle of the ejected electron and as a function of the photon energy. We have studied the modifications of the angular distributions of the ejected electrons due to the external laser field at different ejected electron energies and photon energies. Finally, summary and conclusions are given in Sec. IV. Atomic units (a.u.) are employed throughout this manuscript, unless otherwise specified."

Here \u03b3 (\u03c9, \u03b5) denotes a photon with the energy \u03c9 and the unit polarization vector \u03b5, and N = Ni \u2212 Nf is the net number of exchanged photons between the projectile-atom scattering system and the laser field. The laser field is treated classically, and within the\ndipole approximation is described as a monochromatic electric field,\nE(t) = (i/2) E0 e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03b5+ c.c., (2)\nwhere E0 represents the amplitude of the electric field. The magnetic vector potential, A(t), is simply calculated from E(t) = \u2212\u2202tA(t), as\nA(t) = (E0/\u03c9) [cos\u03c9t cos(\u03be/2) ej + sin\u03c9t sin(\u03be/2) el] , (3)\nwhere \u03b5 = cos(\u03be/2) ej+ i sin(\u03be/2) el is the polarization vector of the laser beam, with ej and el two different unit vectors along different orthogonal directions. \u03be represents the degree of ellipticity of the laser field which varies in the range \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 \u03c0/2, and determines the ellipticity of the field. The value \u03be = 0 corresponds to a linearly polarized (LP) laser field, while \u03be = \u03c0/2 corresponds to a left-hand circularly polarized (CP) laser field.\nA. Laser-dressed electronic and atomic wave functions\nAs mentioned before, we consider that the external laser field has a dominant influence and neglect the Coulomb interaction between fast outgoing electrons and residual ion in the scattered and ejected electron wave functions [25\u201327]. At sufficiently high projectile kinetic energies, it is well known that the first-order Born approximation in the scattering potential can be used to describe the electron impact ionization process [15, 28, 29]. We assume fast incident and outgoing electrons with kinetic energies much larger than the energy of a bound electron in the first Bohr orbit [30], since for the field-free (e, 2e) reaction in e-H collisions it is well known that the plane wave approximations agree well with experiment at kinetic energies above 200 eV [28, 31]. Thus, in the non-relativistic regime, as long as both Ef \u226b 1 a.u. and Ee \u226b 1 a.u., we describe the fast scattered and ejected electrons by GordonVolkov wave functions [10, 32, 33]. We should mention that the use of a Coulomb-Volkov wave function provides a more accurate treatment at small impact kinetic energies, where the effect of the proton\u2019s potential on the incoming and outgoing electrons is important [2, 30, 34]. In order to avoid the direct one- and multiphoton ionization processes, we consider that the electric field amplitude is weak with respect to the atomic unit of electric field strengths, E0 \u226a 5.1\u00d7 109 V/cm, i.e. the strength of the laser field is much lower than\nthe Coulomb field strength experienced by an electron in the first Bohr orbit. Therefore, we describe in a nonperturbative way the initial and final states of the projectile electron, as well the final state of the ejected electron interacting with a laser field by non-relativistic Gordon-Volkov wave functions [13, 14], expressed in the velocity gauge as\n\u03c7V k (r, t) = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 exp\n[\nik \u00b7 r\u2212 ik \u00b7\u03b1(t)\u2212 iEk t\u2212 i\n2\n\u222b t\ndt\u2032A2(t\u2032)\n]\n, (4)\nwhere r and k represent the position and momentum vectors, and Ek = k 2/2 is the kinetic energy of the electron. \u03b1(t) = \u222b t dt\u2032A(t\u2032) describes the classical oscillation motion of a free electron in the electric field defined by Eq. (2), and by using Eq. (3) we obtain\n\u03b1(t) = \u03b10 [ej sin\u03c9t cos(\u03be/2) + el cos\u03c9t sin(\u03be/2)] , (5)\nwhere \u03b10 = \u221a I/\u03c92 is the amplitude of oscillation, and I = E20 denotes the laser intensity. Obviously, as noticed from Eq. (4), at moderate field strengths the largest effect of the laser field on the free-electron state is determined by a dimensionless parameter k\u03b10, that depends on the electron and photon energies, and laser intensity. For example, a laser intensity of 1 TW/cm2, a photon energy of 3.1 eV, and an electron kinetic energy of 200 eV result in a value of k\u03b10 \u2243 1.58, while the ponderomotive energy acquired by an electron in the electric field Up = I/4\u03c9 2 is about 0.015 eV, and, therefore can be safely neglected compared to the photon and unbound electrons energies employed in the present paper.\nThe interaction of the hydrogen atom, initially in its ground state, with a laser field at moderate field strengths is considered within the first-order TDPT. An approximate solution for the wave function of an electron bound to a Coulomb potential in the presence of an electric field, also known as the dressed wave function, is written as\n\u03a81s (r1, t) = [ \u03c8 (0) 1s (r1, t) + \u03c8 (1) 1s (r1, t) ] exp\n[\n\u2212iE1t\u2212 i\n2\n\u222b t\ndt\u2032A2(t\u2032)\n]\n, (6)\nwhere r1 is the position vector of the bound electron, \u03c8 (0) 1s is the unperturbed wave function of the hydrogen atom ground state, and \u03c8 (1) 1s represents the first-order perturbative correction to the atomic wave function due to the external laser field. We employ the following expression of the first-order correction in the velocity gauge, \u03c8 (1) 1s , as described by Florescu and Marian\nin Ref. [35],\n\u03c8 (1) 1s (r1, t) = \u2212\n\u03b10\u03c9\n2\n[ \u03b5 \u00b7w100(E+1 ; r1)e\u2212i\u03c9t + \u03b5\u2217 \u00b7w100(E\u22121 ; r1)ei\u03c9t ] , (7)\nwith the linear-response vector, w100, defined by\nw100(E \u00b1 1 ; r1) = \u2212GC(E\u00b11 )P\u03c81s(r1), (8)\nwhere P denotes the momentum operator of the bound electron, and GC is the Coulomb Green\u2019s function. For the hydrogen atom in its ground state the linear-response vector was expressed in Ref. [35] as\nw100(E \u00b1 1 ; r1) = i(4\u03c0) \u22121/2B101(E\u00b11 ; r1) r\u03021, (9)\nwhere r\u03021 = r1/r1, and the energies E + 1 and E \u2212 1 take the following values\nE+1 = E1 + \u03c9 + i0, E \u2212 1 = E1 \u2212 \u03c9, (10)\nwith E1 = \u221213.6 eV representing the energy of the ground state. The radial function B101 in Eq. (9) was evaluated [35] using the Schwinger\u2019s integral representation of the Coulomb Green\u2019s function in momentum space including both bound and continuum eigenstates, and can be expressed in terms of Humbert function, \u03a61, as\nB101(\u03c4 ; r1) = 2 \u03c4\n2\u2212 \u03c4\n(\n2\n1 + \u03c4\n)2+\u03c4\nr1 e \u2212r1/\u03c4\u03a61(2\u2212 \u03c4,\u22121\u2212 \u03c4, 3\u2212 \u03c4, \u03be1, \u03b71), (11)\nwhere the parameter \u03c4 takes two values \u03c4\u00b1 = 1/ \u221a \u22122E\u00b11 , and the variables of the Humbert function are \u03be1 = (1\u2212 \u03c4)/2 and \u03b71 = (1\u2212 \u03c4)r1/\u03c4 .\nB. The nonlinear scattering matrix\nWe employ a semi-perturbative approach of the scattering process which is similar to that developed by Byron and Joachain [16] for free-free transitions, in which the secondorder Born correction is negligible compared to the laser-dressing effects. The evaluation\nof the scattering amplitude is very challenging due to the complex three-body interaction: projectile electron, bound electron, and laser field. However, since we assume that both scattered and ejected electrons have large kinetic energies the calculation simplifies, and we can derive a closed form expression for the TDCS. Thus, the initial state of the scattering system is calculated as the product of the initial states of the fast incident electron and atomic target dressed by the laser field, \u03c7V ki (r0, t) and \u03a81s(r1, t), while the final state is calculated as the product of the final states of the fast scattered and ejected electrons, which are approximated as Gordon-Volkov wave functions. Our treatment differs from that of Ta\u0308\u0131eb and coworkers [19] in the fact that we dress the fast projectile and ejected electrons to all order in the laser field and we dress the atomic target by using an atomic wave function corrected to the first order in the laser field [35]. As mentioned before, we focus our study at moderate laser intensities (I \u2264 1 TW/cm2) and fast projectile electrons (Ei, Ef \u2265 1 keV) such that the interaction between the projectile electron and hydrogen atom is well treated within the first-order Born approximation in the static scattering potential Vd(r0, r1) = \u22121/r0+1/|r1 \u2212 r0| for the direct channel, and Vex(r0, r1) = \u22121/r1+1/|r1 \u2212 r0| for the exchange channel.\nIn order to describe the scattering process (1) we employ the direct and exchange scattering matrix elements [36], which are calculated at high kinetic energies of the projectile and ejected electrons as\nSB1fi,d = \u2212i \u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt \u3008\u03c7V kf (r0, t)\u03c7 V ke (r1, t)|Vd(r0, r1)|\u03c7Vki(r0, t)\u03a81s(r1, t)\u3009, (12)\nSB1fi,ex = \u2212i \u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt \u3008\u03c7V kf (r1, t)\u03c7 V ke (r0, t)|Vex(r0, r1)|\u03c7Vki(r0, t)\u03a81s(r1, t)\u3009, (13)\nwhere \u03c7V ki(f) and \u03c7V ke , given by Eq. (4), represent the Gordon-Volkov wave functions of the projectile and emitted electrons embedded in the laser field, whereas \u03a81s, given by Eq. (6), represents the wave function of the bound electron interacting with the laser field. By using the Jacobi-Anger identity [37], e\u2212ix sin\u03c9t \u2261 \u2211+\u221e\nN=\u2212\u221e JN(x)e \u2212iN\u03c9t, we expand the oscillating\npart of the Gordon-Volkov wave functions occurring in the scattering matrix elements, Eqs. (12) and (13), in terms of the ordinary Bessel functions of the first kind, JN , as\nexp [\u2212iq \u00b7\u03b1(t)] = +\u221e \u2211\nN=\u2212\u221e\nJN(Rq)e\u2212iN\u03c9t+iN\u03c6q , (14)\nwhere the argument of the Bessel function is defined by Rq = \u03b10|\u03b5 \u00b7q|, and \u03c6q represents the dynamical phase which is calculated as ei\u03c6q = \u03b5 \u00b7 q/|\u03b5 \u00b7 q|, where q = ki \u2212 kf \u2212 ke denotes the recoil momentum vector of the ionized target, H+. Clearly, for a CP laser field a change of helicity, i.e. \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u2217, leads to a change of the sign of the dynamical phase, \u03c6q \u2192 \u2212\u03c6q in the TDCS, while for a LP laser field ei\u03c6q = \u00b11, and \u03c6q = n\u03c0 with n an integer.\nFor the direct channel, by replacing Eqs. (4), (6), and (14) into Eq. (12), we obtain the scattering matrix for electron-hydrogen collisions in a laser field, after performing the integration with respect to time,\nSB1fi,d = \u22122\u03c0i +\u221e \u2211\nN=Nmin\n\u03b4(Ef + Ee \u2212 Ei \u2212 E1 \u2212N\u03c9) TN,d , (15)\nwhere the Dirac function, \u03b4, assures the energy conservation which implies that the kinetic energy of the scattered electron is determined by the relation Ef = Ei + E1 \u2212 Ee + N\u03c9. Here the kinetic energy of the residual ion, Eq = q 2/2mp, has been neglected in comparison to any of the electrons kinetic energies, Ej , (j = i, f , and e), since the mass of the residual ion (proton) is much larger than the electron mass. The energy spectrum of the scattered electron consists of an elastic line, N = 0, and a number of sidebands corresponding to the positive and negative values of N . Obviously, for a given value of the ejected electron energy, Ee, the net number of exchanged photons is limited and cannot be smaller than a minimal value that is the integer of Nmin = (Ee \u2212 Ei \u2212 E1)/\u03c9. The total nonlinear transition amplitude, TN,d, for the laser-assisted (e, 2e) ionization process in the direct channel can be split as a sum of two terms\nTN,d = T (0) N,d + T (1) N,d , (16)\nwhere T (0) N and T (1) N represent the electronic and atomic transition amplitudes. The first term on the right-hand side of the total transition amplitude Eq. (16), T (0) N , is the transition amplitude due to projectile electron contribution, in which the atomic dressing terms are neglected,\nT (0) N,d =\n1 25/2\u03c07/2 eiN\u03c6q \u22062 JN(Rq)\n\u222b\ndr1 e \u2212ike\u00b7r1(ei\u2206\u00b7r1 \u2212 1)\u03c81s(r1), (17)\nwhere the integration over the projectile coordinate, r0, was performed using the Bethe\nintegral, and \u2206 = ki \u2212 kf is the vector of momentum transfer from the incident to the scattered electron. After performing the radial integration with respect to r1 in Eq. (17), the electronic transition amplitude can be simply expressed as\nT (0) N,d = \u2212\n1\n(2\u03c0)2 JN(Rq) fB1ion(\u2206, q, ke) eiN\u03c6q , (18)\nwhere\nfB1ion(\u2206, q, ke) = \u2212 25/2\n\u03c0\u22062\n[\n1 (q2 + 1)2 \u2212 1\n(k2e + 1) 2\n]\n, (19)\nis the direct scattering amplitude in the first-order plane-wave Born approximation for ionization of hydrogen atom by electron impact in the absence of the laser field [1, 33]. In the electronic transition amplitude, Eq. (18), the interaction between the laser field and the projectile and ejected electrons is contained in the argument of the Bessel function Rq = ( \u221a I/\u03c92)|\u03b5 \u00b7 q|, and phase \u03c6q, being decoupled from the kinematic term. This feature is a characteristic of employing Gordon-Volkov wave functions for fast electrons and moderate laser intensities [30, 38, 39]. The field-free electronic scattering amplitude fB1ion contains a factor, \u22122/\u22062, which is related to the first-order Born amplitude corresponding to scattering by the Coulomb potential \u22121/r0, while the two terms in the squared brackets of Eq. (19) are related to the momentum transfer to the residual ion, q, and the momentum of the ejected electron, ke, respectively. For the field-free (e, 2e) collisions in the plane-wave Born approximation, the first term in the right-side-hand of Eq. (19) gives rise to the so-called binary encounter peak [40], which occurs at very low residual ion momentum q \u2243 0. The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (16), T\n(1) N , represents the first-order atomic\ntransition amplitude and corresponds to processes in which the hydrogen atom absorbs or emits one photon and is subsequently ionized by the projectile electron impact. T (1) N occurs due to modification of the atomic state by the laser field, the so-called atomic dressing, which is described by the first-order radiative correction, \u03c8 (1) 1s (r1, t), in Eq. (7). After some straightforward algebra, integrating over the projectile coordinate, r0, the direct first-order atomic transition amplitude can be written as\nT (1) N,d = \u2212\n\u03b10\u03c9\n2\n[ JN\u22121(Rq) M(1)at (\u03c9)ei(N\u22121)\u03c6q + JN+1(Rq) M(1)at (\u2212\u03c9)ei(N+1)\u03c6q ] , (20)\nwhere M(1)at (\u03c9) denotes the specific first-order atomic transition matrix element related to\none-photon absorption,\nM(1)at (\u03c9) = 1\n25/2\u03c07/2\u22062\n\u222b\ndr1 e \u2212ike\u00b7r1 (ei\u2206\u00b7r1 \u2212 1)\u03b5 \u00b7w100(E+1 ; r1), (21)\nwhereas the transition matrix element M(1)at (\u2212\u03c9) is related to one-photon emission\nM(1)at (\u2212\u03c9) = 1\n25/2\u03c07/2\u22062\n\u222b\ndr1 e \u2212ike\u00b7r1(ei\u2206\u00b7r1 \u2212 1) \u03b5\u2217 \u00b7w100(E\u22121 ; r1), (22)\nwhere the energies E\u00b11 are given in Eq. (10). Obviously, in Eq. (20) only one photon is exchanged (emitted or absorbed) between the laser field and the bound electron, while the remaining N + 1 or N \u2212 1 photons are exchanged between the laser field and the projectile electron. By performing the radial integral over r1 in Eq. (21) we derive the first-order atomic matrix element for one-photon absorption as,\nM(1)at (\u03c9) = \u2212 1\n23/2\u03c03\u22062\n[ (\u03b5 \u00b7 q\u0302) J101(\u03c9, q)\u2212 (\u03b5 \u00b7 k\u0302e) J101(\u03c9,\u2212ke) ] , (23)\nwhile the following changes are made \u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9 and \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u2217 in Eq. (23) to obtain the firstorder atomic transition matrix element, M(1)at (\u2212\u03c9), for one-photon emission. The expression of the atomic radial integral J101, is given by\nJ101(\u00b1\u03c9, p) = \u222b \u221e\n0\ndr1 r 2 1 j1(pr1) B101(E\u00b11 ; r1), (24)\nwith J101(\u03c9,\u2212p) = \u2212J101(\u03c9, p), where p = q or ke. After performing some algebra in Eq. (24), by using the expansion of the spherical Bessel function, j1, an analytical form of the radial integral is obtained in terms of two Appell\u2019s hypergeometric function, F1, as\nJ101(\u03c9, p) = 26\u03c4\np (2\u2212 \u03c4)(1 + \u03c4)4 Re\n[\na3F1(b, 1, 3, b+ 1, x, y)\u2212 ia2\n2p F1(b, 2, 2, b+ 1, x, y)\n]\n,\n(25)\nin which a = \u03c4/(1 + ip\u03c4), b = 2 \u2212 \u03c4 , and the variables of the Appell\u2019s hypergeometric function are\nx = \u03c4 \u2212 1 \u03c4 + 1 , y = (1\u2212 \u03c4)(1\u2212 ip\u03c4) (1 + \u03c4)(1 + ip\u03c4) , (26)\nwhere the parameter \u03c4 depends on the photon energy, \u03c9, and it takes two values, \u03c4\u2212 =\n1/ \u221a \u22122E+1 and \u03c4+ = 1/ \u221a \u22122E\u22121 , corresponding to the two energies E+1 and E\u22121 defined in Eq. (10). The first-order atomic matrix element, Eq. (23), has a structure that explicitly contains the scalar products \u03b5\u00b7q\u0302 and \u03b5\u00b7k\u0302e, depends on the scattering geometry, being written in a closed form that allows us to analyze the dependence on the laser field polarization. The last term in the right-hand side of the electronic scattering amplitude and atomic matrix element, Eqs. (19) and (23), occurs due to the non-orthogonality of the Gordon-Volkov wave function of the ejected electron and the initial ground-state wave function of the hydrogen atom. The structure of Eq. (23) is also similar to other processes, with the vectors q and ke replaced by vectors which are specific to each particular process, such as elastic laserassisted scattering of electrons by hydrogen atoms [41, 42], bremsstrahlung cross sections in the electron-hydrogen atom collisions [43], or laser-assisted electron-impact excitation of hydrogen atoms [39].\nC. The nonlinear scattering matrix for exchange scattering\nOur formalism does not neglect the exchange effects between the scattered and ejected electrons in both the electronic and atomic terms, since fast incident and outgoing electrons are involved in the calculation, and, as in the EMS experiments their kinetic energies could have comparable orders of magnitude. In the first-order Born approximation in the exchange potential, Vex, we obtain the exchange scattering matrix for the laser-assisted (e, 2e) reactions, after performing the integration with respect to time in Eq. (13),\nSB1fi,ex = \u22122\u03c0i +\u221e \u2211\nN=Nmin\n\u03b4(Ef + Ee \u2212 Ei \u2212 E1 \u2212N\u03c9) TN,ex , (27)\nwhere TN,ex = T (0) N,ex+T (1) N,ex. The electronic transition amplitude for the exchange scattering, T (0) N,ex, in which the atomic dressing contribution is neglected, can be expressed as\nT (0) N,ex = \u2212\n1\n(2\u03c0)2 JN(Rq) gB1ion,ex(\u2206e, q) eiN\u03c6q , (28)\nwhere\ngB1ion,ex(\u2206e, q) = \u2212 25/2\n\u03c0\u22062e(q 2 + 1)2\n, (29)\ndenotes the electronic exchange amplitude in the absence of the laser field, that is in agreement to the Born-Ochkur approximation [36, 44], and \u2206e represents the amplitude of the momentum transfer vector from the incident to the ejected electron, \u2206e = ki \u2212 ke. Similarly to the direct scattering, the first-order atomic transition amplitude for the exchange scattering can be expressed as\nT (1) N,ex = \u2212\n\u03b10\u03c9\n2\n[ JN\u22121(Rq) M(1)at,ex(\u03c9)ei(N\u22121)\u03c6q + JN+1(Rq) M(1)at,ex(\u2212\u03c9)ei(N+1)\u03c6q ] , (30)\nwhere\nM(1)at,ex(\u00b1\u03c9) = \u2212 \u03b5 \u00b7 q\u0302\n23/2\u03c03\u22062e J101(\u00b1\u03c9, q), (31)\nand J101(\u00b1\u03c9, q) is calculated from Eq. (25). Obviously, the exchange effects for both electronic and atomic contributions to the transition amplitude vary like \u2206\u22122e , and cannot be neglected in comparison to the contribution of the direct scattering channel if ke and kf are of comparable order of magnitude. In contrast, for very fast incident and scattered electrons, with ki and kf much larger than the atomic unit, and slow ejected electrons, ke \u226a kf , the electronic and atomic exchange terms can be neglected compared to the corresponding direct terms.\nD. The low-photon energy approximation\nIn the low-photon energy limit where the photon energy is small compared to the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom (typically in the infrared region), it is worth presenting some useful simple approximation formulas for the atomic transition amplitude. In most theoretical works the analytical calculations cannot be done exactly and, as the photon energy remains small is expected that only few intermediate bound states to contribute to the atomic transition amplitude and thus to approximate the complicated analytical formulas. This is the key of the closure approximation method [16], which consists in replacing the difference energy En\u2212E1 by an average excitation energy \u03c9\u0304 \u2243 4/9 a.u. for the hydrogen atom in approximating the sum over the intermediate states in the atomic transition amplitudes. Here we present a different approach based on the low-frequency approximation (LFA), given by the lowest-order term of the expansion of the atomic matrix element M(1)at (\u03c9) in powers of the laser photon energy. After some algebra we derive an approximate formula for the\natomic radial integral, J101, in the low-photon energy limit \u03c9 \u226a |E1| in Eq. (25), in the first order in \u03c9,\nJ101(\u03c9, p) \u2243 \u2212 16 p\n(p2 + 1)3\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c9 2 p2 \u2212 9 p2 + 1\n)\n, (32)\nwhere p = q or ke, and, therefore the atomic transition amplitude for the direct process, Eq. (20), in the low-photon energy limit reads as\nT (1) N,d \u2243 \u03b10\u03c9\n23/2eiN\u03c6q\n\u03c03\u22062\n{ JN\u22121(Rq)e\u2212i\u03c6q [ \u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n+ JN+1(Rq)ei\u03c6q [ \u03b5\u2217 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5\u2217 \u00b7 ke\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n+ \u03c9\n2 JN\u22121(Rq)e\u2212i\u03c6q\n[\n\u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 \u2212 9) (q2 + 1)4 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke (k2e \u2212 9)\n(k2e + 1) 4\n]\n\u2212 \u03c9 2 JN+1(Rq)ei\u03c6q\n[\n\u03b5\u2217 \u00b7 q (q2 \u2212 9) (q2 + 1)4 + \u03b5\u2217 \u00b7 ke (k2e \u2212 9)\n(k2e + 1) 4\n]}\n. (33)\nFor a LP laser field the following formula holds, JN (Rq) = JN(\u03b10 \u03b5 \u00b7q)e\u2212iN\u03c6q , and we obtain from Eqs. (18) and (19) the direct electronic transition amplitude,\nT (0),LP N,d =\n21/2\n\u03c03\u22062 JN(\u03b10 \u03b5 \u00b7 q)\n[\n1 (q2 + 1)2 \u2212 1\n(k2e + 1) 2\n]\n, (34)\nand the direct atomic transition amplitude, Eq. (33), simplifies to\nT (1),LP N,d \u2243\n25/2\n\u03c03 \u03c9 \u22062\n{ NJN (\u03b10 \u03b5 \u00b7 q) [\n1\n(q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke \u03b5 \u00b7 q\n1\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n+ \u03b10\u03c9\n2 J\n\u2032 N(\u03b10 \u03b5 \u00b7 q) [ \u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 \u2212 9) (q2 + 1)4 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke (k2e \u2212 9)\n(k2e + 1) 4\n]}\n, (35)\nwhere we have used the recurrence relation JN\u22121(x) + JN+1(x) = JN(x)(2N/x), and J \u2032 N is the first derivative of the Bessel function which satisfies the relation J \u2032\nN(x) = [JN\u22121(x) \u2212 JN+1(x)]/2, with x = \u03b10(\u03b5 \u00b7 q), [37]. If we consider the lowest order in the photon energy \u03c9 in Eq. (35)\nT (1),LP N,d \u2243\n25/2\n\u03c03 N\u03c9 \u22062 JN(\u03b10 \u03b5 \u00b7 q)\n[\n1\n(q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke \u03b5 \u00b7 q\n1\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n, (36)\nwe obtain the LFA formula for N -photon absorption atomic transition element in the case of a LP field. However, in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 for scattering parameters such that Rq \u226b 1, i.e\nthere is a strong coupling between the projectile and ejected electrons and the laser field, the transition amplitudes derived in the semi-perturbative approach do not diverge, but approach the zero value, due to asymptotic behavior of the Bessel function of the first kind [37] at large arguments, JN(x) \u2243 \u221a\n2/\u03c0x cos(x\u2212N\u03c0/2\u2212 \u03c0/4), for x\u2192 \u221e. Furthermore, whenever the condition Rq \u226a 1 is satisfied, i.e. the perturbative regime of low laser intensities where \u03b10 \u226a 1 a.u. and/or scattering kinematics with |\u03b5 \u00b7 q| \u226a 1 a.u., we can use the approximate formula for the Bessel function at small arguments,\nJN(Rq) \u2243 1\nN ! (Rq 2 )N , for N > 0, (37)\nand JN(Rq) = (\u22121)\u2212NJ\u2212N(Rq), for N \u2264 0 [37]. Thus, in the perturbative region with Rq \u226a 1, we obtain from Eq. (34) a simple formula for the direct electronic transition amplitude for N -photon absorption (N > 0), as\nT (0),LP N,d \u2243 \u03b1N0\n21/2\n\u03c03\u22062N !\n( \u03b5 \u00b7 q 2 )N [\n1 (q2 + 1)2 \u2212 1\n(k2e + 1) 2\n]\n, (38)\nwhile for the direct atomic transition amplitude for N -photon absorption in the LFA we obtain from Eq. (36)\nT (1),LP N,d \u2243 \u03b1N0\n25/2N\u03c9 \u03c03\u22062N ! ( \u03b5 \u00b7 q 2 )N [\n1\n(q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke \u03b5 \u00b7 q\n1\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n. (39)\nExpressions similar to Eqs. (34)-(35) and Eqs. (38)-(39) can be easily derived for the exchange scattering channel. As expected, the electronic and atomic transition amplitudes are important at scattering and ejected angles where the momenta q, \u2206, and \u2206e are small. The ratio of the direct atomic and electronic transition amplitudes derived in the low-photon energy limit, Eqs. (39) and (38),\nT (1),LP N,d T (0),LP N,d \u2243 4N\u03c9 q2 + 1 [ 1 + (q2 + 1)3 (k2e + 1) 3 \u03b5 \u00b7 ke \u03b5 \u00b7 q ] [ 1\u2212 (q 2 + 1)2 (k2e + 1) 2 ]\u22121 , (40)\nshows that, compared to the projectile electron contribution, the first-order atomic dressing effects for \u03c9 \u226a 1 a.u. and laser parameters such that Rq \u226a 1, are increasing with the net number of exchanged photons, N , and photon energy, \u03c9, and are decreasing with the\nmomenta of the ejected electron, ke, and residual ion, q. Obviously, Eq. (40) shows that differences occur in the TDCSs for absorption or emission of N photons, which correspond to positive or negatives values of N , due to constructive or destructive interferences of the electronic and atomic terms in TDCS.\nIn the case of one-photon absorption (N = 1) in the perturbative regime with Rq \u226a 1 and low photon energies we can use the approximate formula for the Bessel function, Eq. (37), and by keeping only the first order in laser field intensity, I, we obtain simple formulas for the direct electronic transition amplitude, Eq. (18),\nT (0) N=1,d \u2243\n\u221a I\n21/2\u03c03 \u03b5 \u00b7 q \u03c92\u22062\n[\n1 (q2 + 1)2 \u2212 1\n(k2e + 1) 2\n]\n, (41)\nas well for the direct atomic transition amplitude derived in the low-photon energy limit, Eq. (33),\nT (1) N=1,d \u2243\n23/2\n\u03c03\n\u221a I\n\u03c9\u22062\n[\n\u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)3\n(\n1 + \u03c9\n2 q2 \u2212 9 q2 + 1\n)\n+ \u03b5 \u00b7 ke\n(k2e + 1) 3\n(\n1 + \u03c9\n2 k2e \u2212 9 k2e + 1\n)]\n. (42)\nMoreover, if we keep the lowest order in the photon energy in Eq. (42) we obtain a quite simple formula for the direct atomic transition amplitude\nT (1) N=1,d \u2243\n23/2\n\u03c03\n\u221a I\n\u03c9\u22062\n[\n\u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)3 + \u03b5 \u00b7 ke\n(k2e + 1) 3\n]\n, (43)\nin the LFA for one-photon absorption in the perturbative regime. Similarly, for the exchange scattering we derive simple approximate formulas for the electronic and atomic transition amplitudes at Rq \u226a 1, Eqs. (28) and (30) in the low-photon energy limit, as\nT (0) N=1,ex \u2243\n1\n21/2\u03c03\n\u221a I\n\u03c92\u22062e\n\u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)2 , (44)\nT (1) N=1,ex \u2243\n23/2\n\u03c03\n\u221a I\n\u03c9\u22062e\n\u03b5 \u00b7 q (q2 + 1)3\n(\n1 + \u03c9\n2 q2 \u2212 9 q2 + 1\n)\n. (45)\nThe infrared divergence in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 is evident in all the above electronic and atomic transition amplitude expressions derived at Rq \u226a 1. Thus, in the perturbative regime and low-photon energy approximation the electronic transition amplitude varies like \u03c9\u22122, while the atomic transition amplitude varies like \u03c9\u22121, which is reminiscent of the infrared\ndivergence of quantum electrodynamics [45] and Low theorem [46] in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0. Clearly, these simple analytical formulas we have derived for one-photon absorption, as well for nonlinear atomic transition amplitudes might provide more physical insight into the laser-assisted (e, 2e) reactions.\nE. The triple differential cross section\nIt is well known that the TDCS can provide useful information about collision dynamics in the electron-impact ionization process [7]. For laser-assisted (e, 2e) collisions accompanied by the transfer of N photons, we calculate the nonlinear TDCS in the first-order Born approximation in the scattering potential, for unpolarized incident projectile and hydrogen beams, and without distinguishing between the final spin states of the electrons,\nd3\u03c3B1N d\u2126f d\u2126e dEf = (2\u03c0)4 kfke ki\n(\n1 4 |TN,d + TN,ex|2 + 3 4 |TN,d \u2212 TN,ex|2\n)\n, (46)\naveraged over the initial spin states and summed over the final spin states. The projectile electrons are scattered into the solid angle \u2126f and \u2126f +d\u2126f with the kinetic energy between Ef and Ef + dEf , and the ejected electrons are emitted within the solid angle \u2126e and \u2126e + d\u2126e. The TDCS is a function of the electrons momentum vectors ki,kf , and ke, and depends on the laser parameters: intensity I, photon energy \u03c9, and polarization \u03b5. The dominant contribution to TDCS is due to collisions involving small momentum transfers \u2206 and \u2206e, small momentum of the residual ion q, or near resonance photon energies. The TDCS for the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process is given by\nd3\u03c3B1\nd\u2126f d\u2126e dEf =\n+\u221e \u2211\nN=Nmin\nd3\u03c3B1N d\u2126f d\u2126e dEf . (47)\nBy integrating TDCS over the direction of the scattered electrons, \u2126f , we obtain the double differential cross section of the ejected electrons, while by integrating TDCS over the direction of the ejected electrons, \u2126e, we derive the double differential cross section of the scattered electrons. Finally, the total ionization cross section is deduced by integrating over the angles and energies of the scattered and ejected electrons.\nBy neglecting the atomic dressing in Eq. (46), namely T (1) N,d \u2243 0 and T (1) N,ex \u2243 0, at small\nmomentum of the residual ion, q \u226a ke, we obtain a simple formula for the laser-assisted TDCS,\nd3\u03c3B1N d\u2126f d\u2126e dEf \u2243 kfke ki |JN(Rq)|2 4 \u22064\n(\n1\u2212 \u2206 2\n\u22062e +\n\u22064 \u22064e\n)\n|\u03c8(0)1s (q)|2, (48)\nthat \u201cdecouples\u201d into a product of three factors: (i) the squared Bessel function which includes the laser-projectile and ejected electrons interaction, (ii) the electron-electron collision factor in the first-order Born approximation\nfB1ee = 1\n4\u03c04\u22064\n(\n1\u2212 \u2206 2\n\u22062e +\n\u22064 \u22064e\n)\n,\nthat is the absolute square of the half-off-shell Coulomb-matrix element summed and averaged over final and initial spin states for fast projectile and outgoing electrons [47], and (iii) |\u03c8(0)1s (q)|2 = 8\u03c0\u22122(q2 + 1)\u22124 that represents the squared momentum-space wave function for the ground state of atomic hydrogen [1]. Equation (48) is in agreement to the TDCS derived for EMS by Kouzakov and coworkers, namely Eq. (26) in Ref. [22]. The half-off-shell Mott scattering TDCS, for fast projectile and outgoing electrons that includes the exchange terms, [4, 36], is simply calculated as (2\u03c0)4fB1ee ,\n(\nd\u03c3\nd\u2126e\n)\nee\n= 4\n\u22064\n(\n1\u2212 \u2206 2\n\u22062e +\n\u22064 \u22064e\n)\n. (49)\nIf we take into account the atomic dressing in Eq. (46) in the low-photon energy limit \u03c9 \u226a |E1|, and consider the lowest order in the photon energy in Eq. (33), at small momentum of the residual ion, q \u226a ke, we obtain\nd3\u03c3B1N d\u2126f d\u2126e dEf \u2243 kfke ki |JN(Rq)|2 ( d\u03c3 d\u2126e )\nee\n(\n1 + 4N\u03c9\nq2 + 1\n)2\n|\u03c8(0)1s (q)|2, (50)\nthat is in agreement to the laser-assisted TDCS derived in the low-photon energy approximation for EMS by Bulychev and coworkers, namely Eqs. (9)-(11) in Ref. [23]. In contrast to Eq. (48) in which the atomic dressing effects are neglected, the TDCS Eq. (50) does not obey the well-known Kroll-Watson sum rule [48]. Obviously, the TDCS in the laser-assisted (e, 2e) collisions provides valuable information about the collision dynamics [4], electronic structure of the target, and can be used to derive the momentum density distribution of the target electron, which was first demonstrated for hydrogen and helium atoms [1, 31]."

            "text": "In this section we present our numerical results for the laser-assisted electron-impact ionizing collisions in hydrogen, described by Eq. (1), for fast incident and outgoing electrons, and we apply the semi-perturbative formulas derived in Sec. II to calculate the nonlinear TDCSs in the presence of a LP laser field. Obviously, due to the complicated analytical form of the laser-dressed atomic wave function, the total scattering amplitude has to be numerically evaluated. It is worth pointing out that the electronic and atomic transition amplitudes, Eqs. (18), (20), (28), and (30), as well their approximations derived in Subsec. IID are applicable for arbitrary scattering configurations and laser field polarizations. We study the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process in the coplanar geometry depicted in Fig. 1, in which the momenta of the electrons, ki,kf , and ke, lie in the same plane where the two outgoing electrons are detected in coincidence at the scattering angles \u03b8f and \u03b8e, with equal corresponding azimuthal angles \u03d5f = \u03d5e = \u03d5i. The momentum vector of the incident electron, ki, is taken parallel to the z axis, with \u03b8i = 0 \u25e6 and \u03d5i = 0 \u25e6, and the scattering angle \u03b8f of the scattered electron is fixed, while the angle \u03b8e of the ejected electron is varied. The asymmetric scattering geometry is considered in which \u03b8f 6= \u03b8e and kf 6= ke. At this point it is useful to recall the differences between the symmetric and asymmetric scattering geometries, namely the symmetric geometry is defined by the requirement that the scattering angles and energies of the scattered and ejected electrons are equal. In a kinematically complete experiment by measuring the momentum vectors of both ejected electron and ionized target, ke and q, we can deduce the momentum of the scattered electron, kf = ki \u2212 ke \u2212 q, as well as the momentum transfer of the scattered electron, \u2206 = ki \u2212kf , occurring during the collision [8]. Thus, from the energy conservation law, the final momentum of the projectile is given by kf = (k 2 i \u2212 k2e + 2E1 + 2N\u03c9) 1/2 , while the momentum transfer of the projectile is simple calculated as \u2206 = (k2i + k 2 f \u2212 2kikf cos \u03b8f )1/2. The Cartesian components of the momentum transfer vector, \u2206, are given by (\u2212kf sin \u03b8f , 0, ki \u2212 kf cos \u03b8f ) and the amplitude \u2206 varies in the range |ki \u2212 kf | \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 ki + kf , for forward \u03b8f = 0\u25e6 and backward \u03b8f = 180\u25e6 scattering, respectively. Similarly, the amplitude of the momentum transfer vector \u2206e is calculated as \u2206e = (k 2 i +k 2 e \u22122kike cos \u03b8e)1/2. The amplitude of the recoil momentum vector\nof the residual ion, q, is given by\nq = [\u22062 + k2e \u2212 2kike cos \u03b8e + 2kfke cos(\u03b8f \u2212 \u03b8e)] 1/2 . (51)\nThe argument Rq of the Bessel functions is calculated as\nR2q = R2i +R2f +R2e \u2212 2RiRf cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6f)\u2212 2RiRe cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6e) + 2RfRe cos(\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6e),\nwhere Rs = \u03b10|\u03b5 \u00b7 ks| and ei\u03c6s = \u03b5 \u00b7 ks/|\u03b5 \u00b7 ks|, with s = i, f , and e. For a LP laser field the dependence of Rs on the laser polarization is given by Rs = \u03b10|ej \u00b7 ks| and \u03c6s = n\u03c0, while for a CP field with the polarization unit vector \u03b5 = (ej + iel)/ \u221a 2, we obtain Rs = (\u03b10/ \u221a 2) \u221a\n(ej \u00b7 ks)2 + (el \u00b7 ks)2 and \u03c6s = arctan (el \u00b7 ks)/(ej \u00b7 ks)+n\u03c0, where n is an integer. In our numerical calculation we consider that the laser field is linearly polarized in the same direction along the momentum vector of the incident electron, \u03b5||ki. Specifically, for a LP laser field and a coplanar scattering geometry with \u03c6i = \u03c6f = \u03c6e = 0 \u25e6 the argument of the Bessel function simplifies to Rq = \u03b10(ki \u2212 kf cos \u03b8f \u2212 ke cos \u03b8e)1/2. To start with, we have checked that the numerical results of TDCSs for the (e, 2e) scattering of fast electrons by hydrogen atoms in their ground state are in agreement with earlier numerical data published in the literature. A very good agreement is obtained with the numerical results of TDCS for one- and two-photon exchange presented in Fig. 1 of Ref. [22] and Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. [23], under the kinematical conditions of EMS (small momentum of the residual ion q and large momentum transfers \u2206 and \u2206e), for incident electrons of kinetic energy Ei = 2013.6 eV, in a noncoplanar symmetric scattering geometry, and a LP laser of intensity 4\u00d71012 W/cm2, calculated in the low-frequency approximation at \u03c9 = 1.17 eV. At an incident electron kinetic energy Ei = 500 eV, in a coplanar symmetric geometry, \u03b5\u2016\u2206, and a LP laser of intensities I = 1.3 \u00d7 107 W/cm2, 102 \u00d7 I, 104 \u00d7 I, and 106 \u00d7 I, the behavior of the TDCS calculated from Eq. (46) is in fair agreement, up to a scaling factor, to the first-order Born calculation of TDCS for the ionization of hydrogen shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of Ref. [24]. Since the atomic wave function was calculated within the closure approximation [24], our numerical results disagree at larger photon energies \u03c9 > 3 eV where the atomic dressing effect is more important, and cannot be accurately described by this approximation. At the resonance photon energy of 10.2 eV, laser intensity of 1.3\u00d7107 W/cm2,\nand polarization \u03b5||ki, in the Ehrhardt asymmetric coplanar geometry, with the incident and ejected electrons kinetic energies Ei = 250 eV and Ee = 5 eV, and scattering angle \u03b8f = 3 \u25e6, the TDCS given by Eq. (46) is in an satisfactory agreement with the first-Born TDCS for the ionization of hydrogen plotted in Fig. 3(a) of Ref. [19] where the atomic wave function is calculated using a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. Obviously, despite the low value of the ejected electron kinetic energy, the agreement is due to the fact that for one-photon resonance the TDCS is dominated by the atomic contribution due to 1s\u2212 2p excitation. Now, we return our discussion to the scattering geometry depicted in Fig. 1 where the laser polarization, \u03b5, is parallel to the incident electron momentum direction, ki, and the outgoing electrons move asymmetrically with respect to the direction of the incident electron, with different scattering and ejected angles, and different kinetic energies. We have chosen high kinetic energies of the projectile and ejected electrons (compared to the atomic scale), moderate laser intensities below 1 TW/cm2 which correspond to electric field strengths lower than 2.7\u00d7107 V/cm, and have considered photon energies below the ionization threshold of the hydrogen atom. Specifically, a laser intensity of 1 TW/cm2 and a photon energy of 1.55 eV (Ti:sapphire laser) result in a quiver motion amplitude \u03b10 \u2243 1.64 a.u. and an argument of the ordinary Bessel function Rq \u2243 1.64|\u03b5 \u00b7 q|, while for a larger photon energy of 3.1 eV (Ti:sapphire second harmonic) the corresponding amplitude \u03b10 and the argument Rq are about 4 times smaller. The numerical results obtained for TDSCs in the first-order Born approximation in the scattering potential, Eq. (46), are compared with those obtained by considering the atomic contribution in the LFA, Eq. (36), and those obtained by neglecting the dressing of the target by setting T (1) N,d \u2243 0 and T (1) N,ex \u2243 0 in Eq. (46). In Fig. 2 we present the TDCSs as a function of the angle of the ejected electron, \u03b8e, with exchange of one photon, N = 1, at high kinetic energies of the projectile electron Ei = 2 keV and ejected electron Ee = 200 eV, and a small scattering angle, \u03b8f = 5 \u25e6. The laser intensity is I = 1 TW/cm2, while the photon energies we consider are: 1.55 eV in Fig. 2(a), 3.1 eV in Fig. 2(b), 4.65 eV in Fig. 2(c), and 9.3 eV in Fig. 2(d). Figure 3 show similar results to Fig. 2, but for a larger scattering angle \u03b8f = 15 \u25e6. In all figures the solid lines correspond to the laser-assisted TDCSs calculated from Eq. (46), which include the laser dressing effects of the projectile and of the hydrogen atom, the dot-dashed lines correspond to the TDCSs in which the atomic dressing is considered in the LFA for the direct and as well as exchange scattering, while the dashed lines correspond to the results in which\nthe atomic dressing is neglected. As resulted from our theoretical calculations, the TDCS is quite important at scattering and ejected angles where the recoil momentum q is small. Thus, at the scattering angle \u03b8f = 5 \u25e6 the angular distribution of the electrons is observed with a highest probability at the maximum values of TDCSs, which occur at the following detection angles \u03b8e \u2243 \u221261\u25e6 in Fig. 2(a), \u03b8e \u2243 \u221240\u25e6 in Fig. 2(b), \u03b8e \u2243 \u221238\u25e6 in Fig. 2(c), and \u03b8e \u2243 \u221239\u25e6 in Fig. 2(d). Similar to the free-free transitions or other laser-assisted processes [29, 30, 49], the net effect of the laser field is to decrease the peak values of the angular distributions of TDCSs, while the atomic dressing contribution is increasing with photon energy. The dressing effect of the laser is included in the argument of the Bessel function through the quiver motion amplitude, \u03b10, in the electronic transition amplitudes, Eqs. (18) and (28), as well through Rq and the factor \u03b10 \u03c9 in the atomic transition amplitudes, Eqs. (20) and (30). Thus, as the photon energy increases the atomic dressing effects (included in the full lines) are more important than the electronic dressing effects (included in the dashed lines), and the TDCS decreases as suggested by Eqs. (38), (39), and (40) derived in the low-photon energy limit. At low photon energies which are far from any atomic resonance, of 1.55 eV or even 3.1 eV at \u03b8f = 5 \u25e6, the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process depicted in Figs. 2(a)2(b) and 3(a) is well described by the LFA (dot-dashed lines), as long as the photon energy is much smaller than |E1|. A clear signature of the nonperturbative effect of the laser is the oscillatory character of the angular distribution of TDCS, as shown in Fig. 2(a) compared to Figs. 2(b)-2(d). The nonperturbative behavior, due to a larger quiver amplitude, is seen at the small photon energy of 1.55 eV (\u03b10 \u2243 1.64 a.u. and Up \u2243 0.03 eV), and resides in the occurrence of an increasing number of zeros in the Bessel functions of the first kind and, therefore, in the TDCS [20]. Thus, kinematic minima of TDCSs appear at Rq = 0 if the scalar product \u03b5 \u00b7 q = 0, condition that is fulfilled at ejected electron angles given by the relation cos \u03b8e = (ki \u2212 kf cos \u03b8f )/ke. The first two kinematical minima which are located on the left- and right-side of the main maximum in Fig. 2(a) at the photon energy of 1.55 eV, occur at the angles \u03b8e \u2243 \u221279\u25e6 and 80\u25e6, while the next minima of TDCS are due to the zeros of the Bessel function J1(Rq) with Rq 6= 0. At larger photon energies in Figs. 2(b)-2(d) the first two kinematical minima of the TDCSs occur at the angles \u03b8e \u2243 \u221279\u25e6 in Figs. 2(b)-2(d), and at \u03b8e \u2243 80\u25e6 in Fig. 2(b), \u03b8e \u2243 81\u25e6 in Fig. 2(c), and \u03b8e \u2243 83\u25e6 in Fig. 2(d).\nIn Fig. 4 we show the numerical results for TDCSs plotted in a logarithmic scale for\nN = 0, 1 and 2, at \u03c9 = 3.1 eV and the scattering angles \u03b8f = 5 \u25e6 in Fig. 4(a) and \u03b8f = 15 \u25e6\nin Fig. 4(b), with the same parameters as in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b). The angular distributions of TDCS at different N present similar features with different magnitudes, and show that the net effect of the laser field is to decrease the values of TDCSs and to split the peaks which occur at N = 0 (full lines) at \u03b8e \u2243 \u221262\u25e6 in Fig. 4(a) and \u03b8e \u2243 \u221271\u25e6 in Fig. 4(b). The splitting of the peaks by the kinematical minima, which is a well known signature of the laser field on the TDCSs, appears due to cancellation of the scalar product \u03b5 \u00b7 q and is located almost symmetrically with respect to the direction of the incident electron at the ejected angles \u03b8e \u2243 \u221279\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 in Fig. 4(a) and \u03b8e \u2243 \u221274\u25e6 and 75\u25e6 in Fig. 4(b). It is well known the projectile electron plays a major role in the scattering process since it interacts with the atomic target electron (a repulsive interaction), its nucleus (an attractive interaction), as well as with the laser field. In Fig. 5 we present the TDCSs for the ionization of hydrogen by electron impact in the presence of a LP laser field, for absorption of one photon N = 1, at a photon energy of 4.65 eV as a function of the ejected electron angle. The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is Ee = 100 eV in Fig. 5(a), 200 eV in Fig. 5(b), 400 eV in Fig. 5(c), and 800 eV in Fig. 5(d). The other parameters concerning the scattering geometry, incident projectile energy, angle of the scattered electron, and laser field intensity are the same as in Fig. 2. Figure 6 shows similar results as in Fig. 5, but for a larger scattering angle \u03b8f = 15 \u25e6. Clearly, the electronic contribution (dashed lines) underestimates the angular distribution of TDCS. For kinetic energies of the ejected electron Ee \u2264 100 eV at \u03b8f = 5\n\u25e6 and Ee \u2264 200 eV at \u03b8f = 15\u25e6, the atomic dressing effects are quite important, and the TDCS calculated in the LFA (dot-dashed lines) fails to describe accurately the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process. As the kinetic energy of the ejected electron increases to 800 eV, at small scattering angles the atomic dressing effects are less important than the electronic dressing effects, as it is shown in Figs. 5(d) and 6(d). As we approach the symmetric coplanar case of scattered and ejected electrons of equal energies, Ef \u2243 Ee \u2243 (Ei +E1 +\u03c9)/2, the minimum of the recoil momentum amplitude q occurs now at larger angles close to \u03b8f \u2243 \u2212\u03b8e \u2243 45\u25e6, Eq. (51).\nIn order clarify the importance of the atomic dressing term we illustrate in Fig. 7(a) the TDCS, in a logarithmic scale, with respect to the photon energy for one-photon absorption. The kinetic energies of the projectile and the ejected electrons are Ei = 2 keV and Ee = 200 eV, while the angles of the scattered and ejected electrons are chosen \u03b8f = 15 \u25e6 and \u03b8e = \u221255\u25e6. The polarization vector of the electric field is parallel to the momentum of the incident\nelectron, and we consider a moderate laser intensity, I = 1 TW/cm2, for which the nonperturbative dressing effects of the projectile and ejected electrons can be visualized at small photon energies with \u03b10 > 1. The solid line corresponds to the laser-assisted TDCS calculated from Eq. (46), which includes the dressing effects of the projectile and of the atomic target, the dashed line corresponds to TDCS in which the atomic dressing terms are neglected, while the dot-dashed line corresponds to the result in which the atomic dressing terms are considered in the LFA, Eq. (36). The TDCS shows a strongly dependence on the atomic structure of the target and exhibits a series of resonance peaks which are associated with one-photon absorption from the initial ground state of the hydrogen atom, at photon energies that match atomic resonances \u03c9 = En \u2212E1, and correspond to poles that occur in the atomic radial integral at \u03c4 = n, with n \u2265 2, as detailed in Fig. 7(b). The noteworthy feature of the atomic radial integral J101, Eq. (25), is that it presents poles with respect to \u03c4 which arise due to the cancellation of the 2 \u2212 \u03c4 factor in the denominator, as well as from the poles of the Appell\u2019s hypergeometric functions F1 at \u03c4 = n\n\u2032, where n\u2032 \u2265 3 is an integer. The origin of these poles resides in the poles of the Coulomb Green\u2019s functions used for the calculation of the linear-response vector w100, [35]. Clearly, the LFA, which does not take into account the atomic structure, fails to describe the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process at large photon energies (typically in the UV range). Figure 7(c) shows the energy spectra in the nonperturbative regime at low photon energies, \u03c9 \u2264 1.6 eV in Fig. 7(a), domain where at the laser intensity I = 1 TW/cm2 the quiver amplitude \u03b10 is larger than 1 a.u. and increases up to 395 a.u. for \u03c9 = 0.1 eV. The TDCS presents oscillations due to the Bessel function J1(Rq), and the LFA (dot-dashed line) gives a good description of the atomic dressing effect. It should be kept in mind that both the laser intensity and photon energy play an important role, and obviously, the nonperturbative effects are seen to be important as laser intensity increases and photon energy decreases due to increasing quiver motion of the free and bound electrons, and contribute to the oscillatory behavior of the laser-assisted TDCSs, which resides in the occurrence of increasing oscillations of the Bessel function."

            "text": "We study the electron-impact ionization of hydrogen at large projectile and ejected electron kinetic energies in the presence of a linearly polarized laser field, and investigate the\nlaser-assisted (e, 2e) reaction at moderate laser field intensities. We focus our numerical results on the case of the asymmetric coplanar scattering geometry, where we discuss the importance of the dressing effects and analyze the influence of the laser field on the TDCS in several numerical examples. The laser-assisted (e, 2e) reaction has a nonlinear character which consists in multiphoton absorption (emission) of photons from (to) laser radiation by projectile and ejected electrons and atomic target. We present a new method to calculate the atomic radial amplitude in a closed form, which represents the main difficulty in the evaluation of TDCS. Thus, a semi-perturbative approach is used, in which for the interaction of the fast incident and outgoing electrons with the laser field we employ non-perturbative Gordon-Volkov wave functions, while the interaction of the hydrogen atom with the laser field is considered in first-order TDPT, and the interaction of the fast incident electron with the hydrogen atom is treated in the first-order Born approximation. The exchange between the outgoing electrons can not be ignored when ejected electrons with large kinetic energy are detected, and is included in the calculation. Our theoretical formulas and numerical results clearly demonstrate the strong influence of the photon energy and laser intensity on the dynamics of laser-assisted (e, 2e) process. It was found that the atomic dressing contribution calculated in first-order TDPT in the laser field substantially modifies the laser-assisted TDCSs at small momenta q, \u2206, and \u2206e, and for photon energies close to resonances. The introduction of the laser field in the (e, 2e) reaction changes the profile of TDCS as it is seen in Fig. 4, where the peaks of TDCSs are reduced in magnitude and splitted by the presence of the laser, due to appearance of the kinematical minima. We show that the atomic dressing effects strongly depend on the structure of the atomic target as is seen in Fig. 7, and cannot be correctly described by the LFA at large photon energies. At low photon energies we confirm the validity of LFA by comparing the numerical results obtained for the atomic matrix elements within LFA with the results obtained by first-order TDPT. Thus, the theoretical studies remain very useful for understanding essential details of the scattering signal due to the fact that the derived analytical formulas have the advantage of giving more physical insight into the laser-assisted (e, 2e) process and valuable information in future theoretical and experimental investigations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work by G.
