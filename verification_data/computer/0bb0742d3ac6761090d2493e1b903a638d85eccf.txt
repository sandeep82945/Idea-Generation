"In response, we propose a framework that targets low-resource language (i.e., Arabic in this work). Considering the translation approach used to solve the multilingual challenges, we propose a translation dataset (OSN-MDAD) from English to multidialectal Arabic in an effort to contribute to the low-resource status [37] of multidialectal Arabic resources. Four different Arabic dialects were considered in this work: Gulf, Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine/Shami. OSN-MDAD dataset was then used for the purpose of building translation models -one for each dialect- from English to multidialectal Arabic optimized for OSN data. Our experimental results have illustrated the superior performance of our English-dialectal Arabic translations models trained using Transformer architecture -with transfer learning- compared to the performance yielded by the sequence-to-sequence with attention mechanism -from scratch-, using our proposed translation dataset. We believe that this study contributes to the research community by providing a high-quality benchmark Arabic multidialectal translation dataset that can be used by researchers to learn from and benchmark against and also extend upon in future related tasks. Another contribution of this work is the proposed guideline framework for constructing contextual translation datasets. Some of the instructions were customized to fit the purpose of this study; however, they could be customized to fit other problems of interest. The proposed guidelines were carefully studied, developed, and considered after rounds of expert consultations."
