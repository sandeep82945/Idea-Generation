conclusions and future work We showed that our Sim2Real approach improves FN+INC64 performance on our dynamic FER task by 11- 18%, up to 94% on our internal test dataset, and up to 75% on a previously unseen dataset, compared to the performance of the same model architecture without synthetic training data. This performance was achieved by mixed synthetic and real data training. Additionally, it was shown that the proposed FN+INC model along with our Sim2Real approach is less sensitive to dataset ethnicity bias.
