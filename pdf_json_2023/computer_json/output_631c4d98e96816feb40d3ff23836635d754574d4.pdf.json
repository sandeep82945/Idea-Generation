    "abstractText": "Population health monitoring based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an important application trend healthcare improvement. This work aims to develop an autonomous network architecture, collecting sensor data with a cluster topology, forwarding information through relay nodes, and applying edge computing and transmission scheduling for network scalability and operational efficiency. The proposed distributed network architecture incorporates data compression technologies and effective scheduling algorithms for handling the transmission scheduling of various physiological signals. Compared to existing scheduling mechanisms, the experimental results depict the network performance and show that in analyzing the delay and jitter, the proposed WFQ-based algorithms have reduced the delay and jitter ratio by about 40% and 19.47% compared to LLQ with priority queueing scheme, respectively. The experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed network topology is more effective than the direct path transmission approach in terms of energy consumption, which suggests that the proposed network architecture may improve the development of medical applications with body area networks such that the goal of self-organizing population health monitoring can be achieved.",

            "text": "Considering the current risk of pandemics, real-time demand for multi-access medical monitoring, information mining, and effective disease diagnosis, group health monitoring implemented with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will be an important application trend for improving health care in the future. Due to the extensive use of wireless communication technologies, the Internet of Things can seamlessly and transparently incorporate more heterogeneous smart devices or end devices. However, for IoMT applications that require higher accuracy, real-time response, and robustness, cloud-based architectures may cause adverse effects in case of network failure or insufficient bandwidth, which may lead to medical emergencies. Therefore, by collecting and analyzing data at the network edge, we may improve network performance and reliability (e.g., with greater operation flexibility, lower latency, energy consumption, and location awareness) for decentralized healthcare applications. With the development of medical embedded systems and telemedicine technologies, the demands for storing and transmitting physiological signals are increasing. However, the process of real-time monitoring or group monitoring leads to the generation of large amounts of physiological signals. One solution to deal with this scenario is the use of data compression techniques, which conserves signal storage space and facilitates transmission,\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23208553 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 2 of 23\nreception, and processing of the data. Currently, many effective data compression methods for physiological signals are widely used. Data compression methods are classified into three types [1]: (a) direct data compression method, (b) transformational data compression methods, and (c) parameter extraction-based data compression methods [2]. Among these three categories, transform based data compression is always preferred, because these techniques provide efficient results in terms of CR and signal reconstruction [3]. In these categories, the signal is first transformed from one domain (mostly time domain) to the other domain and then rejection of irrelevant coefficients is performed. The examples of transformed-based techniques are: sine transform, Fourier transform (FT), cosine transform, wavelet transform (WT), etc. Since the wavelet transform is useful to locate and analyze the non-stationary physiological signals (e.g., electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG)) in both time and frequency domains, it is applied for data compression of physiological signals in this work. Data gathering is a critical process, which includes protocols and scheduling strategies to fulfill the network requirements (e.g., increased lifetime, reliability, and self-configuration). Scheduling is a process by which the system determines which task should be executed at the given time, and thus achieves load balancing and efficient system resource allocation. However, improper scheduling algorithms may waste transmission resources or lead to performance degradation (e.g., packet collisions). To organize the time constraints of multiple data forwarding tasks, these tasks need to be carefully arranged to adjust the load well between sensors. Many queue scheduling algorithms have been proposed, where weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is one of the widely used scheduling algorithms due to its fair bandwidth allocation and traffic prioritization capabilities. Besides considering the scheduling schemes, to conserve limited energy resources, aggregate information from individual sensor nodes, and further provide network scalability and robustness, in this paper, sensor nodes are grouped into clusters, where network topology management is performed by setting weights and countdown timers between sensors, clusterhead (CH), inter-clusterhead (inter-CH), relay and base station through a hierarchical clustering approach. The data size, priority, and transmission scheduling of various physiological signals are also considered, the data are compressed at the network edge and the transmission bandwidth of each physiological signal is assigned through a scheduling algorithm. The proposed method ensures data transmission frequency and quality of service for different types of physiological signals, as well as simplifies data transmission traffic and improves data transmission efficiency. The proposed scheduling method can simplify the data transmission traffic and increase the data transmission efficiency. The major contributions and key features of this paper are: (1) explore the architecture of the group health monitoring system on basis of the relay-based wireless body area network (WBAN); (2) address routing and relay selection schemes for the proposed architecture; (3) devise the specific health monitoring architecture based on the IoMT, considering signal prioritization and transmission scheduling through the hierarchical clustering method to organize sensors by setting weights, and applying data compression techniques at the network edge. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related works. Section 3 explains the functionality and operation of the proposed clustering methods, compression technique, and scheduling algorithms. Section 4 presents the experiment scenario and analyzes the experiment results. Section 5 draws conclusions and future work."

An energy-efficient and delay-aware path allocation algorithm is developed for normal data, performing the selection of optimal and shortest paths. Then, a data on-demand algorithm is derived for on-demand data dissemination. Finally, criticalities detection algorithms are developed for\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 4 of 23\nmeasuring criticalities of vital signs and allocation of adaptive and energy-efficient paths on the priority basis. Yazdi et al. [15] propose a priority-based MAC protocol for transmitting normal data, periodic data, and emergency data in wireless body area networks. This MAC design aims to guarantee energy consumption and delay reduction with traffic prioritization and classification for achieving the desired performance. To avoid data losses and reduce dissemination time with the priority-based data, Alsiddiky, et al. [16] present the selective decision modes (i.e., congestion mitigation and perfect queuing modes) for achieving successful data delivery. Depending on the rate of congestion and priority of the data sensed, transmission is balanced using queuing or delivery as modeled in the decision mode. For real-time remote monitoring of the patient, Elshahed et al. [17] propose a new task scheduling and allocation technique for healthcare monitoring implemented in IoT cloud-based architecture. The proposed technique performs a prioritized sorted task-based allocation scheme for selecting the best virtual machine to execute the health task, solving the problem of delay, missed tasks, and failure rate, and the guarantee ratio. Besides the notable scheduling techniques, the genetic algorithm (GA), a metaheuristic approach that deals with the foundations of hereditary qualities and regular determination, is applied for scheduling in IoMT applications. Hussain [18] puts forth the significance of scheduling management and the application of AI in the IoMT-cloud environment. Singh et al.

            "text": "In WSNs, data transfer from the source node to the destination is carried out through several intermediate nodes, so each node may have multiple data packets stored in it. However, depending on the application requirement, it can be categorized into several types of packets (e.g., real-time or non-real-time transmissions). Justu [20] proposes a data scheduling technique based on latency and loss constraint, where the input data are prioritized with latency and loss constraint conditions, and data with high priority are scheduled based on data priority, which guarantees that high-priority data are delivered instantly. The increasing number of real-time applications makes the requirements for network traffic and bandwidth management critical. Bahaweres [21] describes a fair queuing with the scheduling of Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) and Low Latency Queueing (LLQ), which divides the available bandwidth across queues of traffic based on weights to ensure that the important traffic receives a higher priority than the less important traffic. To evaluate the performance of queueing management, several parameters (e.g., the amount of traffic, type of traffic, services with mixed traffic, and the number of queues on the router) are analyzed for the following queuing mechanisms [22]: First-In First-Out (FIFO), Custom Queuing (CQ), Priority Queuing (PQ), Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ), and Low Latency Queuing (LLQ). The study of [23] investigates the following scheduling algorithms: Round Robin (RR), Strict Priority (SP), Weighted Fair (WF), and Weighted Round Robin (WRR). Note that each queuing algorithm has its advantages when handling certain types of traffic. Network performance metrics (i.e., throughput and endpoint latency) and queuing metrics (i.e., peak queue size, average queue length, average queue time, and total packet loss) can be applied to evaluate the performance of scheduling algorithms. Moreover, given the growth and demand for smart networks and intelligent devices, Quality of Service (QoS) is considered as an important parameter to support data quality in IoT. Three queuing algorithms such as FIFO, PQ, and WFQ are analyzed and compared by using a QoS mechanism to control and observe the congestion in the IoT network [24]. A scalable load business flow model is performed and analyzed in [25]. The algorithm can be used to flexibly adjust the queue weights according to the real-time metrics monitored by the network to ensure the quality of service of various disaster recovery services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 5 of 23\nTables 1 and 2 summarize the characteristics, features, strengths, and weaknesses of the above-mentioned queueing algorithms."

Dataset Description\nFor healthcare professionals and patients, the long-term monitoring of physiological signals is beneficial to the rational assessment of health status and disease evolution. As we know, physiological signals reflect the electrical activity of a specific body part and\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 7 of 23\nprovide valuable information about mood, cognition, and many other health issues, thus any deviation from the norm in patterns may indicate an underlying health problem. For instance, arrhythmias can be picked up by ECG signals while epilepsy, which is a common neurological disorder, manifests itself as abnormalities in EEG signals during epileptic seizure. Monitoring and analyzing these physiological signals form the basis of biomedical devices used for the diagnosis, detection, and treatment of various diseases [30]. Moreover, in recent years, stress and mental health have been considered as important worldwide concerns. Stress detection using physiological signals such as ECG, EMG, and EEG is a traditional approach [31]. Therefore, three critical physiological signals are selected, namely ECG, EEG, and EMG.\n\u2022 ECG: Since cardiovascular diseases may lead to sudden cardiac arrest or even death and are difficult for patients to detect and handle them effectively in time, it is necessary to monitor the ECG signal in real-time to prevent this situation. Here, we apply the MIT-BIH dataset as one of the input data, which is publicly available at PhysioNet [32]. The dataset provides data collected from 48 patients with recordings of 30 min each. The recordings are digitized at 360 samples per second per channel with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range. \u2022 EEG: Many studies have shown that patients with head trauma or cerebrovascular disease can be managed effectively with continuous EEG monitoring, and there is also a lot of usage of EEG data analysis for effective diagnosis of certain diseases such as epilepsy. This work applies the EEGLAB dataset [33], which uses a single structure to store data, acquisition parameters, events, channel locations, and epoch information. The sample dataset consists of 32 channels, and the sampling frequency is 128 Hz. Channel 1 (FP1) and channel 2 (FP2) in the frontal area are adopted as inputs, which are commonly used for EEG analysis. \u2022 EMG: Depending on the position of the patch, the collected EMG data can be used for different applications. The EMG dataset in bio-signals Repository [34] is used to control the prosthesis movements. The required finger movements are performed through 8 participants with ten categories of individual and combined finger movements (e.g., thumb, index, middle, ring, little, thumb-index, thumb-middle, thumb-ring, thumblittle, and hand-close finger movements). The data were collected using two EMG channels and the sample rate is 450 Hz. In this work, the hand-close dataset is selected as the EMG signal input.\n3.2.2. Data Preprocessing\nFor physiological signals, the signal clarity is extremely important. However, most of these physiological signals are non-stationary or non-linear, and during the data acquisition process, the signals are easily contaminated by noise. Therefore, the signal quality needs to be improved by preprocessing to remove noise to ensure the accuracy of medical analysis and diagnosis. With the characteristics of time and frequency domain analysis, in this work, wavelet transform (WT) is applied to decompose a signal into several scales with various frequency bands. At each scale, the signal\u2019s instantaneous structures can be determined approximately, which are available for denoising. Due to the increased amount of data and transmission power consumption with long-time monitoring, a data compression technique is essential, which achieves effective processing of physiological information, reduces the transmission load, and shortens the communication time. Since most of the physiological signals are non-stationary, the analysis method should not only have good resolution in the frequency domain, but also needs to have to localize signals in time domain. Based on the requirement, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a wavelet transformation in which wavelets are discretely sampled, and it captures both frequency and position information of time such that the signal is approximately decomposed with detailed coefficients at each level through a process of low pass filtering, high pass filtering, and soft threshold function, respectively [35\u201340]. For the denoised ECG, the wavelet basis function is db5 wavelet and the decomposition\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 8 of 23\narchitecture is five-layer; db5 wavelet and three-layer decomposition are used to decompose EEG signals; EMG signals use db6 wavelet and three-layer decomposition for signal decomposition. Figure 3 illustrates the compression structure with WT. Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 23\nFigure 3. Structure of compression with wavelet transform.\n3.3. Priority-Based Clustering Scheme In consideration of reducing the demand for medical services by keeping people healthy, monitoring of health parameters is likely to become necessary to solve this problem. In recent years, many sensor networks have been integrated with health monitoring to provide medical staff with a more efficient and extensive management approach, reducing nursing workload and providing patients with a clearer understanding of their current physical status. In this section, we focus on the network structure of group health monitoring in wards. The clustering algorithm is referenced from [41]. The network topology is formed into three phases: (1) Phase 1: clustering and selecting inter-CH, (2) Phase 2: CHs and inter-CHs scheduling and management, and (3) Phase 3: inter-CHs and relay scheduling and management. Figure 4 shows a scenario of our implementation, where there are three levels of patients depending on their severity and it is assumed the relay nodes and base station are fixed.\nFigure 4.

Accordingly, based on the neighboring network density and patient\u2019s priority information, we may set the initial random waiting timer from the distribution \u03b2\u00b7WT(0)i + \u03b1 [42].

There is a situation in which multiple patients of the same priority may be in the same ward, so the RSSI value of the device and the relay, \u03b2, is a critical parameter of the formula that the one closer to the relay will count down faster.

Each queue follows the First in First out (FIFO) principle and is sent according to the order of joining the queue. At the time of queueing, WFQ allocates the bandwidth of each flow according to the weight of the flow, which ensures fairness between the flow of the same priority and expresses the weighting between the flows of different priorities. Last, polling each queue and the corresponding number of packets are sent from the queue according to the bandwidth calculation as follows: \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udc64\u2211 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc45 (2) where N is the total number of queues, R is the bandwidth of link, and \ud835\udc64 is the weight of each queue, the queue of number j will achieve the corresponding bandwidth \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4a\nith the calculation. As shown in Figure 12, the physiological signals are placed in their corresponding queues acc rding to their types, where the weight of each queue is 5, 3, and 2, respectively.

At the beginning, the number of inter-cluster members is zero. Each CH updates their neighbor information (i.e., a counter specifying how many neighbors it has detected) and decrease the random waiting time based on each new priority message received. Note that the nodes that hear many neighboring CHs are good candidates for initiating a new inter-cluster; those with few neighbors should choose to wait. When the timer of a CH expires, the CH becomes an inter-CH and broadcasts an address to its neighboring CHs.

The queuing delay of a packet will depend on the number of packets that have arrived first or are waiting for transmission to the link. In this experiment, we use three physiological signals as inputs, ECG, EEG, and EMG, and the link bandwidth is 250 Kbps. To assess the proposed algorithms, Figure 19 shows the comparison of the Low Latency Queueing (LLQ) algorithm [21] and the proposed schemes, which describes the average time in the queueing process at the CH for different scheduling algorithms.

Observe that the WFQ_TP algorithm has better results than other algorithms in reducing the transmission jitter.\nMonitoring\nTime (s) PQ WFQ_RR WFQ_RRE WFQ_TE WFQ_TPE WFQ_TP\n1 0.041 0.036 0.034 0.033 0.034 0.032 2 0.042 0.035 0.035 0.032 0.033 0.031 3 0.044 0.036 0.035 0.034 0.035 0.033 4 0.042 0.037 0.037 0.035 0.037 0.037 5 0.048 0.040 0.039 0.037 0.038 0.037 6 0.052 0.043 0.038 0.034 0.034 0.036 7 0.048 0.044 0.041 0.039 0.035 0.039 8 0.049 0.041 0.042 0.040 0.041 0.041 9 0.053 0.039 0.043 0.044 0.042 0.041\n10 0.054 0.038 0.037 0.043 0.042 0.044 11 0.056 0.042 0.039 0.041 0.038 0.038 12 0.052 0.043 0.044 0.041 0.041 0.040 13 0.051 0.046 0.045 0.042 0.043 0.043 14 0.055 0.045 0.046 0.046 0.044 0.042 15 0.057 0.046 0.045 0.046 0.045 0.044\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 19 of 23\nRegarding the delay and jitter of WFQ-based scheduling approaches, Table 6 shows the average delay and average standard deviation of service delay of the LLQ [21] and the proposed WFQ-based algorithms.

As shown in Figure 20, the longer the monitoring time, the more data will be generated, thus resulting in a longer delay.\nThis set of experiments explores and compares the energy consumption between the proposed clustering scheme and the direct path scheme (i.e., sensed data are forwarded directly to BS in the single-hop communication). Referring to the energy model in [44], the energy consumptions of transmission and reception are:\nETx = {\nkEelec + k\u03b5 f sd2, d \u2264 d0 kEelec + k\u03b5mpd4, d > d0\n(7)\nERx = kEelec (8)\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 20 of 23\nEFusion = M\u00b7Eelec (9)\nwhere Eelec is the energy consumed for sending one bit, and \u03b5 f s and \u03b5mp are, respectively, the amplification coefficients in free space and multipath environments. Given Eelec = 50 \u00b5J/bit [3.5 mA (on the idle state of the raspberry pi) \u00d7 5V \u00d7 29 \u00b5 (s/bit)], \u03b5 f s = 100 pJ/m2, \u03b5mp = 0.0013 pJ/m4, d0 = \u221a \u03b5 f s/\u03b5ms, the packet size k = 6350 bytes. Given that the distance\nbetween the inter-CH and the CH is two meters and the distance between the inter-CH and relay is one meter, the following results show that the proposed clustering scheme achieves lower energy consumption compared with the direct path scheme (Table 7). As the monitoring time of physiological signals increases, the energy consumption of the transmission also increases. Compared to transmitting all nodes directly to a relay node, the clustering scheme can be more effective in reducing transmission delay and energy consumption for fields with a large number of nodes or a larger amount of data.\nIn this work, we investigate the energy consumption of the proposed topology scheme with compressed data, comparing to that of the direct path scenario, as shown in Table 7. Moreover, according to the energy saved by compressing data and the energy consumption for running data compression algorithms in edge devices, the net energy income obtained by running an algorithm to compress given data is further examined. Referring to the analysis in [45], we have\nEnet = Etxuncmp\u2212Etotalcmp = Etxuncmp\u2212 ( Etxcmp+E alg cmp ) = (CR \u2212 1)Etxcmp \u2212 E alg cmp (10)\nwhere Enet is the net energy income obtained by running a data compression algorithm, which is the difference between Etxuncmp and Etotalcmp , Etxuncmp is the energy consumption for transmitting the raw data, Etotalcmp is the total energy consumption for compressing data E alg cmp and transmitting the compressed data Etxcmp, and CR is the compression rate as described in Equation (4). In the future, we plan to investigate the necessary condition of energy saving, considering the tradeoff among the compression rate CR, the energy consumption for communication and algorithm execution, such that energy conservation can be achieved."

            "text": "This paper simultaneously considers signal prioritization and transmission scheduling through the hierarchical clustering method to organize sensors by setting weights and applying data compression techniques at the network edge, which reduces the amount of data transmission. The proposed scheduling algorithm assigns weights according to the physiological signal types and schedules the data to allocate the corresponding transmission bandwidth for ensuring the priority service of critical data. Through the experimental results and evaluation of the existing scheduling mechanisms, the proposed network topology management scheme is shown to achieve the goal of self-organized population health monitoring for IoMT applications. In future work, we are planning to apply the proposed IoMT architecture to possible applications for group health monitoring (e.g., disaster rescue task, fall detection system, or crowd supervision for a group of hikers), determine an efficient tradeoff between compression and data collection to improve the effectiveness of the system design, tackle data security issues in data processing, and further\nSensors 2023, 23, 8553 21 of 23\nintegrate the data of key physiological signals with the relationship between the lesion site and severity for establishing a more comprehensive prioritization scheme.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.-M.T., P.-F.C. and C.-Y.W.; Formal analysis, L.-M.T. and P.-F.C.; Funding acquisition, C.-Y.W.; Methodology, L.-M.T., P.-F.C. and C.-Y.W.; Supervision, C.-Y.W.; Visualization, L.-M.T. and P.-F.C.; Writing\u2014original draft, L.-M.T. and P.-F.C.; Writing\u2014review and editing, C.-Y.W.
