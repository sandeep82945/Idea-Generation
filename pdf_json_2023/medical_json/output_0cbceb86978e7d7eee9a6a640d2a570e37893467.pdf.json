    "abstractText": "Gas flooding through the injection of CO 2 is generally performed to achieve optimum oil recovery from underground hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, miscible flooding, which is the most efficient way to achieve maximum oil recovery, is not suitable for all reservoirs due to challenge in maintaining pressure conditions. In this circumstances, a near\u2010miscible process may be more practical. This study focuses on pore\u2010scale near\u2010miscible CO 2 \u2013Oil displacement, using available literature criteria to determine the effective near\u2010miscible region. For the first time, two separate numerical approaches are coupled to examine the behavior of CO 2 \u2013oil at the lower\u2010pressure boundary of the specified region. The first one, the Phase\u2010field module, was implemented to trace the movement of fluids in the displacement CO 2 \u2013Oil process by applying the Navier\u2013Stokes equation. Next is the TDS module which incorporates the effect of CO 2 mass transfer into the oil phase by coupling classical Fick\u2019s law to the fluids interface to track the variation of CO 2 diffusion coefficient. To better recognize the oil recovery mechanism in pore\u2010scale, qualitative analysis indicates that interface is moved into the by\u2010passed oil due to low interfacial tension in the near\u2010miscible region. Moreover, behind the front ahead of the main flow stream, the CO 2 phase can significantly displace almost all the bypassed oil in normal pores and effectively decrease the large amounts in small pores. The results show that by incorporating mass transfer and capillary cross\u2010flow mechanisms in the simulations, the displacement of by\u2010passed oil in pores can be significantly improved, leading to an increase in oil recovery from 92 to over 98%, which is comparable to the result of miscible gas injection. The outcome of this research emphasizes the significance of applying the CO 2 \u2010EOR process under near\u2010miscible operating conditions.",

However, miscible flooding, which is the most efficient way to achieve maximum oil recovery, is not suitable for all reservoirs due to challenge in maintaining pressure conditions. In this circumstances, a near\u2011miscible process may be more practical. This study focuses on pore\u2011scale near\u2011miscible CO\n2 \u2013Oil displacement, using available literature criteria to\ndetermine the effective near\u2011miscible region. For the first time, two separate numerical approaches are coupled to examine the behavior of CO\n2 \u2013oil at the lower\u2011pressure boundary of the specified\nregion. The first one, the Phase\u2011field module, was implemented to trace the movement of fluids in the displacement CO\n2 \u2013Oil process by applying the Navier\u2013Stokes equation. Next is the TDS module which\nincorporates the effect of CO 2 mass transfer into the oil phase by coupling classical Fick\u2019s law to the fluids interface to track the variation of CO 2 diffusion coefficient. To better recognize the oil recovery mechanism in pore\u2011scale, qualitative analysis indicates that interface is moved into the by\u2011passed oil due to low interfacial tension in the near\u2011miscible region. Moreover, behind the front ahead of the main flow stream, the CO\n2 phase can significantly displace almost all the bypassed oil in normal pores\nand effectively decrease the large amounts in small pores. The results show that by incorporating mass transfer and capillary cross\u2011flow mechanisms in the simulations, the displacement of by\u2011passed oil in pores can be significantly improved, leading to an increase in oil recovery from 92 to over 98%, which is comparable to the result of miscible gas injection. The outcome of this research emphasizes the significance of applying the CO\n2 \u2011EOR process under near\u2011miscible operating conditions."

While CO2-based EOR can improve oil recovery by reducing oil viscosity and decreasing mobility of CO2 , it is of paramount importance for reducing gas emissions and carbon storage and CO2 sequestration applications as well8\u201310.\u00a0Moreover, recently geological CO2 capture and storage of flue gas in hydrate reservoirs have been investigated by putting a significant amount of CO2 underground for tonnes of hydrocarbon (methane) produced which is in the same vein as the studies to achieve net zero11,12.\nMoreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented to investigate the effect of seven reservoir parameters, namely reservoir porosity, horizontal permeability, temperature, formation stress, the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability, capillary pressure, and residual gas saturation on geological CO2 storage capacity.\nNote that the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability or anisotropy ratio is paid attention to which the results are as follows.\nThe sensitivity of the factors affecting the gas capture capacity of CO2 decreases in the order of formation stress, temperature, residual gas saturation, horizontal permeability, and porosity13.\nIn this regard, another study was carried out by combining a comprehensive large-scale 3D reservoir simulation by running single-porosity, dual-permeability, dual-porosity models and a computation-efficient DACE technique (\"Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments\") to analyze the sensitivity of CO2 storage in fractured aquifers.\nThe dynamic model\u00a0comprehensively simulated CO2 storage performance in aquifers by considering all\u00a0trapping mechanisms\u00a0except for mineralization, such as structural, dissolution, residual, and local capillary trapping.\nThe major outcome of this study demonstrate that fractures play a negative role on CO2 trapping. Thus, it is necessary to create dual permeability/dual-porosity models to generate realistic prediction14.\nIn contrast to Continuous Gas Injection (CGI) and Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection methods, GasAssisted Gravity Drainage (GAGD) relies on the natural separation of reservoir fluids to achieve stable oil displacement through gravity. The process involves injecting gas through vertical wells to create a gas cap that allows oil and water to drain down to horizontal producers, resulting in improved oil recovery. The CO2-GAGD process have been payed more attention in recent years. Consequently, several studies have been performed as immiscible injection modes were used to implement the CO2-GAGD process and enhance oil recovery in a specific section of the main pay/upper sandstone member in the South Rumaila oil field in Iraq. To optimize future oil recovery via the CO2-GAGD process, Design of Experiments (DoE) and Proxy Modeling techniques were employed via Equation of state compositional field/Reservoir Simulation15\u201319.\nTo optimize and evaluate CO2 injection process, it is crucial to understand CO2\u2013oil flow behavior in porous media.\nThere have been studies on the sensitivity analysis of effective parameters on CO2\u2013Oil flow behavior and the corresponding rate of production.\nRecent studies by Al-Mudhafar et\u00a0al. have discussed this issue, investigating the weight of sensitivity analysis on three reservoir parameters, namely porosity, permeability (vertical), and anisotropy ratio of permeability. The results show that permeability is the most important parameter in all reservoir layers. Although anisotropy ratio moderately influences the production layers, especially the water zone, the effect has been absent in transition and injection layers of the reservoir. In the CO2-GAGD gas injection process, porosity has not influenced oil recovery in all reservoir layers20\u201322.\nThere has been a lot of arguments in the literature on the promising effect of miscibility and near-miscibility conditions during CO2 flooding23\u201325. However, fully miscible flooding is considered a very expensive and difficult approach in terms of economic and operational standpoints due to high costs of providing rich gas injectant and reaching high-pressure injection condition. Additionally, it might not lead to proper additional oil recovery improvement in comparison with near-miscible condition.\nMoreover, to improve the productivity of a (single) well, another study investigated the effect of miscible gas injection with geomechanical effects in tight reservoirs during CO2-prepad injection before hydraulic fracturing.\nThe results show that among these parameters, bottom-hole flow pressure, reservoir thickness, and fracture conductivity had the greatest effect on cumulative production. Although bottom-hole flow pressure and fracture\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:12632 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39706-1\nconductivity are controllable factors, bottom-hole flow pressure (which can be adjusted and manipulated) is the most influential parameter.\nTherefore, generally CO2 near-miscible flooding is preferred as a more feasible alternative way26\u201329. An injection of near-miscible gas consists of injecting gases that do not develop complete miscibility with the oil, but are rather close to it30. Bui et\u00a0al. showed that at near miscible conditions, oil extraction in not the only mechanism of mass transfer between hydrocarbon components and CO2 . They illustrated that the viscosity reduction of oil phase due to dissolving CO2 into oil phase also dramatically contributes to additional recovery factor as the extraction mechanism31. There have been several works in the literature to predict a reasonable pressure interval for CO2 near-miscible displacement32\u201334. Very recently, Chen et.al introduced some empirical correlations to predict minimum miscibility pressure and the effective near miscible pressure region for both pure and impure CO2 injection projects which can be applicable to every specific reservoir. Hence, the region is defined from lower limit as 0.87 MMP to upper limit as 1.07 MMP. This work can provide a practical tool for characterizing near-miscible region and designing future near-miscible CO2 floods35. 34, most of the researches in the literature generally investigate CO2\u2013Oil displacement on core-scale and field-scale works and there are a few studies in the literature that focus on pore-scale investigation of CO2\u2013oil complex behavior at different conditions. Pore-scale studies are considered robust approaches for visualization of fluids displacement mechanisms, characterizing micro-scale fluid\u2013fluid and fluid/rock interactions, and analyzing fluids distribution profiles with respect to effective forces at micro-scale36\u201339. In this regard, Huang et\u00a0al. evaluated CO2 exsolution in CO2 huffn-puff procedure for EOR and CO2 storage applications. They showed that initial state of near-miscible CO2\u2013oil would lead to intense CO2\u00a0nucleation. They also emphasized that presence of water can increase CO2 saturation in the system to 95% regardless of the wettability40. Seyyedi et\u00a0al. investigated multi-phase flow of CO2-water\u2013oil system in a high-pressure micro-model at near-miscible condition. They indicated that despite low sweep efficiency of CO2\u2013Oil displacement at initial stages of injection due to high CO2 mobility, the diffusion of CO2 into the oil phase can cause capillary crossflow across the trapped oil and improve the recovery factor after breakthrough time. Their obtained results illustrates the importance of CO2 diffusion at near-miscible CO2 floods41. Zhu et\u00a0al. studied the drainage process of CO2\u2013oil system in an oil-wet porous media using phase-field interfacing capturing method. By performing wide range of sensitivity analysis over gravity number, capillary number and viscosity ratios, they depicted that viscous force is the dominant mechanism during CO2-EOR procedure, and when viscous force is small, gravity fingers improve the sweep efficiency of CO2\u2013oil displacement. They also illustrated that after CO2 breakthrough, the pressure in the main CO2 flow path dramatically decreases, and the oil phase to re-flows into large pores previously occupied by CO242. Ma et\u00a0al., recently performed a numerical study on immiscible, near-miscible and miscible flooding using different approaches. Their results indicated that while near-miscible flooding is more favorable in terms of sweep efficiency compared to immiscible flooding, it is still not able to displace oil in smaller pore throats. They expressed that CO2 diffusivity effect is negligible during miscible flooding. It is worth mentioning that in their work, mas transfer mechanism is completely ignored for near-miscible flooding, and interfacial tension is assumed to be constant during the whole simulations43.\nIn the current study, we exclusively focus on pore-scale near-miscible CO2 flooding and investigate the behavior of CO2\u2013oil flow at different pressures in near-miscible pressure interval since this interval is more economically and operationally demanding. At first, minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) and lower pressure boundary limit was calculated for the presented system to characterize the effective near-miscible flooding region where interfacial tension between oil and CO2 has not fully disappeared and near miscible effects associated with CO2 flooding is dominant35. Then a sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the oil recovery factor at two different pressures in effective near-miscible region. The novelty of the current work lies in incorporating CO2\u2013oil mas transfer at the interface to further characterize the important near miscible mechanism including oil condensation/vaporization. For the first time, to model the movement of fluids in the displacement CO2\u2013Oil process by applying Navier\u2013Stokes equation and incorporating the effect of mass transfer at the interface of two fluids and the diffusion of carbon dioxide into oil by implementing classical Fick\u2019s law, the phase field and TDS modules respectively and simultaneously have been coupled with each other in pore scale studies. Additionally, dynamic interfacial tension (IFT) and diffusion coefficient variation is studied to understand the effect of pressure gradient on diffusive interface parameters in a CO2-flooding system. The obtained results demonstrate the significance of CO2 mass transfer in near-miscible floods along which cannot be ignored. The current research also proposes an optimum criterion in designing CO2 near miscible flooding which can be helpful in CO2-EOR application.\nThe main parts of the introduction section are presented concisely and separately in Table\u00a01 based on the topic they have addressed to easily follow the underlying logic in this section."

The driving forces for transport can be diffusion by Fick\u2019s law, convection when coupled to a flow field, and migration, when coupled to an electric field44.\nGoverning equations, numerical scheme and computational geometry are described in the following section.\nModel geometry. The computational domain in this study is a heterogenous porous media with dimension of 6330\u00d7 4379 \u00b5m which consists of several circular-shape grains with a diameter of 350\u00b5m43. In this model, the diameters of twenty random grains are either reduced or enlarged by 5% to include heterogeneity effect. The green color grains are the grains with reduced diameter and the grey grains represent the enlarged ones (Fig.\u00a01a). Figure\u00a01b also illustrates the distribution of pore sizes in the selected porous media. The detailed characteristics of the simulated domain are further elaborated in Table\u00a02.\nBoundary conditions and initial values. In an attempt of modelling near-miscible flooding condition throughout the whole computational space, the displacing CO2 phase will be injected into the medium, which had previously been saturated with oil, with constant pressure of Pinj , from the left-hand side. The pressure on the right-hand side of the porous medium will be set on Pout , as well. In this study, the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) and the lower boundary of effective near-miscibility pressure zone are assessed from empirical equation to be equal to 12.7\u00a0MPa and 11.05\u00a0MPa, respectively35. Accordingly, the Pinj and Pout were set on the values of 11.05 + \u03b5\u00a0MPa and 11.05\u00a0MPa, respectively. It is noteworthy to mention, the initial pressure of the system Pinit was set to the value of 11.05\u00a0MPa (lower limit of effective near-miscible region). The pressure difference between the inlet and outlet should be small enough to provide a sensible two-phase flow/displacement in the pore scale. The parameter \u025b is set to 600\u00a0Pa (\u223c= 0.1Psi) , accordingly. The opted value for \u03b5 is consistent with the dimensions of the system, with pressure drop of 1 Psi, as well as Danesh et\u00a0al. study on near-miscible injection of methane gas in decane model oil in a lab micromodel28. As a result, one can compare the results of the aforementioned system with commercial EOR/IOR flooding program designs. The wetted wall boundary condition is selected on the particle grain surfaces with a constant contact angle (\u03b8 = \u03c0\n6 ).\nGoverning equations. The flow regime is assumed to be laminar while the fluids are supposed to be Newtonian and incompressible. Gravity is neglected and the fluids displacement will be investigated at 2D scale.\nIn order to separate two phases by a fluid\u2013fluid diffusive interface, Cahn\u2013Hilliard phase-field method45 coupled with Navier\u2013Stokes and continuity equations were employed. In phase-field model, which is based on the minimum of free energy principle, Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation is implemented to calculate the mixing energy46,47:\nThe minimization of the gradient component (first term on the left-hand side) leads to the phases mixing, and the minimization of double well potential (the second term on the right-hand side) causes phase separation.\nUnitless phase-field parameter (\u03d5) is used to determine the relative concentration of each phase. In this regard, \u22121 < \u03d5 < 1 depicts the interface area and \u03d5 = \u00b11 illustrates the pure phases. The volume fraction of phases is then described by (1+ \u03d5)/2 and (1\u2212 \u03d5)/2 equations which define the fluid properties in the system48,49.\n(1)fmix(\u03d5,\u2207\u03d5) = 1\n2 |\u2207\u03d5|2 + 4\u03b52 (\u03d52 \u2212 1)2\nTable 1.

As the result, to incorporate the CO2\u2013oil mass transfer and cross over flow at the interface, classical Fick\u2019s law was implemented51.

The auxiliary parameter \u03c8 decomposes the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation into two separate equations. \u03b3 denotes the mobility parameter, \u03b5 defines the thickness of the interface, and is the mixing energy density.

The Eq.\u00a0(7) represents the no slip condition. The Eqs.\u00a0(8) and (9) correspond to zero diffusive flux and change of total free energy on the surface respectively48,52.\nVariation of diffusive interface and fluid properties. The fluids properties of the CO2 and Oil phases at specific temperature is represented in Table\u00a03:\nThe data of fluid density and viscosity are cited from http:// webbo ok. nist. gov/ chemi stry/ fluid/. Gradually, by dissolving CO2 moles into oil phase due to mass transfer effect, the properties of oil phase will be changed. The density and viscosity variation of the oil phase is calculated as a function of the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the oil. Moreover, for the first time, dynamic variation is taken into account for interfacial tension and diffusivity coefficient as a function of pressure. All the corresponding correlations and explanations are presented in the Supporting information (section\u00a0A).\nMesh selection and numerical scheme. Triangular elements were used to resolve the domain. Finer mesh elements were selected for narrow channels and small pore throats while the coarser elements were used for pore bodies. To increase the accuracy of the model, at least 2 elements were used in narrowest throats.\nThe related curves to the mesh independency based on case 1 as shown in the Fig.\u00a02 is presented to predict the oil recovery coefficient (Fig.\u00a03).\nThe recovery results change by increasing the number of meshes from 86,287 elements (in our study/fine mesh) to 107,419 (extra fine mesh) elements by only 2% and to 121,169 elements (extremely fine mesh) by only 2.5%, which changes with approximately 3 and 7 times the program execution time, respectively.\nThe finite element method\u00a0(FEM) as numerical scheme is a popular method for numerically solving\u00a0differential equations\u00a0arising in engineering and\u00a0mathematical modeling which is applied in this study.\nThe FEM is a general\u00a0numerical method\u00a0for solving\u00a0partial differential equations\u00a0in two or three space variables (i.e., some\u00a0boundary value problems). To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called\u00a0finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space\u00a0discretization\u00a0in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a\u00a0mesh\u00a0of the object: the numerical domain for the solution, which has a finite number of points. The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of\u00a0algebraic equations. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain.\nThe implemented numerical model in this work was verified by analytical study of stratified two-phase Poiseuille flow49,50 and a perfect accuracy was reached."

Note that Ma et\u00a0al.\u2019s simulation results were regenerated with the relevant hypotheses and verified. The recovery factor curve, the most important curve obtained from the simulation, almost completely matches the graph from Ma et\u00a0al.\u2019s study which illustrated as Fig.\u00a04.\nChanges in CO 2 saturation.

It should be noted that considering grains with three different sizes (small, normal, and large) in the pore structure of the model leads to heterogeneity, hence fingering emerges in the simulation results of the three mentioned cases.\nThe previous results and observations related to CO2\u2013oil saturation profiles can be analyzed and discussed with a cognitive mechanism in two topics.\nFirst topic Pressure contour analysis across the pore-scale model for all time steps (from the initial time to the end of the simulation) while considering the model\u2019s inlet and outlet pressure.\nSecond topic Residual oil saturation analysis for small to intermediate pore throats (created respectively by integrating one large grain with one normal grain or two normal grains).\nPressure contour analysis. Cases 1 and 2 were simulated by assuming a fixed inlet and outlet pressure boundary. According to Fig.\u00a06a,b, the pressure difference is constant throughout the model and simulation (from the initial period until the end). The inlet and outlet pressures are at the lower boundaries of the effective nearmiscible pressure region. Regarding Case 3, Ma et\u00a0al. (2021) only considered the initial pressure in the lower boundary of the effective near-miscible pressure. According to Fig.\u00a06c, applying an outlet pressure of zero places the pressure contour of the entire model in the immiscible region shortly after beginning of the simulation. Therefore, this simulation does not contain the minimum required pressure for the near-miscibility injection process.\nResidual oil saturation (in pore throat from small to normal sizes).

According to first Fick\u2019s law of diffusion, introducing mass transfer in a specific concentration gradient tie the volumetric rate of diffusion flow to the second power of the pore radius59,60.\nTherefore, a relatively slight alteration in pore size/radius in pore-scale changes the volumetric flow rate of fluid through pores (due to viscous flow or diffusion term) by several orders of magnitude.

Thus, this section focuses on the part of the model with small-pore throats.\nIt is worth noting that although the surface tension is not zero in the near-miscible area, but due to the very low values of IFT in this area/range, the capillary forces will not be the dominant.\nLog Cap\u2014Log M (Capillary Number versus Viscosity Ratio) stability diagram showing three stability areas (bounded by dashed lines) and the locations of the CO2 displacement simulated using PF and PF + TDS cases. The gray zones denote the stability areas indicated by Lenormand et\u00a0al. 62.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a07, due to mass transfer effect, the simulated data are moved from upper boundary of viscous fingering region to lower boundary of stable region which proves the capillary forces will not be the dominant.\nSo, the fluid flow behavior in pores (porous medium) will be a significantly stronger function of pore radius than capillary forces or IFT, due to following the governing equations of viscous flow and if considering the mass transfer term by following the governing equation of diffusion.\nFigure\u00a06. Pressure contour for all three cases under: (a) PF + TDS model, (b) PF model and (c) Ma et\u00a0al.\u2019s study.\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:12632 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39706-1\nFor each pore, there is a threshold capillary pressure for fluid entry based on the pore radius. As discussed, due to gas injection in the near miscible region (and consequently low IFT values), the amount of this resistive pressure that prevents the gas entry into the pores occupied by the by-passed oil, is very small. Thus, more oil in pores comes into contact with the gas, and creates an effective driving force behind the main gas front ahead. Combined with mass transfer and the emergence of capillary cross flow, the main flow displaces the bypassed oil in pores (especially small to normal pores) toward the main flow.\nWhen returning to the main flow, the transmissivity of oil is further enhanced by coupling it with the gas flow. Studies by Williams & Dawe63, Jamiolahmady64, and Sohrabi & Danesh28 demonstrate the influence of simultaneous oil and gas flow in a specific pore in miscible displacement in near-miscible regions (very low IFT). For more accurate analysis, Fig.\u00a08 represents residual (bypassed) oil in small to normal pore throats, after the breakthrough time, and the final simulation runtimes for Cases 1 and 2. The influence of the diffusion term of volumetric flow rate (crossflow/mass transfer) in Case 2 (PF + TDS) compared to Case 1 (only PF), eventuates in almost zero saturation of residual (bypassed) oil in normal pore throats in Case 2, and very low saturation in small pore throats compared to Case 1, which indicates the nearcomplete recovery of oil related to Case 2.\nThis observation depicts the significance of considering the mass transfer term in gas injection modeling and simulation in the near-miscible front zone and its effect on sweeping residual oil, especially in small-pore throats.\nThe same mechanism that prevails over in the pores also applies to (semi) dead-end pores, which leads to an increase in the recovery of trapped oil in these pores.\nAccording to Fig.\u00a09a, there is near-zero residual oil in these pores at the end of the simulation run in Case 2 (PF + TDS); however, based on Fig.\u00a09b significant residual oil in the same pores in Case 1 is detected (PF only). Figure\u00a09 shows zero residual oil in the model\u2019s corners in both cases, albeit with slight differences.\nThe results are in good agreement with Sohrabi & Danesh (2008)28 and Seyyedi & Sohrabi (2020)41 in terms of evaluating oil recovery mechanisms under near-miscible conditions through injecting methane (first study) and CO2 (second study) in a microfluidic chip saturated with a normal decane respectively.\nBoth studies confirm the strong cross flow phenomenon via mass transfer in pores occupied by bypassed oil. Hence, this phenomenon plays an unrivaled role in directing bypass oil in contact with gas to the main gas stream, which ultimately leads to an increase in almost fully oil recovery.\nThe by-passed oil recovery mechanism during the injection of near-miscible does not occur in immiscible and miscible injection.\nDue to the intrinsic nature of the immiscible process which reflects high interfacial tension, a relatively stronger threshold capillary pressure is created at the oil\u2013gas interface which prevents the simultaneous flow of oil and gas in the main flow. In this regard, studying the properties of phases will suffice for simulating immiscible flows which can be properly carried out using the PF method42,43.\nMeanwhile, the miscible process has no oil\u2013gas interface, and the system is fundamentally single-phase with no simultaneous oil and gas flow.\nRecovery factor. As mentioned earlier, given the model\u2019s heterogeneity, CO2 first passes through the larger pores at the beginning of injection. Afterward, it rapidly moves toward the end of the model due to high mobility, bypassing a significant amount of oil. A short time after breakthrough, CO2 first prefers to invade normal pores and then smaller pores due to mass transfer, a characteristic of the capillary crossflow. In this case, the diffusion phenomenon caused by mass transfer enhances the production of residual/trapped oil from these pores.\nFigure\u00a07. Capillary number versus viscosity ratio as stability diagram showing three stability areas (bounded by dashed lines) and the locations of the PF and PF + TDS results.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:12632 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39706-1\nGenerally, by-passed oil phenomenon could emerge due to: undesirable mobility ratio, gravity override (if present), heterogeneities, dead-end pores, water (if present), and viscous fingering28.\nAccording to Fig.\u00a010, in addition to modeling two-phase flow displacement (oil and gas), recovery in Case 2 (PF + TDS) has also incorporated the effect of mass transfer (approximately 98.5%), which is 6% greater than Case 1 (PF only) that only simulated the movement of flowing phases. Hence, the recovery of Case 2 is much closer to the ideal final recovery of 100% obtained through the experimental study of miscible gas injection65 or a similar case in CFD-simulation of the porous medium43.In return to the simulation results of Case 3 (Ma\u2019s study) and given the fact that pressure throughout the model rapidly drops to very low levels (to immiscible regions), Fig.\u00a09 shows that the recovery factor of Case 3 drops to a very low value 50% (throughout the model and simulation) in a near-49% drop compared to Cases 1 and 2 in this study.\nThe pore structure of this study is consistent with certain sandstone petroleum reservoirs. On the contrary to the relatively good inter-pore connectivity, this structure has a particular unavoidable heterogeneity66.\nMiscible gas injection is often recommended for optimum recovery in the face of pore structure heterogeneity. However, achieving and maintaining miscibility conditions, mostly will be accompanied by associated operational difficulties and thus increased costs.\nHowever, these results confirm that attaining an effective near-miscible pressure region throughout the model (porous medium) and providing an injection pressure near the miscible pressure can lead to near-maximum recovery. Therefore, to achieve maximum recovery during gas injection into heterogeneous reservoirs, gas injection at near miscibility pressure is recommended as an alternative solution that is more economical and feasible than gas injection at miscibility pressure35.\nThe results of numerous slim tube experiments using two-phase samples in the vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium state show that reducing interfacial tension from a high value to near-zero (miscible condition) leads to near-zero\nFigure\u00a08. Specified part of pore-scale model during near-miscible CO2 injection after the breakthrough of the CO2 under: (a) PF + TDS model and (b) PF model.\nFigure\u00a09. Enlarged upper part of the model in order to have better comparison about the (semi)dead-ends in both cases of (a) PF + TDS model and (b) PF model which indicates the performance of case a is significantly better than case 2.\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:12632 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39706-1\nirreducible oil saturation, and an increase of relative permeability (in a specified saturation). Ultimately, the relative permeability-saturation curves become almost straight diagonal lines. As a result, the case with low values of IFT or irreducible oil saturation is actually the condition of relative permeability-saturation curves under near-miscible conditions. Using various reservoir fluid samples, they found that one set of relative permeabilitysaturation curves obtained in a specific IFT is sufficient for interpreting the flow behavior of all fluid systems which have the same IFF value67.\nThe effect of IFT alteration on relative permeability-saturation curves in the gas phase is trivial. It is confirmed that phase transition doesn\u2019t essentially affect gas relative permeability, whereas the effect is significant on oil relative permeability. Therefore, Li et\u00a0al. (2015)68 separately developed the exponential factor parameter based on Corey\u2019s model as a piecewise function for immiscible, near-miscible, and miscible pressure regions.\nTherefore, determining relative permeability-saturation curves and capillary pressure\u2013saturation curves is crucial in controlling and checking gas\u2013oil flow behavior during field-scale numerical simulation. Capillary pressure is known to follow IFT. As explained, relative permeability-saturation curves are also a function of interfacial tension, which is of great importance in near-miscible and miscible gas injection processes.\nThe pore-scale simulation results of this study suggest that when determining key parameters (related to field-scale) in near-miscible conditions, irreducible residual oil saturation and amount of capillary pressure must be lower than those used under immiscible injection. These values approach the miscible injection state in the limiting case where the capillary pressure is very small values (close to zero). This phenomenon is better apparent by considering the mass transfer term along with the movement of fluid phases.\nPressure sensitivity analysis. It can be perceived that the pressure parameter (and consequently even the effective pressure region) to apply near-miscibility conditions throughout the porous media and its effect on alterations in the surface parameters, such as the surface tension parameter and mass transfer coefficient, is the foremost parameter in the sensitivity analysis in this study.\nHence, the model\u2019s pressure in the lower boundaries of effective near-miscible pressure region increases from 0.87\u00a0MMP (11.05\u00a0MPa) to 0.9\u00a0MMP (11.5\u00a0MPa).\nFigure\u00a011 shows the results obtained with the assumption of new and previous pressure in charts of oil recovery factor, suggesting that increasing pressure and approaching miscibility pressure generally increases oil recovery factor (both case 1 (PF only) and case 2 (PF + TDS)). Meanwhile, the greater recovery factor is significant in case 1 (PF only) and slight in case 2 (PF + TDS).\nNote that even with greater pressure and the new pressure assumption, the oil recovery difference between case 1 (only PF) and case 2 (PF + TDS) and the effect of mass transfer are evident.\nIn a way, this result confirms that including the lower limit of effective near-miscible pressure region (more specifically, the lowest possible pressure in this region) and also the mass transfer term in pore-scale modeling (based on governing mechanism explained in the near-miscible region), same oil recovery factor could be achieved with a slight difference and lower cost."

Oil recovery under PF + TDS and PF model in comparison with Ma et\u00a0al.\u2019s study.\n14\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:12632 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39706-1\nThe following conclusion can be found out:\n\u2022 Using this approach, it is discerned that for both PF & PF + TDS cases, CO2 preferably displaces oil through big throats, while for PF + TDS as a consequence, invades (normal to) small pore throats, which considerably increases oil recovery efficiency. \u2022 Strengthening CO2 diffusion for flooding under an effective near-miscibility region is preferred for oil reservoirs with a wide range of pore structures. This process makes oil displacement by near-miscible gas flooding a recommended method. \u2022 Pressure changes in the near-miscible region and results of sensitivity analysis illustrate that the greater pressure in PF + TDS modeling has not significantly influenced oil recovery, which suggests that considering the effect of mass transfer in modeling has increased oil recovery toward the feasible maximum, thereby addressing the increase in operating costs.\nWe propose the work outcomes to apply in other fields such as displacement water/oil or cushion gas during geological hydrogen storage."
