The photo-sensitizing approaches can be a good solution for achieving visible or near-IR photoclick reactions.33\nThe prerequisites for achieving superior spatial resolution and temporal manipulation in photoclick labeling depend on the chemoselectivity, lifetime, and transition pathway of photoexcited intermediates.8,36 Concerning the behaviours of the intermediates, photoclick reactions could be categorized into irreversible and reversible intermediate types,7 among which the reversible type is exemplied by the reversible photodehydration of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-naphthol (HMNP) in aqueous solution37 and the P-type photoswitchable oxidopyrylium ylide (PY).38 The reversible intermediates can be fully restored to the inert precursor to circumvent undesired conjugation towards native biomolecules and to compensate for\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Although promising, there are some challenges associated with current approaches, including inefficient suppression of side-reactions toward native thiols and other nucleophiles, an insufficient reaction rate to overcome the accessibility to extremely lowconcentrated target reporters and inadequate photo-fatigue resistance of these molecular photoswitches. Therefore, studies on expanding photoswitchable intermediates with robust photo-stability and superb bioorthogonality remain challenging but highly desirable.\nThe excited triplet states are relatively long-lived and key species during many photochemical conversions8 (e.g., photoisomerization).39\u201342 They can be indirectly populated from intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excited singlet state that is commonly produced via photoexcited S0 / Sn transitions. However, the excited triplet states might not be ideally orthogonal to native biochemistry because their Dexter energy transfer43,44 to triplet oxygen (3O2), thiols and other redoxes oen resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS),45,46 radicals, and subsequently stress to live cells.\nScheme 1 The comparison of the classic (a) four-membered and (b) the cyclic SDR which equilibrates to the cyclic 1,3-dipole via electronic tau ophiles. The T-type photoswitchable SDRs serve as a novel photoclick r\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nInterestingly, localized singlet diradicals (SDRs) are highly reactive intermediates in s-bond homolysis promoted by an external stimulus (e.g., light and/or thermal).47\u201349 And, they are relatively insensitive to triplet species, including 3O2, due to an inefficient ISC at room temperature,50 making them potential bioorthogonal intermediates. The lifetime of SDRs is, however, quite short due to the ultrafast radical\u2013radical coupling back to the s-bonded state,51 which is adaptive to building T-type photoswitches but difficult to seize.52,53 Over the past decade, breakthroughs have been achieved in the generation of longlived 1,3-SDRs, which enables direct observation of the chemical equilibrium between the SDR and the s-bonded species.54,55 Heteroatoms were found to stabilize four-membered annular SDRs and even enable their isolation (Scheme 1a).56\u201358 Meanwhile ring-strain is also conducive to kinetical stabilization of photo-generated ve-membered cyclic SDRs, reported by Abe et al.59 Notably, photo-generated long-lived 4,4-dimethoxy/4sila-3,5-diphenyl-pyrazolidine-3,5-diyl was discovered to be buffered into a relatively stable cyclo[2,1,0] motif/zwitterion (Scheme 1b), which itself could be trapped by 4-phenyl-1,2,4triazole-3,5-dione (PTAD) to establish polycyclic adducts.55,60\nswitchable five-membered cyclic SDRs versus (c) the seven-membered tomerization for subsequent cycloaddition with ring-strained dipolareagent.\nChem.

The photochemical homolysis of the carbon\u2013 carbon bond in the epoxy moiety of DNQO and the characters of the 1,3-diaryl seven-membered cyclic SDRs (OXPID) were detailed for the rst time via NTAS, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), triplet radical capturing, 3O2 quenching and the solvent effect in harmony with computational studies. Engrossingly, we found that the photo-energy harvested SDRs (conversion efficiency: h up to 0.33) is seamlessly tautomerized to 3,6-dioxooxepinium-7-ylide (DOXEPY) as an energetic 1,3-dipole, which can undergo an ultrafast [3 + 2] cycloaddition (k2CA up to 1.01 \u00d7 109 M\u22121 s\u22121) with endo-bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyn-9-yl-methanol (endo-BCN-OH). The light-driven dynamic cycle of the T-type photoswitching was intercepted by the competitive cycloaddition. Therefore, a novel photoclick reaction was proposed and explored, in which the T-type photoswitchable OXPIDs serve as a recyclable intermediate to minimize unwanted side-reactions (towards, e.g., thiol additions) for bioorthogonal photolabeling with better spatiotemporal resolution."

            "text": "Absorbance spectroscopic characterization of DNQO\nBack in 1974\u20131980, photo-triggered cycloadditions between DNQO and alkenes were initially explored by Maruyama, Tezuka, and Osuaka et al.,63 in which the interconversion among DNQO # DR # DOXEPY had been hypothesized. In contrast to 2,3-nondiaryl-NQO, 2,3-diaryl-DNQO prefers to photo-react with dipolarophiles and shows resistance to nucleophilic additions and oxygenation,64 which inspire us to conceive bioorthogonality. Therefore, we commenced to establish a library of DNQOs with various heteroaryls or electron donors (eD) and electron acceptors (eA) on the 2,3-diaryl terminals (1b\u201324b, Fig. 1a and Table S1, ESI\u2020). The UV-Vis spectroscopic characters of the representative DNQOs were summarized with two absorption bands observed (311 \u00b1 20 nm and 340 \u00b1 40 nm) and two extinction coefficients (3311 and 3365) displayed in Fig. 1b, respectively (also in Table S2, ESI\u2020). TDDFT calculation and natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis65 indicated that the two absorption bands around 311 nm and 340 nm belong to the S0 / S4 and S0 / S2 transitions of 1b (Fig. 1c, for computational details, Fig. S22, ESI\u2020), respectively, which are p\u2013p* and n\u2013p* type transitions with the oscillator strength, f = 0.211 and 0.009.\nThe orbital distributions also suggest that both thep\u2013p* and the n\u2013p* transitions were mainly involved by the oxygen atoms of the epoxide together with the two carbonyl groups, while the 2,3-diaryl terminals have negligible contribution. Therefore, it rationalizes the experimental observation that variation on the diaryl moiety has a trivial effect on the absorption wavelength.\n13256 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13254\u201313264\nScreening and optimization on the photoclick reactions\nTo identify a robust reactivity, DNQO (100 mM) was subjected to photo-activation in the presence of typical alkenes/alkynes (500 mM) via irradiation with various light sources (e.g., a 311 nm hand-held mercury lamp and 365 nm or 373 nm LED arrays) for 60 s in a mixed aqueous solvent and comparing with conditions of keeping in the dark for 48 h, respectively (Fig. 2 and Tables S3\u2013 S5, ESI\u2020). The alkenes with ring-strain (1c), electron-deciency (2c\u20133c), and electron-donors (4c) versus the alkynes with ringstrain (6c and 7c), alkyl substituent (8c), and electrondeciency (9c) were compared to examine both the electron effect and the ring-strain promotion on the cycloaddition. Based on quantitative HPLC-MS screening (Fig. 2a\u2013c), the results can be summarized as follows: (i) the dipolarophiles without both ringstrain and sufficient electron-deciency (3c, 4c and 8c) barely reacted with all the DNQOs. Delightedly, the ring-strained dipolarophiles (1c, 6c and 7c) could photo-react efficiently with the majority of the DNQOs, while the highly electron-decient ones (2c and 9c) were able to afford cycloadducts sluggishly; (ii) in the presence of the ring-strained dipolarophiles, DNQOs possessing electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) or uorine\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

But severe photolyzes were observed for most of the DNQOs under 311 nm light, which induces mainly the S0 / S4 transition of DNQO. These phenomena reect the reversible and the short-lived nature of the photogenerated intermediates in the cycloaddition reaction; (iv) there was no background reactions detected in the dark even aer incubation for 48 h, implying a high stability of DNQOs; (v) for the ringstrain dipolarophiles, the reaction of 7c towards DNQOs was found to be slower than 1c and 6c, probably due to the steric effects. Therefore, DNQOs 1b, 3b, 5b, 13b, 17b, and 24b with representative substituents were preferred candidates for indepth evaluation of the performance of the photoclick reaction toward the ring-strained BCN-OH. 365 nm LED was chosen as an optimal light source, considering the high phototoxicity, the photolysis of DNQOs under 311 nm light as well as the poor photo-conversion under 373 nm light (Table S2, ESI\u2020). Aer a synthetical scale preparation (0.48 mmol scale and 71% yield) and crystallization, the structure of the endo-cycloadduct (1DEBCOD, Fig. 2d) from 1b and BCN-OH was identied via single crystal XRD (Table S7, ESI\u2020).\nProofs for the presence of SDRs and the substituent effects\nGiven the relatively short-lived intermediates (SDRs, Fig. 3a) from the photochemical conversion of DNQO 1b, we adopted NTAS measurement (lex. = 355 nm, 1 ns pulse duration, 7 mJ, and 1k Hz) to unravel the absorption spectrum and the decaying\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nof the intermediates in CH3CN : H2O = 1 : 1. Intriguingly, a strong absorption band was observed in the visible region (lmax = 550 nm, Fig. 3b) with an exponential decay to the original state (t1/2 = 18 ms, Fig. 3c) under an air atmosphere. This transient species was then discovered to be a sevenmembered cyclic singlet diradical, 1SDR, based on the following experimental evidence:55,59 (i) this species absorbing at 550 nm was EPR-silent in a methanol matrix at 140 K (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020); (ii) the lifetime of this transient species was scarcely altered in the presence of saturated 3O2 or by typical triplet quenchers (Fig. S4, ESI\u2020); (iii) spin trapping of this transient intermediates (5.0 mM 1b in ACN/H2O at 298 K) by radical scavengers,66 e.g., 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), under continuous 365 nm irradiation resulted in failures in identifying the corresponding spin adducts based on HPLC-MS analysis (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020).\nAs theoretical proofs, the optimized geometry of 1SDR was obtained by the broken-symmetry wavefunction method (for computational details, see the ESI\u2020).67,68 Spin density analysis (by using Multiwfn 3.8dev69 and visualization by using VMD 1.9.3 70) support the existence of single electrons with opposite spin on the two bond-broken carbon atoms (Fig. 3d). It is also calculated that the Gibbs free energy of 1SDR is lower than that of the triplet diradical 1TDR, exhibiting a prominent singlettriplet energy gap, DES\u2013T = \u22123.5 kcal mol\u22121, and S2 = 0.32 at the M06-2X/6-31G** level of theory (by using Shermo 2.3,71 Fig. 3d and Tables S9 and S14, ESI\u2020). The predicted lmax for the absorption of 1SDR in the visible region (lcalc.max = 517 nm and f= 0.355) at the TD-UM06-2X/6-31G** level of theory72 also matches well with the experimental value, lexp.max = 550 nm (Fig. 3g, Table S11, ESI\u2020).

Type-I has the symmetric orbital jS as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the antisymmetric orbital jA as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).59 In contrast, type-II adopts jA as the HOMO and jS as the LUMO. CASSCF calculations at the CAS(2,2)/6-31G**(SMD, ACN : H2O= 1 : 1) level of theory indicated that 1SDR is a type-II SDR with the HOMO of antisymmetric jA (Fig. 4a). The coefficients (c) of\n13258 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13254\u201313264\nelectronic congurations I and III were 0.92 and \u22120.38, respectively. Therefore, the numbers of occupied electrons on the jA and jS orbitals were 1.69 (= 2 \u00d7 0.92\n2) and 0.29 [= 2 \u00d7 (\u22120.38)2], respectively (Fig. 4a). And the diradical character y of 1SDR was determined to be 0.29.\nTaking the seven-membered cyclic dipole (1DOXEPY, Fig. 3a) into account, we subsequently reassessed the absorption spectrum and decaying of the transient 1SDR in various solvents because the predicted absorbance maximum of 1DOXEPY (lcalc.max = 522 nm, f = 0.462, Fig. 3g) is also in good agreement with the experimental value. As a result of the solvent effect,66 the lifetime of 1SDR was notably prolonged in more polar solvent (Fig. 3e) implying that the radical\u2013radical s-coupling energy barrier (DG\u2021re.) increased, but the l exp. max was almost unchanged (Fig. S5a, ESI\u2020). The higher DG\u2021re. supports the presence of 1DOXEPY, which is calculated to be in equilibrium via electronic tautomerism with 1SDR (Fig. 3d) and stabilized by polar solvents (Fig. S5b, ESI\u2020).59 This absorbance peak (lexp.max= 550 nm, Fig. 3b) was assigned to the characteristic p\u2013p* (HOMO\u2013LUMO) electronic transition of 1SDR and its electronic tautomer 1DOXEPY aer comparing with their TD-DFT results. The major electronic transitions were located at 517 nm (f = 0.355) and 522 nm (f = 0.462, Table S11, ESI\u2020), respectively. Based on their free energy difference (DGeq. = 0.80 kcal mol\u22121, Fig. 3d), the Boltzmann distribution between 1SDR and 1DOXEPY (U, Fig. 3g and Table S11, ESI\u2020) at 298 K was obtained, indicating a component of 79% 1SDR versus 21% 1DOXEPY. And, this distribution is constant during the thermal decay of 1SDR / 1b (kd = 3.8 \u00d7 10\n4 s\u22121) because the electronic tautomerism is an ultrafast equilibriumwith no transition states73 and only the reconstitution in the electronic structure. At about 77 K, we were able to photograph the pink-coloured 1SDR and its thermo-relaxation process in a MTHF matrix, clarifying the T-type photoswitching nature (Fig. 3d).\nIn view of the apparent substitution effect on the cycloaddition yield (Fig. 2), we further investigated the properties of the selected SDRs (Fig. 3f). With strong electron-donors (eDs), the absorption maximum of 5SDR was red-shied to 600 nm in contrast to 17SDR with strong electron-acceptors (eAs) showing a hypochromic shi to 530 nm. And these experimental spectra were consistent with the predicted spectra obtained via TD-DFT calculation (lexp.max vs. l calc. max , Fig. 3g). Accordingly, the thermal ring-contraction rate (kd) of 3SDR and 5SDR with eDs accelerated to 1.73 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 (4.6-fold) and 1.12 \u00d7 106 s\u22121 (29-fold), respectively, while that of 17SDR with eAs decelerated to 5.02 \u00d7 103 s\u22121 (0.13-fold, Fig. 3g and S3, ESI\u2020) by using 1SDR as a benchmark. As the transition states (TS) searching explicated (Table S11, ESI\u2020), the thermodynamic barrier (DG\u2021re.) for the relaxation of SDR / DNQO descended from 6.3 to 3.2 kcal mol\u22121 along with a substituent order from eAs (17SDR > 1SDR > 13SDR) to eDs (3SDR > 5SDR), which was also in conformity to the experimental texp.1/2 (Fig. 3g). By comparing the DGeq. with the DG \u2021 re. in Fig. 3g, we speculate that the thermal decaying observed in the NTAS was presumably ratedetermined by the radical\u2013radical s-coupling process of SDR / DNQO rather than the faster tautomerization between SDR # DOXEPY.

            "text": "photoswitch cycles versus the cycloaddition\nTo decipher the mechanism of the photoclick process mediated via the photoswitchable 1SDR, further studies on the photochemical pathways were performed via (TD-)DFT (Fig. 4b). Once 1b was excited to the rst singlet state (1b-S1) by 365 nm light (both S0/ S1 and S0/ S2 transitions), 1SDR could be obtained as a converged structure via a homolytic cleavage of the C\u2013C bond in the epoxy via 1b-TS1-S1 with a free energy barrier (DG\u2021TS1) of 4.4 kcal mol\n\u22121 (Fig. 4b). Without BCN-OH, 1SDR would primarily undergo a thermodynamic radical\u2013radical coupling, returning to 1b via transition state 1b-TS3 (DG\u2021TS3 = DGre.\u2021 = 5.9 kcal mol\n\u22121) to complete an ultrafast photoswitch cycle. In the presence of BCN-OH, a competitive pathway leading to a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between BCN-OH and 1,3- dipole (1DOXEPY, as the electronic tautomer of 1SDR) was involved, which affords the nal cycloadduct 1DEBCOD via transition state 1b-TS2. Notably, the DG\u2021TS2 of the cycloaddition step was substantially lower than that of the radical coupling process (3.8 vs. 5.9 kcal mol\u22121), suggesting that BCN-OH is capable of capturing the transient 1DOXEPY if [BCN-OH] is given at 0.5 mM (theoretical kd/k2CA = 58). Considering the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nbioorthogonality of these reactive intermediates, we have further searched for the nucleophilic addition pathways of the 1,3-dipole (1DOXEPY) with respect to thiols, e.g., glutathione (GSH, Fig. S23 and Table S9, ESI\u2020). As a result, the energy barrier in the nucleophilic addition by GSH was incredibly higher than that of the ring-strain promoted cycloaddition with BCN-OH (17.6 vs. 3.8 kcal mol\u22121) and therefore implies a superior chemoselectivity toward the cycloaddition.\nTo understand the electronic effects on the efficiency of the cycloaddition, ve exemplary DNQOs (3b, 5b, 13b, 17b and 24b, Fig. 4c) were subjected to mechanism interpretation at the same level of theory. The computational results illustrated that the introduction of various substituents (either eD or eA) displayed comparable energy barriers during the ring-strain promoted cycloaddition step (DG\u2021TS2, 3.5\u20134.0 kcal mol\n\u22121, Table S12, ESI\u2020). However, the energy barrier associated with the radical\u2013radical coupling processes (DG\u2021TS3) became differentiated. The eA groups (such as triuoromethyl in 17SDR) dramatically elevated the DG\u2021TS3 = 6.3 kcal mol\n\u22121, prolonging the half-life of the SDR and facilitating the cycloaddition with BCN-OH (DG\u2021TS2 = 3.8 kcal mol\u22121, Fig. 4c). In contrast, the eD group, e.g., uorine atoms in 13SDR, methyl groups in 3SDR and methoxyl groups in 5SDR, lowered the DG\u2021TS3 in the radical-coupling by 0.6, 1.5 and 2.7 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, shortening the half-life of the SDRs. Especially for 5SDR with the shortest half-life (t1/2 = 620 ns, Fig. 3g), the DG\u2021TS3 of 3.2 kcal mol \u22121 was even slightly lower\nChem.

The theoretical calculation was consistent with the experimental observations that DNQOs with eD groups showed very poor photo-conversion (4b\u20137b, Fig. 2c). Upon further calculation, there was no signicant alteration found in both the orbital characteristics and the electron occupied numbers by the various substituents in the ve SDRs (Fig. S24, S25 and Table S13, ESI\u2020). The relatively long-lived SDRs55 were likely stabilized by both the carbonyl and the diaryl moieties, thus enabling the cycloaddition with BCN-OH to establish an ultrafast photoclick reaction.\nKey parameters for the photoswitching and the photoclick reaction\nAs a proof-of-concept for the photoclick strategy utilizing T-type photoswitchable SDRs, the quantum yield (Fmax) and the lightto-chemical-energy conversion efficiency (h) for the photochemical transformation from DNQO to SDRs as well as the cycloaddition rate (k2CA) are essential parameters. Since the apparent quantum yield (F) for a photoswitchable intermediate is dependent on the concentration of [BCN-OH] under given irradiation conditions, we were able to derive both the Fmax and the kd/k2CA (based on experimental studies) by varying [BCN-OH], according to reported methods (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI\u2020).74 Herein, the kd is directly obtained by monitoring the decay of SDRs from NTAS measurements. Then, the k2CA is calculated based on the competition reactions between the thermal decay and the cycloaddition of DOXEPY. As an energetic SDR molecule, the h is the ratio of the potential energy difference (DGSDR-DNQO) between DNQO and the \u201cmetastable\u201d SDR harvested during the photochemical conversion with a quantum yield (Fmax) versus the incident photon energy (Elight = hnNA, Table S15, ESI\u2020).75 These parameters for the photoclick reaction between the ve DNQOs and BCN-OH are summarized in Table 1, except 5b due to a very poor reactivity. Firstly, we found that the [3 + 2] cycloaddition rates between DOXEPYs and the ring-strained BCN-OH are ultrafast, ranging from 4.86 \u00d7 107 M\u22121 s\u22121 for unsymmetric 24b to 1.01 \u00d7 109 M\u22121 s\u22121 for 13b with p-F-phenyl. The cycloaddition rates at this level imply promising kinetics to ligate to extremely diluted BCN reporters on biomolecules. Regardless of the substitutions on the diaryl, all the SDRs hold a high and\nconsistent DGSDR-DNQO energy, about 32.1\u201333.8 kcal mol \u22121. Therefore, a higher h depends mainly on a better Fmax. Symmetric p-FPh (13b), p-CF3Ph (17b) on 1,3-positions of DNQO and unsymmetric p-FPh combined with p-COOMePh (24b) terminals were favourable to a high Fmax (= 0.56, 0.58 and 0.76) in the photo-ring-opening step, and accordingly the value of h can be gained as 24%, 25% and 33%, respectively. Thus, the light irradiation not only manages the process of the photoclick reaction, but its energy is also efficiently converted to the chemical energy of the long-lived SDR and DOXEPY during the T-type photoswitching, powering an ultrafast cycloaddition with BCNOH.\nEvaluation of the chemoselectivity and the stability of DNQOs in a biological medium\nIn a complex living context, photolysis or quenching of the photo-generated intermediates (type-I, Fig. 5a) by the abundant\nen the representative DNQOs and BCN-OHa\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The reversion of the reactive 1SDR# 1DOXEPY back to 1b via the superfast s-coupling provides an alternative pathway to circumvent these undesired processes, and the SDR is naturally insensitive to 3O2. To evaluate the biocompatibility (Fig. 5a), we rescreened the DNQO-BCN photoclick reactions by moving to a biological mimicking medium containing both 10.0 mM GSH and nucleophilic natural amino acids (1.0 mM each, Fig. S10, ESI\u2020). Without BCN-OH, the concentration of DNQOs (1b, 13b, 15b and 24b) was almost unchanged aer incubation in the dark for 24 h or under 365 nm irradiation for 60 s, verifying a superior photostability of the DNQOs against a variety of nucleophiles as well as an excellent recovery through photoswitching cycles. Aerward, temporally controlled cycloadditions were then realized in the presence of BCN-OH by using incremental irradiation with the cycloadduct yield increased along the accumulation of the irradiation time (Fig. 5b and S11,\nFig. 6 Spatiotemporally resolved fluorescence labeling on the membran labeling procedure on the cell membrane via 365 nm light (90 s) to induc chemical structure of the tailored DNQO-Cy3 probe; (c) confocal mic signals on cell surface, Hoechst-33342 staining for nucleus of the living rescence imaging of the cells after exposure to the patterned 365 nm LE 400, Mightex, 25% 2.0 W LED light power) for 30 s, with the white arrows the membrane segments outside the stimulation pattern.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Although the formation of by-products became notable aer prolonged irradiation (0\u201314.3% for 30\u2013180 s, the orange columnar segments, Fig. 5b), they were attributed to the photolysis of the desired cycloadducts (type-II, Fig. 5a) rather than the type-I photolysis or nucleophilic quenching of the SDR or DOXEPY (Fig. S12, S13, ESI\u2020). To further monitor type-I photolysis, BCN-OH has to be omitted from the mixture. However, by-products produced by type-I photolysis aer 180 s exposure in simply CH3CN/PBS = 1/1 mixed solvent remain negligible. Furthermore, a high concentration of GSH (10\u201350 mM) as well as mammalian cell culture medium were included to reassess the photostability of 1SDR (Fig. 5c and S14\u2013S18, ESI\u2020). Gratifyingly, the remaining 1b could be kept up to 80% in the presence of 50.0 mM GSH (almost saturated solution) or even in the Dulbecco's modied Eagle's medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% antibiotics) aer 3.0 min irradiation of a 365 nm LED.

To incorporate the BCN reporter onto the membrane of a living A549 cancer cell via immuno-recognition toward the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR+), a chemically modied chimeric monoclonal antibody, cetuximab-FITC-BCN (20 mg mL\u22121 = 0.13 mM CexFITC-BCN, Fig. S19, ESI\u2020) was attached via incubation for 60 min. Aer exposure to a 365 nm LED for 90 s with the treatment of 20 mM DNQO-Cy3 in air (Fig. 6c), the concomitant appearance of both Cy3 and FITC uorescence was observed on the cell surface, colocalizing precisely (Fig. 6c, upper row), suggesting a temporal controllability of this photoclick reaction. Without the exposure, there was no Cy3 signal detected on the cell surface but only the FITC signal was observed due to binding of Cex-FITC-BCN (Fig. 6c, lower row). Without the treatment with Cex-FITC-BCN, both Cy3 and FITC signals were negligible even aer identical exposure (for other stringent control conditions, Fig. S20, ESI\u2020).\nEncouraged by the ultrafast reaction rates and the high chemoselectivity of the DNQO-BCN photoclick reaction, we attempted spatial-resolved uorescence labeling of cetuximabBCN on single or even partial cell membranes. To achieve lithographic patterning with sub-micron resolution, we programmed a 30 s continuous 365 nm illumination sequence via a digital microarray device (DMD) embedded in an epiuorescence microscope through a 100\u00d7 objective lens. Meanwhile a lithographic pattern of a grid matrix (58.7 \u00d7 32.1 mm, 6 \u00d7 6 purple lines, Fig. 6d) with two rectangle columns at the terminal (light blue regions) lled was drawn as the input shape. As a result, the DNQO-Cy3 probe in PBS (20 mM and pH = 7.4) was photo-switched on to generate SDR-Cy3 within the stimulation region, and subsequently conjugated toward the bound cetuximab-BCN (incubated at 120 mg mL\u22121 in DMEM for 1 h) in proximity (Fig. 6d, for details, refers to Fig. S21, ESI\u2020). Unreacted SDR-Cy3 was mostly recovered to DNQO-Cy3 instantaneously with minimal molecule diffusion because of its ms level half-life. Consequently, most of the cell membrane segments overlaying within the grid-patterned region were covalently marked with the Cy3 uorophore, resulting in curve-shaped signals (white arrows). But the unexposed portion of the membranes (yellow arrows) scarcely showed any signal, indicating a subcellular spatial-resolving power of the photoclick reaction. However, off-site labeling could also be observed (Fig. S21, ESI\u2020), which might be ascribed to scattering of the light-ray in the specimen or dynamic change of the membrane morphology during the extensive washing procedure or unexpected off-target labeling.\n13262 | Chem.

The unique seven-membered cyclic OXPID (SDR) as well as its long-lived character revealed by spectroscopic and computational characterization constitute an efficient photo-energy transducer, which tautomerize into an energetic 1,3-dipole, DOXEPY. Therefore, the energy harvesting nature of the T-type molecular photoswitch makes the OXPID a highly useful species in a limited repertoire of SDRs that can drive an ultrafast cycloaddition with endo-BCN-OH. In this way, we established a type of bioorthogonal photoclick reaction for spatiotemporal labeling on living cells, which is underpinned by the unique features of the SDR, including insensitivity to triplet species and regeneration without capturing by BCN-OH. The facile two-step synthesis of DNQO facilitates an easy access for versatile utilities of the photoswitchable SDR in photoclick chemistry. Currently, the requirement of 365 nm UV light to induce the photoswitching is the limiting factor. Therefore, research on visible-light-triggered bioorthogonal reactions with temporal and spatial control by using DNQO is now underway in our lab."
