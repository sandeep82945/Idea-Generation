ABSTRACT Objectives Patients with endstage renal disease (ESRD) are at a high risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs), and kidney transplantation (KT) has been reported to improve risk of CVEs and survival. As the association of KT timing on longterm survival and clinical outcomes remains unclear, we investigated the association of different KT waiting times with clinical outcomes. Design Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting We conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Adult patients who initiated KT therapy from 1997 to 2013 were included. Participants A total of 3562 adult patients who initiated uncomplicated KT therapy were included and categorised into four groups according to KT waiting times after ESRD: group 1 (<1 year), group 2 (1\u20133 years), group 3 (3\u20136 years) and group 4 (>6 years). Primary outcome measures The main outcomes were composite of allcause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, based on the primary diagnosis in medical records during hospitalisation. Results Compared with group 1, the adjusted risk of primary outcome events (allcause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) increased by 1.67 times in group 2 (95% CI: 1.40 to 2.00; p<0.001), 2.17 times in group 3 (95% CI: 1.73 to 2.71; p<0.001) and 3.10 times in group 4 (95% CI: 2.21 to 4.35; p<0.001). The rates of primary outcome events were 6.7%, 13.4% and 14.0% within 5 years, increasing to 19.5%, 26.3% and 30.8% within 10 years in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that early KT is associated with superior longterm cardiovascular outcomes compared with late KT in selected patients with ESRD receiving uncomplicated KT, suggesting that an early KT could be a better treatment option for patients with ESRD who are eligible for transplantation.",

RRT- dependent patients who wait for KT need to receive dialysis treatments. Studies have revealed that KT was superior to dialysis treatments in terms of improved quality of life,4 5 survival6\u20138 and cardiovascular outcome.9 10 Therefore, KT is considered a gold- standard RRT; however, KT recipients still exhibit increased cardiovascular events (CVEs), compared with the general population.4 6 Moreover, several independent risk factors were reported for mortality and CVEs in KT recipients including male sex,11 older age,12 13 prior CVEs,14 15 left ventricular hypertrophy,16 abnormal myocardial perfusion,16 low/high- density lipoprotein cholesterol,17 low physical activity18 and elevated plasma levels of asymmetrical dimethylarginine.19\nA proportionally large number of patients with ESRD received late KT due to the shortage of kidney donors. Thus, by early 2017, the KT waitlist in Taiwan exceeded 6000 patients; nevertheless, only 230\u2013325 patients received KTs per year (between 2005 and 2016).20 While evidence regarding the effect of KT timings on clinical outcomes is very limited,9 a few national reports have\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The data for this study were collected from patients who initiated kidney transplantation therapy from 1997 to 2013 and were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. \u21d2 Our findings indicated that kidney transplantation should be performed as early as possible in eligible patients with end- stage renal disease to improve their survival and clinical outcomes. \u21d2 Limitations include the risk of residual confounding in view of the retrospective study design and inherent limitations of administrative claims data, including the lack of key data on physical and laboratory parameters.\nP atna).

We highly concerned that several clinical factors related to KT complications possibly influenced the outcomes. We therefore conducted a largescale retrospective observational study with an exclusion of KT complications to analyse a 17- year sample from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the relationship between KT timing and long- term cardiovascular outcomes; the study results may aid in national policy development for promoting organ donations, clinical practice and further investigations."

            "text": "The data for the analyses were obtained from the NHIRD in Taiwan between 1997 and 2012. The observation period ended in 2013. The NHIRD contains numerous inpatient and outpatient medical data for almost 23 million residents. All RRT strategies, including KT and maintenance dialysis (PD and/or HD) treatments, are covered by the NHI system. The database contains patients\u2019 identification number, age, sex, details of outpatient and inpatient services, as well as diagnoses and procedures. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9- CM) code system has been used for reimbursement in the healthcare system. Numerous studies have been published based on this valuable medical database. This observational cohort study collected data of all adult patients with ESRD (\u226518 years old) from the population who had received uncomplicated KT as an RRT between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2012, who were followed up until 31 December 2013.\nStudy design and relevant variables Patients with ESRD certificate cards (labelled by the ICD- 9- CM code number 585) indicating RRT- dependent patients, who had received KT, defined as the ICD- 9- CM code number V42.0, were eligible for inclusion. The relevant data were accumulated from the code numbers of the selected patients. The date of receipt of the ESRD diagnosis was defined as the date the ESRD certificate card was recorded. Dialysis treatments, regardless of the HD and/or PD treatments, were allowed both before and after the KT. The waiting time was calculated from the time the dialysis started (the date ESRD certificate card was recoded) and the time of KT (the date the code number V42.0 was recorded). Patients who were not simultaneously coded by the ICD- 9- CM code numbers 585 and V42.0, were younger than 18 years or had KT complications such as graft infection, rejection and failure (ICD- 9- CM code number 996.81) were excluded. We categorised the selected patients into four groups according\nto the different KT waiting times after ESRD: group 1 (<1 year), group 2 (1\u20133 years), group 3 (3\u20136 years) and group 4 (>6 years).\nThe diagnostic codes were linked to inpatient and outpatient claims from the NHIRD including age, sex, patient demographics, baseline comorbidities, survival status and date of death. Comorbidities at the baseline were diabetes mellitus (DM) (ICD- 9- CM code number of 250.X), hypertension (ICD- 9- CM code numbers of 401.X\u2013405.X), dyslipidaemia (ICD- 9- CM code number of 272.X), prior ischaemic stroke (ICD- 9- CM code numbers 433\u2013434) before KT and prior myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD- 9- CM code numbers of 410.X\u2013411.X) before KT. The primary outcomes were composite of all- cause mortality, non- fatal MI and non- fatal ischaemic stroke. We also analysed these three outcomes separately. Death by any cause was identified as withdrawal from the NHI system. A non- fatal MI event after KT was defined as ICD9- CM codes 410.X and 411.X, and a non- fatal stroke event after KT was defined as ICD- 9- CM codes 433\u2013434. The observational period was 1\u201317 years."

            "text": "This study generated four major findings; first, significant differences in the primary events and all- cause mortality were exhibited among the four groups with stratified KT waiting times of <1, 1\u20133, 3\u20136 and >6 years. The KT waiting time is an independent predictor for primary events and all- cause mortality in uncomplicated KT recipients. Second, the late uncomplicated KT groups (>1 years) versus the early uncomplicated KT group (<1 year) exhibited significantly increased (1.67\u20133.10 times) risks of primary events and all- cause mortality (1.69\u20132.77 times) during the longterm observational period. Third, patients in group 4 receiving the latest uncomplicated KT (>6 years), who were younger and presented fewer comorbidities had an approximately three times increased risk of primary events; therefore, compared with an earlier uncomplicated KT, a later uncomplicated KT may increase the risk of primary events and reduce the clinical benefits. Fourth, only one- fourth of the domestic KT recipients received KT within 1 year after they had been diagnosed with ESRD, despite early KT being strongly recommended.\nThe key problem of delayed KT is lack of kidney donors in Taiwan. A cultural concept of keeping a completely intact body has limited organ donation. The organisation of Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center has been responsible for managing the organ donation, matching and sharing. Nearly three- fourths of the selected KT recipients received KT over 1 year after ESRD diagnosis. The results indicated that the early uncomplicated KT group (<1 year) was significantly associated with lower risks of primary events and mortality, compared with those in the late uncomplicated KT groups. This clearly points out that when the waiting times for the KT are shorter, the primary and mortality risks are further reduced in the selected T ab le 2 C um ul at iv e in ci d en ce r at es\no f c\nlin ic\nal e\nve nt\ns (a\nllca\nus e\nd ea\nth , n\non - f\nat al\nA M\nI a nd\nn on\n- f at\nal s\ntr ok\ne) in\nK T\ngr ou\np s\nw ith\nd iff\ner en\nt w\nai tin\ng tim\nes\nW ai\nti ng\nt im e fo r K T\nP ri\nm ar\ny ev\nen ts\n* A\nllca\nus e\nd ea\nth N\no n-\nfa ta\nl A M\nI N\no n-\nfa ta\nl s tr\no ke\nN o\no f\np at\nie nt s w it h ev en ts\nC um\nul at\niv e\nin ci\nd en\nce r\nat e\n(% )\nP v\nal ue\n\u2020\nN o\no f\np at\nie nt s w it h ev en ts\nC um\nul at\niv e\nin ci\nd en\nce r\nat e\n(% )\nP v\nal ue\n\u2020\nN o\no f\np at\nie nt s w it h ev en ts\nC um\nul at\niv e\nin ci\nd en\nce r\nat e\n(% )\nP v\nal ue\n\u2020\nN o\no f\np at\nie nt s w it h ev en ts\nC um\nul at\niv e\nin ci\nd en\nce r\nat e\n(% )\nP v\nal ue \u2020 5 ye ar s 10 ye ar s 5 ye ar s 10 ye ar s 5 ye ar s 10 ye ar s 5 ye ar s 10 ye ar s\n< 1\nye ar\n24 4\n6. 7\n19 .5\n< 0.\n00 1\n20 5\n5. 5\n16 .2\n< 0.\n00 1\n39 0.\n6 2.\n3 0.\n10 1\n35 1.\n3 3.\n3 0.\n66 4\n1\u2013 3\nye ar\ns 38\n9 13\n.0 26\n.0 33\n0 11\n.0 22\n.2 59\n1. 9\n4. 5\n47 1.\n8 3.\n4\n4\u2013 6\nye ar\ns 15\n5 14\n.0 30\n.8 13\n1 11\n.2 27\n.7 21\n2. 0\n4. 8\n15 1.\n9 3.\n2\n> 6\nye ar\ns 47\n14 .5\n\u2013 37\n11 .9\n\u2013 6\n2. 0\n\u2013 7\n1. 8\n\u2013\nA ll\nK T\n83 5\n11 .8\n25 .2\n70 3\n9. 8\n21 .4\n12 5\n1. 6\n3. 9\n10 4\n1. 7\n3. 4\nVa lu\nes fo\nr ca\nte go\nric al\nv ar\nia b\nle s\nar e\ngi ve\nn as\np er\nce nt\nag e.\n*\u2018 P\nrim ar\ny ev\nen ts\n\u2019 i nd\nic at\ne a\nco m\np os\nite o\nf a ll-\nca us\ne d\nea th\n, n on\n- f at\nal A\nM I a\nnd n\non - f\nat al\ns tr\nok e.\n\u2020P v\nal ue\nw as\ne st\nim at\ned u\nsi ng\nlo g-\nra nk\nt es t.

Furthermore, the present study observed high rates of the primary events (11.8% within 5 years and 25.2% within 10 years) among the overall uncomplicated KT recipients (table 2). In groups 1, 2 and 3, the rates were 6.7%, 13.0% and 14.0% within 5 years, increasing to 19.5%, 26.0% and 30.8% within 10 years, respectively. The results reveal that the rates of the primary events in the uncomplicated KT recipients were high, approximately doubling within the following 5 years. Conflicting results obtained from a retrospective study on KT recipients (n=4954) indicated no significant change in the incidence of major CVEs (MI, coronary angioplasty, bypass surgery and stroke) and death over a 3- year observational period (p=0.41 and p=0.92, respectively).26 Different characteristics of the selected patient groups, primary endpoints and observational periods may partially account for the inconsistent results. It was reasonable that the rates of non- fatal AMI and stroke compared with total (fatal and non- fatal) AMI and stroke were relatively low in the study because the partial numbers of fatal AMI and stroke might contribute to the numbers of all- cause death.\nAll- cause mortality rates were increased in the late uncomplicated KT groups over 15 years. Compared with group 1, group 2 had all- cause mortality rates of 11.0% (vs 5.5%) within 5 years, 22.2% (vs 16.2%) within 10 years and 35.8% (vs 26.3%) within 15 years, respectively. The adjusted mortality risk was considerably augmented by 69% in group 2 during the long- term observational period.\nRRT- dependent patients who waited for KT needed to receive dialysis treatments. This finding may be explained by the fact that delayed KT requires longer pre- KT dialysis\nFigure 3 Kaplan- Meier analysis for all- cause mortality. Kaplan- Meier survival analysis illustrates a significant difference in the cumulative incidence of all- cause mortality among the four KT groups during the 17- year observational period (p<0.001 by log- rank test).

Consistent results obtained from several studies have exhibited that pre- KT and post- KT dialysis duration is reversely associated with the survival outcome.21\u201325 Furthermore, an 11- year retrospective cohort study on KT recipients (n=4654) revealed a marginal increase in mortality in patients with a delay of >1 year, as well as bridge pre- KT HD treatments, compared with patients without delay (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.81; p=0.04).25 Moreover, the documented pre- emptive KT was associated with a 45% reduction in the hazard of the dialysis or pre- KT (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.64; p<0.001), and a 40% reduction in the hazard of death with a functioning graft (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.71; p<0.001).27 In addition, young adults (11\u201330 years old) with ESRD who were not listed for KT within 5 years and received dialysis treatments were 16.6 times more at risk of mortality than those who received transplantation, according to the report of UK renal registry data between 1999 and 2008.28 Together, the findings strongly support that KT waiting time is an independent predictor for primary events, as well as allcause mortality, while early KT generates more favourable clinical outcomes.\nWe propose several possible reasons for the superior clinical outcomes of early uncomplicated KT. First, the patient selection bias and the baseline heterogeneity should have been considered in the present study. Patients in group 4 who were younger, presented with fewer comorbidities and received late uncomplicated KT had an approximately three times higher clinical risk than patients in group 1 receiving early uncomplicated KT. We explained the finding that younger patients in group 4 were with possibly more detrimental factors to result in earlier development of ESRD and need longer dialysis treatments, which might lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Second, pre- KT dialysis duration in most patients in groups 1\u20134 varied and presumably affected the clinical outcomes. Late KT with longer pre- KT dialysis duration may worsen the clinical and survival outcomes, thus increasing the risks of infections and malignancies. Compatible results from relevant studies have depicted that late KTs with longer pre- KT dialysis duration may lead to a relatively poorer survival.21\u201325 By contrast, early KT with shorter pre- KT dialysis duration may yield more favourable outcomes. Third, KT provides a relatively complete RRT with comprehensive physiological functions that may be superior to dialysis treatments in the form of a partial RRT. Therefore, longer KT duration with shorter dialysis duration may yield relatively favourable outcomes in early KT recipients. Although the survival rates vary significantly due to the different KT waiting times, the non- immunological pairing of kidney donors and recipients deserves serious consideration regarding clinical outcomes.29\nAs conducting a randomised and controlled trial with randomisation according to the KT waiting times is challenging and against ethics, this retrospective observational study provides long- term, real- world data; nevertheless, inherently, it has several limitations. First, some crucial variables and confounders were not totally considered, as the\nNHIRD did not contain laboratory details and all patients\u2019 characteristics, and as factors affecting waitlisting. The baseline heterogeneity and the unmeasured confounders may have affected the outcomes, despite the use of statistically adjusted analyses. For example, confounders in retrospective observational studies may result from selection bias, inaccurate and unavailable data, unfair allocation, unequal baseline characteristics and unrecorded events. Second, we did not separate domestic and overseas KTs for the analysis30; at the time of this study, we were unaware of the overseas KT failures in some patients. Third, factors such as post- KT complications, immunosuppressive drugs, lifestyle conditions (ie, cigarette smoking) and achievements of therapeutic goals were not analysed. We highlight it should be limited to generalise the results to all KT patients. Fourth, the duration between the KT and ESRD might not be entirely accurate, using the record dates of the medical codes. Dialysis treatments were warranted during the waiting time for KT. Finally, the causes of mortality were not fully obtained (for example, some patients died of cancers, infections or cardiovascular diseases).\nIn conclusion, the present data reveal notable differences in the long- term cardiovascular outcomes among groups with stratified KT waiting times after ESRD in selected patients receiving uncomplicated KT. Compared with late uncomplicated KT, early uncomplicated KT is strongly associated with superior clinical and survival outcomes; if this association is assumed to be causal, these data suggest that KT should be performed as early\nFigure 5 Kaplan- Meier analysis for non- fatal stroke. KaplanMeier survival analysis indicates no statistical difference in the cumulative incidence of non- fatal stroke among the four KT groups during the 17- year observational period. Late KT (KT waiting time >6 years) represented by the grey line indicates the least favourable outcome of non- fatal stroke during the late observational years. In addition, the other lines are not separated during the observational period. KT, kidney transplantation.\nP atna).
