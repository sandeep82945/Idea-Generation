Hot accretion flow is the accretion model for o w-luminosity systems. The lo w-luminosity systems include lo wuminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the hard and quiescent tates of black hole X-ray binaries (see Yuan & Narayan 2014 , for a e vie w). The standard thin disc (Shakura et al. 1973 ) powers luminous ystems such as luminous AGNs and the soft state of black hole X-ray inaries. There are more and more observational pieces of evidence for he presence of winds from both hot accretion flows and cold hin discs. Indirect observational pieces of evidence of winds from ot accretion flows have been reported for low-luminosity AGNs Crenshaw & Kraemer 2012 ; Wang et al. 2013 ; Cheung et al. 016 ; Almeida et al. 2018 ; Ma et al. 2019 ; Park et al. 2019 ). ecently, winds from hot accretion flows have been directly observed\nn the low-luminosity AGN M81 (Shi et al. 2021 ). Winds from ot accretion flows are also detected in black hole X-ray binaries Homan et al. 2016 ; Munoz-Darias et al. 2019 ). Winds from cold hin discs are frequently observed for both luminous AGNs (e.g. renshaw, Kraemer & George 2003 ; Tombesi et al. 2010 , 2014 ; Liu t al. 2013 ; Gofford et al. 2015 ; King & Pounds 2015 ; He et al.\nE-mail: dfbu@shao.ac.cn (D-FB); yangxh@cqu.edu.cn (X-HY)\nw Y l\n2022 The Author(s). ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

The production mechanisms and properties of winds from hot ccretion flows have been intensiv ely inv estigated (e.g. Narayan et al. 012 ; Yuan, Bu & Wu 2012 ; Yuan et al. 2015 ; Bu & Gan 2018 ). It s found that winds are launched and accelerated by the combination f gas pressure gradient, magnetic pressure gradient, and centrifugal orces.\nFor a cold thin disc, there are three main mechanisms to produce inds. They are thermal (Begelman, McKee & Shields 1983 ; Woods\nt al. 1996 ), magnetic (Blandford & Payne 1982 ), and radiation ine force (Murray et al. 1995 ) mechanisms. The radiation line orce mechanism has been studied by numerical simulations (Proga, tone & Kallman 2000 ; Nomura et al. 2016 ; Nomura & Ohsuga 017 ; Nomura, Ohsuga & Done 2020 ). It is found that line force can f fecti vely dri ve high-speed winds from the inner region (inside 100 chwarzschild radius) of a cold thin accretion disc. The ultra-fast utflows (UFOs) that found in luminous AGNs (Tombesi et al. 2010 ) re believed to be driven by line force (Nomura et al. 2016 ; Nomura & hsuga 2017 ; Yang 2021a ; Yang, Ablimit & Li 2021b ). Zhu & tone ( 2018 ) use numerical simulations to investigate the magnetic riven winds mechanism from a thin disc. It is found that very weak inds can be magnetically driven from a thin disc. Yang ( 2021a ) and ang et al. ( 2021b ) investigate winds driven simultaneously by both ine force and magnetic field.

They lso find that the UFOs in radio-loud AGNs may be driven by the ombination of line and Lorentz forces.\nAll the abo v e-mentioned simulations studying both hot accretion ows and cold thin discs have a very limited computational doain. The outer boundary is usually located at several hundreds\nr thousands Schwarzschild radius. When winds generated by the ccretion flows/discs cross the outer radial boundary to large radii, he dynamics of winds cannot be answered by the simulations. For xample, how far can winds arrive? How does the kinetic power of inds evolve? These questions are important for AGNs feedback tudy. It is widely believed that winds play a significant role in the nteraction between the AGNs and their host galaxies (e.g. Ciotti, striker & Proga 2010 ; Ostriker et al. 2010 ; Ciotti et al. 2017 ; einberger et al. 2017 ; Yuan et al. 2018 ; Chen et al. 2022 ; He t al. 2022 ). Winds can very ef fecti vely af fect the properties of the as surrounding the AGNs (Yuan et al. 2018 ). In order to study the inds feedback, we have to know the properties of the winds at large cale. Cui et al. ( 2020a ) and Cui, Yuan & Li ( 2020b ) study the ropagation of winds at large scale by analytical and simulation ethods. The y inv estigate winds both from hot accretion flows and old thin discs. In their works, the inner radial boundary is located t 3000 Schwarzschild radius. They inject winds from the inner oundary. The properties of the injected winds generated by hot ccretion flows are set according to the simulation results of Yuan t al. ( 2015 ). The properties of the injected winds generated by a hin disc are taken from observations (Gofford et al. 2015 ). There re several assumptions in their work. First, radiation pressure is eglected. This assumption is suitable for winds from hot accretion ows because radiation of hot accretion flows is weak. However, or winds from cold thin discs, this assumption is problematic. s mentioned abo v e, radiation line force plays an important role n driving winds process. When winds propagate at large-scale, ine force may continuously accelerate winds. Cui et al. ( 2020b ) how that when winds from cold thin discs have negative Bernoulli arameter, it will just propagate a very short distance from the njected inner boundary of their simulations. This result may be ue to the neglect of radiation line force. If radiation line force is ncluded, winds from cold thin discs may propagate to very large radii v en the y initially hav e a ne gativ e Bernoulli parameter. Secondly, the adiative cooling is neglected. This assumption is suitable for winds rom hot accretion flows because of the low radiative efficiency f hot accretion flo ws. Ho we ver, winds from cold thin discs have uch higher density and correspondingly strong radiative cooling, he neglect of radiative cooling may be problematic. It is very ecessary to study the large-scale dynamics of winds from cold thin iscs. In this paper, we perform numerical simulations to study the largecale dynamics of winds driven by line force. In our simulations, both adiation pressure force and radiative cooling/heating are included.\ne first simulate the radiation line force driven winds in a dynamical ange of 30\u20131500 r s . After a quasi-steady state is formed, we timeverage the properties of winds. Then, we perform simulations in a ynamic range of 1500\u201310 6 r s . Winds are injected into the compuational domain at 1500 r s . The properties of the injected winds are rom the time-averaged value of winds at 1500 r s from the small-scale imulations.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , we describe our odels and methods. In Section 3 , the results are presented. We\niscuss the limitations of this work in Section 4 . A summary is resented in Section 5 .\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nM O D E L A N D M E T H O D\n.1 Basic equations\ne employ spherical coordinates ( r , \u03b8 , \u03c6) and use PLUTO code Mignone et al. 2007 , 2012 ; Yang et al. 2021b ) to solve the ydrodynamics equations as follows (Proga et al. 2000 )\nd \u03c1 d t + \u03c1\u2207 \u00b7 \u03c5 = 0 , (1)\nd \u03c5 d t = \u2212\u2207 P \u2212 \u03c1\u2207 \u03c8 + \u03c1 F rad , (2)\nd\nd t ( e \u03c1 ) = \u2212P \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c5 + \u03c1\u03b6. (3)\nere, \u03c1, \u03c5, P , e , and \u03c8 are density , velocity , gas pressure, internal nergy, and gravitational potential, respectively. F rad is the radiation ressure force on unit mass including Compton scattering and line orce. \u03b6 denotes the net cooling/heating rate. We employ an adiabatic quation of state P = ( \u03b3 \u2212 1) e with \u03b3 = 5/3. We apply the pseudoewtonian potential, \u03c8 = \u2212GM BH /( r c \u2212 r s ) (P aczy \u0301nsk y & Wiita 980 ), where M BH , G , r s , and r c are the BH mass, the gravitational onstant, the Schwarzschild radius, and the distance from a point to he black hole, respectively. The calculation of net cooling/heating ate \u03b6 is referred to Proga et al. ( 2000 ).\n.2 Model set-up\nGNs are powered by accretion disc around a central black hole. e assume that the accretion disc mainly emits ultraviolet (UV)\nhotons. There is also a very compact hot corona abo v e and below he central black hole (e.g. Uttley et al. 2014 ). The hot corona radiates -rays. In this paper, we assume that the hot corona is spherically istributed around the central black hole. The X-rays from the corona an irradiate the accretion disc. The radiation intensity from the urface of the accretion disc is given by Proga, Stone & Drew 1998 )\nD ( r D ) = 3 GM BH M\u0307 a 8 \u03c02 r 3 \u2217 ( r 3 \u2217 r 3 D [ 1 \u2212 ( r \u2217 r D )1 / 2 ] +\nf x 3 \u03c0 \u23a7 \u23a8 \u23a9 arcsin r \u2217r D \u2212 r \u2217 r D [ 1 \u2212 ( r \u2217 r D )2 ] 1 / 2 \u23ab \u23ac \u23ad \u239e \u23a0 , (4)\nhere M\u0307 a is the mass accretion rate of the accretion disc, r \u2217 is the nner edge of the disc, and r \u2217 = 3 r s , r D is the radial position on he disc surface measured from the central black hole. f x denotes he radio of the X-ray luminosity from the corona to the disc uminosity. The ef fecti ve temperature is T eff = ( \u03c0 I D ( r D )/ \u03c3 ) 1/4 , with\nbeing the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant. When we calculate the disc adiation using equation ( 4 ), we only consider the region that has n ef fecti ve temperature higher than 3000 K contributing to the line orce.\nThe total disc luminosity is L D = \u03b5L edd = GM BH M\u0307 a / 6 r s , with \u03b5 eing the Eddington ratio. Observationally, there is a relationship etween the X-ray and UV emissions in AGNs (Lusso & Risaliti 016 ). In general, more luminous AGNs will have fainter X-rays. e refer to Yang et al. ( 2021b ) for the detailed calculation of the -ray luminosity based on the disc luminosity. The gas abo v e the thin disc is irradiated by both the spherically istributed X-ray photons from the corona and the UV photons from he accretion disc surface. We put the surface of the accretion disc on he plane of \u03b8 = \u03c0 /2.

For the radiation pressure-dominated inner egion of the accretion disc, the scale height does not vary much ith radius. Therefore, for simplicity, we assume that the disc scale eight is a constant of radius. The scale height of the disc is 3.1 \u03b5r s Nomura & Ohsuga 2017 ). In this paper, we also adopt this value. hus, the black hole is located at r = 3.1 \u03b5r s , \u03b8 = \u03c0 . The calculation of the radiation force is referred to appendix in roga et al. ( 1998 ) and the multiplier ( M ) of line force is referred to quations (11)\u2013(16) in Proga et al. ( 2000 ).\n.3 Computational domain and boundary conditions\ne first simulate the line force driven winds for various black hole asses and luminosities in a radial range from 30 to 1500 r s . In these mall-scale simulations, we set the accretion disc properties at the id-plane and the initial gas abo v e the mid-plane as follows. The ensity of the surface of the accretion disc is set according to the tandard thin discs model (Nomura & Ohsuga 2017 )\n( \u03b8 = \u03c0/ 2) =\n\u23a7 \u23aa \u23aa \u23aa \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23aa \u23aa \u23aa \u23a9 5 . 24 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ( M BH M )\u22121 ( \u03b5 \u03b7 )\u22122 ( r r s )3 / 2 g cm \u22123 , for r \u2264 18 ( M BH M )2 / 21 ( \u03b5 \u03b7 )16 / 21 r s 4 . 66 ( M BH M )\u22127 / 10 ( \u03b5 \u03b7 )2 / 5 ( r r s )\u221233 / 20 g cm \u22123 , for r > 18 (\nM BH M )2 / 21 ( \u03b5 \u03b7 )16 / 21 r s\n(5)\nith M and \u03b7 = 0.0833 being solar mass and energy conversion ate, respectively. The temperature of the disc surface is set to the f fecti ve temperature. We assume that the initial gas above the thin isc is locally isothermal with T ( r , \u03b8 ) = T eff ( r sin \u03b8 ). We assume that nitially the gas abo v e the thin disc is in hydrostatic equilibrium. herefore, its density can be written as \u03c1( r, \u03b8 ) = \u03c1( \u03b8 = \u03c0/ 2) exp (\n\u2212 GM BH 2 c 2 s r tan 2 \u03b8\n) . (6)\ne assume that initially the poloidal velocity of the gas abo v e the isc is zero ( \u03c5r = \u03c5\u03b8 = 0). The rotational velocity is set as \u03c5\u03c6( r , ) = ( GM BH / r ) 1/2 sin ( \u03b8 ) r /( r \u2212 r s ) to meet the equilibrium between he black hole gravity and the centrifugal force. For these smallcale simulations, at both the inner and outer radial boundary, we mploy outflow boundary conditions. Axis-of-symmetry boundary onditions are applied at the pole \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6.\nAfter the quasi-steady state is achiev ed, we time-av erage the imulation data to get the properties of gas (including both winds nd inflow) at r = 1500 r s .\nFor the large-scale simulations, our computational domain is from .5 \u00d7 10 3 to 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 r s . At the inner boundary (1500 r s ), the physical ariables (density , velocity , internal energy) are set equaling to the ime-averaged values from the small-scale simulations at 1500 r s . or such settings, winds are injected into the computational domain rom the inner radial boundary. For the outer radial boundary, we mploy outflow boundary conditions. We employ axis-of-symmetry nd equator-of-symmetry boundary conditions at the pole \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 and he equatorial plane \u03b8 = 90 \u25e6, respectively. Note that we do not put n accretion disc at the mid-plane in these large-scale simulations. nitially, low-density gas is put in the computational domain with 0 ( r) = 2 . 25 \u00d7 10 \u221214 r 2 s /r 2 . The initial gas density is too low to ffect the dynamics of the winds injected from the inner radial oundary. The initial gas has zero velocity. We employ non-uniform grids to discretize the computational omain. For the small-scale simulations, our resolution is 144 \u00d7 160. or the large-scale simulations, our resolution is 300 \u00d7 160. In the\nadial direction, we use non-uniform grids to resolve the inner region. e set ( r ) i + 1 /( r ) i = 1.04. For the grids in the \u03b8 direction, we set he grids as follows. There are the 16 zones uniformly distributed o v er he angular range of 0 \u25e6\u201315 \u25e6 while the 144 zones are non-uniformly istributed o v er the angular range of 15 \u25e6\u201390 \u25e6 in the \u03b8 direction. The ngular size ratio is ( \u03b8 ) i + 1 /( \u03b8 ) i = 0.970072 to achieve good patial resolution near the disc surface.\n.4 Calculation of the optical depth\nefore defining the optical depth, we first define the ionization arameter of gas\n= 4 \u03c0F X n , (7)\nhere F X is the X-ray flux and n is the number density of the gas. For the small-scale simulations, we calculate the optical depth for he X-ray \u03c4X ( r , \u03b8 ) from the corona and the optical depth for the UV adiation \u03c4UV ( r , \u03b8 ) from the accretion disc as follows\nX ( r, \u03b8 ) = \u222b r\n30 r s\n\u03c3X \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 , (8)\nUV ( r, \u03b8 ) = \u222b r\n30 r s\n\u03c3e \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 . (9)\nIn the large-scale simulations, both the X-ray and UV photons are rom small scale. Therefore, in order to calculate the optical depths in arge-scale simulations, we first need to calculate the optical depths cross the entire domain of the small-scale simulations. They are alculated as\n0 ,X ( \u03b8 ) = \u222b 1500 r s\n30 r s\n\u03c3X \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 , (10)\n0 , UV ( \u03b8 ) = \u222b 1500 r s\n30 r s\n\u03c3e \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 , (11)\nis the time-averaged density for the small-scale simulations. Thus, the optical depths for the X-ray and UV photons in the\narge-scale simulations are written as X ( r, \u03b8 ) = \u03c40 ,X ( \u03b8 ) + \u222b r\n1500 r s\n\u03c3X \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 , (12)\nUV ( r, \u03b8 ) = \u03c40 , UV ( \u03b8 ) + \u222b r\n1500 r s\n\u03c3e \u03c1( r \u2032 , \u03b8 )d r \u2032 . (13)\nIn the abo v e equations, \u03c3 e is the mass-scattering coefficient for ree electrons and is set to be 0 . 4 g \u22121 cm 2 . As same as Proga et al. 2000 ), we set \u03c3 X = \u03c3 e for \u03be \u2265 10 5 erg cm s \u22121 and \u03c3 X = 100 \u03c3 e for < 10 5 erg cm s \u22121 in order to include the effects of photoelectronic bsorption.\nRESULTS\nhe results of the small-scale simulations in the range of 30\u20131500 s have been discussed by Nomura et al. ( 2016 ), Nomura & Ohsuga 2017 ), Yang ( 2021a ), and Yang et al. ( 2021b ). Therefore, we do ot introduce them here. In this paper, we focus on the large-scale ropagation of the winds driven by line force. The purpose of carrying ut small-scale simulations is to provide inner boundary conditions or the large-scale simulations.\nThe general results are summarized in Table 1 .

From Table 1 , we can see that for most of the models except model RHD63), the mass flux of the winds measured at the uter radial boundary of the small-scale simulations roughly equals o that measured at the outer boundary of the large-scale simulations. his indicates that in these models, the winds generated quite close he black hole can mo v e to significantly large radii ( > 10 6 r s ). The ehaviours of the winds at large scale in these models are quite imilar. We just take model RHD86 as a fiducial model to illustrate he large-scale dynamics of the winds in these models. It is also lear that for the model RHD63, the winds generated close to the lack hole cannot mo v e to large radii. In the following, we will also iscuss why in model RHD63, the large-scale dynamic of the winds s different. .1 Fiducial model RHD86 ig. 1 shows the time-averaged density (colour) and velocity (arrows) or model RHD86. Left-hand panel is for small-scale simulations nd right-hand panel is for large-scale simulations. As found by roga et al. ( 2000 ) and Nomura et al. ( 2016 ), the line force driven inds mainly come from the region inside 200 r s (left-hand panel). he winds are located in an angular region of \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6. When the inds mo v e to large radii ( > 1500 r s ), their angular locations do not\nhange. It is clear that the radial velocity of the winds at radius 10 5 r s is uch larger than that of the winds at 1500 r s . This indicates that the inds are accelerated when the y mo v e in the region from 1500 to 0 5 r s . In order to show this point more clearly, we plot Fig. 2 . In his figure, we plot the time-averaged radial dependence of kinetic nergy 1/2( \u03c5/ c ) 2 and gravitational energy \u2212GM /( r \u2212 r s ) c 2 along \u03b8 = 3 \u25e6. At this angle, the winds mo v e almost radially. Therefore, we can ake Fig. 2 as the results along a streamline of the winds. The kinetic nergy of the winds is significantly larger than their gravitational nergy. Thus, the winds are unbound to the black hole potential. It s clear that the kinetic energy of the winds keeps increasing from 500 to 10 5 r s . The accelerating force is radiation line force. Outside 0 5 r s , the kinetic energy of the winds does not change with the ncreasing of radius. Therefore, the acceleration line force vanishes utside 10 5 r s . The line force is M F e , with F e being the radiation orce due to electron scattering and M being the line force multiplier. he line force multiplier is a function of both ionization parameter nd temperature of gas (Proga 2007 ).\nIn Fig. 3 , we plot the time-averaged logarithm of line force ultiplier (left-hand panel) of model RHD86. It is clear that inside\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\n0 5 r s , in the winds region ( \u03b8 > 60 \u25e6), the line force multiplier is everal orders of magnitude higher than 1. Therefore, the winds are ccelerated when they move from small to large radii inside 10 5 s . Outside \u223c10 5 r s , the line force multiplier is negligibly small. n order to find out the reason why outside 10 5 r s in the winds egion ( \u03b8 > 60 \u25e6), the line force multiplier is negligible, we plot he right-hand panel of Fig. 3 . This panel plots the logarithm of as temperature. As shown in this panel, outside 10 5 r s in the winds egion ( \u03b8 > 60 \u25e6), the gas temperature is higher than 10 5 K. Thus, the ine force is negligible outside 10 5 r s , and the winds move outwards ith constant velocity. We point out that the high-temperature of as is due to photoionization heating by the X-rays. We check he simulation data and find that the high-temperature region and igh-ionization parameter region are almost overlapped. In other ords, X-ray photoionization is the primary reason for the small orce multiplier. Fig. 4 shows the time-averaged radial profiles of the winds ass flux (left-hand panel), momentum flux (middle panel), and inetic energy flux (right-hand panel) for model RHD86. The mass ux, momentum flux, and kinetic energy flux are calculated as ollows\n\u02d9 w ( r) = 4 \u03c0r 2 \u222b 89 \u25e6 0 \u25e6 \u03c1 max ( \u03c5r , 0) sin \u03b8d \u03b8, (14)\n\u02d9 w ( r) = 4 \u03c0r 2 \u222b 89 \u25e6 0 \u25e6 \u03c1 max ( \u03c52 r , 0) sin \u03b8d \u03b8, (15)\n\u02d9 w ( r) = 4 \u03c0r 2 \u222b 89 \u25e6 0 \u25e6 1 2 \u03c1 max ( \u03c53 r , 0) sin \u03b8d \u03b8. (16)\nn these calculations, the integrations stop at \u03b8 = 89 \u25e6 to exclude the ontribution of the accretion disc at the mid-plane.\nThe mass flux is a constant with radius, which indicates that all f the winds generated at small scale (inside 200 r s ) can escape o large radii. They do not stop at the outer radial boundary of ur simulations. The winds can mo v e out of the AGNs to interact ith the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies. Both the omentum flux and kinetic power of the winds keep increasing from 500 to 10 5 r s due to the acceleration by line force. Outside 10 5 r s , he acceleration vanishes and the momentum flux and kinetic power o not change with the increase of radius. The kinetic power of he winds is significantly higher than 0 . 5 per cent of the Eddington uminosity; therefore, the winds can gi ve suf ficient feedback to their ost galaxies (e.g. Di Matteo, Springel & Hernquist 2005 ; Hopkins & lvis 2010 ; Ostriker et al. 2010 ).\nFigure 1.

Models with higher ddington ratio of radiation flux have stronger winds. In the models ith \u03b5 = 0.6, the mass flux of the winds exceeds 10 per cent of he Eddington accretion rate. Also, the kinetic energy flux of the inds measured exceeds 1 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. In\nhe models with \u03b5 = 0.3, the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy uxes (in unit of Eddington values) are smaller. This is easy to nderstand that stronger radiation flux can drive stronger winds. he dependence of the winds properties on black hole mass is enerally that the smaller the black hole mass is, the weaker the inds will be. Giustini & Proga ( 2019 ) also find that the smaller lack hole mass will produce weaker winds. The reasons are as ollows. The temperature of the accretion disc \u221d I 1 / 4 D , and the ccretion disc radiation intensity depends on black hole mass (see quation 4 ). For a larger M BH \u2265 10 8 M , the peak disc temperaure is around optical/UV; while for a smaller M BH \u2264 10 8 M , it\no v es to far-UV/soft X-ray regime. Therefore, smaller black hole ill produce relatively weaker UV flux and stronger X-ray flux. eaker UV flux will e x ert weaker line force, and stronger X-ray\nux will o v erionize gas to a level where line force is no longer f fecti ve.\nFor most of the models (except model RHD63), the evolutions of he dynamics of the winds at large scale are quite similar, which have een explained by using the fiducial model RHD86.\nIn model RHD63, the mass flux of the winds (in unit of Eddington ass flux) is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the inds in other models. Also, from Table 1 , it is clear that the mass ux of the winds measured at 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 r s is almost one order of agnitude smaller than that measured at 1500 r s . About 90 per cent\nf the winds generated close to the black hole cannot mo v e to large adii. In the following, we give the reasons.\nWe plot some time-averaged properties of model RHD63 in Fig. 5 . omparing the upper left panel of this figure to the left-hand panel f Fig. 1 , we can see that the velocity of the winds in model RHD63 s almost one order of magnitude smaller than that of the winds in odel RHD86. The velocity of the winds in the region \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6 is ven smaller. The usually adopted criterion to judge whether winds an escape is the Bernoulli parameter, which is defined as follows\ne = 1 2\n( \u03c52 r + \u03c52 \u03b8 + \u03c52 \u03c6 ) + \u03b3P ( \u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03c1 \u2212 GM BH r \u2212 r c . (17)\nThe upper right panel of Fig. 5 shows the Bernoulli parameter n unit of gravitational energy. It can be seen that in the region \u03b8 45 \u25e6, the winds have a negative Bernoulli parameter. If there is no urther acceleration, the winds cannot escape and mo v e to large radii. he ne gativ e Bernoulli parameter is due to the fact that the velocity or kinetic energy) of the winds is too small. The middle left panel f Fig. 5 shows the line force multiplier, it is obvious that the line orce multiplier in the region 0 \u25e6\u201377 \u25e6 is almost 0. The reason is that he gas temperature in this region (middle right panel) significantly igher than 10 5 K. The bottom left panel shows the logarithm of he radiation flux in unit of L edd /4 \u03c0r 2 from the accretion disc. The adiation flux in unit of L edd /4 \u03c0r 2 equals the ratio of the radiation orce due to electron scattering to the gravity. In the region \u03b8 > 77 \u25e6, he line force multiplier can be much large. Ho we ver, in this region, he radiation flux (in unit of L edd /4 \u03c0r 2 ) is smaller than 10 \u22125 . The adiation force due to electron scattering is more than 5 orders of\nMNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nM\nFigure 3.

Even though, in this region, we have he multiplier of several hundreds, the line force is still significantly maller than gravity. Therefore, the winds in the region \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6 annot be ef fecti ve accelerated by radiation pressure either due to he negligible line force multiplier (in the region 45 \u25e6 < \u03b8 < 77 \u25e6) r due to the negligible radiation flux (in the region \u03b8 > 77 \u25e6). The inds in the region \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6 are gravitationally bound to the central lack hole. From the velocity vector of top right panel in Fig. 5 , the inds in this region are much like the outwards moving part of some urbulent eddies. The bottom right panel of Fig. 5 shows the \u03b8 direction profile of the\nime-averaged mass flux of the winds at 1500 r s . It is clear that most of he mass flux is in the region \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6. As explained above, the winds n the region ( \u03b8 > 45 \u25e6) are gravitationally bound to the black hole. If he winds in this region cannot be accelerated by radiation pressure n the region r > 1500 r s , they will not escape and fall back. Fig. 6 hows the time-averaged logarithm of line force multiplier (left-hand anel) and gas temperature (right-hand panel) in the region r > 1500 s for model RHD63. It is clear that at large radii ( r > 1500 r s ), the ine force multiplier is only important in a very limited region close o the mid-plane. In other region, the temperature of gas significantly xceeds 10 5 K, so that the force multiplier is negligible. In the region here line force multiplier is large, the radiation flux is small, and he radiation pressure is not important. Therefore, outside 1500 r s , he winds cannot be continuously accelerated. As listed in Table 1 , in odel RHD63, about 90 per cent of the winds generated close to the lack hole cannot mo v e to large radii. The kinetic power of the winds n this model is several order of magnitude lower than 0 . 5 per cent\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nf the Eddington luminosity. The winds cannot provide sufficient eedback to their host galaxies.\n.3 Comparison to obser v ations\ne find that the ionization parameter of the winds changes with ime. The reasons are as follows. All of the winds materials come rom the mid-plane accretion disc. In order to form the winds, he gas should be first puffed up from the accretion disc by line orce. If there is blocking gas located between the puffed-up gas nd the central black hole, the X-rays will be blocked and the uffed-up gas will have lower ionization parameter. In this case, he puffed-up gas will be accelerated to high velocity. When the locking gas disappears, the high-velocity winds will be exposed to he central X-rays. The high-velocity winds become highly ionized. ecause of the turbulent nature of the flow, the blocking gas is ot hard to form. The blocking gas can both appear and disapear with time. Therefore, the ionization parameter changes with ime.\nUFO absorbers have been found in hard X-ray bands in 40 per cent of nearby AGNs (Pounds et al. 2003 ; Tombesi et al.\n010 , 2011 ; Tombesi, Cappi & Reeves 2012 ; Gofford et al. 2013 , 015 ; Laha et al. 2021 ). We define the UFOs found in hard X-ray ands as H-UFOs. Their properties are as follows. The velocity s in the range of \u03c5 \u223c 0.03\u20130.3 c . The ionization parameter is n the range of \u03be \u223c 10 3 \u201310 6 erg cm s \u22121 . The column density is in he range of 10 22 cm \u22122 \u2264 N H \u2264 10 24 cm \u22122 .

It is found that the H-UFOs may be driven from accretion isc by line force (Nomura et al. 2016 ; Nomura & Ohsuga 2017 ; ang et al. 2021b ). In our small-scale simulations, we do find that -UFOs are present. The H-UFOs correspond to the winds which t the observational epoch have high-ionization parameter. Gofford t al. ( 2015 ) analyse the observational data of H-UFOs in a sample.\nhey find the mass flux of H-UFOs M\u0307 H\u2212UFOs \u221d L 0 . 9 D and the kinetic ower of H-UFOs E\u0307 H\u2212UFOs \u221d L 1 . 5 D . We also calculate the mass ux and kinetic power of the H-UFOs based on our small-scale imulations. At each snapshot, we first find out winds that satisfy he conditions of H-UFOs. Then, we calculate their mass flux and inetic power. Finally, we time-average the mass flux and the kinetic\nMNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nM\nFigur e 6.

The results are shown in Fig. 7 . In this figure, the asterisks orrespond to our simulations. The solid line is the fitting power-law unction. It is clear that except model RHD63, all other models can e well described by the fitting power-law function. The power-law nde x es are almost same as those given by observations (Gofford t al. 2015 ). Moreo v er, Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ) find the similar esults. Therefore, the H-UFOs are quite probably driven by line orce. In addition to H-UFOs found in hard X-ray bands, UFOs have also een found in the soft X-ray bands (e.g. Gupta et al. 2013 ; Gupta, athur & Krongold 2015 ; Longinotti et al. 2015 ; Pounds et al. 2016 ; eeves et al. 2016 ; Serafinelli et al. 2019 ). We define the UFOs in oft X-ray bands as S-UFOs. The S-UFOs have velocity \u03c5 \u223c 0.1\u20130.2 , ionization parameter log \u03be \u223c< 2 erg cm s \u22121 and column density H \u223c 10 20 \u201310 22 cm \u22122 . The locations of the S-UFOs are quite hard o be constrained. The S-UFOs may be located around (Reeves et al. 016 ) or outside (Serafinelli et al. 2019 ) parsec scale. Serafinelli t al. ( 2019 ) propose that the S-UFOs are generated by the interaction etween H-UFOs and the ISM. The S-UFOs are the entrained ISM y the H-UFOs.\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nIn this paper, we investigate another possibility that S-UFOs are ctually the winds driven by line force. As mentioned abo v e, in he small-scale simulations, we find that the ionization parameter f the winds can change with time. The S-UFOs may correspond o the winds which at the observational epoch have low-ionization arameter. In order to test this idea, we plot Fig. 8 . This figure shows he view angle ( \u03b8 ) dependence of column density and velocity of the inds. When plotting this figure, the column density is obtained by ntegration from 30\u201310 6 r s . It can be seen that in most models (except HD63), we can observe low ionization \u03be < 10 2 erg cm s \u22121 winds. he low-ionization winds have velocity \u03c5 \u223c 0.1\u20130.3 c and column ensity N H \u223c 10 20 \u201310 22 cm \u22122 . The properties of the low-ionization inds are in the right property scope of the observed S-UFOs. By bservations, one can obtain the ionization parameter, velocity, and olumn density of winds. Ho we ver, it is quite hard to estimate the ass flux of winds observationally. The reason is that in order to uantify the mass flux, one needs to know the co v ering and volume lling factors of winds. The co v ering factor is usually set to be equal o the ratio of the sources that show winds to the total sources of the ample. The volume filling factor cannot be well constrained.

Therefore, we cannot directly compare the ass flux of the S-UFOs found in this paper to observations. We can ust conclude that there is possibility that the observed S-UFOs are ust the low-ionization accretion disc winds.\nSlowly moving (100\u20132000 km s \u22121 ) warm absorber outflows are ommon phenomena of AGNs (e.g. Canizares & Kruper 1984 ; Sako t al. 2001 ; Blustin, Page & Branduardi-Raymont 2004 ; Reeves et al. 004 ; Blustin et al. 2005 ; McKernan, Yaqoob & Reynolds 2007 ; aha et al. 2016 ). Recently, by performing simulations, we find that hen H-UFOs mo v e to parsec scale, they can collide with ISM and ransfer their momentum to ISM. The properties of the ISM after olliding with H-UFOs are quite similar as those of warm absorbers. e conclude that the warm absorber outflows may be the accelerated SM by the H-UFOs (Bu & Yang 2021 ).\nDISCUSSIONS\nn this paper, we time-average the simulation results at the outer oundary of the small-scale simulations. As mentioned abo v e, in he small-scale simulations, both high- and low-ionization winds are resent. The high-ionization winds usually have low density. The ow-ionization winds usually have high density. At a snapshot, at a iven location, there are the high-ionization winds. At another snaphot, the low-ionization winds may occupy this location. Therefore, if e do the time-average, the information of the high-ionization winds an be remo v ed due to its low density . Therefore, actually , in the inner adial boundary of our large-scale simulations, we mainly inject the ow-ionization winds. In other words, in the large-scale simulations, e mainly study the dynamics of the low-ionization winds. The largecale dynamics of the high-ionization winds have not been studied n this paper. In order to properly study the large-scale dynamics f both low- and high-ionization winds simultaneously, one should arry out simulations with inner radial boundary located at close to he black hole and outer radial boundary located at far beyond parsec cale. Ho we ver, such simulations are too expensive to be carried ut. Therefore, we must keep in mind that based on this paper, we annot hav e an y conclusion about the large-scale dynamics of highonization winds from the small-scale accretion disc.\nIn this paper, as down by Proga et al. ( 2000 ) and Nomura & hsuga ( 2017 ), we set \u03c3 X = \u03c3 e for \u03be \u2265 10 5 erg cm s \u22121 and \u03c3 X = 00 \u03c3 e for \u03be < 10 5 erg cm s \u22121 . In Proga & Kallman ( 2004 ), they et \u03c3 X = \u03c3 e for entire range of \u03be . Nomura et al. ( 2020 ) compare he results of the two methods. They find that both of the mass ux and the velocity of winds differ roughly by a factor of 2. o we ver, we note that both of the two methods are arbitrary. In his paper, the scattered and reprocessed photons are neglected. In eality, the scattered and the reprocessed photons should also affect he properties of winds. F or e xample, Higginbottom et al. ( 2014 ) nd that the scattered photons can also ionize gas, which can make he gas too highly ionized to be driven by line force. Ho we ver, e note that radiative transfer and hydrodynamics are decoupled in igginbottom et al. ( 2014 ). Therefore, in future, it is necessary to erform hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer to study he effects of the scattered and reprocessed photons.\nIn addition, we only consider the large-scale dynamics of accretion isc winds driven by line force. In reality, the magnetic field is l w ays be present and responsible for angular momentum transfer f the accretion disc. The properties of the winds in the presence of agnetic field should be different (Cui et al. 2020a ; Yang 2021a ; ang et al. 2021b ). In future, we plan to study the large-scale ynamics of winds driven by line force and Lorentz force.\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nSUMMARY\ne carry out 2D simulations to study the large-scale dynamics of ccretion disc winds driven by line force. The disc winds are launched rom inside hundreds of Schwarzschild. We study whether the winds an mo v e to large scale and what the properties of the winds will e at large scale. By large scale, we mean around or larger than arsec scale. It is currently impossible to perform simulations with he inner boundary close to the black hole and outer boundary around arsec scale. Therefore, we divide the space scale into two parts. We erform both small-scale and large-scale simulations. For the smallcale simulations, our computational domain is 30 r s \u2264 r \u2264 1500 s . The winds are produced in the small-scale simulations. For our arge-scale simulations, the computational domain is 1500 r s \u2264 r\n1.5 \u00d7 10 6 r s . In the large-scale simulations, we inject winds at he inner radial boundary (1500 r s ). The properties of the injected inds are obtained by the small-scale simulations. By using the arge-scale simulations, we can study the large-scale dynamics of inds. We find that both the black hole mass and the accretion disc uminosity can affect the properties of the winds driven by line force. n our models, the black hole mass is in the range 10 6 \u201310 9 M . The ccretion disc luminosity is set to 0.3 ( \u03b5 = 0.3) and 0.6 ( \u03b5 = 0.6) imes the Eddington luminosity.\nFor the case \u03b5 = 0.6, we find that independent of the black ole mass, the winds have mass flux exceeding 10 per cent the ddington accretion rate and kinetic energy flux exceeding 1 per cent he Eddington luminosity. We also find that in this case, the accretion isc winds can go to outside 10 6 r s . When arriving 10 6 r s , the kinetic nergy flux of the winds slightly increases compared to that at the aunching point. The increase of the kinetic energy flux is due to the ine force acceleration when the winds mo v e outwards. The winds an have sufficient feedback to their host galaxies due to their high inetic energy flux (e.g. Di Matteo et al. 2005 ; Hopkins & Elvis 010 ). For the case \u03b5 = 0.3, the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy uxes of the winds are smaller than those in the case \u03b5 = 0.6. We lso find that for \u03b5 = 0.3, the strength of the winds decreases with the ecrease of black hole mass. F or e xample, if we set black hole mass o be 10 8 M and 10 9 M , the mass flux is roughly 6 per cent of the ddington accretion rate; the kinetic energy flux is roughly 1 per cent he Eddington luminosity. For these two black hole masses, all the inds can mo v e to the re gion outside 10 6 r s . Ho we ver, when the black ole mass is 10 7 M , the winds mass flux is significantly decreased o 1 per cent of the Eddington accretion rate, and the kinetic energy ux is decreased to 0 . 2 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. For his black hole mass, we also find that the winds can mo v e to the egion outside 10 6 r s . If we further decrease the black hole mass o 10 6 M , the mass flux of the winds is decreased to 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ddington accretion rate, and the kinetic energy is almost 6 orders of agnitude smaller than the Eddington luminosity. Also, with black ole mass 10 6 M , about 90 per cent of the winds cannot mo v e to arge radii. Therefore, for the case \u03b5 = 0.3, when black hole mass is\n10 7 M , the winds cannot provide sufficient feedback to their host alaxies.\nThe ionization parameter of the winds changes with time. The FOs observed in hard X-ray band may correspond to winds which at he observational epoch have high ionization parameter. We compare ur simulation results to observations. We find that, for the UFOs ound in hard X-ray bands, their observed dependence of kinetic ower and mass flux on the accretion disc luminosity (Gofford et al. 015 ) can be well produced by the line force driven winds model. his indicates that the UFOs found in hard X-ray band are very\np b h r o o f X f\nA\nD 1 C ( N 1 S b\nD\nT t\nR\nH A\nB B B B\nB B C C\nC C C C C C C D D G G\nG\nG G H H H\nH\nK\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL M M M\nM\nM M N\nN N N N\nO P P\nP\nP\nP P P P R\nR\nS S\nS S T\nT\nT T U\nW W W\nY Y Y\nY\nY Y Y Z\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/1/1141/6567864 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nrobably driven by line force. The UFOs observed in soft X-ray and may correspond to winds which at the observational epoch ave low-ionization parameter. We also compare our simulation esults to the UFOs found in soft X-ray bands. It is found that the bserved properties (column density , velocity , ionization parameter) f the UFOs in soft X-ray bands can be well explained by the line orce driven winds model. Therefore, the observed UFOs in soft -ray bands are probably the accretion disc winds driven by line orce.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nB was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 2173065).

There are three main differences f the settings of the previous simulation. The first one is the density f the accretion disc at the mid-plane. Some works assume that he density of the accretion disc is constant and does not vary with adius (Proga et al. 2000 ; Proga & Kallman 2004 ; Yang et al. 2021b ). omura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ) set the density of the accretion disc at the id-plane according to the accretion disc theory. We set the same ccretion disc density as Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ) (see equation 5 ). he second one is the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the accretion isc luminosity (the parameter f x ). Some works assume that the value f f x is fixed, which is independent from both the black hole mass and he accretion disc luminosity (e.g. Proga et al. 2000 ; Proga & Kallman 004 ;Nomura & Ohsuga 2017 ). Yang et al. ( 2021b ) calculate the alue of f x according to both black hole mass and accretion disc uminosity. The setting of f x in this paper is the same as Yang et al. 2021b ). The third one is the disc radiation contributing the line orce. In Proga & Kallman ( 2004 ) and Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ), he disc radiation between 200 and 3200 \u00c5 is contributing line force cceleration. In this paper (see also Proga et al. 2000 and Yang\nNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\nigure A2. Time-averaged mass flux (left-hand panel), momentum flux (middle pa t RHD86. The black lines correspond to f x = 0.06, which is calculated by referrin ines correspond to f x = 0.1.\nt al. 2021b ), it is assumed that radiation from high-temperature egion, in which the ef fecti ve temperature is larger than 3000 K, ontributes the line force. We take model RHD86 as an example o illustrate that the two methods give roughly the similar radiation uminosity contributing the line force. The disc luminosity calculated y assuming all the radiation from the disc region with ef fecti ve emperature higher than 3000 K is 0.59 L edd (model RHD86). When e keep other parameters (black hole mass, bolometric luminosity) ame, we find that the disc luminosity between 200 and 3200 \u00c5 is 0.45 edd . Therefore, the difference of the disc luminosity calculated by he two methods differs by a factor smaller than 2. In their appendix, omura et al. ( 2020 ) also find that the mass flux of winds roughly inearly depends on the disc radiation flux. Therefore, the slight ifference of disc radiation obtained between the two methods will ot significantly affect the wind properties. We take model RHD83 as an example to compare our results to he results in previous works. In model RHD83, the black hole mass s 10 8 M ; the value of f x \u223c 0.09; the accretion disc luminosity is .3 L edd . Also, in this model the density of the accretion disc is set ccording to the accretion disc theory. The settings of model RHD83 re quite similar to one of models in Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ). In omura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ), they have a model for M BH = 10 8 M , x = 0.1, and L D = 0.1 L edd . Also in that model the density of the\nnel), and kinetic power (right-hand panel) of winds for different values of f x g to Yang et al. ( 2021b ), the red lines correspond to f x = 0.05, and the blue\ner on 19 January 2024\na t I v l fi w t g t a\nI ( T m a s R t c w\nA\nT t i t a ( t K w t p t s 1 w i c a d t r\nT\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/51\nccretion disc is set according to the accretion disc theory. We call hat model in Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ) as model NO17comparison. n Fig. A1 , we plot the time-averaged angular profiles of density and elocity for model RHD83. We can compare this figure to the blue ines in fig. 5 in Nomura & Ohsuga ( 2017 ). The blue lines in that gure are for model NO17comparison. The maximum velocity of inds in both model RHD83 and NO17comparison is \u223c0.18 c . Also he maximum density in both of the models is several times of 10 \u221219\ncm \u22123 . The similarity of the results in both of the models indicates hat the slight difference of numerical settings cannot significantly ffect the results.\nWe also study the effects of different values of f x on the results. n Fig. A2 , we plot the mass flux (left-hand panel), momentum flux middle panel) and kinetic energy flux (right-hand panel) of winds. he black line is for model RHD86 and the value of f x = 0.06 in this odel is calculated by equations (6)\u2013(8) in Yang et al. ( 2021b ). We lso do two test simulations. In the two test simulations, we directly et the values of f x but with other parameters same as those in model HD86. The blue ( f x = 0.1) and red ( f x = 0.05) lines correspond to he two test simulations. It can be seen from Fig. A2 that the slight hange of the value of f x has negligible effects on the properties of inds.\n2 Force multiplier\nhe force multiplier depends both on the ionization parameter and gas emperature. The dependence of force multiplier on gas temperature s given by equation (17) in Proga ( 2007 ). According to that equation, he force multiplier will be negligible when gas has temperature bo v e 10 5 K. In this paper, we do not use the equation (17) in Proga 2007 ) to constrain the force multiplier. Instead, we just assume that he force multiplier is zero when gas has temperature abo v e 10 5\n. In order to justify our method, we plot Fig. A3 . In this figure, e plot the variation of force multiplier with temperature. Because he force multiplier depends both on gas temperature and ionization arameter. When we calculate the temperature dependence, we need o fix the ionization parameter. The black solid, red solid, green olid, and blue solid lines correspond to \u03be = 0.01, \u03be = 1, \u03be = 00, and \u03be = 10 000, respectively. The dashed lines are for the cases ithout considering temperature dependence. From this figure, it s clear that below 10 5 K, the values of force multiplier in case onsidering the temperature dependence (equation 17 in Proga 2007 ) re roughly same as those in case without considering the temperature ependence. Therefore, below 10 5 K, it is not necessary to consider he temperature dependence of force multiplier. Abo v e 10 5 K, it is easonable to directly set force multiplier to be zero as in this paper.\nhis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 513, 1141\u20131153 (2022)\n3/1/1141/6567864 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024"
