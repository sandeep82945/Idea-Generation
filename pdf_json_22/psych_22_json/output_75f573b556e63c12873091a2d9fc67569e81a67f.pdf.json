    "abstractText": "Methods We administered an online cross-sectional nationwide survey between May 1st and June 30th, 2020 to a convenience sample of older adults aged \u226555 years. Our outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness measured by three standardized scales: the eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the odds of depression, anxiety and loneliness between men and women, adjusting for relevant confounders.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is an unprecedented crisis with the potential for dire immediate and long-term consequences to older adults\u2019 health and well-being. Older adults are not only at higher risk for severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19,(1-3) but may also suffer greater emotional harms associated with the pandemic.(4) During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, there were increases in loneliness, anxiety, and depression resulting from social isolation under quarantine measures,(5) and rates of suicide among older adults increased in high-outbreak jurisdictions such as Taipei and Hong Kong.(6,7) In Canada, the current physical distancing measures have limited social interactions and curtailed many activities for older adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized specific concerns for older adults who, because of isolation, could become more anxious during the COVID-19 pandemic.(8) Social isolation may disproportionally affect older women, who are more likely to live alone and more likely to rely on a caregiver for support.(9) These findings highlight the urgency to study the mental health impact of COVID-19 among older women in particular, so that any adverse impacts can be anticipated and minimized.\nSeveral observational studies related to mental health experiences among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported. Longitudinal studies from the UK and The Netherlands demonstrated increased mental distress and/or loneliness compared to pre-pandemic estimates.(10,11) When compared to younger age groups, older adults have\n\u00a9 2022 Author(s).

Our objective was to describe the mental health symptoms and concerns of Canadian older adults during the outset of the pandemic, and to examine whether older women experienced greater mental distress compared to older men."

The survey was designed by researchers at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research(15) and adapted with permission for the Canadian context. The survey comprised of 53 questions and collected information regarding sociodemographic data (e.g., age, gender, education), COVID-19\u2013 related experiences, perspectives and impacts on daily life, and self-reported mental health symptoms.

The survey completion rate was calculated as the number of respondents who answered the last question, divided by the number of respondents who consented to participate. We used adaptive questioning for certain items (i.e., some questions conditionally displayed based on earlier responses) to reduce the number and complexity of the questions. Qualtrics software did not allow for completeness checks prior survey submission, and there were no mandatory items due to REB specifications. Respondents were able to review and change their answers through a back button function before submitting the survey.\nStudy Variables Gender was measured by asking participants \u201cwhat is your gender\u201d with the option to choose male, female, other, or prefer not to answer. We collected information regarding COVID-19 symptoms and testing, extent of practicing physical distancing, and communication with others in the previous seven days. We used Likert scale questions to collect measures of concern and attitudes towards COVID-19\u2013related experiences hypothesized to contribute to mental distress. Our outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness as measured by three standardized scales: the eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Symptoms were based on self-reported feelings and experiences within the previous week. The eight-item CES-D has been used in the US Health and Retirement Study and has high internal consistency and reliability.(18,19) We used a score \u2265 3 to define meaningful depressive symptoms, which was determined to be similar to the cut point of \u2265 16 on the full CES-D(19) and has been used in prior research with older adults.(20) The five-item BAI has been used in other studies of older adults with good internal consistency.(21) We defined meaningful anxiety symptoms as scores \u2265 10 on the five-item BAI, as that corresponded the highest quartile of the distribution in our sample, which is a similar justification of cut-off scores used by Gould et al.(22) Loneliness was measured using the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, a validated, self-rated tool with illustrated reliability and correlation to the full 20-item revised UCLA loneliness scale.(23) A total score of \u2265 6 was considered lonely, similar to other epidemiologic surveybased studies of older adults.(24,25)\n51CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 25, ISSUE 1, MARCH 2022"

            "text": "In a survey of older Canadian adults, elevated mental health symptoms were commonly reported during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Older women had twice the odds of reporting depressive symptoms and higher odds of reporting anxiety and loneliness, even after controlling FIGURE 1. Study recruitment flow chart\nfor pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as factors hypothesized to contribute to gender differences including level of education, relationship status, living alone, and health status. The majority of respondents had been self-isolating at\nhome and maintaining physical distance from others during the prior seven days. Women were more likely than men to report daily communication with others and were more likely to report concern about the pandemic.\n54CANADIAN GERIATRICS JOURNAL, VOLUME 25, ISSUE 1, MARCH 2022\nOlder women in Canada may need additional mental health support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those who live alone or who have multiple health conditions.(28) This result is consistent with studies out of the United Kingdom, China, and Spain showing that women were more likely to experience mental distress including loneliness, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder during the pandemic.(29-31) The differences in mental health impact from pandemic restrictions among older women are possibly due to greater likelihood of widowhood, lower income,(32) and increased likelihood of taking on caregiving roles.(33,12) Given the extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions, it\u2019s possible that the mental health consequences for women will persist well beyond the end of the pandemic. Early interventions, such as social prescribing or connection to mental health services, should be employed to mitigate the long-term consequences of untreated mental distress. Clinicians should consider targeted screening for older women, with particular attention paid to caregivers who may benefit from virtual support groups and safe options for respite to replace the community programs that may have closed.\nWe observed higher prevalence rates of mental symptoms among older adults compared to what has been reported in Canada before the pandemic using similar survey measures. (34-36) Comparisons should be made cautiously as these differences could be due to factors unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as study populations, screening tools, and methodologies. Nevertheless, in our survey, 23.3% of respondents reported symptoms of depression compared to 15.3% of older Canadians in 2019.(36) In surveys conducted before the pandemic, 7.7% of Canadian older adults had self-reported anxiety symptoms(34) and 12.0% reported loneliness,(35) less than the 23.3% who reported symptoms of anxiety and 28.0% who identified as lonely in our survey. Almost half of all surveyed participants reported symptoms consistent with any one of the three mental health conditions and 7.7% reported symptoms of all three, suggesting a high burden of mental distress in this population during the early months of the pandemic. It\u2019s possible that current levels of mental distress could be even higher after several waves of infection, ongoing restrictions and closures, and concern about emerging variants. As health authorities across Canada implement future public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, the mental health needs of older adults should be considered. Improving access to digital technology for mental health support is an important step as many older adults currently lack access to internet-enabled devices.(37) While the use of technology may be helpful for older adults who are willing and able,(38) others may not feel ready or comfortable and it is imperative that other models of care, such as in-person visits with safety precautions, are still offered.(39)\nAn important study limitation is that our data is based on a convenience sample of mostly white, retired, well-educated, healthy older adults living in urban Canadian centres with internet access, which limits the generalizability of our findings.\nMarginalized populations who are at greater risk of mental health distress (e.g., older adults with low income, those living in residential care settings) are under-represented. As such, our findings may be a conservative estimate of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported mental health symptoms should not be interpreted as prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders(40) as data may be subject to response bias, and the mental health screening tools used do not reflect a validated diagnostic interview. Finally, differences between women and men may be explained by unmeasured diagnoses, such as alcohol misuse, or the fact that men may be less likely to report mental health symptoms.(41)"

            "text": "Our findings underscore the importance of interventions to support mental well-being for older women throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. There should be adequately resourced services to screen for, and meet, the additional mental health needs of older women. Improving access to digital technologies for social connectivity and home delivery of essential items may be particularly good options, as our study suggests that older women are likely to use virtual communication and accept offers of assistance from their community. Given that the full duration of this pandemic remains unknown, it is imperative that older women are supported to mitigate long-term adverse mental health outcomes. It will be important to consistently measure how mental distress changes over time, especially for older women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses who may face additional challenges heightened by pandemic emergency responses."
