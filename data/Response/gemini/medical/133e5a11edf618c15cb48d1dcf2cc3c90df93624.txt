1. **Investigate the long-term effects of HPV vaccination on sexual risk behaviors among MSM.** This study only looked at risk compensation intentions in a hypothetical situation. A longitudinal study could track MSM over time to see if their actual sexual risk behaviors change after they receive the HPV vaccine.


2. **Explore the role of social and cultural factors in risk compensation among MSM.** This study focused on individual-level factors, but social and cultural factors may also play a role in risk compensation. For example, MSM who live in communities with high rates of HPV infection or who have friends who engage in risky sexual behaviors may be more likely to engage in risk compensation after vaccination.


3. **Develop and test interventions to reduce risk compensation among MSM.** The findings of this study suggest that interventions to reduce risk compensation should focus on increasing self-efficacy, decreasing positive outcome expectancy, and increasing negative outcome expectancy. Future research could develop and test interventions that target these factors.


4. **Examine the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce risk compensation among MSM.** Before widespread implementation, it is important to know whether interventions to reduce risk compensation are cost-effective. Future research could compare the costs of these interventions to the benefits of preventing HPV infection and other STDs.


5. **Investigate the potential for risk compensation after vaccination against other STDs among MSM.** This study focused on HPV vaccination, but it is possible that risk compensation could also occur after vaccination against other STDs. Future research could investigate this possibility and identify ways to prevent it.
