This paper defines Connected Health, and, in particular, describes standards and regulations which are important to the implementation of safe, effective and secure Connected Health solutions. This paper provides: a holistic view of Connected Health; provides a standards and regulations based view of the lifecycle of the Health IT system; and identifies the relevant roles and responsibilities at the various stages of the lifecycle for both manufacturers of connected health solution and healthcare delivery organization solutions. We discuss how the implementation of standards and regulations, while implementing and using Health IT infrastructure, requires close collaboration and ongoing communication between Healthcare Delivery Organizations and Accountable Manufacturers throughout the lifecycle of the health IT system. Furthermore, bringing technology into the healthcare system requires a robust and comprehensive approach to Clinical Change Management to support the business and clinical changes that the implementation of such solutions requires. Ultimately, to implement safe, effective, and secure Connected Health solutions in the healthcare ecosystem, it requires that all those involved work together so that the main requirement\u2014patient-centered care\u2014is realized.\nKEYWORDS\nconnected health (CH), health information technology systems, healthcare pathways, standards, patient centred care\n1. Introduction\nTechnology, both hardware and software, impacts every facet of our lives. It has become the norm in many of our everyday environments to use smart phones, internet, mobile technology, integrated software systems and ubiquitous computing. We increasingly shop and pay, make travel arrangements, access education, collaborate and socialize online\u2014 our day-to-day processes are being digitally transformed. We also note that, as the technology that supports them evolves, the processes through which these activities are undertaken must evolve. This can happen in either an ad hoc manner, where people \u201cfigure out\u201d the processes as they use the technology, or in a managed manner, where people know and understand what they are doing. However, in order for them to be efficient and effective, the implementation of digital systems must be managed (1).\nHealthcare is also experiencing digital implementation. This is taking place not only in the traditional healthcare setting of the hospital, clinics and the General Practitioner\u2019s office but, increasingly, it is taking place in the community. In addition, community healthcare has\n01 frontiersin.org\nchanged, and now focuses on wellbeing and prevention in the home. Technology is being used by those who are well and those who are ill, it is being used by individuals themselves and by their carers, and it is being used by family members and professional medical personnel.\nHealth professionals are making increasing use of technology to monitor, diagnose, prescribe, maintain patient records, and generally enhance their healthcare practice. However, introducing health information technology to healthcare, commonly known as Connected Health, is broader than just \u201cputting\u201d hardware and/or software in place. Through our previous ongoing research on this topic (2), we have defined it as, and illustrated it in\nFIGURE 1\n1A \u201cm\n\u201cany\nothe\ncom\nmed\n\u2022 d\na\n\u2022 d\nin\n\u2022 in\np\n\u2022 p\nd\nd\np\nh\nFron\nConnected health components provide patient-centered health care.\nThe implementation of connected health systems has resulted in moving away from traditional interaction with healthcare systems. When the majority of healthcare systems were established, patients would attend care facilities for episodes of acute care. But, from a cost perspective and due to the lack of qualified personnel, combined with the increasing ageing population and a consequent prevalence of chronic disease, the way that care is provided has had to change (3). To manage chronic disease, we interact with our caregivers much more regularly and over a longer period of time. The definition of caregiver now includes family members and a broader range of healthcare professionals, and we see an increased emphasis on wellbeing and self-monitoring as a means to prevent and manage\nedical device\u201d is defined in the EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR) as\ninstrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or\nr article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in\nbination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific\nical purposes:\niagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or\nlleviation of disease,\niagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an\njury or disability,\nvestigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a\nhysiological or pathological process or state,\nroviding information by means of in vitro examination of specimens\nerived from the human body, including organ, blood and tissue\nonations, and which does not achieve its principal intended action by\nharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, in or on the\numan body, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.\u201d\ntiers in Digital Health 02\nchronic disease. Technology is important in supporting these ongoing relationships (4). Care pathways are being altered so that sections of the pathways are being replaced by a connected health solution. For example, surgeons are now using robots to do the surgery, while they are driving the operation through computerization. While the move to connected health solutions is being driven by such changes to care pathways, it must also be recognised that the implementation of connected health solutions can in themselves require the modification and redesign of care pathways.\nWhile recognizing the potential benefits of health information technology (IT), the patient will continue to be the most important consideration in the medical domain. Technology-supported healthcare pathways must be designed so that they result in quality outcomes for the patient, and to do this, patient-centered care must be provided. There is also increasing pressure to design healthcare pathways that provide for the efficient delivery of care to the patient with a focus on providing this care at a reduced cost. This combination of the traditional with the technological pathway requires process-driven health care delivery, so that each person within the pathway understands the role of people and the role of technology within that pathway. Parts of these pathways may require a healthcare professional, e.g., where medication is being prescribed, but parts of the pathway can be carried out independently, e.g., in instance where a decision support system is being used and the knowledge of the professional has been included in the system.\nThe use of connected health systems results in the development of increasingly complex health systems which includes health IT systems. These systems can be composed of regulated and unregulated technologies and devices, and components can be\nfrontiersin.org\nadded and removed from the system throughout a long lifecycle. As the patient is the central focus of these systems, there is a need to ensure that, during and after the implementation of these connected health systems, they allow for patient-centered care. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the aspects of safety, effectiveness and security, and the standards and regulations which have been developed to support the maintenance of these properties through the lifecycle. Furthermore, the ongoing development and implementation of these standards and regulations requires close and continuous collaboration among health system stakeholders. Therefore, our Research Objective for this paper is to present the standards and regulations required to implement health IT systems so that they maintain the properties of safety, effectiveness and security.\nIn the remainder of the paper, Section 2 examines how the use of connected health has impacted the design and use of patientcentered care pathways. Section 3 examines the standards that must implemented be in order to protect safety, effectiveness and security of the Health IT Infrastructure and examines how these standards relate to the regulations that make up part of the Broader Healthcare System. Section 4 examines how the implementation of connected health solutions is managed through a process of Clinical Change Management within the Healthcare Delivery Context. Section 5 provides discussion and concludes that standards and regulations are vital for the implementation of connected health solutions, but that the implementation of such standards through the lifecycle must be completed as part of a comprehensive clinical risk management process to ensure the safety, effectiveness and security of health IT systems."

Furthermore, the patient-care team relationship requires carefully designed care processes which require the support of information technology (3, 5\u20137). Interoperable2 medical devices have been identified as one potential approach to achieving this goal (8\u201310). Recognising this potential, governments have provided incentives to promote the meaningful use of interoperable medical devices and health IT, such as Electronic\n2Medical Device interoperability has been defined by the FDA as \u201cthe ability\nto safely, securely, and effectively exchange and use information among one\nor more devices, products, technologies, or systems.

Consequently, the number of networked medical devices in use continues to increase (14\u201316).\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic has also increased the pace of use of connected health in healthcare, medical affairs and the pharmaceutical industry, with many countries adopting \u201cdigital first\u201d strategies to control the spread of the virus and changing the way in which healthcare systems function at a pace not experienced before (17\u201319). The pandemic also highlighted the role of connected health systems in facilitating transparent data sharing (20). This rapid shift has not only served as a test for the maturity of health IT\u2014it has also shifted patient\u2019s expectations about the way in which care is provided (21).\nIn order to address the diverse and complex challenges faced by global health services, a connected health ecosystem is required. The implications of such a system do not stop at the health IT systems level (22). Rather, the importance of considering the larger socio-technical environment is recognised. Each facet of the ecosystem and their interactions need to be implemented with a view to the relevant Standards and Regulations. This ecosystem includes: the Health IT Infrastructure; the Healthcare Delivery Context and the Broader Healthcare System used. The health IT infrastructure consists of the infrastructure itself (for example, hardware, software, networks, interfaces to other systems, medical devices and data), and the organizations involved in developing, implementing and operating the systems\u2019 components and services. The healthcare delivery context refers to the specific organization setting where the health IT system is being deployed and to the stakeholders of that system. Finally, the broader healthcare system encompasses for example, standards, regulations, funding and policy implications, within which the Healthcare Delivery Organization must comply and operate. It should be noted that this ecosystem exists within a larger external environment which can also have an impact. Examples include the recent global pandemic and, on a more general level, factors such as public opinion can also affect the ecosystem. However, our interest in this paper is specifically on presenting standards and regulations which are relevant to connected health systems. Due to the complexity of the systems and the various standards required for different safety classifications of devices, our intent here is not to provide an exhaustive list, but rather to highlight some areas for consideration during the connected health life cycle."

Standards\u2014the health it infrastructure lifecycle\nHealth IT is defined as:\n\u201cHealth information technology is the hardware, software, and systems that comprise the input, transmission, use, extraction, and analysis of information in the healthcare sector. The endusers of this technology include not only patients, physicians, and other front-line healthcare providers, but also medical\nfrontiersin.org\nresearchers, healthcare insurance companies, public health agencies, regulatory and quality assurance entities, pharmaceutical and medical device corporations, and various levels of government\u201d (23).\nThe need to support an ongoing relationship between the patient and the care giver has contributed not only the complexity of health IT systems but has also extended the lifecycle of these systems. These systems provide advanced levels of decision support and integrate patient data between systems, across health delivery contexts, and throughout the relationship between patient and caregiver (22). While these systems provide benefits to both the patent and to the wider healthcare system (24, 25), with the increasingly complex systems composed of regulated and unregulated technologies, there is also increased likelihood of software-induced adverse events (26\u201328). From a technical perspective, issues have been reported related to design flaws, coding errors, incorrect implementation or configuration, data integrity issues and faults in decision support tools. Poor alignment with clinical workflows and improper maintenance and use of such systems have also been reported and are provided as examples of events with the potential to cause harm to patients (22).\nIn addition, health IT systems need to support the three key properties of safety, effectiveness and security during this complex and extended lifecycle. Safety is defined as \u201cfreedom from unacceptable risk\u201d (29). Effectiveness means that the system being used can produce the intended result for the patient and for the Organization operating the health IT system (30). In this context, security is considered from the perspective of both data and system security. This requires that, throughout the lifecycle, the system maintains an operational state in which information assets are reasonably protected from degradation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (30). A number of standards that aim to support the safe development and operation of medical devices and health IT systems and regulations in the context of the broader healthcare system are discussed in this section.\nOur particular interest is in standards (a) related to the design and development of medical device software and (b) those for the implementation and clinical use of these devices within a health IT system. In terms of regulation, we examine those within the European Union (EU), which is similar to other countries such as the U.S.A. Prior to examining the standards and regulations, the remainder of this section examines the composition of health IT Systems and their lifecycle.\nA recently published standard, ISO 81001-1:2021 Health software and health IT systems safety, effectiveness and security\u2014 Part 1: Principles and concepts recognizes a need for a \u201ccommon understanding of the relevant concepts, principles and terminology is important in standardizing the processes and inter-organizational communications to support a coordinated approach to managing safety, effectiveness and security\u201d (22) and seeks to provide a framework to address these issues. As part of this framework, the lifecycle of health software and systems is defined. It should be noted that the health IT infrastructure itself,\nFrontiers in Digital Health 04\nas well as each IT health component brought onto it, is following its own life cycle. In addition to defining the lifecycle, the standard recognizes a number of roles that share responsibility across the lifecycle as follows:\n\u2022 Top Management\u2014a group of people who direct, control and\nhave overall accountability in a healthcare organization.\n\u2022 System owner\u2014accountable for ensuring the health software\nand health IT system being acquired and implemented will meet their organization\u2019s healthcare delivery services needs for its intended use. \u2022 Developer\u2014responsible for execution of the design and\ndevelopment phase (from concept through to release and maintenance) of a health IT system. A developer could be part of a manufacturer organization, a supplier of services or a Health Delivery Organization. \u2022 Integrator\u2014responsible for the technical installation,\nconfiguration, data migration and integration with the other health IT systems, medical devices and technology being used by the healthcare organization. \u2022 Implementer\u2014responsible for the clinical installation, workflow\noptimization and training in the clinical setting (an implementer may be the developer or owner). \u2022 Administrator\u2014responsible for the ongoing operation of the\nimplemented health IT system and ensuring it is safeguarded and maintained on an ongoing basis to meet its design requirements. \u2022 Users\u2014Persons using the system in the clinical setting, which\nmay include, for example, consumers in the case of personal health records.\nThe Health IT lifecycle consists of: Design and Development; Acquisition; Installation and Integration; Implementation; Operational use in the Clinical Context; and Decommissioning. The standard notes the importance of communication across the lifecycle stages and that communication across transition points in the life cycle is key to the maintenance of the key properties of the system. In complex systems with diverse stakeholders, communication is especially important and requires additional attention. As health IT systems pass through different stages in their life cycle, it is key that the roles above are defined. Furthermore, the responsibilities associated with these roles and the importance of the information shared among these roles must also be understood.\nDuring the transition from the Design and Development phase of the lifecycle to the Acquisition phase, the developer provides information to the system owner. This should be sufficient to allow the system owner to determine that the health IT software meets the needs of the Organization and can be used safely. The user and implementer may assist the system owner in making this determination but ultimately the onus is on the system owner to make the correct determination.\nThe system owner examines the planned use of IT in both the health IT system and the healthcare ecosystem during the transition from the Acquisition phase to the Installation and Integration phase. The need for configuration, customization,\nfrontiersin.org\ntraining of operators and users is also determined at this stage. Testing and monitoring of the system is also carried out.\nDuring the transition from the Installation and Integration phase to the Implementation phase, the integrator provides information about any hazards that were identified during the integration. A mitigation strategy for hazards that are expected to be mitigated is put in place. The implementer provides any specific actions to the operator that are needed to maintain the safety of the health IT during its use in the health IT system during the transition from Implementation phase to the Operational use in the Clinical context phase. During the transition from Operational use in the Clinical Context phase to the Decommissioning phase, any hazards that may need special attention on decommissioning and disposal of the health IT software are identified.\nStandards have been developed that address the stakeholder responsible for maintaining the key properties at various stages of the lifecycle. Due to the distribution of roles and responsibilities involved, the standards related to health IT infrastructure have provided a definition of the lifecycle and have developed standards for the stages of the lifecycle as follows:\n\u2022 Design and Development Phase\u2014addressed to Accountable\nManufacturers\n\u2022 Implementation Phase (which includes Acquisition, Installation and\nImplementation)\u2014addressed mainly to Accountable Manufacturers and Accountable Healthcare Delivery Organizations \u2022 Clinical Use Phase (which includes Operational Use, Maintenance\nand Decommissioning)\u2014also addressed to Accountable Healthcare Delivery Organizations\nIn addition, foundational standards (such as ISO 81001-1) have been developed which provide terms, definitions, concepts, and core themes that are applicable across the life cycle and address specific aspects of the management of health IT systems such as Governance and Knowledge Transfer. Section 3.2 discusses standards addressed to Accountable Manufacturers and Section 3.3 discusses standards addressed to Accountable Healthcare Delivery Organizations and those related to Data Transfer. The interaction between standards and regulations is discussed in Section 3.4."

To address these issues, IEC 62304:2006 Medical device software\u2014Software life-cycle processes (38) defines the life cycle requirements for medical device software. The standard outlines the set of processes, activities, and tasks and establishes a common framework for medical device software life cycle processes. IEC 62304 is a harmonized standard. Harmonized standards, such as IEC 62304 and ISO 13485, and their relationship to regulations are discussed in Section 3.5."

IEC 80001-1 requires that accountable medical device manufacturers provide Healthcare Delivery Organizations with accompanying\nfrontiersin.org\ndocuments describing the intended use of a medical device and providing instructions for the safe installation and use of the device. Accountable manufacturers of other health software must make documents available to the Healthcare Delivery Organization. This documentation should provide information for the safe use of the technology provided on the IT network including, but not restricted to: technical descriptions and manuals; required IT network characteristics; and known incompatibilities and restrictions. The information required from medical device manufacturers is currently provided based on their responsibilities outlined under IEC 60601-1 (39). This standard contains requirements for basic safety and essential performance applicable to medical electrical equipment. IEC 80001-1 does not impose any additional requirements on manufacturers in term of the provision of information.

            "text": "For Healthcare Delivery Organizations, there are also a number of standards that have been developed in order to ensure the safety, effectiveness and security of the health IT system during the Implementation and Clinical Use Phase. The main focus of these standards is on providing healthcare delivery Organizations with requirements for the roles, responsibilities and activities that need to be in place in order to manage the risk associated with \u201cthe implementation and use of connected medical devices or connected health software\u201d (34). The previous version of IEC 80001-1 published in 2010 (30) was developed in response to reports of a number of cyber-attacks on US hospitals after which guidance on the prevention of such attacks was published (42). This led to a review of the risks surrounding networked medical devices and the standard was developed to address these risks.\nFrontiers in Digital Health 07\nThe publication of IEC 80001-1 recognised that, while these regulations address the operation of the device prior to acquisition by the Healthcare Delivery Organization, the placement of the device into a network creates a shared responsibility for the risk management of the device between the accountable manufacturers and the Healthcare Delivery Organization (43, 44). While medical device manufacturers are used to implementing this type of standard, Healthcare Delivery Organizations have struggled to implement the requirement of the standard and research has been performed to address these challenges (45\u201347). This research included the development of a technical report to allow for the assessment of the capability of risk management processes (48) and the proposal of an approach to the revision of the standard to make it easier to understand and implement (49).\nThe new version of the standard recognizes that Health IT infrastructures have evolved since the initial standard was developed. Where the original standard established a concept of a medical IT network as a network incorporating at least one medical device, the new standard looks at a broader scope of connected medical devices and connected health software. Therefore, it recognizes that Health IT infrastructures are increasingly connected, medical devices are routinely placed onto the hospital\u2019s general IT network and that the Health IT infrastructure increasingly reaches beyond traditional care settings. This increases the potential for adverse events as medical devices may be placed into systems where they have not previously been tested. Therefore, there must be a greater emphasis on the risk management process for these devices and greater emphasis on Healthcare Delivery Organizations to understand and manage these risks.\nIn addition to the 2010 version of the IEC 80001-1 standard, a number of associated technical reports were published. The technical reports provide guidance to address specific aspects of the implementation of the IEC 80001-1 standard. The standard, along with the associated technical reports, can be used to manage the communication between the healthcare delivery organizations throughout the lifecycle to ensure that the safety, effectiveness and security of connected medical devices and connected health software are preserved. A number of these technical reports are currently being reviewed and revised. In addition, a foundational standard, ISO 81001-1 has been published to define \u201cthe principles, concepts, terms and definitions for health software and health IT systems, key properties of safety, effectiveness and security, across the full life cycle, from concept to decommissioning\u201d (22)."

In order to ensure the integrity of the data being transferred, a number of standards have been established. This transfer of data requires robust communication among Healthcare Delivery\nfrontiersin.org\nOrganizations and accountable manufacturers and the risks associated with the transfer of this data would be managed within the broader context of risk management under the requirements of IEC 80001-1 and would also need to be managed in the context of the regulations pertaining to data protection. These regulations are discussed in the context of the broader healthcare system in Section 3.5. Some standards that would be relevant in this context include ISO 13606-1:2019 Health informatics\u2014Electronic health record communication\u2014 Part 1: Reference model (50). This standard specifies a means for communicating part or all of the electronic health record (EHR) of one or more identified subjects of care between EHR systems, or between EHR systems and a centralized EHR data repository. Fast Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a Health Level Seven International (HL7) specification for healthcare interoperability (51) and \u201cis designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data, to be quickly and efficiently exchanged\u201d (52). For the transfer of medical images, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard is used. DICOM (53) is \u201cthe international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process and display medical imaging information\u201d. These standards need to be considered in the context of the other standards\u2014both those addressed to Healthcare Delivery Organizations and accountable manufacturers and in the context of the overall healthcare ecosystem.\n3.5. The broader healthcare system\u2014regulations\nThe broader healthcare system encompasses for example, regulations, funding and policy implications, within which the Health Delivery Organization must comply and operate. This section examines the broader healthcare system from the perspective of the regulations that impact the system at various stages of the Health It system lifecycle. The regulations examined in this paper are focused on those which are applicable in the EU.\nAs previously stated health software is not currently regulated (unless it is classified as a medical device) and, as such, during the design and development phase, we focus on the regulations that are relevant to medical devices. Medical Devices that are designed to be marketed in the EU must comply with Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices (MDR) (54) and Regulation 2017/ 746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) (55). These regulations became applicable after a 5-year transition period and represent a significant development and strengthening of the existing regulatory system for medical devices in Europe. The legislation now is in the form of a Regulation, rather than a Directive, which means that the EU law is directly applicable at national level meaning that there is no longer a requirement for transposition through specific national legislation which should prevent variation in the approach taken.\nThe EU also states that for the new regulation that \u201cCompliance with a harmonized standard confers a presumption of conformity with the corresponding essential requirements set out in Union harmonization legislation from the date of\nFrontiers in Digital Health 08\npublication of the reference of such standard in the Official Journal of the European Union\u201d (56). This means that manufacturers that comply with the requirements of the recognised standards can also claim conformity to the regulations. To date, 14 standards have been recognised and it is expected that the Commission will issue further implementing decisions to add to the list of harmonized standards later in 2022. Some standards (such as IEC 62304:2006 Medical device software\u2014Software life cycle processes) which conferred a presumption of conformity with the previous Medical Device Directive have not yet been recognised. This standard was discussed in Section 3.2.1.\nDuring the Implementation Phase, Health Delivery Organizations will also need to consider regulation related to the data that is being transmitted. Privacy issues will also need to be addressed. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (55) recognizes data concerning health as a special category of data and provides a definition for health data for data protection purposes. It requires specific safeguards for personal health data which will need to be addressed in the context of connected health, including the facilitation of cross border care.\nIn May, 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation on the European Health Data Space (EHDS) (57). With the proposal, the European Commission aims to make significant progress towards a single market for digital health services and products with the overall objective being to ensure that electronic health data are as open as possible and as closed as necessary to facilitate research, innovation, policy-making, and regulatory activities. The aim is to have a single internal market for health data between the EU Member States.\nThe Clinical Use phase consists of Operational Use, Maintenance and Decommissioning. The focus for both the medical device manufacturer and the Health Delivery Organization is to ensure that the connected health system continues to be compliant with the relevant regulations and standards as these activities take place. For example, when making a change to a device within an existing system, in order to address a security vulnerability, the manufacturer and Health Delivery Organization will need to ensure that the change is made within the existing risk management process and that the change does not impact the key properties of the system.\nConnected Health systems are increasingly including Medical Devices that use sophisticated Artificial Intelligence. The European Commission published its Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI) (58) in April of 2021, which aims to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation of AI. Parts of the proposal address high risk AI applications, which would include the use of AI in Medical Devices and Connected Health systems. No international guidance, common specifications and/or harmonized standards currently exist for the use of AI in medical devices. Therefore, regulators continue to work to address the challenge of regulation of medical device software that include AI algorithms and to address the unique challenges that AI can give rise to in the context of healthcare including, for example, the issues related to the automated\nfrontiersin.org\nprocessing of data and compliance with GDPR which requires that \u201cmeaningful information about the logic\u201d involved in decisions related to their care is provided by manufacturers to patients.\nGiven that we are concerned about the effectiveness of Connected Health system, another directive that we should be concerned with when developing Health IT systems is the EU Accessibility directive, EN 301 549 V3.2 (59). This came into effect in June 2021. This directive requires that all public sector bodies in the EU have accessible online websites and mobile apps, through which many connected health solutions are implemented. In their research, Tsvyatkova et al. (60), present accessibility as having concern for the quality of being \u201ceasy to reach and use\u201d.\nWe are aware that the directive, EN 301 549, has not been published for medical devices specifically, which is one of the reasons that we want to highlight it here. Many health IT systems, and specifically those used in a connected health context, will be developed for use by the public (patient, family, carers, healthcare professionals), and, consequently, should be accessible. Health IT system users will often have accessibility issues through disability, impairment or limitation, for example, visual impairment, intellectual and developmental disability. Designers and developers should ensure that the software they develop provides correct functions for the user. Good design will also ensure accessible interaction through a user interface which would include, for example, features which support new users in understanding and using the software. Furthermore, designing of interactive elements which support low physical effort should be considered.\nAdditionally, while the directive is written for public bodies, and which includes many national health services in European countries, should accessibility not be considered by all, regardless of whether they are public or private? The directive is aligned to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v2.1, published by the W3C and known as WCAG 2.1 (61). These are internationally recognised requirements for producing web and mobile content, are considered best practice, and are very widely used. It should be noted that the directive also contains requirements not mentioned in WCAG 2.1, and so, there should not be a singular reliance on WCAG 2.1 when developing accessible software."

Standards define the healthcare ecosystem as being composed of: the Health IT Infrastructure; the Healthcare Delivery Context and the Broader Healthcare System. The implementation of Connected Health solutions within this ecosystem requires consideration of all of these components as none can exist in isolation. However, if any one of these is not considered, then there is a very high risk that the Connected Health solution will not work in practice.\nFor these purposes, the Health IT infrastructure must be developed taking standards and regulations, which form part of the Broader Healthcare System into account. At one level, this needs to be done for ratification by the relevant bodies globally\u2014 Notified Bodies in the European Union or by the Food and Drugs Administration in the US. More importantly, these regulations are one means of supporting development which is safe, effective and secure for the Connected Health solution user. The standards and regulations exist out of concern for the welfare of the user, and must take them into account. For example, in cases where the accessibility directive is not implemented, then those with a disability are immediately not catered for. Data is an important component and those whose data is stored in Connected Health Systems want to be satisfied that their data is secure. In order to implement the requirements of the standards related to the implementation and clinical use of the Health IT infrastructure, close collaboration and ongoing communication between Healthcare Delivery Organizations and Accountable Manufacturers is required throughout the lifecycle. Within Healthcare Delivery Organizations, teams of diverse risk management stakeholder groups must be convened. They should be assisted in communication supporting the development of a holistic view of the risk management process in the specific Healthcare Delivery Context in which the Health IT infrastructure operates.\nWe have shown how standards and regulations can support this, but it should be noted that there are often other nonspecified technical solutions which can be used. Implementation of Connected Health solutions, which requires bringing technology into the healthcare system requires a robust and comprehensive approach to Clinical Change Management to support the business and clinical changes that the implementation of such solutions requires. Change managers can look to ISO 81001-1, which identifies six elements of the Clinical Change Management Process as follows: Governance and Leadership, Stakeholder Engagement, Communications, Workflow Analysis and Integration, Training and Education, and Monitoring and Evaluation. Each of these elements are vital to the implementation of standards and regulations and in facilitating the non-technical changes required. For example, as technology is introduced into healthcare system, healthcare pathways must change. These can be re-defined by healthcare professionals, but if they do not consider standards and regulations, they are in danger of losing some of the positive effects of making these changes.\nUltimately, to implement safe, effective and secure Connected Health solutions in the healthcare ecosystem, it requires that all\nfrontiersin.org\nthose involved work together to bring the identified components together, standards and regulations, health IT, people, data, and healthcare pathways, thus resulting in the central requirement\u2014 patient-centered care.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.\nFunding\nThis work was supported with the financial support of the Science Foundation Ireland grant 13/RC/2094_P2 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme to Lero\u2014\nFrontiers in Digital Health 12\nthe Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software (www.lero.ie).\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\nPublisher\u2019s note\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.
