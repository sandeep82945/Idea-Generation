    "abstractText": "Quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of the Galerkin method suffer from membrane locking when applied to Kirchhoff-Love shell formulations. Membrane locking causes not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. Continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements have been recently introduced to remove membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods (Casquero et al., CMAME, 2022). In this work, we generalize CAS elements to vanquish membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear Kirchhoff-Love shells. CAS elements bilinearly interpolate the membrane strains at the four corners of each element. Thus, the assumed strains have C continuity across element boundaries. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, CAS elements are the first assumed-strain treatment to effectively overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBSbased discretizations of Kirchhoff-Love shells while satisfying the following important characteristics for computational efficiency: (1) No additional degrees of freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to be solved, (3) No matrix multiplications or matrix inversions are needed to obtain the stiffness matrix, and (4) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved. The benchmark problems show that CAS elements, using either 2 \u00d7 2 or 3 \u00d7 3 GaussLegendre quadrature points per element, are an effective locking treatment since this element type results in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes and excises the spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. The benchmark problems also show that CAS elements outperform stateof-the-art element types based on Lagrange polynomials equipped with either assumed-strain or reduced-integration locking treatments.",

In this work, we generalize CAS elements to vanquish membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear Kirchhoff-Love shells.

The benchmark problems show that CAS elements, using either 2 \u00d7 2 or 3 \u00d7 3 GaussLegendre quadrature points per element, are an effective locking treatment since this element type results in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes and excises the spurious oscillations of the membrane forces.

KirchhoffLove shell theory neglects transverse shear strains, which are considered to be negligible as long as R/t \u2265 20 [17], where R is the radius of curvature, t is the thickness, and R/t is the slenderness ratio. Thus, Kirchhoff-Love shells do not suffer from transverse shear locking. Nevertheless, Kirchhoff-Love shells still suffer from membrane locking [18, 19, 20], which is also the case for Reissner-Mindlin shells [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and solid shells [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Membrane locking leads to displacements and bending moments with smaller values than expected and membrane forces with large-amplitude spurious oscillations.\nSince our goal is the development of a locking treatment that is adopted in commercial FEA software, we first summarize some of the locking treatments that have been widely adopted in commercial FEA software to overcome membrane locking when using Lagrange polynomials with C0 continuity across element boundaries. Assumed-strain treatments use assumed strains obtained from either projecting or interpolating the compatible strains to vanquish locking [32, 33, 34, 35]. Reduced-integration treatments vanquish locking by reducing the number of quadrature points, but this introduces spurious energy modes which need to be dealt with using hourglass control [36, 37, 38, 39]. Assumed-strain and reduced-integration treatments are the two locking treatments more widely utilized by the end users of commercial FEA programs [40, 41, 42]. These two locking treatments are equivalent to mixed methods under certain conditions [43, 44].\nNon-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) can have up to Cp\u22121 continuity across element boundaries, where p is the degree of the basis functions. In contrast, Lagrange polynomials have C0 continuity across element boundaries for any degree p. As a result of this different level of continuity across element boundaries, the numerical schemes that are effective in overcoming locking for Lagrange polynomials and NURBS are different. Reduced-integration treatments for Lagrange polynomials use p Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per direction and add hourglass control to handle spurious energy modes [36, 37, 38, 39]. Using p Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per direction in a NURBS-based discretization does not create spurious energy modes, but it is not an effective locking treatment either [45, 46, 47, 48]. Reduced-integration treatments for NURBS have been developed in which the integration is performed at the patch level instead of at the element level and spurious energy modes may be avoided in linear problems by slightly over-integrating near the patch boundary [49, 50, 51]. In [52], it was pointed out that these reduced patch-wise quadrature rules may still have spurious energy modes in nonlinear problems. Projection-based assumed-strain treatments for Lagrange polynomials obtain the assumed strains by performing L2 projections of the compatible strains onto lower-degree polynomial spaces within each element [53]. Using a L2 projection for each element results in assumed strains that are discontinuous across element boundaries and it is not an effective locking treatment for NURBS-based discretizations [30, 19, 47]. Projection-based assumed-strain treatments for NURBS have been developed in which the L2 projection is performed at the patch level instead of at the element level which enables to obtain assumed strains with the needed continuity patterns across element boundaries [54, 55, 30, 56]. However, performing the L2 projection at the patch level requires the inversion of a mass matrix at the patch level to obtain the stiffness matrix at the patch level which results to be a full matrix instead of a sparse matrix. To decrease the computational burden, the reconstructed B\u0304 projections were developed for NURBS-based discretizations [30, 57, 58, 19, 59]. The reconstructed B\u0304 projections perform the L2 projections at the element level and then combine the results from different elements to recover the needed continuity patterns of the assumed strains across element boundaries. Nevertheless, reconstructed B\u0304 projections still require matrix multiplications to obtain the stiffness\nmatrix at the patch level and its bandwidth increases. Interpolation-based assumed-strain treatments for Lagrange polynomials define the assumed strains using lower-degree polynomial spaces and interpolate the compatible strains at interior points within each element [60]. Using interpolation points in the interior of each element results in assumed strains that are discontinuous across element boundaries and it is not an effective locking treatment for NURBS-based discretizations since the spurious oscillations of the stress resultants are not stripped away [58, 47, 61].\nContinuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements were recently introduced to remove membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods [47], shear and membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Timoshenko rods [48], and volumetric locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of nearly-incompressible linear elasticity [62]. CAS elements are an interpolation-based assumed-strain treatment whose interpolation points are located at element boundaries instead of in the interior of each element. In this work, we generalize CAS elements to overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear Kirchhoff-Love shells. CAS elements bilinearly interpolate the membrane strains at the four corners of each element. Since the displacement vector given by quadratic NURBS has C1 continuity across element boundaries, the assumed strains obtained have C0 continuity across element boundaries. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, CAS elements are the first assumed-strain treatment to effectively overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of Kirchhoff-Love shells while satisfying the following important characteristics for the computational efficiency of the numerical scheme: (1) No additional degrees of freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to be solved, (3) No matrix multiplications or matrix inversions are needed to obtain the stiffness matrix, and (4) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved. Membrane locking causes not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. The spurious oscillations of the membrane forces persist for fine meshes that result in accurate displacements [47, 48]. Thus, we study the accuracy of both displacements and membrane forces to show that CAS elements verily overcome membrane locking.\nThe paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 sets forth the mathematical theory of linear KirchhoffLove shells. Section 3 summarizes how to solve the problem using compatible-strain (CS) elements. Section 4 develops CAS elements to overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear Kirchhoff-Love shells. Section 5 evaluates the performance of CS and CAS elements using either 2\u00d7 2 or 3\u00d7 3 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element, including comparisons with exact solutions and state-of-the-art element types based on Lagrange polynomials equipped with either assumed-strain or reduced-integration locking treatments. Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 consider the cylindrical shell strip [20], the pinched hemisphere with a hole [63], the Scordelis-Lo roof [63, 64], and the partly clamped hyperbolic paraboloid [65, 66] as benchmark problems, respectively. Concluding remarks and directions of future work are drawn in Section 6."

            "heading": "5.1. Cylindrical shell strip",
            "text": "The first numerical investigation considers a cylindrical shell strip clamped at one end and free at the other end. A line load, i.e., a load per unit length is applied at the free end in the radial\ndirection. The geometry, the boundary conditions, and the applied load are shown in Fig. 1. The next values are used in this example:\nqx = \u22120.1t3, R = 10.0, b = 1.0, E = 1.0\u00d7 103, \u03bd = 0.0. (34)\nIn order to consider different values of the slenderness ratio, three values are used for the thickness in this example, namely, t = 1.0, t = 0.1, and t = 0.01. For t = 1.0, R/t = 10 which is considered to be too thick to use Kirchhoff-Love theory according to [17]. We consider this slenderness ratio in this example to show that even a quite thick shell can suffer from membrane locking. Despite its apparent simplicity, this benchmark problem is challenging to solve numerically since it is a bending-dominated problem. For this problem, we can obtain the exact solution of the effective membrane force in the circumferential direction and the bending moment in the circumferential direction by enforcing static equilibrium on the shell. Specifically, we obtain n\u030211eff = qx cos\u03c6 and m\u030211 = \u2212qxR cos\u03c6, where the angle \u03c6 is shown in Fig. 1. The exact solution of n\u030211 can be obtained combining the preceding two exact solutions. Thus, we can use these exact solutions to study the convergence in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction and the bending moment in the circumferential direction. In order to do so, we define the relative errors in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction and the bending moment in the circumferential direction as\neL2(n\u0302 h 11) =\n\u221a\u222b A ( n\u0302h11 \u2212 n\u030211 )2 dA\u221a\u222b\nA n\u0302211 dA\n, (35)\neL2(m\u0302 h 11) =\n\u221a\u222b A ( m\u0302h11 \u2212 m\u030211 )2 dA\u221a\u222b\nA m\u0302211 dA\n, (36)\nrespectively. Since we are solving fourth-order partial differential equations with quadratic basis functions, the optimal asymptotic convergence rates of eL2(n\u0302 h 11) and eL2(m\u0302 h 11) are 2 and 1, respectively [69]. We initiate our convergence study with a uniform mesh composed of two quadratic elements in the circumferential direction and one element in the other direction. The midsurface of the shell is represented exactly since we are using quadratic NURBS. After that, we perform uniform h-refinement seven times in the circumferential direction (i.e., we keep one element in the other direction throughout all the refinement levels). Using CS elements and CAS elements, Fig. 2 a) plots the convergence of the radial displacement of the point A indicated in Fig. 1. The displacement values are normalized by the solution obtained using 256 CS elements of degree 9 in the circumferential direction, which is used as a reference solution. The reference values of the radial displacement at point A are \u22129.4561\u00d710\u22121, \u22129.4250\u00d710\u22121, and \u22129.4247\u00d710\u22121 for R/t = 10 , 102, and 103, respectively. Fig. 2 b) and c) plot the convergence in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction and the bending moment in the circumferential direction, respectively. nel1 represents the number of elements in the circumferential direction. As shown in Fig. 2 a), b), and c), the convergence of CAS elements is independent of the slenderness ratio for the broad range of R/t values considered while the convergence of CS elements heavily deteriorates as the slenderness ratio increases. Fig. 2 b) reveals an anomalous behavior in the convergence of the membrane force in the circumferential direction using CS elements, namely, the relative error in L2\nnorm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction increases as uniform h-refinement is performed multiple times (note that for many mesh resolutions and slenderness ratios the relative error of the membrane force is greater than 100%). This anomalous behavior, caused by membrane locking, has also been reported in [72, 20, 47, 48]. For both coarse and fine meshes, the relative error in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction obtained with CAS elements is several orders of magnitude smaller than the relative error in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction obtained with CS elements. In [58, 47], the global B\u0304 method, the reconstructed B\u0304 method, the reconstructed ANS method, and CAS elements lead to an asymptotic convergence rate for the L2 norm of the membrane force equal to 1.5 when applied to C1-continuous quadratic NURBS discretizations of linear plane Kirchhoff rods. Thus, CAS elements leading to an asymptotic convergence rate for the L2 norm of the membrane force equal to 1.5 when applied to C1-continuous quadratic NURBS discretizations of linear Kirchhoff-Love shells was the expected outcome. Fig. 2 d) plots the ratio of the membrane strain energy to the total strain energy as the slenderness ratio increases using 8 CS elements and 8 CAS elements in the circumferential direction. The numerical solution using 8 CAS elements in the circumferential direction overlaps with the reference solution, which uses 256 CS elements of degree 9 in the circumferential direction. However, as the slenderness ratio increases, membrane locking causes the introduction of spurious membrane energy in the numerical solution obtained using 8 CS elements in the circumferential direction.\nAs shown in [51], when using reduced patch-wise integration rules, the continuity of the chosen integration space must not be greater than the continuity of the strains so as to reproduce constant stress states. The bending strains are discontinuous across element boundaries when discretizing Kirchhoff-Love shells with C1-continuous quadratic NURBS. Therefore, the continuity of the integration space must be discontinuous across element boundaries to exactly reproduce constant stress states, which is needed to obtain accurate results. In this case, the integration is no longer patchwise, but element-wise instead and coincides with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules. Thus, using both CS and CAS elements, we now solve this problem using 2\u00d7 2 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element (2GP) as opposed to using 3 \u00d7 3 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element (3GP) to compute all the integrals. As shown in Fig. 3, CAS elements result in essentially the same accuracy regardless of whether 2 quadrature points per direction or 3 quadrature points per direction are used. Therefore, 2 quadrature points per direction can be used to decrease the computational time. However, CS elements with 2 quadrature points per direction are still a locking-prone discretization.\nFig. 4 plots the distribution of the membrane force in the circumferential direction for the slenderness ratio R/t = 102. Fig. 4 a) plots the reference solution which is obtained using 256 CS elements of degree 9 in the circumferential direction. Fig. 4 b) and c) plot the numerical solution obtained using 8 CAS elements in the circumferential direction with 3 and 2 quadrature points per direction, respectively. These two numerical solutions are free from spurious oscillations. Fig. 4 d), e), and f) plot the numerical solution obtained using 8, 16, and 32 CS elements in the circumferential direction with 3 quadrature points per direction, respectively. Fig. 4 g), h), and i) plot the numerical solution obtained using 8, 16, and 32 CS elements in the circumferential direction with 2 quadrature points per direction, respectively. These six numerical solutions suffer from large-amplitude spurious oscillations caused by membrane locking. As shown in Fig. 3, 32 CS elements in the circumferential direction result in accurate displacement values for R/t = 102, but the membrane force in the circumferential direction undergoes large-amplitude spurious oscillations\nnonetheless. Thus, whenever investigating whether or not a certain discretization suffers from membrane locking, it is not enough to only study the accuracy of the displacements, the accuracy of the membrane forces must be studied as well. Note that the amplitude of the oscillations obtained with 2 quadrature points per direction is greater than the amplitude of the oscillations obtained with 3 quadrature points despite that the relative error in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction obtained with 2 quadrature points is smaller than the relative error in L2 norm of the membrane force in the circumferential direction obtained with 3 quadrature points as shown in Fig. 3 c)."

Thus, even in a locking-free discretization, it is expected that more elements are needed to obtain a certain level of accuracy as the slenderness ratio increases. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no discretization method has shown to result in levels of accuracy independent of the slenderness ratio for this benchmark problem.

This benchmark problem is a bending-dominated problem with non-constant curvatures.\nWe initiate our convergence study with a uniform mesh composed of 2 \u00d7 1 quadratic elements (2 elements in the x direction and 1 element in the y direction). The midsurface of the shell is represented exactly since we are using quadratic NURBS. After that, we perform uniform hrefinement seven times. Using CS elements and CAS elements, Fig. 14 a) plots the convergence\nof the vertical displacement of the point A indicated in Fig. 13. The displacement values are normalized by the solution obtained using 256 \u00d7 128 CS elements of degree 9, which is used as a reference solution. The reference values of the vertical displacement at point A are \u22129.3128\u00d7 10\u22125, \u22126.3957 \u00d7 10\u22123, and \u22125.3059 \u00d7 10\u22121 for L/t = 102, 103, and 104, respectively. As shown in Fig. 14 a), the convergence of CS elements heavily deteriorates as the L/t ratio increases while the convergence of CAS elements is similar for the broad range of L/t values considered. Fig. 14 b) plots the ratio of the membrane strain energy to the total strain energy as the L/t ratio increases using 8\u00d74 CS elements and 8\u00d74 CAS elements. The numerical solution using 8\u00d74 CAS elements closely follows the reference solution, which uses 256 \u00d7 128 CS elements of degree 9. However, membrane locking causes the introduction of spurious membrane energy in the numerical solution obtained using 8\u00d7 4 CS elements as the L/t ratio increases.\nWe also solve this problem using 2\u00d72 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element to compute all the integrals as opposed to using 3\u00d73 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element. As shown in Fig. 15, CAS elements result in essentially the same accuracy regardless of whether 2 quadrature points per direction or 3 quadrature points per direction are used. Therefore, 2 quadrature points per direction can be used to decrease the computational time. However, CS elements with 2 quadrature points per direction are still a locking-prone discretization."

            "text": "In this work, linear Kirchhoff-Love shells are used to investigate how to effectively overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of shells. We developed an interpolationbased assumed-strain treatment, named continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements, that vanquishes membrane locking by bilinearly interpolating the membrane strains at the four corners of each element. This locking treatment results in assumed strains with C0 continuity across element boundaries. The effects of membrane locking are not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of membrane forces. The spurious oscillations of membrane forces can take place for fine meshes for which the displacement values are already accurate. Therefore, evaluating the efficacy of a locking treatment by only studying the accuracy of the displacements is not enough, the accuracy of the membrane forces needs to be studied as well. CAS elements, using either 2\u00d72 or 3\u00d73 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points per element, are an effective locking treatment since this element type results in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes\nand gets rid of the spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. CAS elements are computationally efficient since the computational cost scarcely increases with respect to the locking-prone CS elements. In addition, CAS elements outperform state-of-the-art element types based on Lagrange polynomials equipped with either assumed-strain or reduced-integration locking treatments. Future research directions include extending the proposed locking treatment to nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shells as well as other types of shells such as Reissner-Mindlin shells and solid shells."
