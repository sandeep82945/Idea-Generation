    "abstractText": "Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes, which can lead to renal failure and fatality. miRNAs are an important class of endogenous non-coding RNAs implicated in a wide range of biological processes and pathological conditions. This study aims to investigate the potential functional roles of miR-543 in DN and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-543 and TSPAN8 in kidney tissues of mice with DN. Western blot (WB) was used to measure the protein levels. CCK8 assay was employed to evaluate the proliferation of HK2 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the functional interaction between miR-543 and TSpan8. Results: The downregulation of miR-543 and upregulation of TSPAN8 were observed in kidney tissues of mice with DN. miR-543 mimic significantly decreased cell proliferation and autophagy in high-glucose (HG)-induced HK2 cells, and promoted cell fibrosis. We further identified a putative binding site between miR-543 and TSPAN8, which was validated by Dual luciferase reporter assay. The treatment of miR-543 mimic and miR-543 inhibitor could reduce or increase TSPAN8 protein level respectively. We further showed that the overexpression of TSPAN8 could attenuate HGinduced cell injury by reducing fibrosis and increase autophagy. The effects of miR-543 mimic in proliferation, fibrosis, and autophagy were rescued by TSPAN8 overexpression. Conclusions: Our study indicate that miR-543 mediates high-glucose induced DN via targeting TSPAN8. Interfering miR-543/TSPAN8 axis could serve as potential approach to ameliorate DN.",

            "text": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes, which can lead to renal failure and fatality [1, 2]. DN has been the main cause of chronic kidney disease, accounting for one-third of cases worldwide [3]. Due to the complex pathogenesis of DN, currently there is no specific treatment for DN. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of DN could provide insights into the treatments and prevention.\nmiRNAs are an important class of endogenous noncoding RNAs implicated in a wide range of biological processes and pathological conditions by modulating the expression of the downstream target genes [4]. Recently, a growing body of evidence has suggested the involvement of miRNAs in DN pathogenesis [5]. For example, He et\u00a0 al. demonstrated that miR-320a exacerbates renal\n*Correspondence: qwek114@163.com 1 Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, 287 Changhuai Road, Longzi lake District, Bengbu 233004, Anhui Province, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\ndysfunction in DN by sponging MafB and inhibiting the expressions of Nephrin and Gpx3 in podocytes [6]. In contrast, miR-30c plays a protective role against DN by inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of retinal endothelial cells through targeting Snail1/TGF\u03b21 signal pathway [7]. miR-543 seems to be implicated in inflammatory responses of a wide range of diseases. Xu et\u00a0 al. showed that exosome-derived miR-543 could reduce lung injury induced by radiation [8]. While in diabetic retinopathy, the inhibition of miR-543 activity could decrease high glucose (HG)-induced cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis [9].\nTSPAN8 is a member of membrane glycoprotein tetraspanins which are characterized by four highly conserved transmembrane domains. TSPAN8 has been recognized as an important factor in various diseases, such as tumor [10, 11], infectious diseases [12, 13], and immune disorders [14]. The upregulation of TSPAN8 promotes cancer cell stemness [11], and a high expression of TSPAN8 is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer [15], colorectal cancer [16], lung adenocarcinoma [17]. However, whether TSPAN8 plays a functional role in DN remains to be elucidated.\nIn this study, we examined the expression levels of miR-543 and TSPAN8 in DN mice and high glucose (HG) induced HK2 cells. We found that miR-543 was downregulated and TSPAN8 was upregulated in kidney tissues of mice with DN. Moreover, modulating miR-543 could regulate the proliferation, fibrosis, and autophagy in HK2 cells treated with high glucose. TSPAN8 was identified as a target gene of miR-543 and the effect of miR-543 TSPAN8 could be rescued by TSPAN8 overexpression. Our study indicate that miR-543 mediates high-glucose induced DN via targeting TSPAN8."

            "text": "We first examined the expression level of miR-543 and TSPAN8 in kidney tissue of DN mice and control mice by qRT-PCR. The results showed that miR-543 was significantly downregulated in DN group compared with the control group (Fig.\u00a01A). We also performed RNA FISH to examine the localization of miR-543 in kidney, and miR543 seemed to be expressed by different cells in both the\ncortex and medulla (Supplementary Fig.1) Meanwhile, the expression of TSPAN8 was significantly increased in kidney tissue of DN mice (Fig.1B). Spearman correlation coefficient test demonstrated that miR-543 expression level was negatively correlated with TSPAN8 expression in kidney tissues of DN mice (Fig.1C). These data suggest that both miR-543 and TSPAN8 are dysregulated in DN mouse model.\nmiR\u2011543 regulates the\u00a0proliferation, fibrosis, and\u00a0autophagy in\u00a0high\u2011glucose\u2011induced HK2 cell To investigate the potential role of miR-543 in DN, we applied miR-543 mimic in high glucose (HG)-induced HK2 cells as a cellular model of DN. HG-treated cells displayed a more elongated and fibroblast-like cell shape, which is reminiscent of fibrotic phenotype (Supplementary Fig.2). The efficiency of miR-543-mimic transfection was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig.2A). Compared to miRNC transfection, miR-543 was significantly increased after miR-543 mimic transfection in HG-induced cells (Fig.\u00a0 2A). CCK8 cell proliferation assays demonstrated that the HG treatment suppressed cell proliferation, which was further exacerbated by the overexpression of miR-543 (Fig.2B). Moreover, high-glucose treatment increased the expression of collagen IV (Col. IV) and fibronectin (FN), and miR-543 mimic further enhanced their expression (Fig.\u00a0 2C). We also investigated the change of autophagy-related proteins, which showed that the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, Beclin-1 level decreased, but the level of P62 increased upon HG treatment (2D).\nThe overexpression of miR-543 further augmented these changes. These results indicate that high glucose impairs cell proliferation, but promotes fibrosis and autophagy in HK2 cells. miR-543 acts as a promoting factor to further suppress HK-2 cell proliferation and autophagy, but promotes fibrosis in HG-induced HK2 cells.\nmiR\u2011543 targets TSPAN8 in\u00a0HG\u2011induced cells To identify the downstream target gene, the potential binding site of miR-543 was predicted by starbase (http:// starb ase. sysu. edu. cn/) and there is a putative binding site of miR-543 in the 3\u2019UTR of TSPAN8 (Fig.3A). To confirm their functional interaction, we performed dual luciferase reporter assay with WT and mutated binding site, with the empty vector (luci-NC) as the negative control. We found that the presence of miR-543 mimic significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of WT reporter, which was not observed in the mutated reporter or the negative control vector (Fig.3B). Besides, the mRNA and protein levels of TSPAN8 were reduced after miR-543 mimic\ntransfection, while miR-543 inhibitor increased TSPAN8 expression. (Fig.\u00a0 3C-D). Together, these data suggest miR-543 negatively regulates TSPAN8 in HG-induced cells.\nTSPAN8 reduces the\u00a0injury induced by\u00a0high glucose To explore the functional role of TSPAN8 in HG-induced cell model, we transfected HK2 cells with TSPAN8 overexpression vector. As shown in Fig.4A, the expression level of TSPAN8 was upregulated in HG-induced HK2 cells after transfecting with TSPAN8 vector. CCK8 assay demonstrated that high glucose could lead to suppression of cell proliferation and TSPAN8 overexpression partially rescued this effect (Fig.4B). In addition, the relative protein levels of LC3-II/LC3-I, Beclin-1 decreased,\nwhile fibronectin (FN), collagen type IV (Col. IV), P62 increased in HG-induced HK2 cells upon high glucose induction. TSPAN8 overexpression could partially reverse these effects (Fig.4C-D). These results indicate that TSPAN8 alleviates cell damages induced by HG through suppressing fibrosis and promoting autophagy.\nTSPAN8 alleviates the\u00a0cellular damages caused by\u00a0miR\u2011543 overexpression in\u00a0high glucose\u2011induced cells Given the observation that miR-543 negatively regulates TSPAN8, we further attempted to investigate whether miR-543 mediates high glucose-induced cell damage by targeting TSPAN8. In HG-induced HK2 cells, the cell proliferation was greatly reduced by miR-543mimic as compared with miR-543-NC and the effect of\nmiR-543 mimic was abrogated by TSPAN8 overexpression (Fig.\u00a0 5A). The proteins in fibrosis and autophagy were examined in HG-induced HK2 cells with miR-543mimic and TSPAN8 overexpression. The results showed that miR-543 promoted the decrease of relative ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1, and increased the levels of FN, Col. IV, and P62, suggesting that miR-543 promotes fibrosis and inhibits autophagy. However, TSPAN8 overexpression could reverse the effects of miR-543 in HGinduced HK2 cells (Fig.5B-C). Together, these data imply that miR-543 mediates high glucose-induced cell damage by targeting TSPAN8."

            "text": "DN eventually leads to the end-stage renal disease, which is a serious microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus [22]. Recently, many studies have attempted to identify the associated protein changes with DN pathophysiology. For instance, the disorder of inflammatory molecules and pathways like CCL2 and NF-kB pathway are implicated in the progression of DN [23]. However, the potential functions of non-coding RNAs in DN remain largely unknown.\nmiRNAs have emerged as a class of important noncoding RNAs implicated in the progression of DN. Liu et\u00a0al. showed that BMP-7 (Bone morphogenetic protein 7) could downregulate the expression level of miR-21, which in turns increase the expression of Smad7 and decrease the expression of Smad3. Consequently, BMP-7 suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix deposition to reduce kindey fibrosis in DN [24]. In one study regarding the protective role of Astragaloside on DN, Astragaloside suppresses podocyte apoptosis in rat DN model by targeting miR-378 [25]. Moreover, a previous study has demonstrated that metformin inhibits the senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells in DN by promoting the expression of RNA-bind protein MBNL1 and miR-130a-3p [26]. In this study, we found that miR543 is downregulated in the kidney tissue of DN mouse model, which is consistent with a previous study in which miR-543 has negative impact on diabetic retinopathy [9].\nThe functional roles of TSPAN8 have been explored in many cancers. For example, Zhu et\u00a0 al. found that TSPAN8 promotes the stemness and enhances the drugresistance of breast cancer [27]. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and melanoma, TSPAN8 also serves as a oncogenic factor to facilitate cell proliferation, invasion, and migration [16, 27, 28]. However, in this study we demonstrated that the TSPAN8 serves as a protective factor for DN. TSPAN8 is a downstream target of miR-543, which shows upregulation in the kidney tissue of DN mouse model. The differential roles of TSPAN8\nbetween cancers and DN may result from the difference in molecular network between cancer and inflammatory disease. Future works are needed to further investigate the mechanisms by which miR-543 is downregulated in DN, and validate the protective effect of TSPAN8 in DN mouse model. In addition, our study only focuses on the HK2 cells derived from proximal tubular cell in kidney. Whether miR-543 and TSPAN8 could exert similar effects on other cells in the glomerulus of kidney (such as podocyte and mesangial cells) need to be further investigated."
