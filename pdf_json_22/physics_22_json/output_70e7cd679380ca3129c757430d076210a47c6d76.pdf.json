    "abstractText": "A single microwave absorbent and simple coating structure cannot meet the increasing requirements for broadband and strong absorption. Three-dimensional printing is an effective way to prepare multi-component complex structure metamaterial absorbers, and the key is to prepare raw materials with excellent absorption properties, suitable for 3D printing. In this paper, CBCIP/PLA composite filament was prepared via a high-energy mixer and twin-screw extruder by compounding the dielectric loss material carbon black (CB) and the magnetic loss material carbonyl iron powder (CIP) with polylactic acid (PLA) as the matrix. The coaxial ring test piece was printed by FDM technology, and the microstructure of the composites was observed and analyzed by SEM. Meanwhile, the electromagnetic parameters of the composites were examined by a vector network analyzer, mainly studying the influence of the CB and CIP content and thickness on the microwave absorbing properties of the composite material. The results show that when the CB content is 20% and the CIP content is 30%, the CB-CIP/PLA composite has excellent microwave absorption and broad bandwidth. When the matching thickness is 1.6 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RL) reaches \u221251.10 dB; when the thickness is 1.7 mm, the effective absorption bandwidth (RL < \u221210 dB) is 5.04 GHz (12.96\u201318 GHz), nearly covering the whole Ku band. This work provides an efficient formulation and process to prepare an absorbing composite filament for FDM.",

            "text": "Microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) are an effective means of preventing electromagnetic pollution and protecting human health. Electromagnetic stealth technology has always been a research hotspot in the military industry, and MAMs are a key factor in this technology [1]. Therefore, MAMs have important research value and wide application prospects in civil and military fields [2]. At present, the development of thin, high-efficiency and broadband-absorbing materials has attracted much attention [3\u20135]. According to the loss mechanism, the absorbing agent is divided into the following three types: the dielectric type, the magnetic type and the resistive type. As a magnetic loss agent, carbonyl iron powder (CIP) has the advantages of low cost, high saturation magnetization and magnetic permeability and has attracted the attention of researchers. However, its high density makes it difficult to meet the low weight requirements [6,7]. Carbon-based materials, as dielectric loss agents, have the advantages of low density, large specific surface area, high thermal stability and great electrical conductivity. As users have increasing requirements for the comprehensive properties of absorbing materials, single iron-based or carbon-based absorbing agents have been unable to meet the needs. Performance complementarity can be achieved by combining CIP with carbon-based material. This can not only reduce the density but also provide it with both dielectric and magnetic losses, which can then be lightweight with broadband and strong absorption.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 5455. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15155455 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 5455 2 of 14\nLiu et al. [8] obtained C@CIPs composites by mechanical milling and other processes using MWCNTs and CIPs with silicone rubber as the matrix. Since the MWCNTs were coated on the surface of the CIPs, the electromagnetic parameters of the material were improved. When the thickness was 0.6 mm, the content of the MWCNTs was 5%, and the content of the CIPs was 45%; it had a certain wave absorbing performance, but its reflection loss was only \u22125.48 dB. Qing et al. [9] filled different mass fractions (1\u20136%) of carbon fiber (CF) and 65 wt.% carbonyl iron (CI) into epoxy/silicone resin to prepare absorbing coatings. The addition of CF increased the complex permittivity of the material but did not affect the complex permeability, and the combination of the two improved the absorption bandwidth. As the CF content increased or the thickness of the composite coating increased, the minimum reflection loss and the absorption band shifted to the lower frequency. When the CF content was 2%, and the coating thickness was 1 mm, the reflection loss was lower than \u221210 dB in the frequency range of 8\u201318 GHz. Ye et al. [10] used polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix to composite 20% carbonyl iron powder (CIP) with different mass fractions (0\u20135%) of graphene (RGO) to prepare an RGO\u2013CIP/PLA composite. When the thickness was 3 mm, and the RGO content was 4%, the reflection loss value reached \u221227.25 dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth was 2.922 GHz. At this time, the composite material had the best wave absorption performance. The aforementioned research tried to improve the microwave absorbing performance through the existence of synergy between CIP and carbon-based absorbing agents. However, these absorbing materials remain in the form of coatings. Currently, metamaterial absorbers with complex structures show better absorbing properties than coatings. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has a natural advantage in shaping such metamaterial absorbers. The key problem is how to prepare raw materials with excellent absorbing properties that cater to a 3D printing process. In this paper, PLA, CB and CIP serve as the matrix, dielectric loss absorbent and magnetic loss absorbent. The CB-CIP/PLA composite filament for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) was prepared by high-energy mixing and twin-screw melt extrusion process. The influence of the CB and CIP content and thickness on the absorbing properties was studied. The preparation of the filament is simple and inexpensive. Through the FDM process, the filament can be used for printing a metamaterial absorber, realizing the integration of material, design and manufacturing, which has broad application prospects."

According to Maxwell\u2019s equations, permittivity and permeability are interrelated, especially the movement of electric charge produces a magnetic field; therefore, part of the electric field energy is converted into magnetic energy and radiates outward, resulting in a negative \u00b5\u2032\u2032 [14,15].

            "text": "Generally, the absorbing properties of composites could be assessed by reflection loss (RL) and effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, the corresponding bandwidth of RL < \u221210 dB) [16\u201318]. RL is generally expressed as a negative value; the smaller the loss by reflection, the larger the loss by absorption. According to the value of RL, the percentage of absorption is shown in Table 2 [19,20].\nAccording to the transmit-line theory, RL is usually calculated from Equations (1) and (2) [21]: RL = 20lg \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Zin \u2212 Z0Zin + Z0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (1) Zin = Z0 \u221a \u00b5r \u03b5r tanh [ j ( 2\u03c0 f d c ) \u221a \u00b5r\u03b5r ] (2)\nwhere Z0 = \u221a\n\u00b5r \u03b5r \u2248 377\u2126 is the impedance of free space, Zin is the input impedance of the\nabsorber, \u03b5r is the complex permittivity, \u00b5r is the complex permeability, h is Planck constant, j is the imaginary unit, f is the frequency of the incident microwave, d is the thickness of the absorbing material and c is the velocity of light. Figure 4 shows the influence of the CB and CIP contents on the RL of the composite materials at different thicknesses. It can be seen that the minimum RL of each component of the composite shifted to the low-frequency band as the thickness of the absorber layer increased. In Figure 4a, when the thickness was 1 mm, the RL value of each group did not reach \u221210 dB, indicating that the overall absorbing performance was poor. When the thickness was increased to 1.5 mm, the CB20-CIP10 composite showed a peak at high frequency (16\u201318 GHz), but the effective absorption bandwidth was only 1.68 GHz. As the thickness increased to 2.0 mm, the peak value of RL gradually shifted to the left, and the effective absorption bandwidth increased obviously. The CB20-CIP10, CB20-CIP30 and CB20-CIP50 composite had better absorbing effects, among which the CB20-CIP30 composite had the widest effective absorption bandwidth. It reached 4.08 GHz (10.88\u201314.96 GHz), and the minimum RL was about \u221225 dB. However, as the thickness continued to increase, the effective absorption bandwidth became narrower, and the absorbing effect gradually weakened. Figure 5 shows the three-dimensional diagram of the reflection loss and thickness frequency of the composites with different components. It can be observed that the absorption effect of the three groups of composite materials with a CB content of 5% was poor. When the thickness was 1.0\u20132.0 mm, the CB content was 20%, and the CIP content was 10% and 30%, the absorbing performance was improved. By observing the 3D projection map, it can be noticed that the minimum RL gradually shifted to a low frequency as the thickness increased. Similarly, as the thickness increases, the EAB with RL less than \u221210 dB shifts to the lower frequency band [22]. The shift of the minimum RL could be explained by the quarter-wavelength cancellation theory [23]. When the thickness of absorbing material is precisely 1/4 of the incident wave length, the phase difference between the incident and reflected electromagnetic waves is 180\u25e6.

Dielectric loss mainly includes conduction loss and polarization relaxation loss (electron polarization, ion polarization, dipole polarization and interface polarization), among which electron polarization and ion polarization usually occur in the THz and PHz range, so they are not considered in the GHz range. The dielectric loss can be explained by the Debye medium theory. The Cole-Cole curve, which is the relationship of \u03b5\u2032 and \u03b5\u2032\u2032 , can be expressed as shown in the following Equation (5) [35\u201337]:(\n\u03b5\u2032 \u2212 \u03b5s + \u03b5\u221e 2\n)2 + (\u03b5\u2032\u2032 )2 = ( \u03b5s \u2212 \u03b5\u221e\n2\n)2 (5)\nwhere \u03b5s and \u03b5\u221e are the static dielectric constant and the optical dielectric constant, respectively. It can be seen from Equation (5) that the curves of \u03b5\u2032 and \u03b5\u2032\u2032 are a single semicircle, usually defined as a Cole-Cole semicircle, and each semicircle corresponds to one Debye relaxation process, while the appearance of the upward tail indicates that conductive loss contributes to the dielectric loss [38]. The \u03b5\u2032 \u2212 \u03b5\u2032\u2032 curves of the CB20-CIP30 composite are shown in Figure 10a. It can be seen that there were several semicircles with overlapping parts, indicating that multiple polarization relaxations occurred. The appearance of a straight line at the tail indicates the contribution of conductive loss was enhanced, and the\nMaterials 2022, 15, 5455 12 of 14\nappearance of irregular semicircles indicates that other loss mechanisms existed, such as interface polarization and dipole polarization, etc. [27,39].

( ) l -Colo curve, (b) C0 value of the CB20-CIP30 composite.\nIt was reported that magnetic losses mainly come from domain wall resonance, hysteresis loss, eddy current loss, natural resonance and exchange resonance, among which the domain wall resonance mainly appears in the MHz region. As a soft magnetic material, CIP hysteresis loss is so low that it can be ignored [23,40]. Therefore, eddy current loss, natural resonance and exchange resonance are the three important elements that could be responsible for the magnetic loss. The eddy current loss is particularly associated with thickness d and conductivity \u03c3, as shown in the following Equation (6) [31,41]:\n\u00b5\u2032\u2032 \u2248 2\u03c0\u00b50(\u00b5 \u2032)2\u03c3d2 f\n3 (6)\nwhere \u00b50 is the permeability of the vacuum. The value of C0 is commonly used to express the effect of eddy current on magnetic loss, as shown in the following Equation (7) [42].\nC0 = \u00b5\u2032\u2032 ( \u00b5\u2032 )\u22122 f\u22121 \u2248 2\u03c0\u00b50\u03c3d2\n3 (7)\nIf the agnetic loss only originates from the eddy current losses, the value of C0 should remain const nt over the entire frequency range. However, the value of C0 was not constant in the 2\u201318 GHz range, indicating ddy current loss was not the only magnetic loss mechanis , as shown in Figure 10b. Therefore, the magnetic loss of the CB20-CIP30 composite was the result of the synergistic effect of the natural resonance, exchange resonance and eddy current loss."
