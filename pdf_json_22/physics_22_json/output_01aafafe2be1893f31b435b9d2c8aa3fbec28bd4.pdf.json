    "abstractText": "We calculate amplitudes for 2D vacuum transitions by means of the Euclidean methods of Coleman-De Luccia (CDL) and Brown-Teitelboim (BT), as well as the Hamiltonian formalism of Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP). The resulting similarities and differences in between the three approaches are compared with their respective 4D realisations. For CDL, the total bounce can be expressed as the product of relative entropies, whereas, for the case of BT and FMP, the transition rate can be written as the difference of two generalised entropies. By means of holographic arguments, we show that the Euclidean methods, as well as the Lorentzian cases without non-extremal black holes, provide examples of an AdS2/CFT1 \u2282 AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. Such embedding is not possible in the presence of islands for which the setup corresponds to AdS2/CFT1 6\u2282 AdS3/CFT2. We find that whenever an island is present, up-tunnelling is possible.",

            "text": "Together with the quantum study of black hole physics, the study of vacuum transitions provides a rich arena to explore quantum aspects of gravity, and may shed some light towards a proper understanding of quantum gravity. Recent progress in the study of black hole information (for a review see [1]) has been achieved, in great part, studying concrete examples in 2D, and it is natural to explore if the concepts used there, such as quantum extremal surfaces, generalised entropies and islands may also play a role in addressing questions regarding other physical systems involving quantum aspects of gravity, namely, early universe cosmology and vacuum transitions. The present work aims at providing a general perspective towards understanding vacuum transitions in 2D. The reason for doing it is multi-fold. Among the most important, we highlight the following motivations:\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n1. To understand, from the simple 2D set-up, the stability of vacua with different values and signs of the vacuum energy, in particular having in mind the string theory landscape.\n2. To study the possible emergence of unitarity-violating behaviour, such as encountered in the black hole information paradox [2\u20134], in a different physical system.\n3. To identify potential holographic interpretations of vacuum transitions, [5, 6], and their generalisations to higher-dimensional holographic embeddings and defect field theories.\n4. To explore the possibility of assigning an effective entropy to transition amplitudes for spacetimes with arbitrary sign of the cosmological constant. The main motivation for this comes from recent developments towards studying the emergence of spacetime from entanglement [7\u201310].\nThroughout the last four decades, the study of quantum transitions in 4D has been addressed by means of three main approaches, differing in terms of the way the cosmological constants are being defined, and the use of Euclidean or Lorentzian techniques. In order of appearance in the literature, they are:\n\u2022 Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) [11], describing transitions between different local minima in a scalar field potential, following a Euclidean approach.\n\u2022 Brown-Teitelboim (BT) [12], Euclidean vacuum transitions mediated by brane nucleation.\n\u2022 Fischler-Morgan-Polchinski (FMP) [13], transitions between two spacetimes with different cosmological constants, by means of the Hamiltonian formalism in Lorentzian signature.\nIn each case, the quantity of interest is the transition amplitude, \u0393. In the Euclidean methods, this is obtained from the bounce, B, defined as the difference between the Euclidean action evaluated on the instanton SE |inst and on the background SE |bckgr:\n\u0393 \u223c exp (\u2212B) , B def.= SE |inst \u2212 SE |bckgr. (1.1)\nThe main motivation for this approach follows from the relation between the WKB approximation and vacuum transitions, with the latter being viewed as the quantum mechanical process of a particle crossing a potential barrier. The Lorentzian method of FMP, instead, proposes an alternative definition for \u0393; the transition amplitude from a spacetimeM1 to anotherM2, is defined as the relative ratio of two probabilities,\n\u03931\u21922 def.= Pnothing\u2192M1/Wall/M2 Pnothing\u2192M1\n= |\u03a8nothing\u2192M1/Wall/M2 |2\n|\u03a8nothing\u2192M1 |2 , (1.2)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwith both nucleations out of nothing being identified with Hartle-Hawking (HH)-like states [14]. This is a conditional probability, with the numerator and denominator corresponding to the end point of the transition and the original background spacetime, respectively. In an earlier paper, [15] (see also [16, 17]), we recovered the original BT result for dS4 \u2192dS4,1 by means of the FMP method, with total action given by\nlog \u0393dS\u2192dS = \u03b7\u03c0\n2G\n[ [(H2o \u2212H2I )2 + \u03ba2(H2o +H2I )]Ro\n4\u03baH2oH2I + 12H2o \u2212 1 2H2I\n] . (1.3)\nHere Ho, HI refer to the Hubble parameter for the spacetimes outside and inside the bubble, \u03ba is the tension of the bubble, Ro its radius at nucleation and \u03b7 = \u00b11. Under mutual exchange of the 2 vacua, the first term in (1.3), coming from the brane, is symmetric, whereas the other two terms just flip their sign. From this follows that, the ratio between the direct and reverse transition reads\n\u0393o\u2192I \u0393I\u2192o = e \u03b7\u03c0 2G\n( 1 H2o \u2212 1 H2 I ) = e\u03b7(So\u2212SI). (1.4)\nFor \u03b7 = 1, since So and SI are the entropies of the corresponding de Sitter spacetimes, this is a statement of detailed balance. According to [19], such entropic argument cannot be extended to spacetimes other than dS,2 due to the topological change the spacetime would undergo as a consequence of the change in sign of its curvature. Furthermore, upon taking a vanishing background cosmological constant, (1.3) diverges, thereby forbidding up-tunnelling from a flat spacetime. In such case, (1.4) would thereby suggest that the background entropy is divergent. However, this is clearly in contrast with the common lore that the Minkowski vacuum should have vanishing entropy instead. Following the steps of [13], whose work was in turn motivated by [20],3 we showed in [15] that this issue can be addressed by introducing a Schwarzschild black hole in the background, and realising Minkowski as the limit of the vanishing mass of the black hole itself. Indeed, the total action, in such case, reads\nSSch\u2192dS = \u03b7\u03c0 2G [Sbounce \u2212 Sbckg] = \u03b7\u03c0 2G [ Sbounce \u2212 4G2M2 ] , (1.5)\nand clearly remains finite in the formal limit4 lim M\u21920 . The question of whether, and how, we can possibly reconcile these apparently contrasting behaviours partly motivated the present\n1The outer and inner vacua are denoted by o, I, respectively. 2The definition of the entropy for the static dS patch is a longstanding matter of debate. Motivated by our findings, we will be arguing that the entropy definition arising from the study of vacuum transitions is only meaningful when considering a finite portion of the dS patch. Our findings are therefore in agreement with those of others, such as, e.g. [18], where the authors outline the need to introduce a boundary to dS for assigning a notion of entropy to it.\n3The configuration described by Farhi, Guth and Guven, [20], has recently been addressed in the literature, [21], and claimed to be unsuitable for the application of detailed balance. However, we will be able to prove that the claims made in [21] are not applicable in our setup given the locality of the processes being described.\n4Note that this limit is only approximate since the lower bound on a black hole mass is the Planck scale.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwork, with the possibility to correctly assign an entropy to the spacetimes involved. Before embarking in the analysis outlined in the present work, our original interpretation was that transitions were taking place in local regions of spacetime; as such, topologically-inspired arguments for the inapplicability of detailed balance could be dropped. But still, a probably more interesting question emerged: can we assign an entropic interpretation to the direct amplitude itself and not only to the ratio of the amplitudes, independently of detailed balance? As we shall see, the answer will turn out to be affirmative in 2D. In achieving this result, holography will turn out to play a key role. Since its first formulation, [6], there have been many generalisations: AdS/BCFT, [22], wedge holography (codim-2), [23], T T\u0304 , [24\u201329], the dS/CFT, [30], and dSD+1/dSD correspondence, [31], etc. Also, the introduction of islands, [32\u201334], has pushed the holographic duality to its currently most extreme formulation, since it involves the entanglement of spatially-disconnected regions. Throughout our treatment we will encounter applications5 of all such cases within the context of 2D vacuum transitions. Our main result in this article will be to find expressions like (1.3) for vacuum transition rates in the 2-dimensional case. We will perform the calculation in all 3 formalisms outlined above (CDL, BT and FMP), providing their corresponding holographic interpretation. Given that the BT case has already been addressed by the authors in their original work, [12], we will be using it as a \u201cstandard ruler\u201d to check the results obtained by other means. In doing so, however, we will not simply take it for granted, but, rather, derive it from the suitably adjusted setup of CDL in 2D, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been dealt with explicitly in the literature. As outlined in section 2, the common starting point for both Euclidean methods will be the Almheiri-Polchinski action, [55],\nS2D = \u222b d2x \u221a \u2212g [ \u03c62 R+ \u03bb \u03c6\u20322 \u2212U(\u03c6), ] (1.6)\nwhich resembles the starting point of [11] for decays in the presence of gravity. Due to the specific features of the 2D setup, though, the Ricci scalar or the scalar kinetic term can be eliminated by a suitable rescaling of the metric and of the potential. As we shall see, removing the \u03c6\u2032 2-term we can calculate the transition amplitude either with or without the thin-wall approximation, proper to CDL. On the other hand, upon removing the Ricci scalar term, and adding suitable boundary terms ensuring the action satisfies a variational principle, we recover the gravitational action of BT. The importance of the addition of the boundary terms will be highlighted in due course, but it is worth stressing that, for the case in which the kinetic term is suppressed, they trivially vanish in either vacuum. Correspondingly, this is mapped to the fact that the calculation by means of the CDL method in 2D describes transitions in absence of gravity. From the holographic interpretation, we will see that, indeed, the total bounce is reminiscent of the entropy of an internal CFT2, which geometrises the RG-flow interpolating between different values of the dilaton. For the case of BT, instead, the addition of the boundary terms, accounting for the presence of gravity, is encoded in boundary entropies of defect CFT1 s placed at the endpoints\n5For other recent applications of entanglement and islands within a cosmological setup see, e.g. [35\u201351].\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nof the bulk CFT2, which in turn are dual to the end-of-the-world (ETW) branes, [56, 57], where the spacetimes undergoing the transition live (cf. figure 1). This is illustrated in figure 1. A more detailed explanation will be provided in section 2. This work is structured as follows: in section 2 we extend the CDL formalism to 2D, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explicitly done in the literature. In doing so, we use the JT-gravity theory analysed by Almheiri and Polchinski [55]. Thanks to the nature of the 2D setup, under suitable Weyl transformation, we can trade the kinetic term for the dilaton with the Ricci scalar. We thereby perform the calculation in both ways, showing that the case without the kinetic term describes transitions in absence of gravity. Upon removing the Ricci term, instead, the action can be brought back to the same form as in BT, up to a boundary term whose role is essential to account for the gravitational interaction. The second part of the section provides a brief overview of the 2D treatment of BT, as already addressed by the authors in their original work, [12]. In section 3, we turn to the Hamiltonian formalism of [13] applied to 2D JT-gravity [58\u2013 60], and determine the transition rates in absence of black holes, finding that up-tunneling from and down-tunneling to Minkowski spacetimes are not allowed. In section 4, we generalise the results of section 3 by adding a constant term in the action that allows for non-extremal black holes to emerge, as long as their mass lies within a certain range to be specified in due course. The range emerges from requiring the existence of two distinct physical turning points. We conclude that, upon adding a black hole of suitable mass on either side, the flat spacetime limit does not violate unitarity, and we are still left with a well defined transition amplitude. In section 5 we provide a possible holographic interpretation of the total bounces and actions calculated throughout our work.Altogether, this leads to an exhaustive explanation of figure 1. In particular, we find that the corresponding expression for the transition rate in presence of gravity, and in absence of black holes, is given by the difference of entropies of T T\u0304 -deformed CFTs, hence illustrating the locality of the nucleation process. Upon adding black holes, within a suitable mass range, instead, the total action can be expressed as the difference of generalised entropies, with an island emerging beyond a critical value of the black hole mass. In particular, we show that, whenever an island is present, up-tunnelling is always possible. Furthermore, the results obtained by means of the FMP method are found to agree with the expression provided by [61] for describing mutual approximation of boundary states belonging to different CFTs under suitable parametric redefinition. The\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nBT results, which in section 4 were proved to be equivalent to the FMP results in absence of black holes, can be expressed in terms of entropies of BCFT2s with two nontrivial boundary conditions dual to ETW branes. Furthermore, the CDL result can be recast in the form of an entropy product of a CFT2, thereby showing agreement with the expectations following from the analytic behaviour encountered in section 2. One of the key results of our work can therefore be synthesised by saying that the total action (or bounce) associated to the direct vacuum transition process carries an internal entropic interpretation. In particular, for the BT and FMP cases, they can always be expressed as the difference of generalised entropies. However, only the formalism of [13] provides the right setup for an island to emerge. Following a brief summary of our findings, at the end of section 5, we relate our work to other recent developments."

However, along the way, we encounter significant differences, resulting in different final expressions for the bounces. A physical explanation for this will be outlined throughout the treatment, leaving a more detailed justification to the final core section of the work, namely 5, where, by means of holographic arguments, we will be showing the complementarity of the methods applied."

As already argued by the authors of [11], the final amplitude does not depend on the particular profile of the potential. However, their calculation still relies upon the potential exhibiting specific features.

Assuming \u03b8-independence of \u03c6 and \u03c9, (2.22) reads\n\u2202r\n( e\u22122\u03c9\nr \u2202r \u03c6\n2 )\n= 0. (2.27)\nTo obtain an explicit expression for (2.5), we need to specify what we mean by the minima of the potential and the wall separating them within the Almheiri-Polchinski setup. We now turn to describing both, one at a time.( \u03c62 )\u2032 = 0: defining the vacua. For \u03c62=const., (2.26) implies Uo=0 and (2.27) is trivially satisfied. Redefining u def.= ln r, (2.26) becomes\n2 \u03c9\u0308 = \u2212r2 e2\u03c9 \u2202\u03c62Uo = \u2212\u2202\u03c62Uoe2(\u03c9+u), (2.28)\nwhere \u00b7 def.= \u2202u. Redefining \u03c9 + u def.= f , equation (2.28) becomes\n2 f\u0308 = \u2212\u2202\u03c62Uoe2f . (2.29)\nThe first equation in (2.26) shows that \u2202\u03c62Uo def.= 2\u039b = constant. It defines the cosmological constant of the 2D spacetime. We can therefore determine the solutions corresponding to dS and AdS by respectively taking positive or negative values of such constant:\n1) \u039b > 0 equation (2.29) is solved by\n\u03c1 = e\u03c9 = ef\u2212u = 2a\u221a 2\u039b cosh(au+ b) r . (2.30)\n2) \u039b < 0 equation (2.29) is solved by\n\u03c1 = e\u03c9 = ef\u2212u =  a\u221a 2\u039b (au+b) r a\u221a 2\u039b sin(h)(au+b) r a\u221a\n2\u039b sin(au+b) r .\n(2.31)\nThe three cases outlined in (2.31) correspond to the Poincar\u00e9 patch of AdS2, global AdS2 and an AdS2 black hole, respectively. Figure 4 helps visualising the regions covered by the different coordinate systems. For either sign of the cosmological constant, the radial coordinate can be redefined, such that the line element takes the following form:\nds2 = dr\u03022 + f(r\u0302) d\u03b82. (2.32)\nThe corresponding redefinitions are\nr = (\n1 K\ntan (\u221a\n2\u039b r\u0302 2\n) )1/a for \u039b > 0, (2.33)\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nz = 0z = \u221e\nr\u221e r = 0\nz = 0\nrH\nr\u221e\nz = 0\nrH\nFigure 4. The picture on the l.h.s. shows the different regions of AdS2 covered by the global (the whole rectangular strip), Poincar\u00e8 (on the r.h.s. of the red lines) and BTZ black hole (the shaded blue region). For the purpose of interest to us, we will only be using the latter, given that the first two are associated to the infinite regions of spacetime. The figures in the middle and on the right, show that the BTZ metric effectively covers only a portion of the Poincar\u00e8 disk.\nand\nln |a ln |r|+ b|\u221a 2\u039b\n= r\u0302 , r = (\n1 K\ntanh (\u221a\n2\u039b r\u0302 2\n) )1/a for \u039b < 0, (2.34)\nfor the 1/r ln r and 1sinh cases, respectively. For a = 1, b = 0, (2.30) and (2.31) reduce to:\n\u03c1dS2 = 2\u221a\n2\u039b (r2 + 1) , \u03c1AdS2 =  a\u221a 2\u039b ln |r| r 2i\u221a 2\u039b (r2\u22121) 2i\u221a\n2\u039b (r2i\u22121).\n(2.35)\nUnder a suitable coordinate transformation, these results are equivalent to the ones obtained by Almheiri and Polchinski. The first and third solutions in (2.31) are not relevant for our purposes, given that they correspond to the Poincar\u00e8 patch, and global AdS. In figure 4, they correspond to the region inside the red triangle and the green shaded strip, respectively. Instead, we will restrict to the \u03c1 \u223c 1sinh case, corresponding to the BTZ black hole, [67], (the region outside the black hole is shaded in blue), which is a quotient of the Poincar\u00e8 patch.\n(\u03c62)\u2032 6= 0: defining the wall. We now turn to the case in which (\u03c62)\u2032 6= 0. Integrating over (2.27) twice, we find, [55]\n(\u03c62)\u2032 = r c1 e2\u03c9 \u21d2 \u03c62+ \u2212 \u03c6\u03042 = c1 2 \u222b r\u0304 0 dr r e2\u03c9, (2.36)\nwhere \u03c6\u03042 def.= \u03c6 2 ++\u03c62\u2212\n2 is the mean value of the field between the two minima. This defines the turning point (\u03c6\u03042, r\u0304) in analogy with the Euclidean formalism of [11]. Up to now, the constant c1 is unspecified. However, its importance is central in our treatment, as will be explained later.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n\u03b1\nr\u0304\nFigure 5. The brane in 2D is mapped to a particle/antiparticle pair (blue dots). The angle\n\u03b1 def.=\n\u221a\n\u039b 2 r\u0302, denotes the location of the brane separating the background (green) from the interior of the bubble (purple). The corresponding value of r is obtained by the intersection shown in the figure, namely from tan(h)\u03b1. Note that r\u0304 = 1 corresponds to \u03b1 = \u03c04 .\nThe radius of the nucleated bubble is parameterised by the r\u0302-variable, defined in (2.33) and (2.34) for dS2 and AdS2, respectively. Setting a = 1, b = 0, it is a monotonic function and sgn r\u0302 \u2261 sgnr. It therefore follows that we can trade the integration over r\u0302 with that over r without loss of generality. From the equations of motion, we know that Uo = 0 at any minimum, but different values of \u03c62 come with a corresponding value of c1 triggering the flow described by (2.36). Equation (2.36) describes the flow from one value of the dilaton to that at the turning point\n\u03c62+ \u2212 \u03c62\u2212 = c+1 \u222b r\u0304\n0 dr r e2\u03c9 = c\n+ 1 \u039b+ \u222b r\u0304 0 dr 2r (r2 \u2212 1)2 = \u2212 c+1 \u039b+ [ 1 r\u03042 \u2212 1 + 1 ] . (2.37)\nEquation (2.37) can also be interpreted as describing the running of the cosmological constant along the RG-flow originating from \u03c62+ and parameterised by c+1 . Upon integrating over the reverse flow, defined by c\u22121 \u2261 \u2212c + 1 , we get\n\u03c62\u2212 \u2212 \u03c62+ = \u2212 c\u22121 \u039b\u2212 [ 1 r\u03042 \u2212 1 + 1 ] . (2.38)\nConsistency between (2.37)and (2.38) leads to a constraint for the turning point r\u0304, which in turn places constraints on the parameters of the theory of either vacua. A similar analysis can be carried out for dS and mixed AdS/dS transitions, and the respective constraints arising from this procedure can be summarised as follows\nr\u03042 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 AdS2\u2192AdS2 = 1 + \u039b\u2212\u039b+ , r\u03042 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dS2\u2192dS2 \u039b+ \u039b\u2212 \u2212 1\nr\u03042 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 AdS2\u2194dS2 = 12 \u2212\u039b+ + \u039b\u2212\u039b+ \u2212 \u039b\u2212 \u00b1 \u221a(\u039b+ + \u039b\u2212 \u039b+ \u2212 \u039b\u2212 )2 + 8  . (2.39)\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nFor dS2 \u2192dS2 processes, the constraint r\u0304 > 0 requires \u039b+ > \u039b\u2212, implying only downtunnellling is allowed, wheras for transitions of the AdS2 \u2194 dS2 kind, only the + solution ensures r\u0304 is physical.\nMinkowski vacua. Before turning to the evaluation of the bounces, we wish to highlight that the system of equations (2.26) and (2.27), together with the following expression valid at local minima of the potential\nUo \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 min = \u03c62 \u2202\u03c62 Uo + 2c1 = 0 (2.40)\nimplies that the Minkowski vacuum cannot provide a stable solution originating a nontrivial flow. Indeed, from (2.40), for \u039b = 0, it follows that c1 = 0, implying the flow generated by such vacuum defines a flat direction in the space of metrics and does not end in a vacuum other than Minkowski itself. Because of this, at least for the moment, we will not be analysing any transitions involving such spacetimes, and we will only be looking at the flat limit of the bounces by taking lim\n\u039b\u00b1\u21920 .\nThe total bounce. The total bounce is the result from the sum of 2 contributions,\nBtot = Bwall +Bin, (2.41)\ngiven that Bout = 0. The scalar field is constant in a local minimum of the potential, and therefore Uo = 0 due to (2.26). From (2.26), the Euclidean actions for (A)dS2, read\nSE \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dS2 = \u22122\u03c0 \u03c62\u2212 \u222b r\u0304 0 dr r e2\u03c9 \u2202\u03c62Uo = 4\u03c0 \u03c62\u2212 [ 1 r\u03042 + 1 \u2212 1 ] , (2.42)\nSE \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 AdS2 = \u22122\u03c0 \u03c62\u2212 \u222b r\u0304 0 dr r e2\u03c9 \u2202\u03c62Uo = 4\u03c0 \u03c62\u2212 [ 1 r\u03042 \u2212 1 + 1 ] , (2.43)\nfrom which the inner bounces associated to any possible transition between (A)dS2 spacetimes, can be evaluated. Inside the wall, the bounce reads\nBwall = 2\u03c0 \u222b r\u0304\n0 d r r e2\u03c9\n[ \u2212\u03c62 \u2202\u03c62 Uo + Uo(\u03c6) + \u03c62+ \u2202\u03c62 Uo(\u03c6+)\u2212 Uo(\u03c6+) ] = \u22122\u03c0 \u03c62 Uo \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6 2 \u2212\n\u03c62+\n+ 4\u03c0 c1 \u222b \u03c62+ \u03c62\u2212 d ( \u03c62 ) [ Uo(\u03c6) + \u03c62+ \u039b+ ]\n= 4\u03c0 c1\nS1 + 4\u03c0 ( \u03c62\u2212 \u2212 \u03c62+ ) , (2.44)\nwhere\nS1 def.= \u222b \u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ d ( \u03c62 ) Uo(\u03c6) with Uo = \u2212 e\u22122\u03c9 r ( r(\u03c62)\u2032 )\u2032 , (2.45)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwhere the last expression follows from the equation of motion for \u03c62. According to the specific configuration being studied, there are 4 possible cases:\nBwall = 4\u03c0\u2206\u03c6 2 \u00b7  ( 2\u03c6 2 \u2212 \u03c62+ + 1 ) ( 2\u03c6 2 \u2212 \u03c62+ \u2212 1 ) ( 2\u03c6 2 \u2212 \u03c62+ + 1 ) ( 2\u03c6\n2 \u2212 \u03c62+ \u2212 1\n)\n\u21d2 Btot = 4\u03c0\u2206\u03c6 2 \u00b7  ( \u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ + 2 ) [AdS2 \u2192 AdS2] ( 3\u03c6 2 \u2212 \u03c62+ \u2212 2 ) [dS2 \u2192 dS2] ( 3\u03c6 2 \u2212 \u03c62+ + 2 ) [AdS2 \u2192 dS2] ( \u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ \u2212 2 ) [dS2 \u2192 AdS2]\n(2.46) where \u2206\u03c62 def.= \u03c62\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6 2 +.\nNote that, upon taking lim \u039b\u00b1\u21920 , all transition amplitudes vanish. In particular, there is no 2D counterpart for, either, dS4 \u2192 Mink4 nor Mink4 \u2192 AdS4 processes, which were originally addressed in [11].\nCDL in the thin-wall approximation. In the above derivation of the total bounces, a closed form expression could be found without needing to resort to the thin-wall approximation. It is therefore interesting to see what the result might be for the case in which we were to apply the standard procedure as in [11]. The starting point is still an O(2)-symmeytric instanton solution\nds2 = d\u03be2 + \u03c12(\u03be)d\u03b82. (2.47)\nThe radial coordinate used in our derivations, r, is related to \u03be in (2.47) as follows6\nr\u0302 = \u221a\n2 \u039b tan\n\u22121 r \u21d2 dr\u0302 = \u221a\n2 \u039b\ndr 1 + r2 = \u221a 2 \u039b cos 2 \u221a\u039b 2 \u03be  dr = d\u03be, (2.48) and to the function \u03c1CDL in (2.47) as\n\u03c1CDL = \u221a\n2 \u039b\nr\n1 + r2 . (2.49)\nIn particular, we will be looking at the case of dS2 \u2192Mink2 transitions. In order to do so, we need to re-express the Euclidean action\nSE = 2\u03c0 \u222b r\u0304\n0 dr\n[ 2\u03c62(r\u03c9\u2032)\u2032 + rUoe2\u03c9 ] , (2.50)\nin terms of the new variables (r\u0302, \u03c1) or (\u03be, \u03c1). For Minkowski, r\u0302 \u2261 r \u2261 \u03be \u2261 \u03c1. The Euclidean action therefore simply vanishes on the inside. For dS, we know that e2\u03c9 = 2\u039b(r2+1)2 ,\n6Notice that fo AdS the same arguments follow, the only difference being that trigonometric functions turn into hyperbolic functions due to the negative sign of \u039b.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nas previously derived. On the inside, the dilaton is constant, and the Euclidean action reduces to\nSin = 2\u03c0\u03c62r\u03c9\u2032 with \u03c9\u2032 = (e\u03c9)\u2032\ne\u03c9 = \u22122\u03c1CDL \u221a \u039b 2 . (2.51)\nFor ease of notation, we will simply write the radial coordinate as \u03c1. Inverting the last equality in (2.51), we get\nr = 1\u2212 \u221a\n1\u2212 2\u039b\u03c12\u221a 2\u039b\u03c1\n\u21d2 Sin = \u22122\u03c0\u03c62 ( 1\u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 2\u039b\u03c1\u03042 ) . (2.52)\nThe wall\u2019s bounce, instead, reads\nBwall =\u03c0\u03c1\u0304 \u03c6\u03042 S1 + 4\u03c0(\u03c62\u2212 \u2212 \u03c62+), (2.53)\nwhere we made use of the thin-wall approximation for extracting \u03c1\u0304 from the integral and have also defined the tension of the wall in terms of the rescaled potential in the Einstein frame, Unewo\nS1 = 2 \u222b d\u03be U new o = 2 \u222b d\u03be [ \u03c6\u22122Uo \u2212 \u2202\u03c62Uo ] . (2.54)\nFor the case of a dS2 \u2192Mink2 transition, the total bounce therefore reads Btot = \u22122\u03c0\u03c62+ ( 1 + \u221a 1\u2212 2\u039b\u03c1\u03042 ) + \u03c0\u03c1\u0304 \u03c6\u03042 S1, (2.55)\nand it is extremised at \u03c1\u0304 = S1 \u03c6\u0304 2\n4\u039b \u03c62+ \u221a 1 + S 2 1 \u03c6\u0304 4\n8\u039b\u03c64+\n.

(2.57) In a similar fashion, for the generic (A)dS2 \u2192(A)dS2 case, the total bounce reads\nB (A)dS2\u2192(A)dS2 tot = 2\u03c0\u03c62\u2212 ( 1 + \u221a 1\u2212 2\u039b\u2212\u03c1\u03042 ) \u2212 2\u03c0\u03c62+ ( 1 + \u221a 1\u2212 2\u039b+\u03c1\u03042 ) + \u03c0\u03c1\u0304 \u03c6\u03042 S1 .\n(2.58)"

(2.59)\nThe \u03c6\u2032 2-term can be restored by reabsorbing \u03c62 in the metric. In particular, under the rescalings \u03c1\u2192 \u03c6\u03c1 and Uo \u2192 \u03c6\u22122Uo def.= 16\u039bBT , (2.59) turns into\nSAP = 8\u03c0 \u222b dz [ \u2212u\u2032 2 + 4\u039bBT e2f ] , (2.60)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwith f def.= ln\u03c6 + \u03c9 def.= u + \u03c9. Before delving into further calculations, some important remarks are in order. The equations of motion undoubtably play a key role within the CDL formalism, as can be appreciated by direct inspection of their original work in 4D, [11]. When performing the calculation for transition amplitudes within the AP setup (once having removed the kinetic term for the scalar field), the crucial relation that allowed us to circumvent the need to resort to the thin-wall approximation (upon which [11] rely) was the change of variables resulting from requiring vanishing diagonal components for the energy momentum tensor, (2.20). As previously argued, in polar coordinates, they reduce to\n\u2202r\n( e\u22122\u03c9\nr \u2202r\u03c6\n2 )\n= 0 \u21d2 \u2202z (u \u2202zu) = (uu\u2032)\u2032 = 0, (2.61)\nwhere z def.= ln r. At the same time, the term on the r.h.s. in (2.61) also emerges upon integrating by parts the kinetic term in (2.60). Correspondingly, we are led to consider the\nfiollowing quantity, MADM def.= uu\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 bdy , which can be identified with the ADM mass of the spacetime. When removing the kinetic term in LAP , the dilaton is constant in each vacuum solution, therefore MADM is trivially vanishing to start with, as follows from the equation of motion7 On the other hand, when performing the Weyl transformation of the metric leading to (2.60), this is no longer true. Indeed, when using (2.60) to describe transitions,\n\u2206MADM def.= uu\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223inst bck 6= 0. We thereby need to add such boundary term by hand to ensure energy conservation throughout the nucleation process as a whole.

The dynamics is thereby carried by the change in the electric field, as follows from (2.64).\n7As we shall see in greater detail in section 5, this is consistent with the fact that such types of transitions take place in absence of gravity.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nOn the other hand, on the case of AP, as discussed earlier on in the section, we can think of k as being the running coupling ensuring the interpolation in between the two vacua parameterised by different values of the dilatonic field. Indeed, in this sense we argued earlier on that transitions in AP are equivalent to RG-flows.\nThe equations of motion for \u03c6 is:\n\u2212 u\u2032\u2032 = 4\u039bBT e2\u03c9+2u.

(2.66)\nFixing \u03c9 \u2261 0 and const.\u2261 0, the profile for the scalar field reads:\n\u03c6(z) = 1 cos (h) ( \u22122 \u221a \u039bBT z ) , (2.67)\nwhich is either a trigonometric or hyperbolic function, according to the sign of \u039bBT . Upon integrating the first term in (2.62) by parts, and using (2.65), we get\nS = 8\u03c0 \u222b z h\nz\u0304 dz u\u2032\u2032 (2u\u2212 1), (2.68)\nwhere z\u0304 and z h denote the location of the turning point and the horizon, respectively. Specifically, for AdS, the latter is simply z h \u2261 0, whereas for dS it is finite. For the instanton to exist, z\u0304 > z h is needed, and (2.68) therefore reads:\nStot = \u221216\u03c0 [\u221a \u039bBT tan (h) ( \u22122 \u221a \u039bBT z ) ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 cos (h)2 (\u22122\u221a\u039bBT z)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+\n+4\u039bBT z + 3 \u221a \u039bBT tan (h) ( \u22122 \u221a \u039bBT z )] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223zh\nz\u0304\n.\n(2.69)\nEquation (2.69) holds for, both, the instanton and background solutions, the only difference being the value of \u039bBT .

(2.71)\nWhich follows from \u03c6newtp,\u2212 \u2261 \u03c6newtp,+, by means of (2.70), whereas the wall\u2019s bounce reads:\nBwall = 8\u03c0 \u222b dz [ \u2212u\u2032 2 + 4\u039bBT eu2 ] def.= 32\u03c0 \u03c3 = 32\u03c0 m z\u0304, (2.72)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the tension of the brane and m def.= \u039b+ \u2212 \u039b\u2212.

(2.73) 2) dS2 \u2192dS2. Similar considerations can be performed for the case of dS. The main difference is that now the horizons contribute with nontrivial terms to the actions. In particular, being z\nh 6= 0, we get\nB dS2\u2192dS2tot = 16\u03c0 \u03c6newtp ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u2212 \u03c6 new 2 tp,\u2212 \u039b\u2212\n1\u2212 \u03c6 new 2 tp,+ \u039b+\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+ 3 ( \u039b\u2212 \u2212 \u039b+ + m 6 ) z\u0304 +\n+\u03c6newh,\u2212\n2\u2212 3 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03c6new 2h,\u2212\n\u039b\u2212\n\u2212 \u03c6newh,+ 2\u2212 3 \u221a 1\u2212\n\u03c6new 2h,+ \u039b\u2212\n . (2.74)\nOnce more, the terms linear in z\u0304 provide an energy conservation relation and are therefore vanishing. The terms featuring in the last line, instead, provide the contributions from the horizons. The results (2.73), (2.74) agree with the expression of the total bounce for type-1 instantons in [12]\nB = 2\u03c0m\u03c1\u0304\u2212 4\u03c0 k ln ri ro + 2\u03c0\u03c1\u0304 k (\u039biri \u2212 \u039boro) .

(2.76)\nImportantly, the last 2 terms in (2.75) arise only for the dS2 \u2192 dS2 case, and are absent for AdS2 \u2192 AdS2, consistently with the results obtained in (2.74) and (2.73), respectively. Compatibility with our results follows from the following identifications\nz\u0304 \u2190\u2192 \u03c1\u0304 , \u03c6new tp def.= 1 k = E2o,I 2 (\u039bo,I \u2212 \u03bb) ,\n\u03c6new 2\u2212 \u039b\u2212 def.= 1 + r\u03042i,o\u039b\u00b1 4 . (2.77)\nKey points and remarks.\n\u2022 Unlike the ordinary Schwinger process, in presence of gravity, the Euclidean action needs to be dressed with a boundary term corresponding to the ADM mass\nS gravBT = SAP + 16\u03c0uu \u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 bdy . (2.78)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n\u2022 In BT, the dynamical process of brane nucleation is encoded in the change in the electric field, while keeping k (i.e. GN ) fixed, as follows from (2.64). On the other hand, on the case of AP, k is related to the running coupling, \u03c6, ensuring the interpolation in between the two vacua parameterised by different values of the dilatonic field.\n\u2022 Up-tunneling falls into the forbidden region of parameter space of the type-1 instanton, since, this configuration fails to satisfy the energy conservation relation associated to the brane nucleation process.\n\u2022 Interestingly, for either sign of the cosmological constant, the flat limit cannot be taken. This follows from the fact that such processes correspond to topology change, and would thereby fall within a different instanton type. The reason for this can be traced back to the extremality of the spacetimes involved, due to the definition of effective cosmological constants,\n\u039bo,I def.= \u03bb+ 12k E 2 o,I . (2.79)\n\u2022 As already highlighted in [12], there are two different ways of calculating the bounce action. Either substituting the singular solutions to the field equations in the Euclidean action, or, alternatively, integrating over the 2 bulk spacetimes separately, in which case the \u03b4-function in the fields would be replaced by the Gibbons-Hawking boundary terms, with the membrane providing the natural boundary for both spacetimes. The 2nd procedure agrees with the first upon extremising the bounce with respect to the membrane size, \u03c1\u0304. According to [12], this is preferable, since it ensures that the extremisation of the bounce on the classical instanton solution is not an artefact of the formalism.8"

            "text": "As proved in an earlier work, [15], vacuum transitions in 4D can be described in three equivalent ways, namely by means of the CDL, BT and FMP formalisms. The importance of their agreement in the well known case of dS4 spacetime, is what led us to explore to what extent the obstruction to other types of transitions may be overcome. In particular, the role plawed by black holes in [15], inspired by the original work of FMP, which had no counterpart in the BT and CDL methods, turned out to be crucial for enabling to define transitions involving Minkowski spacetimes. Given these motivations, we now turn to extending the Hamiltonian method of Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski (FMP) [13] to its 2D counterpart, namely Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT)gravity [58, 59], whose action, up to boundary terms, reads\nSJT = \u03c6o 2\u03ba2 \u222b d2x \u221a \u2212g R+ 12\u03ba2 \u222b d2x \u221a \u2212g \u03c6(R\u2212 2\u039b), (3.1)\n8In section 3 we will argue that the starting point in the Hamiltonian formalism of FMP is precisely the first of the two methods outlined in [12].\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwith \u03c6o being a constant. The coupling of the dilaton \u03c6 to the Ricci scalar ensures gravity is nontrivial. We can think of (3.1) as being the 2D version of the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant describing gravity in arbitrary dimension. \u03c6 plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier and ensures curvature is fixed. From a Field Theory point of view, the expression (3.1) is that of a renormalised theory, with the dilaton accounting for the renormalisation of Newton\u2019s constant. The setup consists of pure gravity with spherical symmetry and a wall (the bubble\u2019s surface) at z = z\u0302, separating two spacetimes with two different cosmological constants \u039b+,\u039b\u2212, similarly to Brown and Teitelboim [12].

Because of this, the Lorentzian approach of FMP is naturally providing a microcanonical description of vacuum decays.

In conformal gauge, the constraint R = 2\u039b can be solved in order to recover an expression for L in terms of the z-coordinate. In the Lagrangian density we started from, \u03c6(R\u22122\u039b\u00b1) plays the role of a perturbation around the background action which, for the 2D case is purely topological. For the given gauge choice, the metric and dilatonic profile can be expressed as\nds2 = 1 z2\n( \u2212dt2 + dz2 ) , with L = 1\nz , \u03c6 = const. (3.15)\nThe e.o.m. arising from LJT , i.e.\n\u03c6 ( \u2212L \u2032\u2032\nL + 2L\n\u20322\nL2\n) = 2\u03c6\u039b\u00b1, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 = 2\u03c6\u039b\u00b1L2, (3.16)\nare solved by\nL = csinh(bz) , \u03c6 = 2a coth(bz), with \u039b\u00b1 def.= b\n2\nc2 . (3.17)\nFor the case of pure AdS2 in Poincar\u00e8 coordinates, (3.15), the metric diverges at the location of the conformal boundary, placed at z = 0. The latter can be mapped to the horizon at \u03c1 = \u03b3 via the following coordinate transformation\nz def.= 1\nb coth\u22121\n( \u03c1\n\u03b3\n) \u21d2 dz = \u03b3\nb\nd\u03c1\n\u03b32 \u2212 \u03c12 , (3.18)\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwhereas the dilatonic profile becomes linearly-dependent on the redefined spatial coordinate\n\u03c6 = 2a\u03c1 \u03b3 . (3.19)\nNotice that, going from \u03c1 to z in (3.18), is analogous to the analytic extension of the metric beyond the horizon. In particular, such transformation takes place by introducing an additional scale, \u00b5. Upon substituting (3.18) in the original line element (3.15), we get\nds2 = \u03c1 2 \u2212 \u03b32\n\u03b32\n( \u2212dt2 + \u03b3 2\nb2 d\u03c12 (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03b32)2\n) . (3.20)\nThe main feature of this result is the explicit emergence of a horizon at \u03c1 = \u03b3 if \u03b32 > 0. For the \u03b32 < 0 case, instead, there is no horizon. Rewriting (3.20) in terms of \u03c6, with \u03b3 = 1/b, we get\nds2 = ( \u03c62 4a2 \u2212 1 )\u2212dt2 + 14a2b2 d\u03c6 2( \u03c62 4a2 \u2212 1 )2  . (3.21)\nThe vanishing of the conjugate momentum with respect to L imply:\n\u03c62 = \u2212 C\u039b\u00b1 def.= \u00b52\u00b1,\n] (3.22)\nwhere the system is understood to be evaluated at the turning point in the N z = 0 gauge. Equation (3.22) enables to identify the parameter in (3.21) 2a = \u221a \u2212C/\u039b\u00b1 = \u00b5\u00b1 as the cosmological horizon in a dS2 metric. Furthermore, from (3.17), we get:\n\u03c6\u2032 = 2ab ( 1\u2212 coth2(bz) ) = 2ab\u2212 b2a\u03c6 2 = b2a ( 4a2 \u2212 \u03c62 ) , (3.23)\nfrom which it can be appreciated that the change in sign of the extrinsic curvature (\u03c6\u2032) takes place when crossing the cosmological horizon at \u03c6 = 2a.\nBulk and boundary actions. In the Hamltonian formalism, the transition rate is defined in terms of the extremised total action including, both, bulk and wall terms\n\u0393(A\u2192 A\u2295W \u2295B) = exp [\u2212Stot + Sbckgr] , (3.24)\nwhere A,B denote the spacetimes involved separated by the brane W , and\nS A/B tot = Stop + Sbulk + Sbrane , Sbckgr def.= \u03c6bckgr16\u03c0G\u03c7M . (3.25)\nThe topological term Stop cancels with the background contribution when evaluating the transition rate. The extremised action is obtained by integrating over the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. By imposing the secondary constraints derived above, the variation of the bulk action therefore reads\n\u03b4Sbulk = \u222b dz [\u03b4L(z)\u03c0L + \u03b4\u03c6(z)\u03c0\u03c6] = 2 \u222b dz \u03b4L(z)\u03c0L (3.26)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n\u21d2 S(+)bulk = 2\u03b7 G\n\u222b dz \u222b dL \u221a( \u03c6\u2032\nL\n)2 + C + \u039b+\u03c62\n= 2\u03b7 G \u222b z\u0302 0 dz L \u221a( \u03c6\u2032 L )2 + C + \u039b+\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 cosh\u22121 ( \u03c6\u2032 L \u221a \u2212C \u2212 \u039b+\u03c62 ) . (3.27)\nSimilarly, for the other vacuum,\nS (\u2212) bulk = 2\u03b7 G \u222b \u221e z\u0302 dz L \u221a( \u03c6\u2032 L )2 + C + \u039b\u2212\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 cosh\u22121 ( \u03c6\u2032 L \u221a \u2212C \u2212 \u039b\u2212\u03c62 ) . (3.28) The bulk action is extremised when the integrand featuring in the first term of (3.27) and (3.28) vanishes, therefore leaving with the corresponding contribution from the value of the dilaton at the turning point and at the horizons characterising spacetimes being involved. For such values, the argument of cosh\u22121 is imaginary, therefore, we can rewrite it as cos\u22121, which provides an overall \u03c0 factor. The extremes of integration for, both, (3.27) and (3.28) are dictated by the relative position of the innermost horizon in a given spacetime with respect to the turning point \u03c6o, whose expression was explicitly derived in the previous subsection, cf. eq. (3.14). From equations (3.23) we therefore get the following contributions\nS (\u2212) bulk = 2\u03c0\u03b7 G \u222b zh,\u2212 ztp dz \u03c6\u2032 = 2\u03c0\u03b7 G \u222b \u03c6o \u2212 \u00b5\u2212 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b7 G [ \u03c6o \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032 L \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 ) \u2212 \u00b5\u2212 ] , (3.29)\nwith \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032\nL \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 ) being the \u0398-function that is non-vanishing only if the extrinsic curvature\non the inner side of the brane is negative, thereby indicating that the turning point is placed beyond the horizon. The same argument follows for the bulk integral over the outer vacuum.For the case involving pure AdS, instead, due to the absence of horizons, only the \u03c6o-terms will be contributing as relevant extremes of integration. Furthermore, precisely because of this, the extrinsic curvature on either side will also preserve the sign over the entire spacetime, thereby leading to the mutual cancellation of the \u0398-terms. Combining the claims just made, the corresponding result for mixed AdS/dS configurations follows. For the 3 cases of interest, the total bulk action therefore reads\nS dS\u2192dSbulk = S (+) bulk + S (\u2212) bulk = 2\u03c0\u03b7 G\n[ \u03c6o \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032\nL \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 ) \u2212 \u00b5\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6o \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032 L \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 + ) + \u00b5+ ]\nS AdS\u2192AdSbulk = S (+) bulk + S (\u2212) bulk = 0\nS dS\u2192AdSbulk = S (+) bulk + S (\u2212) bulk = 2\u03c0\u03b7 G\n[ \u03c6o \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032\nL \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 ) \u2212 \u03c6o \u0398 ( \u2212\u03c6 \u2032 L \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 + ) + \u00b5+ ] .\n(3.30)\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nThe brane action is obtained by considering the variation of (3.26) at the location of the wall z = z\u0302.

Some important observations can be drawn when comparing (3.35).\n\u2022 Horizons\u2019 contribution\nThe first main difference between the AdS and dS transitions is the horizon contribution to the amplitude, which is crucial when considering the flat limit. A detailed explanation and interpretation of these findings will be outlined in section 5.2.1.\n\u2022 Bounds on wall tension\nFor the AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 case, the classical turning point \u03c6o is real if and only if the tension of the brane is constrained within the following range\n\u03ba < 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221a\u2212\u039b+ \u2212\u221a\u2212\u039b\u2212\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (3.37)\n\u2022 The flat limit from AdS\nInterestingly, upon taking, either, \u039b\u00b1 = 0 in AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 processes, the amplitude is still finite\nS Mink.\u2192AdStot = \u03b7\nG \u00b5\u2212 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5\u2212A1+1\u00b5\u2212A1\u22121 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nS AdS\u2192Minktot =\u2212 \u03b7\nG \u00b5+ ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5+A2+1\u00b5+A2\u22121 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nwith A1 def.= \u2212\u039b\u2212+ \u03ba\n2\n4 \u03ba \u221a \u2212C , A2 def.=\n\u039b++ \u03ba 2\n4 \u03ba \u221a \u2212C .\n(3.38) Therefore up and down-tunneling are allowed in this case. Finiteness follow from the fact that the brane action vanishes on the side where the cosmological constant is turned off.\n\u2022 Detailed balance\nUnder the exchange \u00b5+ \u2194 \u00b5\u2212, with C+ = C\u2212, we get A1 \u2194 A2 therefore, from (3.33), we obtain:\n\u03931\u21922 \u03932\u21921 = e 8\u03b7\u03c0 G (\u03c6h+\u2212\u03c6h\u2212) = e\u03b7(S1\u2212S2), (3.39)\nproving that the principle of detailed balance is satisfied, once we identify the value of the dilaton at the horizon with the entropy. It is interesting to notice that detailed balance is still working even in this setup, thereby consistently proving that the value of the dilaton at the horizon is playing the role of the black hole entropy. However, the particular nature of the cosmological horizon leads to unitarity issues upon taking the flat spacetime limit from a pure dS setup.\n\u2022 The flat limit from dS\nThe main difference with respect to the AdS case is that, this time, the definition of the turning point, \u03c6o, is not subject to any parametric constraint, since \u039b\u00b1 > 0.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nHowever, the presence of an additional term proportional to the cosmological horizon in STOT , inevitably leads to a divergent action upon taking the flat limit on eiter side of the brane\nS Mink.\u2192dStot = 2\u03b7\u03c0 G\n[ \u2212\u00b5\u2212 +\n\u00b5\u2212 2\u03c0 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5\u2212A1 + 1\u00b5\u2212A1 \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u00b5+]\u2192\u221e\nS dS\u2192Mink.tot = 2\u03b7\u03c0 G\n[ \u00b5+ \u2212\n\u00b5+ 2\u03c0 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5+A2 + 1\u00b5+A2 \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 \u00b5\u2212]\u2192 \u2212\u221e,\n(3.40)\nfor up and down-tunneling, respectively. In particular, this proves that there is no 2D counterpart of the CDL transition for dS\u2192 Mink. It is an important feature of the 2D theory that the divergence does not cancel, thereby signalling the need for a deeper understanding. Indeed, when taking the lim\n\u00b5+\u2192\u221e , we are really moving very far\naway with respect to the perturbative regime where the near-horizon approximation of JT-gravity is valid. As the horizon moves deeper inside the IR bulk, so too does the turning point. However, \u03c6o will at most asymptote to a finite value, ultimately reemerging from the horizon in the form of a naked singularity. At this point, the causal structure of the spacetime prevents the nucleation of a new bulk phase."

(4.1)\nThe additional B-terms play the same role as the black hole mass in the 4D analysis carried out in [13]. Indeed, such term contributes to the 2D metric function by means of a linear term in \u03c6, therefore featuring the appropriate scaling for a 2D black hole. However, unlike the 4D case, where M emerges as an integration constant, the lower dimensionality of the current analysis requires it to be defined as a parameter of the theory. The procedure for determining the total action is very similar to the one carried out in section 3, hence we will just highlight the main differences. The Hamiltonian constraint picks up additional B\u00b1 terms, whereas the momentum constraint remain unaltered. This follows from the fact that the determinant of the metric is N z-independent. In particular, the latter ensures that the relation in between the conjugate momenta \u03c0L and \u03c0\u03c6 is preserved. Upon integrating the Hamiltonian constraint across the wall, the conjugate momentum with respect to the metric reads\n( \u03c02L ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 z\u0302\u00b1 = 4 (\u03c6\u2032 L )2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 z\u0302\u00b1 + C\u00b1 + B\u00b1\u03c6+ \u039b\u00b1\u03c62  , (4.2)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nand the extrinsic curvatures\n\u03c6\u2032\nL \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 z\u0302\u00b1 = (\u039b+ \u2212 \u039b\u2212)\u03c6 2 \u03c3 \u2213 \u03c34 + C+ \u2212 C\u2212 \u03c3 + (B+ \u2212 B\u2212)\u03c6 \u03c3 , (4.3)\nfrom which the junction conditions follow similarly to the B\u00b1 = 0 case. Upon performing the same procedure outlined in section 3, and still requiring C+ = C\u2212, the effective potential reads\nVeff =\u2212 1 4 ((\u039b+\u2212\u039b\u2212\u2212 \u03c324 \u03c3 ) \u03a62b+ (B+\u2212B\u2212)\u03a6b\u221a |C|\u03c3 )2 \u22121+ B+\u221a |C| \u03a6b+\u039b+\u03a62b \u22121. (4.4) We will restrict to the case B+ = B\u2212 = B. The general case B+ 6= B\u2212 can be considered without changing the conclusions. For B+ = B\u2212, the turning points are\n\u03a61,2 def.= \u2212 B\u03a6 2 o 2 \u221a |C|\n[ 1\u00b1 \u221a 1 + 4C B2\u03a62o ] , (4.5)\nwhich, in the B \u2192 0 limit, consistently reduces to |\u03c61| = |\u03c62| = \u03c6o, thereby correctly recovering the result obtained in section 3. From (4.5), the existence of 2 physical turning points is ensured upon requiring the following parametric constraints\n\u221214 < C B2\u03a62o < 0, with B, C < 0, (4.6)\nwhich can also be rewritten as follows\n\u22122 \u221a |\u039bC| < B < 0. (4.7)\nIn particular, (4.7) defines a bound for B, which, as will be argued in section 4.3, plays an essential role in our analysis. Indeed, as shown next, this parameter is related to the black hole mass.\nMetric and dilaton profiles. Let us generalise the results of section 3.1 to the case B 6= 0. Here, the dilatonic e.o.m. pick up an additional constant term, and, consequently, so too does the field,\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 = 2\u03c6L2\u039b\u00b1 \u00b1 BL2 \u21d2 \u03c6 = 2a coth(bz)\u00b1 B\n2\u039b\u00b1 . (4.8)\nUnder the coordinate transformation (3.18), the line element turns into\nds2 =\n( \u03c6\u00b1 B2\u039b\u00b1 )2 \u2212 4a2\n4a2\n\u2212dt2 + 4a2b2 d\u03c6 2((\n\u03c6\u00b1 B2\u039b\u00b1 )2 \u2212 4a2\n)2  , (4.9)\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nwhich is exactly of the S(A)dS-kind. The parameters featuring in (4.9) can be related to the ones we have and will be using in the expressions for the total actions via the following identification\nB2\n4\u039b2\u00b1 \u2212 4a2 = C\u039b\u00b1\n\u21d2 B = \u00b12\u039b\u00b1 \u221a 4a2 + C\u039b\u00b1 . (4.10)\nNote that, in this case, the metric has 2 horizons, associated to the roots of the metric function in (4.9) that read\n\u03c6\u00b1h,1,2 = \u2212 |B|\n2\u039b\u00b1\n[ sign\u00b1(B)\u00b1 4a \u221a\n\u039b\u00b1 B ] (4.10)= \u2212 |B|2\u039b\u00b1 sign\u00b1(B)\u00b1 \u221a 1\u2212 4C\u039b\u00b1 B2  . (4.11) This shows the importance of introducing B. Which sign is being identified with the innermost or outermost horizon of the given spacetimes entirely depends on the signs of the parameters of the theory (B,\u039b\u00b1). In particular, B will have opposite sign on the 2 sides to ensure the presence of 2 horizons for the \u039b\u00b1 > 0 case. Setting the outer horizon as a reference, the innermost horizon for B < 0,12 is given by the choice of the + root. As a consequence of this, the outermost horizon on the inner vacuum is given by the\u2212 sign, with B > 0. The change in sign for B in the 2 vacua ensures that we can sistematically use the same coordinate \u03c6 on both sides of the brane. Indeed, this is not something surprising, given that the value of the dilaton changes sign in different causal patches of a maximally-extended metric, and therefore it is in agreement with the description outlined above given that the nucleation process requires crossing the horizon of a given spacetime in static coordinates. In the 4D case, FMP showed that the black hole mass arises as an integration variable, while in the 2D case we show that it is part of the theory, since it features at the level of the Lagrangian density. However, one should not be misled by this, in the sense that, unlike the Euclidean formalisms referred to in section 2, the main feature of the Hamiltonian method is precisely that of implementing constraints at the level of the Lagrangian, such that the total action describing the transition is effectively accounting for a joined system of two vacua separated by a wall. The black hole mass will therefore enter in the joined system\u2019s Lagrangian inside the Hamiltonian constraint, and the matching conditions will therefore act as a selection rule assigning to each spacetime a notion of state labelled by their respective value of the black hole mass, B\u00b1."

            "text": "We will start by briefly reviewing the recent work on black holes and the information paradox that will be useful for addressing the vacuum transitions in a similar way. Our first motivation in searching for a holographic embedding of vacuum transitions, is the importance of the role played by horizons, with the Holographic Principle being its prototypical example. Before delving into a detailed analysis of our findings, we first provide some further arguments in support of the similarity between the information loss paradox, and the diveregence of the entropy associated to the cosmological horizon in the static dS patch. To the best of our knowledge, the arguments we propose provide an original motivation towards applying new holographic techniques, as outlined from section 5.2 onwards.\nHolographic black hole evaporation and gravitating baths. In the first formulation of the information paradox, namely within the context of the evaporating (1-sided) black hole, spacetime is asymptotically flat. In its corresponding holographic embedding, this assumption is mapped to having a non-gravitating bath. In the KR/HM-construction realising it, [1, 32, 56] (as depicted on the r.h.s. of figure 6), the bath (denoted in blue) lives on the conformal boundary at z = 0, and, in this sense, is non-gravitating. The KR/HM-construction is able to simultaneously realise three different, albeit physically equivalent, descriptions of the same system, [32], namely:\n1. From the bulk, the system is described by an AdSD+1 with an ETW brane.\n2. From the brane, it is given by a CFTD with a UV-cutoff + gravity on the ETW brane (asymptotically AdSD) which in turn is coupled with transparent boundary conditions to a BCFTD .\n3. From the boundary, it is a BCFTD with nontrivial BCs.\nThe key quantity to keep track of is the ratio between the central charges of the bulk and defect CFTs defining the BCFTD, [79],\nF def.= cbdy cbulk = 6 ln g cbulk , (5.2)\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nfrom which the tension of the brane, T , and brane angle, \u0398, can be determined as follows, [79],\neF = 1 + T\u221a 1\u2212 T 2 = 1 + sin \u0398cos \u0398 , 1\u2212 e \u22122F = 2 sin \u03981 + sin \u0398 , (5.3)\nwith BH evaporation being described by the mutual exchange of degrees of freedom between the bath and the black hole. Constraints on the CFT parameters are holographically dual to the allowed ranges for T and \u0398 by virtue of (5.3). From this follows that tPage is mapped to a critical value of F , beyond which an island is expected to arise. The second orange line in figure 7, which joins R with I, becomes the dominant channel14 for t > tPage. The endpoint of I is the quantum extremal surface (QES) contributing with the area law term to Sgen\nSgen(R) = min extr \u2202I [Area(\u2202I) 4GN + SEE (I \u222aR) ] . (5.4)\nThe main caveat featuring in the non-gravitating bath setup, namely the presence of a massive graviton [71], m2grav \u223c cbulk/cbdy, can be overcome by introducing a gravitating bath, as shown on the r.h.s. of figure 7. The 2 configurations can be smoothly interpolated under the action of an RG-flow driving the conformal boundary at a finite cutoff in the AdS bulk, thereby rendering it gravitating. In terms of the parameter F , (5.2), the RG-flow corresponds to the limit in which cbdy cbulk such that, to sufficiently good approximation, the BCs of the BCFTD encode all the degrees of freedom of the boundary theory. Correspondingly, the only part of the conformal boundary that is left is a codimension-2 theory, CFTD\u22121, located at z = , as shown on the r.h.s. of figure 7, where the issue of the flat entanglement spectrum can be circumvented if calculating the entanglement on a subsystem of the relic codimension-2 boundary theory, [71].\nCosmological horizon. Equipped with this insight, we now turn to the case of the cosmological horizon, the main point of this digression being that of outlining the similarity between the unitarity issues in global dS and black hole evaporation in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The cosmological horizon is placed at a finite distance,15 rh = 1/H, with respect to an observer located at the origin of the static patch, thereby implying that there is only a finite amount of spacetime that she/he can be in causal contact with. Because of this, one might\n14The study of phase transitions in holography initiated from the first work of [80]. 15Each point along the red line in figure 8 is a codimension-2 surface of radius rh.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nA\nB\nz\n\u0393Arectanglepgfid1\n\u0393A\nr=0\nI\u2212\nI+\nr=0\nFigure 8.

An observer at r = 0 can only access degrees of freedom within the cosmological horizon r = 1/H.\nbe led to conclude that the area of the cosmological horizon should somehow be related to the entropy of the static patch itself, as the Holographic Principle would suggest. However, it is also known that the dS Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional, [73]. The reason for this follows from the fact that the dS isometry group is noncompact, and therefore has no finite dimensional unitary representations. This provides one of the main obstacles towards extending the holographic dictionary of [6] to the case of a positive cosmological constant. The configuration just described seems to share similar unitarity issues as encountered for the case of the evaporating black hole. Assuming the horizon surrounding the static patch arises from partial tracing over the global spacetime, cf. figure 8, when taking lim\n\u039b\u21920 ,\nthe cosmological horizon will correspondingly be pushed towards I+, at which the entropy should vanish. Intuitively, this is in agreement with the partial-tracing argument outlined above, since, as the cosmological horizon is pushed further away from the observer in the static patch, the degrees of freedom which were previously \u201chidden\u201d (i.e. traced-over), are expected to re-enter the horizon, thereby becoming accessible to the observer. However, this falls short from being true given the divergence of the entropy defined by the area-law, which, e.g., in 4D scales as \u223c O ( 1 H2 ) . The area of the codimension-2 surface located at such distance can be interpreted by holographic arguments as the entropy of the static patch, which, in the von Neumann formulation, follows from having traced over the spacetime beyond the cosmological horizon, in analogy with the black hole picture. As such, it is not a QES. Given the monotonic behaviour of, both, the background action for dS\u2192dS transitions (as found in [15]) and the von Neumann entropy, we suggest that the divergence issue arising from the flat spacetime limit of de Sitter might be solved by introducing a more suitable definition of the de Sitter entropy, in a similar fashion as Sgen enables to recover unitarity within the context of black hole evaporation. As anticipated at the beginning of this section, this identification turns out to be possible.16\n16Interesting new developments towards realising a dS4/CFT3 correspondence have recently been presented in [83], where the interpretation of the maximal entanglement between the north and south pole in global dS shares the same motivation as the argument presented in our work.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2"

            "heading": "5.2 Holographic embedding of vacuum transitions",
            "text": "Here we present our proposal for the holographic description of the vacuum transitions. As highlighted throughout the previous sections, the three methods used for deriving transition amplitudes exhibit unexpected behaviours. In the present section, we wish to provide a unifying holographic framework describing all processes, mostly motivated by the fact that:\n1. The action for the system of 2D spacetimes joined by a wall is analogous to the JT-gravity coupled to a CFT2 setup adopted to formulate the island proposal within the context of the information paradox.\n2. The bulk-brane-boundary description of the same phenomenon in the KR/HM setup accounts for complementary features of the same underlying process.\nIt is indeed in the spirit of the BCFT formulation of the information paradox, that we propose a holographic embedding of the transitions described analytically in the first three sections of the present work, after having implemented suitable adaptations due to the specifics of the configurations being analysed.\nFigure 9 shows our proposal for the holographic embedding of 2D vacuum transitions:\n\u2022 Given that the process involves two different spacetimes, each one being associated to a different JT-action, the holographic embedding of the transition can be described by two ETW branes (each one corresponding to one of the two vauca, ETW1,2) with the brane separating them (mediating the decay process) being geometrically realised by a composite CFT (denoted by CFTA \u2297 CFTB in figure 9), which can be achieved by performing the folding trick.\n\u2022 The radiation region lies on the conformal boundary (denoted by the tensor product of CFTs arising from the folding trick), which in turn is brought at a finite cutoff, IR , with nontrivial BCs, the latter denoted by BCFTD\u22121 , BCFT \u2032D\u22121 . The theory living on the gravitating bath interpolates between the values of the D-dimensional cosmological constants. As such, the wall plays the role of the entangling surface in between the spacetimes involved, with the entanglement being internal.\n\u2022 Attached to the radiation region are the two ETW branes. Each one of them accommodates one of the two spacetimes, (A)dSD .\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n1\n\u2022 The composite CFT on the gravitating bath (depicted on the l.h.s. of figure 9) is ultimately driven by an irrelevant operator to the configuration on the r.h.s. of figure 9, which is reminiscent of the wedge holographic construction, [23].\n\u2022 As explained at multiple stages throughout our treatment, the total bounce and action for a given vacuum transition, result once having suitably accounted for background subtraction. As we shall see, it is particularly instructive to assign a corresponding holographic realisation of the background configuration as well. Our proposal is represented in figure 10 on the r.h.s. We now turn to explaining it in more detail, albeit most arguments follow through from the ones outlined when explaining the r.h.s. of figure 9. The background action is a pure CFT. As such, it can be equally described independently of the choice of the UV cutoff. Hence, starting from a pure AdSD+1/CFTD setup, with the conformal boundary defined on the whole real line at z = 0, we can perform a suitable conformal transformation enabling to restrict the boundary domain to an interval with BCs dual to two ETW branes characterised by the same D-dimensional cosmological constant. Given that the theory is still conformal, the width of the segment can be arbitrary; for the purpose of interest to us, we need to bring the conformal boundary at the same IR cutoff as the two-spacetime joined system on the r.h.s. of figure 9, such that the background subtraction exactly overlaps with the instanton.\nConcrete proposal for the vacuum transition from the CFT side. If there is a holographic dual formulation of vacuum transitions, a natural question to ask is: what is the corresponding physical effect that happens on the CFT side that describes the vacuum transition in the bulk. Here we proposed that on the CFT side, the vacuum transition corresponds to a field theoretical phase transition such as a confinement/de-confinement phase transition. For this we need to identify the dual of the background spacetime and the dual of the final composite spacetime. For concreteness let us concentrate on a bulk AdS. As we described before the vacuum transition corresponds not to the decay of a full AdS but a portion of an AdS. For the dual we may represent this in terms of a double-well scalar potential that originally has two vacua related by \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 separated by a domain wall.\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nModding out by the \u03c6\u2192 \u2212\u03c6 symmetry this reduces the bulk spacetime to a portion with a boundary. This can provide a description of the dual of the original AdS. The description of the final spacetime can be seen in this way as a similar scalar potential but with the two minima being non-degenerate corresponding to two different spacetimes joined by the boundary. The question is how are the theories in the two boundaries related.\nIn figure 10 the background can be thought of as being given by a degenerate double well potential, with the two vacua identified. In their holographic realisation in terms of ETW branes (as shown on the r.h.s. of figure 10), only one of them will be undergoing the transition, leading to the configuration depicted on the r.h.s. of figure 9.\nThe interpolation between the deconfined and the confined phase of the theory living on the boundary can be realised by adding to the deconfined phase corresponding to figure 10, a deformation, leading to degeneracy breaking between the two vacua, as shown on the r.h.s. of figure 11. Given that our analysis focuses on 2D, T T\u0304 -deformations will turn out being the relevant ones.\nThe reason why we can effectively interpret vacuum transitions in terms of a deconfinement/confinement transition can be understood making use of the analysis carried out in [91] and [92]. In the former, it is shown that the difference between the two phases is dictated by the different dependence of the entanglement entropy on N , which is the key parameter in the holographic dictionary.17 In particular, following the RT prescription, this amounts to a diffference in the behaviour of the expectation value of the Wilson line connecting two arbitrary points on the conformal boundary: for the deconfined phase, SEE \u223c O(N\n2), wheras for the confined phase, SEE \u223c const. What this practically means is that, the former is actually associated to a conformal theory at z = 0, for which the Wilson line diverges unless a UV-cutoff is introduced. Bulk reconstruction, in such setup, allows to recover the entire (infinite) AdSD+1 bulk volume upon removing the cutoff. On the other hand, the confined phase is characterised by a constant value of the entanglement entropy with respect to N , meaning that bulk reconstruction can effectively account for a fixed AdSD+1 bulk volume. In figure 10, this corresponds to having brought the conformal bundary at IR , resulting only in a finite (A)dSD volume being involved in the process. In a similar, and somewhat complementary fashion, the CFT description of the processes dealt with in our treatment find realisation in a recent work [92], where scalar potentials of the kind depicted in figure 11 have been identified with degenerate and non-degenerate vacua in studies of 2d QCD. In [92] the degenerate case can be identified with a deconfinement phase, whereas the non-degenerate case with a confined phase.18 In their treatment, the expectation value of the Wilson loop separating different vacua exhibits, either, an areaor perimeter-law like behaviour according to, whether, the system is in the confined or deconfined phase, repsectively. More efficiently, such classification can be further performed by analysing the ratio of partition functions of the gauged and ungauged theory in the infinite volume19 limit. If such ratio is order unity, it means the system is deconfined. On the other hand, if the ratio vanishes it is confined.\n17Indeed, N is related to the central charge and the AdS radius. 18See also [38] for an interesting discussion of confinement and cosmology. 19Namely the large-N limit.\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n1\n1\nIn drawing a comparison between the processes dealt with in the present work and those of [92], it is important to notice that, in such reference, their analysis embraces, both, vacua and universes. While often used interchangeably, the main difference between vacua and universes is that the latter are separated by infinite barriers, whereas the former might allow finite tension domain walls interpolating between different superselection sectors of the same universe, and are therefore the ones relevant for our treatment. The systems analysed in [92] exhibit multiple vacua, distributed between different universes, and study confinement and deconfinement of Wilson lines interpolating between them. Their counterpart for transitions of the kind associated to the r.h.s. of figure 11, are therefore those involving confined Wilson lines interpolating between vacua belonging to the same universe. Clearly more work needs to be done in order to fully describe the vacuum transitions from the CFT side."

            "text": "As a first concrete application of the tools outlined in the first part of this section, we now turn to the holographic interpretation of the FMP results obtained in sections 3 and 4. In particular, we prove that:\n\u2022 Under suitable parametric redefinition, the results obtained by means of the FMP method are found to agree with the expression provided by [61] for describing mutual approximation of boundary states belonging to different CFTs.\n\u2022 The corresponding expression for the transition rate in presence of gravity, and in absence of black holes, is given by the difference of entropies of T T\u0304 -deformed CFTs, hence proving the locality of the nucleation process. Given its interpretation as being an internal entanglement, such transitions provide an example of an AdS2/CFT1 \u2282 AdS3/CFT2.20\n20The lower-dimensional holographic setup involved in these processes shares similar features as to the one involving spacetimes emerging from matrix QMs, as analysed, e.g. in [86], and their higher dimensional counterparts in [87].\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n\u2022 Upon adding black holes, instead, the total action can be expressed as the difference of generalised entropies, with an island emerging beyond a critical value of the black hole mass. As such, this is an example of an AdS2/CFT1 6\u2282 AdS3/CFT2.\nICFTs and wedge holography. In this subsection, we prove that quantum transitions involving different subregions of spacetime can be described by means of dual CFTs interacting via an interface, [61]. The authors of the latter describe mutual approximation of boundary states, \u03a8A,B , belonging to the Hilbert spaces of different CFTs, (as shown in figure 12). The correspondence adopted in [61], specifying to the case of AdS3/CFT2, relates the following set of parameters on either side of the interface\nL1 , L2 , \u03ba \u2190\u2192 cA , cB , cbdy \u223c ln g, (5.5)\nwith L1,2 being the AdS radii, \u03ba the tension of the wall separating the bulk spacetimes, cA,B the central charges, and ln g denoting the entropy of the ICFT, SICFT , with g defining the degeneracy of the ground state. Our first finding is that AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 transitions are equivalent to the case where the mutual approximation described in [61] only involves the ground states. Indeed, under suitable parametric redefinition, the action for the transition coincides with the one obtained by [61], as explicitly shown below\nS AdS\u2192AdStot = \u03b7\nG\n[ \u00b5\u2212 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5\u2212A1 + 1\u00b5\u2212A1 \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 \u00b5+ ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5+A2 + 1\u00b5+A2 \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ] = 2\u03b7 G [ (\u00b5+ \u2212 \u00b5\u2212) tanh\u22121 (\u2206\u2212 \u03ba ) \u2212 (\u00b5+ + \u00b5\u2212) tanh\u22121 ( \u03ba \u2206+\n)] = 2\u03b7 SICFT = 2\u03b7 ln g(\u03ba) = \u22122\u03b7 F\u2202 , (5.6)\nwhere we defined \u2206\u00b1 def.= 2 (\u221a \u2212\u039b+ \u00b1 \u221a \u2212\u039b\u2212 ) , (5.7)\nand g(\u03ba) denotes the ground state degeneracy and F\u2202 the boundary freee energy, which is a monotonic function of \u03ba.

(5.10)\nAccording to the Casini-Huerta-Myers prescription, the universal part is the one contributing to the definition of the boundary free energy for a BCFT, and therefore this is the only term we need to retain for our purposes. Indeed, S can be removed by simply setting r = , namely choosing the cutoff to be equal to the localisation radius r. From (5.9), we deduce that:\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n1. This chain of equivalence relations, (5.9), suggests an interesting direct correspondence between the mutual approximation of CFT states, [61], and T T\u0304 -deformed CFTs. By virtue of the identification with Sgen, equation (5.6) implies the absence of a QES, and therefore of an island, consistently with the fact that the spacetimes involved in the transitions have no event horizons.\n2. The direct relation between the extremised action and S TT\u0304 in 2D, ensures the locality of the process being described. However, as also suggested from (5.8), upon taking the flat limit on either side, the cutoff radius diverges (r \u2192\u221e), and so too does the turning point, meaning the process is forbidden. We therefore conclude that, as long as the parameters of the theory are kept constant, no issue arises, and the transition remains local.\n3. The cutoff nature of the cosmological horizon suggested by (5.9), proves that its contribution to Sgen should be understood as being part of STT\u0304 . The motivation that led us to connect this issue with the one encountered in the black hole information paradox, precisely resided in the need to correctly define the dS entropy. Indeed, its divergence resembles that of the monotonic von Neumann entropy in the BH evaporation process, and, holographically, this corresponds to the standard divergence of SEE upon removing the UV-cutoff. Just as in the black hole evaporation process the event horizon is not the QES extremising Sgen, so too can be claimed for the cosmological horizon, therefore proving the absence of islands in pure de Sitter spacetimes.\n4. Localisation techniques play a key role in evaluating the partition function for a given CFT. Given its key role in determining SEE , the extremisation procedure rooted in the formalism is compatible with the method defining STOT by means of the FMP method. In this section, we prove that these quantities are indeed proportional to each other.\nThe emergence of the island.

(5.11) coincides with the result by [61] for the case of an excited state of the new CFT approximating the ground state of the background\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\ntheory under the following identifications\nSbrane = (1\u2212 \u00b5)\u2206t2 \u2212\u2206t1\n= \u221212 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a B24\u039b\u2212 \u2212 C \u039b\u2212 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 y21 + y2 1 + y11\u2212 y1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u00b5+ ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 y41 + y4 1 + y31\u2212 y3 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (5.12)\nS (\u2212) hor = (1\u2212 \u00b5)\n\u03b2 2 = \u2212 1 2 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a B24\u039b\u2212 \u2212 C \u039b\u2212 , (5.13)\nwith the latter, (5.13), being the 2nd term featuring in the total action (5.11). The terms proportional to \u03c61,2 are \u223c O(B), and so too are the first and third terms featuring in the first line of the expression for the total action. The results in [61] are in agreement with ours upon expanding the total action with respect to the deformation parameter, B. As also mentioned by the authors of [61], their expression does not contain terms that vanish upon removing the cutoff, thereby explaining the missing terms in performing the comparison. We also made a consistency check with the results obtained in section 4, and found that subleading terms in the l.o. B-expansion vanish in the lim\nB\u21920 .\nThe integration variables in the descriptions outlined in section 4 and [61] are related as follows\ny def.= \u221a 1\u2212 \u00b5 \u03bb r. (5.14)\nIn terms of which, the 3D BTZ geometry, defining an orbifold of the universal cover of the Poincar\u00e8 metric, can be associated with the line element\nds2 = \u2212r 2 \u2212 r2h L2 dt2 + L 2 r2 \u2212 r2h dr2 + r 2 L2 dx2, (5.15)\nand becomes 2D conformally flat at the cutoff r = rc, where the T T\u0304 -deformed CFT of inverse temperature \u03b2 def.= 2\u03c0L2/rh is located. Notice that lim\nrh\u21920 \u03b2 = \u221e, as expected for\nthe T=0 theory. Recall that the variable y, featuring in (5.14), introduced in section 4\n\u2013 43 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nparametrises the value of the dilaton, \u03c6b, on the brane interpolating between the 2D vacua involved in the decay process. As previously argued, in the holographic interpretation of the process, the 1D brane is mapped to a bulk CFT2 on which STT\u0304 is evaluated. In the same fashion, one might be led to believe that the role played by the cutoff rc is analogous to \u03c6b, since all other parameters in the definition of y are held fixed by the formalism. However, we will now be arguing that extra care is needed in building the correspondence between the 2 setups. For B = 0, y = \u03c6b\u00b5 , and, due to the absence of horizons, ytp = 1 is unique. On the other hand, in presence of a black hole, the following identification needs to be made\ntanh x def.= y \u21d2 sinh x = rh rc\n= \u221a\n1\u2212 y2 y \u21d2 rc def.= rh y\u221a 1\u2212 y2 y\u21921\u2212\u2192 \u221e, (5.16)\nfrom which the following information can be extracted:\n1. If B = 0, then ytp = 1 is unique, and rc =\u221e. Correspondingly, (5.15) reduces to a pure AdS3 metric, and the bulk configuration is the same as the one drawn on the l.h.s. of figure 13.\n2. As proved in section 4.3, ytp = 1 is also the limiting value of the turning points upon taking the flat limit on either side of the 2D transition. The last passage in (5.16) thereby shows that the effect of removing the cutoff in [61] is equivalent to taking lim B\u21920 given the identification of the turning point ytp with rc.\n3. These observations imply the need to add a black hole in the 3D bulk in order to keep rc finite, thereby ensuring the ETW brane separating the two phases can actually close up, as shown on the r.h.s. of figure 14.\nIn order to provide further justification for the claims made so far, we will now show that:\n\u2022 Transition in between pure (A)dS spacetimes described by (5.9) can also be obtained in presence of a suitable value of B 6= 0, thereby justifying the identification of the black hole mass with the T T\u0304 -deformation ensuring the locality of the transition taking place.21\n\u2022 For arbitrary values of B, the brane action undergoes a phase transition when the black hole mass decreases below a certain critical value.\n21Our finding is hence in agreement with [90], where the authors show that dS black holes behave as localized, constrained, states, and therefore feature a lower entropy with respect to pure dS.\n\u2013 44 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nHow the number of turning points depends on B. For particular values of B, the turning point reduces to\n\u03c62 =  0 for B= 0 \u2261 pure dS, 1 horizon, y2 = 0 \u00b5\u00b1 for B=\u22122 \u221a |C|\u039b \u2261 extremal dSBH, 2 degenerate horizons, y2 = 1 \u2208 ]0,\u00b5\u00b1[ for \u22122 \u221a |C|\u039b<B< 0 \u2261 non-extremal dSBH, 2 horizons, y2 6= {0,1}.\nThis shows that, in terms of the coordinate y, there is no turning point in absence of a conformal symmetry breaking term in L, thereby forbidding the transition to take place. On the other hand, for BdS = \u22122 \u221a |C|\u039b, the turning point is unique, and therefore coincides with the results obtained in section 3. For any other value ranging in between, i.e. B \u2208 ]\u2212 2 \u221a |C|\u039b, 0[, there are 2 physical turning points in terms of \u03c6b, consistently with the constraint derived in section 4, (4.7). Having said this, we therefore conclude that:\n\u2022 The role of B is effectively equivalent to that of an irrelevant operator on a CFT2.\n\u2022 The results obtained in section 3 should be understood of as arising from the IR limit of the RG-flow of an irrelevant operator, whose imprint in the transition amplitude is given by the finiteness of the turning point at which nucleation takes place.\n\u2022 The cosmological horizons and the cutoff radius at which localisation takes place are proportional to each other, implying the flat limit is equivalent to removing the cutoff altogether; this explains the divergences encountered in section 3.\n\u2022 According to the value of B, the nucleation process features a different number of physical turning points. Only in presence of two distinct physical values of the turning points, the flat limit can be taken (as explained in section 4.3).\n\u2022 In light of further considerations made in the remainder of our work, it is important to notice that, due to the specifics of the formalism, the parameter B is not simply part of the theory, but, rather specifies the state involved in the transition. This follows from the Hamiltonian constraint and the definition of the transition amplitude.\nRelation to Sgen and phase transition of Sbrane. The systems described in section 4 experience a phase transition as the black hole mass decreases, thereby providing further evidence of the fact that, in some cases, 2D vacuum tranistion can only take place in presence of islands. The actions obtained in sections 3 and 4 can be recast to the difference of two generalised entropies, (5.4),\nS (A)dS\u2192(A)dS tot = 2\u03c0\u03b7 [Sgen\u2212Sgen] = 2\u03c0\u03b7 [ \u03c6h,+ G \u2212\u03c6h,\u2212 G +S(A)dS,T T\u0304 EE,\u2212 \u2212S (A)dS,T T\u0304 EE,+ ] .\n(5.17)\n\u2013 45 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nFigure 15. A 3D plot of S EE (B, x). x denotes the portion of the CFT2 on which SEE is evaluated. As B changes, so too does the slope of (5.18), as shown on the l.h.s. The figure on the r.h.s. shows the smooth interpolation in between the monotonic behaviour of S EE as one would expect if evaluated on the disconnected channel over 2 intervals, to a profile admitting a minimum. The phase transition occures at B < 0, corresponding to a upper bound to the black hole mass below which an island needs to be taken into account.\nIn agreement with arguments outlined in [65], the island only emerges beyond a certain threshold value of the black hole mass, which, as previously shown, is accounted for by the parameter B. Each part of the brane action is an entanglement entropy of two disjoined intervals on a CFT2 with deformation parameter B. Expanding to leading order in B, both terms can be brought to the following form\nSEE = S (2)\nEE \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 B=0 + \u03b4S s EE\n(5.18)\n\u223c \u22128c\u22123 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231 sinh (2\u03c0r\u2212 \u03b2\u2212 )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 ( 1\u2212 \u03c6 2 o \u00b52\u2212 ) Bc2\u2212 9\u039b\u2212 coth2 (2\u03c0r\u2212 \u03b2\u2212 ) +\nc\u2212 3 sinh2 (\n2\u03c0r\u2212 \u03b2\u2212 ) . In the second line of (5.18), we redefined the parameters feturing in our original expressions in order to make the comparison with the standard CFT calculation more explicit. Notice that this interpretation is fully legitimate, since the parameter B specifies the states on either vacuum being involved in the transition process. In section 4, we showed that B < 0 and, from section 3, we know that \u03c62o > \u00b52\u2212, therefore y > 0 is the range of interest for the decay process described by (5.17). As shown on the r.h.s. of figure 15, the entanglement entropy, SEE , experiences a phase transition, for y > 0. In particular, the latter takes place at y = 1. It is possible to argue that this is indeed consistent with our finding in section 4 that the black hole mass features in the Lagrangian density as a T T\u0304 -deformation, which needs to be constrained between a certain range, to ensure the existence of two turning points, (4.6).\n\u2013 46 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nIndeed, figure 15 further supports our argument that, the phase tranistion undergone by the brane action corresponds to a Page transition beyond a suitable value of B, with the latter playing a similar role as tPage within the context of the information loss paradox. Consequently, this justifies the emergence of the island in (5.17) upon interpreting the total action as being the difference of generalised entropies."

            "text": "In summary, from the holographic interpretation of the FMP results we proved that:\n\u2022 The flexibility of the FMP method relies upon the fact that such kinds of exactly integrable deformations (T T\u0304 s) can be accounted for at the level of the Lagrangain density, as explicitly outlined in section 4. Because of this, this setup can potentially accommodate an island, as long as the black hole mass lies within a certain range.\n\u2022 In absence of black holes, the total action for the transition is proportional to the defect entropy, SICFT , which is codimension-2 with respect to the auxiliary AdS3 bulk. This can also be re-expressed as a difference of STT\u0304\nEE s, thereby ensuring the locality of\nthe transition as well as the fact that STOT is given in terms of internal entanglement entropies evaluated on a gravitating bath.\n\u2022 In presence of black holes, Sbrane behaves as a quantity experiencing a phase transition beyond a certain value of B, which can be thought of as playing the role of tPage within the island formulation. Furthermore, given the fact that the SEE s defining Sbrane are basically describing an internal entanglement, due to the role of the dilaton in the given setup, our findings are compatible with the claims of [70].\nHaving said this, we are now able to further motivate our proposal, i.e. figure 9, as being an appropriate adaptation of figure 7 for describing vacuum transitions in presence of gravity.\n\u2022 The total action for AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 transitions calculated by means of the FMP method, is a codimension-2 quantity with respect to its AdS3 embedding, and therefore is to be asssociated to the IR-limit of an RG-flow, in agreement with wedge-holography. The same picture can be drawn for transitions involving dS spacetimes, given their realisation via T T\u0304 -deformations in the IR of an AdS.\n\u2022 The portions of spacetime involved in the transition lie on different ETW branes, which, in turn, are holographically dual of the defects BCFTD\u22121s. The interval in between the two defect theories now accommodates a composite CFTD with nontrivial BCs provided by the defect theories themselves.\n\u2022 Under the assumption that cbdy cbulk, the RG-flow will drive the pair of defect CFTD\u22121s in the UV to a single CFTD\u22121 in the IR. An island emerges if the resulting CFTD\u22121 alone is unable to realise the bulk AdS3 by wedge holograhy.\n\u2013 47 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nImplications for up-tunnelling. Given the chain of relations (5.9), which in turn relies upon the parametric identification (5.8), we can now appreciate the fact that the obstructions to up-tunneling outlined in section 3 share a common origin. In particular, we notice that:\n\u2022 The vanishing brane action in the flat limit, is compatible with the fact that STT\u0304 EE \u2192 0\nas \u2261 r\u221a c\u03bb \u2192 0, thereby further justifying (5.9).\n\u2022 The divergence of the bulk action in the flat limit of dS can be recast to the need for redefining the universal part of STT\u0304\nEE for dS including the c6 term, which, for the decay\nprocess analysed in section 3 corresponds to \u00b5, namely the value of the dilaton at the horizon. Given the cutoff nature of the cosmological horizon for pure dS spacetimes (due to (5.9)), it therefore follows that, upon taking the flat limit, the transition is no longer local.\n\u2022 AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 up-tunneling, AdS2 \u2192Mink2 and Mink2 \u2192dS2 can only be achieved as long as we are able to ensure the locality of the decay processes, or, equivalently, the finiteness of the turning point associated to them. For this to happen, the localisation radius, r, and the cosmological constant of a given vacuum need to disentangle. This can be achieved by introducing an additional scale, ultimately ensuring the finiteness of the transition under arbitrary change of the cosmological constant.\n\u2022 This new scale, namely the black hole mass, is responsible for an additional contribution to the total action which cannot be reabsorbed within the definition of STT\u0304\nEE , thereby\nsignalling the emergence of a QES in (5.17), and proving the need for an island to be present for up-tunneling to take place.\n5.2.2 A BCFT2 perspective: transitions between ETW branes\nIn section 4 we proved agreement between the BT and FMP results in absence of black holes. This subsection is meant to provide further supportive evidence of their matching from a holographic point of view, showing that transitions described via the BT formalisms provide an example of an AdS2/CFT1 \u2282 AdS3/CFT2. In doing so, we will be focussing on AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 processes, showing that the total bounce can be mapped to the entanglement entropy on a BCFT2. As already explained in section 2, in the BT setup, the starting point is analogous to that of a type-II Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity theory in 2D, which was proved to arise from dimensional reduction of a BTZ black hole in [88].\nIn performing this comparison, the key quantity of interest is the boundary free energy, F\u2202 , [77], which, for a BCFT2 reads\n\u2212 F\u2202 = SCFT2 + Sbdy = T\u221a\n1\u2212 T 2 \u2212 ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u2212 T1 + T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (5.19)\nwhere T is the tension of the ETW brane and is related to its opening angle with respect to the Cardy brane as \u0398 def.= tan\u22121 T , as depicted on the l.h.s. of figure 17.\n\u2013 48 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nFor type-1 instantons, (5.2.2) is nontrivial for both vacua, i.e. T,\u0398 6= 0, and the total bounce can be re-expressed as follows:\nBtype\u22121 = 2\u03c0 SBCFT2 = 2\u03c0 [ SCFT2 + S\u2212bdy \u2212 S + bdy ] , (5.20)\nwhere\nr\u22121o def.= \u03c1\u0304 , rH def.= \u221a \u039bo,I , T def.= \u221a 1\u2212 r 2 H\nr2o , Sbdy =\u22122ln\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 \u221a 1\u2212\u039b \u03c1\u03042\u221a \u039b \u03c1\u0304 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . Equation (5.20) indicates that either vacuum can be associated to a defect CFT1 living at the endpoints of a bulk CFT2. The overall system therefore defines a BCFT2 as depicted on the r.h.s. of figure 16, with Sbdy being evaluated on the lower-dimensional defect CFTs. In particular, there are two different values of T , one for each vacuum. The mismatch in between the two gives rise to the holographic central charge, which counts the degrees of freedom of the ground state of the codimension-2 theory living on the boundary.\n5.2.3 An internal CFT2 We now turn to the holographic interpretation of the results obtained in section 2.2 by means of the CDL method, further supporting the emergent analytic complementarity between the CDL and BT formalisms in 2D. In doing so, two main features will become manifest:\n1. The entanglement along the dilatonic direction is effectively internal.\n2. The CDL method (in 2D) describes vacuum decays in absence of gravity.\nA CFT2 is uniquely defined by its central charge and the conformal dimensions of the operators living in the theory, (c,\u2206i). Combined together, they define the energy spectrum of the states of a given CFT. From the fundamental parameters of the CFT2, the entropy of an excited state is defined in terms of the Cardy formula,\nSCardy = 2\u03c0 \u221a c\n6 ( \u2206\u2212 c24 ) , (5.21)\nwhere \u2206 and \u2206o = c24 denote the black hole and ground state energies, respectively.\n\u2013 49 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\nFor the case of a CFT2 where the degeneracy of the ground state is 1, the following definitions hold\nSCFT2 = c 3 \u221a \u00b5\u2212 1 , Eo = c 12 \u00b5, c = 6 \u2202S2CFT \u2202Eo , (5.22)\nwith \u00b5 def.= \u2206c being related to the black hole mass in the excited state. Focussing on the AdS2 \u2192 AdS2 process, with associated extremised bounce that can be rewritten as follows\nB AdS2\u2192AdS2tot = 4\u03c0 S2\u00b1= 4\u03c0 c CFT2 hol MBH , (5.23)\nc CFT2 hol def.= \u03c62\u2212+2\u03c62+, MBH def.= \u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ \u22121, S\u00b1\ndef.= \u221a \u03c62\u2212+2\u03c62+ \u221a \u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ \u22121 , (5.24)\nwith MBH being a conserved charge along the flow and c CFT2 hol its conjugate chemical potential. The last passage in (5.23) follows from the relation between the entropy product S+S\u2212 and the central charge. Our result (5.24) goes beyond the original formulation of c by Cardy because it is associated to the defect lying in between the two vacua. A key feature of (5.23) is the fact that it defines an entropy product, and (apparently) not a difference in between entropies, as one might have expected to start with. The main reason for this is that the background configuration in CDL is providing a reference state, the ground state of the CFT2, with respect to which the newly-nucleated spacetime behaves as an excited state, namely an extremal black hole. Comparison with (5.22) enables us to deduce that\n\u03c62\u2212 \u03c62+ def.= \u00b5, (5.25)\nindicating that the newly nucleated vacuum is to be identified with an extremal black hole spacetime embedded in the backround vacuum. Extremality follows from the fact that the mass of the BH is related to the cosmological constant itself. Indeed, from (5.24), MBH is a function of \u039b\u00b1. Relying upon arguments inspired by black hole microstate cosmology, [93], a further remark is in order. We have shown that transitions of the kind AdS2 \u2192Mink2 are forbidden. This is perfectly in agreement with the identification we have just made, namely (5.25), since, from the CFT point of view, we can think of Mink2 as being obtained from lim c\u2192\u221e of a CFT2. The nucleation process would therefore correspond to the ground state of a CFT2 insertion attempting to mimic an excited state of the background CFT2. However, by definition, there is no horizon in the new vacuum that could attempt to screen the infinite number of degrees of freedom associated to a divergent central charge, and therefore the relative entropy (5.22) cannot be defined. In conclusion, due to the extremality nature of the spacetime suggested by (5.25), such transition is forbidden, since it corresponds to an overcounting of the microstates defining the entropy.\nFinal remarks. To finish this section we briefly collect some relevant points and mention the potential relation of our results with other recent developments.\n\u2013 50 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2\n\u2022 In summary, in absence of black holes, the three methods lead to the following results in 2D B wo.kt CDL/AP = 2\u03c0 S2 CFT2 = 2\u03c0 c CFT2hol MBH S B=0 FMP = BBT = B w.kt CDL/AP +M \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 + = 2\u03c0 SBCFT2 = 2\u03c0 [ SCFT2 + S\u2212bdy \u2212 S + bdy ] , (5.26)\nwhere B wo.kt CDL/AP and B w.kt CDL/AP denote the bounces calculated in absence and in presence of the kinetic term for \u03c6, respectively, whereas\nSbdy = ln < 0|B > def.= ln g = ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231 + T1\u2212 T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (5.27)\nin turn highlighting the consistency and mutual complementarity of their holographic interpretations.\n\u2022 The identifications featuring in (5.26), signal the emergence of an entropic hgierarchy, resulting in an interesting correspondence between our findings and those of [62, 63] within the realm of von Neumann algebras (VNAs).22 In particular, the fact that the CDL calculation describes transitions in absence of gravity and the total bounce can be recast in the form of a relative entropy, is compatible with the fact that a type-III VNA only admits a relative entropy definition, rather than a von Neumann entropy. Turning on gravity, namely going beyond large-N , we have the BT and FMP results (in absence of black holes), therefore corresponding to type-II\u221e VNAs. Upon adding a black hole, instead, which at the level of the Lagrangian density corresponds to turning on an irrelevant deformation, the UV theory is different with respect to that of the case with B = 0, leading us to conclude that the projection operator ensuring the reduction from type- II\u221e to type-II1 is mapped to the choice of the deformation in the FMP setup, hence to the choice of the black hole mass.\n\u2022 Vacuum transitions are defined in terms of amplitudes, and we have gathered supportive evidence throughout this work that such processes actually resemble a statement of mutual approximation of CFT states, [61]. We emphasised that the emergence of the island can only be achieved in presence of non-extremal black holes, and that, because of this, upon taking the flat limit, the corresponding action remains finite and experiences a phase transition beyond a critical value of the black hole mass. Rephrasing this in the language [64, 65], the flat limit corresponds to the large-N limit of the dual gravitational theory at hand. Inspired by the arguments of [65], regarding the importance of scale separation for reconciling connected amplitudes from disconnected boundaries (CADBs) with holography, we therefore claim that, below a critical value of the black hole mass, the flat limit leads to a divergent action due to the lack of scale separation between the cosmological constant and the black hole mass.\n22See also [97] for an alternative perspective in the study of the Hilbert space of dS in arbitrary dimensions, mostly motivated by the bootstrap program.

            "text": "The present work was devoted to understanding the subject of vacuum transitions in the simple setting of 2-dimensional gravity. Due to the peculiarities of the latter, the general analysis is not a straightforward extension of the 4D cases. Our main results are the calculation of transition amplitudes obtained following three known approaches, namely the two Euclidean methods of CDL and BT, and the Lorentzian one of FMP. We presented explicit expressions for the transition rates in each method, and for the different signs of the vacuum energies, and took the first steps towards understanding the results. Interestingly, in comparing the Euclidean and Lorentzian prescriptions, we find many similarities, as well as differences.\nSpecifying to the case of (A)dS2 \u2192(A)dS2 transitions, we derived the corresponding expressions for the total bounce or action in the AP setup following the CDL method in thick, (2.46), and thin-wall approximation, (2.58), the BT, (2.73), and FMP method without black holes, (3.35). As emphasised in section 3, the BT and FMP results agree under suitable parametric redefinition, thereby proving expected agreement in between the 2 methods. Such redefinition, though, is highly nontrivial, and can be recast to the different way in which the cosmological constants are being defined in the 2 setups, which in turn is due to the difference in between the Lagrangian densities defining the 2 theories.\nOn the other hand, the result obtained by means of the CDL setup in the thin-wall approximation, (2.58), is equivalent to part of the BT result. In particular, all terms can be identified (under suitable redefinition), apart from the ones arising from the boundary terms associated to the ADM mass. As also argued in section 2, these provide a nontrivial contribution to the total bounce upon turning on gravity. However, as a consequence of the particular nature of the 2D theory, the equation of motion for the AP setup (when removing the kinetic term for the dilaton from the Lagrangian density), imply MADM = 0. Therefore, 2D transitions described by means of the thin-wall approximated CDL method, should really be interpreted as describing nucleation processes in absence of gravity.\nFurthermore, the thick-wall analysis leads to an expression for BTOT with unique features, in the sense that there seems to be no suitable reparametrisation enabling to recast it in any of the expressions obtained by means of other procedures. However, as argued in section 3, under suitable parametric redefinitions, we can still provide a holographic interpretation of our result, which is complementarily in agreement with the others.\nWe may summarise the holographic interpretation of our results as follows:\n\u2022 In section 5 we provide a possible holographic interpretation of the total bounces and actions calculated throughout our work, showing mutual compatibility and complementarity. Figure 17 shows how these processes can be understood as taking place in a KR/HM setup with two ETW branes and one internal gravitating bath, geometrising the brane mediating the nucleation process. In particular, we find that the corresponding expression for the transition rate in presence of gravity, and in absence of black holes, is given by the difference of entropies of T T\u0304 -deformed CFTs, hence illustrating the locality of the nucleation process.\n\u2013 52 \u2013\nJ\nETW1\nETW2 (AdS2)\n(AdS2) AdS3\n\u03c62 +\n\u03c62\u2212 z=\nCFT2\nCFT1 CFT \u2032 1\n\u03982\u03981\nUnderstanding the behaviour of the same physical process by means of different formalisms is equally important in all fields of research, and appears to be particularly promising within the context of quantum gravity. Recent progress towards understanding the behaviour of the partition function for QG within, either, the canonical or microcanonical ensemble, [68, 69], as well as the study of the phases of gauge theories and their holographic duals, [96], are certainly among the most promising directions deserving more investigation. Clearly our work leaves many open questions. We hope that our results will be useful for addressing further questions related to vacuum transitions, early universe cosmology, and holography.\n\u2013 53 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 2"
