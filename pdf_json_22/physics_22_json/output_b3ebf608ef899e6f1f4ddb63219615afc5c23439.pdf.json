    "abstractText": "We study neutral massless scalar field perturbations around an extreme dilaton black hole in 2 + 1 dimensions: the wave equations of the massless scalar field is shown to be exactly solvable in terms of Whittaker functions. Thus, the quasinormal modes are computed exactly and shown to be purely imaginary: we show the existence of stable and unstable modes. Interestingly, the quasinormal modes do not depend on the black holes parameters and the fundamental mode is always unstable and depends only on the parameters of the test field. Also, we determine the quasinormal frequencies via the improved asymptotic iteration method which shows a good agreement with the analytical results.",

            "text": "Extreme black holes have special geometry since their inner horizon and outer horizon coincide. Also, surface gravity of such black holes is zero, leading to zero temperature. Furthermore, semi classically it has been shown that some extreme black holes have zero entropy (even though the area is non-zero) [1]. Extreme black holes are important objects due to many reasons. They are considered important in supergravity theories, string theory and M theory. For example, extreme Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole can be embedded in N = 2 supergravity theory [2]. Some supersymmetric black holes (such as the extreme Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole) do have extra symmetry that non-extreme black holes don\u2019t have: they admit Killing spinor fields leading to the extreme black hole to be invariant under supersymmetric transformations. Extreme black holes take a special place in counting micro states related to entropy in black holes: large class of extremal supersymmetric black holes in string theory have been studied in the counting of mircrostates [3,4].\nThe Quasinormal Modes (QNMs) and Quasinormal Frequencies (QNFs) in black hole backgrounds has been studied for many years starting from the pioneering work by Regge and Wheeler [5\u201310]. Furthermore, recent detection of gravitational waves [11,12] have stimulated further the study of such vibrations since QNM emerge as the final stage of large coalescing objects.\nWhile there are many works on QNM\u2019s of non-extreme black holes, there are only few works on extreme black holes on the topic. The extreme rotating BTZ black hole was studied in [13] and was shown the absence of QNM frequencies for scalar and spinor fields. In 4 dimensions, neutral scalar field perturbations around the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole was studied in [14]. Charged massless perturbations around an extremal Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole and\nto neutral massless perturbations around an extremal Kerr black hole was studied in Ref. [15], and it was shown that the QNMs spectrum presents a decay rate. Also, there are studies about QNMs at the near extremal limit, where in general it was shown that in this limit the near extremal modes are dominant, and for uncharged scalar fields these modes become purely imaginary, see [16\u201328].\nThe three-dimensional models of gravity have been of great interest due to their simplicity over the fourdimensional and higher-dimensional models, and since some of their properties are shared by their higher-dimensional analogs. The black hole considered in this paper is a solution to the Einstein\u2013Maxwell-dilaton gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions. The corresponding action is given as follows,\nS = \u222b d3x \u221a\u2212g [ R \u2212 4( \u03c6)2 \u2212 e\u22124\u03c6F\u03bc\u03bdF\u03bc\u03bd + 2e4\u03c6 ] . (1)\nHere, R is the scalar curvature, is treated as the cosmological constant, \u03c6 is the dilaton field and F\u03bc\u03bd is the Maxwell\u2019s field strength. The action in Eq. (1) is conformally related to the low-energy string action in 2 + 1 dimensions. The dilaton field plays the role of the extra fields, which naturally arises, for instance, in the compactifications from higher-dimensional models or from string theory. These theories also have black hole solutions which play an important role in revealing various aspects about the geometry of spacetime and the quantization of gravity, and also the physics related to string theory [29\u2013 31].\nIn this paper, we will study the extreme dilaton black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions for the above theory. In particular we will study the propagation of neutral massless scalar fields around the black hole. Some works related to QNM\u2019s for dilaton black holes are given in [32\u201349]. For the spacetime under study the QNM spectrum is characterized by purely imaginary modes and we will show that the fundamental mode depends only on the properties of the test field. Also, we discuss about the stability of the propagation of neutral massless scalar fields in this extremal background. In addition, we apply the improved Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) to evaluate the QNFs numerically and we discuss about their accuracy.\nThis work is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we give a brief review of three-dimensional extreme dilaton black hole. Then, in Sect. 3 we study neutral massless scalar perturbations and we present an exact solution to the wave equation in Sect. 4, and to the QNMs in Sect. 5. Then, in Sect. 6 we study the spectrum numerically by using the improved AIM method. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 7."

The equation is similar to what was presented for the non-extreme black hole in [54].\nThe equation for a massless neutral scalar field in curved space-time can be written as,\n\u03bc \u03bc = 0. (10)\nUsing the following ansatz,\n= eim\u03b8e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03be(r)\u221a r\n(11)\nEq. (10) simplifies into the equation ( d2\ndr2\u2217 + \u03c92 \u2212 V (r)\n) \u03be(r\u2217) = 0. (12)\nHere, V (r) is given by,\nV (r) = f (r) 2r3/2 d dr\n( f (r)\n4r3/2\n) + m 2 f (r)\nr2 . (13)\nWhen expanded, V (r) is given as,\nV (r) = 8m2 + 4 2 \u2212 2m 2M\nr + (\u22123M2 8 + m 2M2 8 ) 1 r2\n+ M 3 16 r3 \u2212 3M 4 1024 2r4 .

Now, a discussion about the behavior of the potential is in order. Notice that the potential behaves like a step function with it approaching a constant value. In fact the constant value is V0 = 8m2 + 4 2. When a potential behaves as a step function, the quasinormal modes are pure imaginary. This was discussed in length in [51]. Another example where pure imaginary quasinormal modes arise with such a step function is the five dimensional dilaton black hole [52]. Hence just by observing the from of the potential, one can predict that the quasinormal modes for the extreme black hole will be pure imaginary. In the next section, we will solve the equations exactly and prove that is indeed the case."

(18)\nIn the new coordinate system, x = 0 corresponds to r \u2192 \u221e and x = \u221e corresponds r = rh . With the new coordinate, Eq. (17) becomes,\nd2R dx2 +\n( A\nx2 + B x + C\n) R = 0 (19)\nwhere,\nA = \u03c9 2 16 2 \u2212 m 2 2 , B = \u03c9 2\n8 2 ,\nC = \u03c9 2\n16 2 . (20)\nThe Eq. (19) resembles the Whittaker differential equation given by [53],\nd2R dz2 + ( 1 4 \u2212 \u03bc2 z2 + \u03ba z \u2212 1 4 ) R = 0. (21)\nWe will redefine the parameters \u03ba and \u03bc with \u03b1 and \u03b2 as,\n\u03ba = \u03b1; \u03bc = \u03b2 \u2212 1 2 . (22)\nWe will replace all equations with \u03b1 and \u03b2 right after Eq. (27). The reason to introduce the new parameters is to follow the same notation followed with the computation done for the\nnon-extreme black hole by the same author in [54]. The solutions to the Whittaker equation in Eq. (18) are given by, M\u03ba,\u03bc(z) = e\u2212 z2 z 12 +\u03bcM [ 1\n2 + \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba, 1 + 2\u03bc, z\n] ,\nand M\u03ba,\u2212\u03bc(z) = e\u2212 z2 z 12 \u2212\u03bcM [ 1\n2 \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03ba, 1 \u2212 2\u03bc, z\n] . (23)\nThe function M[a, b, z] is called the Kummer Function and is the solution to the Kummer differential equation given by [53],\nz d2F dz2 + (b \u2212 z)dF dz \u2212 aF = 0. (24)\nNow, to transform the Eq. (19) to the Whittaker form, we will reparametrize the coordinate x as\ny = i2\u221aCx = i\u03c9 2 x . (25)\nThen the Eq. (19) takes the form,\nd2R dy2 + ( 1 4 \u2212 \u03bc2 y2 + \u03ba y \u2212 1 4 ) R = 0, (26)\nwith\n\u03ba = i\u03c9 4 ; \u03bc = i 2\n\u221a \u03c92 \u2212 8m2\n4 2 \u2212 1. (27)\nNote that we will take \u201c+\u201d sign without loss of generality. Finally, by substituting the values of \u03ba and \u03bc in terms of \u03b1 and \u03b2, the general solution to the wave equation can be written as\nR(y) = C1e\u2212 y2 y\u03b2F[\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1, 2\u03b2, y] +C2e\u2212 y2 y1\u2212\u03b2F[1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1, 2(1 \u2212 \u03b2), y]. (28)\nHence the general solution to the waves equation is,\n(y, t, \u03b8) = eim\u03b8e\u2212i\u03c9t R(y). (29)"

            "text": "Since the main objective of the paper is to find QNMs of the extreme black hole, one needs to impose specific boundary conditions to the general solution obtained in Sect. 4. The solutions are analyzed closer to the horizon and at infinity to obtain exact results for QNMs.\nTo compute QNMs of a black hole, two boundary conditions are imposed. One is to impose the wave to be purely\ningoing at he horizon. The other is the boundary condition for large r values. For asymptotically flat space-times, the asymptotic boundary condition is for the field to be purely out going. For non-asymptotically-flat space-times, there are two possibilities: on is for the field to vanish and the other is for the flux to vanish. We choose the field to vanish similar to what was done in [54].\n5.1 Solution at asymptotic region\nFirst we will study what the solution is when r \u2192 \u221e. Since for large r , y \u2192 0, the Kummer function M[a, b, y] \u2192 1. By substituting y \u2192 0 to the exact solution obtained for R(y), one obtain,\nR(r \u2192 \u221e, r \u2192 0) \u2248 C1y\u03b2 + C2y1\u2212\u03b2. (30)\nSince,\ny = i\u03c9rh 2 (r \u2212 rh) (31)\nfor large r ,\ny \u2192 i\u03c9\u0302 2 (rh r ) (32)\nthe Eq. (30) can be written in terms of r as,\nR(r \u2192 \u221e) \u2248 C1 ( i\u03c9\u0302\n2 )\u03b2 (rh r )\u03b2 + C2 ( i\u03c9\u0302 2 )1\u2212\u03b2 (rh r )1\u2212\u03b2 .\n(33)\nNow one need to determine which part of the solution in Eq. (33) corresponds to the \u201cingoing\u201d and \u201coutgoing\u201d respectively. For that we will first find the tortoise coordinate r\u2217 in terms of r at large r . Note that for large r , f (r) \u2192 8 r2. Hence the equation relating the tortoise coordinate r\u2217 and r in Eq. (15) simplifies to,\ndr\u2217 = dr 4 r . (34)\nThe above can be integrated to obtain,\nr\u2217 \u2248 1 4 ln\n( r\nrh\n) . (35)\nHence,\nr \u2248 rhe4 r\u2217 . (36)\nSubstituting r from Eq. (36) and \u03b2 from Eq. (22) into the Eq. (33), R(r \u2192 \u221e) is rewritten as,\nR(r \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 C1 ( i\u03c9\u0302\n2\n)\u03b2 e \u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 \u221a 1\u2212 4 2 \u03c92 ( 2m 2 +1)\u22122 r\u2217\n+C2 ( i\u03c9\u0302\n2\n)1\u2212\u03b2 e i\u03c9r\u2217 \u221a 1\u2212 4 2 \u03c92 ( 2m 2 +1)\u22122 r\u2217 . (37)\nFrom the above one can conclude that the first term and the second term represents the ingoing and outgoing waves respectively. Since for QNMs, the ingoing amplitude has to be zero, we chose C1 = 0. Hence the solution to the wave equation becomes,\nR(y) = C2e\u2212 y2 y1\u2212\u03b2M[1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1, 2(1 \u2212 \u03b2), y]. (38)\n5.2 Solutions near the horizon\nNow we can analyze the solution of the wave equation near the horizon (r \u2192 rh , y \u2192 \u221e). The Kummer function M[a, c, y] has an expansion for large y as follows [53],\nF[a, c, y] \u2192 ey ya\u2212c (c) (a) + e\u00b1i\u03c0a y\u2212a (c) (c \u2212 a) . (39)\nNote that the upper sign is taken if \u2212\u03c02 < arg(y) < 3\u03c02 and lower sign is chosen \u2212 3\u03c02 < arg(y) < \u2212\u03c02 . Since arg(y) = \u03c0 2 the upper sign will be chosen. By substituting the above expansion with the appropriate values for a and c in terms of \u03b1 and \u03b2, one obtain the function R(y) near the horizon as,\nR(r \u2192 rh, y \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 C2 ( ey/2y\u2212\u03b1 (2 \u2212 2\u03b2)\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) +e\u2212y/2+i\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b1)y\u03b1 (2 \u2212 2\u03b2) (1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b1) ) . (40)\nTo determine which part of the above equation represents the ingoing/outgoing, one has to introduce the tortoise coordinate near the horizon. From Eq. (15), the tortoise coordinate near the horizon can be approximated with,\nr\u2217 \u2248 1 4 ln(r \u2212 rh) \u2192 e\u22124 r\u2217 \u2248 1 (r \u2212 rh) . (41)\nBy substituting y in terms of r\u2217 in Eq. (41), the radial function R(r\u2217) approximates to,\nR(r \u2192 rh, y \u2192 \u221e) \u2248 C2e y 2 (2 \u2212 2\u03b2) (1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) ( i\u03c9\u0302rh 2 )\u2212\u03b1 ei\u03c9r\u2217\n+C2e\u2212 y 2 +i\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b1) (2 \u2212 2\u03b2) (1 \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b1) ( i\u03c9\u0302rh 2 )\u03b1 e\u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 . (42)\nThe first represents the outgoing waves and the second represents the ingoing wave at the horizon.\n5.3 Quasinormal modes\nSince the QNMs are defined with as purely ingoing waves at the horizon, the outgoing terms has to be zero. SinceC2 = 0, the first term vanish only at the poles of the Gamma function, (1 \u2212\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1). Note that the Gamma function (x) has poles at x = \u2212n for n = 0, 1, 2 . . . . Hence to obtain QNMs, the following relations has to hold.\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 = \u2212n (43)\nleading to,\n\u03b2 = (1 + n) \u2212 i\u03c9 4 . (44)\nBy combining Eq. (43) and Eq. (44), one can solve for \u03c9 as,\n\u03c9 = \u22122i 2n + 1\n( 2 n(1 + n) \u2212 m2 ) . (45)\nThey are pure imaginary, do not depend on the black hole parameters, and the decay rate increases when the cosmological constant increases. Note that the fundamental mode n = 0 is unstable, and the decay rate depends only on the angular number of the test field. Due to the minus sign in front, these oscillations will be damped leading to stable perturbations for 2 n(1 + n) > m2. However, for 2 n(1 + n) < m2, the oscillations would lead to unstable modes.\nIn acoustic black holes, QNM\u2019s for scalar field shows similar properties [55]. There,\n\u03c9 = \u2212 i 2 (n \u2212 1)(n + 3)a\u0303 n + 1 . (46)\nFor n = 0, \u03c9 is positive and will lead to exponentially growing mode similar to the extreme dilaton black hole discussed above."

In this section, we apply the improved AIM [56] method to compare with the analytical results. This is an improved version of the method proposed in Refs. [57,58] and it has been applied successfully in the context of QNMs for different black holes geometries; see for instance [59\u201368].\nThe boundary conditions satisfied by the QNMs are given by\n\u03be \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9r\u2217 as r\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e \u03be \u223c ei\u03c9\u0303r\u2217 as r\u2217 \u2192 \u221e\nwhere \u03c9\u03032 = \u03c92 \u2212 4 2 \u2212 8 m2. There are only ingoing waves at the horizon and outgoing waves at infinity. This can be transformed to\nR \u223c r\u2212 12 (r \u2212 rh)\u2212 i\u03c94 e i\u03c9 4 rh r\u2212rh as r \u2192 rh\nR \u223c r\u2212 12 + i \u03c9\u03034 as r \u2192 \u221e. In order to write a solution with this behavior at the boundaries, we define\nR(r) = r\u2212 12 + i(\u03c9\u0303+\u03c9)4 (r \u2212 rh)\u2212 i\u03c94 e i\u03c9rh 4 (r\u2212rh ) \u03c7(r). (47)\nInserting this expression in Eq. (17) and performing the change of variable z = 1 \u2212 rh/r we arrive at the following equation\n\u03c7 \u2032\u2032(z) = \u03bb0(z)\u03c7 \u2032(z) + s0(z)\u03c7, (48)\nwhere the prime denotes derivative with respect to z and\n\u03bb0(z) = \u2212 1 2(1 \u2212 z)z2\n( \u2212i\u03c9 + 4 z + z2 (i\u03c9 \u2212 6\n+ \u221a \u2212\u03c92 + 4 2 + 8 m2 ))\ns0(z) = \u2212 1 8(1 \u2212 z)z2 2\n( \u03c92 \u2212 i\u03c9 \u221a \u2212\u03c92 + 4 2 + 8 m2\n\u22124 m2 + z(\u03c92 + 4i\u03c9 \u22124 m2 \u2212 8 2 + 4 \u221a \u2212\u03c92 + 4 2 + 8 m2\n\u2212i\u03c9 \u221a \u2212\u03c92 + 4 2 + 8 m2) ) . (49)\nWe solve numerically Eq. (48) using the improved AIM. This method is implemented as follows, first it is necessary to differentiate Eq. (48) n times with respect to z, what yields\n\u03c7n+2 = \u03bbn(z)\u03c7 \u2032 + sn(z)\u03c7, (50)\nwhere\n\u03bbn(z) = \u03bb\u2032n\u22121(z) + sn\u22121(z) + \u03bb0(z)\u03bbn\u22121(z) sn(z) = s\u2032n\u22121(z) + s0(z)\u03bbn\u22121(z). (51) Then, the functions \u03bbn and sn are Taylor expanded around some point z0 (0 < z0 < 1) at which the improved AIM is performed \u03bbn(z0) = \u221e\u2211 i=0 cin(z \u2212 z0)i sn(z0) = \u221e\u2211 i=0 din(z \u2212 z0)i ,\ncin and d i n are the i th Taylor coefficients of \u03bbn(z0) and sn(z0) respectively. Then, replacing these Taylor expansions in Eq. (51) the following set of recursion relations for the coefficients are obtained cin = (i + 1)ci+1n\u22121 + din\u22121 + i\u2211\nk=0 ck0c\ni\u2212k n\u22121\ndin = (i + 1)di+1n\u22121 + i\u2211\nk=0 dk0c\ni\u2212k n\u22121.\nNext, imposing a termination to the number of iterations one arrives to the following quantization condition\nd0n c 0 n\u22121 \u2212 d0n\u22121c0n = 0. (52)\nWe use a root-finding algorithm to determine numerically the QNFs from (52). In Table 1 we show some values of QNFs, in order to check the correctness and accuracy of the numerical technique used. The numerical values where round to five decimal places and they show a good and exact agreement with the exact result via Eq. (45). As it was mentioned, these oscillations will be damped leading to stable perturbations for 2 n(1 + n) > m2. However, for 2 n(1 + n) < m2, the oscillations would lead to unstable modes."

            "text": "In this work we considered the propagation of massless scalar fields in the background of three-dimensional extremal dilaton black holes. We obtained QNM frequencies analytically, and we showed that the QNMs are overdamped or purely imaginary leading to stable perturbations for 2 n(1 + n) > m2. For 2 n(1 + n) < m2 the oscillations would lead to unstable modes. The decay rate increases when the cosmological constant increases. For the fundamental mode n = 0, the decay rate depends only on the angular number of the test field: however in this case the modes are unstable. Also, we used the improved AIM in order to determine the QNFs numerically, and we showed that there is a good agreement between the numerical and the analytical solutions.\nThere are number of works that are interesting to do in the future related to this work presented here: Onozawa et al. [69]\nshowed that QNM\u2019s for the extreme Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black holes for the spin 1, 3/2, 2 are the same. It would be interesting to see if that is the case for the extreme dilaton black hole. In 2 + 1 dimensions it has been shown that the perturbation equations for spin 0 and spin 1 are the same [70]. The reason (as given in [70]) is that the scalar field and F\u03bc\u03bd are dual. Furthermore, in 2 + 1 dimensions there are no propagating degrees of freedom for spin 2 (gravity) field. Therefore, we can omit bosonic degrees of freedom. However, it is vital that we add spin 1/2 field into the mix to see if there are relations; hence it would be interesting to compute QNM\u2019s for spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 for the extreme dilaton black hole.\nIt would also be interesting to analyze the superradiant instability [71] of this extremal black hole for charged massive scalar field, as well as, the quasinormal modes: we leave those for a future work, see [72].\nDataAvailability Statement This manuscript has no associated data or the data will not be deposited.
