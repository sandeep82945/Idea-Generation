    "abstractText": "A novel, inexpensive and simple experimental setup for collecting \u03bc-Raman spectra of volatile liquids in very small quantities was developed. It takes advantage of capillary forces to detain minute volatile liquid volumes. Spectra of volatile and even scattering or absorbing media can be measured more effectively. The method is used to facilitate the collection of intensity-consistent Raman spectra from a series of reference compounds present in Origanum essential oils, in order to quantify their constituents by multiple linear regression. Wild grown Origanum plants, collected from five different regions in Greece and taxonomically identified as O. onites, O. vulgare subsp. hirtum and O. vulgare subsp. vulgare, were appropriately distilled to acquire their essential oils. Comparison of the Raman results with those from headspace gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (HS GC-MS) confirmed the successful relative quantification of the most abundant essential oil constituents, highlighting the similarities and differences of the three Origanum taxa examined. Finally, it is demonstrated that directly measuring the leaf peltate glandular hairs yields exploitable results to identify the main components of the essential oil they contain, underlining the potential of in situ (field or industry) measurements utilizing microscope-equipped portable Raman spectrometers.",

            "text": "Essential oils (EOs) are extracted from aromatic plants and consist of volatile compounds of various chemical scaffolds and particularly of terpenes and phenolic compounds. Depending on their composition and due to their chemical properties, EOs possess numerous biological properties, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer activity [1]. These properties, combined with the biodegradability and the low environmental impact of EOs, have rendered them key substances in numerous applications in the last decades. They are used in the pharmaceutical industry, in medical applications, in cosmetics and aromatherapy and as natural alternatives to biocides for domestic use or cultural heritage preservation treatments [2,3]. The extensive applications that EOs have and the high price of some of them have, unfortunately, also resulted in adulterations to increase the commercial profit. Therefore, there is a constant need for straightforward and reliable methods for the determination of EOs. Chemical analysis of EOs for their characterization and authentication has been routinely carried out by chromatography techniques [4,5]. In GC-MS, the retention time and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28031221 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 2 of 15\nthe mass spectra differentiate the volatile constituents, permitting the compositional analysis of the EO. The technique is of high sensitivity and can detect even tiny amounts of a compound. However, the relatively long time for sample preparation, the costly equipment and the identification of only volatile compounds constitute the main disadvantages and the reason that botanists and the industry sector explore the effectiveness of other analytical techniques for the chemical characterization of EOs, the detection of adulterants and the in situ characterization of the raw materials. Raman spectroscopy can provide chemical and structural information about substances through their interaction with monochromatic irradiation and the spectral analysis of the inelastically scattered light. The energy gain or loss of the inelastically scattered photons is characteristic of the elementary excitations in matter, vibrational in most of the cases, interrelated with its chemical composition and structure [6], rendering Raman spectroscopy a valuable tool for the characterization and study of matter. Further to its use in the fields of physics, chemistry and material science, the technique is routinely applied in the compositional study of materials in various other scientific fields, such as geology and atmospheric sciences, environmental sciences, forensics and cultural heritage science [7]. It is a nondestructive technique, requires minimal or no sample preparation and it does not require the use of any chemical reagents, thus lowering the cost, the environmental impact and time of the analysis procedure. These advantages also make it attractive as an analytical technique for the characterization of essentials oils extracted from aromatic plants, and such studies have been reported for the identification of their main constituents and the detection of adulterations [8\u201312]. Raman spectra of EOs were found to permit their discrimination rather easily compared to the respective ones of vegetable oils [8], whereas chemometrics analysis can be fruitfully employed when the spectra related to different plant varieties are very similar, as, for example, in the case of lavender and lavandin [13]. However, it is often the case that only small volumes of the samples and pure reference compounds are available. This, combined with the volatile nature of EOs, renders the analysis more demanding and raises questions about the accuracy and reproducibility of the Raman measurements regarding quantification. Methods for tackling the issue of volatility in Raman analysis of liquids have been reported in the literature. The use of acetonitrile as an internal analytical standard for the correction of the volatile analyte loss during measurements contributed to a short analysis time with high sensitivity for the quantification of ethanol and methanol in alcoholic beverages [14]. The experimentation with different kinds of sample carriers encountered in the literature also outlines the research efforts to minimize the evaporation rate of the volatile analytes. In a study of ethanol determination in urine samples [15], a highly reflective gold layer carrier, a cuvette with a lid and a gold coated slide with a cavity and covered with cling film were tested, in order to find the appropriate carrier regarding the minimum required sample volume and the prevention of evaporation. Similarly, different fluid sample carriers were screened for Raman measurements of human serum, initially tested with ethanol, including glass slides with a hole to trap the liquid under a coverslip, coverslip-covered O-rings on glass or quartz slides and the eventually proposed, mirror-finished stainless-steel plate with holes [16]. In the existing literature related to the analysis of EOs with Raman spectroscopy, the usage of various types of sample carriers has been reported, such as aluminum substrates [17], metal rings [10,18], quartz cells [13] and NMR glass tubes [19]. Raman spectroscopy belongs to the techniques that can be used for in situ measurements by the use of handheld modern devices of relatively high resolution, nowadays available in the market. The feature of portability has made Raman spectroscopy appealing for industries, e.g., cosmetics and pharmaceutical, mineralogy, art and archaeology, as well as for testing materials in the field [20\u201322]. Portable Raman instrumentation is also employed in the chemotaxonomy of plants, where fast and accurate information can be collected from different parts of the plant in its natural environment [23,24]. The inherent disadvantage of a relatively low signal in Raman spectroscopy, related to the low Raman scattering cross-section of substances, turns into an advantage when it comes to water,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 3 of 15\nrendering this spectroscopic technique suitable for the analysis of plant material such as leaves, where moisture is present [25]. In the present study, the constituents of the EOs from three Origanum taxa were determined by Raman spectroscopy. Origanum was selected as a case study since, besides its biological properties and its extended applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, it represents one of the most abundant native plants in Greece and the Mediterranean region in general. For the analysis of distillates, a novel experimental approach was introduced that is based on the use of capillary tubes and takes advantage of the capillary force to detain very small liquid volumes. The setup proved to be successful in the analysis of volatile liquids in very small quantities, by both keeping the analyte\u2019s volume minimum and avoiding volatility issues. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was applied for the quantification of the constituents from their Raman spectra, using the measured spectra of pure compounds as reference. This approach is an alternative to the construction of a calibration curve that is frequently used in the literature [19,26,27], which requires the preparation of standard solutions of known concentrations for each compound to be determined, and thus, requires a larger amount of reference compounds. It is also an alternative to the use of partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis, where the reference set is usually provided by available sample spectra that have been already quantified by another, usually chromatographic, technique [13,18]. On the other hand, the use of MLR requires that all the spectra of the pure substances are reliably acquired strictly under the same experimental conditions, which is fulfilled by the proposed experimental setup, whereas the used minute quantities of the reference substances can be maintained, if required. The analysis of the distillates presented in this study was previously conducted with headspace gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (HS GC-MS) and the results of the two analytical techniques were compared in order to evaluate the adequacy and reliability of Raman spectroscopy for the detection of characteristic substances in EOs and the chemotaxonomy of Origanum members. Moreover, \u00b5-Raman spectra were successfully collected directly from the leaves, and more specifically from the leaf peltate glandular hair. They exhibit very similar spectral features with the respective spectra of the isolated EOs, emphasizing the prospect of portable microscope-equipped Raman instruments for in situ characterization of the raw materials."

            "text": "In much older instrumentation, a simple achromat lens of large diameter was usually employed for the collection and coupling of the scattered light to slit monochromators or spectrometers. For transparent liquids, a 90\u25e6 excitation\u2013collection scheme was common, where the light \u201cfilament\u201d, the focused laser beam path inside the cuvette, was imaged on the horizontal slit of the spectrometer, permitting efficient coupling of the collected light. The advent of microscope-equipped Raman spectrometers, with significant benefits for the collected signal and the spatial resolution on solid samples, rendered \u201cmacro\u201d geometries optional components, which increases the cost of the instrument. A low-cost, easy to use optional accessory that permits the use of cuvettes in the backscattering geometry of microscope-equipped Raman spectrometers is depicted in Figure 1a, and this was the first geometry to test. It is mounted in place of an objective in the microscope turret and accepts typical quartz cuvettes with an optical path of 10 mm, covered with a lid, in our case, to reduce the evaporation of the volatile components. A mirror at 45\u25e6 horizontally diverts the laser beam that is focused through a simple achromatic lens into the quartz cell. A spherical mirror behind the cuvette allows a second passage of the beam, as well as collection of the forward-scattered Raman signal, practically doubling the Raman signal in our setup. The obvious disadvantage of this scheme is the requirement of large volumes. A remedy is the use of a quartz cell of small optical path, but it results in significant signal decrease and requires stringent positioning of the cuvette on the focal point, and, even so, a parasitic signal from the glass, due to the long focal depth of the lens, cannot be avoided.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 4 of 15\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 15\nin our setup. The obvious disadvantage of this scheme is the requirement of large volumes. A remedy is the use of a quartz cell of small optical path, but it results in significant signal decrease and requires stringent positioning of the cuvette on the focal point, and, even so, a parasitic signal from the glass, due to the long focal depth of the lens, cannot be avoided.\nFigure 1. Different backscattering geometries for the excitation/collection of Raman spectra of liquids in \u00b5-Raman instruments: (a) accessory mounted in place of an objective, permitting the use of typical quartz cuvettes, (b) proposed simple arrangement of a container made by drilling a blind hole in a metallic block, (c) proposed geometry based on the use of a capillary tube to avoid evaporation.\nAnother, straightforward approach involves the use of an aluminum block with a small blind hole, filled with the liquid of interest and placed on the xy microscope table, as illustrated in Figure 1b. This arrangement allows direct excitation/collection from the free surface of the liquid, while the microscope objective of high numerical aperture ensures efficient light collection. This is an excellent approach for non-volatile liquids. For liquids of low volatility, the hole may be of small diameter (1\u20131.5 mm) and half-filled, reducing\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 5 of 15\nthe evaporation by reduction of the free liquid\u2013air interface and minimizing the required volume of the analyte. Care should be taken that the liquid level is not too low, so that the collecting angle of the objective is fully exploited. Even so, depending on the volatility of the analyte, the liquid level varies during the measurement, affecting the intensity of the spectrum. An airtight covering of the hole with a glass coverslip can significantly decrease the evaporation rate. However, for volatile liquids, condensation occurs on the coverslip, again affecting the spectrum intensity. Creating a liquid\u2013glass interface by fully filling the hole and placing a glass coverslip over, besides requiring more analyte volume, is more prone to the collection of a parasitic signal from the glass. The use of a coverslip made from a material with a non-interfering Raman spectrum (in intensity and spectral extent), such as Raman grade CaF2, can mitigate the problem. In all, this approach is excellent for the collection of spectra for liquids, as long as the intensities of different analytes are not to be directly compared, because small intensity variations were observed for the volatile liquids in this study. In fact, the measurements of the investigated samples were conducted under this scheme. However, for the acquisition of reference spectra, where the same experimental conditions are strictly required, this setup is usable, but not ideal. Holes of smaller diameters can take advantage of capillary forces to reduce evaporation; however, their cleaning becomes more difficult and time consuming. Therefore, the use of disposable capillary glass tubes was investigated. The level of the liquid inside a vertical capillary appeared less stable, probably partly due to gravity action, so a horizontal geometry was selected as depicted in Figure 1c. A capillary tube (5 \u00b5L, ~450 \u00b5m diameter) can be reproducibly placed in an optical fiber choke, attached in an in-house 3D-printed adjustable (yz tilt and position) mount. Instead, a simple mirror mount (yz tilt), in conjunction with the yz microscope stage degrees of freedom (yz position) can be used to render the laser beam coaxial to the capillary tube. Correct alignment is crucial to maximize the signal collection and eliminate the parasitic signal from the glass tube. The laser spot is focused on the midpoint of the capillary tube\u2019s diameter, on the surface of the liquid; ~40 \u00b5m inside the liquid to maximize the probed volume, in our case of transparent compounds. This approach yielded reproducible results since the surface of the liquid is stable for hours or considerably longer because the capillary force can detain very volatile analytes and practically eliminate the evaporation of the less volatile ones. To ensure maximum intensity consistency for the spectra of the different reference compounds, all of them were measured on the same day, one after the other, with the same alignment and calibration procedures for each. Another advantage of this method is the requirement of minute sample volumes that can also be maintained for further use, while measurement directly from the free liquid\u2019s surface increases the signal and eliminates parasitic signals from coverslips or glass containers. Finally, the suggested setup can serve particularly well for measurements in the case of strongly absorbing or scattering media, where the collected signal may originate only from the first few microns of the liquid at its interface with air, and strong focusing, as well as efficient signal collection are imperative for the acquisition of an adequate signal. Although this was not the case in the current study, the possibility to perform reliable measurements on volatile and/or highly absorbent or turbulent analytes renders the application of this approach more universal."

Their spectra are presented in Figure 2a.\nFigure 2.

Comparing the crystalline thymol spectrum with the spectrum of one of the essential oils, where the thymol\u2019s percentage was found to be high from GC-MS analysis (#3188, Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), differences can be observed (Figure 2b). The Raman bands of thymol in the essential oil appear broader, their relative intensities as well as their exact frequency vary, while some thymol peaks are almost absent from the essential oil\u2019s spectrum (e.g., at ~285, 483 and 956 cm\u22121). This is not unexpected when it concerns spectra of a compound in solution and its solid phase, but it is undesirable for quantification purposes. In order to obtain the reference spectrum of the \u201cliquid\u201d thymol, the solid compound was initially dissolved in methanol, which demonstrates only a few Raman peaks, none below 1000 cm\u22121, where the strongest peak of thymol (~740 cm\u22121) appears in line with [18,19].

            "text": "Essential oils from wild-growing aromatic plants of the genus Origanum, collected in summer from three localities of the Greek mainland and one in the Southeast Greek\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 7 of 15\nArchipelago (Table 1), were extracted by hydrodistillation, following the procedure described in the Section 3, and measured by Raman spectroscopy, as previously outlined.\nFrom the spectra depicted in Figure 3, the samples are easily differentiated regarding their composition, and the main constituent can be identified by comparison with the spectra of the reference compounds (Figure 2). Although both samples, #3188 and #3193, are from Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum plants, the EO spectrum of the #3188 sample is characterized by the intense peak of thymol at ~740 cm\u22121, while in that of the #3193, the carvacrol peak at ~759 cm\u22121 is dominant, reflecting the different plant localities. On the other hand, the Raman spectrum of #3259 (Origanum onites) strongly resembles the one of #3193, indicating similar chemical compositions, despite their different botanical identification and the long distance between their localities. This is not a surprise since both the species of the plant and the geographical area of its origin determine the chemical composition of the essential oil, underlining the need for both chemotaxonomy and botanical taxonomy to fully characterize the taxa of Lamiaceae family [28]. The presence of p-cymene can also be evidenced in all spectra (e.g., doublet around 808 cm\u22121), while \u03b3-terpinene in sample #3188 by a weak but characteristic peak at ~1700 cm\u22121. On the other hand, samples #3367 and #3368 (both Origanum vulgare subsp. vulgare from neighboring localities) exhibit very similar spectra, quite different from those of the previous samples, showing no evidence of appreciable amounts of either carvacrol or thymol. The spectra seem \u201ccontinuous\u201d in the range 700\u20131400 cm\u22121. Based on the available reference spectra, this may reflect the presence of linalool and/or contributions of multiple compounds of similar intensity. The peaks of high intensity at around 1650 cm\u22121 may contain contributions from sabinene (~1653 cm\u22121) and \u03b2-myrcene (~1634 cm\u22121), while sabinene and/or eucalyptol may be reflected in the band at ~654 cm\u22121; however, no exact match can be found. The higher concentration of \u03b3-terpinene in the spectrum of #3368 is evidenced by the weak but characteristic peak at ~1700 cm\u22121, as previously noted in [18,19]. These observations can be further confirmed by fitting the experimental spectra by multiple linear regression (dashed curves, Figure 3), using as a basis the available reference spectra of Figure 2a. Unlike samples #3188, #3193 and #3259, where a very good fit is observed, the fit for #3367 and #3368 is of poor quality; clear evidence that the spectra of compounds present in the EOs of these samples are not included in the spectral basis set. This is fully supported by the HS GC-MS analysis results of the same samples [28], where the available reference compounds represent only 21.5% of the identified compounds for sample #3367, while the respective value for the #3368 sample is 30.6%. \u03b2-Caryophyllene and D-germacrene, not included in the spectra references set, are the most abundant constituents, together representing 28.1% and 31.4% of the identified compounds in samples #3367 and #3368, respectively.

The chromatogram of sample #3259 in the vicinity of the terpinen-4-ol peak has been appropriately magnified to enhance readability.\nThe absolute difference in the values deduced by the two techniques (Raman, HS GCMS) remains less than 8%. Apparently, the successful quantification relies on the fact that the reference compounds available in the Raman spectra collection constitute a percentage of 90% or higher of the identified compounds by HS GC-MS. Only in the case of sample #3188 are there other constituents estimated at 1%, namely, isopropyl-methylanisole isomers (2.7%), \u03b1-terpinene (1.2%) and endo-borneol (1.2%), while the remaining up to 100% is covered by a multitude of compounds with values less than 1%. Besides uncertainties of experimental origin, deviations may also be attributed to compounds not included in the spectral basis dataset and the probing of the liquid phase in the Raman analysis rather than the gas phase probed in HS GC-MS. In all, the results affirm the applicability of combining Raman spectroscopy with multiple linear regression analysis for the quantification of essential oil compounds, but also underline the need for an extended intensity-consistent spectra database for successful application. Unlike the case of using PLS for quantification [13,18], which is usually based on data obtained by GC-MS, the current approach relies on data generated by the same technique (Raman spectroscopy), yielding independent results that can be compared with those from other techniques.

Only in the case of sample #3188 are there other constituents estimated at 1%, namely, isopropyl-methylanisole isomers (2.7%), \u03b1-terpinene (1.2%) and endo-borneol (1.2%), while the remaining up to 100% is covered by a multitude of compounds with values less than 1%.

Unlike the case of using PLS for quantification [13,18], which is usually based on data obtained by GC-MS, the current approach relies on data generated by the same technique (Raman spectroscopy), yielding independent results that can be compared with those from other techniques. Furthermore, calibration curves of the reference compounds [19,26,27] are not required, saving materials and time."

In this line, the acquisition of the references\u2019 spectra at high spectral resolution is useful since it would permit their numerical treatment to reduce their resolution, allowing their use in the analysis of sample spectra from instruments of lower spectral resolution acquired by, e.g., portable Raman instruments.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 12 of 15\nNumerical posttreatment of acquired Raman spectra is a usual practice, which includes reasonable smoothing for noise reduction and spectral background spectrum-specific subtraction, usually polynomial. In our case, spectra were not smoothed since they exhibited a very good signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, no background subtraction was applied either to the references\u2019 or the samples\u2019 spectra. Instead, a linear and six exponentially decaying, numerically generated spectra were included in the set of the reference compounds\u2019 spectra to account for any spectral background in the examined samples.\n3.3. Materials 3.3.1. Reference Compounds\nThe following compounds, usually present in Origanum essential oils [4], were used in analytical standard purity for the acquisition of the reference Raman spectra: carvacrol, p-cymene, \u03b3-terpinene, \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b1-pinene, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), (-) terpinen-4-ol and linalyl acetate, all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and thymol, \u03b1-terpineol, linalool and sabinene, all purchased from CPA Chem (Stara Zagora, Bulgaria). For the GC-MS analyses, reference compounds were diluted in LC-MS grade methanol, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n3.3.2. Plant Material\u2014Essential Oils\u2019 Isolation\nAerial plant parts of three taxa of the genus Origanum were collected in flowering stage from three localities of the Greek mainland (Kassandra Peninsula, Mt. Pelion and Mt. Belles) and one in the Southeast Greek Archipelago (island of Kos). The aerial parts were randomly selected from ten to fifteen individuals of each locality, and geographical coordinates and altitude were recorded (Table 1). Taxonomic identification of the collected plant material was based on the key characters, as well as the descriptions given in the specific monograph of Ietswaart [29] and Flora Europaea [30]. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Thessaloniki\u2019s Aristotle University (TAU). For the isolation of the essential oils, plants were dried in air, at ambient temperature (18\u201320 \u25e6C) and darkness, and leaves and inflorescences were hydrodistilled (Clevenger apparatus, 3 h). The EOs were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and stored in cold (4 \u25e6C) and dark conditions. For each sample, the content in essential oils (yield, in mL/100 g dry weight) is presented in Table 1.\n3.3.3. Headspace Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry\nHeadspace GC-MS analysis of the essential oils was performed as previously reported [28]. Before analysis, the essential oils were diluted in methanol at a ratio of 1:500 (v/v). Then, 20 \u00b5L were pipetted in a 20 mL autosampler headspace vial. Reference standards in methanol were also analyzed with the same chromatographic method. An EVOQ GC-TQ Bruker triple quadrupole system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with a CTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) was utilized. The chromatographic separation was carried out on an HP-INNOWAX (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Carrier gas (helium 99.999%) was set at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min and a split injection mode was employed. Incubation temperature and time were set at 90 \u25e6C and 15 min, respectively, agitator speed at 500 rpm and injection volume and flow rate at 1000 \u00b5L and 2 mL/min, respectively. Thermal gradient was set as follows: 52 \u25e6C for 2 min, increased to 80 \u25e6C with a 5 \u25e6C/min rate, held at 80 \u25e6C for 4 min and finally increased with a 4 \u25e6C/min rate to 250 \u25e6C for 1 min. Fragmentation was performed by applying Electron Impact Ionization at 70 eV. Full scan spectra were acquired from 25 to 500 amu, with a 250 ms scan time and a collection delay of 3.8 min. Injection port, ion source and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 250, 230 and 250 \u25e6C, respectively. Data processing was performed by the MSWS 8 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and the AMDIS program (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The NIST17 Mass\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1221 13 of 15\nSpectral Library and the retention times and mass spectra of reference compounds were utilized for the identification of the EOs\u2019 constituents."

            "text": "In the present study, \u00b5-Raman spectroscopy was evaluated for the characterization of essential oils and the quantification of their constituents. Oregano essential oils were used as case study materials. A simple experimental setup was developed to encounter volatility and reproducibility issues during the Raman spectroscopic analysis of liquids in minute volumes. It involved the use of glass capillary tubes, which can effectively detain very small volumes of volatile analytes, saving precious raw materials. Furthermore, the proposed setup permits the acquisition of Raman spectra directly from the free surface of the liquid, enhancing the intensity of the collected signal and avoiding any parasitic signals from glass containers. The intensity-consistent Raman spectra database of reference compounds facilitated by the developed experimental protocol, combined with multiple linear regression analysis, was successfully applied in the identification and quantification of essential oil constituents of Origanum plants, as testified by the comparison of Raman and HS GC-MS quantifications. The latter, although time consuming, is the technique of choice since the separation of the constituents in combination with the recording of their molecular masses permit the detection, identification and quantification of all volatile compounds, even in very small quantities. On the other hand, in Raman spectroscopy, where the spectrum contains the overlapping contributions of all the constituents of the EOs, inevitably, the presence of compounds in low concentration is masked and only the most abundant ones can be detected and safely quantified. The techniques are not antagonistic since the comprehensive analysis of the EOs\u2019 constituents that the chromatographic technique provides is counterbalanced by the simplicity and straightforwardness of Raman spectroscopy. However, in the presented approach, an extended intensity-consistent Raman spectral database of reference compounds is vital for reliable quantification. Furthermore, the applicability of \u00b5-Raman spectroscopy for identifying the main components of the essential oil directly from the oregano leaves\u2019 glands was also demonstrated. This brings a new perspective to the characterization of plant raw material by in situ measurements, whether combining botanical and chemical taxonomy on the field, or screening raw materials for the industry.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.N.A., D.C. and S.K.; methodology, D.C., A.N.A., E.K., A.N. and D.M.; collection and taxonomic identification, D.M. and S.K.; investigation, E.K., A.N., D.M., A.N.A., S.K. and D.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, E.K., A.N., D.M., D.C., S.K. and A.N.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.C., A.N.A. and S.K.; supervision, A.N.A., D.C. and S.K.; project administration, A.N.A.; funding acquisition, A.N.A., D.C. and S.K.
