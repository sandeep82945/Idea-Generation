 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Improve the quality of the token-level quality estimation model. The current model still mistakenly labels many reference tokens as negative and has limited recall of positive tokens. More advanced pretraining and fine-tuning methods could help the model better distinguish high-quality tokens.

2. Explore different methods to compose the lexical constraints from the N-best hypotheses besides majority voting. For example, weighting the predictions by the generation probabilities or reranking scores of the hypotheses.

3. Evaluate the impact of the N-best list diversity on the proposed method's effectiveness. More diverse hypotheses may provide more high-quality fragments to ensemble but could also introduce more noise.

4. Apply the proposed method to other generation tasks like dialog systems, story generation, and data-to-text generation. The method could potentially improve the quality in these open-ended generation scenarios.

5. Combine the proposed method with iterative refinement approaches like self-correction. The initial ensemble output could provide a better starting point for further editing to reach higher quality.
