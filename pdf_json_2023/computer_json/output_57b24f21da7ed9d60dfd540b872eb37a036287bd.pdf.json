    "abstractText": "Introduction: Within the technological development path, chatbots are considered an important tool for economic and social entities to become more efficient and to develop customer-centric experiences that mimic human behavior. Although artificial intelligence is increasingly used, there is a lack of empirical studies that aim to understand consumers\u2019 experience with chatbots. Moreover, in a context characterized by constant population aging and an increased life-expectancy, the way aging adults perceive technology becomes of great interest. However, based on the digital divide (unequal access to technology, knowledge, and resources), and since young adults (aged between 18 and 34 years old) are considered to have greater affinity for technology, most of the research is dedicated to their perception. The present paper investigates the way chatbots are perceived by middle-aged and aging adults in Romania.",

Although artificial intelligence is increasingly used, there is a\nlack of empirical studies that aim to understand consumers\u2019 experience with\nchatbots. Moreover, in a context characterized by constant population aging\nand an increased life-expectancy, the way aging adults perceive technology\nbecomes of great interest. However, based on the digital divide (unequal\naccess to technology, knowledge, and resources), and since young adults\n(aged between 18 and 34\u00a0years old) are considered to have greater affinity for\ntechnology, most of the research is dedicated to their perception. The present\npaper investigates the way chatbots are perceived by middle-aged and aging\nadults in Romania.\nMethods: An online opinion survey has been conducted. The age-range of the subjects is 40\u201378 years old, a convenience sampling technique being\nused (N = 235). The timeframe of the study is May\u2013June 2021. Thus, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic is the core context of the research. A covariance-based\nstructural equation modelling (CB-SEM) has been used to test the theoretical\nassumptions as it is a procedure used for complex conceptual models and\ntheory testing.\nResults: The results show that while perceived ease of use is explained by the effort, the competence, and the perceive external control in interacting\nwith chatbots, perceived usefulness is supported by the perceived ease of\nuse and subjective norms. Furthermore, individuals are likely to further use\nchatbots (behavioral intention) if they consider this interaction useful and if\nthe others\u2019 opinion is in favor of using it. Gender and age seem to have no\neffect on behavioral intention. As studies on chatbots and aging adults are few\nand are mainly investigating reactions in the healthcare domain, this research\nis one of the first attempts to better understand the way chatbots in a not\ndomain-specific context are perceived later in life. Likewise, judging from a\nbusiness perspective, the results can help economic and social organizations\nto improve and adapt AI-based interaction for the aging customers.\nKEYWORDS\nchatbots, technology acceptance model, middle-aged and aging adults, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, behavioral intention\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1111003"

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic situation has transformed technology into a focal point. From work-from-home situations to remote education and remote communication, the pandemic forced individuals, regardless of their cognitive, affective, and behavioral profile, to adopt all types of technologies that have been rapidly developed and adapted. Although the technological solutions existed before the crisis, the rhythm of implementing them increased exponentially. Likewise, since the beginning of the pandemic, there is an increasing pressure on the healthcare system, especially dedicated to aging population, and, thus, digital solutions are intensively searched for (Valtolina and Marchionna, 2021). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered as one of the most important priorities when it comes to investment (Sheth et\u00a0al., 2019). In this respect, chatbots\u2019 market is expected to growth to USD 24.98 billion with a 24.2% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) by 2030 (Market Research Report, 2022).\nWithin the technological development path, chatbots are an important tool for companies to become more efficient (Canhoto and Clear, 2020), to create a more personalized digital experience, and to develop \u201ccustomer-centric\u201d experiences that mimic human behavior (Toader et\u00a0al., 2020). Moreover, chatbots are increasingly used for healthcare purposes (Tamamizu et\u00a0al., 2017; Mesbah and Pumplun, 2020; Zhang and Zheng, 2021), as they support the independence of aging adults, reduce the burden on caregivers, have the capacity to make people talk more honestly (Miura et\u00a0al., 2022), and are effective in increasing the conversation time (Ryu et\u00a0al., 2020).\nBeing built based on AI\u2019s features, chatbots are considered intelligent entities that understand verbal, written, or multimodal communication, that are programmed to semantically respond, using natural conversational language, and that can learn from past experiences to improve themselves (Sheth et\u00a0al., 2019; Toader et\u00a0al., 2020). Although chatbots are already usually found in the online retail domain, their presence is increasingly acknowledged in the healthcare field (Valtolina and Marchionna, 2021). Thus, the most common chatbot applications are in domains as healthcare, e-commerce / customer services, education, financial and banking services (B\u00e4chle et\u00a0al., 2018; Toader et\u00a0al., 2020; Alt et\u00a0al., 2021), or tourism (Meli\u00e1n-Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe changes brought by the technological development have led to fundamental changes in the interaction between economic or social entities and consumers (Toader et\u00a0 al., 2020). Thus, studying chatbots\u2019 impact on individuals\u2019 perception becomes of great importance. Although AI technologies are increasingly used in interactions with customers, from pre-purchase to service support, there is a lack of empirical studies that aim to understand consumers\u2019 experience with AI in general, and with chatbots in particular (Ameen et\u00a0al., 2020; Nichifor et\u00a0al., 2021). Likewise, most of the studies are in the computer science domain and are technically testing chatbots\u2019 prototypes.\nMoreover, in social sciences, chatbot studies on the Romanian context are limited. The existing ones are mainly focused on the relationship between chatbots\u2019 error and gender, social presence,\nperceived competence, anthropomorphic design and trust in the digital marketing domain (Toader et\u00a0al., 2020), on the acceptance of digital banking services (Alt et\u00a0al., 2021; Schipor and Duhnea, 2021), on electronic commerce (Nichifor et\u00a0 al., 2021), or on marketing communication (Popescu, 2020). Yet, a not domainspecific approach that considers regular chatbots used in all types of daily online interactions might add value to the already existing research.\nSimultaneously with the technological development, one of the most significant social transformations of the twenty-first century is the population aging. Globally, persons aged 65 or above have outnumbered children under 5 years old and it is estimated that by 2050, there will be\u00a0 around 2.1 billion aging adults worldwide (United Nations (UN), 2022). In the case of Romania, the average age is already 42 years old, and the most numerous age-range is 50\u201354 years old (Dan, 2022). Furthermore, it is estimated that by 2050, 60% of the population will be\u00a0over 65 years old (Coman, 2021) and, thus, loneliness and isolation are predicted to deepen (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021). This reality is believed to increase both the economic and social pressure, as there is a rise in public health expenditure (Chen and Schulz, 2016; Fang and Chang, 2016; Segercrantz and Forss, 2019), a permanent need for improved healthcare assistance and assistive living, and a scarce of providers (Hofmann, 2013; Bassi et\u00a0al., 2021). Low income and high workload generate a shortage of caregivers (Yang et\u00a0al., 2015).\nThus, technology is believed to solve the gap between the needs of aging population and the potential of the society to overcome them, to prevent isolation, to communicate, to interact, and to monitor (Niehaves and Plattfaut, 2014; Petrie et\u00a0al., 2014; Huh and Seo, 2015). In this context, an improved quality of life means smart medical care, virtual companion, mental health monitoring, open-ended conversations, emotional and knowledge-based responses, reminders, notifications, or financial duties (Bassi et\u00a0al., 2021).\nBaby boomers (people between 57 and 75 years old) and generation X (people between 42 and 56 years old) are considered \u201cdigital illiterates\u201d (Vasilateanu and Turcus, 2019). As this dichotomy is too sharp, Lenhart and Horrigan (2003) consider that a digital spectrum approach is more correct. Relying on the fact that each generation has its technology laggards, on the fact that aging adults are not a homogenous cohort in terms of technology use, age should be\u00a0correlated with other variables, as education or frequency of use of a certain application or device (Loos, 2012). Based on the digital divide (unequal access to technology, knowledge, and resources; DiMaggio et\u00a0al., 2001), since young people are considered to have a greater affinity for technology, most of the research is dedicated to the perception of Generation Z and Millennials (people between 18 and 34 years old; Nichifor et\u00a0 al., 2021; Schipor and Duhnea, 2021). Thus, unfairly, the views of middleaged individuals and aging adults on technology are receiving less attention (Nikou, 2015). Digital divide should rather be\u00a0understood as relative rather than absolute inequalities that can be\u00a0reduced (Van Dijk and Hacker, 2003). Furthermore, as\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nthe literature highlights a varied range of technologies that can improve aging adults\u2019 lives, their perception on technology is rarely assessed (Pal et\u00a0al., 2018). Since the technology developers are usually young people, a gap between what is invented and what is needed appears (Lee and Coughlin, 2014). Although chatbots are designed to be\u00a0able to identify health problems based on the exposed symptoms, such applications are mainly restricted to young generations (Mesbah and Pumplun, 2020). Thus, the aging adults\u2019 user experience should be\u00a0 better understood for more suitable innovations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies that focus on the general use of chatbots by aging population, without particularly emphasizing the healthcare or assistive domains. One of the newest paper in this respect is a systematic literature review written by Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al. (2021) in which authors are interested in the engagement strategies of the chatbots, in their computational environments, in the input data format accepted, in the different types of personalization offered, and in the evaluation techniques for conversational agents. Being based on a systematic analysis of 53 papers, the main results of the study emphasize that personalization, context adaptation, a speech type input, and an intuitive system are at the core of an increased engagement and interaction with chatbots (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021). However, based on the existing findings,, further empirical investigation is needed.\nBased on the existing literature, we\u00a0find that chatbots are mainly studied from a computer science perspective, on a young audience, or with a strong focus on healthcare domain. Thus, the present paper aims to empirically deepen the social-science knowledge on chatbots both by understanding the middle-aged and aging adults\u2019 perceptions on chatbots in Romania and by analyzing possible determinants of behavioral intention on using chatbots in a not domain-specific perspective. An online opinion survey has been conducted on a convenience sample (N = 235), aged between 40 and 78 years old (M = 51.13, SD = 5.954). Although aging adults, or elderly, are persons aged 60 years old and above (United Nations (UN), 2017), due to the limitations given by the convenience sampling procedure, this study extends the analyzed age range and aims to comparatively investigate the differences, if any, between middle-aged adults and aging ones. The survey has been applied in the COVID-19 pandemic situation, between May and June 2021. By relying on Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989) and on its extended version (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008), the respondents are mainly inquired on the general perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, enjoyment, competence, effort, pressure, satisfaction, perception of external control, subjective norms, and behavioral intention, all related to the use of chatbots.\nBased on Digital Economy and Society Index (2022) report, Romania is ranked as the last European Union (EU) country on digital skills and with a poor performance regarding the integration of digital technologies and digital public services. Furthermore, among developing countries, Romania is considered to be\u00a0a case in which aging adults are the latest technology adopters (Ivan and Cutler, 2021). This situation has been deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic (Motorga, 2022). Considering this poor digital literacy\ncontext, Romania becomes a significant case-study on which technological development and adoption is urgently needed.\nThe implications of the paper are at least threefold. First, the present study aims to enrich the existing literature with a technology acceptance overview on the way chatbots are perceived, regardless of the domain. Interestingly, in comparison with the results of other studies testing technology acceptance models, the present data show that some variables (e.g., enjoyment, satisfaction, etc) do not have the hypothesized effect in explaining behavioral intention in respect to chatbot interaction. Explanations might be\u00a0related to the target group of the study (which is different than most of the samples used in similar context), or to their understanding and experience with chatbots. Thus, the results open new research perspectives for verifying the present model\u2019s outcomes. Second, the research fulfills the existing gap on the target group. Since most of the studied samples are composed of young people, the present approach focuses on middle-aged and aging adults. Finally, judging from a business perspective, the results can help economic and social organizations to improve and adapt AI-based interaction for the aging customers."

            "text": "Chatbots are also known as chatterbots (Miliani et\u00a0al., 2021), smart bots or interactive agents (Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020), virtual assistants or conversational agents (Sheth et\u00a0 al., 2019). They are chatty software machines that, based on artificial intelligence features and natural language processing, interact with users using written text or spoken language (B\u00e4chle et\u00a0al., 2018) and relying on image, video, and audio processing (Bala et\u00a0al., 2017). Put it differently, a chatbot is a computer program designed to interact through a natural dialog with users and to create the sensation of communicating with a human being (Hussain et\u00a0al., 2019). Conversational agents are either on-screen or as voice assistants (Gunathilaka et\u00a0al., 2020).\nWhen Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test [in which users are tested if they are capable to differentiate between an interaction with a human being or a machine (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020)], starting from the question \u201cif machines can think?,\u201d the idea of chatbots started to spread (Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020). Chatbot ELIZA, a simulation of a person-centric psychotherapist, is the first chatbot attempt. It was developed in 1966 by Josepth Weizenbaum and it used word and pattern matching techniques to conduct simple conversation (B\u00e4chle et\u00a0al., 2018; Nichifor et\u00a0al., 2021). ELIZA program used to search for keywords within the user\u2019s input and transform the sentence into a script (Hussain et\u00a0al., 2019). In the 80\u2019s, chatbots have been mainly developed for the gaming industry and they have been used for testing if individuals can recognize them as being machines or humans (B\u00e4chle et\u00a0al., 2018). Although early chatbots lacked the ability to maintain a conversation going (Hussain et\u00a0 al., 2019), as the conversational agents use more and more natural language processing, they pass the Turing Test (Justo et\u00a0al., 2021). In 1995, ALICE chatbot, a highly awarded software, has been developed\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nand has been considered the \u201cmost human computer\u201d until that moment (Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020). After the development of chatbots available through messenger application, like SmarterChild, in 2001, or Wechat in 2009 (Mokmin and Ibrahim, 2021), the creation of virtual personal assistance has begun (e.g., Siri form Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon, Google Assistant, or IBM Watson; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2018; Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020; Gunathilaka et\u00a0al., 2020).\nChatbots can be\u00a0either task-oriented or non-task-oriented (Hussain et\u00a0al., 2019). Task-oriented chatbots are created for very specific tasks and domain-based conversations. Examples in this respect are booking accommodation, booking a flight, placing an order in online shopping, accessing specific information, etc (Hussain et\u00a0al., 2019). The drawback of a task-oriented system is that it cannot exceed the programmed topic scope (Su et\u00a0al., 2017). Non-task-oriented chatbots is rather keen on conversating for entertainment purpose in all kinds of domains and in an unstructured manner (Hussain et\u00a0al., 2019; Justo et\u00a0al., 2021).\nAs chatbots are imitating human-to-human interaction, they are often perceived as anthropomorphic (Seeger et\u00a0 al., 2018). Moreover, they are one of the most used examples of intelligent human-computer interaction (Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020). The literature talks about the capability of chatbots to expand beyond repetitive tasks (mechanically intelligent AI) and conduct thinking tasks (analytical intelligent AI), creative tasks (intuitive intelligent AI), and feeling tasks (empathetic intelligent AI). While mechanic chatbots provide predefined responses, the analytical chatbots analyze the given problems, intuitive chatbots contextually understand complains, and emphatic chatbots recognize and understand users\u2019 emotions (Youn and Jin, 2021).\nWhile the technological development\u2019s aim is that of creating realistic human-like chatbots, in comparison with an employee, a chatbot is constantly updating, has unlimited memory, acts instantly, and it is available all the time (Lo Presti et\u00a0al., 2021). The most important features of chatbots are their capability of being self-contained, always active, and able to track users\u2019 interest, preferences, and socio-demographics (Tascini, 2019). Chatbots can be\u00a0 used for customer services, allowing companies to target consumers in a very personalized way (Alt et\u00a0 al., 2021) and expanding satisfaction and engagement (Maniou and Veglis, 2020). They are considered a technological trend for the companies as they can speed up and facilitate customer service process through providing online information or placing orders in real time (Ashfaq et\u00a0al., 2020; Nichifor et\u00a0al., 2021). Chatbots allow users to interact online with different organizations, anytime and from any place, and offer quick and meaningful responses (Alt et\u00a0al., 2021). A useful chatbot is responsible to provide assistance without interfering, and developing a sense of trust (Zamora, 2017).\nThe functionality of chatbots is either for entertainment or utilitarian (Zamora, 2017). Conversational systems are increasingly used and are useful both at home and for leisure (e.g., Alexa, Siri), or in our professional life (e.g., Siri, Cortana) for managing the schedule or for educational purposes (Justo et\u00a0al., 2021; Valtolina and Hu, 2021). Chatbots are mainly used for obtaining information, for interacting needs and out of curiosity (Gunathilaka et\u00a0al., 2020).\nStudies have revealed that chatbots perform better is they are specifically created for a certain domain or group (De ArribaP\u00e9rez et\u00a0 al., 2021). Chatbots can be\u00a0 used in domains such as e-commerce, business, marketing, communication, education, news, health, food, design, finance, entertainment, travel, or utilities, but not limited to them (Liu et\u00a0al., 2018; Adamopoulou and Moussiades, 2020). Technology is undoubtedly perceived as being the solution for improving healthcare. Scholars that develop chatbots talk about the need of designing empathetic virtual companions to alleviate isolation and loneliness (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021) and to fulfill the emotional needs of the aging adults and to increase likeability and trustworthiness towards machines (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2015). As the main motivation to use chatbot is productivity, together with entertainment and socialization, chatbots should be\u00a0 equally built as a tool, a toy, and a friend (Brandtzaeg and F\u00f8lstad, 2017).\nThe literature also emphasizes on the downsides of chatbots use, especially on the reluctance on interacting with an impersonal machine instead of a human being (Nichifor et\u00a0 al., 2021). Although chatbots are increasingly resembling humans, this can be\u00a0perceived as a disadvantage since privacy and security issues are associated with human hackers (Michiels, 2017). At the same time, while programmed with natural language processing, the interaction with chatbots is not intuitive enough and might imply errors. Thus, the lack of human feelings and emotions echoes on the lack of engagement and personality (Knol, 2019). For instance, in a shopping context, most of the users feel uncomfortable receiving personalized feedback from chatbots and consider them as being immature technology (Rese et\u00a0 al., 2020; Smutny and Schreiberova, 2020). Hildebrand and Bergner (2019) highlight the possibility that a chatbot service interaction provided to an already disappointed consumer might have a deep negative effect on both the service value and the brand or the organization. Furthermore, while users might have limited knowledge on chatbots and might consider them as inferior and unworthy entities to communicated with, the feeling of discomfort can lead to the refusal of interaction (Ivanov and Webster, 2017). When it comes to elderly, chatbots are associated with privacy issues, with loss of autonomy, with technical fears, or with lack of usefulness that can increase their resistance and avoidance (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, although useful for organizations, there are many variables that can deter a good communication flow between chatbots and users. While, on one hand, there are the features of the chatbots (e.g., the way they are designed, their cognitive capabilities, etc), on the other hand there are the variables affecting the perception on them (e.g., knowledge on and experience with technology, the need for a human-natural conversation, or usefulness).\nTechnology acceptance, chatbots and aging\nRenaud and Van Biljon (2008) talk about three main reasons for technology adoption. First, there is the support given for certain activities, as information, communication, administrative,\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nentertainment, or health monitoring. Second, there is the convenience reason, referring to reducing physical and mental endeavor. Finally, there are the technology features, namely the design of the device, specific actions, and options. The attitude toward technology, measured on the strength of how much an individual likes or dislikes it, is also believed to be\u00a0a key factor in accepting and adopting a particular technology (Edison and Geissler, 2003).\nThe most referred to theory on technology acceptance is Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; Davis, 1989). Aiming to predict behavior, this theory is inspired from the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1985). TAM emphasizes that perceived ease of use and the perceived usefulness, together with other external variables, can predict the attitude towards using a certain technology, the intentional behavior, and, finally, the actual behavior (Davis, 1989; Renaud and Van Biljon, 2008; Minge et\u00a0al., 2014; Alt et\u00a0al., 2021). While perceived ease of use is defined as the degree to which using a particular device or system is free from effort, perceived usefulness is the degree to which using a certain device enhances one\u2019s performance (Davis, 1989; Wang and Sun, 2016). Although perceived usefulness is considered as being a stronger predictor for the intentional behavior, perceived ease of use is a key variable for the initial acceptance (Lin et\u00a0al., 2007; Renaud and Ramsay, 2007). Behavioral intention, as a strong predictor of the actual behavior, is defined as the strength of one\u2019s aim to execute a specific behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). Furthermore, as a certain device or application is easy to use, it is predicted that this perception is likely to influence the perceived usefulness (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nOne of the most complex models that aims to explain technology acceptance is TAM3 (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008). Being developed in a managerial context and on a longitudinal perspective, the new model builds on the anchoring and adjustment framing of human decision and adds new variables and connections to the previous models. In the context of decision making, anchoring refers to relying on the available initial information, information that can further influence the decision but that will decline over time when adjustment knowledge will be\u00a0accessible (Cohen and Reed, 2006; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2016). Thus, the anchor variables, as device self-efficacy [perceived abilities to perform a specific task using a certain technology (Compeau and Higgins, 1995)], perception of external control [perceived control and resources on using a certain technology (Venkatesh et\u00a0al., 2003)], and device anxiety (fear on using a certain technology) are considered as influencing the perceived ease of use (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe same relationship is developed when it comes to adjustment variables as perceived enjoyment on the use of a certain technology and objective usability (the effort required to interact with a certain technology; Venkatesh, 2000). The literature stresses on some universal incentives that can motivate individuals and that can predict intention to use a certain technology. While on one hand, there are the utilitarian rewards, as achievements, or\nease of use, on the other hand, there are the hedonic rewards, as enjoyment and entertainment (Kim et\u00a0al., 2018; Van Roy et\u00a0al., 2018). Relying on Uses and gratification theory (Blumler and Katz, 1974), users tend to accept a device or an application if they feel rewarded (in terms of knowledge, relaxation, escapism, or social interaction) by using it (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2018; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018). Likewise, an enjoyable experience with the technology is becoming increasingly infused into acceptance decision (Deng, 2017; Tsoy, 2017). Strongly linked with enjoyment, satisfaction is also considered as an import variable that can positively influence the perceived ease of use of a certain device or application (Zamora, 2017). At the same time, subjective norms, defined as the degree to which users consider that people in their trust circle should use a certain technology (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000), are believed to influence the perceived usefulness and behavioral intention.\nEspecially affected by the pandemic, but even beyond it, aging adults\u2019 lives are usually characterized by loneliness and isolation. To avoid mental issues, like depression and anxiety, they need to be\u00a0engaged into the daily routine, to be\u00a0stimulated and entertained (Valtolina and Hu, 2021). Social interaction is considered a basic need for aging population in which solitude is one of the biggest issues (De Arriba-P\u00e9rez et\u00a0al., 2021). Like in a vicious circle, social isolation, rejection, or loneliness seems to have a paramount negative effect on the general and mental health of an individual. Thus, assistive technology, by its social interaction capabilities and engagement, can help in preventing illnesses (Gunathilaka et\u00a0al., 2020) and offers a more comfortable and cost-effective medical care (Mesbah and Pumplun, 2020). However, although technology can solve this problem, aging adults are resistant to change (Vichitvanichphong et\u00a0al., 2017) and the digital divide is a barrier (De Arriba-P\u00e9rez et\u00a0al., 2021). Considering that many devices and applications are created without considering users\u2019 perception and are designed by young people, many aging adults are reluctant to products they do not understand (Lee and Coughlin, 2014; Peliz\u00e4usHoffmeister, 2016). In this respect, the experience with a certain technology is a key moderator variable for perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness relationship, for the technology anxiety and perceived ease of use, and for the perceived ease of use and behavioral intention (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008). In the present context, the previous use of chatbots (Luo and Remus, 2014), the previous knowledge on them (Cui and Wu, 2019), the initial attitude on them (Hall et\u00a0al., 2017), and how it is liked might be\u00a0important variables.\nSome studies, by offering a generalized perspective, claim that aging adults perceive themselves as being too old to learn how to use technology (Feist et\u00a0al., 2010). They are having less experience with devices, have fewer specific skills (Damant and Knapp, 2015), and the feelings of helplessness are being reinforced by failed previous experiences (Minge et\u00a0al., 2014). In the case of aging population, some of the main largely accepted motivations to learn to use technology are social integration, usefulness, and security (Chou and Liu, 2016; Wang et\u00a0al., 2018). Thus, being\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nhelpful and fulfilling needs and expectations become paramount variables (Gatti et\u00a0al., 2017).\nWhen it comes to chatbots, most of the studies are relying on young samples. Moreover, the literature review reveals that almost all papers on the use of chatbots for aging population are related to the healthcare or assistive domain. Almost all of them are written from a technical point of view by computer science specialists. Although AI developments in assistive technology are advanced, there is still work to be\u00a0done for achieving a proper chatbot for end aging users (De Arriba-P\u00e9rez et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, the existing studies refer to presenting, designing, and testing prototypes of conversational agents with meaningful, empathetic emotional, and friendship capabilities (Yang et\u00a0al., 2015; Bassi et\u00a0al., 2021), with personalized entertainment content access (De Arriba-P\u00e9rez et\u00a0al., 2021), with workplace environment facilities (B\u00e4chle et\u00a0al., 2018), with capabilities to promote healthy habits through a coaching model (Justo et\u00a0 al., 2021), with public administration abilities (Miliani et\u00a0 al., 2021), with virtual caregiving attributions (Su et\u00a0al., 2017; Ryu et\u00a0al., 2020; Valtolina and Hu, 2021; Miura et\u00a0al., 2022).\nIn a systematic literature review on general use of chatbots by aging adults, Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0 al. (2021) have found that, considering the innovations in natural language processing, speech is the most used and preferred input format for aging adults to interact with chatbots. They also emphasize that assistive conversational agents still face acceptance problems, low involvement, and low user satisfaction mainly due to the loss of autonomy, privacy, and technical errors (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021).\nBased on a set of interviews on assistive living with long term patients in Sri\u00a0Lanka, Gunathilaka et\u00a0al. (2020) have found that, due to poor sight, voice-based conversational agents can be\u00a0helpful for long-term patient care if they are specialized for specific requirements, in accordance with individuals\u2019 needs. However, although virtual agents can help aging adults to be\u00a0 more independent and better enjoy the lonely moments, the devices cannot substitute a human caregiver especially from an emotional point of view (Gunathilaka et\u00a0al., 2020).\nA comprehensive study on aging adults\u2019 acceptance of health chatbots is using the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model (Venkatesh et\u00a0al., 2012) to qualitatively test the factors that contribute to the adoption intention (Mesbah and Pumplun, 2020). Beside the interviews, the respondents have tested a health chatbot for a better understanding of the technology. The results show that behavioral intention to use a health chatbot depends not only on the performance expectancy, effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, as the initial model states, but also on variables as patience, resistance to change, need for emotional support, technology self-efficacy and anxiety, privacy risk expectancy, or trust in the technology and in the recommendation of a chatbot (Amato et\u00a0al., 2017; Mesbah and Pumplun, 2020). As trust is especially considered an important factor in technology acceptance, it is predicted to positively impact the intention to use a certain technology, the perceived ease of use\nand the perceived usefulness when it comes to e-commerce and e-services (Gefen and Straub, 2003; Pavlou, 2003; Lankton et\u00a0al., 2015; Cardona et\u00a0al., 2021).\nWhen it comes to gender, technology acceptance is debatable. While some studies consider that there are no significant relationships between gender and computer attitude (Nash and Moroz, 1997), men tend to score higher than women in affinity for technology (Edison and Geissler, 2003). Gender is usually considered as a moderator variable within the technology acceptance models (Bagana et\u00a0al., 2021). Although the difference between men and women is narrow, men are believed to experience a lower level of technology anxiety (Damant and Knapp, 2015) and thus a higher behavioral intention.\nBased on the above-described literature, the hypotheses of the paper are listed below:\nH1: Perceived ease of use of chatbots is positively impacted by enjoyment (H1a), satisfaction (H1b), effort (H1c), competence (H1d), pressure (H1e), and perception of external control (H1f).\nH2: Perceived usefulness of a chatbot is positively impacted by the perceived ease of use (H2a) and the subjective norms (H2b).\nH3: Behavioral intention to use a chatbot in the future is positively impacted by the perceived usefulness (H3a), perceived ease of use (H3b), subjective norms (H3c), and previous experience with a chatbot [knowledge on chatbots (H3d), hearing about chatbots (H3e), use of chatbots (H3f), and like chatbots (H3g)].\nH4: Men in comparison with women (H4a), and middle-aged in comparison with aging adults (H4b) are more likely to report a higher level of behavioral intention to use chatbots in the future.\nThe schematic version of the structural model is presented in the Figure\u00a01."

For a clear understanding of the research scope, the questionnaire has an introduction part in\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nwhich the aim of the survey is presented together with information about the anonymity and confidentiality of the data. Moreover, for a more accurate understanding of a chatbot interaction, a small example has been given at the beginning of the survey (Figure\u00a02). Andrei is the chosen name for the chatbot, as it is one of the most familiar names in Romania.\nThe questionnaire is composed of three main sections. The first section evaluates the previous experience with chatbots (if the users have heard of chatbots, of they use them, if they have knowledge on them, and if they like interacting with them). At the same time, the situations in which chatbots have been used and their perceived benefits are inquired. The second section highlights the main variables of technology acceptance models: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, enjoyment, satisfaction, effort, competence, pressure, perception of external control, subjective norms, and behavioral intention. The last section is dedicated to the socio-demographical variables.\nA covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) has been used to test the theoretical assumptions as it is a procedure used for complex conceptual models (Nitzl, 2016; Hair J. et\u00a0al., 2019) and theory testing (Hair J. et\u00a0al., 2019; Hair J.

In the case of the present paper, middle-aged respondents are considered the ones between 40 and 50, and the aging ones are over 50. The age range of the present sample is 40\u201378 and these age limits are due to the sample selection process. The sample has\nFIGURE\u00a01 The structural model.\nFIGURE\u00a02 An example of chatbot interaction given within the survey.\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nbeen selected using the convenience sampling technique (Parker et\u00a0 al., 2019). Undergraduate communication students, on a voluntary basis and coordinated by the authors, sent the online questionnaires to their aging relatives. The questionnaires have been filled in between May and June 2021. Most of the respondents have an urban residence, have university studies, and have an income higher than 500 euros per month. Thus, there is the need to emphasize, from the very beginning, an over-representation of some demographic groups in the sample.\nThe table below (Table\u00a01) summarizes the main demographic variables of the respondents."

            "text": "The measurements have been adapted from the previous validated methodologies and developed based on the literature.\nThe previous experience with chatbots is measured by using the following variables. The respondents have been asked if they have heard about chatbots (HC) and if they have ever used them (UC; Lou and Remus, 2014) on scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = never and 7 = very frequently. Likewise, on a 7-point scale (1 = nothing at all, 7 = a lot), they have been inquired on their knowledge about chatbots (KC; Cui and Wu, 2019). The general attitude towards chatbots has been measured by using a simple question on liking this type of interaction (LKC; Edison and Geissler, 2003), on a 7-point scale, where 1 = not at all and 7 = very much.\nThe perceived ease of use (PEOU) scale, with seven items, is measured on 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Van der Heijden et\u00a0al., 2003; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008; Luo and Remus, 2014).\nThe perceive usefulness (PU) of interacting with chatbots uses nine items and it is measured on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008; Luo and Remus, 2014; O\u2019Brien et\u00a0al., 2018).\nThe enjoyment (ENJ) produced by interacting with a chatbot is measured through eight items, on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Ryan, 1982; Ryan et\u00a0al., 1983, 1990, 1991; Plant and Ryan, 1985; McAuley et\u00a0al., 1987; Deci et\u00a0al., 1994; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe satisfaction (SA) with the interaction, or the output quality is measured through six items on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Lou and Remus, 2014; Sherry et\u00a0al., 2006; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe effort (EFF) involved in chatbot interaction, or the objective usability, is measured using two items, on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Ryan, 1982; Ryan et\u00a0al., 1983, 1990, 1991; Plant and Ryan, 1985; McAuley et\u00a0al., 1987; Deci et\u00a0al., 1994; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe perceived competence (COMP) of using a chatbot, or technology self-efficacy, is measured based on four items, on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Ryan, 1982; Ryan et\u00a0 al., 1983, 1991; Plant and Ryan, 1985; McAuley et\u00a0al., 1987; Ryan et\u00a0al., 1990; Deci et\u00a0al., 1994; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe pressure (PRS) or anxiety generated by an interaction with a chatbot is measured by using 5 items on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Ryan, 1982; Ryan et\u00a0al., 1983, 1990, 1991; Plant and Ryan, 1985; McAuley et\u00a0al., 1987; Deci et\u00a0al., 1994; Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe perception of external control (PEC), or how much control one has on interacting with chatbots, is measured through two items on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe subjective norms (SN) variable (the degree to which one perceives that people who are important to that person think he/ she should use the system) is measured through two items on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008).\nThe behavioral intention (BI), or the intention to use chatbots in the future, is measured through four items on a 7-point scale, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree (Lou and Remus, 2014).\nThe table below (Table\u00a02) summarizes all the variable and items used and provides descriptive data for each item. The internal consistency has been computed using Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 value. Overall, the results are satisfactory as all the constructs are higher than the acceptable threshold value of 0.6 (Fornell and Larcker,"

            "text": "From the point of view of previous experience with chatbot, more than 75% of the respondents have heard at least once about chatbots (M = 3.64, SD = 1.64) and around 70% have used this interaction at least on one occasion (M = 2.89, SD = 1.710). Table\u00a0 3 presents this information in a comparative manner between women and men and between middle-aged and aging adults emphasizing on the upper part of the used scale. In this respect, age has been transformed into a dummy variable ([40\u201350] and [51\u201378] intervals). Overall, men seem to have more experience with chatbots. However, when it comes to age, the differences between middle-aged and aging adults are not that significant. Paradoxically, and probably due to social desirability, although a large majority of the respondents declare that they like chatbots (M = 4.12, SD = 2.006), only a small part of them have increased knowledge on them (M = 3.19, SD = 1.598).\nAs presented in Figure\u00a03, the situations in which chatbots have been used regularly (Lou and Remus, 2014) are related to customer services and online shopping. These chatbots are similar in functionality and interaction and they are only tailored made for those domains. Furthermore, when it comes to benefits (State of Chatbot Report, 2018), as the Figure\u00a04 shows, the respondents strongly appreciate chatbots mainly due to their availability (e.g., 24 h a day) and capabilities to solve problems (e.g., quick answers, register complains, simplify the communication process).\nTo better understand if there is an interaction between gender and age on the intentional behavior to use chatbots, a Two-way ANOVA analysis has been performed. The table below (Table\u00a04) summarizes the descriptive statistics.\nThe test of between-subjects effect shows no significant difference in mean behavioral intention between males and female [F(1, 231) = 0.191, p = 0.662] and between middle-aged and aging adults [F(1,231) = 0.62, p = 0.804].\nTable\u00a0 5 presents the correlation matrix between the main variables of the study. The most powerful relationships are going to be\u00a0highlighted in the following rows. While perceived ease of use is strongly, positively, and significantly correlated with perceived usefulness, competence, and pressure, the perceived usefulness is strongly linked with enjoyment, pressure, and\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nsatisfaction. Finally, the more one likes chatbots, perceive them as being useful, enjoy them, and feel satisfaction while using them, the higher is the intention to use chatbots in the future. It is important to notice that gender is significantly correlated only with hearing on chatbots, using them, and have knowledge on them, men being more prone to that. However, the relationship is a weak one. Age is significantly and negatively correlated with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, effort, and pressure. Although the relationships are weak, further analyses should investigate more if middle-aged adults are perceiving chatbots as being easier to use and more useful, and if they indeed invest less effort and feel less pressure when using chatbots.\nA structural model assessment has been used to test the initial hypothesized relationships. The model-fit measurements have been used to evaluate the overall goodness of fit. In this respect, the following table (Table\u00a06) summarizes the main indicators for the model and the standard values for a good fit. The standard values for a good fit are documented from Schumacker and Lomax (2004), Schreiber et\u00a0 al. (2006), and Shi et\u00a0 al. (2019).\nOverall, the data show that these indicators respect the recommended values for an acceptable fit. Thus, no modifications to the model have been done.\nThe study assesses the impact of different independent variables related to chatbots used on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention. The following table (Table\u00a07) summarizes the results.\nThe impact of enjoyment, satisfaction, and pressure on perceived ease of use of a chatbot are not significant (p > 0.05). Thus, hypotheses H1a, H1b, and H1e are not supported. However, the data show that effort (\u03b2 = \u22120.138, t = \u22123.197, p = 0.001), competence (\u03b2 = 0.569, t = 9.923, p < 0.001), and perceived external control (\u03b2 = 0.124, t = 2.710, p = 0.007) impact the perceived ease of use chatbots in a significant manner. Hence, H1c, H1d, and H1f are supported.\nPerceived usefulness is positively and significantly impacted by both perceived ease of use (\u03b2 = 0.951, t = 9.541, p < 0.001) and subjective norms (\u03b2 = 0.806, t = 4.434, p < 0.001). Thus, H2a and H2b are supported by the data.\nTABLE\u00a03 A comparative summary on the previous experience with chatbots.\nExperience with chatbots GENDER AGE\nWomen Men Middle-aged adults Aging adults\nHeard about chatbots (Frequently and very\nfrequently)\n28.7% (n\u00a0= 40) 45.8% (n\u00a0= 44) 38.5% (n\u00a0= 52) 32% (n\u00a0= 32)\nUsed chatbots (Frequently and very\nfrequently)\n14.4% (n\u00a0= 20) 25% (n\u00a0= 24) 17.8% (n\u00a0= 24) 20% (n\u00a0= 20)\nHave knowledge on chatbots (Much and\nvery much)\n12.9% (n\u00a0= 18) 30.2% (n\u00a0= 29) 19.2% (n\u00a0= 26) 21% (n\u00a0= 21)\nLike chatbots (Much and very much) 43.8% (n\u00a0= 61) 52.2% (n\u00a0= 50) 47.4% (n\u00a0= 64) 47% (n\u00a0= 47)\nFIGURE\u00a03 The use of chatbots for certain activities.\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nBehavioral intention to use a chatbot is not significantly impacted by perceived ease of use, age, gender, or the previous experience with the interaction (knowledge on chatbot, hearing of chatbot, use of chatbots, or like chatbots). Hence, hypotheses H3b, H3d, H3e, H3f, H3g, H4a, and H4b are not supported. However, perceived usefulness (\u03b2 = 0.113, t = 7.397, p < 0.001) of a chatbot and subjective norms (\u03b2 = 0.255, t = 3.581, p < 0.001) are positively and significantly impacting the behavioral intention of using this interaction in the future. Consequently, H3a and H3c are supported.\nThe square multiple correlation is R2 = 0.644 for perceived ease of use. It means that 64% of the variance in the perceived ease of use is accounted by enjoyment, satisfaction, effort, competence, pressure, and perception of external control (however, only effort, competence, and perceived external control being significant). For the perceived usefulness, the square multiple correlation is R2 = 0.142, which means that 14% of the variance in the perceived usefulness is explained by\nperceived ease of use and subjective norms. Finally, for the behavioral intention, the square multiple correlation is R2 = 0.571. It means that 57% of the variance in the behavioral intention of using a chatbot is significantly accounted by perceived usefulness and subjective norms (perceived ease of use, age, gender, and experience variables not being significantly linked with behavioral intention).\nThe results of the structural model are summarized in the conceptual schema below (Figure\u00a05)."

Since the existing literature on chatbots is mostly written in the computer science domain and/or with a strong focus on healthcare and assistive perspective, one of the original contributions of this paper resides in assessing the general view, not domain-specific, on chatbots later in life and from a social science standpoint. Moreover, since most devices and applications are designed by young specialists, the aging adults\u2019 inputs are mandatory.\nStarting from the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the need for digital solutions is emphasized (Valtolina and Marchionna, 2021). However, as older individuals are more reluctant to technology than youngsters (Edison and Geissler, 2003), investigating perception on technology later in life is paramount, not only thinking about the need for smart healthcare, but also considering daily routine activities, as paying a bill or shopping online.\nFIGURE\u00a04 The perception of the benefits of chatbots.\nTABLE\u00a04 The descriptive statistics for Two-way ANOVA [the dependent variable is Behavioral intention (BI)].\nGender Age Mean SD N\nFeminine 40\u201350 3.9713 1.7017 87\n51\u201378 4.125 1.8816 52\nTotal 4.0288 1.7659 139\nMasculine 40\u201350 4.2865 1.6348 48\n51\u201378 4.0156 1.7979 48\nTotal 4.151 1.7146 96\nTotal 40\u201350 4.0833 1.679 135\n51\u201378 4.0725 1.8334 100\nTotal 4.0787 1.7425 235\nIan cu an d Ian cu\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fp syg .2 0 2 2 .11110 0 3\nFro n tie rs in P sych o lo g y\n13 fro n tie rsin .o rg\nTABLE\u00a05 Correlation matrix.\nHC UC KC LKC PEOU PU ENJ COMP EFF PRS SA PEC SN BI Gender\nHC 1\nUC 0.577** 1\nKC 0.480** 0.497** 1\nLKC 0.096 0.280** 0.281** 1\nPEOU 0.313** 0.370* 0.310** 0.423** 1\nPU 0.216** 0.396** 0.228** 0.584** 0.782** 1\nENJ 0.141* 0.338** 0.192** 0.686** 0.496** 0.725** 1\nCOMP 0.291** 0.370** 0.383** 0.497** 0.765** 0.653** 0.598** 1\nEFF \u22120.037 \u22120.039 \u22120.092 0.002 \u22120.216** \u22120.164* 0.096 \u22120.077 1\nPRS 0.309** 0.371** 0.334** 0.476** 0.664** 0.608** 0.485** 0.657** \u22120.372** 1\nSA 0.163* 0.330** 0.179** 0.615** 0.547** 0.781** 0.783** 0.605** 0.000 0.538* 1\nPEC 0.415** 0.439** 0.419** 0.265** 0.528** 0.432** 0.303** 538** \u22120.101 0.454** 0.343** 1\nSN 0.058 0.129* 0.001 0.225** 0.184** 0.363** 0.400** 0.202** 0.189** 0.055 0.407** 0.314** 1\nBI 0.249** 0.395** 0.243** 0.609** 0.519** 0.771** 0.728** 0.584** 0.024 0.477** 0.823** 0.432** 0.418** 1\nGender 0.146* 0.183** 0.206** 0.091 0.070 \u22120.005 \u22120.013 0.037 0.077 0.037 \u22120.029 0.117 0.041 0.036 1\nAge \u22120.161* \u22120.073 \u22120.112 \u22120.084 \u22120.209** \u22120.158* \u22120.071 \u22120.116 0.185** \u22120.208** \u22120.120 \u22120.103 0.089 \u22120.056 0.115\n**Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level; *Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level.

A structural model has been used for hypotheses testing. The first assumption of the paper (H1) is introducing a wide range of variables as possible explanations for the perceived ease of use of chatbots. Chatbots are perceived as easy to use if the effort implied is low and if the users feel competent for this type of interaction. However, contrary to expectations, enjoyment, satisfaction, or pressure, although significantly correlated to perceived ease of use, are not directly influencing it. These results are contrasting a large set of findings on technology acceptance (Venkatesh, 2000; Zamora, 2017; Kim et\u00a0al., 2018). Possible explanations might be\u00a0 related to the limits of the\nsample (in terms of number or over-representation of certain socio-demographical features, i.e., education), to the lack of knowledge on chatbots, or to a poor exposure to this type of technology. Thus, associating chatbots with different degrees of enjoyment, satisfaction, or pressure might be\u00a0accomplished only after an adjustment time frame and an increased experience. Consequently, further investigation is needed on the way aging population perceive the ease of use of chatbots, a topic that is scarcely studied.\nThe second assumption (H2) of the paper implies that perceived usefulness of chatbots is predicted by the perceived ease of use of this technology and by the subjective norms. Data show that this hypothesis is supported. Thus, middle-aged and aging users consider that chatbots are useful mainly if they find them easy to be\u00a0used, is people around them consider they should use this interaction, and if they are helped into this process.

This assumption is based on the results of Venkatesh and Davis (2000), Lin et\u00a0al. (2007), Renaud and Ramsay (2007), or Venkatesh and Bala (2008). The data show that, although there are significant correlations between all these variables, behavioral intention is only explained by the perceived usefulness of chatbots and by the subjective norms. In this respect, later in life, a more utilitarian perspective of technology and the role of peers seem to be\u00a0more important.\nFinally, the last hypothesis (H4) refers to the role of age and gender on the way further intentions to use chatbots are perceived. The data show that there are no relations between the way women or men, and middle-aged or aging adults are perceiving intentional behavior to use chatbots. This lack of difference seems to be\u00a0acknowledged by Modahl (1999) that concludes that, mainly when it comes to internet use, the role of age and gender is reduced. In terms of age, the results can be\u00a0explained by the low age average (M = 51.13) and by the fact that people above 60 years old are under-represented (8.2%) within the sample.\nAs studies on chatbots and aging adults are few and are mainly investigating reactions in the healthcare domain, this research is one of the first attempts to better understand the way chatbots in a not domain-specific context are perceived later in life. However, as some of the results are contradicting the existing theoretical models that explain technology acceptance, further inquiries are needed. One of the limits of the present paper is the small sample size and the convenience sampling method. Convenience samples are valuable for assessing attitudes and identifying new possible hypotheses that need further rigorous investigation (Galloway, 2005). In this respect, larger targets and a more in-depth approach should be\u00a0investigated.\nConsidering that age alone is not a socio-demographic sufficient variable to explain technology use (Loos, 2012), one important limit of the paper refers to the fact that aging adults that have rural residence, are less educated, and have low income are underrepresented in this study. To have a generalization potential of the results, future investigations should consider a better representation of the population within the sample for all the important socio-demographical variables. Likewise, as older people are not that comfortable with online questionnaires (Kelfve et\u00a0al., 2022), doubled by a large range of statements investigated, the method might have created bias and desirability. It is very likely that an experimental setting would better fit the issue of chatbot testing. At the same time, a future comparative approach between the way not domain-specific chatbots and domain specific ones are perceived becomes of great interest. Another limit of the paper refers to single country study. Emphasizing the case of Romania and its specific digital literacy characteristics, the data cannot be\u00a0generalized to any other socio-economic or cultural context. However, Romania, being ranked the last in digital skills among EU countries can serve as a valuable case-study for different techniques to overcome and improve the digital literacy gap. For a more comprehensive and global perspective, a comparative analysis with other countries is needed. Since assistive technologies are already largely used in developed countries, a best practice guide to reduce the economic and social gaps might be\u00a0of great value.\nThe present paper\u2019s contributions are twofold. On one hand, it is one of the first attempts to explore the middle-aged and aging adults\u2019 perceptions on chatbots in a non-healthcare context in Romania. Considering that technology is increasingly present in our daily routine, this type of investigation is of great use. Furthermore, some of the variables included in other studies analyzing technology perception in different setups seem not that important in the case of chatbots\u2019 use later in life and in the context of the least digitally educated country in EU. In this\nFIGURE\u00a05 Results of the structural model.\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nparticular case, a lower degree of effort, an increased feeling of competence, external control and subjective norms, and a high utilitarian role of technology seem to be\u00a0 utmost factors in chatbots\u2019 use. Finally, it is important to notice the inexistant differences at the age and gender levels. Thus, stereotypical perceptions should be\u00a0overcome.\nOn the other hand, the implications of the present investigation echo at the managerial and business level. As training might be\u00a0uncomfortable for aging individuals, developing chatbots that are intuitive and that do not need much preparation to be\u00a0used might be\u00a0a winning solution (Da Paix\u00e3o Pinto et\u00a0al., 2021). The practitioners that develop technological interactive systems should be\u00a0aware of the needs of the aging adults. Thus, the take aways imply designing useful technologies that do not require effort in use and that provide feelings of competence for the user."
