There is preliminary evidence that pandemic severity, cultural values,\nrestrictions imposed by governments, and Internet usage may all influence the\nemergence of PTSD symptomatology. In this study, possible linear- and non-linear\nassociations between these factors and the prevalence of PTSD symptoms across 35\ncountries were examined based on data from existing research. Evidence was found for a\npositive logarithmic relationship between the COVID-19 case-fatality ratio and PTSD (p=\n0.046), a positive logarithmic relationship between power distance and PTSD (p= 0.047),\nand a trend toward a negative quadratic association with Internet usage (p = 0.051).\nNo significant cross-national effect was observed for government restrictiveness. These\nfindings suggest that strategies aimed at minimizing COVID-19 deaths, and at ensuring\nequitable access to essential resources, may be of use in reducing the emergence of\nPTSD symptoms at a population level during this pandemic.\nKeywords: COVID-19, post-traumatic stress disorder, cultural collectivism, prevalence,mortality rate, case-fatality ratio, government stringency\nINTRODUCTION\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with emergent symptoms of psychological distress on an unprecedented scale (Zhang and Chen, 2021). Though some researchers have attempted to group these symptoms under the umbrella of a \u201cCOVID stress syndrome\u201d (Taylor, 2021; Taylor et al., 2021), most studies in this field have attempted to measure the frequency and severity of symptoms of \u201cclassical\u201d psychiatric syndromes, such as anxiety and depression, using standardized measurement tools (Nochaiwong et al., 2021). A recent global analysis estimated that 33% of individuals developed symptoms of anxiety, 28% symptoms of depression and 30% insomnia related to the pandemic (Liu et al., 2021), suggesting that up to one-third of individuals may have experienced significant psychological distress over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOne particular form of psychological distress that has attracted significant attention during the pandemic is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a complex syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal, occurring after exposure to a traumatic event which was associated with feelings of helplessness or fear (Friedman et al., 2011). A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is defined as one that involves actual or threatened death or injury, or a threat to physical integrity, directed at the self or at others (Bryant, 2019). Exposure to such events has been common and widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic (Dutheil et al., 2021). According to the most recently published meta-analysis at the time of writing, the estimated prevalence of significant PTSD symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic is 17.5%. However, this estimate included studies of general population samples as well as groups perceived to be at a higher risk of PTSD, such as survivors of severe COVID-19 and healthcare or other frontline workers (Yunitri et al., 2022).\nCertain factors have been found to predict the development of symptoms of PTSD during the pandemic. These include demographic factors such as age, geographical location and employment (e.g., nursing staff or other healthcare workers), and methodological factors such as the choice of instrument used to screen for PTSD or the specific group being studied (e.g., patients with COVID-19, staff working in COVID-19 units); however, the differences that could be attributed to these factors were modest (C\u00e9nat et al., 2021; Yunitri et al., 2022). However, certain other factors that were found to contribute to psychological distress during the pandemic have not been specifically studied in the context of PTSD. These include the local severity of the pandemic (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators., 2021), the severity of restrictions on human mobility (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), and the prevailing cultural values in a given country, particularly the cultural dimension of individualism vs. collectivism (Shekriladze et al., 2021; Xiao, 2021).\nThough these factors have not been fully studied in relation to PTSD during the pandemic, there is translational and empirical evidence of their relevance. For example, quarantine or isolation has been found to contribute to PTSD during earlier outbreaks of infectious disease (Reynolds et al., 2008; Henssler et al., 2021); forced quarantine may be more traumatic than voluntary quarantine (TMGH-Global COVID-19 Collaborative., 2021); emergent PTSD has been noted at higher rates in regions with a higher COVID-19 incidence rate (Carmassi et al., 2022); and sudden death of a loved one due to COVID-19, or enforced separation from them prior to death due to infection control measures, can contribute to traumatic grief (Masiero et al., 2020; Djelantik et al., 2021). It has also been observed that cultural values such as collectivism shape the appraisal of trauma and influence both the emergence and persistence of PTSD symptoms (Jobson, 2009). Culture can also influence the level of social support provided to those exposed to pandemic-related traumatic stress (Messner, 2021), and this can protect against the emergence of post-traumatic stress (Gentry et al., 2022). Finally, several dimensions of culture are associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and this might exert an indirect\neffect on PTSD through the traumatic effects of quarantine, hospitalization, or bereavement (Chen and Biswas, 2022; Duarte et al., 2022).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also been characterized by high rates of online and social media usage, amplified by restrictions on in-person social contact. There is some evidence of a link between higher social media usage and PTSD symptomatology. This may be due to the \u201csensitizing\u201d effect of repeated exposure to pandemic-related images and stories on vulnerable individuals exposed to pandemic-related traumatic stressors (Ikizer et al., 2021; Price et al., 2022).\nIn the light of the above findings, the current study attempted to examine the relative contributions of COVID-19 severity indicators, the stringency of governmental responses to the pandemic, the national level of cultural collectivism, and national Internet usage on cross-national variations in the prevalence of significant symptoms of PTSD."

However, a comprehensive review of literature revealed that though there were studies published in 2021 and 2022, most of these either: (a) reported data from 2020, (b) did not provide a percentage of the number of individuals who screened positive, or (c) were focused on specific high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers, individuals hospitalized for severe COVID-19, or people with a pre-existing mental illness.

Though these measures have certain inherent limitations due to variations in testing, reporting and death certification practices, they have been widely used to quantify the severity of the pandemic at a cross-national level (Favas et al., 2022). Information on these variables was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s global COVID-19 data aggregator.

A positive GCI indicates a collectivist culture (the highest being Somalia, with a GCI of 1.92), while a negative GCI indicates a more individualist culture (the lowest being Monaco, with a GCI of\u22121.85).

These dimensions were power distance, masculinity-femininity and uncertainty avoidance. Power distance reflects the extent to which a society follows a strict hierarchy and accepts inequalities; this parameter was associated with adherence to government restrictions (Messner, 2021) and reduced numbers of hospital or ICU admissions (Duarte et al., 2022). Masculinity-femininity measures the extent to which a society is oriented toward achievement, assertiveness and competition, as opposed to cooperation and nurturing; high masculinity scores are associated with the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths at a national level (Chen and Biswas, 2022). Uncertainty avoidance indicates the extent to which a society is able to tolerate ambiguous or uncertain situations, with high scores indicating lower tolerance; high uncertainty avoidance is also associated with increased COVID-19 prevalence and mortality (Chen and Biswas, 2022). Therefore, these three cultural dimensions were also included in the analysis. Data on these variables was obtained from the Hofstede Insights database (Hofstede Insights, 2022)."

For the purpose of this study, the estimated GSI for the time at which each individual study was conducted was included in this analysis.

To assess the effect of the screening tool used, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out, followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni test, to examine whether PTSD symptom prevalence differed significantly across studies using different tools.\nIn the second step, bivariate correlations between PTSD-Prev and the independent variables of interest were examined using Pearson\u2019s and Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses. Both methods were used in parallel in view of the possible non-normal distribution of the aforementioned variables. Finally, attempts were made to test for non-linear relationships between PTSDPrev and the independent variables using the curve estimation function for logarithmic and quadratic models if the visual inspection of scatter plots suggested such a relationship, and/or if the monotonic model suggested a trend toward an association. These plots are provided in the Supplementary Material. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a significance level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. In view of the exploratory nature of this study and its small sample size, correction for multiple comparisons was not undertaken."

There was a significant effect of the choice of study instrument on PTSD-Prev (F = 3.4, p = 0.021). On post-hoc analysis, the only significant inter-instrument difference noted was between studies using the ITQ and studies using the SPAN or SPTSS (p = 0.028, Bonferroni post-hoc test), with a similar trend between the ITQ and PCL-5 (p = 0.087, Bonferroni post-hoc test). No significant difference could be identified between any of the other instruments. From this analysis, it was evident that only the ITQ appeared to significantly influence variations in PTSD symptom estimates. To account for this, subsequent analyses were conducted both with the entire sample (n = 35) and after excluding studies which had used the ITQ (n= 32)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the focus of intense debate and research. While some researchers have warned of a \u201csecond pandemic\u201d of PTSD in the wake of the damage caused by this pandemic (Dutheil et al., 2021), others have highlighted the heterogeneity of psychological responses to COVID-19, as evidenced by both cross-national variations in the prevalence of psychological distress (Shevlin et al., 2021) and the phenomena of post-traumatic growth and resilience which mitigate against the persistence of PTSD symptoms (Killgore et al., 2020; Gonda and Tarazi, 2022). The current study suggests that the \u201cheterogeneity\u201d view may be closer to reality than the \u201ctsunami\u201d view, as a wide range of reported rates of PTSD symptoms was observed across the studies analyzed in this paper. However, even the lowest reported rate included in this study (11.5%) is comparable to the estimate of 17-18% reported inmeta-analyses, suggesting that a significant minority of the general population experiences PTSD symptoms in response to the pandemic. There is insufficient evidence to comment on what proportion of these individuals will continue to experience chronic PTSD; past evidence (Mak et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2020) suggests that these symptoms may diminish or resolve over time in some cases, while current studies have yielded equivocal results (Benfante et al., 2022; Kalaitzaki et al., 2022).\nIn this study, we identified a possible association between the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and the COVID-19 casefatality ratio. This finding is significant in the light of the debate surrounding the nature of traumatic stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some authors have argued for a rigorous definition which would include only severe events (involving personal or occupational exposure to death or the risk of death) as \u201ctraumatic stress\u201d, others have suggested considering \u201cpandemic exposure\u201d, or events such as being placed in quarantine or subjected to movement restrictions, as traumatic events per se (Norrholm et al., 2021). This debate is an extension of ongoing discussions of whether the spectrum of \u201ctraumatic events\u201d is being unduly broadened (Jones, 2021). The current results, though subject to certain important limitations, suggest that the \u201cnarrower\u201d definition of traumatic stress may be accurate, as the case-fatality ratio is a reflection of the risk of death in an infected individual, as opposed to measures such as prevalence (which includes mild and asymptomatic cases).\nAmong cultural dimensions, power distance showed a tentative positive association with the prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Societies with high power distance are characterized by institutionalized inequality. In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, unequal distribution of healthcare and other resources may have contributed to traumatic stress in the general population. Power distance was associated with an increased COVID-19 case fatality ratio in this study, which could have contributed to traumatic grief. It is possible that other\nFrontiers in Sociology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 7 | Article 881928\nsociocultural factors, which were not analyzed in this study may also influence the emergence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (Ohta et al., 2021). It is also possible that these factors exert a greater influence on other forms of psychological distress, such as depression and anxiety, than on PTSD.\nThough a negative association between Internet usage and PTSD symptoms was observed in this analysis, this finding was just below the threshold for statistical significance. While certain aspects of Internet usage, such as consumption of pandemicrelated media (\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d) have been associated with PTSD (Price et al., 2022), the Internet may also be used for social connection, communication of vital information, purchase of essentials and even healthcare (\u201ctelemedicine\u201d) during periods of confinement or isolation (Farsi et al., 2022). The role of the Internet in shaping positive or negative psychological responses to COVID-19 is complex, and requires further elucidation along multiple vectors in diverse populations.\nAs discussed earlier, the planned comparison of studies from 2020, 2021 and 2022 could not be carried out due to the low number of studies sampling subjects in 2021 and 2022. In a study of four countries (Germany, Israel, Poland and Slovenia), both government stringency and the percentage of subjects \u201cat risk\u201d of PTSD fell by around 5% between February and June 2021; however, the authors did not test for a significant association between these variables (Benatov et al., 2022). In contrast, a study of the Italian general population found a non-significant increase in PTSD symptomatology fromApril 2020 (19%) to January 2021 (21%); no specific demographic variables were associated with changes in PTSD symptoms at the individual level (Benfante et al., 2022). In contrast, a study from Greece comparing the frequency of PTSD symptoms during two successive lockdowns (March\u2013May 2020 and November 2020\u2013May 2021) found a significant increase in symptoms (36% vs. 26%) during the second lockdown (Kalaitzaki et al., 2022). The variability of these results highlights the need for further multi-country longitudinal research in this field, with an analysis of both individual and broader social and cultural factors.\nThis study is subject to certain important limitations. It is based on data derived from various studies, and this may lead to variations due to methodological factors, despite the efforts made to address these in the current study. It is largely derived from data obtained during the first \u201cwave\u201d of the COVID-19 pandemic, and these findings may not generalize to PTSD emerging at a later stage of this pandemic. It is cross-sectional and correlational in nature, meaning that no firm conclusions regarding causality can be drawn. It is based on data from a limited number of countries, meaning that information from certain geographical areas, such as subSaharan Africa and Oceania, was not available. Though certain significant findings were obtained, these require replication and\nmay not survive more rigorous forms of statistical correction. As they were based on national-level data, these findings are not directly applicable to individuals. Other factors that may significantly influence the emergence of pandemic-related PTSD, such as prior physical and mental health status, or increases in intimate partner violence, could not be assessed (Thibaut and van Wijngaarden-Cremers, 2020). The dependence of the study findings on published data imply that they are sensitive to publication bias. No correction was made for multiple comparisons in the correlation analyses, raising the possibility of false-positive findings. Finally, as this study was based on a secondary analysis of earlier research, it could not be registered in a database of prospective observational, interventional or meta-analytic studies."

            "text": "Despite the above limitations, this study suggests that significant relationship may exist between the COVID-19 case fatality rate and the emergence of PTSD symptoms in the context of the pandemic. Provisional evidence of a positive association with cultural power distance and a negative association with Internet usage were also observed. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving COVID-19 survival (such as high-risk prevention strategies and prompt treatment of severely ill patients) may foster resilience and reduce the emergence of PTSD at the level of the general population. It is also possible that attempts to ensure equitable access to essential resources may also reduce this risk in societies with high levels of inequality (Condon et al., 2020), but this recommendation should be considered tentative."
