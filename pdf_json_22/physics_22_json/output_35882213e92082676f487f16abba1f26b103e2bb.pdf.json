    "abstractText": "Abstract. We introduce and solve the non-commutative version of the Hermite\u2013Pad\u00e9 type I approximation problem. Its solution, expressed by quasideterminants, leads in a natural way to a subclass of solutions of the non-commutative Hirota (discrete Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili) system and of its linear problem. We also prove integrability of the constrained system, which in the simplest case is the non-commutative discrete-time Toda lattice equation known from the theory of non-commutative Pad\u00e9 approximants and matrix orthogonal polynomials.",

We also prove integrability of the constrained system, which in the simplest case is the non-commutative discrete-time Toda lattice equation known from the theory of non-commutative Pade\u0301 approximants and matrix orthogonal polynomials.\n1. Introduction\nHermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximation technique, originally introduced by Hermite to prove transcendency of Euler\u2019s constant [32, 33], has attracted recently considerable attention in mathematical physics due to close connection to multiply orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, diffusion models or various combinatorial problems [4, 9, 38, 11, 5, 53]. An important ingredient behind the success of these theories was the integrability of resulting equations [2, 6, 3, 8, 27, 42, 44, 46, 52]. Recently a direct link between the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants and integrability has been found [24] in terms of the corresponding reduction of Hirota\u2019s discrete Kadomtsev\u2013Peviashvili (KP) system, which in the simplest case of the Pade\u0301 rational approximation gives the discrete-time Toda lattice equations. Actually, it turned out that the relevant difference equations were known in the numerical algorithms community [50, 15] including their special solutions in terms of certain determinants.\nHirota\u2019s discrete KP system plays a special role within the theory of integrable equations and their applications. As it was shown by Miwa [47], it encodes the full KP hierarchy [13] of integrable partial differential equations. It is well known, see for example reviews [39, 54], that majority of the known integrable systems can be obtained as its reductions. Moreover, the most important techniques used to find solutions of integrable equations can be applied to the Hirota system in their pure forms (the finite gap algebro-geometric method [10] in [36, 51], the non-local \u2202\u0304-dressing method [1, 35] in [17], the Darboux transform [45] in [48]). It has simple geometric meaning in terms of geometric configurations [17], and its multidimensional consistency is encoded in the (fundamental to projective geometry) Desargues configuration. The symmetry structure of the equations is described by affine Weyl groups of A-type [18].\nIn the present paper we transfer the basic elements of the connection between the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants and integrability to the non-commutative level. Searching for non-commutative generalizations is well motivated by physics, but also by theoretical computer science and combinatorics. An important technical tool used in in such transition is provided by quasideterminants [28, 29, 37], which in a sense replace the standard determinants (better to say their ratios) in the non-commutative linear algebra. In fact, the fundamental properties of the non-commutative Pade\u0301 approximants [25], including also their connection to non-commutative/matrix orthogonal polynomials [26], can be formulated in terms of quasideterminants [30] see also [46, 52, 8, 41, 23]. We follow this idea in replacing by quasideterminants the ratios of determinants in the corresponding formulas of [24], where the link between the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants and integrability has been established in the commutative case.\nThe fully non-commutative Hirota system (originally called the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system) was proposed in [49] where the corresponding Darboux transform was given as well in terms of quasideterminants, see also [40]. The class of solutions proposed below is of different nature. The reduction of the non-commutative Hirota system given in the present work differs also substantially from the known\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 39A60, 41A21, 15A15, 37N30, 37K60, 65Q30, 42C05.

Other application of the quasideterminants to non-commutative discrete integrable systems can be found in [16, 20].\nThe structure of paper is as follows. In Section 2 we first present the relevant information on the noncommutative Hirota system, and then we recall basic properties of quasideterminants. Section 3 is devoted to formulation of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximation problem and to presentation of its solution in terms of quasideterminants. We also establish there a link with the non-commutative Hirota system and its linear problem. Then in Section 4 we show that the relevant solutions of the system satisfy an additional integrable constraint. We also give arguments why the reduced system can be called non-commutative multidimensional Toda system. At the end of the paper we summarize its results, present open questions and future research directions.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. The non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system. Consider the following linear problem [14, 49]\n\u03c8(n\u2212 ei)\u2212\u03c8(n\u2212 ej) = \u03c8(n)Uij(n), 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 N, (2.1)\nwhere Uij : Z N \u2192 D are functions defined on N -dimensional integer lattice, N \u2265 3, with values in a division ring D, and the wave function \u03c8 : ZN \u2192 V(D) takes values in a right vector space over D; here n = (n1, . . . , nN ) = \u2211N i=1 niei \u2208 Z N , and ei is the element of the standard basis in Z\nN lattice. The compatibility conditions of (2.1) consist of equations\nUij(n) + Uji(n) = 0, Uij(n) + Ujk(n) + Uki(n) = 0,\nUij(n)Uik(n\u2212 ej) =Uik(n)Uij(n\u2212 ek), i, j, k distinct, (2.2)\ncalled in [49] non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system. From the last part of compatibility conditions one can deduce existence of the potentials \u03c1j : ZN \u2192 D such that\nUij(n) = \u2212\u03c1 i(n)\n[ \u03c1i(n\u2212 ej) ]\u22121 , (2.3)\nwhich are given up to arbitrary functions of single variables. Apart from the constraint\n\u03c1j(n) [ \u03c1j(n\u2212 ei) ]\u22121 + \u03c1i(n) [ \u03c1i(n\u2212 ej) ]\u22121 = 0, (2.4)\nwhich is the first part out of the system (2.2), the second part gives\n\u03c1i(n) [ \u03c1i(n\u2212 ej) ]\u22121 + \u03c1j(n) [ \u03c1j(n\u2212 ek) ]\u22121 + \u03c1k(n) [ \u03c1k(n\u2212 ei) ]\u22121 = 0. (2.5)\nRemark. For commutative D it is possible to introduce the single potential function \u03c4(n) such that\nUij(n) = \u03c4(n)\u03c4(n \u2212 ei \u2212 ej)\n\u03c4(n\u2212 ei)\u03c4(n \u2212 ej) , i < j. (2.6)\nThen the remaining (second) part of the system (2.2) reduces to Hirota\u2019s discrete KP equation [34, 47]\n\u03c4(n\u2212 ei)\u03c4(n \u2212 ej \u2212 ek)\u2212 \u03c4(n \u2212 ej)\u03c4(n \u2212 ei \u2212 ek) + \u03c4(n\u2212 ek)\u03c4(n\u2212 ei \u2212 ej) = 0, (2.7)\nwhere 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 N .\nRemark. In order to adjust to results of Section 3, instead of the original formulation of the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system and of its linear problem we use their dual (called also adjoint) versions [31, 40]. The original linear problem [49] is obtained by replacing the shifts into negative directions by positive direction shifts.\n2.2. Quasideterminants. In this Section we recall, following [28], the definition and basic properties of quasideterminants.\nDefinition 2.1. Given square matrix X = (xij)i,j=1,...,n with formal entries xij . In the free division ring [12] generated by the set {xij}i,j=1,...,n consider the formal inverse matrix Y = X \u22121 = (yij)i,j=1,...,n\nto X . The (i, j)th quasideterminant |X |ij of X is the inverse (yji) \u22121 of the (j, i)th element of Y , and is often written explicitly as\n|X |ij =\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 x11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x1j \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x1n ... ... ... xi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xij \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xin ... ... ...\nxn1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xnj \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xnn\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 . (2.8)\nQuasideterminants can be computed using the following recurrence relation. For n \u2265 2 let X ij be the square matrix obtained from X by deleting the ith row and the jth column (with index i/j skipped from the row/column enumeration), then\n|X |ij = xij \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2032 6=i j\u2032 6=j\nxij\u2032 |X ij |\u22121i\u2032j\u2032xi\u2032j (2.9)\nprovided all terms in the right-hand side are defined.\nRemark. When the elements of the matrix X commute between themselves, what we denote by placing the letter c over the equality sign, then the familiar matrix inversion formula gives\n|X |ij c = (\u22121)i+j\ndetX\ndetX ij . (2.10)\nExample 2.1. Quasideterminants of generic 2\u00d7 2 matrix\nX =\n(\nx11 x12 x21 x22\n)\nread as follows\n|X |11 = x11 \u2212 x12x \u22121 22 x21, |X |12 = x12 \u2212 x11x \u22121 21 x22, |X |21 = x21 \u2212 x22x \u22121 12 x11, |X |22 = x22 \u2212 x21x \u22121 11 x12.\nLet us collect basic properties of the quasideterminants which will be used in the sequel; see also [37].\n2.2.1. Row and column operations.\n\u2022 The quasideterminant |X |ij does not depend on permutations of rows and columns in the matrix X that do not involve the ith row and the jth column. \u2022 Let the matrix X\u0303 be obtained from the matrix X by multiplying the kth row by the element \u03bb of the division ring from the left, then\n|X\u0303|ij =\n{\n\u03bb|X |ij if i = k, |X |ij if i 6= k and \u03bb is invertible. (2.11)\n\u2022 Let the matrix X\u0302 be obtained from the matrix X by multiplying the kth column by the element \u00b5 of the division ring from the right, then\n|X\u0302 |ij =\n{\n|X |ik \u00b5 if j = k, |X |ij if j 6= k and \u00b5 is invertible. (2.12)\n\u2022 Let the matrix X\u0303 be constructed by adding to some row of the matrix X its kth row multiplied by a scalar \u03bb from the left, then\n|X |ij = |X\u0303|ij , i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, k + 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , n. (2.13)\n\u2022 Let the matrix X\u0302 be constructed by addition to some column of the matrix X its lth column multiplied by a scalar \u00b5 from the right, then\n|X |ij = |X\u0302|ij , i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , l\u2212 1, l + 1, . . . , n. (2.14)\n2.2.2. Homological relations.\n\u2022 Row homological relations:\n\u2212 |X |ij \u00b7 |X ik|\u22121sj = |X |ik \u00b7 |X ij |\u22121sk , s 6= i. (2.15)\n\u2022 Column homological relations:\n\u2212 |Xkj |\u22121is \u00b7 |X |ij = |X ij |\u22121ks \u00b7 |X |kj , s 6= j. (2.16)\n2.2.3. Sylvester\u2019s identity. Let X0 = (xij), i, j = 1, . . . , k, be a submatrix of X that is invertible. For p, q = k + 1, . . . , n set\ncpq =\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nx1q\nX0 ... xkq\nxp1 . . . xpk xpq\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 ,\nand consider the (n\u2212 k)\u00d7 (n\u2212 k) matrix C = (cpq), p, q = k + 1, . . . , n. Then for i, j = k + 1, . . . , n,\n|X |ij = |C|ij . (2.17)\nIn applications the Sylvester identity is usually used in conjunction with row/column permutations.\n3. Non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants\n3.1. Formulation of the problem. Consider m formal series (f1(x), . . . , fm(x)) in variable x with non-commuting coefficients\nfi(x) =\n\u221e \u2211\nj=0\nf ijx j , (3.1)\nwhere the parameter x commutes with all the coefficients. Given n = (n1, . . . , nm) element of Z m \u2265\u22121, we write also |n| = n1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + nm. A Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 form of degree n is, by definition, every system of polynomials (Y1(x), . . . , Ym(x)), not all equal to zero, with corresponding degrees deg Yi(x) \u2264 ni, i = 1, . . . ,m (degree of the zero polynomial equals \u22121), and such that\nf1(x)Y1(x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ fm(x)Ym(x) = x |n|+m\u22121\u0393(x) (3.2)\nfor a series \u0393(x) = \u2211\u221e j=0 \u0393 jxj .\nRemark. In our paper we consider only the so called type I approximants. For closely reated type II and mixed type approximants in the commutative case see, for example [43].\n3.2. Solution of the problem. The degree conditions and equation (3.2) lead to a system of |n|+m\u22121 linear equations with |n|+m unknown coefficients of the polynomials. Define matrixM(n) of (|n|+m\u22121) rows and (|n|+m) columns\nM(n) =\n\n       \nf10 0 f m 0 0 f11 . . . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fm1\n. . . ... f10\n... fm0 ... ... \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ...\n... f1|n|+m\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 f 1 |n|+m\u2212n1\u22122 fm|n|+m\u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 f m |n|+m\u2212nm\u22122\n\n        ; (3.3)\nits columns are divided into m groups, the ith group is composed out of ni + 1 columns depending on fi(x) only. Supplement the matrix M(n) by the line\n(\nf1|n|+m\u22121, f 1 |n|+m\u22122, . . . , f 1 |n|+m\u2212n1\u22121 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fm|n|+m\u22121, . . . , f m |n|+m\u2212nm\u22121\n)\n, (3.4)\nas the last row, and define \u03c1i(n) as the quasideterminant of such extended matrix, with respect to the element in the last row and the last column of the ith block.\nProposition 3.1. By the row homological relations (2.15) the functions \u03c1j, j = 1, . . . ,m, when exist, satisfy equations\n\u03c1i(n)[\u03c1i(n\u2212 ej)] \u22121 = \u2212\u03c1j(n)[\u03c1j(n\u2212 ei)] \u22121, i 6= j.\nOne can observe that the above system is identical with equations (2.4) of the theory of the nonAbelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system; we keep therefore the same notation. Moreover we are going to show how other elements of the theory can be obtained from the data of the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants.\nSupplement the matrix M(n) at the bottom by the line\nXk = (0, . . . , 0, . . . . . . , 1, x, . . . , x nk , . . . . . . , 0, . . . , 0), (3.5)\nconsisting of zeros except for the kth block of the form 1, x, . . . , xnk . Define Z (i) k (n, x) as the quasideterminant of such matrix with respect to the element in the last row and the last column of the ith block.\nProposition 3.2. When it exists, Z (i) k (n, x) is a polynomial in x of degree not greater than nk. In particular, Z (k) k (n, x) is monic.\nProof. By the elementary row operations and the recurrence (2.9) one can decompose Z (i) k (n, x) into the sum of quasideterminants multiplied by subsequent powers of the parameter x. The highest order term of Z (k) k (x, n) can be easily calculated using equation (2.9).\nProposition 3.3. The product\n\u03c8k(n, x) = Z (i) k (n, x)[\u03c1 i(n)]\u22121, i, k = 1, . . . ,m, (3.6)\nis independent of the index i. This allows to find the leading term of the polynomials\nZ (i) k (n, x) =[\u03c1 k(n)]\u22121\u03c1i(n)xnk + lower order terms, i, k = 1, . . . ,m, (3.7)\n\u03c8k(n, x) =[\u03c1 k(n)]\u22121xnk + lower order terms, k = 1, . . . ,m. (3.8)\nProof. By combining the row homological relations\nZ (i) k (n, x)[\u03c1 i(n\u2212 ej)] \u22121 = \u2212Z (j) k (n, x)[\u03c1 j(n\u2212 ei)] \u22121, i 6= j, k = 1, . . . ,m, (3.9)\nwith analogous relations (3.1) we obtain the first part of the statement. The second part follows from Proposition 3.2.\nLet us present the role of the polynomials \u03c8k(n, x) within the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximation theory.\nProposition 3.4. The polynomials (\u03c81(n, x), . . . , \u03c8m(n, x)) provide solution of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem with the following asymptotic\nf1(x)\u03c81(n, x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ fm(x)\u03c8m(n, x) = x |n|+m\u22121 + higher order terms. (3.10)\nProof. Supplement the matrix M(n) at the bottom by the line\n(f1(x), xf1(x), . . . , x n1f1(x), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fm(x), xfm(x), . . . , x nmfm(x)) ,\nand calculate the quasi-determinant QDi of the resulting square matrix with respect to the element in the last row and in the last column of the ith block. The direct calculation, by decomposition of the last row into blocks in equation (2.9), gives\nQDi = f1(t)Z (i) 1 (n, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ fm(t)Z (i) m (n, t).\nFrom the other hand, the row operations allow to remove from the last row terms of the order lower than |n|+m\u2212 1 in the parameter x, what implies\nQDi = x |n|+m\u22121\u03c1i(n) + higher order terms.\nThen equation (3.10) follows from definition (3.6).\nCorollary 3.5. Equivalently, (Z (i) 1 (n, x), . . . , Z (i) m (n, x)) where i = 1, . . . ,m, are also solutions of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem with asymptotics\nf1(x)Z (i) 1 (n, x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ fm(x)Z (i) m (n, x) = x |n|+m\u22121\u03c1i(n) + higher order terms.

Finally, we show the relation of the above solution of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem with the non-commutative Hirota system.\nProposition 3.6. The polynomials \u03c8k(n, x), k = 1, . . . ,m, satisfy the linear problem of the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system\n\u03c8k(n\u2212 ei, x)\u2212 \u03c8k(n\u2212 ej , x) = \u03c8k(n, x)\u03c1 j(n)[\u03c1j(n\u2212 ei)] \u22121, i 6= j. (3.12)\nProof. Let us apply the Sylvester identity for matrix M(n) supplemented by Xk, with respect to last two rows and the last columns of the ith and jth blocks, where i < j. The corresponding 2 \u00d7 2 matrix reads\n(\n\u03c1i(n\u2212 ej) \u03c1 j(n\u2212 ei)\nZ (i) k (n\u2212 ej) Z (j) k (n\u2212 ei)\n)\n,\nand the quasideterminant of the big matrix with respect to the element in the last row and the last column of the jth block equals then\nZ (j) k (n, x) = Z (j) k (n\u2212 ei, x)\u2212 Z (i) k (n\u2212 ej, x)[\u03c1 i(n\u2212 ej)] \u22121\u03c1j(n\u2212 ei). (3.13)\nMultiplication of the above equation by [\u03c1j(n \u2212 ei) \u22121] from the right gives the statement for such an ordering of indices. The homological relations (3.1) prove the statement for j < i.\nRemark. To avoid degenerations we usually assume that for all n \u2208 Zm\u22650 the potentials \u03c1 i(n) do not vanish. Such a system of series (f1, . . . , fm) is called perfect, in analogy to the commutative case [43]. Then, by properties of the quasideterminants [29] for each n the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem has a solution defined uniquely up to a constant factor with maximal degrees of the polynomials. In such a case there is an alternative way to derive the linear problem (3.12). The system of polynomials defined on the left hand side of (3.12) provides the solution of the Hermite\u2013Pad\u2019e problem for n, thus by the non-degeneracy condition must be proportional to the system \u03c8k(n, x). The coefficient is fixed by examining the highest order term of k = jth polynomial on both sides and Proposition 3.3.\nCorollary 3.7. By examining the highest order term of kth polynomial, k 6= i, j, on both sides of the linear problem (3.12) and using the homological relations (3.1) we obtain that the potentials \u03c1i satisfy the second part (2.5) of the non-commutative Hirota equations.\n3.4. Comparison with the commutative case. To close this Section let us show the link with the commutative case [24].

(3.16)\nMoreover, then\n\u03c8k(n, x) c = Zk(n, x)\n\u03c4(n) (3.17)\nsatisfies the standard adjoint linear problem of the Hirota discrete KP system (2.7). Correspondingly, the polynomials Zk(n, x) satisfy the so called bilinear form of the adjoint linear problem\nZk(n, x)\u03c4(n \u2212 ei \u2212 ej) = Zk(n\u2212 ei, x)\u03c4(n \u2212 ej)\u2212 Zk(n\u2212 ej, x)\u03c4(n \u2212 ei), 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m. (3.18)\n4. The \u201dmultidimensional\u201d non-commutative discrete-time Toda equation\n4.1. The non-commutative version of the Paszkowski constraint. In the commutative case the polynomials Zk(n, x) in addition to equations (3.18) satisfy the constraint [50]\nxZk(n, x)\u03c4(n) = Zk(n+ e1, x)\u03c4(n \u2212 e1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Zk(n+ em, x)\u03c4(n \u2212 em), (4.1)\nwhich supplements Hirota\u2019s discrete KP system with the additional equation\n[\u03c4(n)]2 = \u03c4(n+ e1)\u03c4(n \u2212 e1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c4(n+ em)\u03c4(n\u2212 em). (4.2)\nOur goal in this Section will be to give the non-commutative version of the above.\nTheorem 4.1. Under the non-degeneracy assumption the polynomials \u03c8(n, x) = (\u03c81(n, x), . . . , \u03c8m(n, x)), which provide solution of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem, satisfy also the constraint\nx\u03c8(n, x) = \u03c8(n+ e1, x)\u03c1 1(n+ e1)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ em, x)\u03c1 m(n+ em)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121, (4.3)\nand the quasideterminants \u03c1j(n) satisfy the following equation\n1 = \u03c11(n+ e1)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c1m(n+ em)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121. (4.4)\nProof. The system of m polynomials (the components of the vector)\nx\u03c8(n, x)\u2212\u03c8(n+ e1, x)\u03c1 1(n+ e1)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ em\u22121, x)\u03c1 m\u22121(n+ em\u22121)[\u03c1 m\u22121(n)]\u22121\nforms a solution of the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem with the same degrees as the system \u03c8(n+ em, x), thus both systems must be proportional. The coefficient can be found by examining the highest order term of the mth polynomial. Equation (4.4) follows from comparison of the leading order terms of both sides of (4.3) in the equation (3.10).\nRemark. In the simplest case m = 2 we are left with the system\n1 = \u03c11(n+ e1)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 + \u03c12(n+ e2)[\u03c1 2(n)]\u22121, (4.5)\n\u03c11(n)[\u03c1i(n\u2212 e2)] \u22121 = \u2212\u03c12(n)[\u03c12(n\u2212 e2)] \u22121. (4.6)\nElimination of \u03c11(n) gives the non-commutative discrete Toda chain equation of the non-commutative Pade\u0301 theory [23]\n\u03c12(n+ e1) ( [\u03c12(n\u2212 e2)] \u22121 \u2212 [\u03c12(n)]\u22121 ) \u03c12(n\u2212 e1) = \u03c1 2(n+ e2)\u2212 \u03c1 2(n). (4.7)\nA similar equation, connected to the above by the homological relations, was obtained recently within the theory of matrix orthogonal polynomials [41].\nRemark. In the commutative case the Hirota system (2.7) supplemented by the constraint (4.1) coincides, up to simple change of the independent discrete variables, with the \u201dmultidimensional discrete-time Toda lattice\u201d obtained in [7] within the theory of multiple orthogonal polynomials. Although the system of equations involves arbitrary number (but not less then two) of discrete variables, its initial-boundary data depend on functions of single variables [24]; for the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem they are the m sequences of the series coefficients. This shows that effectively the reduced system is two-dimensional.\nRemark. The identity (4.3) satisfied by the solutions of the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem was obtained under the non-degeneracy assumption. In the commutative case it was possible to derive [24] the constraint (4.1) using standard properties of determinants; see also [9] for analogous direct proof of the identity (4.2). It seems possible that also in the non-commutative case equation (4.3) can be shown using more advanced quasideterminantal identities [37] without that additional assumption.\n4.2. Integrability of the constraint. Let us leave the context of the Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants, which give only special solutions to the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system. Their speciality is not only because of the constraint (4.4), but also because the solutions are defined for nk \u2265 \u22121, k = 1, . . . ,m. We will study what impact on the solutions of the system has the additional constraint (4.3) on the level of the linear problem (2.1). We will not be bounded to any special region of Zm.\nTheorem 4.2. The compatibility condition of the linear system (2.1) with the additional equation (4.3) is the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system (2.4)-(2.5) supplemented by the constraint\n\u03c11(n+ e1, x)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c1m(n+ em, x)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121 = 1\u2212 F (|n|), (4.8)\nwhere F : Z \u2192 D is a function of single variable |n| = n1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ nm.\nProof. We need to prove only the last part of the statement. Define\nC(n) = 1\u2212 \u03c11(n+ e1, x)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 \u03c1m(n+ em, x)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121,\nand use directly the linear equations (2.1) and (4.3) to obtain\n\u03c8(n+ e1, x)C(n) = \u03c8(n+ e1, x)\u2212 x\u03c8(n, x) +\u03c8(n+ e1 + e2, x)\u03c1 2(n+ e1 + e2)[\u03c1 2(n)]\u22121+\n\u03c8(n+ e1 + e3, x)\u03c1 3(n+ e1 + e3)[\u03c1 3(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ e1 + em, x)\u03c1 m(n+ e1 + em)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121.\nShift the above equation back in the e1 direction and subtract the analogous equation with distinguished second variable\n\u03c8(n+ e2, x)C(n) = \u03c8(n+ e2, x)\u2212 x\u03c8(n, x) +\u03c8(n+ e1 + e2, x)\u03c1 1(n+ e1 + e2)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121+\n\u03c8(n+ e2 + e3, x)\u03c1 3(n+ e2 + e3)[\u03c1 3(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ e2 + em, x)\u03c1 m(n+ e2 + em)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121,\nshifted back in the e2 direction, what gives\n\u03c8(n, x)[C(n\u2212 e1)\u2212C(n\u2212 e2)] = \u2212x[\u03c8(n\u2212 e1, x)\u2212\u03c8(n\u2212 e2, x)]+\n\u03c8(n+ e2, x)\u03c1 2(n+ e2)[\u03c1 2(n\u2212 e1)] \u22121 \u2212\u03c8(n+ e1, x)\u03c1 1(n+ e1)[\u03c1 1(n\u2212 e2)] \u22121+\n\u03c8(n+ e3, x)\u03c1 3(n+ e3)\n(\n[\u03c13(n\u2212 e1)] \u22121 \u2212 \u03c1 3(n\u2212 e2)]\n\u22121 )\n+ . . .\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ em, x)\u03c1 m(n+ em)\n(\n[\u03c1m(n\u2212 e1)] \u22121 \u2212 \u03c1 m(n\u2212 e2)]\n\u22121 )\n.\nUsing once again the linear equations (2.1) but also the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa system (2.4)-(2.5) we obtain\n\u03c8(n, x)[C(n \u2212 e1)\u2212 C(n\u2212 e2)]\u03c1 2(n\u2212 e1)[\u03c1 2(n)]\u22121 =\n\u2212x\u03c8(n, x) +\u03c8(n+ e1, x)\u03c1 1(n+ e1, x)[\u03c1 1(n)]\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03c8(n+ em, x)\u03c1 m(n+ em, x)[\u03c1 m(n)]\u22121 = 0.\nDoing that for any pair of indices we get finally\nC(n\u2212 ei) = C(n\u2212 ej), i, j = 1, . . . ,m,\nwhat implies that the function C(n) = F (|n|) depends only on the sum of all the variables.\nRemark. When values of F commute with all potentials \u03c1i and in the allowed range of k we have F (k) 6= 1, then one can remove the function from the non-linear equations (including the non-Abelian Hirota\u2013Miwa part (2.4)-(2.5)) by the transformation\n\u03c1j(n) = \u03c1\u0303j(n)G(|n|), (4.9)\nwhere G(k) = \u220fk\ni=1(1\u2212 F (k \u2212 i)).\n5. Conclusion and open problems\nWe presented the concept of the non-commutative Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 problem and we gave its solution in terms of quasideterminants. In our research we were guided by the corresponding results of the classical commutative problem and its relation to the Hirota system with the Paszkowski constraint.\nThe theory of non-commutative Pade\u0301 approximants has close connection with the theory of matrix orthogonal polynomials, and the theory of Hermite\u2013Pade\u0301 approximants has close connection with the theory of multiple orthogonal polynomials. Thus the results presented in the paper provide a link between (non-existing yet) theory of matrix multiple orthogonal polynomials with integrability.\nThe non-commutative Hirota system provides a way [21] to construct certain maps satisfying Zamolodchikov\u2019s tetrahedron condition [55], which is a multidimensional generalization of the more familiar Yang\u2013Baxter maps. The new class of solutions of the system, obtained in the present paper, can be used, in principle, to produce large family of the corresponding Zamolodchikov maps.\nReferences\n[1] M. J.
