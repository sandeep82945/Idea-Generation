    "abstractText": "Paper-based microfluidic systems have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for developing point-of-care diagnostic platforms (POCT) for detecting and monitoring various diseases. Saliva is a non-invasive biofluid easily collected, transported, and stored. Due to its accessibility and connection to systemic diseases, saliva is one of the best candidates for medical advancement at the point of care, where people can easily monitor their health. However, saliva is a complex mixture of DNA, RNA, proteins, exosomes, and electrolytes. Thus, nucleic acid separation from the salivary components is essential for PCR applications. Paper membranes are a highly porous and foldable structure capable of transporting fluids without pumps and sophisticated systems. The current work presents an insight into simulations for nucleic acid extraction on three types of porous paper membranes for use in point-of-care devices. The flow fluid model is solved on a COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 free version platform, and the results are compared with experimental assays. The results show that pore uniformity, wet strength, porosity, and functional groups of MF1TM and Fusion 5TM paper membranes are vital parameters affecting nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification efficiency.",

            "text": "The necessity to quickly identify nucleic acids for disease diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries has led to the development of low-cost POCT systems. The POCT promises to perform diagnostic tests outside the laboratory with rapid and reliable results [1]. In diagnostic applications, nucleic acid-based analysis has many advantages such as sensitivity, specificity, rapid results, and flexibility [2]. However, carrying out nucleic acid amplification and detection is not an easy task. Concerning this, developing a rapid method, equipment-free, and straightforward nucleic acid extraction is a precise process, which is traditionally time-consuming and requires trained technicians and multiple steps. [3]. Thus, to realize a POCT diagnostic tool, the extraction, amplification, and detection steps should be integrated [4]. Paper membranes emerged while searching for a low-cost, portable, biocompatible, and easy-to-modify material for fabricating diagnostic devices [5]. These membranes have exhibited good nucleic acid extraction and detection at POCT. Moreover, these have easy use and storage. However, it is necessary to choose the paper adequately based on its physical and chemical properties, considering the specific POCT applications. Similarly, liquid biopsy allows for the detection, analysis, and identification of different diseases in body effluents such as blood, urine, sputum, bronchial fluid, and saliva. This latter element has many advantages of being used as a biofluid. As it represents a noninvasive procedure, its collection is fast, inexpensive, and too easy. The saliva is called \u201cthe mirror of the body\u201d because it reflects the health\u2013disease general state of the body. Saliva allows the identification of DNA, RNA, proteins, exosomes, electrolytes, etc. [6]. However, saliva use, like liquid biopsy in clinics and POCT devices, requires more standardization in collection and evaluation procedures.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2238. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13122238 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2238 2 of 13\nConsequently, this study compared the performance of three common paper-based materials for nucleic acid extraction from saliva samples.

The selection of paper substrate depended on various characteristics such as capillary flow time (the time required for a liquid sample to flow through the pores in the lateral direction), the thickness of the paper, pore size, porosity (% of air present in porous structure), and surface quality (Table 1)."

This equation assumes that fluids are non-Newtonians and that capillary channels all have the same radii. Saliva displacement depends on porous systems\u2019 microstructure, interface tension, fluid property, and fluid\u2212solid interactions. When saliva is in contact with the paper, the interactions between the solid\u2013liquid interfaces spread the saliva into the porous substrate, called the wet-out process. Finally, the fluid front is wicking along with the dry porous media in its movement. The equation is as follows:\nl(t) = 2\u00b7 \u221a\nK\u03b3cos\u03b8 \u03d5\u00b5r\u03b1 \u00b7 \u221a t (1)\nwhere l(t) represents the fluid length traveled in the paper after the time (t), and k is permeability, understood as a measure of flow that occurs through a substrate. This process depends upon pore size and geometry; \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity, and t is the liquid penetration time. Moreover, Darcy\u2019s law was also used to simulate the saliva flow behavior through a porous membrane using the distribution of the porous media properties (porosity, permeability, and saturation), in which the pressure gradient is the major driving force, and the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2238 3 of 13\nporosity of membranes is very small. The equation describes a linear relationship between the velocity field \u00b5 (m/s) and the gradient of the pressure p (Pa):\nq = \u2212 k \u00b5 \u2207p (2)\nwhere q = instantaneous flow rate, k = permeability, and \u00b5 = the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and = pressure drop, respectively. This work considers a rectangular porous paper strip length L, uniform width w, and thickness h. ra is the average pore radius of the paper. When a small amount of liquid is dropped onto the paper substrate, three types of interfacial layers are formed due to surface tension, i.e., solid\u2013liquid interface, liquid\u2013vapor interface, and vapor\u2013solid interface. The fluid movement is influenced mainly by the physical and geometrical properties of porous media, such as the physical and rheological properties of saliva. Thus, COMSOL Multiphysics software couples the Multiphase Flow in Porous Media, with Darcy\u2019s law and Phase Transport in Porous Media interfaces. The Phase Transport in Porous Media interface follows separate equations for the volume fraction (Si), these depend on whether there is a wetting or no wetting fluid i:\n\u2202 \u2202t ( \u03b5p \u03c1isi ) +\u2207.

Experimental Method 2.4.1. Paper Membranes\nAs described above, the three Whatman\u00ae qualitative membranes used were e: CF4 (100% cotton linter), MF1\u2122 paper (bound glass fiber), and Fusion 5\u2122 (patent membrane) and were purchased from Cytiva. Each paper was cut into 0.5 \u00d7 6 cm strips. The physics and geometric characteristics are described above (Table 1).\n2.4.2. Sample and Paper Preparation\nThe unstimulated (US) and stimulated saliva (SS) samples used in this work were collected into sterile 15 mL tubes from healthy volunteers. These samples were used immediately (as fresh samples). It was mixed with blue food color (1:1) to facilitate the displacement observation. Additionally, a 10 \u00b5L lysis buffer was deposited onto the strips using a micropipette. Then, the lysis buffer was dried on the paper; each membrane strip was placed on a horizontal surface.\n2.4.3. Paper-Based Nucleic Acid and Protein Extraction and Quantification\nThis system consisted of a porous membrane in contact with a 100 \u00b5L saliva sample in 0.5 mL RNA/DNA-free tubes used as a reservoir. The flow distance using a conventional rule and timer was measured. The wicking into the membrane occurred via capillary action for times t > 0 (20, 40, 60, 120, 180, and 240 s), and the liquid\u2013air interface within the porous membrane migrates toward dry regions. The process is described in Figure 1, steps 1 to 3. Subsequently, for the evaluation of nucleic acid and protein extraction from saliva, 1 cm of each membrane at different times was cut and transferred to 0.5 mL tubes for the elution step.

However, several challenges in processing saliva are well-known since it is a non-Newtonian fluid with variations in sample viscosity and composition between stimulated and unstimulated saliva [11]. Although many substrates can capture nucleic acids, low-cost membranes can rapidly purify nucleic acids from crude saliva samples and elute them directly into the amplification mix or lateral flow assay without using micropipettes. The method described in this study takes advantage of the membrane pore size properties, SS saliva viscosity, and differences between nucleic acids and other compounds concerning their capture and retention kinetics by membranes. Additionally, the saliva flow process through porous membranes is essential to purify nucleic acids. The goal of the fluid flowing through the membrane is to remove interferents, producing a solution containing a DNA/RNA target [12]. Here, we first simulated the wicking phenomenon of the saliva in porous membranes and observed the capillary flow in paper strips of three materials. Due to wettability, the porous surface wets and helps the saliva wick through the porous membranes. The wicking of saliva occurs spontaneously in porous media, without extra energy due to the inherent capillary action [13].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2238 12 of 13\nAlthough paper membranes consist of randomly deposited materials with different porosities, the L\u2013W model considers paper bundles of interconnected capillary tubes. However, a deviation with experimental results was observed because the paper strips used (CF4, Fusion5, and MF1) did not consist of bundles of capillary tubes [14]. MF1\u2122 and Fusion 5\u2122 exhibited asymmetric porous structures, whereas that of CF4\u2122 was symmetrical; this porosity distribution is directly related to the particle retention capabilities of the paper and flow velocity. One exciting approach was combining porous media properties with the L\u2013W model, considering Darcy\u2019s law, where fluid transport occurs along with the wetted porous media [15]. Different flow speeds can be used in LFAs devices, depending on the requirements for sample volume, assay time, specificity, and sensitivity [16]. In porous membranes, capturing sizeable nucleic acid molecules depends on pore size (Figure 8), whereas other, more minor compounds are rapidly released with fluid movement through the paper. Furthermore, the volume absorbed by membranes, the amount of nucleic acid available in saliva samples for capture, and the interaction with paper substrates influence the extraction. In addition, surface chemistry properties affect fluid behavior in membranes and can help the adsorption capacity of nucleic acid. In this sense, it was observed that paper-based glass fiber composed of SiO2 (MF1 and Fusion 5) could capture NA negatively charged by positively charged silica [16]. Previously, the wet strength of glass-fiber-based materials has been described as higher than that of cotton-based materials [17]. The results illustrated that the MF1 and Fusion 5 membranes\u2019 extraction performance was highest, compared with that of other paper-based materials. In contrast, the CF4 membrane could not extract DNA from the whole saliva. The all-around performance (i.e., cost, time, operation step, extraction efficiency, and sample volume) of silica membrane was highest compared with that of other paper-based materials described by other authors for extracting nucleic acid from whole saliva [18]. Emerging \u201cpoint-of-care testing\u201d (POCT) has played an essential role in early disease detection, diagnosis, and maintenance. These have been widely accepted as economical and alternative diagnostic tool tests, especially when access is difficult. An essential feature of paper-based POCT devices is that they must be rapid and robust [19]. However, there are several challenges to be solved to develop future POCT diagnostic devices, including (1) improving speeding nucleic acid extraction and purification within minutes and (2) better POCT methods for extracting nucleic acid for biological fluids [20]. Ideal paper-based materials for POCT applications should have characteristics that allow easy use. These include high efficiency in purifying nucleic acids from samples and the low adsorption of non-specific substances [21]. In relation to this topic, through comparing membrane features, we concluded that Fusion 5 and MF1 had better results, given that DNA concentration was not too high, compared with CF4 results. Knowing the concentration is essential because it can inhibit PCR and obtain false-negative results."

            "text": "Our study revealed that 6 cm of paper could purify nucleic acids away from inhibitors. A significant advantage of the method presented here is that the amount of nucleic acid transferred to the amplification reaction would be similar between samples of the same type because the size of the DNA binding surface remained constant. The theoretical simulation of fluid flow in porous media and experimental validation can significantly contribute to the development of paper-based diagnostic devices to study various diseases, both infectious and tumors.\nAuthor Contributions: Each author made substantial contributions as is describing next: A.F.-B.: Conception and design of the work; the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data, and prepared and wrote the manuscript.
