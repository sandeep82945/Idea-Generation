"In future work, this can be resolved by adding a feature selection step that could reduce the number of features before training a final model." 

"In the future, we would like to explore reducing the features used for BOW-PF and TF-IDF-PF. One idea is to use BOW applied to the features as a sentence. Train using a tree model and use feature importance to reduce the vocabulary. Then apply the reduced vocabulary BOW transform to each feature separately."
