    "abstractText": "A novel series of ligustrazine derivatives was designed, synthesized and evaluated as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In vitro studies displayed that some of the synthesized compounds revealed promising AChE and BuChE inhibitory effects. Particularly, compounds E12 and E27, indicated highly AChE inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 1.85 \u03bcM and 0.98 \u03bcM, respectively and showed noteworthy protective effects against on glutamate-induced SH-SY5Y cells damage at 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM concentrations. Furthermore, molecular simulation docking elucidates compounds E12 and E27 interacting with residues in the binding site of AChE (PDB code: 4EY7) and BuChE (PDB code: 1P0I), emphasizing the protein residues that participate in the main interactions with the two targets. Taken together, these results revealed that compounds E12 and E27 might be potential lead compounds for further structure optimization in the drug-discovery process against AD.",

The progress of the reaction was checked by TLC and analyzed with 254 nm and 365 nm UV light. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Varian Gemini 2000 (400 or 600 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 using TMS as an internal standard. Mass spectra (MS) were performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC-6520 QTOF. The optimal HPLC conditions as follows: Agilent HC-C18 column (4\u00d7250 mm), column temperature: 30\u2103. The mobile phase used was 0.2% formic acid water: MeOH 15:85(v/v) with flow rate at 0.8 mL/min and wavelength monitored at 254 nm.

After charge addition, hydrogenation and structure optimization of the receptor and ligand molecules, the system parameter values were set, and the interaction between the ligand molecules and the target was evaluated by using the total score function in molecular docking. The score values was performed on the docking results by using hydrogen bonding, van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction, etc. The docking results are shown in Table 3.

Considering the ligand small molecule (E27) as a multi-carbon ring backbone structure, Charmm36 force field with TIP3P water model was chosen for simulation. The system temperature was set to 37\u2103 for NaCl solution. During the MD simulations, all hydrogen bonds involved were constrained using the LINCS algorithm with an integration step of 2 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the (Particle-mesh Ewald) PME method with the cut-off value set to 1.2 nm. the non-bonded interaction cut-off value was set to 10 \u00c5 and updated every 10 steps. The protein-ligand complexes were first preequilibrated for 100 ps to optimize the initial conformation of the protein in the solvent. Afterwards, the complex and solvent systems are warmed to 310 K using a modified Berendsen temperature coupling algorithm for 100 ps of NVT equilibration with a coupling time constant of 0.1 ps. Subsequently, the solvent and complex systems are pressure equilibrated to 1 bar using a Berendsen constant pressure for 100 ps of NPT equilibration. Molecular dynamics simulations of 50 ns duration were performed to further investigate the binding of the ligand relative to the receptor. RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) analysis was performed to analyze the stability of the ligand with respect to the receptor during the simulation. The RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) demonstrates the structural adaptation of each residue of a protein, and is used in this study to analyze the flexibility and the intensity of movement of protein\namino acid residues throughout the simulation.\nAbbreviations: DCM, Dichloromethane; DMF, N, N-Dimethylformamide; DIEA, Diisopropylethylamine; DMAP, 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridin; EDCI, 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)- 3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; EA, Ethyl acetate; EtOAc, ethyl acetate; IC50, 50% inhibiting concentration; PE, Petroleum ether; TBSCl, t-Butyldimethylchlorosilane; TBAF, Tetrabutylammonium fluoride; TLC, Thin Layer chromatography; UV, Ultraviolet"
