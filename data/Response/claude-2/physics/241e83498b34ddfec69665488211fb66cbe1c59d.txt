 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings in this paper:

1. Test the biosensors with GSGSGS and other optimal linkers on real biological samples like exhaled breath from patients to evaluate their usefulness for disease diagnosis.

2. Explore modifying the linker length and composition further to optimize sensitivity and selectivity, for example testing longer glycine-serine linkers like GSGSGSGSG.

3. Investigate incorporating the optimized linkers into other peptide sequences and on other biosensor platforms beyond QCM to see if the enhanced performance holds more universally. 

4. Conduct more in-depth structural studies on how the linkers stabilize peptide structure and orientation on the sensor surface to guide further rational improvements.

5. Explore the use of machine learning approaches like neural networks on data from sensor arrays with linked peptides to improve selectivity and pattern recognition for disease diagnosis.
