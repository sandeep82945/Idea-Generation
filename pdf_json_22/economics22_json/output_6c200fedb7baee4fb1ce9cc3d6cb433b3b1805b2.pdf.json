    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented shock to firms with adverse consequences for existing productive capacities. At the same time, digitalization has increasingly been touted as a key pathway for mitigating economic losses from the pandemic, and we expect firms facing digital constraints to be less resilient to supply shocks. This paper uses firm-level data to investigate whether digitallyenabled firms have been able to mitigate economic losses arising from the pandemic better than digitallyconstrained firms in the Middle East and Central Asia region using a difference-in-differences approach. Controlling for demand conditions, we find that digitally-enabled firms faced a lower decline in sales by about 4 percentage points during the pandemic compared to digitally-constrained firms, suggesting that digitalization acted as a hedge during the pandemic. Against this backdrop, our results suggest that policymakers need to close the digital gap and accelerate firms\u2019 digital transformation. This will be essential for economies to bounce back from the pandemic, and build the foundations for future resilience. RECOMMENDED CITATION: Abidi, N., El-Herradi, M., and S.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented shock to the private sector with adverse consequences for existing productive capacities and potentially persistent e ects on growth prospects. At the same time, measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly a ected the rms\u2019 relationship with digital technologies. Teleworking and e-commerce, among others, have surged across countries. These internet-based and bandwidth-intensive activities have fueled demand for high-quality connectivity and lay bare existing digital divides between rms. While the Middle East and Central Asia region (ME&CA henceforth) made signi cant progress in closing the digital gap with the rest of the world over the 2005-2019 period (see Figure 1), xed-broad band penetration remains low (see Figure 2), and there are signi - cant heterogeneities of digital adoption across rms between countries and sectors (see Figures 3 and 4). As countries weather the pandemic, digital connectivity, more than ever, is essential to ensure that economic activities can continue in a remote manner. Beyond the immediate e ect of digitalization, rms also need to digitalize in order to respond to long-term changes. Consumers have been active in experimenting and adopting digital services during the pandemic, which is seen as an acceleration of the existing trend. Therefore, changes to consumer behavior are likely to stick, with people continuing their online purchase habits post-COVID-19 (Charm et al., 2020).\nIn this paper, we study the role of digitalization on the resilience of the corporate sector in the ME&CA region. Speci cally, we compare non- nancial corporations (NFCs) that are digitallyenabled, and thus have alternative channels for selling their products, to those that are more digitally-constrained, before and after 2020. Comparing two rms of the same size, age, productivity, industry, and country (i.e. that are facing the same demand conditions), we nd that rms that have not invested in digital technologies ex-ante were more adversely impacted by this unprecedented shock.\nIn response to the crisis, a growing body of literature has emerged on the impact of the pandemic on business activity. Most of these papers focus on rms either in individual countries (Dai et al., 2014 documents revenue loss, business closures and layo s in China; see also Acharya and Ste en, 2020 and Fairlie, 2020 for evidence in the United States) or advanced economies (for example, Demmou et al., 2021; Banerjee and Kharroubi, 2020, IMF, 2021a). There have been few systematic cross-country studies of the impact of the pandemic in developing countries. For example, Beck et al. (2020) use a sample of 500 rms across 10 developing countries and nd that most rms have limited layo s and payroll reductions by reducing investment. ApedoAmah et al. (2021) mobilize a sample of rms from 51 developing countries and document that\n2\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nthe COVID-19 shock has been severe on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with persistent negative impacts on sales.\nWhile this line of research provides a good description of how rms have responded to the crisis, it is important to extend this work and investigate how to make rms in developing countries more resilient.1 An economic crisis comes with huge economic and social costs such as rm exits, unemployment, and lower productivity. To reduce these costs, it is important to understand what makes rms, industries and countries more resilient, that is, what fosters their ability to resist to shocks and to recover quickly afterwards. Digitalization may be an important source of rms\u2019 resilience. There are di erent channels through which digitalization may a ect rm performance and resilience. An important link is innovation. It has been shown in the past that digitalization facilitates both product and process innovations as well as spurring (longer-term) productivity growth (Andrews et al., 2016; Cette et al., 2020; Gal et al., 2019). Speci cally, rms using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) may be able to cope with economic shocks more exibly through easier reorganization of their production processes. They can thus achieve higher levels of productivity and competitiveness, while rms lagging in the adoption of new technology face the risk of being driven out of the market. While early evidence is emerging on the mitigating role of IT adoption for the United States (see Pierri and Timmer, 2020), to the best of our knowledge, there is so far no cross-country study investigating and quantifying the impact of the pandemic and the role of digitization in developing countries, especially for the ME&CA region.\nOur paper is the rst to provide systematic evidence that digitalization mitigated the impact of the pandemic on rms revenues in the ME&CA region using a novel database. We construct a new dataset using several data sources. First, to obtain pre-pandemic rm-level information on business performance (for example, sales, number of employees) and digitalization, we use the last survey (2018-20) of the EBRD-EIB-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS). We combine the BEEPS with the ES COVID-19 Follow-up Enterprise Survey (ES COVID Survey) and the Business Pulse Survey (BPS) to obtain information on rmlevel business performance during the pandemic.2 The advantage of combining these surveys is to be able to evaluate rms\u2019 performance before and during the pandemic. Our rm-level data includes several proxies of digitalization such as usage of website, access to emails, and 1Resilience is a complex concept, which can be de ned, e.g. as the capacity of an economy to reduce vulnerabilities, to resist to shocks and to recover quickly (see Caldera-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2016). We use the term \u2018resilience\u2019 in a rather speci c and narrow way related to how digitalization mitigates the impact of economic shocks on rms\u2019 revenues. 2The World Bank has developed a brief rm survey to collect data measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unlisted rms across 48 countries. The questionnaire collects data across di erent dimensions: operations of the business, sales, labor adjustments, rms expectations and uncertainty about the future, public support etc. More details can be found on: https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/covid-19\n3\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nadoption of foreign technologies. We use additional rm-level characteristics such as access to credit, labor productivity, management practices, innovation, rm ownership and expectation on future pro ts to control for possible confounding factors. In addition, our dataset covers most sectors of the economy (manufacturing, wholesale and retail, hospitality and tourism, services, among others), 13 ME&CA countries with varying income levels (i.e. ranging from Morocco to Uzbekistan), and di erent levels of exposure to the COVID-19 shock.\nWe use a di erence-in-di erences approach to identify the e ect of digitalization on the rm revenues across ME&CA countries. We exploit the COVID-19 crisis as an exogenous supply shock that substantially reduced \u2013 due to lockdowns and social distancing measures to contain the virus \u2013 the ability of rms to sell their goods and services. To capture the multidimensional nature of digitalization, we construct a novel index on rm-level digitalization, which is based on several rm-level digital indicators. Digitally-enabled rms are expected to be less a ected by containment measures because they are able to maintain business operations via digital technologies (e.g., online sales) (Apedo-Amah et al., 2021). Thus, we use digitally-constrained rms as a control group and digitally-enabled rms as a treatment group. However, an important concern is that these rms may di er between each other in a variety of dimensions other than access to digital technologies, which can also a ect rm performance (i.e. for instance innovative capacity). Our paper attempts to address this limitation by controlling for a large set of rm (un)observed characteristics. We speci cally address three key issues. First, we look into the evolution of digitalization evolving in the MECA region and the characteristics of digitallyenabled and constrained rms in the MECA region. Second, once COVID hits, we investigate the evolution of sales growth and employment decisions of digitally-constrained rms di er from those that have invested (ex-ante) in digital technologies. Third, we re ect on the policymix that can enable rms to mitigate the potential costs of adopting digital technologies.\nThe results of our paper are the following: First, digitally-constrained rms in the ME&CA region are typically smaller, younger, and less productive. Therefore, they might also have been subject to di erent demand shocks, which would confound our analysis. To take this heterogeneity into account, all our analyses use a large set of rm-level control variables and country and industry xed e ects to control for unobserved time-invariant country characteristics as well as industry speci c shocks (e.g. demand shocks). Second, we nd that digitally-constrained rms in contact-intensive sectors experienced a larger decline in sales than the same companies in non-contact intensive sectors. Third, while the COVID-19 crisis had a negative impact on rms\u2019 performance, companies that have invested in digital technologies before the crisis were signi cantly less impacted. In particular, digitally-enabled rms experience a decline in their\n4\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nsales that is about 4 percentage points lower than that of digitally-constrained rms. Therefore, these rms have been more resilient in mitigating the pandemic shock. These ndings contribute to a better understanding of rms\u2019 performance during crises and the role of digital technologies as a mitigating factor.\nWe also conduct a battery of robustness checks. Speci cally, we use an alternative digital index in order to avoid measurement issues and check whether our results hold to di erent digital measures. We also control for access to credit, optimism, labor productivity, innovation, and ability to sell new products among other rm-level characteristics in order to control for confounding e ects. The results are the very similar, which lends further support to a causal interpretation of digitization as a key mitigating factor of the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 discusses some descriptive statistics of digitalization in the region. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy and section 5 presents the results. The last section concludes and presents policy recommendations to harness the digital potential of the region."

For our empirical analysis, we use the last BEEPS wave from 2018-20 in 13 economies of ME&CA region from non-agricultural and non nancial sectors (i.e. manufacturing, services, petroleum, etc.).3 The sample of countries and territories includes: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Egypt, Georgia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lebanon, Morocco, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, and West Bank and Gaza. The survey features information on rm characteristics (i.e. age, size), ownership details, sales, employees\u2019 training and skills levels, access to credit, infrastructure, competition, green governance, organizational and marketing innovation, and R&D spending. Most importantly for our study, the BEEPS contains information on digitalization (further details can be found in the Appendix).4 To the extent that most of the digital connectivity variables in the BEEPS have a large number of missing observations, we will use \"website\" 3Sampling weights are provided in the survey and ensure that the sample is representative of the non-agricultural private sector of the economy 4In the BEEPS, digital connectivity is assessed via the following questions: Whether or not the company has its own website? Whether or not rms use email to communicate with clients? Whether or not the rm has high speed internet on the premise? Whether or not this establishment use cell phone for operations? Whether or not the lack of ICT is an obstacle for current business operation? Digital adoption/di usion: Whether or not the company is using a technology from foreign-owned company?\n5\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nand \"foreign technology\" as baseline indicators to construct our digital index. Foreign technology is considered as a proxy of digitalization because it could signal (i) the existence of payment systems that might be integrated into a website and (ii) the degree of commitment of the rm to digital technologies.\nSecond, we complement the BEEPS with the ES COVID-19 Follow-up Enterprise Survey (ES COVID Survey) to understand the impact of the pandemic on business performance for several countries (i.e. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Jordan, Georgia, Lebanon and Morocco). Speci cally, rms report whether their sales have remained the same, increased or decreased, and by how much. We use this information to compute the level of rms sales in 2020.5 Then we merge the dataset from BEEPS and ES COVID Survey thanks to a common rm identi er and therefore obtain a comprehensive panel dataset including pre-COVID and post-COVID information on rm performance.\nFinally, to complement information on post-pandemic business performance (i.e. sales) for countries not covered in the ES COVID Survey, we use the Business Pulse Survey (BPS) implemented by the World Bank, which gathered rm-level information on 21 harmonized indicators about the impact on business operations during the pandemic. So far, indicators are only available at the country level.6 We calibrate rm-level revenues in 2020 by using two approaches: First, we use the variable from the BPS which asks the rm the average percentage change in monthly sales compared to 1 year before the interview. Second, we use the countryspeci c economic growth rate in 2020. Speci cally, we use the following expression to apply the estimated drop in sales:\nSalesDropi,c,t = \u03c9t \u2217 %\u2206Sc,t\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 A +(1 \u2212 \u03c9t) \u2217 gc,t\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 B\n(1)\nwhere SalesDropi,c,t refers to the estimated drop in sales applied for rm i, located in country c at time t. Given data availability for most of the rms in our sample, the haircuts are applied for a small subset of rms in 2020. Sc,t indicates the average percentage change in monthly sales compared to 1 year before the interview obtained from the BPS, and gc,t is the country-level growth rate retrieved from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO). In the baseline speci cation, the weight \u03c9t assigned to term A in expression 1 is 0.25, which means that it is assumed that the economy was at a standstill for a quarter of the year, i.e. three months drop in sales.

We cover 13 ME&CA countries with over 18,000 rm-level observations."

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the number of internet users across Africa, Europe, Asia & Paci c, the Americas, and the Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) region. MENA has made remarkable progress in the past in terms of internet usage. The share of individuals using the internet has risen quickly fast from only 8.3 percent in 2005 to 54.6 percent in 2019, ahead of Africa and the Asia-Paci c region. However, looking at other indicators such as xed-broadband subscriptions per capita (see Figure 2), internet usage is lagging behind other major regions. We also nd signi cant heterogeneities in digital adoption across rms between ME&CA countries and sectors (see Figures 3 and 4).\nGenerally, the share of rms across ME&CA countries having a website is higher than foreign technology adoption even though there seems to be a relationship between these two variables. The higher the share of rms with a website, the higher the likelihood of technology adoption. At the country-level, the share of rms with a website ranges between 30 and 65 percent. Jordan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Lebanon have the highest share of rms with a website (close to 60 percent of all rms). Exceptionally, rms in Jordan display a larger share of rms with foreign technology adoption than having a website (almost 80 percent). At the lower end, rms in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have the lowest share of rms with a website (just above 30 percent). Figure 4 depicts the share of rms with a website and foreign technology across industries. The manufacturing, wholesale and retail, other services, and machinery and electronics sector have the highest share of digitally connected rms; while rms operating in the metal sector have the lowest shares of rms with a website and foreign technology adoption.\nTable 1 establishes an initial relationship between digitalization and sales. It shows the di erence in the level of rms\u2019 sales in 2019 and 2020 for digitally-enabled and digitally-constrained rms. Both before and after the crisis, digitally-enabled rms have a higher average level of sales compared to digitally-constrained rms. While sales have dropped for both groups, the 7It is important to notice that the estimated drop in sales was also conducted backward, that is, for rms whose sales were only available in 2020.\n7\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\ndrop was relatively more important for digitally-constrained than digitally-enabled rms. Table 2 displays the main observable characteristics and di erence between digitally-enabled and digitally-constrained rms before the crisis: age, size, access to credit, ownership, expectations, and innovation. It suggests that digitally-enabled rms are, on average, older, larger, have a better access to credit, more likely to be foreign-owned, more optimistic regarding future sales, and more innovative than digitally-constrained rms. The t-test values depicted for each variable suggests that there is a signi cant di erence between the means of the two groups.\nThe main research question addressed in this paper is to analyze the di erentiated e ect of the COVID-19 shock on rms\u2019 performance, conditioning on their pre-pandemic digital preparedness. A preliminary way to look at this relationship consists in tracing out rms\u2019 sales in 2020 and 2019 for both the digitally-enabled and digitally-constrained groups. Figure 5 plots the sales (log) of rms in 2019 versus 2020 for both groups and shows that the number of rms witnessing a signi cant drop in sales are over-represented for the digitally-constrained group. If we consider, for instance, two rms \u2013 one digitally-enabled and another one that is digitally-constrained \u2013 whose (log) sales level in 2019 is at \"10\", we notice that the rm that has not invested in digital technologies experiences a larger decline in sales in 2020 compared to the digitally-enabled one (see also Figure A1 in the Appendix). This provides evidence that digitally-enabled companies seem to be more resilient than digitally-constrained companies. This question will be empirically investigated in our regression analysis."

            "text": "The key identi cation issue we face consists in separating supply (e.g. ability to serve consumers) from the demand conditions (e.g. ability to access internet) of the COVID-19 shock that hit the ME&CA region. In order to tackle this issue, we introduce a di erence-in-di erences speci cation and control for demand e ects (e.g., industry, country, age, size along other determinants of digitalization) in order to examine the sales of the digitally-enabled rms against those of digitally-constrained rms.\nOur main identi cation strategy consists in comparing ME&CA digitally enabled rms with those that were more digitally constrained (e.g. no use of websites, foreign technologies, etc.). The COVID-19 nancial crisis reduced the ability of rms to access their consumers and sell their goods and services, especially when containment measures were introduced. While those that have ex-ante invested in digital technologies maintained a certain ability to access their consumers, non-digitally enabled rms faced lower demand for their products. In our context, the key challenge is that rms in the digitally-enabled and digitally-constrained groups are dif-\n8\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nferent along many dimensions besides access to consumers (size, age, expectation, innovation, etc.). The aim of all our analysis is to tackle this challenge.\nIn order to control for ex-ante di erences between digitally-enabled and digitally-constrained rms, we use two types of xed e ects. First, country- xed e ects allow us to control for unobserved, time invariant country characteristics. Second, industry xed e ects allow for an adjustment of industry-speci c shocks that were caused by the crisis. Our baseline regression is as follows:\nYi,t = \u03b1+ \u03b21COV ID19t + \u03b22Digitali + \u03b23COV ID19t \u2217Digitali + \u0393Xi,t + FEs+ \u03b5i,t (2)\nwhere Yi,t is the logarithm of total sales of rm i at date t, COV ID19t is a time-dummy that captures the start of the COVID-19 (year 2020),Digitali is a rm-level dummy which equals one if the rm was digitally-enabled before the pandemic, and Xi,t is a vector of rm-level control variables (e.g., age, rm size). Since digitalization is a multidimensional process, it cannot be studied only through website and foreign technology. That is why we construct a digital index based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a dimensionality-reduction method that transforms our digital connectivity variables into an index that still contains most of the information. In all regressions, standard errors are clustered at the rm level to account for the panel structure of the data and allow for a correlation of the error within rms across years.\nThere is still a concern that digitally-enabled rms might not be a suitable counterfactual group, as they tend to be larger and more productive than the average ME&CA rm. We include different variables to control for such di erences. We pursue the analysis adjusting for a large set of possible confounding factors to make sure that the rms are comparable both in terms of their corporate structure and outcomes, including to innovation, access to credit, expectations, rm ownership, management practices and skill composition of workers. We also use an alternative digitalization index in order to assess the robustness of our results to di erent measures of digitalization and expand our de nition of resilience by using employment as an outcome variable (e.g., the number of full-time employed workers as the outcome variable) instead of rms sales. The joint e ect of digitalization and COVID-19 (i) across contact and non-contact intensive sectors (ii) excluding the estimated drop in sales are also investigated."

We also include industry and country-level xed e ects, which allow us to control for any other time invariant unobserved country and industry heterogeneities.\nFirst, we nd across all regressions that the COVID-19 crisis negatively a ected the sale performance of all rms. Second, digitalization is positively associated with rms\u2019 sales. Finally, and most importantly, comparing two rms of the same size, age, country, and industry that are facing the same demand conditions, digitally-enabled rms\u2019 experienced a decline in their sales that is about 4.4 percentage points lower than that of digitally-constrained rms. Adding industry and country-speci c xed e ects in column (9), the results remain similar to column (4), with digitally-enabled rms facing a lower decline in their sales in 2020 that amounts to 3.8%.\nWhile the baseline result displays correlation but not yet a causal relationship, it shows that the coe cient of our interaction term is not awed by some confounding factors. However, there may still be some unobserved factors a ecting the process of rms digitalization. Specifically, while the COVID-19 shock is exogenous to rms conditions, the fact that a rm decides to invest in digital technology is not an orthogonal process. Our aim here is to exploit the rich set of variables in our combined data-sets and control as much as possible for factors that simultaneously a ect rms sales and the decision to invest in digital technologies.\nIn order to do so, we proceed in the following steps: First, we introduce proxies of rm-level innovation. The idea behind such controls is that digitally-enabled rms can also be the most innovative since empirical evidence has shown that ICT adoption coincides with process and product innovation as well as increased human capital (Bartel et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2014). Innovation is constructed using dummy variables that take the value of one if the rm has introduced a new product over the last three years or reports any Research and Development (R&D) expenses during the last scal year. The results are reported in Tables 4 and 5 and con rm the previous results: digitally-enabled rms were more resilient to the COVID-19 shock than those that have not invested in digital technologies after controlling for innovation and R&D expenses. With respect to the coe cient estimates of the variables on innovation, the introduction of a new product by a rm is positively associated with higher sales, although this does not hold across all speci cations. Interestingly, we nd that the coe cient for R&D spending is higher than that for product innovation. 8The digital index is a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the rm has a website and uses a foreign technology.\n10\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nThe second set of control relates to the confounding e ect that access to credit can have on the digitalization process. As a matter of fact, one can conjecture that investing in digital technologies requires a non-negligible amount of capital that could be acquired mainly through access to credit markets. This holds especially for SMEs, which face severe barriers to adopt new digital technologies due to the di culty in accessing nance to make the necessary investments (EIB, 2019). In such a case, rms would only be digitalized because they have easier access to credit. To test this assumption, we estimate our empirical model and introduce a variable measuring whether the rm has a line of credit or loan from a nancial institution. Table 6 reports the results and con rms that the resilience of digitally-enabled rms to the COVID-19 shock is not driven by their potential access to credit markets. Furthermore, that factor is positively and signi cantly associated with rms\u2019 performance, regardless of the speci cation retained.\nAnother important factor in the decision to invest in digital technologies is expectations. If a rm has optimistic expectations in the medium term about the evolution of its total sales, it may have more incentives to increase investment and improve its production capacities. Table 7 presents the regression results, controlling for whether the rm expects its total sales to increase, decrease, or remain the same. The results do not depart from the baseline ndings: digitally-enabled rms experienced in 2020 a lower decline in sales than those that have not invested in digital technologies.\nAs discussed in the data section, our measure of digitalization considers that a rm is digitally enabled if it has a website alongside foreign technology. However, the adoption of foreign technology depends on several factors, including rm\u2019s ownership. As a case in point, foreignowned companies can experience an easier technology transfer, especially in the context of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) (see Newman et al., 2015, among others). To test whether the results are robust to a rm\u2019s ownership, we construct a dummy variable that equals one if the percentage owned by private foreign individuals, companies, or organizations is positive and zero otherwise. Table 8 shows that foreign ownership of a rm is associated with a higher level of total sales and also con rms that digitally-enabled rms were more resilient to the COVID-19 shock.\nIt should also be noted that digitalization is unlikely to produce positive e ects on business performance if the workforce does not have the appropriate skills. To test whether digitallyenabled rms\u2019 resilience to the COVID-19 shock is not driven by those who employ skilled workers, we mobilize two variables: (1) a dummy indicating whether the rm has introduced a formal training program for permanent, full-time employees in the last scal year and (2) the number of permanent full-time employees with a university degree at the end of the scal year.\n11\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nThe results are reported in Tables 9 and 10. Both variables are signi cantly associated with an increase in rms\u2019 sales and do not a ect the main nding on the resilience of digitally-enabled rms."

            "text": "We perform several sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of our results. First, we use an alternative principal component measure of digitalization based on the use of cellphones and emails to communicate with clients. Even though we have less observations for these proxies, the results continue to hold when we replicate the baseline estimations using this alternative indicator. These are shown in Table 11. The number of observations drops to 3,624 but the interaction term between digitalization and the COVID-19 dummy remains positive across all speci cations. The coe cient is, however, more sizeable: digitally-enabled rms experienced a lower decline of sales by about 9 percentage points compared to digitally-constrained rms.\nSecond, we study the impact of digitalization on economic resilience during the COVID-19 crisis across sectors. To this end, we focus particularly on contact and non-contact intensive sectors. The main assumption is that, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent lockdown measures, digitally-constrained rms operating in high contact-intensive sectors would have more di culty reaching their customers and would, as a result, experience a greater decline in sales. Table 12 presents the baseline results focusing on two high contact-intensive sectors: (1) wholesale and retail and (2) hospitality and tourism; while Table 13 shows the ndings for low contact intensive sectors (i.e. manufacturing, textiles and garments, chemicals, construction, petroleum, plastics and rubber, basic metals, machinery and electronics) and the use of the baseline digital index.9 The results unequivocally demonstrate that digitally-constrained rms in contact-intensive sectors experienced a greater decline in sales (-19%) than the same companies in non-contact intensive industries (-16%) but that digitalization helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic shock.\nThird, we approach economic resilience through employment. Particularly, we use the number of full-time workers as the outcome variable and estimate equation 2. The results are reported in Table 14. The coe cient estimates do not depart from those obtained in the baseline ndings reported in Table 3. However, we note that the interaction term between digital connectivity and the COVID-19 dummy is positive \u2013 suggesting that digitally-enabled rms have laid o 9The distinction between contact and non-contact intensive industries is based on the classi cation adopted in the 2021 October issue of the Regional Economic Outlook (REO) on the Middle-East and Central Asia: high-contactintensive sectors include services, retail, health, and transportation, while low-contact-intensive ones comprise consumer durables and nondurables, manufacturing, chemicals, business equipment, telecommunication, and utilities (IMF, 2021b).\n12\u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution\nless workers in the aftermath of the crisis \u2013 but not statistically signi cant. Such a result can speak to the fact that employment is perhaps less sensitive in the short-run to the joint e ect of digitalization and the crisis, which could be related to the signi cant policy support measures implemented following the crisis, such as job retention schemes, which were primarily aimed at securing employment rather than maintaining sales. Overall, we nd that 10% of rms report to have bene ted from furlough schemes. Another explanation could be that employment may not be the appropriate indicator to measure the impact of digitalization on employment due to the implementation of job retention schemes which helped to prevent large scale employment losses. Instead, hours worked could be a more precise measure \u2013 however \u2013 we do not have information on hours worked.\nFourth, we alternatively use the Oxford Stringency Index in order to calibrate rms\u2019 sales for countries where sales are not available in 2019 or 2020. In fact, one important limitation of the empirical analysis so far was the ad hoc weight applied to the drop in sales for some countries. For instance, in the case of Tunisia, we deliberately assumed that the economy was closed during three (over 12) months in 2020. Using the Stringency Index helps better calibrate weight in the formula for the estimation of drop sales. Again, in the case of Tunisia, the Stringency Index informs us that the country was shut down on average 44% of the year. The results of this procedure are reported in Table 15, which shows strong consistency with the baseline ndings: digitally-enabled rms experience a lower decline of their sales in 2020 compared to digitallyconstrained rms rms. Furthermore, in view of the relatively high-level of digital connectivity among rms in Jordan, we also estimate our baseline model while omitting Jordanian rms from our sample. Table 16 con rms that our main results are not impacted. Finally, Table 17 shows that our ndings continue to hold when we estimate the baseline speci cation using a reduced set of the sample that excludes the estimated drop in sale.10"

Not for Redistribution\nthe crisis has vividly demonstrated the potential of digital technologies and some changes may now be too deep to reverse. In fact, around 35% of all rms in the ME&CA region report to have increased or started their online activity as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, in a future where jobs, education, health, government services, and even social interactions may be more dependent on digital technologies than ever before, failing to ensure widespread and trustworthy digital access and its e ective use risks deepening inequalities, and may hinder countries\u2019 e orts to emerge stronger from the pandemic. Therefore, governments need to develop and put digital strategies at the centre of their policy agendas across several dimension: access, di usion, and skills.\nWith lockdowns and social distancing measures forcing many businesses and schools online, the COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the importance of communications infrastructures and services, as well as robust governance of data. Unleashing the potential of digital tools for rms requires successful di usion, which crucially depends on rms\u2019 investment in ICTs. Countries may promote ICT investment through monetary support or incentives to buy ICT equipment or services, as well as non- nancial support (e.g. targeted training), especially to SMEs which have limited collateral to take risk and access nance for investing in ICTs. Technology di usion is also linked to business dynamism (Andrews et al., 2016; Diez et al., 2021). Reducing barriers to rm entry and strengthening insolvency regimes, can a ect positively a ect competition and resource allocation. The success of rms in the digital age also depends on workers with good literacy, numeracy, problem solving and generic ICT skills used at work. Increasingly, it also requires ICT specialists and data specialists. Ensuring the provision of relevant skills for the digital age requires investments in education and training. Primary education needs to deliver sound literacy and numeracy skills. Subsequently, students need options to develop ICT and complementary skills, including social, communication and management skills.\nWhile our paper focuses only on the short-term impact of digitalization, several factors may play a role in the future which can be interesting avenues for research. For instance, what is the impact of digitalization on the labor market in the medium to long-term? On the one hand, digitalization and subsequent automation can lead to job losses (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). On the other hand, digital innovation and digital transformation are fundamental drivers of new business models and markets, thus, employment generating that can be critical for the post-COVID recovery (Autor, 2015, 2019).\n14\u00a9International Monetary Fund.
