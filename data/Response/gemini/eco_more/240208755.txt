1. **Investigating the use of LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations for a wider range of subrational behaviors.** The current work focuses on four specific economic games, but there are many other subrational behaviors that could be modeled using this approach. For example, LLMs could be used to generate demonstrations of irrational decision-making in the context of financial markets, consumer behavior, or social interactions.
2. **Exploring the use of LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations for different human subgroups.** The current work focuses on generating synthetic demonstrations for a single human subgroup (i.e., rational humans). However, LLMs could also be used to generate demonstrations for different human subgroups, such as children, the elderly, or people with disabilities. This would allow researchers to study the impact of different human characteristics on subrational behavior.
3. **Developing new methods for using synthetic human demonstrations to train subrational agent policies.** The current work uses a simple IL algorithm to train subrational agent policies. However, there are many other IL algorithms that could be used, and it is possible that some of these algorithms would be more effective for training subrational policies. Additionally, new methods could be developed that are specifically designed for training subrational policies using synthetic human demonstrations.
4. **Investigating the use of LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations for use in other areas of research.** The current work focuses on using LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations for use in modeling subrational behavior. However, LLMs could also be used to generate synthetic human demonstrations for use in other areas of research, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
5. **Exploring the ethical implications of using LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations.** The use of LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations raises a number of ethical concerns. For example, it is important to ensure that synthetic human demonstrations are not used to discriminate against or exploit real humans. Additionally, it is important to ensure that synthetic human demonstrations are not used to create deepfakes or other forms of misinformation.
