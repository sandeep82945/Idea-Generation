Both systems use letter-based color codes that require a large range of values to represent different colors. The problem is that these two systems are hard to use for manipulating any operations involving combinations of colors, and they lack the capacity for inter-changeability or unification. Based on prime number theory and Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, this study presents a universal color system (C235) using a number-based structure to encode, compute and unify all colors on a color wheel. The proposed C235 system offers a unified representation for the efficient encoding and effective manipulation of color. It can be applied to designing a high-rate LCD system and colorizing objects with multiple attributes and DNA codons, opening the door to manipulating colors and lights for even broader applications. Introduction Numbers and colors are powerful tools for expressing objects such as people, goods, and DNA. The former can quantify objects and the latter can represent them visually. Isaac Newton\u2019s theory of light claims that all colors can be generated from three basic colors: red, green, and blue. Originating from Newton\u2019s theory, RGB (Red, Green, Blue), a light-color structure that contains 3 \u00d7 256 values of letter symbols, and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key black), a pigment-color structure that contains 4 \u00d7 100 values of letter symbols, have become the most popular color frames used today. Most of the other color frames, such as HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are derived from RGB and CMYK. In the RGB frame, each of R, G, and B colors has 256 values expressed as [0, 1, 2,..., 255], and is coded as (r, g, b). In the CMYK frame, each of C, M, Y, and K has 100 values, expressed as [0, 1, 2,..., 99], and is coded as (c, m, y, k). The weakness of the current CMYK and RGB frames are given below. (i) Expression problems: R, G, B and C, M, Y, K are letter symbols; it is hard to use them to explicitly express the relationship between colors. Take the RGB framework as an example. Based on key colors R, G, and B, another nine colors {RY, Y, YG, GC, C, CB, BM, M, MR} can be deduced, where Y stands for yellow, C for cyan, and M for magenta. However, it is not easy for a user to directly realize the components of color from these letter symbols. Difficulties arise in various application contexts without a specific mechanism for mathematical operations. For instance, what is the complement color of R? What are the triad-complementary pairs within these 12 colors? (ii) Computing problems: Letter symbols in the current color frames are hard to use for color computation. For instance, what is the resulting color after blending four colors of RY, GC, CB, and MR? Moreover, what is the reflecting color of an apple if we use a blue light to irradiate a green apple? (iii) Unification problems: Letter symbols are hard to use for unifying pigment colors and light colors, same for unifying RGB, CMYK, and HSV frames together. Such issues may cause ineffective conversions among different colors. (iv) Size problems: In a CMYK frame, each of c, m, y, and k may assume 100 values, while in an RGB frame, each of r, g, and b may assume 256 values. Take RGB as an example. Each of the R, G, and B colors has 256 values, thus resulting in 3 \u00d7 256 hues, which makes it challenging to distribute and allocate \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023 OpenAccessThis article is licensedunder aCreativeCommonsAttribution 4.0 International License,whichpermits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changesweremade.

In addition, the large number of color values may cause a huge computational burden for combining some of them to generate preferred colors. The weakness of RGB and CMYK is further reflected in emerging applications, such as cell phones, PCs, and TVs, in which RGB and CMYK are widely applied. For current technologies, each pixel on an LCD screen requires 3 \u00d7 8= 24 pulses to generate R, G, and B lights, which is both timeand energy-consuming. Moreover, the transformation between lights and colors is so complicated that no usable smart system is currently available. In this study, we present a new color framework based on the prime number theory and Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, referred to as C235, to encode colors and colorize objects. The aim is to solve bottlenecks inherent in existing methods. Prime number theory claims that any natural number larger than 1 can be uniquely expressed as the product of other prime numbers. This result is widely used for classifying information in the field of cryptography and optimization. Goldbach\u2019s conjecture further claims that any even number larger than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. In our study, we choose the first three prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, to represent the three basic colors of red, green and blue, respectively. Since the white light is a combination of red, green, and blue lights, we may denote the white light by 30= 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5. Cyan is composed of green (3) and blue (5), so 3 \u00d7 5= 15 is used to denote the cyan color. Similarly, 2 \u00d7 5= 10 represents magenta, 2 \u00d7 3= 6 represents yellow, and 15 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 6= 30 represents gray. The exponent of 30 is used to indicate the gray level. Therefore, 30 is darker than 30. Furthermore, we can use seven numerical symbols to replace seven basic letter symbols, i.e., (2, 3, 5, 15, 10, 6, 30)= (R, G, B, C, M, Y, K) and another six numerical symbols for the corresponding letter symbols: (2 \u00d7 3= 12, 3 \u00d7 2= 18, 3 \u00d7 5= 45, 5 \u00d7 3= 75, 5 \u00d7 2= 50, 2 \u00d7 5= 20) = (RY, YG, GC, CB, BM, MR) Consequently, we can use 12 numbers (i.e., 2, 12, 6, 18, 3, 45, 15, 75, 5, 50, 10, 20) to express 12 key hues, and use number 30 to express grayness. In addition, we can use 21; 22; 1\u20444 ; 2256 h i, 31; 32; 1\u20444 ; 3256 h i, and 51; 52; 1\u20444 ; 5256 h i to express the 256 levels of the basic colors R, G, and B, respectively. The mixtures of colors can then be efficiently expressed. For instance, the mixture of the basic colors R at level 10, G at level 20 and B at level 30 becomes 2  \u0301 3  \u0301 5 1\u20444 5  \u0301 15  \u0301 30 1\u20444 75  \u0301 30 which is the color CB (75 for color cyan-blue) at level 10, adding gray (30 for grayness) at level 10. Moreover, we can define that if the product of several colors equals an integer power of, say 30 for k= 1, 2, ..., then these colors are complementary. For instance, R, G, and B are complementary, since 2\u00d73\u00d75= 30. Similarly, YG and BM are complementary since 18 \u00d7 50= 900= 30. Generally speaking, the proposed C235 color framework works much more efficient for encoding, computing, and unifying colors than the existing RGB and CMYK frames. By utilizing Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, this study shows a novel way to compress the RGB color wheel into a much smaller C235 wheel, alleviating the size problem noted with the current RGB frame. Furthermore, we show that the proposed C235 color frame can be readily adopted for colorizing any objects with multiple attributes, designing LCD light systems, and coloring DNA codons. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes two main results, namely, the C235 ring and the C235 wheel. Section 3 shows how to apply the proposed C235 system for designing a high-rate LCD light system. Section 4 discusses the methods and information involved in colorizing objects with multiple attributes and DNA codons using the proposed C235 system. Section 5 concludes the paper. Results This study conveys two sets of major results. The first one is the development of a C235 system using the first three primes 2, 3, and 5 for colors R, G, and B, respectively, to generate color codes. We reasoned that when a large number of colors, say 256, are involved in a system, then we really need to develop a compression mechanism that allocates the colors of concern on a color wheel. The second result indeed shows such a desired compression mechanism of the proposed C235 system for allocating all colors on layered rings for easy display and manipulation. The details are presented below. Result 1: Development of C235 system A C235 color system represents colors R, G, and B by primes 2, 3, and 5, respectively. In this color frame, code <2> is for red color, <3> for green color, and <5> for blue color. Consequently, code <6>= <2 \u00d7 3> is for color yellow (Y), code <15>= <3 \u00d7 5> is for color cyan (C), code <18>= <3 \u00d7 6> is for color yellow-green (YG), and code <45>= <3 \u00d7 15> is for color cyan-green (CG). Color in the C235 system is also associated with a gray level for its lightness/ thickness. Since <30>= <2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5> represents a white light, we use the powers of 30 (such as 30, 30, 30, ...) to indicate the grayness levels. The general rule is that higher power means a darker/thicker color. Figure 1 shows a basic C235 color system of 36 hues/ colors with three gray levels organized in three rings and 12 sectors\u2014the inner circle has three gray codes (such as 30, 30, and 30, \u22ef) surrounded by 36 hues/color codes (such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 3, and 25) spreading in three rings that belong to the 12 sectors (such as R, Y, G, RY, Li et al.

Moreover, we can define that if the product of several colors equals an integer power of, say 30k for k= 1, 2, \u2026,\nthen these colors are complementary. For instance, R, G, and B are complementary, since 2\u00d73\u00d75= 30. Similarly, YG and BM are complementary since 18 \u00d7 50= 900= 302. Generally speaking, the proposed C235 color framework works much more efficient for encoding, computing, and unifying colors than the existing RGB and CMYK frames. By utilizing Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, this study shows a novel way to compress the RGB color wheel into a much smaller C235 wheel, alleviating the size problem noted with the current RGB frame. Furthermore, we show that the proposed C235 color frame can be readily adopted for colorizing any objects with multiple attributes14, designing LCD light systems5, and coloring DNA codons17. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes two main results, namely, the C235 ring and the C235 wheel. Section 3 shows how to apply the proposed C235 system for designing a high-rate LCD light system. Section 4 discusses the methods and information involved in colorizing objects with multiple attributes14,15 and DNA codons17,18 using the proposed C235 system. Section 5 concludes the paper."

            "text": "This study conveys two sets of major results. The first one is the development of a C235 system using the first three primes 2, 3, and 5 for colors R, G, and B, respectively, to generate color codes. We reasoned that when a large number of colors, say 2563, are involved in a system, then we really need to develop a compression mechanism that allocates the colors of concern on a color wheel. The second result indeed shows such a desired compression mechanism of the proposed C235 system for allocating all colors on layered rings for easy display and manipulation. The details are presented below.\nResult 1: Development of C235 system A C235 color system represents colors R, G, and B by primes 2, 3, and 5, respectively. In this color frame, code <2> is for red color, <3> for green color, and <5> for blue color. Consequently, code <6>= <2 \u00d7 3> is for color yellow (Y), code <15>= <3 \u00d7 5> is for color cyan (C), code <18>= <3 \u00d7 6> is for color yellow-green (YG), and code <45>= <3 \u00d7 15> is for color cyan-green (CG). Color in the C235 system is also associated with a gray level for its lightness/ thickness. Since <30>= <2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5> represents a white light, we use the powers of 30 (such as 301, 302, 303, \u2026) to indicate the grayness levels. The general rule is that higher power means a darker/thicker color. Figure 1 shows a basic C235 color system of 36 hues/ colors with three gray levels organized in three rings and 12 sectors\u2014the inner circle has three gray codes (such as 301, 302, and 303, \u22ef) surrounded by 36 hues/color codes (such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 32, and 2253) spreading in three rings that belong to the 12 sectors (such as R, Y, G, RY,\nand YG) outside the big circle. This C235 system makes plotting a specific color more convenient. For instance, <2 \u00d7 30>= <2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5> represents a color composed of hue <2> located in the first ring with a gray level <30> that belongs to the R sector. Hence it is \u201clight red\u201d. For another instance, <2 \u00d7 52 \u00d7 303> is a color composed of hue <50= 2 \u00d7 52> and a gray level <303> . Noting that hue <50> is located at ring 2 of the BM sector, we know that the color is a dark blue magenta with more blue than red. The steps for building the C235 system are described as follows. Step 1: Choose the smallest three prime numbers 2, 3,\nand 5 to denote three basic colors. Since the red light, green light, and blue light are irreducible, we denote 2, 3, and 5 as red, green, and blue, respectively. Because the white light is a combination of red, green, and blue lights, we denote 30= 2\u00d73\u00d75 as the white and gray light. Then, we use 3 \u00d7 5= 15 to denote the cyan color, since cyan is composed of green (3) and blue (5). Similarly, we use 2 \u00d7 5= 10 to represent the magenta color, and use 2 \u00d7 3= 6 to represent the yellow color, and use 15 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 6= 302 to represent gray color. Table 1 explains more about this coding framework. Step 2: Express pigment-color values based on Goldbach\u2019s conjecture. Let S be the set composed of 0 and the first 18 prime numbers, i.e.,\nS \u00bc 0; 2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61f g\nThen, we know from Goldbach\u2019s results that any even number between 4 and 99 can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers in S; and any odd number between 0 and 99 can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers in S plus 1. This means that by using 4 \u00d7 18= 72 values (together with 99 values of lightness), we can express all CMYK colors.\nMR\nM\nBM\nB\nCB C\nCG\nG\nYG\nY\nRY\n335\n3352\n332\n301\n20\n303302\n52\n53\n533\n3322\n23322352\n5332\n152\n153\n5322\n532\n50\n5\n75\n15\n233 23\n22\n103\n102\n10\n235\n2\n33 32\n62 63\n6\n12\n45\n3\n18\nR\nFig. 1 A C235 system with the first 36 hue codes in a ring form. The basic C235 color system has 36 hues/colors with 3 gray levels organized in 3 rings and 12 sectors \u2013 the inner circle has 3 gray codes surrounded by 36 hues/color codes spreading in 3 rings that belong to the 12 sectors outside the big circle\nStep 3: Let <i> be the code of color i. We use codes 2h i, 3h i, 5h i, 6h i, 10h i, 15h i, and 30h i to represent the seven key colors R (red), G (green), B (blue), C (cyan), M (magenta), Y (yellow), and W (white or gray). The code of color i is denoted as Code(i):\nCode\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc 2ri3gi5bi \u00bc 2100 ci3100 mi5100 yih i2:56 \u00bc 2ri li3gi li5bi li30li \u00f01\u00de\nwhere li=min{ri; gi; bi}. We call <2ri li3gi li5bi li> the hue code and <30li> the gray code. We can also assign a unique identifier to Code(i) as\nID i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2562 ri\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 256 gi \u00fe bi\nffi 16; 777; 215 167116:8ci 652:8mi 2:55yi \u00f02\u00de\nwhere ID(i) is an integer. The key merit of Expressions (1) and (2) is that both pigment colors and light colors can be unified in the C235 frame. This renders potential usages of free color conversion between RGB and CMYK systems. In the meantime, Expression (1) and Expression (2) can also unify the RGB and CMYK frames, thus inducing their potential use in color conversions between RGB and CMYK frames. Step 4: The idea of the merger of light color with pigment color is expressed using the following example. Suppose there is an incident light 2\u03b123\u03b135\u03b15h i and a piece of cellophane with color 2\u03b223\u03b235\u03b25 . Let 2\u03c323\u03c335\u03c35h i be the reflecting light using the incident light to irradiate the cellophane. Then, the formulae of \u03c3k (for k= 2, 3, 5) are expressed as \u03c3k \u00bc \u03b1k\u03b2k256 , for k= 2, 3, 5. \u25cf Suppose \u03b1k \u00bc 0or \u03b2k \u00bc 0; then \u03c3k \u00bc 0 for k= 2, 3, 5. \u25cf Suppose \u03b2k \u00bc 256; then \u03c3k \u00bc \u03b1k: \u25cf Suppose the cellophane is red (such as \u03b22 \u00bc\n100; \u03b23 \u00bc \u03b25 \u00bc 0) and the incident light is also red (such as \u03b12 \u00bc 100; \u03b13 \u00bc \u03b15 \u00bc 0), then the reflection light is pale red with \u03c32 \u00bc 39; \u03c33 \u00bc \u03c35 \u00bc 0. \u25cf Suppose the cellophane is yellow (such as \u03b22 \u00bc \u03b23 \u00bc 50; \u03b25 \u00bc 0)and the incident light is red (i.e., \u03b12 \u00bc \u03b13 \u00bc 50; \u03b15 \u00bc 0), then the reflected light is weak bright red with \u03c32 \u00bc 20; \u03c33 \u00bc \u03c35 \u00bc 0.\nStep 5: The merger of colors can be operated as follows. Suppose that i and j are two light colors. Denote by l the merger of colors i and j. Then, we have\n2rl3gl5bl \u00bc 2ri\u00ferj3gi\u00fegj5bi\u00febj\nStep 6: The complements of colors can be expressed as follows. Two colors 2ri3gi5bi and 2rj3gj5bj are complementary if ri \u00fe rj \u00bc gi \u00fe gj \u00bc bi \u00fe bj. Three colors 2ri3gi5bi , 2rj3gj5bj and 2rl3gl5bl\nare triadcomplementary if ri \u00fe rj \u00fe rl \u00bc gi \u00fe gj \u00fe gl \u00bc bi \u00fe bj \u00fe bl.\nStep 7: The colors in HSV can be denoted as (hi; si; vi), where h, s, and v represent hue, saturation, and value, respectively. HSV is also a light-color frame that is highly related to RGB. To unify HSV by C235, we first convert (hi; si; vi) to 2255 ri3255 gi5255 bi , and then convert it to\n2\u03b1i3\u03b2i5\u03c3 i\n. Expressions (1) and (2) are based on an 8-bit color frame, where ci; mi; yi; ki\u2208 {0, 1, \u2026, 99} and ri; gi; bi \u2208 {0, 1,\u2026, 255}. It can also be extended to a \u201chigh color\u201d system with a 9-bit color frame, where ci; mi; yi; ki\u2208 {0, 1, \u2026, 198} and ri; gi; bi \u2208 {0, 1, \u2026, 510}. For simplicity, this study considers only the 8-bit frame. Once a C235 color system is built, we can easily generate color codes and manipulate color operations to answer related questions. Example 1: Consider two pigment colors, i and j with ci;mi; yi; ki\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 56; 28; 28; 0\u00f0 \u00de and cj;mj; yj; kj\n\u00bc 39; 0; 0; 28\u00f0 \u00de. What are the universal codes, ID, and RGB codes of these two colors; and what color is created by emerging these two colors? For color i, we have Code i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2100 563100 285100 28h i2:56\u00bc 2ri3gi5bi . Therefore, ri; gi; bi\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 112; 183; 183\u00f0 \u00de and ID i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2562 \u00b4 112\u00fe 256\u00b4 184\u00fe 184 \u00bc 7; 387; 063. For color j, we first convert 39; 0; 0; 28\u00f0 \u00de into 67; 28; 28; 0\u00f0 \u00de. Therefore, rj; gj; bj\n\u00bc 83; 183; 183\u00f0 \u00de and ID i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2562 \u00b4 83\u00fe 256\u00b4 183\u00fe 183 \u00bc 5; 486; 519. Let color l be the merger of color i and color j, then we have Code(l) = 219633665366h i, which can cause an overflow problem. Therefore, we adjust it as Code(l) = 213732565256h i1:43. Example 2:Where to find the three colors of Example 1 in the ring form of a C235 system?\nSince Code\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc 211231835183h i \u00bc 157130112h i Code\u00f0j\u00de \u00bc 28331835183h i \u00bc 151003083h i Code\u00f0l\u00de \u00bc 219633665366h i \u00bc 1517030196h i\nall three colors belong to sector C (15 for color cyan), with color i being located at ring 71, color j at ring 100, and color l at ring 170. Also, we know color l is darker than color j than color i. Compared to the current RGB and CYMK color codes, the merits of C235 color frame are summarized below: (i) A basic C235 color system can code and allocate up\nto 2563 colors on a two-dimensional disk. (ii) The C235 color coding frame can unify the RGB\nand CMYK frames and provide easy conversion between different color frames.\n(iii) The number-based C235 color frame allows easy manipulation of various color operations.\nResult 2: C235 color wheel (compression of large C235 system) Color wheel is a powerful tool for displaying and manipulating colors2,3. However, the RGB wheel and\nCMYK wheel are not effective enough for the following reasons: Firstly, an RGB wheel contains 3 \u00d7 2562 color hues and a CMYK wheel contains 3 \u00d7 1002 hues. The number of hues is too large for manipulating or displaying colors6. Secondly, CMYK and RGB need 3 \u00d7 256 and 4 \u00d7 100 values, respectively, for representing colors. Thirdly, the CMYK wheel and RGB wheel are not interchangeable. This study, therefore, designs a compressed color wheel, called C235 wheel, which may integrate CMYK and RGB wheels with a compression error rate of less than 1.2%. The compressed C235 wheel is designed to unify CMYK, RGB, and HSV color systems using a much smaller\nnumber of raw colors (key values) to represent all 2563 colors, as illustrated in Fig. 2. It has a high compression rate and low compression errors. Note that an RGB wheel2,3 contains 3 \u00d7 2562 color hues using 768 (= 3 \u00d7 256) key values, while a CMYK wheel contains 3 \u00d7 1002 hues using 400 (= 4 \u00d7 100) key values (Table 2). By performing the next five tasks, we can construct a compressed C235 color wheel (as shown in Fig. 3) that contains 3 \u00d7 422 hues (42 is the maximum integer of h satisfying 6 \u00d7 h \u2264 256) using only 99 key values. The compression rate of C235 color wheel versus the RGB wheel is 2562=422 ffi 37 and the compression error rate is\nwithin 1.2%. The graph of a C235 wheel is shown in Fig. 3. Zoom-in view of the dashed is depicted in Fig. 4. The design of a C235 color wheel can be used in the following tasks: Task 1: (33 Primes) Express pigment-color values based on Goldbach\u2019s conjecture. Let T be the set composed of 0 and the first 33 prime numbers, i.e.,\nT \u00bc 0; 2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61; 67; 71;f 73; 79; 83; 89; 97; 101; 103; 107; 109; 113; 131; 137; 139g\nThen, we know that any even number between 4 and 255 can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers (repetitions allowed) in T; and any odd number between 0 and 255 can be expressed as the sum of the two numbers\nin T plus one. This means that we can represent all RGB colors using 3 \u00d7 33= 99 key values. Task 2: (Reduction of primes) Form a subset U T , where T was obtained in Task 1 Subset U consists of 18 prime numbers as follows\nU \u00bc 5; 11; 17; 23; 29; 41; 47; 53; 59; 71; 83; 89; 101; 107; 113; 127; 131; 137f g\nwhere the gap between two neighboring numbers is either 6 or 12. We can then express ri; gi; bi as\nri \u00bc 4\u00fe f1 \u00fe f2 gi \u00bc 4\u00fe f3 \u00fe f4 bi \u00bc 4\u00fe f5 \u00fe f6\nfor f1; f2; f3; f4; f5; f6 2 U and\nf1 \u00fe f2; f3 \u00fe f4; f5 \u00fe f6 2 6h : h \u00bc 1; 2; \u00bc ; 42f g\nTask 3: (Attractors) Generate attractors for the compressed C235 color wheel. There are 3 \u00d7 422= 5292 attractors, each of which is expressed as 2\u03b13\u03b2; 3\u03b25\u03c3 ; and 2\u03b15\u03c3 , where \u03b1; \u03b2; \u03c3 2 6h : h \u00bc 1; 2; \u00bc ; 42f g \u00bc 4; 6; 10; 16; 22; 28; \u00bc ; 256f g .\nDenote w-Code(i) as the color code of an attractor i on a color wheel, expressed as\nw Code i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2\u03b1 \u20183\u03b2 \u20185\u03c3 \u201830\u2018 \u00f03\u00de where \u2018 \u00bc min \u03b1; \u03b2; \u03c3f g and \u03b1; \u03b2; \u03c3 2 4; 6; 10; 16; 22;f 28; \u00bc ; 256g. Task 4: (Attractor assignment) Assign each of 2ri3gi5bi and/or 2100 ri3100 gi5100 bi 2:56 to an attractor, where ri; gi, and bi are the closest integer values of \u03b1; \u03b2; and \u03c3, respectively. Four neighboring attractors form a block. There are 3 \u00d7 422= 5292 blocks on a C235 wheel. Task 5: (Compression rate and error) The compression rate of the C235 color wheel versus the RGB wheel is 2562=422 ffi 37. The compression error can be computed here. Because the distance from the center of a block to the 4 attractors of the block is bounded by 32 \u00fe 32\u00f0 \u00de0:5, the compression error rate is bounded from above by\n\u00f0\u00f032 \u00fe 32\u00de=\u00f02562 \u00fe 2562\u00de\u00de0:5 \u00bc 0:012\nNotice that Expression (3) indicates that the C235 wheel uses a much smaller number of hue blocks to express codes than RGB and CMYK2,3 do. The comparison is listed in Table 2. Hence the C235 wheel is more effective in unifying colors than RGB, CMYK, and HSV are, as illustrated in Fig. 2. With a compressed C235 wheel, as shown in Fig. 3, we can easily manipulate color operations. For example, let a, b, c, d, e, and f be six reference points on\nthe wheel. The dash-line enclosed area located at the top of the wheel is zoomed in as shown in the square under the wheel (Fig. 4). Several observations can be done here:\n(i) Each color is expressed in a universal format that can be converted into an RGB, CMYK, or HSV frame. For instance, given a \u00bc 2256h i, we have\nca;ma; ya; ka\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0100; 0; 0; 0\u00de\nha; sa; va\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0180 ; 100; 100\u00de\nFor Color b\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 3256h i, Color c\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 5256h i, we can derive the same RGB and CMYK codes of colors b and c.\n(ii) Color d\u00f0 \u00de, located at the center of the wheel, is the merger of a, b, and c. The code is Color d\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2256h imerge 3256h imerge 5256h i \u00bc 30256h i\n(iii) Color\u00f0e\u00de \u00bc 225435h i, as shown in Fig.4, can be assigned to a neighboring attractor color Color a\u00f0 \u00de since 225435h i ffi 2256h i.\nColor f\u00f0 \u00de is an overflow color denoted as Color f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 230035h i. It can be rewritten as Color\u00f0f \u00de \u00bc 2256310h i1:17ffi 2256h i1:17, as shown at the top of the C235 wheel, and assigned to attractor point a. Moreover, the value 1.17 reflects that Color f\u00f0 \u00de is an overflow color."

Most such involved displays use LED as the light source.

Suppose that we want the apple to show the orange color (i.e., d2= 120, d3= 60, d5= 0), then we know 120= (c2+ 100)100/256 to get c2\u2250 207. Similarly, 60= (c3+ 100)100/256 implies that c3\u2250 53. Therefore, the control light should be <2207353>, as shown in Fig. 5b. The present study is related to the design of PWM, especially for LCD. Consider the following application scenario. Example 3:When a user wants to let an LCD pixel emit color 222432065102h i, then what kind of pulse width do a traditional PWM and a C235 PWM need to generate? A traditional PWM modulator7,9 demands more logical bits for representing colors and a sophisticated hardware design, as well as higher power consumption for emitting color lights. Please refer to Supplementary B for the technical details of the traditional PWM. The design proposed in this study is accomplished by employing an extended Goldbach conjecture in a C235 color system such that the nine pulse widths used for presenting each of R, G, or B at a pixel in the current 9-bit LCD display can be reduced to only two widths. Hence the new design may significantly reduce the technological complexity in associated devices. One promising application of our color coding is for the LCD industry. Currently, to emit the R, G, and B lights of 256 colors, each pixel on the LCD screen has three LEDs under the control of a pixel circuit. All pixel circuits follow the order of an LCD central computing center14. In the current LCD system, for any integer X between 0 and\n256, X can be expressed as\nX \u00bc 128T128 \u00fe 64T64 \u00fe 32T32 \u00fe 16T16 \u00fe 8T8 \u00fe 4T4 \u00fe 2T2 \u00bc T1\nwhere T128, T64,\u2026, T1 are binary variables. The central computing center will order each R, G, and B LEDs of a pixel to generate up to eight pulse widths (i:e:; T1, T2, \u2026, T128). The total pulse widths a pixel may emit is 3\u00b4 8 \u00bc 24, which incurs considerable time and energy. In contrast, in our case, based on Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, for an integer between 6 and 254, X can be explored by C235 as\nX \u00bc yTy \u00fe z Tz\nwhere Ty and Tz are binary variables and y and z are primes, y; z 2 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37;f 41; 43; 47; 53; 58; 61; 67; \u00bc ; 139g. With the specified 31 primes, C235 can generate all even numbers by adding the two closest prime numbers. Each prime represents a pulse width. Therefore, the LCD control center first computes the required prime value to generate a specific light for a pixel, and then orders the pixel circuits to control each of its R, G, and B LEDs to emit two pulse widths. The total pulse widths generated is 2 \u00b4 3 \u00bc 6, as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows that C235 can use two pulses only to generate any pulse between 0 and 256. Figure 6b shows that a width of 256 is generated by 149 and 107. Figure 6c, d illustrate that width 220 is composed of 113 and 107; and width 44 is composed of 41 and 3. Since the number of pulses required to generate in C235 LCD PWM is much less than that in the current LCD PWM, the required time and energy can be reduced significantly. This scheme could be valuable for designing high-rate future LCDs. Notably, 24 pulse widths are needed to generate a traditional PWM. With the C235 PWM, we can generate T131 and T113 for R; T112 twice for G, and T43 and T59 for B. In total, only six pulse widths are required. An extended Goldbach conjecture can help us overcome the drawbacks of the current LCDs that demand many pulse widths for generating R, G, and B brightness. Goldbach\u2019s conjecture states that any even number can be given as the sum of two prime numbers. From Goldbach\u2019s conjecture, we have the following proposition. <Use Goldbach Conjecture for expressing RGB> Any even integer between 8 and 256 can be expressed as a sum of two elements in the following prime set P that contains all prime numbers between 3 and 149:\nP \u00bc 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61; 67; 71; 79; 83; 89; 97; 101; 103; 107; 109; 113; 127; 131; 139; 149\nFor instance, 256= 149+ 107, 200= 103+ 97, and 90= 67+ 23. It uses 34 primes to express any even number between 4 and 256. We are interested in forming a smaller prime set\nNatural light\nNatural light\nControl light\n210031005100\n210031005100\n21003100\n2120360\n2207353\na\nb\nFig. 5 The design of a smart lighting system. a An apple observed under natural light. b An apple observed under a control light\nto express all numbers between 4 and 256 within a tolerable margin of error. Suppose that there is a set of integers, expressed in the form of\nn \u00bc 4\u00fe 6k; for k 2 1; 2; 3; \u00bc ; 42f g\nIn other words, n belongs to the integer set N \u00bc 10; 16; 22; 28; 34; 40; 46; \u00bc ; 244; 250; 256f g. We hope to find the minimal prime set Pm8 , where each of n in N can be expressed as the sum of two primes in Pm8 . This problem can be formulated as the following integer linear program15,16: A program for finding Pm8\nMinimize X q2P \u03b4q \u00bc \u03b45 \u00fe \u03b47 \u00fe \u03b411 \u00fe \u03b413 \u00fe \u00fe \u03b4139 \u00fe \u03b4149\nsubject to\n10 \u00bc 10\u03b45\n16 \u00bc 5\u03b45 \u00fe 7\u03b47 \u00fe 11\u03b411 \u00fe 13\u03b413 22 \u00bc 5\u03b45 \u00fe 7\u03b47 \u00fe 11\u03b411 \u00fe 13\u03b413 \u00fe 17\u03b417 \u00fe 19\u03b419\n28 \u00bc 5\u03b45 \u00fe 7\u03b47 \u00fe 22\u03b411 \u00fe 13\u03b413 \u00fe 17\u03b417 \u00fe 19\u03b419 \u00fe 23\u03b423\n34 \u00bc 5\u03b45 \u00fe 7\u03b47 \u00fe 11\u03b411 \u00fe 13\u03b413;\u00fe34\u03b417 \u00fe 19\u03b419 \u00fe23\u03b423 \u00fe 29\u03b429 \u00fe 31\u03b431\n40 \u00bc 5\u03b45 \u00fe 7\u03b47 \u00fe 11\u03b411 \u00fe 13\u03b413 \u00fe 17\u03b417 \u00fe 19\u03b419 \u00fe23\u03b423 \u00fe 29\u03b429 \u00fe 31\u03b431 \u00fe 37\u03b437\n..\n.\n256 \u00bc X l2P l\u03b4l; P \u00bc 3; 5; 7; \u00bc ; 149f g\nwhere \u03b4k are binary variables for k \u00bc 1; 2; 3; \u00bc ; 42. This program intends to minimize the number of primes in set P, subject to the restriction that all integers in N can be expressed as the sum of two primes.\nThe above is a linear 0-1 program that can be efficiently solved by most commercial optimization software. The solution to the above program is \u03b4k \u00bc 1 for k 2 Pm8 \u00bc 5; 11; 17; 23; 41; 53; 71;f 83; 107; 113; 131; 137; 149g, and \u03b4k \u00bc 0 for k=2Pm. The number of primes in set Pm is 13, which is much smaller than the number of primes 34 in set P. We then deduce the following proposition modified from Goldbach\u2019s conjecture: <Extended Goldbach conjecture for 8-bit lighting> Consider any value n in an 8-bit RGB system. For n \u00bc 4\u00fe 6k; k 2 1; 2; 3; \u00bc ; 42f g, the following propositions hold:\n(i) Any value n can be expressed n \u00bc p\u00fe q, where p; q 2 Pm8 .\n(ii) Any value n\u00b1 1; n\u00b1 2; n\u00b1 3 can be approximately expressed as n\u00b1\u0394 ffi p\u00fe q for \u0394 \u00bc 1; 2; 3 within an error rate of 3/n.\n(iii) Prime p and q represent key color values in R, G, and B. Table 3 lists all \u00bc 4\u00fe 6k; k 2\n1; 2; 3; \u00bc ; 42f g and the primes p and q satisfying n= p+ q. For instance, 10= 5+ 5, 40= 23+ 17, 220= 113+ 107,\u2026, 256= 149+ 107. It is noted that 220 can also be expressed as 149+ 71. Since 113 and 107 are closer to each other than 149 and 171, we adopt the expression 220= 113+ 107. We can also approximately express 218, 219, 221, and 223 as the sum of 113 and 107 with an error within 3220 ffi 0:013.\nFollowing the International Commission on Illustration, the tolerable rate of R, G, B brightness is 10%. Therefore, a brightness level larger than 30 is an admissible estimate within the tolerable error. 8-bit LCD PWM A light color 2\u03b13\u03b25\u03c3 can be generated by assigning the two off-time periods for each of \u03b1; \u03b2; and \u03c3 specified as follows.\n2off \u03b11\u00fe1 258\u00fe\u03b11 \u03b12 2 ; 256\u00fe\u03b1 2 256\u00f0 \u00de\n3off \u03b21\u00fe1 258\u00fe\u03b21 \u03b22 2 ; 256\u00fe\u03b2 2 256\u00f0 \u00de\n5off \u03c31\u00fe1 258\u00fe\u03c31 \u03c32 2 ; 256\u00fe\u03c3 2 256\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere \u03b11 \u03b12; \u03b21 \u03b22; \u03c31 \u03c32; for \u03b11; \u03b12; \u03b21; \u03b22; \u03c31; \u03c32 2 Pm8 , and \u03b11 \u00fe \u03b12 ffi \u03b1; \u03b21 \u00fe \u03b22 ffi \u03b2; \u03c31 \u00fe \u03c32 ffi \u03c3 . The error of the generated light is smaller than 3\u03b1 ; 3 \u03b2 ;and 3 \u03c3 for R, G, and B lights, respectively."

There are 22 amino acids in a DNA codon, where each codon acid is composed of A, G, C, T17. For instance, acid 1 is composed of GCT, GCC, GCG, and GCA. By utilizing C235, we can assign each acid a color code and a number, and thus allocate all 22 amino acids on a C235 ring.
