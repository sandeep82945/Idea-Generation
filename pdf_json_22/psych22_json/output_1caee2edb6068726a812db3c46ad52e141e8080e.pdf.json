    "abstractText": "Individual\u2019s decision to cooperate with disease prevention varies based on their respective health beliefs and common factors that motivate actions. Previous research has found that pandemic anxiety, high health literacy, and eHealth literacy influenced healthcare behavior. Understanding how the pandemic affects people on modifying preventive health behavior is promising. Accordingly, this cross-sectional study focusing on health behavior utilized Structural Equation Modeling to characterize causative factors of anxiety, health literacy, eHealth literature, and protection in the new normal of COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Online surveys used a snowball sampling method through social media to recruit participants aged over 20 years in 8 provinces in Thailand. iGeneration and millennials were the top two, making up 75.0% of the 700-respondents in total. Independent variables: Health Literacy (p = .030); eHealth Literacy (p < .001); and anxiety (p = .040) significantly influenced the new normal. The new normal practices: hand hygiene, wearing hygienic masks and social distancing, maintaining good health, and preventing virus exposure by making digital payments could be indicated by 34% of Thai people by all those independent variables. This means that those who are more concerned and literate about health literacy and eHealth literacy, will make better health decisions and practice more preventive health care. Individuals may use health knowledge to make healthy decisions to protect themselves from the current pandemic. They can also use what they have learned to defend themselves from other emerging infectious illnesses in the future. Therefore, official institutions should provide helpful and timely health information that is easily accessible. Public health interventions should prioritize the availability of health information in the electronic form on various social media platforms to educate people to protect themselves from the spread of disease. The information should be comprehensible and practical for all socioeconomic groups.",

Previous research has found that pandemic anxiety, high health literacy, and eHealth literacy influenced healthcare behavior. Understanding how the pandemic affects people on modifying preventive health behavior is promising. Accordingly, this cross-sectional study focusing on health behavior utilized Structural Equation Modeling to characterize causative factors of anxiety, health literacy, eHealth literature, and protection in the new normal of COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Online surveys used a snowball sampling method through social media to recruit participants aged over 20 years in 8 provinces in Thailand. iGeneration and millennials were the top two, making up 75.0% of the 700-respondents in total. Independent variables: Health Literacy (p = .030); eHealth Literacy (p < .001); and anxiety (p = .040) significantly influenced the new normal. The new normal practices: hand hygiene, wearing hygienic masks and social distancing, maintaining good health, and preventing virus exposure by making digital payments could be indicated by 34% of Thai people by all those independent variables. This means that those who are more concerned and literate about health literacy and eHealth literacy, will make better health decisions and practice more preventive health care. Individuals may use health knowledge to make healthy decisions to protect themselves from the current pandemic. They can also use what they have learned to defend themselves from other emerging infectious illnesses in the future. Therefore, official institutions should provide helpful and timely health information that is easily accessible. Public health interventions should prioritize the availability of health information in the electronic form on various social media platforms to educate people to protect themselves from the spread of disease. The information should be comprehensible and practical for all socioeconomic groups.\nKey words: COVID-19, eHealth literacy, new normal, health care behavior, SEM."

            "text": "Whereas the immediate result of a pandemic is an effect on physiological health, psychological consequences should not be ignored. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in psychological health; people\u2019s way of life, especially human connections1; and psychological wellbeing2, in addition to the fear of disease transmission and potential mortality.3 It is interesting to apply psychological and behavioral research, particularly from the health psychology and health behavior disciplines, to identify the factors contributing to changes in human behavior. All countries have implemented several strategies to diminish the size of this outbreak. Nationwide lockdowns represent one such measure, which has also contributed to a variety of psychological outcomes.4 Approximately one-third of the general populace in Asia and Europe is experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression. Asian citizens were found to have anxiety and depression prevalence rates of 32.9% and 35.3%, respectively.5 In the current COVID-19 pandemic, Thai people have learned the same lessons as other countries did from the SARS and previous pandemics to protect themselves from respiratory infectious diseases.6,7 Following the confirmation of infectious coronavirus disease cases in Thailand, Thai citizens were encouraged to take good care of themselves and to protect themselves in the event of a pandemic. These approaches have resulted in the \u201cnew normal\u201d with regard to healthcare behaviors to combat the viral transmission of COVID-19 among Thais. For example, wearing surgical masks or face masks8, using alcohol handsanitizing gels, washing hands9,10, and practicing good hand hygiene11 have been introduced in daily life, especially in crowded public areas, to minimize droplet\nand airborne transmission. As a result, the number of domestic infectious cases and the mortality rate have not continuously increased for several months.8,12 This represented the motivation of this study to evaluate people\u2019s healthcare behavior in Thailand. There is no doubt that the novel coronavirus pandemic leads to illness and mortality. In addition to an impact on physiological health, significant triggers exist that affect psychological health. Individuals who have been exposed to events for over a long time are more likely to develop psychological issues, such as anxiety and depression. Individual health behavior changes as a result of the perception of risks and the severity of this infectious disease can alter biopsychosocial perspectives and lead to death. Thus, access to helpful health information on self-care is important for citizens to protect themselves and the people around them. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a significant model demonstrating changes in people\u2019s preventive health behavior. The motivation of a person to modify their personal health is strongly influenced by their health beliefs. Individuals have different perceptions when an illness or disease outbreak occurs, including perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy.13 As a result, individuals contribute to disease prevention on the basis of their health beliefs, as well as their perceptions on health and illness.14 During the COVID-19 pandemic, specific evidence, such as knowledge about the disease, as well as its symptoms and risk factors, has been required to address this crisis. Health literacy is one\u2019s ability to maximize health information gathered from legitimate resources, especially from general practitioners, scientific literature, television, radio, magazines, and multimedia.15,16 It contributes to individuals\u2019 ability to take good care of\nJournal of Public Health and Development Vol.20 No.1 January-April 2022\nthemselves through understanding and applying useful information for health promotion and disease prevention.17 eHealth literacy focuses on health information made accessible through electronic sources and the internet. It was designed for effective communication in the digital age by introducing infographics, scientific information, and useful health information to understand diseases and conditions.18 An individual\u2019s capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information is one of the significant variables influencing people to change their health behaviors. It manifests itself in the form of health literacy. Previous studies found a link between eHealth literacy and health behavior, e.g., in Korean adults19, Chinese college students20, and nursing students in the US.21 All studies came to the same conclusion; electronic health literacy is the most powerful predictor of health behaviors. eHealth literacy can be a significant aspect in encouraging individual behaviors. Individuals who perceive which online health resources are of high or poor quality can modify their health outcomes or make health-related decisions. Similarly, studies in some patients with infectious respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease found a link between health literacy and health behaviors. Increases in physical and mental health were linked to increased comprehension of health information and engagement with healthcare professionals.22 Additionally, increased health literacy abilities were favorably and immediately related to more health knowledge. Health knowledge also had a direct and positive association with health behavior, which was then linked to health status.23 From the above-mentioned evidence, it can be assumed that anxiety, health literacy, and eHealth literacy are related to influential factors motivating individuals to practice preventive healthcare behaviors. It is interesting to learn about the factors that influence\npeople\u2019s decisions to modify their preventive health behavior during the pandemic. According to the hypothesis, when individuals have anxiety related to a pandemic situation, their ability to find, understand, and use health information (health literacy and eHealth literacy) is altered, causing an adjustment in their healthcare behavior so as to avoid getting the disease. Several studies have found that health literacy and eHealth literacy play a significant role in preventive health behaviors. For example, higher levels of disease knowledge about COVID-19 and eHealth literacy are predictors of preventive behavior.24 Higher levels of health literacy and eHealth literacy can lead to more active participation in COVID-19-related health behaviors.20 In contrast, poor health literacy has been proven to impact how people with long-term illnesses respond to and manage their health problems.25 Despite previous studies pointing to the importance of health literacy and eHealth literacy, the relationship between eHealth literacy and other COVID-19related health behaviors has received little attention, particularly among Thais. This research gap was investigated in our present study. Accordingly, this study highlights the independent variables, such as anxiety, health literacy, and eHealth literacy that can influence shifts in individual health behavior according to the Health Belief Model (HBM). During the COVID-19 pandemic, public intervention strategies focusing on health and eHealth literacy are required to promote COVID-19-related preventive health behaviors as the new normal so as to minimize the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. These strategies constitute the conceptual framework for this study, which investigates and characterizes the causal factors and relationships among health information perceptions through research instruments, such as COVID-19 health literacy, eHealth literacy, anxiety assessment, health\nJournal of Public Health and Development\nVol.20 No.1 January-April 2022\nbehavior, and self-care after the COVID-19 pandemic. The intercorrelation among these variables is demonstrated using structural equation modeling. The findings of this study represent an advantageous model to understand the health protection factors for preventing coronavirus disease and can be applied to future unpredictable diseases related to acute respiratory illness."

Most participants lived in cities, reflective of the context of the pandemic in Thailand, where a high cumulative infection rate of COVID-19 has been reported in the top ten provinces in Thailand. Although the COVID-19 situation in Thailand has been changing vastly day by day, this research is still helpful in terms of investigating and demonstrating the psychological and behavioral relationship as a function of the role of literacy and an individual\u2019s behavior changes to prevent the disease.

            "text": "In our study, we applied psychological and behavioral science disciplines focusing on health psychology and health behavior to help to understand, predict, and improve human behavior, as well as understand the intercorrelation among the related variables that can predict the event consequences related to human behavior. According to the Health Belief Model, people\u2019s health beliefs influence their decision to improve their preventive health behavior. Thus, they modify their health behavior on the basis of their perceptions and concerns about health risks, disease severity, and the unfavorable outcome of getting the virus. Furthermore, health literate and eHealth literate individuals can carry out their health responsibilities more effectively. In the current study, we explored the relationships among these variables during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings presented significant causal effects for the three independent variables (COVID-19 eHealth literacy, the COVID-19 health literacy, and COVID-19 anxiety) on the dependent variable (health behavior and self-care for COVID-19 prevention, i.e., the new normal) among Thai people. The model fit took into account six indices (Cmin/df = 2.96 (spec. \u22643.0), GFI = 0.98 (spec. >0.95), RMSEA = 0.05 (spec. 0.03\u2013 0.08), NFI = 0.96 (spec. >0.90), and CFI = 0.98 (spec. >0.90)), indicating good model fit.26 COVID-19 anxiety, health literacy, and eHealth literacy played important roles in encouraging Thai people, particularly metropolitans, to participate in health protection. According to the theory of the Health Belief Model, this results in behavior change to fit into the new normal.14 The COVID-19 anxiety assessment explored concerns among respondents, revealing discomfort and worry related to the spread of COVID-19 when encountering crowds in public areas\nor public transportation, comprising people who may have contracted the virus. Upon infection, there were additional concerns about spread to family members, old and young alike. Thai people exhibit health literacy in the form of eHealth literacy through social media and official websites, thereby having an effect on the new normal, which can be categorized into four components. The first component is hygiene. Hand hygiene or hand-washing has been recommended as initial protection strategy for individuals using facilities in public areas.27 This approach can reduce exposure to infectious respiratory diseases by using soap28 to destroy bacterial and viral contamination on touched surfaces.29 Another aspect involves food hygiene, including clean packaging and processing of canned foods at high temperatures, as well as cleaning the products themselves before eating.30 \u201cEat Hot, Use Middle Spoon, and Clean Hands More Often\u201d is an important slogan contributed by the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand to encourage people to protect themselves from infected ingredients and unclean food preparation.31 The second component involves the prevention of viral exposure and dispersion, including the use of surgical masks.32 Most people wear face masks because they believe, according to clinical evidence, the masks can protect them from pathogens. They also have a positive attitude towards the use of face masks to control virus transmission in public places.33 This component also involves social distancing, whereby crowded areas, public transportation, and symptomatic people are avoided.10 The third component involves maintaining good health, including physical and mental health. Without vaccines for the protection and treatment of this disease, physical activity plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy immune system, e.g., regular exercise at\nJournal of Public Health and Development\nVol.20 No.1 January-April 2022\nleast 3\u20135 days a week for at least 30 min, as well as adequate rest (at least 6\u20138 hrs. a day) and relaxation during the pandemic.34 The fourth component involves the digital way of life, such as cashless or electronic payments, financial readiness, and food delivery. As a result of money being easily contaminated35, cashless payments via internet banking and Visa Pay Wave have become important for metropolitan areas in Thailand. Several shops in the big cities in Thailand have generated barcodes for payments. Overall, people with high levels of health and eHealth literacy are more likely to engage in healthcare behavior across all aforementioned components. Most accessible sources of health information suggest that effective COVID-19 prevention requires a combination of healthcare behaviors. Moreover, social media is an essential tool to educate people about public health awareness and public health concerns, as well as to evoke people to positively participate in public health behavior modification.36,37,38,39,40 It also helps individuals improve their eHealth literacy.24,41 However, considering its widespread influence among people, the information needs to be of high quality and legitimate. Health professionals and academics represent important sources of health information on official and trustworthy websites or any platform on the internet.42 The information should be comprehensible and practical for all socioeconomic groups."

            "text": "In terms of anxiety and healthcare behavior, anxiety is rooted in the need to protect oneself. People who are concerned about a pandemic may exhibit good healthcare behavior. Higher levels of health literacy and eHealth literacy are associated with more positive healthcare behavior, as individuals know where to source health\ninformation, as well as how to evaluate and confidently use health information to protect themselves. Public health interventions should prioritize the availability of health information in an electronic form on various social media platforms to educate people on how to protect themselves from the spread of disease. Influential social media platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, Line, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, have an impact on people\u2019s access to health information. Governments or healthcare organizations should, therefore, provide reliable and timely health information sources, along with health education via online media platforms, to promote and improve health and eHealth literacy, as well as support to improve psychological resilience. Plans to raise the awareness of health risks should be repeatedly implemented and reinforced to arouse individual participation in preventive health, in addition to the elimination of fake news."

            "text": "This study was a cross-sectional investigation of participants with online access at one point in time. While the current study results demonstrate a positive influence of the three variables of healthcare behavior, further research involving a large group of participants from various socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as other prevention strategies, such as community transmission control, national policies, and so on, must be conducted to confirm the relationship between an individual\u2019s degree of healthcare information and their health decision making. Policymakers can use this evidence to provide appropriate interventions to improve health literacy.\nJournal of Public Health and Development Vol.20 No.1 January-April 2022"

            "text": "Our findings correlate with the Health Believe Model, i.e., that is people will make appropriate health decisions and engage in preventive healthcare behavior when they are concerned about the pandemic and have cognitive information, including risk factors, illness severity, and the benefits of prevention. The current study demonstrated relationships among COVID-19 eHealth literacy, health literacy, anxiety, and the new normal for healthcare behavior following the COVID-19 pandemic. Health literacy is a necessary tool for people to protect themselves from disease spread. Furthermore, it provides productive information for healthcare workers to tackle this pandemic43, as well as novel infectious diseases in the future. Therefore, helpful, trustworthy, and timely health information needs to be made conveniently accessible by official organizations, such as the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. As a result of the pandemic, preventive health behaviors, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, keeping social distance, maintaining good physical and mental health, and the digital way of life, have been found to be the most effective ways to help eliminate the virus, especially with the danger brought by new variants in the wait for COVID-19 vaccines and medical interventions. This helps to protect everyone, especially those who are immunocompromised and at risk of severe COVID-19 infection. According to this study, some Thais have fortunately adopted these healthy habits as their new normal. This protective healthcare behavior can help individuals protect themselves not only from the current epidemic but also from future unpredictable acute respiratory illnesses.\nCOMPETING INTERESTS All the authors have no potential conflicts of interest."
