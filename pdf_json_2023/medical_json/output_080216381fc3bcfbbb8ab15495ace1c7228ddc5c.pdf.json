This has prompted the development of low-intensity therapies for AML. Initial low-intensity regimens consisting of low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy had limited efficacy.5-7 The addition of the oral BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) to low-intensity backbones has revolutionized the treatment of patients with AML who are older and/or unfit. In the phase 3 VIALE-A trial, VEN plus azacitidine was compared with azacitidine alone and showed an improvement in composite complete remission (CR) rates and overall survival (OS), defining a new standard of care for patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.8 VEN has also been combined with backbones based on LDAC and a triple nucleoside combination of cladribine, LDAC, and an HMA.9,10\nLow-intensity VEN-based combinations are highly effective in inducing remissions, which can also be durable in many patients. However, they have not been directly compared with intensive chemotherapy regimens in prospective, randomized studies. In addition, in retrospective studies, the patient population treated with low-intensity therapy is generally older and enriched for AML with adverse genetic features, making comparisons of efficacy difficult between intensive and low-intensity regimens. Conceivably, many patients with AML are eligible for both intensive and lowintensity approaches (such as older patients aged <75 years without substantial comorbidities). In these cases, the optimal choice of therapy is controversial.11 Intensive approaches have been considered to be more effective but carry more toxicity, with the converse being applicable with low-intensity regimens. We hypothesized that treatment intensity may not be a determinant factor in patient outcome assuming achievement of an optimal response to therapy. In other words, in the context of AML therapy, the destination may matter more than the journey.\nTraditional morphologic response assessment in AML lacks sensitivity. A patient in morphologic CR may still harbor up to a billion leukemic cells.12 A group of highly sensitive laboratory techniques capable of detecting the remaining submicroscopic disease, referred to as measurable residual disease (MRD), now allow for the detection of as little as ~0.1% to 0.01% AML blasts, depending on the method, with some molecular techniques even being sensitive at the 10\u22126 level.13,14 Detectable MRD has been established as a strong and independent prognostic factor predicting worse OS and an increased risk of relapse.15-17 Although most of the evidence for the prognostic value of MRD is based on studies of intensive chemotherapy, a growing body of literature supports its value for patients treated with lower intensity regimens.18-20 The most widely applicable MRD assessment method in AML is multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), relying on aberrant cell surface protein expression to identify and quantify AML blasts.21\nIn order to assess the relative contributions of treatment intensity and MRD response to outcomes, we conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients with newly diagnosed AML responding to either intermediate to high-dose cytarabine-based intensive regimens or VEN-based low-intensity frontline regimens.\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nWe show that treatment intensity was not significantly associated with either OS or cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse (CIR) in a multivariate analysis considering factors such as response quality, MRD status, and cytogenetic/molecular risk categories. Assuming an optimal response is achieved, this suggests that outcomes are similar whether intensive or low-intensity approaches were used to achieve this state."

We identified all patients with newly diagnosed AML who had achieved a response (CR, CR with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], or morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]) after either intensive chemotherapy regimens based on intermediate to high-dose cytarabine plus an anthracycline (IA cohort) or after low-intensity therapy based on a LDAC or HMA backbone plus VEN (LOW + VEN cohort). Patients who were nonresponding were excluded. Patients treated with additional investigational or targeted agents were included within the IA or LOW + VEN cohorts as per their backbone regimens, except for IA plus VEN, which was excluded, given the limited follow-up and experience with this specific combination. Patients with antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome were included only if they were not previously treated with an HMA.\nBecause MFC-based MRD was a key factor in our analysis, we excluded patients who lacked adequate MRD testing via MFC. Patients with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or core-binding factor (CBF) AML [AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), RUNX1::RUNX1T1; or inv(16)(p13.1q22), CBFB::MYH11] were also excluded because MRD for these AML subtypes is tracked using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as opposed to MFC, at our institution.\nBaseline clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics were collected for all patients. Molecular profiling was performed using a next-generation sequencing panel interrogating hotspot or entire exonic regions of recurrently mutated genes in AML, and included either 28, 53, or 81 genes, depending on the year of testing. The patients were stratified into favorable-, intermediate-, or adverserisk categories following the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 guidelines.22\nEthics approval for this study was obtained from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nResponse and outcome definitions\nPatients who were responding were defined as those who had achieved either CR, CRi, or MLFS, as defined by the ELN 2017 criteria.22 OS was defined as the time from best morphologic response to death from any cause, with censoring of patients who were alive at the time of last follow-up. Relapse was defined as reemergence of bone marrow blasts \u22655%, circulating blasts, or extramedullary disease.22 Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was defined as death from any cause without preceding AML relapse.\nIMPACT OF MRD AND Rx INTENSITY ON OUTCOMES IN AML 3285\nTable 1.

The DfN approach carefully excluded the preleukemic phenotype.23 The sensitivity of this assay varied between 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 (0.1%-0.01%), depending on the cellularity of the specimen and the degree of immunophenotypic overlap between the residual leukemic blasts and the normal myeloid precursors.

In total, 385 patients were treated with IA regimens and 250 with LOW + VEN regimens. Of the patients treated with IA or LOW + VEN, 95 of 385 (24.7%) and 59 of 250 (23.6%), respectively, had an additional investigational agent added to the regimen. Almost all the younger patients (age, <60 years) received IA, with only 11 patients aged <60 years treated with LOW + VEN. Patient baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The patients treated with LOW + VEN regimens were significantly older. This group was also enriched for ELN adverserisk disease and high-risk cytogenetic features, such as \u22125/5q\u2013, \u22127/7q\u2013, \u221217/17p\u2013, and complex karyotype. The median time from the start of therapy to best morphologic response was 32 days (interquartile range, 27-38 days) in the IA cohort and 39 days (interquartile range, 30-63 days) in the LOW + VEN cohort. The LOW + VEN cohort had a lower proportion of patients who achieved CR (as opposed to CRi/MLFS) compared with the IA cohort (76.0% CR with LOW + VEN vs 89.4% CR with IA). This was driven by an increased incidence of ELN adverse-risk disease in the LOW + VEN cohort, which had a lower CR rate. Response distribution by treatment intensity and ELN category are shown in Figure 1A. The rate of MRD negativity was also lower in the LOW + VEN cohort compared with the IA cohort (60.4% with LOW + VEN vs 71.4% with IA). MRD negativity was similar between treatment cohorts within ELN categories (Figure 1B). Of the responding patients, MRD\u2212 CR was achieved in 66.2% (255 of 385) in the IA cohort and in 55.2% (138 of 250) in the LOW + VEN cohort. The rate of allogeneic SCT was approximately double in the IA cohort (50.1%, 193 of 385 patients) compared with the LOW + VEN cohort (24.8%, 62 of 250 patients).\nOS and CIR stratified based on treatment intensity and MRD status\nWe then stratified the full cohort into 4 groups based on treatment intensity (IA vs LOW + VEN) and MRD status (positive vs negative). Two hundred seventy-five patients were stratified into the IA MRD\u2212 group, 151 into the LOW + VEN MRD\u2212, 110 into the IA MRD+, and 99 into the LOW + VEN MRD+ group. With a median follow-up of 38.9 months, the median OSs for the IA MRD\u2212, LOW + VEN MRD\u2212, IA MRD+, and LOW + VEN MRD+ groups were 50.2, 18.2, 13.6, and 8.1 months, respectively (Figure 2A). The 2-year CIRs for the IA MRD\u2212, LOW + VEN MRD\u2212, IA MRD+, and LOW + VEN MRD+ groups were 41.1%, 33.5%, 64.2%, and 59.9%, respectively (Figure 2B). The 2-year CIs of TRM for the IA MRD\u2212, LOW + VEN MRD\u2212, IA MRD+, and LOW + VEN MRD+ groups were 7.8%, 29.5%, 9.4%, and 30.4%, respectively (supplemental Figure 1A).\nPatients who were MRD\u2212 had significantly longer OS when treated with IA (median OS, 50.2 months with IA vs 18.2 months with LOW+ VEN; P = .001) but similar CIR (2-year CIR, 41.1% with IA vs 33.5% with LOW + VEN; P = .300; Figure 2A-B).

The CI of TRM curves grouped together based on treatment received, as opposed to MRD status, with the lower TRM observed within the patients treated with IA likely reflecting the younger age and better fitness of this group (supplemental Figure 1A).\nBecause older patients may derive less benefit from IA, we repeated this analysis by including only the patients aged \u226560 years (n = 297). There was no significant difference in OS or CIR based on the treatment intensity within MRD categories in the patients aged \u226560 years (Figure 2C-D). The corresponding figure for CI of TRM in the older patients is shown in supplemental Figure 1B. The limited number of patients aged <60 years who received LOW + VEN precluded analyses comparing the impact of treatment intensity in this population."

These findings are consistent with those of another retrospective study that included 245 patients with AML and showed that both MRD status and response (CR vs CRi vs CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) were predictive of relapse in a multivariate model.35 This is somewhat counterintuitive because MRD status is considered a much more sensitive assessment of response than morphological criteria and blood count recovery. This finding is likely explained by the imperfect nature of MFC-based MRD in AML. Up to 30% of patients who are tested MRD\u2212 by MFC still eventually relapse,36 suggesting the method occasionally fails to detect leukemic blasts either because they are immunophenotypically indistinguishable from normal myeloblasts or are present at a level below the limit of detection. Lack of full count recovery (ie, achievement of CRi/MLFS as opposed to CR) may reflect residual disease undetected using MFC-based MRD methods with negative implications. Indeed, responses other that CR (such as CRp or CRi) have been associated with more frequent detection and higher levels of MRD.35 A recent meta-analysis demonstrated the prognostic impact of MRD in patients achieving responses other than CR (eg, CRi and MLFS).17 Therefore, it appears that both MRD and quality of morphologic/hematologic response contribute independently to outcomes in AML.\nA major limitation of our study was its retrospective single-center design. Our results may also not apply to AML subtypes in which transcript-based MRD is performed (CBF-AML) because these were excluded from this study. In addition, retrospective comparisons between patients treated with intensive chemotherapy vs lowintensity regimens are inherently biased because patients who are intensively treated are younger, have better performance status, have lower comorbidity burdens, and are enriched for more favorable cytogenetic/molecular disease features. Therefore, multivariate analyses are critical when attempting such comparisons. Unmeasured potential confounders are another possible limitation of this study.\nFurthermore, our study included only responding patients and therefore could not evaluate whether the overall response rates were different between the IA- and LOW + VEN\u2013treated cohorts. However, we did note that CR with MRD negativity was achieved in a higher proportion of patients treated with IA than in those treated with LOW + VEN, apparently driven by an increased incidence of ELN adverse-risk disease in the LOW + VEN cohort. It is, therefore,\npossible that the better quality of responses in the IA cohort was because of more favorable disease features as opposed to greater efficacy of the therapy. Time to best morphologic response may also be longer in low-intensity therapies when compared with IA regimens, as was observed in our study, potentially introducing an immortal time bias. To mitigate this, we used the best response date as time 0 for both OS and CIR calculations. Finally, we emphasize that patients receiving low-intensity therapy in our study as well as in the 2 other retrospective studies discussed were almost exclusively older patients (age, \u226560 years).33,34 Therefore, at the present time, the applicability of our findings are limited to older patients with AML.\nOverall, our findings suggest that, assuming an optimal response to therapy is achieved, disease control may be similar irrespective of the treatment used to achieve this state, although this needs to be confirmed in prospective studies. This supports the notion that the primary goal of therapy in AML should be to achieve MRD\u2013 CR, with more effective novel low-intensity regimens that can achieve deep responses being potentially equivalent to traditional cytotoxic regimens. This is reflected by the recognition of MRD\u2212 responses in the 2017 ELN recommendations and their most recent update.22,37 In younger patients (age, <60 years), intensive chemotherapy\u2013based approaches remain the standard of care and are potentially curative. The use of low-intensity therapy in younger patients is investigational, and it is unknown whether such approaches can cure AML in the absence of SCT. A clinical trial to evaluate frontline lower intensity regimens among younger patients (#NCT03573024) is ongoing.38 In older patients eligible for both intensive and lowintensity regimens, the optimal approach remains to be determined. We expect that an ongoing randomized phase 2 study (#NCT04801797) will be instrumental in answering this question.39"
