Exploration of Alternative Linker Chemistries: Investigate the effects of varying linker compositions beyond amino acids, potentially incorporating novel bioorthogonal chemistry that could offer improved stability, enhanced tumor uptake, and reduced off-target effects. This could include the exploration of peptoid or PEGylated linkers, which may exhibit different pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profiles.

Development of Next-Generation Multimeric Agents: Building on the promising results with dimeric agents, research could focus on designing and evaluating trimers or even larger multivalent constructs. These agents could potentially bind to PSMA with even higher avidity, offering further improvements in tumor uptake and retention, and possibly providing a mechanism to overcome resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer cells.

Integration of Targeted Therapy with Immunomodulators: Combine PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapeutic agents. This approach could synergize the direct antitumor effects of radioligand therapy with the activation of the immune system, potentially leading to improved therapeutic outcomes, including the induction of systemic anti-tumor immunity.

Investigation of Radionuclide Pairing for Theranostics: Further explore the use of different radionuclides for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This could involve pairing imaging isotopes (such as Gallium-68) with therapeutic isotopes (such as Lutetium-177 or Actinium-225) in the same PSMA-targeting molecule, optimizing the theranostic potential for personalized treatment planning and monitoring.

Addressing Renal Toxicity through Novel Strategies: Given the challenge of renal toxicity associated with PSMA-targeting agents, research could focus on innovative approaches to mitigate this risk. This could include the development of strategies for renal protection, such as the co-administration of nephroprotective agents, or the design of PSMA ligands with altered pharmacokinetics to minimize renal uptake and retention.
