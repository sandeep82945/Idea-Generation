At the nanoscale, interactions between such particles and their confining boundaries become unavoidable. We address the roles of electrostatic repulsion and absorption on the spatial distribution and dispersion of charged nanoparticles in near-surface shear flows, observed under evanescent illumination. The electrostatic repulsion between particles and the lower charged surface is tuned by varying electrolyte concentrations. Particles leaving the field of vision can be neglected from further analysis, such that the experimental ensemble is equivalent to that of Taylor dispersion with absorption. These two ingredients modify the particle distribution, deviating strongly from the Gibbs-Boltzmann form at the nanoscale studied here. Theoverall effect is to restrain the accessible space available to particles,which leads to a striking, tenfold reduction in the spreading dynamics as compared to the noninteracting case.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.038201\nDiffusion is a fundamental microscopic transport mechanism that can be effectively enhanced by orders of magnitude in the presence of a hydrodynamic velocity gradient. In the process commonly known as Taylor dispersion [1], particles starting from the same position are advected along the flow while the concentration profile is broadened due to Brownian diffusion across streamlines, cf. Fig. 1(a). Such enhanced broadening, i.e., dispersion, is the principal mechanism for solute dispersal in many natural and technological contexts [2\u201310]. At nanometric distances from surfaces, however, particles can no longer be considered simple tracers since they are subject to intermolecular forces [11], mobility-reducing hydrodynamic interactions with boundaries [12\u201315], as well as reaction or absorption at the latter [4,16\u201318]. Such interactions modify the spatial structure of particle-probability distributions, but there is yet no observation about how this modification could affect the diffusivelike transport dynamics of Taylor dispersion. The object of this Letter is thus to link nanoscale probabilistic structure to spreading dynamics. Taylor dispersion has many applications in situations where such physicochemical interactions are important, with biophysical contexts being emblematic. As such, the seminal theoretical work of Taylor has been significantly extended [4,17,22\u201330]. Particle absorption or chemical reactions on the boundaries induce a gradual and substantial loss of particle number. This particle loss may strongly\nmodify particle probability distributions, also complexifying models for dispersion [18,26,30]. Reactivity is critical for several applications in chemistry and life science [31\u201339]. Several experimental works noted that such interactions\nor absorption [40] bias diffusion coefficient evaluations using the Taylor dispersion method [31]. In typically millimetric capillary tubes, the induced error was noted as a few tens of percent [41]. Such errors may become more significant in smaller systems, for instance, in applications for peptide diffusion and the determination of aggregate sizes [38,42], among others [43]. State-of-theart Taylor dispersion studies also focused on the geometry of a flow domain [10] at micrometric and millimetric scales. Other recent experiments, reaching microscales and nanoscales [44] focused on preasymptotic dispersion dynamics [45\u201347], but not on the link between nanoscale statistical distributions and Taylor dispersion. In this Letter, we study nanoscale Taylor dispersion in a near-surface shear flow. First, we systematically vary the role of surface interactions by tuning the repulsive electrostatic interaction between the nanoparticles and the lower surface, becoming important for dispersion when the corresponding interaction scale is comparable to that of confinement. Second, we employ a finite observation zone with an open upper boundary; particles leaving this zone formally correspond to permanently absorbed ones.\n0031-9007=23=130(3)=038201(7) 038201-1 \u00a9 2023 American Physical Society\nOur experiments thus allow a study of nanoscale dispersion under adsorption, without the obvious inconvenience of a polluted, physically absorbing surface. Such a particle loss is found to strongly modify the observed particle probability distribution relevant for dispersion. Using an extended moment theory [48\u201352], we quantitatively recover our experimental observations. In contrast to the few tens of percent noted above for macroscopic systems, we observe a tenfold Taylor dispersion reduction when both boundary effects are present, as compared to the case when they are absent. We used objective-based, total internal reflection fluo-\nrescence microscopy (TIRFM) [47,53], observing individual, negatively charged, a \u00bc 55-nm-radius, latex colloidal particles. The particles were suspended in pressure-driven shear flows near an interface between salted water and glass [see Supplemental Material (SM) Secs. I and II [19] for videos and experimental details]. These observations yield the particle positions (the apparent height zapp and x, y in-plane positions), resolved to within a few tens of nanometers. The former allows access to altitude probability distributions (APDs), whereas sequential particle observations were linked into temporal trajectories (ca. 105 of them for this study); see SM Video 1 [19]. Displacements \u0394x \u00bc x\u00f0t\u00fe \u03c4\u00de \u2212 x\u00f0t\u00de over a delay time \u03c4 from a particle\u2019s first observation time twere thus recorded and used to determine the near-wall shear rate _\u03b3 (see SM Sec. II). Also obtained were the variances of the streamwise, \u03c32\u0394x \u00bc h\u00f0\u0394x \u2212 h\u0394xi\u00de2i [see Fig. 1(b)], and transverse displacements \u03c32\u0394y, allowing us to calculate dispersion and diffusion\ncoefficients. Independent trajectories were superimposed at common spatiotemporal origins, as in Fig. 1(b) herein and Video 2 in SM, to visualize the evolution of particle ensembles. Particle volume fractions were small enough to ignore interparticle interactions. The Taylor-Aris theory predicts a rescaled, longtime dispersion coefficient Dx=D0 \u2212 1 \u00bc Pe2=30 for a linear shear flow bounded by reflecting walls [47,49]. Here, Dx \u00bc \u03c32\u0394x=\u00f02\u03c4\u00de, D0 is the bulk diffusion coefficient of the nanoparticles, and Pe \u00bc _\u03b3h2=\u00f02D0\u00de is the Peclet number comparing transport by advection and diffusion, h being the observation zone height. In Fig. 2(a) are shown the normalized streamwise dispersion coefficients as a function of \u03c4, with at least four shear rates used for each condition (see SM Sec. II-D for unscaled data [19]). The normalization uses the depth-averagedDy \u00bc \u03c32\u0394y=\u00f02\u03c4\u00de (note the angle brackets in the axis label), which closely approximates the bulk diffusion coefficent D0 [47]. Importantly, we note a strong modification in the dispersion coefficient on changing the salt concentration: the data for the highest salt concentration give nearly a threefold increase in the dispersion, as compared to ultrapure water, as also indicated in Fig. 1(b). We note furthermore that h andD0 are identical for the three different datasets at laser illumination power of Plaser \u00bc 150mWin Fig. 2(a). Therefore, the classical TaylorAris theory, supposing noninteracting tracer particles in flows bounded by rigid walls, is clearly inappropriate here. This observation motivates a detailed investigation into the influence of the interactions with the walls on dispersion. At equilibrium, the particles\u2019 concentration follows a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with cB \u221d exp \u00bd\u2212U=\u00f0kT\u00de , where U is an interaction potential and kT the thermal energy. In Figs. 2(b, i)\u20132(b, iii) are thus shown experimental APDs, P for identically imposed pressure drops of 30 mbar and different salinities; the distributions are normalized by their maxima and no filtering concerning the time of observation is made. Since the particles and glass surfaces are negatively charged, a repulsive electrostatic interaction that can be obtained from DLVO theory [11] is expected:\nUel\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc kT a\nl\u0303B exp \u2212 z \u2212 a lD : \u00f01\u00de\nHere lD is the Debye length, l\u0303B \u00bc e2=\u00f0\u03f5kT\u00de \u00d7 \u00bdtanh\u00f0e\u03c8p=\u00f04kT\u00de\u00de tanh\u00f0e\u03c8w=\u00f04kT\u00de\u00de \u22121 is a surfacemodified Bjerrum length [11], and e, \u03f5, \u03c8p, and \u03c8w are the elementary charge, the dielectric permittivity of the liquid, the particle, and the wall surface potentials, respectively. The lines in Fig. 2(b) are model fits to the experimental APDs particularly including the Boltzmann distribution cB\u00f0z\u00de with the potential of Eq. (1) as the only energetic contribution\u2014other necessary ingredients, see Refs. [47,54,55], include the finite camera sensitivity\n038201-2\n(giving the observation zone height, h), along with objective optics and particle polydispersity, modifying the direct correspondence between distance and intensity. The good agreement for the full fits here suggests that the electrostatic repulsion mainly [56] determines the distribution of particles near the wall. Therefore, we call these the quasiequilibrium APDs (QE-APDs). Quantitatively, the Debye lengths obtained from the QE-APD fits are lD\u00bcf67;32;10g 3 nm for \u00bdNaCl \u00bc f0; 5.4; 54g mg=L, respectively, in agreement with the DLVO theory [11]. Furthermore, we find a salinity-independent l\u0303B \u00bc 13 3 nm consistent with expected particle and wall potentials of approximately \u2212120 mV; see SM Sec. II.A [19]. For the different salinities, decreased electrostatic repulsions allow particles to access a larger part of the velocity gradient, enhancing the dispersion. For an observation zone height of approximately 800 nm, a 50 nmDebye-length modification gives a twofold change in the dispersion coefficient. Besides intermolecular interactions, the height h is a key ingredient for the QE-APD fits. This height can be tuned by changing the laser power, as shown in Fig. 2(b, iii). Accordingly, for pure water, decreasing the laser power gives a further factor of 2 decrease in the normalized,\nsteady Dx between the highest and lowest laser powers in Fig. 2(a). On exceeding h a particle\u2019s trajectory is no longer considered, as indicated by the crossed-out particle in Fig. 1(a), and thus the open boundary acts as an ideal particle sink. This sink progressively modifies the structure of the particle distribution in the observation zone [4,41], as shown next. In Fig. 3(a), experimental time-dependent (TD) APDs are shown for pure water, displaying different delay times since the particles\u2019 first observation. As the typical timescale to diffuse out of the observation zone is given by h2=D0, the TD-APDs are plotted for different values of the dimensionless time D0\u03c4=h2. A temporal evolution of the TD-APD is observed, and a steady state is reached for times approaching the diffusion time h2=\u00f0D0\u03c02\u00de predicted by Taylor [1]. Remarkably, this longtime, steady distribution is different from the QE-APD, thus representing a violation of the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, shown in black for comparison. To assess the effect on the aforementioned probabilistic modifications on the dispersion, theoretically we consider a population of nanoparticles initially located at the origin x \u00bc 0 (see Fig. 1) and distributed vertically with an initial concentration profile c\u00f0x \u00bc 0; z; t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc cini\u00f0z\u00de\u03b4\u00f0x\u00de. The concentration field c\u00f0x; z; t\u00de obeys the advection diffusion equation [22],\n\u2202c \u2202t \u00fe vx\u00f0z\u00de \u2202c \u2202x \u00bcDx\u00f0z\u00de \u2202 2c \u2202x2 \u00fe \u2202 \u2202z Dz\u00f0z\u00de \u2202c \u2202z \u00feU 0 el\u00f0z\u00de kT c ;\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere Dx and Dz are the streamwise and cross-stream diffusion coefficients. These latter depend on z due to hydrodynamic forces induced by the no-slip boundary condition at the hard wall [see SM Eq. (S3) [19] ]. Zero particle flux at the wall imposes Dz\u00bd\u00f0\u2202c=\u2202z\u00de \u00fe \u00f0U0el\u00f0z\u00de=kT\u00dec \u00bc 0 at z \u00bc a. As nanoparticles are not followed after they leave the observation zone, the concentration field vanishes at the open boundary, i.e., c\u00f0x; z; t\u00de \u00bc 0 at z \u00bc h. This Dirichlet boundary condition is equivalent to a chemical absorption reaction with an infinite reaction rate [17]. The moments of the concentration field described by Eq. (2) can be computed in many ways, including the moment [48\u201352], invariant manifold [26,57], GreenKubo [30,58], and large-deviation methods [59,60]. Here, we use a moment theory solving for the time-dependent streamwise pth (with p \u2265 0) moments cp\u00f0z; t\u00de \u00bcR R x\npc\u00f0x; z; t\u00dedx recursively (see SM Sec. III [19]). Using a modal decomposition, the solution is found to be of the form\ncp\u00f0z; t\u00de \u00bc X\u221e k\u00bc1 cp;k\u00f0z; t\u00de exp\u00f0\u2212\u03bbkt\u00de; \u00f03\u00de\n038201-3\nwhere cp;k are polynomial functions of t of degree p and \u03bbk are the eigenvalues of the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problem, with \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < . We show in Fig. 3(b) the theoretical TD-APD at different times for an ensemble of particles initially distributed according to a Boltzmann weight cini\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc cB\u00f0z\u00de, using the same electrostatic parameters and the absorbing wall at h obtained by fitting the data in Fig. 2(b). The main qualitative features of the experimental observations are recovered: a depletion zone develops near the open boundary while the TD-APD converges toward a steady distribution, corresponding to the spatial structure of the slowest eigenmode with \u03bb \u00bc \u03bb1 [see SM Eq. (S9)]. Importantly, the slowest eigenmode of Eq. (3) has a\nnonzero eigenvalue such that the total number of particles m0 decays exponentially at long times. This decay is a consequence of the absorbing boundary at the limit of the observation zone. In Fig. 3(c), we show the experimental fraction m0\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc R h a c0\u00f0z; t\u00dedz=\u00bd R h a c0\u00f0z; 0\u00dedz of particles remaining in the observation zone, as a function of the dimensionless lag time. No matter the strength of the electrostatic interactions and the laser power, a temporally exponential decay of the number of particles is observed at long times. Similarly, in Fig. 3(d), we show the theoretical fraction of particles remaining in the observation zone, as a\nfunction of the dimensionless lag time, for the three Debye lengths accessed experimentally. We again find an exponential decay at large times, i.e., m0 \u221d exp \u00f0\u2212\u03bb1\u03c4\u00de, independent of cini\u00f0z\u00de. From a microscopic point of view, the nanoparticles\ndiffuse out of the observation zone, such that the typical decay timescale is set by the time \u223ch2=D0 needed for the particle to reach the absorbing boundary at the top of the observation zone. Besides, the decay time depends on the electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions via the ratios between the typical length scales in the problem and the channel size. Altogether, the theoretical decay rate reads \u03bb1 \u00bc \u00f0D0=h2\u00deF\u00bd\u00f0lD=h\u00de; \u00f0l\u0303B=h\u00de; \u00f0a=h\u00de , where F is an unknown dimensionless function to be determined by solving the eigenvalue problem described in the SM Sec. III-B [19]. In Fig. 4(a), we compare experiments and theory for the dimensionless decay timeD0=\u00f0\u03bb1h2\u00de as a function of the Debye-length-to-channel-size ratio. As expected, the longer the range of the electrostatic interaction (i.e., the larger Debye length), the faster particles leave the observation zone. While there is a small deviation between the measurements and predictions, especially for the unmodified water (blue), the overall trends agree. Since the open boundary of our experiments affects the TD-APDs, as described in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) and as dictated by the spatial structure of the slowest eigenmode, our theoretical approach allows a prediction regarding dispersion. Computing the first and second moments of the concentration, we extract the dispersion coefficient of the remaining particles; see SM Sec. III-E [19]. This coefficient converges to a steady value at long times, as in Fig. 2(a). The long-term dispersion coefficient Dx can be written as the sum of the steady-state averaged streamwise molecular diffusion coefficient hDxi, cf. SM Eq. (S40) [19], and a term induced by the advection-diffusion coupling:\n038201-4\nDx \u00bc hDxi \u00fe Z h\na\n1\ncB\u00f0z\u00de \u00bdvx\u00f0z\u00de \u2212 hVi \u03b61\u00f0z\u00def1\u00f0z\u00dedz; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere hVi and f1\u00f0z\u00de are the steady-state averaged velocity and the steady TD-APD shown in Fig. 3(b), respectively. The quantity \u03b61 is an auxiliary function related to f1\u00f0z\u00de as in SM Eq. (S19). In Fig. 4(b) are shown the rescaled, steady dispersion\ncoefficients for all of the experimental salinities and laser powers (colored dots). The general increase of dispersion coefficient with salinity seen is expected due to increased access to the near-wall regions on electrostatic screening, as in Fig. 2. For a quantitative description of the data, we also display predictions of four different models (see SM Fig. S3 for schematics [19]). The tracer theory of Taylor [1] and Aris [48] largely overestimates the data (black dashed line). Moment theory for a wall with infinite adsorption rate, i.e., an open boundary, but no lower surface interactions with the wall [SM Eq. (S42) [19], black, dash-dotted line] predicts a significant global decrease in the dispersion coefficient. Both these models are yet independent of salt concentration. The theory of Refs. [22,30] assumes a reflective boundary at z \u00bc h and includes conservative interactions with one wall. Dispersion coefficients from this theory read Dx \u00bc hDxi \u00fe f\u00bdDz\u00f0z\u00de; cB\u00f0z\u00de; vx\u00f0z\u00de , cf. SM Eq. (S44), and are decreased as compared to the classical Taylor model (dashed colored lines), yet still overestimate the measured dispersion coefficients. Finally, the moment theory combining electrostatic interactions and an open boundary at z \u00bc h, Eq. (4), quantitatively captures the measurements (solid colored lines), even while noting a small systematic deviation for the pure water case. Figure 4(b) stresses that using an absorbing boundary condition at the limit of the observation zone is necessary to accurately estimate the reduction of the dispersion coefficient measured in the TIRFM experiments. Indeed, the relevant statistical distributions at the heart of Taylor dispersion phenomena are thereby strongly modified. In contrast, the existing theory [22,30] depends only on the APD given by cB\u00f0z\u00de. To conclude, our collective observations show that chemical- or absorption-induced leakage at boundaries and particle-surface interactions can play a dominant role in Taylor dispersion at the nanoscale. Nanoscale transport is routinely used to measure the physical properties of biological objects and processes, as in Refs. [37\u201339,42,43,61]. Here, we have demonstrated that the precise nature of particle-surface interaction must be carefully taken into account to yield accurate measurements.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Pierre Soulard and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Restagno for fruitful and ongoing discussions, as well as Caroline Cramail and Ayme\u0300ne Sadaoui for preliminary experimental implications.
