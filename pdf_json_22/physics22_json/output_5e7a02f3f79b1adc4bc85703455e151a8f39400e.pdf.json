    "abstractText": "As the core device of the miniature quantum dot (QD) spectrometer, the morphology control of the filter film array cannot be ignored. We eliminated strong interference from additives on the spectrum of a long-wave infrared (LWIR) QD filter film by selecting volatile additives. This work is significant for detecting targets by spectroscopic methods. In this work, a filter film with characteristic spectral bands located in the LWIR was obtained by the natural evaporation of QD ink, which was prepared by mixing various volatile organic solvents with HgSe QD\u2013toluene solution. The factors affecting the morphology of HgSe LWIR films, including ink surface tension, particle size, and solute volume fraction, were the main focus of the analysis. The experimental results suggested that the film slipped in the evaporation process, and the multilayer annular deposition formed when the surface tension of the ink was no more than 24.86 mN/m. The \u201ccoffee ring\u201d and the multilayer annular deposition essentially disappeared when the solute particles were larger than 188.11 nm. QDs in the film were accumulated, and a \u201cgully\u201d morphology appeared when the solute volume fraction was greater than 0.1. In addition, both the increase rate of the film height and the decrease rate of the transmission slowed down. The relationship between film height and transmission was obtained by fitting, and the curve conformed to the Lambert\u2013Beer law. Therefore, a uniform and flat film without \u201ccoffee rings\u201d can be prepared by adjusting the surface tension, particle size, and volume fraction. This method could provide an empirical method for the preparation of LWIR QD filter film arrays.",

            "text": "Nanomaterial inkjet printing technology is a cutting-edge technology for the microdistribution and precise printing of ink droplets by controlling the nozzle voltage, air pressure, platform temperature, and motion trajectory, which can achieve the high-precision patterned deposition of nanomaterials. This technology has attracted extensive attention in the fields of display panel printing [1\u20134], microelectronic component fabrication [5\u20137], and flexible printing [8\u201310] in recent years due to the advantages of rapidity, convenience, and low cost. As is known to all, semiconductor QDs are synthetic nanomaterials. When the size of a semiconductor quantum dot is smaller than or comparable to the exciton Bohr radius in all three directions, the electron motion is confined and forms a split energy level [11\u201321]. Therefore, it has many unique optoelectronic properties different from those of bulk materials, such as broad absorption spectra, narrow symmetrical emission spectra, and large Stokes shifts. Its spectrum can be tuned by adjusting various parameters, such as the synthesis time, material ratio, and core\u2013shell structure [22,23]. In addition to the QD\u2019s unique optical properties, it also has the advantages of low cost, multiple types, and easy integration. Therefore, people have used QDs as filter materials to prepare visible-light\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2180. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12132180 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2180 2 of 12\n(Vis) and near-infrared (NIR) filter film arrays and QD micro-spectrometers [24\u201329]. The existing filter films and their working bands are shown in Table 1.\nUsing a QD filter film array prepared by inkjet printing technology as the spectroscopic element of a micro-spectrometer is an effective method to miniaturize the spectrometer. The uniformity of the filter film directly determines the error when the detector detects the light intensity and affects the performance of the spectrometer. Therefore, it is necessary to control the film morphology. There are many factors that affect the morphology of thin films, and they are usually divided into external environmental factors and internal characteristic factors. External environmental factors mainly include ambient temperature, substrate temperature, substrate roughness, droplet size, etc., while internal characteristic factors refer to the ink characteristics, including ink surface tension, solute particle size, concentration, viscosity, etc. In terms of ink conditioning, surfactants or adhesives are usually added to regulate the surface tension of the ink solvent. The effect of capillary flow on particles can be overcome by triggering a tension gradient (Marangoni flow) [30] in droplets [31\u201335], so a uniform and flat film without \u201ccoffee rings\u201d can be obtained [36]. Sometimes, increasing the particle size or changing the particle shape can reduce the effect of capillary force and weaken the \u201ccoffee ring\u201d effect [37\u201339]. The solute volume fraction can also be varied to adjust the degree of sparsity or density on deposition patterns [40,41]. As mentioned above, optimizing the film morphology by adjusting the properties of the solvent has excellent effects in printing display panels and preparing visible-light or nearinfrared filter films. The characteristic spectral peak of HgSe QDs used in this study was located in the longwave infrared at 12.5 \u00b5m [42]. The ink cannot be modified simply by adding active agents or polymers when preparing a long-wave infrared filter film. Because most surfactants or adhesives are difficult to evaporate and have strong absorption in the long-wave infrared band, the specific filtering function will not be achieved. Therefore, volatile organic solvents were used to modify the ink in this study. The effects of ink surface tension, particle agglomeration, and the solute volume fraction on the morphology of nanomaterials were investigated. Eight kinds of evaporable organic solvents (isopropanol, n-octane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone, chloroform, and toluene) were used as surface tension modifiers. QD inks with different surface tensions were prepared by mixing the organic with toluene\u2013QD solution (toluene was used to ensure the dispersion of QDs). Due to the large difference in polarity between n-octane and toluene, the agglomeration degree of QDs can be regulated by adding n-octane to the QD solution. QD inks with different agglomerated particle sizes could be obtained by mixing different proportions of n-octane and toluene\u2013QD solution. QD inks with different solute volume fractions were prepared by mixing different proportions of toluene and toluene\u2013QD solution. Then, 0.5 \u00b5L of the QD solution was dropped on a glass slide with a pipette, simulating the situation of ink droplets on the substrate in inkjet printing. The effects of the surface tension, particle size, and solute volume fraction of the ink solvent on the film morphology were analyzed. The fitting curve of the relationship between the solute volume fraction and transmittance was obtained. The results can provide a reference for the preparation of long-wave infrared QD filter films with specific transmittance and good morphology.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2180 3 of 12"

A 50 mg/mL HgSe QD\u2013toluene solution was used as the solute, and isopropanol, n-octane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone, chloroform, and toluene were used as different solvents. Eight kinds of QD inks with different solvents were obtained by mixing the solute with solvents in a 1:1 volume ratio. Then, the inks were put into an ultrasonic instrument (Kunshan KQ-50B, Beijing, China) and shaken for 10 min.

The relationship between solvents for the parameters R and \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 was isopropanol > n-octane > ethanol > ethyl acetate > butyl acetate > acetone > chloroform\n> toluene.\nThe adhesion of droplets to the substrate increased with the increase in |\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4e|. The\ndroplets can wet the substrate when \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 \u2264 0, and the wetting ability decreased with the increase in |\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56|. The liquid can spread automatically on the substrate when \ud835\udc46 \u2265 0, and the spreading ability decreased with the increase in \ud835\udc46.\nAmong the above inks, the \ud835\udf03 of inks with isopropanol and n-octane as solvents was\nno more than 24.86 mN/m. The droplets had weak adhesion and strong wetting and\nspreading abilities on the substrate due to the small \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4e, and the phenomenon of multilayer ring deposition was more likely to occur. In contrast, the \ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4e of the inks with toluene and chloroform as solvents were higher. Thus, the droplets had stronger adhesion\nand weaker wetting and spreading abilities on the substrate with no multilayer annular\ndeposition.

Effect of Particle Size on Film Morphology\nIt was found that the content of the organic solvent in the ink can affect the agglom-\neration degree of QDs, which in turn affects the morphology of the film. Due to the large\ndifference in polarity, it will cause obvious agglomeration with the addition of n-octane\nto the QD\u2013toluene solution. Different agglomerated particles can be obtained by adjusting\nthe ratio between n-octane and toluene. Therefore, inks with volume ratios of toluene to\nn-octane of 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, and 1:9 were prepared. The surface tension, particle size, and\nFigure 2.

T relationsh p betwe n solvents for the parameters R and Wi was isopropanol > n-octane > ethanol > ethyl acetat > butyl acetate > acetone > chloroform > toluene. The adhesion of dr plets to the substrate increased with the increase in |Wa|. The droplets can wet the substrate when Wi \u2264 0, and the wetting ability decreased with the increase in |Wi|. The liquid can spread automatically on the substrate when S \u2265 0, and the spreading ability decreased with the increase in S. Among the above inks, the \u03b8 of inks with isopropanol and n-octane as solvents was no more than 24.86 mN/m. The droplets had weak adhesion and strong wetting and spreading abilities on the substrate due to the small Wa, and the phenomenon of multilayer ring deposition was more likely to occur. In contrast, the \u03b8 and Wa of the inks with toluene and chloroform as solvents were higher. Thus, the droplets had stronger adhesion and weaker wetting and spreading abilities on the substrate with no multilayer annular deposition. Therefore, the film-forming property and uniformity can be improved by appropriately increasing the surface tension of the ink."

Among them, QD inks with different tensions were first obtained by mixing eight kinds of organic solvents (isopropanol, n-octane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone, chloroform, and toluene) with the QD\u2013toluene solution. Secondly, due to the large difference in polarity, QD inks with different agglomerated particle sizes were obtained by mixing different proportions of n-octane and QD\u2013toluene solution. QD inks with different solute volume fractions were then prepared by mixing different proportions of toluene and toluene\u2013QD solution. Finally, films with different morphologies were obtained by naturally evaporating QD ink droplets on the substrate. The effects of the surface tension, particle size, and volume fraction on the film morphology were emphasized in the analysis. After that, the infrared transmission spectra of the films were measured. The experimental results suggest that the film slipped in the evaporation process, and the multilayer annular deposition formed when the surface tension of the ink was no more than 24.86 mN/m. The \u201ccoffee ring\u201d and the multilayer annular deposition essentially disappeared when the solute particles were larger than 188.11 nm. When the solute volume fraction was greater than 0.1, the QDs in the film were accumulated, and a \u201cgully\u201d morphology appeared. In addition, the increase rate of the film height and the decrease rate of transmission slowed down. The relationship between the film height and transmission was fitted, and the curve conformed to the Lambert\u2013Beer law. Therefore, the morphology of the film can be improved by adjusting the surface tension of the film, the particle size of the solute, and the volume fraction of the solute. Therefore, a uniform and flat film without \u201ccoffee rings\u201d can be prepared by adjusting the surface tension, particle size, and volume fraction. This approach could provide an empirical method for the preparation of LWIR QD filter film arrays. It was also found that the evaporation rate, temperature or type of substrate, and shape of solute particles also affected the film morphology in the experiment. The above factors can be discussed and analyzed in detail in subsequent research. In addition, agglomeration easily occurs due to the large specific surface area of nanoparticles. Therefore, it is also important to modify and passivate the surface to avoid agglomeration when synthesizing nanomaterials, and QD filter films with good morphology can be prepared by improving the ink uniformity.\nAuthor Contributions: S.W.: methodology, validation, investigation, and writing\u2014original draft; X.Z.: methodology; Y.W.: AFM test and writing\u2014review; T.G.: writing\u2014review and editing; S.C.: supervision and writing\u2014review and editing.
