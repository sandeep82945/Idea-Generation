    "abstractText": "The reactivity of the new flexible potentially pentadentate N3O2 aminophenol ligand H4L (2,2\u2032-((pyridine-2,6-diylbis(methylene))bis(azanediyl))diphenol) towards different dysprosium salts and holmium(III) nitrate was investigated. Accordingly, this reactivity seems to greatly depend on the metal ion and salt employed. In this way, the reaction of H4L with dysprosium(III) chloride in air leads to the oxo-bridged tetranuclear complex [Dy4(H2L)3(Cl)4(\u03bc3-O)(EtOH)2(H2O)2]\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O (1\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O), while the same reaction just changing the chloride salt by the nitrate one renders the peroxo-bridged pentanuclear compound [Dy5(H2L)2(H2.5L)2(NO3)4(\u03bc3-O2)2]\u00b72H2O (2\u00b72H2O), where both peroxo ligands seem to come from the fixation and reduction of atmospheric oxygen. However, if holmium(III) nitrate is used instead of dysprosium(III) nitrate, no evidence of a peroxide ligand is observed, and the dinuclear complex {[Ho2(H2L)(H3L)(NO3)2(H2O)2](NO3)} 2.5H2O (3\u00b72.5H2O) is isolated. The three complexes were unequivocally characterized by X-ray diffraction techniques, and their magnetic properties were analyzed. Thus, while the Dy4 and Ho2 complexes do not show magnet-like behavior even in the presence of an external magnetic field, 2\u00b72H2O is a single molecule magnet, with an Ueff barrier of 61.2 K (43.2 cm\u22121). This is the first homonuclear lanthanoid peroxide SMM, which also shows the highest barrier among the reported 4f/3d peroxide zero field SMMs to date.",

Accordingly, this reactivity seems to greatly depend on the metal ion and salt employed. In this way, the reaction of H4Lr with dysprosium(III) chloride in air leads to the oxo-bridged tetranuclear complex [Dy4(H2Lr)3(Cl)4(\u00b53-O)(EtOH)2(H2O)2]\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O (1\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O), while the same reaction just changing the chloride salt by the nitrate one renders the peroxo-bridged pentanuclear compound [Dy5(H2Lr)2(H2.5Lr)2(NO3)4(\u00b53-O2)2]\u00b72H2O (2\u00b72H2O), where both peroxo ligands seem to come from the fixation and reduction of atmospheric oxygen. However, if holmium(III) nitrate is used instead of dysprosium(III) nitrate, no evidence of a peroxide ligand is observed, and the dinuclear complex {[Ho2(H2Lr)(H3Lr)(NO3)2(H2O)2](NO3)} 2.5H2O (3\u00b72.5H2O) is isolated. The three complexes were unequivocally characterized by X-ray diffraction techniques, and their magnetic properties were analyzed. Thus, while the Dy4 and Ho2 complexes do not show magnet-like behavior even in the presence of an external magnetic field, 2\u00b72H2O is a single molecule magnet, with an Ueff barrier of 61.2 K (43.2 cm\u22121). This is the first homonuclear lanthanoid peroxide SMM, which also shows the highest barrier among the reported 4f/3d peroxide zero field SMMs to date.\nKeywords: lanthanoid; SMM; peroxide ligand; N3O2 aminophenol"

            "text": "Molecular magnetism is a growing field in which single-molecule magnets (SMMs) occupy a preferential place. The great interest in SMMs is based on their potential applications, which include ultrahigh-density information storage or quantum computing [1,2]. In contrast to classical magnets, the molecular nature of SMMs offers unique properties that could enable unprecedented information storage speed, and processing densities [2]. The main requirement to achieve this end is the ability to block the magnetization of the molecule at elevated temperatures, a goal that has so far not been achieved. The high intrinsic spin and anisotropy of lanthanoids make them preferred candidates in the search for molecule magnets with enriched properties. Accordingly, since the discovery of the first single ion magnet (SIM) in 2003 [3], the performance of SMMs has steadily improved. Thus, the best functioning magnets are mononuclear DyIII compounds, so that, at present, the blocking temperature (TB) record of 80 K is held by [(CpiPr5)Dy(Cp*)][B(C6F5)4] [4]. However, this kind of metallocene is unstable in air, and the TB record for an air-stable compound is held by [Dy(bmbpen-F)Br] (bmbpen-F = N,N\u2019-bis-(5-methyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N\u2019-bis(5fluoro-2-methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine) [5] at 36 K, although the highest energy barrier\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9061. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24109061 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9061 2 of 16\n(>1800 K) for an air-stable SMM is owned by a DyIII SIM with hexagonal bipyramidal geometry [6]. Therefore, as it is logical, and based on Long\u2019s theory [7], it seems easier to control the anisotropy of mononuclear complexes, which leads to better magnetic results. However, even so, the performance of magnets with more than one metal center is also improving significantly. Thus, it has recently been described that the dinuclear mixed-valent complex [(CpiPr5)2Dy2I3] [8], which features metal-to-metal bonding, shows an enormous coercive magnetic field, and hysteresis up to 80 K, although it is also unstable in air. In addition, the Dy\u2013Sc nitride cluster fullerene Dy2ScN@C80-Ih, with a nitrogen bridge between the DyIII ions, presents an Ueff barrier of ca. 1735 K [9], very close to the record for an air-stable SIM. In addition, among air stable complexes, we have described the phenoxo-bridged dinuclear dysprosium complex with the highest energy barrier for spin reversal for this type of compound to date [10]. This was achieved with an N4O3 aminophenol donor, a ligand that also leads to fluoride-bridged complexes, some of them with unprecedented structural and magnetic features [11]. Accordingly, following this line of work, this paper describes the versatility in the coordination chemistry of a new pentadentate N3O2 aminophenol with DyIII and HoIII, which includes the isolation of a rare DyIII pentanuclear peroxo-complex, and the study of the magnetic properties of all the obtained compounds."

The analytical and spectroscopic studies of H4Lr (Experimental section, and Figure S1) completely agreed with its isolation with high purity.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9061 3 of 16\nthat there is a serie f peroxo-complexes of Gd, Tb, Dy, and Er with the same ligand, but\nn t the Ho one [42]. Accordingly, base on this literature search, in which ot a single\nperoxo-Ho complex was found, the results described h e are not surprising, and, as ex-\npected, the int raction of HoIII with the peroxide l gand does not appear to be favored.\nScheme 1. Synthetic route for the isolation of H4Lr and its metal complexes.\nAttempts were made to determine the origin of the peroxide species. Consequently,\nthe reaction of H4Lr and Dy(NO3)3\u00b76H2O was repeated in a strict inert atmosphere under\nAr. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain single crystals of this sample of sufficient\nquality to be solved. However, the elemental analysis of this compound seems to be in\nagreement with the empirical formula {[Dy2(H2Lr)(H3Lr)(NO3)2(H2O)2](NO3)}\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O\n(4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O), similar to that of the holmium complex 3\u00b72.5H2O. Obviously, in the ab-\nsence of a single crystal structure, it does not make sense to speculate more on the possible\nstructure of this compound, but IR spectroscopy seems to help determine the nature of\nthe species. Thus, the IR spectrum of 2\u00b72H2O (Figure S2) shows a band at 831 cm-1, absent\nin the spectra of the nitrate holmium complex 3\u00b72.5H2O and of the nitrate dysprosium\ncompound 4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O. The position, shape, and intensity of this band seems to agree\nwith the vibration of the peroxide ligand [25,37,38].

The composition of these crystals is approximate, given that SQUEEZE [15] has to be applied due to the great disorder of the trapped solvent. Thus, these crystals seem to lose the ethanol solvate on drying, and the elemental analyses of the dried crystals agree with formula 1\u00b75H2O.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9061 3 of 16\nWhen the aminophenol ligand reacts with dysprosium(III) nitrate instead of chloride, the peroxo-bridged Dy5 complex 2\u00b72H2O is obtained. Nevertheless, if holmium(III) nitrate is used in the place of the dysprosium(III) one, the dinuclear holmium compound 3\u00b72.5H2O, without any evidence of peroxide as ligand, is separated. Accordingly, this indicates that the formation of the peroxo donor is achieved in the presence of nitrate and DyIII but not of HoIII. This may seem somewhat strange since one would expect the chemical behavior of DyIII and HoIII to be similar. In this respect, we should point out that a search was made in CSD [16] for crystallographically characterized peroxo-lanthanoid complexes in which there is no doubt as to the nature of the oxygenated ligand. This search show that homonuclear peroxo-complexes has been obtained from air with CeIV [17\u201322], NdIII [23\u201325], SmIII [26\u201328], EuIII [23,24,26], GdIII [26], TbIII [29], DyIII, [30], YbIII [23,31\u201334], and LuIII [35] ions, in addition to 3d/4f M3Ln3 (M = Ni, Cu or Zn; Ln = Gd, Tb, or Dy) [36,37] and Zn4Ln7 (Ln = Gd, Dy) peroxo compounds [38]. However, as far as we know, no holmium peroxo-complexes have been obtained by interaction with oxygen. In addition, some other lanthanoid peroxo-complexes of the mentioned ions or LaIII have been mostly isolated from peroxides as reagents [39\u201342]. Among these, it is worth noting that there is a series of peroxo-complexes of Gd, Tb, Dy, and Er with the same ligand, but not the Ho one [42]. Accordingly, based on this literature search, in which not a single peroxo-Ho complex was found, the results described here are not surprising, and, as expected, the interaction of HoIII with the peroxide ligand does not appear to be favored. Attempts were made to determine the origin of the peroxide species. Consequently, the reaction of H4Lr and Dy(NO3)3\u00b76H2O was repeated in a strict inert atmosphere under Ar. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain single crystals of this sample of sufficient quality to be solved. However, the elemental analysis of this compound seems to be in agreement with the empirical formula {[Dy2(H2Lr)(H3Lr)(NO3)2(H2O)2](NO3)}\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O (4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O), similar to that of the holmium complex 3\u00b72.5H2O. Obviously, in the absence of a single crystal structure, it does not make sense to speculate more on the possible structure of this compound, but IR spectroscopy seems to help determine the nature of the species. Thus, the IR spectrum of 2\u00b72H2O (Figure S2) shows a band at 831 cm\u22121, absent in the spectra of the nitrate holmium complex 3\u00b72.5H2O and of the nitrate dysprosium compound 4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O. The position, shape, and intensity of this band seems to agree with the vibration of the peroxide ligand [25,37,38]. The presence of this donor is also confirmed by the Raman spectrum, which shows a weak peak at 831 cm\u22121 (Figure S3), whose shape and intensity are similar to that previously described for other lanthanoid peroxo-complexes [18,37]. In addition, the IR spectroscopy seems to indicate that the peroxo group does not form in the absence of air, as this band is not present in the spectrum of 4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O (Figure S2). However, additionally, when the mother liquor from the synthesis of 4\u00b72EtOH\u00b7H2O in inert atmosphere is left in air, a small portion of a new solid 5 precipitates, whose IR spectrum is identical to that of 2\u00b72H2O between 2000 and 500 cm\u22121, and it again shows the presence of the band at 831 cm\u22121 (Figure S4). Accordingly, the peroxide ligand seems to come from air reduction."

The asymmetric unit\nof the crystal contains only half of the complex molecule, the other half being generated by an improper rotation axis (\u2212x + 1, y, \u2212z + \u00bd) passing through Dy3. Thus, each molecule of this neutral complex can be understood as two dinuclear [Dy(H2Lr)(NO3)(\u00b52-O2)Dy(H2.5Lr)(NO3)]1.5- blocks (Figure 6), which join a fifth Dy3+ ion (Dy3) betwee them, using four phenolate groups (on per aminophenol ligand, O11 and O21), and the two (one per block) peroxide ligands (O1-O2), as shown in Figure 7. This leads to the aminophenol acting as a \u00b52 bridge but in a different way (\u00b52-\u03ba5:\u03ba1, Figure 7) from 1.\nFigure 6.

Thus, in these dinuclear entities, the dysprosium atoms\nare nonacoordinated, in N3O6 environments. Calculations with the SHAPE program (Ta-\nble S3) [43] indicate that the geometry around the dysprosium atoms is spherical capped\nsquare antiprism.\nThe central dysprosium atom (Dy3, see Figure 7) is in a highly distorted O8 environ-\nment.

In addition, the\ndysprosium ions within the dinuclear subunits bridged by the O22\u2212 donor are at distances\nDy1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy2 of 4.2636(6) \u00c5, with Dy1-Operoxide-Dy2 angles of ca. 129\u00b0.

Both blocks are similar (Figure 9),\nthe main difference being that in 3.1 one of the phenolic oxygen atoms is protonated, while\nin 3.2 both are deprotonated. Apart from this difference, in 3.1 and 3.2, the pentadentate\nligand acts as usual, using its N3O2 donor set to link the DyIII center.\nIn turn, the respective dinuclear blocks can be considered constructed from two mononuclear units, [Dy(H2.5Lr)(NO3)]0.5\u2212 and [Dy(H2Lr)(NO3)]\u2212, which contain Dy1 and Dy2, respectively. The main difference between the units lies in the fact that one of the phenolic oxygen atoms (O12) is semi-protonated in one of the units but not in the other. At the same time, in each mononuclear unit, the aminophenol ligand links a DyIII center in its N3O2 pocket, as in 1. Each metal center also binds a nitrate ligand, which acts as a bidentate chelate donor (Figure 6). In addition, both oxygen atoms of the peroxide group (O1 and O2) are coordinated in side-on mode to the two dysprosium atoms, with a partial coordination mode \u00b52-\u03ba2:\u03ba2 in each dinuclear block (Figure 6). Thus, in these dinuclear entities, the dysprosium atoms are nonacoordinated, in N3O6 en ironments. Calculations with the SHAPE program (Table S3) [43] indicate that the geometry around the dysprosium atoms is spherical capped square antiprism. The central dysprosium atom (Dy3, see Figure 7) is in a highly distorted O8 environment. This is achieved by means of the four mentioned bridging phenolate O-atoms, and two peroxide ligands acting as \u00b53-\u03ba2:\u03ba2:\u03ba2 bridges, and according to SHAPE measurements (Table S3) [43], this environment can be described as a biaugmented trigonal prism. The coordination mode of the O22\u2212 ligand is quite common for lanthanoid complexes with peroxide as donor [25,36\u201338,42], and all the distances between this donor and the pentadentate ligand are within their normal ranges [10,13,14,36\u201338,42]. In addition, the dysprosium ions within the dinuclear subunits bridged by the O22\u2212 donor are at distances Dy1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy2 of 4.2636(6) \u00c5, with Dy1-Operoxide-Dy2 angles of ca. 129\u25e6. A double hydrogen bond between one oxygen atom of the nitrate group joined to Dy1 and one amine nitrogen atom joined to Dy2 an vice versa (Figure 6) a so contribute to shor ening this distance. Dy1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy3 and Dy2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy3 are triple bridged by the peroxide and one phenol oxygen atom (Figure 7). This leads to shorter Dy1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy3 and Dy2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Dy3 distances, ca. 3.6 \u00c5, with Dy-O-Dy angles in the range 97.6\u2013103.1\u25e6.

Thus, a significant quantum channel is observed in this SMM. Attempts were made to compare these data with those of related lanthanoid peroxide SMMs, and the results are shown in Table 1. Accordingly, a search from CSD data [23] shows that there are not many crystallographically characterized lanthanoid peroxo-complexes, and among them, there are only seven whose behavior as a molecule magnet has been fully studied (Table 1) [36\u201338,42]. Additionally, there is another trinuclear neodymium compound that the authors say is a SMM, but they do not report any barrier, and actually the studies are done in a 1000 Oe field [25]. In addition, a Dy6Na2 metal complex with slow relaxation of the magnetization but without reported energy barrier has also been published [32].\nFor the seven complexes mentioned (Table 1), the coordination mode of the peroxide ligand is \u00b53-\u03ba2:\u03ba2:\u03ba2, as in 2\u00b72H2O. Among these compounds, six are heteronuclear, and those ZnxLny complexes can be really considered as diluted samples, given that the presence of zinc in heteronuclear Zn-Ln coordination compounds is well known to have a similar effect to magnetic dilution [45\u201347]. Thus, the comparison of the data in Table 1 clearly shows that 2\u00b72H2O is the first homonuclear 4f-peroxide SMM, given that the three other peroxide compounds with 4f elements being SMMs are mixed 3d/4f systems ([Zn4Dy7(L1)8(O2)2(OH)4(Cl)4(H2O)4]Cl, [Cu3Tb3(L2)3(O2)(PyCO2)3](OH)2(ClO4)2 and [Dy3Ni3(H2O)3(mpko)9(O2)(NO3)3](ClO4)). Besides, 2\u00b72H2O is the SMM with the highest zero-field barrier for all compounds, and this barrier is even higher than those for non-diluted samples with slow relaxation of magnetization and SMM-like behavior at different external fields. As previously discussed, the \u03c7\u2032\u2032M vs. T plot for 2\u00b72H2O (Figure S8) indicates the existence of QTM, and this quantum channel can also be the reason for the non-observation of SMM behavior in 1\u00b75H2O and 3\u00b72.5H2O. Therefore, efforts have been made to eliminate this quantum channel. Thus, new ac measurements were recorded under different external dc fields at 3 K for 1\u00b75H2O and 3\u00b72.5H2O and at 6 K for 2\u00b72H2O. However, the application of different magnetic fields at 3 K did not lead to peaks in the \u03c7\u2032\u2032M vs. frequency curves\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9061 12 of 16\n(Figure S9). Despite this, the field that leads to the slowest relaxation time was calculated (Figure S8), which is 2000 Oe. Accordingly, new measures were performed for 1\u00b75H2O and 3\u00b72.5H2O under this magnetic field at 8000 and 10,000 Hz as a function of the temperature, but no peaks were observed (Figure S10). For 2\u00b72H2O, the application of an external dc field does not improve the magnetic results (Figure S11), given that the highest relaxation time is obtained in the absence of any field. Therefore, it seems that an external field is unable to destroy or reduce the QTM effect for any of the complexes."

            "text": "The coordination chemistry of the new potentially pentadentate N3O2 aminophenol H4Lr with DyIII and HoIII was investigated. The crystal structures of the complexes reported herein show a high versatility of this ligand when it coordinates to LnIII ions, with three different coordination modes. In addition, this chemistry greatly depends on the metal ion and salt employed. Accordingly, the oxo-bridged chloride Dy4 complex 1\u00b75H2O is isolated when hydrated dysprosium(III) chloride is used as the starting salt, but the Dy5 peroxide compound 2\u00b72H2O is obtained when the employed salt is dysprosium(III) nitrate. This peroxide ligand is not formed if DyIII is changed by HoIII, and this later produces the Ho2 complex 3\u00b72.5H2O. The experiments carried out seem to indicate that the peroxide ligand in 2\u00b72H2O comes from air reduction. This latter complex is the first homonuclear peroxide lanthanoid SMM, with an energy barrier of 61.2 K. This barrier is the highest one reported to date among the scarcely reported zero-field peroxide SMMs containing a 4f metal, and among the few examples of peroxide Ln-containing complexes that present SMM-like behavior under a magnetic field, without a dilution-like magnetic effect. Accordingly, this work contributes not only to the knowledge of the coordination chemistry of lanthanoids with flexible pentadentate aminophenol donors but also to increasing the limited number of compounds containing a 4f ion with a peroxide ligand that behave as magnets, either at zero field or in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms24109061/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: J.C.-V.\u2014investigation and conceptualization; P.O.-M.\u2014investigation; D.N.-P. investigation; A.M.G.-D.\u2014methodology (X-ray diffraction studies); J.S.-M.\u2014supervision; M.F.\u2014conceptualization, supervision, writing\u2014original draft preparation and revision.
