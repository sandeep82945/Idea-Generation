            "text": "The enhancement of the photoluminescence of quantum dots induced by an optical nanoantenna has been studied considerably, but there is still significant interest in\noptimizing and miniaturizing such structures, especially when accompanied with an experimental demonstration. Most of the realizations use plasmonic platforms, and some also use all-dielectric nanoantennas, but hybrid dielectric-plasmonic (subwavelength) nanostructures have been very little explored. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate single subwavelength hybrid dielectric-plasmonic optical nanoantennas coupled to localised quantum dot emitters that constitute efficient and bright unidirectional photon sources under optical pumping. To achieve this, we devised a silicon nanoring sitting on a gold mirror with a 10nm gap in-between, where an assembly of colloidal quantum dots is embedded. Such a structure supports both (radiative) antenna mode and (non-radiative) gap mode resonances, that we exploit for the dual purpose of outcoupling the light emitted by the quantum dots into the far-field with out-of-plane directivity, and for enhancing the excitation of the dots by the optical pump. Moreover, almost independent control of the resonance spectral positions can be achieved by simple tuning of geometrical parameters such as the ring inner and outer diameters, allowing to conveniently adjust these resonances with respect to the quantum dots emission and absorption wavelengths. Using the proposed architecture, we obtain experimentally average fluorescence enhancement factors up to 654\u00d7 folds mainly due to high radiation efficiencies, and associated to a directional emission of the photoluminescence into a cone of \u00b117\u00b0 in the direction normal to the sample plane. We believe the solution presented here to be viable and relevant for the next-generation of light-emitting devices."

            "text": "With the constant effort for miniaturizing light-emitting devices, new nanoscale light-emitting diodes (also known as \"nano-LEDs\") and on-chip single photon sources with subwavelength dimensions, typically below 1\u00b5m in the visible range, are more and more on-demand, for applications like advanced display, optical communications or quantum technologies. A promising way to create efficient and bright photon sources is to enhance the photoluminescence (fluorescence) of quantum emitters (such as quantum dots) with optical nanoantennas, which are optically resonant nanostructures designed to control and boost the light-matter interactions at the nanoscale through extreme confinement of the light field.1 This process is otherwise very inefficient due to impedance mismatch between the optical cross-sections of quantum emitters and the wavelength of light.2\nIn general, fluorescence enhancement can be achieved via three different mechanisms,1 such as local enhancement of the pump field intensity to enhance the excitation of the fluorescent emitters by the incident pump, modifying the electromagnetic environment via the local density of optical states (also known as \u201cPurcell effect\u201d) to make the light emission process faster and/or more efficient, and shaping the emitted fluorescence towards the collection system to increase the collected signal. The optical nanoantennas used for fluorescence enhancement usually aim to leverage on combining part of \u2014 if not all \u2014 these mechanisms.\nTo date, the platforms that provide the highest fluorescence enhancements are plasmonic nanoparticle-on-mirror (also known as nanopatch optical antennas),3 in which the quantum emitters are embedded in the narrow gap formed between a subwavelength plasmonic nanoparticle and a metallic mirror. This architecture was first pinpointed theoretically for the large Purcell factor they can provide,4 in order to dramatically accelerate the spontaneous emission process of the quantum emitters. It was later realized experimentally,5 with many subsequent realizations.6\u201310 However, these plasmonic nanopatch antennas work best for sub-10 nm gap, which is suitable for the purpose of enhancing the fluorescent signal from small molecules, but not for e.g. modern colloidal quantum dots which are much more rele-\nvant for the creation of photon sources due to their stability, but are also much bigger with typical diameters \u223c 10 nm, and thus cannot be integrated in such small gaps.2 Moreover, they suffer from absorption losses of their metal parts, that ideally must be reduced in order to improve the radiative efficiency of these nanoantennas (also called quantum efficiency or quantum yield), defined as the probability that the excitation of the quantum emitters results in a photon emitted in the far-field, which is estimated between 20\u2212 50%.1\nAs an alternative solution, all-dielectric nanoantennas, made of low-loss and high-refractive\nindex materials, ensure higher radiative efficiencies and more flexibility for controlling the emission directivity and enhancing the emission of magnetic emitters.11 Nevertheless, despite providing in theory relatively high enhancement factors in comparison with plasmonic antennas for larger gaps,12 these realizations are usually far from the record-breaking performances of plasmonic nanopatch antennas.13,14 This field has also mainly been driven by single molecule microscopy rather than photonic integration.\nHybrid dielectric-plasmonic structures aim to take the best of both worlds, that is the field enhancement and confinement of plasmonic structures and the low losses and greater flexibility of dielectric structures to tune the resonances and shape the directivity.15,16 Most of them typically involve micron-scaled hybrid bullseye antennas17\u201320 to demonstrate high directivity, but such systems cannot be shrunk down to subwavelength sizes by nature. More recently, a particularly interesting design was put forward in the context of nanoparticle-onmirror antennas with subwavelength size, consisting in a dielectric nanodisk sitting on top of a metallic mirror, with, in theory, high Purcell factor, quantum efficiency, and directional emission.21 Two subsequent experimental works demonstrated the relevance and potential of such a hybrid platform by enhancing the photoluminescence of quantum dots located in the gap formed between a silicon nanosphere and a gold mirror,22,23 essentially leveraging on the Purcell effect to boost the emission process, but without considering directivity control. The absence of more experimental demonstrations with subwavelength nanoantennas could be because the integration of emitters with the nanoantenna is on its own a very complex prob-\nlem, usually requiring either precise manipulation24\u201329 or precise measurement of existing emitters location.30\nIn this work, we design a silicon hollow disk (i.e. a nanoring) antenna sitting on top of a gold mirror, forming a nanogap of about \u223c 10 nm, within which colloidal quantum dots are embedded. We thus obtained self-localised emitters, present underneath the nanoantenna only, alleviating the problem of quantum emitters localisation. Silicon nanorings present strong scattering properties, with geometrically tunable resonances (also called \u201cMie resonances\u201d) that provide control over the scattering strength and directivity, with potential ability to tailor the emission of electric or magnetic dipole emitters,31\u201334 but it is generally difficult to efficiently couple an assembly of emitters. Our hybrid nanopatch antenna allows us to achieve an efficient coupling due to the presence of two classes of resonant modes: strongly radiative modes that also provide out-of-plane directivity (called \"antenna modes\" hereafter), similar to the standalone nanoring resonances but with much better coupling strengths with the QDs due to the presence of the mirror; and weakly radiative modes confined in the gap between the particle and the mirror21,35 (called \"gap modes\" hereafter; these two classes of modes are also discussed in related configurations, see e.g.36). We also find that these two types of modes can be spectrally tuned, almost independently from each other, by simply varying the nanoring geometrical parameters, such as its inner and outer diameters. By carefully designing these parameters to match the antenna mode and gap mode resonances with the emission wavelength of our quantum dots and the excitation wavelength of the pump laser, respectively, we demonstrate experimentally a directional fluorescence enhancement over 650 into a cone of \u00b117\u00b0 in the direction normal to the surface, compared to the rather isotropic emission of quantum dots on gold film. We clearly identify the main mechanisms responsible for the total enhancement, by the use of analytical and quasi-normal mode frameworks in conjunction with full-waves simulations, to be a combination of radiative, excitation, and directivity enhancements. Overall, the hybrid dielectric-plasmonic nanoantenna reported here presents multi-resonances with strong local\nfield confinement, scattering and directivity properties, that can be used with the association of an active medium (e.g. quantum dots) to create efficient, bright and directional photon sources."

We use CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as quantum emitters, which have a strong electric dipole transition, with an emission centered around 650 nm.37 A transmission electron microscope image of the QDs is shown in Fig. 1c, with QD sizes of the order of \u223c 10 nm. Their photoluminescence and absorption spectra measured in solution or on top of a glass substrate are given in Supp. Info. Section 1, Fig. S1.\nA basic model of their energy levels can be found in Supp. Info. Section 1, Fig. S2, which constitutes the fluorescence model used to interpret our experimental results, and the basis on which most fluorescence experiments are analysed. In a reference configuration (chosen to be e.g. QDs deposited on a substrate), we associate a rate to each transition between different energy levels, namely an excitation rate \u03b30exc induced by the excitation from a laser pump at the excitation wavelength \u03bbexc (and directly proportional to its intensity), an intrinsic nonradiative decay rate \u03b30nr due to non-radiative decay channels present in the emitter (such as vibrations or other non-radiative relaxation channels) and a radiative decay rate \u03b30r associated to the spontaneous emission of a photon of emission wavelength \u03bbem (Fig. S2a). One can then characterize the emitter by its intrinsic quantum yield, defined as QY0 \u2261 \u03b30r /(\u03b3 0 r + \u03b3 0 nr), which quantifies the radiation efficiency (i.e. the probability that the excitation of the emitter actually results in the emission of a photon in the far field). In the nanoantenna\nconfiguration, we assume that its presence does not modify the intrinsic non-radiative decay rate \u03b30nr, but does modify the other rates, which becomes \u03b3 0 exc \u2192 \u03b3exc(r) for the excitation rate and \u03b30r \u2192 \u03b3r(r) for the radiative decay rate (Fig. S2b). In addition, the nanoantenna introduces a new decay channel (highlighted by the dashed line in Fig. S2b), which is the possibility that the emitted photon gets absorbed by the nanoantenna and lost in terms of heat, for which we associate an absorption decay rate \u03b3abs(r). Note that the r dependence meaning that these rates now depend on the spatial location of the emitter \u2014 while in the reference configuration they are usually not position-dependent. For a low-loss dielectric nanoantenna as the one used in this work, this absorption channel is expected to be small. The quantum yield of the emitter is thus modified as QY(r) = \u03b3r(r)/[\u03b3r(r) + \u03b30nr + \u03b3abs(r)].\nThe reference configuration considered in this work consists in a monolayer of QDs deposited on the gold mirror; we call it the \u201cReference\u201d hereafter. An SEM image of the relatively homogeneous distribution of QDs after spin-coating can be seen in Fig. 1d. Note that in order to prevent quenching by the gold mirror and to protect from the subsequent CVD deposition of the aSi nanoantenna (see Methods section), the QDs were sandwiched between two ultra-thin layers of Al2O3 (we denote this configuration by Au/Al2O3/QDs/Al2O3). The overall thickness of the three layers is \u223c 10 nm. Importantly, the quantum yield of the QDs in the Reference situation was found to be QY0 = 3.8\u00d710\u22123, drastically decreased compared to the value for QDs in solution (QY0 = 0.29). This observation is similar to what has been reported in Ref.,38 however in our case the decrease is not due to quenching by the gold mirror, but instead to some degradation that happens during the deposition of the second protective layer of Al2O3 (more details are given in Methods section). Finally, all the QDs which were not precisely located between the Au mirror and aSi nanoantenna were etched out; hence, we managed to create spatially self-aligned and localized QDs in a nanogap of g \u2248 10 nm, without requiring any complex emitter manipulation or characterization, similar to what was previously reported.38\nWe first simulated the near-field optical response of our nanoantenna in Fig. 1e, which\nshows the norm of electric field |E| average in the middle plane of the nanogap (see Methods section for the simulation details), for a nanodisk with varying outer diameter Dout (lower half), and for a nanoring with varying inner diameter (or hole diameter) Din (upper half). In both cases the height of the nanoantenna is fixed at H = 230 nm. One can see that while all modes are red-shifted as Dout increases, the modes labelled by \u03b1i are blue-shifted as Din increases, while the modes labelled by ni do not vary. As discussed in more details later, these modes pertained to two distinct classes: the modes \u03b1i correspond to \"antenna modes\", which have strong radiative properties, and the modes ni correspond to \"gap modes\", mostly confined in the gap between the nanoantenna and the gold mirror, and much less radiative. As we will see in the following, because of the presence of these two classes of modes \u2014 the antenna modes which are strongly sensitive to Din, and the gap modes which are mostly sensitive to Dout \u2014 we are able to almost independently control the spectral positions of both types of resonances, allowing us to adapt the design to match the emission and excitation wavelengths of the QDs and the pump laser, respectively. Another route towards independent control these two types of resonances is to vary the height H of the nanoantenna, as shown in Supp. Info. Section 2, Fig. S3 (for a closely related configuration, also see36). In this work, we choose to set the height at H = 230 nm and the outer diameter Dout = 380 nm to have one main strongly radiative antenna mode around the QD emission wavelength of 650 nm (mode \u03b11 in Fig. 1e) and a gap mode resonance that can be exploited for excitation enhancement around 570 nm (mode n3 in Fig. 1e), while Din is used as \"node\" to spectrally tune the antenna resonances with respect to the gap mode resonances (as can be seen in the upper half of Fig. 1e).\nWe next designed and fabricated the aSi nanorings to have a fixed outer diameter of Dout \u2248 380 nm and a fixed height of H \u2248 230 nm, and varying inner diameters Din (ring hole) between Din \u2248 60 nm to Din \u2248 140 nm (SEM images of the nanorings are shown as insets in Fig. 1f). We characterized their far-field optical response by dark-field scattering measurements (see Methods section). Experimental scattering intensity spectra are shown\nin Fig. 1f and reveal that the scattering features are blue-shifted with increasing Din, in agreement with the antenna modes behavior (while the gap modes are not really seen in the far-field as they do not radiate much).\nQuasi-normal mode analysis of the antenna modes\nIn order to better understand the features appearing in the near-field spectra of Fig. 1e, we computed the resonant modes E\u03b1 of the system as well as their complex eigenwavelengths \u03bb\u03b1 = \u03bb \u2032 \u03b1 + i\u03bb\u2032\u2032 \u03b1 , with \u03b1 labelling the mode, using quasi-normal mode (QNM) calculations39 (see Methods section for the calculation details). We identified that the main features appearing in the near-field spectra are associated to the excitation of three particular antenna modes, labelled \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 (the real part of their eigenwavelengths \u03bb\u2032\u03b1, called resonance wavelength, is shown in Fig. 1e by olive green dashed lines).\nFor the nanoring, the mode \u03b11 presents a higher Q-factor of about Q \u223c 30 compared to\nthe modes \u03b12 and \u03b13 with Q \u223c 10 and Q \u223c 20, respectively (calculated as Q = \u03bb\u2032\u03b1/(2\u03bb \u2032\u2032 \u03b1 )). Moreover, its spectral position is more shifted as with Din varies than for the two other QNMs, as can be seen in Fig. 1e, allowing for a higher degree of tunability. For these reasons, we choose the antenna mode resonance \u03b11 for the purpose of enhancing the emission of the QDs. The field profile of this mode |E\u03b1|, shown as insets in Fig. 2a, reveals that most of the electric field is located inside the hole of the nanoring, which explains why this mode is highly sensitive to the parameter Din, which is not the case for the other modes \u03b12 and \u03b13 (not shown here).\nIt is interesting to make a comparison with the case of a standalone nanoring in free space; Fig. 2a shows the resonance wavelength vs Din in the case of the nanoring in free space (green dots).One can see that that the presence of the metallic mirror (red dots, same as \u03b11 in Fig. 1e), in addition to contributing to slightly blue-shifting its spectral position compared to the standalone case (green dots), contributes to more than doubling the Q-\nfactor of the mode \u03b11 (see inset in Fig. 2a with same color code). We also calculated the Purcell factor associated to this mode (called \"modal Purcell factor\"), for the nanoring in free space and in the presence of the metallic mirror, according to the formula:\nF\u03b1(r) = 6\u03c0c3\n\u03c9\u20323 \u03b1\nQ\u03b1Re ( 1\nV\u03b1(r)\n)\n(1)\nwith c being the speed of light in vacuum. The modal Purcell factor quantifies the coupling of an emitter located at position r with QNM \u03b1, and corresponds to the decay rate enhancement due to this mode compared to a homogeneous background (free space is considered here), for a perfect matching of the emission frequency of the emitter with the (real part of the) QNM eigenfrequency. The mode volume V\u03b1(r) associated with this QNM, and appearing in Eq. (1), is given by the relation:39,40\nV\u03b1(r) = 1\n2\u01eb0 (E\u03b1(r) \u00b7 u) 2\n(2)\nwith \u01eb0 being the vacuum permittivity. One can see from Eq. 2 that the volume quantifies the interaction between electric dipole emitters with dipole orientation along unit vector u and the QNM field E\u03b1(r) at the position of the emitter r = (x, y, z). The smaller the mode volume, the stronger the interaction.39,40\nFigs. 2b and c show the spatial distribution of the modal Purcell factor associated with the antenna mode \u03b11, across the horizontal plane located 5 nm underneath the ring, in the case of a nanoring with Din = 60 nm (which is the case discussed hereafter in the main text), for dipoles oriented out-of-plane (i.e. perpendicular to the plane, denoted by the symbol \u22a5) and dipoles oriented in-plane (i.e. parallel to the plane, denoted by the symbol \u2016).\nOne can see that in the presence of the mirror (Fig. 2b), it is the out-of-plane dipoles that mostly couple to this mode, within a much larger area (that forms a circular \u201cband\u201d surrounding the hole of the nanoring as seen in the left panel of Fig. 2b), with a maximum modal Purcell factor reaching a value of F\u03b1 = 27.4. For the standalone nanoring case\n(Fig. 2c), it is mostly the in-plane dipoles that couple to this mode, and only within a small area (located right underneath the hole of the nanoring as seen in the right panel of Fig. 2c). In practice, since it is very challenging to control the position and orientation of the emitters precisely, the PL signal coming from the assembly of emitters is averaged out over emitters spatially distributed over the nanoantenna area with random dipole orientations. Therefore, QDs coupled to a nanoring on top of a metallic mirror is expected to give a significantly higher PL enhancement compared to the case of a standalone nanoantenna, due to higher coupling strengths and the more spatially \u201cextended\u201d coupling."

            "text": "It is not very convenient to identify the gap modes using QNM computations because in the spectral region around and below 600 nm, the number of QNMs is very large and they are not spectrally well separated, which makes their analysis quite tedious. Instead, we use a more intuitive analytical approach to find the gap mode resonances, based on geometrical considerations only. As mentionned in Yang et al. 21 , the gap resonances of our system can be understood as \u201cthe surface plasmon of a planar multilayer metal-dielectric system restricted to specific quantized wavectors\u201d. The cylindrical symmetry of our system implies that resonances can be labeled with indices (n,m), enumerating field variations in the radial and azimuthal directions, respectively. The wavevectors kmn are \u201cquantized\u201d due to the geometry of the nanoantenna, which reflects the surface plasmon at its boundary, similarly to the modes of a Fabry-Perot type resonator.35,41\u201343\nThe resonance wavelengths, denoted \u03bbmn, thus have a geometric origin and read (in the\ncase of a disk):35\n\u03bbmn = 2\u03c0\nkmn with kmnDout + \u03c6 = 2Jmn (3)\nwhere kmn is the real part of the surface plasmon polariton wavevector k (whose multilayer dispersion relation is given in Supp. Info. Section S3), Dout is the diameter of the disk, Jmn is\nthe nth zero of the Bessel\u2019s function of the first kind of order m with m the azimuthal number, and \u03c6 is a reflection phase that depends upon the structural and material parameters.41 These gap mode resonances are thus spectrally tunable by simply varying the diameter of the particle Dout. Moreover, since these gap modes are strongly confined inside the nanogap, they can be exploited for local enhancement of the pump field intensity, and hence for excitation enhancement of the QDs.\nWe make use of Eq. (3) in the case of the ring as a first approximation \u2014 even if it strictly holds for a plain disk only \u2014 to calculate the gap resonance wavelengths in our system. Due to the symmetry of the pump field that we will use in this work (normal incidence and linearly polarized), only the modes with m = 1 can be excited. In Fig. 1e, we show the resonance wavelengths \u03bb12 and \u03bb13 (dashed lines in white color and labelled n2 and n3, respectively \u2014 the mode n = 1 being outside of the wavelength range of interest), obtained by applying Eq. (3) with \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/2 and \u03c6 = 0, respectively (reflection phase values were chosen to closely match these analytically calculated resonance wavelengths with the features appearing in the near-field spectra simulations of Fig. 1e; also, since these reflection phases are related to the extension of the plasmon field beyond the particle terminations,41 it should not be too surprising that different modes pick up different reflection phases). One can see indeed that there is almost no changes when increasing the inner diameter of the ring Din, which justify the use of this equation even in the case of a ring (especially as inner diameter remains small). In particular, for Dout = 380 nm, we have the following resonance wavelengths: \u03bb12 = 625 nm and \u03bb13 = 574 nm. In the following, we use n3 mode to enhance the excitation of the QDs, because the spectral position of n2 overlaps with the emission of the QDs (see Supp. Info. Fig. S1), making it difficult to distinguish the emission from the pump in the PL signal."

            "heading": "Fluorescence enhancement results",
            "text": "In the following, we present the results obtained for the selected nanoring with Din = 60 nm (shown by blue arrows line in Fig. 1e), which we call \u201cAntenna\u201d hereafter, for which we obtained the highest total fluorescence enhancement experimentally. To characterize the total fluorescence enhancement of the QDs in the Antenna situation compared to the Reference one (denoted by the superscript \u201c0\u201d hereafter), we use the well established fact that, in the low excitation regime, the fluorescence enhancement per emitter (located at position r) is proportional to the gains in excitation rate, collection efficiency and quantum yield:1,5,44,45\nEFth(r) = \u03b3exc(r)\n\u03b30exc Dem(r) D0em QY(r) QY0\n(4)\nThe excitation rate \u03b3exc (previously introduced) is directly proportional to the local enhancement of the pump intensity at the position of the emitter r, and depends therefore on the wavelength used for the pump laser \u03bbexc. The directivity (or collection efficiency) Dem, which corresponds to the collected signal into a given numerical aperture (NA), thus depends on the collection NA, denoted by NAcol, and also on the wavelength of fluorescent emission \u03bbem. Finally, the emitter quantum yield QY (previously introduced) also depends on the emission wavelength \u03bbem. Note that all of these quantities are defined for a single electric dipole emitter at a given position r and also having a fixed orientation of its dipole moment along the unit vector u, but for the sake of readability, we omit the dependence on the parameter u in the above quantities. Also, it is interesting to note from Eq. (4) that the total fluorescence enhancement EFth depends on the type of emitter used in the Reference situation through its intrinsic quantum yield QY0, and is thus not an absolute figure-of-merit to characterize the performance of a given antenna.\nHowever, in our case where the QDs have a very small intrinsic quantum yield QY0 \u226a 1,\nwe have \u03b30r \u226a \u03b3 0 nr (here \u03b3 0 r \u223c 10 \u22123 \u03b30nr), and further assuming that the that the decay rate enhancement in the presence of the nanoantenna is such that \u03b3r(r) + \u03b3abs(r) \u226a \u03b30nr, we have\n\u03c4(r)/\u03c4 0 \u2248 1, where we further introduce the fluorescence lifetimes defined as \u03c4(r) \u2261 1/[\u03b3r(r)+ \u03b30nr+\u03b3abs(r)] and \u03c4 0 \u2261 1/(\u03b30r +\u03b3 0 nr) in the nanoantenna and reference situations, respectively. Using the fact that QY(r)/QY0 = [\u03b3r(r)/\u03b30r ][\u03c4(r)/\u03c4 0], we thus have QY(r)/QY0 \u2248 \u03b3r(r)/\u03b30r , and Eq. (4) can be recast into the following form, which is independent of the type of emitter and will be more convenient for our purpose of characterising the underlying mechanisms at play in our nanoantenna:44\nEFth(r) \u2248 \u03b7exc(r, \u03bbexc)\u00d7 \u03b7em(r, \u03bbem,NAcol) (5)\nIn Eq. (5), we defined the quantities \u03b7exc \u2261 \u03b3exc/\u03b30exc and \u03b7em \u2261 (Dem/D 0 em)(\u03b3r/\u03b3 0 r ), which quantify the enhancements in excitation and emission, respectively, and we made the dependence in terms of \u03bbexc, \u03bbem and NAcol of the terms \u03b7exc and \u03b7em explicit. Applying Eq. (5) to the case of our Antenna to each QD and averaging over QDs positions and orientations gives a theoretical fluorescence enhancement factor of \u3008EFth\u3009 = 1263, for an excitation source coming at normal incidence and linearly polarized, and for a collection in a single direction, i.e. the upward direction (see Methods section and Supp. Info. Section S4 for more details). The excitation and emission wavelengths used in the simulations, that is \u03bbexc = 583 nm and \u03bbem = 680 nm, were obtained by optimizing the excitation and emission separately (see next sections).\nExcitation enhancement and gap resonance. Experimentally, we first searched for the excitation wavelength \u03bbexc that maximizes the PL. For that, we recorded the PL signal as we varied the pump wavelength \u03bbexc from 488 to 588 nm, while maintaining a constant pump power, by collecting the light radiated into air using an objective lens with NA = 0.9. Even though the QDs absorb shorter wavelength light more efficiently (as shown in Supp. Info. Section S1), optimal pumping conditions for PL enhancement in the Antenna case were found to be at approximately \u03bbexc = 570 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. In all subsequent measurements, we therefore fix the pump wavelength at \u03bbexc = 570 nm.\nWe confirmed with full-wave simulations that there is a maximum for the local field inten-\nsity around 570 nm (exactly at 583 nm), as shown in Fig. 3b (see Methods section for details about the full-wave simulations), which gives an excitation enhancement factor \u3008\u03b7exc\u3009th = 7.3 \u2014 the bracket denoting position and orientation averaging of the QDs. The spectral position of the maximum is in fair agreement with the third order gap mode resonance labelled n3 predicted by the theory at 574 nm (vertical dashed line in Fig. 3b). Moreover, the field intensity in the horizontal cross-section located in the middle of the gap, and in vertical cross-section passing through the middle of the nanoring, shown in Figs 3c, d, respectively, reveal that intensity \u201chot spots\u201d are formed within the nanogap. To better appreciate the match with the theory, we show in the Supp. Info. Section S3, Fig. S5 the vertical field component Ez, which matches the field profile of the gap mode expected in theory with symmetry (n = 3, m = 1) (see Supp. Info. Section S3, Fig. S4a). This corroborates the fact that it is a gap mode resonance that is responsible for the excitation enhancement. Finally, note that the intensity distribution of this gap mode presents a rather good spatial overlap with the area within which the mostly coupled emitters to the antenna mode (exploited for emission enhancement) shown in Fig. 2b.\nEmission enhancement and antenna resonance. We quantify hereafter the emission enhancement in the upward direction, since our nanoantennas radiate mostly in the upward (out-of-plane) direction (see directivity patterns which are given later). For that, we choose to integrate the experimental angle-resolved PL (raw angle-resolved PL spectra can be found in Supp. Info. Section 5 Fig. S7), obtained using back focal plane imaging technique (see Methods section), over a collection NAcol = 0.3, which corresponds approximately to \u00b117\u00b0. Note that we make the choice to integrate over this collection NA (instead of considering strictly a single direction, i.e. the upward direction, like in the simulations) in order to average the noise present in the collection channel. Moreover, in order to obtain the experimental total fluorescence enhancement from these PL spectra, we deconvoluted the PL signal of the\nnanoantenna with the Reference PL, according to the formula:\n\u3008EFexp\u3009 = I\nI0\nA0 A\n(6)\nwhere I (resp. I0) is the PL intensity collected in the nanoantenna situation (resp. in the Reference situation) and A (resp. A0) is the area corresponding to the ring horizontal crosssection that reads A = \u03c0(Dout/2)2 with Dout = 380 nm where the QDs are located (resp. the area of the excitation spot A0 = \u03c0(Dspot/2)2 which is estimated to Dspot \u2243 1.37\u00b5m; see Supp. Info. Section S6, Fig. S8). The obtained experimental total fluorescence enhancement spectrum is plotted in Fig. 4a. One can see one main peak around the central emission wavelength of the QDs which is around 650 nm, at which we get a maximum total fluorescence enhancement factor of \u3008EFexp\u3009 = 654. One can also see a secondary peak around 720 nm.\nWe corroborated this experimental total fluorescence enhancement spectrum with fullwave simulations of the emission enhancement \u3008\u03b7em\u3009 in the upward direction (using reciprocity, see Methods section), because it corresponds to the direction of maximum directivity, and where the bracket denotes once again position and orientation averaging of the QDs. The simulated spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b. One can see a fair agreement with the experiment, with also the presence of two main peaks, at 680 nm and 725 nm in the simulations. The shift of the resonances in the simulations compared to the experiment can be attributed to slight size variations in the height and outer diameter of the ring. Moreover, from the previous mode analysis shown in Fig. 1e, we identify these two resonances with the antenna modes \u03b11 and \u03b13, respectively, as highlighted in Fig. 4b by vertical dashed lines. One can even see a weaker third resonance in-between the main two peaks, which we identify with the antenna mode \u03b12 from Fig. 1e, as highlighted in Fig. 4b. The maximum emission enhancement at the main peak is \u3008\u03b7em\u3009th = 206.2. Note that the value of the averaged total enhancement \u3008EFth\u3009 = 1263 is not strictly equal to the average excitation enhancement \u3008\u03b7exc\u3009th = 7.3 times the average emission enhancement \u3008\u03b7em\u3009th = 206.2, which is totally nor-\nmal and is due to the averaging process. Indeed, \u3008EFth\u3009 6= \u3008\u03b7exc\u3009th \u00d7 \u3008\u03b7em\u3009th in general for spatially inhomogeneous couplings.\nWe show in Fig. 4c (left panel) the experimental back focal plane image of the PL intensity at the wavelength 650 nm, coming from the main peak and associated to the QNM \u03b11 (see Methods section for experimental details). One can see some directivity, compared to the rather isotropic emission from the Reference (right panel). It becomes even clearer when plotting the experimental angular radiation patterns \u2014 obtained as a horizontal cut of Fig. 4c \u2014 in Fig. 4d (left panel), where one can clearly see that the Antenna reshapes the emission into a main lobe oriented in the upward direction (dark lines), in contrast with the rather isotropic emission in the Reference case (light blue lines). The directivity enhancement at this wavelength is calculated to be \u2329\nDem/D0em \u232a exp = 1.43 within NAcol = 0.3\n(see Eq. (9) in Methods section for the formula used).\nWe also computed the radiation patterns (using reciprocity, see Methods section for more details), shown in Fig. 4d (right panel). One can see a good qualitative agreement between experiment and simulation, showing out-of-plane directivity. These simulation results give a simulated directivity enhancement of \u2329\nDem/D0em \u232a th = 1.31 in the upward direction, which\nmatches relatively well with the value extracted from the experimental measurements. We thus deduced by applying the relation (non-rigorous) \u3008\u03b7em\u3009th \u2248 \u2329 Dem/D 0 em \u232a th \u3008\u03b3r/\u03b3 0 r \u3009th that the theoretical average radiative decay rate enhancement (i.e. radiative yield) is \u3008\u03b3r/\u03b30r \u3009th = 157.4."

However, this can be expected if one remembers that Eq. (5) used to estimate the theoretical enhancement factor is valid under the approximation that \u03c4/\u03c4 0 \u2248 1. Based on the experimentally obtained\nvalue from the measured lifetimes with a time-resolved PL setup (see Methods section), we obtain, after fitting the experimental data (see Supp. Info. Section S7), a lifetime reduction of \u3008\u03c4/\u03c4 0\u3009\u22121exp \u2248 2.19, that is \u3008\u03c4/\u03c4 0\u3009exp \u2248 0.46. Therefore, Eq. (5) will overestimate the experimental enhancement factor of roughly a factor of two (non-rigorous), which we found to be the case. A more quantitative estimation of the theoretical average enhancement factor that takes into account the value of the intrinsic quantum yield QY0 provides \u3008EFth\u3009 = 790, in better agreement with the experimental value (see Supp. Info. Section S8). Note that another factor that may contribute to overestimate the experimental enhancement factor is that in theory we calculate it in a single direction, i.e. the upward direction, where the emission is maximum, while in the experiment we average over a NAcol = 0.3 (chosen to average out noise present in the optical setup).\nWe also analyse in Supp. Info. Section S7 the results obtained for two other nanoantennas, called Antenna B and C (the one shown in the main text being called Antenna A in Supp. Info.), having approximately identical outer diameters and heights, but larger inner diameters, namely Din = 80 nm and Din = 110 nm, respectively. We found similarly that the theoretical calculations of the total enhancement factors overestimates the one found in experiment, by roughly the factor corresponding to the lifetime reduction. Moreover, this comparative study between Antennas A, B and C highlights that one can tune (blue-shift) the resonance exploited for emission by varying (increasing) Din with respect to the resonance exploited for absorption, as already anticipated from the mode study in Fig. 1e. We also note that as the inner diameter Din increases, the total emission decreases, in agreement with the calculation of the modal Purcell factor which decreases as well (shown in Supp. Info. and which we recall quantify the coupling of the QDs with the strongly radiative antenna mode).\nFinally, in order to check if our design can accomodate different QDs sizes and types, we simulated the average emission enhancement factor \u3008\u03b7em\u3009th for different nanogap sizes and refractive index of the spacer layer. The results (see Supp. Info. Section S9) reveal that\ndespite variation in terms of resonance strength, the spectral position of the resonances are not really affected, which was also reported in,22 in constrast will all-plasmonic nanopatch antenna for which the resonances are more sensitive, making this hybrid system quite robust for a diversity of active materials."

            "text": "In this work, we experimentally demonstrated an efficient and multi-resonance silicon nanoring on gold mirror nanoantenna coupled to localised quantum dots in a nanogap of \u223c 10 nm, which transformed very poor emitters (with an intrinsic quantum yield of QY0 = 3.8\u00d710\u22123) into bright and directional sources. A total fluorescence enhancement factor of 654\u00d7 was measured, coming from different mechanisms that contributed to increase the brightness of our Antenna. We calculated in theory average enhancements of \u3008\u03b3r/\u03b30r \u3009th = 157.4, \u3008\u03b3exc/\u03b3 0 exc\u3009th = 7.3 and \u2329 Dem/D0em \u232a th = 1.31, for the radiative yield, excitation and directionality, respectively, and we experimentally obtained an average lifetime reduction of \u3008\u03c4/\u03c40\u3009 \u22121 exp = 2.19. One can infer from this analysis that the radiative emission enhancement is the main mechanism responsible for the total fluorescence enhancement observed here, with also non-negligible contribution of the excitation enhancement, and modest collection efficiency gain and lifetime reduction.\nOne particularity of the nanoring antenna is that it supports several resonances with strong scattering properties \u2014 the antenna mode resonances to which the emitters are efficiently coupled \u2014 that increase the radiative rates of emitters and reshape the directionality of emission within a main lobe pointing in the upward direction. These resonance wavelengths can be easily tuned using the ring inner diameter to match with the emission wavelength of the emitters. Furthermore, the metallic mirror creates a nanogap that supports localized modes (gap mode resonances),21,35 whose resonance wavelength mostly depends on the ring outer diameter and therefore can be easily tuned using this parameter, in an\nalmost independent way from the resonances exploited for the emission enhancement. These were used to create intensity \u201chot spots\u201d in the nanogap, leading to an overall gain in the excitation efficiency of the QDs.\nAmong the future improvements that should be carried out on these types of nanoantennas, we would like to mention a few here. First of all, there is a need to pay attention to ensure that the QDs are protected and not degraded by the fabrication process (i.e. not as reported in this work and in Ref.22), in order to guarantee the integrity of the quantum emitters. Secondly, by exploiting lower order gap mode resonances, one could increase the excitation enhancement (by a factor 4 if one makes use of the second order according to our simulations \u2014 not shown here), to potentially bring the total fluorescence to 3 orders of magnitude enhancement, figures reported so far only in all-plasmonic nanopatch antennas. It was not possible in this work because the second order gap mode could not be well separated spectrally from the emission of the QDs, and therefore we exploited a higher order gap mode (third order), which provided more modest excitation enhancement.\nAmong the advantages and potentials of such hybrid structures, we would like to highlight that they could accommodate different QD sizes and could easily be enlarged or shrunk to shift the resonances to near-IR or UV wavelengths. Shifting to near-IR wavelengths would, in principle, be easier because of lower losses in the silicon at those wavelengths, while shifting to UV wavelengths might require using a different material with lower losses in the wavelength range for the ring structure.\nThe experimental demonstration provided in this paper confirms the relevance of nanorings in hybrid dielectric-plasmonic nanostructures as highly tunable nanoantennas with subwavelength size, to create efficient, bright and directional photon sources in the visible spectral range, that can be of foremost importance for the next-generation of light-emitting devices."

After that, a layer of CdSe/ZnS alloyed quantum dots, synthesized according to,37 were spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 1 minute from a solution of 5 mg QDs per ml in toluene. The quantum dots were then covered by another \u2248 3 nm thick layer of alumina, this time using ALD at a temperature of 80\u00b0C. The final Al2O3/QDs/Al2O3 sandwich structure has a total thickness of approximately 10\u221215 nm (ellipsometry measurements estimated the thickness, assuming a homogeneous alumina layer, of 13 nm), prior to patterning the silicon (Si) ring nanoantenna.\nFor the ring structure, we deposited a 230 nm thick film of amorphous silicon by InductionCoupled Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (ICP-CVD, Oxford PlasmaPro 100) at 80\u00b0C from a SiH4 precursor. Hydrogen silsesquioxane e-beam resist (Dow Corning XR-1541-06), spin coated at 5000 rpm for 1 minute and a change dissipation layer (Espacer 300AX01), spin coated at 1500 rpm for 1 minute were used for the Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) writing (Exlionix ELS-7000), with a dose of \u2248 300 mC/cm2. The sample was then developed by a NaOH/NaCl salty solution (1% wt. /4% wt. in de-ionized water) for 60 s and then rinsed by de-ionized water to stop the development. The final structures was created by Induction-Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etching (ICP-RIE, Oxford Plasmalab 100) using chlorine gas, with a slight over etch to etch any quantum dots not protected by the silicon structures. A fabrication process flow schematics can be found in Supp. Info. Section S10, Fig. S14.\nSince the fabrication process exerts thermal and chemical stress that can potentially degrade the QDs,47 we characterized optically the QD layer at all steps of the fabrication process to quantify the changes in photoluminescence (PL) and fluorescence lifetimes (see Supp. Info. Section S10, Fig. S15). While we observed that the quenching is successfully overcome by the presence of the first layer of Al2O3, the intensity of the PL is reduced by almost 98% after depositing the second layer of Al2O3, that is in the configuration Au/Al2O3/QDs/Al2O3 (keeping the same excitation power). Moreover, the time-resolved PL experiments revealed that this drop in PL is correlated with a reduction of the QDs lifetime from \u03c40 = 5.00 ns to \u03c40 = 0.65 ns. From these observations, we estimated that the intrinsic quantum yield drops from QY0 = 0.29 to QY0 = 3.8\u00d710\u22123, and concluded that the QDs are degrading because of thermal stress during the atomic layer deposition process used to deposit the second alumina layer.47"

Incident light was focused on the sample by a 100\u00d7 objective lens with a 0.9NA (Nikon LU Plan Fluor). Signal collected by the same objective lens was then projected onto the spectrograph entrance slit with a width of 250\u00b5m.\n\u2022 Dark-field scattering measurements: For dark-field scattering, white light from a halo-\ngen lamp was used to excite the sample, with the central low-~k portion of the beam blocked from entering the objective lens, meaning only light scattered by the nanoantennas was collected and sent to the spectrograph. Reflectance of an silver mirror was used as the Reference.\n\u2022 Photoluminescence spectroscopy: For photoluminescence measurements, a supercon-\ntinuum source (SuperK Power, NKT Photonics) with band-pass filter (SuperK Varia, NKT Photonics), pulse duration 70 ps, 78 MHz repetition rate was used to excite PL. The band-pass filter was used to scan the pump wavelength from 488 to 588 nm with a 10 nm bandwidth. Average pump power was maintained at \u2248 250\u00b5W. The pump laser was focused onto the sample substrate by the same 100\u00d7 0.9 NA objective lens, resulting in an approximately 1.37\u00b5m diameter laser spot (see Supp. Info. Section S6 for details on the method used to estimate the laser spot size).

Note that \u03c9\u2032\u2032 \u03b1 < 0 due to the convention \u201ce\u2212i\u03c9t\u201d used for the time-harmonic fields. Here, the system is considered nonmagnetic with a vacuum permeability \u00b50, and \u03b5(r, \u03c9) denotes the relative permeability of the medium. the complex eigenwavelengths are defined as \u03bb\u03b1 \u2261 2\u03c0c/\u03c9\u03b1.\nIn order to solve Eq. (7) and obtain the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies in the configurations shown in Fig. 1e, we employed the \u201cQNMEig solver\u201d, developped by IOGSCNRS,49 which, computes and normalizes the QNMs of plasmonic and photonic resonators, implemented using COMSOL Multiphysics. The QNMEig solver needs all dispersive material permittivities to be modelled by a N -pole Lorentz-Drude model, in order to reformulate Eq. (7) into a linear eigenvalue problem (see, for example, Yan et al. 49). The parameters of the Lorentz-Drude model that we used for the dispersive permittivities of amorphous silicon (nanoantenna) and gold (substrate) can be found in Supp. Info. Fig. S11.\n\u2022 Near-field simulations: To compute the near-field, we used the finite-difference time-\ndomain (FDTD) method in Ansys Lumerical FDTD. The Si particle (nanoantenna) in the presence of Au mirror was surrounded by a Total-Field Scattered-Field (TFSF) source, which simulates a plane wave excitation. The distance between the TFSF box\nand nanoantenna was set to be larger than 100 nm. The incident wave was chosen to be linearly polarized and coming at normal incidence from the top of the nanoantenna. The norm of the electric field was recorded in the plane located in the middle of the gap between the silicon nanoring and the gold mirror and then spatially averaged. We considered that the gap was filled with a homogeneous medium of refractive index corresponding to the one of alumina, i.e. n = 1.77.\n\u2022 Excitation enhancement simulations:\nTo compute the term \u03b7exc(r, \u03bbexc) in Eq. (5) shown in Fig. 3, we use the fact that the excitation rate is proportional to the local intensity of the electric field and therefore \u03b7exc(r, \u03bbexc) can be readily expressed as:50\n\u03b7exc(r, \u03bbexc) =\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 u \u00b7 E(r, \u03bbexc)\nu \u00b7 E0(r, \u03bbexc)\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2\n(8)\nwhere we recall that u is a unit vector showing the orientation of the emitter dipole moment, r is the position of the emitter, and E(r) (resp. E0(r)) is the electric field at the emitter position r for a given excitation source in the nanoantenna case (resp. in the Reference case). We computed, using Ansys Lumerical FDTD, and considering as incident illumination a linearly polarized planewave coming at normal incidence from the top of the nanoantenna, the electric field intensity in the horizontal plane (i.e. parallel to the substrate) and located in the middle of the nanogap over an area corresponding to the ring horizontal cross-section. The averaged excitation enhancement \u3008\u03b7exc\u3009 was obtained after averaging over all directions to account for randomly distributed and oriented dipole emitters, and normalizing by the case without Si nanoantenna.\n\u2022 Emission enhancement simulations: The computation of the radiative emission en-\nhancement \u03b7em(r, \u03bbem) from Eq. (5) and shown in Fig. 4 were carried out using the reciprocity principle,51 following the method well described in Ref.52 This method was implemented in Ansys Lumerical FDTD, where planewave sources were used with two\northogonal linear polarizations and at normal incidence to excite the nanoantenna, using the TFSF source tool. Then, the near-field response was recorded in a plane located in the middle of the gap by point monitors, distributed in an area with the same size as the nanoantenna cross-section, and with a density of 3 600\u00b5m\u22122 (i.e. we use approximately 400 point monitors homogeneously distributed below the ring within an area of \u03c0R2 with R = Dout/2 = 190 nm). By reciprocity, the power recorded in each point monitor and calculated from the projection of the electric field along axis i (i = x, y or z) is equal to the emission power of light with the same polarization as the source from a point electric dipole oriented along i and located at the same position as the monitor. To obtain the averaged emission enhancement \u3008\u03b7em\u3009 of the assembly of electric dipoles randomly oriented and distributed uniformly under the nanoantenna, the power over all orientations i and over the spatial distribution of monitors was integrated, averaged over two orthogonal linear polarizations, and normalized to the case without nanoantenna.\n\u2022 Directional enhancement simulations:\nTo obtain the directivity patterns shown in Fig. 4d, we use the same reciprocal simulations as for the emission enhancement simulations, and made a sweep over all angles of incidence. In Fig. 4d, we show the emission angular power distribution (averaged over two orthogonal linear polarizations).\nIn order to quantify the percentage of light that can be collected in the upward direction with given collection NA NAcol, we use the relation (see e.g.53):\nDem =\n\u222b\n2\u03c0\n0\n\u222b\n\u03b8col\n0 p(\u03b8, \u03c6) sin(\u03b8)d\u03b8d\u03c6\n\u222b\n2\u03c0\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c0\n0 p(\u03b8, \u03c6) sin(\u03b8)d\u03b8d\u03c6\n(9)\nwith p(\u03b8, \u03c6) being the angular power radiated into a certain solid angle (parametrized by \u03b8 and \u03c6), and \u03b8col is defined as \u03b8col = sin\u22121(NAcol). We consider only a single direction for the calculated radiation patterns, which is the upward direction, to be\nconsistent with the enhancement spectra shown in Fig. 4b, that is we set \u03b8col = 0 in Eq. (9) (corresponding strictly speaking to NAcol = 0.0). For the experimental directivity measurements, we choose to perform the integration over NAcol = 0.3 in order to average the noise present in the collection channel, as explained in the main text."
