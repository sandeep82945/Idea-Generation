    "abstractText": "The SARS-CoV-2 protease (3CLpro) is one of the key targets for the development of efficacious drugs for COVID-19 treatment due to its essential role in the life cycle of the virus and exhibits high conservation among coronaviruses. Recent studies have shown that flavonoids, which are small natural molecules, have antiviral activity against coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARSCoV-2. In this study, we identified the docking sites and binding affinity of several natural compounds, similar to flavonoids, and investigated their inhibitory activity towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The selected compounds were then tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity, for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and the replication of other coronaviruses in different cell lines. Our results showed that Baicalein (100 \u03bcg/mL) exerted strong 3CLpro activity inhibition (>90%), whereas Hispidulin and Morin displayed partial inhibition. Moreover, Baicalein, up to 25 \u03bcg/mL, hindered >50% of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cultures. Lastly, Baicalein displayed antiviral activity against alphacoronavirus (Feline-CoV) and betacoronavirus (Bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43) in the cell lines. Our study confirmed the antiviral activity of Baicalein against SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated clear evidence of its pan-coronaviral activity.",

            "text": "The pandemic threat, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still affecting people worldwide and viral variants contribute to the periodic rise in COVID-19 cases. Despite the development of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the good degree of immunological protection achieved through vaccination, the mutation of newer variants and the uncertainty about how these detected mutations affect the efficacy of existing anti-spike vaccines have focused research on the development of efficacious drugs for COVID-19 therapeutic intervention. COVID-19 emerged in late December 2019 [1,2] and subsequently SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA of the Coronaviridae family, was shown to be the cause. Based on numerous studies of the pathogenesis and virulence of coronavirus, distinct viral enzymes, namely 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), were designated for exploring the potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs [3\u20135]. In particular, 3CLpro (also known as Mpro) plays a crucial role in viral protein maturation and antagonizes innate immunity [6]. Upon entry\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 314. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020314 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 314 2 of 18\ninto and the uncoating of the SARS-CoV-2 virions, the genomic RNA is translated into two polyproteins, PP1a and PP1ab, which are then cleaved into nonstructural proteins by PL2pro and 3CLpro viral proteases [6]. 3CLpro is responsible for cleaving at eleven sites on the polyproteins processing individual proteins, including the polymerase subunits [6]. Coronavirus 3CLpro remains one of the primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for the following reasons: (i) it has an indispensable role in the proteolytic processing of the viral RNA-polymerase complex, (ii) it is a highly conserved target protein, and (iii) it shares no structural similarity to human proteases [7]. Despite the intense efforts to develop SARS-CoV-2 specific inhibitors [8], only two antiviral agents, authorized by FDA in December 2021, have demonstrated activity in treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk of severe disease, including molnupiravir, an orally available base analogue that can be incorporated into RNA instead of cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate, leading to mutated RNA products [9] and Paxlovid, a co-packaged combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir that acts as a peptidomimetic, covalent, and reversible inhibitor of 3CLpro [10]. The antiviral activity of nirmatrelvir has been reported to not be reduced when treating the SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) [11], confirming the conservation of the sequence of this enzyme among coronaviruses. Regrettably, cases of patients experiencing a rebound in SARS-CoV-2 viral load and symptoms after completing Paxlovid treatment have been documented [12]. Thus, the development of antiviral therapies directed against viral targets with minimal side effects remains highly urgent. In the search for additional therapeutic options, several studies conducted in silico, in vitro, and in vivo showed that small natural molecules belonging to polyphenol family [13,14] have the potential to hinder various steps of coronavirus replication. Furthermore, growing understanding of the possible antiviral mechanisms of flavonoids based on previous studies with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 [15], and the potential activity of flavonoids to ameliorate post-COVID-19 syndrome through their anti-inflammatory properties [16\u201318] underline the relevance of further exploring the anti-coronavirus activities of these compounds. To that end, molecular docking was used to screen and determine the docking patterns and binding affinities of compounds with structural similarities to flavonoids, which are the major targets of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro [19]. Then, an enzymatic assay was employed in order to examine the inhibitory effects of these compounds on 3CLpro. The activity of selected 3CLpro inhibitors in the life cycle of coronavirus was then assessed by evaluating their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and different alpha (Feline-CoV) and beta coronaviruses (Bovine-CoV and HumanCoV-OC43) in vitro."

Other compounds with structural analogy were tested through in silico analyses for possible activity against 3CLpro. The compounds that were found to be active in silico were tested through enzymatic assays. Then, the compounds that were found to be active were tested through an in vitro assay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lastly, in order to investigate possible anti-pan-coronaviral activity, we evaluated these compounds against Feline (F)-CoV, Bovine (B)-CoV, and Human (H)CoV-OC43."

The crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in complex with the non-covalent inhibitor Z1367324110 (PDB ID: 5R81) was selected as a receptor in structure-based virtual screening [49]. To remove any possible structural bias from protein crystallization, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on the 3CL/Z1367324110 crystallographic complex using a previously validated protocol. After 500 ns of unrestrained production of the MD trajectories, the MD frames were clustered using a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm, and the centroid frame of the most populated cluster was selected as representative structure for subsequent structure-based virtual screening. Virtual screening was performed by molecular docking simulations with a FRED docking program [50\u201352]. Coupling visual inspection of the binding modes with analysis of the Chemgauss4 score led to the selection of 12 small molecules as candidate inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. All the identified compounds are plant polyphenolic secondary metabolites belonging to the flavonoid family (Table 1). The basic flavonoid structure exists in a diphenylpropane skeleton (C6\u2013C3\u2013C6), namely the flavan nucleus, where two benzene rings (ring A and B) are linked by a three-carbon chain forming a pyran ring C (Table 1). Based on the degree of unsaturation and the oxidation level of ring C, they can be divided in different subclasses: Morin (1), Quercetin (2), Alnusin (3), Isokaempferide (4), and Galangin (5) are flavonols featuring a 3-hydroxyflavone backbone structure; Steppogenin (6), Sakuranetin (7), and Isosakuranetin (8) are flavanones featuring a flavan backbone; Baicalein (9), Hispidulin (10), and Chrysin (11) are flavones; and Taxifolin (12), which features a 3-hydroxyflavanone backbone, is a flavanonol."

Since all the docked compounds are members of the flavone family, although they bear different substitution patterns, it is not surprising that they bind within the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a highly consistent manner to each other, as well as to the docking-based binding mode of other flavonoids from the literature [62]. Specifically, Morin, Luteolin, and the 7,8-dihydroxyflavone bind with opposite orientations with respect to Baicalein, Hispidulin, and Isokaempferide. The latter of these have the polyhydroxylated ring A of the flavone scaffold projected to the inner core of 3CLpro that is in the proximity of Asn142 (Figure 3). Besides stacking to the side chain of His41, the natural compounds establish H-bond interactions with the backbone of Asn142 (Baicalein, Isokaempferide, and Morin), with the phenolic side chain of Try54 (Luteolin), with the backbone of Gln189 (Morin and Luteolin), with the backbone of Thr190 (Morin, Hispidulin, and Luteolin), and with the side chain of Cys44. Only 7,8-dihydroxyflavone establishes an H-bond interaction with the side chain of Glu166 (Figure 3).

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the urgent need for novel antiviral drugs. Flavonoids have been l rgely studied as possible inhibitors of 3CLpro a veral studies found them to be active against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteases [19]. It has previously been shown that several of these compounds can impair HCoV-229E replication in vitro [63]. The antiviral activity of Quercetin was previously observed in vitro against HSV-1 [64] and during in vitro and in vivo Rhinovirus infection [65], and its derivates also show antiviral activity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [66] and Influenza A H1N1 virus replication in cell cultures [67]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many flavonoids were examined against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. In particular, it has been observed that myricetin covalently binds to the Cys300 and Cys41 of 3CLpro [68]. In this study, we identified in silico flavonoid derivatives and subsequently evaluated a library of flavonoid derivatives for their inhibitory activity on 3CLpro. Firstly, we identified\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 314 13 of 18\nMorin, Baicalein, Hispidulin, Taxifolin, Steppogenin, Quercetin, Chrysin, Sakuranetin, Alnusin, Galangin, Isosakuranetin, and Isokaempferide through in silico analyses. Then, we tested these flavonoids in a 3CLpro enzymatic assay, finding four of them, Morin, Baicalein, Hispidulin, and Isokaempferide, to be active against 3CLpro. Baicalein, the most promising compound, inhibited 3CLpro activity above 90%, and Morin, Hispidulin, and Isokaempferide were partially active against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The antiviral activity of Morin was observed against the Herpesviridae family [69], whereas Hispidulin has been associated with Influenza A H1N1 neuraminidase inhibition [70]. In order to assess their anti-coronaviral activity, we tested these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 replication with an in vitro assay, but only Baicalein had more than 50% activity against virus replication at concentrations that were non-toxic for Vero E6 cells. In agreement, Seri et al. [4] found Baicalin, but also Herbacetin and Pectolinarin, to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Other studies have reported in vitro Baicalein to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [71]. The anti-SARS-COV-2 properties of Baicalein were, in part, explained through the observation of in silico interactions between this compound and 3CLpro [15,72]. Furthermore, a crystallographic picture of this molecular interaction was obtained with SARS-CoV-1 3CLpro [73], which has 96% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 [74]. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 [75], MERS-CoV in 2012 [76], and SARSCoV-2 in 2019 [77], research has uncovered many details of the life cycle of coronavirus and its pathogenesis; however, there are currently no approved drugs with anti-pancoronaviral activity. Thus, we extended our observations on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Baicalein, testing its inhibitory potency against additional members of the Coronaviridae family. To our knowledge, for the first time we found that this compound is highly active against F-CoV, B-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 replication. F-CoV [78,79] and HCoV-OC43 [80] have been previously used as SARS-CoV-2 surrogates in order to test the virucidal and antiviral activity of several compounds. Considering that F-CoV belongs to the alpha coronavirus genus, Baicalein could be active against the human alpha Cov species, i.e., HCoV-229E which usually infects the upper respiratory tract, but can cause more severe diseases in newborns and in immunocompromised individuals [81], and HCoV-NL63 which causes bronchiolitis in infants [82] and pneumonia. Furthermore, from a translation point of view, the activity of Baicalin against HCoVOC43 is relevant. Indeed, this HCoV causes very mild disease in immunocompetent adults [81], but it is a threat for newborns (0\u20131 year) causing bronchiolitis [83]. The broad-spectrum of the anti-pancoronaviral action of Baicalein against F-CoV, BCoV, and HCoV-OC43 could be explained by the fact that 3CLpro is highly conserved within the Coronaviridae family [74]. Of note, the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids has also been shown, modulating the expression of inflammatory markers, such as IL1-B and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-a) [84], and it can modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome [85,86]. Interestingly, IL1-B and TNF-a blood levels were associated with post-COVID-19 illness [87] and the use of flavonoid-derived compounds could mitigate post-COVID-19 symptoms. In this context, Baicalein has been shown to interact with the NLRP3 inflammasome [86] and with Nf-kB through Nrf2 activation [88]. The limitations of this study include a lack of other HCoV models, including low (HCoV-NL63 and HKU1) and high (MERS-CoV) human pathogenetic coronavirus, but also additional animal coronaviruses (bat coronaviruses) in order to confirm the anti-pancoronaviral activity of Baicalein. The availability of a compound with proven activity against emerging coronaviruses would represent great value as coronaviruses infecting animals still represent a threat. Indeed, a novel CoV infecting pigs, named swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)-CoV that recently caused an outbreak in China [89], is capable of infectibg human derived cells [90], suggesting that it might also be capable of jumping to humans.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 314 14 of 18\nMoreover, several compounds were found to be toxic for the cells and were tested against SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. The latter could have underestimated the evaluation of the antiviral potency of these molecules and indicates the need to improve the synthesis processes and test new Baicalein-derived compounds against coronaviruses. In conclusion, our study confirmed the in vitro antiviral activity of Baicalein against SARS-CoV-2 replication, but also demonstrated clear evidence of the anti-pan-coronaviral activity exerted by this compound. Given that Baicalein and the other bioactive compounds highlighted in this work belong to a very large family of natural compounds, this work paves the way for the exploration of naturally occurring flavonoids in the identification of additional and effective 3CLpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Starting from our results, future investigations are warranted in order to elucidate the possible activity of Baicalein and its derivatives against other steps of the coronavirus life cycle. Furthermore, we underline the importance of using an experimental approach combining in silico and in vitro analyses in order to uncover novel antiviral drugs that are suitable for treating SARS-CoV-2 in this current pandemic or for the next emerging viral pathogen.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M., D.Q., L.S. and A.P.; Methodology, M.M., D.Q., A.C., F.G., L.S., S.C., M.F., A.D., F.F. and N.C.; Investigation, A.C., F.G., L.S., S.C., M.F., A.D., F.F., E.C. and N.C.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.M., D.Q., L.S., A.P. and C.S.; Writing\u2014review & editing, N.C., N.M., B.B., G.A., A.P. and C.S.; Supervision, N.C., N.M., B.B., G.A., A.P. and C.S.
