ABSTRACT Objectives The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of depression and its sociodemographic predictors, clinical predictors and glycaemic control among adult patients with type 2 diabetes at Sheik Hassan Yabare Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (SHYCSH), Jigjiga, Ethiopia. Design A hospitalbased crosssectional study was conducted. Setting Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at Sheik Hassan Yabare Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, for chronic followup from 3 October 2022 to 13 November 2022. Participants Randomly selected 278 patients with T2DM age 18 years and older, with a duration of 1 year or more since diagnosis, who had a diabetic followup at SHYCSH. Main outcome measures Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Results A total of 263 participants were included, with a response rate of 94.6%. Of the respondents, 134 (51%) were male, making up more than half of the total. The overall prevalence of depression was 47.1% (95% CI 41.1 to 53.2). Depression was further classified, as follows, based on its severity: the majority (66 or 25.1%) had mild depression, followed by 44 (16.7%) with moderate depression, 9 (3.4%) with moderately severe depression and 5 (1.9%) with severe depression. A multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that poor glycaemic control (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.93; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.53), DM complications (AOR=2.02; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.74) and DM duration of 6\u201310 years since diagnosis (AOR=2.29; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.34) were independently associated with depression. Conclusions Our study revealed a significant burden of depression among patients with T2DM receiving followup care at the hospital. Glycaemic control, the presence of complications and a longer duration of diabetes were identified as predictors of depression. Therefore, concerned stakeholders should work to improve blood sugar control and promote healthy behaviour, particularly among those with complications or who have been sick for an extended period of time. INTRODUCTION According to the International Diabetic Federation, in 2021, 537 million people worldwide had diabetes, with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounting for 90% of all cases. Depression is a common and serious medical illness that causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities, and around 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. In terms of disease burden, depression is currently ranked third. However, it is expected to overtake all other diseases by 2030. Despite their mutual relationship, 15%\u201320% of those who have T2DM struggle with a moderate to severe form of depression worldwide. Patients with T2DM experience depression due to complications and poor glycaemic control. Environmental stressors and heritable genetic factors cause structural and functional changes in many brain regions, resulting in dysfunctional neurogenesis and neurotransmission. Affected areas include the prefrontal cortex, cingulated gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, which are involved in the regulation of motivation, STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY",

Depression is a common and serious medical illness that causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities, and around 280 million people worldwide suffer from depression. In terms of disease burden, depression is currently ranked third.1 However, it is expected to overtake all other diseases by 2030.2 Despite their mutual relationship, 15%\u201320% of those who have T2DM struggle with a moderate to severe form of depression worldwide.3 Patients with T2DM experience depression due to complications and poor glycaemic control.4 Environmental stressors and heritable genetic factors cause structural and functional changes in many brain regions, resulting in dysfunctional neurogenesis and neurotransmission. Affected areas include the prefrontal cortex, cingulated gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, which are involved in the regulation of motivation,\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The level of glycaemic control was determined using the glycated haemoglobin A1c test, which is a more reliable predictor of long- term glycaemic control than fasting blood sugar. \u21d2 The study used a cross- sectional design, which can only establish associations between variables and cannot determine causality. \u21d2 The study was conducted in a single comprehensive specialised hospital in Jigjiga, Ethiopia, which may limit the generalisability of the findings to other settings.\n(IIT P atna).

Antidepressants have been shown to restore the negative feedback control of the HPA axis and increase GR expression.8 Hyperglycaemia also reduces brain- derived neurotrophic factor levels and decreases hippocampal volume, leading to increased cortisol release, which is involved in depression.9\nDepression and T2DM are causally related and deserve attention from clinicians to ensure better management. It is a comorbid condition with DM, and the most substantial increase in its prevalence is observed among individuals with T2DM in developing countries, including Ethiopia.10\u201312 T2DM prevalence is increasing globally, with the highest rate of increment in developing countries. It has multidimensional burdens ranging from physical and mental to socioeconomic consequences. While most of these burdens had due consideration, the mental health impact of the disease, such as depression, is often unnoticed, undiagnosed or untreated.13 More importantly, depression is known to have a higher likelihood of occurrence in patients with T2DM, but its recognition and treatment are less than optimal.14 Targeted efforts are needed to improve depression detection among adults, mainly those with diabetes.\nDespite the controversial association between depression and glycaemic control, several cross- sectional studies across the world, including Ethiopia, showed a significant association between poor glycaemic control and depression.15\u201317 It is highest in the Gulf countries and Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, where more than two- thirds of patients with T2DM have poor glycaemic control.18\u201320 In sub- Saharan countries, the costs of poor control of diabetes are 3\u20134 times higher than those with good glycaemic control.21\nChronic disease management often focuses on single conditions, such as diabetes and depression. Although some efforts have been made to estimate the prevalence of depression and its associated predictors among patients with T2DM in Ethiopia, limited studies have addressed the association of depression with glycaemic control. These studies did not measure glycaemic control using the standard measurement, HbA1c, which better indicates the chronic level of hyperglycaemia.17 22 Hence, measuring the prevalence of depression and its sociodemographic predictors, clinical predictors and glycaemic\ncontrol remains a critical undertaking. Generally, the literature now shows a significant association with various predictors of depression among patients with DM, but it often goes unrecognised and untreated in developing countries, particularly in the study area.23 As a result, this study aims to determine the prevalence of depression and its sociodemographic predictors, clinical predictors and glycaemic control among adult patients with T2DM.\nThis cross- sectional study will help health development planners consider depression in patients with T2DM when designing diagnosis and management strategies. It will also provide additional knowledge and baseline information for other researchers and provide information to the diabetic population. This cross- sectional study will help health development planners consider depression in patients with T2DM when designing, diagnosing and managing strategies. It will also provide additional knowledge and baseline information for other researchers and provide information to the diabetic population.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS Study design and setting From 3 October 2022 to 13 November 2022, a hospitalbased cross- sectional study was conducted at Sheik Hassan Yabare Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (SHYCSH), located in Jigjiga, the Somali Region of eastern Ethiopia. Jigjiga is situated 626 km east of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. SHYCSH started providing services in 2017 and serves Somalia and neighbouring regions. The hospital has 282 beds and offers a broad range of services at general and specialty levels, including ENT, neurology, plastic surgery, psychiatry, dialysis centres and chronic follow- up care. Specific services provided by the hospital include endocrinology, cardiology and gastroenterology. Annually, nearly 712 patients with T2DM receive follow- up care at SHYCSH. At the time of data collection, 474 patients with T2DM had regular follow- up appointments.\nStudy participants and sample size Study subjects Randomly selected patients diagnosed with T2DM and who had follow- up at the chronic outpatient department unit."

The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9) was implemented to diagnose depression and grade its severity. The PHQ- 9 is a self- administered and/or interviewer- administered measure of depression symptoms based on the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria for the diagnosis of depressive episodes and has been found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 88% for a diagnosis of major depression based on structured interviews.25 26 It has been validated in sub- Saharan Africans and in Ethiopia in patients with diabetes for the detection of general depressive symptoms.27 28 The PHQ- 9 assesses how often the respondent has experienced specific symptoms more than half the days over the past 2 weeks, assigning values of 0\u20133 points (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half of the days and 3=nearly every day).26 Depression is diagnosed if there is a score of at least 5 reported for the past 2 weeks. Depression was further classified according to severity: 0 indicates no depression, 1\u20134 indicates minimal depression, 5\u20139 indicates mild depression, 10\u201314 indicates moderate depression, 15\u201319 indicates moderately severe depression and 20\u201327 indicates severe depression.26 Questionnaires were translated into local languages to avoid biased responses. Fourteen patients with T2DM were given a pretest, and modifications were introduced depending on feedback. Blood was taken after overnight fasting for biochemical analysis. Three millilitres of venous blood were collected in a vacutainer with an EDTA anticoagulant tube and refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. The blood was subjected to HbA1c determination in the same laboratory by the same technician applying the same technique using a fully automated Cobas C 311 chemistry analyser. HbA1c levels of 7% were considered poor glycaemic control, and HbA1C levels between 5.7%\nand 6.5% indicated that blood sugar levels were in the prediabetes range.29"

Among those variables associated with depression among patients with T2DM, five variables (age category, history of depression, complication, DM duration since diagnosis and HbA1c) had a p value <0.25 on binary logistic regression analysis. Hereafter, it is included in multiple logistic regression analyses for the backward elimination method.\nFrom the total variables included in the multiple logistic regression model, three variables were found to be statistically significant at the level of p<0.05. Hence, the presence of DM- related complications, DM duration since\ndiagnosis and HbA1c had an independent and significant association with depression among patients with T2DM.\nAs a result, patients with DM- related complications were twice as likely to suffer from depression (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.02; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.74; p=0.026) as patients without complications. Furthermore, patients with DM duration of 6\u201310 years since diagnosis were 2.3 times (AOR=2.29; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.34; p=0.011) more likely to experience depression compared with those with 1\u20135 years of DM duration. Moreover, those patients with poor glycaemic control were about twice (AOR=1.93; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.53; p=0.034) more likely to suffer from depression than patients with good glycaemic control. Some variables that established a statistically significant association with depression in bivariate analysis, such as previous history of depression and diabetes duration of more than 10 years since diagnosis, did not confirm a statistically significant association with depression in the final model. Therefore, they were not considered potential independent factors of depression among adult patients with T2DM (table 3)."

The study revealed that 47.1% (95% CI 41.1% to 53.2%) of patients with T2DM had been diagnosed with depression. This finding was in line with previous studies conducted in Ethiopia: Harar (48.9%),24 Ambo (47%),30 Eastern Province (Saudi Arabia) (49.6%)31 and Lorestan Province (Iran) (46.3%)32 Likewise, meta- analyses in Africa and Ethiopia showed a pooled depression prevalence of 40% and 39.7%, respectively.11 12\nHowever, the current prevalence finding was relatively higher than recent large hospital- based study results from 21 developing countries, which reported 33.1%,15 and a cohort study in China, which reported 29% depression prevalence among patients with T2DM.33 The current prevalence is also higher than the results of studies done in the USA (26.8%),34 Vietnam (23.2%),35 Ghana (31.3%)36 and North Sudan (35.6%),37 and Ethiopian studies in Mizan (37.0%)38 and Halaba (29.3%).17 Different age groups in a study of Ghana and using a higher PHQ- 9 cut- off point in studies conducted in Mizan and Halaba, respectively, might explain the lower depression prevalence in these settings.

In addition, variations in sample characteristics and overstating of the outcome due to the self- administered nature of PHQ- 9 might create this gap among settings.\nThe indicated pathophysiological explanation in several studies for depression among patients with T2DM was activation of the HPA, which increases cortisol secretion and the inflammation/cytokine hypothesis of depression.33 44 45 Factors identified in the current study also have a pathophysiological linkage to portions of this hypothesis, as described below.\nFactors significantly associated with depression In this study, poor glycaemic control, the presence of complications and DM duration of 6\u201310 years since diagnosis were significant and independent predictors of depression among patients with T2DM in multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nAlthough the association between depression and glycaemic control remained controversial, we found an independent and statistically significant association among patients with T2DM. Poor glycaemic control in T2DM was about twice (AOR=1.93; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.53) as risky for depression compared with those who had good glycaemic control. This finding is consistent with a large- scale study in 21 developing countries15 and independent studies in Peru,46 Indonesia,41 Egypt,16 North Sudan37 and Halaba.17 In contradiction to this finding, a study conducted in the USA34 and Ireland47 and a meta- analysis in China33 and Ghana36 did not find any significant associations in the multivariable model. The variation in the results could be due to a missed HbA1c result in the USA, HbA1c not being measured in China and only patients over 50 years old being included to see the association in Ireland. A main candidate pathway\n(IIT P atna).

A main candidate pathway could be the activation and disturbance of the stress system. Chronic stress activates the HPA axis, increasing the production of cortisol as much as 20- fold, which lowers the brain\u2019s 5- hydroxytryptamine function, which in turn leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms.48 Long- term sympathetic nervous system activation promotes insulin resistance, visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome, which leads to brain damage, cognitive dysfunction and behavioural changes.49 Excess cortisol disturbs neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a region involved in depression.50 In addition, the brain is highly susceptible to high plasma glucose levels.6 Hyperglycaemia also activates the polyol pathway, which causes neuronal damage that may\neventually result in neurotoxicity.7 Alternatively, chronic stress has behavioural consequences through cortisol and other hormones, which activate the fear system, determining anxiety, anorexia or hyperphagia. The same mediators cause a rapid collapse of the reward system, producing depression and cravings for food.49\nIn addition, the duration of DM was another significant predictor of depression. Patients with diabetes for 6\u201310 years were about 2.3 times (AOR=2.29; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.34) more likely to develop depression than those with diabetes for 1\u20135 years. This finding is consistent with studies in Saudi Arabia,51 Bangladesh,52 Mizan Tape (Ethiopia)38 and Ambo (Ethiopia)30 which pointed out that the duration of DM for more than 6 years increases the likelihood of depression occurrence 2\u20136 times. A longer time since illness diagnosis will almost certainly result in more complications and stressful DM management, which will contribute to depression.\nFurthermore, patients with at least one DM complication were twice as likely to suffer from depression (AOR=2.02; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.74) as those without a complication. Numerous cross- sectional studies were in agreement with this finding. The presence of either microvascular or macrovascular complications among patients with T2DM was significantly associated with depression in studies conducted in Saudi Arabia,51 Heidari (Iran),53 the Philippines,54 Bangladesh52 and Ambo (Ethiopia).30 Perhaps it is due to frequent ulcers, a long healing time, hospitalisation, the possibility of amputation, blindness and chronic pain.55 These daily stressors can be overwhelming and, in turn, precipitate or worsen depression. Additionally, neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses that accompany depression may also play similar roles in the progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications among patients with T2DM. Although several studies have shown a significant association between specific types of complications and depression,32 38 51 we are unable to notice any significant association in this aspect.\nFinally, it is crucial to acknowledge that time constraints imposed our use of a cross- sectional design, limiting our ability to establish causality, with longitudinal studies offering a stronger approach. Additionally, resource constraints confined our study to a single specialised hospital in Ethiopia. While we were able to collect valuable data and insights, differences in healthcare practices, patient demographics and resource accessibility across various settings should prompt caution when extending our results to broader populations. Despite these limitations, our study uses HbA1c as a measure of glycaemic control, as HbA1c is recognised as a more reliable indicator of long- term glycaemic control than fasting blood sugar due to its stability over time.

            "text": "The prevalence of depression was found to be high among patients with T2DM in SHYCSH.\nRisk factors for depression among patients with T2DM were identified as poor glycaemic control, the presence of complications and the long duration of DM.\nTherefore, it is recommended that SHYCSH and the Somali Regional Health Bureau integrate depression\nscreening strategies for patients with T2DM during follow- ups at health facilities.\nA holistic approach that prioritises blood sugar control and treatment of DM complications among patients with T2DM is also recommended.\nAdditionally, we suggest that further research should examine the relationship between these predictors and depressed patients with T2DM, non- depressed patients\n(IIT P atna).
