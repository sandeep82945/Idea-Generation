            "text": "In Vietnam, pangasius farming has developed rapidly in the past decades, with the aquaculture of 5 this particular fish species proving to be very beneficial for the local economy. However, the 6 emergence and spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the policy responses in slowing the spread 7 of the virus have significantly impacted the sector. This paper investigates both the vulnerability 8 and resilience of pangasius aquaculture by identifying the various impacts of the Covid-19 9 pandemic on Vietnam\u2019s pangasius sector and the subsequent responses of this sector towards the 10 issues brought forward by it. In this paper, data collected from 195 pangasius farms in Vietnam 11 are operationalized via binary and ordinal logistic regression in an attempt to reveal the factors 12 affecting the sector\u2019s output and the factors driving farmers\u2019 responses in the context of insecurity 13 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. 14 Since the emergence of the pandemic-induced shock on the pangasius sector, farmers have 15 encountered difficulties regarding the sale of harvests and have been confronted with lower prices 16 for pangasius products, with the sector reporting a reduction in the sales volume and the number 17 of buyers, as well as farmers facing disruptions in logistics and input accessibility. As a response 18 to the impacts of the pandemic, pangasius farmers resorted to a number of coping strategies 19 including feeding pangasius less, reducing the farming scale, delaying harvesting, and/or releasing 20 smaller sized fingerlings. Our regressions suggest that farms signing contracts with buyers are 21 more resilient to the reduction in output price and the reduction in number of buyers but, on the 22 other hand, these farms seem to be more severely impacted by the adverse impacts of reduced sales 23\nFurthermore, our findings suggest that farms selling products to export traders suffered more 25 severely from the reduction in the price of pangasius products and in the number of buyers but, at 26 the same time, these farms seemed to have fewer problems with the reduced sales volume and the 27 increased feed price. Interestingly, our findings also suggest a cross-vulnerability with climate 28 change, specifically with respect to the increase in feed price and the disruption in input logistics, 29 hereby further increasing the vulnerability of pangasius farmers. 30 31 Key words: Pangasius farming; vulnerability; resilience; Covid-19; logistic regression 32 33 1. Introduction 34 Aquaculture has become the major source of fish for human consumption (Marra, 2005; Tovar et 35 al., 2000). It is also the fastest-growing food production sector in the world (FAO, 2020a) and, 36 within this sector, pangasius farming constitutes one of the fastest-growing enterprises (Thong et 37 al., 2020). In Vietnam, pangasius farming has developed rapidly and contributed significantly to 38 the national economy (Thong et al., 2020; VASEP, 2020), with pangasius farming comprising the 39 main livelihood for many households in the country, especially in the Mekong Delta, and with the 40 Vietnamese pangasius sector representing more than 75% of the global production (Nguyen et al., 41 2017). The dominant position of Vietnam in the international pangasius trade is reflected in its 42 2019 export numbers, as Vietnamese pangasius products were exported to more than 149 countries 43 in the world, amounting to a total value of $US 2.2 billion (VASEP, 2022a). 44 45\ngovernment reactions, such as the introduction of lockdown measures or social distancing, have 47 worldwide caused disruptions in supply chains. This significantly affected all the sectors of the 48 economy (Cariappa et al., 2021), including the aquaculture sector (FAO, 2020a; Mangano et al., 49 2022). International trade of aquaculture products dropped due to the closure of international 50 borders (Kakoolaki et al., 2020), with inputs and market accessibility being constrained in some 51 countries because of the reduced mobility of producers (Kumaran et al., 2021). To make the 52 situation even more precarious, fish demand was reported to decrease as well (Azra et al., 2021). 53 As a result of this decreased fish demand, output prices declined (Belton et al., 2021), while at the 54 same time input prices increased sharply (Rosen, 2020) due to constrictions in the input supply. 55 Consequently, income from aquaculture was reported to decrease significantly (Lebel et al., 2021). 56 Pangasius farming in Vietnam was also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly 57 because the species is mainly grown for export (FAO, 2020b). The production and export costs of 58 the sector have increased significantly, while its demand in key markets has been uncertain or has 59 even decreased. In 2021, more than 103 seafood factories in the south of Vietnam had to 60 temporarily shut down in response to a large local outbreak of Covid-19 (Dao, 2021). Moreover, 61 pangasius processing factories and farms had to close because they failed to implement the \u201c3-on-62 site\u201d model (in which workers had to work, eat, and sleep within the plants and farms and which 63 aimed at isolating their workers from the public and families) (Dao, 2021). As a consequence, the 64 pangasius farming activity decreased dramatically (T\u00e2m Th\u1eddi, 2020; VASEP, 2022b). This all 65 helps to explain why the export value of Vietnamese pangasius decreased by 23% in 2021, 66 compared to the 2019 figures (VASEP, 2022a). Other reported impacts were an increase in the 67\nproduction efficiency (T\u00e2m Th\u1eddi, 2020). 69 Obviously, the farming stage is an important component in the aquaculture supply chains. 70 In Vietnam, the breakdown in many pangasius farms during the pandemic was one of the causes 71 interrupting its supply chains. Vulnerability1 in aquaculture farming is therefore indisputably 72 linked to the supply chain performance and can be a trigger for risks that may harm supply chain 73 operations (Grosse-Ruyken et al., 2012), which can be further aggravated by anthropogenic-driven 74 changes (Sar\u00e0 et al., 2021). Gaining insight in the prevalence and drivers of the impacts of the 75 pandemic and the responses toward it at farm level (Morton, 2020), the important \u201cmaterial\u201d 76 supplier in the pangasius supply chains, could help to decrease the vulnerability of its supply chain 77 (Grosse-Ruyken et al., 2012). 78 Several studies have focused on impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on aquaculture supply 79 chains. Mangano et al. (2022), for example, studied aquaculture supply chains at the global scale 80 during the Covid-19 pandemic, assessing the perception on the vulnerability and resilience of four 81 main supply chain components, including farming, processing, distribution, and market. Although 82 aiming to do a rapid assessment at global scale, Vietnam, after all one of the most important 83 aquaculture producing countries, was not covered by the survey during the assessment period. 84 In a study by Lebel et al. (2021), the negative effects of the Covid\u201319 pandemic on 85 aquaculture farmers in five countries in the Mekong region, including Vietnam, were investigated. 86 However, impacts of the pandemic have been reported to vary not only with regions, but also with 87 species (FAO, 2020c), and the study of Lebel et al. (2021) did not consider the pangasius industry. 88\n1 Vulnerability can be defined as the inability to avoid welfare declines when hit by exogenous shocks (Fafchamps, 2010)\nNot District, Can Tho city, Vietnam, but they only focused on the relationship between coping 90 responses of the sector and economic performance. They however did not address the 91 heterogeneity in the responses. Up to now, no studies have been published on the association 92 between farm and farmer characteristics and the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the pangasius 93 industry. Additionally, no one has studied the association between farm and farmer characteristics 94 and the coping responses of the sector to the pandemic yet. Information on vulnerability and its 95 driving factors in the pangasius farming component can be helpful in increasing the supply chain 96 resilience to shocks. Therefore, this study identifies the vulnerability of pangasius farming in 97 Vietnam during the shock by identifying farm level impacts and investigating their drivers. To do 98 so, perceptions of pangasius farm owners on the extent and direction of the impacts of the Covid-99 19 pandemic on their production (including input accessibility and logistics, input quantity and 100 input prices) and on their sales (such as output price, output logistics and number of buyers) were 101 surveyed and analyzed. Impacts that were reported by more than half of the respondents were 102 selected to analyze vulnerability drivers using a logit model. Moreover, the coping responses 103 which have been applied by these farms were also surveyed. Also here the most common responses 104 were chosen to identity the determinants. This study contributes to the previous literature on 105 vulnerability and resilience in aquaculture by focusing on the specific case of pangasius farming 106 in Vietnam. Moreover, the findings are useful to predict future disaster-driven responses, resilience 107 of the sector, and to identify mitigation measures. 108 109 110 111\nData collection 113 In Vietnam, pangasius is mainly cultivated in the Mekong Delta, with An Giang, Can Tho, and 114 Dong Thap constituting the top provinces of the sector, both in terms of production and cultivation 115 area. Combined, these provinces host more than 75% of the pangasius production in Vietnam 116 (VASEP, 2022a). Because of this, the An Giang, Can Tho, and Dong Thap provinces were selected 117 as the primary sampling areas in this study. First of all, a preliminary survey focusing on basic 118 information on pangasius aquaculture during the Covid-19 pandemic period was conducted at the 119 end of 2020. After this, a structured questionnaire was designed including four main parts. The 120 first part entails questions concerning the actual process of pangasius production, including 121 information on input used and output produced. The second part considers the impacts of the 122 Covid-19 pandemic on the pangasius production and sales and also assesses the various strategies 123 of farms\u2019 owners in response to such impacts. The third part of the questionnaire looks at climate 124 change perceptions and its perceived impacts on pangasius production. Lastly, the questionnaire 125 enquires about the farm and farm owner\u2019s characteristics. Pre-testing was conducted in January 126 2021 at nine farms in the three provinces mentioned above. The questionnaire was then critically 127 evaluated and edited based on the information of the pre-testing. Regarding the operationalization 128 of the questionnaire, the vulnerability of pangasius farms to the pandemic-induced shock was 129 assessed using Likert scale questions concerning its impacts on production and sales. Furthermore, 130 responses of farm owners to the pandemic were collected using multiple choice questions. 131 This study aimed to survey 230 pangasius farms, accounting for 5% of the total estimated 132 pangasius farms in the study area, a number based on their distribution in the provinces. The farms 133 to be surveyed were randomly selected based on a list provided by the local authorities. However, 134\nmeeting others out of fear of getting infected during the surveyed period, several farmers, 136 especially in Dong Thap province, refused to be interviewed. Ultimately, 195 pangasius farms, 137 which accounts for more than 4% of the total farms in the study area, were visited and interviewed 138 face-to-face. The field survey took place between April and December 2021 and was executed 139 with the help of 8 local data collectors. 140 141 Data analysis 142 Logistic regression 143 In this study, the identified impacts of Covid-19 on pangasius farming are measured using an 144 ordinal variable with \u201c1 = not influenced\u201d, \u201c2 = slightly influenced\u201d, \u201c3 = influenced\u201d, \u201c4 = highly 145 influenced\u201d, and \u201c5 = severely influenced\u201d. Ordinal logistic regressions were then used to identify 146 the relationship between farmer and farm characteristics and the reported impacts of the Covid-19 147 pandemic. For two impacts (i.e. impact on input accessibility and sales volume) the parallel lines 148 test showed that the assumption of proportional odds did not hold, so therefore, these variables 149 were recoded as dummy variables with \u201c0 = not influenced\u201d and \u201c1 = influenced\u201d and a binary 150 logistic regression was used. Farmers\u2019 responses to the crisis are included as binary variables with 151 \u201c1 = apply\u201d and \u201c0 = not apply\u201d. In this framework, the relationships between farmer and farm 152 characteristics and the most common responses of pangasius farms to the pandemic were identified 153 using binary logistic regression models. 154 155 156 157\n       p p 1 ln   kK XXX ...22110 159 where p is the probability that a farm was \u201cnot influenced/slightly influenced/influenced/highly 160\ninfluenced/severely influenced\u201d by the Covid-19 pandemic with regards to a certain aspect (i.e. 161 the dependent variable value is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) or the probability that the farm applied a certain 162 response (i.e. the dependent variable value is 0 or 1); KXX ...1 are farm and farmer characteristics 163 used as explanatory variables;  are the regression coefficients, calculated with a maximum 164\nlikelihood estimation and  is the error term. A description detailed overview of the independent 165 variables is presented in Table 1 and the descriptive statistics for the variables included in the 166 models are shown in Appendix A. 167 A positive/negative sign of the coefficient (  ) in the ordinal logistic regression indicates 168\nthat a farm was more/less severely impacted during the Covid-19 pandemic in a certain aspect. In 169 the binary logistic regression, a positive/negative sign of the coefficient (  ) shows that a farm was 170\nmore/less likely to be impacted for the two impacts for which the parallel lines assumption did not 171 hold (i.e. input accessibility and sales volume) or more/less likely to apply a certain response. 172 Because the relationship between the dependent variable and predictors is of logistic nature, the 173 size of an effect cannot be directly interpreted from the regression coefficient. The odds ratio (OR) 174 was therefore used in this study for interpretation, showing the change in the odds of an event 175 resulting from a unit change of the predictor. Put differently, in our ordinal logistic regressions an 176 odds ratio (OR) larger/smaller than 1 shows how much more/less a farm was impacted by the 177 shock. In our binary logistic regressions, an odds ratio (OR) larger/less than 1 indicates that a 178\nor that he is more/less likely to apply a certain response. 180 3. Results 181 3.1. Vulnerability in pangasius farming in Vietnam during the Covid-19 pandemic 182 The opinions of pangasius farmers about the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on their businesses 183 are shown in Figure 1 & 2. More than half of the respondents report that output price, sales volume, 184 number of buyers, feed price, selling harvest, input and output logistics, and input accessibility 185 (including fingerlings, labor and feed) were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the impacts 186 ranging from slightly affected to severely affected. From all of the impacts mentioned above, 187 output, price and the number of buyers were reported the most by farmers (Figure 1). According 188 to farmers, especially the prices of pangasius products have decreased significantly since the 189 emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, together with a pronounced drop in the number of 190 enterprises buying pangasius products and, corresponding with this, the sales volume. 191 Many farms reported that they experienced difficulties selling their harvests, which meant 192 that they had to maintain their live fish for an unforeseen and indeterminate time period, thus 193 implicating an increased expenditure towards feeding the unsold fish. Measures aimed at slowing 194 the spread of Covid-19 have also affected access to inputs, as pangasius farmers found it more 195 difficult to obtain access to inputs such as fingerling, feed and the hiring of labor. In addition, 196 farmers also claimed that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in pangasius product 197 logistics and mentioned a reduced credit accessibility as well. 198 199 200 201\nAs mentioned in the section above, the Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted pangasius 203 farms, yet our findings indicate that not all farms are uniformly affected, as some farms seem to 204 be more resilient than others. Identifying which type of farms and farmers were more or less 205 impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic is extremely relevant, as this allows us to assess differences 206 in vulnerability and to propose possible solutions that can make pangasius farmers more resilient 207 in future economic upheavals. To this end, the factors (farm and farmer characteristics) that 208 determine the severity of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic were identified using the two types 209 of logistic regression models described above (see Table 2). 210 The reduction in pangasius product prices impacted 90.8% of the sample farms (Figure 2), 211 yet the differences in impacts show that farm and farmer characteristics have a significant effect 212 on the observed vulnerability of pangasius farmers. The results in Table 2 show that farms selling 213 pangasius products to export traders seem to be more severely impacted by a reduction in output 214 price compared to those selling their products to local traders or other buyers (OR = 9.152). On 215 the other hand, farmers getting technical advices from extension officers, veterinary medicine or 216 food delivery companies (OR = 0.563) and farmers signing contracts with buyers (OR = 0.791) 217 seem to be more resilient to a reduction in output price compared to their counterparts. 218 Similarly, increases in feed price impacted 63.1% of pangasius farms, yet farms signing 219 contracts with buyers (OR = 1.152) seem to be more severely impacted by an increase in feed price 220 than those who did not sign contracts with buyers. In comparison, farms receiving technical advice 221 (OR = 0.297), and farms selling their pangasius products to export traders (OR = 0.139) seem to 222 suffer less severely from an increase in feed price. 223\nsample farms (Figure 2). The results in Table 2 show that farms selling their products to export 225 traders (OR = 24.070) seem to be more severely impacted by a reduction in the number of buyers 226 than those who do not sell to export traders. In contrast, farms receiving technical advice (OR = 227 0.482), farms signing contracts with buyers (OR = 0.828), farms that have identification codes 228 (OR = 0.316), and farms that treat wastewater before releasing it to the environment (OR = 0.232) 229 seem to be more resilient to this impact. 230 Next to this, 68.2% of farms reported that it was difficult to sell their harvested products 231 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with a significantly longer production cycle as a result (Figure 2). 232 The results indicate that farmers who signed contracts with buyers (OR = 1.256) seem less able to 233 sell their harvest than those who did not sign their contract with buyers. On the other hand, farmers 234 with more years of experience (OR = 0.767) and farmers who obtained technical advice (OR = 235 0.533) seem to be more resilient to being unable to sell the harvest. 236 Disruptions in input logistics impacted 59.0% of the total sample farms (Figure 2). With 237 regards to this variable, farms with identification codes (OR = 0.260) and farms who obtained 238 technical advice (OR = 0.452) seem to be more resilient to this impact. 239\nFigure 2 also shows that 57.9% of the sampled farms experienced a reduction in sales 240 volume and that 55.4% of farms were less able to access inputs. Regarding these variables, larger 241 farms seem less likely to be impacted by a reduction in sales volume (OR = 0.977) and reduced 242 input accessibility (OR = 0.979) compared to smaller farms. Next to this, farms with identification 243 codes seem less likely (OR = 0.281) to be unable to access inputs than those without identification 244 numbers. Next to this, farms signing contracts with buyers (OR = 1.376) seem more likely to be 245 impacted by a reduction in sales volume than compared to those who do not sign contracts with 246\nexport traders (OR = 0.104) seem less likely to suffer from this problem. 248 Curiously, the results also show a positive relationship between the level of education of 249 farmers and the attendance of training courses by farmers and the vulnerability to the pandemic-250 induced shocks. Farmers with a higher level of education and farmers attending training courses 251 seem to be more severely impacted by a reduction in the number of buyers (OR = 1.097 and OR 252 = 3.395, respectively), input logistics disruption (OR = 1.169 and OR = 6.985, respectively), and 253 difficulty in input accessibility (OR = 1.150 and OR = 8.196, respectively). Higher educated 254 farmers also seem to be more vulnerable to a reduction in output price (OR = 1.147) and seem to 255 experience more difficulties in selling their harvests (OR = 1.083) The same finding is observed 256 for farmers attending training courses (OR = 2.109), as they seem to be less able to sell their 257 harvests than those who are not attending training courses. This positive relation of both higher 258 educational levels of farmers and the attendance of training courses by farmers with vulnerability 259 to pandemic-induced shocks might be related to the association between these characteristics and 260 the type of farm these farmers operate. 261 Finally, farms who reported to be impacted by climate change are more severely impacted 262 by an increase in feed price (OR = 20.647), input logistics disruptions (OR = 2.816) and reductions 263 in sales volume (OR = 13.420) compared to those who did not report a significant impact of climate 264 change. 265\n3.3. Responses of pangasius farms to impacts and driving factors 266\nAs a reaction to the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, pangasius farms in Vietnam have 267 taken various non-exhaustive measures in an attempt to improve their situation (Figure 3). For 268 example, many farms reduced their farming scale while other farms decided to stop their 269\nto delay harvesting of pangasius fish while still others applied \u2018feeding less practices\u2019 in response 271 to pandemic-induced shocks and/or switched to cheaper feed. Some farms also reduced their 272 stocking density and/or released the economically less profitable small-sized fingerlings. 273 Following this, figure 3 shows that more than one-third of the total pangasius farms 274 (42.1%) have reduced their scale of operation in response to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. 275 Our findings show that especially farms who are signing contracts with buyers (OR = 1.313) and 276 farms that are being impacted by climate change (OR = 3.942) seem more likely to reduce farming 277 scale. On the other hand, farms selling products to export traders (OR = 0.055) seem less likely to 278 resort to this measure compared to those selling to local traders or other buyers. 279 Almost 30% of farms responded to the pandemic-induced shocks by delaying the 280 harvesting of pangasius fish (Figure 3). The results in Table 3 show that farms who sell their 281 products to export traders are significantly more likely to respond to the shock by delaying 282 harvesting (OR = 13.244) than those who are selling to local traders and other buyers. Next to this, 283 farmers with more years of experience (OR = 3.525) and farms with identification codes (OR = 284 3.483) are more likely to delay harvesting as well. Farms who report be affected by climate change 285 (OR = 48.634) are also more likely to apply this measure than those who did not report to be 286 affected by climate change. Lastly, farmers attending training courses (OR = 0.192) and farmers 287 who have more family members (OR = 0.609) are less likely to respond to the pandemic by 288 delaying harvesting. 289\nFigure 3 shows that 27.2% of the farms applied \u2018feeding less practices\u2019. Since feed 290 constitutes a major proportion of the costs involved in pangasius farming, many farms have tried 291 to reduce their feed costs by feeding less as a coping strategy when faced with the pandemic-292\nonce per 2-3 days instead of daily. Some farmers implemented this strategy in order to maintain a 294 large quantity of live unsold fish at low costs for indeterminate periods of time due to being unable 295 to sell their harvest on the market. Others implemented this measure to ensure that the delayed 296 harvest pangasius would not be oversized and violate the size requirements which pangasius 297 companies often set. Our findings indicate that farms with identification codes (OR = 4.240) seem 298 more likely to reduce feeding to respond to the shock compared to those without identification 299 codes. Farms with a higher stocking density (OR = 1.027) are slightly more likely to feed fish less 300 compared to those with a lower stocking density. Furthermore, farms treating their wastewater 301 before releasing it into the environment (OR = 27.204) and farms who stated that they were being 302 impacted by climate change (OR = 35.164) are significantly more likely to apply this particular 303 measure as well. In contrast, larger farms (OR = 0.956) seem less likely to reduce feeding 304 compared to smaller farms. 305 Our questionnaire also found that 18.5% of the sampled farms are releasing small-sized 306 fingerlings as a response to the impacts of the pandemic (Figure 3). In normal times, Vietnamese 307 pangasius farmers usually stock their fingerlings at the size of 30 units per kilogram (i.e. about 33 308 gram per unit). However, due to the shock, many farmers tried to slow down the production cycle 309 by stocking fingerlings at smaller size (between 35 and 80 unit per kilogram). Our findings suggest 310 that farmers with more years of experience (OR = 20.495) seem more likely to apply this strategy 311 compared to those with fewer years of experience. 312 313 314 315\n4.1 Impacts of the pandemic 317\nCovid-19 appeared at the end of 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world in the first half of 318 2020 (Baudron and Li\u00e9geois, 2020). Although it does not infect aquatic species (Bondad-Reantaso 319 et al., 2020), Covid-19 has had serious unprecedented impacts on the aquaculture sector (FAO, 320 2020c; Lebel et al., 2021), especially on export-oriented cultivation (FAO, 2020b). Our study 321 shows that in the case of pangasius farming in Vietnam, the pandemic had impacts on output price, 322 sales volume, number of buyers, feed price, input logistics, as well as causing significant 323 difficulties in selling harvests and obtaining access to inputs. These findings are in line with earlier 324 studies on aquaculture production. 325 In 2018, there was a spike in traded prices for frozen pangasius fillet (FAO, 2020a). This 326 led to a significant increase in farm-gate prices of pangasius and thereby incentivized heavy 327 investment and expansion in pangasius cultivation area in Vietnam (FAO, 2020a). However, with 328 the emergence of the pandemic, the price of pangasius steeply declined. The reduction in output 329 price and sale volume found in our study, were also reported by Azra et al. (2021), Manlosa et al. 330 (2021), and Kumaran et al. (2021) for aquaculture in other countries. Azra et al. (2021) found that 331 a decline in the price of cultured aquatic animals and the sale thereof were the biggest challenges 332 for aquaculture production in Malaysia during Covid-19. Similarly, Manlosa et al. (2021) found a 333 decline in demand from restaurants and hotels in the Philippines and reported a 50% decrease in 334 prawn price due to the shock. 50% of shrimp farms in the study by Kumaran et al. (2021) were 335 reported to sell their harvest at a lower price because they predicted that market conditions would 336 be worse and there would be a further drop in prices due to the shock. In contrast, for the case of 337 farmed milkfish, Manlosa et al. (2021) found a different result. He observed that the price of 338\nconsumed in local markets and surrounding areas and was therefore less affected by the pandemic 340 (Manlosa et al., 2021). Our findings on a decrease in access to fingerlings, feed, and labor in 341 pangasius farming are also in line with the studies by Kumaran et al. (2021) and Manlosa et al. 342 (2021). Many shrimp farms in India were reported to have difficulties in the supply of inputs 343 (Kumaran et al., 2021) and fish farmers in the Philippines were also less able to access inputs 344 (Manlosa et al., 2021). Likewise, the study by Azra et al. (2021) identified logistic bottlenecks as 345 one of the most important problems concerning aquaculture in Malaysia (Azra et al., 2021). 346 Before the pandemic, aqua-feed was reported to account for almost 75% of the operating 347 costs in pangasius farming (Phan et al., 2009). During the Covid-19 pandemic, its proportion in 348 the production costs was even found to be 88.9% (Au et al., 2022). The increase in feed costs 349 might be partly caused by the increase in the quantity of feed needed due to delayed harvesting. 350 Moreover, an increase in the feed price due to the shock, which can be another cause, was found 351 in this study. This is because of the continuously increased prices of imported materials for feed 352 production, fuel, and the cost for hiring containers (VASEP, 2020). In contrast, in the study by 353 Manlosa et al. (2021), feed costs were found to remain relatively stable while the cost of fingerlings 354 was found to temporally increase due to the higher transport costs. 355 The findings of this study on disruption in input logistics, increase in input market prices, 356 and reduction in produce market prices correspond to those of the study by Lebel et al. (2021). 357 Aquaculture farmers in five countries in Mekong region, including shrimp farming in Vietnam, 358 were unable to access sales markets (Lebel et al., 2021). Also for pangasius, this resulted in 359 difficulty to sell harvests and live pangasius had to be kept and fed for indeterminate time periods. 360 361\nThe current study also shows that the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic are not homogenous 363 among farmers. Farmers who received technical advice and those with more years of experience 364 appear to be more resilient to most of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, farmers 365 with a higher level of education and those attending training courses with technical, economic, and 366 environmental contents seem more vulnerable to disrupted input logistics, reduced input 367 accessibility, and have more difficulty selling their harvest. Higher educated farmers also suffer 368 more severely from a reduction in output price. A possible explanation might be that this group of 369 farmers have a different farming profile. Higher educated and trained farmers might be more 370 export oriented or more investment-driven or more capital intensive than others. They might 371 operate in a different market segment of high input - high output farming which might be more 372 vulnerable. This implies that in the extension trainings this type of vulnerability and how to cope 373 with it should be receiving more attention. Moreover, it should be noted that, although these 374 farmers are more affected by the shock, our measurements are taken at one moment in time. They 375 still might be better off in the long run as they might recover faster. 376 Farms signing contracts with buyers seem to be more resilient to the reduction in output 377 price and reduction in number of buyers. However, they experienced more severely the adverse 378 impacts of reduced sales volume, higher feed price, and difficulty to sell harvest more severely 379 than those without contracts. A possible explanation might be that in case contracted farms have 380 to deliver a certain amount of harvest to the buyers, it makes it impossible for them to reduce the 381 operation scale and to cut off the expenses on feed. There also might be issues with inappropriate 382 timing of signing contracts and inadequate information in the signed contracts. Up to now, links 383 between seafood processing enterprises and farmers are often uncertain. For individual farms, 384\ncontracts between processing companies and individual farms are signed just before harvesting, 386 after testing the quality and bargaining on the price. For vertical coordinated farms, contracts are 387 often signed between 1 and 2 months after stocking, when pangasius reaches a size of 10 to 15 388 units per kilogram. The price for harvested pangasius products is included in the contract, yet the 389 sales volume is usually not mentioned in the contracts. In addition, responsibilities specified in the 390 contract are easily avoided because of the weak legal environment (Trifkovi, 2014). The rights and 391 obligations are often unclear in the contracts, making farmers more vulnerable in case of disputes 392 (VASEP, 2020). When the processing enterprises face a surplus of fish products from contracted 393 farms, quality standards are sometimes tightened up as well, which often enables them to reject 394 unwanted outputs because of the color, size and weight. Sometimes, when the market price of 395 pangasius products goes down, processing companies shift to buy harvests from individual farms 396 at a lower price instead of buying at the contracted farming price. However, when the market price 397 of pangasius products goes up, they prioritize to buy harvests from contracted farms who stated a 398 lower price in their contracts. In this way, this finding reveals that when farmers are less vulnerable 399 in a certain area, they might be more affected in another. In this case, when farmers have ex ante 400 selling contracts, they might not experience the problem of lower selling prices, but they might 401 still be vulnerable to increasing feed prices. 402 Farms selling products to export traders suffer more severely from a reduction in the price 403 of pangasius products and the number of buyers but less severely from reduced sales volumes and 404 increased feed prices. This is understandable because most of the farmed pangasius from Vietnam 405 has been exported to other countries such as China, USA, ASEAN, EU, and Mexico (VASEP, 406 2022a). Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting implementation of restrictive policies 407\ncountries led to a decrease in pangasius product prices (Azra et al., 2021). In contrast, the domestic 409 demand for pangasius products has increased in recent years (T\u00e2m Th\u1eddi, 2020). This implies that 410 farms that focus more on the domestic market can possibly reduce the risks during the shocks and 411 in this way increase their resilience. 412 Farms who report being affected by climate change also seem to suffer more severely from 413 the increase in feed price and the disruption in input logistics and they seem more likely to be more 414 vulnerable to the reduction in sales volume as well. At present, extreme weather, flood, and 415 drought are the most common phenomena of climate change in the study area. Many sampled 416 farms in our study (29.2% of the total sample) reported that they were affected by climate change 417 (Appendix A). This causes an additional vulnerability in pangasius farming in Vietnam. The 418 profitability of farms was negatively affected by climate change, thus making them more 419 vulnerable to other shocks. When looking at the combined impacts of anthropogenic stressors and 420 the Covid-19 pandemic on aquaculture, Sar\u00e0 et al. (2021) demonstrated that climate change is one 421 of the factors negatively impacting aquaculture production, with the Covid-19 pandemic further 422 amplifying economic losses and food insecurity. 423 Finally, Lebel et al. (2021) found that the impacts of the shock on aquaculture production 424 in five countries in Mekong region were not the same across aquatic animals cultivated, level of 425 intensification, production goals, and farm sizes. 426\n4.3 Coping responses 427\nReducing farming scale, releasing small-sized fingerlings, delaying harvesting, and feeding less 428 were the most common strategies to respond to the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. 429 Lebel et al. (2021) found that adjusting stocking practices was one of the most common responses 430\ncompared to farmers from other countries (Lebel et al., 2021). In Malaysia, Azra, Kasan, et al. 432 (2021) found the reduction in culture volume as the most probable option to cope with the decrease 433 in sales. In line with the findings of this paper, Au et al. (2022) demonstrated that many pangasius 434 farms in Thot Not District, Can Tho city, Vietnam reduced their stocking density, fed pangasius 435 less, and had to prolong the production cycle, with some farms even having to shut down due to 436 the pandemic-induced shock. 437 Taking into account the characteristics of farmers and farms, those farmers with more years 438 of experience responded to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by delaying harvesting and 439 releasing small-sized pangasius fingerlings. Next to this, farms with identification codes seem 440 more likely to reduce feeding and delay harvesting than those without identification codes. Farms 441 who stated that they were being impacted by climate change also seem more likely to reduce 442 feeding and delay harvesting, often reducing the farming scale as well. In line with the previously 443 mentioned farm types, farms with a higher stocking density and farms treating wastewater before 444 releasing it into the environment also seem more likely to feed pangasius less. Contrarily, farms 445 signing contracts with buyers tended to cope with the pandemic-induced shock by reducing their 446 farming scale. Lastly, farms selling their products to export traders seem more likely to delay 447 harvesting and to prolong the production cycle but seem less likely to reduce farming scale in 448 comparison to those selling products to local traders and other buyers. 449\n4.4 Policy implications 450\nAt the time of the field survey, farmers reported that they had not received any support from the 451 Vietnamese government. The findings of this study, therefore, can be useful in identifying who is 452 most vulnerable and thus which farms should be prioritized in terms of receiving governmental 453\nenterprises could possibly be strengthened by introducing contracts that are signed at the beginning 455 of the production cycle, thus strengthening the farmers. Especially the contract terms related to 456 rights, obligations, and responsibilities should be clearly specified to protect farmers when there 457 are disputes. Furthermore, providing technical advice via extension officers, veterinary medicine, 458 or feed delivery companies seems to be a good way to frequently share and update information on 459 output and input prices as well as market prices, as this could possibly mitigate the impact of 460 unexpected shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Another way to make farmers more shock 461 resilient could be the frequent updating of training course content. A theme that definitely deserves 462 more attention in training courses is to train farmers to identify their own vulnerabilities and to 463 provide them with possible solutions on how to cope with these. Last but not least, the cross-464 vulnerability with climate change effects should also be recognized more widely. 465 Funding: This work was partially supported by the Hue University [grant numbers DHH2021-06-466 112]. 467 468 References 469 Au, T.N.H., Hieu, T.H., Son, N.L.A., 2022.
