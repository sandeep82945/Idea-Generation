    "abstractText": "Industrial pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems. Hence, there is a need to search for new efficient sensor materials for the detection of pollutants. In the current study, we explored the electrochemical sensing potential of a C6N6 sheet for H-containing industrial pollutants (HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3) through DFT simulations. The adsorption of industrial pollutants over C6N6 occurs through physisorption, with adsorption energies ranging from \u22129.36 kcal/mol to \u221216.46 kcal/mol. The non-covalent interactions of analyte@C6N6 complexes are quantified by symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT0), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analyses. SAPT0 analyses show that electrostatic and dispersion forces play a dominant role in the stabilization of analytes over C6N6 sheets. Similarly, NCI and QTAIM analyses also verified the results of SAPT0 and interaction energy analyses. The electronic properties of analyte@C6N6 complexes are investigated by electron density difference (EDD), natural bond orbital analyses (NBO) and frontier molecular orbital analyses (FMO). Charge is transferred from the C6N6 sheet to HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3. The highest exchange of charge is noted for H2S (\u22120.026 e\u2212). The results of FMO analyses show that the interaction of all analytes results in changes in the EH-L gap of the C6N6 sheet. However, the highest decrease in the EH-L gap (2.58 eV) is observed for the NH3@C6N6 complex among all studied analyte@C6N6 complexes. The orbital density pattern shows that the HOMO density is completely concentrated on NH3, while the LUMO density is centred on the C6N6 surface. Such a type of electronic transition results in a significant change in the EH-L gap. Thus, it is concluded that C6N6 is highly selective towards NH3 compared to the other studied analytes.",

            "text": "In the last few decades, industrial pollutants have become serious threats to living beings. Industrial pollutants are adversely deteriorating our ecosystem. It is reported that every year, 4.2 million people are affected by direct exposure to industrial pollutants at levels beyond the safety limits [1]. Among industrial pollutants, hydrogen-containing substances such as HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3 are highly poisonous to humans [2\u20135]. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a poisonous gas with an almond-like odour. HCN is used as a reagent for the synthesis of various synthetic fibres, pesticides, plastics and dyes [6]. In cases of contact with skin, ingestion and inhalation, HCN is highly lethal to humans. HCN may cause suffocation, unconsciousness, cramps and heart problems. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a gas with a rotten egg smell which is usually produced by decomposition of organic materials [7]. It rapidly reacts with the haemoglobin in blood and reduces the\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13061121 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 2 of 20\noxygen carrying capacity of vital organs. In addition, the detection and removal of H2S is particularly essential in petrochemical manufacturing and the coal industry. Another industrially demanding chemical is NH3, which is a colourless gas with a pungent smell. It is most widely used in the pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries [8,9]. Phosphine is another hydrogen-containing industrial pollutant, which is used to kill insects. In the semiconductor industry, PH3 is applied in silicon processing [10]. The above-mentioned facts demonstrate the need to design an effective electrochemical sensor for environmental monitoring of these hazardous gases. In the recent past, numerous materials such as ZrO2 nanoparticles [11], carbon nanotubes [10], metal organic frameworks [11,12], porous silica [13], carbon nitride (C2N) [13], hexagonal boron nitride [14], metal oxides [15] and zeolites [16] have been tested as adsorbents and gas sensors [12,17]. In addition, nanocages such as aluminium nitride [18], boron nitride [19], carbon nitride [20], metal clusters [21] and phosphorus carbide [22] have been applied as sensors. The essential pre-requisites for any material to act as a sensor are a high selectivity and sensitivity, a fast response, ease of handling, a low hazard to the environment, a high surface to volume ratio and a high recyclability [23,24]. Materials with a large surface to volume ratio can efficiently interact with analytes. The scientific community has developed new materials to overcome the existing limitations of designed materials, such as a low number of active sites, a lack of a tuneable band gap, a low recyclability, a high cost, a low surface area and selectivity and sensitivity issues. Graphene and graphene-doped materials are among the materials used as sensor materials for toxic and hazardous gases [25\u201329]. The honeycomb-like structure with a large surface area makes graphene an exceptional material for energy storage [23]; photonics [20]; chemical [22], mechanical [30] and DNA sensing [19]; electrocatalysis [2]; electrochemical sensing [31]; and electronic [19] applications. Similarly, other 2D materials such as germanene [32], transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [33], silicene [34\u201336], phosphorene [37], etc., also offer abundant adsorption sites for separation and sensing of the desired materials. However, the zero band gap of graphene causes a switch off problem in optoelectronic devices [38]. Engineered graphene shows improved electronic charge mobility [39,40]. Many attempts have been made to increase the band gap of graphene through physiochemical engineering. Still, it is not easy to produce a material with a controlled pore size and a suitable band gap [41]. Certainly, the above-mentioned materials have many beneficial characteristics, but their limitations, such as low recyclability, low surface area, low number of active sites and high cost, cannot be ignored. In addition, many surfaces used as sensors contain heavy metals, causing a disposal issue. Another newly developed class of 2D and 3D materials are covalent organic frameworks, which consist of a variety of organic units as monomers. In 2005, Yaghi et al. synthesized COF1 through a mechanism based on reticular chemistry [42]. Covalent organic frameworks are crystalline porous materials with controlled pore sizes, well-defined surface areas, low densities, light weights and high thermal stabilities. Due to these characteristics, COFs have attracted a lot of interest in various fields of material science, such as solar cells, gas storage, proton conductivity, catalysis, energy storage devices, etc. [43]. In the recent past, several COFs have been utilized as sensors [44] for trinitrotoluene (TNT), picric acid [45], chromium (Cr), arsenic (As) [46,47] and iodine [48]. Previous reports show that covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are better sensors compared to COFs due to their controlled porosity, high density nitrogen cavities, high surface areas, high chemical and thermal stabilities, reproducible sensing responses and tuneable electronic properties [49,50]. These characteristics provide suitable conditions for the trapping and detection of analytes and infer the increased potential of CTFs as sensor surfaces compared to COFs. However, CTFs have been studied experimentally as sensors for harmful gases and heavy metals [51\u201353]. Keeping in view the above-mentioned characteristics of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), we selected a recently designed covalent triazine framework (C6N6), which contains six nitrogens in its cavity. Recently, C6N6 has been used in many fields such as catalysis [54], sensing [55], drug delivery [56] and energy storage [57]. These findings show that the C6N6\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 3 of 20\nsurface is more comparable to other available COFs for the detection of H-containing industrial pollutants such as HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3. The high amount of nitrogen in the C6N6 unit also leads to a high surface area and a cavity size of 5.46 \u00c5, which can efficiently interact with various analytes through H bonding, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking or other types of chemical interactions. According to the best of our knowledge, C6N6 has not yet been tested as a sensor for the above-mentioned analytes. In the designed study, we used density functional theory simulations to investigate C6N6 as a sensor surface. Changes in geometrical properties are explored through NCI, QTAIM and SAPT0 analyses, while changes in the electronic properties of analytes in C6N6 complexes are determined by NBO, EDD and FMO analyses."

The b97XD functional was adopted in the current study because it is a range-separated functional which can effectively capture non-localized intermolecular interactions [58]. In b97XD, the symbol \u201c\u201d represents the long range correction [59]. Additionally, the b97XD functional also contains Grimme\u2019s D2 dispersion factor to efficiently study the van der Waals (vdWs) interactions [59]. The changes in the electronic properties of C6N6 before and after adsorption of analytes were explored by NBO, EDD and FMO analyses at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. B3LYP/6-31G(d) is considered as the best to study the electronic changes of interacted systems [60\u201365]. The most stable configurations of the analyte@C6N6 complexes were investigated by adsorption of analytes through different orientations of C6N6. A frequency analysis was performed to confirm that the geometries of the complexes were true minima on the potential energy surface. The energies of adsorbed analytes in C6N6 are determined by Equation (1):\n\u2206E = [E(analytes@C6N6) \u2212 (EC6N6 + Eanalytes)] (1)\nwhere E(analytes@C6N6) is the interaction energy of the complexes, EC6N6 is the energy for bare C6N6 and Eanalytes is the energy of the industrial pollutants used as analytes. A SAPT0 analysis was applied to determine the role of the individual components of the interaction energy in the stabilization of the analyte@C6N6 complexes [66]. The total SAPT0 energy is the sum of four factors: induction (\u2206Eind), dispersion (\u2206Edisp), electrostatic (\u2206Eelstat) and exchange (\u2206Eexch). Hence, the SAPT0 energy is calculated through Equation (2):\n\u2206ESAPT0 = \u2206Eelstat + \u2206Eexch + \u2206Eind + \u2206Edisp (2)\nThe nature of adsorption, such as the electrostatic, dispersive and repulsive forces between the analyte and C6N6, was examined by an NCI analysis. The nature and strength of non-covalent interactions is given by the reduced density (s), Equation (3) [67].\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 = 1\n2(3\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b2) 1 3\n\u2207\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c4/3\n(3)\nThe value of electron density (\u03c1) for non-covalent interactions is generally very small. However, small changes in (\u03c1) result in prominent changes in RDG values, which appear in the form of spikes in a 2D-RGD plot. An NCI analysis characterizes non-covalent interactions through 3D-isosurfaces and 2D-RGD plots.

I teraction dista ces of 2.90 \u00c5 (N1---H7), 2.29 \u00c5 (N2---H7) and 2.68 \u00c5 N2---H7 are noted between N atoms (N1, N2 and N3) of C6N6 and the H atom (H7) of H2S (see Figure 2). Moreover, similar interaction distances are observed between N4---H8, N5---H8 and N6---H8, respectively. However, these interaction distances between the N atoms of C6N6 and the H atoms of H2S reveal that the adsorption of H2S occurred at the centre of cavity, while the S atom is pointing upwards.\nThe stable complex of NH3@C6N6 resulted in an adsorption energy of \u221212.27 kcal/mol, which is slightly lower than that of the H2S@C6N6 complex. In the stable configuration of NH3@C6N6, two H atoms of NH3 interact with the N atoms of C6N6, while the 3rd H atom is projected away from the cavity. Among the observed interactions, strong interactions are observed between N1 and H5 and N4 and H6 of C6N6 and H2S, with distances of 2.33 \u00c5 and 2.34 \u00c5, respectively. The N2 and N3 of C6N6 interact with H5 and H6 of NH3, with an interaction distance of 2.57 \u00c5. The lower adsorption energy of the NH3@C6N6 complex (\u221212.27 kcal/mol) compared to the H2S@C6N6 complex (\u221213.64 kcal/mol) is attributed to longer interaction distances between the H atoms of NH3 and the N atoms of C6N6 compared to H2S.\nAn adsorption energy of \u22129.36 kcal/mol is observed for the stable complex of PH3@C6N6, which is the lowest amongst all studied analyte@C6N6 complexes. The stable structure of the PH3@C6N6 complex consists of an inward pointing H atom of PH3, while the other two H atoms point upwards. The inward pointing H atom of PH3 is almost at the centre of the C6N6 cavity. The bond distances between the H atoms of PH3 and the N atoms of C6N6 range from 2.70 \u00c5 to 3.09 \u00c5. The low adsorption energy (\u22129.36 kcal/mol) of the PH3@C6N6 complex is due to the low polarity of the H atoms of PH3 and the longer interaction distances. The results of adsorption energies (\u22129.36 kcal/mol to \u221216.46 kcal/mol) show all analytes (HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3) physically absorb on the C6N6 sheet.\nFigure 1.

In this complex, HCN is projected to be perpendicular to the C6N6 cavity (see Figure 2). The H atom of HCN interacts with the N atoms of C6N6 at bond distances of between 2.57 \u00c5 and 3.09 \u00c5. Among these interactions, the strongest interaction is seen between the H7 atom of HCN and the N1 and N2 of C6N6, with interaction distances of 2.57 \u00c5 and 2.67 \u00c5, respectively. These interaction distances show that HCN is more attracted to the two C3N3 rings containing N1 and N2 atoms. When the input geometry was altered to have the nitrogen atom of HCN pointing towards the cavity of C6N6, the calculation converged to the same complex mentioned above (hydrogen pointing towards the cavity). This happened because of the repulsion between the N atom of HCN and the N atoms of C6N6. The stable complex of H2S@C6N6 is obtained with an adsorption energy of\u221213.64 kcal/mol, which is the 2nd most stable complex among all studied analyte@C6N6 complexes. The optimized topology of the H2S@C6N6 complex shows that both H atoms of H2S are positioned towards the C6N6 cavity. Interaction distances of 2.90 \u00c5 (N1\u2014H7), 2.29 \u00c5 (N2\u2014H7) and 2.68 \u00c5 N2\u2014H7 are noted between N atoms (N1, N2 and N3) of C6N6 and the H atom (H7) of H2S (see Figure 2). Moreover, similar interaction distances are observed between N4\u2014H8, N5\u2014H8 and N6\u2014H8, respectively. However, these interaction distances between the N atoms of C6N6 and the H atoms of H2S reveal that the adsorption of H2S occurred at the centre of cavity, while the S atom is pointing upwards. The stable complex of NH3@C6N6 resulted in an adsorption energy of\u221212.27 kcal/mol, which is slightly lower than that of the H2S@C6N6 complex. In the stable configuration of NH3@C6N6, two H atoms of NH3 interact with the N atoms of C6N6, while the 3rd H atom is projected away from the cavity. Among the observed interactions, strong interactions are observed between N1 and H5 and N4 and H6 of C6N6 and H2S, with distances of 2.33 \u00c5 and 2.34 \u00c5, respectively. The N2 and N3 of C6N6 interact with H5 and H6 of NH3, with an interaction distance of 2.57 \u00c5. The lower adsorption energy of the NH3@C6N6 complex (\u221212.27 kcal/mol) compared to the H2S@C6N6 complex (\u221213.64 kcal/mol) is attributed to longer interaction distances between the H atoms of NH3 and the N atoms of C6N6 compared to H2S. An adsorption energy of \u22129.36 kcal/mol is observed for the stable complex of PH3@C6N6, which is the lowest amongst all studied analyte@C6N6 complexes. The stable structure of the PH3@C6N6 complex consists of an inward pointing H atom of PH3, while the other two H atoms point upwards. The inward pointing H atom of PH3 is almost at the centre of the C6N6 cavity. The bond distances between the H atoms of PH3 and the N atoms of C6N6 range from 2.70 \u00c5 to 3.09 \u00c5. The low adsorption energy (\u22129.36 kcal/mol) of the PH3@C6N6 complex is due to the low polarity of the H atoms of PH3 and the longer interaction distances. The results of adsorption energies (\u22129.36 kcal/mol to \u221216.46 kcal/mol) show all analytes (HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3) physically absorb on the C6N6 sheet."

In the SAPT0 graph, five bars are shown for each complex. The last green bar represents the total SAPT0, which is the sum of the first four bars. Out of these four bars, three bars with negative signs indicate attractive interactions, while the bars with +ve signs indicate repulsive interactions.

Among the studied pollutant complexes, the lowest SAPT0 value is observed for the PH3@C6N6 complex (\u22129.22 kcal/mol). The lowest SAPT0 value for the PH3@C6N6 complex results from the lower polarity of the interacting H atoms of PH3 with the N atoms of C6N6. Among the SAPT0 energy, a key role is noted for Edisp (55%) in the stabilization of the PH3@C6N6 complex, while Eelst (33%) and Eind (12%) contribute less towards the total SAPT0 energy. The SAPT0 analysis reveals that Eelst is the dominant contributing factor in the case of HCN@C6N6, whereas a good balance between Eelst and Edisp is observed for H2S and NH3. In the case of PH3, the dispersion interaction played a dominant role in the stabilization of PH3 over C6N6. The SAPT0 values of all the studied complexes are consistent with the interaction energy analysis."

            "text": "The nature of interactions between analytes and C6N6 was further explored through non-covalent interaction analyses. Through an NCI analysis, the van der Waals, electrostatic and repulsive interactions can be differentiated based on a colour scheme. An NCI analysis comprises 3D isosurfaces and 2D reduced density gradient (RDG) plots. The 3D isosurface topological analysis is based on three types of colours: red (repulsive), green (van der Waals) and blue (electrostatic interactions). These colours appear in the form of patches between the analytes and C6N6 through which the nature of interactions can be differentiated. A 2D RDG plot is obtained by taking the reduced density on the Y-axis and product of 2nd value of the Laplacian (sign(\u03bb2)) and density gradient on the X-axis. A 2D RGD plot gives information about the strength of each type of interaction. In 2D RDG plots, non-covalent interactions appear as blue, green and red spikes in the low density gradient region. The vdWs interactions are indicated by the green spikes which form the when product of sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 is in the range of \u22120.00 a.u. to \u22120.02 a.u. A large and negative value of the product of sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 (above \u22120.02 a.u.) signifies the existence of electrostatic interactions (blue spikes). Red spikes in the 2D-RGD plot show repulsive interactions when the product of sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 is positive and large. The topologies obtained through NCI analyses are presented in Figure 4. In the studied complexes, the green spikes in the 2D RDG plots and the green isosurface in the 3D plots are explored. The green spikes and isosurface indicate vdWs interactions between the analytes and C6N6. The strength of the vdWs interaction in each complex is different, indicated by the variation in the thickness of 3D isosurface patches and a projection of green spikes in the 2D-RDG plots on the X-axis. In the case of the HCN@C6N6 complex, a ring on the green isosurface develops between the H atom of HCN and the six N atoms of C6N6. This shows that all six N atoms of C6N6 strongly interact with the H atom of HCN. Similarly, in the 2D-RDG plot, a mixture of bluish-green spikes arises at a low-density gradient between \u22120.01 and \u22120.02 a.u., which indicates that the complex is stabilized through electrostatic interactions. In the case of the H2S@C6N6 complex, a stronger interaction is observed, where the H atoms of H2S closely interact with the N atoms of C6N6 (see Figure 4). The rest of the interactions are present at longer distances due to the angular orientation of the H2S molecule over C6N6. The 3D isosurfaces and 2D-RGD plots of the NH3@C6N6 complex reveal the weak interaction compared to the HCN@C6N6 and H2S@C6N6 complexes. The scattered green spikes and shattered green isosurface in the 3D NCI plots are due to the weak interaction between NH3 and the C6N6 cavity. The weak interaction of NH3 is also described in the interaction energy section. In the case of the PH3@C6N6 complex, the green spikes and isosurface are not as thick and dense as projected in the rest of the studied complexes.

Through QTAIM analysis, interand intra-molecular interactions such as ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions and covalent bonds can be studied. These inter- and intra-molecular interactions are studied by various parameters such as cage critical points (CCP), nuclear critical points (NCP), ring critical points (NCP) and bond critical points (BCPs). In QTAIM analyses, non-covalent interactions are best explained by BCPs. BCPs between two interacting systems are represented by a brown line (see Figure 5). The nature and strength of each BCP is explained through several parameters such as (\u22072\u03c1), (\u03c1), (H), (G) and (V). The values of the BCP parameters of all complexes are given in Table 2.

For electrostatic interactions (H bonding), the values of (\u22072\u03c1) and (\u03c1) at BCPs are between 0.024 and 0.139 a.u. and 0.002 to 0.034 a.u., respectively [79,80]. In addition, a bond distance (N\u2014H, O\u2014H and F\u2014H) of less than 1.2 \u00c5 indicates a strong interaction, while a bond distance greater than 1.8 \u00c5 shows a weak interaction [81]. The strength of an individual bond can also be characterized by the Espinosa approach, as presented in Equation (4) [82]. For H bonding, the energy value of an individual bond is >3 kcal/mol (in negative) [83].\nEint (a.u.) = 1 2 V(r) (4)\nIn addition, the BCP can further be investigated by Equation (5):\nH(r) = G(r) + V(r) (5)\nwhere G, H and V are the kinetic, potential and total energy density at the BCPs, respectively. For close shell interactions, the value of H is usually positive, while it is negative for shared shell interactions. The type of bonding is generally indicated by \u22072\u03c1 and H. The values of \u22072\u03c1 and H are less than zero for shared shell interactions and greater than zero for close shell interactions. If the values of \u22072\u03c1 are greater than zero and H is less than zero, it indicates H bonding. Another parameter used to explain the BCP is the ratio -V/G. If the ratio of -V/G is >2, it indicates covalent bonding, and a ratio of \u2212V/G of < 1 represents non-covalent interactions [84,85].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 12 of 20\nQTAIM analyses of all the complexes shows that number of BCPs is six in each case due to interactions of six N atoms in the C6N6 cavity with the H atoms of interacting analytes. However, the strengths and types of bonding in all complexes are different due to the different values of their BCP parameters (see Table 2). In the case of the HCN@C6N6 complex, the \u22072\u03c1 and \u03c1 values are in the range of 0.02429 a.u. to 0.0284 a.u. and 0.00706 a.u. to 0.00814 a.u., respectively. The most stable interaction is observed between H7 of HCN and N6 of C6N6. The values of \u22072\u03c1 and \u03c1 at BCPs between H7 and N6 are 0.0284 a.u. and 0.00814 a.u., respectively. In addition, the rest of the BCP parameter values of the HCN@C6N6 complex are in the range of electrostatic attractions, which is consistent with the SAPT0 analysis, where the dominant contribution was electrostatic. The other BCP parameters such as G, H, V, -V/G and Eint are in the range of electrostatic interactions. A topological analysis of the H2S@C6N6 complex also shows six BCPs. Among these BCPs, two BCPs (H7\u2014N2 and H8\u2014N5) are in the strong electrostatic region, while the rest of the BCPs indicate dispersion interactions (see Table 2). Again, the results of the QTAIM analysis for the H2S@C6N6 complex are well matched with the SAPT0, where a good balance between electrostatic and dispersion interactions was observed. The highest values of \u22072\u03c1 (0.03965), \u03c1 (.01586 a.u), H (0.00 a.u.) and Eint (\u22123.11 kcal/mol) are observed for H7\u2014N2 and H8\u2014N5, respectively. The BCP parameter such as \u22072\u03c1, \u03c1 and Eint of H7\u2014N2 and H8\u2014N5 are in the range of H bonding, but no such types of blue isosurface and spikes are seen in the 3D isosurfaces and 2D-RGD plots of NCI analysis. The interaction distances between H7 and N2 and H8 and N5 are 2.29 \u00c5 each, which is greater than the 1.8 \u00c5 required for interacting system to demonstrate H bonding [81]. The BCP parameter values of the NH3@C6N6 complex are in the range of medium to strong interactions between NH3 and C6N6. The strongest interactions are observed between H7 and N2 and H9 and N6 of NH3 and C6N6, respectively. The values of these two BCP parameters\u22072\u03c1, \u03c1 and Eint are almost comparable (see Table 2). The values of the rest of the five BCPs indicate vdWs interactions. The number of BCPs for the PH3@C6N6 complex are equal in number with other complexes. However, all BCP parameter values between the H atoms of PH3 and the N atoms of C6N6 are in the range of dispersion interactions, which is consistent with the SAPT0 interaction energy analysis, where PH3@C6N6 was the least stable complex. In all studied analyte@C6N6 complexes, the values of BCP parameters are in good agreement with NCI and SAPT0 analyses."

Through these analyses of the nature of interactions, the stability, charge transfer and sensing ability of the designed surface for selected analytes can be explored. An EDD plot is obtained by subtracting the charges of individual fragments from the charge of the analyte@C6N6 complex. The topologies obtained through EDD analyses show two types of isosurface: yellow and green. The yellow surfaces reveal a depletion in charge, while a green colour illustrates an accumulation of charge. Among the studied complexes, both types of isosurface are observed in the adsorption site of analytes and the C6N6 surface, which indicates an exchange of electronic charge between them. The topologies of the complexes determined through EDD analyses are presented in Figure 6. In addition, the NBO charge values of each analyte over C6N6 are also displayed in Figure 6. The charge transfer values from C6N6 to the analytes are \u22120.019 e\u2212 (HCN), \u22120.026 e\u2212 (H2S), \u22120.015 e\u2212 (NH3) and \u22120.008 e\u2212 (PH3). These values of charges show that the analytes extracted charge from C6N6. In all studied analytes, the H atoms of analytes interacted with the electron rich cavity of C6N6, due to which charge is transferred from C6N6 to the analytes. The highest charge value is extracted by H2S (\u22120.026 e\u2212) due to a close interaction of the H atoms of H2S with the N atoms of C6N6. Similarly, the accumulation and depletion of electron density in the interacting sites of C6N6 and H2S clearly indicate that the nitrogen of C6N6 transferred more charge towards H2S.

            "text": "The electrical signal produced by an electrochemical sensor mainly depends on changes in its electronic properties after interaction with an analyte. To explore these changes in electronic properties of sensors, a frontier molecular orbital analysis was performed. The energy values determined from an FMO analysis of bare C6N6 and analyte@C6N6 complexes are shown in Table 3. The densities of HOMO and LUMO orbitals are presented in Figure 7. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO for C6N6 are \u22127.16 eV and \u22123.30 eV, respectively, with a HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap (EH-L gap) of 3.86 eV. The interaction of selected industrial pollutants with C6N6 causes prominent changes in the energy levels of the HOMO, LUMO and EH-L gap. The computed values of the EH-L gaps of HCN@C6N6, H2S@C6N6, NH3@C6N6 and PH3@C6N6 complexes are 4.02 eV, 2.76 eV, 2.58 eV and 3.35 eV, respectively.\nThe results presented in Table 3 show that adsorption of H2S, NH3 and PH3 on C6N6 causes a pronounced increase in the HOMO energy, while the LUMO energy of these complexes remains almost unchanged. However, adsorption of HCN shows the inverse behaviour, where a significant decrease in the HOMO energy (\u22127.43 eV) is noticed compared to C6N6 (\u22127.16 eV). A more pronounced decrease in the HOMO energy causes an increase in the EH-L gap (4.02 eV) of the HCN@C6N6 complex compared to bare C6N6 (3.86 eV). This increase in the EH-L gap of the HCN@C6N6 complex indicates a decrease in the conductivity of C6N6. As a result, C6N6 cannot act as a good sensor for HCN. Adsorption of H2S onto C6N6 resulted in a prominent increase in the energy of the HOMO (\u22126.07 eV), while the LUMO energy (\u22123.31 eV) is almost comparable to bare C6N6 (\u22123.30 eV). This increase in the HOMO energy resulted in a pronounced reduction in the EH-L gap (2.76 eV) of the H2S@C6N6 complex. Among the different industrial pollutants adsorbed on C6N6, the most significant increase in electrical conductivity is observed for the NH3@C6N6 complex due to an appreciable decrease in the EH-L gap. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO for the NH3@C6N6 complex are 5.85 eV and\u22123.27 eV, respectively. The interaction of PH3 changes the HOMO (\u22126.62 eV) and LUMO (\u22123.27 eV) energies in such a way that a negligible decrease in the EH-L gap (3.35 eV) is observed for the PH3@C6N6 complex. Among the studied analyte@C6N6 complexes, the highest decrease in the EH-L gap is observed for NH3@C6N6. This indicates that C6N6 can act as potential surface for this analyte. Thus, it is concluded that C6N6 is highly selective towards NH3 compared to the other studied analytes. After adsorption of industrial pollutants (HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3) onto C6N6, the dispersal of orbitals densities was also explored in order to comprehend the sensing abilities of C6N6. We observed three types of orbital distribution patterns. In the case of the HCN@C6N6 complex, the orbital densities are localized on the triazine ring. In the HOMO, the orbital densities are observed on the carbon and nitrogen of the triazine ring, while in the LUMO, the orbital densities are shifted to the carbon of the triazine ring. This shows that analytes do not participate in the electronic shift from the HOMO to the LUMO (see Figure 7).\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 15 of 20Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 22\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 16 of 20\nThe intra shift of electronic orbital densities causes an increase in the EH-L gap compared to bare C6N6. In H2S@C6N6 and PH3@C6N6 complexes, the major portion of the HOMO density is located on the analyte, with some sharing with the N atoms of C6N6, while the LUMO density is completely shifted onto C6N6. Such a type of electronic transition causes a significant change in the EH-L gap. A third type of electronic transition is observed in the NH3@C6N6 complex, where the HOMO is completely located on NH3, while the LUMO is shifted to C6N6 (see Figure 7). Such a type of electronic transition brings about a significant change in the EH-L gap. The same sort of behaviour was observed by us previously in a study of the same analytes over C2N. The transition of orbital density from analytes to the C2N surface causes considerable changes in the EH-L gaps [34,71,72]. We compared the adsorption energies of our studied system with those available in the literature for different COFs. The adsorption energies of H-containing analytes are comparable or somewhat higher than already reported values on other surfaces. An adsorption energy of \u221212.27 kcal/mol is observed for the NH3@C6N6 complex, whereas in the literature, adsorption energies of\u22125.27 kcal/mol, \u221210.68 kcal/mol and\u22126.65 kcal/mol are observed for NH3@CTF-FUM, NH3@C2N and NH3@CTF-0 complexes, respectively. In addition, interaction energies of \u221215.24 kcal/mol, \u22123.79 kcal/mol and \u22122.34 kcal/mol are observed for HCN@CTF-FUM, H2S@CTF-FUM and PH3@CTF-FUM, respectively. The adsorption energies of the rest of the complexes are given in Table 4 and reveal that C6N6 can act as a better surface for electrochemical sensing of H-containing analytes."

            "text": "The electrochemical sensing application of C6N6 is evaluated by DFT simulations at the wb97xd/6-31g(d,p) level of theory. The adsorption of industrial pollutants over C6N6 occurred through physisorption, with adsorption energies ranging from \u22129.36 kcal/mol to \u221216.46 kcal/mol. Among the considered analytes, the maximum energy is observed for HCN@C6N6 (\u221216.46 kcal/mol). The non-covalent interactions of analyte@C6N6 complexes are explored through symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT0), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analyses. The attractive components in SAPT0 analyses show that electrostatic and dispersive interactions play a dominant role in the stabilization of analytes in the C6N6 cavity. Similarly, NCI and QTAIM analyses also verified the findings of SAPT0 and interaction energy analyses. In addition, the electron density (\u03c1BCP) and Laplacian of electron density (\u22072\u03c1bcp) remained high for the HCN@C6N6 complex, which is consistent with the NCI and SAPT0 results. The electronic properties of analyte@C6N6 complexes are investigated by electron density difference (EDD), natural bond orbital analyses (NBO) and frontier molecular orbital analyses (FMO). Charge is transferred from the C6N6 sheet to HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3. The highest exchange of charge is noted for H2S (\u22120.026 e\u2212). The results of FMO analyses show that the interaction of all analytes results in changes in the EH-L gap of the C6N6 sheet. However, the highest decrease in the EH-L gap (2.58 eV) is observed for the NH3@C6N6\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1121 17 of 20\ncomplex compared to other studied analyte@C6N6 complexes. The orbital density pattern shows that the HOMO density is completely concentrated on NH3, while the LUMO density is transferred towards C6N6. This indicates that C6N6 can act as potential surface for these analytes. Hence, which analyte is more selective towards C6N6 depends on its electrical conductivity and not its adsorption. Thus, it is concluded that C6N6 is highly selective towards NH3 compared to the other studied analytes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano13061121/s1, Figure S1 caption: Optimized geometries of least stable complexes of each analyte over C6N6 at\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 22\nKeeping in view the above-mentioned characteristics of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), we selected a recently designed covalent triazine framework (C6N6), which contains six nitrogens in its cavity. Recently, C6N6 has been used in many fields such as catalysis [54], sensing [55], drug delivery [56] and energy storage [57]. These findings show that the C6N6 surface is more comparable to other available COFs for the detection of Hcontaining industrial pollutants such as HCN, H2S, NH3 and PH3. The high amount of nitrogen in the C6N6 unit also leads to a high surface area and a cavity size of 5.46 \u00c5, which can efficiently interact with various analytes through H bonding, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking or other types of chemical interactions. According to the best of our knowledge, C6N6 has not yet been tested as a sensor for the above-mentioned analytes. In the designed study, we used density functional theory simulations to investigate C6N6 as a sensor surface. Changes in geometrical properties are explored through NCI, QTAIM and SAPT0 analyses, while changes in the electronic properties of analytes in C6N6 complexes are determined by NBO, EDD and FMO analyses.\n2. Computational Methodology Gaussian 09 software was used to carry out the simulations in the current study. The selected g ometries of bare C6N6 and analyt @C6N6 complexes were investigated at the b97XD/6-31G (d, p) level of theory. The b97XD functional was adopted in the current study because it is a range-separated functional which can effectively capture non-localized intermolecular interactions [58]. In b97XD, the symbol \u201c\u201d represents the long range correction [59]. Additionally, the b97XD functional also contains Grimme\u2019s D2 dispersion factor to efficiently study the van der Waals (vdWs) interactions [59]. The changes in the electronic properties of C6N6 before and after adsorption of analytes were explored by NBO, EDD and FMO analyses at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. B3LYP/6-31G(d) is considered as the best to study the electronic changes of interacted systems [60\u201365]. The most stable configurations of the analyte@C6N6 complexes were investigated by adsorption of analytes through different orientations of C6N6. A frequency analysis was performed to confirm that the geometries of the complexes were true minima on the potential energy surface. The energies of adsorbed analytes in C6N6 are determined by Equation (1):\n\u2206E = [E(analytes@C6N6) \u2212 (EC6N6 + Eanalytes)] (1)\nwhere E(analytes@C6N6) is the interaction energy of the complexes, EC6N6 is the energy for bare C6N6 and Eanalytes is the energy of the industrial pollutants used as analytes. A SAPT0 analysis was applied to determine the role of the individual components of the interaction energy in the stabilization of the analyte@C6N6 complexes [66]. The total SAPT0 energy is the sum of four factors: induction (\u2206Eind), dispersion (\u2206Edisp), electrostatic (\u2206Eelstat) and exchange (\u2206Eexch). Hence, the SAPT0 energy is calculated through Equation (2):\n\u2206ESAPT0 = \u2206Eelstat + \u2206Eexch + \u2206Eind + \u2206Edisp (2)\nThe nature of adsorption, such as the electrostatic, dispersive and repulsive forces between the analyte and C6N6, was examined by an NCI analysis. The nature and strength of non-covalent interactions is given by the reduced density (s), Equation (3) [67].\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 = 1\n2(3\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b2) 1 3\n\u2207\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c4/3\n(3)\nThe value of electron density (\u03c1) for non-covalent interactions is generally very small. However, small changes in (\u03c1) result in prominent changes in RDG values, which appear in the form of spikes in a 2D-RGD plot. An NCI analysis characterizes non-covalent interactions through 3D-isosurfaces and 2D-RGD plots. These plots use \u03c1 and the second eigen value (\u03bb2) to differentiate between the nature of interactions [68\u201370].\nD/ -31G (d,p) level of theory.(HCN/C6N6 complexes (A-C), H2S/C6N6 complexes (D-F), NH3/C6N6 complexe (G-I), PH3/C6N6 complexes (J).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.Y. and H.H.H.; methodology, K.A.; software, K.A.; validation, K.A. and I.B.; formal analysis, I.B.; investigation, M.Y.; resources, H.H.H.; data curation, M.Y.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.H.H. and M.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.A.; visualization, M.Y.; supervision, H.H.H. and K.A.; project administrati n, H.H.H.; funding acquisition, H.H.H.
