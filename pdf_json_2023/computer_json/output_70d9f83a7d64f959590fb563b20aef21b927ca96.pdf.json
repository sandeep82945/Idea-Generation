    "abstractText": "Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) play a crucial role in the field of biomedical engineering, as they enable signal amplification and processing in various medical devices. With the increasing demand for portable and low-power biomedical devices, designing Op-Amps specifically tailored for such applications is essential. In response to this need, a low-power highgain Op-Amp designed for biomedical applications using TSMC 65nm technology has been proposed. This Op-Amp incorporates a two-stage miller compensated topology, which is well-known for its superior performance in gain, gain bandwidth product and power consumption. The proposed Op-Amp contributes to the field of biomedical engineering by offering a tailored solution that enhances signal processing capabilities, enables accurate data acquisition, and improves overall efficiency in healthcare systems. The design methodology and simulation results presented in this paper provide insights into the performance and potential impact of the Op-Amp in advancing biomedical devices and systems.

However, reduced supply voltage presents challenges for analog circuit designers due to degraded transistor characteristics and limitations in traditional techniques. This is crucial for biomeasurement devices, such as portable and battery-powered devices. Bio-potential amplifiers are commonly used to amplify ECG and EEG signals, requiring high input impedance, safety protections, low output impedance, minimal distortion, high gain, and a high common mode rejection ratio. Precise measurement and amplification of small and noisy bio-signals pose challenges [2].\nThis work aims to develop an operational amplifier for improved biomedical signal analysis (e.g. EEG and ECG signals). The objective is to design a low-noise, low-power amplifier to enhance measurement accuracy and reliability. By addressing challenges in signal analysis, our innovative design aims to improve monitoring quality and efficiency for medical professionals and patients."

            "text": "The schematic of the two-stage operational amplifier is shown in Fig. 6 and the step-by-step design procedure is described below.\nInput Referred Noise Voltage: We can start the design from the noise considerations. At a higher frequency range of operation, the Input Referred Noise Voltage of the amplifier is given by Eq. 1 [4].\nSn(f) = 2.4kT 2\n3\n1\ngm1,2 [1 + gm3,4 gm1,2 ] (1)\nFor a lower level of noise, we can assume gm3,4 << gm1,2 so the Eq. 1 transformed Eq. 2\ngm1,2 = 16\n3\nkT\nSn(f) (2)\nSo the value of gm1,2 can be directly calculated from 2.\nMiller Capacitance (Cc): For a given value of the gainbandwidth product (GBW), the compensation capacitance Cc can be calculated from the Eq. 3 [5].\nCc = gm1,2\n2\u03c0GBWHz (3)\nThe compensation capacitance Cc is an essential parameter for tuning the phase margin of the overall design. A phase margin of less than 60 degrees will lead to an unstable signal response at the output.\nSlew Rate: Slew Rate (as given by Eq. 4 [4]) is defined as the maximum rate at which an operational amplifier (op amp) can alter its output voltage in response to abrupt changes in the input voltage.\nSRI = 2.ID1 Cc = ID5 Cc\n(4)\nFrom the given slew rate specification the value of currents i.e. ID5 and ID1 can be easily calculated.\nGain of 1st Stage: As we know, Gain is equal to the product of transconductance and output resistance, so here the signal in the 1st stage (as shown in Fig. 6) flows from the input (i.e. M2) and flows to the output (i.e. M4) so transconductance is gm1,2 and the overall output resistance is 1gds1,2+gds3,4 and the overall gain of this stage is given by Eq. 5 [5].\nAV 1 = gm1,2\ngds1,2 + gds3,4 (5)\nAfter selecting a suitable value for the DC-gain (AV 1) of the first stage and assuming equal transconductance values (gds1,2 = gds3,4), we determine the transconductance value (gds1,2) using Fig.4a. Then, the effective width (W) is determined by finding the intersection point between gm2/ID2 and the selected length curve obtained from the previous step on the second sizing chart (Fig. 4c) to determine VGS1, which is used in the calculation of (W/L)3,4.\nGain of 2nd Stage: Similarly, as above, the Gain of 2nd Stage is given by Eq. 6.\nAV 2 = gm6\ngds6 + gds7 (6)\nWe design the active load for the first stage (M3, M4) using the specified values of gds3,4 and ID3,4. Referring to Fig. 5c, and compute the correct (gm/ID)3,4 using VGS3,4 and L3,4. It is crucial to verify this calculated value before proceeding. If the computed current efficiency exceeds our assumption, indicating a lower gain, we need to reassess (gm/ID)3,4 and recalculate L3,4. Conversely, if the computed current efficiency falls below the assumed value, indicating a higher gain, our assumption of (gm/ID)3,4 is appropriate. Finally, using the second sizing chart, Fig. 5b, we determine the effective width (W3,4).\nCommon Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR): It is a parameter that measures an operational amplifier\u2019s ability to reject common signals at its input terminals. Mathematically, CMRR is the ratio of differential mode gain and common mode gain, which is given as per Eq. 7 [5].\nCMRR = Avd ACM = gm1,2 gds1,2 + gds3,4 .2gm3,4.Rss (7)\ngds5 = 1\nRss (8)\nTo determine the aspect ratio (W/L)5 of M5, we compute the transconductance value gds5 using Eq. 8, and assume ID5 = 2 \u2217 ID4. Employing a similar approach as before, we apply the methodology to calculate (W/L)5.\nCurrent Ratio of M1 and M6: From the slew ratios of compensation capacitance and load capacitance, the current ratios can be derived as per Eq. 9 [4].\nID1 ID6 \u2264 CC 2(CL + CC)\n(9)\nPhase Margin: Phase margin measures the amount of additional phase shift that can be introduced into the system before instability occurs. For design considerations, we have used the dominant pole concept and have derived the equation (Eq. 10) for Phase Margin.\nPM\u25e6 = 90\u25e6 \u2212 tan\u22121 [ GBW\np2\n] \u2212 tan\u22121 [ GBW\nz1\n] (10)\nWe have also defined a Phase Margin control parameter (\u03b1) which is given in Eq. 11. This parameter \u03b1 acts as a controlling knob for the Phase Margin of the overall system.\nlet, \u03b1 = gm1 ID1 gm6 ID6\n(11)\nPM\u25e6 = 90\u25e6 \u2212 tan\u22121 [ \u03b1 ID1 ID6 CL Cc ] \u2212 tan\u22121 [ \u03b1 ID1 ID6 ] (12)\nTo attain the desired phase margin as specified in Eq. 12. By following a similar methodology employed to determine\n(W/L)1 and (W/L)2, we can determine the aspect ratio (W/L)6 for M6.\nDesign of 2nd Stage and Current Mirror (M8): The device width ratio in the current mirror configuration, such as (M5 and M8), is equal to the current ratio. Therefore, the width of device 8 (W8) can be determined using Eq. 13 [6].\nW8 \u2248 2 3 W5 ID8 ID5 (13)\nTo support the suggested process, a two-stage operational amplifier (as depicted in Fig. 6) is designed using the gm/ID methodology and simulated utilizing the 65 nm Low Voltage Threshold (lvt) MOSFET (tsmcN65 technology)."
