1. **Investigate the role of SL in SDT in vivo.** Despite the promising results obtained in vitro, the role of SL in SDT in vivo is still unclear. Future studies should focus on developing methods to measure SL in vivo and investigate the relationship between SL and the therapeutic efficacy of SDT.


2. **Develop ROS-generating nanoplatforms that can overcome the limitations of conventional ROS-based therapies.** Conventional ROS-based therapies are often limited by factors such as poor tumor penetration, low specificity, and off-target effects. Future studies should focus on developing ROS-generating nanoplatforms that can overcome these limitations and improve the therapeutic efficacy of ROS-based therapies.


3. **Explore the use of ROS-generating nanoplatforms for the treatment of other diseases.** ROS-based therapies have shown promise for the treatment of cancer, but they may also be effective for the treatment of other diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Future studies should explore the use of ROS-generating nanoplatforms for the treatment of these diseases.


4. **Develop methods for the real-time monitoring of ROS levels in vivo.** The ability to monitor ROS levels in vivo would be a valuable tool for the development and optimization of ROS-based therapies. Future studies should focus on developing methods for the real-time monitoring of ROS levels in vivo, such as the development of fluorescent probes or biosensors that can detect ROS.


5. **Investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of ROS-generating nanoplatforms.** The long-term safety and efficacy of ROS-generating nanoplatforms are still unknown. Future studies should focus on investigating the long-term safety and efficacy of ROS-generating nanoplatforms in animal models and clinical trials.
