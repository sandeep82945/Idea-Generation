    "abstractText": "Nanocomposites based on 13X zeolite (13XZ), calcium oxide (CaO) and metal zinc particles (Zn) were prepared. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized by different techniques. Then, a comparative study on catalytic and noncatalytic pyrolysis of biomass waste was performed to establish the influence of nanocomposites used as catalysts on the yields and characteristics of liquid and solid products. Residual rapeseed biomass (RRB) was employed for pyrolysis experiments and a fixed bed reactor was used. By introducing CaO and metal zinc particles into 13X zeolite mass, the surface area (SBET) of nanocomposites was reduced, and this decrease is due to the introduction of nano-calcium carbonate and nano-zinc particles, which occupied an important space into zeolite structure. By adding CaO to 13XZ, the pore structure was changed and there was a decrease in the micropores volume. The analysis of the pore area distribution showed a hierarchical pore structure for nanocomposites. The elements composition showed that the main elements contained in nanocomposites are Si, Al, Ca and Zn, confirming the preservation of the zeolite structure. Using these nanocomposites as catalysts in pyrolysis process, the residual biomass could be valorized, producing bio-oil and biochar for the management and sustainability of this low-value waste.",

            "text": "Environmental pollution and degradation (air, water, and soil) is continuously increasing and, to reduce the consequences, the development of new depollution techniques is required [1\u20133]. A cause of the increase in pollution is represented by agricultural wastes that, by decomposing, produce environment pollution when stored on the soil. The recovery of these wastes removes the problems related to their storage, reduces pollution and contamination of the soil and air, and ensures their recycling into useful products [4,5]. For this purpose, valuable products, such as bio-oil, biochar and bio-syngas, can be obtained by thermochemical processing (pyrolysis and gasification) of these biomass wastes [6,7]. One such residual biomass is represented by rapeseed waste, including straw, leaves, pods or rapeseed cake resulting from the extraction of oil from rape seeds, a solid residue rich in organic compounds with a high content of volatile compounds and carbon [8]. The bio-oil produced has applications in the production of fuels [9,10], and biochar can be a good amendment for degraded soils, it offers many advantages, including an improved soil structure and, also, a reduced potential for heavy metal leaching. This is due to its characteristics, such as a relatively large surface area, high pH, high organic C content and the presence of functional groups that can bind to contaminants [11\u201315]. It can also be a good adsorbent material, as well as a material with catalytic properties [16,17]. In addition to bio-oil and biochar, biomass waste pyrolysis produces a gas fraction (known as bio-syngas), which can be collected and utilized as an alternative to fossil fuels [18].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12213841 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841 2 of 25\nIn recent years, researchers have increased their interest in the valorization of waste from the rape crops and, in this context, new methods for the production of fuels from rapeseed were developed [19], and new methods for renewable energy and biochar production from rapeseed were developed and studied [20]. Rapeseed is one of the most widely planted crops and, after harvesting the rapeseed, the removal of the stalks and pods remains a problem, as well as the residue left after extracting the oil from the seeds; they have no clear utility and returning them to the land is not a sustainable solution. Therefore, the most common elimination, open burning, remained uncontrolled, causing environmental pollution. However, the residual biomass from rapeseed crops represents a particularly promising source of raw material that can be exploited for the production of fuels and biochar [20]. Rapeseed cake, seeds and straw, collected from various areas, have been pyrolyzed by various researchers under different conditions [21\u201323]. In any case, full-scale characterization studies considering the production of fuels and biochar from residual rapeseed biomass are not quite few in the literature. For example, the biochar was obtained under different pyrolysis temperatures, various heating rates and pyrolysis residence times [21,22], with the aim to establish the relationships with yield of biochar, its pH, and functional groups. Different techniques of investigation were used, such as proximate analysis, elemental analysis, surface area and pores, and surface morphology. These results helped to determine the relationship between the conditions of pyrolysis and the physical and chemical properties of biochar produced from rapeseed residual biomass, and thus supported the establishment of the optimal pyrolysis conditions to maximize the beneficial use and to improve its environmental management. The annual global production of rapeseed is estimated to be several million tonnes; hence, the importance of rapeseed as an energy crop is rising [24]. There are some studies about the investigation of processing of rapeseed by pyrolysis process under various conditions to produce bio-oil that can be processed to fuel [25\u201327]. For example, gross calorific value of bio-oil produced from rapeseed biomass wastes ranges around 18.5\u201320.5 MJ/kg [26,27] and this makes rapeseed biomass waste a suitable source for bio-oil production for fuel applications. The thermochemical conversion of biomass includes combustion, gasification, pyrolysis and liquefaction as main processes. Among these, pyrolysis attracted attention to a greater extent because it is able to convert the biomass in various forms of energy, such as biofuel (liquid), biochar (solid) and gaseous products. The carbonization of the materials in the absence or low oxygen content in a range of temperatures of 400 to 700 \u25e6C is known as pyrolysis process [28,29]. The products resulting from pyrolysis process can be used as hydrocarbon feedstocks, which represents the primary resource for bio-refineries [30]. The bio-oil resulting from pyrolysis presents several disadvantages, such as lower pH value (increased acidity), high viscosity, lower heating capacity and a higher oxygen content, which decrease the bio-oil stability during storage and reduce the flame temperature when it is used as fuel for engines [31,32]. These disadvantages can be removed by improving fuel quality using different methods, such as catalytic cracking and deoxygenation [33,34]. To achieve this goal, new types of catalysts must be developed. Together with other catalysts, nanocomposites based on zeolites and metal oxides could be effective in such applications. Hari Prasad Reddy Kannapu et al. [33] studied pyrolysis of sawdust for production of biojet fuels using activated carbon catalysts with various contents of MgO. The catalysts have a high potential in the conversion of oxygenated compounds to the jet fuel. They concluded that the nanosized particles of MgO and the acid and base sites of catalysts enhanced the deoxygenation reactions by decarboxylation and decarbonylation, which are required for fuel formation in high amounts from waste biomass pyrolysis. Jilai Wu et al. [34] studied the fast pyrolysis of alkali lignin in black liquor in a fixed bed reactor to prepare biochemicals. The effect of NaOH catalyst on the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the effect of pyrolysis temperature and the catalyst-to-lignin ratio on the yield and relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons were investigated. The results showed that the addition of NaOH increased the in situ H2 supply and improved the removal of methoxyl groups;\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841 3 of 25\nthus, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased and oxygen content decreased. Putun Ersan [35] studied the pyrolysis of cotton seeds at 550 \u25e6C, with and without catalysts, and the obtained results demonstrated that the use of catalysts reduced the yield of bio-oil but improved its quality regarding the calorific value, removal of oxygenated compounds and changed the hydrocarbon distribution. Moreover, the metal oxide nanocatalysts, such as Al2O3 and MgO, act on the active site of biomass, such as biomass pore, and improve the physical properties, so it is presented in a recent study [36]. In addition, the use of metal nanocatalysts assures a higher catalytic efficiency due to low co-ordinated sites, which increase the reaction rate and reduce the catalyst amount used [37]. The use of zeolite having nanoparticles in framework structure significantly increases the aromatic hydrocarbon content and decreases the oxygenated compounds from bio-oil composition [34]. It was also observed that the use of zeolite catalyst decreased the liquid yield and increased the yield of char and gas [38]. The analysis of the literature in the field highlights that few studies are reported and refer to the use of nanocomposites based on zeolite in the pyrolysis of residual rapeseed biomass (RRB) for the production of renewable fuel (bio-oil) and char with properties improved. With these findings, and according to the authors\u2019 knowledge, the catalytic pyrolysis of RRB using cheap catalysts has not been studied extensively and in detail. Thus, this experimental study focused on the synthesis and characterization of nanocomposites based on zeolite 13X, calcium oxide and metal zinc particles, the use of these nanomaterials in pyrolysis process and the analysis of the effect of operating parameters, such as temperature, heating rate, biomass particles size, carrier gas flow rate (N2), as well as the impact of the nanocatalyst loading degree on the yield and characteristics of bio-oil produced. Further, based on the physical and chemical characteristics, the liquid (bio-oil) and solid (biochar) products were characterized by different techniques, such as elemental analysis (CHNS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), gross caloric value (GCV), gas chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy analysis (GC\u2013MS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and water holding capacity (WHC).

The results showed that the addition of NaOH increased the in situ H2 supply and improved the removal of methoxyl groups; thus, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased and oxygen content decreased. Putun Ersan [35] studied the pyrolysis of cotton seeds at 550 \u00b0C, with and without catalysts, and the obtained results demonstrated that the use of catalysts reduced the yield of bio-oil but improved its quality regarding the calorific value, removal of oxygenated compounds and changed the hydrocarbon distribution. Moreover, the metal oxide nanocatalysts, such as Al2O3 and MgO, act on the active site of biomass, such as biomass pore, and improve the physical properties, so it is presented in a recent study [36]. In addition, the use of metal nanocatalysts assures a higher catalytic efficiency due to low co-ordinated sites, which increase the reaction rate and reduce the catalyst amount used [37]. The use of zeolite having nanoparticles in framework structure significantly increases the aromatic hydrocarbon content and decreases the oxygenated compounds from bio-oil composition [34]. It was also bserved that the use of zeolite catalyst decreased the liquid yield and increased the yield of char and g s [38]. The analysis of the literature in t field highlights that few studies are reported and refer to the use of nanocomposites based on zeolite in he pyrolysis of residual rapeseed biomass (RRB) for the producti n of renewable fuel (bio-oil) and char with properties improved.

Materials and Methods 2.1. Residual Rapeseed Biomass\nIn this study, residual rapeseed biomass (RRB) that included straw, leaves and pods was used, and this was collected from the local area (Figure 1a,b).\nThe RRB was dried at 105 \u25e6C for 6 h and, then, was shredded and sieved and stored in airtight glass containers to avoid the absorption of humidity. The resulting biomass\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841 4 of 25\nwas labeled as residual rapeseed biomass (RRB). The moisture, fixed carbon, volatile and ash content, the ultimate and proximate analysis were determined according to standards ASTM D 2016 74, D3174 89, D1102 84 and ASTM 128 D 5373 using a Carlo Elba 1106 instrument. The RRB composition was determined according to ASTM D 3176 and the ASTM D240-02 standard was employed to determine the gross calorific value (GCV). The extractives and lignocellulosic content of RRB was established using TAPPI method, as is presented in the reference [39]. The proximate and ultimate analysis results are presented in Table 1. The organic structure of RRB was established by Fourier infrared spectroscopy and an FTIR spectrometer Nicolet 6700 was used. The dried sample was blended with KBr and the resulting mixture was placed in the sample holder. The scanning was performed at the rate of 40 with a step size of 4 cm\u22121 and in a wavelength range of 400\u20133900 cm\u22121. Moreover, the bio-oil FTIR analysis was made using attenuated total reflectance (ATR). A small drop of bio-oil was placed on the ATR crystal surface and the analysis was made with the procedure described above. The thermal stability of RRB was determined by thermal analysis using a TGA analyzer type Netzsch, TG-209 F1 Libra in a N2 gas atmosphere. About 10.0 \u00b1 0.2 mg of solid sample was heated from room temperature to 900 \u25e6C at 10 \u25e6C/min heating rate, with a N2 flow rate of 50 mL/min."

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the nanocomposites morphology (SEM) and a microscope JSM7500 F (JOEL-Japan, Tokyo, Japan), operated at 10 kV, was used, using gold coating. The TPD-NH3 experiment was performed to analyze the acid-based characteristics of the fresh nanocomposites (catalysts). A TPD Nuchrom analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector was used to perform the TPD-NH3 experiment. Moreover, the TPD CO2 experiment was used to investigate the adsorption characteristics of the nanocomposites (catalysts) used in the pyrolysis process. For each experiment, 0.2 g of sample was used and the procedure was as follows. The sample was pretreated for 30 min at 250 \u25e6C and, after, the sample was cooled to room temperature, using He as carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. Then, the sample was absorbed by NH3 or CO2 gas until saturation level; this step lasted for 10 min. After that, the sample was heated according to the conditions of temperature programmed, such as heating rate at 10 \u25e6C/min and the He gas flow rate of 40 mL/min.

Figure 9a presents the NH3-TPD diagram of 1# 13XZ and Figure 9b shows the NH3TPD diagrams of 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocomposites, respectively. The 1# 13XZ fresh material showed three peaks of desorption that can be associated with the presence of acid sites, weak sites for the peak that appeared at temperature range of 105 to 120 \u25e6C, sites with medium acidity for the peak appearing at the range 185 to 210 \u25e6C), and sites with strong acidity for the peak appearing at 390 to 410 \u25e6C, respectively. After the addition of CaO and impregnation of Zn(NO)3.6H2O, the sites with weak acidity remained largely unchanged but the corresponding peak substantially decreased. On the other hand, it can be observed that the intensity of the peak corresponding to strongly acidic sites increased substantially after the addition of CaO as well as Zn. For 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocomposites, it appeared there was another strong acid site corresponding to 580\u2013620 \u25e6C. In 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ catalysts, the acidity increased, which could be due to the creation of new sites with acidic character by introducing of CaO and Zn on the support. The dispersion of CaO and Zn particles on support modifies the acid character of catalysts by reducing the number of Br\u00f6nsted sites but increasing the number of Lewis sites. According to these findings, the increase in total acidity resulted from the increase in the number of Lewis acid sites [31,32]. The decrease in the number of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites may be related to the addition of CaO and, also, of the impregnation process with the metal precursor when maybe some hydrogen ions (H+) present in the zeolitic support were exchanged by Ca or Zn ions.

At the higher pyrolysis temperature of 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively, the gas yield increased (28.32 wt.% for 600 \u00b0C and 38.01 wt.% for 650 \u00b0C, respectively), while the liquid and solid yield decreased (Figure 10a). These results are due to a rapid process of decomposition of biomass components into non-condensable volatile gaseous compounds. The influence of heating rate on product yield is shown in Figure 10b. It was noticed that, for a heating rate of 75 \u00b0C/min, a maximum liquid yield of 48.37 wt.% was obtained, while the char yield was 27.26 wt.% and the gas yield was 24.35 wt.%, respectively, much lower. These results are due to a maximum transfer of mass and heat between the particles that led to a complete pyrolysis of the biomass and to a maximum of volatile compounds released. On the other hand, it was found that, at lower heating rates, such as 25 or 50 \u00b0C/min, the char yield was higher, while the liquid and gas fraction was reduced, these results being due to a lower transfer of mass and heat between biomass particles and an incomplete biomass pyrolysis.

These resul s are due to a rapid process of decomposition of biomass compon nts into non-condensable volatile g seous compounds. The influence of heating rat on product yield is shown in Figure 10b. It was noticed that, for a heating rate of 75 \u25e6C/min, a maximum iquid yi ld of 48.37 wt.% w s obtained, while the char yield was 27.26 wt.% and the gas y eld was 24.35 wt.%, respectively, much lower. These results are due to a maximum transfer of mass and h at b tween the particles that led to a complet pyrolysis of the biomass and to maximum of volatile compou s released. On the ot r hand, it was found that, at lower heating rates, such as 25 or 50 \u25e6C/min, the char yield was igher, while the liquid and gas fraction was reduced, th se results being due to lower transfer of mass and heat between biomass particles and an incomplete biomass pyrol sis. Further, at high h ating rat , such a 100 or 110 \u25e6C/min, the gas yield increased s g ificantly (28.14 wt.% for 100 \u25e6C/min or 34.26 wt.% for 110 \u25e6C/min, respectively), while the liquid a d solid yields decreased, which prove that, at high h ating rates, a fast endothermic process of decompositio of biomass into non-condensable gases takes place, these results being n agreement i h other studies [21,35]. The effect of biomass partic e siz on the product yield is shown in Figure 10c. I can be observed that the maximu for bio- il yield (48.16 wt.%) was obtained for 0.5 mm biomass particle size, while the c a and gas yields were lower (27.71 and 24.12 wt.%, respectively) and this is due to a high mass and heat transfer between the particles of biomass taking place; the small biomass particl size h s bigg r surfac area, which determines a maximum mass and heat transfer betw en particles nd much more volatiles are formed that are condensable and transform in the bio-oil. Moreover, the small biomass particles were rapid and uniformly heated due to high heat transfer. On the other hand,\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841 16 of 25\nit was observed that, at a bigger particle size, such as 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mm, the bio-oil and gas yields decreased, whereas the char yield increased and these results are due to an incomplete pyrolysis because the larger biomass particles have a lower surface area and, as a consequence, a reduced heat transfer takes place and a formation of a smaller amount of condensable and non-condensable volatiles. The influence of the carrier gas flow on the product yield is presented in Figure 10d. The maximum bio-oil yield of 49.24 wt.% resulted for a 80 mL/min gas flow rate, whereas the gas and char yields at the same gas flow rate were of 21.74 and 29.01 wt.%, respectively. At a lower gas flow rate (i.e., 40 mL/min), a higher char yield of 34.61 wt.% was obtained and gas and bio-oil yields decreased (18.43 wt.% and 46.95 wt.%, respectively). The increased char yield was due probably to the secondary reactions that took place and which led to the formation of more char. On other hand, at higher gas flow rates of 100 or 120 mL/min, the liquid yield (47.26 wt.% and 42.67 wt.%) and char yield (28.57 wt.% and 22.47 wt.%) decreased, while the yield of gas increased (24.16 wt.% and 34.85 wt.%). This behavior is probably due to the increase in the transport speed of the formed vapors that did not have enough time to decompose into condensable products and, thus, the liquid fraction decreased. All the results presented in this work are in agreement with other studies in the field [21,35]. Analyzing the results obtained, in terms of the effects of temperature, heating rate, biomass particle size as well as carrier gas flow, it can be concluded that a temperature of 550 \u25e6C, heating rate of 75 \u25e6C/min, 0.5 mm biomass particle size and a carrier gas flow rate of 80 mL/min may be the optimal parameters for the pyrolysis process."

A biomass/catalyst (B/C) ratio of 5:1 (respectively, the introduction of a quantity of\n20% catalyst) produced a bio-oil yield of 49.14\u00b1 1.12, 50.37\u00b1 1.15 and 52.16\u00b1 1.20 wt.% for 1# 13XZ, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ, respectively, compared to an average amount of 48.88 \u00b1 1.20 wt.% obtained without catalyst. This increase is due to the interaction between the biomass and the catalyst, which favored the decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions and more volatiles were condensed into liquid [51]. From Figure 11, it can be seen that, at a loading of 10 wt.% catalyst, the bio-oil yield was smaller due to lower interaction between biomass particles and catalysts, except for 1# 13XZ catalyst. In the case of 1# 13XZ, a loading of 10 wt.% catalyst probably ensured that pyrolysis vapors enter in the pores of the 13X zeolite, which were not blocked by the presence of CaO and Zn, instead of being mostly adsorbed on the external surface of the catalyst, as probably happened in the case of catalysts 2# and 3#. Moreover, at a lower catalyst loading, the decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions did not take place significantly, which determined a lower bio-oil yield, as was also reported in the study by Anand et al. [52]. Moreover, it was found that, at higher loading of catalyst (25 wt.%), the bio-oil yield decreased, while the char yield increased, compared with a catalyst loading of 20 wt.%. This could be due to the coke that resulted during higher loading of catalysts that contributed to the increasing of the char yield. In these conditions, the biomass pores probably were blocked due to a higher loading of catalyst, which determined a higher resistance between biomass and catalyst and the interaction was weaker; thus, the bio-oil yield decreased."

Biomass pyrolysis in the presence of nanocatalysts reduced the oxygen content from bio-oil composition (12.08, 11.75 and 11.07 wt.% for 1#,2# and 3# nanocatalysts, respectively) compared with 26.81 wt.% without catalyst. This reduction was due to the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen molecules with the formation of water, which further passed into the gaseous phase. The presence in the bio-oil of high content of oxygenated compounds decreased energy density, gross caloric value (GCV) and increased the fuel viscosity. It was observed that the use of nanocatalysts reduced the bio-oil viscosity (as can be seen in Table 4); this could be explained by the fact that the molecules of oxygen reacted with the hydrogen and the resulting water reduced the bio-oil viscosity by decreasing the oxygenated compounds from bio-oil. As can be seen from the data presented in Table 4, although the use of catalysts in the pyrolysis process reduced the viscosity of the bio-oil, it still has a high value compared to that of diesel, which indicates that further treatment is needed substantially to obtain a bio-oil with characteristics similar to diesel. Moreover, the results obtained in the presence of catalysts show that the moisture content increased compared to the bio-oil obtained in the absence of catalysts, which proves that the presence of catalysts favored dehydration reactions, findings presented in other studies [20,54]. Moreover, the use of nanocatalysts led to obtaining bio-oil with increased GCV and lower acidity compared with the bio-oil produced without catalyst use (Table 4).

By GC\u2013MS analysis of non-catalyst pyrolysis bio-oil, it was determined that there was 8.21% hydrocarbons, 14.05% esters, 4.79% ethers, 2.84% alcohol, 10.65% acids, 5.02% ethers 1.26% aldehyde, 8.98% compound with nitrogen and 3.44% ketones. These results showed that the bio-oil had in its composition a high fraction of oxygenated compounds and acids that decreased the quality of the bio-oil. Furthermore, the use of catalysts increased the fraction of hydrocarbons (12.23%, 12.75% and 11.72% for 1# 13XZ, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ, respectively) and this could be due the decarboxylation reaction during pyrolysis in the presence of nanocatalysts, which led to the formation of more hydrocarbons [51,52]. The reactions of decarboxylation employ carboxyl groups and these are removed as carbon dioxide molecules. Moreover, it was observed that the use of catalysts decreased the amount of acids (the area percentage was 8.46%, 6.14% and 5.07% for 1# 13XZ, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ, respectively) compared with 10.65% for pyrolysis biooil obtained without catalysts. This behavior possibly is due to the fact the nanocatalysts favored the conversion of acids into aldehydes, whose percentage is slightly increased in the presence of nanocatalysts (4.97%, 2.55% and 2.92% for 1# 13XZ, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ, respectively) compared with 1.26% for pyrolysis bio-oil obtained without catalysts.

The results obtained by GC\u2013MS analysis showed that the use of nanocatalysts decreased the phenols percentage (from 3.17% without catalyst to 1.56%, 1.07% and 1.16% for 1# 13XZ, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ, respectively), which probably were converted in hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the area percentages of ketones and esters were reduced due to the dehydration reaction during pyrolysis with the formation of water, which contributed to the viscosity reduction (Table 4). Moreover, the nanocatalyst use decreased the compounds containing nitrogen, probably due the reactions of deamination. These results are in good agreement with other studies [55,56] and, based on them, it can be affirmed that the bio-oil obtained by catalytic pyrolysis could be an alternative to fossil fuels.

CaO from the catalyst composition absorbs a quantity of CO2 and transforms into CaCO3, as presented in Section 3.2. It can be observed from Figure 14 that the 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocatalyst presented a difference on gas composition with the number of cycles. For the first cycle, the gas produced contained 4.31% CO and 40.21 CO2. It is possible that the amount of CO2 was initially higher but a part was absorbed by CaO from the catalyst composition. At the second cycle, the absorption of CO2 by CaO probably continued with the further formation of CaCO3 and, as a result, the concentration of CO2 decreased compared to the first cycle, from 40.21% to 37.68%, respectively. In the third cycle, the CO2 amount was still reduced (36.47%), which means that the carbonation process of CaO continued. In the fourth and fifth cycles, the amount of CO2 increased again, which would be explained by the completion of the transformation process of CaO into CaCO3 after cycle 3 and, in cycle 4 and 5, the CaCO3 progressively decomposed, leading to the restoration of CaO and an increase in the amount of CO2 due to both the release from CaCO3 and the promotion of cracking reactions by CaO. It can also be observed that the CO2 concentration in gaseous product increased gradually, which indicated a lower carbonation reaction of CaO with the cycles\u2019 number and this could also be explained by the produced coke and ash adhering to the catalyst surface, producing deactivation. These results also explain the better behavior of catalyst 3# compared to catalyst 2#, because the zinc content of catalyst 3# maintained a better activity [57,58]. Figure 15 shows the SEM images for 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ after the five cycles of pyrolysis and this could be compared with the SEM image for fresh 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ catalyst from Figure 8d.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n3# -1st 3# - 2nd 3# - 3rd 3# - 4th 3# - 5th\nGa s c\nom po\nsit io\nn( %\n)\nH2 CO CO2 CH4 N2\nFigure 14.

In the fourth and fifth cycles, the amount of CO2 i creased again, which would be explained\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3841 22 of 25\nby the completion of the transformation process of CaO into CaCO3 after cycle 3 and, in cycle 4 and 5, the CaCO3 progressively decomposed, leading to the restoration of CaO and an increase in the amount of CO2 due to both the release from CaCO3 and the promotion of cracking reactions by CaO.

Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 23 of 26\nAs can be seen, some particles were partially agglomerated; however, the structure of the specific skeleton of the nanocatalyst was maintained and is similar to the structure of the fresh catalyst, as can be seen from the SEM images (Figures 8d and 15). These findings prove that the 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocatalyst maintains its stability after five pyrolysis cycles.\n4. Conclusions The bifunctional CaO/13XZ and CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocomposite materials were prepared and their catalytic performances were evaluated for biomass pyrolysis. The nanocomposites based on 13X zeolite, CaO and metal zinc particles were characterized to investigate their textural characteristics, acidity properties, catalytic performances and the cyclic stability. It was found that the CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocomposite used as nanocatalyst presented both adsorption sites and activated acid sites, which were involved in deoxygenation and cracking reactions for bio-oil production. The surface area of 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocatalysts was smaller than that of the initial 13X zeolite (13XZ). The 1# 13XZ nanomaterial showed three peaks of NH3 desorption that were associated with the presence of acid sites (weak, medium and strong acidity sites). After addition of CaO and impregnation of Zn(NO)3.6H2O, the sites with weak acidity remained largely unchanged but the corresponding peak substantially decreased. On the other hand, it can be observed that the intensity of the peak corresponding to strongly acidic sites increased substantially after the addition of CaO as well as Zn. The CO2-TPD analysis showed that the used 1# 13XZ did not respond to the CO2-TPD test and, with the temperature increasing, no peak of significant intensity appeared. However, 2# CaO/13XZ and 3# CaOZn/13XZ nanocomposites showed clear intensity peaks in the temperature range 390\u2013410 \u00b0C and 580\u2013620 \u00b0C, respectively. These could be attributed to the decomposition of CaCO3 that was probably formed during the pyrolysis process by combining the resulting CO2 with the CaO present in the mass of the nanocatalysts. Further, the effect of these nanocomposites (nanocatalysts) on pyrolysis product yield, as well as the physico-chemical properties of bio-oil, was evaluated. It was observed that the CaO-Zn/13XZ nanocatalyst showed both adsorption and activated acid sites, which were involved in the deoxygenation and cracking reactions to improve the bio-oil quality. Moreover, a part of the amount of CO2 released by pyrolysis was captured in the mass of the catalysts due to the CaO content, and a gaseous fraction with a lower CO2 content was obtained. These results show that these types of nanocomposites have good characteristics and stability and can be employed in the biomass pyrolysis process to obtain bio-oil with improved quality which can be used as an alternative to fossil fuel.\nAuthor Contributions: E.D.: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing\u2014original draft, Writing\u2014review and editing, Visualization.
