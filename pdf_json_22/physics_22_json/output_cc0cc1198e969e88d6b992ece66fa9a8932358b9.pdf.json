    "abstractText": "Visible and near-infrared spectrum photonic integrated circuits are quickly becoming a key technology to address the scaling challenges in quantum information and biosensing. Thus far, integrated photonic platforms in this spectral range have lacked integrated photodetectors. Here, we report silicon nitride-on-silicon waveguide photodetectors that are monolithically integrated in a visible light photonic platform on silicon. Owing to a leaky-wave silicon nitride-on-silicon design, the devices achieved a high external quantum efficiency of >60% across a record wavelength span from \u03bb ~ 400 nm to ~640 nm, an opto-electronic bandwidth up to 9 GHz, and an avalanche gainbandwidth product up to 173 \u00b1 30 GHz. As an example, a photodetector was integrated with a wavelength-tunable microring in a single chip for on-chip power monitoring.",

Poon 1,2\nVisible and near-infrared spectrum photonic integrated circuits are quickly becoming a key technology to address the scaling challenges in quantum information and biosensing. Thus far, integrated photonic platforms in this spectral range have lacked integrated photodetectors. Here, we report silicon nitride-on-silicon waveguide photodetectors that are monolithically integrated in a visible light photonic platform on silicon. Owing to a leaky-wave silicon nitride-on-silicon design, the devices achieved a high external quantum efficiency of >60% across a record wavelength span from \u03bb ~ 400 nm to ~640 nm, an opto-electronic bandwidth up to 9 GHz, and an avalanche gainbandwidth product up to 173 \u00b1 30 GHz. As an example, a photodetector was integrated with a wavelength-tunable microring in a single chip for on-chip power monitoring.\nSilicon (Si) photonics leverages microelectronics fabrication in foundries to mass manufacture dense and complex photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Extending Si photonics into the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (\u03bb ~ 400\u2212800nm)1\u20135 can bring PICs to an even wider range of emerging applications, including spectroscopy and flow cytometry6,7, neurophotonics8\u201310, quantum information processing5,11,12, underwater communication13, and scanning displays14\u201316. In Si photonics for the visible and NIR wavelength range, the optical waveguide is typically formed in a silicon nitride (SiN) or aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer surrounded by a silicon dioxide (SiO2) cladding on a Si or siliconon-insulator (SOI) substate. Thus far, on 100, 200, or 300-mmdiameter Si wafers, visible/NIR photonic platforms with SiN3,5,17\u201321 or Al2O3 3,4 waveguides are usually passive, containing components such as gratings, power splitters, and interferometers, with waveguide phaseshifters tuned by the thermo-optic or strain-optic effect5,22\u201324. Postfabrication processing and heterogeneous integration steps are used to incorporate liquid crystal phase-shifters25, lasers26,27, and photodetectors (PDs)28,29 with SiN waveguides. On-chip optical-to-electrical conversion is an essential functionality in a PIC platform. In visible and NIR Si photonics, the Si substrate serves as a natural candidate for light absorption compatible with monolithic integration, circumventing heterogeneous integration that increases the fabrication complexity. Si PDs are conventionally surface incident, but in PICs, waveguide PDs are preferred since they can be easily integrated with other in-plane circuit components. The main challenge in realizing a broadband, high-efficiencywaveguide PD is the input waveguide-to-Si coupling, which can exhibit significant wavelength dependence across the visible and NIR spectral bands. One approach is to use the SOI device layer for photodetection and an overhead waveguide to achieve leaky-wave coupling. However, such designs are complicated by the presence ofmultiple Si slabmodes that hybridize with the waveguide mode when their effective indices are\nReceived: 1 May 2022\nAccepted: 13 October 2022\nCheck for updates\n1Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Weinberg 2, 06120 Halle, Germany. 2Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King\u2019s College Road, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G4, Canada. 3Advanced Micro Foundry Pte Ltd, 11 Science Park Road, Singapore Science Park II, 117685 Singapore, Singapore. e-mail: yidinlin@mpi-halle.mpg.de; joyce.poon@mpi-halle.mpg.de\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:6362 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nsimilar, resulting in resonance-likepeaks in the absorption spectrumat wavelengths where the phase-matching condition is met30\u201332. Another approach is to end-fire couple the input waveguide to a Si absorption region as in33, but this complicates the fabrication by requiring the input waveguide and Si to be co-planar, and the insertion loss is wavelength-dependent due to the spectral variation of the mode field diameter mismatch between SiN and Si.\nHere, we report broadband, high-efficiency, SiN-on-Si waveguide PDs integrated within a foundry-fabricated visible spectrum PIC platform fabricated on 200-mm Si wafers. Preliminary results of the devices were reported in34. Figure 1a shows the PIC platform crosssection, which comprises two layers of SiN waveguides, a titanium nitride (TiN) heater, and metal layers on bulk Si. Components from this platform, such as the suspended thermo-optic phase-shifters, bi-layer fiber-to-chip couplers, and electro-thermally actuated micro-electro-mechanical system cantilevers, are reported elsewhere23,35\u201337. The SiN-on-Si PDs have a leaky-wave design where the optical power in the SiN input waveguide evanescently leaks into a mesa defined in bulk Si under the waveguide. The thick and wide Si mesa effectively supports a continuum of radiation modes, eliminating the coupling sensitivity to the phase-matching condition in SOI-based devices and facilitating broadband and efficient power transfer. The PD geometry is alignment tolerant. We achieved a record operating wavelength span of >230 nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) > 60% from \u03bb ~ 400\u2013640nm for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. The PDs exhibited opto-electronic (OE) bandwidths up to 9GHz and also operated as avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a gain-bandwidth product up to 173 \u00b1 30GHz. Lastly, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the integration of the PD with a tunable microring filter in a single chip for on-chip power monitoring."

Unless otherwise stated, all indicated dimensions are nominal values. For PIN junctions, the intrinsic region had a width of 2\u03bcm, centered below the SiN waveguide. The gap (Wgap) between the SiN and Si layer was designed to be 150nm. Two layers of metals and vias connected the device to bond pads. The vias andmetals were placed sufficiently apart to ensure optical isolation from the SiN\nwaveguide. The Si mesa height was 2.85\u03bcm to achieve a low propagation loss for the routing SiN waveguides (SiN1 layer in Fig. 1a). Figure 1b shows a scanning electron micrograph of the PD cross-section with the SiN waveguide atop the Si mesa in the inset, and Fig. 1c shows an optical micrograph of a device.\nFigure 1d shows the top-view schematic of a PD device with a reference waveguide structure for optical power calibration during characterization. As designed, the routing SiN waveguides had a thickness of t = 150 nm and widths (Wgw) of 500nm (for the single PD devices) and 380nm (for the microring integration). Tapered edge couplers, starting with a SiN width of 5.2\u03bcm that adiabatically narrowed to Wgw over a length of 300\u03bcm, were used for fiber-to-chip coupling. The routingwaveguides adiabatically narrowedover a length of 100 \u03bcm to Wgn (i.e., 150, 200, and 250 nm) at the Si mesa facet for light to penetrate into the Si. We have previously reported the propagation loss of the routing waveguides (~1.1\u22125.9 dB/cm from \u03bb = 430\u2013648 nm2, and ~1.8\u22127.1 dB/cm from \u03bb = 405\u2013640 nm35) and insertion loss of the edge couplers (7.5\u201311.3 dB/facet from \u03bb = 430\u2013648 nm2, and 5.9\u20138.6 dB/facet from \u03bb = 405\u2013640nm35).

The images have not been post-processed. In our design, the input facet of the Si mesa was at the middle of the chip (L/2, Fig. 1d), and the input power to the PD, Pin,PD, was thus taken as (Pin,ref + Pout,ref)/2 using a reference waveguide with the same width Wgw, where the Pin,ref and Pout,ref are the measured optical powers (in dBm) into and out of the waveguide, respectively."

The photocurrent included the absorption of the stray portion of Pin,ref that was not coupled into the waveguide, which was eliminated by fiber displacement measurements (see Methods). We measured the effective photocurrent, Ieph, due to the light coupled into thewaveguidewithout the stray light (as defined inMethods, Eq. (1)) over six orders ofmagnitude of Pin,PD (~10\u22129\u221210\u22123W) and found good linearity in the photocurrent response (Fig. 2c). The measurements of a PN device are included in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S3), and they also showed good Ieph\u2212Pin,PD linearity.\nThe EQE was calculated as Rhc=\u00f0\u03bbq\u00de, where R= Ieph=Pin,PD is the responsivity and h, c, q denote Planck\u2019s constant, the speed of light, and the elementary charge, respectively. Figure 2d shows the measured EQE at \u22122 V. The measured EQE qualitatively agrees with but is lower than the simulated results, which assume an ideal internal quantum efficiency and lossless SiN waveguides and transitions (see Supplementary Information). The EQE was >60% for a spectral span of ~135 nm (400\u2013535 nm) and >230 nm (400\u2013640nm) for the transverse electric (TE) and TM polarized mode, respectively. For \u03bb \u2273 550 nm, although the mode approached cut off at Wgn = 200nm (Supplementary Information, Fig. S5c), the EQE benefits from the absorption of scattered light (Supplementary Information, Fig. S8). The measured EQE is limited by a number of factors, such as the internal quantum efficiency, mode mismatch loss between the input SiN waveguide and the SiN-on-Si region, Wgn variations, device length, scattering and back-reflection at the Si mesa interface, and excitation of high order modes in the routing waveguide at short wavelengths (e.g., near 405 nm) (Supplementary Information). Nevertheless, Fig. S7 (Supplementary Information) shows a device length of l = 50\u03bcm is sufficient to saturate the EQE for \u03bb > 445 nm.We verified that longer devices (up to l = 500 \u03bcm) showed an increase of <30% in R (Supplementary Information, Fig. S9). Increasing l or narrowing Wgn can increase the EQE for the TE polarization at \u03bb < 450 nm (Supplementary Information, Fig. S10). Simulations show that the EQE is insensitive to the Si width, Si thickness, andWgap near our experimental value of Wgap = 190 nm (Supplementary Information, Figs. S11 and S12). Wgap\u2208 [110, 220] nm maximizes the EQE for both polarizations.\nWe extracted the PDOE bandwidth by inputting short pulses (fullwidth-at-half-maximum (FWHM) pulse width < 50 ps) at a wavelength of 405 nm into the device and measuring the output voltage in realtime (seeMethods). Figure 2e displays themeasured impulse response of a device at differentVr (the line labels are in the caption). The FWHM decrease with increasing \u2223Vr\u2223 can be attributed to the reduced carrier transit time due to an electric field in the depletion region, as well as the reduced junction capacitance due to a wider depletion width. The frequency response was obtained by applying the Fourier transform on the impulse response, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2e. The OE 3-dB bandwidth was 4.4 \u00b1 1.1 and 8.6 \u00b1 1.0 GHz at \u22122 and \u221220 V, respectively. The measured PIN junction capacitance and contact resistance (Supplementary Information, Figs. S13, 14) suggested that the measured bandwidth was limited by the carrier transit time at low bias (\u2223Vr\u2223 < 10 V), and the laser pulse width and instrumentation at high bias (\u2223Vr\u2223 > 10V) (Supplementary Information, Fig. S16)."

Avalanche multiplication was significant beyond Vr ~ \u221214 V.

The PDs reported here also have superior EQE and OE bandwidth compared to the heterogeneously integrated PDs in refs. 29 and 28. Si metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) PDs integrated on SiN waveguides as in refs. 38 and 39 have ~kHz OE bandwidths and are significantly slower than the PN and PIN devices demonstrated here. A comparison table is available in the Supplementary Information.\nIn summary, we demonstrated PDs monolithically integrated into a visible spectrum Si PIC platform. The SiN-on-Si PDs achieved broadband high-efficiency photon detection across the entire visible spectrum. Due to a leaky-wave design of a tapered SiN waveguide over a Si mesa, an EQE > 60% was achieved over a wide wavelength span from 400 to 640 nm (for TM polarized light). The PDs had a 3-dB OE bandwidth up to 9 GHz and could also be used as APDs. Compared to other waveguide-integrated visible and NIR PDs, the device has the widest operating wavelength range while exhibiting similar dark current and APD gain-bandwidth products. The monolithically integrated SiN-on-Si PDs open the path toward sophisticated NIR and visible PICs. Future work includes the integration of PD arrays with an additional well doping opposite to the substrate doping type to avoid current leakage among devices and\nthe investigation of the device operation as single-photon APDs (SPADs)."

The input and output fibers were mounted on 5-axis piezocontrolled micro-manipulators for precise alignment. A polarization controller (Thorlabs CPC900) was inserted into the input fiber path for the polarization control. Optical power was measured using a free-spacewand-style power detector (Newport 918D-ST-SL, for Pin,ref measurement) and a fiber-optic detector (Newport 818-SL-L, for Pout,ref measurement), and was then read out by a power meter (Newport 2936-R). I\u2212V characteristics were obtained using a Keysight B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (SMU) (source voltage and measure current) via two DC electrical probes (MPI MP40 micropositioner, tungsten probe tip) placed on device anode and cathode contact pads. The voltage sweep ranged from forward (+2 V) to reverse (\u221220 V) bias in steps of 0.02 V. We verified that the photocurrent from ambient light was negligible during the dark current sweeps. Each photocurrent sweep was carried out at the respective maximum photocurrents by performing careful fiber alignment with the input SiN waveguides.\nThe photocurrent also included the absorption of stray light from Pin,ref that was not coupled into the waveguide. To estimate this contribution, the fiber was horizontally displaced ~3\u03bcm from the optimal fiber-waveguide alignment to eliminate the waveguide-coupled light absorption (mode field diameter ~3\u03bcm for Nufern S405-XP). The corresponding photocurrent (Idisp) was then multiplied by a term (1\u221210\u2212\u03b7/10) to factor out the photocurrent due to the light that was coupled into the waveguide at the optimal alignment, where \u03b7 is the single-facet coupling loss of the edge coupler (in dB). Here it is assumed that the 3\u03bcm fiber displacement resulted in no change in the absorption of the uncoupled light into the PD.

As Vbr varied among devices, we used \u2223Vr\u2223/\u2223Vbr\u2223 to compare M and the 3-dB OE bandwidth of different devices. The bandwidth measurement was identical to that for Fig. 2e, except weheld Pin,ref = \u2212 13.0 \u00b1 0.5 dBm, the same as that in the avalanche gainmeasurement. AsVr approached Vbr, M substantially increased, while the 3-dB bandwidth decreased. At Vr =Vbr, M = 46 \u00b1 14 and 29 \u00b1 9, respectively, for the 50- and 100-\u03bcm long devices. Correspondingly, the 3-dB bandwidth reduced from 7.6 \u00b1 0.3 to 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 and 3.7 \u00b1 1.6 GHz. The influence of the input pulse width (estimated 3-dB OE bandwidth ~ 9 GHz) and the oscilloscope bandwidth (13GHz) on the device 3-dB bandwidth can thus be considered negligible at Vbr. Similar bandwidth reductions have been observed in other works33,42\u201345 and can be explained by an increased\navalanche build-up time at higher M. We further calculated gainbandwidth product (GBP) up to M(Vbr). At Vr = Vbr, GBP = 173 \u00b1 30 and 99 \u00b1 15 GHz, respectively, or 50- and 100-\u03bcm long devices. The values are reasonable compared to33,46, indicating good APD performance. The M, 3-dB OE bandwidth and GBP results for the 100-\u03bcm long devices can be found in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S17).\nThe avalanche breakdown voltage Vbr was determined using Eq. (3), which is equivalent to\nln 1 1 M\u00f0Vr\u00de =n ln\u00f0\u2223Vr \u2223\u00de n ln\u00f0\u2223Vbr \u2223\u00de: \u00f04\u00de\nTherefore, performing a linear fitting and extrapolation between ln 1 1M\u00f0Vr \u00de\nand ln\u00f0\u2223Vr \u2223\u00de leads to the extraction of n and n ln\u00f0\u2223Vbr \u2223\u00de, via its slope, a, and y-intercept, b, respectively. Vbr can thus be calculated using \u2223Vbr \u2223= exp\u00f0 b=a\u00de. The Supplementary Information (Fig. S18) shows an example plot of the fitting for a 50-\u03bcm long PN device, resulting in a Vbr = \u221213.1 V. Vbr of other device lengths were similarly determined using this approach.\nWavelength-tunable microring filter measurement The photonic integrated circuit comprises a SiN racetrack microring resonator (radius = 28\u03bcm, straight arm length = 12\u03bcm) with a TiN resistive heater above, and a PIN photodiode (200\u03bcm-long) coupled from the bus waveguide (at the through port) of the ring via a directional coupler. The measurement setup is similar to the DC characterization setup described above, except we used two additional electrical probes (MPIMP40) to power the heater via the other channel of the Keysight B2912A SMU. TE-polarized light at \u03bb = 514 nm from the Coherent OBIS Galaxy laser source was coupled into the bus waveguide and both the photocurrent from the PD and the transmitted optical power at the through port, Pthru, were recorded from the SMU via script control, as a function of the applied electrical power to the heater."
