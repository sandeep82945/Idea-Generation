    "abstractText": "This study analyzed the asymmetric impact of the physical infrastructure and trade openness on Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint over the period 1970\u20132019 using the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model. The study results posit that positive and negative shocks to physical infrastructure increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically in the short-run and symmetrically in the long-run. Likewise, the positive and negative shocks to trade openness increase and decrease the ecological footprint asymmetrically, both in the short and in the long run. Furthermore, urbanization also positively and significantly increases Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint in the short and long run. Moreover, a 1% increase in physical infrastructure increases the ecological footprint by 0.32%, while a 1% decrease in physical infrastructure decreases the ecological footprint by 0.33% in the long run. Similarly, a 1% increase in trade openness causes a 0.09% increase in the ecological footprint in the long term, while a 1% reduction in trade openness causes a 0.61% reduction in the ecological footprint. The results also conclude that urbanization is a major determinant of Pakistan\u2019s long-term ecological footprint. Thus, a 1% increase in urbanization causes a 1.31% increase in the ecological footprint in the long run. Finally, this study recommends that policies regarding physical infrastructure be formulated keeping in view its environmental impact. In addition, strict environmental policies should be implemented to reduce the environmental degradation effect of trade openness.",

The ecological footprint combines the two concepts to address the damage that human activity causes at the ground level and the damage from the use of all the Earth\u2019s natural resources that are not returned. Human activities endanger the environment and ecosystem, which provide food, clean water, electricity, recreation, and green space. The usage of Earth\u2019s resources by humans has exceeded bio-capacity. As a conclusion, humanity will require the regeneration capacity of 1.6 Earths to meet its ecological service needs. Development indicators has already outstripped the planet\u2019s ability to provide it, resulting in an ecological deficit in many countries. Around 80% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with a serious environmental problem. Nations must observe their ecological constraints to ensure sustainable development [1]. Human living standards and well-being have risen dramatically in recent decades because of significant economic expansion and prosperity [2]. However, this growth has degraded environmental quality because it depends mainly on human demand for water, infrastructure, energy, and food, among other things, resulting in emissions, loss of biodiversity and environmental imbalance [3\u20135]. Environmental pressure is created by human demand for water, infrastructure, energy, and food, among other things, resulting in emissions, loss of biodiversity and environmental imbalance [3\u20136]. While the contribution given to environmental protection was deemed to be the most important environmental component of bioenergy projects [7]. Alola, Bekun [8] and Qin [9] suggest that human exploitation of commodities and ecosystem services is a cause of modern concerns about environmental destruction, global warming, ecological imbalances, and economic failures.\nGlobal economic activity has exacerbated the problems of environmental deterioration and\npollution. Industrial development, growing urbanization, and modern farming practices are among the activities [10]. Increase in pollution results from productivity expansion and economic growth has a detrimental impact on environmental deterioration and climate change [11]. Because it covers built-up land, CO2 emissions, agricultural land, fisheries, pastures, and forest products [1], the ecological footprint is a more comprehensive assessment or measure than the CO2 emission which is formerly employed as an environmental proxy most of the time [12, 13]. The ecological footprint method is being used to estimate the overall human burden on natural ecosystems as a first approximation (Lin et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2018; Ghi\u0163\u0103 [14]; Ullah & Khan, 2020), but with some recognized disadvantages [15, 16]. Many factors must be considered to assess the impact that individuals have on the environment, one of which is indirect and caused by their actions. Individual impact on the environment includes developing renewable resources, dealing with urban growth and expansion, accommodating a growing population and road networks, and recycling or transporting waste, increasing the magnitude of the footprint. With the development of human activity, directly or indirectly, more emphasis has been given to the environmental consequences of population density, energy consumption, economic expansion, trade policy, and other noteworthy elements [8, 17\u201323].\nInfrastructure investment is a critical determinant of economic growth and development [24, 25]. Using various econometric methodologies and samples, several studies empirically investigated the favorable influence of infrastructure investment on output production and growth [26\u201328]. However, it has a detrimental impact on environmental sustainability [29, 30]. It is estimated that physical infrastructure, such as power plants, concrete roads, bridges, mines, oil refineries, mines and waste factories, create a considerable amount of environmental deterioration [31]. In the era of industrialization, the transport sector and investment in transport infrastructure are considered the main determinants of environmental deterioration [29, 32\u201342].\nRapid urbanization has also led to lifestyle changes and, as a result, population in cities has\nexpanded dramatically in recent decades [43\u201345]. The urbanization process is one of economic\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 2 / 22\nsource/world-development-indicators All relevant data are within the paper.\nFunding: The project was funded under the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education titled \u201cRegional Initiative of Excellence\u201d in 2019\u20132022, project number 018/RID/2018/19, the amount of funding PLN 10 788 423,16.\nCompeting interests: No competing interests exist\nand social renovation and transformation. It is the migration of people from rural areas to urban cities and metropolitan and the methodical shift from an agrarian to an industrial sector [46]. The immediate effects of urbanization include visible changes in land consumption [47], but there are also indirect and intertwined effects [48]. The world has seen tremendous urbanization in recent decades, the global urban population has grown from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion in [49]. In addition, it is expected to reach 6.4 billion over the next 30 years [46]. To support this extraordinary expansion, the new urban infrastructure requires accommodation of the urban population, thus increasing the per capita ecological footprint. While urbanization is a factor responsible for increasing environmental degradation [50]. While Increase in land use may result in the destruction of agricultural land and its systems, resulting in widespread devastation [51].\nThe degree of income determines the inflow of FDI and, in turn, commercial openness.\nHowever, the effect of trade openness and FDI on the environment is controversial. According to the \u201cpollution haven effect\u201d, As a result of insufficient environmental regulation, lowincome countries attract more FDI, resulting in increased pollution. Contrary, Dinda [52] states that FDI and trade openness can reduce pollution in low-income nations by stimulating the economy, creating jobs, increasing income levels, and facilitating knowledge transfer, a phenomenon known as \" pollution halo effect \".\nPakistan is the world\u2019s most vulnerable country to climate change, since environmental\nissues have become a top priority for Pakistan\u2019s government, as well as for other developing nations [2, 53]. In the previous 20 years, Pakistan has been one of the ten most vulnerable regions to climate change. Energy and transportation are the most polluting sectors, accounting for half of all pollution [53]. Carbon emissions are currently increasing by 6% per year and will reach 400 Mt CO2 equivalent (per year) by 2030 in Pakistan if current trends continue (World Bank, 2019), which is an alarming increase. In addition, between 1999 and 2018, Pakistan lost 0.53 percent of its GDP and sustained economic losses of roughly US$3,792.53 million as a result of 152 extreme weather events [54].\nThis study adds to the previous literature in several ways. First, most previous studies have\nanalyzed the symmetrical association between trade and the environment, using variables such as trade openness or total trade in environmental emissions and the impact of physical infrastructure on environmental degradation, although this is the first study to explore the asymmetric impact of trade openness and physical infrastructure on the ecological footprint in Pakistan. This study fills the existing gap, using non-linear ARDL. Second, a physical infrastructure index was developed using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to include the important physical infrastructure components. Finally, most previous studies have used carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as a proxy to capture environmental degradation; this study used the ecological footprint as a proxy for environmental quality. Therefore, the ecological footprint measured in global hectares (gha) is the best proxy for environmental quality compared to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions [8, 13, 17, 18, 21, 44, 55\u201363].\nIn addition, environmentalists, policymakers and government officials will benefit from the\nstudy\u2019s findings. This study provides a deeper understanding and information environmental protection. The rest of the article is briefly discussed below.

            "text": "Several studies have been undertaken in the past to investigate the symmetric influence of physical infrastructure, trade openness, and urbanization as significant environmental degradation factors. Zhi-Guo, Cheng [64] suggests that various economic sectors increase carbon emissions, and academics have highlighted which areas are most significant for institutions and governments, which need immediate attention. Accompanying the growth of industrialization and urbanization, the transportation has a significant and progressive or positive impact on global carbon emissions [53, 65]. Timilsina and Shrestha [38] investigated different determinants of emission in transport sector over the period 1980 to 2005 for selected Asian countries. It is concluded that per capita income, population and increasing trends in transport ultimately lead to increased CO2 and therefore cause environmental degradation. Similarly [66, 67], empirically investigated that growth in transport sector to increase in CO2 and environmental pollution. Baabou, Grunewald [48] investigated significant determinants of the ecological footprint in Mediterranean cities and concluded that, in addition to different factors such as an increase in food intake and manufactured commodities, other socioeconomic factors such as transport, physical infrastructure and increased disposable income and changes in cultural trends are important factors of the ecological footprint.\nHowever, Moore, Kissinger [68]; Sierra, Flores [69]; Wackernagel and Rees [61] suggest\nthat proper management in the physical infrastructure and transportation sector can benefit economic growth. They suggested that vehicle mileage taxes provide direct and indirect benefits at many scales, such as reducing pollution, improving air quality, promoting public safety and health, and reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing employment in public transportation. Due to the proximity of many different activities, urban environments also provide the potential for economies of scale. Gassner, Lederer [70] investigated the ecological footprint of public transport (a driver of physical infrastructure) in Vienna, Austria, and concluded that transport and its accessories contribute to ecological carbon emissions. Some studies have also concluded that an increase in population and increased returns on urbanization and transport lead to increased land use, carbon emissions and consumption of land resources. Therefore, these factors are the main determinants of the increase in the per capita ecological footprint [55, 56, 61, 68, 71]. As a result, not only do transportation and related infrastructure raise CO2 emissions and environmental deterioration, but they also increase land consumption. This land usage is not even evenly distributed among the various modes of transportation infrastructure, resulting in its dominance as a driver of the ecological footprint in various capacities [70]. Several studies, such as [56, 70, 72\u201377] assessed the contribution of the public transport network, partial transport infrastructure, land use for transport in the context of the carbon footprint with respect to overall life cycle emission and environmental degradation.\nConsidering the ecological footprint as the most reliable measure of the environment and\nits quality, Nathaniel [43] the impact of urbanization, trade, and economic expansion on ecological footprint of Indonesia was explored. The study finds that economic growth and urbanization significantly increase environmental degradation. Trade is a short-term determinant of ecological footprint and environmental quality, while long-term factors of ecological footprint and environmental quality are energy use urbanization, and economic growth. Nathaniel, Nwodo [45] empirically investigated the impact of urbanization and trade on the ecological footprint in CIVETS over the period 1990 to 2014. By employing the AMG technique, the study concluded that trade is a positive and significant determinant of environmental quality, while urbanization is a negative, but significant factor of environmental quality. Likewise, Kurniawan and Managi [78] investigated the impact of urbanization and trade on fossil fuel (coal) consumption from 1970 to 2015, and both variables multiply coal consumption, which has a\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 4 / 22\ndetrimental impact on environmental degradation. The study suggested a decrease in coal depletion in Indonesia to achieve environmental goals. Alola, Bekun [8] also empirically investigated that trade, fertility, and energy have all had an impact on Europe\u2019s ecological footprint between 1997 and 2014. The study concluded that trade and fertility deteriorate environmental sustainability. The study concludes that trade and fertility deteriorate environmental sustainability. Dogan, Taspinar [59] explored the key drivers and determinants of ecological footprint in MINT countries from 1971 to 2013. The study investigated that exports, increased energy consumption, and urbanization are the significant factors or drivers responsible for ecological pressure in MINT countries. Ulucak and Khan [79] found that Environmental Curve Kuznets is valid in each of the BRICS countries. The study also explored the determinants for decreasing the ecological footprint in the mentioned countries, using the empirical methods DOLS and FMOLS for the period 1992 to 2016. In the BRICS countries, urbanization was discovered to be a negative factor of the ecological footprint. On the contrary, Ahmed, Zafar [62] found urbanization as positive and significant determinant of ecological footprint in G7. Likewise, Ahmed, Asghar [80] investigated the influence of urbanization, economic growth and natural resources on China\u2019s ecological footprint and found urbanization and growth as positive determinant of ecological footprint. Baloch, Zhang [81] investigated for the period 1990 to 2016, the influence of financial development, GDP, FDI, and urbanization on the ecological footprint of 59 Belt and Road countries. All these variables were found to be positive drivers of environmental deterioration and ecological footprint in the nations studied.\nRegardless of the previous literature, the new study fills a research gap in a variety of ways. To begin with, previous empirical studies have looked at the linear or symmetric relationship between physical infrastructure and environmental degradation, whereas this is the first study to look at the asymmetric impact of physical infrastructure on environmental degradation using a more comprehensive environmental proxy, the ecological footprint. Secondly, physical infrastructure index is developed through PCA approach by including important components of physical infrastructure in Pakistan."

An index was developed for the physical infrastructure in Pakistan using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach. Although there are many techniques used to interpret large datasets, PCA is most widely used because it reduces the dimensionality of the data in a comprehensible manner and preserves most of the data information intact [82]. Second, it also accumulates data while eliminating the autocorrelation problem [83]. The infrastructure index was calculated including five physical infrastructure components. These include the length of roads measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.), rail route measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.), mobile phone subscription measured in thousands of numbers (000 Nos.), landline subscription measured in thousand numbers (000 Nos.), and the route of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.) [84]. The prime measure of trade openness is the trade intensity ratio and is referred to as export plus import divided by GDP. In addition, urbanization was measured as the urban population measured in thousand people (000 people) [85].\nThe ecological footprint (EF) measured in global hectare (gha) was taken is taken as depen-\ndent variable. As the ecological footprint covers built-up land, CO2 emissions, agricultural land, fishery regions, grazing land, and forest products, it is a more comprehensive estimate than the previously used CO2 emission as an environmental indicator [1].

Physical infrastructure is a significant determinant of environmental degradation [53] Improvement in physical infrastructure give way to an increase in economic growth, ultimately paving the way for an ecological footprint [2]. Likewise, trade openness is also considered an important factor in the deterioration of environmental quality [86, 87]. Urbanization (UR) measured as urban population per thousand people [85] was also included as an independent variable to avoid model specification errors. Moreover, urbanization is also considered a significant factor in environmental contamination, in view of the previous literature. As a result of rampant urbanization, ecological degradation is happening very quickly, causing many problems such as property insecurity, water contamination, excessive air pollution, noise, and garbage disposal issues are need to be addressed [88]. It also causes congestion in cities and large population requires more jobs and other requirements. These factors increase economic activities, including the expansion of industrial zones, heavy traffic, higher levels of various pollutions [5]. The description and sources of the data series are explained in Table 1.\nFirst, it is important to determine the stationarity of time series data to avoid spurious\nresults. According to Granger and Newbold [89] the application of standard OLS techniques to unit root data leads to spurious regression. Autoregressive of order one AR(1) model is used to investigate the stationarity condition which is given below:\nZt \u00bc \u00a3 Zt 1 \u00fe 2t \u00f01\u00de\nThe behavior of the time series of Zt depends on its previous value Zt\u22121 is an axiom of the AR (1) model. There may be three possible instances of this model below:\nIf j\u00a3j < 1; stationary series:\nIf j\u00a3j > 1; explosive series:\nIf j\u00a3j \u00bc 1; non stationary series:\nThis study applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test [90] and the Phillips Perron test [91] to verify stationarity in data from this time series. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) is a criterion for determining the best lag time. These two equations from the ADF test\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 6 / 22\nwere utilized to predict the non-stationarity problem mathematically.\nDZt \u00bc a0 \u00fe \u00a3 Zt 1 \u00fe Xn\ni\u00bc1 biDZt 1 \u00fe 2t \u00f02\u00de\nDZt \u00bc a0 \u00fe a1Z \u00fe \u00a3 Zt 1 \u00fe Xn\ni\u00bc1 biDZt 1 \u00fe 2t \u00f03\u00de\n\u03b10 denotes the term intercept while \u00a3 exhibits the trend variable co-efficient. 2t is used for the error term at time t in the selected model. For the Augmented Dickey Fuller test, null hypothesis assumes that the data are not stationary.\nThe PP test is also used to investigate the stationarity problem in the data determined by\nthe two equations below:\nDZ \u00bc a0 \u00fe \u00a3 Zt 1 \u00fe xt \u00f04\u00de\n\u03b10 is intercept symbol, \u00a3 is co-efficient of slope, \u03b21 is trend variable coefficient and \u03bet is time t residual.\nSecond, this study applied nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag (NARDL) model [92]\nto examine the asymmetric impact of physical infrastructure and trade openness on Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint. The impact of the ecological footprint (EP) on physical infrastructure (II), trade openness (TO), and urbanization (UR) is expressed using the following mathematical specification:\nEPt \u00bc a0 \u00fe a1IIt \u00fe a2TOt \u00fe a3URt \u00fe \u03b5t \u00f05\u00de\nWhere \u03b10, \u03b12, \u03b13 show the model parameters, and \u03b5t is the normally distributed residual term with mean is equal to zero and constant variance.\nThe empirical specification of this study starts from the usual symmetric ARDL model pro-\nposed by [93]. Therefore, the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is written as under:\nDlogEPt \u00bc a0 \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc1\na1iDlogEPt k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na2iDlogIIt k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na3jDlogTOt k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na4kDlogURt k\n\u00fe b1logEPt 1 \u00fe b2logIIt 1 \u00fe b3logTOt 1 \u00fe b4logURt 1 \u00fe \u03b5t \u00f06\u00de\nIn Eq (6), \u03b1i and \u03b2i show long run and short-run coefficients, respectively, while \u0394 shows the difference operator for unit root; 2t represents the residual term with mean is equal to zero and constant variance.\nFollowing [92] through the asymmetric modification in linear long-run and short-run\nempirical analysis IIt, TOt are decomposed into the partial sum of two new time series variables for each of the variables. More specifically, one determines the positive partial sum of positive changes in the physical infrastructure and trade openness which is II\u00fet TO \u00fe t and the other is II t ; TO t as the partial sum of negative fluctuations in the physical infrastructure and Trade openness. Because the negative asymmetric variable is missing, the urbanization variable cannot be turned into an asymmetric variable [94]. The specification is given below in Eq 7, 8, 9,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 7 / 22\n10.\nII\u00fet \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 II\u00fet \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 max\u00f0DII\u00fet ; 0\u00de \u00f07\u00de\nII t \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 DII t \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 min\u00f0DII t ; 0\u00de \u00f08\u00de\nTO\u00fet \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 TO\u00fet \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 max\u00f0DTO\u00fet ; 0\u00de \u00f09\u00de\nTO t \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 DTO t \u00bc Xt m\u00bc1 min\u00f0DTO t ; 0\u00de \u00f010\u00de\nEq (11) inserts the partial sum of the positive and negative fluctuations of IIt and TOt as (II\u00fet ;TO \u00fe t ), and (II t ;TO t ) to examine the short run and long run asymmetric of physical infrastructure and trade openness on ecological footprint in Pakistan is given as follows:\nDlogEPt \u00bc a0 \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc1\na1iDlogEPt k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na2kDlogII \u00fe t k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na3kDlogII t k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na4jDlogTO \u00fe t k\n\u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na5jDlogTO t k \u00fe Xm\nk\u00bc0\na6jDlogURt k \u00fe b1logII \u00fe t k \u00fe b2logII t k \u00fe b3logTO \u00fe t 1\n\u00fe b4logTO t 1 \u00fe b5logURt 1 \u00fe \u03b5t \u00f011\u00de\nEq (11) calculates the asymmetric or non-linear influence of physical infrastructure index and trade openness on Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint in the short and long run, considering the short- run and long-run partial sum of positive and negative variations of the model. Furthermore, the Wald test was utilized to establish the asymmetric short-run and long-run effects of Pakistan\u2019s physical infrastructure index and trade openness on the ecological footprint. It is important to remember that lag order selection can help to figure out the best delay period for non-linear ARDL model. To identify the most appropriate lag length, various selection measures are applied. The best lag length of the model is determined using AIC as a standard measure or criteria in this study.\nFinally, appropriate diagnostic tests are used to determine the reliability, stability, and\npredictability of NARDL coefficients of the model. The Breusch -Godfrey LM test [95, 96] was used to verify the residuals auto-correlation and serial correlation. The Jarque-Bera test and the Ramsey\u2019s RESET test (Ramsey, 1969) were used to verify the normal distribution of the residual terms and the appropriate functional form of the model. In addition, CUSUM (cumulative sum of residuals) and CUSUMQ (cumulative sum of squared residuals) tests were used to verify the stability of the non-linear ARDL parameters [97]."

            "text": "This paper explored the asymmetric impact of physical infrastructure and trade openness on Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint. First, the physical infrastructure index was developed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach. This approach is most widely used because it reduces the dimensionality of the data in a comprehensible manner and preserves most of the data information intact [82]. Furthermore, it also accumulates data while eliminating the autocorrelation problem [83]. The physical infrastructure index was computed including five physical infrastructure components. These include the road length measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.), Rail route measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.), Mobile phone subscription measured in thousands of numbers (000 Nos.), Landline subscription measured\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 8 / 22\nin thousand numbers (000 Nos), and the route of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) measured in thousand kilometers (000 Kms.) (Pakistan Economic Survey, 2020). The Results of the physical infrastructure index aggregation are given in Table 2. The first panel of the table shows the correlation between the components of the physical infrastructure index. The road length with rail route; rail route with mobile subscription, landline subscription, airline route; mobile subscription and airline route pair, have a negative correlation. Likewise, the road length with mobile subscription, landline subscription and airline route; mobile subscription with landline subscription; and landline subscription with airline route, have a negative correlation. Moreover, Table 2 shows that there are weak and strong autocorrelations between the variables, implying that the parameters would be misleading and spurious in the estimate if all five determinants of physical infrastructure were included in a single regression. In addition to causing misleading and spurious regression, the information in this example is more representative and sufficient than a single indicator would have discovered. The second penal in the table shows specific deviation by PCA components which shows that the first to the fifth component has explanatory powers ranging from 52.97% to 1.42% which shows that the first component has variations of 52.97% in the physical infrastructure index. It is concluded that, when compared to other components of the infrastructure index, the first component has the greatest explanatory power to better account for variations in physical infrastructure. It is vital to consider that the estimates shown in the fifth column are used to quantify the final physical infrastructure index depth indicator provided in the subsequent regression.\nTable 3 displays descriptive statistics of the data series. Descriptive statistics helps to understand the basic characteristics and trends of the data series. The average value of the ecological\nfootprint is 50674.6 thousand global hectares (gha) with a median 50920.5, ranging from 30101.5 to 68301.3. Likewise, the average value of physical infrastructure index, trade openness, and urban population have average values of 4.0, 0.36 and 41576.9 thousand people with a median of 4.2, 0.35 and 38709.3, respectively.\nSecond, the prerequisite for using ARDL and NARDL model is to test the stationarity of time series data [98]. The ADF [90] and PP [91] tests examine each data series for unit root. The prerequisite for using ARDL and NARDL is to test the stationarity of time series data. The ADF [90] and PP [91] tests examine the unit root of all data series in the model. It is important to note that NARDL model employs after checking whether all data series are stationary at the level or first difference or a mixture of I (0) and I (1). However, suppose that ADF and PP suggest stationarity of any of the selected data series in the 2nd difference or I (2) model, the NARDL model is not an appropriate choice for determining the symmetrical and asymmetrical impact of explanatory variables on the ecological footprint [99]. Findings of Table 4 shows that none of the selected variables is stationary at 2nd difference, which implies that the nonlinear ARDL approach is applicable for this study.\nThird, this study applied the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the ideal\nmatch non-linear ARDL model. The 20 best non-linear ARDL models are shown in Table 5. Fig 1 is the graphic presentation of the 20 best models based on the AIC criteria. The order of the best-fitted model is non-linear ARDL (3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2).\nFourth, this study applied the F-bound test to investigate the co-integration of the data\nseries. Table 6 shows the result of the F-bound test to explore the co-integration between the drivers of ecological footprint and ecological footprint. The F statistic value of 7.16 is more significant than the respective upper critical limit at the 1% significance level, increasing the presence of long-term asymmetric co-integration between the model\u2019s exogenous variables and the ecological footprint in Pakistan.\nFifth, the study examined the symmetric/ asymmetric imapct of physical infrastructure and\ntrade openness on ecological footprint using Wald test [100]. Table 7 shows the results of the symmetries test; here, the null hypothesis is that the infrastructure and trade openess in the runs are symmetric with respect to the alternative hypothesis that their imapct is asymmetric. We accept the alternative hypothesis and conclude that, both in the short run, the positive and negative partial sum of squares are significantly different from each other and support the asymmetric behavior of both infrastructure and trade openness. Furthermore, we accept the null hypothesis in the case of infrastructure and conclude that the positive and negative partial sum of squares are not significantly different from each other and support the symmetric behavior of the infrastructure in the long run. However, we accept the alternative hypothesis in the case of trade openness and conclude that the positive and negative partial sum of squares are significantly different from each other and support the asymmetric behavior of trade openness in the long run. Thus, trade openness influences the ecological footprint differently in\nTable 4.

Meanwhile, infrastructure influences the ecological footprint asymmetrically in the short term and symmetrically in the long term. The urbanization variable cannot be transformed into an asymmetric variable due to the omission of the negative asymmetric variable [94].\nSixth, this study employed the non-linear ARDL model to investigate the asymmetric influ-\nence of physical infrastructure and trade openness on the ecological footprint in Pakistan. Table 8 gives non-linear ARDL model turn out. The results suggest that the partial sum of positive changes in physical infrastructure is a positive factor or determinant or driver of the ecological footprint in Pakistan, both in the short and long term. This shows that a 1% increase in positive physical infrastructure shocks to zero and a lag value causes an increase of 0.34% and 0.04% in the ecological footprint in the short term, respectively. Interestingly, the partial sum of negative changes in physical infrastructure is also the main determinant of Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint, both in the long term and short term. A 1% reduction in the partial sum of negative physical infrastructure changes at time \u201ct\u201d causes a 0.02% reduction in the ecological footprint. The results also show that the partial sum of positive changes in trade openness is a positive determinant of Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint, both in the short and long term. The 1% increase in positive trade opening shocks in period zero and a lag period causes a 0.06% and 0.22% increase in the ecological footprint in the short term, respectively. The 1% reduction in the partial sum of negative trade openness to zero, first and second lag caused a reduction of 0.45%, 0.16% and 0.20% in ecological footprint, respectively. The results also conclude that urbanization is a significant determinant or factor of the ecological footprint in Pakistan, both in the short and long run. As the negative asymmetric variable is missig in urbanization, it cannot be turned into an asymmetric variable [94].\nA 1% increase in positive shocks of physical infrastructure index causes an long run\nincrease of 0.32% in the ecological footprint.

The results also show that the partial sum of positive changes in trade openness is a positive determinant of Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint, in the long run. The 1% increase in positive trade opening shocks causes a 0.09% increase in the ecological footprint in the long-run. The 1% reduction in the partial sum of negative trade openness caused a reduction of 0.61% in ecological footprint. The results also conclude that urbanization is a major determinant of the ecological footprint in Pakistan, in the long run. Thus, 1% increase in urbanization caused 1.31% increase in the ecological footprit in the long-run. The positive linear relationship of information and communication technology with environmental degradation is also in line with the study by Majeed [101] and Jafri, Liu [53] which is one of the important factors of the physical infrastructure of this study. Information and communication technology and roads have a linear but positive long-term correlation with the emission of CO2 [53]. Likewise, Asher, Garg [31] determined that transport factors are determinants of the ecological footprint. When natural systems are replaced by built infrastructure such as buildings and roads, they tend to increase the magnitude of the footprint. In addition, the physical infrastructure we use today, such as power plants, concrete roads, bridges, mines and factories, has been estimated to create a considerable amount of the environmental pollution that exists today. Furthermore, Umar, Ji [102] and Erdogan [103] consider the transport infrastructure in the long term as an important and significant factor in the emission of CO2. Nathaniel and Khan (2020) suggested trade as a positive determinant of the long-run ecological footprint. Likewise, Jafri et al. (2021) also confirmed the positive, long-run, but symmetrical association between trade openness and environmental degradation. In this proposed study, the emission\nTable 8.

Likewise, according to Erdogan (2020), trade openness is a significant and positive determinant of the ecological footprint. Rashid, Irum [104], Luo, Bai [105]; Nathaniel and Khan (2020), Nathaniel (2020), Ahmed, Zafar [62]; Hubacek, Guan [106] consider urbanization to be an important determinant of the ecological footprint, suggesting that an increase in urbanization also causes an increase in the ecological footprint. Rapid urbanization also increases the demand for non-natural resources such as electricity, water and space, which increases people\u2019s ecological footprint and therefore has become the biggest challenge [106]. To verify the long-term stability of the non-linear ARDL model, error correction term (ECT) is introduced as cointegrating Eq (-1), which is significant at a 1% level with a negative sign. This result explains that the non-linear ARDL model is dynamically stable in the long run. It implies that 191% more imbalance adjustment would bring long-term stability to the non-linear ARDL model.\nFinally, different diagnostic tests were applied to confirm whether the coefficients of the\nselected non-linear ARDL model are reliable, stable, and predictable or not. The results of the Breusch-Godfrey LM test [95, 96] confirmed that the specified nonlinear ARDL model is free from serial correlation problems, as the probability value of X 2 statistical is insignificant at the significance level of 5%. The results of the Ramsey\u2019s RESET test [107] verified the normal distribution of the residual terms, as the probability value of X 2 statistical is insignificant at the significance level of 5%. The results of the Jarque-Bera test [108] verified the appropriate functional form of the model, as the probability value of F-statistical is insignificant at the significance level of 5%. In addition, CUSUM (cumulative sum of residuals) [97] and CUSUMQ (cumulative sum of squared residuals) tests [97] were used to verify the stability of the non-linear ARDL model/ parameters. The straight line represents the critical threshold at the 5% significance level. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ statistic graphs fall into the critical regions. This confirms that the parameters of the nonlinear ARDL model are stable and reliable [97] (Fig 2A and 2B). Findings of diagnostic tests are given in Table 9."

Third, the order of the best fitted nonlinear ARDL is NARDL (3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2) and was determined based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Fourth, the F-bound test results explored the co-integration between the factors that determine the ecological footprint. The results of the Wald test and the nonlinear ARDL model confirmed that the infrastructure influences the ecological footprint asymmetrically in the short term and symmetrically in the long term. Furthermore, trade openness influences the ecological footprint differently in both runs and with different levels of positive and negative effects. The results also conclude that urbanization is a significant factor in Pakistan\u2019s ecological footprint, both in the short and long term. The urbanization variable cannot be transformed into an asymmetric variable due to the omission of the negative asymmetric variable. The error correction term results also concluded that the nonlinear ARDL model is dynamically stable in the long term and implies that the 191% imbalance would be adjusted in the long term. Finally, the diagnostic tests confirmed that the results of the selected nonlinear ARDL model are reliable, stable, and predictable.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 14 / 22\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262782 May 17, 2022 15 / 22\nKeeping in view findings of this study, policy implications are sevenfold; first, since physical infrastructure affects the ecological footprint, it is recommended that policies regarding physical infrastructure be formulated keeping in view its environmental impact. Second, trade liberalization puts pressure on the ecological footprint, it is recommended that, while stimulating its pace in Pakistan\u2019s economy, strict environmental policies should be implemented to reduce the environmental degradation effect of trade openness. Pakistan should also participate more in market integration with its trading partners. Furthermore, environmental sustainability is a necessary condition for globalization, efforts should be made to improve the quality of the environment. Third, the results of this study also explored that urbanization increases the ecological footprint and, consequently, deteriorates environmental quality. Rural-urban migration also occurs in Pakistan due to the low standard of living and the scarcity of necessities in rural area. As a result, people migrate from rural to urban to improve their quality of life. Therefore, it is also suggested that the government of Pakistan and other stakeholders should provide basic facilities in rural areas, which will reduce rural-urban migration and lessen environmental degradation. Moreover, to achieve sustainable cities and urban area, there needs to be a reduction in population size in Pakistan. Utilizing open spaces for the creation of sustainable cities will facilitate a rapid population reduction and will reduce the pressures from both natural and social environmental factors on the consumption of limited land and resources.\nFourth, it is suggested that the Government of Pakistan needs to adopt sustainable development strategies along with environmental goals and embrace the Ecological Footprint concept to plan how they can decrease consumption of non-natural resources, physical infrastructure and transport, protecting nature and human health. It is important to identify where the gaps are in Pakistan\u2019s environmental strategies and develop effective policies that will reduce the impact of transport and urbanization on the ecological footprint and enable sustainable economic and environmental goals. In addition, it is also recommended to introduce new economic paradigms and effective national and international institutions to achieve sustainable economic development alongside environmental sustainability.\nFifth, to lessen Pakistan\u2019s ecological impact and improve environmental quality, it is also rec-\nommended that the country focus on improving renewable energy rather than relying solely on fossil fuels [53]. Likewise, in addition to increased investment in renewable energy, capital is needed to upgrade existing fossil power plants to improve environmental quality. Likewise, the green bank is an environmental strategy that aims to increase funding for clean energy projects to improve environmental quality and reduce the environmental footprint. However, in Pakistan, government and academics are struggling to establish economic policies to invest in green industry and reduce carbon emissions [109]. Green Banking or investment banking to increase green production to decrease the environmental footprint and reduce CO2 emissions to a certain level is crucially suggested. Moreover, as public development expenditures has positive association with ecological footprint in Pakistan [13], therefore, a viable and concrete fiscal policy is recommended, especially in the sphere of infrastructure development, which can enable Pakistan to achieve the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)."

In the process, it will be learned which ecological footprint determinants are causing economic growth to decline and what steps need to be taken to reverse this trend. Therefore, the term ecological footprint describes a set of behaviors that must be changed if we want our planet to survive the next century.\nSeventh, it is important to note that this study investigates the non-linear impact of physical\ninfrastructure, including only a few determinants in the index, although there are many other determinants of physical infrastructure that may have their influence on the ecological footprint in Pakistan, such as power grids, waste grids. and sewage system. Likewise, the specific infrastructure used for trade can also impact as a trade opening factor in the ecological footprint that is not included in the study. These two are the main limitations of this study. The existing study paved the way for including the wide variety of physical infrastructure factors in the index to further pinpoint these results for a more detailed perspective."
