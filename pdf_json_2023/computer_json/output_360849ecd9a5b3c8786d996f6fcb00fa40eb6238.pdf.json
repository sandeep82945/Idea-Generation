    "abstractText": "When teachers are giving affective education, their emotional communication with students is a kind of state or process during which teachers\u2019 work pressure can be alleviated when they are cultivating students\u2019 sentiment, in the meantime, they also could attain positive mental quality and a sense of vocational happiness. Regarding the relationship between young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their Affective Education Ability (AEA), only 1\u20132 articles have discussed it from the perspective of a single ability, there isn\u2019t complete research on the AEA system of teachers. Therefore, to fill in this research blank, this paper aims to measure the coupling and coordination between the development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA, in the hopes of providing a piece of useful evidence for relevant research. The theory of emotional intelligence and positive psychology serve as the theoretical basis of this paper. In the second chapter, this paper builds a framework for young teachers\u2019 affective education and an AEA training model, and employs Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to extract the time series data features of the divided six evaluation indexes of young teachers\u2019 AEA. In the third chapter, this paper uses the Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) to measure the coupling and coordination of the development level young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, and gives the quantification process. In the fourth chapter, this paper adopts the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) to quantify the influence degree of all indexes on young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, thereby realizing the quantitative measurement of each evaluation index on the comprehensive development of the two. At last, experimental results are drawn to verify the measurement and analysis results of the coupling and coordination of the two.

            "text": "As the philosophy of education is being constantly updated with the reform progress of education system, now educationalists have paid more attention to students\u2019 values on sentiment attitudes and new social abilities [1\u20137]. Affective education can help students develop emotional habits and have a healthy mental state, which is very meaningful for cultivating students\u2019 social adaptability and interpersonal skills in the future [8\u201317]. Teachers with a higher-level of AEA could have a better emotional connection with students, and such emotional connection or communication can be defined as a state or a process during which the teachers\u2019 work pressure can be alleviated when they are cultivating students\u2019 sentiment, in the meantime, the teachers can also attain positive mental quality and a sense of vocational happiness [18\u201321].\nPost et al. [22] reviewed remote labs in higher education and empirically examined the learning benefits of such labs. Their paper aimed at the effects of the learning results of cognitions, behaviors, and affections. In general, the research findings suggest that the positive outcomes of these three kinds of learning results are that students have acquired conceptual knowledge, participated in the lab activities, and are satisfied with the learning in a remote lab environment. Despeisse [23] pointed out that gamification and experiential learning are becoming more and more popular in education since they could create an immersive environment to stimulate students to conduct deeper learning. The author targeted at serious games and game-based learning in industrial engineering, summarized the pros and cons of taking games as educational tools, and proposed ways for game developers to consider how to make game aspects in line with the learning results in the cognitive and affective domains. Abdullah et al. [24] designed a questionnaire containing items of the readiness of teachers in implementing STEM (an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) from the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects and used it to determine Malaysian teachers\u2019 willingness to implement STEM education from the said aspects. The authors gave a descriptive statistical analysis with the help of SPSS software, and their research results suggest that teachers\u2019 readiness in all three aspects studied are at a moderate level, compared with the aspects of behavior and emotion, they are better ready in the aspect of cognition. Alias et al. [25] proposed a framework for merging the affective dimension of learning into engineering education so that it could promote learning in the cognitive domain. The authors analyzed four major learning theories of behaviorism, cognitivism, socio-culturalism, and constructivism, and determined a few assumptions concerning the influence on the cognition. In the paper, self-efficacy, attitude, and locus of control have been regarded as affective domain constructs; then, based on the analysis results, they proposed a framework that combines learning methodologies in the cognitive domain with the affective dimension of learning.\nAfter reviewing relevant literatures, it\u2019s found that the research on the coordinated development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA is quite insufficient, only 1\u20132 articles have discussed it from the perspective of a single ability, there isn\u2019t complete research on the AEA system of teachers. In view of this, this paper aims to study the CCD of the development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA, hoping to provide theoretical evidence for similar studies. The theory of\niJET \u2012 Vol. 18, No. 02, 2023 215\nemotional intelligence and positive psychology are the theoretical basis of this paper. In the second chapter, this paper builds a framework for young teachers\u2019 affective education and an AEA training model, and employs ANN to extract the time series data features of the six evaluation indexes of young teachers\u2019 AEA. In the third chapter, this paper uses the CCD to measure the coupling and coordination of the development level of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA, and gives the quantification process. In the fourth chapter, this paper adopts the GRA to quantify the influence degree of all indexes on young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA, thereby realizing the quantitative measurement of each evaluation index on the comprehensive development of the two. At last, experimental results are drawn to verify the measurement and analysis results of the coupling and coordination of the two."

            "text": "According to existing literatures, until now there isn\u2019t research on the evaluation of teachers\u2019 AEA at the micro level, and the macro level studies have generally ignored teachers\u2019 control over emotions, which is not good for teachers to better carry out related teaching activities. This paper holds that the development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and the development of their AEA are mutually reinforcing, so the evaluation of young teachers\u2019 AEA changes dynamically with the change of their vocational happiness.\n216 http://www.i-jet.org\nBased on previous studies, this paper constructed a framework of the affective education of young teachers, as shown in Figure 1, according to the three-dimensional structure of intelligence, this paper divided the AEA into two dimensions of \u201coperation\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d. The \u201coperation\u201d dimension includes young teachers\u2019 emotion cognition, emotion expression, and emotion adjustment, which are realized in the classroom atmosphere of affective education and the social environment of emotional practice, and they could describe the activities of young teachers\u2019 AEA. The \u201cobject\u201d dimension includes the young teachers\u2019 own emotions generated when they are giving affective education to students, the emotions generated by students, and the teaching material emotions adopted, which correspond to the emotional needs of teachers and students during the teaching and learning process, and they could describe the related content objects of young teachers\u2019 AEA. The combination of the two dimensions \u201coperation\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d divides AEA into six dimensions. The training goals of students\u2019 emotional ability include short-term goals and long-term goals. The short-term goals include the communication experience, social emotional awareness, social skills, and positive behaviors. The long-term goals include the values, mental health, and noble morality.\nFigure 2 gives the AEA training model. With the framework of the affective education of young teachers as the basic structure, this model is used to describe the relationships between the coordinated development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and AEA and the various variables such as teacher-student relationship, classroom atmosphere creation, classroom activity implementation, cultivation process of sustainable emotions, the realization of students\u2019 emotional ability goals, and the school\u2019s cultivation goals of students\u2019 cognitions, skills, and emotions.\nDuring the coupled and coordinated development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and AEA, in order to attain the features of the dynamic changes of AEA, this paper employed the ANN to extract the time series data features of the divided six evaluation index of young teachers\u2019 AEA. Combining the merits of the conventional BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network, this paper built a combined model of the two.\nAssuming: the evaluation values of BPNN and LSTM neural network after subjected to inverse normalization are denoted as o1 and o2; to calculate the weight of the combined model, set the weight values of the BPNN and LSTM neural network as \u03b81\niJET \u2012 Vol. 18, No. 02, 2023 217\nand \u03b82, the sums of the error squares of BPNN and LSTM neural network are denoted as C1 and C2, oi represents the i-th real value; o'i represents the i-th predicted value, then the weight of the combined mode can be calculated using the following formula:\n1 1 1\n1 1\n2 1 2\n2 1\n1 1\n2 1\nC C C\nC C C , (1)\nC o oi i e\nE\n( )' 2 1\n(2)\nThe formula below gives the final evaluation result of the combined model:\nO Q o Q o 1 1 2 2 (3)"

Referring the existing CCD evaluation models, this paper calculated the CCD and the specific calculation steps are:\nSTEP 1: build two sets of evaluation indexes Ai and Bi to represent the young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, wherein n represents the number of evaluation indexes of vocational happiness, and m represents the number of evaluation indexes of the six kinds of AEA.\nSTEP 2: Standardize Ai and Bi and calculate the weight values of the evaluation indexes, the formulas below show the standardization processing of the positive and negative effects of Ai:\nA A A A Aij i ( ) / ( )min max min (4)\nAij ( ) ( )A A / A Amax i max min (5)\nAssuming: Aij are the results of the standardization processing of Ai; Amax and Amin are the maximum and minimum values of the standardization results.

            "text": "Based on the extracted evaluation index system of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, this paper holds that all the extracted evaluation indexes have certain influence on the CCD of the development of the two, and the GRA has been adopted to quantify the influence degree of all indexes on the CCD so as to measure the influence of each evaluation index on the comprehensive development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA. To make our suggestions proposed for the comprehensive development of the two more targeted, this paper referred to existing relevant studies and constructed a model for the influencing factors of CCD, the specific modelling steps are:\nSTEP 1: with the CCD of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA in different semesters as the reference sequence, a set A0 = {A0(1), A0(2), \u2026, A0(M )} is built; then with the evaluation indexes of the two as the comparative sequence, another set Ai = {Ai (1), Ai (2), \u2026, Ai (M )} is built, wherein i = 1, 2, \u2026, N, N is the total number of indexes, M represents the semester; since this paper has selected the evaluation index data of 12 semesters from 2015 to 2020, M=12.\nSTEP 2: Calculate the maximum and minimum difference between A0 and Ai, the calculation formula is:\ni io A o A o i( ) ( ) ( ) , , , , 0 1 2 3 21..., (15)\nThe specific process is: at first, calculate the absolute difference between A0 and Ai, and get the comparative sequences corresponding to the maximum value and the minimum value of the absolute difference, then, find the maximum value and the minimum value in the two comparative sequences, which are respectively represented by \u0394max and \u0394min.\nSTEP 3: Assuming: \u03c7 represents the identification coefficient, the grey relational coefficient can be calculated by the following formula:\ni l o ( ) ( )\nmin max\ni max\n(16)\nSTEP 4: Because only the evaluation index data in a same time series can be subjected to the calculation of grey relational degree, so in order to measure the grey relational degree of the comprehensive development of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, this paper calculated the average values of the evaluation index data of 12 semesters in different time series and used them to construct the evaluation index data in the same time series. The calculation formula of grey relational degree \u03d5i is:\ni i l\nm\nl m l( ) ( ) 1 1\n(17)\n220 http://www.i-jet.org\nSTEP 5: Based on above steps, the grey relational degree \u03d5i of each evaluation index of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA can be calculated. The greater the value of \u03d5i, the greater the influence of the evaluation index on the CCD of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their six kinds of AEA, based on the above principle, all evaluation indexes could be sorted."

            "text": "In this paper, the teachers\u2019 vocational happiness was evaluated from 11 aspects which were then ranked from high to low according to the size of the evaluation results, they are: the sense of achievement at work, the academic progress of students, students\u2019 respect, improvement of teaching ability, pursuit of educational career, realization of self-value, diligence and efforts of students, the joint advancement of teaching and learning, the recognition of colleagues and schools, and the sense of nobleness of the profession. From the Figure 3, it\u2019s known that, at present, the teachers\u2019 vocational happiness is not high, and the feedback from students has determined the spiritual satisfaction of teachers. Another important fact is that the teachers\u2019 pursuit of educational career, the improvement of their teaching ability and professional quality, and the internal attributes of teachers themselves are the decisive factors. Then, the above 11 aspects were merged into 7 dimensions: teacher emotion dimension, student emotion dimension, teacher ability dimension, vocation dimension, work achievement dimension, and social recognition dimension. Table 1 gives the evaluation results of young teachers\u2019 vocational happiness.\niJET \u2012 Vol. 18, No. 02, 2023 221\nTable 2 gives the evaluation results of young teachers\u2019 AEA. According to the table, the six dimensions of young teachers\u2019 AEA from high to low are: the teachers\u2019 ability to adjust their own emotions when giving affective education to students, the emotion expression ability, the emotions generated by students, the emotions generated by teachers, the teaching material emotions adopted, and the teachers\u2019 emotion cognition ability. Overall speaking, the AEA is at a medium-high level.\nTable 3 gives the correlation analysis of the various dimensions of young college teachers\u2019 vocational happiness and their AEA. The six dimensions of vocational happiness and the six dimensions of AEA show significant positive correlation (p < 0.01). Between the \u201coperation\u201d dimension and the \u201cobject\u201d dimension of young teachers\u2019 AEA, there\u2019re significant differences in the vocational happiness. Table 4 gives the results of the difference test on young teachers with different levels of AEA in terms vocational happiness and each dimension. According to the table, the \u201coperation\u201d dimension is significantly higher than the \u201cobject\u201d dimension. For five dimensions out of the six dimensions of AEA, the scores of the \u201coperation\u201d dimension are significantly higher than those of the \u201cobject\u201d dimension.\nBy evaluating the vocational happiness and AEA of 37 young teacher samples in the target college, the distribution features of the CCD of the vocational happiness and AEA of young teachers in the region could be attained. With two semesters in 2020 as nodes to perform analysis, Figure 4 shows the distribution features of CCD in terms of six dimensions of AEA. According to the figure, in the two semesters in 2020, for most dimensions, the CCD of the development level of young teachers\u2019 AEA and vocational happiness is relatively high, reaching more than 20%. The distribution features of each evaluation index in \u201coperation\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d dimensions are consistent, while the CCD of the \u201cobject\u201d dimension is significantly lower than that of the \u201coperation\u201d dimension, mainly distributed between 10% and 20%, indicating that when teachers are giving affective education to students, their own emotion cognition, emotion expression, and emotion adjustment are more important to their spiritual and professional happiness.\nTable 5 gives the analysis results of the main influencing factors of CCD. According to the table, in 2015, there\u2019re 9 evaluation index influencing factors with a CCD over 10% and in the top five, while in 2020, this number is 10, showing an increase, which indicates that the CCD of the evaluation indexes is more concentrated, and this result is close to the previous analysis result of the change trend of CCD. Besides, it could be found that the top six high-frequency evaluation index influencing factors of 2015 are the same with those of 2020, the factors that can affect the coordinated development of vocational happiness and AEA are mainly indexes with high correlation, which is reflected in both the \u201coperation\u201d dimension and the \u201cobject\u201d dimension, and the frequency is mainly distributed within the 75%\u2013100% interval.\niJET \u2012 Vol. 18, No. 02, 2023 223"
