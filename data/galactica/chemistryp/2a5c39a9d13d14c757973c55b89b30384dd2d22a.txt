Biochar could be a brilliant additive supporting the anaerobic fermentation process. However, it should be taken into account that in some cases it could also be harmful to microorganisms responsible for biogas production. The negative impact of carbon materials could be a result of an overdose of biochar, high biochar pH, increased arsenic mobility in the methane fermentation solution caused by the carbon material, and low porosity of some carbon materials for microorganisms. Moreover, when biochar is affected by an anaerobic digest solution, it could reduce the biodiversity of microorganisms. The purpose of the article is not to reject the idea of biochar additives to increase the efficiency of biogas production, but to draw attention to the properties and ways of adding these materials that could reduce biogas production. These findings have practical relevance for organizations seeking to implement such systems in industrial or local-scale biogas plants and provide valuable insights for future research. Needless to say, this study will also support the implementation of biogas technologies and waste management in implementing the idea of a circular economy, further emphasizing the significance of the research. 1. conclusions Anaerobic digestion is a complex process influenced by various factors, and the use of carbon materials, such as biochar, can have both positive and negative effects on biogas production. It is crucial to consider each case individually, accounting for potential interactions among different parameters. While many studies have shown that biochar can enhance biogas production, some instances demonstrate its adverse impact. These negative effects could be attributed to factors, like the release of heavy metals from certain types of biochar. This raises concerns, especially when dealing with organic waste from heavily polluted sources. To advance the implementation of a circular economy system, further extensive research on the potential drawbacks of biochar in anaerobic digestion is needed. In practice, maintaining pH control after adding carbon materials and optimizing the dosage of additives appears to be crucial. Future research may pinpoint which carbon materials and production conditions are unsuitable for specific substrates, offering valuable guidance for biogas plant operations. In light of this review, there is a clear demand for more research to optimize biogas production by understanding the molecular properties of carbon materials and their interactions with microorganisms. Identifying and mitigating factors that hinder biogas yields will improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion processes. This critical review underscores the significance of considering the molecular properties of carbon materials and their influence on microorganisms, paving the way for more effective biogas production.
