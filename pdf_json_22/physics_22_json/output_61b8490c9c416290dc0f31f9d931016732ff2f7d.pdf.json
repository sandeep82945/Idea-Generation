    "abstractText": "The paper aims to investigate the channel flow of second grade visco-elastic fluid generated due to an oscillating wall. The effect of heat and mass transfer has been taken into account. The phenomenon has been modelled in terms of PDEs. The constitutive equations are fractionalized by using the definition of the Caputo fractional operator with Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s Laws. The system of fractional PDEs is non-dimensionalized by using appropriate dimensionless variables. The closed-form solutions of thermal and concentration boundary layers are obtained by using the Laplace and finite FourierSine transforms, while the momentum equation is solved by a numerical approach by Zakian using PYTHON . Furthermore, the parametric influence of various embedded physical parameters on momentum, temperature, and concentration distributions is depicted through various graphs. It is observed that the fractional approach is more convenient and realistic as compared to the classical approach. It is worth noting that the increasing values of M , Sc and Re retard the boundary layer profile. For instance, this behaviour of M is significant where boundary control is necessary. That is, in the case of resonance, the physical solution may be obtained by adding the effect of MHD. The Reynolds number is useful in characterising the transport properties of a fluid or a particle travelling through a fluid. The Reynolds number is one of the main controlling parameters in all viscous flow. It determines whether the fluid flow is laminar or turbulent. The evolution of the rate of heat, mass transfer, and skin friction on the left plate with various physical parameters are presented in tables. These quantities are of high interest for engineers. Keeping in mind the effect of various parameters on these engineering quantities, they make their feasibility reports.",

The effect of heat and mass transfer has been taken into account. The phenomenon has been modelled in terms of PDEs. The constitutive equations are fractionalized by using the definition of the Caputo fractional operator with Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s Laws. The system of fractional PDEs is non-dimensionalized by using appropriate dimensionless variables. The closed-form solutions of thermal and concentration boundary layers are obtained by using the Laplace and finite FourierSine transforms, while the momentum equation is solved by a numerical approach by Zakian using PYTHON . Furthermore, the parametric influence of various embedded physical parameters on momentum, temperature, and concentration distributions is depicted through various graphs. It is observed that the fractional approach is more convenient and realistic as compared to the classical approach. It is worth noting that the increasing values of M , Sc and Re retard the boundary layer profile. For instance, this behaviour of M is significant where boundary control is necessary. That is, in the case of resonance, the physical solution may be obtained by adding the effect of MHD. The Reynolds number is useful in characterising the transport properties of a fluid or a particle travelling through a fluid. The Reynolds number is one of the main controlling parameters in all viscous flow. It determines whether the fluid flow is laminar or turbulent. The evolution of the rate of heat, mass transfer, and skin friction on the left plate with various physical parameters are presented in tables. These quantities are of high interest for engineers. Keeping in mind the effect of various parameters on these engineering quantities, they make their feasibility reports."

The non-Newtonian fluid has been classified into three main subclasses i.e.: Differential type fluids, Rate type fluids, and Integral type fluids. Visco-elastic fluid is one of the subclasses of differential type fluid9,10. Lubricants are classified as differential type fluids used for the lubrication of engine components such as bearings, gears, etc. It also reduces heat and provides a cooling effect. The Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with different geometries can be found in Refs.11\u201315.\nHristov16 developed an integral balance solution for the generalized second grade visco-elastic fluid for the first problem of Stokes. Ali et\u00a0al.17 obtained the analytical solutions for the channel flow of electrically conducting incompressible dusty fluid using the Light Hill method. They discussed applied shear stress and investigated the effects of different parameters on the velocity, like elastic and radiation parameters, Reynolds and Grashof numbers. Saqib et\u00a0al.18 used integral transform techniques to investigate fluid problems (linear problems) in an unsteady state. While non-linear Maxwell fluid flow problems were fractionalized using the Catteneo\u2013Friedrich approach. FDM (Finite difference method) and L1 schemes have been used to obtain numerical solutions. The steady and unsteady MHD second grade fluid flow was thoroughly investigated in Refs.19\u201322. They have analyzed the variation of velocity on different parameters. The investigation of blood flow in the presence of magnetic particles along with isothermal heat transfer was observed by Ali et\u00a0al.23.\nGupta and Gupta24 examined the dusty gas flow subjected to a pressure gradient with arbitrarily time variation in a closed channel. The flow geometries and constitutive equations subjected to boundary conditions are found in the literature7,19,25\u201327. Attia and Abdeen28 used the finite difference method to investigate moving dusty fluid of hydromagnetic electrically conducting non-Newtonian Oldroyed 8-constant at the Steady State through a circular pipe. Roach et\u00a0al.29, considered the viscous dusty flow and fluid flow with viscosities dependent on pressure in porous media. They obtained the solution to the constitutive equations by using the Intrinsic volume method. The Crank Nicolson method is used in Ref.30 to analyze the Brownian motion and thermophorsis on stagnation point flow of the Prandtl nanofluid model. The unsteady flow and heat transfer of magnetohydrodynamics\u00a0tangent-hyperbolic fluid flow over a stretching sheet are investigated using the traditional Legendre wavelet method31, while the governing flow model is transformed into a nonlinear set of ordinary differential equations. The effects of Soret and Dufour on stagnation point fluid flow in two dimensions with variable thermal conductivity and diffusivity are investigated using wavelets in Ref.32.\nIn the last few decades, continuous generalization and enhancement of fractional operators have been noticed due to their hereditary properties and material memory effects. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the fractional calculus33 has an involvement in the modeling of differential equations (DE\u2019s) of non-integer order. Studies reveal that these fractional differential equations can describe more accurately the dynamics of many systems. It has played a vital role in the field of science and engineering. Many real-world phenomena have numerous fractional derivative applications in dynamics, chaos, chemical reaction, visco-elasticity and diffusion18,22,34. Recently, in Ref.35, the author has used jointly Fourier and Laplace transforms for the exact solution of fractionalized governing equations by the commonly used Caputo\u2013Fabrizio time-fractional derivative of laminar unsteady couple stress fluid flow. Shao et\u00a0al.34 considered viscous fluid in a vertical channel. They obtained the closed-form solution of hydromagnetic free convection flow by using the Laplace transform coupled with the finite \u00a0Fourier-Sine transform.\nThe authors investigated the unsteady natural convection radiating flow in an open ended vertical stationary channel with non-uniform temperature. The finite difference approach combined with the Crank Nicolson method was successfully used to solve the fluid model in Ref.36. Recently, in Refs.37\u201341 the authors proposed some useful methods to investigate a family of nonlinear evolution differential equations and successfully employed them to seek their solutions. in Refs.42,43 and their cited references, the readers can find more detailed results on the fractional derivative.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nIn 1855, Adolph Fick44 proposed that the diffusive flux is proportional to the concentration gradient along the x-axis (system\u2019s direction) in a one-dimensional situation. Joseph Fourier proposed his work under the name \u201cThe Analytical Theory of Heat\u201d in 1822 on heat flow45. The vector heat transfer per unit area is proportional to the vector gradient of temperature. This proportionality is called Fourier\u2019s law of conduction46. Won and Ramkrishna47 proposed a modified form of Ref.44 in which the spatially constant D is taken inside the derivative.\nUnlike Newtonian fluids, which can be described by a single constitutive equation, non-Newtonian fluids can not be described by a single constitutive equation due to their complexity. Among the non-Newtonian fluids, second grade visco-elastic fluids have significant rules in industry. Many fluids in industry are mostly viscoelastic in nature. Furthermore, visco-elastic dusty fluids are also frequently used in industries. Similarly, classical calculus may not be able to describe the real behaviour of such fluids (visco-elastic fluids). To describe the better rheology of such fluids, fractional derivatives may be used. Keeping in mind the significance of second grade visco-elastic non-Newtonian fluids, in the present article, a generalized uniform second grade fluid flow by using Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s laws is considered. The generalized visco-elastic convection flow between two parallel plates is considered. The model is developed for the given flow regime in terms of partial differential equations. The derived model is then fractionalized in a Caputo sense using Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s laws with the effect of thermal and mass diffusion. The analytical solutions of the energy and concentration equations are obtained by using the combined application of Laplace and finite Fourier-Sine\u00a0transforms, while the solution of the momentum equation is investigated by the Zakian method. The impact of fractional and other parameters on heat, mass, and, velocity distributions are depicted in tables and graphs."

            "text": "In the present work, a visco-elastic fluid in a vertical channel has been considered. The Caputo fractional derivative is applied in order to fractionalize our model by using the Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s laws. Then the closed-form solution of the governing equations is obtained by applying the Laplace and Fourier transforms. Figure\u00a01 represents the geometrical configuration for the channel flow of the model. The obtained computational results for the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles of the governing model are given in Figs.\u00a02, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. The model parameters description is given in Nomenclature section, while the variations in skin friction, Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers due to different parameters on the left plate are shown in the Tables\u00a01, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\nIn general, the various parameters are kept fixed as given: \u03b1 = 0.2 , t = 0.2 , \u03c4 = 2.5 , M = 0.5 , K1 = 1 , K2 = 2 , Pe = 30 , Gr = 25 , Gm = 25 , \u03c9 = 0.5 , Re = 2 and Sc = 0.5 , unless particularly defined otherwise..\nThe influence of M on the velocity distribution of the fluid is shown in Fig.\u00a02. From the figure, we can observe that the velocity decreases as we increase the value of M . It shows that by increasing M , the Lorentz force increases and behaves as a drag force. It offers more resistance to fluid motion that causes a reduction in velocity of fluid.\nFigures\u00a03 and 4 illustrate the behaviour of velocity profile against Gr and Gm . As the values of Gr and Gm increase, they physically boost the buoyancy forces that are dominant over the viscous forces and significantly improve the velocity of the fluid.\nFigures\u00a05 and 6 describe the behaviour of the velocity profile against the values of Reynolds and Peclet numbers. Analyzing the plotted curves, one can observe the decreasing effect of Re and Pe variations on the velocity profile. According to the physics point of view, Re is the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The Reynolds number has applications in the characterization of the transport properties of a fluid or particle travelling through a fluid. It is one of the main controls in viscous flow, and it determines whether fluid flow has laminar, or turbulent, conditions. In this work, Re = 2 has been considered, which indicates the laminar behaviour of the flow. The increasing values of Re cause retardation in the velocity due to shear-thickening behaviour. Shear thickening occurs when a colloidal dusty fluid changes from a stable state to a flocculating condition. While Pe is the ratio of the advection and diffusion rate of a transport phenomenon. Fluid flows with momentum and mass diffusion both occurring at the same time are characterised by the Peclet number. In our case, Pe >> 1 has taken that indicates laminar behaviour and the domination of advection effect over diffusive parallel to the streamline. As a result, heat transmission from the plates is reduced.\n(64)\u03c4 = ( Re \u2202u\n\u2202y + \u03b1\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n)\ny=1\n.\n(65)\u03c4 = [ (Re + s\u03b1) \u2202u\u0304\n\u2202y\n]\ny=0 ,\n(66)\u03c4 = [ (Re + s\u03b1) \u2202u\u0304\n\u2202y\n]\ny=1\n.\nFigure\u00a01.

The dust particles are considered spherical. One can observe moderate increasing behaviour in the velocity profile by raising the numerical value of K1.\nSc is the proportion between viscous and mass diffusion rates. It is utilized to describe fluid motion and associate the thickness of hydro-dynamic and mass transfer boundary layers. It is seen from Fig.\u00a08 that enhancing the numerical value of Sc decrease the velocity of the fluid motion because of domination of the viscous forces over mass diffusion.\nFigure\u00a09 displayed the variation of velocity distribution with time. It is obvious from the figure that the velocity distribution rises by varying the time from t = 0.2 to t = 0.5.\nThe impact of fractional orders \u03b2 and Pe on temperature distribution is describes in Figs.\u00a010 and 11, respectively.\nThe memory and hereditary properties are the beauty of fractional derivatives. Unlike the classical model, it is worth noting that in this general fractional model, various integral curves are obtained as shown in Fig.\u00a02. This graph is more realistic for best fitting of the real/experimental data with one of the integral curves. The decreasing behaviour of the temperature distribution was observed by varying the values of \u03b2 from lower to higher-order at time (t = 0.2) , while the reverse impact of \u03b2 observed at time ( t = 2).\nThe effect of Pe declines the temperature distribution over time because the diffusion rate dominates. Likewise, Fig.\u00a09, similar behaviour in the concentration distribution is noticed as shown in Fig.\u00a012 for time ( t = 0.2) and time ( t = 2) respectively. Fig.\u00a013 represents the behavior of concentration distribution, as it is seen from the figure that when accelerating the values of Sc , the concentration profile decreases. It means the viscous forces either increase or the mass diffusion rate decreases.\nFigure\u00a02. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter M.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nThe numerical results of the skin friction on the left and right plates are discussed in the Tables\u00a01 and 2, respectively. The influence of different fluid parameters on skin friction and fractional parameters are presented as well. One can see the variation in skin friction from the Tables\u00a01 and 2 with other parameters. The minimum value of 2.51069 of skin friction on the left plate is noted when the value of Re varies from 2 to 5, whereas the maximum value is 7.32098, obtained by changing t from 0.2 to 0.5. On the other hand, the minimum value of 0.51371 of skin friction on the right plate is noted when the value of Re varies from 2 to 5, whereas the maximum value is 3.30318 obtained by changing t from 0.2 to 0.5.\nTables\u00a03 and 4 elucidate the variation in Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. The heat transfer was enhanced by 387.31% as we increased the value of Pe . Despite this, the heat transfer rate was reduced by 128.11% by varying the time from t = 0.2 to t = 0.5 . Table\u00a04 shows the variation in Sherwood number. From the table, one can see a 6.53% decrease in mass distribution by increasing time but increasing the value of Sc boost-up mass distribution in fluid up to 42.71%."

            "text": "This manuscript deals with the channel flow of visco-elastic fluid. The channel flow is generated by the impact of the oscillating wall and enhanced by the heat convection. From this investigation, some concluding remarks are established, which are listed below:\n\u2022 The fractional derivatives are more general and realistic than classical derivatives because they provides various solutions which may be helpful to best fit with real data. For each value of the fractional parameter \u03b2 , we have obtained distinct solutions which reflect the diversity of fractional calculus rather than classical calculus.\nFigure\u00a03. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter Gr.\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\n\u2022 Unlike the previously published results, the classical model is fractionalized by using Fick\u2019s and Fourier\u2019s Laws. \u2022 The increasing values of the physical parameters M , Re , Pe , and Sc retards, while K1 , Gr , and Gm enhance the velocity profile of visco-elastic fluid. \u2022 For variation of fractional parameter \u03b2 , the temperature and concentration profiles show opposite behaviour for small and larger time. \u2022 It is observed that skin friction increases with increasing values of each t , K1 , Gr , and Gm , while the decreasing behaviour is noticed with increasing values of each Pe , \u03b1 , \u03b2 , M , Re , and Sc . The rate of heat and mass transfer increased with the larger values of Pe and Sc , respectively.\nFigure\u00a04. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter Gm.\n14\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a05. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter Re.\n15\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a06. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter Pe.\n16\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a07. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter K1.\n17\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a08. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter Sc.\n18\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a09. \u03b2 variation on velocity distribution for parameter t.\nFigure\u00a010. \u03b2 variation on temperature distribution for parameter t.\n19\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:3448 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06153-3\nFigure\u00a011.
