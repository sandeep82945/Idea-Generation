Background: The adoption of self-care behaviors among patients with arterial hypertension (AH) plays an important role in the management of their health condition. However, a lack of scales assessing self-care is observed. We aimed to develop and validate the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale. Methods: From a pool of questions derived from a literature review, 18 items were included in the scale and reviewed by a committee of experts. Participants indicated the frequency at which they followed the self-behavior prescribed in each statement on a five-point Likert scale. Data were collected between April 2019 and December 2019. Results: A total of 202 consecutive adult patients with AH were enrolled in the study. The internal consistency of the scale was found to be 0.807, using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. An exploratory factor analysis identified two domains that accounted for 92.94% of the variance in the scale items; however, each sub-scale could not be used as an independent scale. Finally, the test–retest of the scale showed a significant strong correlation (r = 0.0095, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This analysis indicates that the scale is reliable and valid for assessing self-care behaviors in patients with AH. It is suggested that health professionals use it in their clinical practice to improve the management of AH. 1. conclusions The Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale showed satisfactory reliability, and the factor analysis indicated two factors that were of interest. We can, therefore, assert that it is a reliable and valid tool for identifying self-behaviors among patients with arterial hypertension. The score of the scale is independent of the demographic characteristics of people with AH; therefore, it could be used for any patient with AH without any limitation. Healthcare providers can use it in their clinical practice to enhance the identification of patients who do not follow and adopt the recommended self-behaviors.
