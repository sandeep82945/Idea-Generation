    "abstractText": "Ivermectin (IVM) is a drug from the group of anthelmintics used in veterinary and human medicine. Recently, interest in IVM has increased as it has been used for the treatment of some malignant diseases, as well as viral infections caused by the Zika virus, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The electrochemical behaviour of IVM was investigated using cyclic (CV), differential pulse (DPV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) at glassy carbon electrode (GCE). IVM showed independent oxidation and reduction processes. The effect of pH and scan rate indicated the irreversibility of all processes and confirmed the diffusion character of oxidation and reduction as an adsorptioncontrolled process. Mechanisms for IVM oxidation at the tetrahydrofuran ring and reduction of the 1,4-diene structure in the IVM molecule are proposed. The redox behaviour of IVM in a biological matrix (human serum pool) showed a pronounced antioxidant potential similar to that of Trolox during short incubation, whereas a prolonged stay among biomolecules and in the presence of an exogenous pro-oxidant (tert-butyl hydroperoxide, TBH) resulted in a loss of its antioxidant effect. The antioxidant potential of IVM was confirmed by voltametric methodology which is proposed for the first time.",

            "text": "At the onset of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), before any recognised effective treatment or currently approved vaccine therapy was available, an urgent need arose to re-evaluate existing medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection [1]. When IVM, a member of the avermectin family, demonstrated its antiviral potential against the virus [2], interest in IVM skyrocketed and there were numerous attempts to repurpose it for the treatment of COVID-19. IVM was first discovered in the 1970s by microbiologist Satoshi Omura and parasitologist William Campbell and is an anthelmintic drug [3]. IVM is a macrocyclic lactone derived from avermectins and is a mixture of two homologues: 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a (\u226580%) and 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b (\u226420%). It was first marketed for use in animals in 1981, but is also used to treat various diseases in humans, such as onchocerciasis [4]. Ivermectin is considered the drug of choice for various parasitic diseases [1]. IVM has been reported to be used in the treatment of some malignant diseases, as well as viral infections caused by the Zika and HIV-1 viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 virus [5]. Since the spike in interest, a number of electrochemical methods for the detection of IVM have been reported, such as the use of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode cathodically pretreated with 0.5 mol L\u22121 H2SO4 for detection in pharmaceutical formulations and urine [6]; GCE modified with silver nanoparticles at modified boron and sulphur co-doped\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2113. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052113 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2113 2 of 17\nreduced graphene oxide nanohybrid (AgNPs B, S@rGO) for detection in injections, urine and tap water [7]; glutaraldehyde-modified GCE for detection in tap water and urine [8]; and \u03b2-cyclodextrin/graphene-based electrode for detection in tap water [9]. The BDD electrode provides a sensitive, simple, inexpensive and rapid amperometric flow injection method with results that show good agreement with comparable methods. However, the potentiostatic electrolyses resulted in fouling of the BDD electrode surface, which made it impossible to estimate the number of electrons involved in the process and to propose an oxidation mechanism of the IVM [6]. The modified electrode showed significantly increased sensitivity in IVM determination due to the synergistic effects of AgNPs and B, S@rGO. The proposed sensor exhibited good selectivity, reproducibility and long-term stability [7]. The glutardialdehyde-modified glassy carbon electrode showed high sensitivity, selectivity and stability [8], while the \u03b2-cyclodextrin/graphene-based electrode resulted in excellent analytical performance for the electrochemical detection of IVM [9]. None of the methods have characterised the electrochemical behaviour of IVM, none have been performed on a non-modified GCE and none of the methods for detecting IVM have been performed in human serum as biological material in which the distribution of IVM should be expected. Electrochemical characterisation of IVM was performed with the aim of better understanding the redox behaviour of the molecule, as well as predicting possible oxidation/reduction mechanisms and potential transformations during interaction with other electroactive biomolecules. Electrochemical methods are inexpensive, fast and easy to perform, making them ideal candidates for drug analysis. Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance in cellular antioxidant capacity and cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to damage in important cellular components such as DNA, proteins and lipids. The effects of oxidative stress are observed in a number of diseases, as well as in a variety of drug-induced toxicities [10]. Antioxidant activity is traditionally studied by well-known spectrophotometric methods, but they have some disadvantages. Very often, these methods require a lengthy and demanding pretreatment; especially for biological samples, the results may be affected by the turbidity of the sample. Therefore, the electrochemical approach could be very important as an independent and comparative method in the measurement of antioxidants and antioxidant activity due to its fast and simple methodology and the good stability of the electrochemical signal, which is not affected by turbid or opaque samples. Most studies using electrochemical approach in the measurement of antioxidant activity are used for the determination of polyphenolic compounds. Among them, the concept of electrochemical index (EI), defined as the total polyphenolic content obtained by nonselective oxidation of all polyphenols [11,12], is very promising because it uses the peak anodic potential and current to estimate the ease with which the compound is oxidized. In our study on IVM, a different approach was used\u2014we employed DPV and used voltametric peak parameters to estimate the antioxidant properties of IVM in human serum samples. According to the order of occurrence of oxidation peaks, the following rule applies: the lower the oxidation potentials, the greater the ability of the compound to act as an electron donor, which is associated with higher antioxidant activity and antioxidant capacity. The aim of this study is to investigate the redox activity of IVM in human serum pool of healthy individuals in order to compare it with a known antioxidant, Trolox (a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E), and to predict its pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity in vitro, as well as to propose which part of the chemical structure is responsible for the effect. A new electrochemical method to confirm the results of the oxidative stress testing is also proposed."

All investigated substances can be oxidised at the GCE and give oxidation peaks at different potentials: Trolox at Ep = 0.08 V, serum at Ep = 0.40 V, IVM at Ep = 0.85 V and TBH at Ep = 1.255 V (Figure 9a). Consid ring the increasing values of the oxidation potential of these compounds, it can be assumed that Trolox is the easiest\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2113 12 of 17\nand TBH the most difficult to oxidise, which is consistent with the fact that Trolox has a higher antioxidant effect than TBH and is a well-known antioxidant.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 17\nFigure 9.

A stock solution of IVM (2 mmol L\u22121) for electrochemical characterisation was prepared in methanol. Stock solutions of IVM (0.25 mmol L\u22121) for the biochemical assays were prepared by dissolving IVM in DMSO or PEG/Gly mixture in a 6:1 ratio. Solutions of different concentrations for electrochemical characterisation were obtained by diluting the stock solution with different supporting electrolytes prepared with chemicals of analytical-grade quality. The following supporting electrolytes were used: citric acid/sodium hydroxide buffer (pH 2.20, 3.06), acetate buffer (pH 3.58, 4.63, 5.05, 5.64), phosphate buffer (pH 6.20, 6.96, 7.93) and ammonia/ammonium chloride buffer (pH 8.51, 9.50) [17]. The ionic strength of all solutions was adjusted to 0.1 mol L\u22121. All experiments were performed at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1 \u25e6C). The serum pool was prepared from serum samples of healthy individuals and kindly donated by the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade after daily work in the biochemical laboratory, which would otherwise be destroyed as biological waste. Aliquots of the serum pool were frozen at \u221280 \u25e6C and analysed within 5 days of collection. Biochemical analysis: All samples were incubated in duplicate for 2 and 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. Serum pool samples (450 \u00b5L) were mixed in 1:10 ratio with different solutions (50 \u00b5L) as follows: Trolox (2 mmol L\u22121), TBH (0.25 mmol L\u22121) and dilutions of IVM stock solution (0.25\u20130.015625 mmol L\u22121). The IVM samples were mixed in equal parts with TBH to test its reactivity in the presence of exogenous pro-oxidants (exactly 25 \u00b5L were added to the serum pool samples).

            "text": "Electrochemical characterisation was performed by CV, DPV and SWV. The effect of pH was studied in the pH range of 2\u201310. The GCE was manually polished with an aqueous slurry of Al2O3 powder (particle size 0.05 \u00b5m) on a smooth polishing pad for 2 min before each experiment. The electrode was rinsed with deionised water and then sonicated in deionised water for 2 min and in absolute ethanol for 2 min and then rinsed with deionised water. The test solutions were deoxygenated by bubbling with high-purity nitrogen before and in-between runs to remove oxygen interference. CV was first performed in the direction of the positive potential\u2014starting at 0 V, increasing to +1.6 V, and decreasing again to \u22121.6 V\u2014and in the opposite direction towards negative potential\u2014starting at 0 V, decreasing to \u22121.6 V and increasing to +1.6 V. The scan rate was adjustable and ranged from 0.01 V s\u22121 to 0.1 V s\u22121, with a step potential of 0.005 V. DPV was used under the following conditions: step potential 0.005 V, modulation amplitude 0.05 V, modulation time 0.05 s and interval time 1 s. The conditions for SWV were frequency 25 Hz, step potential 0.001 V, effective scan rate of 0.025 V s\u22121 and pulse amplitude of 0.005 V. The DP and SW voltammograms shown were baseline-corrected by applying the moving average with a step window of 0.005 V. The corrected voltammograms were used only for better visualisation and graphical representation of peaks. All peak current values used and shown in all graphs were obtained from the original, untreated voltammograms. PAB was measured according to a previously published method [18,19]. 3,3\u2032-5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) reacts with both hydrogen peroxide and the antioxidants present in the sample. The reaction of chromogen and H2O2 is enzymatically catalysed by peroxidase, whereas the reaction of chromogen and antioxidants is not. Different proportions (0\u2013100%) of 1 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 were mixed with 6 mmol L\u22121 uric acid to obtain the standard solutions. The results are expressed in arbitrary units corresponding to the percentage of H2O2 in the standard solution. TOS was determined according to the Erel\u2019s method [20], which was optimised for our laboratory [18]. The ferrous ion-odianisidine complex is oxidised to ferric ion in presence of oxidants. The concentration of oxidant molecules is proportional to the colour intensity of the sample. TOS values are given as \u00b5mol H2O2 equivalent L\u22121, since the method was calibrated with 10\u2013200 \u00b5mol hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution. SHG were measured using the optimised Ellman\u2019s method [18,21]. The reaction between the reagent dinitrodithiobenzoic acid (DTNB, conc. 10 mmol L\u22121) and aliphatic thiol compounds in a basic environment (pH 9.0) provides 1 mol of p-nitrophenol anion per 1 mol of thiol. Method calibration was performed with reduced glutathione (conc. 0.1\u20131.0 mmol L\u22121). TAS was determined by Erel\u2019s method [22] modified for our laboratory [18]. Reduced 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) oxidises in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in acidic medium. Antioxidants present in the sample lead to ABTS discoloration proportional to their concentrations. The reaction was calibrated with 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) and the results are expressed as \u00b5mol Trolox equivalent L\u22121. The oxidative score was calculated as the difference between the pro-oxidant score (TOS and PAB, i.e., average of Z-scores of all measured pro-oxidants and their products) and the antioxidant score (TAS and SHG, i.e., average of Z-scores of all measured antioxidants and their products). The difference between the original value and the control value divided by the standard deviation of the control values (or population means and standard deviations) gives the Z-score. The OS value is directly proportional to the pro-oxidant effect [23,24]. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18.0 (SPSS inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as medians \u00b1 interquartile range. The Friedmann\u2019s test (nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA) followed by Wilcoxon\u2019s paired-samples (post hoc test for related samples) and Mann\u2013Whitney U test were used to test the difference between quantitative variables. A significant difference was considered at p < 0.05 for each statistical test performed.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2113 15 of 17\nElectrochemical confirmation of the spectrophotometric analysis was performed by DPV in a small electrochemical cell (1.5 mL) using the same three-electrode system. The GCE was prepared in the same manner as described previously. Samples were tested without deoxygenation before and between runs. Voltammograms were recorded after 0 h, 2 h and 24 h incubation at 37 \u25e6C. DPV was used under the following conditions: step potential 0.005 V, modulation amplitude 0.05 V, modulation time 0.05 s and interval time 1 s. All values determined and presented were obtained from the original voltammograms. Baseline-corrected voltammograms (same procedure as described above) were used for display and visualisation only."

            "text": "Electrochemical characterisation of IVM, a ratified anthelmintic but also a potential antitumor and antiviral drug, was performed using CV, DPV and SWV. IVM can be oxidised and reduced at GCE separately. Both the potential and intensity of the oxidation (A1 and A2) and reduction (C1) peaks are pH dependent. The influence of pH was studied in different buffer solutions in the pH range 2\u201310. The oxidation process, represented by the A1 peak, takes place as an irreversible, diffusion-controlled process involving the exchange of one electron and one proton in slightly acidic and neutral solutions. The oxidation of IVM occurs at position 8A in the tetrahydrofuran ring, forming an intermediate radical (8-ivermectin radical) that further transitions to 8-OH IVM as the major product. The reduction of IVM is an irreversible, adsorption-controlled process that occurs at the 1,4-diene structure. Upon protonation, a resonance-stabilised carbocation is formed, which, after the consumption of an electron, forms the reduced IVM-R product. The antioxidant activity of IVM was studied in vitro in a human serum pool and compared with a known antioxidant (Trolox) and pro-oxidant (TBH). PAB, TOS, TAS and SHG were determined spectrophotometrically and used to calculate pro-oxidant, antioxidant and oxy-scores of IVM after 2 h and 24 h of incubation. The redox behaviour of IVM showed pronounced antioxidant potential, similar to that of Trolox at short-term incubation, whereas a prolonged stay among biomolecules, e.g., in the presence of an exogenous pro-oxidant (TBH), resulted in a loss of antioxidant activity. DPV measurements performed in an oxygenated human serum sample enriched with IVM, Trolox and TBH after incubation for up to 24 h at 37 \u25e6C revealed that IVM exhibited redox properties similar to Trolox and confirmed the results obtained by spectrophotometric measurements. The electrochemical characterisation of IVM was performed with the aim of better understanding the redox behaviour of the molecule itself and predicting possible transformations during interactions with biomolecules in the biological matrix. The presented results are not only of fundamental importance, but also promote the use of electrochemical methods in addition to the known and accepted methods for the analysis of the antioxidant properties of drugs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, B.I.; methodology, M.M.A. and J.K.-S.; software, M.M.A. and J.K.-S.; validation, J.R.; formal analysis, M.S. and J.R.; investigation, M.S. and J.R.; resources, M.M.A., J.K.-S. and B.I.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.M.A., J.K.-S., J.R. and B.I.; visualisation, B.I.; supervision, M.M.A., J.K.-S. and B.I.
