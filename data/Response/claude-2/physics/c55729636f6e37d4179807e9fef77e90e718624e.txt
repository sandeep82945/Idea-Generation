 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore other surrogate metrics besides total energy to guide the fusion of multiple pre-training tasks. The total energy works well in this paper, but other physics-inspired metrics could also be promising.

2. Investigate different architectures besides Graph Transformer as the backbone model for pre-training and fine-tuning. The choice of backbone model likely impacts the effectiveness of pre-training.

3. Design new pre-training tasks, beyond bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle prediction, that can encode useful 3D geometric information. There may be other aspects of 3D structure that could further improve performance. 

4. Study how to effectively incorporate multiple conformers during pre-training. The paper shows some benefit to using multiple conformers, but there is likely room for improvement in how they are leveraged.

5. Apply the pre-training framework to other molecular property prediction tasks beyond what was studied in the paper. Further demonstrate the generalization ability to new datasets and evaluation metrics.
