When the general renormalization group argument, e.g. [1], might appear to suppress such an unusual bilateral critical behavior, they have been reported to occur in various systems, such as the isotropic ferromagnet [2], XY-Heisenberg model [3], complex Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev models [4], and liquid\u2013gas transitions of real molecules [5]. To explain the two-sided critical phase transitions while respecting the analyticity of the canonical partition function of a finite system, it was hypothesized that there may exist not a single but double critical points, which should be quite close to each other [5].\nIt is the dual purpose of the present article to modify the van der Waals equation toward the description of the two-sided phase transitions and to test our novel formulas against the NIST reference data (RRID:SCR_006452) [6], specifically for 11 real molecules. Our proposed equation of state, which we dub Janus van der Waals equations,1 is characterized by extremely adjacent two critical points.

In (1) and (2), and henceforth, Pr = P/Pc, Tr = T/Tc, and vr = v/vc are the reduced pressure, temperature, and volume per particle, respectively, while \u03c7 = kBTc/(Pcvc) denotes the inverse of the critical compressibility factor which is dimensionless. The critical point is given by Pr = Tr = vr = 1, such that the van der Waals Eq. 1 contains the critical point as (1 + 3)(1 \u2212 13) 83 and may describe the near critical behavior. However, in a large volume or low-density limit, Eq. 1 gives\nPv \u2243 8Pcvc 3Tc ( )T \u2260 kBT. (3) Thus, unless \u03c7 83 by chance, the van der Waals Eq. 1 cannot be reduced to the classical ideal gas law (2) in the low-density limit and accordingly fails to describe real gases at low densities. In fact, the experimental real values of \u03c7 are typically around 3.5 larger than 83. In contrast, our proposed Janus van der Waals equations are going to be consistent with the classical ideal gas law (2) at low densities. They are not particularly motivated by the finite volume or intermolecular effects. Instead, we addressed directly the definition of the critical point in thermodynamics: for a given equation of state, a critical point can be identified as a stationary inflection point in the constant temperature line on a pressure versus volume diagram. Specifically for a certain natural number greater than or equal to two, nc \u2265 2, we have at the critical point,\nzkP Tc, vc( ) zvk 0 for 1\u2264 k\u2264 nc, (4)\nwhile the next higher-order derivative having k = nc + 1 is nontrivial. In particular for van der Waals Eq. 1, the number takes the minimal value nc = 2, and its spinodal curve, that is, by definition the lowest order k = 1 in (4), is given by\nTr 1 \u2212 vr \u2212 1( ) 2 4vr \u2212 1( ) 4v3r . (5)\nThis expression shows clearly that on the spinodal curve, the temperature is locally maximal at the critical point. In general, the characteristic number nc can differ from two and may be used to classify the critical points, being dubbed as \u2018critical index\u2019 [5].\nThoroughly from (4), both the critical isobar of Pr \u2261 1, and the spinodal curve satisfies simple power-law behaviors around the critical point:\nT \u2212 Tc \u221d v \u2212 vc( )1+nc : critical isobar, T \u2212 Tc \u221d v \u2212 vc( )nc : spinodal curve. (6)\nCombined with the analyticity of the underlying canonical partition function, this result fixes the (isobaric) critical exponents [8], \u03b1P \u03b3P nc1+nc and \u03b2P \u03b4\u22121 11+nc. These satisfy Rushbrooke and Widom scaling laws. Since nc \u2265 2, the two curves of (6) are actually tangent to each other at the critical point.\nThe main result of [5] was that the NIST reference data on 20 major molecules [6] are indeed consistent with the analytic prediction of the critical exponents and, moreover, that the critical phase transitions are remarkably two-sided: for T > Tc the critical index is 2 universally, yet for T < Tc it varies as n \u2261 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 depending on eachmolecule, collectively denoted by a pair of critical indices, nc 0 (n+, n\u2212) = (2, n). In this work, we present Janus van der Waals equations characterized by a pair of adjacent critical points with indices (n+, n\u2212) = (2, n) for n = 2, 4, 6 (even). With one continuous input parameter, which will be chosen to match the critical compressibility, they are shown to describe all the real molecules remarkably well with even critical indices identified in [5]. They are cyclopentane (C5H10) for n = 2; nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propylene (C3H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), and isobutane (C4H10) for n = 4; and helium-4 (4He) for n = 6."

For this, it is necessary to set 0 < a < 1 and s2 \u2260 4t. We also put n to be even, n = 0, 2, 4, 6, /, such that the critical temperature is (locally) maximal on the spinodal curve, which is the case with the van der Waals fluid (5), a relativistic ideal Bose gas [8] (Figures 2, 6 therein), and supposedly real molecules. Accordingly, the spinodal curve (8) has \u201ctwin peaks\u201d in temperature, as depicted in Figure 1. Moreover, in order to be consistent with the realistic molecules for which only one critical point has been usually assumed, we shall let a be close to 1\u2212, and then, from \u03f5\u221d (1 \u2212 a)n+3, which we shall derive later in (17), the two critical pressure values, Pr = 1 and Pr = 1 + \u03f5, will be practically indistinguishable from each other.\nFrom the fact that the last expression in (8) should be\ndivisible by (vr \u2212 b)2, two constraints arise:\nb \u2212 1( )2 b \u2212 a( )n b2 \u2212 sb + t( ) bn+4; 2\nb \u2212 1 + n b \u2212 a + 2b \u2212 s b2 \u2212 sb + t n + 4 b , (11)\nwhich subsequently determine s and t in terms of a and b,\ns 2b + n + 2( )ab \u2212 n + 4( )a + 4b \u2212 2b 2 b \u2212 1( )3 b \u2212 a( )n+1( )bn+3; t b2 + n + 1( )ab \u2212 n + 3( )a + 3b \u2212 b 2\nb \u2212 1( )3 b \u2212 a( )n+1( )bn+4.

(14)\nFIGURE 1 Schematic zoomed-in diagram of a spinodal curve (black colored) and three isobar curves (blue colored). There are two adjacent critical points on a spinodal curve at vr = a and at vr = 1. When Pr < 1, the isobar crosses the spinodal curve twice at vr < a and at vr > 1. When Pr > 1, the isobar does not meet the spinodal curve. When Pr = 1, with negligible \u03f5, the critical isobar touches the spinodal curve at the two critical points. Specifically, along the critical isobar, as the temperature increases from Tr < 1 to Tr = 1\u2212, the critical point at vr = awith the critical index of nc = n = 2, 4, 6 is relevant. On the other hand, as the temperature decreases from Tr > 1 to Tr = 1+, the dominant critical point is at vr = 1 with nc = 2. Between the two peaks on the spinodal curve, there is a local minimumwhichmay be also identified as a \u201ccritical point\u201d of which the critical temperature is less than Tc. This third critical point is sandwiched by the two extremely adjacent critical points and plays an inconsiderable role in our analysis. The diagram generalizes the single-peaked spinodal curve of a relativistic ideal Bose gas, depicted in Figure 1 of Ref. [8], to twin-peaks, and furthermore will be confirmed through a concrete example as in Figure 2.\nFIGURE 2 Diagram featuring the spinodal curve (red colored) and the critical isobar (blue colored) of the n = 4 Janus van der Waals equation with the two adjacent critical points at vr = a = 0.99 and vr= 1.00.

By construction, the Janus van der Waals equations reflect the previously reported two-sided critical phenomena [5] and at the same time reduce consistently to the classical ideal gas law in the low-density limit far away from the critical point at vr = 1.\nFirst, we focused on the n = 2 case to which only the\ncyclopentane molecule (C5H10) belongs to.\nFigure 3 shows the isochoric curves of the cyclopentane molecule at 1/vr = 0.02 (A), 1/vr = 0.5 (B), 1/vr = 1.0 (C), and 1/vr = 1.5 (D), respectively.

The red line shows the spinodal curve (8), i.e., zvP (T, v) = 0, of the Janus van der Waals equation with the choice of a = 0.99.\nNow, we turn to the case of n = 4 where the following nine molecules belong to: nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propylene (C3H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), and isobutane (C4H10).

They are drawn by the NIST data and further by the four equations: the Janus van der Waals equation for n = 4 (25), the original van der Waals Eq. 1, and the classical ideal gas law (2). The Janus van der Waals equation fits best with the NIST data, especially at the region of Tr > 1 better than the original van derWaals equation. Again, we confirmed that the n = 4 Janus van der Waals equation reduces to the classical ideal gas law in the low-density limit.\nFigure 8 shows the isobaric curves of nitrogen (N2) at Pr = 1.5 (A), Pr = 1.0 (B), and Pr = 0.5 (C), respectively.

            "text": "Our Janus van der Waals equations may appear somewhat similar to the other known equations of state, such as an earlier modified van der Waals equation (9) or the virial equation of state [10], a typical example of series expansion. Irrespective of the similarity of appearance to other equations, Janus van der Waals equations differ significantly from others as the starting point is directly from statistical physics itself at the quantum level: in other words, the partition function of any finite system should be analytic. Alternative to the conventional thermodynamic limit [11, 12], if we persistently take the analyticity of a partition function for granted [8, 13\u201317], it becomes the spinodal curve itself that draws the liquid\u2013gas phase diagram where a critical point is identified as the extremum of the spinodal curve, see [8] and Figure 6 therein.\nFIGURE 10 Three-dimensional Pr \u2212 vr \u2212 Tr phase diagram of the exact n = 4 Janus van derWaals Eq. 7, as for nitrogen (N2). The bold purple line corresponds to the isotherm of Tr= 1.00, as depicted in Figure 9B; the red line is the Janus van derWaals spinodal curve with a =0.99; and the red dot is the critical point.\nFIGURE 11 Comparison of the NIST co-existence curve data on cyclopentane (C5H10) (blue colored) with the Janus van der Waals spinodal curve (red colored, a = 0.99) and with the original van der Waals spinodal curve (dotted black line). It is a conjecture of Ref. [8] that the liquid\u2013gas co-existence curve should actually coincide with the spinodal curve. Improving our proposed Janus van der Waals equations further, this may be realizable.\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org11\nOne surprising result of the previous work by two of us [5] was the possibility of having more than one critical point which should be very close to each other. The uncertainty in the measurement of the temperature is typically the order of magnitude smaller than that of the density [18], for example, around the critical point of nitrogen (N2), we have the temperature uncertainty \u0394Tr \u2272 0.0079%, which is 16 times smaller than that of the density \u0394(1/vr) \u2272 0.13% [6, 19]. This has motivated us to conceive the ansatz (8) which modifies the original van der Waals equation and realizes the idea of multi-critical points in a simple manner, where the two distinct critical points assume the same temperature.3 We have restricted to even critical indices, nc = n = 2, 4, 6 for T < Tc and nc = 2 for T > Tc, or following the notation of [5], (n+, n\u2212) = (2, n). Our proposed van der Waals equations then naturally explain the two-sided phase transitions reported in [5] and provided the overall effective descriptions of real molecules, in particular better than the original van der Waals equation and the classical ideal gas law.\nIn Figure 11, we have compared the NIST co-existence curve data on the cyclopentane molecule (C5H10) with the Janus van der Waals spinodal curve (8) of n = 2, a = 0.99 and also with the original van der Waals spinodal curve (5). The Janus van der Waals spinodal curve fits well the NIST co-existence curve data in a wider range near the critical point, although not perfect. Further modifications of the present Janus van der Waals equations to match the spinodal curves with the co-existence curves of real molecules will lead to more realistic and improved equations of state. Such modifications may require more than the two critical points, generalizing the ansatz (8):\nTr \u2212 vr \u2212 b( )2df n vr( )dvr 1 \u2212\u220f N\ni 1\nvr \u2212 ai( )ni vr . (28)\nHere, nis are natural numbers, and particularly, those ais with ni \u2265 2 (even as well as odd) correspond to multi-critical points. The largest value of such ais should be exactly in unity with the critical index 2 as the NIST data suggest [5], while the smallest one should be still close to unity. Furthermore, the former should be a local maximum of Tr, while the latter should be either a local maximum as in Figure 1 if the critical index is even or an inflection point if it is odd. We leave the construction of this kind of multicritical Janus van der Waals equations for future work.\nThe three Janus van der Waals Eqs 23, 25, and 27 have been obtained after taking the limit a\u2192 1\u2212. Thus, the formulas should not be used to see the two-sided critical phase transitions for which the exact formula (7) with (13) must be taken and zoomed in sufficiently. When zoomed out, or moderately away from the two critical points, the two powers, (vr \u2212 a)n and (vr \u2212 1)2 in (8)\nmay appear converging to (vr \u2212 1)n+2 and mimic an enhanced critical index nc = n + 2. This implies the critical exponents \u03b1P \u03b3P n+2n+3 and \u03b2P \u03b4\u22121 1n+3 and also explains the \u2018flatness\u2019 of the top of the spinodal curve in Figure 11. The three formulas (23), 25, and 27 are for such effective descriptions. The NIST data analyses of [5], in particular Figures 2\u20134 therein, seem to agree with this enhancement moderately away from the critical points.\nHaving Janus van der Waals equations completely\ndetermined, it is worthwhile to recall\nPr \u03c7Trz lnZ Tr, vr( ) zvr , (29)\nand to obtain the underlying partition function (per particle),\nlnZ ln vr \u2212 b( )T3/2r[ ] +\u2211n+1 l 0 cl b/vr( )n+2\u2212l, n + 3 \u2212 l( ) n + 2 \u2212 l( )b4Tr, (30)\nwhere the constant of integration 32 lnTr has been added to ensure the isochoric specific heat cv 32kB at high temperature. Given the good agreement of the Janus van der Waals equation and the NIST reference data, which we report in this work, we call for further investigation of the multi-critical points and the analyticity of partition functions questioning the (rather dogmatic) thermodynamic limit."
