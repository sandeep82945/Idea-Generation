"3. Further detailed study of the process of nanotube growth on the described composite material is of interest. It is possible that the process of nanotube growth in this case will proceed along routes different from the growth of nanotubes by the mechanism of carbon diffusion [103]. The partial carbon encapsulation of nickel particles in the composite material provides evidence for this assumption. It is possible that surface carbon may serve as a precursor for the nucleation of a carbon nanotube, the growth of which may occur by incorporating carbon fragments specifically on this catalytic surface."
