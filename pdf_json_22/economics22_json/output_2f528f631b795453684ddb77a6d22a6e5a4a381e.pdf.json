    "abstractText": "Introduction: Out-of-pocket (OOP) is among the payment methods in Iran\u2019s health system. The present study aimed to examine the OOP treatment costs for patients with COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: A descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021. In this study, the cost records of 550 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a referral center of COVID-19 were selected using the stratified random sampling method. The required data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient in SPSS software version 23 at p = 0.05. Results: The total direct costs were 1,037,992.15 US $. Moreover, the shares of patients (OOP), basic insurance, government subsidy, supplementary insurance, discounts, and out-of-government subsidy in the total direct costs were US $ 92,231.21, 746,932.99 US $, 155,127.08 US $, 39,690.25 US $ and 4010.61 US $, respectively. In addition, the results confirmed that there was a positive and significant relationship between the patients\u2019 OOP payments and the length of stay. It also found that the patients\u2019 OOP payments are subject to the type of insurance program and discharge method. Conclusion: According to the results, 8.89% of the total direct costs were directly paid out of the patients\u2019 pockets. The research findings confirm the urgent need to make decisions and implement effective interventions for COVID-19 disease by controlling risk factors and exploiting other countries\u2019 successful experiences and international organizations\u2019 recommendations to decrease the prevalence of the infected and consequently reduce the financial pressure of the disease on patients by approving the expansion of the insurance organizations\u2019 role.",

In this study, the cost records of 550 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a referral center of COVID-19 were selected using the stratified random sampling method. The required data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient in SPSS software version 23 at p = 0.05. Results: The total direct costs were 1,037,992.15 US $. Moreover, the shares of patients (OOP), basic insurance, government subsidy, supplementary insurance, discounts, and out-of-government subsidy in the total direct costs were US $ 92,231.21, 746,932.99 US $, 155,127.08 US $, 39,690.25 US $ and 4010.61 US $, respectively. In addition, the results confirmed that there was a positive and significant relationship between the patients\u2019 OOP payments and the length of stay. It also found that the patients\u2019 OOP payments are subject to the type of insurance program and discharge method.\nConclusion: According to the results, 8.89% of the total direct costs were directly paid out of the patients\u2019 pockets. The research findings confirm the urgent need to make decisions and implement effective interventions for COVID-19 disease by controlling risk factors and exploiting other countries\u2019 successful experiences and international organizations\u2019 recommendations to decrease the prevalence of the infected and consequently reduce the financial pressure of the disease on patients by approving the expansion of the insurance organizations\u2019 role.\nKeywords: Out-of-pocket payment, COVID-19, Coronavirus, Hospital\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The virus\u2019s rapid spread has left governments with prominent infected individuals [2]. Millions of individuals worldwide are now hospitalized because of the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. In Iran, the first case of COVID-19 was formally announced on February 20, 2019. Given the rapid transmission of this disease, the reported prevalence and prevalence rates seem to be of great concern [4]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by August 10, 2021, more than 200 million positive cases have been confirmed, and more than four million deaths from COVID-19 are estimated worldwide. In this regard, Iran accounted for more than four million cases and 95,000 deaths from COVID19 [5]. On this date, the daily incidence of new cases in Iran with 40,808 is ranked first among other countries [5].\nIn addition to stewardship, generating resources, and providing services, financing is one of the four main\n*Correspondence: gmehralian@gmail.com 2 School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nfunctions of the health system. The conventional techniques of financing health care services include taxes, social insurance, private health insurance, and out-ofpocket (OOP) payments [6]. If the government fails to finance health care services, the financial burden will be directly imposed on individuals who must have the OOP payment [7]. The direct cost paid by the household instead of a service is called OOP payment [8].\nAlthough OOP is typical in both developed and developing countries, it is the most inefficient way of financing the health system and is a defective mechanism for risk aggregation [9]. OOP can have serious adverse effects, including access to health services, especially among the poor [10]. Increasing OOP for private and public health services has led many households towards poverty and intensified the poverty of the poor [11]. The OOP financing is often a declining payment method for health services, and many individuals are imposed by catastrophic costs [12]. With the high price of health care services, about 44 million households (above 150 million persons) worldwide face exorbitant costs annually [13]. Even with health insurance, patients\u2019 OOP seems to increase the risk of poverty [14].\nIn low-income countries, lack of insurance poor coverage, and insufficient social support have raised the OOP payments for households [15]. In Asian countries, OOP payments are one of the main methods of financing the health system [16, 17]. In general, OOP accounts for 18.6% of total health system expenditures in the third world [18].\nIn addition to the physical and physiological burden, COVID-19 has imposed a substantial financial burden on the health systems in different countries. In a study on the economic burden of COVID-19 in China, Jin et\u00a0al. reported the total health and social costs of COVID-19 to be 0.62 and 383.02 billion dollars, respectively [19]. In research on the consequences and economic burden of 173,942 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the United States, it is estimated that the average hospitalization cost is $ 12,046 [20]. Another research in the US conducted on a large sample of 4075 patients to assess the OOP for COVID-19 found that Medicare advantage patients and privately insured patients contributed to hospitalization costs 49.1% and 71.21%, respectively. In this study, the average OOP for both groups was about 2688$ [21].\nMeasuring and monitoring health expenditures would help the policymakers in the health system select appropriate policies to protect patients [22]. Households\u2019 OOP rate and the consequent incurrence of exorbitant health care costs are two main factors to be considered in health care planning and policy-making [23]. Given the significance of OOP and its continuous evaluation to\nmonitor justice in financing the health system, this study evaluated the OOP rate among patients with COVID19 admitted to the referral hospital for treatment of COVID19. Therefore, the main research question in this study is how much the OOP is in patients with COVID19 hospitalized in the public sector."

            "text": "Financing the health system in Iran is underpinned by multiple models encompassing the public budget, social, private, supplementary insurance, and OOP. According to Iran\u2019s National Health Accounts, OOP is usually above 50% and ranges from 50.4% in 2004 to 52% in 2013 [24\u201326]. In Gharibi (2013) and Keshavarz\u2019 (2012) studies during 2011\u20132013, the OOP rates were 55 and 59.7%, respectively [27, 28]. Moreover, Amery (2013) and Kavosi (2009) revealed that the exorbitant costs were 8.3 and 14.2%, respectively [29, 30]. Hajizadeh and Nghiem (2011) considered the OOP rate above 50% in Iran as one barrier to access health services [31].\nThe Iranian health system has faced quite a few challenges in terms of financing and the provision of healthcare, so much so that 3% of the people were faced with catastrophic health expenditure annually, leading to dissatisfaction among the citizens [32]. As a practical solution, within the last four decades, the Iranian health system has been initiating several reforms to pave the way towards universal health coverage (UHC) such as the establishment of an extensive Primary Health Care (PHC) network, the family physician program, and recently Health Transformation Plan (HTP) [33]. UHC that assures access to necessary health care services by all the population needs sustainable financing [34]. However, inefficient stewardship of the Iranian healthcare systems and the weak political support for investing in the healthcare sector, on the one hand, and the existence of the unfair international sanctions, on the other hand, can prevent the inflow of financial flows to Iran and consequently, it is hard to achieve the UHC [35]. That\u2019s why out-of-pocket payment is highlighted more than the other sustainable and fair financial resources.\nAccording to a report by the WHO in 2000, countries and health policymakers were encouraged to provide equitable funding [36]. To this end, reforms in the health sector have been of interest to all health policymakers over the past decade, particularly in developing countries [37]. In this regard, the Ministry of Health in Iran implemented the health system transformation plan, which adopted three approaches (namely protecting individuals financially, creating justice in access to health services, and improving the quality of services in hospitals since May 2014. This plan was a stepping stone toward achieving all the ideals of the health system, especially the\nfinancial protection of patients, by providing basic health insurance for the uninsured and decreasing the payments for patients admitted to hospitals affiliated with the Ministry of Health [37]. The implementation of this plan aimed to protect citizens financially against health costs. According to the goal set in this plan, the OOP rate for inpatient services in public hospitals should be decreased by < 10% [38]."

Furthermore, Eisenberg et\u00a0al. (2020) assessed the financial risk for COVID-19-like respiratory hospitalizations in the United States. They reported that the average OOP for patients admitted with respiratory infection in the two groups of consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) and traditional plans were 1961 US $ and 1653 US $, respectively [40]. The findings of this study and previous studies indicate that COVID-19 disease has been associated with financial pressures imposed on patients because of hospitalization and the payment of a part of the treatment costs in the form of OOP. In addition to the need to pay for treatment, COVID-19 seems to have imposed financial pressure on patients by depriving them of some sources of income [41].\nAccording to the results of this study, 57.12% of the OOP rates for the hospitalized patients were associated with pharmaceutical services, and the pharmaceutical cost had the largest share of OOP. Darab et\u00a0 al. in their study on the economic burden of COVID-19 in a reference hospital in southern Iran, reported that the costs of medicines and consumables devices with 28% of the total OOP were ranked second [42]. Medicines are one of the main expenditure items in the treatment of diseases, which, in line with the present study, are reported as the largest share of direct costs in many studies [43, 44].\nThe present results revealed a significant relationship between the OOP of hospitalized patients and the length of stay. Patients\u2019 OOP rates also increased with the increasing length of stay. Hajizadeh and Nghiem conducted a study to promote an understanding of inequality and determinants of the OOP payments and exorbitant health costs for hospital services in Iran using national health services statistics. They concluded that the length of stay were significantly associated with patients\u2019 OOP and increased likelihood of exorbitant health costs [31]. Taheri et\u00a0 al. studied all discharged patients (above 12,000 patients) from\na teaching hospital in the United States. They found out that reducing the patients\u2019 length of stay by a day decreases the total care cost by an average of three percent or less [45]. Riascos and Serna in Colombia conducted a study to predict the patients\u2019 length of stay and estimate its impact on the health costs of about one million persons who had received at least one service during the last year and had not changed their insurance company during 2009\u20132011. They showed that the patients\u2019 long stay in hospitals was costly for service providers, insurers, and patients due to increased demand for health services and the likelihood of serious risks during the stay [46]. Increasing the number of hospitalization days would also affect the cost and quality of the provided care [47]. Prolonged hospitalization increases the use of limited resources and the depreciation of hospital functions [48]. On the other hand, with an increase in length of stay, the costs of patients and the hospital increase, and the patients\u2019 recovery and rehabilitation time also increase, thereby increasing costs [49]. To decrease costs, the length of unnecessary stay for patients should be reduced; hence, different interventions such as discharge planning, care strategies, periodic audits to detect and act against care delays, the use of checklists to plan admissions, the detection of motivated reference physicians can be implemented. Such interventions not only can reduce the hospitalization cost but also the incidence of infections and limited access to resources available to patients can be decreased [50, 51].\nThe present study suggested a statistically significant relationship between OOP for the COVID-19 patients and the discharge method in the death group. In their research, El-Khatib et\u00a0 al. reported a positive relationship between the mortality rate of the COVID19 disease and patients\u2019 OOP [52]. Yang et\u00a0 al. also revealed that the OOP rate in patients increases significantly with approaching death [53]. The significant\n* P-value Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level, B unstandardized coefficients, Std. error standard error\nrelationship between OOP and mortality rates can be because patients with worse conditions need to spend more resources to regain their health, increasing hospital costs and patient payments.\nFinally, the findings also indicated a significant relationship between patients\u2019 OOP and the type of insurance program. In their study in China, You and Kobayashi reported that some types of insurance programs were associated with increased patients\u2019 OOP rates [54]. In Mexico, Gal\u00e1rraga et\u00a0 al. found out that voluntary public insurance for the unemployed and self-employed individuals was associated with a 54% decrease in catastrophic health expenditures [55]. Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) also reported a 40 percent decrease in patients\u2019 OOP following the introduction of Medicare in the United States in 1965 [56]."

            "text": "The present study reported the hospitalized patients\u2019 OOP rate of 8.89%. The findings of this study confirm the urgent need to make decisions and implement effective interventions against COVID-19 by controlling risk factors and using other countries\u2019 successful experiences and international organizations\u2019 recommendations to reduce the prevalence and consequently the economic burden of the disease on patients and expand the role of insurance organizations.\nThe main limitation of the present study was that the OOP rate was estimated based on the documents and financial records of patients registered in HIS. Some patients, however, may have other OOP payments, such as informal payments and payments for drugs not available in the hospital. Such costs are likely to be reflected in official records."
