In humans, maltreated (abused or neglected) children often exhibit antisocial behavior, including violent and sadistic behavior, in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether maltreatment behavior occurs in rodents. Here, we developed an assay system to evaluate conspecific maltreatment behavior in the mouse."

Lidocaine was used to inhibit neural activity in vivo. Brain oscillations were investigated by electroencephalograph. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for protein assay. The mouse model was sequentially subjected to maternal separation (MS), social defeat (SD), and social isolation (SI) in that order (MS/SD/SI model)."

Maltreatment behavior provoked changes in oxytocin, corticosterone, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels.

Abnormal brain oscillations were observed in the MS/SD/SI mice."

Furthermore, child maltreatment is associated with increased risks for many disorders including conduct disorder, personality disorder, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorder [28-30]. Empathy deficit is closely related to antisocial and maltreatment behaviors [31-36], and recent animal studies revealed that emotion contagion or empathy and prosocial behavior occur in rodents [37-40]. However, maltreatment behavior induced by empathy deficit has never been examined in rodents.\nStudies in animals and humans have revealed that early-life stress affects brain development and social behavior in adulthood [7,28,30,41-43]. In fact, early-life stress (child and adolescent abuse and neglect) can induce structural or functional alterations in the brain [44-52]. In a previous study, we characterized behavioral phenotypes of a mouse model generated by a sequential process of early-life social stress imitating child abuse or maltreatment composed of maternal separation (MS), social defeat (SD), and social isolation (SI). The MS/SD/SI mice exhibited hyper-phenotypes of social interaction and offensive aggressiveness and hypo-phenotypes of predator fear and empathy-related behavior.\nIn this study, we developed an assay system to evaluate maltreatment behavior using a perpetrator-victim paradigm. The system consists of a two-chamber apparatus separated by a transparent partition, in which one chamber was provided with a nose-poking hole that triggered foot shocks to a conspecific in the other chamber (Figure 1A). In order to study the relationship between early-life social stresses and antisocial maltreatment behavior, we subjected MS/SD/SI model mice to this assay system and investigated rhythmic brain activities during maltreatment behavior by electrophysiological assessment in vivo."

All efforts were made to minimize suffering. C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129S4/Sv mice were used in the present study.\nencephalitisjournal.org encephalitis |Vol. 2, No. 4| September 21, 2022 99\nThe apparatus and behavioral task for maltreatment behavior The apparatus for maltreatment behavior was constructed by modifying a shuttle box used for an avoidance test (Med Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA). The modified apparatus consisted of two chambers partitioned by a transparent polymethyl methacrylate divider and a stainless-steel grid rod floor (5-mm diameter rods, spaced 0.7 cm apart): one chamber was designated as the victim compartment (10 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 21 cm), and the other chamber as the perpetrator compartment (20 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 21 cm). The grid floor in the victim compartment was exposed, whereas an opaque acrylic plate (20 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 0.3 cm) was placed on the grid floor in the perpetrator compartment in order to prevent electric shocks. The perpetrator compartment contained a nose-poke hole near the transparent divider, comprised of an infrared control, source, and detector. Whenever the beam of the nose-poke was broken by entry of the mouse\u2019s (perpetrator\u2019s) nose from the perpetrator compartment, a 2-second foot shock (1 mA) was delivered to the mouse (victim) in the victim compartment through a grid floor via a computer-controlled animal shocker. We chose 1 mA foot-shock intensity because it resulted in a homogeneous response by victim mice including running, vocalization, and jumping. Thus, perpetrator mice received similar inputs from all victim mice during the maltreatment behaviors. The number of nose-pokes (equal to the number of beam breaks and the number of electric shocks delivered) was recorded in real time, analyzed every 10 minutes, and used for assessing levels of maltreatment behavior. All modules and paradigms were programmed by the MED-SYST-8 interface and software package (Med Associates).\nTo assess maltreating behavior, mice (perpetrator and victim) were initially individually placed in their apparatus chambers for 10 minutes. During the 10-minute habituation, the nosepoke hole was covered with a panel the same as that used for walls in the chamber. When the panel was removed after the 10-minute habituation, the perpetrator mouse could easily find the nose-poke hole. Each experiment was conducted for 120 minutes. Electric shocks were only delivered to a victim mouse at the moment when the perpetrator mouse put its nose into the hole (triggering foot shocks). To optimize the maltreatment behavior, we performed control experiments and obtained a behavior profile of perpetrator mice: (1) the victim mice were given no foot shocks (without foot shocks) or (2) the victim mice were given random foot shocks regardless of nose-poking (random foot shocks). In the random shock condition, the total number of electrical shocks was the\nsame as the average number of nose-pokes in the foot-shock condition. Unless otherwise stated, we used male C57BL/6 mice in all experiments.\nGeneration of the maternal separation/social defeat/social isolation model The MS/SD/SI model was generated as described previously [53]. Male offspring of a C57BL/6 female mouse mated to a C57BL/6 male mouse were used in this study. To mimic early-life social stresses, pups sequentially underwent MS, SD, and SI procedures. Pregnant females were checked for litters daily. If litters were found, the day of birth was defined as postnatal day (P) 0 for that litter. The MS procedure was implemented from P4 to P18. During this period, litters were first separated from their dams and placed in a new cage for 3 hours per day and then were returned to their home cages. The SD, a second social stress paradigm, proceeded for the same mice from P21 to P34. During this period, the mice were singly placed as intruders into the cages of singly housed aggressor C57BL/6 mice (territorial residents) for 10 minutes per day for 10 days between P21 and P34. Adult 8- to 15-weekold male mice that show high level of intermale aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm were selected and used as aggressor mice. As male mice defend their territory against intruding males, the aggressor residents usually initiated a fight. At the beginning of the SD procedure (P21), the mice were separated from their littermates and housed singly (SI) until all experiments were complete. All experiments were started at the age of 9 weeks. The MS/SD model was generated only by MS and SD without SI, and the SI model was generated only by SI, without MS and SD."

            "text": "We developed a behavioral system that measures maltreatment or abusive behavior toward a conspecific to study antisocial behavior in the mouse. We used the perpetrator-victim paradigm and a modified two-compartment operant conditioning chamber with a single nose-poke hole (Figure 1A).\nNormal male C57BL/6 perpetrator mice would put their noses into the hole several times but clearly stopped nose-poking behavior within 30 minutes after seeing the mouse in the victim compartment suffering from foot shocks (Figure 1B). However, normal male C57BL/6 mice exhibited high numbers of nose-pokes in the random and without foot-shock conditions (Figure 1B). There was a significant difference in total number of nose-pokes among the three foot-shock conditions for 120 minutes (with: n = 17, 5.35 \u00b1 0.90; without: n = 16, 38.25 \u00b1 6.75; random: n = 10, 28.40 \u00b1 2.84) (F1,40 = 15.65, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 1C). These results indicate that perpetrators can become conditioned to associate their actions with their conspecific\u2019s distress.\nTo examine whether mPFC and ACC, which are considered to be important in affective and emotional responses for perceiving others\u2019 pain or fear (i.e., empathic behavior), are involved in this behavior, we locally injected lidocaine (4%) through a cannula into mPFC or ACC. With foot shocks, perpetrators injected with lidocaine into the mPFC exhibited increased nose-poking compared with control mice that were similarly treated with saline (Figure 1D). Such increased levels were also observed in perpetrators injected with lidocaine into the ACC (Figure 1D). There was a significant difference in the total number of nose-pokes among the three groups for 120 minutes (saline: n = 16, 7.13 \u00b1 1.52; mPFC-lidocaine: n = 11, 16.10 \u00b1 2.62; ACC-lidocaine: n = 11, 19.73 \u00b1 3.36) (F1,35 = 7.87, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 1E). These results\ndemonstrate that neural functions in mPFC and ACC are involved in maltreatment behavior.\nTaken together, these results suggest that perpetrators may, at their own will, empathically stop nose-poking behaviors in order not to cause distress to conspecific victims.\nStrain difference in maltreating behavior We additionally tested BALB/c and 129S4/Sv mouse strains and found that BALB/c mice showed a similar number of nose-pokes (Figure 2A and B), but 129S4/Sv mice (n = 11) displayed a low number of nose-pokes compared with C57BL/6 (n = 17) and BALB/c mice (n = 11) (F1,36 = 3.78, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 2D), suggesting variations in maltreatment behavior among different inbred mice strains.\nMolecular changes after maltreating behavior Oxytocin, corticosterone, and BDNF levels are known to change with social stress and during prosocial or empathic behavior in human and animals. To determine whether those proteins are involved in maltreatment behavior, oxytocin, corticosterone, and BDNF levels in the perpetrators\u2019 blood and brain were measured after maltreatment behavior. We found that perpetrator mice subjected to maltreatment behavior (maltreated group: n = 14, 139.88% \u00b1 11.71%) had higher levels of oxytocin compared with the non-subjected mice (not maltreated group: n = 8, 100% \u00b1 9.72%; p < 0.05, Student t-test) (Figure 3A). Corticosterone level also increased in the maltreated group (n = 15, 221.27% \u00b1 18.22%) compared with the not maltreated group (n = 14, 100 % \u00b1 8.56 %; p < 0.01, Student t-test) (Figure 3B). However, the maltreated group (n = 15, 63.28% \u00b1 1.94%) showed reduced BDNF level compared to the not maltreated group (n = 9, 100% \u00b1 3.31%; p <\n(A, B) Number of nose-pokes by male C57BL/6 (n = 17), BALB/c (n = 11), and 129S4/Sv (n = 11) mouse strains every 10 minutes.

These results indicate the involvement of oxytocin, corticosterone, and BDNF signaling in maltreatment behavior.\nMaltreatment behavior in the maternal separation/ social defeat/social isolation model Next, we used MS/SD/SI model mice as perpetrators in the maltreatment behavior task [53]. MS/SD/SI mice (n = 46) continued nose-poking behavior for the entire 120-minute experimental period and exhibited a higher number of nosepokes compared to the control mice (n = 17) (F1,61 = 16.44, p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA) (Figure 4A). To compare nose-poking behavior according to social stress paradigm, the MD/SD or SI mice were also used in the maltreatment-behavior task. MS/SD (n = 11) and SI model mice (n = 15) showed similar numbers of nose-pokes to the control mice (Figure 4A). MS/ SD/SI model mice (29.80 \u00b1 5.43) exhibited much higher total number of nose-pokes among the models (control, 5.35 \u00b1 0.90; MS/SD, 9.00 \u00b1 2.53; SI, 8.33 \u00b1 1.80) (F2,85 = 5.13, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 4B). These results indicate that MS/SD/SI mice exhibit unique behavior in maltreatment-behavior tasks and suggest a cumulative effect of social stress on antisocial behavior in the mouse.\nDifferences in brain oscillations during maltreatment behavior Many neuropsychiatric or personality disorders with deficits in empathy and social behavior, such as schizophrenia, autism, dementia, and psychopathy, show abnormal neural activities [38,39,55-62]. Thus, we investigated brain oscillations\nin MS/SD/SI model mice during maltreatment behavior. The control mice showed increased theta- (p < 0.01, Student t-test) and decreased alpha-rhythms (p < 0.05, Student t-test) after the nose-poking behavior compared to before the nose-poking (Figure 5A). However, the MS/SD/SI model mice exhibited a decrease in theta rhythm (p < 0.05, Student t-test) and an increase in alpha rhythm (p < 0.01, Student t-test) after the nose-poking behavior, opposite that of the control (Figure 5B). In addition, MS/SD/SI mice displayed decreased gamma-rhythm compared to control mice (p < 0.05, Student t-test) (Figure 5B).\n(A, B) The number of nose-pokes by each MS/SD (n = 11), SI (n = 15), or MS/SD/SI mouse (n = 46) every 10 minutes (A) and for 120 minutes (B).

            "text": "In this study, we developed an assay for studying antisocial maltreatment behavior in mice. We found that MS/SD/SI model mice generated by early-life chronic social stress paradigms (MS plus SD plus SI) are a suitable candidate mouse model of child abuse or maltreatment.\nIn the maltreatment-behavior task, maltreatment behaviors of perpetrators in the condition with foot shocks were clearly different from their behaviors in the condition without foot shocks or the condition with random foot shocks. However, there was no difference in the number of nose-pokes between the condition without foot shocks and the condition with random foot shocks. These imply that the reduced number of nose-pokes of the perpetrators in the condition with foot shocks is due to reduced locomotion or motor activity of perpetrators by observational fear.\nIn our pilot experiment, lower current intensities (0.2\u20130.6 mA) tended to elicit a high number of nose-pokes compared with 1-mA intensity (data not shown), implying that the behavioral response of the victim mouse affects nose-poking behavior of the perpetrator mouse. The perpetrator mouse becomes conditioned to, or learns, fear by observing the behavior of a conspecific victim and perceives the situation in which they may\nelicit noxious or aversive stimuli to the conspecific. In addition, inactivation of mPFC or ACC, which are considered to be engaged in affective and emotional responses for perceiving others\u2019 pain or fear in animals and humans [39,63-69], worsened the maltreatment behavior of perpetrators. The difference only during the first 20 minutes of the session is probably due to the acute single injection of lidocaine. Taken together, these results suggest that mice can understand, or learn, the principle of the relationship between nose-poking behavior and foot shocks in the perpetrator-victim paradigm, and they may perceive the conspecific victim\u2019s pain or fear in the opposite chamber, and thus they, by their own will, might stop nose-poking in order not to give an aversive stimulus, or damage, to a conspecific victim.\nWe observed differences between mouse strains in the maltreatment-behavior task. First, 129Sv mice exhibited a low number of nose-pokes compared with C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Previous animal studies have suggested strain differences in empathic behavior and aggressiveness [70-73]. In a previous study, we observed that MS/SD/SI mice showed increased offensive aggressiveness, reduced predator fear, and impairment in empathy-related behavior [53]. These behavioral traits may be involved in the antisocial maltreatment behavior of the MS/SD/SI mice. In this context, the maltreat-\nFigure 5 Brain oscillations during maltreatment behavior\nThe control mice (left, n = 11) showed increased theta- and decreased alpha-rhythms immediately after nose-poking behavior.

The MS/SD/SI mouse model may be used to better understand personality disorders such as psychopathy showing antisocial behavior, impaired empathy, and excessive boldness. Cumulative social stress in early life may make mice susceptible to antisocial abusive behaviors. Further studies of maltreatment behavior following treatment with drugs acting on mental disorders would help to characterize the phenotypes of MS/SD/SI model mice as well as the maltreating assay in\nmore detail."
