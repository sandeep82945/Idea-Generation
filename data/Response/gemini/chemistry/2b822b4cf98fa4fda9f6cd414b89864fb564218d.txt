1. **Investigate the role of MDM2 in the development and progression of other types of cancer.** The study focused on the role of MDM2 in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG), but it is possible that MDM2 plays a similar role in other types of cancer. Future research could investigate the expression and function of MDM2 in other types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer.
2. **Develop new drugs that target MDM2.** The study identified several natural flavonoid-derived compounds that have potential anticancer properties and that target MDM2. Future research could focus on developing new drugs that target MDM2, either by inhibiting its expression or by blocking its interaction with p53.
3. **Investigate the use of MDM2 inhibitors in combination with other cancer therapies.** The study found that MDM2 inhibitors have potential anticancer activity, but it is possible that they could be even more effective when used in combination with other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Future research could investigate the use of MDM2 inhibitors in combination with other cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.
4. **Develop biomarkers to predict response to MDM2 inhibitors.** The study did not identify any biomarkers that could predict response to MDM2 inhibitors. Future research could focus on developing biomarkers that could help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from MDM2 inhibitor therapy.
5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors.** The study was conducted in vitro and in vivo, but it is necessary to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors in humans. Future research could focus on conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors in patients with cancer.
