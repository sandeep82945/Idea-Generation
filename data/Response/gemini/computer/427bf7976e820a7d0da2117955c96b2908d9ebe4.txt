1. **Investigate the effectiveness of SGDCTH in detecting spammer groups in other domains.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SGDCTH in detecting spammer groups in the e-commerce domain. However, it is unclear whether SGDCTH can be applied to other domains, such as social media, online forums, or review websites. Future research could investigate the generalizability of SGDCTH to other domains.


2. **Explore the use of different clustering algorithms for generating candidate spammer groups.** The paper uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to generate candidate spammer groups. However, there are many other clustering algorithms that could be used for this purpose. Future research could explore the use of different clustering algorithms to see if they can improve the performance of SGDCTH.


3. **Develop new methods for purifying candidate spammer groups.** The paper uses a group purification method to filter out innocent individuals from candidate spammer groups. However, this method is based on a set of heuristics and may not be effective in all cases. Future research could develop new methods for purifying candidate spammer groups that are more accurate and robust.


4. **Investigate the impact of different network construction methods on the performance of SGDCTH.** The paper uses a heterogeneous induced sub-network construction method to construct the network on which SGDCTH is applied. However, there are many other network construction methods that could be used. Future research could investigate the impact of different network construction methods on the performance of SGDCTH.


5. **Develop new methods for detecting spammer groups that are robust to evasion techniques.** Spammers are constantly developing new techniques to evade detection. Future research could develop new methods for detecting spammer groups that are robust to these evasion techniques.
