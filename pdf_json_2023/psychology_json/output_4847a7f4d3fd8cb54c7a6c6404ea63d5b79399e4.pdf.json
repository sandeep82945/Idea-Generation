            "text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of lung cancers,1 and the majority of NSLCC patients are found to be in advanced inoperable stages.2 Up to now, the clinical treatment of NSCLC has mainly depended on chemotherapeutic agents,3 which suffers from drug resistance and side effects.4,5 Recently, high levels of iron metabolism have been found in NSCLC, which is positive for inducing irondependent lipid peroxidation and nally ferroptosis, which is becoming a new strategy for NSCLC therapy.6,7 Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is overexpressed in NSCLC and specically converts lipid peroxides (LPO) into lipoid alcohols, plays important roles in the regulation of ferroptosis.8\u201311 Though GPX4 inhibitors have been used to trigger ferroptosis,12,13 the hypoxia microenvironment, existing in most solid tumors, restricts ferroptosis heavily because hypoxia inducible factors inhibit ferritinophagy and thus reduce the free iron pool and reactive oxygen species, preventing cells from undergoing ferroptosis.14\u201316 Therefore, addressing the hypoxia-induced\nntiers Science Center for Smart Materials hemical Engineering, Dalian University of dujj@dlut.edu.cn hnology, 26 Yucai Road, Jiangbei District,\n(ESI) available: Experimental methods, ization, and gures. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\ninhibition to ferroptosis in NSCLC therapy deserves much attention.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is a charmingmethod in tumor treatment because of its minimal invasiveness, non-drug resistance, controllable therapeutic area and so forth. In principle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced in PDT, can promote intracellular lipid peroxidation.17,18 However, among the ROS, 1O2, produced by typical type II photosensitizers (e.g. Ce6 and porphyrin),19\u201331 contributes little to LPO formation. Conversely, the radicals (e.g. superoxide anion radicals ($O2\n\u2212) and hydroxyl radicals ($OH))32\u201334 formed in type I PDT did well in oxidizing lipids even under hypoxic conditions.35\u201337 However, successful examples of type I PDT-synergistic ferroptosis have been rare in NSCLC therapy.\nIn our former work, a GPX4-targeting probe ENBO-ML210 was reported for the selective imaging of NSCLC, wherein the introduction of uorophore ENBO did not affect the interaction of inhibitor ML210 with GPX4.38 Additionally, previous research about the type I photosensitizer ENBS is generally considered to indicate hypoxia tolerance.33 Inspired by ENBO-ML210, herein, ENBS-ML210 was developed, using type I photosensitizer ENBS instead of ENBO, as a GPX4-targeting photosensitizer for NSCLC therapy (Scheme 1). Under 660 nm light irradiation, ENBS-ML210 produced $O2\n\u2212 to induce lipid peroxidation and reduce GPX4 expression with more than 70% cell death rate under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This ingenious strategy provides a paradigm for the development of ferroptosisbased NSCLC therapy with hypoxia.\nChem.

As shown in Fig. 1A, ENBSML210 exhibited similar UV-vis absorption and uorescence emission (600\u2013700 nm) to ENBS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level with Gaussian 09 (Fig. S8\u2020), and the DEg between the HOMO and LUMO of ENBS-ML210 (2.38 eV) is similar to that of ENBS (DEg = 2.39 eV). In addition, the UV-vis absorption and uorescence spectra of ENBS-ML210 were still in the NIR window in different solvents (Fig. S9 and S10\u2020). The generation of ROS by ENBS-ML210was evaluated by using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). As shown in Fig. 1B, the absorbance of DPBF at 415 nm decreased dramatically under both 21% and 2% oxygen conditions under 660 nm light irradiation (Fig. S11\u2020), indicating little O2 dependence. Furthermore, a dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) uorescence probe was used as a specic $O2\n\u2212 probe. The green uorescence intensity at 526 nm (DHR123) distinctly increased under 660 nm light irradiation (Fig. 1C), indicating that ENBS-ML210 has a good ability to produce $O2\n\u2212 as a type I photosensitizer. To further detect and differentiate between $O2\n\u2212, 1O2 and $OH, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed in which $O2\n\u2212 and $OH were trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-propylamine-n-oxide (DMPO) ($O2 \u2212 was in MeOH and $OH was in H2O), and 1O2 was trapped by\n9096 | Chem.

As shown in Fig. 2A, real-time uptake imaging of ENBSML210 was performed in H1299 cells. With the prolongation of incubation time, the red uorescence intensity gradually increased and reached the maximum aer 90 min. Furthermore, a long retention time of ENBS-ML210 of at least 360 min was observed in H1299 cells (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, subcellular localization imaging showed that the uorescence of ENBSML210 was well overlapped with that of the lysosomal staining agent LysoTracker (Pearson's coefficient: 0.922), which is much better than MitoTracker in mitochondria (0.695) and Hoechst 33342 in the nucleus (0.098) (Fig. 2C). Moreover, an immunocyto-uorescence assay was introduced to analyze the cellular colocalization of ENBS-ML210 with GPX4 using an Alexaour 488-labeled uorescent secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. S12,\u2020 GPX4 staining with its uorescent secondary antibody showed green uorescence, which was well colocalized with the red uorescence of ENBS-ML210 (Pearson's coefficients: 0.832). The above results demonstrated that ENBSML210 mainly targeted GPX4 in lysosomal membranes of H1299 cells.\nThe ROS generation of ENBS-ML210 was explored in vitro.

Furthermore, dihydroethidium (DHE), singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG), and hydroxyphenyl uorescein (HPF) were used to detect intracellular $O2\n\u2212, 1O2 and $OH, respectively. The results showed that ENBS-ML210 exhibited an excellent capability in generating $O2\n\u2212 in vitro, and it also produced a small amount of $OH.\nStudy about the effect of hypoxia on ferroptosis\nDetermining the effect of hypoxia on ferroptosis is crucial for the treatment of NSCLC. ML210 was introduced as a ferroptosis inducer in MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells), 4T1 (mouse breast cancer cells), and H1299 cells (human non-small cell lung cancer cells) under normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (2% O2), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, whenML210 was 10 mM, the cell survival rates of MCF-7 cells were 73% (normoxia) and 83% (hypoxia), and the cell survival rates of 4T1 cells changed little whether under normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Interestingly, we found the cell survival rate of H1299 cells exhibited obvious change between normoxia conditions (40%) and hypoxia conditions (79%), suggesting that hypoxia could signicantly inhibit ferroptosis (Fig. 3C and S13\u2020). Next, we evaluated the expression of GPX4 protein in MCF-7, 4T1, and H1299 cells by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3D, GPX4 protein was expressed in three kinds of cells, and was most\nChem.

The expression of GPX4 in H1299 cells was signicantly reduced under normoxia, while the expression of GPX4 was hardly reduced under hypoxia. The above results showed that ferroptosis was inhibited under hypoxia. The process of the effect of hypoxia on ferroptosis in tumor cells is shown in Fig. 3E. ML210, a ferroptosis inducer, inhibited the overexpression of GPX4 in tumor cells, and ferroptosis was inhibited under hypoxia because the reduction of ROS was not conducive to ferritinophagy.14 In contrast, ferroptosis could occur normally under normoxia. Therefore, to overcome this shortcoming of ML210, ENBS-ML210 was developed to reverse hypoxia-induced inhibition of ferroptosis in NSCLC.\nMechanism of reversing ferroptosis resistance in vitro\nThe inactivation of GPX4 could lead to the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which is an important sign of ferroptosis.

As shown in Fig. 4A, under 21%O2 conditions, stronger green uorescence was observed in the ML210 and ENBS-ML210 groups, while very weak green uorescence was observed in the control groups. In addition, the green uorescence almost disappeared in the ML210 group under 2% O2 conditions, while green uorescence was displayed by the ENBS-ML210 + light group, indicating that ENBSML210 could reverse hypoxia-induced inhibition of ferroptosis. ENBS-ML210 could lead to lipid peroxidation by reducing the expression of GPX4 and the generation of ROS under light irradiation. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4B and C, the ENBSML210 + light group displayed 15-fold and 7.7-fold stronger uorescence intensity than the control group under 21%O2 and 2% O2 conditions, respectively, while the ENBS + light group showed 5-fold stronger uorescence intensity compared with the control group, showing that ENBS-ML210 could promote ferroptosis through PDT-induced ROS. The cell death was veried using a cell live/dead stain test. As expected, ENBSML210 induced complete destruction of H1299 cells aer 660 nm light irradiation compared with control and ENBS groups (Fig. S14\u2020). Moreover, FITC-Annexin V/PI doublestaining revealed that both ENBS and ENBS-ML210 were able to induce apoptosis and necrosis upon irradiation (Fig. S15\u2020).\nWestern blotting with ENBS-ML210 revealed that the intracellular GPX4 protein expression was reduced under light irradiation under 21% O2 and 2% O2 conditions (Fig. 4D). In addition, the expression of GPX4 protein with the ENBS-ML210 + light group was less under normoxia than that under hypoxia, indicating that hypoxia may inhibit ferroptosis. The cytotoxicity of ENBS-ML210 at different oxygen levels was investigated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to explore the therapeutic effect. As shown in Fig. S16,\u2020 ENBS-ML210 exhibited weak cytotoxicity to COS-7 cells, while the killing effects on MCF and 4T1 cells were obvious (IC50 = 0.51 mM and IC50 = 0.62 mM, respectively). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 4E, under normoxic conditions (21% O2), the IC50 value of ENBS-ML210 reached 0.19 mM under light irradiation, which was better than that of ENBS (IC50 = 0.28 mM). Furthermore, the cell survival rate was as low as 30% for ENBS-ML210 (1 mM) under hypoxic conditions (2% O2), indicating its good therapeutic effect under hypoxia (Fig. 4F). The above results showed that ENBS-ML210 has good killing selectivity toward H1299 cells. In general, a simple schematic diagram of the synergistic mechanism of reversing ferroptosis resistance by type I PDT is shown in Fig. 4G. Obviously, ferroptosis is inhibited under hypoxia conditions. ENBS-ML210 could lead to the reduction of GPX4, and promoted lipid peroxidation through the generation of $O2\n\u2212 by type I PDT under light irradiation, thus promoting the ferroptosis of tumor cells.\nAntitumor study in vivo\nThe excellent tumoricidal efficiency of ENBS-ML210 at the cell level encouraged us to further evaluate the therapeutic effect in vivo.
