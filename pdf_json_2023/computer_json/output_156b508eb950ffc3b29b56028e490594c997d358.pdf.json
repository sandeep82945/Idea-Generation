            "text": "In recent years, there has been international progress in developing platforms that support the reproducibility and reusability of research data. For example, EUDAT adopts a service architecture integrating multiple information systems to cover the entire research data lifecycle [1]. Even in Japan, the NII Research Data Cloud (NII RDC) has been under development since 2017, led by the National Institute of Informatics [2].\nIn realizing this architecture, ensuring data interoperability is becoming the next challenge. If the meaning and structure assigned to research data generated by one information system cannot be adequately inherited, a different information system cannot interpret the data. This failure causes a severe loss of reproducibility and reusability of the research.\nTo address this issue, developing an application profile is essential in handling the meaning and structure of data between different information systems [3]. In RDM platform development, research data interoperability could be maximized by developing application profiles. However, there is no established procedure for constructing application profiles. This study introduces the process for developing an application profile using ontology theory and technology through our NII RDC development experience."

As a premise, we use \u201cuser story\u201d method for determining specific functional requirements for NII RDC. A user story is a description of a function that is valuable to the user of the system or software, as expressed in the following manner:\n\"As [a user persona], I want [to perform this action] so that [I can accomplish this goal]\"\nThese stories include essential information for understanding the meaning and structure assigned to the data generated by an information system. We extracted necessary terms from 138 NII RDC user stories by splitting them into subject/verb/object."

Note that \"access rights\" was found to be a term not covered by Activity Streams 2.0, so we adopted \"Rights Statement\" defined by DCMI Metadata Terms.\nCoRDI2023-23 2"
