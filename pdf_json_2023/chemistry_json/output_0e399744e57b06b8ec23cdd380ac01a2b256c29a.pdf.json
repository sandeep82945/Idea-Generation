Unlike silicon anodes, which are chemically stable against electrolytes prior to electrochemical cycling, lithium-metal anodes are highly reactive toward electrolyte components and suffer from lithium dendrite formation and low coulombic efficiency (CE) due to the irreversible electrolyte decomposition-induced consumption of active lithium-metal and SEI thickening. Uncontrolled lithium dendrite formation poses safety (e.g., short-circuiting and explosion) risks and thus hinders the realization of practical lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). Lithiummetal anodes for LMBs engage in spontaneous chemical reactions with electrolyte components to form uncontrolled interlayers that do not effectively mitigate the electrochemical decomposition of electrolytes. This drawback highlights the need to modify the content and type of SEI formers, which regulate anode-electrolyte interfaces, and liquid electrolyte formulations including salts and solvents, which alter the (de) solvation chemistry of lithium-ions. Based on an understanding of existing SEI chemistries, this review highlights important ndings that have enabled considerable improvements in the interfacial stability of silicon and lithium-metal anodes and establishes SEI structure\u2013property relationships to suggest new research directions for liquid electrolyte chemistry. Therefore, the present summary is expected to generate signicant ripple effects in the eld of next-generation high-energy battery electrolytes."

SEI characterization can be performed on scales ranging from molecular arrangements to millimeterrange macroscopic objects. A comprehensive understanding of structural and morphological SEI changes at the microscale can be achieved by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging (Fig. 2a and d). The coverage ability and (electro) chemical/mechanical integrity of SEIs directly affect the interfacial stability of anodes. SEIs with a coverage suitable for limiting the irrevocable damage to the anode surface directly in contact with the electrolyte conserve the uniform lithium-ion supply path, limit SEI thickening, and enable the reversible electrochemical reaction of the anode without a large overpotential.14 In addition, strain-adaptable SEIs sustaining repeated anode expansion and contraction ensure the conservation of the long-range anode microstructure with the use of minimal amounts of SEI-forming compounds.20,21\nMicroscale visual observations of SEIs provide information on the effects of their chemical composition, thickness, and morphology on anode performance in batteries. Further information such as the crystallinity of SEI constituents and their spatial arrangement can be provided by nanoscale analysis. The spectroscopic methods used to identify the chemical structure of SEIs include infrared spectroscopy,22,23 Raman spectroscopy,24 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),23,25 time-ofight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).26 Depth proling techniques involving sputtering using X-rays or ion beams have been used to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the 3D chemical structure of SEIs. Among the above methods, XPS and\n9998 | Chem.

SEIs produced on lithium-metal anodes benet from mechanically robust inorganic species in the inner layer and therefore efficiently suppress lithium dendrite formation and lithium isolation, improving the electrochemical reversibility of lithium-metal.15 Mechanically fragile and organic-rich SEIs with low moduli decrease the CE and cycling lifetime of LMBs, whereas inorganic-rich SEIs with LiF, Li3N, LixNOy, and Li2O in the inner layer exert opposite effects.15"

The Wang group demonstrated that the SEI formed on a silicon anode in the presence of FEC consisted of inert LiF nanoparticles in a thin (\u223c26 nm) amorphous layer (Fig. 3d).19 This result was largely consistent with the ndings of Jaumann et al., who showed that 5 nm nanocrystalline LiF particles are produced at silicon nanoparticle anodes upon the addition of FEC.31 In contrast, the thick (\u223c41 nm) SEI formed on a silicon anode in an additive-free electrolyte was composed of electrochemically active Li2O, which forms resistive LixSiOy species (Li2O + Si + e \u2212 / LixSiOy + Li +) during delithiation. LiF nanocrystals not only enhanced the mechanical integrity of the dense SEI on the silicon anode, but also induced interstitial defects in this layer and facilitated the movement of lithium-ions through the same.31"

Cui et al. used cryo-TEM to show that electrolytes with dissolved Ni2+ promote the formation of nanoscale nickel clusters with a median diameter of 1.5 nm inhomogeneously distributed in the SEI on lithium-metal anodes, revealing that the SEI with these clusters was more than four times thicker than that without nickel clusters (Fig. 5c).72 Moreover, the nickel-rich SEI led to the continuous reduction of the electrolyte by providing a pathway for electron transport and hindered lithium-ion migration, thus resulting in large ohmic polarization that induced unwanted metallic lithium plating on the anode below 0 V vs. Li/Li+ (Fig. 5c)."

On silicon thin lm anodes, SA formed a hydrocarbon- and Li2CO3-based SEI that inhibited salt decomposition and improved anode cyclability.78 However, when high-surfacearea silicon/mesoporous carbon anodes were used, SA formed a thick and resistive organic-rich SEI and resulted in performance similar to that observed in the absence of electrolyte additives.79 In this regard, one can consider the complementary usage of mechanically robust and electrically insulating inorganic compounds such as LiF and adhesive deformable organic species in the SEI to realize high-structural-stability silicon anodes without well-dened spaces (such as those observed for graphite anodes) and facile lithium-ion transport at silicon anodes while mitigating electrolyte decomposition. Early studies on SEIs produced on lithium-metal anodes mainly focused on the formation and identication of organic-rich SEIs.80\u201382 The generation of organic-rich SEIs is ascribed to two reasons. First, as the Fermi energy level of metallic lithium exceeds the reduction potential of organic solvents, the lithiummetal anode engages in spontaneous chemical reactions with the organic solvent-containing electrolyte, which causes aggressive SEI formation.83 Second, in the case of conventional electrolytes with an inorganic salt concentration of 1 M, lithium-ions are coordinated by the nucleophilic oxygen atoms of solvent molecules, while anions are present in bare form, i.e., are relatively uninvolved in the formation of solvation sheaths.83 Under such conditions, anion depletion occurs in the vicinity of the lithium-metal anode, as most mobile anions migrate to the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncathode during charging. Consequently, the SEI is mostly composed of byproducts generated by the reductive decomposition of organic solvents. The composition of organic-rich SEIs depends on the type of solvent used. For instance, ROCO2Li, (ROCO2Li)2, lithium ethylene monocarbonate (LEMC), dilithium ethylene dicarbonate (Li2EDC), lithium methyl carbonate (LMC), and RCO3Li are produced in carbonate-based solvents, while ethereal solvents generate lithium alkoxides (ROLi) (Fig. 6a).44,81,83 The formation of organic SEIs is easier in carbonate-based solvents than in ethereal solvents because of the higher reactivity of the former toward lithium-metal. However, recent research on the interfaces of lithium-metal anodes has not dealt solely with the formation of organic-rich SEIs because of their limitations.84 Organic-rich SEIs strongly adhere to the lithium-metal anode and are therefore stably anchored, although their low mechanical strength and interfacial energy result in poor resistance to volume changes during repeated lithium plating and stripping resulting in the formation of damaged and less dense SEIs (Fig. 6a and Table 1). In addition to this mechanical disintegrity, lithium-ion diffusion to the SEI\u2013lithium interface is uneven, leading to vertical lithium penetration and ultimately resulting in lithium dendrite growth. These processes cause irreversible lithium consumption, low CE, and a rapid increase in interfacial resistance. In severe cases, the current collector may become disconnected from the lithium-metal anode and large amounts of inactive lithium residuals can be formed. Finally, the\nChem.

For these reasons, researchers strive to improve the cyclability of LMBs by mixing or layering inorganic SEI components with organic ones rather than by solely forming organic SEIs on lithium-metal anodes. The Mullins group demonstrated that the relative proportions of organic and inorganic species in the SEI inuence its mechanical strength (Fig. 7),85 revealing that highmechanical-strength multicomponent inorganic-rich SEIs can be realized on lithium-metal anodes.\n3.1.2 LiF and Li2CO3-decorated SEIs. Although various structures have been proposed as interface modiers for silicon and lithium-metal anodes, LiF remains the dominant material for realizing highly stable SEIs. The formation of LiF-based SEIs on lithium-metal anodes has been extensively studied to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites owing to the high chemical stability of these SEIs, their low solubility in electrolytes, high shear modulus, high mechanical strength, and wide electrochemical stability window (Table 1).51,54,86 Unlike Li2CO3, which has a narrow band gap and low surface energy, LiF has a wide band gap and therefore does not allow electron tunneling to the top layer of the SEI.87 The lower solubility of LiF in carbonate solvents compared to that of Li2CO3 helps inhibit SEI dissolution and enables long-term anode stability.88 However, the poor\n10004 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9996\u201310024\nionic conductivity of LiF (\u223c10\u221231 S cm\u22121) leads to sluggish lithium-ion diffusion kinetics and generates signicant overpotentials upon lithium deposition and stripping.89 Li2CO3 features a higher ionic conductivity (10\u22128\u201310\u221211 S cm\u22121) and lower density (2.11 g cm\u22123) than LiF (2.64 g cm\u22123) and may therefore facilitate the diffusion of lithium-ions through the grain boundaries of SEI components.90,91 Nonetheless, the low mechanical strength and surface energy of Li2CO3 cannot prevent the generation of lithium dendrites, making it an unsuitable SEI component for LMBs (Fig. 6b).57,92 Another important factor to consider for the formation of high-quality anode SEIs is their solubility in the employed electrolytes during cycling or at elevated temperatures, as SEI dissolution accelerates the side reactions of electrolytes at anodes. In this regard, LiF and Li2CO3-decorated SEIs have complementary features that can compensate for the corresponding individual shortcomings (Fig. 6b). SEIs containing both LiF and Li2CO3 can exhibit high ionic conductivity while featuring an electrically insulating nature, high interfacial energy, and high mechanical strength, thus helping in suppressing dendritic lithium creation and improve lithium-ion diffusion to lithiummetal anodes.40,93 The synergistic effect of LiF and Li2CO3 was demonstrated by Wu et al.40 According to their calculations, a heterostructured SEI decorated with LiF and Li2CO3 featured a higher lithium-ion adsorption energy (0.66 eV) than Li2CO3rich (0.47 eV) and LiF-rich (0.49 eV) SEIs, thus exhibiting a higher affinity for lithium-ions and leading to a more uniform lithium-ion ux and lithium deposition. Additionally, the difficulty of electron transport through the LiF and Li2CO3decorated SEI allowed lithium-ions to be reduced at the SEI\u2013 lithium interface and not on the SEI surface, which inhibited the formation of lithium dendrites. Stable SEI formation on lithium-metal anodes can be achieved through the appropriate combination of several SEI components with different characteristics rather than through the use of a single SEI component.94 Multilayer SEI structuring is further discussed in Section 3.3.4.

View Article Online SEI components have also been reported for silicon-based anodes.91,95,96 An engineered LiF and Li2CO3-containing SEI on a silicon thin lm anode was shown to be less resistive during lithiation and delithiation while preventing electrolyte reduction because of its superior electronically insulating nature.91\nIcosauoro-15-crown-5-ether, which forms resistive LiF impeding the electrochemical reaction of anodes, was combined with ion-conductive Li2CO3 to expand the lifespan of a SiO-graphite anode.95 The defects present at the LiF/Li2CO3 interface can not only cause electron depletion near Li2CO3 and thus enhance its insulating properties, but also provide a pathway for lithium-ion transport and thus increase lithiumion conductivity.\n3.1.3 Nitrogen-embedded SEIs. Lewis-basic nitrogencontaining species such as LiNxOy, Li3N, N\u2013SOx, NO3 \u2212, NxOy \u2212, and R\u2013NO2 \u2212 can support facile lithium-ion transport through the SEI while minimizing the localization of the lithium-ion ux (Fig. 6c).61,97 In particular, LiNO3, which is a representative substance for constructing nitrogen-embedded SEIs, can be reduced to LiNxOy and Li3N (LiNO3 + 8Li\n+ + 8e\u2212 / Li3N + 3Li2O). Additionally, Li3N can be generated by the decomposition of LiNxOy.61,98\u2013100 Both LiNxOy and Li3N, which are the main products of LiNO3 reduction, exhibit high ion conductivities of \u223c10\u22123 S cm\u22121 at room temperature and help preserve a uniform lithium-ion ux at the lithium-metal anode even at high current densities (Table 1).101,102 To take advantage of nitrogencontaining SEI formation on the lithium-metal anode, one should pair the use of LiNO3 as an electrolyte additive with the use of high-donor number (high-DN) ethereal solvents such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether.103\u2013105 However, as the DN (21.1 kcal mol\u22121) of the NO3 \u2212 anion exceeds those of carbonate solvents (16.4 kcal mol\u22121 for EC, 17 kcal mol\u22121 for dimethyl carbonate, 16.0 kcal mol\u22121 for diethyl carbonate (DEC), and 9.1 kcal mol\u22121 for FEC), LiNO3 is insufficiently dissociated in conventional carbonate-based electrolytes.61,105 This limited dissociation can be enhanced through the use of solubilizers such as tris(pentauorophenyl) borane, indium triuoromethanesulfonate, and lithium tetrauoroborate, additives with different cations, and organic nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate.61,97,106\u2013112 A Lewis acid\u2013base adduct forming a dative bond with LiNO3 via its 1-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole moiety was developed to increase the solubility of LiNO3 in carbonate-based electrolytes.113 Early studies on LiNO3 as an electrolyte additive primarily focused on its role in the formation of nitrogen-decorated SEIs during the operation of LMBs and the inuence of this salt on SEI properties.114 Besides, LiNO3 tends to weaken the ion\u2013dipole interaction between lithium-ions and solvents and enhances lithium-ion desolvation kinetics, particularly at extremely low temperatures.115 The construction of nitrogen-containing SEIs in LMBs can be achieved by directly introducing LiNO3, nitrates, or solvents capable of generating Li3N-based SEIs. For instance, 2,2,2-triuoro-N,N-dimethylacetamide (FDMA; FDMA + 6Li+ + 6e\u2212 / LiC2OF3 + 2LiCH3 + Li3N and FDMA + 7Li\n+ + 7e\u2212 / LiCF3 + LiCO + 2LiCH3 + Li3N) can result in the formation of Li3N-containing SEIs.116 In the same manner, nitrogencontaining SEIs with high ionic conductivity species such as\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nLi3N enable fast lithium-ion transport at silicon anodes.117\u2013119 Silicon nitrides (Si3N4 and SiNx) feature high mechanical stability (Young's modulus > 1.1 GPa) and can act as structural buffers for the volume change of silicon during repeated lithiation and delithiation, enabling the formation of Li3N for iontransmittable SEI generation in carbonate-based electrolytes.117\u2013119 Thus, the coating of silicon anode particles with silicon nitride can be a good option for the formation of nitrogen-containing SEIs without using LiNO3, which is poorly soluble in carbonate-based electrolytes. Interfacial engineering using nitrogen-donating compounds offers versatile routes to the construction of such SEIs.\n3.1.4 Phosphorus- and uorine-rich SEIs. Phosphate-based additives forming polar P\u2013Omotifs as SEI constituents tune the channels for facile lithium-ion movement through LiF-rich SEIs providing grain boundaries as dominant lithium-ion pathways (Fig. 6d).120 In particular, lithium diuorophosphate (LiDFP) forms ionically conductive SEIs composed of LiF and polar P\u2013O species on graphite anodes and is therefore commonly chosen as an electrolyte additive for EV-adaptable high-power batteries over wide temperature ranges.121 Moreover, this additive also effectively works for silicon-based anodes.122 When employed in conjunction with FEC, LiDFP forms P\u2013O species along with the LiF and polymeric species (polyene and poly(VC)) formed by FEC and reduces the SEI impedance of silicon-based anodes.122 Lithium diuoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBOP) forms spatially exible SEIs that comprise LiF and phosphorus-/ uorine-containing organics and can tolerate the volume changes due to silicon lithiation and delithiation.122,123 The building blocks of phosphorus- and uorine-rich SEIs can be formed by the (electro)chemical decomposition of phosphorusand uorine-donating compounds. LiDFP,120 LiDFBOP, and ethoxy(pentauoro)cyclotriphosphazene (EFPN) were reported to dictate the distribution of phosphorus in the SEI.124 Polar P\u2013F and P\u2013O species facilitate the permeation of lithium-ions through the SEI by promoting their desolvation and uniform supply while mitigating the localized current distribution across the anode surface (Fig. 6d). The prevalence of LiF in the SEI enables a homogeneous lithium-ion ux, suppresses dendrite formation, and restrains the dissolution of the SEI into the electrolyte;86 moreover, high mechanical strength125 and low solubility can be achieved using uorine-donating compounds such as uorinated solvents and salts with uorine-releasing anions.54"

Thus, LiF acts as glue between the organic SEI layer and the lithium\u2013silicon alloy (Fig. 8). To investigate the effect of LiF on silicon anodes, Haruta et al. deposited a 4 nm-thick LiF layer on a 100 nm-thick silicon thin lm using radiofrequency sputtering.129 The LiF-coated siliconlm electrode without additives showed improved CE during initial cycling. LiF was found to effectively bind to lithiated silicon and lithium-containing organic SEI components, stably maintaining the anchoring state of the SEI and thus ensuring the reversible lithiation and delithiation of silicon anodes. In addition, despite the low ionic conductivity of LiF, facile lithium-ion transport is expected in LiF-enriched SEIs, as the contact between LiF and other SEI components such as Li2CO3 results in space charge accumulation along their interfaces.91 Compared to dense VC-derived SEIs comprising poly(VC), FECderived SEIs composed of LiF nanocrystals provide defects and\nFig. 8 Schematic illustration of fluorinated structures, polymeric structures, and less Li2SiF6-containing SEIs on silicon anodes.\n10006 | Chem.

This section deals with the benecial impact of strain-adaptive polymeric SEI species on silicon anodes. The build-up of spatially deformable polymeric SEIs has been intensively studied to alleviate SEI collapse due to severe volume changes during repeated silicon lithiation and delithiation.130\u2013133 Organic SEI components such as Li2EDC, LiOCO2CH3, and LiOCO2C2H5 formed by the decomposition of carbonate solvents are more soluble in conventional carbonatebased electrolytes than inorganic SEI components, which complicates the protection of anodes against parasitic reactions with electrolytes.134 Unlike that of short-chain organic species, the solubility of polymeric species in electrolytes is limited. Thus, polymeric SEIs remain stably anchored on silicon anodes while effectively inhibiting electrolyte decomposition by blocking electron supply. In addition, electrolyte additives releasing uorine to form LiF, which can act as glue for maintaining the connectivity of SEI components and simultaneously form exible polymeric SEIs, have been developed to enhance the adhesion between polymer species and silicon anodes. 5- Methyl-4-((triuoromethoxy)methyl)-1,3-dioxol-2-one (DMVCOCF3) was shown to contribute to the formation of a spatially deformable polymeric SEI along with VC and 5-methyl-4-((trimethylsilyloxy)methyl)-1,3-dioxol-2-one.132 In addition, the OCF3\n\u2212 anion formed by the reduction of DMVC-OCF3 led to an improvement in adhesion between the polymeric SEI and silicon-containing anode by forming LiF. 4-(Allyloxy)phenyl uorosulfate produced a polymeric SEI comprising LiF to accommodate the large volume changes of silicon-based anodes and secure morphological stability (Fig. 8).133 Linear compounds with \u2013CF3 end groups change their adsorption orientation on the amorphous silicon surface at open-circuit voltage and enable better protection of silicon anodes by uorinated polymeric or organic species-based SEIs.135\n3.2.3 Less Li2SiF6-incorporated SEIs. Unlike LiF, Li2SiF6, which is formed by the chemical reaction between silicon and LiPF6 (Si + 2LiPF6 / Li2SiF6 + 2PF3) or HF (Si + 6HF + 2Li + + 2e\u2212 / Li2SiF6 + 3H2), imposes a high interfacial resistance on the silicon anode and provokes the loss of active silicon as a lithium-storage site (Fig. 8).139\u2013142 Yu et al. demonstrated the generation of PF3 in a reaction between a LiPF6-based electrolyte and a silicon anode inside a reactor at 90 \u00b0C and conrmed the formation of crystalline Li2SiF6 on the silicon anode by mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction analysis.143 The electrically insulating Li2SiF6 (conductivity <10\n\u221210 S cm\u22121) formed on the surface of silicon anodes impedes both lithium-ion and electron transport (Fig. 8).144 The silicon anodes can be coated with TiN, TiO2, SiO2, and SiC to suppress the generation of Li2SiF6 via an undesired reaction with LiPF6.143,145\u2013147 However, the carbon coating layer on silicon may catalyze its reaction with LiPF6 and aggravate the formation of Li2SiF6.139,147 To inhibit Li2SiF6 formation, coatings such as titanium nitride and silicon carbide have been proposed.143,147 Another method of mitigating Li2SiF6 generation and thus securing a long cycle life is the replacement of LiPF6 with LiFSI or LiTFSI.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

View Article Online xLi + yIn / LixIny (2)\nIn addition to those on electrolyte additives containingmetal cations, some studies deal with the loading of lithiophilic seeds into the SEI through the introduction of small amounts of nonmetallic additives such as tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCBQ) and 2-uoropyridine (2-FP).163,164 The incorporation of TCBQ affords lithiophilic species such as the quinone lithium salt (Li2TCBQ), which possesses a high lithium-ion affinity and promotes uniform lithium plating owing to the favorable attraction of lithium-ions to the carbonyl oxygen in the Li2TCBQ structure. Similarly, lithiophilic 2-FP leads to the generation of a Lewis-basic pyridinic nitrogen-containing SEI that exhibits a high ionic conductivity and provides lithium nucleation sites. The above evidence indicates that lithiophilic SEIs, which can be constructed using both metallic and nonmetallic additives, are critical for the stable operation of LMBs. However, the excessive introduction of lithiophilic materials into electrolytes causes undesired volume expansion during repetitive cycling due to lithium-metal cation alloying, which can undermine the stable operation of LMBs.176 Consequently, more stable SEIs for the reliable operation of LMBs can be realized by introducing optimal amounts of lithiophilic materials and leveraging their synergistic effects with other interfacial modiers. This topic is discussed in more detail in Section 4.4.\n3.3.2 Self-healing mechanisms. Most studies focus on the formation of stable SEIs by introducing electrolyte additives (i.e., through mechanical barrier formation) rather than by addressing the fundamental part of lithium dendrite formation. Interestingly, the self-healing electrostatic shield (SHES) mechanism suggests a different direction for the inhibition of lithium dendrite formation.137 In the case of conventional electrolytes, a protuberant tip is created on the lithium-metal anode during the initial lithium deposition. With continuing electrodeposition, the current density at the tip increases, whichmainly results in lithium electrodeposition toward the tip to form lithium dendrites.177 The introduction of electrolyte additives containing nonlithium-cations following the SHES mechanism shows a different aspect (Fig. 9a). More specically, during the initial electrodeposition, the lithium-ions and nonlithium additive cations are absorbed onto the lithium-metal anode at a potential slightly lower than that of lithium-ion reduction and higher than that of additive reduction. At this point, as the electrolyte additive is not reductively decomposed to form an SEI, the cations of this additive are not electrodeposited on the tip but accumulate in its vicinity to form an electrostatic shield. This shield prevents the electrodeposition of lithium in the protruding area, shiing it to nearby areas and thus enabling deposition uniformity. The SHES mechanism is applicable when electrolyte additive cations have a lower standard reduction potential than lithium-ions. According to the Nernst equation, metal cations such as Cs+ and Rb+ at low concentrations (\u223c0.05 M) show lower standard reduction potentials than 1 M Li+ and are therefore not electrodeposited on the lithium-metal anode, i.e., lithium alloying does not occur.\n10008 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9996\u201310024\nConversely, cations such as Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, Ga3+, In3+, and Sn2+ cannot be applied, as their standard reduction potentials exceed that of Li+, i.e., these cations can be reduced prior to Li+. Zhang's group rst established the SHES mechanism and realized the stable operation of LMBs by introducing electrolyte additives such as CsPF6 and RbPF6.137 Furthermore, the fact that not only Cs+ and Rb+ but also K+ can follow the SHES mechanism inspires further research.178\n3.3.3 Multi-layered structures. A deep understanding of electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces is crucial for improving LMB performance, as they are one of the biggest obstacles hindering practical LMBs applications.6 Since Peled dened the electrochemically insulating and ionically conducting passivation layer, named SEI, in 1979,165 numerous studies have contributed to its fundamental understanding and exploration by diverse analytical methods. One effective strategy is to control the SEI composition and structure, as they strongly impact the cyclability of LMBs.179 However, this control is challenging to realize, as SEIs contain complex products of reductive electrolyte decomposition. To improve SEI stability in accordance with the above, researchers have examined electrolyte additives capable of forming LiF-based SEIs, which feature high mechanical stability, low lithium-ion diffusion barriers, and large band gaps. However, single-layer LiF-based SEIs composed of small LiF particles may be destroyed under extreme conditions by the extrusion of lithium dendrites formed on lithium-metal anodes aer numerous cycles.138 To maximize the functionality of LiF-based SEIs and prolong the cycle life of LMBs, one should ensure a homogeneous lithium-ion supply in the long term and delay the unwanted exposure of lithium-metal to the electrolyte through an ionically conductive outer SEI. Even when SEIs with high ionic conductivity, such as those containing Li3N, are introduced as outer SEIs, they cannot ensure the long-term stability of LMBs because of the low band gap and narrow electrochemical stability window of this nitride. To overcome these limitations, researchers have introduced the concept of multi-layer SEIs, which combine the advantages of each SEI composed of both organic and inorganic materials.169 More organized multi-layer structures are preferred, as they can promote homogeneous lithium plating and stripping and thus reduce the risk of dendrite formation (Fig. 9b).180 Interestingly, in the case of multi-layer SEI structures, the outer layer is composed of species facilitating the desolvation of lithium-ions or enhancing ionic conductivity, e.g., C\u2013F bonds,136 Li3N,21 Li polyoxymethylene,138 and polycarbonates.181 C\u2013F bonds are electron-rich and highly polar, while polycarbonates are lithiophilic and therefore enhance ion conduction through the SEI. The inner layer features components (such as LiF) that can accommodate the severe volume uctuation of the lithium-metal anode during cycling. Our recent results reveal that the introduction of uorineand nitrogen-donating electrolyte additives forming LiF and Li3N, respectively, signicantly improves the cyclability of LMBs.21 The presence ofmultilayer SEI structures on lithium-metal anodes was conrmed by XPS depth proling according to sputtering time or by XPS analysis at a variable charging voltage. Cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrated the sequential occurrence of decomposition peaks for each electrolyte component, thereby conrming the build-up of a multilayer SEI.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Therefore, materials that can realize similar effects with anion-derived SEIs are highly desired for lithium-metal anodes. In line with this necessity, researchers have designed solvents with salt-mimicking properties, such as uorosulfonamide (FSA) and N,N-dimethyltriuoromethanesulfonamide (DMTMSA), which inherit the benecial properties of FSI\u2212 and TFSI\u2212, respectively (Fig. 13a).171,193 FSA, an FSI-inspired solvent with one uorosulfonamide group and two methyl substituents, has a better LiF formation ability than FEC and generates stable lithium\u2013electrolyte interfaces. In addition, lowvalence sulfur species (S\u2212 and S2\u2212) formed by FSA decomposition can enhance cation mobility because of the high atomic polarizability of sulde ions, thus helping in forming lithium-ion conductive SEIs and reduce the overall interfacial resistance of anodes. Furthermore, DMTMSA, which possesses a TFSI\u2212 moiety, enables the operation of LijNCM811 full cells at high-voltages owing to its wide electrochemical stability window and ability to form stable SEIs. In addition to solvent-level studies, Jiang et al. presented insights into various FSI\u2212 moiety-based additives with different structural designs, revealing that nitrogen-containing sulfamoyl uorides outperform their non-nitrogenated analogs.194 In conclusion, the discovery of solvents and additives containing FSI\u2212 or TFSI\u2212 moieties suggests the possibility of expanding from conventional ethereal- and carbonate-based systems to sulfonamide-based ones while maintaining stable SEI formation, high ionic conductivity, and the wide electrochemical stability window of electrolytes.

Owing to the uorinedonating character of uorinated solvents helping to form uorine-rich SEIs, the uorination of carbonates has been suggested to mechanically and electrochemically strengthen the SEI on silicon anodes. Fluorinated EC, known as FEC, is the most successful SEI-forming additive for silicon-based anodes.10,196,197 The use of FEC, which is more prone to reductive decomposition than EC, leads to the formation of a LiF-rich SEI accommodating the large volume changes of silicon anodes with less spatial deformation.14,198 Indeed, the synergy between (i) the lower reactivity of FEC toward lithiated silicon compared to that of EC and (ii) the FEC-derived SEI alleviating electrolyte decomposition at anodes drastically enhances the cycle performance of silicon nanoparticle and silicon nanowire anodes.77,199\u2013203 Furthermore, in view of its low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital, FEC contributes to the improved anodic stability of electrolytes and enables the use of highvoltage cathodes ($4.4 V vs. Li/Li+).14,198,204\u2013206 Thus, the replacement of EC with FEC as an electrolyte solvent is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of high-energydensity batteries with silicon-based anodes and high-voltage\nSEI species (LiF, Li2CO3, Li2O, and Li3N).\nChem.

The second approach relies on the formation of anion-driven SEIs through the control of the electrolyte solvation structure.190,226 Lithium salts such as LiFSI and LiTFSI can donate uorine atoms to build LiF-based SEIs, particularly HCEs with small portions of free solvent molecules, as anions are mainly involved in the formation of a solvation sheath around lithiumions.

To address this issue, researchers have examined LHCEs that contain F-diluents capable of securing the formation of anionbased SEIs in HCEs while not interfering with the dissolution of lithium salts and reducing the overall electrolyte viscosity. The uorinated solvent can form a LiF-based SEI, which can improve CE of LMBs.228,229 Moreover, the uorinated solvent can repair the damaged LiF-based SEI during repetitive cycles.230 Furthermore, researchers consider the formation of anion-driven SEIs through the introduction of solvents that have low solubilizing power and involve more anions in the formation of a solvation sheath around lithium-ions.231 The third strategy used to construct LiFbased SEIs on lithium-metal anodes involves the use of uorine-containing electrolyte solvents or additives. FEC is commonly used to form uorinated SEIs to ensure the stable operation of LMBs. Alternatively, LiF-rich SEIs170 can be generated using electrolytes exclusively composed of uorinated solvents232 and supplements such as hexauoroisopropyl triuoromethanesulfonate (HFPTf), trimethylsilyl(uorosulfonyl)(n-nonauorobutanesulfonyl)imide (TMS-FNFSI), 2,2,2-triuoroethyl triuoroacetate (TFE), 2-uoropyridine (2-FP), diuoroethylene carbonate (DFEC), 2,2,2-triuoroacetate (TFA), and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexauoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFPM).233\u2013237 Despite the advantages of uorinated solvents and salts, their widespread use for cell operation under practical conditions is hindered by several problems238 such as cost-effectiveness, scalability for large-scale production, stability during long-duration storage, environmental concerns, and the inherently high density of uorinated solvents.239,240 Fluorinated salts and solvents are expensive and currently unsuitable for mass production. In the LijLiNixCoyMnzO2 (x + y + z= 1) full cell design for high-energy-density (high-capacity cathode: 4 mA h cm\u22122, thin lithium foil: 8 mA h cm\u22122, and lean amount of electrolyte: 2.4 g A h\u22121), the electrolyte accounts for 23.6% of the system weight and thus has the second-highest relative content aer the cathode (49.2%).241 Additionally, the electrolyte cost accounts for \u223c15% of the total battery cost.2 In general, electrolytes with a normal concentration of 1\u20131.5 M are composed of 12.6 wt% lithium salt, 0\u201310 wt% electrolyte additive, and 80\u201385 wt% solvent (Fig. 14b).242 This implies that the cost of lithium salt and electrolyte solvent are the main factors determining electrolyte cost. In HCEs (>4 M), the expensive lithium salt has a content of >70 wt%, signicantly increasing electrolyte cost and making electrolyte use not economically feasible (Fig. 14b).243 Furthermore, the various reported ethereal uorinated solvents such as TTE, BTFE, and tris(2,2,2-triuoroethyl)orthoformate (TFEO) are relatively expensive and have a high density of \u223c1.5 g cm\u22123, which may cause a small volume of the electrolyte to be injected in practical full cell fabrication and thus lead to problems such as poor separator wetting and performance degradation due to the lack of electrolyte to be evenly spread across the electrode surfaces and separator micropores (Fig. 14c and d and Table S3\u2020).244 Unlike high-density uorinated solvents such as TTE and BTFE, monouoride bis(2-uoroethyl) ether (BFE) and m-\n10014 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9996\u201310024\nuorotoluene (mFT) canminimize the issue of electrolyte wetting owing to their relatively low-densities of 0.98 and 0.99 g cm\u22123, respectively, while retaining the advantages of uorine-enriched SEI formation on the anode (Fig. 14e).175,184 Moreover, currently reported uorinated ethers are expensive and not commercially available, and their large-scale production is hindered by the lack of correspondingly optimized synthetic methods.245 As the price of conventional carbonate-based solvents has decreased aer decades of synthesis optimization for mass production, the price of various recently developed uorinated solvents could also decrease aer the optimization of the production process for electrolyte design.2 However, at present, cost-competitiveness is a key concern that cannot be negated in electrolyte design. Environmental issues also need to be considered.246,247 In the case of uorinated solvents, the solvent itself is rich in uorine atoms, which substitute hydrogen atoms, and the thus generated stable C\u2013F bonds are difficult to degrade naturally. Thus, C\u2013F bondcontaining per and polyuoroalkyl substances (PFASs) increase the burden on the environment and pose problems such as global warming.248,249 These solvents have also been reported to exhibit toxic effects on human health and the environment, which has raised concerns about their safety. The stability of uorinated solvents during long-term storage and battery operation is yet another concern, as they can undergo decomposition and release toxic gases over time.239 Finally, uorinated solvents used as diluents weaken the polarity of the solvating group interacting with lithium-ions because of the electronwithdrawing nature of the \u2013F group, allowing it to function as a diluent that does not dissociate the salt.2,250 Therefore, if uorinated solvents are used alone, the dissociation ability of lithium salts decreases, which can limit the practical level of electrolyte design by decreasing ionic conductivity and thus causing high ohmic polarization. Hence, even though the formation of a stable LiF-rich SEI may improve the long-term interfacial stability of lithium-metal anodes and LMB performance, research on nonuorinated salts and solvents should also be carried out to facilitate the practical utilization of the developed electrolytes."

As a result, dead lithium provokes the degradation of battery performance. Advanced articial SEI structures and SEI-regulating electrolyte additives have been proposed to improve the performance of LMBs.174,254 However, SEIs are susceptible to breaking because of the severe volume uctuation during lithium plating and stripping, which causes the exposure of fresh lithium to the electrolyte and the generation of new SEI species. This recurring breakage and restoration of the SEI limits its durability. Furthermore, the relationship between a defunct SEI and isolated lithium-metal debris remains uncertain, making it challenging to demonstrate the inhibition of dead lithium formation to prevent battery failure. Therefore, research on recovering dead lithium is crucial for improving the long-term cyclability and safety of LMBs. A triiodide/iodide (I3\n\u2212/I\u2212) redox couple can be utilized to reactivate inactive lithium (Fig. 13c).173 The reduction of I3 \u2212 leads to the conversion of inactive lithium into soluble LiI, while the oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode restores lithium-ions in the cathode from the inactive lithium. The I3 \u2212 regenerated through oxidation further drives redox reactions. The reactions involved in the above processes are presented below.\nReactions on the lithium-metal anode:173\n3Li2O + 3I3 \u2212 / 6Li+ + 8I\u2212 + IO3 \u2212 (3)\n6Li + IO3 \u2212 / I\u2212 + 3Li2O (4)\n2Li + I3 \u2212 / 2Li+ + 3I\u2212 (5)\nThe I3 \u2212 additive removes inactive lithium sources from the SEI, which results in the formation of soluble LiI and IO3 \u2212 species (eqn (3)). LiIO3 can be reduced by lithium to form Li2O and LiI (eqn (4)). The deposited Li2O becomes part of the healthy SEI on the lithium-metal anode. The oxygen from the Li2O in the defunct SEI is transported to reconstruct the SEI on the lithium-metal via a resolvable LiIO3-based oxygen carriage medium. Additionally, I3\n\u2212 reacts with the lithium debris to produce LiI (eqn (5)).

The above rejuvenation mechanism has been extensively exploited to enhance the longterm reversibility of lithium-metal anodes.173,256,257 In addition, SEI stability can be improved by forming a Li3N-rich SEI through the rejuvenation of Li2O, which is unavoidably generated by the decomposition of LiNO3 (LiNO3 + 8Li\n+ + 8e\u2212 / Li3N + 3Li2O).103,258 This allows the formation of SEIs with superb ionic conductivity due to the increased content of highly ionconductive Li3N (\u223c10\u22123 S cm\u22121) and enables epitaxy-like planar lithium deposition on lithium-metal anodes, thereby enhancing SEI stability."

Organic SEI species generated by the reductive decomposition of solvent molecules as promoters forming a primary solvation sheath in dilute electrolytes may facilitate the spatial relaxation of SEIs on anodes. However, at high-areal-capacities leading to large volume changes of silicon and lithium-metal anodes, mechanically fragile organic SEI species fail to prevent the direct contact of electrolytes with anodes, which results in the further consumption of electrolytes and the deactivation of anode materials covered with electrically resistive SEI species.

Hence, these species hinder the decomposition of EC by minimizing the probability of its direct contact with the anode during charging and enabling the generation of inorganic-rich SEIs.213,260 Additionally, the replacement of EC with a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) (1 : 1, v/v) resulted in the formation of a LiF-rich SEI on the silicon anode in an electrolyte containing 2 M LiPF6.261 The latter salt formed CIPs and AGGs via Li+\u2013PF6\n\u2212 aggregation and thus experienced a reduction potential increase. Importantly, as THF and MTHF have lower reduction potentials than Li+\u2013PF6 \u2212 aggregates, they are stable in electrolytes during cycling. The formation of LiF by the decomposition of PF6\n\u2212 anions effectively extended the lifespan of silicon anodes at an arealcapacity of 2.5 mA h cm\u22122. Similarly, the formation of LiF by FSI\u2212 and TFSI\u2212 decomposition in CIPs and AGGs enhances the interfacial properties of lithium-metal anodes. As the participation of anions in the solvation structure at elevated salt concentrations in electrolytes creates anion-derived SEIs, the structural optimization of anions can maximize the quality of SEIs comprising electrochemically stable inorganic species. HCEs commonly contain polar solvents with high dielectric constants and DNs sufficient to achieve high salt concentrations (>3 M) without solid precipitation. HCEs may be referred to as solvate ionic liquids (SILs) \u2013 a new class of ionic liquids consisting of a coordinating solvent and salt and possessing\n10016 | Chem.

These facilitate the future application of SILs as next-generation lithium battery electrolytes. At such high salt concentrations, anions start to enter the primary solvation sheath of lithiumions and the formation of CIPs and AGGs becomes more feasible. CIPs and AGGs decrease the proportion of free solvent molecules and facilitate the generation of an inner Helmholtz layer on the lithium-metal surface (Fig. 15). Instead of a solventderived SEI, an anion-derived inorganic SEI capable of enduring the drastic volumetric stress due to the lithiation and delithiation of silicon and lithium-metal anodes is constructed. However, the practical usage of HCEs is hindered by their high viscosity, poor wettability, and high cost. The addition of uorinated solvents to HCEs affords less viscous electrolytes denoted as LHCEs. These uorinated solvents are miscible with strongly solvating solvents but do not enter the primary solvation sheath. In particular, since the triuoromethyl group (CF3) is a functional group with strong electron substituents, it can weaken the interaction between lithium-ions and uorinated solvent molecules.240 In thismanner, uorinated solvents reduce electrolyte viscosity by enhancing themutual interaction between solvent\u2013lithium-ion complexes while preserving the overall\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

To make strain-adaptable and longlasting SEIs feasible, we envision a platform that seamlessly integrates the design of cheap and ubiquitous electrolytes, electrolyte formulation, and accurate in-depth analysis for the realization of high-performance silicon and lithium-metal anodes. The regulation of the chemical environment of SEIs at anodeelectrolyte interfaces is believed to enable the realization of stable-cycling-performance batteries with silicon and lithiummetal anodes. The combined use of two or three species such as high-modulus LiF, lithiophilicmaterials, and spatially deformable organic species for homogeneous distribution in single-layer and hierarchical (bi- or multilayer) structures can meet the versatile specications for extending the health of batteries over wide temperature ranges, which is not readily attained using monocomponent SEIs. Moreover, the desirable target SEI species should maintain their interconnections for satisfactory mechanical integrity to endure the volume uctuation of silicon and lithium-metal anodes upon lithiation and delithiation. Although anion-derived or solvent-derived SEIs can enhance anode performance, the consumption of salt anions and solvents precludes the preservation of initial lithium-ion solvation structures driven by the competitive coordination of solvents and anions to lithiumcations during cycling (Fig. 16). In this regard, the incorporation of sacricial interface modiers, which mitigate the unnecessary consumption of electrolyte solvents and salts ensuring ion conduction in cells, can be a practical option. Although the developed additives enable the creation of stable SEIs on anodes, side effects such as solvation structure change and solvent/salt decomposition should be thoroughly examined prior to application to batteries. Another important aspect of additive development is the establishment of optimal charging protocols (C-rates, temperatures, and pulse voltage rise) for the formation of the desired SEIs, as the charging protocol greatly inuences the decomposition pathways of additives with different reduction kinetics and target SEI components may not be created. More importantly, the deep understanding of the functions of existing\n10018 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9996\u201310024\nmaterials through in situ and ex situ analyses should pave the way for the discovery of new research directions in the eld of liquid electrolytes for silicon and lithium-metal anodes. The optimized design of interface modiers along with solvents and salts providing elements or motifs for the creation of stable SEIs will move silicon and lithium-metal anodes closer to industrial applications, especially considering minimal environmental issues, cost-effectiveness (especially <$78 kg\u22121 for additives), and practical conditions such as the high mass loading ($3\u2013 4 mA h cm\u22122) of silicon and the use of thinner lithium metal (anode-to-cathode capacity ratio #2) to achieve high-energydensity batteries (Fig. 16). Furthermore, to be applicable to commercial lithium rechargeable batteries, the developed electrolyte materials should have a reasonably low density of <1.4 g cm\u22123 (to ensure that electrolyte injection during battery manufacturing does not cause electrolyte wetting-related problems) and long-term storage stability (low melting point of <\u221220 \u00b0 C and a high boiling point of >100 \u00b0C) with less gas evolution over a wide temperature range of \u221240\u201380 \u00b0C. Despite the multitude of available electrolyte systems, common reference electrolytes for lithium-metal anodes meeting all industrial requirements remain unknown. If LiFSI is employed as the main salt, moderate salt concentrations should be considered to mitigate aluminum corrosion upon cell operation, especially at elevated temperatures or high voltages. In the case of silicon-containing anodes, FEC and FEC + VC combinations are still considered interface modiers, and their content is manipulated by the amount of silicon in the LIB anode, as the few additives electrochemically outperforming FEC and VC are overly costly for commercial applications. A deep understanding of the developed SEIs will offer new insights into the establishment of liquid electrolyte chemistry to realize longlasting batteries with silicon or lithium-metal anodes without any signicant increase in cost."
