 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar study on the sustainability of LKMAs in other regions of Indonesia to compare results. Since this study was only done in Kendal Regency, expanding the research to other areas could provide more generalizable findings. 

2. Do a deeper analysis on what specific managerial, financial, and capacity building interventions could improve the sustainability of LKMAs. The paper mentions training for managers could help but more specifics could be explored.

3. Research the social and economic impacts of LKMAs on smallholder farmers and rural communities, such as effects on income, productivity, food security, etc. This could demonstrate the broader value of these microfinance institutions.

4. Study potential linkages between LKMAs and formal financial institutions, like banks, to improve access to capital. The paper mentions this as an area for growth so researching facilitators and barriers could be useful.

5. Conduct a comparative analysis on the sustainability of different microfinance models (LKMAs, credit unions, village banks, etc.) to see which institutional structures and practices are most effective. Lessons could be drawn to improve microfinance policies.
