    "abstractText": "Combined cisplatin\u2013gemcitabine treatment causes rapid resistance development in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. The present study investigated the potential of the natural isothiocyanates (ITCs) allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), butyl-isothiocyanate (BITC), and phenylethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) to suppress growth and proliferation of gemcitabineand cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells lines. Sensitive and gemcitabineand cisplatin-resistant RT112, T24, and TCCSUP cells were treated with the ITCs, and tumor cell growth, proliferation, and clone formation were evaluated. Apoptosis induction and cell cycle progression were investigated as well. The molecular mode of action was investigated by evaluating cell cycle-regulating proteins (cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins A and B) and the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT signaling pathway. The ITCs significantly inhibited growth, proliferation and clone formation of all tumor cell lines (sensitive and resistant). Cells were arrested in the G2/M phase, independent of the type of resistance. Alterations of both the CDK\u2013cyclin axis and the Akt\u2013mTOR signaling pathway were observed in AITC-treated T24 cells with minor effects on apoptosis induction. In contrast, AITC de-activated Akt\u2013mTOR signaling and induced apoptosis in RT112 cells, with only minor effects on CDK expression. It is concluded that AITC, BITC, and PEITC exert tumor-suppressive properties on cisplatinand gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cells, whereby the molecular action may differ among the cell lines. The integration of these ITCs into the gemcitabine-/cisplatin-based treatment regimen might optimize bladder cancer therapy.",

The standard care for advanced and/or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is based on the cytotoxic protocols MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) or GC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) [2]. Unfortunately, despite a high initial response rate, resistance rapidly develops by reactivation of intracellular growth signaling pathways. The median survival rate of patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy is limited to 14 months [3]. Meanwhile, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been established targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or the programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved the use of ICIs for second-line treatment after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy (atezolizumab,\nInt.

Still, the clinical results are not as successful as has been expected. Of note, utilization of pembrolizumab or atezolizumab in the second-line treatment was associated with an overall response rate of 15\u201320% and progression-free survival of slightly more than 2 months in the landmark IMvigor210 and Keynote 045 trials (PMID: 33421822) [4,5]. Dissatisfaction with the conventional tumor treatment along with severe side effects under MVAC/GC or ICIs has driven many cancer patients to seek complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). Worldwide, approximately 50% of cancer patients are reported to use CAM, whereby variations should be considered, depending on the tumor entity, patient socio-demographics and country [6]. Of several options, intake of plant extracts or plant-derived compounds is mostly favored with a percentage application rate of nearly 50% [7,8]. Indeed, clinical studies have provided evidence that the integration of plantderived natural drugs into the conventional anti-tumor protocol may improve the efficacy of the systemic bladder cancer treatment [9,10]. The present study deals with the impact of the natural isothiocyanates (ITCs) allylisothiocyanate (AITC), benzyl-isothiocyanate (BITC), and phenethyl-isothiocyanate (PEITC) on the growth and proliferation properties of cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cell lines. ITCs are abundant in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, gardencress, watercress and mustard and derived from sulfur-containing glucosinolates after enzymatic hydrolysis (Figure 1) [11]. BITC is predominantly found in nasturtium, whereas AITC and PEITC are typical ITCs found in horseradish root. Evidence has already been provided that AITC and BITC suppress bladder cancer growth and enhance apoptosis in vitro. Both compounds reduced the size of bladder tumors and prevented oncogenesis in a rat model as well. PEITC is also assumed to play critical roles in preventing the initiation step of carcinogenesis and inhibiting tumor progression. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms have not been clearly defined [12]. There are also no publications available dealing with the influence of the ITCs on cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "In vivo and in vitro data have already demonstrated that ITCs may suppress oncogenesis and tumor progression [12]. There is also epidemiological evidence that ITCs may diminish the risk of bladder cancer recurrence [13]. However, information about AITC, BITC and PEITC is sparse, and no reports are available dealing with the influence of these compounds on drug-resistant bladder cancer. Evidence is presented here that AITC, BITC, and PEITC block growth and proliferation of drug-sensitive as well as of cisplatinand gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cell lines. Based on dose\u2013response-analyses (2.5\u201312.5 \u00b5M BITC or PEITC, 20\u2013140 \u00b5M AITC), working concentration was set to 7.5 \u00b5M BITC or PEITC, and to 20\u201340 \u00b5M AITC. Similar dosing schedules have been used by others with slight modifications depending of the cell line used. Lin et al. pointed to a significant loss of the number of RT4, 5637, HT1376, and HT1197 bladder cancer cells when treated with BITC at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M [14]. A dosage of 15\u201330 \u00b5M BITC or PEITC was necessary to induce damage of UMUC3 bladder cancer cells [15], whereas T24 cell proliferation was suppressed already at 2\u20135 \u00b5M PEITC [16]. AITC at concentrations of >60 \u00b5M has been noted to block growth and proliferation of RT4 and T24 cells [17,18]. UMUC3 cells, however, responded to a lower dosage of 15 \u00b5M AITC in terms of cell growth inhibition [19]. We assume that AITC, BITC and PEITC are all characterized by tumor-suppressive properties, whereby the tumor cells\u2019 sensitivity may depend on the tumor cell subline. From a clinical viewpoint, bladder cancer patients may differentially benefit from ITC consumption. Independent on this, BITC and PEITC were superior to AITC in the present investigation, since growth-blocking effects had been evoked at low concentrations, whereas AITC had to be applied at higher dosages. Interestingly, comparative analysis of AITC, BITC, and PEITC on apoptosis induction revealed the strongest potency of BITC and PEITC [15]. The authors of this study assumed that the lipophilicity represents at least one parameter defining the activity of the drugs. In this context, BITC and PEITC are rather hydrophobic, whereas AITC is more water-soluble. This is important as a high lipid solubility (depending on the alkyl carbon chain of the ITCs) correlates with the transmembranous transport of the molecule into the tumor cell. Quite importantly, AITC, BITC, and PEITC acted not only on drug-sensitive cells but also on cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant sublines. The response of the resistant tumor cell lines was similar to the one of the sensitive cells, highlighting the therapeutic potential of these ITCs as integrative components in a GC-based regimen. The assumption is still hypothetical and, certainly, further studies are required to verify it. However, 5\u201310 \u00b5M BITC or 20\u201340 \u00b5M AITC have already been documented to induce apoptosis and to inhibit proliferation of human cisplatin-resistant oral cancer cells [20,21], and PEITC has been proven to reverse cisplatin-resistance in cervical cancer cells at low concentrations of 1\u20132 \u00b5M [22]. Apoptosis induction might be one mechanism how the ITCs have reduced tumor cell growth. In good accordance, BITC elevated cytotoxicity and apoptosis of a panel of bladder cancer cell lines [14]. BITC, AITC, and PEITC all increased apoptosis and necrosis rates in RT4 and T24 cells [15,18]. PEITC has also been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in adriamycin-resistant bladder cancer cells [16], underlining the relevance of ITCs as a therapeutic strategy to fight drug resistance in bladder cancer. The apoptotic machinery has not been further evaluated in the present investigation. Based on S\u00e1vio and coworkers, the mechanism of action of BITC, AITC, and PEITC on apoptotic pathways may differ among several bladder cancer cell lines [17]. Ongoing experiments should, therefore, deal with the fine-tuned action of these ITCs on the apoptotic cascade. Aside from apoptosis induction, ITCs caused a prominent accumulation of RT112 and T24 cells in G2/M, accompanied by a loss of G0/G1-phase cells. The effect was similar in all cell lines and the respective resistant sublines, opening the question whether this mechanism might be a general one. Indeed, G2/M-phase arrest in presence of AITC has been observed in T24 [18] and UMUC3 cell cultures by others [19]. G2/M-phase arrest\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10996 13 of 18\nhas also found in cell cultures from further tumor entities treated with BITC, AITC, or PEITC [23\u201325]. Presumably, G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest observed here might be mainly responsible for the loss of bladder cancer cell growth and proliferation resulting from ITC treatment. However, BITC has also been reported to induce G1 cell cycle arrest in the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model [26] and glioblastoma multiforme cells [27]. Obviously, the present results do not allow to exclude additional functions of ITCs on cell cycle progression. In fact, the Western blot data document different alterations of cell cycle regulating proteins in RT112 and T24 cells when exposed to the ITCs. Furthermore, response depended also on the particular ITC used. Overall, CDKs and cyclins were considerably suppressed in T24 cells (being aware of few exceptions), whereas only CDKs (partially) but not cyclins were suppressed in RT112 cells. AITC (but not BITC and PEITC) potently reduced Akt/pAkt and Raptor/pRaptor in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant T24 and RT112 cells. On the other hand, pRictor was elevated in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant T24 cells by AITC, whereas this mechanism was only true in the drugresistant RT112 cells. Obviously, T24 are more sensitive to AITC treatment than RT112. This difference is also reflected by the cell growth assay (Figure 3), where the maximum tolerable AITC dosage was 70 \u00b5M in T24 but 140 \u00b5M in RT112 cell cultures. Attention should also be laid on the apoptosis assay. AITC caused strong elevation of apoptotic RT112 cells but a minor or no (gemcitabine-resistance) increase in T24 cell cultures. It is assumed that AITC exerts different modes of action on the tumor cells. Apoptosis induction may compensate minor effects on cell cycle protein alterations in RT112 cells, whereas down-regulation of cell cycle related pathways may compensate minor effects on apoptosis induction in T24 cells. This is still hypothetical; however, a similar scenario has recently been noted. AITC treatment reduced cell growth of both RT4 and T24 cells, albeit by a different mechanism. Cell death by apoptosis was the prominent underlying mechanism in RT4 cells, whereas blocking of cell cycle regulating proteins was the major action of AITC in T24 cells [17]. pAkt was reduced by all ITCs in the cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant tumor cells (not evaluated in BITC-treated T24 cells). This is notable, since genetic alterations within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway have been noted in 42% of bladder cancer cases [28]. The PI3K-Akt pathway is closely involved in tumor development and is discussed to be a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target in bladder cancer [29]. Recent analysis of tumor samples from TCGA databases revealed the PI3K/Akt pathway to be significantly related to metastatic bladder cancer [30]. The finding that pAkt was diminished in the resistant tumor cells by the ITCs is clinically relevant. Inactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway has just been shown to lower the risk of gemcitabine [31,32] and cisplatin resistance [33,34]. A clinical trial with the chemical Akt\u2013mTOR inhibitor buparlisip has been started in this context, demonstrating modest activity in patients with platinum-resistant metastatic bladder cancer. Unfortunately, treatment with buparlisip was accompanied by severe toxicity [35]. The natural ITCs AITC, BITC, and PEITC distinctly reduced Akt phosphorylation in the in vitro model. In contrast to buparlisip or to ITC-related synthetic analogues, which were not qualified for clinical trials [36], they all have no (or low) toxicity in common. It might, therefore, be worthwhile to open clinical studies on bladder cancer patients integrating these plant-derived compounds into the GC-schedule. The elevation of pRictor seen particularly in the drug-resistant RT112 and AITCtreated T24 cells requires final attention. Application of the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid to several prostate cancer cell lines down-regulated pRaptor but simultaneously up-regulated pRictor [37,38]. A recent investigation on hepatocellular carcinoma cells demonstrated that blockade of Akt enhanced phosphorylation of Rictor [39]. The relevance of this mechanism is not yet clear. It is to be emphasized Raptor and Rictor drive different cellular functions. Raptor is involved in the regulation of bladder cancer growth and proliferation, whereas Rictor serves as the main driving force of bladder cancer cell migration and invasion [40]. Since cell growth and proliferation of T24, RT112, and TCCSUP were all blocked by the ITCs,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10996 14 of 18\nit seems not to be likely that enhancement of pRictor reflects a tumor escape phenomenon. However, it cannot be ruled out that activation of Rictor might be associated with an increased invasion behavior of the bladder cancer cells. It is mandatory to concentrate on this important issue in future experiments. Concerning the cisplatin and gemcitabine non-responsiveness, we cannot finally assess to which extent the Akt\u2013mTOR pathway and the cyclin\u2013CDK axis might be involved in the process of resistance development. Akt\u2013mTOR pathway activation has recently been shown to be associated with cisplatin-resistance in urothelial carcinoma cells, and suppression of it restored sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo [34]. Akt\u2013mTOR signaling has also been suggested to be involved in the acquisition of gemcitabin resistance [41]. Furthermore, network analysis of significantly altered proteins in bladder cancer revealed CDK2 as one central regulator mediating cisplatin resistance [42], with the consequence that targeting the CDK\u2013cyclin axis may restore cisplatin-sensitivity [43]. It seems likely that the protein panel investigated here contributes to resistance acquisition. It should be explored next, whether BITC, AITC and/or PEITC may re-sensitize the bladder cancer cells to cisplatin and/or gemcitabine treatment."

The in vitro data presented here point to the distinct tumorsuppressive properties of AITC, BITC, and PEITC in terms of growth and proliferation blockade. Thus, the therapeutic integration of an AITC/BITC/PEITC cocktail into the current bladder cancer treatment should be considered as a hopeful strategy to enhance patient outcome. The results point to a different molecular action of the compounds. This may offer an advantage to synthetic drugs, since targeting several molecules may prevent rapid therapeutic resistance. Further investigations are however necessary to explore the full potential of the ITCs, with particular emphasis on resistance development.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms231910996/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.A.B.; investigation, J.R., S.M., T.G., M.S., S.E.K., N.M., J.M., H.X. and J.C.; methodology, R.A.B. and J.C.; project administration, R.A.B., I.T. and A.T.; supervision, F.K.-H.C., I.T., A.H. and R.A.B.; funding acquisition, R.A.B.; writing\u2014original draft, I.T., A.T. and R.A.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.T., A.T., A.H. and R.A.B.
