CB often arises from impaired communication or problem solving skills.\nIt is often met with coercive measure due to a lack of alternative strategies\non the part of the caregiver, while it also impacts on the caregivers due to\nthe exposure to physical harm and high levels of stress. Within the ProVIA\nproject we developed a smartphone-based tool for caregivers of children with\nIDD and/or ASD to prevent and modify CB. The ProVIA app systematically\nhelps caregivers to identify specific causes of CB and provides individualised\npractical guidance to prevent CB and consecutive coercive measures, thus\naiming to improve the health and well-being of the children and caregivers.\nMethods: In this uncontrolled open trial we will enrol N = 25 caregivers of\nchildren aged 3\u201311 years with a diagnosis of IDD and/or ASD. Participants\nwill use the ProVIA-Kids app for 8 weeks. During the intervention phase,\nparticipants will conduct behaviour analyses after each instance of CB. The\napp will summarise the identified putative causes for the CB in each situation,\nand provide recommendations regarding the handling and prevention of\nCB. Furthermore, the app will aggregate data from all available behaviour\nanalyses and identify the most relevant (i.e., most frequently reported) risk\nfactors. Measurement points are at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1)\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nand 12 weeks after the end of the intervention (follow-up; T2). The primary\noutcome is the absolute change in parental stress (EBI total scale) between T0\nand T1. Further aspects of interest are changes in CB severity and frequency,\ncaregiver mood, satisfaction with the parenting role (EFB-K total scale) and\nexperienced parenting competence (FKE total scale). Pre-post comparisons\nwill be analysed with paired sample t-tests.\nDiscussion: ProVIA is pioneering structured behaviour analysis via\nsmartphone, assessing predefined causes of CB and providing feedback\nand recommendations. If this approach proves successful, the ProVIA-Kids\napp will be a valuable tool for caregivers to prevent CB and improve their own\nas well as the children\u2019s quality of life.\nTrial registration: The study is registered at https://www.drks.de/drks_web/\nnavigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_IDDRKS00029039 (registered\nMay 31, 2022).\nKEYWORDS\nautism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, challenging behaviour, behaviour analysis, mental health application, cognitive behaviour therapy, parent training, parental stress"

            "text": "Approximately 1% of the population has an intellectual and developmental disability (IDD; IQ < 70). Children and adolescents with IDD represent a high-risk clientele for somatic and psychiatric disorders that interact, cause complex multiple disabilities, and result in significant challenges for medical, psychotherapeutic, and educational care (H\u00e4\u00dfler et al., 2014). Especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly comorbid with IDD. Among children with ASD, approximately 45% also have a diagnosis of IDD. (Saemundsen et al., 2013). ASD has a overall prevalence of 0.9\u20131.1% (AWMF, 2016) and core symptoms comprise difficulties in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication as well as limited, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. Symptoms manifest in early childhood and often confer lifelong impairment (Baxter et al., 2014). Like IDD, ASD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder according to the DSM5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). About 52% of children with IDD show challenging behaviour (CB). Common manifestations of CB are e.g., auto-aggression, aggression against others or directed at objects, or pervasive refusal (Kahng et al., 2002; McClintock et al., 2003; Dworschak et al., 2016). The risk for auto-aggression and aggression toward others increases by 31% when IDD is accompanied by comorbid ASD (Tsiouris et al., 2011).\nThere is significant overlap in the risk factors of CB between children with IDD and children with ASD (NICE, 2013, 2015; H\u00e4\u00dfler et al., 2014). Risk factors are e.g., the inability to communicate emotional states and needs in general (Mancil,\n2006; Dominick et al., 2007; Hartley et al., 2008; Gotham et al., 2013; Greenlee et al., 2016), the presence of ADHD symptoms or sleep disturbances (Chen et al., 2017), comorbid psychiatric symptoms (Hayes et al., 2011; Moss et al., 2018) and environmental influences (e.g., sensory stimuli, cognitive and/or social overload or restrictions of repetitive or stereotyped behaviour) (Reese et al., 2005)."

            "heading": "Effects of CB on caregivers",
            "text": "Caregivers of children with ASD and/or IDD experience high levels of stress, especially due to CB. A recent representative survey in residential facilities for young people with IDD in Bavaria, Germany, showed that CB in children and adolescents with IDD is significantly associated with employee stress and the use of coercive measures (Geissler et al., 2021a). Giovagnoli and colleagues were able to show that parental stress was less related to the severity of ASD core symptoms and more related to the extent of certain challenging behaviours (emotional reactiveness, aggression) (Giovagnoli et al., 2015). Expansive behaviour further contributed to a deterioration of the parent-child relationship (Zaidman-Zait et al., 2018). The extent to which parents are burdened by the child\u2019s behaviour results on the one hand from child variables (e.g., hyperactivity/distractibility, adaptability, and mood), but on the other hand is also influenced by parent variables (e.g., social isolation, quality of relationship with or attachment to the child, depressiveness, limitations on own physical and mental functioning, degree of acceptance of the\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nchild\u2019s characteristics, and extent of positive reinforcement experienced) (Baker et al., 2005; Glidden et al., 2006; Paczkowski and Baker, 2008; van der Veek et al., 2009; MacDonald et al., 2010).\nAddressing risk factors for challenging behavior\nInterventions based on standardised behaviour analyses are an effective tool for identifying the causes of CB and for modifying the behaviour (Dunlap and Fox, 2011; NICE, 2015). A systematic review by MacDonald and McGill concludes that training professionals in dealing with CB via behaviour analytic techniques (Positive Behaviour Support) can reduce the frequency of CB (MacDonald and McGill, 2013). Parents can also be successfully instructed to use behaviour therapy-based interventions with children with ASD (Diggle et al., 2003; Postorino et al., 2017). Randomisedcontrolled trials show efficacy of the parent-training program Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) for children with IDD in terms of the child\u2019s CB, parental competence and satisfaction and parental relationship (Plant and Sanders, 2007; Tellegen and Sanders, 2013). Ruane and Carr (2019) reported metaanalytic effects for SSTP on child behaviour (researcher observed, d = 0.51) and child problems (parent report, d = 0.46) as well as on parenting style (d = 0.70), parenting satisfaction and self-efficacy (d = 0.44), parental adjustment (d = 0.27) and parental relationship (d = 0.26) (Ruane and Carr, 2019).\nA meta-analysis found evidence that behavioural parent training also has positive secondary effects on parents\u2019 psychological well-being (Singer et al., 2007). Conversely, trainings explicitly targeting parental mental health may also have a positive impact on children\u2019s behaviour. In a randomised controlled study by Neece (2014), N = 46 parents of children with developmental disorders (aged 2.5\u2013 5 years) showing behavioural problems underwent 8 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). The authors found that compared to the control group, the MBSR group showed greater improvements in terms of parental stress, depression and life satisfaction. Furthermore, the children, who were not part of the intervention, also improved in terms of attention and hyperactivity problems (Neece, 2014). Lewallen and Neece (2015) conducted a study on a similar cohort (parents of N = 24 children with developmental disorders aged 2.5\u20135 years showing behavioural problems). The authors could show that in addition to improvements in the parent-child relationship (relationship frustration, parenting confidence), the intervention also had an effect on the children\u2019s behaviour in terms of improved selfcontrol (parent and teacher rating) as well as cooperation (teacher rating) (Lewallen and Neece, 2015). Furthermore,\ncognitive-behavioural interventions for parents of children with developmental disorders including problem solving, stress management, and coping with difficult emotions confer improvements in terms of depressiveness, quality of life, and stress compared to a control group (Singer et al., 1988; Nixon and Singer, 1993; Wong and Poon, 2010; Feinberg et al., 2014). To sum up, research has shown that training parents improves CB in children and contributes to parent\u2019s wellbeing, which in turn has positive effects on the children."

            "text": "In the reality of care, however, too few resources are available to parents and caregivers. According to health insurance data, children and adolescents with ASD (0\u2013 17 years) are most frequently treated by a specialist in paediatrics and adolescent medicine. However, child and adolescent psychiatry topics are underrepresented in medical degree courses (Warnke, 2015). Therefore, it is unlikely that parents receive adequate training in dealing with CB from those providers. Only a small proportion of patients receive psychotherapeutic treatment (6%) (Bachmann and Hoffmann, 2015). In a German interview study, parents of children with ASD were largely satisfied with therapeutic services for their children, but would like to see more counselling and support services for parents (Jungbauer and Meye, 2008). Hence, there is a need for evidencebased low-threshold interventions for caregivers to reduce dependency on external resources. In this respect, MHAs are a promising option."

            "heading": "Mental health applications",
            "text": "In their systematic review, Miralles and colleagues provide an overview of evidence-based MHAs (Miralles et al., 2020). The number of mental health apps has increased rapidly in recent years. The majority of apps are developed by private companies and are either not scientifically evaluated or their effectiveness has not been proven (Larsen et al., 2016). The majority of evidence-based apps are aimed at patients with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, psychosis, trauma and stress-related disorders, suicidal behaviour and non-suicidal self-injury, obsessive-compulsive disorders and regulatory disorders. The only two apps developed for ASD with peer-reviewed publications teach children everyday skills using flashcards [iCanLearn; (Zaffke et al., 2014)] or support them in coping with everyday life [LifePal; (Skillen et al., 2016)]. However, these apps were aimed at ASD patients with a high level of functioning who can use the app independently. ProVIA-Kids was developed for caregivers of children with\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nASD who are more severely impaired (e.g., non-verbal, with cognitive impairment and with severe behavioural problems) and who are often excluded from trials and overlooked in the development of new interventions. Furthermore, there are no MHAs for caregivers with the aim of improving CB in children. However, there is some evidence regarding the efficacy of self-directed interventions in reducing child problem behaviour (Markie-Dadds and Sanders, 2006; Sanders et al., 2007). In terms of parental outcomes, mental health apps can be an effective tool for the reduction of depressive symptoms in adults as part of a multimodal treatment plan [metaanalysis by Firth et al. (2017); 18 RCTs; g = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.24\u20130.52, p < 0.001)] and as standalone intervention [metaanalysis by (Weisel et al., 2019); 6 RCTs; Hedges\u2019 g = 0.33, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I2 = 59%] mostly via behavioural activation. Hence it is possible for self-directed parent interventions to have an effect on both child behaviour and parental well-being. ProVia-Kids is to the best of our knowledge the first app to offer content for children with ASD and/or IDD, which adresses caregivers in the family instead of the affected persons or mental health providers."

Risk factors for CB are screened via a behaviour analysis algorithm. Based on the information entered by caregivers, the app provides detailed psychoeducational information and appropriate recommendations for action for each situation. In addition, a strong focus is placed on strengthening the caregivers\u2019 resources in order to reduce stress and thereby exert a positive secondary effect on the child\u2019s behaviour. For patient safety, the app directs caregivers to specialised settings for issues that require more extensive care.\nTo our knowledge, ProVIA-Kids is the first attempt to automate behaviour analysis to the extent that users receive feedback on individual risk factors of CB and are recommended matching interventions.\nSince the focus of this study is the evaluation of the general suitability of an app-based intervention for caregivers, we defined parental stress as the primary clinical outcome: we expect to see improvements due to a better understanding of the underlying causes of the CB and increased self-efficacy. Considering the short intervention period of 8 weeks, we don\u2019t expect big changes in the children\u2019s (challenging) behaviour. However, in order to avoid overlooking potential early changes in child behaviour, we included this as a secondary exploratory outcome along with other measures of lower priority.\nThis report presents version 3 (April 20 2022) of the study protocol."

The AWMF guidelines on cognitive impairment (H\u00e4\u00dfler et al., 2014) and autism spectrum disorder (AWMF, 2016, 2021) as well as the NICE guidelines (NICE, 2013, 2015) form the basis for the potential risk factors and the recommendations for action.\nCompilation of risk factors and recommendations\nJG and HB screened the guidelines for mentions of challenging behaviour and the suspected contributing factors\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.org\nand compiled a list of risk factors of CB. This preliminary list was revised and expanded with the clinical expertise from the teams of the specialised outpatient units for ASD and IDD and the clinic for children with multiple disabilities and IDD (Klinik\nam Greinberg). This list forms the basis of the app\u2019s behaviour analysis algorithm.\nThe selection of evidence-based recommendations is primarily based on the guidelines for ASD and IDD\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 06 frontiersin.org\n(NICE, 2013, 2015; H\u00e4\u00dfler et al., 2014; AWMF, 2021). Psychoeducational information and appropriate strategies for each risk factor were mainly compiled from published treatment manuals and from clinical experience with those patient groups. Additionally, we collected feedback\nand invited suggestions from the teams of the specialised outpatient units for ASD and IDD and the Klinik am Greinberg. Interventions that directly target children\u2019s CB include, for example, structuring the environment according to the principles of TEACCH (H\u00e4u\u00dfler, 2005;\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nVirues-Ortega et al., 2013), contingency management, and providing effective prompts based on Stepping Stone\u2019s Triple P (Naumann et al., 2007) and the Therapy Program for Children with Hyperkinetic and Oppositional Problem Behaviors [THOP; (D\u00f6pfner et al., 2013; Kinnen et al., 2016)], emotion regulation according to the principles of dialectical behaviour therapy [DBT; (Elstner, 2012; McNair et al., 2017)], and the creation of favourable living conditions based on Grawe\u2019s model of basic psychological needs (Grawe, 2000). Interventions strengthening caregivers\u2019 resources are based on the Parenting Stress Model by Abidin (1992), e.g., emotion regulation according to DBT (Fleischhaker et al., 2010; Reicherzer and Bohus, 2017; von Auer and Bohus, 2017), stress management (Kaluza, 2011; St\u00e4chele et al., 2020), self-care and resource activation (Lemper-Pychlau and Schneider-Bl\u00fcmchen, 2013; Koppenh\u00f6fer, 2018; Reddeman, 2020), mindfulness and relaxation (Li et al., 2018; Weitlauf et al., 2020) and the satisfaction of basic physical needs (Millstein et al., 2020).\nPsychoeducational texts were written by HB and JG with support from RM. Subsequently, all texts were converted into plain language by three students of our cooperation partner Prof. Ratz from the Chair of Special Education IV \u2013 Education for People with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities. Those plain language texts were then proof-read by JG, HB and RM to ensure the conservation of meaning.\nBehaviour analysis process with ProVIA-Kids ProVIA-Kids (Figures 2, 3) systematically explores the aforementioned potential risk factors for CB via the behaviour analysis algorithm, on the basis of which caregivers are provided with appropriate recommendations.\nAfter challenging behaviour has occurred, caregivers use the app to conduct a behaviour analysis (5\u201310 min). The algorithm inquires after the child\u2019s mood, aversive tension, frustration, pain/illness, changes in the child\u2019s schedule, nature of the situation (predictability/novelty, degree of structuredness, transition situations, sensory conditions, presence of certain individuals/group situations), prior demands made to the child and reinforcement conditions (positive and negative consequences of the CB). The algorithm assesses the presence of each factor via a single- or multiple-choice question. Each possible answer is defined as either \u201cpathological\u201d (indicating the factor was present in the situation) or \u201cuncritical\u201d (factor not present in the situation). For example, the algorithm asks \u201cDid the situation involve a transition?\u201d If the caregiver answers \u201cYes\u201d (= pathological answer), cursive for transition situation is saved as a situation-specific contributing factor. Subsequently, the user gets a summary of all identified potential risk factors for the behaviour in a given situation. For each identified factor, users get a) an explanation of why this factor is challenging for people with ASD and/or IDD and why it can lead to CB and b) brief\nrecommendations to mitigate that factor in the future (reading time: 5 min). For each brief recommendation, a corresponding extensive psychoeducational chapter is available, in which more detailed information can be found (reading time: 15\u2013 30 min).\nIf the user affirms the presence of, e.g., 5 risk factors in a given situation, they will be presented with a summary list of those 5 factors. If they click on a factor, e.g., sensory hypersensitivity/hyposensitivity, they can read a short explanation and recommendation for this factor. These short recommendation texts contain links to the corresponding extensive chapter(s) with more in detail explanations and strategies. Each affirmative response (\u201cYes, the risk factor was present\u201d) triggers the corresponding recommendation. The current algorithm doesn\u2019t depend on response patterns.\nAll user-conducted behaviour analyses are stored in the app to allow for subsequent in-depth study and a review of changes over time. Across all completed analyses, the frequencies of each risk factor are displayed graphically, so user can identify the most common \u2013 and likely most important \u2013 ones.\nCaregivers can also create a profile for each child and for themselves (5\u201310 min each). The profile items assess crosssituational risk factors as possible triggers or aggravating factors for CB. The child\u2019s profile addresses e.g., unmet physical needs, lack of communication skills or a general lack of structure. The caregiver profile comprises factors influencing the child\u2019s behaviour (e.g., negative attitudes toward the child, dysfunctional attribution of the child\u2019s behaviour) and an assessment of the caregiver\u2019s resources (e.g., depressive symptoms, level of support). The app also provides feedback on all cross-situational factors for which the caregiver indicated a problem and provides corresponding recommendations.\nUsers can study psychoeducational chapters independently of the behaviour analyses via the menu and mark them as favourites.\nThe app also includes the option to enter daily assessments of the caregiver\u2019s mood, the amount of self-care and app use and the level of experienced stress due to the CB (5 min). Users can view those four parameters in a graph displaying the previous 7 or 30 days. This allows users to visually recognise relationships, e.g., between increased self-care and improvements in their mood, or between the degree of their app use and a reduction in stress due to the CB. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 outline the intervention components in greater detail."

The\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Schematic architecture and workflow of the ProVIA-Kids app.\nuser interface is based on web components developed using the Vue3 framework. The app provides an extensive web component library (e.g., for buttons, input fields, navigation bars, text containers, or plots) for the user interface, whose implementations can be reused.\nThe app consists of elements grouped into five logical modules (see Figure 4): HomeScreen, Settings, Encrypted Local Storage, Questionnaire Module, and Mood Diary. The app user (see Figure 4-1) can select various functions on the home screen (see Figure 4-2), including the possibility to configure the app, for example, to delete user data or to change the language (see\nFigure 4-3). These settings are saved to an encrypted local data storage (see Figure 4-3a). Data storage is implemented using a data access layer that transparently encrypts all data using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and stores it in an SQLite database. Therefore, the AES symmetric key and initialization\nvector are generated upon first app start and stored in a secure keychain the mobile operating system provides.\nThe app\u2019s primary function is to fill out questionnaires, evaluate them automatically, and provide further assistance to users. These functions are grouped together in the Questionnaire Module (see Figure 4\u20134, 13, 14a, 15b, 15c). For example, users can fill out a profile questionnaire for themselves or the children in their care (see Figure 4-4). Configurable rules (see Figure 4\u201315c) calculate value spaces from the given answers, which in turn can be assigned to different recommendation texts (see Figure 4\u20135) and displayed to the user (see Figure 4\u20136). For example, for a question about the number of hours of sleep, the answer given can be assigned to one of the two recommendation texts \u201cinsufficient sleep\u201d or \u201ccorrect amount of sleep\u201d (also depending on age, for example). The user can also access further information\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nindependently of the displayed recommendations via the knowledge section containing articles on different topics (see\nFigure 4\u20137). In addition to profile questionnaires, the app also offers a questionnaire for behavioural analysis of a situation with a child in care (see Figure 4\u20138). For this questionnaire, recommendations can also be calculated and displayed to the user (see Figure 4\u20139, 10), and further articles can be offered (see Figure 4\u201311). Already completed questionnaires and their recommendations can be recalled in a list-based history view (see Figure 4\u201312). The app also offers visual feedback on all behavioural analyses grouped according to the answers given (see Figure 4\u201313). For example, it can be quickly identified if a particular behaviour only occurs at a specific time of day, during certain activities, or only with specific users.\nKnowledge Base articles (see Figure 4\u201314a) offered in the app (see Figure 4\u20137, 11) are stored in an external database formatted as Markdown documents (see Figure 4\u201314b) and can be delivered to the app via a web interface (see Figure 4- 14c). Therefore, a developed Markdown parser maps the articles and their contents (e.g., text or images) during display (see\nFigure 4\u20137, 4\u201311).\nApp questionnaires are defined in Excel files and can thus be quickly customised by non-technical personnel (see\nFigure 4-15a). These Excel files are stored in a GitHub repository, are converted to JSON configuration files by a GitHub Action when modified, and are added to a new build of the app (see Figure 4\u201315b). Recommendations are generated based on JSON configuration files (see Figure 4\u201315c). These include a mapping from answer value spaces (\u201cconditions\u201d) to Markdown documents. For example, a recommendation for a child\u2019s mood in behaviour analysis is displayed if the following condition is evaluated to \u201ctrue\u201d by a developed expression parser: answer[\u201cchild-mood\u201d]===\u201cgood\u201d && answer[\u201cchildmood-good\u201d]!==\u201crelaxed.\u201d\nThe app also lets the user enter their daily mood in a mood diary (see Figure 4-17) and display it in a 7- or 30-days view (see\nFigure 4-16). In addition, the app can display a daily reminder to fill out the mood diary as an app push notification with the user\u2019s consent (see Figure 4-18).\nQuestionnaires completed by the user (i.e., profile questionnaires, behavioural analysis questionnaires, and mood diary questionnaires) are stored locally as answersheets in encrypted storage (see Figure 4-19a). Completed questionnaires are pseudonymized (see Figure 4\u201319b, 19c), then sent transportencrypted to a REST API service (see Figure 4-19d) (Pryss et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2021) and stored in a relational database (see\nFigure 4\u201319e). The API service and the database are hosted in the UKW data center. Researchers of the participating research institutes can evaluate the stored questionnaires with the help of analysis software (see Figure 4\u201320) and generate reports (see\nFigure 4\u201321). The app follows a model-driven approach: the individual pages or modules are implemented as web components in\nTypeScript and Sass or CSS, while the control flow logic, questionnaires, recommendations, and associated knowledge base articles can be variably adapted to the needs of the study to be conducted using various JSON-based configuration files. Hence, questionnaires and recommendations are dynamically generated and displayed based on users\u2019 answers."

Apps as stand-alone procedures for the treatment of depressive symptoms (comparable to resource building components in ProVIA) meta-analytically show an effect size of d = 0.33 (Weisel et al., 2019). Based on the\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 11 frontiersin.org\nassumption that app-based interventions generally produce effects of lower strength, but that ProVIA contains resourcebuilding interventions for caregivers in addition to parent training components, we assume an effect size of d = 0.6.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The aim of the ProVIA project is to investigate the efficacy of a digital behaviour analysis tool addressing CB in children with ASD and/or IDD for reducing the caregiver\u2019s stress burden.\nBehaviour analyses are the foundation of any cognitivebehavioural intervention. They are used to identify the causes and maintaining conditions of dysfunctional behaviour, the modification of which allows for behavioural change. Behaviour analysis is an effective method for addressing CB in patients with ASD and/or IDD (Dunlap and Fox, 2011; NICE, 2015). In addition to modifying the behaviour, they also positively influence caregivers\u2019 attitudes toward the child and the behaviour, e.g., by attributing CB less to negative traits of the child and more to circumstances and a need for support. However, caregivers are largely dependent on the availability of a therapy slot for the child to be guided in the use of behaviour analysis by the child\u2019s therapist. Considering the scarcity of therapy places and general resources for caregivers and the high levels of stress caregivers experience due to CB (Jungbauer and Meye, 2008; Giovagnoli et al., 2015; Geissler et al., 2021b), ProVIA addresses a highly relevant issue.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the ProVIA-Kids app is the first attempt to translate a comprehensive behaviour analysis into a digital and automatized format. With the app, caregivers of children with ASD and/or IDD have at their disposal a free of charge, low-threshold, practice-oriented tool that can support them in their everyday life dealing with CB. The app promotes an understanding of the causes of the behaviour and provides strategies for handling and preventing CB.\nFor the study, the app will be tested by parents as caregivers. Detailed feedback on both the content and the technical aspects will be collected from study participants. If results from the study indicate that digital automated behaviour analysis is feasible and effective, this tool can support a broad group of caregivers, e.g., therapists, teachers or staff in kindergartens and residential facilities.\nChallenges concerning automated behaviour analysis\nDespite the opportunities this app offers, however, there are also potential risks we need to consider concerning automated behaviour analysis. It is unclear whether automated behaviour analysis can adequately identify and map the individual causes of CB considering the complexity of human decision-making processes. While therapists can freely explore possible causes\nof a given behaviour in conversations with caregivers and through observation of the patient, the app\u2019s algorithm required a pre-selection of risk factors, which are then queried for each situation. We based the selection of risk factors on the guidelines for ASD and IDD as well as clinical experience from our specialised inpatient and outpatient treatment settings. Nevertheless, behaviour analysis is a method that requires a high degree of individualisation. In contrast to the app, therapists can, for example, explore circumstances in a more targeted way, specifically observe certain aspects and spot inconsistencies. It is still unclear whether breaking CB down to a few common risk factors can result in meaningful interventions for the individual patient.\nAnother fundamental question is whether lay people can successfully conduct a behaviour analysis without the support of clinical experts: Can they adequately answer the questions comprising the behaviour analysis? Can they implement the rather complex interventions? Or are the demands too high? In order to support users in understanding the mode of action/logic of a behaviour analysis and in using the app, we designed an app user guide, which is presented prominently on the home screen. However, it is possible that a therapist-guided introduction to the method and the joint exemplary performance of some analyses are requirements for sensitising caregivers to the relevant information and facilitating the meaningful interpretation of the behaviour analysis results.\nPotential harms for patients related to the self-help approach\nMental health interventions carried out by lay people in a self-help format without professional supervision (e.g., by therapists) place a lot of responsibility on the users. The absence of external feedback confers certain risks for patients. If interventions are used incorrectly or for the wrong purposes, there is no external control instance. To prevent harm from incorrect app use, we have taken several risk mitigation measures. We clearly defined the target group (children with ASD or IDD aged 3\u201311 years) and the forms of CB that can be addressed by the app (predominantly aggressive behaviour). The specific age range was chosen, because comorbidities and the manifestation of CB vary with age. For example, the onset of puberty often represents a marked change and therefore the use of the app as a stand-alone method is not appropriate. To prevent comprehension problems all texts are written in plain language. Additionally, throughout the psychoeducational chapters and recommendations caregivers are encouraged to involve specialists from different professions for issues exceeding the scope of the app. This was done to minimise risks associated with user frustration due to user errors or\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 13 frontiersin.org\nexcessive demands. Furthermore, we wanted to avoid suggesting that even the most serious behavioural issues can be solved via an app alone. Finally, users are informed about general risks of behaviour modification that also occur in classical inperson behaviour therapy, such as an initial increase in CB or interpersonal conflicts.\nGeneral challenges related to mental health applications\nBeyond the technical and content-related aspects, there are some fundamental challenges with regard to the medium of MHAs, which will be briefly discussed here. In their recent review, Bauer and colleagues discuss various risks associated with MHA (Bauer et al., 2020). There seems to be a group of people who do not use health applications (HA) for various reasons or do not find them attractive (Krebs and Duncan, 2015) due to e.g., a general lack of interest, (hidden) costs or data protection concerns. ProVIA-Kids addresses the data protection risks through pseudonymisation and the storage of data on a secure server at the University Hospital of W\u00fcrzburg. The project\u2019s public funding and the resulting independence from private-sector interests or advertising partners contributes to a high standard of data protection and ensures that the app remains completely free of charge. However, even among people who are open to using HAs, the use of the HAs or interventions to be carried out independently (including online programmes) in general shows highly variable and often low retention rates, especially outside the study context. Since motivation and commitment are essential, ProVIA-Kids was designed to be attractive for users, e.g., by addressing them personally and using interactive elements such as a mood diary."
