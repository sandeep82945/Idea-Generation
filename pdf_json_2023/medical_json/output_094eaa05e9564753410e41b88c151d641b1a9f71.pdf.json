    "abstractText": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in immunocompromised patients, usually shows pronounced antimicrobial resistance. In recent years, the frequency of carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa has decreased, which allows use of new beta-lactams/combinations in antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the in vitro evaluation of these drugs in contemporary isolates is warranted. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic aspects of 119 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from 24 different hospitals in Brazil in 2021\u20132022. Identification was performed via MALDI-TOF-MS, and antimicrobial susceptibility was identified through broth microdilution, gradient tests, or disk diffusion. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out using NextSeq equipment. The most active drug was cefiderocol (100%), followed by ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (94.1%), ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam (92.4%), and imipenem\u2013relebactam (81.5%). Imipenem susceptibility was detected in 59 isolates (49.6%), and the most active aminoglycoside was tobramycin, to which 99 (83.2%) isolates were susceptible. Seventy-one different sequence types (STs) were detected, including twelve new STs described herein. The acquired resistance genes blaCTX-M-2 and blaKPC-2 were identified in ten (8.4%) and two (1.7%) isolates, respectively. Several virulence genes (exoSTUY, toxA, aprA, lasA/B, plcH) were also identified. We found that new antimicrobials are effective against the diverse P. aeruginosa population that has been circulating in Brazilian hospitals in recent years.",

In Brazil, high endemic rates of drug-resistant pathogens are reported [6,7]. Regarding P. aeruginosa specifically, the SPM-1-producing, colistin-only susceptible (COS) ST277 clone has been reported to predominate in the country throughout the last two decades [8]. Over the years, surveillance studies have shown stability in the rates of carbapenem-resistance in P. aeruginosa from Latin America [9]. Nevertheless, the frequency of SPM-producing P. aeruginosa has been consistently reported to be decreasing in recent years [10\u201312], showing the involvement of non-enzymatic mechanisms in carbapenem resistance, including porin loss and efflux pump system overproduction [13]. This change in the epidemiology of carbapenem resistance allows for the opportunity to use new beta-lactams/combinations in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an in vitro evaluation of these drugs using contemporary isolates from clinical sources. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a large collection of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from various hospitals in Brazil during 2021\u20132022. The whole-genome sequence of the isolates was obtained in order to define their clonality, resistome, and virulome characteristics."

In addition, quality parameters were not achieved after the sequencing of 15 isolates, which were excluded. Therefore, 119 isolates recovered from the clinical specimens of 115 non-repetitive patients who attended one of twenty-four public or private health institutions located in 16 different Brazilian cities, were included. The isolates were recovered mainly from the respiratory tract (n = 58; 48.7%), followed by blood or central venous catheter tips (26; 21.8%), urine (16; 13.4%), infected wounds (6; 5.0%), surveillance swabs (3; 2.5%), or cerebrospinal fluid (1, 0.8%), and nine isolates (7.6%) were recovered from other clinical sources. Antimicrobial susceptibility evaluated via disk-diffusion is presented in Table 1. According to the Magiorakus classification, most of the isolates were identified as multidrugresistant (MDR) (55.5%) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) (18.5%), and one isolate (0.8%) was identified as pan-drug-resistant (PDR). The remaining 30 isolates (25.2%) were classified as susceptible.\nPathogens 2023, 12, 918 4 of 11\nMIC values determined via broth-microdilution or gradient tests (Table 2) showed that all isolates were susceptible to cefiderocol (100% susceptibility), and the most active drugs were ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (94.1%), ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam (92.4%), and imipenem\u2013 relebactam (81.5%). Among classical drugs, a comparable susceptibility rate was found only for tobramycin (83.2%). The carbapenem susceptibility rates ranged from 47.9% (imipenem, broth microdilution) to 66.4% (doripenem, disk-diffusion). Resistance to colistin and polymyxin B was identified in four (3.4%) and three (2.5%) isolates, respectively; according to CLSI, the remaining isolates were classified as intermediate (I). The distribution of MIC values, as well as the MIC50/MIC90 values, demonstrated the inefficacy of tigecycline, fosfomycin, and eravacycline against these P. aeruginosa isolates (Table 2). Genomic analysis identified 71 different sequence types (STs) among the 119 P. aeruginosa sequences evaluated. Of note, twelve new STs were identified for the first time in this study, of which eight are new allele combinations and three are new alleles (mutL, aroE, trpE)\u2014one isolate presented new alleles for two genes simultaneously (guaA and mutL). The most frequent ST, ST235, was found in sixteen isolates (13.4%) from eight hospitals across seven cities; this ST was identified in isolates recovered from different sources, including blood, infected wounds, respiratory tracts, and surveillance swabs. The distribution of common STs (detected in more than one isolate), according to hospital and isolation source, is presented in Table 3. An in silico analysis identified eleven predicted serotypes, with O11 (33.6%) and O1 (10.1%) as the most frequent, and all the ST235 isolates (n = 16) presented the O11 predicted serotype (Table S1). The phylogenetic tree based on pangenome analysis correlated with STs and partially with the predicted serotypes, showing that the ST235 isolates to be more resistant than isolates with other STs (Figure 1; Table S2). In fact, the XDR phenotype was more frequent in ST235 isolates (12/16, 75%) than in isolates belonging to other STs (10/103, 10.7%) (p < 0.0001 on the Yates\u2019 chi-squared test).\nPathogens 2023, 12, 918 5 of 11\n1 BMD; in house broth-microdilution. 2 Gradient strips; if necessary, MIC values were rounded up to the next log2 dilution.

Nine isolates (eight with the XDR phenotype and one MDR) carried the ESBL blaCTX-M-2 gene, and they were identified as ST235 (n = 6), ST111, ST244, and ST309 (n = 1, each). The blaGES-1 gene was identified in another ST235 XDR isolate, and the blaKPC-2 gene was found in one XDR isolate (ID_0367_21) belonging to ST803. One isolate (ID_0455_22), XDR, ST1284, simultaneously carried the tetG, blaKPC-2 and blaCTX-M-2 genes. The analysis of the genetic environment associated with the blaKPC-2 gene showed that isolate ID_0367_21 carries the gene on a plasmid with a DNA sequence similar to plasmids harboring carbapenemases that circulate in P. aeruginosa worldwide (corresponding to GenBank Accession Numbers CP078000, LC586269, CP077989). On this plasmid, the gene is located in a truncated non-Tn4401 genetic element (NTEKPC), similar to that presented in FII-FIB(pQil) plasmids that harbor KPC-3 in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from the USA [27]. In contrast, it was not possible to define whether the blaKPC-2 gene of isolate ID_0455_22 is present on a plasmid or the chromosome. However, blaKPC-2 is present in a truncated form of Tn4401 element isoform b. Our analysis revealed that a segment of 6844 bp with 99.9% similarity to Tn4401b and an intact IRR is present in the genome of this isolate. Another MDR isolated with ST309 was found to carry the tetG gene. Several genes that confer resistance to aminoglycosides were identified, such as aac, aad, ant, and aph; conversely, armA or rmt-family genes, which are associated with high levels of aminoglycoside resistance, were not detected. Genes associated with the four effector proteins of the type III secretion system (T3SS), namely exoS, exoT, exoU, and exoY, were detected at frequencies of 63.8%, 98.3%, 30.2%, and 92.4%, respectively. As expected [28], the association of exoS and exoU in the same isolate was not detected. Additionally, genes encoding exotoxin A (toxA) were detected in 97.5% of the isolates; alkaline protease (aprA), elastase (lasA/B), and phospholipase C (plcH) were detected in all of the isolates (except for one isolate negative for the lasA gene)."

In this study, we identified that antimicrobial agents not in use in clinical settings have preserved activity against clonally diverse P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. P. aeruginosa is recognized as an opportunistic pathogen causing skin and soft tissue infections and even\nPathogens 2023, 12, 918 8 of 11\npotentially fulminant invasive infections [29]. The treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is limited because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms [30]. Carbapenems have been employed for clinical treatment, but with the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamases, a potent class of carbapenemases, beta-lactams (with the exception of aztreonam, which is not hydrolyzed by MBL) are no longer recommended for the treatment of P. aeruginosa [30]. It is known that difficult-to-treat infections due to P. aeruginosa result in worse prognosis with poor outcomes [1]. Molecular studies have identified that the spread of MBL production in Brazil is associated with a dissemination of a specific sequence type, ST277, the so-called colistinonly susceptible (COS) P. aeruginosa [31]. More recently, however, a reduction in the prevalence of MBL-producing ST277 was observed in Brazilian hospitals, but the reasons for this change in epidemiology are not clear [10\u201312]. By analyzing a large collection of P. aeruginosa recovered from the clinical specimens of patients admitted to different hospitals, we identified 71 different STs among the 119 isolates evaluated. The diversity of clones, which has been reported in previous smaller studies in recent years, may be linked to the widespread misuse of antimicrobials rather than clonal dissemination through cross-transmission [32]. Intriguingly, we identified that ST235 isolates carried more resistance markers than isolates with other STs. ST235 is considered a \u201chigh-risk clone\u201d because of its ability to accumulate antimicrobial resistance genes and is widespread in diverse hospital settings [33]. We speculate that a transition from the ST277 to the ST235 P. aeruginosa clone, which is still expanding in Brazilian hospitals, has been occurring. As ST235 was found to display more resistance than the other clones (Figure 1), attention must be paid to this high-risk clone to avoid or at least reduce its dissemination. We identified the high activity of cefiderocol (100%), ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (94.1%), ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam (92.4%), and imipenem\u2013relebactam (81.5%) in our analyses. Of these drugs, only cefiderocol is currently not approved for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections in Brazil. Avibactam and relebactam are second-generation beta-lactamase inhibitors able to inhibit class A, C, and D beta-lactamases, with activity against KPCproducing Enterobacterales and KPC-producing Pseudomonas [34]. In our study, two isolates with KPC-2 in different genetic backgrounds were identified, which is not common in our region [35] but has been reported in other countries [36\u201339]. Regarding currently available drugs in hospital settings, polymyxin B and colistin were found to present high activity against the P. aeruginosa isolates, as observed by the MIC50 and MIC90 results (Table 2). In a realistic scenario, empiric treatment with polymyxins is still employed in Brazilian settings, which, in theory, would cover the contemporary P. aeruginosa isolates causing hospital-acquired infections in the country. Nevertheless, recent guidelines do not recommend use of this class of drugs for severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, as some studies have shown worse outcomes, especially when compared to ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam [40]. Molecular analysis identified that only 16% of the carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa is mediated by metallo-beta-lactamase production, rendering the use of ceftolozane\u2013tazobactam, ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, or other beta-lactam combinations instead of polymyxins possible as empirical treatments in Brazilian hospitals. In addition to the robust data on antimicrobial susceptibility generated in this study, the determination of the resistome and virulome for each isolate is notable. The inclusion of such genomes in public databases will contribute to future studies with both local and global perspectives, allowing for the tracking of an important public health pathogen of clinical relevance."
