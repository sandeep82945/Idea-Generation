However, the kSZ effect will also act as the dominant source of noise for several other measurements that use small angular scales in CMB temperature maps, since its blackbody nature implies that standard component separation techniques cannot be used to remove it from observed maps. In this paper, we explore the idea of \u201cde-kSZing\u201d: constructing a template for the late-time kSZ effect using external surveys of large-scale structure, and then subtracting this template from CMB temperature maps in order to remove some portion of the kSZ signal. After building intuition for general aspects of the de-kSZing procedure, we perform forecasts for the de-kSZing efficiency of several large-scale structure surveys, including BOSS, DESI, Roman, MegaMapper, and PUMA. We also highlight potential applications of de-kSZing to cosmological constraints from the CMB temperature power spectrum, CMB lensing reconstruction, and the moving-lens effect. While our forecasts predict achievable dekSZing efficiencies of 10-20% at best, these results are specific to the de-kSZing formalism adopted in this work, and we expect that higher efficiencies are possible using improved versions of this formalism.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe \u201cprimary\u201d fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which encode the properties of the universe during the recombination era, have played a key role in the establishment of our current cosmological model. \u201cSecondary\u201d fluctuations, created by processes occurring after recombination, are now attracting significant theoretical and observational interest, as they can in principle be used to probe numerous aspects of astrophysics and fundamental physics.\nIn particular, much recent interest has been focused on the various incarnations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect ([1\u20134]; see Ref. [5] for a recent review), by which CMB photons scatter off of free electrons associated with massive dark matter halos. The thermal SZ (tSZ) effect, generated by thermal motions of electrons within a halo, distorts the CMB blackbody spectrum and probes the pressure of those electrons. The kinetic SZ (kSZ) effect, generated by bulk motion of the electrons, leads to additional small-scale CMB anisotropies and is sensitive to a combination of large-scale velocity flows and the spatial distribution of electrons. The polarized SZ (pSZ) effect, generated by a quadrupole in the radiation field observed by the scatterer (and therefore sensitive to the various effects that can contribute to that quadrupole), induces linear polarization in the scattered photons. Higher-order\ncorrections to these effects also have distinctive signatures and a variety of applications (e.g. [6\u20138]).\nThese effects are interesting signals in many contexts, but in other contexts, they represent sources of bias and/or noise that degrade our ability to make useful measurements. A significant portion of the tSZ effect can be removed from observed CMB maps thanks to its nonblackbody spectral shape, but the (blackbody) kSZ effect cannot be removed in this way, and is expected to dominate the observed temperature fluctuations at ` & 4000 after non-blackbody signals have been filtered out. For sufficiently high-resolution observations, reconstruction of gravitational lensing of the CMB will make use of temperature fluctuations at these scales, and the kSZ effect can significantly bias this reconstruction [9, 10], affecting its ability to constrain neutrino mass, dark energy, and dark matter (e.g. [11, 12]). Furthermore, kSZ fluctuations at small scales add noise to measurements of the Silk-damped regime of the primary CMB, which can be used to probe the effective number of free-streaming species Neff , the primordial helium abundance Yp, and the spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations. The kSZ effect also acts as noise for measurements of other CMB secondaries, such as the moving-lens effect [13\u201315].\nThis situation is analogous to gravitational lensing of the CMB, which is both a physically interesting signal and a source of bias and noise for other measurements (including primordial gravitational waves, acoustic os-\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n03 97\n3v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n6 A\npr 2\n02 3\n2 cillations in the primary CMB, and lensing itself). In the lensing case, methods to \u201cde-lens\u201d CMB temperature and polarization maps have been extensively investigated [16\u201320], applied to recent CMB observations [21\u2013 25], and integrated into the core analysis pipelines that are being developed for upcoming surveys [26]. \u201cInternal\u201d de-lensing uses lensing maps reconstructed from a CMB survey to remove lensing effects from temperature and polarization maps from the same survey, while \u201cexternal\u201d de-lensing uses an external dataset to estimate a lensing map that is used to de-lens the observed CMB.\nIn this work, we investigate the prospects for external \u201cde-kSZing\u201d of CMB temperature maps, whereby an external galaxy survey is used to construct a template for the kSZ effect, which is then subtracted from the observed maps. Specifically, we consider the portion of the kSZ effect sourced by the post-reionization universe (the \u201clate-time\u201d kSZ effect), since this is expected to either dominate over the kSZ signal from reionization or be comparable to it, depending on the models that are assumed [10]. Following Refs. [27, 28]1, we construct a template by using a galaxy survey to reconstruct the largescale velocity field, and multiplying by a linear reconstruction of the electron density field; this forms a template for the electron momentum field, which can then be projected along the line of sight to yield an estimate of the kSZ-induced CMB temperature fluctuations. While Refs. [27, 28] explored the prospect of cross-correlating this template with the CMB in order to measure the kSZ effect for probing baryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium, our motivation here is to use the template to remove some portion of the kSZ effect from CMB observations.\nThe bulk of our paper is concerned with assessing the performance of kSZ templates constructed from galaxy surveys with different properties, and performing an initial exploration of several possible applications of dekSZing with external data: namely, constraining cosmological parameters using the CMB damping tail, improving the reconstruction of gravitational lensing, and measuring halo profiles using the moving-lens effect. While our overall conclusion is that it will be challenging to obtain significant benefits from de-kSZing within the formalism adopted in this work, it\u2019s likely that modifications to this formalism could yield substantial improvements, and we discuss this further in the final section of the paper.\nNote that we will use the term \u201ckSZ effect\u201d to refer only to the late-time kSZ effect in the body of the paper; we will briefly discuss the implications of de-kSZing the late-time kSZ effect on the measurement of the kSZ signal from reionization at the end of Sec. V A.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the main theoretical expressions used to describe\n1 See also Ref. [29] for a fully 3-dimensional formalism for kSZ templates.\nthe kSZ effect, as well as our formalism for constructing kSZ templates from galaxy surveys and how we model the relevant quantities. In Sec. III, we build intuition for the ability of different kSZ templates to capture a given fraction of the true kSZ signal, by enumerating the relevant redshifts and halo masses (III A), the separate impacts of the velocity and electron density templates (III B), and the influence of redshift uncertainties in the input galaxy survey (III D). In Sec. IV, we forecast the usefulness of specific galaxy surveys for de-kSZing, including BOSS, DESI, the Roman Space Telescope, the MegaMapper proposal, and the PUMA 21 cm intensity mapping proposal. In Sec. V, we discuss the potential of de-kSZing to improve measurements of cosmological parameters, CMB lensing, and the moving lens effect. Finally, we discuss plausible improved versions of de-kSZing and conclude in Sec. VI.\nThe appendices discuss the impact of shot noise in the galaxy survey used to construct the template (Appendix A), the details of our halo model approach to modelling the signal and templates (Appendix B), the halo occupation distribution models we assume in our computations (Appendix C), our approach to modelling 21 cm intensity mapping surveys (Appendix D), and further details of our CMB forecasts (Appendices E-F)."

The accuracy of these approximations has been argued both analytically [30, 33] and using simulations [30, 34, 35].2\n2 Often in the literature, the squeezed limit (kL kS) is not taken when writing Eq.

(16)\n3 Similar formalisms for kSZ templates were previously presented in Refs. [27, 28, 33]. Ref. [27] computed Pge and Pgg using a linear bias model and Ref. [28] effectively assumed that Pge = 1, while we use a more detailed halo model approach based on Ref. [33], described in Sec. II C and Appendix B. Also, in contrast with Refs. [27, 33], we account for linear redshift-space distortions in the galaxy density when constructing our electrondensity and velocity templates.\n4 Redshift-space distortions in the observed galaxy density contrast \u03b4sg imply that Pvr\u03b7 and Pe both depend on the angle with respect to the line of sight, through \u00b5L and \u00b5S respectively. On the large scales that dominate the velocity contribution, redshift-distortions are approximately described by the Kaiser factor \u03b4sg(k, \u00b5) \u221d (bg + f\u00b52) [36]. On the other hand, at the scales relevant for the electron density contribution, there will be \u201cFinger of God\u201d damping of large-\u00b5S power caused by velocity dispersions on small scales [37]. However, the angular power spectrum of the template is a line-of-sight projection weighted by the kSZ weight function from Eq. (5), and the width and smoothness of this weight function will largely suppress the influence of large-\u00b5S modes on the final result (e.g. [38, 39]). This, it will not be necessary to include the Finger of God effect in our computations. We may then write the angular power spectrum derived from the q\u0302r-qr cross-correlation as\nC q\u0302rqr` = \u222b \u03c7\u2217 0 d\u03c7 \u03c72 K\u0303(z[\u03c7])2 Pq\u0302rqr ( `+ 1/2 \u03c7 , 0; z[\u03c7] ) ,\n(17) following the Limber approximation in setting \u00b5S = 0 [32].\nA short calculation shows that the auto spectrum of the template T\u0302kSZ is also given by Eqs. (16)-(17). However, in this case we must revisit the approximation that the connected four-point function can be neglected: the power spectrum of q\u0302r is related to the trispectrum of \u03b4 s g, which has several contributions from the shot noise of the corresponding galaxy sample. We can write this as\nC q\u0302rq\u0302r` = C q\u0302rqr ` + C shot ` , (18)\nwith Cshot` including all four-point shot noise terms. In the approximation of Poissonian shot noise, these contributions depend on the mean number density of the sample, along with the galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum (e.g. [40, 41]). In Appendix A, we estimate the dominant such contributions, finding that the added power to a kSZ template can be as high as several tens of percents of the reconstructed kSZ power for a few of the surveys we consider. We do not include these terms in the computations in the body of the paper, but note that they should be accounted for in detailed de-kSZing analyses, and we refer the reader to Appendix A for more details."

We briefly summarize this approach here, with further details contained in Appendix B. We use the public hmvec code for our\ncomputations.4\nIn the halo model, all matter is assumed to belong to bound, spherical halos. Correlation functions of matter may be computed once several ingredients are specified: the halo mass function, mass-dependent halo bias, and mass-dependent halo density profile. Correlation functions of galaxies additionally require models for how central and satellite galaxies occupy halos of a given mass, and the average spatial distribution of satellite galaxies with in a halo; similarly, predictions involving the electron number density require a model for the electron density profile within halos. Two-point correlations are composed of a \u201ctwo-halo term,\u201d describing correlations between points located in different halos, and a \u201conehalo term,\u201d corresponding to two points located within the same halo.\nIn our calculations, we use the Sheth-Tormen halo mass function and halo bias [42], and a Navarro-FrenkWhite (NFW) density profile [43] with the concentrationmass relation from Ref. [44]. Electron density power spectra are computed by replacing the NFW profile with an electron profile model based on hydrodynamical simulations from Ref. [45]; in particular, we use the model including AGN feedback as a baseline. Following Ref. [46], we truncate the electron profile at a maximum radius chosen so that the enclosed gas mass is the same as for a NFW profile truncated at rcut = r200c. To describe galaxy clustering, we use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism (e.g. [47]), with specific HOD models introduced when they are used later in the paper.\nFinally, we use linear expressions for power spectra involving velocities, since only the large-scale velocity power will enter our results:\nPvv(k) =\n( faH\nk\n)2 Pm(k) , (19)\nPgv(k, \u00b5) = faH\nk (bg + f\u00b5\n2)Pm(k) , (20)\nwhere bg is computed within the halo model and the zdependence is left implicit.\nIII. INTUITION\nOur ability to remove the late-time kSZ signal from observed CMB maps will clearly depend on how much of the true kSZ signal is captured by a given template.

            "text": "We begin with Fig. 1, which visualizes the relative contribution to the kSZ auto power from different redshifts and halo masses. Specifically, we rewrite Eq. (6), Eq. (8), and the halo model expression for Pee as\nCkSZ` = \u222b z\u2217 0 dz \u222b d logmh d2CkSZ` dz d logmh\n(21)\nand plot the integrand of this expression, normalized to unity at its peak, for several representative ` values. (See Appendix B 3 for the details of how this is computed.) We show contours enclosing regions of the z \u2212mh plane that contribute 50%, 75%, and 90% of the total signal. We also translate the redshift axis into the corresponding wavenumbers probed in the Limber approximation (k \u2248 `/\u03c7(z)).\nWe find that 50% of the signal is generally localized to z . 2 and 12.5 . log10(mh/M ) . 15, while 75% of the signal arises from z . 3. The overall tilt of the contours stems from the fact that there are fewer highermass halos at higher redshift, so the contribution to CkSZ` from higher redshifts is naturally concentrated at lower halo masses.\nThe ranges of redshift and halo mass that dominate the kSZ signal depend strongly on the halo mass function. The electron-momentum power spectrum Pqrqr is proportional to the electron density power spectrum Pee (recall Eq. 8); in the regime where this is dominated by the one-halo term, if we approximate ugas(k,mh, z) \u2248 1, Eq. (B10) shows that Pee \u221d \u222b d logmhm 3 hn(mh, z). The integrand of this expression peaks in the range 13.5 < log10(mh/M ) < 14.5 for 0.5 < z < 2, with width \u2206 log10(mh/M ) of order unity; furthermore, this integral declines sharply with redshift, with roughly a factor of 40 difference between z = 1 and z = 3. The assumed electron density profile also has an important effect: in the model from Ref. [45], the profile is strongly suppressed at r & 2R200(mh, z), implying that the onehalo kSZ power from a halo with mass mh will be suppressed at wavenumbers k satisfying k & 2/R200(mh, z).5 Thus, there is an effective (redshift-dependent) maximum\n5 To see this mathematically, recall that the one-halo term depends on the Fourier transform of the density profile, ugas(k) \u221d\u222b dr r2\u03c1gas(k) sin(kr)/kr, and for a top-hat density profile\nwith maximum radius rmax, this evaluates to ugas(k) \u221d k\u22123j1(krmax), which has its first zero at k \u2248 4.5r\u22121max and is strongly suppressed at higher k.\n6 k to which a mass-mh halo will contribute significant kSZ power, and since R200 grows with halo mass, this maximum k will be smaller for more massive halos. We can see this in Fig. 1: lower ` values probe a higher maximum halo mass. In summary, the redshifts and halo masses that dominate the kSZ signal can mostly be understood in terms of (1) the abundance of halos of different masses at a given redshift, and (2) the spatial extent of the free electrons associated with each halo.\nOverall, these results indicate that a galaxy survey (or combination of surveys) with broad coverage in redshift and halo mass will be necessary to construct a high-fidelity kSZ template. For example, a sample of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) would likely miss a significant part of the kSZ signal, since ELGs generally occupy halos with much lower mass (i.e. mh \u223c 1012M [48\u2013 51]) than where the bulk of the kSZ contribution comes from. (We will explore specific galaxy samples, including ELGs, later in the paper.) Also, it will likely be challenging to recover more than roughly 80% of the kSZ signal unless one has access to a survey probing very low-mass (mh . 1011.5M ) halos at higher redshifts (such as a 21 cm intensity mapping survey [52, 53]), and is able to combine it with measurements of higher-mass halos.\nB.

We vary \u03b2 between 0 and 2, noting that \u03b2 \u2248 1 is a typical value found in real or simulated galaxy samples (e.g. [51, 54\u201356]). We also vary the galaxy number density n\u0304g, taken to be redshift-independent, and derive the corresponding (redshift-dependent) lower mass cutoff mcut by solving Eq. (B4). The resulting mcut values are shown in the lower panels of the figure.\nThe shapes of the curves in Fig. 3 can be interpreted in terms of whether the one-halo or two-halo term dominates. In particular, there are two noteworthy trends:\n\u2022 At higher redshift, the g-e correlation improves with increasing n\u0304g (and decreasing mcut). This is because, in the angular power spectrum, higher z corresponds to lower k, where the two-halo term is more important. At sufficiently low k (i.e. high z and low `), the two-halo term completely dominates and perfect cross-correlation can be achieved, although the (angular) kSZ power will also have some sensitivity to lower z where the correlation is worse. The correlation is noticeably worse for \u03b2 = 0 than for \u03b2 = 1 or 2, because \u03b2 = 0 implies a particularly\nlarge amplitude for the one-halo term, moving the pure-two-halo regime to lower k.\n\u2022 In the one-halo regime (low z, high k), a highfidelity electron template is achievable for sufficiently high galaxy number density. In this regime, lower values of \u03b2 result in a better template, because a higher satellite fraction implies a better measurement of the distribution of satellites within the halo, which will trace the distribution of electrons if the satellite profile and gas profile are similar."

(32)\nSince the redshift kernel for the kSZ effect is quite broad, one might expect that redshift errors would not have a strong effect on a kSZ template, as is the case when constructing templates for the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (e.g. [61]), for example. However, this intuition does not hold in this case, because our kSZ template involves a product of separate 3d templates for velocity and electron density, and low-\u00b5 modes of this product are affected by higher-\u00b5 modes of each component template. In particular, in the squeezed limit we have assumed for the kSZ effect in Eq. (16), the effect of redshift uncertainties on higher-\u00b5 modes of the velocity template propagates into the final projected kSZ template.\nIn Fig. 6, we show how different levels of redshift uncertainty affect CkSZ,template` computed using the HOD from Sec.

For \u03c3z/(1 + z) = 0.03, which is the target for LSST [62], the kSZ template power is suppressed at ` = 2000 by 85% (70%) for n\u0304g = 10\n\u22124 Mpc\u22123 (10\u22122 Mpc\u22123), and more than 90% for ` & 2500 (5000).

In some cases, we adjust a given HOD model or two-halo contribution to agree with the expected galaxy number density or linear bias, and we describe these adjustments below.\nBGS: We use the HOD from Ref. [55], which is fit to a mock galaxy catalog with the same apparent magnitude threshold as the BGS sample. Specifically, the authors fit their 5 free HOD parameters to the clustering of galaxy subsamples corresponding to different absolute magnitudes. We use the parameter fits corresponding to 0.1Mr \u2212 5 log h = \u221220.5, motivated by evidence from Ref. [65] that the distribution of absolute magnitudes of\n11\nBGS targets peaks at this value. However, we rescale the minimum halo mass and normalization of the satellite occupation by a redshift-dependent prefactor such that the predicted mean galaxy density matches the forecast values from Ref. [63] (see Appendix C 2). We also rescale the predicted two-halo term of the power spectrum to agree with the linear bias assumed for BGS in Ref. [63] in the low-k limit.\nLRGs: We use the LRG HOD from Ref. [51], which was fit to galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG simulation according to color cuts corresponding to the LRG sample. As with our BGS model, we rescale the HOD\nsuch that the mean galaxy density matches the LRG target density of 1.5\u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123 quoted in Ref. [51]. We use the linear bias predicted by this model, which ranges from 2.2 at z = 0.6 to 2.4 at z = 1. If we instead rescale the HOD to match the galaxy number density used for forecasting in Ref. [63], or rescale the two-halo term to match the linear bias used in that work, the end result for CkSZ,template` can change by up to 75% at lower multipoles, but never exceeds 6% of the true kSZ power spectrum. We have also compared with results from using a different HOD fit to imaging of LRG targets in Ref. [66], and found that CkSZ,template` is around 20% higher, which is not sufficient to qualitatively change our conclusions.\nELGs: We use the ELG HOD from Ref. [51], which is based on the \u201chigh-mass quenched\u201d ELG model from Ref. [49] and which was also fit to galaxies selected from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the galaxy density (\u223c1.5\u00d710\u22124Mpc\u22123) and linear bias (ranging from 1.3 at z = 0.65 to 2.0 at z = 1.65) predicted by this model. In contrast to other HODs described above, the expected number of centrals in the ELG model peaks in lowermass halos (mh \u223c 1012M ) and declines at higher halo masses6, reflecting the expectation that star formation is quenched in higher-mass halos and therefore these halos are less likely to host ELGs as their central galaxy (e.g. [48\u201351]). Using the galaxy density and linear bias from Ref. [63] decreases CkSZ,template` by roughly 30%, while using a parameterized version of the HOD from Ref. [67] changes it by around a factor of 2, but as with the LRGs, this does not alter the nature of our conclusions.\nQSOs: We use the error-function\u2013based HOD from Ref. [49], with the best-fit parameters fit to eBOSS quasar clustering but with the lower halo mass threshold and satellite fraction normalization adjusted to match the QSO number density given in Ref. [63], and with the 2-halo term rescaled to match the linear bias from Ref. [63] in the low-k limit. Due to the low expected QSO number density (. 10\u22125 Mpc\u22123), the QSO sample contributes negligibly to a reconstruction of the late-time kSZ signal, recovering less than 1% of the true kSZ power, so we do not show the corresponding template in Fig. 8 or discuss the QSO sample further.\nAmongst the different DESI samples, Fig. 8 shows that a template constructed from the LRGs captures the largest fraction of kSZ power, because its combination of halo mass range and redshift range is best matched to the ranges relevant for kSZ. However, for the same reasons as BOSS, DESI LRGs can still only recover a small fraction of kSZ power.

We only consider the H\u03b1 sample in this work, due to its higher number density and more relevant redshift range for construction of a kSZ template.\nFor an HOD, we use a parameterized fit to the HOD measured from a mock ELG catalog generated from the Galacticus semi-analytical model applied to the UNIT N-body simulation [70]. This model has a similar form to the DESI ELG used above, but with a central occupation that peaks at slightly lower halo masses and with a lower satellite fraction. We rescale the amplitudes of both the central and satellite occupations to match the H\u03b1 number densities from Ref.

Despite the relatively high ELG number density projected for the Roman H\u03b1 sample, the corresponding halo masses are too low and the redshift range is too high to capture a significant part of the kSZ signal. The de-kSZing efficiency exhibits a minimum at ` \u2248 6000, which corresponds to spatial scales in the regime where neither the two-halo nor one-halo terms are dominant at the relevant redshifts.\nIn principle, one may also consider the Euclid satellite, which will perform its own spectroscopic survey of H\u03b1 emitters. However, Table 3 of Ref. [71] indicates that this sample will have a lower number density than Roman and similar linear bias, so a kSZ template built from Euclid\u2019s H\u03b1 sample is not expected to fare any better than what we have forecast for Roman."

Note that we assume identical sky coverage of each survey when forming this combination, which will not be true in practice. With this caveat, we find that even this combination can recover roughly 35% of the latetime kSZ power at ` \u223c 1000, between 20 and 25% for 2000 . ` . 6000, and between 15 and 20% at higher multipoles.\nB. 21 cm intensity mapping\nPost-reionization large-scale structure can also be measured via 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen (e.g. [77\u2013 79]). In this subsection, we consider the PUMA (Packed Ultra-wideband Mapping Array [80, 81]) proposal for a next-generation 21 cm intensity mapping project, intended to map LSS over 0.3 < z < 6. We also comment on other 21 cm projects below.\nOur forecasts follow a similar procedure to those for spectroscopic surveys, but with several distinctions (see Appendix D for more details). Our chosen \u201cHOD\u201d model does not parameterize the occupation statistics of galaxies in halos, but instead makes use of a model for the relation between neutral hydrogen (HI) mass and halo mass in a given halo, following Refs. [52, 82]. In particular, we perform forecasts that assume either the mHI(mh) relation fit to the IllustrisTNG simulations in Ref. [52], or the parameterized function from Ref. [82] that was fit to observations of HI in resolved galaxies at z \u223c 0, constraints on the mean HI density at z \u223c 1, and properties of damped Lyman-\u03b1 absorbers at z & 2. We show these two options in Fig. 10. We also assume the HI density profile within a halo is given by the fitting formula from Ref. [52], again determined from IllustrisTNG; we show in Appendix D 4 that using the exponential HI profile from Ref. [82] changes our forecasts negligibly at low `\nand by tens of percents at higher `, which is subdominant to the impact of the mHI(mh) relation.\nFor the noise power of the HI auto spectrum, we add the (scale-dependent) instrumental noise power spectrum from Ref. [78] to the intrinsic shot noise of 21 cm emitters, computed using an updated version of the model from Ref. [83]. To ease comparisons with the surveys from Sec. IV A, we show an \u201ceffective number density\u201d n\u0304eff , equal to the inverse of the 21 cm instrumental+shot noise power spectrum, in Fig. 11. We consider configurations of PUMA with 32000 or 5000 dishes (\u201cPUMA-32k\u201d and \u201cPUMA-5k\u201d respectively, as considered in Refs. [78, 81]). The effective number density decreases at higher k\u22a5 due to the (redshift-dependent) finite angular resolution of the instrument. For PUMA-5k, the instrumental noise dominates over the shot noise, and the former increases with redshift due to the higher system temperature at lower frequencies, such that n\u0304eff decreases at higher redshift. For PUMA-32k, the instrumental and shot noise both contribute to the total noise, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing at higher redshifts, leading to the observed non-monotonic behavior of n\u0304eff with redshift.\nFinally, Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds are ex-\n14\npected to prevent certain Fourier modes of the HI distribution from being observed, and we account for this by assuming that modes with k\u2016 < 0.03 Mpc\n\u22121 or within a \u201cforeground wedge\u201d (see e.g. [84\u201386]) defined by 3 times the width of a PUMA dish\u2019s primary beam (following Ref. [78]) will be inaccessible. (We will comment on the impact of these assumptions below.) Note that the loss of low-k\u2016 modes in the 21 cm maps does not imply that the kSZ template\u2019s angular power spectrum has negligible amplitude, because the template is constructed from a quadratic combination of 21 cm maps; see Appendix D 3 for more discussion on this point.\nWe show the resulting kSZ template forecasts in Fig. 12. In the complete absence of foregrounds, a template from PUMA-32k would be able to recover \u223c45% of the true kSZ power at ` \u2248 1000, \u223c20% at ` \u2248 2500, and less at higher multipoles. This strong performance compared to the spectroscopic surveys from Sec. IV A is due to the high sensitivity of PUMA-32k (equivalent to very low shot noise) shown in Fig. 11. The results at higher multipoles are strongly dependent on the form of the mHI(mh) relation: the relation from Ref. [52] ascribes more HI to halo masses relevant for kSZ, and therefore\nresults in a better kSZ template, than the relation from Ref. [82].\nAccounting for the loss of low-k\u2016 modes due to foregrounds, the fraction of recovered kSZ power drops to roughly 20%, and also accounting for 21 cm signal loss within the foreground wedge reduces the recovered kSZ power to less than 10%. Note that the detrimental effect of the foreground wedge can in principle be completely removed with sufficiently accurate characterization of the 21 cm telescope and careful analysis (e.g. [87]), or via machine learning methods [88]. Also, low-k\u2016 modes can in principle be recovered with various reconstruction techniques (e.g. [41, 89, 90]). However, modes recovered in this way will have different noise properties than those\n15\nassumed in our forecasts, so we leave it to future work to assess their impact on a 21 cm-based kSZ template.\nAs expected, PUMA-5k fares worse than PUMA-32k, due to its lower sensitivity and worse angular resolution (which prevents it from accessing higher-` modes). At ` \u2248 1000, PUMA-5k could recover 25% of the kSZ power in the absence of foregrounds, 10% if low-k\u2016 modes are lost, and 6% if wedge modes are also lost. The performance of the kSZ template also degrades more quickly with ` than for PUMA-32k.\nWe have carried out forecasts for the HIRAX [91] and CHORD [92] instruments, but found that neither could recover more than 5% of the true kSZ power even in the absence of foregrounds, so we have not shown them in Fig. 12.\nIn these forecasts, we have followed Ref. [78] in our assumptions about 21 cm foreground cleaning, but we note that different assumptions can lead to significant variations in the grey curves in Fig. 12. In Appendix D 4, we explore different choices for the minimum accessible k\u2016 and the extent of the foreground wedge, and we find that the performance of the ensuing kSZ template can vary by as much as a factor of 10 (at low `) or 5 (at higher `), mostly in the downward direction (in no case do the analogs of the grey curves exceed the orange curves plotted in Fig. 12). The reader should thus bear in mind that the grey band shown in Fig. 12 is only roughly indicative of the template performance with a full treatment of foregrounds.\nA further source of uncertainty in these forecasts is the stochasticity of the distribution of neutral hydrogen, which we have assumed is solely attributable to the discreteness of 21 cm-emitting objects. Ref. [93] has recently used hydrodynamical simulations to show that the stochasticity of the HI density can far exceed the Poissonian approximation at z = 0 but is of the same order as this approximation at z = 1. We leave it to future work to incorporate more accurate estimates of HI stochasticity into our forecasts."

For futuristic lower-noise CMB experiments like CMB-HD, the kSZ effect will likely dominate the CMB signal due to better cleaning of frequency-dependent foregrounds [100]. The removal of the kSZ effect via de-kSZing discussed in this paper hence may allow a significant reduction of the observed small-scale CMB variance.\nIn Fig. 13, we demonstrate the reduction of the total\nILC-cleaned CMB variance by removing the (late-time) kSZ contribution. We describe our implementation of the ILC and the CMB forecasts in Appendix E. The left panel demonstrates the fractional reduction of the CMB variance at ` = 5000 for the CMB-S4 and CMB-HD surveys as a function of the fractional kSZ power spectrum amplitude that remains after de- kSZing (assuming that a scale-independent fraction of the amplitude is removed). The right panel demonstrates the same reduction for a range of CMB multipoles satisfying ` \u2208 [1, 20000]. In particular, for futuristic surveys such as CMB-HD, dekSZing can lead to a \u223c20% reduction of the CMB variance if \u223c60% of the kSZ signal can be removed. We also show forecasts for CMB-HD that omit frequencydependent foregrounds, as a proxy for a case where these foregrounds can be cleaned extremely efficiently; in this case, de-kSZing allows for a substantial reduction in temperature variance, particularly at higher multipoles.\nIn this section, we briefly highlight various ways in which de-kSZing may improve cosmological inference, leaving a more detailed analysis to future work. We envision a de-kSZing procedure in which a kSZ template T\u0302kSZ is subtracted from an observed temperature map. Based on the results in Sec. IV, we approximate this procedure as removing a scale-independent fraction of kSZ power, and examine the consequences of such a reduction. We find that significant gains in cosmological inference generally require de-kSZing to perform better than the detailed forecasts from Sec. IV, and we take this as motivation to explore improvements to the de-kSZing formalism used in this paper.\nA. Improving parameter constraints from the CMB power spectrum\nThe small-scale primary CMB anisotropies are exponentially suppressed due to Silk damping. The angular scale of this damping is determined by the expansion rate of the Universe and the free electron density before recombination, which are in turn sensitive to cosmological parameters such as the number of free-streaming species Neff , the baryon density \u2126b, and the Helium abundance Yp. De-kSZing can improve the measurement precision of the CMB damping tail, in principle leading to improved parameter constraints. Unfortunately, for the cases we have examined, including polarization information, these improvements turn out to be quite mild: even assuming 90% de-kSZing efficiency, we find that the uncertainty on determinations of Neff and \u2126b decreases by no more than 10% (see Fig. 14).\nFor our forecasts in Fig. 14, we used the publicly available forecasting software FisherLens7 [20], and considered a cosmological model with parameters\n7 https://github.com/ctrendafilova/FisherLens\n16\n{\u2126ch2,\u2126bh2, \u03b8s, \u03c4, As, ns, Neff} with fiducial values set to match the parameters determined by Planck [23]. Here, \u2126ch 2 is the physical cold dark matter density, \u2126bh 2 is the physical baryon density, \u03b8s is the angle subtended by the acoustic scale, \u03c4 is the Thomson optical depth to recombination, As is the primordial scalar fluctuation amplitude, and ns is the primordial scalar fluctuation slope. We define the information matrix with elements\ngiven by\nFij = \u2211 `1,`2 \u2211 WXY Z \u2202CXY`1 \u2202\u03bbi [ CovXY,WZ`1`2 ]\u22121 \u2202CWZ`2 \u2202\u03bbj . (33)\nwhere \u03bbi are the cosmological parameters. We include lensed TT , TE, EE, and dd spectra, where Cdd` = `(` + 1)C\u03c6\u03c6` is the lensing deflection spectrum. We set the range of multipoles considered in our analysis to ` \u2208 [30, 104] and describe our modelling of the foregrounds and noise in Appendix E. The covariances include the lensing-induced non-Gaussian contributions as introduced in Ref. [20], which we calculate using FisherLens. We set the sky fraction as fsky = 0.5. We also included a prior on \u03c4 with \u03c3\u03c4 = 0.007, similar to what has been achieved by Planck [101].\nAnother observable of the CMB power spectrum is the kSZ effect from reionization. In this paper we focussed our attention on the portion of the kSZ effect that is caused by the ionized gas in moving massive halos in the relatively recent universe, at z . 2, but CMB maps also contain the signatures of the kSZ effect during reionization at 6 . z . 12, originating mainly from the motions of ionized bubbles of the intergalactic medium as reionization progresses. The power spectrum of this effect has both the same spectral dependence (as a function of electromagnetic frequency) and a very similar power spectrum shape (as a function of `) as that of the latetime kSZ. Its amplitude is also expected to be comparable. If a significant fraction of the late-time kSZ could be removed using the methods that we have explored, this could in principle help isolate the earlier effect and\n17\nthereby reduce the resulting uncertainty on the duration of reionization, which is the property to which the kSZ power spectrum is most sensitive [e.g., 102\u2013104]. This would be achieved both by removing part of the highly degenerate signal power spectrum from low redshift, and, less significantly, by reducing the power spectrum variance. Finally, removing some of the late-time kSZ could help the search for signatures of reionization kSZ by using the four-point function [105]. Although one of the main advantages of this method is in helping to distinguish the late-time and reionization signals, reducing the late-time four-point signal by de-kSZing would only help in the use of this four-point method to study reionization in a new way."

In Fig. 16, we consider the moving-lens effect [13\u201315] as a concrete example. In the moving-lens effect, a halo with peculiar motion transverse to the line of sight creates a small-scale dipolar temperature anisotropy centered on the halo\u2019s location on the sky. If we use r\u22a5 to denote the transverse proper distance from the halo center, and define x\u22a5 \u2261 r\u22a5/rs where rs is the halo scale radius, the moving lens signal in the dimensionless CMB temperature \u0398 \u2261 \u2206T/TCMB is\n\u0398ML(x\u22a5) = \u2212a0vb,\u22a5 \u00b7M(x\u22a5) , (36)\nwhere vb,\u22a5 is the halo\u2019s transverse velocity.

The uncertainty bands in Fig. 16 are scaled to match the net uncertainty anticipated from measurements of 5 \u00d7 104 halos of the same mass at redshift z = 1, roughly representative of the number of cluster-size halos probed by recent and upcoming imaging surveys [111].

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this paper, we have explored the prospects for \u201cdekSZing\u201d the cosmic microwave background: constructing a template for the late-time kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect using a galaxy or 21 cm survey, and subtracting this template from observed CMB temperature maps. The template is constructed following the procedure from Refs. [27, 28, 33]: separate templates for the small-scale electron density and large-scale velocity field are formed by Wiener-filtering the observed galaxy density; these templates are combined into an estimate of the electron momentum field; and this combination is projected along the line of sight, using the theoretical kSZ redshift kernel, to form an estimate of kSZ-induced temperature fluctuations in the CMB. We have identified the properties of the input galaxy survey that most strongly determine the fidelity of the associated kSZ template: redshift and halo mass coverage (Sec. III A) and galaxy number density (Sec. III B).\nWe have also carried out detailed forecasts for a number of recent, upcoming, or proposed surveys, assessing the ability of each survey to provide a template that could be used for de-kSZing. Since redshift uncertainties in photometric surveys will significantly degrade the usefulness of such a template (Sec. III D), we have focused on spectroscopic and 21 cm surveys in our forecasts.\nThe combination of BOSS and several of DESI\u2019s planned samples could in principle yield a template that\ncaptures 10-20% of the total kSZ power, while templates derived from the H\u03b1 emission-line galaxy sample from the Roman Space Telescope or the Lyman-break galaxy sample from the proposed MegaMapper telescope can capture no more than 10% of the kSZ power at ` & 1500 (Fig. 9). Once foreground contamination is accounted for, our forecasts indicate that the proposed PUMA 21 cm intensity mapping survey can do no better than the combination of BOSS and DESI, although uncertainty in modelling of the 21 cm signal on small scales, along with the achievable level of foreground cleaning, makes this conclusion rather uncertain (Fig. 12). Table I provides representative numbers for the surveys we have considered.\nHowever, we emphasize that we have only performed an initial exploration of a specific de-kSZing procedure in this work, and we expect that alternative procedures can yield significant improvements to the results we have presented here. With this in mind, we have highlighted several applications of the idea of de-kSZing, all of which rely on the associated reduction of the small-scale variance in CMB temperature maps: better recovery of cosmological information from the CMB damping tail (Sec. V A); lower noise in measurements of CMB lensing at small scales, which can be used to test models for dark matter (Sec. V B 1); and more precise measurements of the moving-lens effect, which can be used to probe the cosmic growth rate and the properties of dark matter halos\n(Sec. V B 2). Motivated by these applications, there are several pathways towards an improved de-kSZing procedure that would be worth pursuing:\n\u2022 Different surveys (or combinations of surveys) could be used for the velocity and electron density templates, which would make better use of the properties of each survey. In particular, photometric redshift errors would be tolerable if a photometric survey was only used for the electron density template. As a concrete example, the LSST Y10 Gold lens sample is estimated9 to have a number density of 4\u00d7 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 for 0.5 < z < 2. Assuming that this sample is used for the electron template but that the velocity template comes from a sample with n\u0304g \u223c 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123, we infer from Figs. 4-5 that a de-kSZing efficiency of roughly 40% at ` > 3000 may be achievable. More detailed forecasts will be needed to confirm this conclusion, however.\n\u2022 Extra weights could be applied to the input galaxy survey to optimize the correlation of the kSZ template with the true kSZ fluctuations (in a statistical sense). For example, if halo mass estimates for each galaxy are available, different mass bins could be weighted differently (e.g. [112, 113]) in order to better account for the mass- and redshiftdependence of the kSZ signal (recall Fig. 1). The expected improvement would depend on the accuracy of the halo masses, which would determine the number of mass bins that could be used.\n9 This estimate is based on a total angular number density of 48 arcmin\u22122 over 18000 deg2, and a galaxy redshift distribution of dN/dz \u221d z2exp[\u2212(z/0.28)0.9] [62].\n20\n\u2022 Tomographic reconstruction of large-scale velocities using the kSZ effect [33, 35, 114\u2013121] could possibly be integrated into a de-kSZing procedure as a way to improve upon an external velocity template. This would have the advantage of constructing the velocity template from small-scale modes of the galaxy density (along with small-scale CMB temperature modes), but will introduce higher-point biases and noise contributions that would need to be accounted for, since the velocity template will then be quadratic (\u223c \u03b4sgT ) instead of linear (\u223c \u03b4sg). This procedure would be analogous to iterative delensing of CMB polarization [122].\n\u2022 Rather than viewing de-kSZing as a subtraction procedure, it may be possible to use Bayesian (e.g. [123]) or machine learning (e.g. [124, 125]) techniques to jointly estimate the statistics of the kSZ effect, the primary CMB, and/or other CMB secondaries. The former approach would allow for uncertainties in the procedure and data to be accounted for more systematically, while the latter may be able to exploit features of the kSZ signal (such as non-Gaussian information) that are not incorporated in our template construction. We note, however, that either approach would likely require\nsignificant computing power.\nWe leave these possibilities to future work."

II B is related to a product of filtered copies of an observed galaxy density contrast \u03b4g, and therefore the autocorrelation of the template is sensitive to the four-point function of \u03b4g. (For simplicity, we neglect the impact of redshift-space distortions in this appendix, and therefore use \u03b4g instead of \u03b4 s g.) This four-point function contains several contributions from the shot noise in \u03b4g; in Fourier space and for Poissonian shot noise, these contributions are given by (e.g. [40, 41])\n\u3008\u03b4g(k1)\u03b4g(k2)\u03b4g(k3)\u03b4g(k4)\u3009shot = (2\u03c0)3\u03b4D(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4) [S4 + S3,1 + S2,2 + S2,1,1] (A1)\nwhere\nS4 = 1\nn\u03043g ,\nS3,1 = 1\nn\u03042g [Pgg(k1) + Pgg(k2) + Pgg(k3) + Pgg(k4)] ,\nS2,2 = 1\nn\u03042g [Pgg(|k1 + k2|) + Pgg(|k1 + k3|) + Pgg(|k1 + k4|)] ,\nS2,1,1 = 1\nn\u0304g [Bggg(k1 + k2,k3,k4) +Bggg(k1 + k3,k2,k4) +Bggg(k1 + k4,k2,k3)\n+Bggg(k2 + k3,k1,k4) +Bggg(k2 + k4,k1,k3) +Bggg(k3 + k4,k1,k2)] (A2)\nand we have omitted the redshift-dependence and the arguments of the S functions for brevity. Each contribution arises from a different subset of points taken to be at zero lag in the position-space correlation function: S4 is when all four points are at the same spatial location; S3,1 is when three points are at the same location and one is elsewhere; S2,2 is when two pairs of points are each at the same location, but the pairs are not co-located; and S2,1,1 is when two points are at the same location, while the other two points are each at different locations.\n21\nThe power spectrum of the electron momentum template in Eq.

(A5)\nIn the squeezed limit (k\u20321, k \u2032 2 k1), many of these terms will integrate to zero in Eq. (A4), because they have no dependence on either \u00b5\u20321 or \u00b5 \u2032 2 but are integrated against \u00b5 \u2032 1\u00b5 \u2032 2. (Physically, this reflects the fact that the kSZ effect is sensitive to the line-of-sight component of the large-scale velocity, and the angular average of this is zero.) However, terms that involve the sum k\u20321 + k \u2032 2 may contribute non-negligibly. In particular, such terms involve power at larger scales than one might naively expect, because it is possible to have |k\u20321 + k\u20322| k\u20321, k\u20322 if k\u20321 and k\u20322 are similar in magnitude and anti-aligned.10\nIn Fig. 17, we evaluate the two dominant terms of this type in the squeezed limit, and compare them to the Gaussian contribution to Pq\u0302rq\u0302r .

(A8)\nWe evaluate the various power spectra using the halo model framework described in the main text and Appendix B, for each of the spectroscopic surveys considered in Sec. IV A. We numerically compute Eqs. (A6) and (A7) using the Monte Carlo integration algorithm described in Ref. [126], as implemented in the vegas Python package [127].\nFor most of the surveys we consider, these shot noise contributions are below 25% of the Gaussian contribution at ` = 2000 and below 40% at ` = 8000. (A noteworthy exception is the \u201cshot,B\u201d contribution for the DESI BGS\n10 In Ref. [41], these terms were found to significantly affect the precision with which long-wavelength modes of \u03b4g can be reconstructed with a quadratic estimator.\n22\nsample, which strongly increases at the higher-redshift edge of the BGS sample, z \u2248 0.4, at ` = 8000; this is caused by the decreasing number density of the BGS sample at this redshift, combined with the overall higher amplitude of the galaxy bispectrum in the BGS redshift range compared to the higher redshifts covered by the other surveys.) These numbers can be interpreted as upper bounds on the amount of power in a kSZ template that arises from shot noise in the galaxy sample instead of reconstructed kSZ signal. Future modelling related to applications of de-kSZing will need to account for this.\nAppendix B: Details of halo model\nIn this appendix, we provide more details of the halo model approach we use to model quantities related to spectroscopic surveys. The galaxy power spectrum, electron power spectra, integrand of the kSZ angular power spectrum (see Eq. 21), and galaxy bispectrum are discussed in Sec. B 1, B 2, B 3, and B 4 respectively. For brevity, we have omitted redshift arguments in Sec. B 1, B 2, and B 4.\n1. Galaxy power spectrum\nOur formalism is based on Ref. [33]. The galaxy power spectrum is a sum of two-halo, one-halo, and shot noise terms,\nPgg(k, \u00b5) = P 2h gg (k, \u00b5) + P 1h gg (k) + P shot gg . (B1)\nAs stated in the main text, we do not include Finger of God damping in our computations, and therefore the one-halo term has no \u00b5-dependence.11 The two-halo term is given by\nP 2hgg (k, \u00b5) = [ bg(k) + f\u00b5 2 ]2 Plin(k) , (B2)\n11 See Ref. [128] for a formalism that consistently includes the Finger of God effect in a halo model framework.\n23\nwhere Plin is the linear matter power spectrum and the prefactor incorporates the leading effect of redshift space distortions at large scales. The linear bias bg is given by\nbg(k) = 1\nn\u0304g\n\u222b dmh n(mh)bh(mh) [ N\u0304c(mh) + N\u0304s(mh)us(k,mh) ] (B3)\nwhere n(mh) is the halo mass function, bh(mh) is the halo bias, N\u0304c and N\u0304s are the mean central and satellite occupation numbers, us is the Fourier transform of the assumed profile of satellite galaxies, and the mean galaxy number density n\u0304g is\nn\u0304g = \u222b dmh n(mh) [ N\u0304c(mh) + N\u0304s(mh) ] . (B4)\nThe one-halo term is\nP 1hgg (k) = 1\nn\u03042g\n\u222b dmh n(mh) [ 2 \u3008Nc(mh)Ns(mh)\u3009us(k,mh) + \u3008Ns(mh)[Ns(mh)\u2212 1]\u3009us(k,mh)2 ] . (B5)\nThe expectation values of halo occupation numbers depend on what is assumed about correlations between numbers of central and satellite galaxies within a given halo. We use the \u201cminimally correlated\u201d assumption from Ref. [33], in which the central and satellite occupation numbers are independent Poisson random variables; this yields\n\u3008Nc(mh)Ns(mh)\u3009 = N\u0304c(mh)N\u0304s(mh) , \u3008Ns(mh)[Ns(mh)\u2212 1]\u3009 = N\u0304s(mh)2 . (B6)\nIn specific HOD models where a central-satellite correlation is assumed, we implement this correlation by including N\u0304c(mh) as a prefactor in the model for N\u0304s(mh), ensuring that N\u0304s = 0 if N\u0304c = 0 at a given halo mass.\nFinally, the shot noise term is given by\nP shotgg = 1\nn\u0304g . (B7)\n2. Electron power spectra\nIn this paper, as in Ref. [33], we assume that free electrons trace the gas within halos, such that we can describe electron distributions using the standard halo model for matter, but with the matter density profile replaced with the gas profile. The electron density power spectrum is then given by\nPee(k) = P 2h ee (k) + P 1h ee (k) , (B8)\nwith\nP 2hee (k) = [\u222b dmh n(mh)bh(mh)\nmh \u03c1\u0304m ugas(k,mh)\n]2 Plin(k) (B9)\nand\nP 1hee (k) = \u222b dmh n(mh) ( mh \u03c1\u0304m )2 |ugas(k,mh)|2 . (B10)\nSimilarly, the galaxy-electron cross power spectrum is\nPge(k, \u00b5) = P 2h ge (k, \u00b5) + P 1h ge (k) , (B11)\nwith\nP 2hge (k, \u00b5) = [ bg(k) + f\u00b5\n2 ] [\u222b\ndmh n(mh)bh(mh) mh \u03c1\u0304m ugas(k,mh)\n] Plin(k) (B12)\n24\nand\nP 1hge (k) = \u222b dmh n(mh)\nmh \u03c1\u0304m ugas(k,mh) N\u0304c(mh) + N\u0304s(mh)us(k,mh) n\u0304g . (B13)\nNote that these quantities refer to the correlation between the observed galaxy density (which is affected by redshift space distortions) and the \u201ctrue\u201d electron density (which has no RSD contribution).\n3. Integrand of kSZ angular power spectrum\nIt\u2019s helpful to rewrite CkSZ` as an integral over redshift and halo mass, so that we can compare the relative contributions from different ranges of these two quantities (see Fig. 1). Combining Eqs. (6) and (8), and changing variables from \u03c7 to z, we can write\nCkSZ` = \u222b z\u2217 0 dz d\u03c7 dz 1 \u03c7[z]2 K\u0303(z)2 1 6\u03c02 [\u222b dkL k 2 LPvv(kL; z) ] Pee ( `+ 1/2 \u03c7[z] ; z ) . (B14)\nWe can further rewrite Pee as\nPee(k; z) = \u222b d logmhmh ( dP 2hee (k; z)\ndmh + dP 1hee (k; z) dmh\n) (B15)\nwith\ndP 2hee (k; z)\ndmh = 2n(mh)bh(mh) mh \u03c1\u0304m ugas(k,mh) [\u222b mh mh,min dm\u2032h n(m \u2032 h)bh(m \u2032 h) m\u2032h \u03c1\u0304m ugas(k,m \u2032 h) ] Plin(k) , (B16)\ndP 1hee (k; z)\ndmh = n(mh) ( mh \u03c1\u0304m )2 |ugas(k,mh)|2 . (B17)\nThus, we can finally write\nCkSZ` = \u222b z\u2217 0 dz \u222b d logmh d2CkSZ` dz d logmh\n(B18)\nwith\nd2CkSZ` dz d logmh = d\u03c7 dz 1 \u03c7[z]2 K\u0303(z)2 1 6\u03c02\n[\u222b dkL k 2 LPvv(kL; z) ] mh ( dP 2hee (k; z)\ndmh + dP 1hee (k; z) dmh\n) , (B19)\nand the terms in parentheses given by Eqs. (B16)-(B17).\n4. Galaxy bispectrum\nTo compute the shot noise contribution to the power spectrum of a kSZ template, we also need to compute the galaxy bispectrum (see Appendix A). This is a function of three 3d wavevectors (k1,k2,k3) constrained such that k1 + k2 + k3 = 0; in the absence of redshift space distortions (which we ignore for simplicity), the resulting triangle can be specified by 3 numbers, which we choose to be the magnitudes of each wavevector. The halo model description of the galaxy bispectrum can then be written as (e.g. [129])\nBggg(k1, k2, k3) = B 3h ggg(k1, k2, k3) +B 2h ggg(k1, k2, k3) +B 1h ggg(k1, k2, k3) . (B20)\nThere is also a shot noise contribution, but we do not require this for our calculations in Appendix A, so we have not written it above.\nThe three-halo term is\nB3hggg(k1, k2, k3) = beff(k1)beff(k2)beff(k3)Btree(k1, k2, k3) , (B21)\n25\nwhere the matter bispectrum at leading order (\u201ctree-level\u201d) in perturbation theory is\nBtree(k1,k2,k3) = 2F2(k1,k2)Plin(k1)Plin(k2) + 2 perms (B22)\nand the symmetrized F2 kernel is\nF2(k1,k2) = 5\n7 +\n1 2 k\u03021 \u00b7 k\u03022 ( k1 k2 + k2 k1 ) + 2 7 ( k\u03021 \u00b7 k\u03022 )2 . (B23)\nThe two-halo term is\nB2hggg(k1, k2, k3) =\n[ 1\nn\u03042g\n\u222b dmh n(mh)bh(mh) { \u3008Nc(mh)Ns(mh)\u3009 (us(k1,mh) + us(k2,mh))\n+ \u3008Ns(mh) [Ns(mh)\u2212 1]\u3009us(k1,mh)us(k2,mh) }] beff(k3)Plin(k3) + 2 perms , (B24)\nwhile the one-halo term is\nB1hggg(k1, k2, k3) = 1\nn\u03043g\n\u222b dmh n(mh) { \u3008Nc(mh)Ns(mh)(Ns(mh)\u2212 1)\u3009 (us(k1,mh)us(k2,mh) + 2 perms)\n+ \u3008Ns(mh)(Ns(mh)\u2212 1)(Ns(mh)\u2212 2)\u3009us(k1,mh)us(k2,mh)us(k3,mh) } . (B25)\nFor independent Poisson-distributed numbers of centrals and satellites, the expectation values in Eq. (B25) are given by\n\u3008Nc(mh)Ns(mh)(Ns(mh)\u2212 1)\u3009 = N\u0304c(mh)N\u0304s(mh)2 , \u3008Ns(mh)(Ns(mh)\u2212 1)(Ns(mh)\u2212 2)\u3009 = N\u0304s(mh)3 . (B26)\nAppendix C: Halo occupation modelling\nIn this section, we record the details of the HOD models used for the survey-specific forecasts in Sec. IV. Note that we write parameters with dimension of mass either in h\u22121M or M units, depending on what was used in the original reference, but we translate all parameters to M units in our numerical computations in this work.\n1. BOSS\nFor BOSS, we use the following 5-parameter HOD from Ref. [56]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = 1\n2\n[ 1 + erf ( logmh \u2212 logMmin\n\u03c3logM\n)] , (C1)\nN\u0304s(mh) = N\u0304c(mh)\n( M\nM1\n)\u03b1 e\u2212Mcut/mh , (C2)\nwith the best-fit parameter values from the joint fit to the projected correlation function (wp) and void probability function (P0):\nMmin = 10 13.18 h\u22121M , \u03c3logM = 0.55 , M1 = 10 14.28 h\u22121M , \u03b1 = 1.12 , Mcut = 10 4.87 h\u22121M . (C3)\n26\n2. DESI BGS\nFor the DESI BGS sample, we use the HOD from Ref. [55] with the assumption that the scatter set by the \u03c3logM parameter is Gaussian:\nN\u0304c(mh) = 1\n2\n[ 1 + erf ( logmh \u2212R logMmin\n\u03c3logM\n)] , (C4)\nN\u0304s(mh) = N\u0304c(mh)\n( mh \u2212M0\n(M \u20321) R\n)\u03b1 , (C5)\nwith fitted parameter values corresponding to absolute r-band magnitude 0.1Mr \u2212 5 log h = \u221220.5:\nMmin = 10 12.2 h\u22121M , \u03c3logM = 0.15 , M \u2032 1 = 10 13.5 h\u22121M , \u03b1 = 1.05 , M0 = 10 12 h\u22121M . (C6)\nWe fix R by demanding that the n\u0304g expression in Eq. (B4) evaluates to the value computed from Table 2.5 of Ref. [63] over 0.05 \u2264 z \u2264 0.45. The resulting R values are well fit by R(z) = 0.88 + 0.23z + 0.76z2.\n3. DESI LRG\nFor the DESI LRG sample, we use the HOD from Ref. [51]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = fic 2 erfc\n( R logMcut \u2212 logmh\u221a\n2\u03c3logM\n) , (C7)\nN\u0304s(mh) = N\u0304c(mh)\n( mh \u2212 \u03baMcut\nMR1\n)\u03b1 , (C8)\nwith\nMcut = 10 12.7 h\u22121M , \u03c3logM = 0.2 , M1 = 10 13.6 h\u22121M , \u03b1 = 1.15 , \u03ba = 0.08 , fic = 0.8 . (C9)\nWe fix R such that n\u0304g evaluates to the target density of 5\u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123 quoted in Ref. [51] over 0.6 \u2264 z \u2264 1.1. The resulting R values are well fit by R(z) = 1.05\u2212 0.033z.\n4. DESI ELG\nFor the DESI ELG sample, we use the HOD from Ref. [51]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = R { 2A\u03c6(logmh)\u03a6(logmh) + 1\n2Q\n[ 1 + erf ( logmh \u2212 logMcut\n0.01\n)]} , (C10)\nN\u0304s(mh) = R\n( mh \u2212 \u03baMcut\nM1\n)\u03b1 , (C11)\nwhere\n\u03c6(logmh) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c32M exp\n[ \u2212 (logmh \u2212 logMcut) 2\n2\u03c32M\n] , (C12)\n\u03a6(logmh) = 1\n2\n[ 1 + erf ( \u03b3\nlogmh \u2212 logMcut\u221a 2\u03c3M\n)] , (C13)\nA = pmax \u2212 1\nQ (C14)\n27\nand\npmax = 0.075 , Q = 95 , Mcut = 10 11.9 h\u22121M , \u03c3M = 0.5 , \u03b3 = 5 , M1 = 10 14.2 h\u22121M , \u03b1 = 0.65 , \u03ba = 1.35 . (C15) We use R = 1 for our baseline modelling, but in cases where we wish to ensure that the predicted number density matches a desired input, we fix R appropriately at each redshift.\n5. DESI QSO\nFor the DESI QSO sample, we use the error-function\u2013based HOD from Ref. [49]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = 1\n2 pmaxerfc\n( R logMc \u2212 logmh\u221a\n2 log(e)\u03c3M\n) , (C16)\nN\u0304s(mh) =\n( mh \u2212 \u03baMc\n(M \u20321) R\n)\u03b1 , (C17)\nwith\nMc = 10 12.21 h\u22121M , \u03c3M = 0.6 , M1 = 10 14.09 h\u22121M , \u03ba = 1.0 , \u03b1 = 0.39 , pmax = 0.033 . (C18)\nWe fix R such that n\u0304g evaluates to the QSO density given in Ref. [63] over 0.65 \u2264 z \u2264 1.85. The resulting R values are well fit by R(z) = 1.16\u2212 0.040z.\n6. Roman\nFor the H\u03b1 sample of ELGs from the Roman High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey, we fit the following parameterized model to measurements from the mock catalog in Ref. [70]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = R { A1 exp [ \u2212 (logmh \u2212 logMc) 2\n2\u03c32logM\n] +A2 [ 1 + erf ( logmh \u2212 logMc\n\u03c3logM\n)]} ,\nN\u0304s(mh) =  RA2 ( mh M1 )\u03b11 , mh < M1 ,\nRA2 ( mh M1 )\u03b12 , mh \u2265M1 .\n(C19)\nThe central occupation is composed of a peak with amplitude A1 at mh = Mc and a smooth transition to a plateau with amplitude 2A2 at higher masses, while the satellite occupation is a broken power law with tilt \u03b11 for mh < M1 and \u03b12 for mh \u2265 M1. Note that the measured HODs from Ref. [70] typically have a double-peaked structure as a function of halo mass, but the higher-mass peak is typically weaker and its physical origin is somewhat unclear, so our parameterization only incorporates the lower-mass peak. We fix the free parameters to approximately match the measurements shown in Figure 8 of Ref. [70] for 1.0 < z < 1.1, AV = 1.65, flin,1 = 10\n\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122, and flin,2R = 0.5, resulting in\nA1 = 0.2 , A2 = 0.01 , Mc = 11.9M , \u03c3logM = 0.2 , M1 = 12.3M , \u03b11 = 2.5 , \u03b12 = 0.5 . (C20)\nWe fix R by such that the predicted galaxy number density matches that from Ref. [69] corresponding to fluxes > 1016 erg s\u22121cm\u22122 and dust attenuation parameter AV = 1.65. The resulting R values are well fit by R(z) = 5.41\u2212 2.77z.\n28\n7. MegaMapper\nFor the MegaMapper LBG sample, we use the \u201clinear HOD model\u201d from Ref. [73]:\nN\u0304c(mh) = 1\n2\n[ 1 + erf ( logmh \u2212 logMmin\u221a\n2\u03c3logM\n)] , (C21)\nN\u0304s(mh) = N\u0304c(mh)\n( mh \u2212Mcut\nMsat\n)\u03b1 . (C22)\nWe use the best-fit parameters corresponding to z \u2248 3.8 with mthUV = 24.5:\nMmin = Mcut = 10 12.22M , \u03c3logM = 0.2 , Msat = 10 14.23M , \u03b1 = 1.0 . (C23)\nNote that we have chosen to set Mcut equal to Mmin, which differs from the choice made in Ref. [73], but the precise value of Mcut has a minimal impact on our results.\nAppendix D: Modelling for 21 cm intensity mapping\nIn this appendix, we provide the details of our approach to modelling 21 cm observations of large-scale structure.\n1. Halo model\na. Formalism\nThe halo model framework we use for modelling the distribution of HI generally follows that in Appendix B, with a few differences adapted from the formalism in Ref. [128]. HI halo models are often written as predictions for the statistics of the observed brightness temperature, but for consistency with our other forecasts, we write predictions for the HI overdensity instead of the brightness temperature fluctuations. In this approach, the halo occupation functions N\u0304c(mh) and N\u0304s(mh) are replaced by a HI mass-halo mass relation mHI(mh), and a HI-specific halo density profile uHI is used, such that the linear bias from Eq. (B3) transforms into\nbHI(k) = 1\n\u03c1\u0304HI\n\u222b dmh n(mh)bh(mh)mHI(mh)uHI(k,mh) (D1)\nand the one-halo term from Eq. (B5) becomes\nP 1hHI (k) = 1\n\u03c1\u03042HI\n\u222b dmh n(mh)mHI(mh) 2uHI(k,mh) 2 , (D2)\nwhere\n\u03c1\u0304HI = \u222b dmh n(mh)mHI(mh) . (D3)\nNote that the two-halo term in Eq. (B2) retains the same form.\nb. HI mass-halo mass relation\nFor the HI mass-halo mass relation mHI(mh, z), we consider two fitting functions from the literature. The first is from Ref. [52], and has been fit to measurements of HI from the IllustrisTNG simulations:\nmHI(mh) = m0 ( mh mmin )\u03b1 exp [ \u2212 ( mmin mh )0.35] , (D4)\n29\nwith the best-fit \u201cFoF-SO\u201d values for \u03b1, m0, and mmin listed for z = 0 to 5 in their Table 1.\nThe second is from Ref. [82], and has been fit to a variety of HI observations (resolved low-redshift galaxies, intensity-mapping determinations of the mean HI density, and higher-redshift damped Lyman-\u03b1 absorbers):\nmHI(mh, z) = \u03b1fH,cmh\n( mh\n1011h\u22121M\n)\u03b2 exp [ \u2212 (\nvc,0 vc(mh, z)\n)3] , (D5)\nwith fH,c = \u2126b(1\u2212 Yp)/\u2126m, halo virial velocity vc(mh) given by\nvc(mh, z) =\n\u221a Gmh\nrvir(mh, z) , (D6)\nand best-fit parameters\n\u03b1 = 0.09 , log ( vc,0\nkm s\u22121\n) = 1.56 , \u03b2 = \u22120.58 . (D7)\nc. HI density profile\nLikewise, we consider two forms of the HI density profile. The first, which we use for our main computations, is from Ref. [52]:\n\u03c1HI(r,mh, z) = \u03c10 r\u03b1\u2217 exp ( \u2212r0 r ) , (D8)\nusing the best-fit parameters for z = 0 to 5 and m = 109h\u22121M to 10 15h\u22121M listed in their Table 2. We numerically evaluate a fast Fourier transform of this profile to obtain uHI(k,mh, z).\nThe second profile is from Ref. [82]:\n\u03c1HI(r,mh, z) = \u03c10(mh, z) exp ( \u2212 r rs(mh, z) ) , (D9)\nwith halo scale radius rs(mh, z) = rvir(mh, z)/cHI(mh, z) using an HI-specific concentration-mass relation:\ncHI(mh, z) = cHI,0\n( mh\n1011M\n)\u22120.109 4\n(1 + z)\u03b3 , (D10)\nwith\ncHI,0 = 28.65 , \u03b3 = 1.45 . (D11)\nThe normalization \u03c10(mh, z) is fixed so that the HI mass enclosed within the virial radius is equal to mHI(mh, z). In Fourier space, the normalized profile uHI is then given by\nuHI(k,mh, z) = 2\n[1 + k2rs(mh, z)2]2 . (D12)\nIn Appendix D 4, we compare the results if either of these profiles is used.\n2. Instrumental noise\nIn 21 cm intensity mapping, the dominant noise in measurements of the power spectrum is typically the instrumental noise associated with finite observing time and properties of the instrument, rather than the intrinsic shot noise of 21 cm-emitting objects. Thus, we replace the shot power term in Eq. (12) with an \u201ceffective\u201d shot noise that includes\n30\nboth instrumental and Poisson contributions:\nP shot,effHI (k\u22a5, z) = PN(k\u22a5, z)\nT\u0304HI(z)2 +\n1\nnHI(z) . (D13)\nThe instrumental noise PN is associated with 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations, such that dividing it by T\u0304HI(z)\n2 converts into the noise power spectrum associated with the HI overdensity. We compute the noise power spectrum for PUMA, mean brightness temperature, and intrinsic shot noise as described in the appendices of Ref. [78] and implemented in the PUMANoise code12. From Eq. D13, we can define an effective number density n\u0304eff(k\u22a5, z) \u2261 P shot,effHI (k\u22a5, z) \u22121, which we plot in Fig. 11.\n3. Foregrounds\nThe need to remove bright foregrounds, dominated by Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic radio sources, from 21 cm observations is expected to impose two restrictions on the modes that are available for cosmological analysis13:\n1. Modes with |k\u2016| < k\u2016min will be indistinguishable from smooth-spectrum foregrounds, and will therefore be filtered out. We use k\u2016min = 0.03 Mpc, following Ref. [131], who found that an optimal foreground cleaning\napproach imposed k\u2016min \u2248 0.02h\u22121 Mpc when applied to simulations.\n2. In interferometric observations, spectrally-smooth foreground power will leak beyond pure low-k\u2016 modes into higher-k\u2016 modes in a baseline-dependent way, creating a so-called \u201cforeground wedge\u201d of contamination (e.g. [84\u2013 86]). This is described by by |k\u2016| < \u03b2(z)k\u22a5 where\n\u03b2(z) \u2261 \u03c7(z)H(z) c(1 + z) sin \u03b8w(z) . (D14)\nThe extent of the contamination is set by \u03b8w(z), the maximum angle away from the receiver\u2019s phase center at which a spectrally smooth sky signal can contaminate higher-k\u2016 modes. Following Ref. [78], we set this to 3 times the width of the PUMA primary beam, i.e. \u03b8w(z) = 3 \u00d7 1.2\u03bb(z)/Deff , with \u03bb(z) \u2261 21(1 + z) cm and Deff = 5 m. We explore our sensitivity to this choice, and the choice of k\u2016min, in Appendix D 4.\nThese restrictions will apply separately to templates for velocity and electron density fields constructed from 21 cm observations. However, the total kSZ template is constructed from the product of these templates (recall Eqs. 10-11 and 13), which becomes a convolution in Fourier space:\nq\u0302r(kS, z) = \u222b kL \u03b7(kL, z) (kS \u2212 kL, z) . (D15)\nThus, low-k\u2016 modes of q\u0302r(kS, z) are not obscured by foregrounds, since they can be sourced by pairs of \u03b7 and modes whose line-of-sight wavenumbers are individually much larger (i.e. it is possible that |kS\u2016| < k\u2016min while having |kL\u2016| and |kS\u2016 \u2212 kL\u2016| both greater than k\u2016min). We will omit redshift arguments in what follows.\nTo implement these foreground restrictions in computations, we start by recalling the cross power spectrum of q\u0302r and qr from Eq. (15), prior to taking the squeezed limit of Pe (the discussion below also applies to the auto spectrum of q\u0302r):\nPq\u0302rqr(kS) \u2248 \u222b\nd3kL (2\u03c0)3 Pvr\u03b7(kL)Pe (kS \u2212 kL) . (D16)\n12 https://github.com/slosar/PUMANoise 13 We note that observational and methodological work is underway to understand in more detail which modes will be eliminated by\n21 cm foreground cleaning and how to incorporate this into forecasts (e.g. [130]), but in this work we adopt assumptions which have been motivated by previous studies [79]. We also note that reconstruction techniques are under development which could allow for the recovery of foreground-obscured modes (e.g. [41, 89, 90]), but such reconstructed modes will have different noise than directly-observed modes, so we only consider directly-observed modes in this work.\n31\nWe must set the integrand to zero outside of the region defined by the union of the following four conditions:\n|kL\u2016| > k\u2016min , |kL\u2016 \u2212 kS\u2016| > k\u2016min , |kL\u2016| > \u03b2kL\u22a5 , |kS\u2016 \u2212 kL\u2016| > \u03b2|kS\u22a5 \u2212 kL\u22a5| . (D17)\nWith kL\u2016 = kL\u00b5L and kL\u22a5 = kL \u221a\n1\u2212 \u00b52L and analogously for kS, and also defining cos\u03c6\u22a5 \u2261 k\u0302S\u22a5 \u00b7 k\u0302L\u22a5, the fourth condition can be written as cos\u03c6\u22a5 > \u03b3(kS, \u00b5S; kL, \u00b5L), where\n\u03b3(kS, \u00b5S; kL, \u00b5L) \u2261 \u03b22 [ (1\u2212 \u00b52S)k2S + (1\u2212 \u00b52L)k2L ] \u2212 (\u00b5SkS \u2212 \u00b5LkL)2\n2\u03b22 \u221a 1\u2212 \u00b52S \u221a 1\u2212 \u00b52LkSkL . (D18)\nWe can integrate this constraint out of Eq. (D16) by approximating Pe (kS \u2212 kL) \u2248 Pe (kS) and using\nC\u22a5(kS, \u00b5S; kL, \u00b5L) \u2261 \u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nd\u03c6\u22a5\u0398(cos\u03c6\u22a5 \u2212 \u03b3) =  2\u03c0 , \u03b3 \u2264 \u22121 ,2 cos\u22121 \u03b3 , \u22121 < \u03b3 < 1 ,0 , \u03b3 \u2265 1 , (D19) where \u0398(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) is a step function. Meanwhile, the first three conditions in Eq. (D17) are equivalent to setting the integrand to zero if any of the following conditions are satisfied:\n|\u00b5L| < k\u2016min\nkL , |kL\u00b5L \u2212 kS\u00b5S| < k\u2016min , |\u00b5L| < \u03b2\u221a 1 + \u03b22 , (D20)\nand we enforce these numerically when evaluating Eq. (D16).\nFinally, we compute C q\u0302rqr` in the Limber approximation, which requires taking the \u00b5S \u2192 0 limit of Eq. (D16):\nP 21cmq\u0302rqr (kS, 0) = 1\n8\u03c03\n\u222b dkL k 2 L \u222b 1 \u22121 d\u00b5L \u00b5 2 L Pgv(kL, \u00b5L) 2 P totgg (kL, \u00b5L) Pge(kS, 0) 2 P totgg (kS, 0) C\u22a5(kS, 0; kL, \u00b5L) C\u2016(kS, 0; kL, \u00b5L) , (D21)\nwhere C\u2016(kS, \u00b5S; kL, \u00b5L) implements the conditions in Eq. (D20). Note that we take the \u00b5S \u2192 0 limit after accounting for foreground mode cuts as described above, and therefore we only consider modes of q\u0302r that survive these cuts.\n4. Dependence of forecasts on HI profile and foreground cuts\nIn Fig. 18, we compare kSZ template forecasts assuming the simulation-based HI profile from Ref. [52] with those assuming the exponential profile from Ref. [82]. We find that this choice does not qualitatively change the results: in particular, we see a negligible change at ` . 2000 that becomes more important at larger multipoles, with as much as a 10% (15%) change in the results for PUMA-32k (PUMA-5k) at ` \u223c 4000, and a 30% (70%) change at ` \u223c 10000. This uncertainty in our forecasts is subdominant to that from the uncertain form of the mHI(mh) relation (this uncertainty is also lower at lower multipoles).\nIn Fig. 19, we explore how our forecasts depend on assumptions about 21 cm foregrounds. Each column corresponds to a different choice of k\u2016min, while the different linestyles for the grey curves denote different assumptions about the foreground wedge: an angular extent of 3 times the primary beam width of a single 6 m dish, 1 times the primary beam width (a more optimistic case), or the full sky visible above the horizon (a more pessimistic case). Between the most optimistic and pessimistic assumptions for the grey curves, we find roughly an order of magnitude variation at ` \u223c 1000 and a factor of 5 at ` \u223c 10000, indicating that the performance of a 21 cm-based kSZ template will be very sensitive to the level of foreground cleaning.\nAppendix E: CMB Forecasts\nWe model the CMB noise including the pink and white noise components as\nN` = \u2206 2 T exp\n[ `(`+ 1)\n\u03b82FWHM 8 log(2)\n] [1 + (`knee/`) \u03b1knee ] (E1)\nwhere we set the beam full-width half-maximum (FWHM), the temperature noise RMS \u2206T , and the {\u03b1knee, `knee} parameters which model the effect of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to match upcoming experiments as given in Table II.\n32\nThe contributions to the signal in the millimeter wavelength include clustered CIB, Poisson CIB and tSZ foregrounds, and the black-body late-time kSZ following Ref. [132] based on fits to data from Ref. [133]. We do not include the correlation between tSZ and CIB. We also include radio sources in the 39, 93 and 145 GHz channels, using the flux-limit-dependent radio-source power model from Ref. [134]. For CMB-S4, we assume flux limits of 10, 7 and 10 mJy, respectively in those channels. For CMB-HD, we assume flux limits of 2, 1 and 1 mJy respectively. In addition, we include the lensed CMB black-body contribution which we calculate using CAMB [135], and the kSZ signal from reionization following Ref. [94].\nWe calculate the total covariance between two frequency channels at each multipole `, Cij` , taking into account the signal components correlated across frequencies, as well as the uncorrelated beam-deconvolved noise, indexed by i. The resulting minimum-variance standard ILC noise for the black-body signal (lensed CMB+kSZ) including all other contributions is then given by\nN` = [\u2211 ij ( C\u22121 )ij ` ]\u22121 . (E2)\n33\nAppendix F: Forecasts for moving-lens signal\nRef. [14] derives an optimal matched filter for measuring transverse velocities with the moving-lens effect, assuming a known form for the halo density profile. In Sec. V B 2, we present a forecast that uses a modified form of this procedure to obtain binned information about the moving-lens profile (and therefore the halo density profile) itself. The impact of the moving-lens effect on the CMB has been written in Eqs. (36) to (39).\nIn the form derived in Ref. [14], an optimal filter \u03a8\u0303i for the moving-lens signal along transverse direction i is given by\n\u03a8\u0303i(~\u0300) = \u03c3i M\u0303i(~\u0300) C\u0303TT` , (F1)\nwhere i is either of two unit vectors, which we call x\u0302 and y\u0302, which span the x\u22a5 plane. We have writtenMx = x\u0302 \u00b7M and My = y\u0302 \u00b7M. The measurement noise \u03c3i is given by\n\u03c3i = a \u22122 0\n\u222b d2`\n(2\u03c0)2 |\u03a8\u0303i(`)|2C\u0303TT` . (F2)\nIn our binned forecasts, we use the same approach, but for a bin centered at x\u22a5j , we suppose that we have applied a circular ring mask Rj(x\u22a5) with outer (inner) radius x\u22a5j + \u2206x\u22a5/2 (x\u22a5j \u2212 \u2206x\u22a5/2) around the halo center, such that M\u0303i(`) in the numerator of Eq. (F1) is the harmonic transform of Rj(x\u22a5)Mi(x\u22a5) instead of Mi(x\u22a5). We then compute the modified measurement noise using Eq. (F2), taking \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c3x = \u03c3y. Our results are demonstrated in\n34\nFig. 16.\n[1] Y. B. Zeldovich and R. A. Sunyaev, Astrophys. Space Sci. 4, 301 (1969). [2] R. A. Sunyaev and Y. B. Zeldovich, Comments Astrophys.
