    "abstractText": "Purpose: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a challenge for adolescents in China. This study aimed to explore the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem in Chinese candidates preparing for the college entrance examination during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the mechanism of mediating effect of self-regulated learning ability. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 293 college entrance examination candidates (including 170 females) from two middle schools in China using a voluntary, web-based, and anonymous questionnaire implemented via the Questionnaire Star app during COVID-19 prevalence in 2020. Results: This study found that 1) students in the high and low academic anxiety groups had different levels of self-regulated learning ability and self-esteem, 2) the academic anxiety, self-regulated learning ability, and self-esteem levels of students were significantly correlated and 3) after controlling the two independent variables of gender and subject type, academic anxiety had a significant negative predictive effect on self-esteem, and self-regulated learning ability played a mediating role between academic anxiety and self-esteem, where the mediating effect was 18.6%. Conclusion: Based on the observations of the present study, self-regulated learning capacity was a mediator between academic anxiety and self-esteem. These findings suggest an underlying process by which low academic anxiety may increase self-esteem in candidates preparing for the college entrance examination by increasing self-regulated learning ability.",

Results: This study found that 1) students in the high and low academic anxiety groups had different levels of self-regulated learning ability and self-esteem, 2) the academic anxiety, self-regulated learning ability, and self-esteem levels of students were significantly correlated and 3) after controlling the two independent variables of gender and subject type, academic anxiety had a significant negative predictive effect on self-esteem, and self-regulated learning ability played a mediating role between academic anxiety and self-esteem, where the mediating effect was 18.6%. Conclusion: Based on the observations of the present study, self-regulated learning capacity was a mediator between academic anxiety and self-esteem. These findings suggest an underlying process by which low academic anxiety may increase self-esteem in candidates preparing for the college entrance examination by increasing self-regulated learning ability.

            "text": "The candidates for the college entrance examination always attract enormous social attention. Faced with the challenge of entering a higher school and the expectations of their families and teachers, such candidates are often under great psychological pressure. According to a large sample survey in China, the main source of pressure for high school students is the good grades required to enter a higher school.1 Under the effect of internal and external pressures, these students often undergo negative emotions such as academic anxiety,2 which refers to an emotional state in which the individual cannot overcome difficulties or reach the goal.3 During the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, schools in various regions of China could not open normally, and students who were in the second semester of senior high school of grade 3 had to study online at home as they were preparing for the college entrance examination. The main purpose of physical distancing is to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it can cause isolation, loneliness, and even mental health problems.4 This could also have exacerbated the academic anxiety of some students, especially those who were probably lacking self-control and eager to succeed.5,6\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 2383\u20132390 2383 \u00a9 2022 Wu et al.

In addition, the existing research shows that anxiety is negatively correlated with internal motivation and positively correlated with external motivation,12 Meanwhile, self-regulated learning ability focuses on describing the individual internal motivation for learning. Self-regulated learning is to monitor individual learning motivation and execute the learning process.13 As stress is unavoidable in one\u2019s life, self-regulation is essential for effective coping and developing healthy emotions.4 The self-regulated learning ability of individuals with high anxiety may be relatively weak. In addition, senior high school students display more explicit internal motivation and self-regulated learning ability than junior high school and primary school students.14 Self-regulated learning ability can also play a good role in promoting the effectiveness of online learning.15,16\nIt is evident from previous research that academic anxiety can affect individual self-esteem and self-regulated learning ability.8 Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that self-regulated learning ability may be the mediator between academic anxiety and self-esteem. This study was intended to test this mediating relationship. A questionnaire survey was adopted to explore the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem of college entrance examination candidates and determine the role of self-regulated learning ability in the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem during COVID-19. This study aimed to better understand the status of academic anxiety among students, provide a reference for psychological counseling for students, and expand the field of research on the mental health of these students. We hypothesized that. 1) academic anxiety of college entrance examination candidates had a significant negative predictive effect on self-esteem. 2) there was a significant correlation between academic anxiety, self-regulated learning ability, and self-esteem. 3) self-regulated learning ability played a mediating role between academic anxiety and self-esteem."

Firstly, the participants of this study were students who were about to participate in the college entrance examination. They belonged to a special population within a specific age range and with important development tasks. They were in a state of stress for a long time before the college entrance examination. Continuous anxiety could have had a certain impact on their psychological structures, which could reduce individual evaluations of their self-esteem and cause a decrease in their levels of self-esteem.7 According to the core-periphery theory (CPT) of self-esteem, the self-esteem system consists of two core elements: self-confidence and sense of self-worth. This survey was carried out during the COVID-19 prevalence period. Students were unable to enter the schools, communicate face to face with teachers or classmates, or take mock exams organized by the schools.6 Students may have felt great uncertainty about their academic performance and learning ability, which would have directly affected their self-confidence and sense of self-worth, and self-esteem."

            "text": "The results show that academic anxiety can directly impact the self-esteem levels of the college entrance examination candidates and affect self-esteem through the mediating effect of self-regulated learning ability. Self-regulated learning is critical during a pandemic because it could help adolescents adjust their learning plan and better adapt to changes in their lives.13 Students with good self-regulated learning ability always know what they lack and have clear learning motivation.29 Individuals with low academic anxiety tend to adopt effective internal regulation strategies to improve their self-esteem levels. Individuals with high academic anxiety have higher external motivation but fewer internal regulation strategies, so their self-esteem levels are lower. This is consistent with the results of previous research. Many theoretical and empirical studies have shown that self-regulated learning ability is significantly related to anxiety.30,31 Negative emotions damage the cognitive ability and internal motivation of individuals.32 Some individuals can successfully eliminate negative emotions through internal self-regulation and obtain a higher level of self-esteem.33 The possible reasons are given below. On the one hand, self-regulated learning ability not only reflects the specific behavior strategies\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S360127 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 2388\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nof the learners in the learning process and the excellent quality of the learners to actively deal with academic pressure.34 The research on the relationship between negative life events and self-esteem found that positive coping can mediate the relationship between life events and self-esteem; on the contrary, negative coping can reduce self-worth.35 When college entrance examination candidates experience academic anxiety and adjust their self-learning in time, such as through learning motivation and metacognition, they can effectively deal with psychological pressure and ease individual academic anxiety. On the other hand, some studies have found that positive academic emotions are related to selfregulation, while negative academic emotions are significantly and positively related to external regulation. Further, negative academic emotions reduce the academic motivation of the students, make the students rely too much on external guidance and then deny their ability and value of existence, resulting in low self-esteem."

In addition, the current study also has important guiding significance in forming of good self-esteem among these candidates. At the same time, the study also has the following two shortcomings. Firstly, it was a cross-sectional study and lacked data from a longitudinal sample, so it is difficult to draw causal inferences. Secondly, in addition to the self-regulated learning ability proposed in the study, there may also be some other mediators or moderators such as attributional biases36 and coping styles37 that could affect the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem levels of high school students. Due to the limited research time, we did not include these variables in the study. These variables could be included in future studies to explore further the internal mechanism of academic anxiety that affects the levels of self-esteem of high school students in a more systematic model."
