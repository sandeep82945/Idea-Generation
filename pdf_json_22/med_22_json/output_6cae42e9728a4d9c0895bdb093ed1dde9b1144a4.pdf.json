However, the co-occurrence of tigecycline and carbapenem resistance determinants challenges the clinical e cacy of these antimicrobial agents. In this study, we report the co-existence of tet(X4), blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 genes in the porcine Acinetobacter towneri isolate 19110F47. Sequence analysis revealed that tet(X4) gene, along with the florfenicol resistance gene floR, was flanked by three copies of IS91-like elements, which can form three di erent translocatable units (TUs), and were located in a 41,098-bp multidrug resistance region (MDRR) within a novel 100,354-bp genomic island (GI) region. TUs comprising floR-virD2-ISVsa3, hp-abh-tet(X4)-ISVsa3 and virD2-floR-ISVsa3-hp-abh-tet(X4)-ISVsa3 can be looped out from the chromosomal DNA and facilitate the transfer of the TU-based resistance genes into other plasmidic or chromosomal sites. In addition, the carbapenemase genes blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 were found on di erent non-conjugative multiresistance plasmids in this isolate, with the genetic contexts ISAba125-blaNDM\u22121-bleMBL-tnpR and 1ISAba3-blaOXA\u221258-ISAba3, respectively. The simultaneous occurrence of tet(X4), blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 in the same porcine A. towneri isolate emphasizes the importance of antimicrobial resistance surveillance in food-producing animals.\nKEYWORDS\ntigecycline, carbapenem, resistance, tet(X4), blaNDM\u22121, blaOXA\u221258, Acinetobacter towneri\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health globally. The presence of extensively drugresistant (XDR) Gram-negative bacteria, in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp., compromises the efficacy of carbapenems. Moreover, the choices of effective antimicrobial agents against carbapenemresistant bacteria are very limited (1). Tigecycline has been recognized as a last-resort antimicrobial agent to treat infections caused by XDR Gram-negative bacteria (2). However, a variety of plasmid-borne tet(X) variants genes, which confer high-level resistance to tigecycline, have been reported in Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae from China (3, 4). The gene tet(X4) was detected in bacteria from food-producing animals, meat for human consumption, migratory birds, humans and environmental samples (5\u20137).\nAcinetobacter spp. are considered as ubiquitous in the nature and have emerged as a major cause of nosocomial infections globally in recent decades (8). In addition, Acinetobacter spp. are not only associated with hospital-acquired infections, but also responsible for community-acquired infections (9). XDR Acinetobacter isolates, especially when they are carbapenemresistant, are recognized as one of the most troublesome pathogens worldwide (10). Food-producing animals have been regarded as a potential reservoir for Acinetobacter spp. in many countries (11). To date, the tet(X4) gene was mostly reported in E. coli, and sometimes described in other bacterial species, such asAcinetobacter spp. (4, 12, 13). Currently, the genetic basis for co-resistance against tigecycline and carbapenems has been investigated in Acinetobacter spp. The tigecycline resistance genes tet(X) have been reported with carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM in A. baumannii, A. indicus, A. schindleri, A. lwoffii, and other Acinetobacter (14\u201316).\nIn this study, we investigated a tigecycline- and carbapenemresistant A. towneri isolate collected from a pig in China for the tigecycline- and carbapenem resistance genes present, their association with mobile genetic elements and their transfer potential."

            "text": "tigecycline-resistant A. towneri isolate\nAn isolate conferring resistance to both meropenem and tigecycline, designated 19110F47, was identified from swine origin in 2019. 16S rRNA sequence analysis suggested that it was assigned to the species A. towneri, which is involved in nosocomial infections as described in a previous study (16). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results revealed that it had an expanded resistance profile, including resistances to meropenem (MIC, 16\u00b5g/mL), tigecycline (8\u00b5g/mL), ceftazidime (256\u00b5g/mL), tetracycline (32\u00b5g/mL), gentamicin (64\u00b5g/mL) and florfenicol (128\u00b5g/mL). However, it was classified by the CLSI breakpoints as colistin-intermediate (<0.5\u00b5g/mL). It is noteworthy that CLSI classifies all isolates with colistin MICs of \u22642\u00b5g/mL as intermediate and does not provide a breakpoint for the category susceptible. Instead, when applying the breakpoints of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (http:// www.eucast.org), this isolate would have been classified as colistin-susceptible.\ntet(X4) was located in the chromosomal DNA in A. towneri and is part of TUs\nThe tet(X4) gene was found to be a part of a multidrug resistance region (MDRR) located on a 100,354-bp genomic island (GI) that was present in the chromosomal DNA of A. towneri 19110F47. The complete GI shared only a low query coverage (16\u201337%) with the sequences deposited in GenBank. It was inserted between the DUF3375 andAAA family ATPase encoding genes in the chromosomal DNA of A. towneri 19110F47. Database searches identified a distinctly smaller GI without an MDR region being present at the same location in A. towneriCIP_107472_V1 (accession number GCA_000368785.1) from an activated sludge plant in Australia. A total of 94 ORFs were identified in the GI of the present study. These ORFs encoded proteins responsible for several functions, such\nas gene regulation, transfer, efflux and antimicrobial resistance (Figure 1). The 41,098-bpMDRR consists of 33 ORFs [from IS26 to aph(6)-Ib] (Figure 1). Among them, a total of 12 resistance genes were identified, including tet(X4), the aminoglycoside resistance genes aadA1, aadA2b, aph(3\u201d)-Ib, aph(3\u2019)-Ia and aph(6)-Id, the sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2, the phenicol resistance genes cmlA1 and floR, the \u03b2-lactam resistance gene blaCARB\u22122 and the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrA16 (Figure 1). In the close vicinity of floR and tet(X4), one truncated and two complete copies of ISVsa3, all in the same orientation, were found (Figure 1), which was similar to the corresponding region on p47EC from a porcine E. coli (MK134376).\nThree PCR assays were developed to detect ISVsa3mediated rolling-circle transposition of tet(X4) and/or floR. The results revealed that three TUs, including TU1 (virD2-floRISVsa3, 4,274 bp), TU2 [hp-abh-tet(X4)-ISVsa3, 4,608 bp] and TU3 [virD2-floR-ISCR2-hp-abh-tet(X4)-ISVsa3, 8,882 bp] were formed in A. towneri 19110F47 (Figure 1).\nblaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 were located on novel non-conjugative plasmids\nThe blaNDM\u22121 gene was located on a plasmid with a size of 47,094 bp, designated p19110F47-1 (Figure 2A). BLAST analysis revealed that p19110F47-1 showed similiarities with two other plasmids, pAT232 (GN014838) and pGX7 (CP071772), present in the GenBank database. However, these similarities did neither include the regions covering the antimicrobial resistance genes, nor those with the plasmid replication gene. Overall, a low query coverage (with the highest of 48%) (Supplementary Figure 1) was detected, suggesting that p19110F47-1 is a novel carbapenem resistance plasmid. Further analysis of the flanking regions of blaNDM\u22121 revealed that the insertion sequence ISAba125 was located upstream of blaNDM\u22121. Moreover, the blaNDM\u22121 gene was part of a region that contained also the resistance genes aac(3)-IId, aphA6 and bleMBL (Figure 2A).\nThe blaOXA\u221258-carrying plasmid p19110F47-2 was 143,035 bp in size, also carried the aminoglycoside resistance genes aac(3)-IV, aph(3\u2019)-Ia and aph(4)-Ia, floR, sul2, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M), the macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin B resistance gene erm(B), and the macrolide resistance genes mph(E) and msr(E) (Figure 2B). GenBank database searches identified the complete sequences of seven plasmids from Acinetobacter spp. with p19110F47-2 query coverage ranges from 40 to 87% (Supplementary Figure 2), and most of these plasmids harbored both blaOXA\u221258 and tet(X) orthologs (19, 20).\nConjugation experiments were performed using A. towneri 19110F47 as donor and two different E. coli strains as recipients.\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 03 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 The genomic island carrying of the tet(X4) gene in the chromosomal DNA of A. towneri 19110F47 in this study.

            "text": "Acinetobacter spp. are ubiquitous in the natural environment, and have become important opportunistic pathogens, e.g., A. towneri, A. baumannii, A. indicus, and A. lwoffii. Acinetobacter spp. strains are widely distributed in a variety of environmental sources, including water, soil, foods, and livestock (15, 16, 21). In this study, we report, the identification of an Acinetobacter spp. strain co-harboring blaNDM\u22121, blaOXA\u221258 and tet(X4) collected from foodproducing animals in China. It belonged to Acinetobacter towneri, which is involved in nosocomial infections (16). Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. is one of the most dangerous pathogens in the world (21). And Acinetobacter spp. was the major reservoir of tigecycline-resistant tet(X) genes (12). The co-location of tet(X) and carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM\u22121 was previously described in Acinetobacter isolates from animals and the environment (14, 22). The strain 19110F47 had an expanded resistance profile. More attention should be paid to multidrug resistant (MDR) A. towneri isolates,\nbecause they have been reported increasingly in recent years, especially in hospital sewage and from livestock (23\u201326).\nThe tet(X4) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline was found to be on the chromosome of 19110F47. The floR and tet(X4) were found to be flanked by one truncated and two complete copies of ISVsa3. ISVsa3 is 977 bp in size and represents a member of the IS91 family. This family of insertion sequences differs from others in that they transpose by rolling circle transposition (27). Members of the IS91 family can mobilize genes, including resistance genes that are located in their close vicinity. For this, only a single copy of the IS91 element\u2014not two copies as with most other insertion sequences\u2014is necessary (27). The tet(X4) is the part of active TUs in the chromosomal DNA, may excise from the chromosomal DNA and transfer to other plasmidic or chromosomal sites. Of three TUs identified in A. towneri 19110F47, a sequence indistinguishable from that of TU2 was also found in p47EC (MK134376) from E. coli in a previous study (3), suggesting its mobility across genus boundaries. Of note, TU3 contained both tet(X4) and floR, implying that tigecycline resistance can be co-selected by florfenicol, a veterinary antimicrobial agent commonly used in cattle, pigs, poultry and fish (28).\nThe blaNDM\u22121 located on the plasmid p19110F47-1. Insertion of blaNDM\u22121 together with ISAba125 have been found\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 04 frontiersin.org\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 05 frontiersin.org\nwithin the chromosomal DNA and plasmids of Acinetobacter isolates (29, 30), suggesting that ISAba125 might be involved in the dissemination of blaNDM\u22121 among Acinetobacter spp. Numerous studies have documented that the blaNDM\u22121 was frequently present adjacent to truncated or intact ISAba125 as well as in other Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella enterica (31\u201333), indicating that ISAba125 plays a vital role in the spread of blaNDM\u22121 among different species of bacteria.\nThe blaOXA\u221258 was located on another plasmid p19110F472. An analysis for the genetic environments of blaOXA\u221258 showed that a truncated ISAba3 element was located upstream of blaOXA\u221258 and a complete ISAba3 element downstream of it. The genetic context found in the present study was consistent with that in plasmid pLHC22-2-tetX-162k (CP084298) in a previous study (19). In addition, the presence of two intact ISAba3 copies in opposite orientation up-stream and downstream of blaOXA\u221258 was described in a series of studies and led to the assumption that ISAba3 might play a role in the transfer of blaOXA\u221258 (22, 34). It has been documented that transformation of a cloned blaOXA\u221258 gene on a lowcopy-number vector into a susceptible A. baumannii strain increased the MICs of carbapenems, but not to levels considered as resistant (35, 36). For clinical carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp., other carbapenem resistance mechanisms in addition to OXA-58-like \u03b2-lactamases are required (35). In the present study, the A. towneri isolate 19110F47 showed resistance to meropenem with a MIC of 16\u00b5g/mL. It was speculated that blaNDM\u22121 played a dominant role in conferring themeropenem resistance phenotype.\nThe tet(X4), blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 genes have been documented in multiple studies solely or any two of them (14, 16, 20, 22, 37). Only one study by Zheng et al. described that a tet(X6) variant and the two carbapenemase genes blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 were located on the same plasmid in an A. baumannii isolate of chicken origin (15). In the current study, we identified the occurrence of tet(X4), blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 in the same A. baumannii isolate of swine origin, with tet(X4) being located on a novel chromosomal GI and blaNDM\u22121 and blaOXA\u221258 carried by two novel plasmids."
