    "abstractText": "Interferometry delivers the highest angular resolution. It is being used extensively in radio astronomy and, since about a decade, it is becoming an important player in infrared astronomy. However, infrared interferometry is restricted to sparse arrays and no full-phase information is recovered. While imaging is arguably the most intuitive way to analyze interferometric data, recovering images from sparsely sampled visibilities is an \u201cill-posed\u201d problem. The current algorithms work under the framework of using regularized minimization techniques. These algorithms strongly depend on the priors and hyperparameters pre-defined. This gives rise to ambiguities and artifacts in the interpretation of the images and limits their accuracy/precision as well as their signal-to-noise ratio if the priors/regularizers are not well-defined. Also, it means that imaging is the domain of a handful of highly experienced astronomers, thus keeping the interferometric community small. CASSINI-AUTOMAP aims at disrupting this situation by creating a novel framework for interferometric image reconstruction. This project is based on the exploitation of the compressibility of a signal (following the principles of theory of Compressed Sensing) with a novel optimization scheme supported by Neural Networks. In particular, we focus our efforts in designing a Neural Network with adaptive activation functions to find an optimal mapping system between the infrared interferometric data and the reconstructed images. The online adaptability of the Neural Network frees us from having to rely on strong priors, making the reconstructions more accurate and less dependent on users\u2019 inputs. Our preliminar network architecture has been tested with Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM) data taken with the infrared camera NACO at the Very Large Telescope and it demonstrates the potential and reliability of the algorithm by recovering the interferometric observables. Future improvements on the software aims at analyzing data from instruments like GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer or the Sparse Aperture Masking mode of the James Webb Space Telescope.",

            "text": "Imaging is routinely used in radio interferometry (see e.g., 1). However, the small number of telescopes in optical interferometers results in a very sparse sampling of Fourier space. Additionally, the short coherence times and small number of photons imply that ground-based infrared interferometers rarely can deliver Fourier phases. Instead, one typically uses robustly measurable so-called closure phases (argument of the bispectrum). The lack of phase information impedes the use of direct Fourier inversion techniques (such as CLEAN; 2) to recover images because there is no one-to-one relation between amplitudes and phases. Therefore imaging in optical interferometry is challenging, and used rarely, which limits severely the scientific exploitation of this technique. Instruments such as GRAVITY (3) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) have demonstrated that\nFurther author information: Send correspondence to J.S-B.

MATISSE (5) at the VLTI has started to be an important player in the study of stellar physics and Active Galactic Nuclei (6), and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide sparse aperture masking interferometric data with unprecedented contrast (7).\nDuring the last decade, there has been a large effort to provide reliable software for image reconstruction to the community. However, the existing software packages (see e.g., 8; 9) face some problems:\n\u2022 Most of the algorithms only work with monochromatic reconstructions. They cannot simultaneously recover images over different wavelengths. Therefore, they cannot make full use of differential phases and astrometry.\n\u2022 Most of the algorithms rely on regularization functions in image space. These functions are necessary to ensure convergence and impose conditions such as smooth transitions between adjacent pixels, positivity, or sharp edges. Unfortunately, an unsuitable choice in the selection of regularization functions can result in in different outcomes for the same target even in the presence of a very good u-v coverage. Finally, ideally regularization functions need to vary across the pixel grid in case of complex target morphologies. This poses additional difficulties for the choice of regularizers and for the convergence of the algorithms, which are intimately connected.\n\u2022 Most existing software packages use a Bayesian approach to fit the pixels\u2019 brightness distribution. However, the fit is not always well constrained because of the traditional minimization algorithms used (gradient descent and Monte-Carlo), in particular if non-convex regularizers (such as the L0-norm) are used for the reconstruction. This can prevent the convergence of the algorithms.\n\u2022 Each attempt at image reconstruction resembles an \u201cartisanal\u201d process, relying on the experience of each individual astronomer. Each reconstruction is tailored for a specific target and it is generally not possible to apply similar setups to a group of targets. This limits the potential of imaging for studies of large numbers of objects severely. A transition from artisanal to standard and reproducible imaging reconstruction is needed, securing the reliability and reproducibility of the results. This is particularly important for the upcoming instrumentation such as GRAVITY+\u2217 at the VLTI and NIRISS-SAM\u2020 at the JWST."

This is the reason why strong regularizers are necessary in the currently existing image reconstruction algorithms. However, a key feature of astronomical images is that they are highly structured and groups of pixels trace specific morphological components. Their values are highly correlated while a large number of other pixels are devoid of signal. This means that astronomical images are highly compressible, i.e. we can obtain valuable information about a source\u2019s brightness distribution with significantly less samples of the power-spectrum than there are pixels in the image. A simple example is a simple binary star. In this case, with only a few u-v points, we can retrieve the cosine function (in Fourier space) that represents two unresolved sources, thus recovering the brightness distribution in a highly compressed way.\nTo exploit compressibility, the theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) (11; 12) provides us with a good theoretical background. This technique has already been applied with great success to improve interferometric imaging at radio wavelengths (13; 14). The standard minimization algorithms based on CS require a linear operation between (i) the eigenfunctions (usually called \u201cthe dictionary\u201d), (ii) the eigenvalues of the space in which the image is projected and, (iii) the measurement matrix in which the data are taken (the Fourier transform in the case of interferometric data).

However, if closure phases are used instead of actual phases, the image cannot be recovered because the observables cannot be represented any more by a linear combination of the eigenfunctions. Therefore, standard CS minimization cannot be applied. Unfortunately, this poses a strong limitation on the application of standard CS to infrared interferometric data because the latter can rarely provide us with Fourier phases, but typically only delivers closure phases. Therefore, algorithms which exploit compressibility in combination with non-linear transformations must be explored."

            "text": "Artificial neural networks (NN) are highly distributed systems that are inspired by the way neurons are interconnected in biological nerve systems. The basic unit in a NN is called a neuron. It is interconnected with others to learn certain patterns or predict certain behavior. For this, it is necessary to train the NN over several iterations using a large number of models or measurements. This type of algorithm has demonstrated to learn very complex patterns that cannot be easily predicted with other, more traditional, methods. A type of NN that has demonstrated to be very efficient in learning morphological structures from images is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This type of network is designed to work with grid-structured inputs that have strong local spatial correlations like the pixels of structured astronomical images. The key of the success of CNNs is their ability to semantically understand different structures by connecting layers in a localized way. Some examples of the applicability of these networks to recover, or even to generate new \u201dnatural\u201d images are the so-called Generative Adversarial Networks (16) or Generative Variational Auto Encoders (17). Figure 1 shows an example of a generative adversarial network, where two networks, the Generator (G; which is typically a CNN) and the Discriminator (D), play a minmax game so that G can learn how to produce new images based on the morphological properties of the ones used for training.\nIn a precursor work, GANs have been used to reconstruct infrared interferometric images (18). These authors used a two-step process, first, a GAN is trained with a set of radiative transfer models and a standard binary cossentropy cost function. Once the G is well-trained (i.e., the second step), the weights of the GAN are fine tuned by changing the cost function, comparing the output of G with the data and regularizing the output of D with an hyper-parameter \u00b5. This method has proven to be quite efficient in recovering infrared interferometric images with significantly high signal-to-noise (SNR) compared with more traditional bayesian approaches. However, the performance of the network is highly dependent on the value of \u00b5 selected and the complexity of the network makes the training process quite prohibitive if GPUs units with large memory available are not used."

However, a machine-learning step-forward is to estimate a direct mapping, F(m; \u03b8), parametrized by \u03b8, from the interferometric data, m, to the reconstructed image, t without pre-defining strong hyperparameters. In the NN framework, to find \u03b8 this approach requires (i) to learn the set of weights of the neuron connections during the training process and (ii) to properly define the activation functions of each one of the neurons, when designing the network architecture.\nOne of the key aspects of pattern recognition from NNs is the role of the activation function. The activation function decides, whether a neuron should be activated or not with the purpose of introducing non-linearity into the output of a neuron. Determining the different activation functions in the architecture of the network is essential for its correct functioning. There are, at least, three types of activation functions: saturated, unsaturated and adaptive. Saturated activation functions are used for decision boundaries (e.g., Sigmoid). However, this type of activation functions could lead to vanishing gradient problems during the training process. Unsaturated activation functions solve the vanishing gradient problem but, it they fall into a negative region, is highly improbable that the neuron could be activated again (e.g., Rectified Linear Unit -ReLU-). This could be solved by adding a constant term that acts like threshold for the negative part of the function (e.g., Leaky ReLU). Nevertheless, including this new pre-defined constant is like adding an hyperparameter which could strongly affect the learning process of the NN. Adaptive activation functions solve these problems by using trainable coefficients. For a more detailed description on the different types of activation functions, please consult (19). The use of adaptive activations functions has demonstrated to have interesting implications in making the learning process faster and more effective.\nIn this work, we present a new NN approach for infrared interferometric image reconstruction based on (i) a direct non-linear mapping F(m; \u03b8) and (ii) the use of adaptive activation functions. To validate our new framework, we use real data taken with the infrared camera NACO-VLT in its Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM) model. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the observations used. Section 3 describes our algorithm and shows our results. Finally in Section 4, our results are discussed and summarized."

Frames with no more than 5 minutes of difference of integration time were averaged to obtain the final raw interferometric observables. This avoided fringe smearing due to changes in the parallactic angle. With those restrictions, we obtained 4 different data cubes from which the interferometric observable where extracted.\nCASSINI-SAMPip creates a model of the fringes based on the geometry of the mask and searches for the changes in contrast and phase in each one of the fringe patterns per baseline associated with the structure of the target.

The AUTOMAP network has been used to reconstruct images from medical data obtained through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This network has demonstrated to be quite efficient in mapping between sensor and image domains with the use of appropriate training data. The network presented here, called CASSINI-AUTOMAP, follows this approach and it maps directly the interferometric data to the reconstructed image by using a convolutional neural network. Figure 4 displays the model summary with the different layers used and the number of parameters trained on each one. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of our NN. In the diagram, we can observe the two main sections of the network. The first one corresponds to three fully connected layers (FC1, FC2 and FC3) which map the input observables with the number of pixels in the output image. FC3 has a dimension equivalent to n\n2 \u00d7 1, where n is the number of pixels per side in the output image, in our case n=64. FC1 uses a simple sigmoid activation function. FC2 and FC3 use an adaptive hyperbolic tangent (Atanh) activation function. The second section employs three convolutional layers (C1, C2 and C3). C1 and C2 convolve 64 filters of 5 \u00d7 5 kernel size with stride 1 while, C3 uses a 7 \u00d7 7 kernel size. C1 and C2 employ a parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) activation function and dropout with a probability of 0.1 before being connected between them. C3 and the output layer, Co, are used to deconvolve the image into a 64 \u00d7 64 array.\nThe Atanh activation function employs two trainable parameters (a, s) per neuron.

The training of the network was performed using an external AMD Radeon RX 570 GPU with 4 GB of memory. In order to train the network, 10000 models of bow shocks with asymmetric shapes were used. Those models were obtained using the radiative transfer code described in (20). The adaptive activation functions allowed us to fully train the network over 300 epochs using the Adam optimizer. From our tests, we notice that the number of epochs used is, at least, a third of the ones required without using adaptive activation functions. This results in a significant reduction of the processing time required during training. The cost function used for back-propagation of the gradient is the regression mean-squared error (MSE) loss. Figure 6 displays the MSE obtained from the different batches per epoch over the training process. The evolution of the MSE converges after 300 epochs. The biggest jump is observed around the first 20 epochs. This coincides with the epoch when the network learns the general shape of the bow shock. Figure 7 displays a sample of 5 different images obtained at different epochs, that clearly illustrate the evolution of the training process, at Epoch 0 there is only noise in the predicted images. However, as the network weights are evolving, central elongated structures appear and gradually the form of bow shocks emerge."

Figure 10 in the Appendix displays 5 examples of reconstructed images and their corresponding interferometric observables.\nAfter validating the performance of our network, we predict the morphology of the GC IRS 1W bow shock by randomly creating 500 samples from the interferometric data, assuming Gaussian distributions based on the mean and standard deviation of each observable. The mean image obtained with CASSINI-AUTOMAP was able to recover the interferometric observables with great accuracy. Indeed, the morphology of the bow-shock is clearly visible, even for pixel values below 5% of the peak value. We estimated a SNR \u223c 40 for pixel values of 5% of the emission peak while, the BSMEM image has a SNR \u223c 10 in the same regime. The reconstructed image with the NN also exhibits an asymmetric bow shock with the peak of the emission over the tails of the shock front. The estimated size of the bow shock and the position angle of the apex (PA \u223c 25\u25e6) are similar between the BSMEM image and the CASSINI-AUTOMAP one. However, we could clearly identify that the emission below 10% of the peak value in the BSMEM image is very asymmetric, while, in the NN image the emission follows the same structure of the tails. This effect is caused because of the models employed for training the network. However, this does not compromise the fit of the observables. Adding more structures (like point-like sources) to the models used for training could help us to discover additional asymmetries in the source structure. The interesting idea behind this is the possibility of linking these additional sources with well-recognized physical structures, for example dust clumps or stellar companions. Future developments of CASSINI-AUTOMAP will aim at incorporating such additional features for training.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12183 121831K-9 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 29 Mar 2023 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

The method presented is based on Neural Networks to find a direct map between the available interferometric observables and the expected astrophysical images. Furthermore, our network includes adaptive activation functions which decrease, significantly, the computational time of the training process and make the network more reliable. While this type of algorithm has been used successfully in other fields of research, its application to astronomical interferometric data is novel. The basis of our neural network architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network with three convolutional layers. This design has proven to be quite successful in recovering or predicting different natural images. In order to test this new machine-learning methodology, we used real Sparse Aperture Masking data obtained with the infrared camera NACO-VLT. Our neural network, called CASSINI-AUTOMAP, was trained using radiative transfer models of stellar bow shocks. In order to benchmark the reconstructed images obtained with the NN, we also recovered images using the regularized minimization code BSMEM. Both codes were able to reconstruct the morphology of an asymmetric stellar bow shock with bright tails. The reconstructed image obtained with our NN was able to reproduce the interferometric observables, and the image shows higher SNR than the BSMEM image. This test demonstrates the potential of the the new methodology to recover interferometric images.\nFuture improvements using CASSINI-AUTOMAP will include training with new morphologies of astrophysical objects and their validation with other interferometric facilities like the beam-combiners GRAVITY and MATISSE at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The use of NNs also allow us to use new potential techniques to improve interferometric image reconstruction, particularly for variable (in time and wavelength) structures. This new methodology could be an important player to minimize some of the current problems and limitations in interferometric image reconstruction and, it could also provide a solid ground for using routinely infrared interferometric imaging for scientific analysis. This is of particular importante to fully exploit the current and future interferometric facilities like the Aperture Masking mode of the James Webb Space Telescope or the upgrade GRAVITY+ at the VLTI. The preliminar design of CASSINI-AUTOMAP is available under request and the final version will be available under open source license for the community."
