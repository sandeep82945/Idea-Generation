Previous electrospray ionization ( ESI ) mass spectrometric ( MS ) analyses of Cu ( I ) binding to Zn 7 -MT were complicated by significant overlap of the natural abundance isotopic patterns for Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) leading to impossibly ambiguous stoichiometries. In this paper, isotopically pure 63 Cu ( I ) and 68 Zn ( II ) allowed determination of the specific stoichiometries in the 68 Zn, 63 Cu\u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species formed following the stepwise addition of 63 Cu ( I ) to 68 Zn 7 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. These species were characterized by ESI-MS and room temperature emission spectroscopy. The key species that form and their emission band centres are Zn 5 Cu 5 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( \u03bb = 684 nm ) , Zn 4 Cu 6 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( \u03bb = 750 nm ) , Zn 3 Cu 9 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( \u03bb = 750 nm ) , Zn 2 Cu 10 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( \u03bb = 750 nm ) , and Zn 1 Cu 14 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( \u03bb = 634 nm ) . The specific domain stoichiometry of each species was determined by assessing the species forming following 63 Cu ( I ) addition to the 68 Zn 3 \u03b2 MT1A and 68 Zn 4 \u03b1 MT1A domain fragments. The domain fragment emission suggests that Zn 5 Cu 5 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A contains a Zn 1 Cu 5 \u03b2 cluster and the Zn 4 Cu 6 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, Zn 3 Cu 9 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 2 Cu 10 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A each contain a Cu 6 \u03b2 cluster. The species forming with > 10 mol. eq. of 63 Cu ( I ) in \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A exhibit emission from the Cu 6 \u03b2 cluster and an \u03b1 domain cluster. This high emission intensity is seen at the end of the titrations of 68 Zn 7 \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and the 68 Zn 4 \u03b1 MT1A domain fragment suggesting that the initial presence of the Zn ( II ) results in clustered Cu ( I ) binding in the \u03b1 domain.",

MT1 is predominantly ound in the kidneys and MT2 in the liver; however, both can lso be found in various amounts throughout the entire body,21\nhereas MT3 and MT4 are expressed in the central nervous sysem 22 and epithelial tissue,23 respectively. MT proteins lack enzymatic activity, rather the sulphurontaining cysteine residues are used to bind Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) for etal storage as part of the overall homeostatic pathways and d ( II ) for heavy metal detoxification.24\u201334 MTs may also play a role n redox reactions in the cell.35 , 36 MTs extracted from animal tisues have been reported to contain Zn ( II ) , Cd ( II ) , and Cu ( I ) .13 , 37 , 38\nany transition metals have also been reported to bind MT in itro .39\u201352 In vitro, human MT1 and MT2 can be fully metallated ith 7 divalent metals, such as Zn ( II ) or Cd ( II ) ,53 or 20 monovaent metals, such as Cu ( I ) .39 When mammalian MTs are metalated with exactly 7 divalent metals, two domains form: an Nerminal \u03b2 domain binding 3 Zn ( II ) or Cd ( II ) with 9 cysteines and a -terminal \u03b1 domain binding 4 Zn ( II ) or Cd ( II ) with 11 cysteines.53\nhe two domains are connected by a short linker region ( Fig. 1 ) .54\nn vivo , partially metallated MTs are expected.55\nCu-MTs exhibit phosphorescence. The emission spectra ecorded, following excitation of the protein at the S-Cu ( I ) LMCT and ( 280 nm ) , have been used to identify the structure of he chromophore as a Cu ( I ) -thiolate cluster in an environment hielded from the solvent at both 77 K and room temperaure.56\u201361 In the absence of Cu ( I ) -thiolate clusters, very weak mission intensity is expected from isolated Cu ( I ) bound to he cysteines in MT due to solvent deactivation of the triplet tate. This sensitivity of the phosphorescence intensity to the olvent means that the emission is, therefore, sensitive to the verall protein structure. Previously, many researchers reported he emission properties of Cu-MTs frozen at 77 K to show the ormation of the Cu-thiolate clusters.57\u201359 However, the value of tepwise metal titrations with MTs has been well established in etermining species formation,62 , 63 especially when carried out n parallel with ESI-MS data.39 , 60 , 63 Metal titrations combined ith 77 K emission spectroscopy cannot be carried out without epeated freezing and thawing of the protein. Such constant anipulation of the protein brings the risk of oxidation. Use of red sensitive spectrofluorometer to measure the room temerature phosphorescence spectra overcomes these difficulties. he use of room temperature emission also allows for relative ntensities to be measured which gives useful indications on the verall protein structure based on the relative emissiveness of he clusters formed. The presence of room temperature phoshorescence 39 , 57 , 60 , 61 further emphasizes that the Cu ( I ) ions are ocated in a shielded, clustered environment. Recently, we have published detailed speciation information n the Cu ( I ) -thiolate clusters that form in the metal-free apo \u03b1 MT1A and its isolated metal-free apo \u03b2 and \u03b1 domain fragents.39 , 60 The Cu ( I ) -thiolate species formed from the apo protein erve as a model for Cu ( I ) binding to MT newly synthesized by the ell. Cu ( I ) may also bind to partially Zn-MTs 55 in vivo and so mixed n, Cu-MT species are also expected.\nA recent paper by Mehlenbacher et al . has reported the stoihiometry and structural properties of Cu ( I ) binding to Zn 7 -MT2 nd Zn 7 -MT3.64 In that paper, the authors provide detailed stoihiometry and information on Cu ( I ) binding to the metal-free apo T2 and MT3 prepared in situ using a large excess of glutathione GSH ) to coordinate the initial Zn ( II ) . These authors report that ollowing addition of 20 mol. eq. of Cu ( I ) , both the apo MT2 and po MT3 bind 8 Cu ( I ) per protein molecule using inductively couled plasma mass spectrometric ( MS ) analysis. Due to the \u223c2000 old excess of GSH, all of the Zn ( II ) is displaced from the protein pon Cu ( I ) addition and so Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) do not coexist in the nal protein. It should be noted that in vivo , the GSH level is not igh enough to displace all of the Zn ( II ) from MT. The procedure eported by Mehlenbacher et al .64 is unlike the experimental proedures that we present in this paper where the Zn ( II ) is retained n the protein as Cu ( I ) is added stepwise. Many MT isoforms bind mixtures of Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) in vivo and o the binding pathways for all isoforms are of great interest. MT1 nd MT2 must be studied in detail to compare with the more speialized MT3 and MT4 isoforms. MT1 from rat kidneys has been ound to contain a substantial amount of Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) .65 Zn, u-MT1 has been isolated from horse and pig kidneys as well.66 , 67\nn, Cu-MTs have also been extracted from bovine fetal calf liver ith 0\u201315 Cu ( I ) .38 Another well-known example is the Zn, Cu-MT3\nsolated from bovine brain with 4\u20135 Cu ( I ) and 2\u20132.5 Zn ( II ) ions 8 and from human brains with 4 Cu ( I ) ions and 3 Zn ( II ) ions.22\nhe metallation of MTs may also change with disease. Human\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/1/m fac101/6965832 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells have been reported to contain, Zn, Cu-MT, and Cu-MT.69 A significant complication when assessing the metallation status of MTs formed in vivo is that the natural balance between Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) may be disrupted by the extraction procedures of these very air-sensitive proteins. Therefore, stepwise additions of Cu ( I ) into dilute solutions of Zn-saturated or partially saturated Zn-MT in controlled oxygen-free environments are of particular importance in establishing potential in vivo speciation.\nMany of the techniques used in previous studies of Zn, Cu containing MTs only report on the average metal content. However electrospray ionization ( ESI ) MS studies have shown that mixtures of species should be expected.39 , 60 , 70 The presence of multiple species forming with varying degrees of cooperativity means that the mol. eq. of copper added is not always a reliable technique for determining the exact stoichiometry of the species formed. This may explain the variation in reported Zn, Cu-MT stoichiometries obtained from optical studies. Examples include Stillman et al . who reported the formation of Zn 4 Cu 6 , Cu 12 , and Cu 20 species from rabbit liver Zn 7 -MT2 using circular dichroism spectroscopy and room temperature emission spectroscopy methods,71 Bogumil et al . who reported a Cu 4 cluster within Cu, Zn-MT3 using 77 K emission spectroscopy,68 and Bofill et al . who concluded from UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy that 4 Cu ( I ) bind cooperatively to the isolated \u03b2 domain fragment of mouse MT1. In that latter study, Chelex-100 was added to bind the Zn ( II ) displaced by the incoming Cu ( I ) ; analysis revealed that 2 mol. equiv. of Zn ( II ) were bound to the Chelex-100 leading the researchers to conclude that a Zn 1 Cu 4 \u03b2 mouse MT species formed. However, in none of these previously mentioned studies ESI-MS was used to confirm the speciation.68 , 71 , 72\nA later study by Bofill et al . reported several Zn, Cu-MT species forming in mouse MT1 using ESI-MS methods.73 In their paper, the masses listed for each species decreased over the course of the titration, suggesting that there may be additional Zn, Cu species forming that the authors could not resolve. An example of the difficulty in resolving mixed Zn, Cu species is also seen in the following studies on Zn, Cu speciation in snail MT. In these papers, the authors report only the total number of metals bound ( M x , where x is the sum of both Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) ions bound ) .74 , 75 The issue in distinguishing Zn ( II ) from Cu ( I ) lies not only in the similar averages masses but in the overlapping isotopic distributions of Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) . While high resolution mass spectrometers are able to distinguish between very small mass differences, the broad MS peaks that arise due to using natural abundance Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) , in addition to the isotopic distribution from the C, H, N, O, and S in the protein, make it very difficult to clearly determine the Zn/Cu exchange process that takes place as Cu ( I ) is added to Zn-MTs. We note that even with the 140 000 resolution of the Q-Exactive TM Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( data unpublished ) , it was impossible to clearly identify the exact stoichiometries of the Zn, Cu-MT species of similar masses with > 3 Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) .\nIn the studies described in this present paper, we overcome these significant and longstanding difficulties and report the unambiguous stoichiometry of a series of Zn, Cu- \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species at pH 7.4 through the use of isotopically pure 68 Zn ( II ) and 63 Cu ( I ) when Cu ( I ) is added to human Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. Our results show that the Zn ( II ) is retained in the protein with up to 14 Cu ( I ) . Through the use of the domain fragments, we identify the localization of the remaining Zn ( II ) . Room temperature solution emission spectra measured in tandem with the stepwise ESI-MS data provide evidence for the presence of a series of distinct Zn, Cu ( I ) - thiolate clustered species. The data show that the specific species\nthat form with an increasing number of metal ions are controlled by the total positive charge from the sum of the Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) ions. For displacement of Zn ( II ) by Cu ( I ) , this means that the oxidation state of the incoming metal ion ( here + 1 ) is an important criterion in terms of the specific stoichiometric ratios, Zn: Cu, that are stable at equilibrium."

The protein concentration was measured by metallating a raction of the protein sample with cadmium and measuring the bsorbance at 250 nm ( S-Cd LMCT ) . 68 ZnO was purchased from race Sciences International and dissolved in dilute acetic acid ith heating. The pH was increased to 4.1 with dilute NH 4 OH and iluted to a final concentration of 10 mM with Milli Q water. The 8 Zn solution was deaerated and argon-saturated before being itrated into the apo protein until the majority of the protein was 8 Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, 68 Zn 3- \u03b2-MT1A, or 68 Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A as seen by the SI-MS. The pH of the 68 Zn-MT1A was adjusted to 7.4. u ( I ) titrations sotopically pure 63 CuCl 2 was obtained from Trace Sciences Interational. Reduced GSH ( Sigma ) was dissolved in argon-saturated 0 mM ammonium formate at pH 7.4. 63 CuCl 2 was added at a 3:1 SH: 63 Cu ( II ) ratio to form reduced Cu ( I ) -GSH as reported by Fereira et al .76 All 63 Cu ( I ) solutions were made to be 10 mM. All soutions were rigorously deaerated and argon-saturated to prevent xidation. Molar equivalents of the 10 mM 63 Cu-GSH were added tepwise ( based on the MT concentration ) to the Zn-saturated proein assuming all Cu ( II ) was reduced to Cu ( I ) . For each addition of Cu ( I ) \u2019, we mean the addition of Cu ( I ) bound to an unknown numer of GSH ligands and the oxidized GSSG product. The Cu ( I ) ( SG ) x pecies are not observed in the ESI-MS so the value of x cannot e determined at this time by our methods. All Cu ( I ) was added o protein at pH 7.4 and room temperature. Zn, Cu-MT samples ere measured either by ESI-MS or emission spectroscopy aproximately 30 s after each addition as there were insignificant hanges in the mass spectrum or the emission spectrum after this ime point. There was no indication of oxidation of the protein hat would result from Cu ( I ) disproportionation or any evidence f coloured, oxidized Cu ( II ) . lectrospray ionization mass spectrometry amples prepared by the methodology above were measured by irect infusion into the Bruker MicrOTOF II ( Bruker Daltonics ) in ositive ion mode. The parameters used are shown in Table 1 . All amples were rigorously deaerated and argon-saturated to preent oxidation. The relative abundance of each species detected as normalized and the mol. eq. of Cu ( I ) bound to the protein was alculated from those values.\nmission spectroscopy oom temperature Cu ( I ) -thiolate cluster phosphorescence was easured using a Photon Technology Quanta Master 4 ( QM4 ) canning spectrofluorometer ( PTI Inc., London, Canada ) . Protein amples ( prepared by the methodology above ) were kept anaerbically in a 1 cm sealed quartz cuvette to prevent oxidation. amples were excited at 280 nm using a Xenon flash lamp ( flash ate = 100 Hz ) , and the resulting room temperature phosphores-\nence was measured from 500\u2013900 nm with a 750 nm blazed gratng and a red-sensitive GaAs phototube. A yellow filter was used o decrease the scatter of the excitation overtone band. All slits ere held constant at 10 nm. The Xenon flash lamp allowed for hosphorescent lifetime measurements. Since different Zn, CuT species have different wavelengths of emission, the presence f mixtures in the solution results in multiple overlapping band nvelopes with the \u03bbmax representing an average. The species conributing to the emission were identified by measuring the ESI-MS rofiles for each point in the titration alongside the emission meaurements. The phosphorescent decay of selected wavelengths was meaured after exciting the sample at 280 nm. The emission was meaured for 20\u201330 \u03bcs in 100 steps with a 1\u20132 \u03bcs integration time. hen multiple emission bands are present, wavelengths on the dge of the emission band envelope away from other emission ands were selected to decrease the chance of measuring an averge lifetime of the two emission bands. The lifetimes were calcuated using the QM-4 software. All samples were rigorously deaerted and argon-saturated to prevent oxidation.\nass spectrometry isotope simulations imulated MS data were generated using Compass IsotopePattern Bruker ) with the resolution set to 10 000. The isotope pattern for po- \u03b2 MT1A was calculated by inputting the protein sequence. or the simulations of the metallated \u03b2 MT1A species, 2 protons ere removed for each Zn ( II ) bound and 1 proton for each Cu ( I ) ound. In a deconvolution calculation, the charge of the metal ons is compensated for the loss of the same number of protons, ndependent of the apparent coordination numbers. For example, he 14 + charge of 7 Zn ( II ) is compensated for in the calculation y the loss of 14 protons. These numbers are observed in the exerimental ESI-MS data upon metal binding. The program calcuated the abundance of each isotopomer with different combinaions of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur isotopes as ell as the zinc and copper, when natural abundances were beng considered. Isotopically pure 68 Zn and 63 Cu were added to the imulated mass spectra manually as the Compass Isotope Pattern rogram does not have a function for simulating isotopically pure lements. The simulations of apo- \u03b2 MT1A, Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A, Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 T1A, and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A were compared to the experimental data. he contributions of Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A to the exerimental M 6 peak were determined by adding together varying ractions of the isotope pattern for isotopically pure 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A nd 68 Zn 1 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A until the simulation matched the expermental data. The contributions of 68 Zn 2 63 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A and 68 Zn 3 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A to the experimental M 6 peak were determined by dding together varying fractions of the isotope pattern for isoopically pure 68 Zn 2 63 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A and 68 Zn 3 63 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A until he simulation matched the experimental data. The contributions f Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A to the experimental 10 peak were determined by adding together varying fractions of he isotope pattern for isotopically pure 68 Zn 4 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A and 8 Zn 5 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A until the simulation matched the experimenal data.\nesults and discussion sotope simulations prove the necessity f using 63 Cu ( I ) and 68 Zn ( II ) in mixed etal binding to MTs S is key to determining the exact stoichiometry of the many etallated species of MT.

In Figs 2 and 3 ( and later 6, 8, and 12 ) , we use the program, \u2018Compass IsotopePattern\u2019, to simulate mass spectra and demonstrate that the problem is the multiple, overlapping stable Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) isotopes ( Table 2 ) that combine with the broad peptide MS envelope. The protein peak is broad due to the many combinations of carbon isotopes, particularly 12 C and 13 C, as well as isotopes of H, N, O, and S isotopes in the protein. The effects of the broad protein peak and the multiple Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) isotopes make it impossible to distinguish between the mass of Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) . The use of isotopically pure metals dramatically improves species identification without the need for more specialized highresolution mass spectrometers. The use of isotopically pure elements has also been used to study metal exchange 77 , 78 as well as the formation of other metal-sulfur clusters.79 We note that these simulations use the \u03b2 domain fragment and that the complexity is further exacerbated when the full \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A protein is metallated.\nThe clarity in the measurement of Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT using isotopically pure 68 Zn ( II ) To confirm the validity of the simulations, the isotope pattern of the apo protein ( Fig. 2 A ) was first modelled and compared to experimental ESI-MS data ( Fig. 2 B ) .

Metalated \u03b2 MT1A species were then simulated. The isotopic pattern or natural abundance Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A becomes very complicated ith 21 isotopomers as a result of the 5 stable Zn ( II ) isotopes Fig. 2 C ) . The result is that the peak, centred on 3943 Da, is very road ( Fig. 2 C ) . In contrast, the width of the simulated isotope pattern for he isotopically pure 68 Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 2 D ) is identical to that f the apo protein as expected for the addition of an element ith a single isotope. The experimental isotope pattern of 68 Zn 3 - MT1A is shown in Fig. 2 E. The experimental band envelope is n almost identical copy of the simulation ( Fig. 2 D ) , except with ome additional low-intensity peaks corresponding to 68 Zn 2 63 Cu 1 - MT1A centred on 3946 Da. This species formed as a result of esidual 63 Cu ( I ) in the ESI-MS PEEK tubing. It is the use of isoopic 68 Zn ( II ) and 63 Cu ( I ) that allows for the detection of the adjaent 68 Zn 2 63 Cu 1 - \u03b2 MT1A species. If natural abundance Zn ( II ) were sed, this species would be indistinguishable from the main Zn 3 - \u03b2 T1A peak.\nse of isotopically pure 63 Cu ( I ) and 68 Zn ( II ) reatly increases clarity in the ESI-MS of sotopically pure 68 Zn, 63 Cu- \u03b2 MT1A species hile Cu ( I ) only has two stable isotopes, the isotopic pattern uickly becomes complicated when multiple Cu ( I ) ions are conidered. The combination of the broad protein MS peak and the verlapping Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) isotopes essentially makes it imposible to distinguish species with the same total number of metals ut differing Zn: Cu ratios. This is seen in the simulations of the n 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 3 A ) and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 3 B ) MS peaks as ell as the simulation of the 42:58 ratio of Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A: Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 T1A. It is, therefore, not surprising that previous reports of Cu nd Zn stoichiometries in Zn, Cu MT species using ESI-MS and atural abundance Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) have been unable to resolve he presence of specific species.74 , 75\nThe isotopic pattern is again compressed with the use of the sotopically pure metals. The reduction in the breadth of the eak as well as the greater mass difference between 63 Cu ( I ) and 8 Zn ( II ) ( compared to the average natural abundance masses ) alows for the clear distinction between 68 Zn 1 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 3 D, 128.5 Da ) and 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 3 E, 4124.5 Da ) . In the case where 68 Zn 1 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A and 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A exist t the same point in the titration, we can simulate the overall MS nvelope for any given ratio of the two species ( vide infra Fig. 6 ) . ratio of 42:58 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A: 68 Zn 1 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 3 F ) best atched the experimental data in Fig. 3 G. The experimental ESIS peak for 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A is centred on 4124.5 Da ( Fig. 3 H ) , similar o the simulated 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A mass spectrum ( Fig. 3 E ) . Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 show the experimental results of dding natural abundance Cu ( I ) to 68 Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A. It is clear from upplementary Fig. S2 that using both isotopically pure 63 Cu ( I ) nd 68 Zn ( II ) results in much better separation between Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 T1A and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A; however, in the absence of isotopically ure Cu ( I ) , room temperature emission and circular dichroism pectra ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) aid in the identification of two eparate species.\nse of 63 Cu ( I ) and 68 Zn ( II ) reveals a series of ixed-metal Zn, Cu-MT clustered species\nsing isotopically pure 68 Zn ( II ) acetate and 63 Cu ( I ) -GSH, our deailed ESI-MS results discussed below show the Zn ( II ) /Cu ( I ) exhange reactions first in the Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 4 ) and Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A\nFig. 7 ) domain fragments. These results are used to explain the rocess of Zn ( II ) /Cu ( I ) exchange in the Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 10 ) . The asses of all the species detected by ESI-MS are listed in Suplementary Tables S1\u2013S3. While Zn 7 -MT1A may not occur in the ell, these experiments serve as a basis for future studies of parially metallated MTs using this method. In the subsequent decriptions, we omit the isotopically pure descriptor for the Cu ( I ) nd Zn ( II ) and the GSH ligand for the Cu ( I ) . The displaced Zn ( II ) an be bound by the GSH; however, the binding constants for the n ( II ) and Cu ( I ) in the various clustered structures of MT are much reater 39 , 80 than the binding constants for Cu ( I ) or Zn ( II ) binding o the GSH 11 , 64 , 81 so the presence of GSH does not significantly hange the outcome of the titration of Cu ( I ) into Zn-MT.\nu ( I ) metallation of 68 Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A results in the ormation of Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A, then Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A o gain insight into the pathways involved when Cu ( I ) replaces n ( II ) in the \u03b2 domain, 68 Zn ( II ) was added to the \u03b2 domain fragent to make 68 Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A at pH 7.4 and room temperature. The esulting species, formed after 11 stepwise additions of Cu ( I ) , were easured by ESI-MS ( Fig. 4 ) and room temperature emission specroscopy ( Fig. 5 ) . The approach of connecting the emission data ith parallel measurement of the speciation using ESI-MS allows or the unambiguous identification of the key Zn, Cu-MT species ontributing to the phosphorescence spectra. The ESI-MS data\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/1/m fac101/6965832 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nclearly show that at certain steps multiple species are present resulting in an average emission band envelope comprising one or more specific bands. Because isotopic 68 Zn ( II ) and 63 Cu ( I ) were used, the stoichiometry is well known and specific band centres can be discerned from the overall spectral envelope allowing the identity of the contributing species with increased certainty.\nSignificant changes in the ESI-MS data are highlighted with coloured arrows and numbers indicating the total number of metals bound. The changes in the emission spectra generated by these species are highlighted using the same coloured arrows. In the\ncases where two species result in adjacent peaks in the mass spectrum ( e.g., Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A ) , the two species are separated by a slash and the major species is bolded. While these are not visible as two separate peaks when looking at the entire mass region, zoomed in regions of key peaks have been added as insets. Due to the complexity of the mixtures of Zn, Cu-MT species, we describe the data in terms of the change in the number of metal ions bound.\nM 3 to M 4 /M 5 . The first addition of Cu ( I ) to Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A results in the formation of an M 4 species, Zn 3 Cu 1 - \u03b2 MT1A, and a smaller amount of M 5 species, Zn 2 Cu 3 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 4 B, Zn 2 Cu 3 labelled with purple arrow and \u20185\u2019 for the total metals bound ) . Additional Cu ( I ) results in an increase in the abundance of both of these species and one Zn ( II ) in a fraction of both species is replaced by Cu ( I ) to form minor amounts of Zn 2 Cu 2 - \u03b2 MT1A and Zn 1 Cu 4 - \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 4 C ) .\nM 4 /M 5 to M 6 . The next species to form is M 6 which forms initially as Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( light blue arrow, blue \u20186\u2019 ) . We note that the formation of both Zn 2 Cu 3 - \u03b2 MT1A and Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A is preferred over the M 4 species, as evident by the formation of these species before Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A is fully consumed. The formation of the Zn 2 Cu 3 - \u03b2 MT1A is associated with emission intensity ( Fig. 5 A ) at 690 nm ( purple arrow ) . As the abundance of Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A increases in the MS data, the emission grows in intensity and redshifts to a \u03bbmax = 701 nm with 4.9 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound ( blue arrow ) .\nAdditional Cu ( I ) results in a gradual change from Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( blue arrow ) to Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A in the ESI-MS ( yellow arrow ) , until the Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A becomes the major species at 5.7 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound. The insets in Fig. 4 E and F show clear differences between the Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A when the mass region is expanded to show only the M 6 mass region. The change is clearer in Fig. 6 , where the M 6 peak is shown for seven steps in the titration, ranging from 3.48 mol. eq.to 5.84 mol. eq. bound. The experimental data was compared to MS simulations to determine the ratio of Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A: Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A. The transition from these two species is accompanied by a redshift in the Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A emission spectrum with \u03bbmax = 701 nm ( 4.9 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) ) to the Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A emission spectrum with \u03bbmax = 737 nm ( 5.7 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) ) . The Zn ( II ) , with its typically tetrahedral coordination in MT, is likely located within the cluster to share the thiols with some of the Cu ( I ) ions. The nine cysteines of the \u03b2 domain can bridge the one Zn ( II ) and 5 Cu ( I ) ions. We note that when Cu ( I ) is added to the apo- \u03b2 MT1A, a Cu 7 S 9 cluster is a dominant structure with a unique emission spectrum 60 which suggests the replacement of two Cu ( I ) with one Zn ( II ) while retaining the cluster structure is reasonable. The emission intensity also drastically drops at this point, indicating that a different structure has formed.\nThe drop in emission intensity is especially evident in Fig. 5 B, where the emission intensity has been normalized for the mol. eq. of Cu ( I ) bound. The lower emission intensity suggests that the Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A cluster and/or the protein backbone wrapped around it is more open or porous than the Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A cluster, which leads to an increase in triplet state deactivation. This is also seen directly in the luminescence decay profiles with Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A having a lifetime of 3.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcs ( \u03bbem = 700 nm ) and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A having a lifetime of 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcs ( \u03bbem = 800 nm ) ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ) .\nFigure 5 C summarizes the emission of the key species by showing the \u03bbmax as a function of Cu ( I ) bound to the protein. With the first 2\u20134 mol. eq. of Cu ( I ) bound, the \u03bbmax stays constant at about 690 nm and is characteristic of the Zn 2 Cu 3 - \u03b2 MT1A species. From 4\u20135 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound, there is a shift in the \u03bbmax to\nFig. 6 Series of experimental and simulated mass spectra showing the transition from 68 Zn 1 63 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A to 63 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A formed during the 63 Cu ( I ) titration of 29.6 \u03bcM 68 Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A titration.

Only a small amount of an M 7 species, Zn 1 Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A, orms even with excess Cu ( I ) added ( Fig. 4 F ) . To test whether the u 6 - \u03b2 MT1A was kinetically inhibited from expanding to Cu 7 - \u03b2 T1A, the sample containing Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A formed from Zn 3 - \u03b2 T1A was heated from room temperature to 60\u00b0C and allowed o equilibrate for 2 min before the mass spectrum was measured gain ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ) . Despite heating, no further metalation of the Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A was observed. This is unlike the Cu ( I ) itration into the apo- \u03b2 MT1A domain fragment where all of the rotein is readily converted from Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A to Cu 7 - \u03b2 MT1A.60\nhis suggests that the Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A species that forms from Zn 3 - \u03b2\nT1A is a different structure and that significant rearrangement ould likely be necessary to bind a 7 th Cu ( I ) to the protein.

The presence of key species has been shown in insets.\nM 4 to M 5 /M 6 . Cu ( I ) addition to Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A leads to the formation of M 5 and M 6 species. The M 5 species that form are Zn 4 Cu 1 - \u03b1 MT1A and Zn 3 Cu 2 - \u03b1 MT1A. As more Cu ( I ) is added, the M 6 species, Zn 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 7 B, shown by the blue arrow, blue \u20186\u2019 ) is formed. Additional Cu ( I ) converts the M 6 Zn 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A to the M 6 Zn 2 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 7 D, shown by orange arrow, orange \u20186\u2019 ) . Insets have been added to Fig. 7 C and D to demonstrate this subtle shift to lower mass; however, there is always a mixture of species as evident by the broad peak. The detailed transition from Zn 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A to Zn 2 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A is shown in Fig. 8 . The experimental MS peak for the mixture of Zn 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A and Zn 2 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A has been compared with simulations to determine the ratio of the species present at each Cu ( I ) level.\nThere is very weak emission with \u03bbmax = 590 nm when 2.9 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) are bound ( Fig. 9 ) . We attribute this emission to the formation of Zn 2 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A ( orange arrow ) .\nM 5 /M 6 to M 7 /M 8 . Further addition of Cu ( I ) increases the total number of metals bound to \u03b1 MT1A resulting in the M 7 species, Zn 2 Cu 5 - \u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 7 D, shown by the green arrow, green \u20187\u2019 ) . The metallation plateaus with this species with additional Cu ( I ) , meaning that the abundance of Zn 2 Cu 5 - \u03b1 MT1A increases and very little of the M 8 species, Zn 1 Cu 7 - \u03b1 MT1A, forms until about 6.3 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) are bound to the protein ( Fig. 7 G ) . The formation of Zn 2 Cu 5 - \u03b1 MT1A increases the emission intensity and results in a redshift in the emission spectra ( Fig. 9 , green arrow ) . As the amount of Cu ( I ) bound to the protein increases, the abundance of the Zn 1 Cu 7 - \u03b1 MT1A and Zn 1 Cu 8 - \u03b1 MT1A ( pink arrow, pink \u20189\u2019 ) also increases before the Zn ( II ) is removed forming Cu 10 - \u03b1 MT1A and Cu 11 - \u03b1 MT1A. The results in Figs 4 and 7 clearly show that the two domains have very different binding patterns.\nSignificant continuation of phosphorescent intensity at Cu ( I ) : MT ratios > 9 The phosphorescence intensity of the orange Cu ( I ) -thiolate emission measured at room temperature in solution has been characterized as arising from shielded Cu ( I ) -thiolate clusters.

The expectation is that ith > 7 Cu ( I ) bound to the initially apo protein, the cluster strucure collapses which exposes the Cu ( I ) to water, therefore deacivating the triplet state.60 As noted in the heading and shown n Fig. 9 , when starting from Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A, the phosphorescence ntensity is not quenched and actually increases with Cu ( I ) : MT atios > 9. The changes in metallation are accompanied by shifts in\nhe \u03bbmax to higher wavelengths. The phosphorescent lifetimes Supplementary Fig. S11 ) are slightly longer than those measured or the \u03b2 domain fragment, suggesting that the Cu ( I ) in the \u03b1 omain is slightly more shielded by the protein backbone. Since here is a mixture of species at each step, the lifetimes obtained re averages for all the species present. For example at the 6.3 eq. tep, the Zn 2 Cu 5 - \u03b1 MT1A, Zn 1 Cu 7 - \u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 1 Cu 8 - \u03b1 MT1A pecies have an average lifetime of 7.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcs. Unusually, the mission continues to grow ( \u03bbmax = 634 nm ) even after all of the\nn ( II ) has been displaced from the protein. This is especially evdent when the emission intensity is normalized for the amount f Cu ( I ) bound ( calculated from the ESI-MS ) ( Fig. 9 B ) . We would xpect the cluster structure in the protein to collapse in response o such high levels of Cu ( I ) and would therefore expect a decrease n the phosphorescence intensity. This effect is seen when Cu ( I ) s added to the apo \u03b1 domain fragment.60 However, this is not oberved when Cu ( I ) is added to Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A which suggests that he initial presence of the Zn ( II ) locks the protein backbone in a tructure that can accommodate the 10 th and 11 th Cu ( I ) in a clusered environment. Even at the end of the titration, the mixture f species has an average phosphorescent lifetime of 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs Supplementary Fig. S11 ) . Based on the X-ray structure of Zn 2 Cd 5 - T described by Robbins and Stout 82 where the clustered metals re clearly enveloped by the protein, we conclude that the Cu ( I ) n the Cu ( I ) -thiolate clusters is similarly enclosed by the remainer of the protein, thus excluding the solvent from accessing the u ( I ) -S excited state. Figure 9 C shows the trend in the \u03bbmax as a function of Cu ( I ) ound to the protein. There is a gradual redshift in the \u03bbmax o higher wavelengths. Notably, there is a lack of intermediary lateaus in the trend unlike the trend for the \u03b2 domain fragment n Fig. 5 C. This may be due to the fact that in the \u03b1 domain fragent, we always see a mixture of species that gradually shifts pon the addition of Cu ( I ) . If the binding of Cu ( I ) to Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A was strictly nonooperative, in which case Cu ( I ) binds on a statistical basis to the rst available cysteines, one would expect an approximately binoial distribution of species where the centre of the distribution hanges to higher metallated species as more metals are added. or example, in a Zn ( II ) titration of apo \u03b1 MT1A, an approximately inomial distribution of Zn 2 - \u03b1 MT1, Zn 3 - \u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A s observed in the ESI-MS when 3.9 mol. eq. of Zn ( II ) are bound to he protein.70 On the other hand, cooperative binding results in he formation of specific species without significant formation of ntermediate species. The difference in non-cooperative and cooprative binding is seen in Supplementary Fig. S2 of Melenbacher t al .60 While it is true that a distribution of species is present at ach step in the titration with no single species dominating, there re certain steps in the titration where the speciation deviates rom the expected binomial distribution, mainly at the 4.2 mol. q. point. In this spectrum, after the formation of the M 7 species, n 2 Cu 5 - \u03b1 MT1A, there is a significant absence of the M 8 species ndicating that the formation of these species is preferred over orming species with higher total number of metals. In contrast o the apo \u03b1 domain, the high degree of cooperativity is not seen hen Zn ( II ) is present.60\nu ( I ) displacement of Zn ( II ) in Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A orms mixed metal Zn, Cu species: Zn ( II ) s not displaced strictly on a stoichiometric r charge basis\n3 Cu ( I ) was titrated stepwise into a solution of 68 Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A t pH 7.4 and room temperature, and the resulting sequence of pecies was measured by both ESI-MS ( Fig. 10 ) and emission specroscopy ( Fig. 11 ) . In the case where two species result in two adacent, but resolved peaks in the mass spectrum ( e.g., Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 T1A and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ) , the two species are separated by a lash and the major species is bolded.

What we mean by this, is that the Zn ( II ) is retained in the protein longer than expected.\nM 7 to M 10 . Cu ( I ) binds to the initial M 7 species, Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, which results in a series of species starting with Zn 7 Cu 1 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, Zn 5 Cu 4 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A with 1.4 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound ( Fig. 10 B ) . There is very weak emission indicating some of the Cu ( I ) are bound in a shielded environment ( Fig. 11 A ) . Further additions of Cu ( I ) increase the abundances of these species, with Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( identified by a dark blue arrow and a blue \u201810\u2019 for the total number of metals bound in Fig. 10 C ) serving as the first plateau in the titration, meaning that as more Cu ( I ) is added, the previous species are consumed to form more Zn 5 Cu 5 -MT1A before metallating the protein further. The initial species, Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, is still present during the formation of Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A indicating that the formation of Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A is preferred over metallating all of the protein to a species with less Cu ( I ) . With the\nincrease in Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, the emission intensity increases and the \u03bbmax redshifts to 684 nm ( Fig. 11 A ) . There is a gradual transition from Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A to Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 10 E, shown by the yellow arrow and yellow \u201810\u2019 for the total number of metals bound ) with the majority of the M 10 species being Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A by 6.6 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound. Insets in Fig. 10 C and D show an expanded view of the M 10 peak, though the changes are more evident when examining a series of mass spectra and comparing these changes to simulations ( Fig. 12 ) . This allows the exact ratios of Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A: Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A to be determined.\nThe transition from Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A to Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A is accompanied by the appearance of a shoulder in the emission band at about 750 nm ( Fig. 11 B, yellow arrow ) . As the fraction of Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A increases, the emission intensity decreases as the cluster within the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species is less emissive than that of the Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A.

The M 12 species n 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A/Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A are the next plateaus in the itration as we see no further metallated species ( M > 12 ) over he next \u223c2 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) bound ( Fig. 10 E and F ) . The distinct ack of a binomial distribution of species, which would occur if inding were strictly on a statistical basis, indicates that the foration of Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A is slightly preferred over the earlier pecies as well as further metallation. The formation of Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b1 MT1A results in a slight decrease in emission intensity and edshift to \u03bbmax = 703 nm ( Fig. 11 B ) ( orange arrow ) due to the loss f the more intense emission band from the Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. verall, the emission spectrum of Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A is similar to he Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A emission in the 700\u2013900 nm range.

There are slight changes in the emission spectra between 600 and 700 nm suggesting that the transition from the Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 to Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A may result in a very weakly emitting cluster in the \u03b1 domain. The lifetime of the Cu ( I ) cluster in the Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species is 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs ( \u03bbem = 800 nm ) ( decay trace shown in Supplementary Fig. S15 ) . M 13 to M 20 . Also at 9.6 mol. eq., the M 13 species form, Zn 2 Cu 11 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 1 Cu 12 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. Remarkably, the final Zn ( II ) remains bound to the protein with up to 14 Cu ( I ) ions ( Fig. 10 G, green arrow ) . The first Cu ( I ) -only species to form is Cu 16 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( pink arrow, pink \u201816\u2019 ) ( Fig. 10 H ) . The end of the titration is characterized by approximately binomial distributions of species with up to 20 Cu ( I ) ions ( Fig. 10 I ) . This suggests a non-cooperative binding mode, akin to cysteine modification, which is clearly different from the earlier steps of the titration.\nThe Cu ( I ) -thiolate cluster phosphorescence intensity remains high even with Cu ( I ) : MT ratios > 12 It is striking that the emission intensity at 634 nm remains high ( Fig. 11 C and D ) , even as more Cu ( I ) is added. The emission from 750\u2013900 nm is constant after 6.6 mol. eq., which we assigned to a Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain. Therefore, changes in the spectra after 6.6 mol. eq. from 550 to 750 nm are due to metallation of the \u03b1 domain. The emission spectra in Fig. 11 C and D show the formation of a single band with \u03bbmax = 634 nm which we suggest to be from the species forming after Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A up to Cu 20 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( pink arrow ) . The last species to form, Cu 17 , Cu 18 , Cu 19 , Cu 20 , have a phosphorescent lifetime of 3.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs ( \u03bbem = 630 nm, Supplementary Fig. S15 ) .\nThe inset in Fig. 11 D shows the 18.2 mol. eq. spectrum ( red ) and the result of subtracting the 6.6 mol. eq. spectrum ( plotted in black ) , i.e., the Cu 6 \u03b2 emission, to obtain the emission band of the \u03b1 domain Cu ( I ) cluster ( blue ) . The emission spectra from the \u03b1 domain fragment ( Fig. 9 ) are similar to this spectrum in the inset which supports our hypothesis that the \u03b1 domain is responsible for the continued presence of emission at the end of the titration. This is unlike the Cu ( I ) titration into apo MT1A 39 which suggests that the initial presence of the Zn ( II ) in the \u03b1 domain aligns the protein in such a way that the increasing number of Cu ( I ) ions bound occupy a clustered binding site."

The use of this 3D block diagram format separates the sequential formation of species in both the X and Z directions such that the stoichiometric changes taking place as a function of Cu ( I ) bound to the protein can be clearly observed. This figure emphasizes the fact that there are two different metallation pathways for the \u03b2 MT1A ( Fig. 13 A ) and \u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 13 B ) domain fragments.

Overall, these diagrams show how the \u03b2 domain has maximum aturation with 6 Cu ( I ) , whereas the \u03b1 domain binds to form a umber of species with a maximum of 11 Cu ( I ) . We speculate that he formation of the Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain may be strengthned by the occurrence of the four Cys-X-Cys motifs ( Fig. 1 ) in the domain which may provide a more systemic series of donor lignds. The additional cysteines in the \u03b1 domain appear to stabiize the presence of the Zn ( II ) together with the Cu ( I ) . In the abence of the Zn ( II ) , the maximum cluster size in the \u03b1 domain ragment was found to be Cu 7 S 9 .60 The key features are that in he \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( to be described below ) , the species forming in the domain, for example Cu 6 - \u03b2, and the species in the \u03b1 domain, or example Zn 1 Cu 8 - \u03b1, exist together ( Table 3 ) . In particular, the ixture of the Zn, Cu ratios in the \u03b1 domain can only be deterined using the isotopically pure 68 Zn ( II ) and 63 Cu ( I ) because of he extensive overlap of the natural abundance isotopes. nexpected retention of the Zn ( II ) he presence of this single Zn ( II ) with its binding constant 83 of 0 11 in the presence of a huge stoichiometric excess of Cu ( I ) with ts binding constant of 10 19 is totally unexpected. The 10 19 value or MT is based on the K F value for the formation of Cu 10 -MT2 deermined by Banci et al .9 and updated with a more accurate DTT inding constant from Xiao et al .84 In previous studies, analysis f the spectral data assumed that Cu ( I ) would systematically dislace the Zn ( II ) on a stoichiometric or charge basis.68 , 71 , 72 Even n studies using ESI-MS methods, the presence of the Zn ( II ) was isguised by the significant overlap of the natural abundance isoopic masses.73\u201375\nThe presence of Zn ( II ) in \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A increases the number of table species that form at physiological pH. We have previously eported that Cu ( I ) -thiolate species containing specifically 4, 6, 0, and 13 Cu ( I ) ions are formed from apo- \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A with few ntermediate species.39 , 60 In the cell, it is likely that Cu ( I ) will be inding to partially metallated Zn ( II ) -MT or newly synthesized po-MT. The presence of multiple stable Zn, Cu species cements he idea that MT is a good candidate for Zn ( II ) and Cu ( I ) storage s this would require flexibility in the stoichiometry. Most species orm at a relatively similar abundance, suggesting that the energy inimum for this group of species is very broad.\nse of the \u03b2 domain and \u03b1 domain fragment data o analyse \u03b2\u03b1 speciation: metallation of the Zn 3 - \u03b2 nd Zn 4 - \u03b1 fragments with Cu ( I ) match the etallation pathway of the Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A e can gain insight into the specific clusters that form in each doain of the Zn, Cu- \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species by analysing the ESI-MS metllation and emission profiles of the Zn 3 - \u03b2-MT1A and Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A omain fragments ( Table 3 ) . We have previously used this method ith the apo protein.60 The use of the fragments gives valuable inight into the domain structures of the Zn, Cu- \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species n the absence of NMR or X-ray structures. The key species are ummarized graphically in Supplementary Fig. S16.\nu ( I ) binds first to the \u03b2 domain leaving Zn 4 - \u03b1. Previously, we have hown that Cu ( I ) preferentially binds to the apo \u03b2 domain over he apo \u03b1 domain.60 Assuming Cu ( I ) also preferentially binds to he \u03b2 domain of Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, the species that form in the Zn 3 - domain fragment upon addition of Cu ( I ) combined with Zn 4 in he \u03b1 domain accounts for the species that form in the first half f the titration of Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. For example, Zn 3 Cu 1 , Zn 1 Cu 5 , nd Cu 6 in the \u03b2 domain and an intact Zn 4 cluster in the \u03b1 doain would result in the stoichiometries seen in the full protein: n 7 Cu 1 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. This is upported by the similarities in the Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( 684 nm ) and n 1 Cu 5 - \u03b2 MT1A ( 700 nm ) as well as similarities in the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 T1A ( 750 nm ) and Cu 6 - \u03b2 MT1A ( 738 nm ) emission spectra. We herefore attribute the emission in the Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( 684 nm ) nd Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( 750 nm ) species to be from a Zn 1 Cu 5 and u 6 cluster, respectively, in the \u03b2 domain with a non-emissive Zn 4 luster in the \u03b1 domain. The trend in the relative emissiveness f the transition from Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A to Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A also racks the trend in emissiveness seen in the \u03b2 domain fragment. he Cu 6 cluster formed from the apo \u03b2 domain fragment also has similar emission spectrum.60\nfter \u03b2 domain is saturated with 6 Cu ( I ) , the \u03b1 domain binds Cu ( I ) . The esults from the Cu ( I ) metallation of Zn 3 \u03b2-MT1A ( Fig. 4 ) suggest hat after forming the Cu 6 cluster within the \u03b2 domain of \u03b2\u03b1 T1A, the \u03b2 domain cannot accommodate more Cu ( I ) . Therefore, ne would expect that the formation of species after Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 T1A is due to the metallation of the \u03b1 domain. The species orming in \u03b1-MT1A, Zn 4 Cu 1, Zn 3 Cu 2 , and Zn 3 Cu 3 , and Zn2Cu4, ombined with Cu 6 in the \u03b2 domain explain the stoichiometry f the remaining \u03b2\u03b1 species, Zn 4 Cu 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, Zn 3 Cu 8 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/1/m fac101/6965832 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nZn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. The mass spectra in Figs 7 C and 10 E as well as Fig. 7 H and G have similar profiles providing further evidence that metallation of the \u03b1 domain is responsible for this part of the titration. The emission spectra of the Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A resemble the spectrum for Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A suggesting that the emitting cluster for all of these species is a Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain. The Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A/Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A mixture also has the same phosphorescent lifetime as the Cu 6 cluster formed in the \u03b2 domain fragment. While the phosphorescent lifetime of the Cu 6 cluster in the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( measured at 5.4 mol. eq. Cu ( I ) ) appears to decrease for the same Cu 6 cluster in the Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species, the lifetime measured at 5.4 mol. eq. of Cu ( I ) may appear longer due to overlap of the emission bands. A small amount of emission from the Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A ( which has a longer lifetime ) at the same wavelength as the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A may be present, therefore inflating the measured lifetime. For Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 2 Cu 10 , with an emissive Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain, this leaves Zn 3 Cu 3 and Zn 2 Cu 4 in the \u03b1 domain which appear to be non-emissive. However, species forming with M > 12 have emission at 634 nm, which is characteristic of the \u03b1 domain emission. This indicates that emissive clusters form in the \u03b1 domain with a combination of Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) . For example, the last Zn ( II ) containing species, Zn 1 Cu 14 , is formed as a result of a Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain and a mixed metal Zn 1 Cu 8 cluster in the \u03b1 domain.\nThe total cationic charge is surprisingly constant while Cu ( I ) is added to Zn ( II ) -MT Examining the cationic charge from the metals in each Zn, Cu\u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species reveals that most species have a combination of metals that sums to a charge of 14 + to 16 + ( Supplementary Fig. S17 ) with only one species having a cationic charge of < 14 + . We suggest that species with this range of cationic charge may be more stable and Zn ( II ) is retained in the cluster region until enough Cu ( I ) has been added to maintain the charge within this region of stability. The charges of the species forming in the \u03b2 and \u03b1 domain fragments can also be calculated and added together to model the full \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A protein ( Table 3 ) . This analysis assumes that the Cu ( I ) displaces Zn ( II ) in the \u03b2 domain first, leaving the four Zn ( II ) ions in the \u03b1 domain with an 8 + charge. Once the \u03b2 domain forms Cu 6 , the charges for the \u03b1 domain species are added to the 6 + charge of the Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain. At each combination of \u03b2 and \u03b1 domain fragment species, the summed charge is equal to the charge of the species measured experimentally in the full \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A protein. For example, the 6 + charge of Cu 6 and the 8 + charge of Zn 4 sum together to the 14 + charge of Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. This provides strong supporting evidence that the stoichiometries of the clusters forming in each domain within the full \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A protein systematically follow the species that form in the individual domain fragments. The species with charges of 17 + to 20 + are less stable and occur when the binding pattern has shifted to a non-specific thiolate binding pathway, akin to cysteine modification, as evident by the binomial distributions of species.\nOur results in context with previous reports"

            "text": "ESI-MS provides details of all species in solution allowing for the determination of the exact stoichiometry of the possibly many species that exist at each step in the titration. The data in this paper illustrate the complexity of metallation with two different metals, but there is also complexity in the metallation of MTs with\na single metal. In the past, the extent of metallation was often determined using atomic absorption spectrometry ( AAS ) or inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry ( ICP-AES ) . More recently ICP-MS has also been used. Without the separation of each metallated species, which is not typically carried out before analysis, these techniques provide an average of the metallation status such that there is no information on the distribution of the metals in different species. This can be misleading when there are multiple species present or the presence of cooperativity. We now discuss some previous results of Zn, Cu-MTs that were found before ESI-MS was widely available. For example, Chen et al .38 , 65 quantify Cd, Zn, and Cu in rat kidney MT using AAS. They conclude that the MT1 isolated from rat kidney cytosol contains a 1:1 ratio of Cu: Zn.65 Our ESI-MS results suggest that either Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A or Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A could be possibilities for the MT stoichiometry in the kidney as these are the only species we find with a 1:1 ratio. However, our results only take account of the species that form when Cu ( I ) is added to Zn 7 -MT1A, which may not be the case in vivo . Similarly, Zn, Cu-MT1/2 has been extracted from calf liver samples. Chen et al .38 reported a range of Cu: Zn ratios by AAS methods. Notably, a sample containing 9.6 g atoms of metal/mol protein had a Cu: Zn ratio of 1.4, which would be similar to the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species we report.\nOur results on Cu ( I ) binding to the \u03b2 domain fragment of human MT1A can be compared to the previous studies of the \u03b2 domain fragment of mouse MT1.72 Bofill et al . report the cooperative formation of a Zn 1 Cu 4 cluster in the \u03b2 domain fragment of mouse MT1.72 In this study, the metal content was also determined by AAS. In our results, we see multiple species continuously throughout the titration and only minor amounts of this Zn 1 Cu 4 - \u03b2 MT1A species. With only the average metal binding available from the AAS data, it is possible that a fraction of the protein measured by Bofill et al .72 may have had more than 4 Cu ( I ) bound. This is seen in our studies of the human \u03b2 MT1A domain fragment where with an average of 4.2 Cu ( I ) ions bound to the protein, a variety of species are seen with most having 3\u20135 Cu ( I ) ions bound.\nWe can also compare our \u03b1 domain fragment and \u03b2\u03b1 results with the species reported to form from natural abundance Zn 4 - \u03b1 mouse MT and Zn 7 - mouse MT by Bofill et al .73 The three species reported to form from Zn 4 - \u03b1 mouse MT after the addition of natural abundance Cu ( I ) are Zn 2 Cu 3 - \u03b1 mouse MT, Zn 1 Cu 4 - \u03b1 mouse MT, and Zn 1 Cu 5 - \u03b1 mouse MT. We do not see species with these stoichiometries forming, rather at the point at which 5 or 6 metals are bound to the human \u03b1 MT1A, we see mainly Zn 4 Cu 1 - \u03b1 MT1A, Zn 3 Cu 3 - \u03b1 MT1A, and Zn 2 Cu 4 - \u03b1 MT1A ( Fig. 7 ) . In addition, Bofill et al .73 report several Zn, Cu \u03b2\u03b1 species, including Zn 3 Cu 7 -MT. From our results reported in Fig. 10 , we find that when 10 metals are bound to the protein, there are still 5 Zn ( II ) ions present in human \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. These differences in stoichiometric ratios may be due to the methods used to quantify the stoichiometry. While ESI-MS was used by Bofill et al .,73 the closeness of the Cu ( I ) and Zn ( II ) natural abundance masses required the additional use of ICP-AES to determine stoichiometry: Chelex-100 was used to bind the displaced Zn ( II ) and then the metals bound to the protein were quantified using ICP-AES.73 This technique results in the average metal content in the solution, which again makes determination of specific stoichiometric ratios very difficult.\nThe importance of using isotopically pure elements With the use of isotopically pure 63 Cu ( I ) and 68 Zn ( II ) , we have resolved the longstanding difficulty of determining the exact stoichiometry of mixed Zn, Cu-MT species. The use of isotopically pure elements has been used successfully in previous MS studies\no w t M r M s s i u e\nC T t C m t m o t l m m a\ns t t w \u03b2 m o m M c C v i c e s p h m m f Z f t o\nM i o f \u03b2 c t Z t o\nM i a o t c f o c t\nS S\nA W i t m D E\nF W o D\nC T\nA A o fi\nD T i\nR 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/1/m fac101/6965832 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nf proteins. For example, in a study by Blindauer et al .77 67 Zn ( II ) as used to study Zn ( II ) exchange in the Zn 4 cluster of cyanobacerial MT. Only one Zn ( II ) ion was found to be inert to exchange.77\neloni and Va\u0161\u00e1k 78 used isotopically pure 63 Cu ( I ) and 67 Zn ( II ) and eported the removal of Cu ( II ) from \u03b1 synuclein- 63 Cu ( II ) by MT3. ore recently, Crack et al .79 used isotopically pure 34 S to label the ulphide ions of FeS clusters which allowed the unambiguous asignment of the FeS cluster stoichiometry. Together, these studies llustrate the dramatic increase in information that is obtained sing a combination of ESI-MS methods and isotopically pure lements.\nonclusions he novel use of isotopically pure 68 Zn ( II ) and 63 Cu ( I ) eliminates he overlapping isotopic patterns of natural abundance Zn ( II ) and u ( I ) which is required to determine the stoichiometry of mixed etal Zn, Cu-MT species. This, in combination with MS simulaions, reduces the difficulty in analysing the MS data of mixed etal Zn, Cu-MT species, allowing for the exact determination f the stoichiometry of all Zn, Cu-MT species that form upon he addition of 63 Cu ( I ) to 68 Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. Room temperature soution phosphorescence measurements, combined with ESI-MS easurements, allow the unambiguous identification of multiple ixed Zn, Cu-thiolate clusters in MT1A that exhibit specific \u03bbmax nd \u03bcs lifetimes. We used the \u03b2 and \u03b1 domain fragment room temperature emision spectra in parallel with the stepwise ESI-MS data to guide he assignment of the \u03b2\u03b1 emission spectra. The addition of Cu ( I ) o Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A resulted in the formation of Zn 5 Cu 5 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, hich exhibits emission at 684 nm due to a Zn 1 Cu 5 cluster in the domain. The appearance of a shoulder at 750 nm with the foration of the Zn 4 Cu 6 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A species is due to the formation f a Cu 6 cluster, with the Cu ( I ) again located solely in the \u03b2 doain. Addition of Cu ( I ) to form Zn 3 Cu 9 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A and Zn 2 Cu 10 - \u03b2\u03b1 T1A resulted in very little change in the emission spectra, indiating the continued presence of the Cu 6 - \u03b2 cluster. The additional u ( I ) clearly binds to the \u03b1 domain and is either not emissive or ery weakly emissive at this stage. Further metallation resulted n an increase in emission intensity at 634 nm that arises from lusters forming in the \u03b1 domain. Even at the end of the titration, mission spectra characteristic of Cu ( I ) -thiolate clusters were oberved, which is quite unlike Cu ( I ) metallation of the apo MT1A rotein with molar excess Cu ( I ) .39 The emission intensity remains igh at the end of the titration with the Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A domain fragent or Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A, but not for the Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A domain fragent. The initial presence of the Zn ( II ) must have a profound efect on the overall structure of the \u03b1 domain. We suggest that the n ( II ) locks the \u03b1 domain in a specific conformation that allows or the Zn, Cu ( I ) -thiolate cluster structure and later the pure Cu ( I ) - hiolate cluster structure to be maintained even in the presence f molar excess Cu ( I ) . Finally, we combined all of the species forming in the Zn 3 - \u03b2 T1A and Zn 4 - \u03b1 MT1A domain fragments upon Cu ( I ) addition to dentify each domain\u2019s contribution to the overall stoichiometry f species forming in the Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A protein. The species that ormed in the Zn 3 - \u03b2 MT1A domain fragment also form in the full \u03b1 MT1A protein while the \u03b1 domain remains as Zn 4 . This acounts for all the species that form in the first half of the titraion of Cu ( I ) into Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A. The species that formed in the n 4 - \u03b1 MT1A domain fragment then form in \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A in combinaion with the Cu 6 cluster that has already formed in the \u03b2 domain f the \u03b2\u03b1-MT1A which accounts for all the species forming in \u03b2\u03b1\nT1A in the second half of the titration. Further, we have examned the cationic charge brought in by the metals in each species nd have found that Cu ( I ) binding to Zn 7 - \u03b2\u03b1 MT1A protein occurs ver a narrow, stable region of 14 + to 16 + . The cationic charge of he species that form in the \u03b2 domain combined with the cationic harge of Zn 4 - \u03b1 combine to the cationic charges of the species orming in the first half of the \u03b2\u03b1 titration. The cationic charge f the Cu 6 cluster in the \u03b2 domain combined with the cationic harges of the \u03b1 domain species add up to the cationic charges of he species formed in the second half of the \u03b2\u03b1 titration.\nupplementary material upplementary data are available at Metallomics online.\ncknowledgements e thank Mr John Vanstone and the personnel in the Electroncs Shop for the outstanding maintenance of our instruments.
