            "text": "Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Gregory et al., 2017). Intrinsic ageing, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (Lakatta & Levy, 2003), is an inevitable process that is driven by accumulating, non- repaired DNA damage, which also has implications for cardiovascular function (del Campo et al., 2020; Durik et al., 2012; Kovacic et al., 2011). DNA damage can be induced by different sources like endogenous (e.g. generation of reactive oxygen species [ROS], and other oxidative reactions) or exogenous (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations) reactive agents that may cause hundred thousands of DNA lesions per cell per day which lead to vascular dysfunction and ageing (Incalza et al., 2018). A number of genetically modified mouse strains have been generated that model accelerated ageing based on a specific deficiency in their DNA repair system. Among them, the Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mouse is a convenient model to study vascular ageing. The detailed features of the mouse model have been outlined before (Durik et al., 2012; Weeda et al., 1997). In brief, Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice have a short life span of around 24\u2013 28 weeks and display many human- like ageing characteristics like neurodegeneration, osteoporosis, liver, kidney, heart, and muscle dysfunction that mostly start from the age of 12 weeks (Durik et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2017) Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice have been used to study general ageing mechanisms, in which the liver is taken as the organ for target exploration because it is one of the most severely affected organs, and this is believed to contribute to the reduced life span (Durik et al., 2012; Weeda et al., 1997). In addition, the Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mouse is a relevant murine model to study non- atherosclerotic vascular ageing and mimic key features of non- atherosclerotic vascular ageing in humans (Bautista- Nino et al., 2020). Based on conditional, cre- lox- mediated gene deletion, endothelium- specific Ercc1 knockout mice have been generated by us previously. Also, in these animals, accelerated non- atherosclerotic vascular ageing is observed, and longevity is reduced to 24\u2013 28 weeks (Ehsan Ataei Ataabadi et al., 2021; Bautista- Nino et al., 2020). Vascular ageing features in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice are increased vascular stiffness, decreased vasomotor function, increased wall thickness, and increased cellular senescence. The vasomotor dysfunction involves decreased vasodilation that is mainly mediated by reduced nitric oxide- soluble guanylate cyclase- cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO- sGC- cGMP) signaling pathway, a major player in dysfunction of the aged cardiovascular system (Durik et al., 2012). In the vasculature, NO binds sGC in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and generates the second messenger cGMP. Elevated cGMP leads to VSMC relaxation, vasodilation, and reduction in blood pressure. However, cGMP could also have anti- fibrotic and anti- remodeling effects (Sandner et al., 2017;\nSandner & Stasch, 2017) and might be able to decrease inflammation (Ahluwalia et al., 2004). Due to its abundance throughout the body, the pathogenesis of various diseases has been linked to inappropriate NO- sGC- cGMP signaling (Breitenstein et al., 2017; Durgin et al., 2019; Kolijn et al., 2020; Stasch et al., 2002). Interruption of this pivotal signaling pathway could be at least in part due to oxidative stress.\nIn physiological conditions NO binds to the reduced ferrous (Fe2+) heme group in the \u03b2- subunit of sGC, inducing a conformational change of sGC and thereby strongly increasing its cGMPproduction. Under oxidative stress conditions, this Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+, therefore, losing the NO- binding capacity which stops NOsGC binding, activation and cGMP formation (Shah et al., 2018). Persisting oxidative stress finally also leads to heme- free (apo) sGC which cannot bind NO either (Breitenstein et al., 2017). Recently, it has been shown that an SMC- specific cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), is able to reduce sGC back to the native form, further supporting a redox equilibrium in diseases (Rahaman et al., 2017). Given the negative impact of oxidative stress on NO- sGC- cGMP signaling previously observed by us and others (Durik et al., 2012), in DNA repair- deficient accelerated ageing mice, including the Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mouse model, we hypothesized that sGC oxidation might underlie the vasodilator dysfunction in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice. If so, cGMP signaling might be restored by using a sGC activator or sGC stimulator. Since sGC activators can activate cGMP production under oxidative stress conditions and independent of NO, whereas stimulators activate non- oxidized native sGC (Peter Sandner et al., 2021), we have chosen sGC activators for this study. We examined if chronic sGC activator treatment from 8 to 17 weeks of age would attenuate features of vascular ageing and affect longevity in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice. Altogether, considering sGC as a key enzyme in NO\u2013 cGMP signaling and given the diminished NO- cGMP function in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212, we aimed to study the effect of chronic sGC activation in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 accelerated ageing mice, focusing on changes of NO- cGMP responsiveness, DNA damage- related vascular dysfunction, and potential beneficial effects on survival."

BAY- treated mice showed no significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for both dosages when compared to control, non- supplemented chow. However, there was a moderate numerical trend of BP reduction with the high dose which was not significant and did not affect mouse behavior (Figure 1a). We therefore chose the high dose of 200 mg/kg/day for the chronic treatment studies, which warrants the highest drug exposure whilst minimizing the chance of a BP lowering effect. There were no significant differences in food consumption among all the groups (Figure 1b)."

Hereto, concentration response curves (CRCs) of vasorelaxing substances were constructed after preconstricting rings. Preconstriction with 30 nmol/L of U46619 showed a significant reduction in vasoconstriction of both Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 groups compared with WT groups (WT vehicle: 5.36 \u00b1 0.9; WT BAY 54\u2013 6544: 5.47 \u00b1 1.4; Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 vehicle: 2.23 \u00b1 0.5; Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 BAY 54\u2013 6544: 2.59 \u00b1 0.4. All values are in milli newton [mN]). CRCs were constructed by addition of either endothelium dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) or endothelium- independent vasodilators sodium nitroprusside (SNP), sGC stimulator BAY 41\u2013 8543, and sGC activator BAY 60\u2013 2770 in parallel rings.\nThe aortic ACh response was lower in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice than in the corresponding WT mice. Chronic treatment tended to improve endothelium- dependent response in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice (Figure 3a; P=NS). Inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and endothelium- dependent hyperpolarization (EDH) in aortic segments of both WT groups revealed that the majority of the response to ACh is mediated by NO, while the contribution of EDH was more modest. (Figure 3b and c). In the Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice, the NO\u2013 cGMP response was smaller (p < 0.05, GLM- RM) than in WT mice (Figure 3d and e). EDH was absent in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice (Figure 3d), while BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment restored EDH (Figure 3e).\nThe endothelium- independent response to SNP in vehicletreated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice was significantly diminished and BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment fully restored the response to the level in WT mice (Figure 3f; p < 0.03). The acute endothelium- independent response to the sGC activator BAY 60\u2013 2770 was similar in all groups (Figure 3g). The same was true for the response to the sGC stimulator BAY 41\u2013 8543 in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 and WT mice (Figure 3h)."

            "text": "The improved survival and vascular function prompted us to look further into general ageing features, first focusing on inflammation (Ahluwalia et al., 2004). The plasma levels of TNF- \u03b1 and IL- 6 were significantly increased in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 versus corresponding WT mice (Figure 4a and b). BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice modestly reduced cytokine levels, so that the difference versus WT vehicle- treated mice was no longer significant (Figure 4a and b). Plasma levels of IL- 2, IL- 4, and IFN- \u03b3 were below the lower limit of quantification.\nInflammation can relate to senescence and its senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (Yousefzadeh et al., 2020). Senescence marker p16 mRNA expression in liver was significantly higher in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 than in the corresponding WT mice, and there was a trend of p16 upregulation in aorta (p = 0.07) (Figure 5a and b). p21 mRNA expression was significantly higher in liver and aorta of vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 than in the corresponding WT mice (Figure 5c and d). BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment reduced p16\nand p21 mRNA in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice, so that no significant increase vs. WT mice was present anymore (Figures 5a\u2013 d). The same was true for Ccl2 and Il- 6 mRNA expression in liver and aorta (Figures 5e\u2013 h).\nAgeing has also been related to oxidative stress, and an upregulation of anti- oxidant pathways has been identified as vascular protective and anti- ageing. Two key reductase enzymes CYB5R3 and NADPH Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) are markers for anti- oxidative effects of drug treatment, as well as dietary restriction (DR), the best- known anti- ageing treatment (Calvo- Rubio et al., 2016; Diaz- Ruiz et al., 2018). Moreover, CYB5R3 has been implicated in sGC reduction. Cyb5r3 mRNA expression in aorta was at the same level in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 and the corresponding WT mice. After BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment, there was a trend toward upregulation in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 and WT mice (Figure 6a). In contrast to vascular tissue, Cyb5r3 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in liver of vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 compared with the corresponding WT mice. BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment increased Cyb5r3 in the Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mouse liver (Figure 6b).\nNqo1 mRNA expression in both aorta and liver were significantly lower in vehicle- treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 than in the corresponding WT mice, and after treatment with BAY 54\u2013 6544, these differences were not significant anymore (Figure 6c and d). There were no differences within WT groups for Cyb5r3 and Nqo1 neither in aorta nor in liver (Figures 6a\u2013 d).\nWith the use of a set of key antioxidant genes that mark the protective effects of DR in ageing (Birkisdottir et al., 2021; Vermeij et al., 2016), we further mapped the effect of chronic BAY 54\u2013 6544 on anti- oxidant pathways in liver. Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice showed upregulated anti- oxidant systems (Figure 6e). On top of that BAY 54\u2013 6544 further enlarged the panel of genes that show increased expression. The same panel was augmented in BAY 54\u2013 6544 treated WT mice (Figure 6e). As was the case in the vascular tissue, acute effects of BAY 41\u2013 8543 and BAY 60\u2013 2770 were similar, leaving no indication for domination of heme- oxidated vs. native sGC or vice versa (Figure 6f)."

Combined, these observations plead for a blood pressure- independent effect of BAY 54\u2013 6544. A question arising from the observation that BAY 54\u2013 6544 mimics aspect of dietary restriction is the possibility that the mice ate less. However, food intake was measured in our pilot experiment, and there was no indication of a reduced eating behavior after BAY 54\u2013 6544 (data not shown), nor did treatment animals lose weight compared with controls (Figure 1). BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment improved reactive hyperemia was improved in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice. After BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment, a trend toward improved endothelium- dependent response and a restored EDH pathway was observed in ex vivo vascular function measurements in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice aorta. The endothelium- independent response to NO, provided by SNP in organ baths, was significantly improved by BAY 54\u2013 6544 in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 aortas. Considering dysfunctional NO- sGC- cGMP signaling in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice and the possible contribution of oxidative stress in impairing physiologic sGC function through oxidation, we assumed that the sGC activator is more efficacious than the stimulator. This prompted us to choose an sGC activator for the chronic treatment. However, to test whether the oxidative stress also directly affects sGC, the acute response of aortic rings was investigated by ex vivo organ bath measurements. The sGC activator is working preferentially on the oxidized and heme- free sGC and the sGC stimulator targeting the native sGC. We observed the same maximum relaxation response for both sGC activator BAY 60\u2013 2770 and sGC stimulator BAY 41\u2013 8543 suggesting that there might be a balance of oxidized and native form of sGC in this acute setting. A similar observation was made when comparing cGMP production in liver between both\nBAY compounds. Therefore, heme oxidation of sGC does not appear to be central in failing NO\u2014 cGMP signalling in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice. This is in line with previous studies where it was shown that increased cGMP metabolism by phosphodiesterase was the major reason for decreased vasodilation (Bautista Nino et al., 2015; Durik et al., 2012). In parallel with the survival and vascular effect, we detected an increased expression of genes involved in anti- oxidant defense, observed also in DR effects on ageing (Vermeij et al., 2016). In addition, a trend toward attenuation of inflammation and senescence markers was seen. These changes are not restricted to vascular tissue, but manifest themselves also in liver, an organ that is often used to study changes in common ageing pathways in various models (Schumacher et al., 2008; Vermeij et al., 2016)."

This observation, however, prompts the question why SNP cannot elicit a maximal relaxation.

In summary, the following model can be constructed: In untreated WT mice, in which endothelium is intact, only sGC nitrosylation limits NO- cGMP signaling. In contrast, in untreated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice ACh responses are decreased by lower endothelial NO release and higher PDE metabolism of cGMP in VSMC. SNP responses are limited by PDE and sGC nitrosylation in VSMC. Since BAY compounds bypass NO and sGC nitrolysation, these two limiting factors will not affect vasodilation responses to such compounds. In addition, the PDE increase is overruled. This might be due to abundant cGMP generation, saturating the pool of PDE with substrate.\n3.1.2 | Chronic sGC activation studies\nChronic in vivo treatment with the sGC activator BAY 54\u2013 6544 in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 significantly improved the endothelium- independent response to NO, provided by SNP, in conduit arteries measured ex vivo. In addition, there was a trend toward an improved endotheliumdependent response to ACh after BAY 54\u2013 6544. Counterintuitively, instead of increasing NO- dependent endothelium- mediated relaxation chronic BAY 54\u2013 6544 increased the contribution of EDH in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212. This paradoxical treatment effect can be explained by a paradigm that combines two signaling changes. The first change is induced by the decreased production of NO in the endothelium. Decreased NO- mediated responses are often associated with increased EDH (Goto & Kitazono, 2019). As in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice NO production in the endothelium is reduced (Durik et al., 2012), an increase of EDH can be expected, causing the ACh response to rely more on EDH than on NO release as compared with WT mice. The present study shows that endothelial NO is not improved by chronic BAY 54\u2013 6544, and therefore EDH is expected to still be increased also after treatment in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice. The second signaling change is due to the impact of BAY 54- 6544- induced cGMP increase in VSMC on EDH. Prolonged, strong increase of cGMP has been linked to dimerization of the effector protein kinase G (PKG). In turn, PKG dimerization has been shown to activate of BKCa2+ channels in VSMC, a process that can also take place independently from cGMP through redox regulation and PKG oxidation (Ataei Ataabadi et al., 2020; Burgoyne et al., 2012; Feelisch et al., 2020; J\u00fcttner & Roks, 2022; Sheehe et al., 2018). EDH involves an intricate interplay between endothelial and VSMC K+ channels (Goto & Kitazono, 2019), which can bring these two signaling changes together. TRAM34/Apaminsensitive EDH, the EDH tested in the present study, depends on generation of hyperpolarization in endothelial cells via IKCa2+ and SKCa2+ channels and the subsequent propagation of this hyperpolarization to VSMC, which can involve various VSMC K+ channels, one of which is the BKCa2+ channel (Goto & Kitazono, 2019). Thus, increased EDH contribution to ACh in treated Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice could be the sum of EDH substituting NO in the endothelium, and VSMC being more responsive to EDH via cGMP- induced BKCa2+ channels\nactivation. In treated WT, where the emphasis is on endothelial NO instead of EDH generation, this would not be observed. Our results therefore warrant further interrogation of the involvement of EDH in vasomotor responses after chronic sGC activation in various models of decreased NO production.\nThe effects of sGC activation were not dependent of blood pressure. BP in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice was not significantly increased despite a clear decrease of vasodilation. In previous publications, we observed either significantly increased BP (Durik et al., 2012), or a non- significant trend (K. Golshiri, Ataei Ataabadi, Portilla Fernandez, et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2017). Endothelial dysfunction may occur as a consequence of high blood pressure or be a causative factor itself for high blood pressure. If not fully accompanied by high BP at this stage, this may occur at a later stage, suggesting that high BP develops after endothelial dysfunction has occurred. Alternatively, other mechanisms may have resulted in BP lowering. BP increase may be attenuated by modulation of cardiac function, as previously demonstrated in an endothelial- specific Ercc1 knockout model (BautistaNino et al., 2020)."

In addition, the maximal effect of both BAY compounds reached 100% of the preconstriction. Vascular expression of Cyb5r3, an antioxidant enzyme that counters sGC oxidation, did not differ between Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 and WT. This indicates that native and heme- oxidized sGC are abundantly present in VSMC, and that activation of an antioxidant defense response may not be necessary at this point. This might also be the case for liver tissue despite the reduced Cyb5r3 in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 this tissue. Previous results also showed no difference in sGC expression in aortic tissue between WT and Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice (Durik et al., 2012).\nPreviously, we showed in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice and in mice with deletion of Ercc1 in smooth muscle cells (SMC- KO) that oxidative stress limited the responses to NO (Ehsan Ataei Ataabadi et al., 2021; Durik et al., 2012). We now show that heme- oxidation of sGC does not contribute to this limitation. The present study was not conducted and designed to evaluate effects of oxidative stress in a broader context than sGC alone. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the increase of Cyb5r3, Nqo1, and other anti- oxidant pathways after chronic BAY 54\u2013 6544 treatment, which were investigated in relation to survival pathways, contributed to the improved SNP responses."

            "heading": "3.3 | Effects on survival and ageing pathways",
            "text": "Beneficial effect of sGC activators on survival has been observed in cardiovascular disease models such as Dahl salt- sensitive rats\n(Hoffmann, Kretschmer, et al., 2015) and L- NAME- treated renin transgenic rats (Hahn et al., 2021). Furthermore, we have observed shortened life span in vascular- specific Ercc1 knockout mice, in which NO\u2014 cGMP signaling is prominently disturbed (Ehsan Ataei Ataabadi et al., 2021; Bautista- Nino et al., 2020). Therefore, we were interested if sGC activator treatment in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice could have an impact on survival rates. In fact, the sGC activator could completely prevent the mortality of Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice in the observation period. The underlying mechanism of these significant effect is not completely clear. The shortened lifespan of Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice is mainly attributed to liver problems (McWhir et al., 1993; Selfridge et al., 2001). For this reason, liver is often chosen as a read- out tissue to explore survival pathways in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice (Birkisdottir et al., 2021; Vermeij et al., 2016) and was also our motivation for the present study. Of note, beneficial effects of sGC activators on liver dysfunction have been observed before (Flores- Costa et al., 2020; Hirth- Dietrich et al., 2005; Sandner et al., 2017). Nevertheless, our results warrant future functional studies in multiple organs.\nUp to now, DR is the only intervention that has been found effective in improving the survival rate in Ercc1\u2206/\u2212 mice (Vermeij et al., 2016). Shortening of lifespan in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice is resistant to rapamycin and anti- oxidant therapy, which have shown effectiveness in various other animal models, and thus far was attenuated only by DR (Birkisdottir et al., 2021; Vermeij et al., 2016). When comparing effects of DR and sGC activator treatment in Ercc1\u0394/\u2212 mice, we observe similar results on activation of anti- oxidant genes. Also, the data hint toward attenuation of senescence inflammation markers, but not to the intensity level of dietary restriction. The findings are also reminiscent of earlier observations that indicated that cGMP signaling has favorable effects on inflammation and metabolism in adipose tissue of obese mice (Hoffmann, Etzrodt, et al., 2015; Sanyal et al., 2017). Interestingly, the observation that the survival effect of sGC activation coincides with increase of CYB5R3 and NQO1 expression is in striking parallel with the finding that overexpression of both these NADH- dehydrogenases leads to a modest increase in lifespan, better physical performance, and decreased chronic inflammation in ageing mice (Diaz- Ruiz et al., 2018). Also, DR is accompanied by the rescue of age- associated decline of CYB5R3 and NQO1 function (de Cabo et al., 2009; Hyun et al., 2006). Although the significance of the observation remains to be further established, our observation that the increase in the senescence and inflammation markers is attenuated is in further agreement with a pro- survival effect of BAY 54\u2013 6544. The idea that senescence and inflammation are connected in regulation of life- and health- span has been demonstrated in several normal ageing and DNA damageinduced accelerated ageing rodent models and has led to the development of senolytic drugs, which are not yet applied in the clinic (Baar et al., 2017; Baker et al., 2016; Baker et al., 2011; Tchkonia et al., 2013; Yousefzadeh, Henpita, et al., 2021; Yousefzadeh, Flores, et al., 2021; Yousefzadeh et al., 2020). In summary, the sGC activator treatment, in intervention mode that is currently applied in clinical treatment of pulmonary hypertension, appears to display similarities\nto DR, and perhaps of senolytics. Further examination of the value of this observation is warranted."

The findings of this study may be used as the very first evidence that clinically applicable cGMPmodulating drugs may prevent vascular ageing. This may have important implications for repurposing of such medicines, which are currently used only in an advanced state of ageing- related cardiovascular disease.

Fifteen WT animals were randomized into 3 groups of 5 animals and treated either with vehicle, low dose BAY 54\u2013 6544 (80 mg/kg/day) or high dose BAY 54\u2013 6544 (200 mg/kg/day). All chows supplemented with BAY 54\u2013 6544 and placebo chow were obtained from Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany. BP was measured with tail cuff in 5 consecutive days and the 5th day considered as the main measurement. The detailed protocol for tail cuff measurements is explained below. We aimed to choose a dose without or only minor effects on systemic blood pressure. In addition, we measured the daily amount of chow that was consumed to investigate the possible effect of BAY 54\u2013 6544 on food consumption."

Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a controlled environment (20\u2013 22\u00b0C, 12 h light:12 h dark cycle), with access to food and water ad libitum. The\nanimals were weighed and visually inspected every day by animal caretakers to warrant their well- being.

Vessel segments of 1.5\u2013 2 mm length were mounted in small wire myograph organ baths (Danish Myograph Technology, Aarhus, Denmark) containing 6 ml of Krebs\u2013 Henseleit buffer oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The tension was normalized by stretching the vessels in steps until 90% of the estimated diameter at which the effective transmural pressure of 100 mmHg is reached (Bridges et al., 2011). Thereafter, the viability of the vessels was checked by inducing contractions with 30 and 100 mmol/L KCl. After reaching the maximum contraction induced by KCl, vessels were washed 4 times with a 5- minute interval. To evaluate vasodilatory responses, aortic segments were preconstricted with 30 nmol/L of U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analog) resulting in a preconstriction corresponding with 50\u2013 100% of the response to 100 mmol/L KCl.\nAfter reaching a contraction plateau in response to U46619, CRCs were constructed with the endothelium- dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) at cumulative doses (10\u22129\u2013 10\u22125 mol/L). To evaluate the involvement of the NO- cGMP pathway, one segment was preincubated with NG- nitro- L- arginine methyl ester salt (L- NAME, 10\u22124 mol/L), an endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. To investigate the role of EDH, the small conductance Ca2+activated K+ channel inhibitor (SKCa2+) apamin (100 nmol/L) and the intermediate conductance Ca2+- activated K+ channel (IKCa2+) inhibitor TRAM34 (10 \u03bcmol/L) were added on top of L- NAME.\nIn parallel rings, after reaching a contraction plateau in response to U46619, endothelium- independent CRCs to the NO- donor SNP (10\u221211\u2013 10\u22124 mol/L) were constructed.
