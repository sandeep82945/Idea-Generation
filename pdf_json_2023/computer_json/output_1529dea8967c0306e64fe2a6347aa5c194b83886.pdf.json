In this paper, we improve our previous design by considering the power-bandwidth tradeoff, and we show that we can save a large percentage of system bandwidth by sacrificing a small amount of power, when the demodulator and coding parameters are optimized. For example, we can save 50% of system bandwidth at the cost of 1 dB loss in performance compared to our previous system design. We further extend the results to include Gaussian filtering, we quantify the performance loss as a function of both the system bandwidth saved and the time-bandwidth product of the Gaussian filter, and we compare the performance of the M -ary GFSK system with the corresponding MFSK system.

INTRODUCTION Recent low-data-rate wireless communication applications, such as Bluetooth, wireless personal area networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless medical implants require low power consumption and low cost. Other examples of the need for low power systems vary from reducing the size and weight of batteries used by foot soldiers who carry tens of pounds of equipment in their backpacks, to various low-power internet-of-things (IoT) applications that have a wide spread of applications from wearable fitness trackers to transportation, healthcare, consumer electronics and many others [1], [2], [3]. M -ary frequency shift keying (MFSK) modulation is used in low power communication systems for its power efficiency [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. A novel noncoherent 4FSK high data rate and low power transceiver was introduced in [9].\nIn Gaussian FSK (GFSK) modulation, a Gaussian filter is used to reshape the transmitted signal, smooth the\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Di Zhang .\ntransition between symbols. GFSK has the advantage of reducing sideband power and reducing interference with neighboring channels, at the cost of increasing intersymbol interference. GFSK is frequently used in applications such as Bluetooth receivers [10], [11], [12], [13]. Attempts have been made to study and implement GFSK receivers for the purpose of reducing power consumption and improving system performance. A mixed-signal GFSK demodulator was proposed in [13], with a power consumption of 6 mW, which can tolerate up to 200 kHz frequency offset at a 2 MHz intermediate frequency. A GFSK receiver with an ultra-low power consumption based on injection-locking was presented in [12], achieving a power consumption of 1.8 mW, and a Bluetooth GFSK data rate of 1Mb/s. GFSK demodulators with large frequency offset tolerance between the transmitter and receiver were proposed in [11]. An optimized differential GFSK demodulator that outperforms conventional differential demodulators was developed in [10]. The use of GFSK with frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS-GFSK) to detect drone communication signals in a non-cooperative scenario was proposed in [14]. The theoretical performance\n3942 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ VOLUME 11, 2023\nof a FHSS-GFSK system considering the effect of a postdetection filter was calculated in [15].\nIn [5], we addressed the design and performance analysis of an ultra-low power communications system that uses MFSK signaling with matched filters replaced by 2-pole BPFs, where our baseline design was M = 16 to take advantage of the power efficiency of MFSK for large M . An application of that system was shown in [6], where the maximum total power consumption, including both transmission power and circuit power, was limited to 1mW, the data rate had to be at least 100kb/sec, the distance between the transmitter and receiver had to be at least 1 km, and the uncoded bit error rate (BER) could not exceed 0.001, over an AWGN channel. We further extended the results to include fast frequency hopping and multiple types of intentional jamming, such as partial-band jamming (PBJ) and multi-tone jamming (MTJ) while keeping the assumption of ultra-low power consumption in [7] and [8]. While we used orthogonal signaling in [5], [6], [7], and [8] for optimal performance, in this paper, we study the power-bandwidth tradeoff for the system proposed in [5], and we further employ Gaussian filtering to smooth the transition between symbols and reduce out-of-band spectrum. We show that we can save a large fraction of bandwidth at the cost of a small performance degradation, when the key parameters of the demodulator and coder are optimized for the proposed M -ary GFSK systems. The applications of this type of power-bandwidth tradeoff are the same as those discussed in [5], [6], [7], and [8], which include radios carried by foot soldiers, lightweight UAVs and small IoT devices.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we analyze the performance of a GFSK system with 2-pole BPF non-coherent detection, and optimize the parameters of the receiver in an AWGN channel. In Section III, we repeat the same process as in Section II for a slow, flat, Rician/Rayleigh fading channel. In Section IV, we apply Reed-Solomon coding to the cases analyzed in the previous sections and optimize the coded systems. We compare the results of the optimal coded system with an uncoded system by computing the coding gain (difference in Eb/\u03b70 measured at the BER of 10\u22123), for AWGN, Rician and Rayleigh fading channels. In Section V, we present numerical results, including the optimal parameters and corresponding performance for the cases analyzed in the previous sections. We provide quantitative results on the power-bandwidth tradeoff of the M -ary GFSK system, and compare them to our previous results in [5].\nII. DEMODULATOR PERFORMANCE IN AN AWGN CHANNEL In this section, we analyze the performance of a GFSK non-coherent demodulator with 2-pole BPF detection in an AWGN channel. The demodulator consists of a parallel bank ofM branches, eachwith a BPFwhose center frequency is the frequency of the corresponding tone, followed by an envelope detector and a sampler, and we choose the largest among\nthe M test statistics from the samplers to make a decision, as shown in Fig. 1. The received waveform is given by\nr(t) = s(t) + nw(t). (1)\nIn (1), nw(t) is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)with single sided power spectral density \u03b70, and s(t) is a pulse train of rectangular pulses of duration T , filtered by Gaussian filters. The lowpass equivalent signal of one pulse in s(t) is given by\nslp(t) = P T 2 (t \u2212 T 2 ) \u2217 glp(t), (2)\nwhere Pa(x) is a rectangular pulse defined as\nPa(x) \u225c { 1, |x| \u2a7d a, 0, elsewhere,\n(3)\nand the transfer function and impulse response of the lowpass equivalent Gaussian filter are,\nGlp(f ) = e\u22122\u03c0 2\u03b42f 2 ,\nglp(t) = e\u2212\nt2 2\u03b42\n\u221a 2\u03c0 \u00b7 \u03b4\n, (4)\nrespectively. The detection filters H (\u03c9) are 2-pole BPFs, and the transfer function and impulse response of the ith filter are,\nHi(s) = 2\u03c0Ws\ns2 + 2\u03c0Ws+ (2\u03c0 fi)2 i = 1, 2, . . . ,M ,\nhi(t) = 2\u03c0We\u2212\u03c0Wt cos(2\u03c0 fit)u(t) i = 1, 2, . . . ,M . (5)\nrespectively. The impulse response of the lowpass equivalent filter of the 2-pole BPF is given by\nhlp(t) = \u03c0We\u2212\u03c0Wtu(t), (6)\nwhere W is the filter bandwidth and 1f = f2 \u2212 f1 is the tone spacing, or the difference between center frequencies of adjacent detection filters, and u(\u00b7) is the unit step function. In (5), we assumed that the center frequency of the filter was much greater than the filter bandwidth for any filter when we derived the impulse response from the transfer function.\nWe define  zg = \u221a ln 2 2\u03c0\u03b4 T , z = WT , h = 1fT , r = Ts/T ,\n(7)\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3943\nwhere zg is the time-bandwidth product of the lowpass equivalent Gaussian filter, z is the time-bandwidth product of the lowpass equivalent filter of the 2-pole BPF, h is the modulation index, Ts is the sampling time and r is the normalized sampling time. Note that all the parameters in (7) are dimensionless, meaning our results are independent of the symbol duration (or data rate). For each pair of (zg, h), we optimize z, r to minimize the Eb/\u03b70 required at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\u22123.\nThe total system bandwidth of an M -ary FSK system is given by\nB = (M \u2212 1) \u00d7 1f + Bsig, (8)\nwhere Bsig is the bandwidth of one FSK signal. While there are multiple ways of defining bandwidth of a signal, such as the null-to-null bandwidth (bandwidth of the main spectral lobe, possibly the most popular definition for digital communications, but lacks complete generality since some modulation formats lack well-defined lobes) and equivalent noise bandwidth (ENBW, the bandwidth of a brickwall filter which produces the same integrated power as the signal power and is critical for predicting of receiver sensitivity), all with their own advantages and disadvantages, Bsig is roughly on the same order as the tone spacing 1f . Therefore, for a large M (e.g., for our baseline design of M = 16), B \u2248 M1f . Since h = 1fT = 1 was shown in [5], [6], [7], and [8] to yield optimal performance, the bandwidth saved by the system proposed in this paper can be represented as 1 \u2212 h. It is easy to see that our system experiences both intercarrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to Gaussian filtering, non-orthogonal tone spacing, and 2-pole BPF detection. Because of the non-causality of the Gaussian filter, to detect the current transmitted symbol, we need to consider ISI from both the previous symbols and the future symbols. Based on the analysis in [5], the adjacent symbols contribute the most ISI, so we consider only one previous symbol and one future symbol as the source of ISI in this paper. If the transmitted symbol has frequency fi, the ICI branch is the branchwith 2-pole BPF centered at frequency fn, the previous symbol has frequency fm1 and the future symbol has frequency fm2 , then the union bound on the symbol error rate (SER) can be shown to be given by\nP\u0304s = 1 M3 1 (2\u03c0 )2 M\u2211 i=1 M\u2211 n=1,n\u0338=i M\u2211 m1=1 M\u2211 m2=1\n\u00d7 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 Psm1m2in d\u03b81d\u03b82, (9)\nwhere \u03b81, \u03b82 \u223c U [0, 2\u03c0 ] and Ps m1m2 in is the conditional SER, conditioned on i, n,m1 andm2, as a function of \u03b81 and \u03b82, and is given by [16]\nPsm1m2in = 1 2\n[ 1 \u2212 Q( \u221a b, \u221a a) + Q( \u221a a, \u221a b) ] , (10)\nwith{ a b } = 1 2\u03c3 2 [ A21+A22 2 \u2212 2|\u03c1| \u221a A21 2 A22 2 cos(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 + \u03c6) 1 \u2212 |\u03c1|2\n\u2213\nA21 2 \u2212 A22 2\u221a\n1 \u2212 |\u03c1|2\n] , (11)\nwhere Q(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Marcum-Q function defined as Q(p, q) = \u222b \u221e\nq xe\u2212\nx2+p2 2 I0(px)dx, (12)\nand I0(\u00b7) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and zeroth order, defined as\nI0(x) = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 ex cos \u03b8d\u03b8.

For the noise parameters in (11), the filtered noise power \u03c3 2, the magnitude of the normalized complex crosscovariance |\u03c1|, and the corresponding phase \u03c6 = \u0338 \u03c1 were found in [5] to be given by\n\u03c3 2 = \u03b70\u03c0z 2T ,\n|\u03c1| = z\u221a\nz2 + [(i\u2212 n)h]2 ,\n\u03c6 = \u0338 \u03c1 = tan\u22121 [ z sin(2\u03c0 (i\u2212n)hr)\u2212(i\u2212 n)h cos(2\u03c0 (i\u2212 n)hr) z cos(2\u03c0 (i\u2212 n)hr)+(i\u2212 n)h sin(2\u03c0(i\u2212n)hr) ] ,\n(19)\nwhere we still use the four-quadrant definition of the tan\u22121(\u00b7) function.\nWe do an exhaustive search to optimize the parameter pair (z, r) of the systemwith 2-pole BPF detection tominimize the Eb/\u03b70 required to achieve a BER of 10\u22123 as a function of zg and h. The optimal parameters zopt , ropt , and the corresponding performance of the optimal 2-pole system, for zg = \u221e, 1, and 0.5, in conjunction with h = 1, 0.95, 0.9, . . . , 0.5, are summarized both in Table 1 and in Fig. 2 in Section V, where the accuracy of z is 0.04 (i.e., the values of zwe search for are all integer multiples of 0.04), and the accuracy of r is 0.02. Note that zg = \u221e is equivalent to removing the Gaussian filter.\nIII. DEMODULATOR PERFORMANCE IN FLAT, SLOW RICIAN FADING CHANNELS In a flat, slow Rician fading channel, the signal amplitude R is Rician distributed:\nfR(r) = r \u03c3 2 e\u2212\nA2+r2\n2\u03c32 I0 ( Ar \u03c3 2 ) , (20)\nwhere I0(\u00b7) was defined in (13). If we let \u03b3 denote the Es \u03b70 without fading, and \u03b3\u0304 denote the average (over the fade) Es \u03b70 under Rician fading, then the probability density function (PDF) of \u03b3 is given by [17]\nf (\u03b3 ) = (1 + K )e\u2212K\n\u03b3\u0304 e\u2212\n(1+K )\u03b3 \u03b3\u0304 I0 (\u221a 4K (1 + K ) \u03b3\n\u03b3\u0304\n) , (21)\nwhere K is the Rician K -factor defined as K \u225c A 2\n2\u03c3 2 .\nAs is well known, the Rician fading channel reduces to an AWGN channel when K \u2192 \u221e and reduces to a Rayleigh fading channel when K = 0. For all cases analyzed in the previous section, let P\u0304b,AWGN denote the union bound on the BER in an AWGN channel. Then the union bound on the average BER in a Rician fading channel can be found by integrating the product of P\u0304b,AWGN and (21) from 0 to \u221e.\nNote that while the union bound is a tight bound in an AWGN channel, it is not necessarily a tight bound in a Rician fading channel, and as a result, the performance analyzed by the union bound can be somewhat pessimistic in a Rician fading channel, especially in a Rayleigh fading channel, as we will see in Section V.\nSimilar to the AWGN case, we do an exhaustive search to optimize the parameter pair (z, r) of the two-pole system to minimize Eb/\u03b70 required to reach the BER of 10\u22123, as a function of zg and h. We use the examples of a typical Rician fading channel (K = 10) and a Rayleigh fading channel (K = 0) to present the numerical results. The optimal parameters zopt , ropt and the corresponding performance of the optimal 2-pole system, for zg = \u221e, 1, 0.5, h = 1, 0.95, 0.9, . . . , 0.5, and K = 10, 0, are summarized in Table 1 and Figs. 3 and 4, where the accuracy is 0.04 for z, and 0.02 for r .\nIV. DEMODULATOR PERFORMANCE WITH RS CODING The choice of RS codes with hard decision decoding here is particularly appropriate because of the lower complexity compared to soft decision and/or iterative decoding, and the straightforward manner in which the RS encoded codewords can be mapped to the MFSK/GFSK signal set. We optimize the code dimension k in conjunction with the time-bandwidth parameter z and the normalized sampling time r for the 2-pole system with (n, k) RS codes. We fixed the code length and exhaustively searched all possible values of code dimension, k , to find the k that minimizes the Eb/\u03b70 required to reach the BER of 10\u22123. Application of this transmission scheme to a fading channel generally requires that coded data be interleaved after encoding in order to randomize symbol errors due to burst errors caused by deep fades, thus improving decoder performance [18]. Here we assume that perfect interleavers (i.e., infinitely long) are used. The relationship between uncoded and coded error rate can be found in [8] and [19].\nFor the code length of n = 15 and the alphabet size of M = 16 (i.e., one RS symbol corresponds to one FSK symbol), we repeat the same optimization by exhaustive search as in previous sections, while adding one more parameter to optimize: the code dimension k . We optimize the triple (z, r, k) to find the optimal coded performance for a given zg and h, in an AWGN, a Rician (K = 10), or a Rayleigh fading channel, and measure the coding gain at the BER of 10\u22123 for all cases evaluated in the previous sections. The numerical results are presented in Table 2 and Figs. 2 \u2013 5 in Section V.\nIf the target BER is smaller, we can use a stronger code. For example, the performance curves using length n = 255 RS code are shown in Figs. 7 \u2013 9 in Section V. We attempted to optimize the triple (zopt , ropt , kopt ) using length n = 255 RS code, but the range of code dimension k was k \u2208 {1, 3, . . . , 253} and the optimization took too long. Thus, we used (zopt , ropt ) of the corresponding cases for n = 15 RS code and only optimized the code dimension k for the larger code.\nV. NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section, we present the numerical results of the previous sections. Our baseline design of M = 16 applies to all the figures in this section. Furthermore, the RicianK -factor is K = 10 and the RS code length is n = 15 or 255 for the coded\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3945\nTABLE 1. Optimal parameters (zopt , ropt ), uncoded.\nTABLE 2. Optimal parameters (zopt , ropt , kopt ), coded.\ncases. The metric to evaluate performance is the Eb/\u03b70 measured at the BER of 10\u22123, and coding gain is also measured at this BER. Table 1 lists the optimal parameter pair (zopt , ropt ) for the uncoded GFSK system with zg \u2208 {\u221e, 1, 0.5} in an AWGN, a Rician or a Rayleigh fading channel. Table 2 lists the optimal parameter triple (zopt , ropt , kopt ) for the coded\nGFSK systemwith zg \u2208 {\u221e, 1, 0.5} in an AWGN, a Rician or a Rayleigh fading channel. Figs. 2 \u2013 4 show the optimal coded (n = 15) and uncoded performance as a function of themodulation index h and the time-bandwidth product of the lowpass equivalent Gaussian filter zg, for h between 0.5 and 1 (i.e., up to 50% saving in bandwidth) and zg \u2208 {0.5, 1, \u221e}, in an\n3946 VOLUME 11, 2023\nAWGN, a Rician or a Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. Fig. 5 summarizes the coding gain for different parameters (zg, h) and channel conditions, and Fig. 6 summarizes the power-bandwidth tradeoff of the GFSK system in terms of system bandwidth saved vs. loss in Eb/\u03b70. Figs. 7 \u2013 9 show three examples of optimal coded (n = 15 and 255) and\nuncoded performance curves in terms ofPb vs.Eb/\u03b70. We use monte-carlo simulation to support the analysis in this paper, where the number of errors collected is 1000 for each data point.\nSome observations from the figures and tables are as follows:\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3947\nBy the nature of the union bound, it is an upper bound that is not always tight, and for our case, in a fading channel, it provides a pessimistic estimate. We need to resort\nto accurate simulation (collect enough errors) for a good approximation of performance. Furthermore, as can be seen\n3948 VOLUME 11, 2023\nin Figs. 7 \u2013 9, the gap between the actual performance and the union bound decreases as K increases: in a Rayleigh fading channel, it can be over 6 dB, in a Rician fading channel, it is roughly 1 dB and in an AWGN channel, since the union bound is tight, the gap is negligible. If we use the union bound to compare the performance in AWGN vs. fading channel conditions, we will get inaccurate results.\nFor any zg and any channel condition, the performance degrades with decreasing h, but the performance degrades faster when K is larger and when zg is smaller.\nFor any h and any channel condition, a smaller zg can make the transition between FSK symbols smoother and thus decrease out-of-band spectrum, at the cost of more performance degradation.\nFor any zg and any channel condition, the performance degrades faster with decreasing h for an uncoded system, compared to a coded system, meaning the power-bandwidth tradeoff leans towards bandwidth for a coded system. For example, for z = 0.5 in a Rician fading channel the performance degradation between h = 0.5 and h = 1 (i.e., the\nVOLUME 11, 2023 3949\namount of performance loss to save 50% of bandwidth) is 2.4 dB for a coded system, and 6.8 dB for an uncoded system. If a more powerful code is used (e.g., n = 255 RS code) and optimized, we could save more bandwidth for the same amount of performance degradation, as shown in Figs. 7 \u2013 9. For any h and any channel condition, the coding gain increases with decreasing h. Furthermore, the coding gain is smaller when K is larger, but also increases faster with decreasing h. This is intuitive since coding is more effective for worse uncoded performance.\nThe performance degradation increases faster when h is smaller, i.e., when the bandwidth is already small, we need to sacrifice more power in order to further save bandwidth,\ne.g., for the case of coded 2-pole GFSK systemwith zg = 1 in an AWGN channel, we sacrifice 0.8 dB in performance for 30% saving in bandwidth, but we need to sacrifice another 2.5 dB (i.e., 3.3 dB in total) in performance for another 20% (i.e., 50% in total) saving in bandwidth.\nAs can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, the optimal z increases with decreasing h, regardless of whether the system is coded or not, and regardless of the whether the channel is fading or not. This is because decreasing h results in more severe ICI and ISI, and we have to use larger z to reduce ISI, at the cost of increasing the noise power going into the system.\nIt can be seen from the tables that for all caseswe evaluated, the optimal r is 1 without Gaussian filtering (i.e., zg = \u221e),\n3950 VOLUME 11, 2023\nwhich is consistent with what we found in [5], and for most cases we evaluated, the optimal r is in the vicinity of 0.9 with Gaussian filtering. This is due to the pulse shaping effect of the Gaussian filter, making the filtered signal waveform peak roughly at 90% of the symbol duration.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 6 that for all cases we analyzed, i.e., any zg \u2208 {\u221e, 1, 0.5} and any channel condition, we can achieve at least a 30% saving in total system bandwidth at the cost of no more than 0.9 dB loss in Eb/\u03b70 when all the parameters of the coded 2-pole system are optimized.\nAs is shown in Fig. 6, the performance loss of a GFSK system compared to the corresponding MFSK system is a function of zg and h. Specifically, it is a decreasing function of both zg, i.e., the smaller the bandwidth of the Gaussian filter is, the more penalty in performance. The performance loss also increases when we decrease the tone spacing, i.e., when we want to save more system bandwidth.\nVI. CONCLUSION In previouswork [5], [6], the authors addressed the design and performance analysis of an ultra-low power 16-FSK system, where they showed the performance degradation between the proposed system and the optimal system was no greater than 1.2 dB, in an AWGN or a Rician/Rayleigh fading channel. In this paper, we further showed that we could potentially save a large fraction of total system bandwidth at the cost of a small extra performance loss by decreasing the tone spacing and optimizing key parameters including filter bandwidth, sampling time and code dimension. For a fixed loss in performance, the saving in system bandwidth is greater when the channel condition is worse, i.e., when the Rician K -factor is smaller. For example, in an AWGN channel, we could save 30% of system bandwidth at the cost of 0.56 dB in performance, or we could save 50% of bandwidth at the\nFIGURE 10. Signal filtering.\ncost of 2.4 dB in performance, where the metric to compare performance is Eb/\u03b70 measured at a BER of 10\u22123 for the optimal coded system; in a Rayleigh fading channel, we could save 30% of system bandwidth at the cost of 0.25 dB in performance, or we could save 50% of system bandwidth at the cost of 1 dB in performance.\nFurthermore, we extended the results to a GFSK system where a Gaussian filter is used to smooth the transition between pulses and decrease out-of-band spectrum.We quantified the performance degradation of the GFSK system compared to the corresponding MFSK system, as a function of the time-bandwidth product (zg) of the Gaussian filter and the fraction of bandwidth saved. For example, if we want to save 25% of system bandwidth and we use a Gaussian filter with time-bandwidth product zg = 1, the optimal coded GFSK system is worse than the optimal coded MFSK system by 1.4 dB.\nNote that for the same system bandwidth, GFSK always loses to MFSK in terms of power by a small amount. However, this is compensated by the advantage of reducing sideband power and reducing interference with neighboring channels, though the advantage is not shown explicitly in this paper.\nAPPENDIX We start by filtering an isolated rectangular pulse cosine wave with frequency fi and phase \u03b8 through a 2-pole BPF centered at frequency fn, and a Gaussian filter centered at frequency fi.

Now that we know the output of signal with frequency fi through branch \u2018\u2018n\u2032\u2032, yin(r), we can find the output of the previous pulse with frequency fm1 through branch \u2018\u2018n\n\u2032\u2032, ym1n(r), in a similar manner, to be\nym1n(r + 1)\n= \u211c{ylp(r + 1)e\u2212j(\u03c9m1 (r+1)T+\u03b80)}\n= \u211c{ylp(r + 1)} cos(\u03c9m1 (r + 1)T + \u03b80)\n+\u2111{ylp(r + 1)} sin(\u03c9m1 (r + 1)T + \u03b80)\n3952 VOLUME 11, 2023\n= mm1n(r + 1) cos(\u03c9irT + 1\u03c9m1irT + \u03c9m1T + \u03b80)\n+\u00b5m1n(r + 1) sin(\u03c9irT + 1\u03c9m1irT + \u03c9m1T + \u03b80)\n\u225c mm1n(r + 1) cos(\u03c9irT + X )\n+\u00b5m1n(r + 1) sin(\u03c9irT + X ), (36)\nwhere\nX \u225c 1\u03c9m1irT + \u03c9m1T + \u03b80, (37)\n\u03b80 is the phase associated with the previous transmitted symbol, and we assume \u03b80 = \u22121\u03c9m1irT \u2212 \u03c9m1T \u21d2 X = 0 without loss of generality. Letting X = 0 in (36) yields\nym1n(r + 1) = mm1n(r + 1) cos(\u03c9irT ). (38)\nSimilarly, for the future pulse that has frequency fm2 and phase \u03b82, the bandpass output is given by\nym2n(r \u2212 1)\n= \u211c{ylp(r \u2212 1)e\u2212j(\u03c9m2 (r\u22121)T+\u03b82)}\n= \u211c{ylp(r \u2212 1)} cos(\u03c9m2 (r \u2212 1)T + \u03b82)\n+\u2111{ylp(r \u2212 1)} sin(\u03c9m2 (r \u2212 1)T + \u03b82)\n= mm2n(r \u2212 1) cos(\u03c9irT + 1\u03c9m2irT \u2212 \u03c9m2T + \u03b82)\n+\u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) sin(\u03c9irT + 1\u03c9m2irT \u2212 \u03c9m2T + \u03b82)\n\u225c mm2n(r \u2212 1) cos(\u03c9irT + Y )\n+\u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) sin(\u03c9irT + Y ), (39)\nwhere\nY \u225c 1\u03c9m2irT \u2212 \u03c9m2T + \u03b82. (40)\nNote that since \u03b82 \u223c U [0, 2\u03c0 ], for any fixed sampling time r , the trigonometries of Y = 1\u03c9m2irT \u2212 \u03c9m2T + \u03b82 are essentially the same as those of \u03b82, and thus we can replace Y with \u03b82 in (39) when calculating the average error rate, where we need to integrate out \u03b82. Letting Y = \u03b82 yields\nym2n(r \u2212 1) = mm2n(r \u2212 1) cos(\u03c9irT + \u03b82)\n+\u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) sin(\u03c9irT + \u03b82). (41)\nFinally, the bandpass output signal of the three consecutive pulses at frequencies fi (current symbol), fm1 (previous symbol), and fm2 (future symbol) coming through the 2-pole BPF whose center frequency is fn, is the superposition of the three bandpass output signals yin(r), ym1n(r + 1) and ym2n(r \u2212 1), and is given by\nym1m2in (r)\n= yin(r) + ym1n(r + 1) + ym2n(r \u2212 1) = [min(r) cos \u03b81 + \u00b5in(r) sin \u03b81 + mm1n(r + 1)\n+mm2n(r \u2212 1) cos \u03b82 + \u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) sin \u03b82] cos\u03c9irT +[\u2212min(r) sin \u03b81 + \u00b5in(r) cos \u03b81 + \u00b5m1n(r + 1) \u2212mm2n(r \u2212 1) sin \u03b82 + \u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) cos \u03b82] sin\u03c9irT\n\u225c Im1m2in (r) cos\u03c9irT + Q m1m2 in (r) sin\u03c9irT = [Im1m2in (r) cos(2\u03c0(i\u2212 n)hr)\n+Qm1m2in (r) sin(2\u03c0(i\u2212 n)hr)] cos(\u03c9nrT ) +\n[\u2212Im1m2in (r) sin(2\u03c0(i\u2212 n)hr) +Qm1m2in (r) cos(2\u03c0(i\u2212 n)hr)] sin(\u03c9nrT ), (42)\nwhere the in-phase and quadrature components are defined as\nIm1m2in (r) = mm1n(r + 1) + min(r) cos \u03b81 + \u00b5in(r) sin \u03b81 +mm2n(r \u2212 1) cos \u03b82 + \u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) sin \u03b82,\nQm1m2in (r) = \u00b5m1n(r + 1) \u2212 min(r) sin \u03b81 + \u00b5in(r) cos \u03b81 \u2212mm2n(r \u2212 1) sin \u03b82 + \u00b5m2n(r \u2212 1) cos \u03b82.\n(43)\nNote that (43) is a function of \u03b81 and \u03b82, both uniformly distributed between 0 and 2\u03c0 . The parameters A1,A2, \u03b81 and \u03b82 in (11) can be represented as\nA1 = (A m1m2 ii ) 2 = A2 ( [Im1m2ii (r)] 2 + [Qm1m2ii (r)] 2 ) ,\n\u03b81 = \u03b8 m1m2 ii = tan\n\u22121 [ Qm1m2ii (r)\nIm1m2ii (r)\n] ,\nA2 = (A m1m2 in ) 2 = A2 ( [Im1m2in (r)] 2 + [Qm1m2in (r)] 2 ) , \u03b82 = \u03b8 m1m2 in\n= tan\u22121 [ \u2212Im1m2in (r) sin(X ) + Q m1m2 in (r) cos(X )\nIm1m2in (r) cos(X ) + Q m1m2 in (r) sin(X )\n] , (44)\nwhere X = 2\u03c0 (i\u2212 n)hr , and again we use the four-quadrant definition of tan\u22121(\u00b7).\nThe output of a rectangular pulse through a Gaussian filter is\ns(t) = slp(t) \u2217 glp(t)\n= P T 2 (t \u2212 T 2 ) \u2217\ne\u2212 t2 2\u03b42 \u221a 2\u03c0\u03b4\n= 8\n( 2\u03c0zg(1 \u2212 t/T )\n\u221a ln 2\n) \u2212 8 ( \u2212 2\u03c0zgt/T \u221a ln 2 ) ,\n\u21d2 s(r) = 8 ( 1 \u2212 r\n\u03bb\n) \u2212 8 ( \u2212 r \u03bb ) , (45)\nwhere \u03bb = \u221a ln 2\n2\u03c0zg was defined in (30), and 8(\u00b7) is the CDF\nof the standard normal distribution.
