    "abstractText": "A series of cyclometalated complexes of ruthenium (II) with four different substituents in the aryl fragment of benzimidazole was synthesized in order to study the effect of substituent donation on the electronic structure of the substances. The resulting complexes were studied using X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, MALDI mass spectrometry, electron absorption spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry as well as DFT/TDDFT was also used to interpret the results. All the complexes have intense absorption in the range of up to 700 nm, the triplet nature of the excited state was confirmed by measurement of luminescence decay. With an increase in substituent donation, a red shift of the absorption and emission bands occurs, and the lifetime of the excited state and the redox potential of the complex decrease. The combination of these properties shows that the complexes are excellent dyes and can be used as photosensitizers.",

Classic complexes for this purpose are isothiocyanate complexes with monodentate NCS ligands [7]. However, such architecture has poor stability, due to which they are inappropriate for use in solutions. As an alternative\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28186541 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541 2 of 19\nbidentate and tridentate N-donor ligands based on pyridine and pyrazole rings are used instead of isothiocyanate ligands [8,9]. Another way to increase the stability of complexes is cyclometalation, i.e., the formation between the metal and carbon atoms from the ligand. Here and below, cyclometalated ligands will be referred to as C\u02c6N ligands, since they are coordinated to the ruthenium atom by carbon and nitrogen, and N-donor bidentate ligands as N\u02c6N ligands. It is important to note that when a cyclometalated fragment is introduced into the complex, photophysical and electrochemical properties of the latter dramatically change [8]. Therefore, the analysis of factors affecting the properties of complexes is an urgent task. One approach to the search for new dyes is to vary the donor-acceptor nature of substituents in C\u02c6N ligands. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on the d-orbitals of ruthenium and the orbitals of the C\u02c6N ligand [8,10,11]. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized mainly on the N\u02c6N ligand. Therefore, the change in the electronic structure of the ligand is directly related to the HOMO-LUMO gap, and, as a result, to the position of the absorption edge, the emission maximum, and the redox potential. The most studied cyclometalated complexes are the ones bearing phenylpyridines, phenylazoles, or terpyridines [7,12\u201325]. Nevertheless, phenylpyridines are complex objects for synthesis, and there are no papers where strong electron-donor substituents have been introduced into them, although the effect of electron-withdrawing substituents has been extensively studied [14\u201316]. As an alternative class of ligands, benzimidazoles can be used. These compounds are convenient objects for precise changes in the electronic structure since they are readily available synthetically, and it is possible to introduce a wide range of substituents at different positions of the aryl and benzimidazole fragments. Several ruthenium compounds with similar ligands with an imidazole moiety have been described in the literature. The first type (Figure 1a) is N\u02c6C\u02c6N ligands containing two benzimidazole fragments, such as 2,6-bis(benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene [26\u201337]. The second type is C\u02c6N ligands (Figure 1b), where the Ru-C bond is formed with the imidazole fragment and one of the imidazole nitrogen is bonded to a pyridine [27,38]. The third type is the N\u02c6N ligands of the 2-benzimidazol-2-yl-pyridines class (Figure 1c) [27,39\u201347]. The C\u02c6N ligands based on 2-arylimidazoles that interest us are presented in Figure 1d [48\u201350].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541 2 of 20\nconversion molecular devices.

Another way to increase the stability of complexes is cyclometalation, i.e., the formation between the metal and carbon atoms from the ligand. Here and below, cyclometalated ligands will be referred to as C^N ligands, since they are coordinated to the ruthenium atom by carbon and nitrogen, and N-donor bidentate ligands as N^N ligands. It is important to note that when a cyclometalated fragment is introduced into the complex, photophysical and electrochemical properties of the latter dramatically change [8]. Therefore, the analysis of factors affecting the properties of complexes is an urgent task. One approach to the search for new dyes is to vary the donor-acceptor nature of substituents in C^N ligands. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on the d-orbitals of ruthenium and the orbitals of the \u0421^N ligand [8,10,11]. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized mainly on the N^N ligand.

The second type is ^N ligands (Figure 1b), where the Ru-C bond is for ed ith the i i azole frag ent and one of the i idazole nitrogen is bonded to a pyridine [27,38]. he t ird type is the ^N ligands of the 2-benzimidazol-2-yl-pyridines class (Figure 1c) [27,39\u201347]. The\n^N ligands based on 2-arylimidazoles that interest us are presented in Figure 1d [48\u201350].\nFigure 1. Types of coordination of substituted imidazoles to the ruthenium atom described in the literature: (a) N^C^N pincer bisimidazoles; (b) C^N pyridyl-substituted imidazoles; (c) N^N pyridyl-substituted imidazoles; (d) C^N phenyl-substituted imidazoles.\nLigands of the first type (Figure 1a) are interesting for the design of ruthenium binuclear complexes, and electron transfer from one metal center to another is mainly investigated for them [26,32,33,37]. The modification of such ligands is mainly done by carboxyl or ester groups or phenyl groups [26,32]. Such complexes can be used for photodynamic therapy [31], photooxidation of water [34], and electropolymerization [35].\nFigure 1. y es of coordination of substituted imidazoles to the ruthenium atom described in the literature: (a) N\u02c6C\u02c6N pincer bisimidazoles; (b) C\u02c6N pyridyl-substituted imidazoles; (c) N\u02c6N pyridyl-substituted imidazoles; (d) C\u02c6N phenyl-substituted imidazoles.\nLigands of the first type (Figure 1a) are interesting for the design of ruthenium binuclear complexes, and electron transfer from one etal center to another is mainly investigated for them [26,32,33,37].

Such complexes can be us d for photodynamic therapy [31], photooxidation of water [34], and elect opolymerization [35]. Complexes with ligands of the second type (Figure 1b) have also been studied as sensitizers for DSSC [38]. For example, the authors of [38] studied the effect of the size of the conjugated system of C\u02c6N-ligand on the photosensitizer efficiency.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541 3 of 19\nLigands of the third type (Figure 1c) are N\u02c6N-donors, i.e., complexes with them are not cyclometalated. Complexes for cancer immunotherapy have been obtained with such pyridine-containing ligands [47], and sensitizers for DSSCs have been investigated [42\u201346]. Finally, there are several studies where complexes with ligands of the fourth type (Figure 1d) have been investigated [48\u201350]. For example, in [49], ruthenium complexes with 2-arylbenzimidazoles modified with a carboxyl group were investigated as anticancer drugs. In [50], cyclometalated ruthenium complexes with unsubstituted 2-phenylimidazole and various N\u02c6N-donor ligands were proposed as photosensitizers. The closest to the topic of this work is the study of cyclometalated ruthenium complexes with 1-benzyl-2aryl-benzimidazoles, which showed good performance in DSSC, where -CF3 groups and N-hexylphenothiazine [48], i.e., only acceptor substituents, were introduced into the aryl moiety. The introduction of the strong acceptor N-hexylphenothiazine shifts the absorption bands to the red region, but the cell sensitized by it shows lower efficiency relative to the sensitizer with -CF3 groups. Cyclometalated iron complexes have also been studied with similar ligands as sensitizers for DSSCs [51]. In addition to the ligands used in [48], the authors introduced a donor-NMe2 group into the aryl fragment, which led to the desired destabilization of the MC-state. In addition to ruthenium(II) complexes, benzimidazoles have been used as C\u02c6N ligands in iridium(III) complexes [52]. It is shown that the expansion of the conjugated ligand system and its geometry have a significant effect not only on the electronic structure of the complex, but also on its structure and composition [53\u201355]. Previously, we studied cyclometalated complexes of ruthenium(II) [56] and iridium(III) [57] with 1-phenyl-2-aryl-benzimidazoles and showed that the benzimidazole and aryl parts of the ligand strongly differ from each other in donor\u2013acceptor properties, which leads to the prevalence of ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) in molecules. As a way to solve this problem, we propose to introduce an electron-donor substituent (e.g., methyl) into the benzimidazole fragment. Methyl radical was chosen because it is the simplest sigma electron-donating group. Then, 4,4\u2032-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2\u2032-bipyridine (dmdcbp) was chosen as the N\u02c6N ligand. Usually, 4,4\u2032-dicarboxy-2,2\u2032-bipyridine (dcbp) is used as an anchoring ligand. We use it not as an acid but as an ester, as this increases the solubility of the complexes and facilitates their study. In our previous work [56], it was shown that the hydrolysis is easily carried out in one step and that the optical properties of the complex with dcbp and dmdcbp do not differ practically. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a series of cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes with 2-aryl-5-methylbenzimidazoles bearing electron-withdrawing (NO2) and electron-donating substituents (OMe, NMe2) and anchoring 4,4\u2032-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2\u2032bipyridine. We studied the composition and structure of complexes with NMR spectroscopy, MALDI mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. Photophysical properties were studied with UV-vis and luminescence spectroscopy, redox potentials were measured by use of cyclic voltammetry (CV). These results were interpreted together with their electronic structure, obtained by a combined DFT/TD-DFT approach. The results were compared to our previous work [56]."

The ligands were obtained with a high yield by condensation of N-benzyl-4-methyl-ophenylenediamine and bisulfite adducts of corresponding aldehydes with various substituents using standard procedure [58]. The desired diamine was produced by the reduction of 4-methyl-2-nitro-N-benzylaniline with hydrazine using Raney nickel [59]. The precursor for reduction was obtained by benzylation of 4-methyl-2-nitroaniline with benzylchloride (BnCl) [60]. This route of synthesis was chosen in order to avoid isomer formation.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541 4 of 19\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6541 4 of 20\nby the reduction of 4-methyl-2-nitro-N-benzylaniline with hydrazine using Raney nickel [59].

Synthesis of \u0421^N ligands.\nComplexes 1\u20134 were prepared via a standard [56] 2-stage method (Scheme 2). In the first stage, cyclometalation was carried out. The product is unstable in solution; therefore, it was used in the second stage without characterization, and the composition of the complex was assigned in accordance with the literature [25]. The solid contained some amount of p-cymene, which was not evaporated under reduced pressure. That is why the shortage of dmdcbp was taken on the 2nd stage\u2014it is hard to separate the final product from the unreacted dmdcbp. It is interesting to note that an increase in the acceptor properties of a substituent leads to a decrease in the yield of cyclometalation. In the second stage, the dimethyl ester of dicarboxybipyridine (dmdcbp) was introduced into the complex. We decided to use ester instead of acid in order to simplify the isolation and purification of complexes. The resulting compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, HRMS, complexes 1 and 3 were studied by X-ray crystallography.\nScheme 2. Synthesis of the complexes 1\u20134.\n2.1.1. NMR Spectroscopy The composition and purity of the complexes were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The spectrum of the free C^N ligand is very different from that of the cyclometalated one. First, one of the protons of the aryl fragment disappears as a result of the formation of a ruthenium\u2013carbon covalent bond. This also causes the signals of neighboring protons to change. Second, the formation of a covalent bond with a metal leads to a redistribution of the electron density in the ligand and, as a consequence, to a strong change in the chemical shift of the ligand proton signals. The proton signals of the free N^N ligand also differ greatly from the coordinated one (Figure 2). It is interesting to note that bipyridine rings become non-equivalent when coordinated with a metal. This is clearly seen in signals in the region of 8.9\u20139.1 ppm. Protons from four different bipyridyl rings have different chemical shifts due to different Ru-N bond lengths. One of the signals is shifted more than the others because its proton is located in the pyridyl ring, the nitrogen of which is farthest from the ruthenium (Table 1).\nScheme 1.

This can be explained by the fact that the HOMO of the complex is localized on the benzimidazole ligand; therefore, the introduction of donor substituents increases the HOMO energy, while the introduction of acceptor substituents lowers it. All the complexes exhibit luminescence in the near-IR region (800\u2013950 nm). The spectra measured at 298 K for compounds 3 and 4 with donor substituents have lowintensity bands at a higher energy region of 600\u2013800 nm. However, these bands are negligible in comparison with the emission bands located at 800\u2013950 nm in the spectra recorded at 77 K.

At room temperature, the emission maxima of complexes 1\u20133 peaked at a wavelength of about 900 nm and slightly blue-shifted in the spectra recorded at 77 K (see Figure 7). Substituents in ligands affect the energy of the emitted excited state with a consequence red shift of the emission band by 81 nm (0.14 eV) (Table 2) from complex 1 to complex 4. In conclusion, the emission intensity of the long-wavelength band greatly increases upon cooling in comparison with the intensity of the band at 600\u2013800 nm (Figure S3), which indicates the triplet nature of the excited state. To prove the proposed hypothesis, the luminescence decays at room temperature and 77 K with registration at emission maxima were measured.

In contrast, the HOMO is presumed to be located on Ru for complexes 1 (67%) and 2 (60%), while for complexes 3 and 4, the HOMO is located on C\u02c6N (61% and 80%, respectively). We observed a trend of decreasing Ru(II) ion contribution in the HOMO along with an increase in C\u02c6N ligand contribution from compound 1 to 4 (see Figure 8). The redistribution of molecular orbital localization from the Ru(II) ion to the C\u02c6N ligand, specifically on the motif with the R group, leads to an increase in HOMO energy from \u22128.0 to \u22127.4 eV. To gain a deeper insight into electronic excitation processes, TD-DFT calculations were performed at the same level of theory. The calculated S0\u2192S1 energies agree well with the experimentally estimated values, with an energy deviation not exceeding 0.03 eV (in the case of complex 2). According to the calculations, the S0\u2192S1 electronic transition for complexes 1 and 2 has the nature of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state, involving a transition from Ru to N\u02c6N with an additional contribution from a transition from C\u02c6N to N\u02c6N ligand. Thus, we assume an MLCT (Ru\u2192N\u02c6N) + ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) (C\u02c6N\u2192N\u02c6N) nature for this absorption band. However, compounds 3 and 4, which contain electron-donating substituents, demonstrate an LLCT (C\u02c6N\u2192N\u02c6N) nature for the S0\u2192S1 transition. The initial orbital is located on the NMe2-containing unit of the C\u02c6N ligand. The first intense absorption band, located in the region of 500\u2013600 nm (see Figure 6), has the nature of an MLCT from the d orbital of Ru to the \u03c0* orbital of N\u02c6N (Ru\u2192N\u02c6N), as determined by calculations. The calculated absorption energies of 577\u2013606 nm do not exceed 0.1 eV compared to those obtained from the deconvolution of experimental spectra. The UV-Vis spectra simulated based on the TD results are quite similar to the measured spectra. The estimated energies of the first excited triplet state T1 are close to the experimental values (Table 3), slightly lower by only 0.05\u20130.11 eV. Since the S0\u2192T1 transition is predominantly from HOMO to LUMO, the T1 state is an MLCT (Ru\u2192N\u02c6N) state.

S eep rate 100 V\u00b7s 1.\nWe also estimated the energies of HOMO and LUMO using the oxidation and re-\nduction potentials (Table 4). To do this, we added to the obtained potentials the absolute potential of the pair Fc/Fc+ = 5.1 eV [62]. The energy gap (Eg) was calculated as the difference between oxidation and reduction potentials. The dependence of the HOMO and LUMO energies determined in this way on the substituent in the ligand is the same as in the case of quantum chemical calculations. ELUMO for all complexes is approximately the same, except for complex 1, as in its case, it is lower. This can be explained by the fact that the introduction of a strong acceptor into one ligand leads to a decrease in the electron density on the N\u02c6N ligan as well. That is why the E gap is the same for complexes 1 and 2, although co plex 2 does not contain acceptor substituents.\nTable 4.

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the 5 mM complexes solutions were performed in a standard 3-electrode cell with previously polished 3 mm diameter glassy carbon working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode, and polypyrrole reference electrode. Further, 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, Alfa Aesar, electrochemical grade) in Ar-saturated acetonitrile (CH3CN) (Sigma-Aldrich, containing 20 ppm H2O, established by Fischer titration) was used as an electrolyte. The details of the reference electrode preparation can be found in Ref. [66]. Measurements were performed using BioLogic potentiostat (Seyssinet-Pariset, France) with an analog scan generator at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121 at 25 \u25e6C. MALDI spectra were recorded using a Bruker microTOF II mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). Photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded at room temperature and 77 K with a Horiba-Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-QM spectrofluorimeter (Paris, France) equipped with a 75 W ArcTune xenon lamp and a Hamamatsu R13456 photomultiplier sensitive in the 200\u2013980 nm emission range. For low-temperature measurements, the samples were placed in a quartz optical cryostat filled with liquid N2. Luminescence decays were acquired by the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method using the same instrument, using DeltaLED (HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan) as a pulsed laser excitation source emitted at \u03bb = 390 nm and the pulse duration of 0.6 ns. V2.6 software was used for data analysis. To suppress vibrational quenching of phosphorescence, solutions of the complexes were prepared in an argon atmosphere in acetonitrile purified from dissolved oxygen. Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a LOMO SF-2000 spectrophotometer (Saint Petersburg, Russia) in quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm path length in solutions in acetonitrile. Quantum chemical calculations were conducted with the Gaussian 16 Rev A.03 program. DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed at the M06 levels of theory [67,68]. The def2-SV(P) basis set was employed for all atoms except ruthenium. Large-core energyadjusted quasi-relativistic RECP for Ru, developed by the Stuttgart and Dresden groups, along with the accompanying basis set ECP28MWB [69,70] was used. In the development of the theoretical model, geometrical parameters X-ray single crystal structures were used as a starting point. All calculations were performed in the gas phase. Analysis of vibrational frequencies was performed for all optimized structures. All compounds were characterized by only real vibrational frequencies. The molecular group\u2019s contribution to MOs as well as simulated UV-Vis spectra were calculated using GaussSum 3.0 software [71]."

            "text": "In conclusion, this article presents a complete study of a series of cyclometalated ruthenium 2-arylbenzimidazole complexes. The substituents in the C\u02c6N ligand play an important role in the electronic structure of the complex. It has been shown that an increase in the donation of a substituent in the aryl fragment of benzimidazole leads to a red shift of the emission band and a decrease in the lifetime of the excited state; an assumption was also made about the triplet nature of the excited state. In addition, an increase in donation shifts the absorption band to the red region of the spectrum, but, as we showed using quantum chemical calculations, the contribution of interligand energy transfer also increases. At the same time, the introduction of a strong acceptor affects even the energies of the orbitals localized on the N\u02c6N ligand. The results obtained are important for a deep understanding of the nature of electronic transitions and the targeted development of effective ruthenium dyes for solving various problems.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28186541/s1, Part 1: luminescence\u2014Figures S1\u2013S5; Part 2: DFT\u2014Figure S6, Tables S1 and S2; Part 3: absorbance\u2014Figures S7 and S8, Table S3; Part 4: cyclic voltammetry\u2014Figure S9; Part 5: NMR spectroscopy\u2014Figures S10\u2013S27, Tables S4\u2013S8.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.D.D. and M.A.L.; methodology, M.A.L. and S.A.V.; validation, S.A.M., S.A.V. and M.A.L.; formal analysis, S.A.V., S.A.M., M.A.S. and M.A.L.; investigation, S.A.V., M.A.L. and S.K.B.; resources, V.D.D. and I.V.T.; data curation, V.M.K., S.S.M., M.A.S., Y.A.B., M.A.L. and V.E.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.M.K., V.E.G. and M.A.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.A.B., V.D.D. and I.V.T.; visualization, V.M.K., V.E.G., S.A.M. and M.A.L.; supervision, V.D.D. and I.V.T.; project administration, V.D.D. and I.V.T.; funding acquisition, V.D.D. and I.V.T.
