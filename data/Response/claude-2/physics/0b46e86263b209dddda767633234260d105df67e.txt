 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the biosynthetic pathway of the new compounds isolated in this study. The proposed biosynthesis could be confirmed by feeding experiments with labeled precursors. Additional enzymes involved could also be identified through genome mining of the producing strain.  

2. Conduct further structural modifications of the new compounds through medicinal chemistry approaches to improve their cytotoxicity and drug-likeness. Strategies could include changing functional groups, cyclization, and combining structural motifs.

3. Test the cytotoxicity of the new compounds against additional cancer cell lines, especially drug-resistant lines, to fully evaluate their anticancer potential. Their mechanisms of action could also be studied.

4. Explore the antimicrobial potential of the new compounds against drug-resistant bacterial strains. Many rifamycins have antibiotic effects but this was not evaluated in the current study.

5. Isolate more members of the rifamycin family from marine Salinispora strains collected from diverse environments. This could uncover further chemical diversity and lead to discovery of derivatives with improved bioactivities.
