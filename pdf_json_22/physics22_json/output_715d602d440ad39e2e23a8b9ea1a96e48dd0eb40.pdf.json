    "abstractText": "In contrast with rich investigations about the translation of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) texture, spin precession in an AFM texture is seldom concerned for lacking an effective driving method. In this work, however, we show that under an alternating spin-polarized current with spin along the AFM anisotropy axis, spin precession can be excited in an AFM DW. Especially, chaotic spin precession occurs at moderate interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which contributes to a nonlinear term in the dynamic equation of DW precession. Also, crisis-induced intermittent chaos appears when the current density is higher than a critical value. This work not only paves a way to unravel rich spin precession behaviors in an AFM texture but also provides guidelines for developing ultrafast spintronic devices based on new physical principles. Chaos is deterministic nonlinear dynamics that is sensitive to variation of initial conditions, and it attracts enduring research interests owing to its wide existence in nature and valuable applications, such as weather forecast, secure communication, and neuromorphic computing [1 ~ 3]. Nonlinear terms in dynamic equations are necessary for chaos. In a magnetic medium, spin dynamics is governed by Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which includes inherent nonlinear terms from dipole-dipole interaction and magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, chaotic spin dynamics is usually observed in nanoscale spintronic devices, such as current-induced chaotic precession of spatially uniform magnetization in a spin valve [4 ~ 8]. In addition to uniform magnetization, magnetic textures with inhomogeneous magnetization, such as domain walls (DWs), skyrmions, vortexes, and bimerons, also widely exist in magnetic materials. The spin dynamics of a magnetic texture generally includes translation (displacement of texture center) and precession (spin precession in a texture) [9 ~ 12]. In an antiferromagnetic (AFM) medium, most attention is paid to texture translation instead of precession up until now. A typical example is ultrafast AFM DW translation (velocity > 1000 m/s) with an upper limit of velocity, which is analogous to the relativistic motion of a massive object [13 ~ 17]. Very recently, chaotic translation was also predicted in an AFM texture under an alternating spin current by introducing a nonlinear force originated from the boundary of an AFM medium [18 ~ 22]. In an AFM material, DW precession is absent for uniform DW translation [13, 23, 24]. This ensures stable DW translation at a high velocity without worrying about Walker breakdown for an FM DW [25]. On the other hand, however, strong exchange coupling in an AFM DW offers potential for ultrafast spin precession in the DW, and this DW precession can exhibit special spin dynamics behaviors owing to the unique inertia of an AFM DW [25]. Nevertheless, how to excite AFM DW precession is still an open question. Figure 1. (a) Schematic of the model for exciting precession of an AFM DW: Injection of an alternating spin-polarized current into an AFM layer with a N\u00e9el-type DW structure. Here the spin-polarized current with spin along z-axis is generated by the injection of an alternating current passing through the pinned FM layer; (b) rotation of two spin moments ( i S \uf072",

            "text": "Chaos is deterministic nonlinear dynamics that is sensitive to variation of initial conditions, and it attracts enduring research interests owing to its wide existence in nature and valuable applications, such as weather forecast, secure communication, and neuromorphic computing [1 ~ 3].\nNonlinear terms in dynamic equations are necessary for chaos. In a magnetic medium, spin dynamics is governed by Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which includes inherent nonlinear terms from dipole-dipole interaction and magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, chaotic spin dynamics is usually observed in nanoscale spintronic devices, such as current-induced chaotic precession of spatially uniform magnetization in a spin valve [4 ~ 8].\nIn addition to uniform magnetization, magnetic textures with inhomogeneous magnetization, such as domain walls (DWs), skyrmions, vortexes, and bimerons, also widely exist in magnetic materials. The spin dynamics of a magnetic texture generally includes translation (displacement of texture center) and precession (spin precession in a texture) [9 ~ 12]. In an antiferromagnetic (AFM) medium, most attention is paid to texture translation instead of precession up until now. A typical example is ultrafast AFM DW translation (velocity > 1000 m/s) with an upper limit of velocity, which is analogous to the relativistic motion of a massive object [13 ~ 17]. Very recently, chaotic translation was also predicted in an AFM texture under an alternating spin current by introducing a nonlinear force originated from the boundary of an AFM medium [18 ~ 22].\nIn an AFM material, DW precession is absent for uniform DW translation [13, 23, 24]. This ensures stable DW translation at a high velocity without worrying about Walker breakdown for an FM DW [25]. On the other hand, however, strong exchange coupling in an AFM DW offers potential for ultrafast spin precession in the DW, and this DW precession can exhibit special spin dynamics behaviors owing to the unique inertia of an AFM DW [25]. Nevertheless, how to excite AFM DW precession is still an open question.\ncurrent passing through the pinned FM layer; (b) rotation of two spin moments ( iS  and 1iS +  )\nnear the center of an AFM DW under damping-like spin transfer torque (STT); (c) precession\nof iS  and 1iS +  under field-like torque of DMI field; [The yellow regions in (b) and (c)\nindicate the xz plane.] This precession gives rise to the precession of 1i iSS +\u00d7  in the xy plane\nwith the variation of energy in terms of cos\u03d5 with \u03d5 the angle between 1i iSS +\u00d7  and yDe  (d).\nThis is analogous to the gravitational potential energy of a pendulum (e). In this work, we predict AFM DW precession excited by an alternating spin-polarized current with spin along the AFM easy anisotropy axis (z direction) (Fig. 1). Especially, the DW precession exhibits chaotic behaviors at moderate interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that contributes to a nonlinear term in the dynamics equation for DW precession. This work unravels rich behaviors of spin precession in an AFM DW and paves a way for developing nanoscale spintronic devices with a fast processing speed.\nWe considered a spin-valve-like device composed of a free AFM layer and a pinned FM layer separated by a nonmagnetic metallic layer [Fig. 1(a)]. The FM magnetization was fixed along the zaxis direction, and a N\u00e9el-type chiral DW was generated in the AFM layer with interfacial DMI.\nThis device configuration is experimentally feasible since similar devices have been proposed and fabricated to investigate spin dynamics under a spin-polarized current [26, 27]. When an electrical\ncurrent passes through the pinned FM layer, a spin-polarized current with spin ze\u03c3 \u03c3=   is\ngenerated and injected into the AFM DW. Under a damping-like spin transfer torque (STT)\n[ DL ( )S S J\u03c4 \u03c3\u221d \u00d7 \u00d7     ] acting on spin S  at current density J, the two spins near the DW center rotate\ndownwards or upwards in the xz plane [the yellow planes in Figs. 1(b) and (c)], depending on the\nsign of J [Fig. 1 (b)]. This DL\u03c4  breaks the initial DW stability, and the DW spins can be triggered\nto precess under the field-like torques from exchange coupling, magnetic anisotropy, DMI, and spinpolarized current. We will verify that the field-like torque of DMI plays a critical role in exciting chaotic DW precession. (S1 in the Supplementary Materials).\nThe interfacial DMI energy is quantified as DMI 1( )y i iE De S S += \u22c5 \u00d7   [28, 29], which gives rise to the\neffective DMI field acting on iS  as simDM 1 1 0 s )(i y i ie DH S S \u00b5 \u00b5 + \u2212 = \u2212 \u00d7 \u2212     with the magnetic\npermeability in vacuum 0\u00b5 and the magnetic moment s\u00b5 . Here iS  is the normalized spin\nmoment at the ith site. The mirror symmetry between iDMH  and 1iDMH +  gives rise to opposite\nchirality for the precession of iS  and 1iS +  [Fig. 1(c)]. As a result, 1i iSS +\u00d7  rotates in the xy plane,\nleading to the variation of DMI energy in terms of cos\u03d5 with \u03d5 the angle between 1i iSS +\u00d7  and\nyDe  [Fig. 1(d)]. (The angle variation between iS  and 1iS +  was disregarded under strong exchange\ncoupling.) This DMI energy is analogous to the gravitational potential energy of a pendulum [Fig. 1(e)]. Since a pendulum can exhibit chaotic mechanical dynamics under an alternating force, we expect chaotic spin precession in an AFM DW under an alternating spin-polarized current.\nTo confirm our expectation, we derived the dynamic equation of \u03a6 under an alternating spinpolarized current based on the following procedure [More details about the derivation are in the Supplementary Materials (S1)]. We started with the Hamiltonian H:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )21 1( ) ( )i i i i isim sim z sim y i i i H A S S K S e D e S S+ += \u22c5 \u2212 \u22c5 \u2212 \u22c5 \u00d7\u2211 \u2211 \u2211        . (1)\nHere Asim, Ksim, and Dsim are the exchange energy, anisotropy energy, and DMI energy for every spin.\nThe total magnetization S 1( )ii im M S S += +    and N\u00e9el vector 1 2 i i i\nS Sn + \u2212=    were introduced as\nthe basic quantities for the calculation of AFM dynamics. Here MS is the saturation magnetization of an AFM sublattice.\nIn continuous approximation, Eq. (1) was converted into the free energy as:\n2 2 2[ ' ( )] 2 2 2 2 z z y\nKa A DH m n Lm n n n n dxS e\u22a5 \u2032 \u2032= + + \u22c5 \u2212 + \u22c5 \u00d7\u222b     . (2)\nHere the upper prime denotes the derivative over x, and S\u22a5 is the area of the cross-section of an\nAFM chain. a, A, Kz, and D are homogeneous exchange constant, exchange stiffness constant, anisotropy constant, and DMI constant, respectively. They are related to Asim, Ksim, and Dsim by a = 2Asim/(VcellMs2); A = Asim\u0394x /(wtz); L = Asim\u0394x/(VcellMs); D = 2Dsim/(wtz), and Kz = 4Ksim/Vcell, where d is the distance between the nearest neighboring spins. Vcell = wtz\u0394x with \u0394x = 2d for the cell size in the x direction, and w = d is the chain width. We considered the parameters of AFM L10-MnPt: d = 0.28 nm, Asim = 40 meV, and Ksim = 0.23 meV [30 ~ 32]. Here d was calculated based on the lattice\nstructure and lattice constant of MnPt (a = 0.4 nm, and / 2d a= ) [30]. Since the sign and\nmagnitude of interfacial DMI depend on the composition above and below a magnetic layer, the interfacial DMI energy for every magnetic atom can be manipulated in a wide range (from 0 to several meV) [33]. In this work, we show that a DMI energy of 10\u22122 meV is enough for exciting chaotic DW precession under the above parameters. Under the spin-polarized current as indicated in Fig. 1(a), the dynamic equations of m and n  were deduced as [13]:\n1( ) ( )Dm z Bf en G m n n m l \u03b3\u03b3 \u00d7 \u00d7= \u2212 \u00d7       + .

(4)\nHere the upper dot indicates the derivative over time, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of electrons [1.76 \u00d7 1011 rad/(s\u22c5T)], and l is the magnitude of the N\u00e9el vector, which is close to 2MS under strong exchange coupling. G1 and G2 are the effective damping coefficients for n  and m \nas G1 = \u03b1/l and G2 = \u03b1l, where \u03b1 is the Gilbert damping coefficient. BD = \u03bcBPJ/\u03b3eMStz is the strength of the dampinglike STT, where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton; P = 0.48 is the spin polarization for Pt/Co [34]; e is the electron charge; MS = 5.05 \u00d7 105 A/m, which was calculated based on the magnetic moment of the Mn atom and the volume of space that every Mn occupies in L10-MnPt [31]. tz = 0.4 nm is the\nthickness of the AFM layer. mf  and nf  are the effective field for m and n :\nm m mf H am L x \u03b4 \u2202= \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 \u2202\n\n\n and '' ' 'zn n z yzf H An Lm K n e De n\u03b4= \u2212 = + + + \u00d7       . After a series of\nalgebra calculations (S1 in the Supplementary Materials), we derived the dynamic equation of n as:\n2 2 2 * ( )'' ( ') 0z z yz D zn n A n K n e D n a B la a enG e\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 + \u2212 + + + = \u00d7 \u00d7  \n\n        . (5)\nHere 2LA A\na \u2217 = \u2212 is the effective exchange constant including the parity-breaking term [35]. In a\nspherical coordinate system, ( )sin cos , sin sin , cosn \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8= \u03a6 \u03a6 , where \u03b8 and \u03a6 are the\npolar angle and the azimuthal angle, respectively. We considered a Walker-type DW profile [exp( )X( )2arct n ]a x t\u03b8 \u03bb \u2212 = and \u03a6 = \u03a6(t), where \u03bb is the DW width. For simplicity, we neglected the variation of \u03bb and assumed that the DW structure is kept in the DW precession (We verified this assumption by atomistic simulation as shown in S2 of the Supplementary Materials). Using the\nscalar product in Eq. (5) with X n\u2202 \u2202\n\nand n\u2202\n\u2202\u03a6\n\nand then integrating over the space of chain, the Thiele\nequations for X(t) and \u03a6(t) were finally deduced as:\n2 0X XGa\u03b3+ =  . (6)\n2 2 2 sin4 ( ) Da D a BG la \u03c0\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03bb \u03a6 + \u03a6 \u2212 =\u03a6  . (7)\nIn the previous calculation of the dynamics of an AFM texture, the driving force was generally acted on X instead of \u03a6, and \u03a6 was usually assumed to be constant without a nonzero initial angular velocity [13]. Therefore, most attention was paid to DW translation instead of DW precession. However, under a spin-polarized current with spin along the AFM anisotropy axis, the STT term appeared in the dynamic equation of \u03a6 instead of X [Eqs. (6) and (7)]. It is noticed that Eq. (7) is analogous to the dynamic equation of a classical pendulum that can exhibit a chaotic oscillation under an alternating driving force. Therefore, a chaotic DW precession is also possible under an alternating spin-polarized current. To verify our prediction, we numerically solved Eq. (7) using the 4th Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 0.01 ps. Also, we exploited atomistic simulation to study the precession of an AFM DW (S2 in the Supplementary Materials).\nRepresentative numerical solutions of Eq. (7) were shown in Fig. 2. Under weak DMI (D = \u22120.02 meV) with \u03b1 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123, in addition to synchronized DW precession at frequency f0, weak DW precession at frequencies f1 = 3f0, f2 = 5f0, and f3 = 7f0 was also detected [Figs. 2(a), (b)]. These\nhigher-order signals originated from nonlinear terms in the Taylor expansion of Dsin\u03a6 in Eq. (7). When \u03b1 was 2 \u00d7 10\u22124, the period of \u03a6(t) was absent, and no sharp peak can be seen in the spectrum of \u03a6. On the other hand, the trajectory in the phase diagram also failed to close after the precession for a long time (longer than 800 ps) [Figs. 2(c) and (d)], which hinted possible chaotic DW precession.\nTo confirm the transition between periodic and chaotic DW precession with DMI, we calculated the Lyapunov exponents (LEs) [Fig. 3; Details of the LEs calculation are in the Supplementary Materials (S3)] defined as [19]:\n0\n\u03b41LE lim ln \u03b4 i t i it t\u2192\u221e \u03a6 = \u03a6 . (8)\nHere 0\u03b4 i\u03a6 is the initial distance between two closed trajectories and \u03b4 it\u03a6 is the distance\nbetween two trajectories at time t. i = 1, 2, and 3 for \u03a6, d\u03a6/dt, and t, respectively. A positive LE1 indicates chaotic dynamics with an exponential increase of the distance between two trajectories for\nany nonzero 0\u03b4 i\u03a6 .\nAs indicated in Fig. 3(a), LE1 was negative when the DMI energy was either small (< 0.02 meV) or large (> 0.17 meV). In between, the LE1 was positive. The LE2 was symmetric to LE1, and LE3 kept zero. This indicates chaotic DW precession under moderate DMI. Under very weak DMI, the nonlinear term in Eq. (7) was negligible. Nevertheless, the DW precession was also depressed under strong DMI. The chaotic DW precession can also be verified from the bifurcation diagram [Fig. 3(b)]. Here we collected \u03a6 at a series of moments with an interval of the period of the driving current. Only one \u03a6 appears under either weak or strong DMI, but the number of \u03a6 approached infinite under moderate DMI. In addition to that, a small tip appeared when DMI was zero. This is ascribed to the irrelevance between \u03a6(t) and \u03a6 in absence of DMI.\nIn addition to the chaos generated through the bifurcation by manipulating DMI, intermittent chaotic DW precession was also triggered by adjusting the current density. Here, the intermittent chaos depicts alternating periodic and aperiodic dynamics, which can be induced by the collision of a chaotic attractor with the boundary of the basin of its attractor (crisis) in a system with multiple attractors [36, 37]. Here the basin describes the collection of initial conditions that leads to a long-\nterm behavior approaching an attractor. Under typical crisis-induced intermittent chaos, the trajectory in the phase portrait would wander between different attractors.\ntrajectories in (a) and (c) denote DW precessions with opposite chirality: the / 0d dt\u03a6 >\n(blue) and the / 0d dt\u03a6 < (green). These two running modes were separated in (a) ~ (d) but\nmixed in (e) and (f).\nIn this work, when J exceeded a critical value Jc1 = 4 \u00d7 1010 A/m2, there were two running\nattractors with an average positive or negative angular velocity [the blue and green lines in Figs. 4(a) and (b)] as denoted by the white and pink regions in Figs. 4(d) ~ (e), respectively. We collected the temporal \u03a6 and the basins of attractors under J > Jc1. When J = 4.9 \u00d7 1010 A/m2, the attractors were period-2, and the Poincar\u00e9 sections at \u03c90t = 0 (mod 2\u03c0) were individual dots located within different basins [Figs. 4 (d)]. When J was higher than another critical value Jc2 = 4.98 \u00d7 1010 A/m2, the attractors became chaotic, and the Poincar\u00e9 sections became continuous lines but were still confined in their own attractors [Figs 4(b) and (e)]. When J was further increased to exceed a third critical value Jc3 = 5.04 \u00d7 1010 A/m2, the two attractors simultaneously collided at the basin boundaries and joined to form a folded chaotic attractor [37], which indicates typical crisis-induced intermittent chaotic DW precession. This can also be verified by the irregular up and down running of \u03a6 [Figs. 4(c) and (f)]. In summary, we theoretically predict the excitation of chaotic AFM DW precession triggered by a spin-polarized current with spin along the easy anisotropy axis. This chaos originates from the intrinsic DMI of an AFM medium and exhibits particular crisis-induced intermittency. This work unravels rich precession behaviors in an AFM DW and paves a way to develop spintronic devices based on the spin dynamics of an AFM texture."
