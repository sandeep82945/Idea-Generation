    "abstractText": "A design method of low-pass (LP) negative group delay (NGD) integrated circuit (IC) implemented in 130-nm BiCMOS technology is investigated. The LP-NGD circuit is composed by RL-network with BiCMOS high Ohmic unsalicided N+poly resistor and symmetrical high current spiral inductor. The design methodology of the investigated LP-NGD circuit is explained by chip layout process. Then, the pre-simulation is performed with the design rule check (DRC) and 225 \u03bcm \u00d7 215 \u03bcm layout versus schematic (LVS) approaches. The LP-NGD design feasibility of the BiCMOS IC implementation is validated by AC frequency domain simulation with realistic component implementation constraints. As expected, the ideally calculated and simulated results show NGD of about -100 ps with 1.12 GHz cut-off frequency and -6 dB attenuation. Moreover, the LP-NGD function is also verified with transient analyses with Gaussian pulse and arbitrary waveform signals. As expected, despite the attenuation, the output signal leading and tailing edges appear in time-advance of about -100 ps compared to the input ones.

            "text": "The unfamiliar negative group delay (NGD) function is one of the most intriguing electronic functions. Because of its counterintuitive aspect, the design engineering of NGD electronic function remains a breakthrough for research designers. The initial experimentation highlighting the NGD effect existence was performed with negative group velocity (NGV) 3-D structures in 1980s [1-2]. The design feasibility of unfamiliar NGD electronic circuit becomes an attractive topic for curious RF and microwave engineering researchers. The NGD passive circuits were designed with NGV metamaterial 3-D periodical structures. The preliminary solutions were deployed in 2000s with the design of metamaterial inspired compact NGD microstrip circuits [3-5]. The 3-D to 1-D transfer function (TF) analogy leads to the implementation of metamaterial based NGD circuits [3-8]. The NGD function was verified in the microwave frequencies with more than 20-dB attenuation periodical artificial transmission line (TL) circuits [3-6]. Diverse NGD metamaterial-based circuits using tunable varactor diode [7] and resistive lossy left-handed TLs [8] were proposed. Nevertheless, compared to the classical electronic functions as filters, amplifier, oscillator, antenna, etc., nowadays a lot of efforts must be accomplished about the NGD design technique. Indeed, the NGD design method is still not familiar to most of electronic design engineers. Furthermore, the NGD interpretation raises curious questions from academic and industrial researchers. Therefore, further research for easy to understand knowledges about the NGD function must be conducted. Accordingly, because of the similarity between the linear circuit magnitude and group delay (GD) responses, a basic theory based on the analogy between the filter and NGD behavior was initiated [9]. Emphatically, different classes of NGD circuits were proposed and expected to be commonly and conventionally used by the non-familiar and non-specialist engineers in the future. Following the innovative concept, a class of lowpass (LP) NGD function was approved by passive [10-14] and active [15-18] circuit studies. In addition to the research work performed on the NGD understanding, several challenges are expected to be overcome on the NGD design method especially in term of circuit cumbersome and size reduction. Compact NGD circuits were designed in microstrip technology [19-20]. However, nowadays, the existing NGD electronic circuits [3-20] are generally designed with centimeter or decimeter size ranges. To overcome the size limitation bottleneck, we would like to develop a design method of NGD integrated circuit (IC) in CMOS technology similar to the classical electronic functions as frequency synthesizer [21] and transceiver devices [22-23]. Doing this, by inspiring from the inductor component CMOS design [24-25], an original design method of RLnetwork based LP-NGD passive circuit is initiated in the present paper. So far, the study of RL-network based NGD circuits are limited to the topologies implemented with lumped components [9-12,14]. The first design study of LPNGD BiCMOS IC is introduced in the present paper which is organized in four main sections as follows: \u2022 Section 2 describes the LP-NGD passive topology, circuit theory and the analytical characterization. By\nexploiting the voltage transfer function (VTF), the main LP-NGD specifications are expressed.\n\u2022 Section 3 presents the synthesis and design methodology of the LP-NGD IC implemented in 130-nm BiCMOS\ntechnology is developed. The feasibility study of LP-NGD BiCMOS IC design is presented with a proof of concept (PoC). Comparisons between BiCMOS IC PoC frequency simulations from the Cadence\u00ae commercial tool, and analytical calculations are discussed.\nPage 3 / 18\n\u2022 Section 4 is focused on the transient analyses of LP-NGD BiCMOS IC PoC. The time-domain signature of the\nLP-NGD function will be discussed based on the calculated and Cadence\u00ae simulated results.\n\u2022 Then, Section 5 ends the paper with conclusion."
