    "abstractText": "The high pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is attributed to the production of many virulence factors and its resistance to several antimicrobials. Among them, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a widely used disinfectant due to its strong antimicrobial effect. However, bacteria develop many mechanisms to survive the damage caused by this agent. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel mechanisms employed by P. aeruginosa to resist oxidative stress induced by the strong oxidizing agent NaOCl. We analyzed the growth of the P. aeruginosa mutants \u0394katA, \u0394katE, \u0394ahpC, \u0394ahpF, \u0394msrA at 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl, and showed that these known H2O2 resistance mechanisms are also important for the survival of P. aeruginosa under NaOCl stress. We then conducted a screening of the P. aeruginosa PA14 transposon insertion mutant library and identified 48 mutants with increased susceptibility toward NaOCl. Among them were 10 mutants with a disrupted nrdJa, bvlR, hcnA, orn, sucC, cysZ, nuoJ, PA4166, opmQ, or thiC gene, which also exhibited a significant growth defect in the presence of NaOCl. We focussed our follow-up experiments (i.e., growth analyzes and kill-kinetics) on mutants with defect in the synthesis of the secondary metabolite hydrogen cyanide (HCN). We showed that HCN produced by P. aeruginosa contributes to its resistance toward NaOCl as it acts as a scavenger molecule, quenching the toxic effects of NaOCl.",

Among them, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a widely used disinfectant due to its strong antimicrobial effect. However, bacteria develop many mechanisms to survive the damage caused by this agent. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel mechanisms employed by P. aeruginosa to resist oxidative stress induced by the strong oxidizing agent NaOCl. We\u00a0analyzed the growth of the P. aeruginosa mutants \u0394katA, \u0394katE, \u0394ahpC, \u0394ahpF, \u0394msrA at 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl, and showed that these known H2O2 resistance mechanisms are also important for the survival of P. aeruginosa under NaOCl stress. We\u00a0then conducted a screening of the P. aeruginosa PA14 transposon insertion mutant library and identified 48 mutants with increased susceptibility toward NaOCl. Among them were 10 mutants with a disrupted nrdJa, bvlR, hcnA, orn, sucC, cysZ, nuoJ, PA4166, opmQ, or thiC gene, which also exhibited a significant growth defect in the presence of NaOCl. We\u00a0focussed our follow-up experiments (i.e., growth analyzes and kill-kinetics) on mutants with defect in the synthesis of the secondary metabolite hydrogen cyanide (HCN). We\u00a0showed that HCN produced by P. aeruginosa contributes to its resistance toward NaOCl as it acts as a scavenger molecule, quenching the toxic effects of NaOCl.\nKEYWORDS\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, oxidative stress, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen cyanide, reactive chlorine species, oxidative stress response, antimicrobial resistance\n1. Introduction\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is an ubiquitous environmental, Gram-negative bacterium and a highly versatile opportunistic human pathogen that can be\u00a0isolated from soil, water, plants, and animals (Ambreetha and Balachandar, 2022). In humans, it can cause severe and diverse infections of considerable medical importance, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, endocarditis, urinary tract, and systemic infections, mainly in immunocompromised individuals (Bassetti et\u00a0al., 2018). One remarkable characteristic of P. aeruginosa is its ability to adapt and survive under various and harsh environmental conditions due to a sophisticated network of stress responses, including cold, heat, and oxidative stress responses (Craig et\u00a0al., 2021; Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2021)."

Among them, reactive oxygen (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, H2O2) and chlorine (e.g., hypochlorous acid, HOCl) species (ROS and RCS, respectively) are highly reactive molecules produced as by-products of the metabolism of oxygen of living organisms (endogenous production) or encountered by bacterial cells from exogenous sources, such as disinfectants (Bardaweel et\u00a0al., 2018). In bacterial cells, these molecules oxidize several molecules and disrupt numerous cellular processes. For instance, they react with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids resulting in membrane damage and affecting protein, DNA, RNA, and energy synthesis (Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2021). Due to their potent activity, ROS and RCS are widely used in many applications as disinfectants in domestic, industrial and hospital settings, water and wastewater treatment, cleaning of wounds, and as antiseptic agents (Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2020, 2021; Gold et\u00a0al., 2020). Furthermore, H2O2 and HOCl are also produced by human immune cells as a defense against invading pathogens (Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2020). Overall, HOCl is a more potent oxidizing agent with a much faster antimicrobial effect than H2O2 (Peskin and Winterbourn, 2001; Winterbourn et\u00a0al., 2016). It is the active ingredient of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl; household bleach) and is considered the most commonly used chlorine-based disinfectant and oxidant in drinking water disinfection (Fukuzaki, 2006; Deborde and von Gunten, 2008).\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is constantly exposed to oxidative stress, either from endogenous production or exogenous sources, by the use of disinfectants. In this context, this bacterium has developed many mechanisms to survive the toxic effects of these agents. Although HOCl is a stronger oxidant than H2O2, most research has focused on the H2O2 responses adopted by P. aeruginosa, and only a few studies have identified and characterized specific stress responses and resistance mechanisms against HOCl (Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2020). However, most of these adaptive responses are not specific to a single agent but are part of a general oxidative stress response in P. aeruginosa. For instance, detoxifying enzymes, such as catalases, alkyl hydroperoxides, and protein repair systems, such as MrsR, are wellknown to be\u00a0involved in the resistance of P. aeruginosa against H2O2 (Panmanee and Hassett, 2009; Romsang et\u00a0al., 2013). Furthermore, transcriptional regulators, mainly OxyR, are also crucial for the survival of P. aeruginosa under oxidizing conditions (Ochsner et\u00a0al., 2000). Previous studies have used gene expression analyzes or screening for regulatory proteins to characterize the adaptation of P. aeruginosa to HOCl (Groitl et\u00a0al., 2017; Farrant et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThis study aims to identify novel genes involved in the resistance of P. aeruginosa to the strong oxidant NaOCl by a targeted screening of genes known to be\u00a0involved in H2O2 resistance as well as screening the comprehensive P. aeruginosa PA14 mutant library (Liberati et\u00a0al., 2006) for mutants with increased susceptibility to NaOCl."

Furthermore, to statistically analyze the growth curves obtained, we\u00a0 measured the AUC. AUC, also known as growth potential (Todor et\u00a0al., 2014), is a metric to quantify the cumulative effect of overall growth over time (Sprouffske and Wagner, 2016).\nPseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 WT treated with 1 \u03bcg/ mL NaOCl took approximately 5\u20136 h to reach an OD600nm of 0.2 (double the initial OD).

After 20 h of growth, the \u0394hcnA mutant exhibited an OD600nm of 0.382, while the PA14 WT showed an OD600nm of 0.6. Furthermore, the \u0394hcnA mutant presented a MIC of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, which was \u00bc x MIC of PA14 WT. Given this pronounced increase in susceptibility, we\u00a0focused the following analyzes on HCN and its contribution to NaOCl resistance.\nSince HCN is produced by the hcnABC gene cluster in P. aeruginosa (Gilchrist et\u00a0al., 2011), we\u00a0evaluated if the absence of hcnB and hcnC also affects the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to NaOCl by analyzing the growth of the corresponding PA14 and PAO1 \u0394hcnB and \u0394hcnC mutants at 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. Like the \u0394hcnA PA14 mutant, the corresponding PA14 and PAO1 \u0394hcnB and \u0394hcnC mutants showed an increase in susceptibility to NaOCl, presenting extended lag phase and reduced AUC compared to the WT strains at 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl. This phenotype seemed specific to NaOCl since these mutants did not present altered susceptibility to H2O2 at a final concentration of 400 \u03bcg/mL compared to WT strains (Figure\u00a0 5; Table\u00a0 4). These results confirm the importance of HCN production for P. aeruginosa survival under NaOCl stress conditions.\nTo test whether the increased susceptibility of the hcn mutants was due to the absence of HCN, we\u00a0complemented the PAO1 mutant PA2194 PW4739 (\u0394hcnB) by the transfer of the phcnBC plasmid, which expresses the genes hcnBC. Since both PA14 and PAO1 mutants presented increased susceptibility to NaOCl, we\u00a0focused our analyzes on the PAO1 \u0394hcnB mutant since this mutant has been characterized in a recent study (L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2022). We\u00a0assessed if the \u0394hcnB mutant could be\u00a0complemented by evaluating the release of HCN by our PAO1 strains using a semiquantitative method for HCN detection (L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2022). When grown in LB for 24 h, both PAO1 WT and the \u0394hcnB-phcnBC produced a detectable\namount of HCN, while the \u0394hcnB mutant did not produce HCN (Figure\u00a06A).\nThen, we\u00a0 conducted growth kinetic analyzes to determine whether the production of HCN by P. aeruginosa increases its resistance to NaOCl. As shown in Figure\u00a0 6B, it took 6 h for the complemented strain \u0394hcnB-phcnBC to reach the OD600nm of 0.2, similar to the PAO1 WT strain. Furthermore, no statistical difference in growth was found for the AUC of \u0394hcnB-phcnBC and PAO1 WT when treated with 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl (Table\u00a05). Together, these results indicate that growth delay in response to NaOCl in the PAO1 \u0394hcnB mutant could be\u00a0 complemented by the insertion of the hcnBCproducing plasmid phcnBC, demonstrating that HCN plays a role in the resistance of P. aeruginosa to NaOCl."

In a previous study, Frangipani et\u00a0al. (2014) investigated the effect of endogenously produced HCN on P. aeruginosa by transcriptomic analysis. The authors identified four P. aeruginosa genes that were repressed in response to endogenously produced HCN and 12 genes induced in response to HCN. To test if any of these HCN-controlled genes are involved in NaOCl resistance, we\u00a0 conducted growth analyzes by exposing P. aeruginosa PAO1 strains with mutations on the identified genes to 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl and measured their growth for 20 h.

This mutant strain presented an AUC (5.785 \u00b1 3.059) similar to \u0394hcnB (6.214 \u00b1 1.074). The PA4134 gene forms a gene cluster together with PA4133, with PA4133 being located upstream of PA4134;1 however, the PA4133 mutant did not show any significant difference in NaOCl susceptibility.\nWe then tested if the metabolite HCN itself would directly react with NaOCl and quench its toxic effect. For this, we\u00a0first analyzed if removing HCN from the medium would change the susceptibility of \u0394hcnB and PAO1 WT strains by evaluating the kill kinetics in response to NaOCl. Cells grown overnight were washed twice, resuspended in PBS to remove the HCN from the medium, and NaOCl was added to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ mL. The absence of HCN in the medium did not provoke a\n1 pseudomonas.com\ndifference in the NaOCl susceptibility of PAO1 WT and \u0394hcnB (Figure\u00a07A), in which no statistical difference was found for the cell concentration over time for both strains. Overall, the growth analyzes and kill-kinetic results suggested that the susceptibility phenotype found for \u0394hcnB is likely not due to a cellular effect.\nNext, we\u00a0aimed to complement the susceptibility phenotype of \u0394hcnB with the supernatant from PAO1 WT and the complemented strain \u0394hcnB-phcnBC. We\u00a0 used the culture supernatant of HCN-producing strains instead of the pure chemical HCN due to the high toxicity of HCN and its related forms [e.g., sodium cyanide (NaCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN)]. For this, we\u00a0resuspended overnight \u0394hcnB cells in the supernatants of \u0394hcnB, PAO1 WT, and \u0394hcnB-phcnBC grown in BM2 minimal medium. Then, the bacterial suspensions were treated with NaOCl at 4 \u03bcg/mL for 60 min. Figure\u00a07B shows that the addition of PAO1 WT and \u0394hcnBphcnBC supernatants to cells of \u0394hcnB complemented the \u0394hcnB phenotype, and \u0394hcnB cells showed increased resistance to NaOCl (percentage survival of 88 and 83%, respectively) compared to the \u0394hcnB cells resuspended in \u0394hcnB supernatant (17% survival).\nFIGURE\u00a03 Susceptibility of PA14 mutants and PAO1 homologs identified in the screening to NaOCl.

            "text": "Bacteria have developed several mechanisms to mitigate the harmful and often irreversible damage caused by oxidizing agents. Most of these resistance mechanisms are not specific but rather provide a general defense against a broad range of oxidizing agents. In this context, the knowledge of HOCl-specific responses is still limited (Gray et\u00a0 al., 2013; da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0 al., 2020). Among the HOCl responses described so far, ATP-independent chaperones are considered the immediate response against HOCl since they are readily activated by the oxidation of amino acid residues. These enzymes are essential for HOCl response since they do not require the expression of sensor mechanisms, which takes a long time compared to the fast action of HOCl on proteins (Goemans and Collet, 2019; Sultana et\u00a0al., 2020). Other mechanisms include the activation of the transcriptional regulators HypT, NemR, and RclR and the formation of biofilms (Gray et\u00a0al., 2013; Strempel et\u00a0al., 2017; Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2020).\nIn this study, we\u00a0demonstrated that the loss of KatA, KatE, AhpC, AhpF, and MsrA increases the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 to NaOCl compared to the WT strains, showing that these H2O2 responses are employed by this bacterium as a general response\nagainst oxidizing agents. We\u00a0then identified 48 mutants with increased susceptibility to NaOCl and characterized 10 mutants in more detail. Among them, we\u00a0found that HCN acts as a scavenger molecule and increases the survival of P. aeruginosa in the presence of NaOCl.\nMost oxidative stress responses have been characterized for H2O2 and other ROS, while their roles in RCS and NaOCl resistance remain mostly unknown. Therefore, in the first part of this study, we\u00a0showed by growth kinetics analyzes that well-known H2O2 responses are also involved in the survival of P. aeruginosa to NaOCl. Catalases and peroxidases are specialized enzymes that convert H2O2 into less toxic species (i.e., H2O + O2 and alcohol + H2O, respectively; Cavinato et\u00a0al., 2020). These enzymes are widely distributed among bacteria (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2021) and are the primary response against oxidative stress (Romsang et\u00a0al., 2013). P. aeruginosa has three catalases (katA, katB, and katE) and four alkyl hydroperoxide reductases (ahpA, ahpB, ahpCF, and ohr), in which KatA is considered the main catalase and its expression is controlled by various systems, such as OxyR, quorum sensing, and ANR (anaerobic regulator; Heo et\u00a0al., 2010; Su et\u00a0al., 2014). KatA and AhpA are continually expressed during bacterial growth, implying their importance as a defense not only during harmful conditions but also against endogenously produced ROS (Ochsner et\u00a0al., 2000; Lee et\u00a0al., 2005). Many studies have shown that the production of these detoxifying systems is upregulated by oxidizing agents in P. aeruginosa, such as H2O2 (Salunkhe et\u00a0al., 2002; Palma et\u00a0al., 2004; Chang et\u00a0al., 2005; Small et\u00a0al., 2007a,b), NaOCl (Small et\u00a0al., 2007a,b; Groitl et\u00a0al., 2017), hypobromous acid (Groitl\nTABLE\u00a03 Area under the curve (AUC) of NaOCl and H2O2 growth curves of NaOCl-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains identified in the screening.\nGene name P. aeruginosa strains\nNaOCl H2O2\nUntreated 1 \u03bcg/mL Untreated 400 \u03bcg/mL PAO1 WT 9.288\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.875 7.946\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.874 9.385\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.747 5.542\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.775\nPA14 WT 8.115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.983 7.310\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.912 8.279\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.748 4.253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.956\nnrdJa PA5497 PW10298 8.776\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.056 6.058\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.027* 8.626\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.195 4.264\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.416\nPA14_72540 8.572\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.525 5.031\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.122* 7.555\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.149 4.644\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.003\nbvlR PA2877 PW10298 8.776\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.056 6.877\u00b1\u00a00.665 8.846\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.254 6.494\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.68\nPA14_26880 8.096\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.110 4.295\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.310* 7.506\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.115 4.872\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.934\nhcnA PA14_36330 8.695\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.365 4.034\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.968* 8.178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.192 3.863\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.674\norn PA4951 PW9335 7.635\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.308 6.868\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.372 9.055\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.553 4.645\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.518\nPA14_65410 7.991\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.327 4.880\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.049* 7.502\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.031 3.828\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.452\nsucC PA14_43950 6.094\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.136 4.787\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.747* 6.927\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.181 3.254\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.509\ncysZ PA0846 PW2541 8.520\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.068 5.991\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.442* 8.385\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.152 5.324\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.150\nPA14_53330 8.229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.283 4.302\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.661* 7.563\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.144 4.216\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.679\nnuoJ PA2645 PW5426 7.327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.543 6.765\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.840 7.619\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.212 5.524\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.564\nPA14_29900 7.851\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.119 6.328\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.503 6.146\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.214 3.429\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.247\nPA4166 PW8062 7.812\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.670 7.102\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.814 8.552\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.116 4.919\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.609\nPA14_09990 8.414\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.260 5.794\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.315 7.793\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.159 4.171\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.928\nopmQ PA2391 PW5021 7.711\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.348 6.339\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.236* 8.639\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.048 4.529\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.775\nPA14_33750 8.222\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.337 5.525\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.978* 7.657\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.030 4.226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.051\nthiC PA4973 PW9367 4.765\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.356 2.194\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.354* 4.609\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.241 1.864\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015*\nPA14_65740 6.383\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.677 5.272\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.088* 4.974\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.381 1.891\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.098*\nWT, wild-type.

Furthermore, P. aeruginosa katA, katB, ahpB, and oxyR mutant strains were consistently more susceptible to H2O2 than the WT strains (Ochsner et\u00a0 al., 2000; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2005), corroborating our results. This susceptibility phenotype of kat and ahp mutants was also reported for other bacterial strains, such as Vibrio cholerae (Wang et\u00a0al., 2012) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Li et\u00a0al., 2020). In the context of HOCl resistance, little has been explored on the roles of these enzymes in the resistance of P. aeruginosa toward this oxidant. The importance of detoxifying enzymes such as catalases has been described for Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori (Dukan and Touati, 1996; Benoit and Maier, 2016), in which catalases are considered a ubiquitous enzymes with quenching ability toward oxidizing agents in general (Benoit and Maier, 2016), corroborating our findings for P. aeruginosa. Considering that proteins are the main target of HOCl, another important stress response mechanism is the protein repair system Msr. P. aeruginosa and most bacterial species have two highly conserved Msr systems: MsrA and MsrB (Romsang et\u00a0al., 2013). As for KatA and AhpA, MsrA is expressed during all growth phases, while MsrB is overproduced under oxidative stress conditions (Romsang et\u00a0 al., 2013). In accordance with our PA14 susceptibility results, PAO1 msrA and msrB mutants presented increased susceptibility to H2O2 and NaOCl in the study by Romsang et\u00a0al. (2013). Hence, our findings report the involvement of kat, ahp, and msr genes in NaOCl resistance, adding to the previously described function of these response mechanisms. We then performed a genome-wide mutant library screening of the PA14 transposon mutant library (Liberati et\u00a0al., 2006) to find mutants with increased susceptibility to NaOCl. We\u00a0 were able to identify 48 genes with reduced MIC values toward NaOCl compared to PA14 WT, and we\u00a0characterized 10 mutants (disrupted nrdJa, bvlR, hcnA, orn, sucC, cysZ, nuoJ, PA4166, opmQ, and thiC gene, respectively) in more detail (Table\u00a02). Library screenings allow access to a large number of mutants carrying specific genetic alterations; therefore, researchers can simultaneously screen multiple mutants for the phenotype of interest in a short period. This approach is valuable for uncovering novel genes and pathways that contribute to bacterial resistance (Moser et\u00a0 al., 2014). Among them, two mutant strains, \u0394cysZ and \u0394opmQ, lacked genes involved in the transport of small molecules.

Proteins, mainly the sulfur-containing ones, are the main target of HOCl in the cells (Da Cruz Nizer et\u00a0al., 2020); therefore, due to the reduction of the amount of sulfur in the cells due to its reaction with HOCl, the transport of this compound to the cells seems to be\u00a0necessary (Farrant et\u00a0al., 2020). The upregulation of transport and metabolism of sulfur genes by HOCl has also been described for E. coli and Salmonella enterica Serovars Enteritidis (Wang et\u00a0al., 2009, 2010). Overexpression of genes involved in the transport of small molecules (Small et\u00a0al., 2007a,b) has been detected by transcriptomic studies and has been implicated in the need of cells to allow the entry or exit of metabolites, such as toxic HOCl-by-products and compounds needed for cell metabolism (Albrich et\u00a0al., 1986).\nIn accordance with previous reports about the oxidation of DNA by HOCl (Pr\u00fctz, 1996), we\u00a0found the nrdJa gene, which encodes for a ribonucleotide reductase and was previously reported to be\u00a0involved in DNA repair (Torrents et\u00a0al., 2005). NrdJa is crucial for growth under anaerobic conditions (Wu et\u00a0al., 2005; Filiatrault et\u00a0al., 2013)\nand was upregulated after ciprofloxacin exposure (Cirz et\u00a0al., 2006). Furthermore, Crespo et\u00a0al. (2017) also found increased transcription of nrdJ under H2O2 stress, supporting our findings (Crespo et\u00a0al., 2017). Ribonucleotide reductases have also been shown to be\u00a0used by many other bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum (Zuo et\u00a0 al., 2018), Bacillus subtilis (Castro-Cerritos et\u00a0 al., 2017) and E. coli (Monje-Casas et\u00a0 al., 2001) as a response mechanism to oxidative stress, mainly H2O2.\nConsidering the high metabolic diversity of P. aeruginosa, many genes and pathways remain to be\u00a0explored regarding their secondary effects and possible roles in resistance. In this context, we\u00a0identified two genes involved in energy metabolism (i.e., sucC and nuoJ) and one implicated in thiamine biosynthesis (thiC). Thiamine, for example, has been explored as a target in the development of antibiotics (L\u00fcnse et\u00a0al., 2014; Kim et\u00a0al., 2020), while energy metabolism genes, such as sucC and nuoH, nuoM, and nuoN have been shown to be\u00a0downregulated in response to\nFIGURE\u00a05 Susceptibility of hcn PA14 and PAO1 mutants to NaOCl and H2O2.

Furthermore, transcriptomic studies have shown the downregulation of energy production genes in cells under HOCl (Small et\u00a0 al., 2007a,b). However, their contribution to oxidative stress remains to be\u00a0elucidated.\nIn our screening, we\u00a0 also identified genes involved in the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa by controlling virulence factors and resistance production (bvlR and orn). BvlR is a transcriptional repressor that belongs to the LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family. It is upregulated during exposure to epithelial cells (Frisk et\u00a0al., 2004) and controls several virulence factors in P. aeruginosa, indicating a role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium. BvlR represses the expression of the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), cupA-associated fimbrial-based surface attachment, and toxin A. Furthermore, it was shown to promote tight microcolony formation, which is associated with the formation of biofilms in the lung of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (McCarthy et\u00a0al., 2014). The\noligorribonuclease Orn also affects T3SS production (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016) and contributes to bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones by a pyocinmediated mechanism (Chen et\u00a0al., 2017) and aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams and oxidative stress by influencing the translation of katA mRNA (Xia et\u00a0al., 2019).\nAnother finding in our screening was a mutant with a disrupted hcnA gene. The absence of HCN in our P. aeruginosa mutant strains increased their susceptibility to NaOCl, while the complementation of \u0394hcnB with an HCN-producing plasmid recovered the phenotype in our growth kinetic analyzes. HCN is a toxic volatile secondary metabolite as it has no apparent function in primary metabolism and is produced at later stages during the exponential phase and offers an advantage for the producing strain, which is tolerant to it (Blumer and Haas, 2000). It is synthesized by many bacterial genera, including Alcaligenes, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Rhizobium (Blumer and Haas, 2000; Abd El-Rahman et\u00a0al., 2019). In P. aeruginosa, HCN is synthesized by the HCN synthase, encoded by the hcnABC operon, and regulated by quorum sensing and the ANR regulator (Pessi and Haas, 2000). P. aeruginosa cultures produce up to 300 \u03bcM of HCN by the decarboxylation of glycine, and the hcnABC operon is induced by low oxygen (Blumer and Haas, 2000) and high cell density, with maximum production at the end of the exponential phase (Blier et\u00a0al., 2012). The toxic effect of HCN is due to the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, impairing cell oxygen consumption and energy production (Zuhra and Szabo, 2022). P. aeruginosa has two systems to avoid HCN intoxication. One involves a cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase, CioAB, which allows aerobic respiration in the presence of\nFIGURE\u00a06 (A) Semiquantitative detection of HCN production by P. aeruginosa strains. cultures were grown in LB at 37\u00b0C and 220 rpm. Then, cells were washed twice and resuspended in LB. Two mL of overnight cultures were transferred to a small petri dish, which was covered by chromatography paper soaked in HCN detection reagent composed of copper (II) ethyl acetoacetate and 4,4\u2032-methylenebis-(N,N-dimethylaniline) solubilized in chloroform.

Due to its high toxicity, HCN also exerts a toxic effect on non-producing strains (Zdor, 2015; Biswas and G\u00f6tz, 2022). In this context, HCN produced by P. aeruginosa has been shown to control the growth of S. aureus, contributing to P. aeruginosa competition (L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2022). Here we\u00a0show that HCN also contributes to the survival of P. aeruginosa to the strong antioxidant NaOCl. Recently, studies have shown the effect of signaling molecules on the resistance profile of bacterial species (Li et\u00a0 al., 2022). Therefore, to investigate the HCN-mediated response to NaOCl in P. aeruginosa, we\u00a0 first tested the hypothesis that the production of HCN induces cellular mechanisms that, in turn, activate resistance mechanisms. For instance, indole produced by bacterial species induces bacterial resistance endogenously and exogenously by many mechanisms, including efflux pump regulation, biofilm formation, and induction of the persister state (Li et\u00a0al., 2022). We\u00a0then tested a list of P. aeruginosa genes that were up or down-regulated under endogenously produced HCN (Frangipani et\u00a0al., 2014). Except for the gene PA4134, no NaOCl susceptibility was found for the mutant strains tested, suggesting that the NaOCl phenotype found in this study is likely not due to cellular regulation.\nTABLE\u00a06 Area under the curve (AUC) of NaOCl growth curves of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 strains.\nP. aeruginosa strains Regulation by HCN# AUC \u00b1 SD\nUntreated 1 \u03bcg/mL NaOCl PAO1 WT 9.288\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.875 7.946\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.874\nPA14 WT 8.115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.983 7.310\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.912\nPA0433 PA0433 PW1792 \u2193 9.110\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.503 7.682\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.079\nPA14_05630 7.952\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.268 7.624\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.822\nPA0434 PA0434 PW1793 \u2193 9.074\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.311 6.904\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\nPA14_05640 8.051\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.323 6.828\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.660\nPA0435 PA0435 PW1795 \u2193 9.452\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.502 7.005\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.078\nPA14_05650 8.162\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38 7.520\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.772\nPA2299 PA2299 PW4885 \u2193 9.393\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.366 8.354\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.937\nPA14_15830 8.208\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.190 7.609\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.386\nPA2328 PA2328 PW4927 \u2191 9.510\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.164 8.565\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.505\nPA14_41480 8.365\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.455 7.592\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.655\nPA2329 PA14_02330 \u2191 8.137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.621 7.728\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.317\nPA2330 PA2330 PW4930 \u2191 9.368\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.305 8.775\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.830\nPA14_34490 7.709\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.227 7.802\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.517\nPA2331 PA2331 PW7998 \u2191 9.490\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.232 7.544\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.839\nPA14_10540 8.232\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.359 7.617\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.615\nPA3022 PA3022 PW6063 \u2191 9.181\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.331 7.228\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.425\nPA14_24980 8.038\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.505 6.325\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.978\nPA4129 PA4129 PW7993 \u2191 9.113\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.397 6.482\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.977\nPA4130 PA4130 PW7996 \u2191 9.290\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.083 7.835\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.936\nPA14_10550 6.401\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.398 6.176\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.577\nPA4131 PA4131 PW7998 \u2191 9.367\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.115 7.331\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.316\nPA14_10540 8.238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.105 7.278\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.483\nPA4132 PA4132 PW8001 \u2191 8.879\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.457 7.095\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.207\nPA14_10530 7.652\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.176 6.651\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.933\nPA4133 PA4133 PW8002 \u2191 9.595\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.243 7.832\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.309\nPA14_10500 6.479\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.112 5.895\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.227\nPA4134 PA4134 PW8004 \u2191 9.748\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.522 5.785\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.059*\n#Gene regulation by endogenously produced HCN by transcriptomic analysis conducted by Frangipani et\u00a0al.

Due to its high reactivity, HOCl is known to react rapidly with sulfurand nitrogen-containing compounds, producing chlorinated derivatives with impaired functions (Winterbourn, 1985; Pattison et\u00a0 al., 2012). In this context, the reaction between HCN and HOCl, the active ingredient of NaOCl in aqueous solution (Fukuzaki, 2006), forms CO2, N2, and HCl. However, due to its toxicity, we\u00a0could not evaluate if adding HCN to P. aeruginosa would rescue the NaOCl-susceptibility phenotype found for the \u0394hcnB mutant, and we\u00a0used different supernatants from WT and HCN-deficient strains as an alternative approach.\nIt is believed that the production of HCN by bacteria serves various purposes, including defense mechanisms, helping the bacteria compete with other microorganisms for resources, and antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the growth of other microorganisms. Here, we\u00a0have identified a new role for HCN produced by pathogenic bacteria as a NaOCl scavenger molecule, contributing to bacterial resistance under NaOCl stress conditions. We\u00a0hypothesize that HCN is produced in the context of P. aeruginosa infection, such as wound infection in which the environment presents low oxygen levels, favoring anaerobic microorganisms (Versey et\u00a0al., 2021), and helping in the fight against oxidative stress produced by the immune system or from exogenous sources. Many bacteria produce a wide array of virulence factors and secreted metabolites. Many of these secreted molecules have been shown to quench and neutralize the toxic effect of oxidizing agents. For example, melanin produced by bacteria is a free radical scavenger (Sichel et\u00a0 al., 1991; Agodi et\u00a0al., 1996) that protects bacterial cells against oxidative stress (Rodr\u00edguez-Rojas et\u00a0 al., 2009; Thippakorn et\u00a0 al., 2018). The search for molecules that act as scavengers for antimicrobial agents or immune system factors and understanding these metabolites help develop new strategies to eradicate P. aeruginosa and fight infections and the spread of this bacterium.\nOf note, due to the high reactivity of NaOCl and its active ingredient, HOCl, the chemistry behind the formation and\nconsumption of RCS in media is complex (Peskin et\u00a0al., 2005; Pattison and Davies, 2006). For instance, rich media such as LB have been shown to completely quench the oxidizing effect of HOCl, while in some buffers such as PBS, no change in the levels of RCS was detected (Ashby et\u00a0 al., 2020). In this context, in minimal growth media containing amine, chloramines can be\u00a0formed by the chlorination of amino groups by the chlorine present in HOCl (P\u00e1l Feh\u00e9r et\u00a0al., 2019). Therefore, the amount of HOCl and other RCS will depend on the type of media used and their ability to quench HOCl as well as to produce other RCS."

Our PA14 mutant library screening identified 48 genes and showed that P. aeruginosa relies on diverse mechanisms to survive the potent and often irreversible stress caused by NaOCl. Among them, we\u00a0 identified the hcnA gene and showed that HCN contributes to the resistance of P. aeruginosa by quenching the toxic effect of NaOCl. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the roles of HCN in NaOCl resistance."
