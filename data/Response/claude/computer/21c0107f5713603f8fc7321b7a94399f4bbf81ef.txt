 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate more optimal algorithms for MAC address de-randomization that have lower computational complexity. The current approach scales exponentially as the number of devices increases. New algorithms could aim for linear or log-linear complexity.

2. Explore additional features that could help distinguish devices with very similar probe requests, such as timing/sequence data, radio channel characteristics, etc. This could improve accuracy for challenging scenarios with many devices of the same type.

3. Develop methods to automatically tune the parameters of the clustering and matching algorithms based on the characteristics of the deployment environment. This would remove the need for manual tuning. Machine learning approaches could be applied.

4. Test the feasibility of simplifying the method to estimate device count directly from probe request counts, without de-randomization. This could work well in crowded areas but needs more validation.

5. Expand the system for tracking individual device trajectories over an area covered by multiple sensors. This could enable crowd flow monitoring and other mobility pattern analyses while preserving privacy.
