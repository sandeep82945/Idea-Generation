    "abstractText": "Yeast particles (YPs) are 3\u20135 \u03bcm hollow and porous microspheres, a byproduct of some food grade yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) extract manufacturing processes. Terpenes can be efficiently encapsulated inside YPs by passive diffusion through the porous cell walls. As previously published, this YP terpene encapsulation approach has been successfully implemented (1) to develop and commercialize fungicide and nematicide products for agricultural applications, (2) to co-load high potency agrochemical actives dissolved in terpenes or suitable solvents, and (3) to identify YP terpenes with broad-acting anthelmintic activity for potential pharmaceutical applications. These first-generation YP terpene materials were developed with a <2:1 terpene: YP weight ratio. Here we report methods to increase the terpene loading capacity in YPs up to 5:1 terpene: YP weight ratio. Hyper-loaded YP terpenes extend the kinetics of payload release up to three-fold compared to the commercialized YP terpene formulations. Hyper-loaded YP-terpene compositions were further optimized to achieve high terpene storage encapsulation stability from \u221220 \u25e6C to 54 \u25e6C. The development of hyper-loaded YP terpenes has a wide range of potential agricultural and pharmaceutical applications with terpenes and other compatible active substances that could benefit from a delivery system with a high payload loading capacity combined with increased payload stability and sustained release properties.",

            "text": "Terpenes are a large class of naturally occurring compounds that constitute the primary components of essential oils obtained from plants. Terpenes have received great commercial interest due to their wide range of functional properties. Terpenes are used as permeation enhancers and antioxidants in cosmetics, for their broad range of potential anti-infective applications against pathogens in agricultural products, as additives in food packaging to prevent bacterial spoilage oxidation, and in pharmaceutical products as bioactive compounds or as excipients due to their permeation enhancer properties [1\u20134]. A potential benefit of terpenes in pharmaceutical applications is that the multiple mechanisms of action (e.g., interference with the phospholipid layer of cell membranes, blocking of cholesterol synthesis, impairment of enzyme systems) evolved over millennia as plant defense molecules make it extremely unlikely for infective agents to build resistance against terpenes [5,6]. Applications of terpenes will continue increasing to address consumer trends favoring the use of natural antimicrobials over chemical preservatives in food, agricultural, consumer, and pharmaceutical products. There are, however, a few challenges in using terpenes in commercial products primarily associated with some terpene\u2019s chemical stability and poor water solubility. Most terpenes are volatile oils and are prone to chemical degradation when exposed to air, heat, light, and moisture. It is usually necessary to prepare terpene-based products with high levels of surfactants or alcohols to protect terpenes and to increase their solubility in water. Terpene formulations that are produced as aqueous emulsions or dry powder formulations\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3580. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27113580 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3580 2 of 13\ngenerally contain a low percentage of terpenes by weight. Applications of terpenes in certain products, such as food preservatives, pose additional challenges due to safety limits and marked organoleptic effects. Encapsulation of terpenes in nano or micro-structured carriers is an innovative and promising approach to overcome the challenges of terpene instability, poor water solubility, and unacceptable taste/odor, as well as to potentially provide for controlled terpene release and targeted delivery [4,7]. Encapsulation techniques currently employed in the preparation of terpene products include emulsification, extrusion, fluidized bed coating, spray drying, liposomes, molecular inclusion, coacervation, in situ polymerization, and nanostructured lipid matrices [8\u201312]. A nano or microencapsulation process should (1) have high terpene encapsulation efficiency, (2) have high terpene loading capacity, (3) provide homogenous terpene distribution in the payload carrier, (4) be low cost and operate under mild processing conditions, (5) improve terpene protection, (6) possess sustained release characteristics, and (7) retain the biological activity of terpenes. The materials selected for terpene encapsulation should have mechanical strength as well as controlled release properties and be non-toxic. Commonly used materials for microencapsulation of terpenes include gum Arabic, gelatin, chitosan, modified starches, maltodextrin, and other materials that are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and therefore acceptable for applications in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and agricultural products [4,11]. We have developed methods using yeast particles (YPs) to efficiently encapsulate high levels of terpenes. YPs are 3\u20135 \u00b5m hollow and porous microspheres, a byproduct of some food grade Baker\u2019s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) extract manufacturing processes. We have used YPs for the encapsulation of a broad range of molecules for drug delivery and agricultural applications [13\u201321]. Terpenes can be loaded inside the hydrophobic cavity of YPs based on the passive diffusion of terpenes through the porous yeast cell walls. Sustained release from YPs is the reverse process and is a function of terpene-water solubility. This approach has been successfully implemented to develop and commercialize YP-terpene based fungicide and nematicide products for agricultural applications [22\u201327]. More recently, we have identified YP terpenes with broad-acting anthelmintic activity [20] which could lead to the development of formulations for oral terpene delivery for the treatment of gastrointestinal worm parasites and other infectious agents. In addition, we have developed a YP terpene encapsulation approach using non-volatile, biodegradable pro-terpene compounds for improved stability and controlled, sustained terpene release from YPs [19,21]. In this article, we report methods to increase the terpene loading capacity in YPs up to a 5:1 terpene: YP weight ratio. These hyper-loaded YP terpene formulations fully retain the terpene\u2019s biological activity and extend the duration of payload release up to three-fold compared to the earlier generation YP-terpene (1.1:1 terpene: YP weight ratio) formulations used in commercialized products. The development of hyper-loaded YP terpenes has a wide range of potential agricultural and pharmaceutical applications that could benefit from a delivery system with high terpene loading capacity, payload stability, and sustained terpene release."

We previously developed methods to use 3\u20135 \u00b5m YPs for the encapsulation of terpenes or biodegradable pro-terpene compounds without the need for alcohol or surfactants [19\u201321].

The mechanical properties of Baker\u2019s yeast cells have been studied by compression testing by micromanipulation, a technique that allows measuring properties such as the elastic modulus of particles with sizes as small as 1 \u00b5m. These studies have shown that Baker\u2019s yeast cells possess an elastic modulus of 185 \u00b1 15 MPa [33].

A minimum volume of 0.5 \u00b5L water per 1 mg YPs is required for efficient loading therefore limiting the preparation of hyper-loaded YP terpenes to a maximum ratio of 5:1 at the target YP concentration of 150 g/L. We prepared YP-GET samples at ratios greater than 5:1 by mixing YP, water, and\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3580 6 of 13\nGET to generate samples with a final YP concentration of 100 g/L and GET:YP ratios of 6:1 and 7:1. The terpene encapsulation efficiency decreased to ~80% and there was no significant increase in particle diameter in these samples compared to the YP-GET 1:5 sample. These results show that the maximum loading capacity of GET in YPs is between 5:1 to 5.5:1 GET:YP weight ratio."

The terpenes in the GET composition have maximum solubility in water of 0.686 (geraniol), 0.9 (thymol), and 1.44 mg/mL (eugenol). A 1:100 dilution of a YP-GET 1:1.1 (150 mg YP/mL, 165 mg GET/mL) generates a sample with a total GET concentration in water of 1.65 mg GET/mL. The concentration of each terpene is below its maximum solubility in water at this 1:100 dilution. The results in Figure 4A for YP-GET 1.1:1 show sustained release of ~7.5 mg (<50% GET content in a 100 mg YP-GET 1.1:1 sample) during the first 6 h of incubation and no additional release from 6 to 24 h. The plateau after six hours indicates that some GET is retained in the particles, likely due to interactions with hydrophobic lipids in the YP cell walls. A second dilution (1:1) was done at 24 h to achieve complete GET release from YP-GET 1.1:1. Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 14\nFigure 4.

Biological Activity of Hyper-Loaded YP GET The antimicrobial biological activity of YP-GET samples was evaluated against different model microbial organisms to show that YP-GET retains the broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects of free GET. Terpenes have strong membrane permeation properties, and a primary mode of action is the disruption in structural changes of the plasma membranes of both fungi and bacteria [35,36]. The lipophilic isoprene unit of terpenes exhibits great affinity for the lipid portion of plasma membranes and the hydrophilic polar groups increase this activity because of their interactions with proteins and carbohydrates [37,38]. The results in Table 2 show all YP-GET samples were active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, and GET loading in YPs appears to enhance terpene MIC. Generally, unencapsulated GET emulsions are less stable and are four-fold less potent than the YP encapsulated GET formulations. The E. coli and S. aureus bacteria require a much lower concentration of ampicillin, and C. albicans requires a 10-fold lower concentration of fluconazole than YP GET to reach MIC 75%. However, resistance to ampicillin and fluconazole is common, whereas attempts to isolate strains resistant to 10- fold higher concentrations of the GET monoterpenoids have repeatedly failed in our hands. Further, ampicillin-resistant and fluconazole-resistant bacterial and fungal strain susceptibility to YP-GET remains the same as the sensitive strains, showing the value of using monoterpenoids as a biocide (data not shown).\nFigure 4.

The samples were diluted 1:1 every 24 h to determine the number of cycles to achieve complete GET release from YPs (Figure 4B\u2013E). The GET release results show that (1) hyper-loaded YP-GET are stable, as no burst release leading to the release of an emulsion of terpenes in water and empty YPs was observed upon dilution, and (2) it is possible to extend the number of wetting/terpene release cycles three-fold from the two cycles for the commercialized YP GET 1.1:1 up to six cycles for the hyper-loaded YP GET 4:1 and 5:1 formulations. Extending the duration of terpene sustained release could significantly enhance efficacy and time between spraying for agricultural applications of YP-GET in soils, field crops, post-harvest decay, and seed treatments. The kinetics of terpene release from YPs was evaluated in water to simulate release conditions in rainwater and ambient humidity and in 0.9% saline to simulate groundwater and biological fluids (Supplementary Materials Figure S2). The salt conce tration has no effect on terpene release.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3580 7 of 13\nThe analysis of the GET released from the particles showed a similar release pattern for each terpene in each of the five YP GET samples indicating that the three terpenes are releasing together as an isotropic mixture and not differentially releasing based on their water solubility, as eugenol and thymol are significantly more water soluble than geraniol (release data for each terpene can be found in Supplementary Materials Figure S3). This is important for the consistent antimicrobial bioactivity of this mixture of terpenes released over time."

Statistically significant results (t-test) were obtained between average particle diameter of empty YPs and YP GET samples (*** p < 0.001).\nNext, we evaluated the storage encapsulation stability under temperature stress conditions from \u221220 \u25e6C to 54 \u25e6C. The YP-GET samples were not stable showing between 15% to 40% GET release after storage at \u221220 \u25e6C and 54 \u25e6C at all GET:YP ratios. The major reason for instability was the appearance of broken shells prematurely releasing their terpene contents. We hypothesized that YP-GET could be stabilized for storage at low and high temperatures by the incorporation of a cryoprotectant during the loading of GET in YPs. Glycerin is a GRAS compound used as a cryoprotectant in biological applications, such as the low temperature storage of blood cells. Glycerin works as a cryoprotectant by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water. A mixture of 30% glycerin and 70% water has a freezing point of \u221238.9 \u25e6C and a boiling point of 114 \u25e6C [39] and therefore is a suitable solvent system to improve the temperature encapsulation stability of YP-GET. It is possible to prepare YP-GET samples using 30% glycerin at YP concentration of 100 g/L and GET:YP ratios of 3:1 up to 4.5:1. These samples were produced with high encapsulation efficiency (>90%), have the same MIC as YP-GET samples shown in Table 2, and the use of 30% glycerin as solvent did not impact GET release.

Terpenes (eugenol, thymol, and geraniol) were procured from Penta Manufacturing (Livingston, NJ, USA). All reagents and solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) or Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Luria broth (LB) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) was prepared from DifcoTM yeast extract, DifcoTM Bacto peptone, and dextrose (all materials obtained from Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a composition of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% dextrose w/v. YP loading of terpenes (terpene:YP w/w ratio of 1.1:1): Dry YPs were mixed with water (180 g YP/L) and the slurry was passed through an Emulsiflex\u00ae-C3 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, ON, Canada) to obtain a uniform, single YP suspension. Samples of homogenized YP (8.35 g) were mixed with a geraniol-eugenol-thymol (GET) mixture (1.65 g GET at a composition of 2:1:2 GET weight ratio) and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 24 h to allow for complete terpene loading by diffusion through the porous yeast cell wall into the hydrophobic hollow interior. YP loading of terpenes (terpene: YP w/w ratio \u2265 2:1): Dry YPs were mixed with water for 30 min to obtain a uniform YP suspension (terpene loading at high terpene: YP ratios does not require homogenization of YPs) and then a 2:1:2 GET mixture was added to the YP sample and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 24 h to allow for complete terpene loading. The amounts of YP, water, and terpene required to prepare YP GET with weight ratios of 1.1:1 to 5:1 are indicated in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Statistically significant results were determined by t-test (* p < 0.1, *** p < 0.001).\nThe importance of achieving these high levels of terpene encapsulation in YPs include: (1) ext nded sustained terp ne release, (2) eliminated the need for homogenization to produce single particle suspension concentrat s, (3) reduced YP costs, while maintaining (4) terpene stability, and (5) enhanced bioactivity over free terpen s. The previously developed YP GET 1.1:1 formulation simplified handling and applications of terpenes in agricultural applications and the su tained rele se increases the durati n of action of the terpene in the soil or on pl ts compar d to free t rpenes. The new hyper-loaded YP-GET samples extend the duration of terpene release up to three-fold compared to the commercialized YP GET 1.1:1 formulation. The methods developed to generate temperature-stable hyper-loaded YP-GET could be used for other YP single terpene or terpene mixtures. The development of these hyper-loaded YP terpenes has a wide range of potential applications offering high payload loading capacity, increased payload stability, and sustained release properties."

Nile red was imaged using a rhodamine (red) filter (maximum excitation/emission wavelengths at 550/570 nm) and FITC-ConA was imaged with a green filter at 490/520 nm. Microscopy images were collected with an Olympus BX60 (Olympus, Waltham, MA, USA) upright compound fluorescent microscope [20]. YP GET samples (100 mg) were centrifuged to collect excess liquid (free terpene and water) and the pellet fraction was resuspended in 10 mL of 90% methanol\u201310% water to extract encapsulated terpenes. Terpenes were quantified by HPLC [20] operated with 32 KaratTM software version 7.0 (Beckman Coulter, Inc, Brea, CA, USA), using a Waters Symmetry\u00ae C18 column (3.5 \u00b5m, 4.6\u00d7 150 mm) with acetonitrile:water 50:50 as mobile phase, flow rate at 1 mL/min, injection volume of 10 \u00b5L, and terpene detection at 254 nm. This isocratic HPLC method allows for the detection of the three terpenes in the GET mixture in a single run with the following retention times: 5.2 min (eugenol), 7.7 min (geraniol), and 9.8 min (thymol). The quantification of terpenes was done by measuring the peak area and interpolating the concentration using a calibration curve obtained with terpene standards. Terpene release from YP-GET: YP-GET samples (100 mg) were suspended in water (10 mL) and incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Aliquots were collected at predetermined times, centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected to measure terpene released from the particles by HPLC. The initial YP-GET suspension in water (1.5 mg YP/mL) was diluted two-fold, incubated at room temperature for another 24 h, and samples were collected to quantify terpene release from YPs. Additional two-fold dilutions were done every 24 h until achieving >90% release from YPs. YP-GET encapsulation storage stability: YP-GET samples (500 mg) were transferred into glass vials and stored at room temperature (23 \u25e6C) or 54 \u25e6C for two weeks. The third set of samples were subjected to three freeze (\u221220 \u25e6C)/thaw (23 \u25e6C) cycles. The encapsulation\nMolecules 2022, 27, 3580 11 of 13\nstorage stability was assessed by Nile-red microscopy, yeast particle diameter measurement using ImageJ software [40], particle counting with a hemocytometer, and quantification of free and encapsulated terpene by HPLC before and after storage. Measurement of particle diameter: Microscopy images of YP control and YP-GET samples were obtained at 1000\u00d7 g magnification. An image of a microscope calibration slide ruler was used to set the scale in pixels/\u00b5m in ImageJ software. The photomicrographs of YP samples were evaluated with the calibrated scale in ImageJ. The particle diameter along the major and minor axes of the YP ellipses was measured for 20 whole yeast cell particles per picture and a minimum of three pictures per sample. Optimization of hyper-loaded YP-GET: Dry YP was mixed with water and glycerin (70% water, 30% glycerin) for 30 min to obtain a uniform YP suspension, and then 2:1:2 GET was added to the YP sample and incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 24 h to allow for complete terpene loading. YP-GET samples in water (control) and water-glycerin at YP concentration of 100 g YP/L and GET:YP ratios from 3:1 up to 4.5:1 were prepared, characterized for terpene encapsulation efficiency, and evaluated for encapsulation storage stability as described above. Antimicrobial activity assays against model bacterial and fungal organisms: The antimicrobial activity of YP-GET was evaluated using a modified published microplate assay procedure [41]. Samples of YP-GET were suspended in 100 \u00b5L of growth medium (LB was used in antibacterial assays and YPD in antifungal assays) and added to the first row (Row A) of a 96-well plate (all wells in the 96-well plate contain additional 100 \u00b5L medium). Serial dilutions (1:1) were performed by transferring 100 \u00b5L from Row A to Row B, etc., and finally removing 100 \u00b5L from Row H. Diluted Escherichia coli Top10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636, or Candida albicans SC5134 [42] cells (100 \u00b5L, 106 cells/mL) was added to all wells of the plate. Initial (t = 0) and final (t = 16 h, 37 \u25e6C) absorbance readings were taken at 650 nm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the concentration of terpene that inhibits bacterial or fungal growth as measured by absorbance by more than 75%. Statistical Analysis: All experiments were conducted with a minimum of three replicates and the reported data correspond to average values with standard deviation. Prizm v. 9 was used for all graphs and two-group comparisons. For all comparisons, a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was used."

            "text": "Yeast particles can be used for the encapsulation of terpenes with high terpene loading capacity, up to a 5:1 terpene: YP ratio. A mixture of geraniol, eugenol, and thymol (GET) previously used to develop YP-GET 1.1:1 was used as a model terpene composition to prepare hyper-loaded YP-GET. The hyper-loaded YP-GET samples were produced with >95% GET encapsulation efficiency and the increased loading capacity, up to a 5:1 GET:YP ratio, is possible due to the high swelling properties of YPs allowing for an increase in YP diameter to accommodate the large terpene droplet at higher payload levels in the swollen hollow cavity of the particles. These hyper-loaded YP-GET samples enhanced sustained GET release up to three-fold compared to the previously developed YP-GET 1.1:1 formulation, show higher antimicrobial potency than unencapsulated GET, and improved thermal terpene storage encapsulation stability. Hyper-loaded YP-terpenes possess properties of interest for the development of YP terpene materials with a wide range of potential agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. Similarly, high levels of some hydrophobic actives can also be loaded into YPs, extending the versatility of the YP delivery technology."
