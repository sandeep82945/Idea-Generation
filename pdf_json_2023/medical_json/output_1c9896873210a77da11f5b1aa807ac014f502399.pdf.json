            "text": "Mitophagy, the degradation of mitochondria via a specialized form of macroautophagy (hereaer referred to as autophagy), is a major mechanism for mitochondrial quality control.1 During mitophagy, dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria are recognized and engulfed by autophagosomes, followed by mitophagosomal fusion with lysosomes and autophagic degradation.2 Depending on the physiological context, mitophagy is classied as basal, programmed or stress-induced.

This design was inspired by the growing body of literature focused on identifying selective mitophagy receptors that are important for mitochondrial degradation. For example, the mitochondrial proteins NIX, BNIP3 and FUNDC1 are mitophagy receptors that sustain mitochondrial homeostasis following diverse stimuli.1 NIX (NIP3-like protein X) contains both a transmembrane (TM) domain that is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and a conserved LC3interacting region (LIR) that acts to promote the formation of autophagosomes surrounding mitochondria.14 Similar to NIX, OMM-localized BNIP3 (ref. 15) (BCL2 interacting protein 3) and FUNDC1 (ref. 16) (FUN14 domain containing protein 1) interact directly with LC3-II-positive autophagosomes through their LIR motifs, inducing mitochondrial degradation. Broadly, these\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nScheme 1 (a) Mechanism of mito-ATTEC-triggered mitophagy.

Inspired by this strategy, in the present work, we design and synthesize a novel mitophagy inducer, termed mito-ATTECs, which are engineered by linking a mitochondria binder with a LC3-binding molecule. Mito-ATTECs would target mitochondria and form a complex with LC3 to promote autophagosome formation surrounding mitochondria. Subsequently, autophagosomes containing mitochondria rapidly fuse with lysosomes to facilitate the degradation of mitochondria. Therefore, mitoATTECs overcome the detrimental effects associated with the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by inducers routinely used to trigger mitophagy. Our results identify the function of mito-ATTECs in recruiting autophagosomes to mitochondria, demonstrating a general strategy for chemical-induced mitophagy. Furthermore, the excessive mitophagy activation (lethal mitophagy) leads to complete mitochondrial degradation and autophagy-dependent cell death in tumor cells.18,26,27 Specically, our results indicate that\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The therapeutic efficacy of mito-ATTECs has been further evaluated by using subcutaneous and pulmonary metastatic melanoma models. Our results indicate that mito-ATTEC treatments lead to mitophagy hyperactivation and irreversible cell death in melanoma murine models with no adverse side effects. Thus, targeting lethal mitophagy by mito-ATTECs may offer an attractive therapeutic approach to circumvent therapeutic resistance and enhance the effects of anticancer therapies.27"

So, the synthesized bifunctional mito-ATTECs could interact with bothmitochondria and LC3-IIpositive autophagosomes simultaneously, leading to autophagic degradation of mitochondria (Scheme 1).\nFirst, we characterized the interactions between mitoATTECs and mitochondria using the uorescence colocalization experiment. MitoTracker Red CMXRos (MTR) dye was used to label mitochondria in living cells. We observed that mitoATTECs localized to mitochondria (Fig. S1a\u2020) without affecting the mitochondrial function (Fig. S1b and c\u2020). Similar results were obtained from in vitro MMP experiments29 (Fig. S1d\u2020). Taken together, targeting mito-ATTECs to mitochondria did not disrupt mitochondrial integrity.19\nSelective degradation of mitochondria by mito-ATTECs\nSince mito-ATTECs bind to mitochondria in cells, we next explored whether mito-ATTECs might enhance the degradation of mitochondria as expected. Mitochondrial content was rst determined by CLSM using MTR dye.30 We observed no change in MTR signals in cells treated with two separated warheads (alk-DP and azi-TPP, 30 mM), indicating that the separated warheads were incapable of reducing cellular mitochondrial content (Fig. 1a). In contrast, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in MTR uorescence levels on treatment with mitoATTECs for 24 h, reaching a near complete mitochondrial depletion at a concentration of 30 mM (Fig. 1b). Similarly, prolonged exposure durations at a xed concentration of mitoATTECs (30 mM) resulted in a time-dependent decrease in cellular mitochondrial content (Fig. 1c and d). Collectively, the conjugation between the mitochondrion-targeting warhead and LC3-binding moiety in the bifunctional molecule was indispensable for the depletion of mitochondria.\nThese ndings were corroborated by lower mitochondrial protein levels (OMM protein TOM20 as well as the mitochondrial matrix 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60)) aer mitoATTEC treatment (Fig. 1e).

We also observed lower ATP contents aer mito-ATTEC treatment compared with that in DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, the acute loss of mitochondria was directly observed (Fig. 1j) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Quantitation of TEM images showed that 55% of MCF-7 cells lacked mitochondria completely aer mito-ATTEC treatment. In conclusion, these results suggested that mito-ATTEC treatment could reduce pools of functional mitochondria; a similar process is observed during erythrocyte maturation.5\nMito-ATTECs target mitochondria to autophagosomes for degradation\nMito-ATTECs were predicted to interact with both mitochondria and LC3, thus bridging the targeted mitochondria with\n11194 | Chem.

To verify this, we evaluated the accumulation of autophagosome protein LC3 in the mitochondrial fraction.24 Upon 6 h mito-ATTEC treatment, LC3 puncta were mainly colocalized with OMM protein Tom20 compared to puncta in the untreated control (Fig. 2a), suggesting that mito-ATTEC treatment facilitated the engulfment of mitochondria by autophagosomes. In contrast, LC3B puncta were not colocalized with Tom20 in response to alk-DP/azi-TPP (30 mM) treatment, indicating that the induced interaction betweenmitochondria and LC3 has important roles in targeting LC3-II-positive autophagosomes to mitochondria.\nNext, potential co-localization of mitochondria and autolysosomes was visualized by CLSM using MCF-7 cells stained with MTR and LysoTracker Green (LTG).18,31 Compared to the untreated control, the colocalization of mitochondria and lysosome obviously increased aer mito-ATTEC treatment, indicating the induction of mitophagy (Fig. S2a\u2020). Whereas knockdown of ATG5, which is essential for autophagosome maturation, obviously decreased the co-localization of mitochondria with lysosomes. Moreover, accumulation of the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 2 Mito-ATTECs trigger autophagic degradation of mitochondria.

In conclusion, the designed mito-ATTECs induced the mitochondria\u2013LC3 interaction and tethered mitochondria to autolysosomes for subsequent degradation.\nWe further ascertained the activation of mitophagy using the mito-Keima protein, a mitochondria-targeted reporter that allows for assessment of mitophagy (Fig. 2c).32 Keima is a lysosomal protease-resistant uorescent protein and also exhibits pH-sensitive excitation. At a neutral pH in the cytosol, the shorter-wavelength excitation predominates (458 nm). At an acidic pH following delivery of mitochondria to acidic\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Similarly, ATG5 knockdown resulted in a signicant decrease in the red signal in MCF-7 cells, reecting autophagy's dominant role in mito-ATTECinduced mitochondrial degradation.\nChem.

In contrast, co-incubation with rapamycin (100 nM) resulted in a more pronounced decrease in mitochondrial content (Fig. S2e and f\u2020).24 These results further ascertained that mito-ATTECs eliminated mitochondria via autophagy, which could be enhanced with autophagy activators.\nWhilemito-ATTECs enhanced engulfment ofmitochondria by autophagosomes, we inferred that they probably did not inuence global autophagy, since the LC3-targeting warhead of the synthesized chimera molecules did not inuence global autophagy.23,24 As shown in Fig. S2g,\u2020 compared to DMSO-treated cells, we observed no signicant change in the numbers of lysosomes in mito-ATTEC-treated cells. Moreover, the levels of autophagosomal marker LC3-II were not affected by mito-ATTEC\nFig. 3 Mito-ATTEC treatment inhibited invasion and growth of tumor c Representative images from the invasion assay are shown in (a) and quan dead cell analysis after different treatments (24 h).

Collectively, mito-ATTECs could activate mitophagy without inuencing the global autophagy activity.\nMitophagy induced by mito-ATTEC blocked cancer migration and growth\nGiven that mitochondrial function is strongly associated with tumor invasiveness and metastasis,33 we investigated the potential effect of mito-ATTECs on cancer invasion via a Boyden chamber invasion assay. As compared with DMSO-treated cells, mito-ATTECs effectively suppressed the migration of MCF-7 cells at a relatively low concentration, whereas treatment with separated warheads (30 mM) were insufficient to suppress cancer invasion (Fig. 3a and b).\nNext, we evaluated the effects of hyperactivating mitophagy on the viability of malignant cells.18,27 As shown in Fig. 3c, live/ dead staining clearly demonstrated the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of mito-ATTECs on tumor cells.

Thus, linking alk-DP to the azi-TPP via click chemistry is essential to increase its anti-tumor efficiency. Furthermore, mito-ATTECs also exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against different types of tumors (Fig. 3e). Specically, melanoma cells were more sensitive to mitoATTECs than other tumors or normal cells.\nMito-ATTECs kill cancer cells through an autophagydependent mechanism\nNext, we characterized the mechanism of cell death induced by mito-ATTECs. With regard to apoptosis, we observed that ZVAD-FMK (40 mM), an inhibitor of caspases and apoptosis, failed to block mito-ATTEC-triggered cell death (Fig. 4a). In addition, the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (10 mM) also failed\nFig. 4 Mito-ATTEC induced autophagic cell death resulting in reduced inhibitors (necrostatin-1) had no impact on mito-ATTEC-induced cell significantly reduced mito-ATTEC induced cell death.

As shown in Fig. S3,\u2020 mitoATTECs reduced the growth and viability of MCF-7 cells. In contrast, ATG5 knockdown protected MCF-7 cells from mitoATTEC-induced cell death. Alk-DP and azi-TPP did not obviously decrease the growth and viability of MCF-7 or ATG5-KD MCF-7 cells. These results indicated that mito-ATTECs kill malignant cells through an autophagy-dependent mechanism.18,27\nTo substantiate this conclusion, MCF-7 cells were co-treated with autophagy inhibitors or activators.

These results indicated that mito-ATTECs kill cancer cells via autophagy, and may have cooperative effects with autophagy activators.24\nWe further ascertained the dominant role of autophagy in mito-ATTEC-triggered cell death using morphological analysis. Ultrastructural examination by TEM of mito-ATTEC (30 mM, 24 h)-treated cells exhibited unique characteristics of autophagydependent cell death.36 Namely, mito-ATTEC-treated MCF-7 cells showed increased vacuolization and a decreased number of mitochondria, yet retained normal nuclear morphology (Fig. 4d).35,37 Moreover, increased vacuolization was also observed in CLSM images and was unique to mito-ATTECtriggered autophagy-dependent cell death (Fig. 4e). Collectively, these ndings indicated that mito-ATTEC-induced excessive mitophagy led to autophagic cell death.27\nBroad activity of mito-ATTECs against tumor cell lines\nRecent studies have indicated that functional mitochondria are indispensable for the growth of malignant cells in several tumor types.38 To determine how widely applicable the lethal mitophagy might be, we further assessed the killing efficacy of mito-ATTECs on several tumor cell lines. Mito-ATTECs reduced viable cell numbers in all of these 9 tumor cell lines aer 24 h treatment (Fig. 3e). The mechanisms of mito-ATTEC-induced killing of malignant cells identied above were highly relevant to other cancers. As depicted in Fig. S4a\u2013d,\u2020 mito-ATTEC treatment obviously suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by complete mitochondrial depletion. Of note, it was found that low concentration of mito-ATTECs exhibited powerful bioactivity and cytotoxicity on human malignant melanoma cell line A375 (Fig. S4e\u2013h\u2020). The IC50 value of mitoATTECs against A375 cells was about 11.9 mM. Similarly, mitoATTECs were also active against mouse melanoma cell lines (Fig. S4i\u2013k\u2020), inducing autophagic death of B16-F10 cells with an IC50 value of 9.1 mM. The elevated protein expression of LC3B in melanoma may sensitize melanoma to lethal mitophagy (Fig. S5\u2020). In summary, the mito-ATTEC-induced mitochondrial depletion and cell death were conrmed in several cell lines using different methods, indicating that induction of lethal mitophagy may be a general therapeutic approach.\nMaximum tolerated dose of mito-ATTECs\nFirst, a 21 day toxicology study of mito-ATTECs was conducted on C57BL/6J mice. As shown in Fig. S6a,\u2020 the administration of mito-ATTECs showed negligible impact on the growth of mice. Moreover, no adverse effects were observed in mice by hematology analysis or blood biochemical assay (Fig. S6b\u2020). Therefore, mito-ATTECs, even at a high dose (34 mg kg\u22121), was well tolerated and did not show any detectable toxicity.\nIn vivo evaluation on the anti-melanoma activity\nTo further evaluate the therapeutic potential of mito-ATTECs in melanoma, two mouse models of melanoma were generated to\n11198 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 11192\u201311202\nevaluate the efficacy of mito-ATTECs. B16F10 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into male C57BL/6J mice that were treated 7 days later by injection of saline, precursors (alkDP and azi-TPP) or mito-ATTECs (17 mg kg\u22121) over a period of 14 days. Dramatic tumor growth was observed in saline- or precursor-treated groups, whereas mito-ATTEC treatment obviously reduced the growth of subcutaneous transplanted B16F10 tumors (Fig. 5a\u2013c). Excessive mitophagy was also conrmed in the tumor tissues dissected from mito-ATTECtreated mice (Fig. 5d), demonstrating that the mechanism conrmed in vitro also occurred in the B16F10-melanomabearing mice model. Moreover, mice exhibited normal behavior and no apparent toxicity was observed during mitoATTEC treatment (Fig. 5b). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining images also conrmed that no organ damage occurred aer mito-ATTEC treatment (Fig. S6c\u2020).\nNext, we evaluated the effects of mito-ATTECs in a C57BL/6J mouse model of lung metastasis. As shown in Fig. 5e\u2013g and S6d,\u2020 when B16F10 melanoma cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of C57BL/6J mice, where cells would transfer to the lung to form tumors, treatment with mito-ATTECs effectively reduced the numbers of melanoma cells in the lung.27 These results clearly suggested the potent anti-melanoma activity of mito-ATTECs in vivo."

            "text": "Bioavailable mitophagy inducers are scarce. Pharmacological screenings for mitophagy chemical inducers are ongoing, and several natural and synthetic compounds have been shown to manipulate mitophagy in mitophagy-defective models.1 Unfortunately, high-throughput screening for drug discovery is timeconsuming and also has a high failure rate.11 Moreover, the effectiveness of these inducers may only be applicable to the specied cell line or a certain species (e.g., mouse).12 Thus, a simple and universal strategy for mitophagy modulation is needed. Lessons from targeted protein degradation and a fresh understanding of mitophagy have the potential to facilitate the development of novel mitophagy chemical inducers. Inspired by the receptor-mediated mitophagy, we developed a general chemical tool to modulate mitophagy, mito-ATTECs, which employs chimera molecules composed of LC3-recruiting molecules linked to mitochondria-binding moieties. Mitochondriatargeted mito-ATTEC interacts with LC3 to promote autophagosome formation surrounding mitochondria. Subsequently, autophagosomes containing mitochondria rapidly fuse with lysosomes to facilitate the degradation of mitochondria. Our results indicate that chimera molecules bind to both mitochondria and autophagosome protein LC3, and target mitochondria directly to autophagosomes for degradation. Thus, mito-ATTECs overcome the toxicity related to dissipation of the MMP by agents routinely used to activate mitophagy, and provide a versatile chemical tool to manipulate mitophagy. Besides, LC3/ATG8 family proteins are evolutionarily conserved, existing in all eukaryotic cells. Therefore, mito-ATTECs would be functional in multiple species, including fungi, plants and animals. More importantly, by varying the mitochondrion\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

For example, monoamine oxidase (MAO), mainly expressed in the brain, is an OMM-anchored, wellcharacterized senescence marker.39 We thus hypothesized that MAO inhibitor-based mito-ATTECs would localize at the OMM and interact with LC3 directly to induce mitophagy in the brain, specically. Collectively, the described methodology may become a universal chemical tool for mitophagy modulation.19\nActivatedmitophagy oentimes has a complex impact on the cell fate, promoting either cell survival or death.1 Several chemical inducers have been veried to facilitate the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy activation, such as urolithin A (UA),9,10 kaempferol,11 T-271,13 and AUTAC.12 Supplementation of these inducers results in cytoprotective and anti-ageing effects in several mitophagy-defective models. On the other hand, sustained mitophagy induced by pharmacological or genetic methods may eventually lead to cell death.1 For example, the depletion of AAA-ATPase ATAD3 hyperactivated mitophagy in mouse hematopoietic cells. Affected mice displayed decreased bone-marrow cellularity, erythroid anemia, and reduced survival.40 Moreover, C18ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid, has been shown to localize to the mitochondria, induce excessive mitophagy, and induce\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nautophagy-dependent tumor cell death.18,26 However, the effects of chemical inducers on mitophagy hyperactivation and the roles of mitophagy hyperactivation in cell death remain unclear. To this end, we design and synthesize the rst lethal mitophagy inducer, which to our knowledge, can hyperactivate mitophagy by bridging mitochondria and LC3-II-positive autophagosomes. We have demonstrated that sustained mitophagy leads to mitochondrial depletion and autophagy-dependent cell death. Our results pave the way towards a deeper understanding of lethal mitophagy in living systems.\nMitochondria lie at the nexus of cancer genesis and progression, such as metabolic reprogramming, invasive capability, and apoptosis.38 As such, mitochondria-damage-induced apoptosis is emerging as a vital mechanism by which chemotherapeutic drugs induce cell death.41 However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy are attenuated due to increased mitophagy, which is closely related to chemoresistance and tumor recurrence.42,43 Consequently, it is of great importance to explore alternative approaches for anti-tumor therapy other than destroy mitochondrial function. In the present work, lethal mitophagy induced by mito-ATTECs may provide an alternative modality, fundamentally distinct from current strategies, to\nChem.

We have veried that mitoATTEC-induced dose-dependent cell death can be prevented by genetic (ATG5 knockdown) and pharmacological (3-MA) interference with autophagy, but not apoptosis or necroptosis.27 Moreover, detailed ultrastructural analysis also reveals unique death characteristics such as increased vacuolization and a decreased number of mitochondria.37 Our results have demonstrated the predominant role of autophagy in mitoATTEC-mediated mitochondrial depletion and autophagic cell death. Taken together, this work provides a compelling rationale for prociently harnessing mitophagy in anti-cancer therapy.\nOur present work indicated that melanoma is substantially sensitive to mito-ATTECs. There are at least two potential explanations for such a result. First, mito-ATTECs bind to both mitochondria and autophagosome protein LC3, initiating mitophagy. Thus, the expression level of the autophagosome protein LC3 is closely related to mito-ATTEC activity.24 Several tumor samples and normal control samples were analyzed to assess LC3 expression levels. As depicted in Fig. S5,\u2020 LC3 expression was signicantly higher in melanoma compared to in other tumor types and normal control samples. The increased protein expression of LC3 in melanoma may enhance susceptibility to lethal mitophagy. Second, the bioactivity and cytotoxicity of mito-ATTECs is deeply inuenced by autophagy. Autophagy inhibition (3-MA co-incubation or ATG5 knockdown) impeded both the degradation of mitochondria and the suppression of tumor growth following treatment with mitoATTECs. Conversely, autophagy activation (rapamycin coincubation) sensitized cells to mito-ATTEC-induced mitochondrial depletion and subsequent cell death. A high autophagic index is a signicant mechanism of apoptosis resistance in melanomas.44,45 Patients with a high autophagic index showed reduced responsiveness to chemotherapy and experienced shorter survival rates when compared to those with a low autophagic index.46 The high autophagic index may sensitize melanoma cells to mito-ATTEC-induced mitochondrial depletion and autophagic cell death. Collectively, our current study represents proof of principle that anti-melanoma effects can be obtained through lethal mitophagy activation, and as such warrant further investigation."

More intriguingly, the sustained mitophagy leads to complete mitochondrial depletion and autophagy-dependent cell death in tumor cells (lethal mitophagy). Apoptosis-resistant malignant melanoma cell lines are even more sensitive to lethal mitophagy, and the therapeutic efficacy of mito-ATTECs has been further evaluated in subcutaneous and pulmonary metastatic melanoma models. Our results indicate that mito-ATTEC treatments lead to mitophagy hyperactivation and irreversible cell death in melanoma murine models with no adverse side effects. Therefore, targeting lethal mitophagy by mito-ATTECs provides a promising therapeutic paradigm for apoptosis-resistant tumors."
