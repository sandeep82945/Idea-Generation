    "abstractText": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the commonest primary glomerulonephritis, and a major cause of end-stage renal disease; however, its pathogenesis requires elucidation. Here, a hub gene, FABP1, and signaling pathway, PPAR\u03b1, were selected as key in IgAN pathogenesis by combined weighted gene correlation network analysis of clinical traits and identification of differentially expressed genes from three datasets. FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 levels were lower in IgAN than control kidney, and linearly positively correlated with one another, while FABP1 levels were negatively correlated with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and GPX4 levels were significantly decreased in IgAN. In human mesangial cells (HMCs), PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 levels were significantly decreased after Gd-IgA1 stimulation and mitochondria appeared structurally damaged, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased, and glutathione and GPX4 decreased, relative to controls. GPX4 levels were decreased, and those of ACSL4 increased on siPPAR\u03b1 and siFABP1 siRNA treatment. In PPAR\u03b1 lentivirus-transfected HMCs stimulated by Gd-IgA1, ROS, MDA, and ACSL4 were decreased; glutathione and GPX4, and immunofluorescence colocalization of PPAR\u03b1 and GPX4, increased; and damaged mitochondria reduced. Hence, PPAR\u03b1 pathway downregulation can reduce FABP1 expression, affecting GPX4 and ACSL4 levels, causing HMC ferroptosis, and contributing to IgAN pathogenesis.",

Here, a hub gene, FABP1, and signaling pathway, PPAR\u03b1, were selected as key in IgAN pathogenesis by combined weighted gene correlation network analysis of clinical traits and identification of differentially expressed genes from three datasets. FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 levels were lower in IgAN than control kidney, and linearly positively correlated with one another, while FABP1 levels were negatively correlated with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and GPX4 levels were significantly decreased in IgAN. In human mesangial cells (HMCs), PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 levels were significantly decreased after Gd-IgA1 stimulation and mitochondria appeared structurally damaged, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased, and glutathione and GPX4 decreased, relative to controls. GPX4 levels were decreased, and those of ACSL4 increased on siPPAR\u03b1 and siFABP1 siRNA treatment. In PPAR\u03b1 lentivirus-transfected HMCs stimulated by Gd-IgA1, ROS, MDA, and ACSL4 were decreased; glutathione and GPX4, and immunofluorescence colocalization of PPAR\u03b1 and GPX4, increased; and damaged mitochondria reduced. Hence, PPAR\u03b1 pathway downregulation can reduce FABP1 expression, affecting GPX4 and ACSL4 levels, causing HMC ferroptosis, and contributing to IgAN pathogenesis.\nKey words: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1, Fatty acid binding protein 1, Ferroptosis, Human mesangial cells, Weighted gene correlation network analysis"

            "text": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis globally, which is a major cause of end-stage renal disease [1, 2] . Moreover, approximately 30%\u201340% of kidney biopsies confirm IgAN, with frequencies in Asia ranging from 22% to 39%, which is higher than those observed in Europe [3, 4]. IgA-dominant immunoglobulin deposition in the glomerular mesangial area of the kidney is considered the main cause of IgAN; however, the specific pathogenesis underlying IgAN remains to be elucidated [5, 6]. It is established that accumulation of immune complexes, such as IgA1 and/or IgA1-IgG, in the\nglomerular mesangial area leads to IgAN kidney injury [1]. Generally, changes (upregulation or downregulation) in gene expression, can be reflected or observed at the histological level; hence, causes of kidney injury can be investigated by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatic analyses [7]. Therefore, we identified DEGs from IgAN datasets, then used weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze a dataset comprising clinical features of patients with IgAN, to screen for key factors related to urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Further, we used renal tissue samples from patients with IgAN and\nInt. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18\nhttps://www.ijbs.com\n5439\nhealthy controls to experimentally verify hub genes identified as involved in ACR by bioinformatics approaches. Moreover, we assessed the effects of the key genes and signaling pathways in human mesangial cells (HMCs) in vitro. The aim of this research was to identify key genes and signaling pathways related to IgAN clinical traits via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Finally, we identified the gene, FABP1, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, comprising PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3, as important in this context. PPAR\u03b1 levels are decreased in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rat model [8], and PPAR\u03b1 signaling is disrupted in aging kidney during accelerated renal fibrosis [9]. Therefore, we conducted further research on the PPAR\u03b1 signaling pathway. PPAR\u03b1 is a member of the PPAR family that functions as a nuclear transcription factor in fatty acid metabolism [10], and FABP1 is a downstream target gene in PPAR\u03b1 signaling that participates in fatty acid transport [11, 12]. Fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1, or FABPL, L-FABP) is a 14.4 kDa protein expressed in human proximal tubules that regulates the cellular uptake, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids [13]. Importantly, FABP1 has a protective role in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [14], and can decrease glomerular injury at the early stage of IgAN in animal experiments [15]. Ferroptosis is an important, newly-discovered form of cell death caused by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deficiency and associated with oxidation and iron dependence. A key feature of ferroptosis is the accumulation of lipid peroxides on cellular membranes, which distinguishes this type of cell death from the classical processes of necrosis, autophagy, and apoptosis [16, 17]. Ferroptosis participates in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases, including AKI [18], renal fibrosis [19], polycystic kidney disease [20], and diabetic nephropathy [21]. Ferroptosis occurrence is related to GPX4 consumption and increased production of ROS and other oxides. By contrast, increased cellular FABP1 is associated with decreased ROS production [12] and increased PPAR\u03b1 activity can suppress ferroptosis, while decreased PPAR\u03b1 activity increases sensitivity to ferroptosis; notably overexpression of PPAR\u03b1 can suppress ferroptotic cell death [22]. Nevertheless, the link between ferroptosis and IgAN remains unclear. Therefore, we used galactose deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), extracted from patients with IgAN, to stimulate HMCs and establish an IgAN model in vitro, then conducted various experiments to explore the effect of PPAR\u03b1 signaling and ferroptosis on HMCs."

As the major lesion in IgAN is in the glomerular mesangium, datasets related to glomeruli were selected for inclusion in this study, resulting in three included datasets, following exclusion of those from tubulointerstitium or peripheral blood, and those lacking controls. The design and workflow of this study are illustrated in Figure 1. First, the GEO datasets, GSE93798 [23], GSE37460[24], and GSE104948[25], comprising data from renal tissue from patients with IgAN and healthy controls, were screened for DEGs, then DEGs common among the datasets identified. Among the three datasets, GSE93798 contained 22 healthy controls and 20 patients with IgAN, GSE37460 had 9 healthy controls and 27 patients with IgAN, and there were 3 healthy controls and 27 patients with IgAN in GSE104948 (Supplementary Table S2). Hub genes were identified among downregulated DEGs using cytoHubba and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. WGCNA of the GSE93798 dataset was used to identify key factors related to ACR, then hub genes were selected using the threshold values: gene significance (GS) > 0.2 and module membership (MM) > 0.7. Finally, co-hub genes were identified based on the results of both analyses described above. Genes identified as significant were analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, to identify significantly enriched signaling pathways. Then, in vitro experiments were conducted using clinical specimens from patient with IgAN and controls, as well as HMCs, to verify the hub genes and signaling pathways identified by bioinformatics and explore the role of ferroptosis in IgAN."

We detected 347 DEGs, including 243 upregulated and 104 downregulated genes, in the GSE93798 dataset (Supplementary Table S6); 181 DEGs were identified in the GSE37460 dataset, including 104 upregulated and 77 downregulated genes (Supplementary Table S7); and we identified 199 DEGs in GSE104948, including 138 upregulated and 61 downregulated genes (Supplementary Table S8). The expression levels of all DEGs in the three datasets are presented as volcano plots in Figure 2A\u2013C, and the top 50 DEGs in the three datasets were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and the results illustrated as heatmaps (Fig. 2D\u2013F). A search for DEGs common to the three datasets identified 16 upregulated and 14 downregulated DEGs (Fig. 2G\u2013H and Table 1).\nIdentification of hub genes using violin plot and ROC curve analysis\nPPI modules of the 14 downregulated DEGs were identified using the Stress, Betweenness, Radiality, and Degree algorithms in cytoHubba (Fig. 3A\u2013D) (Supplementary Table S9). After removing batch effects of the original expression matrix on the five hub genes, a violin plot was generated illustrating overall differences in expression (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig. S2, Supplementary Table S10). To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the five hub genes for diagnosing IgAN, area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were calculated (Fig. 3F\u2013G, Table 2). Further, we assessed the AUC values of the five hub genes in the GSE93798 dataset, with consistent results.\nIdentification of key modules associated with clinical features by WGCNA\nIn this study, 17 samples and related clinical data were selected for WGCNA (Fig. 4A). After preliminary processing, 5000 genes associated with IgAN were screened for further analysis and a scale-free network generated using \u03b2 = 9 (scale-free R2 = 0.96) as the soft-threshold (Fig. 4B, C). Based on the merged dynamic tree cut, we identified nine gene\nco-expression modules (Fig. 4D).\nthat each module verified others in the network TOM heatmap plot (Fig. 4E). Further, we found that a module colored turquoise showed the highest correlation with ACR, and contained FABP1 (R2 = 0.42, P = 0.09; Fig. 4F; Supplementary Fig. S3A); therefore, we considered this module significant. GS and MM values for genes in the turquoise module with clinical traits of patients with IgAN are presented as scatterplots; the correlation coefficient of GS value for ACR was 0.26 (P = 7.7e\u221218; Fig. 5A). Further, FABP1 had very high MM and GS values for ACR (MM = 0.76 and GS = 0.30) (Supplementary Table S11). More importantly, FABP1 has been identify patients at risk of developing kidney diseases, including AKI and CKD, and to protect the kidneys in the course of kidney disease, as detailed in our previously published review [14]; hence, we considered FABP1 as a hub gene in the turquoise module. The expression of genes in the turquoise module is illustrated as a heatmap and bar graph (Fig. 5B)."

Compared with those in healthy controls, levels of FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 were\ndecreased in IgAN samples (Fig. 6A\u2013C). Further, we found that the decrease in FABP1 expression level was linearly positively correlated with PPAR\u03b1 expression level (r = 0.9198, R2 = 0.8361, 95% CI: 0.8248\u20131.015), revealing that decreased PPAR\u03b1 protein levels lead to decreased FABP1 expression level (Fig. 6D). Moreover, FABP1 levels in IgAN renal\nInt. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18\nhttps://www.ijbs.com\n5449\ntissue were negatively correlated with those of ACR (r = \u20130.8487, R2 = 0.7202, 95% CI: \u20130.9019 to \u20130.7700), and levels of PPAR\u03b1 in IgAN renal tissue were also negatively correlated with ACR levels (r = \u20130.8853, R2 = 0.7838, 95% CI: \u20130.9262 to \u20130.8239), indicating that kidney dysfunction in IgAN is associated with decreased levels of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 (Fig. 6E, F).\nmarker, GPX4, in kidney tissue specimens indicated that its protein levels were significantly lower in IgAN renal tissue than in healthy control samples (Fig. 6G, H), indicating that ferroptosis participates in the occurrence of IgAN.\nGd-IgA1 stimulation of HMCs to induce ferroptosis\nThe ferroptosis inducer, erastin, was used to stimulate HMCs, and led to significantly decreased cell viability when applied at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 7A). After intervention with the ferroptosis specific inhibitor, Fer-1, for 12 h prior to erastin treatment, HMC viability increased, levels of ROS and MDA decreased, and those of GSH increased (Fig. 7B\u2013E), indicating the occurrence of ferroptosis in HMCs. Next, we used HMCs to establish an in vitro IgAN model by stimulating cells with different concentrations (1 \u03bcg/mL, 10 \u03bcg/mL, 100 \u03bcg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL) of Gd-IgA1 for 24 h. We found that cell viability decreased significantly following treatment with 1 mg/mL Gd-IgA1 (Fig. 7F) and that addition of Fer-1 led to significantly decreased ROS and MDA levels (Fig. 7G, I), while those of GSH increased significantly (Fig. 7H), relative to the Gd-IgA1 group. Further, expression levels of the ferroptosis marker, GPX4, were significantly decreased relative to the control group after stimulation of HMCs with Gd-IgA1 (Fig. 7J, K). TEM analysis showed that mitochondrial structure was significantly damaged in HMCs\nstimulated with Gd-IgA1, with mitochondrial damage scores significantly higher than those in control group cells, while damage was decreased after treatment with Fer-1 (Fig. 7L, M). These results suggest that Gd-IgA1 stimulation can cause ferroptosis in HMCs.\nGd-IgA1 leads to ferroptosis in HMCs by inhibiting PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 expression\nLevels of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 were significantly decreased in HMCs stimulated with Gd-IgA1 (1 mg/mL for 24 h) (Fig. 8A\u2013E). After stimulation with Gd-IgA1 and treatment with siPPAR and siFABP1, HMC viability was significantly decreased and ROS was significantly increased, while Fer-1 increased HMC viability and reduced ROS levels (Fig. 8F, G). After transfection of HMCs with PPAR\u03b1 lentivirus for 48 h, and stimulation with Gd-IgA1 for 24 h, we observed that PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 8H\u2013L). Further, TEM showed that mitochondrial structure was relatively intact in HMCs overexpressing PPAR\u03b1, with reduced levels of mitochondrial damage (Fig. 8M, N). In addition, evaluation of ROS, GSH, and MDA oxide levels, which are related to the occurrence of ferroptosis, demonstrated that ROS and MDA levels were decreased (Fig. 8O, Q), while those of GSH were increased (Fig. 8P) after lentiviral overexpression of PPAR\u03b1. These results suggest that Gd-IgA1 causes ferroptosis in HMCs by inhibiting PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 expression.\nPPAR\u03b1 mediates FABP1 regulation of GPX4 and ACSL4, influencing the occurrence of ferroptosis in HMCs\nAfter intervention with siPPAR\u03b1, immunofluorescence colocalization analysis showed that PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 expression levels were decreased (Fig. 9A, B), and PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 9C). These results indicate that downregulation of PPAR\u03b1 mediated a decrease in FABP1 levels. To evaluate the effects of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 on ferroptosis, HMCs were pre-transfected with overexpression plasmids or siRNA for 48 h prior to Gd-IgA1 stimulation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the key regulatory genes related to ferroptosis, GPX4 and ACSL4, were then detected, and co-expression of PPAR\u03b1 and GPX4 evaluated by immunofluorescence colocalization. The results showed that GPX4 expression levels were decreased, while those of ACSL4 increased, following treatment with siPPAR\u03b1 and siFABP1 (Fig. 9D\u2013H). Further, on lentiviral overexpression of PPAR\u03b1, GPX4 levels were increased and expression of ACSL4 decreased (Fig.\nInt. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18\nhttps://www.ijbs.com\n5450\n9I\u2013M), while immunofluorescence colocalization analysis showed that PPAR\u03b1 and GPX4 expression levels were increased (Fig. 9N, O). GPX4 is a marker protein of ferroptosis inhibition, while ACSL4\npromotes ferroptosis. Overall, our findings indicate that PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 regulate GPX4 and ACSL4 to influence the occurrence of ferroptosis in HMCs.\nInt. J. Biol.

            "text": "In this study, we conducted comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets to identify genes and signaling pathways closely related to IgAN clinical traits. Although these datasets have been studied in previous research, we also conducted laboratory validation studies, using renal specimens from patients with IgAN, as well as in vitro experiments using HMCs. Preliminary screening of DEGs from the GSE93798, GSE104948, and GSE37460 datasets identified 14 common downregulated DEGs (Fig. 2G, Table 1). Four algorithms in the Cytoscape\nplugin, cytoHubba, were then applied to select five key genes for each algorithm, and we found that FABP1 always ranked among the top 4 downregulated genes (Fig. 3A\u2013D). Subsequent violin plot and ROC curve analyses confirmed identification of 5 key genes: FABP1, PCK1, ALB, PAH, and G6PC (Fig. 3F, G and Table 2). ALB is a major intravascular antioxidant that can protect kidneys [34]. PCK1 has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its identification makes intuitive sense, as the enzyme it encodes, PEPCK-C, is a key gluconeogenic enzyme in liver and kidney [35]. G6PC is a key enzyme involved in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis between\nInt. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18\nhttps://www.ijbs.com\n5455\nmeals, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6phosphate (G6P) to glucose and phosphate in the terminal step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis [36, 37]. PAH catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and PAH deficiency causes hyperphenylalaninemia, which leads to severe mental retardation in the classical form of the disease, phenylketonuria (PKU)[38, 39]. A literature review regarding the ability of FABP1 to identify patients at risk of developing kidney diseases, including AKI and CKD, and to protect the kidneys in the course of kidney disease, has been published [14]. WGCNA of the GSE93798 dataset identified a turquoise module associated with ACR, with FABP1 the gene in this module with the strongest correlation with ACR. We also found that the PPAR signaling pathway was associated with FABP1 regulation; therefore, we considered FABP1 as a hub gene and conducted further research into its function in this study. Fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1, or FABPL, L-FABP) is a 14.4 kDa protein expressed in human proximal tubules that regulates the cellular uptake, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids [13, 40]. Importantly, FABP1 has a protective role against AKI and CKD during the course of kidney disease [14]. PPAR\u03b1 is a transcription factor in the PPAR signaling pathway, and FABP1 is a downstream target gene in this pathway [11, 41]. Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) is a member of the PPAR family, which functions as a nuclear transcription factor involved in fatty acid metabolism [10, 42]. One study found PPAR\u03b1 levels are decreased in a UUO rat model [8], while another investigation showed damaged PPAR\u03b1 signaling in aging kidney during accelerated renal fibrosis [9]. In our study, we analyzed renal tissue samples from patients with IgAN and healthy control subjects to explore the clinical relevance of our bioinformatics findings (Table 5). Levels of FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 were lower in IgAN samples than those from healthy controls (Fig. 6A\u2013C). Further, we found that decreased FABP1 expression levels were linearly positively correlated with those of PPAR\u03b1, suggesting that decreased PPAR\u03b1 pathway protein expression levels lead to reduced FABP1 expression (Fig. 6D). Moreover, FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 levels in renal tissues from patients with IgAN were negatively correlated with ACR level (Fig. 6E, F), indicating that reduction of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 in the kidney is involved in the dysfunction observed in IgAN. Multiple molecular mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of IgAN, with the central mechanism underlying IgAN the accumulation of nephritogenic immune complexes in the glomerular mesangial area, leading to irreversible kidney damage in the form of\nsegmental or global glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis [43]. In this study, we used Gd-IgA1 extracted from the peripheral blood of patients with IgAN to stimulate HMCs and establish an in vitro IgAN model, and found that ferroptosis could be induced by treatment of HMCs with erastin. Further, our data show that Gd-IgA1 treatment clearly decreased HMC viability (Fig. 7F) and GSH levels, while significantly increasing ROS and MDA levels (Fig. 7G, I), and significantly decreasing the expression level of the ferroptosis marker, GPX4. When the specific inhibitor of ferroptosis, Fer-1, was added to HMCs before Gd-IgA1 stimulation, cell viability and GSH levels were increased, while ROS and MDA were decreased, relative to the Gd-IgA1-treated group. Further, TEM showed that mitochondrial structure was significantly damaged in HMCs stimulated by Gd-IgA1, with mitochondrial damage scores significantly higher than those of the control group (Fig. 7L\u2013M), while Fer-1 reduced mitochondrial damage. Ferroptosis is involved in the occurrence of various kidney diseases, including AKI [18], renal fibrosis [19], polycystic kidney disease [20], and diabetic nephropathy [21]; however, the effect of ferroptosis in IgAN was previously unclear. Here, we found that GPX4 protein levels were significantly reduced in renal tissue from patients with IgAN (Fig. 6G, H), indicating that ferroptosis may participate in the occurrence of IgAN. Our results indicate that Gd-IgA1 may cause ferroptosis of HMCs, contributing to IgAN. In this study, we observed that FABP1 and PPAR\u03b1 levels were significantly decreased in IgAN renal tissue relative to those in healthy renal samples (Fig. 6A\u2013C), and their levels were correlated with ACR (Fig. 6E, F). Increased PPAR\u03b1 activity can suppress ferroptosis, while decreased PPAR\u03b1 activity increased sensitivity to ferroptosis and, notably, overexpression of PPAR\u03b1 can suppress ferroptotic death [22]. Further, there is evidence that, when FABP1 increases in cells, ROS production decreases [12]. In our in vitro IgAN model, established by Gd-IgA1 stimulation of HMCs, we found that PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased, consistent with the results of our bioinformatics analyses (Fig. 8A\u2013E). To explore the effect of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 expression levels on ferroptosis in HMCs, we intervened using small interfering RNA and lentivirus overexpression treatment, followed by stimulation with Gd-IgA1. Treatment with siPPAR\u03b1 and siFABP1 reduced cell viability and significantly increased ROS levels, while treatment with Fer-1 could correct the decreased cell viability and reduce ROS levels. These results indicate that decreased PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 expression may be\nInt. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18\nhttps://www.ijbs.com\n5456\nrelated to ferroptosis induced by Gd-IgA1 stimulation in HMCs. Further, on PPAR\u03b1 overexpression, ROS levels decreased (Fig. 8O), GSH levels increased (Fig. 8Q), and MDA level decreased (Fig. 8P), while TEM showed that mitochondrial structure of HMCs was relatively complete and clear (Fig. 8M), with mitochondrial damage levels reduced (Fig. 8N), suggesting that PPAR\u03b1 overexpression can decrease ferroptosis. Further, after intervention with siPPAR\u03b1, immunofluorescence colocalization analysis showed that PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 protein expression levels were decreased (Fig. 9A, B), while PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 mRNA levels were also significantly decreased (Fig. 9C). These results indicate that downregulation PPAR\u03b1 influences FABP1 levels. A previous study found that inhibition of FABP1 expression can improve NAFLD-related damage [44], indicating that FABP1 may play a protective role. In our study, we found that FBAP1 levels were decreased in IgAN tissues and HMCs after stimulation with Gd-IgA1, indicating that downregulation of FABP1 is related to the occurrence of IgAN. Based on the above results, we conclude that Gd-IgA1 leads to ferroptosis in HMCs by inhibiting PPAR\u03b1-mediated FABP1 expression. Ferroptosis can be triggered by a reduction or inhibition of GPX4 protein levels and GPX4 specifically scavenges lipid peroxides on membrane phospholipids, and is an essential negative regulator of ferroptosis [45, 46]. Dixon [47] found that long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 have important roles in PUFA-containing phospholipid biosynthesis, which is key to the occurrence of ferroptosis. To explore the effects of PPAR\u03b1 and FABP1 on ferroptosis, HMCs were pre-transfected with overexpression plasmid or siRNA for 48 h prior to Gd-IgA1 stimulation, with siPPAR\u03b1 and siFABP1 treatment resulting in significantly decreased GPX4 levels and increased ACSL4 (Fig. 9D\u2013H). Further, expression levels of the key ferroptosis gene, GPX4, were increased, while those of ACSL4 were decreased after PPAR\u03b1 overexpression in HMCs. Immunofluorescence colocalization analysis showed that FABP1 and GPX4 levels were increased after lentivirus transfection (Fig. 9N, O). In experiments involving folic acid-induced AKI, Martin-Sanchez [48] found that Fer-1 can specifically and significantly improve the renal function of mice, reduce intracellular lipid peroxidation, and reduce renal tubular epithelium cell damage and death. Further, levels of erastin-induced ferroptosis were significantly reduced after ACSL4 knockdown, while ACSL4 overexpression in ACSL4-negative cells promoted ferroptosis [49]. Therefore, phospholipid\nperoxides produced through the ACSL4 pathway are considered executors of ferroptosis. Hence, we consider that downregulation of PPAR\u03b1 may decrease FABP1 and GPX4 expression levels, and increase those of ACSL4, leading ferroptosis."
