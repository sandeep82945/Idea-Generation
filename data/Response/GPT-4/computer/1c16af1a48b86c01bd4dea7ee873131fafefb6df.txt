Generalization of RCE Across Different Databases and Configurations: Future research could explore how the Row Count Evolution (RCE) technique generalizes across a variety of database systems beyond PostgreSQL, including NoSQL databases or cloud-native databases. Investigating the performance in different index configurations and database schemas can also reveal insights into RCE's adaptability and efficiency across diverse environments.

Advanced Model Architectures for Plan Prediction: While Kepler utilizes Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) for plan prediction, exploring other advanced machine learning and deep learning architectures could provide further improvements. Research into transformers, graph neural networks, or other state-of-the-art techniques specifically tailored to capture the relational and structural nuances of query plans could yield more accurate and robust plan predictions.

Efficient Training Data Collection Strategies: The paper highlights the significant computational cost associated with training data collection. Research focusing on efficient data collection methods, such as active learning, few-shot learning, or synthetic data generation, could reduce the computational overhead. This research direction would be crucial for Kepler's practical deployment, especially in dynamically changing environments where frequent retraining may be necessary.

Adaptation to Dynamic Data Distributions and Workloads: Kepler assumes relatively static workloads and data distributions. Future work could focus on enhancing Kepler to adapt to dynamic environments where data distributions and query patterns change over time. Techniques for incremental learning, online learning, and detecting distribution shifts could be integrated to maintain or improve query performance without full retraining.

Integration with Database Management System Internals: Deepening the integration of learning-based PQO techniques like Kepler into the internals of database management systems could open new optimization avenues. Research could focus on modifying database engines to natively support machine learning-based optimizations, leveraging internal metrics and signals for better prediction accuracy, and dynamically adjusting strategies based on real-time performance feedback. This could also include the development of new database features or extensions that specifically support or enhance the capabilities of learning-based query optimization.
