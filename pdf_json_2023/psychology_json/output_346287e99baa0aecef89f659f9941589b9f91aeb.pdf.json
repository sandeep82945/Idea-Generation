This method employing a ball mill is amenable to typical simple copper(I)/NHC complexes but also to a sophisticated copper(I)/N-heterocyclic carbene complex bearing a guanidine moiety. In this way, the present approach circumvents commonly employed silver(I) complexes which are associated with significant and undesired waste formation and the excessive use of solvents. The resulting bifunctional catalyst has been shown to be active in a variety of reduction/hydrogenation transformations employing dihydrogen as terminal reducing agent. Introduction Prominent goals of green chemistry heralded for synthetic chemistry are minimization or ideally the complete prevention of chemical waste. In this vein, the use of innocuous chemicals, replacement of hazardous reagents, atom efficient reactions and overall safer chemical processes are desirable [1,2]. Therefore, one current challenge for syntheses is the development of green and environmentally friendly routes to access value-added products. One important way to more economical syntheses is the concept of catalysis to avoid stoichiometric amounts of reactants and to design reactions more atom efficient [1-3]. However, the focus has seldomly been on the preparative methods to access the required catalysts themselves. As case in point, we decided to re-investigate the synthesis of copper(I)/N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes, which are broadly applicable catalysts for a wide variety of transformations [4-6]. While generally there are many different synthetic routes to transition metal/NHC complexes [7-15] not all of them are applicable to the preparation of copper(I)/NHC compounds (Scheme 1) [5,6,13,16-19]. Generally, the so-called direct routes via the appropriate imidazol(in)ium salt, a copper precursor and a suitably strong Beilstein J. Org.

Scheme 1: General synthetic routes to copper(I)/NHC complexes (X = Cl, Br). base (e.g., NaH, NaOt-Bu, KHMDS or n-BuLi) [20-26] are challenging for copper complexes 2 as they tend to give low yields (Scheme 1a) [5,6,13,16-19]. One elegant protocol employing K2CO3 as weak base in combination with copper(I) salts for simple copper(I)/NHC complexes has been disclosed (Scheme 1b) [27]. While this variant is the method of choice due to its simplicity and practicability, other alternatives have to be sought in cases where these direct synthesis approaches fail: On the one hand, the so-called \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d route relies on the use of Cu2O which can be directly reacted with a suitable NHC precursor 1 (Scheme 1c) [28]. In any case, the most common approach hinges upon the use of the preliminary preparation of an intermediate silver(I)/NHC complex followed by facile transmetallation to copper(I) (Scheme 1d). In some cases, this transmetallation step is carried out in situ [14,15,29-32]. Notably, these generally successful synthetic routes produce a considerable amount of transition metal waste (next to the inherent use of solvents) and are therefore in misalignment with the principles of green chemistry. Syntheses via mechanochemical methods offer elegant and atom-economic alternatives to liquid state synthesis approaches [33-43]. In accordance with the in situ transmetallation route in liquid state synthesis, a one-pot two-step procedure in a ball mill was discovered (Scheme 1e) [44]. The possibility of synthesizing copper(I)/NHC complexes in the ball mill is promising due to the avoidance of organic solvents. Direct approaches from the NHC-precursor to the copper(I)/NHC complex not undergoing the transmetallation step have been disclosed (Scheme 1f) [45-47]. These approaches are an elegant alternative to the transmetallation route performing without unwanted transition metal waste. Two possible direct mechanochemical pathways have been presented for the synthesis of copper(I)/NHC complexes: First, the complexes can be synthesized by milling the ligand precursor 1 with metallic copper powder in air [45]. Another mechanochemical pathway was published using K2CO3 as a base and copper(I) chloride [46,47]. This latter procedure is practical, avoids the use of solvents, and relies on an abundant and cheap base. We have recently disclosed an ester reduction with H2 as terminal reducing agent utilizing bifunctional copper(I)/NHC complex 5 bearing a guanidine moiety as additional catalytic unit [48]. This catalyst acts by employing the copper(I)/NHC complex for H2 activation on the one hand and by using the guanidine subunit for simultaneous organocatalytic activation of the ester on the other hand. Following a previously established synthetic pathway [49], we have found that transmetallation via silver(I)/NHC complex 4 was the only viable synthetic entry point to this sophisticated bifunctional catalyst (Scheme 2) Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2023, 19, 440\u2013447. 442 Table 1: Attempted direct synthesis of bifunctional catalyst 5 from imidazolinium salt 3: liquid and solid state approaches.

First, the silver(I)/NHC complex 4 had to be synthesized and isolated prior to transmetallation with copper(I) chloride [48,49]. The required formation of silver(I) complex 4 diminishes the overall yield of copper complex 5. As an additional disadvantage, the silver(I) byproducts have to be carefully removed in order to maintain reproducible results in subsequent catalytic hydrogenations [48]. We deemed this synthetic route unattractive with regards to sustainable synthesis due to the silver waste generated in the process and sought to replace the transmetallation route with a more atom economic approach to circumvent these problems. Results and Discussion We therefore examined different approaches to avoid the transmetallation step (4\u21925) and to establish a protocol for the direct synthesis of 5 in solution from imidazolium salt 3 (Table 1, liquid state approaches) [48]. The use of strong bases such as n-BuLi or NaOt-Bu (in various equivalents, Table 1, entries 1 and 2) or weak bases (Et3N, K2CO3 or K3PO4, Table 1, entries 3\u20135) either did give no conversion to 5 at all or delivered a catalytically inactive complex, which we assign to a CO2 adduct of 5 (Table 1, entry 4) [51,52]. We hypothesize that in this CO2 adduct, the guanidine moiety is unavailable to perform its Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2023, 19, 440\u2013447. 443 assisting part in catalysis through hydrogen-bonding interaction [48]. As additional evidence to support the formation of the CO2 adduct of 5, we can show that bubbling of CO2 through a solution of 5 leads to catalytically inactive complexes (see Supporting Information File 1 for details). This also supports the notion that during catalytic ester hydrogenation, the guanidinium moiety acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the esters [48]. The formation of a CO2 adduct hinders the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, utilizing Cu2O for a \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d approach did not give complex 5 (Table 1, entry 6). Since our attempts to establish direct synthetic routes to 5 from 3 in liquid state were not fruitful, we turned our attention to the mechanochemical synthesis of bifunctional catalyst 5, based on two recent reports on preparation of copper(I)/NHC complexes [45,47]. All mechanochemical syntheses were carried out in a planetary ball mill and the vessel was loaded in an argon-filled glovebox. Copper(I) chloride, imidazolium salt 3 and the appropriate base were mixed (in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.0:1.5, respectively) and ground for 4 hours. Afterwards purification included dissolving the crude product in CH2Cl2, filtration over a PTFE syringe filter and concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure. Employing strong bases such as KHMDS, NaOt-Bu or NaOH did not lead to the desired product (Table 1, entries 7\u20139). All three approaches have in common that the conjugated acid of the added base is a liquid. In the literature, the improvement of mechanochemical syntheses by addition of small amounts of a liquid have been reported (LAG, liquid-assisted grinding) [43]. However, in our case, the formation of small amounts of liquid during the milling process lead to agglutination of the remaining solids and therefore insufficient homogenization of the reaction mixture. This gave a mixture of compounds, in which the envisaged complex 5 could not be identified. A different approach was made using sodium hydride as a base (Table 1, entry 10). Instead of small amounts of liquid, here, deprotonation leads to the formation of dihydrogen. Hence, another gastight mill was utilized for this approach. Unfortunately, a successful synthesis of 5 directly from 3 was not possible under these conditions: NMR analysis of the resulting mixture indicated the presence of 5, but also of unwanted sideproducts that could not be identified. Purification of 5 from this complex mixture turned out not to be feasible. Further modifications of the milling conditions did not lead to the elimination of these side-products, therefore the experiments with NaH as a base were discontinued. As a side comment, the addition of no base at all led to the formation of the imidazolinium cuprate ([3][CuClBr]\u2212, Table 1, entry 11) [46]. The direct transition of the \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d approach conditions to mechanochemical synthesis (copper(I) oxide and imidazolium salt 3 as starting materials), lead to no formation of 5 (Table 1, entry 12). The use of K2CO3 for the mechanochemical synthesis of copper(I)/NHC complexes [46,47] was feasible for the preparation of 5 (Table 1, entry 13). Importantly, we found that extending on this concept also K3PO4 could be employed equally well while giving significantly higher yields than the previous protocol [46,47] (Table 1, entry 14). All of the approaches discussed here are attractive due to the use of copper(I) chloride as the copper source. Interestingly, the use of K2CO3, which led to the formation of a catalytically inactive postulated CO2 adduct of 5 in the liquid state synthesis, did lead to catalytically active 5 in the mechanochemical approach. In a similar vein, the different outcome with K3PO4 as a base (which led to no catalytically active complexes in the liquid state synthesis) was surprising, as in the ball mill, clean and catalytically active copper(I) complex 5 was obtained. To avoid the possible formation of the catalytically inactive CO2 adduct when employing K2CO3 for the synthesis of 5 we decided to use K3PO4 for subsequent investigations (see also below, Table 2). Even though the imidazolium bromide salt 3 was employed in combination with CuCl as copper(I) precursor, elemental analysis of 5 clearly supported the formation of 5 as a chloride salt (see Supporting Information File 1). For the optimized protocol, the starting materials were mixed in a steel vessel and ground at 450 rpm for a total time of four hours. After ball milling, an off-white powder was obtained which gave complex 5 in very good yield of 91% after extraction with CH2Cl2 and filtration. NMR analysis of 5 matched previously reported data [48,49] and showed no side products. It has to be mentioned that complex 5 synthesized via the mechanochemical route is isolated as a CH2Cl2 adduct (5/CH2Cl2 = 1:1) as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. If complex 5 is formed via the liquid state synthesis [48,49], also a CH2Cl2 adduct is isolated, albeit with a 5/CH2Cl2 ratio of 2:1. In order to demonstrate the general applicability of the K3PO4based protocol for the mechanochemical synthesis of copper(I)/ NHC complexes, we decided to prepare the most common copper(I)/NHC complexes 7a\u2013d [5,6] employing our method (Table 2). When the corresponding imidazoli(ni)um salts 6a\u2013d were submitted to the standard protocol, complexes 7a\u2013d were obtained with acceptable yields, with similar yields compared to previous methods. In some cases, the homoleptic cationic copper(I) complexes [(NHC)2Cu]CuCl2 were observed as side products [48,53]. Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2023, 19, 440\u2013447. 444 Table 2: Synthesis of standard Cu(I)/NHC-complexes using K3PO4 as a weak base (standard procedure: steel vessel (12 mL), 6 steel balls (1 cm diameter), 450 rpm, 4 h).

We found that 5bm was catalytically active, however displaying slightly diminished activity in general most likely due to different adduct ratio inhibiting the catalytic activity (Scheme 3). This was established using the standard reactions for catalytic hydrogenations with copper(I)/NHC complexes [4]. In this vein, we tested complex 5 from solid and liquid phase synthesis in the catalytic hydrogenation of esters, carbonyl compounds and in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. In the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl benzoate (8) lower overall conversion to benzyl alcohol (9) and lower yield was found with 5bm (65% conv. and 53% yield with 5bm, in comparison to 100% conv. and 80% yield with 5ls; Scheme 3a). We hypothesize that the higher amount of CH2Cl2 as part of the prepared complex, which is not a suitable solvent for catalytic ester reduction with H2 [48], led to lower catalyst activity. Possible coordination of residual phosphate to the guanidine moiety was excluded as analysis by 31P NMR experiments. The copper(I)catalyzed 1,2-reduction of functionalized ester 10 was also successfully achieved using the ball mill synthesized bifunctional catalyst 5bm, again with slightly diminished yields and conversions. Application of the ball mill-synthesized complex 5bm in the alkyne semihydrogenation of tolane (12) gave (Z)-stilbene (13) with full stereoselectivity in good yield (86%, Scheme 3b). Noteworthy, the complex 5 was never evaluated in this reported reaction. Therefore, 5bm behaves similarly to other copper(I)/NHC complexes in this transformation [54-60]. The catalytic 1,2-reduction of carbonyl compounds is mainstay for copper(I)/NHC complexes [61-67], which is why we also tested 5bm in these transformations: The 1,2-reduction of benzaldehyde (14) and acetophenone (15) proceeded with good yields Scheme 3: Application of bifunctional catalyst 5 in copper(I)-catalyzed hydrogenations: comparison of 5 prepared by solid state/ball milling (5bm) and liquid state (5ls) synthesis.

Chem. 2023, 19, 440\u2013447. 445 (Scheme 3c). No aldol addition for the acetophenone substrate has been observed although working under strongly basic conditions [68,69]. Conclusion In conclusion, we have disclosed a practical approach to a sophisticated bifunctional copper(I)/NHC complex based on a mechanochemical protocol. This operationally simple synthetic route circumvents the previously necessary use of surplus transition metal reagents and therefore diminishes unwanted waste formation. The new protocol presented here is based on K3PO4 and has successfully displayed the activity of the resulting catalyst in a variety of hydrogenative transformations. We show that the new protocol is also amenable to the synthesis of other standard copper(I)/NHC complexes. Our results do not only add to the wide area of applications of mechanochemical synthesis but also showcase that transition metal complexes bearing additional functional groups can be prepared with a ball milling synthesis. We think that our protocol could be useful for the atom economic preparation of other complex catalysts, which are difficult or wasteful to be prepared by typical liquid state synthesis methods. Experimental Mechanochemical synthesis procedure for 5: The product was synthesized using a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 classic line, a highenergy planetary ball mill. The starting materials 1-(2-(2,3diisopropyl-1-methylguanidino)ethyl)-3-mesityl-1H-imidazol3-ium bromide (3, 75 mg, 0.16 mmol, 1.0 equiv), CuCl (17 mg, 0.16 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and K3PO4 (53 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1.5 equiv) were filled into a 12 mL steel vessel equipped with six steel balls (1 cm diameter). The beaker was sealed in an argon-filled glovebox. Milling was carried out with 450 rpm for a total of four hours. After each hour the milling was paused for 30 minutes to avoid overheating of the machine. The raw product was obtained as an off-white powder after milling. The ground product was mixed with CH2Cl2 (3 mL) and the resulting suspension was filtered over a PTFE syringe filter (0.45 \u03bcm). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The product 5 was obtained as the CH2Cl2 adduct as a colourless solid (86 mg, 0.15 mmol, 91%).

One elegant protocol employing K2CO3 as weak base in combination with copper(I) salts for simple copper(I)/NHC complexes has been disclosed (Scheme 1b) [27]. While this variant is the method of choice due to its simplicity and practicability, other alternatives have to be sought in cases where these direct synthesis approaches fail: On the one hand, the so-called \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d route relies on the use of Cu2O which can be directly reacted with a suitable NHC precursor 1 (Scheme 1c) [28]. In any case, the most common approach hinges upon the use of the preliminary preparation of an intermediate silver(I)/NHC complex followed by facile transmetallation to copper(I) (Scheme 1d). In some cases, this transmetallation step is carried out in situ [14,15,29-32]. Notably, these generally successful synthetic routes produce a considerable amount of transition metal waste (next to the inherent use of solvents) and are therefore in misalignment with the principles of green chemistry.\nSyntheses via mechanochemical methods offer elegant and atom-economic alternatives to liquid state synthesis approaches [33-43]. In accordance with the in situ transmetallation route in liquid state synthesis, a one-pot two-step procedure in a ball mill was discovered (Scheme 1e) [44]. The possibility of synthesizing copper(I)/NHC complexes in the ball mill is promising due to the avoidance of organic solvents. Direct approaches from the NHC-precursor to the copper(I)/NHC complex not undergoing the transmetallation step have been disclosed (Scheme 1f) [45-47]. These approaches are an elegant alternative to the transmetallation route performing without unwanted transition metal waste. Two possible direct mechanochemical pathways have been presented for the synthesis of copper(I)/NHC complexes: First, the complexes can be synthesized by milling the ligand precursor 1 with metallic copper powder in air [45]. Another mechanochemical pathway was published using K2CO3 as a base and copper(I) chloride [46,47]. This latter procedure is practical, avoids the use of solvents, and relies on an abundant and cheap base.\nWe have recently disclosed an ester reduction with H2 as terminal reducing agent utilizing bifunctional copper(I)/NHC complex 5 bearing a guanidine moiety as additional catalytic unit [48]. This catalyst acts by employing the copper(I)/NHC complex for H2 activation on the one hand and by using the guanidine subunit for simultaneous organocatalytic activation of the ester on the other hand. Following a previously established synthetic pathway [49], we have found that transmetallation via silver(I)/NHC complex 4 was the only viable synthetic entry point to this sophisticated bifunctional catalyst (Scheme 2)\n[10,12,14,50]. First, the silver(I)/NHC complex 4 had to be synthesized and isolated prior to transmetallation with copper(I) chloride [48,49]. The required formation of silver(I) complex 4 diminishes the overall yield of copper complex 5. As an additional disadvantage, the silver(I) byproducts have to be carefully removed in order to maintain reproducible results in subsequent catalytic hydrogenations [48]. We deemed this synthetic route unattractive with regards to sustainable synthesis due to the silver waste generated in the process and sought to replace the transmetallation route with a more atom economic approach to circumvent these problems. Results and Discussion We therefore examined different approaches to avoid the transmetallation step (4\u21925) and to establish a protocol for the direct synthesis of 5 in solution from imidazolium salt 3 (Table 1, liquid state approaches) [48]. The use of strong bases such as n-BuLi or NaOt-Bu (in various equivalents, Table 1, entries 1 and 2) or weak bases (Et3N, K2CO3 or K3PO4, Table 1, entries 3\u20135) either did give no conversion to 5 at all or delivered a catalytically inactive complex, which we assign to a CO2 adduct of 5 (Table 1, entry 4) [51,52]. We hypothesize that in this CO2 adduct, the guanidine moiety is unavailable to perform its\nassisting part in catalysis through hydrogen-bonding interaction [48]. As additional evidence to support the formation of the CO2 adduct of 5, we can show that bubbling of CO2 through a solution of 5 leads to catalytically inactive complexes (see Supporting Information File 1 for details). This also supports the notion that during catalytic ester hydrogenation, the guanidinium moiety acts as a hydrogen bond donor to the esters [48]. The formation of a CO2 adduct hinders the ability to form hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, utilizing Cu2O for a \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d approach did not give complex 5 (Table 1, entry 6).\nSince our attempts to establish direct synthetic routes to 5 from 3 in liquid state were not fruitful, we turned our attention to the mechanochemical synthesis of bifunctional catalyst 5, based on two recent reports on preparation of copper(I)/NHC complexes [45,47].\nAll mechanochemical syntheses were carried out in a planetary ball mill and the vessel was loaded in an argon-filled glovebox. Copper(I) chloride, imidazolium salt 3 and the appropriate base were mixed (in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.0:1.5, respectively) and ground for 4 hours. Afterwards purification included dissolving the crude product in CH2Cl2, filtration over a PTFE syringe filter and concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure. Employing strong bases such as KHMDS, NaOt-Bu or NaOH did not lead to the desired product (Table 1, entries 7\u20139). All three approaches have in common that the conjugated acid of the added base is a liquid. In the literature, the improvement of mechanochemical syntheses by addition of small amounts of a liquid have been reported (LAG, liquid-assisted grinding) [43]. However, in our case, the formation of small amounts of liquid during the milling process lead to agglutination of the remaining solids and therefore insufficient homogenization of the reaction mixture. This gave a mixture of compounds, in which the envisaged complex 5 could not be identified.\nA different approach was made using sodium hydride as a base (Table 1, entry 10). Instead of small amounts of liquid, here, deprotonation leads to the formation of dihydrogen. Hence, another gastight mill was utilized for this approach. Unfortunately, a successful synthesis of 5 directly from 3 was not possible under these conditions: NMR analysis of the resulting mixture indicated the presence of 5, but also of unwanted sideproducts that could not be identified. Purification of 5 from this complex mixture turned out not to be feasible. Further modifications of the milling conditions did not lead to the elimination of these side-products, therefore the experiments with NaH as a base were discontinued. As a side comment, the addition of no base at all led to the formation of the imidazolinium cuprate ([3][CuClBr]\u2212, Table 1, entry 11) [46]. The direct\ntransition of the \u201cbuilt-in base\u201d approach conditions to mechanochemical synthesis (copper(I) oxide and imidazolium salt 3 as starting materials), lead to no formation of 5 (Table 1, entry 12).\nThe use of K2CO3 for the mechanochemical synthesis of copper(I)/NHC complexes [46,47] was feasible for the preparation of 5 (Table 1, entry 13). Importantly, we found that extending on this concept also K3PO4 could be employed equally well while giving significantly higher yields than the previous protocol [46,47] (Table 1, entry 14). All of the approaches discussed here are attractive due to the use of copper(I) chloride as the copper source. Interestingly, the use of K2CO3, which led to the formation of a catalytically inactive postulated CO2 adduct of 5 in the liquid state synthesis, did lead to catalytically active 5 in the mechanochemical approach. In a similar vein, the different outcome with K3PO4 as a base (which led to no catalytically active complexes in the liquid state synthesis) was surprising, as in the ball mill, clean and catalytically active copper(I) complex 5 was obtained. To avoid the possible formation of the catalytically inactive CO2 adduct when employing K2CO3 for the synthesis of 5 we decided to use K3PO4 for subsequent investigations (see also below, Table 2). Even though the imidazolium bromide salt 3 was employed in combination with CuCl as copper(I) precursor, elemental analysis of 5 clearly supported the formation of 5 as a chloride salt (see Supporting Information File 1).\nFor the optimized protocol, the starting materials were mixed in a steel vessel and ground at 450 rpm for a total time of four hours. After ball milling, an off-white powder was obtained which gave complex 5 in very good yield of 91% after extraction with CH2Cl2 and filtration. NMR analysis of 5 matched previously reported data [48,49] and showed no side products. It has to be mentioned that complex 5 synthesized via the mechanochemical route is isolated as a CH2Cl2 adduct (5/CH2Cl2 = 1:1) as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. If complex 5 is formed via the liquid state synthesis [48,49], also a CH2Cl2 adduct is isolated, albeit with a 5/CH2Cl2 ratio of 2:1.\nIn order to demonstrate the general applicability of the K3PO4based protocol for the mechanochemical synthesis of copper(I)/ NHC complexes, we decided to prepare the most common copper(I)/NHC complexes 7a\u2013d [5,6] employing our method (Table 2). When the corresponding imidazoli(ni)um salts 6a\u2013d were submitted to the standard protocol, complexes 7a\u2013d were obtained with acceptable yields, with similar yields compared to previous methods. In some cases, the homoleptic cationic copper(I) complexes [(NHC)2Cu]+CuCl2\u2212 were observed as side products [48,53].\nTable 2: Synthesis of standard Cu(I)/NHC-complexes using K3PO4 as a weak base (standard procedure: steel vessel (12 mL), 6 steel balls (1 cm diameter), 450 rpm, 4 h). (dimer = [(NHC)2Cu+]Cl\u2212).\nComplex Yield Cu(0)/O2 [45] CuCl/K2CO3 [46]\n[Cu(IMes)Cl] (7a) 71% (8% homoleptic cationic Cu(I) complex) 85% 65% [Cu(SIMes)Cl] (7b) 73% 76% 53% [Cu(IPr)Cl] (7c) 63% 82% 78% [Cu(SIPr)Cl] (7d) 64% (12% homoleptic cationic Cu(I) complex) 65% 66%\nWe decided to directly compare complex 5 from mechanochemical synthesis (5bm) with its counterpart from the liquid state transmetallation route (5ls) in catalysis. We found that 5bm was catalytically active, however displaying slightly diminished activity in general most likely due to different adduct ratio inhibiting the catalytic activity (Scheme 3). This was established using the standard reactions for catalytic hydrogenations with copper(I)/NHC complexes [4]. In this vein, we tested complex 5 from solid and liquid phase synthesis in the catalytic hydrogenation of esters, carbonyl compounds and in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. In the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl benzoate (8) lower overall conversion to benzyl alcohol (9) and lower yield was found with 5bm (65% conv. and 53% yield with 5bm, in comparison to 100% conv. and 80% yield with 5ls; Scheme 3a). We hypothesize that the higher amount of CH2Cl2 as part of the prepared complex, which is not a suitable solvent for catalytic ester reduction with H2 [48], led to lower catalyst activity. Possible coordination of residual phosphate to the guanidine moiety was excluded as analysis by 31P NMR experiments. The copper(I)catalyzed 1,2-reduction of functionalized ester 10 was also successfully achieved using the ball mill synthesized bifunctional catalyst 5bm, again with slightly diminished yields and conversions.\nApplication of the ball mill-synthesized complex 5bm in the alkyne semihydrogenation of tolane (12) gave (Z)-stilbene (13) with full stereoselectivity in good yield (86%, Scheme 3b). Noteworthy, the complex 5 was never evaluated in this reported reaction. Therefore, 5bm behaves similarly to other copper(I)/NHC complexes in this transformation [54-60]. The catalytic 1,2-reduction of carbonyl compounds is mainstay for copper(I)/NHC complexes [61-67], which is why we also tested 5bm in these transformations: The 1,2-reduction of benzaldehyde (14) and acetophenone (15) proceeded with good yields\nScheme 3: Application of bifunctional catalyst 5 in copper(I)-catalyzed hydrogenations: comparison of 5 prepared by solid state/ball milling (5bm) and liquid state (5ls) synthesis. Standard conditions: Substrate (0.40 mmol), 10 mol % 5, 1.1 equiv NaOt-Bu, 1.3 equiv 15-crown-5, 100 bar H2, 1,4-dioxane (3 mL), 70 \u00b0C, 24 h.\n(Scheme 3c). No aldol addition for the acetophenone substrate has been observed although working under strongly basic conditions [68,69].\nConclusion In conclusion, we have disclosed a practical approach to a sophisticated bifunctional copper(I)/NHC complex based on a mechanochemical protocol. This operationally simple synthetic route circumvents the previously necessary use of surplus transition metal reagents and therefore diminishes unwanted waste formation. The new protocol presented here is based on K3PO4 and has successfully displayed the activity of the resulting catalyst in a variety of hydrogenative transformations. We show that the new protocol is also amenable to the synthesis of other standard copper(I)/NHC complexes. Our results do not only add to the wide area of applications of mechanochemical synthesis but also showcase that transition metal complexes bearing additional functional groups can be prepared with a ball milling synthesis. We think that our protocol could be useful for the atom economic preparation of other complex catalysts, which are difficult or wasteful to be prepared by typical liquid state synthesis methods.\nExperimental Mechanochemical synthesis procedure for 5: The product was synthesized using a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 classic line, a highenergy planetary ball mill. The starting materials 1-(2-(2,3- diisopropyl-1-methylguanidino)ethyl)-3-mesityl-1H-imidazol3-ium bromide (3, 75 mg, 0.16 mmol, 1.0 equiv), CuCl (17 mg, 0.16 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and K3PO4 (53 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1.5 equiv) were filled into a 12 mL steel vessel equipped with six steel balls (1 cm diameter). The beaker was sealed in an argon-filled glovebox. Milling was carried out with 450 rpm for a total of four hours. After each hour the milling was paused for 30 minutes to avoid overheating of the machine. The raw product was obtained as an off-white powder after milling. The ground product was mixed with CH2Cl2 (3 mL) and the resulting suspension was filtered over a PTFE syringe filter (0.45 \u03bcm). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The product 5 was obtained as the CH2Cl2 adduct as a colourless solid (86 mg, 0.15 mmol, 91%).\nSupporting Information Supporting Information File 1 General procedures, experimental details, analytical data and copies of NMR spectra.
