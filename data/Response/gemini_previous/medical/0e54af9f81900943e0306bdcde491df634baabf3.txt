1. **Investigate the long-term effects of biochar and urea application on soil properties, microbial communities, and crop yields.** This could be done by conducting a field experiment over several growing seasons, or by using a long-term field trial dataset. This research would help to determine the sustainability of biochar and urea application as a soil amendment.


2. **Examine the effects of different types of biochar on soil properties, microbial communities, and crop yields.** This could be done by comparing the effects of biochar made from different feedstocks, such as wood, straw, or manure. This research would help to identify the types of biochar that are most effective for improving soil quality and crop production.


3. **Study the mechanisms by which biochar and urea application affect soil properties, microbial communities, and crop yields.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as DNA sequencing, stable isotope analysis, and microscopy. This research would help to elucidate the complex interactions between biochar, urea, soil, and plants.


4. **Develop models to predict the effects of biochar and urea application on soil properties, microbial communities, and crop yields.** These models could be used to optimize the application of biochar and urea in different cropping systems. This research would help to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.


5. **Conduct economic and environmental life cycle assessments of biochar and urea application.** This research would help to determine the overall environmental and economic benefits of biochar and urea application, and to identify any potential trade-offs.
