    "abstractText": "In particular, the Cattaneo\u2010Christov heat flux model and buoyancy effect have been taken into account in the numerical simulation of time\u2010based unsteady flow of Casson\u2010Williamson nanofluid carried over a magnetic dipole enabled curved stretching sheet with thermal radiation, Joule heating, an exponential heat source, homo\u2010heterogenic reactions, slip, and melting heat peripheral conditions. The specified flow\u2019s partial differential equations are converted to straightforward ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The Runge\u2013Kutta\u2013Fehlberg 4\u20105th order tool has been used to generate solution graphs for the problem under consideration. Other parameters are simultaneously set to their default settings while displaying the solution graphs for all flow defining profiles with the specific parameters. Each produced graph has been the subject of an extensive debate. Here, the analysis shows that the thermal buoyancy component boosts the velocity regime. The investigation also revealed that the melting parameter and radiation parameter had counterintuitive effects on the thermal profile. The velocity distribution of nanofluid flow is also slowed down by the ferrohydrodynamic interaction parameter. The surface drag has decreased as the unsteadiness parameter has increased, while the rate of heat transfer has increased. To further demonstrate the flow and heat distribution, graphical representations of streamlines and isotherms have been offered.",

The specified flow\u2019s partial differential equations are converted to straightforward ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The Runge\u2013Kutta\u2013Fehlberg 4\u20115th order tool has been used to generate solution graphs for the problem under consideration. Other parameters are simultaneously set to their default settings while displaying the solution graphs for all flow defining profiles with the specific parameters. Each produced graph has been the subject of an extensive debate. Here, the analysis shows that the thermal buoyancy component boosts the velocity regime. The investigation also revealed that the melting parameter and radiation parameter had counterintuitive effects on the thermal profile. The velocity distribution of nanofluid flow is also slowed down by the ferrohydrodynamic interaction parameter. The surface drag has decreased as the unsteadiness parameter has increased, while the rate of heat transfer has increased. To further demonstrate the flow and heat distribution, graphical representations of streamlines and isotherms have been offered.\nModern study in the topic is being encouraged by the expanded applications of multiphase flow of various fluid types across continuously extended surfaces. One such example is the movement of fluid across a curved stretched sheet. With a change in flow steering settings, the stretched sheet\u2019s curved form alters how the flow behaves. This subject of research has benefited from the contributions of several experts from throughout the world. In their exploratory study of the mixed convective flow of water-based nanofluids across an extended curved surface, Hayat et\u00a0al.1 found convergent series solutions. The impact of an exponential, space-dependent heat source on the Casson fluid flow across a stretched, curved sheet has been researched by Nagaraja and Gireesha2. The stretching pace and flow model is time-independent in the aforementioned experiments. However, the sheet elongation may begin briefly or unsteadily in many engineering and technology challenges. Therefore, the need for testing the unsteady flow across stretched geometry has increased. For the dual stratified flow of Casson fluid Chen et\u00a0al3 analysed heat and mass flux using Fourier\u2019s and Fick\u2019s laws.

Ramzan et\u00a0al7 looked into the mixed convective flow Casson fluid in presence of gyrotactic microbes between two concentric cylinders. Nasir et\u00a0al8 analysed non-linear convective -radiative flow of Oldroyd B non-Newtonian fluid when subjected Robin\u2019s boundary condition. They have concluded that increasing relaxation parameter diminishes velocity profile. Further Nasir et\u00a0al9 have also interpreted the results for Casson nanofluid over a vertical convective surface. The unsteady flow across curved geometry has been further studied by several other researchers10,11.\nThe extensive research on non-Newtonian fluids meets a lot of the demands of contemporary industry. Specifically, the non-Newtonian nanofluid flow over continually stretched geometry. It has several uses in the polymer industry, thinning, and many other production sectors. As a result, non-Newtonian nanofluids are the principal subject of current study. Numerous scholars have investigated non-Newtonian nanofluid models such as Casson, Carreau, Maxwell, Jeffrey, etc. The novel topic of study that has already attracted the attention of many scientists is the merging of non-Newtonian fluid models like Casson-Micropolar, Carreau-Yasuda, and Casson-Carreau. In their study of the time-dependent 3-D flow of Casson-Carreau fluid across a continuously extended surface, Raju and Sandeep12 discovered that the heat and mass transfer rates in Casson fluid are higher than those in Carreau fluid. Amjad et\u00a0al.13 examined the Casson micropolar nanofluid flow over a porous curved stretching sheet and came to the conclusion that the curvature parameter reduces the microrotation profile. A comparison study of the 3-D Casson-Carreau fluid flow across a porous curved stretched surface was done by Akolade and Tijani14. An investigation of the MHD flow of Casson-Williamson fluid across a magnetically enhanced stretching surface with numerous slip boundaries has been provided by Humane et\u00a0al.15. They have illustrated how the thermal radiation and magnetic field influence the thermal profile.\nThe conversion of thermal radiation from fluid motion into electromagnetic radiation has applications in a wide range of industries, including solar energy products, car radiators, thermal power plants, and many more. A study by Naveed et\u00a0al.16 examined the impact of thermal radiation on the flow of micropolar fluid powered by a curved stretching sheet and came to the conclusion that by enhancing the radiation parameter, the performance of the thermal panel is enhanced. Megahed et\u00a0al.17 investigated the problem of boundary layer MHD flow produced by an unsteady stretching sheet using variable fluid properties, heat flux, and thermal radiation. They concluded that as the radiation parameter increases, the thermal profile decreases near the boundary and then improves. Williamson fluid flow across stretching and shrinking geometry with thermal radiation has been examined by Ibrahim and Negera18 in their work. Waqas et\u00a0al19 studied the radiative effects on bioconvective micropolar nanofluid flow over a stretched surface whereas Pasha et\u00a0al20 recorded the impact of radiation effects tangent hyperbolic flow under the consideration of Soret Dufour effects.\nDipole is an abstract system that makes field estimations using a challenging charge mechanism. Typically, a magnetic dipole serves as the source of a static magnetic field. It is undeniable that the magnetic dipole phenomenon is connected to the magnetic field and is thus frequently used in medicine. A magnetic dipole has advantages in NMR spectroscopy and magnotherapy. Yasmeen et\u00a0al.21 analysed the magnetic dipole for homo-heterogenic processes when ferrous particles are suspended in the carrier fluid. Hayat et\u00a0al.22 conducted more research on this dipole contribution to Williamson fluid. Gowda et\u00a0al.23 investigated how a magnetised ferro fluid magnetic dipole might affect an extended sheet. By accelerating the transfer of heat, Stefan blowing presence illustrates its significance. Zeeshan and Majeed24 investigated how a magnetic dipole affected the flow and heat transfer of Jeffery fluid across a stretched sheet. They have explained how the temperature and velocity of ferromagnetic interactions change. The study on the magnetic dipole influence on the unsteady flow of various fluids across stretching geometry has been supported by several more researcher25.\nStreams in the ocean, solar receivers, heterogeneously pushed air flows, and\u00a0etc., are examples of naturally occurring phenomena where mixed convective (which includes both natural and forced) flows have a variety of uses. One such characteristic of mixed convection is the buoyancy force brought on by temperature and density variations. In their research on the flows of Walter\u2019s-B fluid and tangent hyperbolic nanofluid26,27, Khan et\u00a0al.28 took non-linear mixed convection into account.\nNumerous chemically reactive structures incorporate homo-heterogenic processes, including catalysis, combustion, and biological systems. A really complicated relationship exists between homo-heterogenic forms of responses. According to Imtiaz et\u00a0al.29, homo-heterogenic reactions have an impact on the time-dependent flow over curved geometry. According to their findings, concentration distribution increases for heterogenic reaction parameters and decreases for homogenic reaction parameters. Pal and Mandal30 investigated the effect of homo-heterogeneous reactions on the flow of CNT nanofluid across a stretched plate. The study on homoheterogenic reaction\u2019s impact on various fluids over curved stretching geometry has been supported by several other researchers31,32. Numerous renowned researchers have taken into account the slip flow and melting heat phenomena process at the interface for various fluid flows33,34.\nTo examine the mechanism of heat transport under vivid conditions, a variety of models have been proposed, one of which is the Fourier convention model for heat conduction. However, this idea encountered a problem since it produced a parabolic thermal field and defied the causality principle. Thus, the thermal relaxation time came into play, allowing the transmission of heat through the propagation of thermal waves at a limited pace. The uses of this concept ranged from nanoliquid flow to skin blisters brought on by burning. In order to maintain the notion of the material-invariant, Christov35 altered the Cattaneo law by adding a new term that combines the derivative of time with the derivative of Oldroyd\u2019s upper convection. Furthermore, Ali et\u00a0al.36 used the Cattaneo-Christov paradigm, which revealed the outcomes of the Soret-Dufour effects. According to their inquiry,\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:12770 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-39354-5\nthe velocities are known to improve when the parameter related to rotating fluid is enlarged. Further several authors37,38 carried out the study for the nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid flow in presence of Cattaneo\u2013Christov heat flux. Ahmad et\u00a0al39 discussed double diffusion for the flow Eyring\u2013Powell -liquid. Wang et\u00a0al40 deliberated the Cattaneo\u2013Christov heat-mass transfer for a third-grade fluid flow over a stretched surface and homotopy scheme was implemented to obtain the convergent solutions.\nAn examination of the above recent literature reveals that the present investigation which models the unsteady flow of a Casson-Williamson nanofluid, is innovative and an advancement in the field since combination of flow of two different non-Newtonian fluid models has many applications in the manufacturing sector. The modelling has been done in curvilinear coordinates, under the circumstances of the buoyancy effect, the Cattaneo-Christov heat flux model, thermal radiation, homo-heterogenic processes, Joule heating, exponential heat production, and the magnetic dipole moment. The slip and melting heat conditions are considered at the boundary of the stretching surface. When it comes to curved shape, considerable effects, and optimal peripheral circumstances, the innovative combination of Casson nanofluid and Williamson nanofluid in the current work is relatively worth analysing. The results of the present study are significant and welcome the further research in the field due to the showcase of lucid behavioural changes of all flow profiles for imperative parameters of engineering interest."

Allowing for uw(s) = as1\u2212\u03b1\u2217t as the sheet\u2019s stretching speed, where t is time, a is the stretching rate, and \u03b1\n\u2217 is a constant with dimension reciprocal of time. When analyzing the fluid flow behavior, the impact of the magnetic dipole moment is taken into account. In the r direction, the magnetic field Bm = B0\u221a(1\u2212\u03b1\u2217t) is applied. To examine the flow properties of the aforementioned nanofluid, the influence of buoyancy is taken into consideration. To study the thermal behavior of the flow, the effects of thermal radiation, Joule heating, and an exponential space dependent heat source are taken into account in the energy equation. In order to fully understand how it affects the flow, the Cattaneo-Christov heat flux model has been used.

The slip condition is enhanced at the melting surface boundary. The use of similarity catalysts converts the preset equations into straightforward ordinary differential equations. The examined flow issue is represented graphically using the Runge\u2013Kutta\u2013Fehlberg 4-5th order approach, an effective numerical tool. The rest of the parameter values have been preserved at their usual values as \u03b2 = 2, \u03ba = 4,We = 0.1,M\u2217 = 1, T = 2.5, CH = 0.3, \u03b4\u2217 = 0.1,\u03b2m = 1, b = 1,Ec = 0.1,Rd = 1.5,Pr = 7,Nt = 0.01,Nb = 0.01,Q = 0.1, m = 0.5, \u01eb = 0.5, Sc = 7, k1 = 0.1, k2 = 0.1, L1 = 0.1,Me = 0.7 while carrying out numerical extractions for all flow fields against the relevant parameters.

The variations in velocity ( f \u2032(\u03b7) ) for ascending magnetic attribute ( M\u2217 ) values are clearly shown in Fig.\u00a02, which is declining in nature. The Lorentz force, which is present and amplified by the increase in M\u2217 , is the cause of this velocity impedance. When increasing values of \u03b2m are present, it is clear from Fig.\u00a03 that the velocity panel de-escalates. The velocity distribution is decreased as a result of the dominance of the ferrohydrodynamic interaction factor and increased Lorentz force. The fluid\u2019s behavior increases as it moves farther from the sheet, as seen by the indicated behavior of the velocity distribution in Fig.\u00a04 for expanding values of \u03b4\u2217 .

The velocity regime for the parameter T is shown in Fig.\u00a05. The relative variable impact of the thermal floating force on the flow of nanofluid is personified by it. As seen in Fig.\u00a05, the increase in thermal buoyancy force causes the flow to move more quickly. Figure\u00a06 clearly illustrates the influence of the velocity slip factor\u2019s de-escalation on the velocity distribution. In stretched sheets and fluid flows, an increase in L1 creates heterogenic velocity, which results in a decrease in the velocity distribution. The effect of a magnetic dipole\u2019s dimensionless distance on the velocity regime is briefly explored in Fig.\u00a07.

Temperature panel changes in response to rising heat dissipation factor values. The temperature panel reduces as m grows due to an increase in the transfer of heat away from the sheet, as seen in Fig.\u00a09. Because of the combined effects of radiation and the melting heat phenomena, which is depicted in Fig.\u00a010, the thermal regime decreases with increasing values of Me . Figure\u00a011 depicts the growing behaviour of the thermal distribution for expanding values of \u03b4\u2217 as a result of the cyclical behaviour of the stretching sheet. For rising levels of T , Fig.\u00a012 shows the thermal regime\u2019s decrementing characteristic. Because there are more thermal floating forces present when the temperature is raised, the hotness of the fluid is replaced by coolness, which causes the thermal panel to sink. Figure\u00a013 shows how the radiation parameter (Rd) affects the temperature panel. Because of the decrease in mean absorption coefficient, the thermal profile improves at higher values of Rd .

Figure\u00a015 depicts how the temperature regime changes as CH values increase. The reason for this is thought to be due to the thermal boundary layer eroding.\nTo identify the distinctive differences in the solutal regime for the components of the unsteady factor (\u03b4\u2217) , homogenic reaction strength (k1) , heterogenic reaction strength (k2) and velocity slip factor (L1) , Figs.\u00a016, 17, 18 and 19 are successively detailed. The mass movement in the flow is impeded by the flow\u2019s enhanced unsteadiness. As a result, mass distribution slows down as \u03b4\u2217 increases in magnitude, as seen in Fig.\u00a016. Figure\u00a017 shows the concentration panel\u2019s curves for the upshot values of k1 . The concentration profile is discouraged by a rise in k1 . The link between the concentration panel and k2 is further explained in Fig.\u00a018. Due to an increase in mass diffusion, a rising influence of k2 deescalates the mass transfer profile. The influence of the velocity slip parameter on the mass transfer regime is shown as a result in Fig.\u00a019. Here, when L1 increases, the mass transfer panel decreases.\nFigure\u00a018.

Skin friction co-efficient increased due to the unsteadiness parameter\u2019s amplification. Every time the ferrohydrodynamic interaction parameter increases, the surface drag decreases. Figure\u00a021 explains how the unsteadiness parameter behaves in relation to the thermal buoyancy parameter ( T ) . Surface drag is shown to decrease as the unsteadiness parameter (\u03b4\u2217) approaches its maximum value. The skin friction coefficient increases with the thermal buoyancy parameter. Figure\u00a022 illustrates how the radiation parameter (Rd) responds to the heat dissipation factor ( m) on Nusselt number ( NuSRe \u2212 1 2 )\n. The heat transfer rate marginally decreases when the sheet is exposed to intense radiation. The rate is also slightly increased by magnifying ( m) . The higher the heat dissipation factor number, the greater the rate of heat transmission. Figure\u00a023 illustrates the characteristics of the unsteadiness parameter (\u03b4\u2217) for different heat dissipation factors ( m) . Increases in the unsteadiness parameter (\u03b4\u2217) result in the lowest heat transfer rate.\nIn a 2D contour plot (streamlines) Fig.\u00a024, the trajectory followed by the Casson-Williamson fluid particles is described for magnetic parameter at M\u2217 = 0.1 and M\u2217 = 3 . In Fig.\u00a025, the streamlines for the unsteadiness parameters \u03b4\u2217 = \u22120.5 and \u03b4\u2217 = 0.2 are also explained.
