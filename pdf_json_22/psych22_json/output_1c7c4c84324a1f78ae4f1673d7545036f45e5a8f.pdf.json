In order to further explore the therapeutic effects of high-frequency and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on depression and cognitive function in the elderly, this paper proposed a study on cortical plasticity mechanism and efficacy prediction of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation based on continuous short pulse fast pulse stimulation (CTBS). This paper selected 92 patients with depression in a hospital from January to December 2020 as the research object and divided them into control group, low-frequency group, and high-frequency group, 31 cases, 29 cases, and 32 cases, respectively. The continuous short pulse rapid pulse stimulation (CTBS) mode was used to explore the effect of brain network on patients\u2019 emotional processing. After clinical treatment contrast, there was no significant difference in HAMD-24 scores and RBANS scores before treatment (P > 0:05), and there was a significant negative correlation between factors of cognitive impairment in patients and RBANS scores (P < 0:01 or P < 0:05), so it was proved that the repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) could be used as an effective treatment for depression."

            "text": "Depression is one of the more serious mental diseases. At present, it is the second largest cause of disability in the world. Therefore, its incidence rate is relatively high [1], and it has the characteristics of concealment and great harm. This mental disease occurs in all age groups. According to relevant statistics, about 264 million people in the world suffer from depression, which is characterized by a relatively heavy personal and social burden and may lead to a high suicide rate. Worldwide, approximately 800,000 people commit suicide every year, and 50% of these deaths occur in people with depression. According to different drugs, transcranial magnetic stimulation during recurrence is a new treatment\noption. The robot navigation machine can place a stimulation coil, which has a strong purpose of stimulation. In addition, the side effects are relatively small and effective. Combination with antidepressants will accelerate clinical response [2]."

            "text": "Ryan and others found that changes in cortical excitability have been demonstrated after stroke and are thought to be associated with motor recovery. Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as an extracranial stimulation technique, can modulate the excitability of the cerebral cortex and has been clinically used as an auxiliary therapy for\nHindawi Mediators of Inflammation Volume 2022, Article ID 5741114, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5741114\nRE TR AC TE D sports rehabilitation [3]. In recent years, some new stimulation modes have been developed and applied in clinical research, such as continuous short pulse stimulation (cTBS). Guti\u00e9rrez-Muto et al. found that the mechanism of cTBS was basically consistent with that of traditional rTMS, including changing cortical excitability, inducing long-term enhancement (LTP) and long-term inhibition (LTD), promoting neural remodeling, and stimulating neural network oscillation. Meanwhile, cTBS also had the ability of painless, noninvasive, safe, and reliable excitability regulation [4]. The main difference between cTBS and traditional rTMS is that cTBS can induce cortical excitability changes within 20~190 s and shorten the stimulation time by at least 20~30min. Memon pointed out that compared with traditional rTMS, CTBS can produce strong and lasting effects on human cerebral cortex with lower stimulation intensity and shorter time [5]. In addition, Lazzaro and others found that the effects of traditional rTMS varied greatly among different studies, but the effects of cTBS were relatively consistent, and cTBS had a significant effect on improving motor cortex excitability in healthy people [6]. According to the research of Cantone and others, because cTBS has good therapeutic effect on stroke and other motor disorders and regulation of motor cortex excitability, transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with (EEG) technology should be widely used to regulate the excitability of human motor cortex and study brain functional network [7]. At the same time, Garland and others found that EEG signal was not only easy to collect and highly sensitive to the brain stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation but also had low acquisition cost and high spatial resolution, which provided a reliable basis for studying the physiological response of brain stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Therefore, the study of cerebral motor cortex and brain functional network under cTBS stimulation based on EEG signals has broad prospects [8]. Pilisi and others found that using fMRI data in the resting state, the feature center vector and functional connection analysis method revealed that the brain functional network under the stimulus of happy emotional face had small-world characteristics; using fMRI data of resting state and graph theory analysis, it is concluded that the brain networks of both depressed patients and normal people in resting state have small-world characteristics, but the brain functional networks of depressed patients are more prone to randomization [9]. In related studies, in addition to those using fMRI data to construct brain functional networks, EEG signals with high temporal resolution have also become a common research method because the changes of brain activity in the process of emotional cognition are at the millisecond level. Using EEG signals to classify different emotional states, Nk and others found that the phase synchronization index of the frontal region of normal subjects in negative emotional states was lower than that in positive emotional states, and the brain connectivity would change under different emotional states; using EEG signals based on \u03b3 band phase synchronization, it was found that the temporal and frontal regions of the brain were closely connected under the stimulation of unhappy emotions [10]."

            "text": "3.1. Experimental Objects and Methods. In the form of volunteer recruitment, 12 students aged 20-25 were selected as voluntary subjects, who were right-handed, could not play musical instruments, healthy, and had no history of drug dependence. Of the 12 subjects, 8 were male, and 4 were female. Rapid2 transcranial magnetic stimulation instrument was used with Figure 1 stimulation coil, and the maximum output stimulation intensity was 2.2T. STIM2 system was used for finger motion test, and the key accuracy rate and average response time of each subject were measured, respectively [11]. In this experiment, cTBS mode was used to complete the stimulation group experiment, and the sham stimulation group was used as the control group. The stimulation intensity of cTBS was 30%mt, and the stimulation frequency was 5Hz. Each stimulation contained 3 single pulses with a frequency of 50Hz, 15 pulses per second, a total of 900 pulses. In the sham stimulation group, the stimulation coil was placed perpendicular to the scalp, and the stimulation parameters were consistent with cTBS stimulation. The finger motion measurement experiment task included 4 groups, each group contained 100 stimulus trials, respectively, \u201cbig,\u201d \u201csmall,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d and \u201cright\u201d, a total of 100 prompt words; the order of stimulus trials was presented randomly. Each prompt is presented in 500ms, and the subject needs to respond to the key in 1000ms. When the Chinese characters are \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cleft,\u201d click the context by the left mouse button. When the Chinese characters \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cright\u201d are inspired by the right mouse button context [12], the time frame for each request is 2000 milliseconds. NeuroScan software was used to preprocess EEG signals, mainly including eliminating obvious drift and removing electroophthalmologic artifacts; in addition, 0.5~40Hz band-pass filtering without phase shift is performed. The number of experimental benefit channels is 29, namely, FP1, FP2, F7, F3, FZ, F4, F8, FT7, FC3, FCZ, FC4, FT8, T7, C3, CZ, C4, T8, TP7, CP3, CPZ, CP4, TP8, P7, P3, PZ, P4, P8, O1, and O2. Pearson correlation coefficient formula is used to analyze the correlation characteristics and obtain the correlation matrix, where Pearson correlation coefficient formula is: rij = \u2211Ti=1 xi t\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xi\u00bd \u22c5 xj t\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xj \u00c2 \u00c3 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2211Ti=1 xi t\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xi\u00bd 2 \u22c5 xj t\u00f0 \u00de \u2212 xj \u00c2 \u00c32q : \u00f01\u00de Among which, t represents data point; T represents the total length of data; xi, xj, respectively, represent the EEG time series of channels i andj; xi, xj represent the average value of the EEG time series of channels i andj, namely, a 29 \u00d7 29 time series correlation matrix can be obtained. The Pearson correlation coefficient r of EEG signal ranges from -1 to +1; r reflects the synchronization relation of 2 EEG signals. 0 means no correlation between the two\nRE TR AC\nEEG signals; (0, 1) represents the positive correlation between the two EEG signals, that is, the two EEG signals have the same change; 1 indicates a complete positive correlation between the two EEG signals; (-1, 0) represents the negative correlation between the two EEG signals, that is, the two EEG signals have opposite trends, with one signal increasing and the other decreasing; -1 indicates that the two EEG signals are completely negatively correlated. The stronger the correlation of EEG signals, the higher the synchronization of corresponding brain regions. 3.2. Functional Brain Network. For EEG signal acquisition electrodes A and B, if the phase difference of analytic signal is satisfied: \u03d1p,q = p\u03d1A \u2212 q\u03d1Bj j < cos tan t: \u00f02\u00de Then, the two signals are said to be in phase synchronization (usually p = q = 1). The phase synchronization level between signals can be characterized by the phase synchronization index, which is defined as r = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 M \u3020 M\u22121 m=0 sin\u03d11,1 m\u00f0 \u00de \" #2 + 1 M \u3020 M\u22121 m=0 s cos \u03d11,1 m\u00f0 \u00de\n\" #2vuut : \u00f03\u00de M is an example. Then, the r value is equal to [0, 1], and a value of 1 indicates that the phase synchronization is complete. A value of 0 means the phases are fully synchronized and represents the power connection of the network. Finally, a 58 by 58 matrix can be obtained.\nAs shown in Equation (4), here, N represents the total number of nodes (EEG channels) in the network, and K represents the number of connected edges in the network.\nCost K\u00f0 \u00de = K N N \u2212 1\u00f0 \u00de/2 : \u00f04\u00de\nA network cost range for [0.02, 0.5], the step length of 0.02 is selected, the value of K is calculated under each determined cost of the network according to the formula (4), and the value of K determines the threshold (connection strength); the phase synchronization matrix is transformed into a weighted undirected network, namely, only when the matrix elements in greater than or equal to threshold to retain the corresponding value; otherwise, it will be 0. The network analysis process is shown in Figure 2.\nIn the connectivity graph of the network, Li,j is defined as the shortest path length, that is, the minimum number of connected edges among all paths connecting node i and node j. The connection efficiency between two nodes is inversely proportional to the shortest path length. Global efficiency of the network Eglobal represents the information exchange capability of the entire network, and it is defined as:\nEglobal = 1 N N \u2212 1\u00f0 \u00de\u3020i\u2260j 1 Li,j : \u00f05\u00de\nThe local efficiency is similar to the clustering coefficient and reflects the information exchange capacity between the nearest neighbors of a particular node i. Local efficiency Elocal is defined as:\nElocal = 1 NGi NGi \u2212 1 \u00c0 \u00c1 \u3020 K\u2260Gi 1 Li,j : \u00f06\u00de\nRE TR AC TE D NGi represents the number of nodes in Gi. The cost efficiency of the network is the difference between the global efficiency of the network and the cost of the network. ECost = Eglobal \u2212 Cost: \u00f07\u00de The effects of cTBS stimulation on brain functional network were analyzed from node degree K , clustering coefficient c, characteristic path length L, small-world attribute value \u03c3, and other brain functional network parameters. The value of \u03c3 indicates the strength of network smallworld attributes. The small-world attribute is defined as follows: \u03b3 = Cnet Crand > 1, \u03bb = Lnet Lrand , \u03c3 = \u03b3 \u03bb : \u00f08\u00de The characteristic parameters of brain functional network in different states were calculated experimentally. It can be seen from Table 1 that there was no significant change in each parameter before and after the pseudostimulus. After cTBS stimulation, the network node degree decreases, the group coefficient decreases, the feature length increases, and the small-world attribute decreases, indicating that cTBS has an impact on brain functional network [13].\nEach bar chart of network parameters can be seen from Figures 1, 3\u20139.\nTable 2 is the statistical test table of network parameters. The left coordinate of the bar graph represents the value of network parameters. By comparing the height of the bar graph of network parameters in different states, the influence of pseudostimulation and cTBS stimulation on brain functional network parameters can be judged [14]. As can be seen from Figures 1, 3\u20139, network parameters do not change significantly before and after the pseudostimulation, but changes after the C-TBS stimulation.\nFrom Table 2, it can be seen that the significance of the network inequality before and after the pseudostimulation totals P > 0:05, so the network is not significantly different. Not before and after the pseudostimulus, the network was not compared before. P < 0:05 after cTBS stimulation; therefore, the results showed that cTBS stimulation reduced the node degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and small-world attribute of the network, with significant differences. Finger key movement test: pseudostimulation and 30%mt C TBS stimulation were conducted to the subjects, respectively, and stim2 system was used to stimulate the subjects\u2019 vision. The subjects responded to the visual stimulation by clicking the mouse left and right, and the system recorded the accuracy and response time of the key movement test [15]. Table 3 shows the average correct rate and average reaction time of 12 subjects in the finger key movement test.\nAs can be seen from Table 3, the keystroke accuracy before and after cTBS stimulation did not change significantly, and the average response time before and after cTBS stimulation did not change significantly while the mean response time after cTBS stimulation was increased compared with that before stimulation. Therefore, it is proved that cTBS stimulation of motor areas reduced the connectivity between motor related brain regions and the excitability of cerebral cortex, and the transmission rate of information in brain regions decreased, thus increasing the motor response time."

The general situation questionnaire (self-made) was used to collect the patient\u2019s gender, age, marital status, educational level, long-term res-\nidence, work situation, age of first depressive episode, frequency of depressive episode, and other information by asking family members and consulting medical records.\nDepressed patients were assessed using the most widely used clinical trial for depression, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which was divided into 17-item, 21-item, and 24-item categories. Considering that elderly patients with depression are more complicated with anxiety disorder, in order to comprehensively evaluate the depression\nRE TR\nAC\nTE D\nsituation of patients, the version with 24 items is used, which can quantitatively evaluate the depression severity of elderly patients with depression more comprehensively than the other two versions. The scale consists of 7 factors, including weight, cognitive impairment, anxiety/somatization, diurnal change, block, hopelessness, and sleep disturbance. The\nhigher the score, the more severe the depression. Severity rating: less than 8 points, no depression, more than 20 points, and mild or moderate depression; a total score of more than 35 is considered severe depression.

This scale\nhas been tested repeatedly by multiple working groups and has good reliability and validity in the elderly [20, 21]. The elderly are more likely to be tired and have trouble sticking with long-term assessments. RBANS can be completed in less than 30 minutes and includes a wide range of neuropsychological functions.

To ensure the effectiveness of the stimulation and the accuracy of the experiment, the rTMS was performed by the same rTMS therapist with uniform training.\nEXCEL was used to import data, and statistical analysis of data was performed using IBM SPSS21.0 statistical software package; descriptive statistical analysis was performed on the general data of patients in the three groups.

In addition, epilepsy, mania, convulsions, and other obvious adverse reactions were not observed during the whole course of treatment."

The experimental results indicate that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging physical therapy technique. Compared with escitalopram alone, the combination of escitalopram can significantly improve the depressive symptoms and cognitive function of elderly depression.\nHowever, rTMS stimulation frequency had no effect on the improvement effect, which was consistent with existing research results.\nWith the aging of the population, the pressure of single year aging is increasing, which has had a significant impact on the whole economy and society. Cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the occurrence and development of depression. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) participates in the combination of thinking, behavior, and auditory processes, and the cingulate gyrus (ACC) participates through two limbs. It plays an important role in the treatment of depression: dorsal ACC is an important function of human body. \u201cDorsal\u201d network includes hippocampus and DLPFC. External ACC acts on amygdala, hypothalamus, and OFC to form ventral network. The dorsal \u201cintelligence/function\u201d is considered to be important for function and plays an important role in emotional intelligence perception, while the ventral or \u201cfeeling/function\u201d believes that \u201cthe network participates in the importance of evaluation thinking.\u201d The hippocampus is located at the junction of the dorsal and external ACC and neuroendocrine regulatory networks (especially the hypothalamic-pituitary axis); there is substantial evidence for its role in mood disorders, including memory loss that occurs in LLD. It has been shown that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the control of positive emotions, such as joy and pleasure, while the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the control of negative emotions, such as depression and sadness. Recent neuroimaging and pathophysiological studies have demonstrated this pattern and function. Abnormalities in frontal-subcortical neural networks are associated with depressive symptoms.\nRepeated transcranial magnetic stimulation generates an induced magnetic field through an electric current in a coil, which can alter the excitability of the cerebral cortex and induce lasting changes in synaptic plasticity. However, repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at different frequencies can produce different effects on the cerebral cortex. That is, high frequency (\u226510Hz) can improve the excitability of the stimulated brain region; low frequency (\u22641Hz) can reduce the excitability of the stimulated brain region. The study found that the function of prefrontal cortex in patients with depression decreased significantly, which\nSleep disorders -0.076 0.137 -0.158 -0.151 0.073 -0.108 Desperation -0.294\u2217\u2217 -0.180 -0.351\u2217\u2217 -0.268\u2217\u2217 -0.069 -0.208\u2217\n\u2217\u2217 represents a significant correlation at the level of 0.01 (bilateral). \u2217 represents significant correlation at the level of 0.05 (bilateral).\nRE TR AC TE D\nis consistent with the fact that rTMS stimulation of DLPFC can improve cognitive function in patients with depression, but has little correlation with rTMS frequency. This is consistent with the fact that rTMS stimulation of DLPFC can improve cognitive function in patients with depression, but has little correlation with rTMS frequency, that is, both highfrequency and low-frequency rTMS can improve cognitive function in elderly patients with depression. According to neuroscience research, the pathogenesis of poststroke depression may be the abnormality of neural circuits in the left marginal system, prefrontal cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. According to this theory, the prefrontal cortex controls human emotional expression, and the right prefrontal lobe regulates depression, which makes people shrink back; the left prefrontal cortex is associated with relatively positive emotions, such as happiness and happiness. This theory may be helpful for the treatment of depressive symptoms in elderly patients with depression. The right DLPFC of the cerebral cortex is closely related to the generation of negative emotion, while the left DLPFC of the cerebral cortex is closely related to the generation of positive emotion. Therefore, it is suggested that the pathogenesis of depressive disorder may because the hypofunction of the left cerebral cortex and the hyperactivation of the right cerebral cortex. Therefore, many studies focused on increasing the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or decreasing the excitability of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to control stress. Therefore, high-frequency rTMS was used to support the left cerebral cortex to improve left excitability. Prefrontal cortex, cortex and low-frequency rTMS are used to support the right cerebral cortex to reduce the excitability of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nThrough correlation analysis and regression analysis of depression and cognitive function in three groups of elderly patients with depression after treatment, it is found that anxiety/somatization factors were negatively correlated with RBANS scores in patients with depression, suggesting that anxiety/somatization is significantly correlated with cognitive impairment, which is basically consistent with clinical findings. Elderly patients with depression rarely have typical symptoms such as low mood and slow thinking, which are mainly manifested in anxiety, irritability, and physical discomfort. It is suggested to pay close attention to the physical discomfort of elderly patients with depression in daily work to prevent misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Blocking factor is negatively correlated with visual span, immediate memory, attention, delayed memory, and RBANS. Due to retirement, decline in working ability, decline in self-care ability, and the heavy burden of family care, the elderly often have a sense of self-guilt and incompetence, which may aggravate the cognitive impairment of elderly patients with depression. Therefore, it is suggested that we should pay attention to the psychological status of elderly patients in our work, take care of the dignity of elderly patients with depression, and change their bad cognitive pattern. Blocking several subsymptoms such as guilt, energy loss, and lack of interest have a significant impact on cognitive decline, which is basically consistent with the existing research results."
