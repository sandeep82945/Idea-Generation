    "abstractText": "We demonstrated a new method for temperature measurement inside a fiber ring laser (FRL) cavity. Different from traditional FRL temperature sensing system which need additional filter working as a sensor, a micro-fiber coupler (MFC) was designed as a beam splitter, filter, and temperature sensor. In addition, isopropanol, a liquid with very high photothermal coefficient, is selectively filled in the MFC in order to improve the sensitivity of the system on temperature. In the dynamic range of 20\u201340 \u25e6C, we obtained a good temperature sensitivity of \u22121.29 nm/\u25e6C, with linear fitting up to 0.998. Benefiting from the advantages of laser sensing, the acquired laser has a 3 \u2013 dB bandwidth of less than 0.2 nm and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of up to 40 dB. The proposed sensor has a low cost and high sensitivity, which is expected to be used in biomedical health detection, real-time monitoring of ocean temperature, and other application scenarios.",

Introduction\nOptical fiber sensors have been widely recognized after decades of development [1\u20135]. Differently from traditional electronic sensors, optical fiber has its own indispensable advantages, including but not limited to: electrical insulation, corrosion resistance, variable shape, small size, wide range of measuring objects, and easy reuse [6\u201310]. Among them, temperature, as the most important parameter for perceiving the external environment, has received the most extensive attention from scientists, and has been widely researched [11\u201313]. Various optical fiber structures have been designed to improve the sensitivity, stability, and practicability of temperature sensing [14\u201316]. Common structures include Mach Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI), Sagnac Ring, and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) [17\u201320]. However, due to the characteristics of broadband light sources, there are some unavoidable defects, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and large linewidth, which will cause measurement errors. In recent years, MFC has been noticed. It has been found that after two ordinary single-mode optical fibers are fused and pulled to one MFC, interference will occur. High sensitivity temperature monitoring can be achieved by filling liquid with a high photothermal coefficient. Wang et al. immersed micro/nano optical fibers in seawater for a dual parameter measurement of salinity and temperature [21]. In order to maintain a stable structure in liquid, they proposed a method of ethyl cellulose ethanol film coating. By coating the coupling region with ethyl cellulose ethanol solvent, it can operate stably in seawater. The temperature sensitivity is \u22121.13 nm/\u25e6C. However, the signal intensity of this structure is below 70 dB, leading to questions about the practicability of monitoring in the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1697. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13101697 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1697 2 of 11\nreal marine environment. Zhao\u2019s and Jian\u2019s group proposed an ultra-high sensitivity optical fiber temperature sensing system based on alcohol filling almost at the same time [22,23]. The temperature sensitivity up to 5 nm/\u25e6C was achieved through biconical fiber taper coupling, capillary encapsulation, and isopropanol filling. However, large bandwidth may cause potential measurement errors, and it is still possible to continue improving. In the past decade, a sensing system based on fiber ring laser cavity has been gradually attracting attention. It is independent of a broadband light source, and has advantages including narrow linewidth, high signal-to-noise ratio, and no burr. Fukushima et al. proposed a dual-pass cascaded-chirped long-period fiber grating as a reflective sensor device, and a wavelength selection element with comb spectrum to achieve a temperature sensor based on erbium-doped fiber laser, achieving a temperature sensitivity of 0.2 nm/\u25e6C [24]. However, the cascade structure is complex, not only increasing the system cost but also reducing the stability at the same time. In addition, Lin et al. discovered the vernier effect in the fiber laser cavity by cascading Sagnac rings, which increased the temperature sensitivity by more than four times. However, the complex structure design reduced the signal-tonoise ratio of the system [25]. In the past two years, researchers have gradually realized that the MFC formed by melting two single-mode optical fibers into a taper can replace the coupler of the traditional process to operate in the FRL system. All work is focused on achieving ultra-fast lasers by coating MFC with saturable absorption [26\u201329]. As far as we know, the FRL system based on MFC for sensor systems has not been reported yet. In this letter, differently from the traditional FRL temperature sensing system, we combined the advantage of MCF and the laser cavity. The MFC works as a sensing element, filter, and coupler. In addition, the isopropanol with ultra-high photothermal coefficient is selectively filled into MFC in order to improve the temperature sensing response characteristics. The manufacturing process and working principle are introduced in detail, and the corresponding temperature characteristics of \u22121.29 nm/\u25e6C in the range of 20 \u25e6C\u201330 \u25e6C at the interval of 1 \u25e6C are realized. The sensitivity of \u22121.2 nm/\u25e6C is within the range of 20 \u25e6C\u201340 \u25e6C, with an interval of 5 \u25e6C. Thanks to the characteristics of laser, the signal-to-noise ratio of the designed sensing system is up to 35 dB, and the 3 \u2013 dB bandwidth is better than 0.2 nm. The stability of the structure was tested for 3 h, and the wavelength and intensity shift were better than 0.2 nm and 1 dB, respectively. This is of great potential value for the sensors to be used for life and health temperature monitoring, as well as real-time monitoring of ocean temperature."

It can be found that th p ak value of the interferen e spectrum correp nds to the spectrum of the laser output. It has been prove that MFC works well as a\nfilter and as a coupler. At the sam time, it can be observed that the linewidth i less than 0.2 nm and the signal-to-noise ratio is as high as 35 dB. Therefore, we formally monitored the te pera ure through the FRL sy tem. T e test results are sho n in Figure 10. I can be found th t the wavelength is still blue shift d. The linear fitting curve is shown in Figure 11, and the s nsitivity is up to \u22121.29 nm/\u00b0C, which s consistent with broadba d light sources.
