    "abstractText": "COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is widespread in all regions, and it disturbs host immune system functioning leading to extreme inflammatory reaction and hyperactivation of the immune response. Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) is preventive medicine against viral infections and a potent immune booster for inflammation-related diseases. We hypothesize that KSK and KSK similar plant compounds, might prevent or control the COVID-19 infection in the human body. 1,207 KSK and KSK similar compounds were listed and screened via the Swiss ADME tool and PAINS Remover; 303 compounds were filtered including active and similar drug compounds. The targets were retrieved from similar drugs of the active compounds of KSK. Finally, 573 genes were listed after several screening steps. Next, network analysis was performed to finalize the potential target gene: construction of protein-protein interaction of 573 genes using STRING, identifying top hub genes in Cytoscape plug-ins (MCODE and cytoHubba). These ten hub genes play a crucial role in the inflammatory response. Target-miRNA interaction was also constructed using the miRNet tool to interpret miRNAs of the target genes and their functions. Functional annotation was done via DAVID to gain a complete insight into the mechanism of the enriched pathways and other diseases related to the given target genes. In Molecular Docking analysis, IL10 attained top rank in Target-miRNA interaction and also the gene formed prominent exchanges with an excellent binding score (> = -8.0) against 19 compounds. Among them, Guggulsterone has an acute affinity score of -8.8 for IL10 and exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Molecular Dynamics simulation study also performed for IL10 and the interacting ligand compounds using GROMACS. Finally, Guggulsterone will be PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263 March 29, 2023 1 / 23 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

We hypothesize\nthat KSK and KSK similar plant compounds, might prevent or control the COVID-19 infec-\ntion in the human body. 1,207 KSK and KSK similar compounds were listed and screened\nvia the Swiss ADME tool and PAINS Remover; 303 compounds were filtered including\nactive and similar drug compounds. The targets were retrieved from similar drugs of the\nactive compounds of KSK. Finally, 573 genes were listed after several screening steps.\nNext, network analysis was performed to finalize the potential target gene: construction of\nprotein-protein interaction of 573 genes using STRING, identifying top hub genes in Cytos-\ncape plug-ins (MCODE and cytoHubba). These ten hub genes play a crucial role in the\ninflammatory response. Target-miRNA interaction was also constructed using the miRNet\ntool to interpret miRNAs of the target genes and their functions. Functional annotation was\ndone via DAVID to gain a complete insight into the mechanism of the enriched pathways\nand other diseases related to the given target genes. In Molecular Docking analysis, IL10\nattained top rank in Target-miRNA interaction and also the gene formed prominent exchanges with an excellent binding score (> = -8.0) against 19 compounds. Among them, Guggulsterone has an acute affinity score of -8.8 for IL10 and exhibits anti-inflammatory and\nimmunomodulatory properties.

            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread worldwide. It is emerging as the most dangerous infection affecting people. The first case was detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, and by January 2020, WHO acknowledged it as a worldwide health crisis for its rapid spreading [1]. COVID-19 belongs to the Human Betacoronavirus genera (along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), and they have many similarities, including immune escaping tactics, yet additional mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 remain undetected. Four structural proteins are S (spike) protein, M (membrane) protein, E (envelop) protein and N (nucleocapsid) protein helps the virus in pathogenesis [2]. There are five variants of COVID-19 which infect the people: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and currently omicron. COVID-19 severely infects the respiratory tract by creating a contact with the host\u2019s ACE2 protein, which leads to difficulty in breathing, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, cough, sneezing, fever, diarrhea, runny nose, sore throat are typical symptoms. Patients with COVID19 might also develop severe symptoms of diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and multiple organ failure [3].\nThe immune system protects the host from various infections caused by viruses and other\nmicroorganisms and produces antibodies to kill pathogens. It is the best defense against pathogens [4]. SARS-CoV-2 can disturb the normal functioning of the host\u2019s immune system, thus leading to weakened immunity against infection and unconstrained inflammatory responses [5]. The COVID-19 infection is bolstered by a hostile inflammatory reaction leading to the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm. The host\u2019s immune response becomes hyperactive in response to the COVID-19 infection, leading to extreme inflammatory reactions and an assembly of diseases [6, 7]. Elevated levels of IL2, IL1B, IL4, IL5, IL7, IL8 (CXCL8), IFNG (Interferon-gamma), IL10, and TNF-alpha were found by clinical laboratory experiments [8, 9]. However, pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as Tolllike receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR), are involved in the inflammatory response against severe oxidative stress. These are the primary reasons for initiating inflammatory responses by persuading pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression [10].\nKabasura Kudineer has been described as a capable medicinal concoction for curing several\nviral infections, currently used to prevent COVID-19 infection. Disease 15 herbal plants used in the KSK concoction (Zingiber officinale, Piper longum, Syzygium aromaticum, Tragia involucrata, Anacyclus pyrethrum, Hygrophila auriculata, Terminalia chebula, Justicia adhatoda, Coleus aromaticus, Saussurea costus, Tinospora cordifolia, Clerodendrum serratum, Andrographis paniculata, Sida acuta and Cyperus rotundus). They possess potent anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, inhibitor, hepato-protective, anti-pyretic, anti-asthmatic and immunomodulatory properties for managing several types of infections, especially in curing respiratory illnesses related to COVID-19. KSK could also be a potential immune booster for inflammation-related diseases [10, 11].\nThis study attempts to identify the natural compound and target via various computational\napproaches. The listed compounds were screened based on Lipinski violations, PAINS alerts, Bioavailability score, Solubility class and Synthetic accessibility in the SwissADME tool. A total of 573 genes were listed in which false positives were removed. Network analyses were done to find the top hub genes using STRING and Cytoscape (MCODE and cytoHubba).

Hydrophobic interactions are the strongest among the noncovalent exchanges, and they exhibit non-polar nature unlike hydrophilic. The top 9 compounds formed hydrophobic interactions with the target showing higher affinity in this study. In this part, Phenylalanine (PHE) residue comes under hydrophobic classification, and at times, aromatic side-chain might help for stacking interactions; six out of nine compounds formed hydrophobic interaction with PHE: Tubocurarine and Homoaromoline in IFNG_A, Guggulsterone, (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride, Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W in IL10. Tyrosine residue, which implies polar characteristics, is made from phenylalanine; seven out of nine compounds formed hydrophobic interaction with TYR: Tubocurarine, Homoaromoline, Triptocalline A and 24-hydroxyursolic acid in IFNG_A, Bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan2-yl) methanone in IL4, Guggulsterone and mulberrofuran W in IL10.

Isoleucine contains two non-H atoms linked with c-beta carbon leading to the form of rigid protein structure, and they also come under hydrophobic classification; four out of nine compounds formed hydrophobic interaction with ILE residue: Tubocurarine, Triptocalline A and 24-hydroxyursolic acid in IFNG_A, Guggulsterone in IL10. Both Leucine and Valine are very hydrophobic and have six compounds (Tubocurarine and Triptocalline A in IFNG_A and Guggulsterone, (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride, Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W in IL10), and three compounds ((R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride, Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W in IL10) interacted with individual residues in the respective target.

Methionine (MET) is very hydrophobic and interacts with two compounds: Triptocalline A in IFNG_A and Guggulsterone in IL10. Aspartic acid at most creates salt bridges or H bonds and sometimes hydrophobic interactions; two compounds formed hydrophobic interaction with ASP: Bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b] furan-2-yl) methanone in IL4 and (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride in IL10. Both Glutamine and Arginine (partially hydrophobic) are polar, and each amino acid forms hydrophobic interaction with Herkinorin in IL10 and Bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl) methanone in IL4 respectively (http://www.russelllab.org/aas/).\nb. Pi stacking interactions. Tryptophan and Phenylalanine contain aromatic side chains ready to have pi-stacking interaction with other small molecules. Tyrosine is also an aromatic amino acid that interacts with non-protein molecules through stacking interactions. Bis (6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl) methanone had pi-stacking interaction with TRP residue in IL4; three compounds formed pi-stacking interaction with PHE: (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride, Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W in IL10; Tubocurarine interacted with TYR residue of IFNG_A via pi-stacking interaction (http://www.russelllab.org/aas/).\nc. Hydrogen bond interactions. Hydrogen bonding is essential in facilitating the molecular interaction between molecules, potentiating diverse cellular functions [39]. Hydrogen bonds form between two molecules by HBond Donor and HBond Acceptor, thus stabilizing the interaction between the complexes formed. In the case of Lysine, Homoaromoline and 24-hydroxyursolic acid created HBond with LYS residue of IFNG_A and Bis(6-hydroxybenzo [b]furan-2-yl) methanone formed HBond with LYS residue of IL4; In case of Aspartic acid, 24-hydroxyursolic acid formed HBond with ASP residue of IFNG_A; In case of Cysteine, Bis (6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl) methanone formed HBond with CYS residue of IFNG_A [40].\nd. Pi-cation interactions. This is one of the most robust interactions among the non-covalent interactions. Arginine is aromatic and can form pi-cation interaction with small molecules. The compound Bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl)methanone created pi-cation interaction with ARG residue of IL4."

Fig 9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263.g009\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263 March 29, 2023 16 / 23\nexplains the RMSD results for the remaining three compounds (Guggulsterone, Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W) and the RMSD of backbone atoms of IL10. From the results obtained, the RMSD value reached 10\u00c5 for backbone conformation; the RMSD value is less than 1\u00c5 for ligand conformation. The RMSD value has very large deviation in the beginning in all three backbone conformation. In interaction with Guggulsterone, after certain period of time (from 50 ns) the backbone RMSD reaches the equilibrate state and fluctuations. In interaction with Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W, backbone RMSD had not reached equilibration state and fluctuation and was in constant dynamic state. Also the RMSD results of ligands shows that, Guggulsterone is considerably stable with respect to IL10 structure when compared to Herkinorin and mulberrofuran W stability. Despite of the above results, the RMSD of the backbone atoms for all the three results showed major deviation in the protein. Hence the protein showed major conformational change in the structure and the ligands might not be stable with the protein binding pocket. The local fluctuations in the protein RMSF results were shown in the Fig 10. The most fluctuated regions of the protein during the simulation were indicated in the resulted plots for each of the ligand molecules. The fluctuations were observed in both the ends of the protein than in the middle regions.\nFrom the RMSF results, the interactions with all the three ligand molecules showed more\nfluctuations in the protein. These results showed that the protein secondary structure elements might be less rigid in complex state with the respective ligand molecules."

            "text": "In our study, most of our targets formed hydrophobic interactions with the compounds, followed by Pi-stacking interaction, Pi-cation interaction and Hydrogen bond interaction. Most of the compounds have a hydrophobic core or non-polar. This is the reason for the interaction\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263.g010\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263 March 29, 2023 17 / 23\nwith the non-polar residues of the target proteins. The same condition is applicable in the case of partial polar residues in targets with compounds. Top protein-ligand interactions, IFNG-A with Tubocurarine (-10.2), Homoaromoline (-10.2), Triptocalline A (-9.4), 24-hydroxyursolic acid (-8.7); IL4 with bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl)methanone (-8.7); IL10 with Guggulsterone (-8.8), R,S-homoaromaline hydrochloride (-8.9), Herkinorin (-9.1), Mulberrofuran W (-8.8).\nIFNG-A plays a significant role in anti-viral, anti-microbial and anti-tumor activity in\nhumans. Typically, T-cells or Nature Killer cells produce the type II interferon for activating the immune system, thus enhancing the antigen [41, 42]. PubChem evidence suggests that Tubocurarine, despite having a top, binding score with the target, has toxic nature and hence it is neglected in our result. Homoaromoline compound is an alkaloid and presented in the roots of Thalictrum lucidum L. It has anti-microbial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis [43]. 24-hydroxyursolic acid has chemo-preventive nature and is presented in the Diospyros kaki (Persimmon) plant. It stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus inhibiting the cyclooxygenase activity (COX-2) [44].\nIL4 plays a part of the role in B-cell activation. Also, it stimulates the expression of MHC II\nmolecules on quiescent B-cells, thus increasing the expression of immunoglobulin molecules such as IgE and IgG1 [45]. Bis(6-hydroxybenzo[b]furan-2-yl)methanone is a synthetic compound, but no complete information is available on the compound [46].\nIL10 plays a role in an anti-inflammatory function where it binds with the heterotetrameric\nreceptor. The heterotetrameric receptors are IL10RA and IL10RB, which activates the JAK1 and STAT2 [47]. It restricts the antigen-presenting cells, thus reducing the expression of MHC-II and co-stimulatory molecules owing to inhibiting the T cell activation [48]. Guggulsterone compound properties suggest anti-inflammatory function, anti-hyperlipidemic, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and craving stimulus activity. It is a bioactive compound present in plants such as Commiphora mukul and Commiphora wighti. Our study suggests that in the oral, TPSA, Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration and absorption properties are interconnected. Clinical studies supported that Guggulsterone reduces the cholesterol level in the body. It has a tremendous potential immunomodulatory effect, yet in vitro studies are insufficient to validate the results regarding Guggulsterone. But our in-silico study strongly supports that Guggulsterone is the potential compound for the IL10 gene [49]. Literature evidence is not available for (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride. Up-to-date, no research works were documented on (R, S)-homoaromaline hydrochloride compound. Herkinorin is the first semisynthetic analog of Salvinorin A. Salvinorin A present in the Salvia divinorum (Lamiaceae) plant. Herkinorin has anti-nociceptive properties and has been evaluated in a study elucidating inflammatory aches in rats [50]. Mulberrofuran W is a bioactive compound present in the Morus plant. It has anti-hyperglycemic activity via inhibiting the tyrosine phosphatase and anti-carcinogenic activity via inhibiting the hypoxia-activated HIF-1 \u03b1 [51]. Target gene and miRNA network study implies that IL10 attained 1st rank on betweenness and degree score. We suggest that the target IL10 interacted well with most of the compounds, especially with Guggulsterone having a good binding affinity score (-8.8). Guggulsterone has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties for enhancing the host immune system against COVID-19 infection. In Target-miRNA network study, IL10 associated with hsa-let7c-5p, hsa-mir-19a-3p, hsa-mir-21-5p, hsa-mir-27a-3p, hsa-mir-98-5p, hsa-mir-106a-5p, hsamir-107, hsa-mir-34a-5p, hsa-mir-194-5p, hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-503-3p, hsa-mir-671-5p, hsa-mir-210-3p, hsa-mir-30d-5p. These associated miRNAs have been linked with the following diseases such as brain-related diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer (gastric, esophageal, lung, cervical, pancreatic, bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, prostate, skin, thyroid and other types of cancer), diabetes, epilepsy, kidney disease and several types of viral infections.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282263 March 29, 2023 18 / 23\nFrom the functional annotation results, other diseases related to the genes have been\ndirectly or indirectly linked with the COVID-19 infection. IL10 have found to be associated with conditions such as Leishmaniasis (Visceral, Cutaneous, and Urban cutaneous), Colitis, Arthritis (Experimental, Adjuvant-induced and Collagen-induced), Inflammation, Bright Disease, Glomerulonephritis, Allergic reaction, Hypersensitivity and Rheumatoid Arthritis have been highlighted in this study. IFN-gamma production is the protective immune response against the COVID-19 infection and the resultant Natural Killer cells and CD8+ T-cell activation. At the same time, IFNG is the Th1 immune response against Leimaniasis; a case study also reported co-infection of Leimaniasis with COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient [52]. A case study regarding the GI system proposed that Ulcerative colitis has been diagnosed in a patient with diarrhea and abdominal pain following post-treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Data suggests that COVID-19 might influence the GI system by ACE2 protein expression [53]). One of the most common symptoms occurring in COVID-19 patients is arthralgia. However, COVID-19 might attack the musculoskeletal system of the host in its infection or post-infection stage, leading to inflammatory arthritis, but rheumatoid manifestations are yet to be confirmed [54]. Undeniably, smokers seem to be more susceptible to developing cancer and lung diseases and are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 pneumonia because smoking can increase ACE2 protein expression, leading to the entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the host more quickly than usual [55]. The conformational changes were more in the protein backbone after protein-ligand complex interaction. Though the results of MD simulation for IL10 protein and ligand molecule complexes might not showed favorable results, the functions of the protein cannot be interpreted only based on the computational analyses."

            "text": "Overall, our study identified many of the similar compounds showing interactions between target genes; but the Guggulsterone has reached top position among all the interactions and comparing with the previous literatures. However the MD simulation results were not promising regarding protein-ligand complexes, we cannot rely only on the computational results and might do experimental studies in future to validate the functions of IL10 and Guggulsterone in COVID severe cases. Based on this whole analysis, we identified IL10 plays a main role in antiinflammatory function and which reacts to Guggulsterone in SARS-CoV-2. The same IL10 attained the top position in miRNA network study and integrated network analysis. In specific, we recommend the compound Guggulsterone for the target IL10 against COVID-19 infection. Utterly, this is the first in silico study conducted with Guggulsterone against IL10 in COVID19 infection. So, we hope that in future in vitro studies might confirm our study.\nSupporting information"
