It is even said that farmers, agriculture, and rural areas are the biggest beneficiaries of the EU membership and that beneficial changes are visible to the naked eye. Well, about that... Are all these changes beneficial? Are they really so profound? Are they all visible to the \u201cnaked eye\u201d?\nThe European Fund for the Development of Polish Villages Foundation launched the Rural Development Monitoring (MROW) research project in 2012 in conjunction with the Institute of Rural and Agricultural Development of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Two reports on the study have been published so far: Stage I MROW 2014 and Stage II MROW 2016. This English-language book, intended for readers unfamiliar with the specifics of socio-economic transformation in Poland, is a collection of the key findings of MROW studies on spatial diversification of rural development to date. Information about the historical origins of regional variations in rural development was included along with scientific data.\nMROW is Poland\u2019s only project of its kind, covering rural areas on a gmina level throughout the country. Its data is sourced from dozens of public institutions along with polls conducted in each gmina. Two major assets of this project are the immutability of its research methods and cyclical analysis of the same data sets. The project\u2019s long-term scope and interval method of monitoring changes are intended to provide constant observation of socio-economic processes, as well as verification of the accuracy of currently deployed pro-development instruments.\nPreparing a study of this complexity would be impossible without the help of numerous individuals and institutions.

            "text": "Rural Development Monitoring (MROW) is a joint project of the European Fund for Polish Rural Development (EFWRP)foundation and the Institute of Rural and Agricultural Development by the Polish Academy of Sciences (IRWiR PAN), which was initiated in 2012. It is intended as a systematic examination of the changes in spatial diversification of socio-economic development of rural areas in Poland. The project focuses on the key economic and extra-economic aspects of rural development, including the deagrarization of local economies, characteristics of the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors, spatial accessibility of gminas, local public finance, labor markets, demographic changes, education, social activity, wealth of local communities, and living conditions. Research is conducted in all 2173 rural and urban-rural gminas1 of Poland. The data used in the project was obtained from numerous public institutions, including the Central Statistical Office (GUS), Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), Agricultural Social Insurance Fund (KRUS), Central Examination Commission (CKE), Office of Electronic Communications (UKE), Agency for Restructuring and Modernization of Agriculture (ARiMR), the ministries, and Offices of Marshals, as well as original primary data collected from gmina polling places.\nMROW is a multi-year program divided into stages. Two years ago, after the completion of Stage I of the research (MROW 2014), a report was published and presented at a conference. Research for the recently completed Stage II (MROW 2016) was conducted on an identical set of data following the previously assumed methodology. Stage I used data\n9\n1 Gmina (NUTS 5) is the smallest unit of territorial division in Poland; gminas are self-governed. Rural gminas (rural areas within urban-rural gminas) have, on average, approximately 7000 inhabitants and cover 150 sq. km.\nfor the 2009\u20132011 period (depending on availability), assuming 2010 as the base year, while Stage II focused on the 2011\u20132013 period, assuming 2012 as base. The authors of this study realize that the short two-year period between its subsequent stages does not allow a fully categorical evaluation of the changes, and in some cases it merely outlines certain trends. However, the accumulated bulk of empirical documentation contains findings confirming widely known issues which have not been sufficiently documented in studies and scientific literature to date. Stage I provided information about the level and structure of socio-economic development of rural areas (a snapshot of socio-economic situation on the local level), while Stage II added knowledge about the changes in development processes and factors influencing their dynamics (the pace and direction of the changes).\nNames of historical and present-day administrative territorial divisions and geographic regions of Poland are used throughout the text. Readers unfamiliar with these terms and the historical origins of Poland's spatial diversification characteristics may discover them with the aid of Appendix B; this Appendix also contains a number of maps which may be helpful in understanding the specifics of the area, including segments of Poland's settlement network and population. Appendix A contains a list of empirical indicators used in the study along with their spatial distribution.\n* * *\nThe specifics of the Rural Development Monitoring program (MROW) result from four main methodological assumptions underlying the study.\n1) It is conducted in all rural and urban-rural gminas; 2) It was planned as a long-term, cyclical research project; 3) Its research methodology specifies 11 components which determine\nrural area development. These components are differently weighted; 4) Multiple factor analysis of the data obtained from numerous sources and institutions is expected to allow us to determine the factors influencing gmina development.\nThe effectiveness and efficiency of rural policies have been debated in many circles, including the academia, ever since the beginning of the\n10\nIntroduction\npolitical transformation in Poland. These debates focused mainly on production issues and economic problems of agriculture and other segments of food economy, particularly in the first years of transformation and after accession to the European Union. This was obviously caused by the contemporary pressure of social and economic needs, public interest, and political parties and circles. Rural areas had to extricate themselves from a deep crisis of unemployment, diminishing income, and lack of perspectives.\nWhile evaluating the widely known accomplishments of rural development, agriculture, and the food sector, we cannot overlook the fact that not all regions and not all rural residents benefited from them equally. The theory that a rising tide lifts all boats, which was popular some years ago, did not come entirely true. Rural areas of Eastern Poland, for example in the Lubelskie voivodeship, still remain among the poorest regions in the EU. This is not the only reason for the continuation of debate on this subject while utilizing reliable data and information. The MROW results from two years ago already signaled the need for such discussion. The latest report from the study presents the ways in which various types of gminas, exhibiting different economic and social structures along with differences in their location relative to the urban network, responded to development opportunities.\nIntroduction\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nThe definition of socio-economic development assumed by this project serves to clarify the concept underlying the study. According to this definition, socio-economic development is the process of transforming rural areas into an inhabitant-friendly environment, i.e. one which allows them to fulfill their needs and aspirations, particularly with regard to labor conditions and obtaining satisfactory income; access to public services and broadly defined cultural goods; a sense of participation in the life of the local community; a sense of agency in the ongoing transformation; etc. Meanwhile, a level of socio-economic development describes the degree of transformation of the social and economic environment in the directions specified above; therefore, it describes the present state. Development is a process \u2013 a sequence of transformations from one state into another. This meaning of \u201csocio-economic development\u201d, as well as its translation into empirical terms, were assumed for the purpose of this study; it is not the authors\u2019 intention to create universal and widely enforced definitions.\nAccording to the research assumptions, observations are conducted in the smallest administrative units \u2013 gminas. This is particularly vital for research purposes; gminas \u2013 sometimes even adjacent ones \u2013 differ in many respects. Accounting for these differences exposes a number of phenomena which cannot be observed in averaged data from larger areas, like powiats or voivodeships. Therefore, the gathering of data and information aggregated by gmina is justified, as this picture (presented in the form of maps, tables, and graphs following statistical calculations) can be used to reach general conclusions about the diversification of rural areas. This method enables us to present complete data on individual gminas and to segment it on a regional (voivodeship) level.\n13\nThe study aims to provide answers to the following questions: Why do changes occur faster in some gminas and slower in others? What are the local and regional obstacles to rural socio-economic development? What aids the latter? What paths (profiles) of development are available to various types of local systems? To what extent are they being utilized by local governments? What causes the differences in the pace of development throughout the country?\nThe answers are a helpful tool for the evaluation of the instruments and development of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the EU cohesion policy (CP), which have undeniably beneficial results for rural areas. The current amount of financial support for rural Poland is unprecedented; the appreciation of this support is evidenced in the high levels of acceptance of these policies among farmers and rural inhabitants. However, evaluation cannot be limited to totaling up the amount of funding \u2013 the key criteria in this case are the effects of financial aid and the efficiency of policy instruments. Due to the characteristics of its research methods, the wide scope of data being gathered, and the interpretation of results, MROW may provide large amounts of valuable information for this purpose.\nAgain: this project is a study of gminas. However, it does not aim to examine individual units; its goal is to determine development mechanisms and causes of spatial diversification, and to identify groups of similar gminas. The effectiveness of regional policy and various public policies can be evaluated according to practically implemented development instruments, activities strengthening regional cohesion (EU cohesion policy), which have to be tailored to sets of gminas with similar development conditions.\nAnother significant advantage lies in the methodology used in the MROW project, including the broad substantive scope of its data, multiple factor analysis of socio-economic phenomena, repeatability of studies, and the option to compare their results. It could be said that these characteristics make the MROW project a useful diagnostic tool for rural development policies, while providing reliable information about the outcome of earlier activities and the premises for subsequent decisions. This will also be an important tool for gmina authorities, which will provide them with data useful for evaluating their competitive advantages and examining their position relative to other units. This is an innovative study of territorial development, which utilizes multiple factor analysis of\n14\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\ndynamics. Significant elements of rural area development and their interactions, not just individual indicators of changes within a single parameter (even a vital one like GDP), are taken into account.\nMROW studies are conducted according to a procedure specifying 11 components of gmina development. These components are synthetic in the sense of requiring further operationalization, i.e. conversion into empirical indicators and defining their relationships. They are the characteristics of social and economic phenomena carrying the greatest significance for rural areas: spatial accessibility, social and economic situation, and quality of life indicators. Since all these components vary in importance in gmina development, they were assigned specific weights in order to retain their respective proportions (Fig.1.).\n15\nChapter 1.

However, this is not the case. Rural areas are a social and economic environment where agriculture plays a significant role; its importance is constant or even heightened in some ways, but decreased in others. The significance of agriculture is constant with regard to the labor market balance, food security issues, landscape shaping, and preservation of natural environment; it decreases due to its diminishing share in the nation\u2019s economy (GDP production), income generation, providing employment, etc.\nIt should be emphasized that we appreciate the role of agriculture as a significant economic function developed in rural areas; however, it is not the sole function in these areas2. Moreover, the role of agriculture as a source of income for rural populations is decreasing; the share of rural labor force employed in agricultural production is likewise diminishing. The structural problems of agriculture (land fragmentation, low labor efficiency) should be solved outside of it by increasing non-agricultural employment, which will in turn facilitate the decrease of employment in agriculture. This is one of the basic challenges faced by rural Poland. As the number of non-agricultural jobs in local labor markets is too low, limiting employment in agriculture becomes very difficult; as a result, structural changes in farming occur at a slow pace. Moreover, traditional family farms \u2013 which facilitate survival in periods of overstaffing (hidden unemployment) \u2013 are predominant in agriculture in most of the country. High employment in agricultural production results in relatively low income per worker.\nThis is why the factors describing the economic situation, including the degree of local economy deagrarization, were weighted as the most significant in the MROW project. Deagrarization is defined as a growing importance of non-agricultural functions in providing income to the inhabitants; that is, a departure from the dominance of the agricultural function in the economic structure of rural areas. The need to deagrarize rural economies lies at the base of the concepts of multifunctional rural development, permanent development, and harmonious development. As a component of economic development it\n16\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\n2 More in: [K\u0142odzi\u0144ski 2014; Czarnecki, K\u0142odzi\u0144ski, Stanny 205; Baer-Nawrocka, Poczta 2016].\nis therefore both extremely important and linked to social development. The links are formed by the development of public services and increasing employment in said services, as well as by growing possibility of employment matching the inhabitants\u2019 aspirations \u2013 not just in agriculture and broadly defined agricultural support. This is why deagrarization is being treated as a stimulant of development; it creates favorable conditions for structural changes within the agricultural function, particularly with regard to issues related to agricultural overstaffing in family holdings (hidden unemployment). It is worth noting that the continuing position of agriculture as the dominant function of rural areas leads to population decline, changes in demographic structure, and \u2013 in the long run \u2013 depopulation and economic marginalization.\nFar from depreciating the role of agriculture in rural areas, this approach highlights the structural problems which should be solved not only in agriculture itself, but also \u2013 or mainly \u2013 by engaging its environment. This is why our studies focus on rural areas as a socio-economic environment, not on agriculture as the dominant economic function in rural areas.\nSocio-economic development of local systems is significantly influenced by the accessibility of their space \u2013 both external, concerning the people, goods, and services coming into the gmina (or originating from it), and internal, concerning the ease of commuting between various settlements within a given unit. Spatial accessibility is a noteworthy component, as the conversion of public transport to market-based operation caused its deterioration: an increased number of villages without regular bus service (as well as train service, but rail transport is less vital for rural areas) and reduced services on existing routes. This is particularly noticeable in villages located far from national and voivodship routes. Though public transport is being supplanted by private car ownership, there are several issues with the latter solution: cars are expensive for rural residents; many vehicles used by rural populations are old, technically unsound models, leading to environmental and safety consequences; it contributes to the social exclusion of the poor and people living alone, particularly the elderly.\nLow spatial accessibility also hinders business development within gminas. It may present an obstacle to broadening their reach; given the\n17\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nrelatively low scale of demand in small spatial units, this is a significant issue. It also limits labor market accessibility to the immediate area.\nDescribed above, deagrarization of local economy refers to the proportions of agriculture and non-agricultural activities in various sectors. However, both high and low levels of deagrarization may coexist with various development levels of these sectors. Our study separates agricultural sector characteristics from local environmental factors, agricultural production structures, etc.: we do not consider soil quality, vegetative phase length, water regimes, and the like. For the purpose of our analysis (and due to data availability) we have assumed the following definition of a well-developed agricultural sector: one composed of relatively large, market-oriented farms managed by farmers with a solid background in this profession. We have based our understanding of agricultural sector characteristics on the fact that Poland\u2019s agriculture is evolving from traditional family farms \u2013 producing many types of goods in small amounts, both for sale and family use \u2013 toward specialized, strongly market-oriented agricultural businesses.\nSpatially diverse to a large extent, these changes are advanced mainly in regions where fragmentation of agriculture is relatively low. While small farms are frequently considered to be performing social functions in the agricultural sector, the process of production concentration is quite advanced: approximately 20% of farms produce approximately 3/4 of agricultural commodity goods; this fact may be considered an indicator of the stage of agricultural transformation.\nThese changes influence local employment values and migration trends. In the most general terms, they lower the demand for agricultural labor, freeing up labor resources; the workers can switch to the non-agricultural sector of local labor markets (working in the village or a nearby town), move to a big city (which is reflected in migratory flows), or remain on the farm, increasing agricultural overstaffing (hidden unemployment). Demographic shifts resulting in decreased or increased labor force reproduction (the ratio of young people entering the labor market to workers nearing retirement age) should also be taken into account.\nRural population loss due to long-term migrations, strongly selective by age, sex, education, etc., can have unfavorable consequences for rural\n18\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nareas. The results of these trends (population aging, gender imbalance, low social capital, etc.) can be seen in the depopulating areas of Poland. However, remaining on the family farm to perform economically unwarranted labor also has negative consequences, for example low per-capita income. In these cases farms perform a social function, providing a sense of economic security to family members incapable of finding external employment. The most favorable outcome for people whose work in agriculture is superfluous involves finding nonagricultural employment while remaining a rural inhabitant; this leads to the development of non-agricultural functions3: residential (dormitory community) in case of commuting to work, and service or manufacturing in case of the workplace\u2019s proximity to the place of residence. Multifunctional rural development does not cause issues related to the emergence of unfavorable demographic structures.\nThe excessively high share of agriculture in economic structures is a problem for a large percentage of Polish rural areas. Certain sub-regions of the country exhibit advanced depopulation, while others experience agricultural overstaffing far in excess of actual labor demands. In extreme cases the agricultural function dominates to such an extent that almost all non-agricultural jobs within a gmina are public services (local administration, schools, clinics, etc.).\nRural labor markets possess many features that complicate the classic supply and demand scenario. Some of these issues stem from their spatial characteristics: a large share of rural labor force is spatially immobile (due to familial relationships with farm workers). Moreover, the classic scenario describes a market-based economy; employment in rural areas largely involves working on privately-owned farms which are family businesses. While the dominance of family farming in Polish agriculture is indisputable, the complexity of this issue is not widely understood4. This makes local labor market balance another complex component; it encompasses phenomena related to agricultural and non-agricultural employment, as well as to shaping\n19\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\n3 The non-agricultural sector is composed of all businesses that employ workers except for those involved in agricultural production. The agricultural sector therefore comprises both family and industrial farms, while agricultural service, farm supply, and produce purchasing and processing businesses belong to the non-agricultural sector. 4 More in: [Rosner, Stanny 2008 a, b; Rosner (ed.) 2009; Stanny 2010].\nlabor resource structures responsible for further development of the gmina. Therefore, in addition to the rate of registered unemployment, the study also examined indicators linked to hidden unemployment in agriculture, aging labor force, and labor market appeal to migrants.\nThe component of local public finance is interpreted far more broadly than just the budgetary conditions of a given gmina. On the one hand, it indicates the level of budget revenue that the local economy is able to generate, and on the other hand, the actual possibilities for improvement concerning public works: infrastructure development, improved availability of public services, etc. Playing an important indicative role, data about revenue also provides indirect information about the previous levels of economic development, particularly the accumulated wealth from earlier periods \u2013 the assets of the gmina (e. g. infrastructure).\nSimilarly, demographic issues are a highly noteworthy component, including an evaluation of the impact of internal migrations (within the country) on rural communities. The migrants are mainly young, educated, resourceful, and enterprising; as a result, their home regions undergo distinct changes in demographic structures \u2013 population ageing and shortages of educated inhabitants, especially young, educated women. Low levels of human and social capital in the regions of migratory outflows cause difficulties in the development of nonagricultural functions and lack of interest in technological and social innovations.\nMultifunctional rural development, considered by the authors to be the most favorable direction of development in Poland, encounters numerous obstacles on a local level. One of these is the low competitive potential of rural residents caused by unfavorable educational demographics. The recent rapid increase in educational attainment mostly involves the youngest generations, which lack experience in putting their knowledge to use. Additionally, this increase is due in part to the creation of private universities; in most cases their quality of education is lower than that of traditional public tertiary schools.\nMeasuring educational issues was challenging due to low availability of relevant data. The researchers planned to evaluate both the structure of educational attainment and the effects of local school systems. However, the study had to be based on indicators that\n20\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nindirectly define these phenomenas: 1) the effect of demand and accessibility of educational services offered by the gmina, 2) the quality of schooling on available levels of education, and 3) perception of the value of education in local communities. This is a vital component of the study, as evidenced by the fact that in many gmina councils (elected bodies which decide on issues in the purview of local governments) most council members do not have a high school diploma.\nThe availability of data on social activity was also extremely limited; nevertheless, this component of social development is highly important given the situation in Poland. In the period preceding the 1989 regime change, this type of activity was strictly superficial \u2013 bureaucratically planned and often simply staged, like subbotniks, ostensibly voluntary unpaid labor that had little in common with actual social activity. Similarly, various institutions and associations, like labor unions, the Red Cross, or the Polish-Soviet Friendship Society, were only for show; schoolchildren were often automatically enrolled to bolster their ranks and generating good publicity was their only purpose.\nTrue social activity began to ramp up after 1989, but suspicious attitudes stemming from earlier experiences were an obstacle to further development. Though collaborative initiatives for the betterment of local communities began to appear, attempts to register them were met with hostility. The availability of statistical data on social activity is therefore low. Voter turnout and civic activity statistics were included in the data set as a substitute; we have assumed that participation in elections is an indicator of interest in social issues (including local community issues).\nSocio-economic development can be harmonious when it does not introduce excessive disparities between social groups, but it can also stimulate social stratification. Some consequences of rapid development are, in a way, natural \u2013 for example, new generations of rural residents have higher levels of educational attainment than their parents \u2013 but this in turn may influence socially unacceptable inequalities (e.g. income inequality). We used the cohesiveness and wealth of local communities component to evaluate these issues in our study. \u201cWealth\u201d describes the utilization of the benefits of economic development in the local community; \u201ccohesiveness\u201d refers to the\n21\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nnumerical size of groups with limited access to these benefits. By including this component in the characteristics of socio-economic development we intended to reward the types of transformation free of the \u201cside effects\u201d of detrimental social phenomena. The marginalization of certain social groups, high percentage of residents dependent on public assistance, and similar phenomena may in time block further development.\nThere are three reasons for the inclusion of housing conditions as a separate component of socio-economic development level. Firstly, the list of components was perceived to be missing a direct indicator of quality of life; while some aspects of quality of life had been previously taken into consideration, the picture was far from complete. Secondly, housing has a particularly high importance in Poland due to shortages, extremely high prices relative to population income, and low technical standards in a large part of rural settlements. Thirdly, the presence of technical infrastructure in housing indicates its availability to nearby agricultural holdings and non-agricultural business entities in the gmina. The list of empirical indicators for this component includes ones that recently underwent relatively rapid development due to EU funding for rural areas.\nThe selection of components used to define rural socio-economic development evidently took a number of local factors into account: the current social and political situation in Poland, current development levels, and desirable paths of transformation. Therefore, the proposed definition is not universal. Most likely a different set of components should be used for countries at other stages of development \u2013 like highly developed European countries, where agricultural employment accounts for 1-2% of total employment and land concentration is much more advanced. The definition used in this study, along with its explication, is therefore relativized to the specific conditions present in Poland, which is the only post-Communist country with a lasting predominance of family farming.\nChapter 1. Goals and research assumptions of the MROW project\nThe application of statistical procedures in accordance with the analytical plan outlined above resulted in defining types of gminas which exhibit similarities in development structure, that is: showing a similar combination of levels of the 11 components (listed in Fig. 1). This method determined 7 types of gminas which were analyzed in the MROW Project (Fig. 2 and table 1). This typology may be used to formulate conclusions and recommendations according to economic policies and practice, but its main value is analytical significance5. The statistical procedures make use of Diday\u2019s dynamic clouds method [Diday et al. 1994; Griguolo 2008]6.\nThe first type of gminas, concentrating the majority of them (23% of the total), is spatially concentrated in Central and Eastern Poland. Apart from that location, this type is otherwise very rare. However, the\n23\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\n5 Typologically different approaches are described in: [Copus, Psaltopoulos, Skuras, Terluin, Weingarten, 2008; Weingarten, Copus, Psaltopoulos, Skuras, Terluin, 2010]; methodologically analogous: [Santacroce 1988, Santacroce 2001]; 6 A method of cluster analysis based on the gravitational model in a multidimensional space. Every unit (gmina) subject to analysis was given a certain mass (gmina\u2019s weight). Furthermore, every unit is described using n rates. This allows to pinpoint particular units in the ndimensional space. In this space appear concentrations of units in some of its parts, others are scarcely occupied (or even empty). Concentration of units in the space (swarms, clouds) means that these units are similar, the distance between such clusters is the measure of the difference between units belonging to different clusters (clouds). Assigning weights to individual units allows to define the gravity center of the whole system and gravity centers of individual parts of the space attracting units and producing their clusters. The location of the gravity center of such a part of the space, its parameters in the system of co-ordinates characterize the type of units composing the cluster. (This characteristic does not have to correspond to any specific gmina; it is an averaged characteristic of similar gminas, i.e. those sharing the same cluster in the space). The statistical characteristics of the clusters are depicted in the table. The types were assigned labels to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the results; note that the authors realize that these names/labels are greatly simplified.\ngminas are inhabited by only 15.6% of the rural population of the country, which means that the majority of them belong to the areas with a relatively low population density.\n24\nChapter 2.

The deagrarization of the economic structure is much less advanced, not exceeding the average in the country\u2019s rural areas. They significantly stick out from other gminas due to their unfavourable spatial accessibility, demographic structure of the population, living conditions, and poor non-agricultural sector. The prevalence of the agricultural function and the weakness of the nonagricultural sector mean that non-agricultural jobs are to a large extent concentrated in institutions of the local administration and those rendering public services (health care, education, police, etc.), with the state continuing to be the most important employer for the nonagricultural population in the areas. The characteristics of the agricultural sector are the only component indicating a slightly above-average level of the development in the gminas of the first type.\nThe second type of gminas features gminas with the dominance of large-scale agriculture. There are 399 such gminas (18% of the total covered by the study) and they are inhabited by 14.8% of the rural population of the country. The gminas concentrate in the first place in the so-called Western and Northern Territories of Poland (incorporated into the territory of Poland after the Second World War). The region is usually called a \u201cpost-state farm region\u201d due to the fact that the social state agricultural economy concentrated in there before 1990. Gminas of the type are also located, although in smaller gatherings, in Wielkopolska and the Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodship. Apart from those regions, there are few gminas of this type and they do not come in greater gatherings anywhere else.\nThe gminas are marked by an average level of the deagrarization of the local economic structure in comparison with the remaining ones, whereby the characteristics of the agricultural sector are very favourable, while the one of the non-agricultural sector does not differ form average values for the whole of rural areas. They are distinguished by a favourable demographic structure of the population that influences the degree of instability of the labour market. The characteristics of the remaining social matters are not favourable in comparison with the country\u2019s average.\nIt is worth pointing out that the gminas falling under the second type are never located in the direct neighbourhood of regional centres, larger or medium cities.\n26\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\nThe third type of gminas resembles the first type to some extent; however, they differ from the ones of the first type both in terms of a greater spatial accessibility, as well as a greater degree of deagrarization of the local economy, although it is below the country\u2019s average. On the other hand, the development level of the non-agricultural sector is higher than in the case of the first type, approximately equal to the average of the whole study population.\nSpatial distribution makes them similar to the first type. Almost all of them are located in Central and Eastern Poland (the territory of the former Russian partition) and do not neighbour with large and medium cities. This territory (apart from the vicinity of larger urban centres) is in fact dominated by the third and first type of gminas with a difference between them being that the gminas of the first type are located more peripherally and the ones belonging to the third type are located closer to communication routes and urban centres. In comparison with the first type, the third type is marked by a better situation on the labor market, better housing conditions, smaller problems in terms of the demographic structure and education. As long as the gminas of the first type were characterized as units with the dominance of traditional agriculture, traditional structures started to undergo favorable modifications in the gminas of the third type that may be characterized as an intermediary type with the prevailing agricultural function.\nExcluding the territory of the former Russian partition, the gminas of the third type are located in the form of small gatherings mainly in the territory of the former Galicia (in particular in the Podkarpackie voivodship and in the northern part of the Ma\u0142opolskie voivodship) and isolated areas in the region of the Sudetes. The group of gminas consists of 466 units (21%), inhabited by 20% of the country\u2019s rural population. The above means that the first and third types, characteristic mainly for the total of Central and Eastern Poland, is equivalent to 44% of the total of rural gminas and rural areas in urban and rural gminas in Poland.\nThe fourth type of gminas is less numerous, there are 187 of them (9%), but they are inhabited by as much as 12.6% of the rural population. They are characterized by good accessibility, a high level of deagrarization of the economy, a very poor agricultural sector and an average level of the development of the non-agricultural sector. In\n27\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\nshort, they may be described as gminas of multi-income, fragmented agriculture (formerly called worker-peasant gminas). Their relatively good \u201caccessibility\u201d, i.e. the availability of the road and communication network, is related to the character of the settlement network; the gminas are characterized by the existence of big or very big villages (often with more than 1000 residents, which is approximately four times more than the country\u2019s average), which is indirectly related to the fragmentation of agriculture with the average area of a farm in many gminas amounting to approx. 3 ha.\nAlmost all gminas of the fourth type concentrate in three voivodships: Ma\u0142opolskie, Podkarpackie, and \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie. Single gminas of the type are also located in \u0141\u00f3dzkie, Lubelskie, as well as on the borders of the area within the impact of Warsaw, their character is, however, different from the one characteristic of south-eastern Poland. Generally, the fourth type comes into existence when villages transform into workers\u2019 rural housing estates as a result of investment processes. However, the type came into existence much earlier (from the end of the 20th century) and was subject to other factors in the southern part of the country. The factors include inter alia: high population density in the vicinity of the main center of the early statehood (Krakow), as well as the character of the the former Emancipation Act (peasant enfranchisement) and land inheritance customs.\nThe gminas of the fourth type are additionally characterized by good education and a favorable demographic structure. It is worth adding that definitive migrations from that region are relatively scarce, while recently the flow from urban areas to villages of that region has been far greater.\nThe fifth type of gminas includes 382 units (18%) that are inhabited by 19.3% of the total rural population. The majority of gminas are located in the western part of the country, while their largest gatherings may be found in the Wielkopolskie voivodship, where they dominate (excluding the neighborhood areas of Pozna\u0144 metropolis), as well as in Dolny \u015al\u0105sk and \u015al\u0105sk Opolski. In the eastern and central part of Poland, the gminas of the fifth type are located either in sub-urban areas, where the strong impact of the main city is still growing, or at the outskirts of the urban agglomeration (Warsaw), where they are located along main communication routes extending beyond the highly urbanized area.\n28\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\nA characteristic of the gminas of the fifth type is that the deagrarization process is advanced in there, while exceeding the country\u2019s average and being similar to the level characteristic of the fourth type. However, both the agricultural and non-agricultural function distinguish the gminas in a positive way. Therefore, the gminas of the type may be characterized as multifunctional gminas featuring balance between the agricultural and non-agricultural sector.\nIn comparison with all rural gminas and rural areas in urban and rural gminas, the gminas of the fifth type are characterised by relatively favorable components of the development in terms of social matters, i.e. the activity of local communities, resourcefulness and cohesion, demographic structure, as well as the level of balance on the labor market. It is worth pointing out that the gminas of the fifth type are the only ones, excluding the sixth and seventh type (which are strictly linked with the economy of neighboring urban centers), that enjoy sound local public funding above the average level.\nGminas of the sixth and seventh type are relatively few, as they constitute the total of 249 units (11%) inhabited by as much as 17.7% of the rural population of Poland. As mentioned above, the gminas derive benefits from their location in the vicinity of urban areas and in terms of economy they depend more or less on the neighboring city. However, the links are weaker in case of the sixth type and very strong in case of the seventh type of gminas.\nThere are 197 gminas of the sixth type (9%) and they are inhabited by 13.5% of the rural population. They are well communicated, while their economy is highly deagrarianised. The agricultural function is weak, with other non-agricultural functions developing, which allows to classify the gminas of the sixth type as urbanized gminas with reduced agricultural function. The gminas of the sixth type are located almost exclusively in the vicinity of big cities and industrial centers.\nThe characteristics of the gminas are particularly favorable in terms of education and key competences of their residents, prosperity and social cohesion and housing conditions. This is determined by the fact that they comprise both sub-urban residential districts for migrants from cities as well as rural areas located far from the city.\nThe last seventh type of gminas consists of only 52 gminas (2%) and is inhabited by 4.2% of the rural population. The gminas of the\n29\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\ntype are strongly urbanized, which is significantly different from the average values for rural areas in terms of each component, excluding the characteristics of the agricultural sector. However, even the agricultural sector in this case, although rating below the average of the Polish rural gminas, is better developed than in case of the fourth or sixth type (probably due to a high share and the so-called special branches within agriculture that operate in the gminas).\nThe gminas of the seventh type create the first ring of rural areas around Warsaw and Pozna\u0144. They are also located in the direct neighborhood of the remaining largest regional centers, as the first ring of the gminas of the seventh and sixth type. The characteristics of the gminas make it possible to conclude that they will be administratively incorporated into the cities sooner or later, because at least some of them are functionally an urban area, often predominantly consisting of residential estates (dormitory suburbs) for people working in the city center.\n* * *\nAccording to the research assumptions, every gmina is the social environment of its inhabitants; the environment may or may not be friendly. Naturally, the practical meaning of \u201cinhabitant-friendly environment\u201d is different in gminas in e.g. Ma\u0142opolska and Wielkopolska, but resident satisfaction metrics remain the same: possibility of finding a well-paid job; ease of traveling from the place of residence to school/clinic/shop; availability of public transport in the settlement; positive or negative attitudes of local authorities toward cooperating with the residents on issues significant to the given community.\nThe typology of rural areas according to gmina structure in every voivodeship7 is presented in Figure 3. The ordering of the regions in the chart makes it clear that types 2 and 5 are typical of voivodeships located in the Regained Territories, types 1 and 3 \u2013 of voivodeships on the territory of the former Republic, and types 6 and 7 are low in numbers, but occur in practically every voivodeship (with the\n30\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\n7 The territory of Poland is divided at the administrative level (NUTS 2) into 16 voivodeships, whose names are historical for the most part; see Appendix B for more information.\nexception of the \u015al\u0105skie voivodeship, where rural areas comprise mainly type 6 gminas).\nThis gives rise to a significant question: is the typological diversity of gminas determined in the MROW 2014 study a permanent characteristic, or are the differences going to grow or disappear?\nFigure 3. Percentage of gminas by type of development structure in each administrative region Description: the colors next to each type number correspond with the colors assigned to the types of gminas in Figure 2: type 1 \u2013 dominance of traditional agriculture; type 2 \u2013 dominance of large-scale agriculture; type 3 \u2013 prevalence of the agricultural function; type 4 \u2013 multi-income, fragmented agricultural structure; type 5 \u2013 multifunctional with balanced sectors of the economy; type 6 \u2013 urbanized, reduced agricultural function; type 7 \u2013 highly urbanized.\nSource: own calculations, MROW 2014.\nChapter 2. Typology of rural areas\nChapter 3. Level of socio-economic development of rural areas\nThe level of socio-economic development of rural areas aggregated per gmina with a synthetic measure was also determined in the course of this study. It shows a spatial perspective of the diversification of rural areas, defining five equinumerous groups of gminas typified by very high, high, average, low, and very low levels of socio-economic development. The measure was constructed using the same component measures as the typology of rural areas, as shown in Figure 1. Each component was weighted (also shown in Fig. 1). The resulting scale is ordinal, allowing us to arrange the units (gminas) from least to most developed; however, it doesn\u2019t enable us to determine the development level of a single gmina without considering the relationship of its development to the development level of other gminas.\nThe results of the MROW 2014 study (Fig. 4) have confirmed two trends in development polarization:\n1) differences between regions along the east-west axis (with the boundary falling between the territories of Mazowsze and Wielkopolska, approximately along the border between the former Russian and Prussian partitions), and 2) center-periphery differences in a regional (voivodeship) context. An analogous procedure of determining socio-economic development level performed in the MROW 2016 study confirms the spatial trends described two years earlier (Fig. 5)8. This indicates the continued importance of the following two factors in the diversification of rural area layouts.\n1. The historical factor linked to the former partition and interbellum boundaries. The economic structure present in the gminas\n33\n8 Compare study results: [Rosner, Heffner, Stanny, 2007; Stanny 2012; Stanny 2013a].\nof Central and Eastern Poland exhibits significant inertia and remains relatively monofunctional in character.\n2. The factor describing location relative to regional centers. Its influence can be observed throughout the country. Big cities, including Warsaw, Pozna\u0144, Wroc\u0142aw, and Gda\u0144sk, have a particularly broad circle\n34\nChapter 3. Level of socio-economic development of rural areas\nFigure 4.

It follows the center-periphery axis and is expressed in the division of rural areas into: central (suburban) zones \u2013 their range depends on the size of the\ncenter, its role in the settlement structure, and its position in the national administrative and economic system,\n35\nChapter 3. Level of socio-economic development of rural areas\nFigure 5. Level of socio-economic development according to MROW 2016 Source: research team.\n\u00a9 M\nRO W\n20 16\nperipheral zones \u2013 located away from big cities, frequently along voivodeship boundaries, intermediate zones \u2013 these form a continuum between central and peripheral zones. This system is additionally corrected by other factors, including the transportation network, presence of forested land, river network, tourist appeal, border crossings, etc.\nIt should be noted that the development level of most gminas remained constant over the course of the study (Table 2). An average of 10% of units in each of the five sets sorted by development level rose or fell in the classification. The period between Stages I and II of the program is very short (two years), therefore it would be injudicious to expect significant changes to occur in the spatial distribution of the 5 classes of rural socio-economic development. The similarity of distribution on the two maps of development level (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) is actually misleading, as they depict five relatively broad intervals (equinumerous at 434 units each). In fact, the noticeable differences between the maps show only the gminas which moved to another interval while changing their position in the\nChapter 3. Level of socio-economic development of rural areas\nranking. In a practical sense this means that these gminas lay near the conventional bound of the interval both in the MROW 2014 and MROW 2016 studies. However, the results of the studies are quite significant for both diagnosing the reality and verifying methodological assumptions.\nCalculations of socio-economic development level, repeated in Stage II of the study (MROW 2016) following the assumed procedure, confirm the conclusions formulated in Stage I. The main conclusions, indicating the diversity of rural areas, include: the utilization of attractive location factor relative to big cities and\ntheir markets, including the labor market, is strongly beneficial to high levels of socio-economic development of rural areas, multifunctional development of rural areas, even ones located far from urban centers, allows them to attain at least an average level of development, the dominance of traditional agriculture is a hindering factor in the development of rural areas, multiple incomes generated in an agricultural holding may \u2013 but do not have to \u2013 be linked to limiting the agricultural function. Replacement of agriculture by economic functions facilitating structural transformation (as in Wielkopolska), eradicating agriculture (suburban gminas), or preserving its structure (depopulating areas, growing significance of non-labor income sources such as pensions, retirement funds, welfare benefits, etc.) may be linked to success or failure in increasing socio-economic development.\nThe typology of rural areas described earlier (demonstrated in Fig. 2) is closely linked with the development level measure (see Table 3). Type 1 gminas are particularly often typified by relatively very low socio-economic development level, while all of type 7 and most of type 6 gminas are relatively very highly developed units. Similarly, most of type 4 and 5 gminas feature relatively high levels of development, which are conversely relatively low in types 2 and 3.\n37\nChapter 3. Level of socio-economic development of rural areas\nAs the studies are conducted in two-year intervals, the authors were concerned that any changes in gmina position on the scale of socio-economic development would be very small and, therefore, difficult to document. These concerns were proven wrong. The results of the analysis have shown that differences in socio-economic development levels of rural areas are an element of the dynamic reality of our times.\nChapter 3.

The dynamics of socio-economic development of rural areas\nIt was assumed that the ranking positions of gminas in an \u201cordered series\u201d would shift. A gmina developing faster than average would move \u201cup\u201d in the series, one developing slower than average would move \u201cdown\u201d. Naturally, this is a simplified perspective, but for the purposes of this presentation we will not delve deeper into the nuances of statistical measurement (a more detailed explanation is presented in the MROW 2016 Report; see Chapter III [Rosner, Stanny 2016]). In practice some gminas almost always move upward, improving their relative position, while others move downward, losing it. This allows us to analyze the percentage of units shifting between intervals.\nThe points in Figure 6 correspond to individual gminas and specify their relative level of socio-economic development. The position of each gmina according to MROW 2014 was marked on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis shows it according to MROW 2016 findings. If all gminas developed at the same pace, the points would fall on a diagonal line angled at 45 degrees. However, it turns out that most of them fall above or below this line. The points above the line represent gminas whose relative position had improved; those below it represent gminas which lost their position, developing slower than average. Point color indicates clusters of gminas of a given type (per the typology of rural areas created following the structure of development components, as shown in Fig. 2).\nThe greatest shifts of position over the course of the study have occurred in the group of gminas falling in the middle of the scale (mainly types 2-5). The changes were relatively smallest among poorly developed gminas where traditional agriculture dominates (type 1).\nFigure 6 shows the changes in position of gminas, both positive and negative; in many cases these shifts were minute, by few ranks. The map in Fig. 7 shows a more generalized distribution, displaying changes\n39\ngreater than +/-50 ranks (threshold determined according to the assumption; the method is described in more detail in Chapter III of the MROW 2016 Report [Rosner, Stanny 2016]). The set of gminas improving their position was additionally divided into two subsets: above average dynamics (increase by 50 to 100 ranks) and dynamic development (over 100 ranks). Similarly, the set of gminas losing their relative position was subdivided into below average dynamics (decrease by -50 to -100 ranks)\n40\nChapter 4. The dynamics of socio-economic development of rural areas\nFigure 6.

Shifts in position within the +- 50 bracket were considered average development dynamics.\nOne could ask what are the characteristics of gminas developing at an above-average pace and those developing relatively slow (below average). Does this depend on their attractive location factor, economic structure, social structure, agrarian structure, or some other factors?\nFigure 7. Changes in gmina position on the socio-economic development scale Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016.\n41\nChapter 4. The dynamics of socio-economic development of rural areas\n\u00a9 M\nRO W\n20 16\nAt this stage of the study, following the analysis of results presented in MROW 2014 and MROW 2016, the following patterns can be observed:\n1) No change in the relative positions of most gminas located in the neighborhood of the largest urban centers, like Warsaw, Krakow, Pozna\u0144, Wroc\u0142aw, Bydgoszcz, or Gda\u0144sk \u2013 those that have developed distinct and powerful ties to their rural surroundings. 2) Along regional boundaries, relatively weakly developing gminas are often interspersed with ones developing at above-average rates. 3) Though peripheral location very frequently means relatively low development levels, it does not necessarily cause low development dynamics. Growing variance of peripheral gmina development levels may be expected.\nFigure 8. Structure of gminas according to the pace of socio-economic development in individual voivodeships Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016.\n42\nChapter 4. The dynamics of socio-economic development of rural areas\nThe structure of gminas according to the pace of socio-economic development over the course of the study, as seen in Figure 8, shows that each voivodeship contains gminas that have improved their relative standing on the scale of socio-economic development level and ones that have lost theirs. The largest percentage of dynamically developing gminas occurs in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Wielkopolskie voivodeships. The \u0141\u00f3dzkie and \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie voivodeships lie on the other extreme with the largest percentage of slowly developing gminas. The lowest percentage of gminas exhibiting average dynamics occurs in the voivodeships supported by the Operational Programme Eastern Poland, particularly in the Podkarpackie, Warmi\u0144sko-Mazurskie, and Podlaskie voivodeships (nearly 1/3 of gminas are developing above average, while equally many develop at a below-average pace).\nThe dynamics of socio-economic development level are a synthesis of 11 components. Therefore, it is justified to ask which factors (components) exert more, and which exert less influence on the changes on the development level scale.\nThe analysis of these factors was limited to the 11 components used in the project. By determining the impact of individual components on socio-economic development dynamics of gminas (following the method described in Chapter III of the MROW 2016 Report [Rosner, Stanny 2016]), we have indicated components undergoing very gradual changes and highly resistant to attempts to guide them with the use of political stimuli. The agrarian structure of individual farms, including the area structure, is typified by particularly high inertia. Very gradual changes occur in the process of deagrarization of local economy, despite significant differences in this respect observed at voivodeship level. Therefore, the degree of deagrarization of local economies was not the decisive factor in socio-economic development dynamics. Deagrarization dynamics are the resultant of changes in other components, such as demographic processes, labor market changes, or shifts in education levels of local populations. Changes in components indicate future changes in the level of local economy deagrarization.\nConversely, relatively high diversification of the pace of changes is visible in the following components: education, demographics, and\n43\nChapter 4.

Naturally, a two-year period of observation is insufficient to determine whether this is a long-term trend shaping new spatial distribution, or a short-term tendency caused by brief stimuli. However, the analysis indicates that processes occurring within these components may modify the spatial distribution of development levels determined in earlier studies.\nChapter 4. The dynamics of socio-economic development of rural areas\nChapter 5. Characteristics of the dynamics and levels of socio-economic development components\nThe previous chapter presented the changes in the ordinal scale of gminas arranged by their socio-economic development level \u2013 a synthetic measure based on the 11 component scales. Which components have a greater or lesser impact on the changes on the synthetic scale? This chapter attempts to provide an answer. The results of the component analyses are shown below; a detailed description of the construction of appropriate measuring scales for every component can be found in Rural Development Monitoring. Stage II [Rosner, Stanny 2016]. The distribution of development levels and dynamics for each component will be illustrated with a cartogram. Note that Chapter 1 contains a brief explanation of each component\u2019s inclusion in the definition of the term \u201esocio-economic development\u201d.\nThe criteria for a gmina\u2019s inclusion in the group exhibiting average development dynamics are different for every component and dependent on the character of statistical distribution of changes in relative positions of gminas. Distribution measure analysis for all components allowed us to specify five intervals: dynamic development, above-average dynamics, average development dynamics, below-average dynamics, relatively slow development.\nWe assumed that given identical development dynamics, the relative positions of gminas would remain unchanged. Therefore, this scale reflects the upward and downward movement of gminas on the development level scale relative to their location on the corresponding scale in Stage I of the study (the details of the methodology can be found in Rural Development Monitoring. Stage II [Rosner, Stanny 2016, pp. 47\u201355]).\n45\n5.1. Spatial accessibility of gminas\nChapter 5. Characteristics of the dynamics and levels of socio-economic development...\nFigure 9.

Conversely, Northern Poland (Zachodniopomorskie, Pomorskie, and Warmi\u0144sko-Mazurskie voivodeships), already ranked low in this respect, is developing at a below-average pace relative to the national average. The situation is particularly challenging in Central Pomorze, where spatial accessibility is relatively low due to the disappearance of social functions provided by nationalized agriculture prior to its restructuring.\nThe gminas covered by the Operational Programme Eastern Poland (OP EP)9 exhibit little correlation between their spatial accessibility dynamics and the use of this development instrument. It could even be said that the effects of OP EP are unnoticeable in large areas and dynamic development occurs selectively.\nGminas exhibiting above-average dynamics of spatial accessibility improvement cluster around certain supralocal centers which had not developed highly structurally transformed suburban zones. This is the case with Olsztyn, Lublin, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski, and Bia\u0142ystok. This phenomenon indicates the emergence of rural suburban zones. On the other hand, the established suburban zones of Poland\u2019s largest agglomerations (apart from Katowice and Szczecin) exhibit variable dynamics.\nChapter 5.

These two factors were observed in the earlier stage of the project; the published results of Stage I contain their description.\nSpatial distribution of rural area deagrarization levels is highly variable throughout Poland and changed little (Fig. 11) over the course of this study. Particularly low dynamics of deagrarization, indicative of slow development, occurred in the gminas of the Podkarpackie, Ma\u0142opolskie, and \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie voivodeships, where farm structure is highly fragmented and non-agricultural labor traditionally accompanies work on a farm. Relatively dynamic deagrarization processes were observed in the gminas of the Wielkopolskie and Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodeships, where deagrarization levels were already relatively high.\nPositive changes can be observed in regions dominated by large-scale agriculture, particularly those where state farms had been restructured [type 2 in the rural area typology] and those relatively far on the course toward multifunctionality, mainly Wielkopolska and Dolny \u015al\u0105sk [type 5]. These types of gminas differ in the advancement of deagrarization processes \u2013 lower in type 2, higher in type 5 \u2013 but both exhibit a tendency toward developing faster than the national average.\nThe dynamics of local economy deagrarization vary between regions. Most gminas showing high and very high dynamics of transformation lie in Northwestern Poland, while most gminas where this process occurs slowly lie in Southeastern Poland. The boundary between these broadly defined areas divides Poland into (1) Northern and Western and (2) Southern and Eastern parts, and follows the Suwa\u0142ki -Opole axis (Fig. 12).\n51\nChapter 5.

Internal migrations from rural areas to urban centers play an important role in the mechanisms of these transformations.\nThe least favorable population structures were formed in Eastern and Central Poland, outside of areas adjacent to regional centers (Fig. 19). These territories are outflows of migrations to cities and surrounding areas; they feature a large percentage of retirementage population, relatively insufficient numbers of young women, and relatively low numbers of children. These areas are also \u201cdrained\u201d of educated, entrepreneurial (finding it relatively easy to make life decisions, even risky ones) people aspiring to improve their living conditions. At the same time, the agricultural function dominates in the economic structure of these areas, composed mainly of family farms. Most of these areas are losing population and exhibit unfavorable demographic structures; they can be described as depopulating areas.\nThe most favorable population structures occur around large urban centers, as well as in the southern part of the Ma\u0142opolskie voivodeship and in the Wielkopolskie and Pomorskie voivodeships. Most of these subregions exhibiting favorable demographic structures are targets of long-term migratory flows; in many cases they possess attractive natural features and favorable conditions for the development of tourism, as well as multifunctional economic development.\nHigh dynamics relative to the remaining 10 components of socio-economic development level are indicative of deepening demographic diversification. This results from two factors: population migrations and relatively rapid birth rate decrease. The latter factor is influenced by the demographic transition (more in: [Kotowska 1999]) and the present stage of demographic fluctuations \u2013 the alternating phases of demographic peaks and troughs [Rosner, Stanny 2008a].\n60\nChapter 5.

Any analysis of local rural labor markets must take both forms of unemployment \u2013 official and hidden \u2013 into account.

Changes in the position of gminas on the scale of market balance Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016.\nThe analysis of the dynamics of this component leads us to the following observations (Fig. 22): the relatively smallest changes \u2013 whether favorable or detrimental\n\u2013 have occurred in the proximity of major urban centers, especially around Warsaw, Pozna\u0144, Gda\u0144sk, and Wroc\u0142aw, i.e. in wellestablished and quite vast suburban areas; adjacent to the stable development zone, which usually encompasses two rings of gminas in the case of big cities, lies another ring featuring variable development dynamics which, however, usually is below average. This confirms the unstable situation of local labor markets outside of the direct range of urban agglomeration effects; gminas in ex-state farm areas (Warmia and central Pomorze) mainly feature average development dynamics, along with an extremely unfavorable assessment of gmina labor market balance. This may indicate that labor market problems which had not been addressed in the period of restructuring nationalized agriculture still remain unsolved; the catchment area of local labor market is not large; developing markets abut ones that stagnate. The spatial scope of changes is therefore very narrow, sometimes limited to single units. This might be linked to the diminished availability of public transport services between rural settlements.\nInterpreting these trends, while challenging by itself, is additionally complicated by the shortness of the research period; the changes may be largely impermanent, incidental, or illusory. Assuming that these are actual processes, at least three mutually non-exclusive interpretations may arise. The first one indicates the growth of significance of family farming, together with the rise of its importance in providing employment to rural populations in peripheral zones on a voivodeship level. The second one indicates the growth of the social function of this sector of agriculture, with employment in agriculture serving as a \u201cbuffer\u201d in the national employment balance. This interpretation is strengthened by the marked prevalence of detrimental changes in labor market balancing in type 6 gminas, where agriculture \u2013 while suppressed by expanding urban functions \u2013 remains a haven for a section of relatively less vocationally mobile populations.

Gminas in the Podlaskie and Lubelskie voivodeships \u2013 i.e. the Ukrainian and Belarussian borderlands \u2013 have the least favorable evaluation results.\nIn Wielkopolskie, Opolskie and \u015al\u0105skie \u2013 the voivodeships where this component exhibits the most favorable characteristics \u2013 the dynamics of the changes were average. The \u015al\u0105skie voivodeship is an interesting case, as the situation in its northern (agricultural) part exhibited above-average improvement dynamics in almost every gmina.\n74\nThe spatial diversification of changes in housing conditions indicates a split among rural areas in Poland. It follows the abovementioned Suwa\u0142ki-Opole axis between Northwestern and Southeastern Poland. The area above the axis (toward the north-west)\n75\nChapter 5.

A synthetic measurement of evaluating housing conditions Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2016.\nshows a majority of gminas where the changes in infrastructure equipment in rural dwellings were relatively slow or absent, while large clusters of gminas below the line (in Southeastern Poland) have exhibited at least an above-average pace of positive changes (Fig. 30).\n76\nChapter 5. Characteristics of the dynamics and levels of socio-economic development...\nFigure 30. Changes of position of gminas on the scale of evaluating housing conditions Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016.\nDue to higher technical standards of rural buildings in Northwestern Poland, brought about by historical factors, there was no need to replace the existing infrastructure.\nThe areas where housing conditions are relatively worse exhibit higher dynamics of improvement (the pre-World War I territories of Congress Poland and Galicia), while the areas with more favorable characteristics in this respect exhibit lower dynamics (regions with prewar and partition-era German infrastructure). There is a noticeable trend toward a gradual equalization of housing standards in both parts of the country. However, the gap between the two areas remains significant, and the process of territorial cohesion improvement following the EU accession remains slow in this respect.\n* * * The MROW 2016 study compared the changes in all 11 components of socio-economic development of gminas. As mentioned above, the analysis covered a brief period of time, therefore its conclusions should be approached with caution \u2013 confirming their veracity requires further studies. However, taking this into account we may determine which development components exhibited higher or lower dynamics (more about this method: [Rosner, Stanny 2016, pp. 54-56]). The highest dynamics were noted in the demographic, educational, and labor market related components. This is an indirect indication of a high significance of migration processes (both internal and external) in this respect.\nChapter 5. Characteristics of the dynamics and levels of socio-economic development...\nChapter 6. Profiles of development dynamics \u2013 varying share of components in socio-economic development\nSocio-economic development in a local system may follow in different ways. These are usually linked to the specifics of local conditions, which means that there is no single path of development that all gminas must follow. This gives rise to numerous questions; we have attempted to answer several of them over the course of this project. The following two seemed particularly interesting: \u2013 Are there any typical paths (profiles) of development preferred by gminas?, \u2013 What aspects of a gmina influence its development profile?\nGminas were grouped into sets exhibiting similar development dynamics according to statistical procedure. Our method, based on a model analogous to the one used in the typology of socio-economic structures of gminas, enabled us to determine four different profiles of rural development dynamics in Poland. These may be interpreted as follows: Profile 1 (encompasses 28% of gminas with 26% of inhabitants) \u2013\nabove-average dynamics of socio-economic component development with the exception of social activity and elements of infrastructure; Profile 2 (encompasses 27% of gminas with 30% of inhabitants) \u2013 relatively low dynamics of changes in the non-agricultural sector, increased spatial accessibility and social activity; Profile 3 (encompasses 25% of gminas with 24% of inhabitants) \u2013 lasting imbalance in the labor market, detrimental demographic changes, improvements in education; Profile 4 (encompasses 20% of gminas with 21% of inhabitants) \u2013 relatively slow deagrarization of local economies accompanied by balancing of labor markets and improving housing conditions, coupled with low income-generating abilities of gminas.\n79\nThe results of our analysis are shown on the map of spatial distribution of gminas according to their profile of socio-economic development dynamics. The map in Fig. 31 shows that Poland is divided into two parts along a line connecting Suwa\u0142ki and Opole (approximately diagonal from the upper right to the lower right).\nThe vast majority of gminas classified as developing along the path specified as Profile 4 (red areas in Fig. 31) is located in Southeastern Poland. Profile 4 gminas seldom occur west of this postulated line, and never in larger clusters. The greatest cluster of these gminas is located in Southeastern Poland, in the former Galicia region, which is an area of highly fragmented multi-income farming, as well as on the \u201cEastern Wall\u201d14 \u2013 along the eastern border of the country, particularly in its highly depopulating northern parts.\nGminas developing in accordance with Profile 1 (yellow) dominate in Northwestern Poland, west of the abovementioned Suwa\u0142ki-Opole line, but they lie outside of suburban areas. These are relatively very uncommon in Southeastern Poland, showing uneven (mosaic) dispersal patterns.\nProfiles 2 (green) and 3 (navy) appear throughout the country; there is no clear pattern linking their presence with any particular characteristics of areas. An interpretation of their structural characteristics leads to the conclusion that a multifunctional model of local economy is attractive regardless of previously formed social and economic structures.\nThe authors have also examined the proportions of these four profiles of development dynamics on the voivodeship level (Fig. 32). As a rule, decreasing percentages of Profile 1 gminas in the region are accompanied by growing percentages of Profile 4 gminas. This gives the impression that Profiles 1 and 4 form mutually competitive directions of local system development. The voivodeships of Western Poland are highest in the ranking, while those of Eastern Poland are lowest.\n80\nChapter 6. Profiles of development dynamics \u2013 varying share of components...\n14 More in Appendix B.\n81\nChapter 6. Profiles of development dynamics \u2013 varying share of components...\nFigure 31. Spatial distribution of gminas according to their profile of socio-economic development dynamics Source: research team \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016.\nThe results also indicate high correlation between the structural type of a gmina and its development profile. Nearly 80% of type 6 and 7 suburban/agglomeration gminas (per the typology of rural areas) develop according to Profile 2 (green) or 3 (navy). Profile 1 (yellow) encompasses over 50% of type 2 gminas dominated by large-scale agriculture (before 1989 the majority of farmland in these gminas was utilized by state farms). Conversely, over 50% of type 4 gminas (fragmented agriculture, multi-income households) follow Profile 4 (red).\nThough data for this analysis was only obtained from two studies \u2013 MROW 2014 and MROW 2016 \u2013 the analytical methods and their\n82\nChapter 6.

However, a further question remains unanswered: to what extent do profiles of development dynamics indicate the gminas specializing in line with their resources and structure, and do they help reduce local inequalities?\n* * * There are many ways to interpret socio-economic development, depending on which of its aspects are highlighted. Components of development in social science studies could include: sense of agency; alienation of authorities; sense of physical and economic security; and existence or absence of population attitudes conducive to collaborating on joint initiatives and participation in government on a local level. The set of development determinants assumed for a study has an obvious impact on the connotations of the term \u201cdevelopment\u201d as defined in the study.\nIn the process of selecting the factors of \u201cdevelopment\u201d for the purpose of MROW, we have taken particular care to note the proportions of economic and social components and to include various aspects of reality as broadly as possible with the use of empirical indicators. Separating the scopes of two terms \u2013 development level and quality of life \u2013 proved somewhat challenging. Several components which had very high significance for quality of life, but very little influence on development level, were dropped after a long debate; these include personal liberty and the sense of economic and physical security. While these factors undoubtedly have an impact on quality of life, their influence on socio-economic development level is debatable.\nThe study has shown that certain components of socio-economic characteristics of gminas coincide with other aspects. For example, a fragmented agrarian structure often coexists with large settlement size (inhabitant number) and a relatively small share of agriculture in income structures. Changes to one of the components usually cause changes to the remaining ones. As stated above, the most vital and the most general change is the deagrarization of rural economic structures \u2013 decreasing share of agriculture in the economy. It is accompanied by changes in employment structures, improvement in education levels, and other factors.\n83\nChapter 6. Profiles of development dynamics \u2013 varying share of components...\nSome of the 11 components, studied in the course of the MROW project in order to evaluate gmina development level, undergo very slow changes and exhibit high resistance to attempts at guiding them using political instruments. The agrarian structures of individual holdings exhibit this type of inertia. They have not changed significantly in most regions despite numerous reforms, even those implemented before World War II and in the Communist era. The fragmented farms of former Galicia and the distinct agricultural structure of Wielkopolska date back to mid-19th century. Deagrarization of rural economies and other similar changes result mainly from the development of nonagricultural sectors; they do not result from changes in agriculture.\nChapter 6. Profiles of development dynamics \u2013 varying share of components...\nEarlier studies have documented two criteria of ordering the spatial distribution of social and economic phenomena. Research results show that the center-periphery criterion (C-P), along with the division between Eastern and Western Poland (E-W), have a special significance in describing development levels, while they are significantly less noticeable in the analysis of the dynamics of social and economic changes. The latter is ordered according to another criterion, shown in many variables and less visible in the synthetic measure of development dynamics. This ordering follows the line dividing Poland into two parts: Southeastern and Northwestern, approximately along the line between Suwa\u0142ki and Opole. However, the existence of this boundary needs to be confirmed by further research.\nThe importance of several components should be noted, as research has shown their significant influence on the existing trends:\n1) Analysis of spatial diversification of rural socio-economic development levels confirms the presence of both regional polarization in Poland and internal polarization within individual regions. 2) Inter-regional cohesion is increasing at the cost of growing intra-regional stratification. 3) Deagrarization, defined as the increasing importance of nonagricultural functions in income generation (the departure from agricultural dominance in the economic structure of rural areas), is occurring at a very slow pace. Consequently, the dynamics of agricultural restructuring (the processes of land and labor concentration) also remain very low. 4) Multi-income farming may \u2013 but doesn\u2019t have to \u2013 occur along with limiting the agricultural function. Agriculture can be supplanted\n85\nChapter 7. Summary of the study\nwith other economic functions facilitating its structural transformation (as in Wielkopolska), replacing it (agglomeration gminas), or preserving its structures (depopulating areas, increased significance of non-labor sources of income), which in turn can influence socio-economic development levels. 5) High dynamics of the non-agricultural sector are observed in the regions covered by Operational Program Eastern Poland. However, there is a concern that instead of being permanent, this effect is only due to the conditions created by this program. It remains to be seen how many businesses (and non-agricultural jobs) created over the course of the program remain operational after its conclusion. 6) Spatial accessibility of rural areas has improved in Central Poland, while remaining significantly lower in gminas in Eastern Poland (selective dynamics, no effect of Operational Program Eastern Poland). Spatial accessibility remained unchanged in gminas of Central Pomorze (post-state farm areas), where the need for improvement is greatest. 7) As stated above, the following factors have the greatest significance for rural transformations: demographics, education, and labor market. This indirectly indicates the great importance of migration processes (both internal and external) in short-term solutions for development challenges. 8) Gminas follow different ways of adapting to the conditions arising from deagrarization and socio-economic development processes, accompanied by the decreasing role of agriculture in providing income. The ways are possibly as numerous as the gminas themselves. Research has shown that these adaptations can be grouped into four basic profiles of development dynamics. Two of them occur with the same frequency throughout the territory of Poland, while of the remaining two one is typical of Northwestern Poland, and the other \u2013 of Southeastern Poland.\nChapter 7. Summary of the study\nDue to the general structure of the Rural Development Monitoring project, the results of its first stage provide data about spatial diversification of development levels and spatial diversification of specified components of development. These results are static, forming a precise (sharp and carefully framed) snapshot of a certain fragment of reality. They allow us to delineate groups of spatial units exhibiting similar characteristics and discover similarities and differences between these groups of units. However, replacing the language of static distribution analysis with the language describing the dynamics of reality, showing processes and transformations, only became possible after the second stage of the study \u2013 MROW 2016.\nThe title of this chapter \u201cClosing remarks,\u201d is intentional; using the word \u201cconclusions\u201d would have been overly promising, while omitting a closing chapter would have indicated that the authors are not ready to observe and attempt to generalize the key findings in the results of their analyses. That said, time is a significant obstacle to drawing broad conclusions. Only two years have passed between Stages I and II of the study \u2013 a very short period that does not allow for categorical evaluations. However, analyses are also necessary: they have enabled the methodological preparations for subsequent stages of the study. This type of development studies, operationally based on development components \u2013 synthetic variables (consisting of several different, formerly normalized characteristics) \u2013 is unprecedented in Polish scientific literature on the subject; its procedures are first of their kind. The project has a non-standard structure, utilizing static and dynamic approaches and measurement on logically \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d (ordinal) scales. It necessitated numerous analyses and debates on the status of the results \u2013 whether they may serve as a basis for further\n87\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nconclusions or are merely generalized incidental observations, their very nature logically fallible. However, the entirety of our empirical knowledge \u2013 obtained through inductive reasoning \u2013 is either banal or fallible. Now, following the completion of Stage II of the project, we are wiser and more aware of the cognitive limits of this method, but also more certain that the assumed procedures enable us to describe extremely complex, interdisciplinary interdependencies.\nStage II of the project was aimed in part at overcoming methodological challenges. These included the verification of ways to measure several synthetic qualities revealing the character of units (gminas), to repeat these measurements at specific intervals, and to determine methods of determining the pace and structure of the observed changes. During Stage II we have also observed this specific slice of socio-economic reality to monitor the changes noted over the period between Stages I and II. We monitored changes, not trends in development, because the period of time covered by the data is too short.\nSubstantive observations made during the course of Stage II concern the main long-term process of deagrarization of local economic structures. Deagrarization is a consequence of shrinking demand for agricultural labor resulting from technological and organizational changes, accompanied by growing demand for labor in the manufacturing and service industries. Not too long ago it was assumed that decreasing demand for agricultural labor has no effect on the labor market or that it generates a certain increase in demand for labor in other sectors of food economy, including farm supply, support, purchasing and processing, and retail preparations. As it turns out, job growth in non-agricultural branches of food economy is far slower than the decrease of employment in agriculture and mainly occurs in non-rural areas. Additionally, the decrease in agricultural employment is a misleading metric, greatly dependent on non-agricultural labor market conditions and agriculture characteristics. For forms of agriculture not based on hired labor, lower demand for farm work is a sum of shrinking employment and growth of hidden unemployment in agriculture.\nThe process of rural deagrarization and development of nonagricultural spheres of the economy has been going on for centuries. Its dynamics are changeable. It sped up considerably in the 19th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution and newly won\n88\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nindependence of peasants from landowners (as well as the end of feudalism in our part of Europe). However, deagrarization and industrialization/urbanization, though not entirely independent of one another, do not occur in sync.\nAgriculture is the main economic function in rural areas. Shrinking demand for farm labor triggers an avalanche of consequences for rural socio-economic landscapes. Different types of structural development face different consequences \u2013 for example, areas where large-scale agriculture dominates (type 2 of rural areas) experience lasting visible unemployment; the unemployed are disadvantaged with regard to age, sex, education, profession, etc. These characteristics of the unemployed may lead to social marginalization or social exclusion. Sociologists often point out the phenomenon of \u201cstate farm families\u201d; certain characteristics associated with hired workers of state farms, like learned helplessness, acceptance of relative poverty, low educational and professional aspirations for children, etc., were present in their entire families, even in individuals who hadn\u2019t been state farm employees.\nAreas where family farming dominates (type 1) experience completely different consequences of deagrarization. Visible unemployment is lower, but even though employment in agriculture is decreasing, it tends to remain overly high (and sometimes even increases, possibly due to difficulties in non-agricultural labor markets). This is particularly common when agricultural labor resources reproduce at an increased rate. Members of farm families find work outside of agriculture if they can; if outside employment is unavailable, they remain on the family farm and help their parents. They work in agriculture even though this work is economically superfluous and doesn\u2019t increase farm output. This form of overstaffing on family farms is, in fact, disguised unemployment. This phenomenon seems inseparably linked to family farming in areas devoid of sufficiently attractive non-agricultural work available to farm family members. Their labor is economically unnecessary \u2013 but the family farm serves an extra-economic function, giving them a sense of social and economic security.\nExtremely unfavorable economic indicators are a direct consequence of agricultural overstaffing. One is production value per\n89\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nemployee. Production value is the numerator of this indicator, while the denominator is the number of employees producing this value; when hidden unemployment occurs, the latter number includes workers necessary for production along with the surplus. This is the apparent paradox of hidden unemployment: these workers are employed, but their labor is unnecessary. For example, a farm\u2019s fence only needs to be painted once every few years; painting it several times per year does not increase the farm\u2019s output. Low production values per employee also result in low income of agricultural workers.\nThe hidden unemployed eventually find work outside the farm; this is often accompanied by migration, mainly to cities or suburban areas. However, while the children of farmers go through a phase of disguised unemployment while entering the labor market, the hidden unemployed are a permanent segment of rural population. The composition of this segment changes, but it continues to exist.\nTwo processes \u2013 shrinking demand for agricultural labor and the development of local non-agricultural labor markets \u2013 are particularly vital in examining rural socio-economic development. They determine the scale and pace of changes required to maintain its existing level. They also influence migratory events (internal and international), educational aspirations, etc. However, non-agricultural sectors of the economy are also constantly developing; therefore it would be better to specify that the relationship between the pace of deagrarization and local labor market development is responsible for maintaining an acceptable level of disparities in agriculture (e.g. income).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that hidden unemployment in agriculture (surplus labor) is not a clear-cut term. It could be narrowed down to describe the current surplus of labor force, or broadened to include the potential surplus. The current surplus exists at this time, in the present agrarian structures; however, these structures \u2013 particularly land fragmentation \u2013 are in many respects lagging behind the changes which have occurred in countries with similar conditions for agriculture. Farm structure in Poland has a particularly large impact on employment per 100 ha of arable land or unit of production value. Improving the agrarian structure (land concentration) would decrease the demand for agricultural labor. The existence of the current labor surplus in agriculture blocks the process of agricultural restructuring; restructuring would indirectly\n90\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nlower the demand for labor. This would reveal the surplus of labor caused by the structure of agriculture.\nThe lack of strong correlation between decreasing the demand for agricultural labor and creating non-agricultural jobs is caused by a number of factors, including the characteristics of demographic processes. Poland\u2019s labor resources tended toward over-reproduction for approximately 15 years, until 2010 on average (until 2006 in cities and until 2015 in rural areas), as baby boom generations graduated and joined the workforce while baby bust generations approached retirement age. This trend has now reversed and labor resources are reproducing to a smaller extent. The processes involved in job creation and loss are complex, spatially and professionally diverse, and vary with time. The requirements for workers with regard to professional education, independence, decision making, etc., have changed; demand for unskilled labor is falling while demand for workers in new technologies grows. The dynamics of non-agricultural labor market changes are neither qualitatively nor quantitatively correlated to the shrinking demand for agricultural labor.\nWhat\u2019s the destination of the outflow from farm families? Where do surplus agricultural workers find employment? The answers to these questions are not straightforward. Some workers find employment in local non-agricultural labor markets; some commute to nonagricultural workplaces on a daily basis; others migrate in search of work. Numerous factors influence the choices of these \u201cunnecessary\u201d workers. Some of these have been known and described for years; for example, if the home region of a job seeker features fragmented agriculture, relatively populous rural settlements, a relatively dense network of small towns, and a dense communication network (structural type 4), commuting may be expected to be the dominant influence on rural development.\nThis results in the reduction of agricultural function and transformation of farms into allotments producing goods for personal use (or for tourists in tourism regions). Population density remains high, periodically trending upwards. Environmentally attractive gminas may see a positive migration rate, particularly of retirement-age people, while gminas located near cities (especially ones of supralocal importance) may experience an inflow of working-age people. Large villages may tend to\n91\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nbecome more town-like, particularly with regard to infrastructure, access to services, and \u2013 in time \u2013 with regard to social and professional structure, education demographics, etc.\nThis process is completely different in regions where small settlements, particularly dispersed ones, predominate. These regions typically exhibit a relatively high share of the agricultural function and a weak non-agricultural labor market (types 1 and 3). Young people entering the workforce usually migrate away from their home region; the remaining population ages in a demographic sense. Women are more migratory than men; noted since the 19th century, this phenomenon is so prevalent that it has become one of the \u201claws of migration\u201d. As a result, male farmers have difficulty finding wives, and falling birth rates impact local population structures. The above phenomena lead to low population density, its distribution often spatially scattered, which increases infrastructural costs. The social importance of keeping villages accessible collides with the economic unfeasibility of maintaining a public transport network; replacing it with private automobiles faces obstacles, both financial and related to age and competences of residents.\nThis type of areas usually tends toward depopulation, while the shrinking population exhibits a distinct regressive structure. The downward tendencies increase over time in type 1 areas, leading to the disappearance of economic activity as individual villages, and eventually entire clusters of settlements, depopulate.\nThe process of deagrarization is different still in suburban rural areas (types 6 and 7), where non-agricultural labor markets appear in rural settlements, providing opportunities for local employment in non-agricultural professions. This process is actually much more complex \u2013 each region or local system develops its own optimum ratio of non-agricultural function development and commuting or migrations. Though these are \u201cindividual\u201d solutions, they are statistically related to the structural types of regions delineated over the first stage of MROW.\nNumerous other factors \u2013 population structure due to earlier migrations (the indigenous and the settlers), accessibility of educational institutions and educational aspirations of the population, social activity, scale of local demand for non-agricultural goods and\n92\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\nservices, requirements for functioning on broader supralocal markets, and conditions for local entrepreneurship \u2013 influence the ways local systems can tackle the challenges of economy deagrarization.\nThe last 25 years were a period of profound systemic transformation in Poland as its economy shifted from \u201creal socialism\u201d toward a growing significance of the market, individual entrepreneurship, and local governance. The MROW project attempted to identify the ways in which gminas adapted to the changing conditions, taking into account a number of factors including the current levels of economic deagrarization of rural areas and phase of demographic development (lowered reproduction of workforce following a period of heightened reproduction). Each gmina does it its own way. Our research procedures revealed that this diverse set may be subdivided based on similar mechanisms of adjustment. As it turns out, some of these are typical of Eastern or Western Poland. Additionally, the development profiles of groups of gminas are related to their current level of socio-economic development and structural qualities. However, this result needs to be confirmed over the course of subsequent stages of the study.\nChapter 8. Closing remarks\n1. Sp\nat ia\nl a cc\nes si\nbi lit\ny of\ng m\nin as\n[D S]\n2.

            "text": "The structures of Poland \u2013 economic, social, settlement patterns, etc \u2013 exhibit vast regional differences; these are pronounced in rural areas as well. Study results indicate that the existence of these phenomena in rural areas is rooted in two overlapping systems of influence \u2013 historical and center-periphery [Rosner, Stanny 2014; Stanny 2013 a; Heffner, Rosner 2009]. The latter means that rural areas located near regional urban centers experience population concentration, while their agricultural function (calculated based on the percentage of residents making a living from agriculture, the role of agriculture in providing income, etc) becomes significantly reduced. This model is universal and occurs in all regions (voivodeships) with the sole exception of a part of the \u015al\u0105skie voivodeship, where almost all rural areas lie in the sphere of influence of industrial cities and a large percentage of villages was transformed into worker housingI. As the center-periphery model is the same for every region, instead of explaining it in greater detail we will present the historical origins of regional diversification of the territory of Poland.\nThe boundaries of Poland underwent numerous shifts, often due to the dynastic policies of royal families that ruled this part of Europe. For example, Poland\u2019s territory encompassed the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania following a personal union in 1386. Full integration of the two countries (real union) was proclaimed in 1569 at the Sejm in Lublin. At that time the territory of Poland included a large part of present-day Ukraine. Similarly, the Silesian and Pomeranian duchies (\u015al\u0105skie and Pomorskie) were under Polish, Prussian, and Czech rule at different times. From the late 18th century until the end of World War I Poland did not exist as an independent state, its territory split into three partitions annexed by the Russian Empire, the\n145\nAppendices. Appendix B\nI G\u00f3rny \u015al\u0105sk (the surroundings of Katowice) is a significantly urbanized industrial region due to the presence of coal, resulting in the extensive development of mining and heavy industry. The region is described in more detail near the end of Appendix B.\nKingdom of Prussia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Fig. B.2.). It\u2019s worth observing that Polish lands became peripheral territories in each of the partitioning powers, as agricultural, least economically developed regions of the latter. The growth of urban centers \u2013 even significant ones like Warsaw, Pozna\u0144, or Krak\u00f3w \u2013 was very slow due to the policies of the partitioning powers, and their importance as economic, administrative, and educational centers decreased.\nThe division of Poland\u2019s territory between the three partitioning powers put each respective area under the influence of different legal, economic, and political systems. Additionally, a number of extremely important events took place in this part of Europe over the course of the 19th century and their consequences remain visible to date. These include: the abolishment of serfdom (the relationship between peasants and nobility, originating from the Middle Ages); the\n146\nAppendices. Appendix B\nFigure B.1. Historical provinces within the present-day territory of Poland Source: own study.\nMA\u0141OPOLSKA\nWIELKOPOLSKA\nPOMORZE MAZURY\nMAZOWSZE\n\u015aL\u0104SK\nP O\nD LA\nS IE\nemancipation of land-bound peasants; urban growth; development of industry; development of transport; creation of public schools in rural areas and introduction of mandatory education; etc. These events occurred on different terms and at different times in each partition.\nGranting land ownership to peasants and emancipating them (peasants had formerly been forbidden to relocate without permission) had a profound impact on the present structure of rural areas. In the Prussian partition, this process began around 1810 and ended in the 1840s: a number of legislative acts gradually ended the economic dependence of peasants on nobles, while shaping the structure of rural holdings at the same time \u2013 for example, larger farms (approx. 7 hectares) owning draft animals gained independence relatively early and on relatively advantageous terms. As different types of holdings\n147\nAppendices. Appendix B\nFigure B.2. Partition boundaries overlaid on the present-day administrative division of Poland Source: own study.\nexperienced different treatment, the area structure of agriculture was shaped into manor farms and peasant farms (some of them relatively strong economically, others significantly weaker). Peasant farms also became a source of hired labor for manor farms, particularly in periods of increased demand for farm labor. The landless, a separate social group, hired on as laborers or performed jobs not directly related to agriculture, but vital for the functioning of rural communities (smith, publican, teacher, shopkeeper, etc).\nIn the Russian partition, peasants became emancipated in 1864 not in the course of planned economic structure development, but as part of a political battle. An uprising against the Russian government began in 1863. Seeing that peasants were unlikely to support their efforts, leaders of the uprising offered to emancipate them; however, they lacked sufficient influence in rural areas to fulfil this promise. The Russian government responded by proclaiming and implementing the emancipation of serfs, giving them the land they had farmed, abolishing corvee labor (unpaid work on manor farms), and granting them the right to moveII. The Emancipation Act ended the peasants\u2019 dependence on noble houses, but did not improve the structure of their farms (frequently very small) or regulate their employment on manor farms. The Russian partition also had a relatively underdeveloped network of local urban centers, which was additionally weakened by the reprisals following the 1863 uprising as many of the towns lost their town privileges.\nEmancipation in the Austro-Hungarian partition was enacted with a single act in 1848, precipitated by the successes of the 1846 peasant rebellion against nobility, also called the Jakub Szela uprising or the Galician slaughterIII. In contrast to the flat lands of the other two partitions, the territory of the Austro-Hungarian partition is largely hilly or mountainous. However, relatively high population density had been typical of this region since the Middle Ages, as Krakow \u2013 the biggest city in this part of the country and capital of Poland until early\n148\nAppendices. Appendix B\nII The 1864 Emancipation Acts did not regulate easement laws: the legal relationship between nobles and peasants, sometimes extremely complex, governing the peasants\u2019 rights to use noble forests, lakes, etc., and vice versa \u2013 the nobles\u2019 rights to use peasant fields for hunting, etc. Other issues covered by easements included the use of gmina land. The lack of legal decisions on these issues sparked numerous local conflicts in the subsequent period. III Galicia (1772\u20131918) \u2013 commonly used name of the territory of the Austro-Hungarian partition.\n17th century \u2013 had long been the center of statehood and the seat of Poland\u2019s central administration \u2013 the royal court. The rolling terrain stimulated the development of villages in and along valleys; over time these villages would grow relatively large, separated from neighboring settlements by hills and farmland. Additionally, their large size stimulated agrarian fragmentation \u2013 there was relatively little usable farmland available per household.\nThe emancipation of Galician peasants was necessitated by the situation in rural areas. Corvee labor was abolished and peasants were granted ownership of the lands they worked, but the government also imposed relatively high taxes on the peasants, intended as compensation for the losses suffered by noble houses. The situation of Galician peasants changed little; the smallness of their farms caused their continued dependence on non-agricultural income or work on manor farms.\nPermanent migrations to cities are significantly less frequent in Galicia due to the relative density of its network of small towns and very large villages (functioning to some extent as local centers); a daily commute to work is typical of the region. Galician inheritance traditions also differ from the rest of the country \u2013 instead of leaving the entire farm to the eldest son (or sometimes the eldest child) like in other regions, Galician farmers would customarily split their land between all their children, furthering agrarian fragmentation. It is worth noting that both primogeniture coupled with paying off the other siblings (in the other two partitions) and partible inheritance (in Galicia) were supported by the regional laws of inheritance and therefore may be considered an element of agricultural policyIV.\nThe introduction of compulsory education in rural areas had a degree of influence on the emergence of regional differences between the partitions. The Prussian partition was first to implement it (in the form of \u201celementary schools\u201d), while the Russian was last. It is worth noting that the formal introduction of compulsory education in the Russian partition did not actually result in the creation of a rural public school network \u2013 the local authorities, tasked with creating and maintaining schools, could not afford to do so. The actual creation of schools in the villages of the Russian partition was years behind the legal regulations.\n149\nAppendices. Appendix B\nIV More in: [G\u00f3rski, Kuczkowski 1928; Kowalski at all 1928].\nThe situation in the Prussian partition, whose government considered schooling an element of its policy of Germanization, was vastly different. In certain extreme cases opposition to this policy resulted in school strikes of Polish students. Polish peasants also began to organize to prevent Germanization, creating farming associations, mutual aid societies, etc. By attempting to resist Germanization, the peasants of the Prussian partition improved their skills at selforganization and mutual aid \u2013 today we would call that building social capital. These social phenomena were absent or highly limited in the other partitions.\nIt is estimated that most rural schools at the end of the partition period were single-teacher schools. That was the case with approx. 90% of schools in the Russian partition and approx. 60% in the Prussian and Austro-Hungarian partitions. At that time adult illiteracy (in urban and rural populations) was 5% in the Prussian partition, 40% in Galicia, and 57% in the Russian partitionV. This indicates that emancipation of peasants had hastened the development of cities and the industry due to enabling peasant mobility, but the quality of industrial labor obtained in this group was low and regionally diversified.\nThe Recovered Territories or Western and Northern Territories are a separate, distinct region shaped by historical factors \u2013 namely, the border shift after World War II. The victorious powers decided to assign a portion of pre-war German lands to Poland, while Polish territories east of the Curzon Line were incorporated to the USSR. The territory incorporated to Poland was \u201ccleansed\u201d of its German residents and repopulated by three waves of settlers \u2013 soldiers returning from the front, \u201crepatriates\u201d from the lands reassigned to the USSR, and migrants from agriculturally overpopulated areas of Central Poland.\nWhile the regions of the three partitions are typically inhabited by indigenous populations, the territories acquired after World War II are almost exclusively populated by settlers (incomers). The only exception is the relatively small eastern part of the present Opolskie voivodeship inhabited by German nationals who were considered Opole Silesians (basically Poles from the borderlands) after the war.\n150\nAppendices. Appendix B\nV Cf. [ Jezierski, Leszczy\u0144ska 2002, p. 259].\nIn addition to resettlement, new economic structures arose across Poland\u2019s post-war territorial acquisitions (Western and Northern Territories), especially in agriculture. Due to the post-war food shortages, these lands were divided into two types of agricultural holdings \u2013 family farms ran by settlers from the east who had to abandon their homesteads, and large state-owned holdings that became PGRs (state farms) several years later. Other regions saw the transformation of larger manor farms into state farms in the course of post-war agrarian reforms, but the Western and Northern Territories had the greatest concentration of PGRs. Approx. 19% of Poland\u2019s utilized agricultural area was used by state farms, but the land use in some poviats of the Western\n151\nAppendices. Appendix B\nFigure B.3. Approximate borders of interwar Poland (1918\u20131938) overlaid on the current administrative division Source: own study.\nLegend: The blue line \u2013 Polish border with Germany The maroon line \u2013 Polish border with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics The black line in the south \u2013 Polish border with Czechoslovakia and Romania The black line in the north \u2013 Polish border with Lithuania and Latvia\nand Northern Territories exceeded 50%. PGRs were organizationally modeled after Russian sovkhoz farmsVI.\nMost state farms could not compete in the market conditions resulting from the political transformations of the early 1990s \u2013 they needed economic and political support from the government to function. In the course of broad restructuring efforts some portions of state farm land became large-scale farms with a market-oriented organizational structure, while others were absorbed by neighboring family farms in order to increase their size. Approximately 50% of former state farm workers were employed by the new large-scale farms; the rest found refuge in the pension and retirement system or joined the ranks of the unemployed [cf. Halamska 1998; Wilkin 1997].\nAppendices. Appendix B"

            "text": "The historical factors, presented above in a greatly simplified fashion, shaped a number of distinct regions which exhibit differing rural structure characteristics influencing their development levels and dynamics, as well as the type of development transformations currently underway. These divisions are largely unrelated to the present-day administrative division (compare the typological map from Chapter 2 with Fig. B.4.).\nAn area of Southeastern Poland roughly equivalent to the former Austro-Hungarian partition is a good example of a relatively structurally homogenous region. This area has a relatively dense network of local urban centers and large villages (compare Fig. B.6). Farms are highly fragmented \u2013 the average farm size in many gminas is approx. 3 hectares. Commuting to work and engaging in nonagricultural work in addition to farming are long-standing traditions in the region. Commuting has become an alternative to migration to cities; this factor plays a role in maintaining high population density in rural areas and relatively favorable demographic structures of rural populations (particularly with regard to the share of the elderly in the population and gender ratios in the marrying age group).\nThe consequences of economic migrations to the USA in the interwar period and before World War I are frequently observed in this\n152\nVI More in: [Halamska 1998; Wilkin 1997].\nregion. Temporary migrations to the USA remain common due to the existence of migratory networks (often familial in character) formed in that period. Temporary migrations are also a significant source of income bolstering the family budget \u2013 particularly in the case of building new family homes or rental properties, often large and well-appointed.\nMost of the territory of this region is visually attractive (mountains and submontane areas); as a result, tourism and recreation are more developed there than in most other rural areas. Retirement-age migrants have started settling in rural parts of the region in the recent years; this phenomenon occurs almost exclusively in environmentally attractive areas.\nWielkopolska \u2013 a region bounded on the west by the interwar border and on the east by the boundary of the Prussian partition \u2013 is characterized by relatively high levels of social and human capital. As\n153\nAppendices. Appendix B\nFigure B.4. Present-day administrative division of Poland into voivodeships Source: own study.\nnoted above, this region experienced the earliest introduction of compulsory education in rural areas. To this day the oldest generations of rural residents in Wielkopolska exhibit more favorable educational demographics than their peers in other regionsVII. Multifunctional development is present in the economic structure of Wielkopolska\u2019s rural areas, overcoming the dominance of the agricultural function and enriching local labor markets. This phenomenon limits the migration of young people to cities and industrial centers.\nThe agrarian structure of this region is relatively advantageous; farms in Wielkopolska are said to be managed with a high degree of professional culture. Collaborating with neighboring farms is a long-standing tradition in this region, dating back to the times when it was considered an element of resistance to Germanization in the 19th century.\nMazowsze, Podlasie, and the northern part of Ma\u0142opolska, roughly the area of the former Russian partition, form another region exhibiting distinct social and economic structures rooted in its history. This region is very broad and relatively heterogenous, as distinct subregions exist alongside the characteristics typical of the entire area, like the dominance of family farming (the share of other farm types is marginal). Another common characteristic of the region is the dominance of the agricultural function in its rural economic structures (apart from suburban enclaves). The region\u2019s demographic structure was shaped by relatively intensive, long-term migrations of young people to cities. This resulted in a population with a high share of the elderly, overrepresentation of males over females in the marrying age group, and a high percentage of older working age groups in the work force. The dominance of family farming and the weakness of local labor markets reinforce (selective) migrations of young people to cities: work on the family farm is often the only alternative, resulting in agricultural overstaffing, i.e. hidden unemployment.\nThe settlement network is predominantly composed of relatively small villages, frequently developed in dispersed patterns (particularly north of Warsaw). While this region exhibits a relatively high share of relatively new buildings, this is not a testament to the wealth of its residents. The previous buildings simply had extremely low technical standards and were predominantly wooden, often roofed with flammable materials.\n154\nAppendices. Appendix B\nVII Cf. Map 3.4.02 in: [Atlas demograficzny i spo\u0142eczno-zawodowy obszar\u00f3w wiejskich w Polsce\u2026, p. 80].\nAs noted above, a number of distinct subregions exists in this region. One of them lies south of Warsaw (approximately near the towns of Gr\u00f3jec and Warka). There are numerous highly specialized commercial orchards in this subregion, producing mainly new varieties of apples. The profitability of these orchards was proverbial in Poland in the period preceding the 1989 transformation; most of their production was exported.\nAnother of these subregions is an area north of Warsaw commonly called the \u201cdairy belt\u201d. This name indicates the specialization of a large number of farms in that region.\nThe eastern borderlands, particularly their northern part commonly called the \u201cEastern Wall\u201d, mainly cover the area of Podlasie (Fig. B.4), somewhat wider and extending further south along the Polish border. This subregion exhibits characteristics of depopulating areas \u2013 decreasing population density and the emergence of a very disadvantageous demographic structure. This area, drained of its young, educated, enterprising residents, has an extremely high share of elderly people. Population has been in decline for a number of years, leading to the disappearance of entire villages from the settlement network. This is particularly pronounced in the case of peripheral settlements located far from local centers (seats of local authorities).\nAnother distinct region is the triangle between the towns of Rzesz\u00f3w, Radom, and Kielce, an area formerly known as the Central Industrial Region (COP): substantial investments in industrial development in the 1930s (the interwar period) and 1970s significantly boosted its economy. While town development was stimulated by these investments, their development was monofunctional, based on steel, military, and heavy machinery industries. Rural areas adjacent to COP towns provided agricultural products for the local markets and labor force for non-agricultural jobs in the towns. Following the industrial restructuring of the 1990s, rural and urban populations of the region practically lost their access to labor markets, which in turn decreased the market absorption of agricultural products. Visible and hidden unemployment remains high in the rural areas of the region.\nThe last great region unified by historical circumstances, the Western and Northern Territories \u2013 a name intended to circumvent the political connotations of the term \u201cRegained Territories\u201d \u2013 was\n155\nAppendices. Appendix B\nsettled by Poles after World War II. State farms (PGRs) were established in large numbers in this area, particularly in its northern parts. The quality of buildings and technical infrastructure (e.g. local roads) in these territories was higher than in other regions, so investing in the area was not a priority at the time; as a result, most of this infrastructure is currently obsolete \u2013 for example, the roads are very narrow, unsuited to the intensity of modern traffic.\nThe region of the Regained Territories has a relatively rich network of small and medium urban centers. The degree of urbanization in this area is therefore relatively high (68%), while the rural settlement network is generally largely dispersed. A significant feature of this region\u2019s demographic process is its low population density (compare Fig. B.5 and B.6). The spatial mobility characteristics of its inhabitants are typical of settler populations \u2013 they are more migratory than indigenous population. This is also the case with post-state farm areas, the source of increased outflows of young people in recent years.\nThe northern part of the region is the site of another distinct phenomenon: \u201crural post-state farm neighborhoods\u201d, clusters of apartment buildings erected as housing for PGR workers. After this sector was restructured, these neighborhoods became local hotbeds of unemployment, poverty, and poor life skills. Built for an economy that ceased to exist, they turned into dysfunctional nodes of the settlement network as socio-economic conditions changed. While their numbers are low \u2013 slightly over 100 \u2013 post-state farm neighborhoods pose a serious problem on a local scaleVIII.\nThe restructuring of state farms increased the size of family farms adjoining their former sites. This is particularly pronounced in Western Pomorze \u2013 it is estimated that average farm size in this region increased from approx. 10 hectares to approx. 18 hectares over several years.\nG\u00f3rny \u015al\u0105sk, a region of Silesia, is an unusual subregion, differing both in size and characteristics from the regions described above. The agricultural function is secondary in this area, with entire villages serving as dormitories for urban labor markets. Strongly fragmented farms (sometimes just single fields) provide supplementary income for worker families. The agricultural function is in a constant state of\n156\nAppendices. Appendix B\nVIII For more information see the report: [Liwi\u0144ski, Sztanderska, Giza-Poleszczuk 2008].\nregression due to urbanization processes (the degree of urbanization currently exceeds 77%) and the concentration of industry and new technologies in the region.\nStructural characteristics vary in each of these regions, but each of them was shaped by historical factors. The boundaries of historical partitions and the post-war shift of the western border of Poland are particularly apparent in the present-day spatial diversification of rural areas, described here with the aid of the Rural Development Monitoring\n157\nAppendices.

Before Poland regained independence in 1918, these regions were influenced by disparate legal systems and development concepts, absorbed by national organisms implementing different development dynamics and socio-economic policies. They were located on the peripheries of local regional centers (development stimulators). Though shaped over a century ago, the differences in settlement patterns, agrarian structures, infrastructure, social customs, and social activity \u2013 both civic (voting in national elections) and community-level \u2013 remain noticeable to this day.\n158\nAppendices.

For over 25 years the Foundation has been helping to change the image of Polish rural areas and has been actively supporting the social and economic development of local communities. The activity of the Foundation is focused mainly on supporting investments related to the improvement of technical infrastructure, development of local companies, as well as educational and social actions addressed to people living in rural areas.\nInstitute of Rural and Agricultural Development, Polish Academy of Sciences (IRWIR PAN) was established in 1971. It is an important public body which embraces various scientific fields of rural development. It is a leading interdisciplinary research organization focused on monitoring of the ongoing socio-economic and environmental challenges facing rural areas. The Institute has conducted numerous research projects on rural and agricultural issues and it is an initiator of theoretical studies on the multi-functional development of rural areas.\nISBN: 978-83-941050-6-8\nFree publication\nRural Development Monitoring (MROW) is a joint project of the European Fund for Polish Rural Development Foundation and the Institute of Rural and Agricultural Development of the Polish Academy of Sciences, initiated in 2012. It is intended as a systematic examination of changes in spatial differentiation of socio-economic development of rural areas in Poland. The project focuses on the key economic and non-economic aspects of rural development, including the deagrarization of local economies, characteristics of agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, spatial accessibility of gminas, local public finance, labor markets, demographic changes, education, social activity, wealth of local communities, and living conditions. Stage I (2014) has provided information about the level and structure of socio-economic development of rural areas (a snapshot of socio-economic situation on the local level), while Stage II (2016) has added new knowledge about changes in development processes and factors influencing their dynamics (the pace and direction of the changes).\nMiedziana 3A, 00-814 Warszawa e-mail: efrwp@efrwp.com.pl www.efrwp.pl\nNowy \u015awiat 72, 00-330 Warszawa e-mail: irwir@irwirpan.waw.pl www.irwirpan.waw.pl"
