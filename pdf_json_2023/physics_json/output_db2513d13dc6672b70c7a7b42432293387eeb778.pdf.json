    "abstractText": "Metalloenzymes make extensive use of manganese centers for oxidative catalysis, including water oxidation; the need to develop improved synthetic catalysts for these processes has long motivated the development of bioinspired manganese complexes. Herein, we report a series of bpy-(imidazole)n (n = 1 or 2) (bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl) ligands and their Mn2+ complexes. Four Mn2+ complexes are structurally characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing different tridentate and tetradentate ligand coordination modes. Cyclic voltammetry of the complexes is consistent with ligand-centered reductions and metal-centered oxidations, and UV-vis spectroscopy complemented by TD-DFT calculations shows primarily ligand-centered transitions with minor contributions from charge-transfer type transitions at higher energies. In solution, ESI-MS studies provide evidence for ligand reorganization, suggesting complex speciation behavior. The oxidation of the complexes in the presence of water is probed using cyclic voltammetry, but the low stability of the complexes in aqueous solution leads to decomposition and precludes their ultimate application as aqueous electrocatalysts. Possible reasons for the low stability and suggestions for improvement",

Due to the rich oxidation state landscape commonly available to them (ranging at least from Mn2+ to Mn4+ in biological systems and beyond that in synthetic systems), manganese centers feature prominently in many enzymes that catalyze redox processes, including key small-molecule transformations such as water oxidation and superoxide disproportionation. Motivated in part by these examples in Nature, there has been a longstanding interest in the development of synthetic manganese complexes and catalysts that mimic the structure and/or function of manganese-containing metalloenzymes, particularly for oxidative transformations. Manganese centers in nature, especially those in monometallic or dimetallic active sites, are frequently supported by one or more histidine ligands. Coordination environments featuring three histidine ligands and one carboxylate (e.g., aspartate) coordinated to a manganese ion feature in a number of well-studied monometallic manganese enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and oxalate oxidase [1,2]. Examples of structurally characterized proteins containing a manganese center coordinated to more than three histidine ligands are uncommon but include some examples in proteins with particularly intriguing reactivity. For example, the cupin protein TM1459 has been determined to contain a tetrahistidine-coordinated manganese ion (Figure 1A); in vitro, this protein catalyzes oxidative alkene cleavage of styrene derivatives when combined with t-BuOOH, although\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7221. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28207221 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7221 2 of 25\nthe in vivo role of this protein is not currently known [3,4].

Interestingly, an analogous coordination environment is present in the iron-containing metalloenzyme apocarotenoid-15,15\u2032-oxygenase, which also catalyzes oxidative alkene cleavage in vivo [5] (Figure 1B). Taken together, these facts may suggest that this type of coordination environment and geometry is well-suited to oxidative cleavage reactivity. Mechanistic studies on manganese model complexes have also suggested that the presence of cis-disposed vacant sites is important for other types of oxidative reactivity, including the oxidation of water to O2 [6\u20139].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26\ncatalyzes oxidative alkene cleavage of styrene derivatives when combined with t-BuOOH, although the in vivo role of this protein is not curre tly known [3,4].

Because of the complexity of this active site, synthetic mimics have often focused on simplified systems. Some of the most successful functional mimics of manganese in the OEC have been dinuclear Mn complexes containing \u00b5-oxo bridges, supported by multidentate nitrogen-based ligand frameworks such as terpyridines; mechanistic studies on these systems have often highlighted the important role of manganese oxo or oxyl intermediates [11\u201315]. Efficient cluster-based mimics have also been reported [16]. Compared with the dinuclear \u00b5-oxo compounds, only a few mononuclear manganese complexes have been reported to mediate or catalyze water oxidation; Figure 2 shows some notable examples. A xanthene-appended manganese corrole complex (Figure 2A) reported by Sun was one of the first mononuclear compounds reported to be able to mediate water oxidation electrochemically, although the reaction was substoichiometric (turnover number (TON) = 0.05) [17]. The success of several related manganese corrole complexes in water oxidation reactions has been attributed in part to their ability to stabilize the Mn(III) resting state and promote further oxidation to higher oxidation states, including manganese oxos, at relatively mild redox potentials [17\u201321]. A mononuclear system reported by the Brudvig group (Figure 2B) uses a chelating pentadentate monoanionic nitrogen-donor ligand, including a carboxamido donor, highlighting that a ligand scaffold containing negatively charged groups can help stabilize the metal center at high oxidation states. In this report, oxygen evolution catalysis was carried out with a chemical oxidant (hydrogen peroxide or oxone) rather than electrocatalytically [22]. However, anionic donors are not strictly necessary, as evidenced by the report from Smith of a dicationic mononuclear manganese pyridinophane complex (Figure 2C) that is effective in electrocatalytic water oxidation (TON = 16\u201324) [23].

Selection of reported mononuclear manganese complexes that mediate or catalyze water oxidation [17,22,23].\nIn synthetic biomimetic ligands, as observed in several of the water oxidation systems discussed above, pyridine donors often serve as \u201cstand-ins\u201d for imidazoles. Although certainly chemically similar, there are key differences between pyridine and imidazole donors that could impact the reactivity of the resulting complexes; importantly, imidazoles are stronger donors than pyridine, as indirectly illustrated by the aqueous pKa values of their conjugate acids\u20145.23 for pyridinium and 6.95 for imidazolium (~6.0 for the side chain in histidine, specifically) [28]. In some recent examples, researchers have taken advantage of this difference by replacing pyridine donors with imidazoles, resulting in, for instance, enhanced water oxidation catalysis using a tetraimidazolyl\u2013pyridine cobalt complex [29]. Earlier examples include the use of imidazole donors in scorpionate-type ligands in an effort to mimic zinc metalloenzymes such as carbonic anhydrase and the incorporation of imidazole donors into a phenol-bridged dinucleating ligand designed to mimic bimetallic metalloenzyme sites [30\u201332]. In the latter case, a mixed-valent FeII/III complex of the imidazole-appended ligand was found to be significantly easier to oxidize (by about 250 mV) than an analogous complex of a ligand bearing pyridine donors instead, bolstering the aforementioned point that imidazoles can be stronger electron donors [32]. Manganese complexes supported by polyimidazole-containing nitrogen-donor ligands have long been explored in the context of biomimetic redox processes, although they still remain somewhat less thoroughly investigated than related pyridine-containing scaffolds; selected examples are shown in Figure 3 [33\u201341].\nFigure 2.

Many common organic ligands are prone to oxidative degradation, and design rules have been proposed to improve ligand stability under oxidizing conditions [42,43]. However, it is noteworthy that some of the previously explored examples of mononuclear manganese complexes for water oxidation, such as those reported by Brudvig (Figure 2B) and Smith (Figure 2C), bear vulnerable C-H bonds (\u03b1 to heteroaromatic rings) that are likely highly susceptible to oxidation. Given the above discussion, we sought to develop and test (in catalytic oxidations) new polydentate N-donor ligands for manganese that include biomimetic imidazole donors, have the potential to be oxidatively stable due to a lack of vulnerable C-H bonds, and give rise to a manganese center with cis-disposed labile sites as observed in the biological systems mentioned above. Therefore, in this study, we designed and prepared a series of new bpy-(imidazole)n (bpy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl) ligands for n = 1 or 2, abbreviated BPI1 and BPI2, respectively (Scheme 1). Four complexes of these ligands with Mn2+ are structurally characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analyses of the complexes are consistent with ligand-centered reductions and metal-centered oxidations. Unfortunately, studies in solution (ESI-MS and potentiometric titration) suggest that the complexes have low stability in aqueous solution; the electrocatalytic water oxidation behavior in aqueous solution was tested, but the observed activity was found to result primarily from the deposition of a heterogeneous species on the electrode.

The compounds had magnetic moments (measured using Evans method i d3-acetonitrile solution) of 5.9\u20136.1 \u00b5\u03b2, close to the expected value for high-spin manganese(II) centers; as is common for such co pounds, no discernible signals were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1\u20134 (d3-acetonitrile, 500 MHz, 298 K).

In the BPI1 complexes 1 and 2, the ligand binds as a tridentate, nearly planar meridional NNN pincer ligand. One coordinated acetonitrile ligand lies trans to the central pyridine ring in the ligand plane. The refined structure of complex 1 was found to contain three crystallographically inequivalent molecules; in one of the molecules, two water molecules bind in the remaining axial sites at the octahedral manganese center,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7221 6 of 25\nwhile for the other two molecules, the coordination sphere is completed by one water molecule and one perchlorate. The bis(aqua)-ligated complex is shown in Figure 4; the other two molecules have similar metrical parameters and are shown in the Supplementary Information (Figure S1). For complex 2, two triflate anions complete the coordination sphere in a mutually trans disposition. Complexes 1 and 2 have similar bond metrics with respect to the BPI1 ligand, such as the Mn\u2013N1N\u02c6N, Mn\u2013N2N\u02c6N, and Mn\u2013Nimi bond distances (2.132(8)\u20132.265(8) \u00c5) as well as the N-Mn-N bipyridine chelate angles, which span from 75.1(3)\u25e6 to 76.3(1)\u25e6. The bond lengths to the central pyridine rings are slightly longer than those of the flanking pyridine and imidazole donors (see Figure 4) [29,46,47]. As seen in the structures of complexes 3 and 4, the BPI2 ligand binds in a tetradentate fashion, occupying four sites in a distorted six-coordinate geometry. This ligand geometry leaves two labile, cis-disposed sites available for the coordination of solvents, counterions, or substrates, akin to the Mn2+-binding cupin protein shown in Figure 1A. It has been suggested that this type of chelate geometry may be particularly favorable for accelerating key steps in certain catalytic reactions, such as the O-O bond-forming step in water oxidation [6\u20139]. Both BPI2 complexes 3 and 4 exhibit slightly longer bond distances to the chelating ligand as compared with the BPI1 complexes, with Mn-N distances ranging from 2.221(2)\u20132.356(2) \u00c5. Notably, the chloride complex 3 has two particularly long bond lengths, with the Mn-N bond to the central pyridine ring at 2.356(2) \u00c5 and the Mn-N bond to the imidazole ring trans to one of the chloride ligands at 2.331(2) \u00c5, possibly due to the slightly stronger trans influence of the chloride ligands relative to the triflate ligands in 4. The two imidazole chelating N-Mn-N angles, with a span of 78.93(8)\u201383.77(19)\u25e6, are similar to those in previously reported pyridine\u2013tetraimidazole Co2+ complexes [29,48], suggesting that similar binding modes occur among the first-row transition metals in this general class of ligands. In all cases, the constraints of the chelating ligand result in distortions from an ideal octahedral coordination geometry. This can be quantified using the angular distortion parameters \u03a3 and \u0398, which relate to the ligand\u2013metal\u2013ligand and torsional angles around the metal center, respectively; both values are zero for a perfect octahedron and higher values indicate more distortion [49]. While the BPI1 complexes are moderately distorted (\u03a3 ~ 45\u201370\u25e6 and \u0398 ~ 170\u2013235\u25e6; see Table S3 for exact values), the complexes of the tetradentate BPI2 ligand (3 and 4) are severely distorted to the extent that they are no longer well-described as octahedral (\u03a3 ~ 190\u25e6 and \u0398 > 1100\u25e6). This is due to the constraints of the chelating BPI2 ligand; the ligand itself enforces a coordination environment that can roughly be described as trigonal monopyramidal, with the ancillary ligands (Cl\u2212 or OTf\u2212) occupying the remaining open pseudo-axial site(s)."

            "text": "The labile nature of metal\u2013ligand bonds for high-spin manganese(II) complexes means that the nature of complexes in solution may differ from that in the solid state (as observed in the crystal structures), and multiple species may exist in equilibrium in solution. For example, as is generally observed in related complexes, the labile anions in complexes 1, 2, and 4 (perchlorate or triflate) are likely displaced in the presence of coordinating solvents such as acetonitrile and water; this is already observed in the crystal structure of complex 1 where a mixture of perchlorate and solvent coordination was observed. Furthermore, aquated Mn2+ tends to bind relatively weakly to most ligands relative to other divalent first-row transition metals, making the preparation of strongly bound complexes in water solution challenging [50]. Since we were ultimately interested in applying these complexes in catalytic reactions, we sought to gain some insight into the solution speciation of manganese complexes of BPI1 and BPI2 using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of solutions of these complexes in acetonitrile and mixed acetonitrile/water solutions.

One at m/z = 354.05 amu can be attributed to a (BPI1)Mn(OH2)(OH)+ cation. Unexpectedly, a strong signal was also observed at m/z = 291.57 amu that could be attributed to a bisligated Mn2+ ion (BPI1)2Mn2+ (see Figure S25 for expanded view). This observation suggests that ligand redistribution occurs in solution and that a significant population of such a bisligated species may be present when the complex is dissolved in acetonitrile, despite the fact that both complex 1 and complex 2 crystallized in the solid state with a 1:1 ligand:metal ratio.

We note that this analysis and fitting of these potentiometric titration data are somewhat oversimplified since they do not account for the more complex speciation of 4 (e.g., the formation of clusters) observed by ESI-MS but should still provide a reasonable estimate of the speciation of free vs. coordinated Mn2+ in solution.\nTable 1.

The reductive features for complexes 1\u20134 are qualitatively similar to those observed for their ligands but shifted anodically as expected following metal coordination, suggesting that these reductions are also ligand-centered. The BPI1 complexes 1 and 2 have an irreversible reduction feature at Epc = \u22121.19 (1) or \u22121.07 (2), which most likely corresponds to the ketone-centered reduction observed for the ligand, given that no analogous feature is observed in the BPI2 complexes 3 and 4. Compound 2 has a second reduction at E1/2 = \u22121.90 V, which appears reversible, suggesting that the bipyridine-centered reduction observed in the ligand becomes more reversible upon metal coordination, presumably due to stabilization of the resulting bipyridine radical anion; the analogous feature is less well-defined in the sample of compound 1. The BPI2 complexes 3 and 4 both show one dominant redox feature near \u22122.0 V, again attributed to the ligand-centered reduction of the bipyridine moiety and anodically shifted from the free ligand reduction as expected. The smaller anodic shift of this feature for the BPI2 complexes relative to the BPI1 complexes may again be related to the weaker interaction of the Mn2+ centers with the bipyridine ligand, as suggested by the crystal structures and UV-vis absorption (see above). On the oxidative side, the behavior of the is dependent on the co-ligands/counterions on the metal center. Given this and the lack of oxidative features in the free ligand CVs, we attribute all oxidative features in the complexes to metal-centered oxidations. For the BPI1 complexes, significant oxidative waves are not observed; however, a small oxidative feature which could be related to the presence of trace water is present at approximately 0.8 V; note that although anhydrous solvent and electrolyte were used for the electrochemistry, complex 1 was isolated with coordinated water ligands. For the BPI2 complexes, complex 3 (chloride co-ligands) shows multiple redox features, suggesting that multielectron oxidation may be accessible on this scaffold, although we have not characterized the oxidation products. However, no well-defined oxidation features are observed in the triflate complex 4, suggesting that the presence of the more strongly-donating chloride ligands in 3 is important in enabling oxidation under these conditions. It should be noted that although complexes 2 and 4 crystallize with coordinated triflate ions, it is likely that these are displaced by acetonitrile in solution, as discussed above. Displacement of the triflate ligands to give rise to a dicationic species would be consistent with the lack of accessible oxidation features. Large shifts in oxidation potentials (\u2206 = 0.5 V) upon exchange of chloride ligands for acetonitrile have been observed in other studies of putative first-row transition-metal water oxidation catalysts supported by neutral polydentate nitrogen-donor ligands, consistent with our observations of a dramatic effect of co-ligands on the oxidation behavior [55,56]. The orbital nature of the reduction and oxidation processes (ligand- vs. metal-centered) was also supported by our DFT calculations on the corresponding species (complex 1 with water ligands, complex 3, and BPI2Mn(MeCN)22+, which was chosen as representative of the solution speciation of complex 4 as noted above). In all cases (Figures S9\u2013S11), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are ligand-centered, and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are metal-centered. The HOMO of complex 3 also includes significant contribution from the chloride ligands, whereas the ancillary water and acetonitrile ligands in the other complexes have only minor contributions, consistent with the different oxidation behavior observed for this complex; the HOMO of complex 3 also lies at significant higher energy than those of the other complexes.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7221 15 of 25\nGiven that these complexes show evidence for accessible metal-centered oxidations, albeit dependent on the nature of the coligands on Mn2+, we next sought to probe whether they were competent in electrochemical water oxidation catalysis."

Unfortunately, we could find no unambiguous evidence of water oxidation catalysis by complex 4 or other BPI2-ligated manganese species. For a 0.24 mM solution of 4, an increase in oxidative current is observed with an initial onset near 0.9 V and a rapid rise beginning near 1.3 V vs. NHE, with further current increases observed upon subsequent scans, suggestive of the deposition of an electrochemically active species on the surface of the electrode (Figure 15A). After 15 scans, a rinse test was performed (the electrode was lightly rinsed with deionized water and then placed into a fresh buffer solution); significant oxidative current was still observed (about 75% of the current observed for the previous scan; Figure 15A).

            "text": "In this study, we describe the synthesis of two novel polydentate imidazole-containing ligands and characterize a series of bpy\u2013(imidazole)n manganese(II) complexes prepared using a general synthetic strategy. These ligands may find broader utility in complexes of other first-row transition metals due to their biomimetic nature and the ability of the tetradentate ligand, BPI2, to engender a rigid coordination environment with two cisdisposed vacant coordination sites. The geometries of the manganese complexes are supported by crystallographic characterization. Cyclic voltammetry of the complexes is consistent with ligand-centered reductions and metal-centered oxidations (in the case of a chloride-ligated complex); this suggests the possibility for these ligands to function as redox-active moieties in possible future applications. While the addition of small amounts of water to the complexes in acetonitrile promoted oxidation, catalytic water oxidation in aqueous solution is precluded by the low stability of these complexes in water. Although we have not yet attempted to study in detail the speciation and decomposition of the complexes under catalytic conditions at various pHs, we can hypothesize some reasons for their apparently low stability. It is well known that the binding affinity of chelating ligands to manganese(II) in aqueous solution tends to be relatively low (compared with other divalent first-row transition metals) [50,57]. The stability of this type of compound tends to be particularly low at non-neutral pH; under acidic conditions, it is possible that competitive protonation of the accessible basic sites on the ligand) results in the dechelation of the ligand. Under basic conditions, binding of hydroxide to one or both of the labile metal sites of 4 could weaken the ligand-metal association further; due to the relatively low steric bulk of the ligands, the formation of oxide-bridged species (LMn-O-MnL) is a plausible pathway en route to decomposition to metal oxide/hydroxide products.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7221 18 of 25\nThe non-ideal binding geometry of the BPI2 ligand may also contribute to its lower stability. As noted above, the crystallographically characterized complexes of this ligand (3 and 4) showed a significantly distorted non-octahedral coordination environment. This can be attributed in part to the shape, size, and angles of the five-membered imidazole rings themselves; notably, a closely related previously reported tetrapyridine ligand shows a much less distorted coordination geometry (see Table S3; the stability of this complex was not discussed) [58]. Future ligand modifications for improved stability should likely include stronger donors, more favorable geometry, and possibly a higher denticity ligand, ideally without sacrificing the availability of two possible substrate coordination sites on the resulting complex: heptadentate and octadentate coordination at manganese(II) is possible and known on related systems, relying on appropriate design of the ligand geometry [59,60]. While more basic donors could be vulnerable to protonation leading to dechelation in an aqueous solution, careful ligand design could situate these donors in a sterically protected site where protonation would be kinetically disfavored. Greater steric protection around the metal site, for example, through the incorporation of bulkier substituents on the imidazoles, could also protect against multimetallic degradation pathways such as those that involve the initial formation of Mn-O-Mn linkages. The low stability of complexes 1\u20134 in aqueous water oxidation electrolysis does not preclude their potential utility in other oxidative transformations, such as the oxidation of organic substrates for synthetic applications. In future studies, we plan to continue our exploration of polyimidazole manganese complexes and expand their utility in oxidative catalysis through continued tuning of the ligand environment."

Calculations were carried out using the B3LYP functional with the D3 version of Grimme\u2019s dispersion correction with Becke-Johnson damping (GD3BJ) and the basis set 6\u2013311 g (d) for all atoms; a quadratically convergent procedure was used for SCF convergence [68,69]. Implicit solvation in MeCN was modeled using the polarizable continuum model and solvent-accessible surface model. Using the optimized geometry, single-point time-dependent DFT calculations were performed to determine the excited states and predict the optical spectra; for ligands, the first 20 excited states were calculated, and for complexes, the first 100 excited states were calculated. In simulated spectra, a Gaussian broadening of 0.28 eV (HWHM) was applied to approximate the broadening in the experimental spectra. For the complexes, most excited states were found to be composed of a large number of transitions between canonical molecular orbitals with no clear dominant transition; therefore, natural transition orbitals (NTOs) were calculated in Gaussian to visualize the excitations better [52]."

Prepared solutions, titrants, and analytes were protected with a nitrogen blanket throughout the measurement process. Measurements were carried out in 6 mL samples in a jacketed cell thermostatted to 25 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C for consistency. An approximately 0.05 M solution of NaOH was prepared from the stock sodium chloride solution and was used as the titrant for all measurements, protected at all times with a blanket of nitrogen. This was prepared from a commercially available 50% w% aqueous solution of NaOH. Also, from the stock sodium chloride solution, an approximate 0.01 M solution of HCl was prepared by dilution of a stock HCl aqueous solution. The exact concentration of the NaOH titrant was determined by standardization with potassium hydrogen phthalate, determining that the NaOH solution was 0.04963 M. Calibration titrations with the HCl analyte solutions were performed determining the solution of HCl to be 0.0116 M. BPI2 and Complex 4 solutions were prepared with the HCl analyte solution at concentration of 0.001735 M and 0.001470 M respectively. The standardization titrations were analyzed with the program pHcali to determine the pKw and to determine the Irving constants used to convert measured pHm values for the titrations to p[H+] values that were used for fitting the equilibria in HyperQuad2013 [70,71]. Data outside the Nernstian regime (pH < 2 or >12) were excluded from analysis in all cases. Measurements were carried out in triplicate, and these data were fit simultaneously. For Complex 4, only data below pH 8 were used for fitting log(KMn); at higher pH, a brown precipitate (most likely manganese oxide) was observed to form in the analyte solution.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28207221/s1, Table S1: Summary of crystallographic data; Table S2: Selected bond lengths and angles; Table S3: Angular Distortion Parameters; Figure S1: Full asymmetric unit of Complex 1; Figures S2\u2013S7: 1H and 13C NMR spectra of ligand precursors and ligands; Figure S8: EPR spectra; Figures S9\u2013S11: Orbital energy diagrams and frontier orbital pictures from DFT calculations; Figure S12: Overlaid calculated UV-Vis spectra; Figure S13: TDDFT results for ligands; Figure S14\u2013S15: Potentiometric titration data and speciation curves for ligand; Figure S16: CVs of complex 3 in acetonitrile with added water; Figure S17: CVs of MnCl2 in aqueous buffer; Figure S18: Aqueous CV scans for complex 4 at different pH\u2019s; Figure S19: CV scans of manganese(II) perchlorate with added BPI2 ligand; Figure S20\u2013S21: UV-Vis spectra of complexes 1 and 4 in water/acetonitrile mixtures; Figure S22: Data for controlled potential electrolysis of aqueous complex 4; Figure S23: UV-Vis spectra before and after electrolysis; Figure S24: photograph of O2 bubbles; Figure S25: Expanded ESI-MS data.
