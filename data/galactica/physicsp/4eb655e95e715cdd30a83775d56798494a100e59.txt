conclusion Glaucoma is a serious medical condition that can lead to blindness in adults if untreated. This condition is typically managed through the means of eye drops or laser eye surgery, but there currently exists no cure for this disease. Although there are small molecule inhibitor drugs for this condition, these drugs do not display the desired potency to effectively lower the intraocular pressure.1 Ghorai, et al. (2020) proposed that the binding affinity and potency of these drugs can be improved by altering functional groups to occupy more of the binding pocket in carbonic anhydrase II. In order to work towards the improvement of these drugs, this study aimed to improve the docking scores and active site interactions of the known sulfonamide drug, dichlorphenamide. Through computational analyses and rational design, two analogs of dichlorphenamide were proposed, Candidate 1 and 2. Both showed significant improvement in their docking scores with novel hydrogen bond interactions within the active site of CAII. These drugs possessed promising characteristics for the treatment of glaucoma, as they strongly interact with the three histidine catalytic residues. These catalytic residues, when bound to the candidates, can no longer interact with the Zn2+ cofactor of CAII, thus inhibiting the interconversion of carbon dioxide, and reducing the intraocular pressure of the eye. The two candidates designed in this study were screened for ADMET properties to test for safety and oral bioavailability, however, upon metabolism the characteristics of these drugs may change. The homologous protein in Mus musculus was analyzed to understand this speciesâ€™ potential use in pre-clinical trials to determine the effects these drugs could have in animals prior to human trials.
