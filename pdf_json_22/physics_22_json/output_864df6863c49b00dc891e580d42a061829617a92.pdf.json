Kivelson2\n1Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 2Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA\n3Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge MA 02138, USA (Dated: September 26, 2022)\nWe analyze the global ground-state (quantum) phase diagram of the one-dimensional Holstein model at half-filling as a function of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling (represented by the strength of the phonon-induced attraction, U) and the phonon frequency, \u03c90. In addition to reanalyzing the various asymptotic regimes, we have carried out density-matrix renormalization group simulations to correct previous inferences concerning the anti-adiabatic (large \u03c90) and strong coupling (large U) regimes. There are two distinct phases - a fully gapped commensurate chargedensity-wave and a spin-gapped Luther-Emery phase with a gapless charge mode - separated by a phase boundary, with a shape that reflects different microscopic physics in the weak and strong coupling limits.\nPACS numbers:\nThe interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibration plays a fundamental role in strongly correlated quasi-1D materials1\u20136,33. The Holstein model5 is probably one of the simplest microscopic models of coupled electrons and phonons, which makes it an ideal platform for exact numerical methods such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)13\u201316, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)7\u201311,22, and other algorithms17\u201319. Surprisingly, there remain some long-standing debates, even for the one dimension (1d) Holstein model at half filling, concerning basic facts about the structure of the zero temperature (T = 0) phase diagram, as well as discrepancies in the critical values of couplings that mark the phase boundaries obtained with different numerical methods7. While early studies inferred a single ordered phase for any nonzero electron-phonon coupling and finite phonon retardation20\u201322, more recent numerical results7,10\u201315 have suggested the existence of a disordered phase and at least one phase boundary. Specifically, Hirsch and Fradkin22 examined the behavior of the model as a function of \u03c90, the bare phonon frequency, and U , the bipolaron binding energy which is an appropriate characterization of the electron-phonon coupling strength, both measured in units of the electron bandwidth, 4|t|. Based on topological constraints on the nature of the phase diagram and other considerations, they speculated that the phase diagram exhibits only one phase - a fully gapped, longrange ordered charge-density-wave (CDW) phase - everywhere off these boundaries. They partially corroborated this conjecture with QMC studies - among the first such studies for a fermionic system.\nIn this paper, we revisit this problem and conclude that the correct quantum phase diagram of the half-filled 1D Holstein model is as shown schematically in Fig. 1. In addition to the CDW phase, there is also a Luther-Emery (LE) phase, which has a spin gap but a gapless charge mode and CDW quasi-long-range-order, i.e. it resembles an incommensurate fluctuating CDW. This structure of the phase diagram is consistent with the topolog-\nical arguments of Fradkin and Hirsch in that the phase boundary does not terminate on any of the edges of the phase diagram, but rather extends from the \u201ccorner\u201d at U = \u03c90 = 0 to that at U = \u03c90 \u2192\u221e.\nIn support of these conclusions, we have explored the behavior in the vicinity of the four edges of the phase diagram - each of the regions indicated by a different color of shading in Fig. 1. The analysis in the neighborhood of the upper (\u03c90 =\u221e) and left most (U = 0) edges is subtle as these correspond to quantum critical lines - and of course the two corners of the phase diagram at which the phase boundary starts and ends are of particular interest:\n1. We have derived an effective Hamiltonian in powers of t/\u03c90 and U/\u03c90 that is valid in the vicinity of the \u03c90 \u2192 \u221e (upper) edge of the phase diagram, and then solved it using high precision DMRG studies on very long (up to length L = 400) systems. We establish that the asymptotic equivalence between the CDW and LE correlations (i.e. the emergent SU(2) symmetry as \u03c90 \u2192\u221e) is lifted for large but finite \u03c90 so that there is a LE phase immediately below this edge of the phase diagram. This is in contrast to what was conjectured by Hirsch and Fradkin, and is our most important new result.\n2. We consider a strong coupling expansion of the model - originally derived by J. K. Freericks37 - to fourth order in t/U to explore the right edge of the phase diagram. Again, we use high precision DMRG studies to determine the behavior of this effective model, which (as was previously known) always has an ordered CDW phase if the limit U \u2192\u221e is taken at fixed \u03c90. However, we find that for large but finite U , there is a phase transition from a CDW ordered state for \u03c90 < yc U to a LE liquid phase for \u03c90 > yc U , where we estimate yc \u2248 0.45.\n3. The familiar Peierls instability ensures that for any fixed U > 0, the ground-state is an ordered CDW\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n05 49\n8v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 2\n3 Se\np 20\n22\n2\nin the limit \u03c90 \u2192 0, i.e. on the lower boundary of the phase diagram. Specifically, for \u03c90 = 0, a mean-field analysis is exact, which predicts a finite gap \u22060 = 4|t| exp(\u22122\u03c0|t|/U) for both charge and spin modes.\n4. The Fermi liquid state at U = 0 is perturbatively unstable (and in that sense is quantum critical), since weak attractive interactions inevitably lead to a state with a spin-gap. For small U and \u03c90, we present a field-theoretic analysis that suggests that the CDW state melts with increasing \u03c90 at an exponentially small value, \u03c90 = xc\u22060 \u223c exp(\u22122\u03c0|t|/U) Concerning larger values of \u03c90, but still in this weak coupling regime, we also briefly recap a previous functional RG analysis12 that shows the existence of a LE liquid phase everywhere proximate to the U \u2192 0 (left) edge of the phase diagram.\nAlong the way, we comment on the relation between our results and several other numerical studies7,10,15 that have been carried out since the pioneering work of Fradkin and Hirsch. We also present arguments suggesting that the lightly doped system exhibits a single LE liquid phase for all \u03c90 and U 6= 0."

Higher-order corrections to Heff are of order (t/\u03c90)\n4 and higher. The same effective Hamiltonian can be alternatively derived by a path integral representation. Detailed calculations are deferred to the Supplemental Material27.\nWe determined ground-state properties of this effective Hamiltonian using DMRG studies on systems up to 400 sites long for values of \u03c90 between 8 and\u221e and for values of U between 3 and 10. The values explored are indicated by the blue solid circles in the phase diagram in Fig. 1. The larger \u03c90 results are more reliable since this is where the effective model best approximates the original problem. All the DMRG data collected are obtained from the lowest energy state out of five trials with independently randomized initial states and all the results shown (unless otherwise stated) are extrapolated to zero truncation error, utilizing data collected with five truncation errors ranging from 1\u00d7 10\u22127 to 9\u00d7 10\u22127. We have checked our results do not change significantly down to truncation error 1\u00d710\u221210, corresponding to keeping bond dimensions up to m = 1500. All data involving sites within Nx/4 to the open boundary are discarded, i.e. we only retain the data on the interval x \u2208 [Nx/4, 3Nx/4], to reduce boundary effects.\nOur findings can be summarized as follows, in all cases, we conclude that the system is in a LE phase, characterized by a spin-gap and a single gapless charge mode. The presence of a spin-gap is inferred from the fact that the spin-spin correlation function falls exponentially with distance, as shown in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4, the existence of a gapless charge mode follows from the observation that the charge-density correlations oscillate with wave-vector \u03c0, and have an amplitude that falls as a power of distance, i.e. as ei\u03c0r|r|\u2212Kc . The inferred values of the charge Luttinger exponent Kc are shown in Fig. 5 for all the values of U and \u03c90 we have explored. As expected, Kc \u2192 1 as \u03c90 \u2192\u221e, independent of U . Significantly, however, for \u03c90 large but not infinite, we find that Kc > 1. This is an important consistency check, as Umklapp scattering that could stabilize a long-range ordered CDW phase is perturbatively irrelevant for Kc > 1, but would be relevant for Kc < 1.\nWe have carried out two further consistency checks of our results. We have computed the central charge, as shown in Fig. 6, and in all cases, we find values consistent with c = 1 within our uncertainty. This is the expected value for a LE liquid; these results are surely inconsistent with the c = 0 expected of a commensurate CDW with long-range order. We have also examined the nature of the state slightly away from the half-filled case. If commensurability effects are irrelevant for n = 1, then the\nsystem is expected to evolve continuously with doping, \u03b4 \u2261 1\u2212 n > 0. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we find that both the spin gap (or more precisely, the correlation length characterizing the exponential falloff of the spin correlations) and the charge Luttinger exponent evolve continuously with \u03b4. Were the system commensurate, we would expect a factor of 2 discontinuity in the spin-gap and a jump of the Luttinger exponent to Kc \u2248 2 for 0 < \u03b4 1."

(By contrast, a CDW insulator with a spin gap would definitionaly exhibit long-range order at long-distances, C(x) \u223c m2ei\u03c0x, where m is the order parameter, and should approach this asymptotic behavior exponentially.)

In the limit \u03c90 \u2192 \u221e, since the Holstein model maps to the attractive Hubbard model, which has a charge SU(2) symmetry, the value ofKC must approach 1, as can be seen in the figure.

The quality of the fits to Eq.(9) can be seen for representative parameters in Fig. 7; the precise values of c obtained from such fits for various \u03c90 and U are shown in Fig. 6, where we have assumed that q = kF .

In the anti-adiabatic limit (S \u2192 0), these values agree with those in the strong coupling expansion of the attractive Hubbard model:\nt1 S\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1\n4 ( 4t2 |U | \u2212 16t 4 |U |3 )\nt2 S\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 1\n4\n4t4\n|U |3\nV1 S\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 t1\nV2 S\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 t2.\n(16)\nIn the opposite limit S \u2192\u221e, only V1 remains non-zero and we obtain classical lattice gas, which has a CDW\nFIG. 10: An illustration of t1, t2, V1, V2 as functions of the polaron band narrowing parameter S = |U |/\u03c90, with t = 1. Here we use |U | = 5 as an example.\nground state as expected. With the coefficients determined, we then solve the effective pseudospin Hamiltonian Eq.(14) with DMRG and measure the spin-spin correlation function and the structure factor at k = \u03c0:\nJ(x) = 1\nNr \u2211 r \u3008Jz(r)Jz(r + x)\u3009\nJ(k = \u03c0) = \u2211 x ei\u03c0xJ(x) = \u2211 x (\u22121)xJ(x) (17)\nBecause the phase transition between the CDW and LE phases is a commensurate to incommensurate transition, when it is continuous, it should be in the KosterliztThouless university class. Therefore, in the CDW phase, we should see an antiferromagnetic pattern of pseudospin order and J(k = \u03c0) \u223c M2L with M the order parameter approaching 12 as \u03c90 decreases. And in the LE liquid phase, the spin-spin correlation should exhibits power-law behavior J(k = \u03c0) \u223c L1\u2212\u03b7 where \u03b7 > 1/4 such that \u03b7 \u2192 1/4 upon approach to the transition point. In this spirit, we plot J(k = \u03c0)/L for L = 100, 150, 300. As shown in Fig. 11, there is a clear crossing point at \u03c90 \u2248 67 for J(k = \u03c0)/L3/4 with different L , which thus confirms the existence of a KT transition between the CDW and the LE phases in the strong-coupling limit."

The model at points A - (U = 0.6, \u03c90 = 0.5), C - (1.2, 0.5), D - (1.62, 1.2), and E - (1.62, 0.4), were studied\n8\nusing QMC (CT-INT method), A and C at a temperature such that \u03b2t = 50, while for D and E \u03b2t = 207. On the basis of these studies, it was inferred that A is in the LE phase, while C, D, and E are in the CDW phase. On the basis of an early DMRG study, it was concluded that point F - (2, 1) is in a CDW phase15. The two remaining points, B - (1.0, 0.5) and G - (3, 5), were identified as quantum critical points using a stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo method10, augmented by a finite-size scaling analysis.\nThere are manifestly some discrepancies between the conclusions drawn on the basis of these different numerical studies. Similarly, the smooth dotted line for the phase boundary shown in Fig. 1 is somewhat to the right of the optimal phase boundary one might draw on the basis of the earlier numerics. Due to the rather high temperature at which the QMC studies were conducted in comparison to the theoretically expected exponentially small CDW gap, we think that while these results may be qualitatively right, it should be expected that they will not be quantitatively precise. In any case, it is presently unclear if the detailed shape of this phase boundary should be adjusted to better accommodate the results of contemporary numerical studies, or if one should stick to the present smooth interpolation and attribute the discrepancies to numerical uncertainty."

            "text": "Slightly away from half filling, it is likely that there is a single LE phase everywhere in the phase diagram. The spin-gap that characterizes both phases of the halffilled system is expected to extend smoothly to the lightly doped system. On the other hand, the generalized Luttinger\u2019s theorem insures that for an incommensurate electron density, there must be a gapless mode at 2kF . Thus, the only plausible phase is a LE liquid with a spin-gap and power law CDW correlations.\nThere is one subtlety here worth noting. For \u03c90 = 0, slight doping is expected to produce a state consisting of an array of solitons or discommensurations.33 These will produce mid-gap states, resulting in a spin-gap that is half the value of the spin-gap in the undoped system. Upon including quantum fluctuations (i.e. for small but non-zero \u03c90) the soliton lattice will melt to form a powerlaw phase with Kc = 2 (corresponding to dilute hard-core bosons or spinless fermions), but the spin-gap is expected to be largely unaffected.\nIt is also possible that at larger deviations from halffilling, CDW order with higher order commensurability - for example for the 1/3 filled band - can arise, especially in the small \u03c90 limit."

            "text": "Our major finding is the phase diagram in Fig. 1. The topology of the phase diagram rests on general arguments, although the possibility of additional phases at intermediate U/t and \u03c90/t has not been definitively excluded. Moreover, the asymptotic forms of the phase boundary in the upper and lower corners of the phase diagram have been supported by what we believe to be a convincing analysis. The dotted part of the phase diagram is a sketch, drawn so as to smoothly connect with the established results in the asymptotic regimes. The quantitative disagreements between this sketch and some of the earlier numerical results (indicated by the grey points in the figure) may either reflect some quantitative uncertainty in those results or may imply a more convoluted shape to the phase boundary.\nThe phase transition between the CDW and LE phases is a commensurate to incommensurate transition, so where it is continuous it should be described by a 1+1 dimensional sine-Gordon theory and should thus be in the Kosterliz-Thouless universality class. This has been verified by the strong coupling calculations in the upper right corner of the phase diagram. However, it is not precluded that it could be first order along other parts of its extent.\n9"

Effective Hamiltonian in the anti-adiabatic limit\nIn this Appendix, we provide details on the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian that provides the first corrections around the anti-adiabatic limit, \u03c90 \u2192 \u221e. We do this in two ways, first via a path integral technique and then with Hamiltonian methods.\n10\nPath integral approach\nIn path integral language, the Euclidean action is\nS[\u03c8\u2020, \u03c8, v] = \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4 \u2211 ij \u03c8\u2020i\u03c3[(\u2202\u03c4 + \u00b5)\u03b4ij + tij ]\u03c8j\u03c3 + \u2211 i [ M 2 (\u2202\u03c4vi) 2 + K 2 v2i ] + \u03b1 \u2211 i vi\u03c8 \u2020 i\u03c3\u03c8i\u03c3  (18) = \u2211 n \u2211 ij \u03c8\u2020i\u03c3,n[(i\u03c9n + \u00b5)\u03b4ij + tij ]\u03c8j\u03c3,n + 1 2 \u2211 i vi,\u2212n(M\u03bd 2 n +K)vi,n + \u03b1 \u2211 i vi,\u2212n\u03c1i\u03c3,n\n . (19) In the second line we transform to Matsubara frequencies \u03c9n = (2n + 1)\u03c0/\u03b2, \u03bdn = 2n\u03c0/\u03b2 and we define the density \u03c1i\u03c3 = \u03c8 \u2020 i\u03c3\u03c8i\u03c3. The phonon Green\u2019s function is\nD(\u03bdn) = 1\nM\u03bd2n +K =\n1\nK \u03c920 \u03bd2n + \u03c9 2 0 \u2192 { \u03b4\u03bdn,0/K \u03c90 \u2192 0, 1/K \u03c90 \u2192\u221e\n(20)\nIntegrating out the phonon fields yields a retarded electron-electron interaction:\nSint[\u03c8 \u2020, \u03c8] = \u2212\u03b1\n2\n2 \u2211 n \u2211 i\u03c3 \u03c1i\u03c3,\u2212nD(\u03bdn)\u03c1i\u03c3,n = \u2212 \u03b12 2K \u2211 n \u2211 i\u03c3 \u03c1i\u03c3,\u2212n ( \u03c920 \u03bd2n + \u03c9 2 0 ) \u03c1i\u03c3,n (21)\nFor \u03c90 =\u221e, the interaction is instantaneous and we recover the attractive Hubbard model with U = \u03b12/K. We can expand around this limit in powers of 1/\u03c90. This is equivalent to a gradient expansion in imaginary-time derivatives. The result is\nSint = \u2212 U\n2 \u2211 n \u2211 i\u03c3 \u03c1i\u03c3,\u2212n\u03c1i\u03c3,n + U 2\u03c920 \u2211 n \u2211 i\u03c3 \u03c1i\u03c3,\u2212n\u03bd 2 n\u03c1i\u03c3,n +O ( 1 \u03c940 ) (22)\nIn imaginary time, the second term is\nS (2) int = \u2212\nU\n2\u03c920 \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4 \u2211 i\u03c3 (\u2202\u03c4\u03c1i\u03c3) 2. (23)\nHamiltonian approach\nFor a Hamiltonian approach, consider a unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian H \u2032 = UHU\u2020, U = \u220f i ei\u03b1pini/K (24)\nwhere \u03c1i = \u2211 \u03c3 \u03c1i\u03c3 = \u2211 \u03c3 c \u2020 i\u03c3ci\u03c3. The result is\nH \u2032 = \u2212 \u2211 ij tije i\u03b1(pi\u2212pj)/Kc\u2020i\u03c3cj\u03c3 \u2212 U 2 \u2211 i \u03c12i + \u2211 i p2i 2M + K 2 v2i . (25)\nThe transformation removes the bilinear electron-phonon coupling, at the cost of introducing an attractive interaction electron-electron interaction and adding electron-phonon interaction into the hopping matrix elements. To find an expansion around \u03c90 = \u221e, rewrite the phonon coordinates and conjugate momenta in terms of the creation and annihilation operators:\np = i \u221a M\u03c90/2(b \u2020 \u2212 b) \u21d2 ei\u03b1p/K = e\u2212 \u221a U/(2\u03c90)(b \u2020\u2212b), (26)\nso that we may expand\nH \u2032 \u2248 \u2212 \u2211 ij tij\n{ 1 + \u221a U\n2\u03c90 [(bj \u2212 b\u2020j)\u2212 (bi \u2212 b \u2020 i )]\n} c\u2020i\u03c3cj\u03c3 \u2212 U\n2 \u2211 i \u03c12i + \u03c90 \u2211 i (b\u2020i bi + 1/2). (27)\n11\nSpecializing to the case of nearest-neighbor hopping, this expansion yields a coupling between the conjugate momentum of the phonon and the \u201clattice divergence\u201d of the current:\nH\u0303 (2) int =\n\u221a U\n2\u03c90 \u2211 n\u03c3 i(bn \u2212 b\u2020n)(jn \u2212 jn\u22121), (28)\nwhere the local current operator is\njn = it(c \u2020 ncn+1 \u2212 c \u2020 n+1cn). (29)\nIn momentum space,\nH\u0303 (2) int =\n\u221a U\n2N\u03c90 t \u2211 kq\u03c3 fkq(bq \u2212 b\u2020\u2212q)c \u2020 k+q\u03c3ck\u03c3 (30)\nwhere\nfkq = \u22122i[cos(k + q)\u2212 cos k]. (31)\nDirect perturbation theory about the \u03c90 =\u221e limits yields the effective electron-electron interaction:\nH (2) int = \u2212\nU\nN\n( t\n\u03c90 )2\u2211 kq Vkk\u2032qc \u2020 k+q\u03c3ck\u03c3c \u2020 k\u2032\u2212q\u03c3\u2032ck\u2032\u03c3\u2032 , (32)\nwhere\nVkk\u2032q = fk,qfk\u2032,\u2212q = \u22124(1\u2212 cos q)[cos(k + k\u2032)\u2212 cos(k \u2212 k\u2032 + q)] (33)\nThe continuity equation relates Eqs. (32) and (23).\nB. The adiabatic limit \u03c90 \u2192 0 (Derivation for the TLM model)\nTakayama, Lin-Liu, and Maki (TLM) have found a remarkable analytic solution for solitons in a condensed CDW system and their model is a continuum version of the SSH model32,33,36. With similar treatment, we find in the continuum limit, the effective field theory of the Holstein model is also the TLM model. Here is a short derivation. The Holstein model is defined as:\nH = \u2212t \u2211 n,\u03c3 (c\u2020n\u03c3Cn+1,\u03c3 +H.c.)\u2212 \u03bb \u2211 n,\u03c3 xnnn\u03c3 + 1 2 K \u2211 n x2n + 1 2 M \u2211 n x\u0307n 2 (34)\nLet\nxn = e i\u03c0nzn (35)\nThen the coupling term becomes: \u03bb \u2211 n,\u03c3 (\u22121)nznc\u2020n,\u03c3cn,\u03c3 = \u03bb \u2211 n,\u03c3 \u2211 kqq\u2032 zk e iknei\u03c0neiqne\u2212iq \u2032nc\u2020q,\u03c3cq\u2032,\u03c3\n= \u03bb \u2211 kqq\u2032,\u03c3 zk c \u2020 q,\u03c3cq\u2032,\u03c3\u03b4k+\u03c0+q\u2212q\u2032 = \u03bb \u2211 kq,\u03c3 zk c \u2020 q,\u03c3c\u03c0+k+q,\u03c3\n(36)\nNow let p = q \u2212 \u03c02 and p \u2032 = q\u2032 + \u03c02 \u03bb \u2211 kq,\u03c3 zk c \u2020 q,\u03c3c\u03c0+k+q,\u03c3 = \u03bb \u2211 k,|p|<\u03c02 ,\u03c3 zk c \u2020 kF+p,\u03c3 c\u2212kF+k+p,\u03c3 + \u03bb \u2211 k,|p|<\u03c02 ,\u03c3 zk c \u2020 \u2212kF+p,\u03c3ckF+k+p,\u03c3\n= \u222b dx \u03bbz(x) [ L\u2020\u03c3(x)R\u03c3(x) +R \u2020 \u03c3(x)L\u03c3(x) ] (37)\n12\nThe free fermion part is (set ~ = vF = 1):\nH0 = \u2211 \u03c3 \u222b dx\u2212 (R\u2020\u03c3i\u2202xR\u03c3 \u2212 L\u2020\u03c3i\u2202xL\u03c3) = \u2211 \u03c3 \u222b dx \u03c8\u2020\u03c3(x)[\u2212i\u03c3z\u2202x]\u03c8\u03c3(x) (38)\nwhere \u03c8\u03c3(x) is a spinor made up of the right-moving R\u03c3(x) and left-moving L\u03c3(x) components of the Fermi field near the Fermi points.

The strong-coupling U \u2192\u221e limit\nThe strong-coupling expansion for the 1D Holstein model can be schematically expressed as the following diagrams. (a) denotes the hopping of an electron from site i to site j then back to site i, which is the only possibility for the second-order term. Similarly, (b),(c) represent two possible fourth-order processes while the unlinked diagram is not included here since its contributions vanish.\nThen with pseudospin operators defined as Eq.(15), the corresponding terms in the effective Hamiltonian are37:\nH(2) = 1\n2 \u2211 i\n[ j\n(2) \u22a5 (i)\n1\n2\n( J+i J \u2212 i+1 + J \u2212 i J + i+1 ) + j (2) \u2016 (i) ( Jzi J z i+1 \u2212 1\n4\n)] (41)\nH(4) = 1\n2 \u2211 i\n[( j\n(4) \u22a5 (i) + j \u2032 \u22a5(i) )1 2 ( J+i J \u2212 i+1 + J \u2212 i J + i+1 ) + j\u2032\u2032\u22a5(i) 1 2 ( J+i J \u2212 i+2 + J \u2212 i J + i+2 )\n+ ( j\n(4) \u2016 (i)\u2212 j \u2032 \u2016(i) )( Jzi J z i+1 \u2212 1\n4\n) + ( j\u2032\u2016(i) + j \u2032\u2032 \u2016 (i) )( Jzi J z i+2 \u2212 1\n4\n)] (42)\nwhere the explicit expressions for eight coefficients are37:\nj (2) \u22a5 = \u22122\n( \u2212 2t 2\n|U | e\u22122S\n)( 1 + \u221e\u2211 n=1\nSn\n(S + 1)(S + 2)...(S + n)\n)\nj (2) \u2016 = \u22122\n( \u2212 2t 2\n|U |\n)( 1 + \u221e\u2211 n=1\n(\u2212S)n\n(S + 1)(S + 2)...(S + n)\n) (43)\n13\nj (4) \u22a5 =\n8t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S [ \u221e\u2211 m,m\u2032=0 m+m\u2032 6=0 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy (xy)S\u22121 2cosh[S(x\u2212 y)] (S/2) m+m\u2032(1\u2212 x2)m(1\u2212 y2)m\u2032 m!m\u2032!(m+m\u2032)\n\u2212 \u221e\u2211\nm,m\u2032=0\nSm+m \u2032\nm!m\u2032!\n(\u22121)m + (\u22121)m\u2032\n(m+ S)2(m\u2032 + S)\n] (44)\nj (4) \u2016 =\n8t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S [ \u221e\u2211 m,m\u2032=0 m+m\u2032 6=0 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy (xy)S\u22121 ( eS(x+y) (S/2)m+m \u2032 (1\u2212 x)2m(1\u2212 y)2m\u2032 m!m\u2032!(m+m\u2032)\n+ e\u2212S(x+y) (S/2)m+m\n\u2032 (1 + x)2m(1 + y)2m \u2032\nm!m\u2032!(m+m\u2032)\n) \u2212\n\u221e\u2211 m,m\u2032=0 Sm+m \u2032 m!m\u2032! 1 + (\u22121)m+m\u2032 (m+ S)2(m\u2032 + S)\n] (45)\nj\u2032\u22a5 = 4t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S [\u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy \u222b 1 0 dz(xyz)S\u22121 ( exp {S 2 [x\u2212 y + z \u2212 2z(x\u2212 y)\u2212 xyz] } + exp {S 2 [x\u2212 y \u2212 z(x+ y)] })\n+ 2 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy(xy)S\u22121eS(x\u2212y) \u221e\u2211 m=1 (S/2)m(1\u2212 x)m(1 + y)m m!m + \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy(xy)S\u22121eS(x\u2212y)(lnx + lny) ] (46)\nj\u2032\u2032\u22a5 = \u2212 4t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S [\u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy \u222b 1 0 dz(xyz)S\u22121exp {1 2 S[x+ y + z \u2212 2z(x+ y) + xyz] }\n+ 2 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy(xy)S\u22121e\u2212S(x+y) \u221e\u2211 m=1 (S/2)m(1 + x)m(1 + y)m m!m + 2 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy(xy)S\u22121e\u2212S(x+y)lnx ] (47)\nj\u2032\u2016 = \u2212 4t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S [\u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy \u222b 1 0 dz(xyz)S\u22121 ( exp {S 2 [\u2212x\u2212 y + z + 2z(x+ y) + xyz] }\n+ exp {S\n2 [\u2212x\u2212 y + 2z + z(x+ y) + 2xyz]\n})\n+ 2 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy (xy)S\u22121eS(x+y) \u221e\u2211 m=1 (S/2)m(1\u2212 x)m(1\u2212 y)m m!m + 2 \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy (xy)S\u22121eS(x+y)lnx ] (48)\nj\u2032\u2032\u2016 = 4t4\n|U |3 S3e\u22122S \u222b 1 0 dx \u222b 1 0 dy \u222b 1 0 dz (xyz)S\u22121exp {1 2 S[x+ y + 2z \u2212 z(x+ y) + 2xyz] } (49)\nHere the combination t and U comes out as the overall energy scale. And the only tuning parameter is the dimensionless retardation factor S \u2261 U/\u03c90. We evaluate the values of eight coefficients as functions of S as shown in Fig. 13. Then\n14\nt1, t2, V1, V2 can be determined through Eq. (50) and are plotted in Fig. 10. We see at finite |U |, as S \u2192 0, i.e. \u03c90 \u2192\u221e (the Hubbard limit), the values of t1, t2, V1, V2 match the analytic expressions given in Eq.
