It is native to South America, and its seeds are an abundant source of geranylgeraniol and tocotrienols. Nanoencapsulation is a valuable technique that can decrease the drug needed to achieve an effect, decreasing potential toxicity and side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the acute toxicity of an intramuscular application of a nanodispersion containing a standardized extract (Chronic\u00ae) from the seeds of Bixa orellana (NBO) in Wistar rats. The chemical evaluation showed \u03b4-tocotrienol at 0.725 \u00b1 0.062 mg/ml (72.6 \u00b1 0.9%). The stability study showed the nanoparticles had an average size from 53.15 \u00b1 0.64 nm to 59.9 \u00b1 3.63 nm, with a polydispersity index ranging from 0.574 \u00b1 0.032 to 0.574 \u00b1 0.32, Zeta potential from 18.26 \u00b1 0.59 mV to 19.66 \u00b1 1.45 mV. After testing the intramuscular application of NBO with doses from 1 to 5 mg/kg in animals, it was observed that the acute treatment did not elicit any toxic effects within this range. The dose of 10 mg/kg, although not affecting hematological and biochemical parameters (CPK, LDH, myoglobin, AST, ALT), could induce some muscle tissue changes, including leukocyte in ltration, morphological chances, and potentially necrosis. In conclusion, the results showed that the treatments devoided toxicity between 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg.\nIntroduction Bixa orellana is a plant species known as urucum, annatto, and achiote. Its seeds have geranylgeraniol and tocotrienols. Both compounds exert health-promoting effects, including improvement of the bloodlipids pro le, prevention of metabolic syndrome, improvement of cardiovascular system health, neuroprotection, among others (Matias Pereira et al. 2021; Batista et al. 2022).\nTocotrienols are compounds that belong to the family of Vitamin E. There are four tocotrienols isomers: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. Structurally, tocotrienols have a chromanol ring identical to those of tocopherols. However, the isoprenoid tail from tocotrienols has three unsaturations, which brings some bene ts to them (Qureshi and Khan 2015; Peh et al. 2016).\nNanoencapsulation is a technological process in which bioactive compounds are coated with a protecting material; these formulations can release their content in a controlled manner under speci c conditions. Some of the main advantages that can be achieved with nanoencapsulation are: controlling the content release, masking unpleasant avors, improving the bioavailability, consequently decreasing the amount of drug needed to achieve an effect, saving drug, and decreasing potential toxicity (De Jesus and Zuhorn 2015; Apolin\u00e1rio et al. 2020).\nToxicity studies are performed to study compounds\u2019 potential toxicity in organs, their dose-toxicity relationship, the potential toxicity mechanisms of action, diagnosis and treatment of toxic reactions, consequences of exposures, among others (Silva et al. 2021). Acute toxicity is one of the required parameters to asses according to ANVISA. This organ gives information about administration frequency, period of exposure, local effects, and histopathological changes (Ag\u00eancia de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria 2013).\nPage 4/20\nConsidering the information given, this study aimed to test the safety of an injectable nanodispersion containing a standardized oil of Bixa orellana L. (Chronic\u00ae) using Wistar rats.\nMaterials And Methods Bixa orellana\u00a0oil obtention and chemical analysis\nThe material (Chronic\u00ae) was kindly provided by the company Ages Bioactive Compounds, lot 0012/2022. A stock solution of \u03b4-tocotrienol was prepared in hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, MKCF5755, CG grade, Germany) in 10 mg/mL. From this stock solution, other solutions were prepared to build a concentration curve: 2.5 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, and 0.1 mg/mL. The chromatographic running (GC-MS) was performed as previously described by our group (Rodrigues et al. 2022).\nPolymeric nanoparticle obtention\nThe nanoparticulate polymeric system containing the oil of B. orellana\u00a0(Chronic\u00ae) was obtained using the nanoprecipitation method, adapted from (Gandhi et al. 2014). This method relies on the precipitation or interfacial deposition of a formed polymer. For 20 mL of nanodispersion of B. orellana oil (NBO) was used puri ed oil, polyethyleneglycol 4000 (PEG 4000), Tween-80, absolute ethanol, and saline solution (BR 10 2022 006416 4, Patent).\nFirst was prepared the organic phase by solubilizing the oil with PEG 4000 on absolute ethanol under magnetic stirring (Fisatom, SP, Brazil) for 20 min. The aqueous phase was prepared with Tween-80 and saline solution under magnetic stirring for 20 min. Finally, the organic phase was added to aqueous phase under agitation for 20 minutes, and the nanodispersion obtained was characterized.\nAnimals and ethic aspects\nThis study used three weeks old male Wistar rats from the CEMIB department of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). During the study the animals were kept in polyethylene cages (60 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 22 cm) on ventilated cabinets (5 animals/cage). The room had controlled temperature (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C), 12h dark/light cycle, and the animals had free access to food and water. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Animals Use from the Federal University of Amap\u00e1 (CEUA, UNIFAP), under n\u00b0 002/2022.\nAcute toxicity assessment of NBO injection\nIn the acute toxicity screening, the animals (260 \u2013 280g) were divided into ve groups (n = 4 / group) and received a single intramuscular injection in the gastrocnemius. The groups were divided as follows:\nCON: Control group. Injected with vehicle (4% Tween-80, 0.4 mL);\nNBO 1: Injected with NBO at 1 mg/kg (0.04 mL);\nNBO 2.5: Injected with NBO at 2.5 mg/kg (0.1 mL)\nPage 5/20\nNBO 5: Injected with NBO at 5 mg/kg (0.2 mL);\nNBO 10: Injected with NBO at 10 mg/kg (0.4 mL).\nThis study followed the guidelines of \u00a0Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD 2001) and ANVISA (Ag\u00eancia de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria 2013). After performing the treatments, the animals were subjected to observational screening to assess physical activity, re exes, and SNC function. The following parameters were evaluated: vocal fremitus, irritability, touch response, tail touch response, contortion, body tonus, grip strength, ataxia, auricular re ex, corneal re ex, tremors/convulsions, anesthesia, lacrimation, urination and defecation, piloerection, cianosis/hyperemia, and death. These parameters were assessed 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h post injection and then daily until the fourth day.\nOther parameters observed were water, food intake, and weight gain until the fourth-day post-treatment. After this period, the animals were anesthetized with sodium thiopental at 45 mg/kg (Crist\u00e1lia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil) to gather 1.5 mL of blood from the retroorbital plexus for biochemical and hematological analysis.\u00a0\nBiochemical and hematological analysis\nThe blood collected was centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm. All analysis was performed using kits (Doles\u00ae, Goi\u00e2nia \u2013 GO, Brazil) and a spectrophotometer UV-VIS model UV-mini 1240 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The markers assessed were aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), myoglobin, creatine kinase (CPK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\nThe hematological analysis was performed using an automatic counter HumaCount Plus (Human GMBH, Germany). The following parameters were observed: blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, mean corpuscular size (MCS), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and leucocytes (total, segmented, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) (Silva Lima et al. 2017)\nMuscle histopathology\nAfter euthanization, the gastrocnemius that received an injection from the animals was removed to be evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. For histopathological analysis, the muscle tissue was xed in buffered formaldehyde (10%) for 24 hours and then dehydrated in crescent concentrations of ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%), clari ed in xylene and embedded in para n at 60 \u00b0C. The sections were cut using a rotary microtome CUT 5062 (SLEE) in 5 \u00b5m and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (Vasconcelos et al. 2011; Carvalho et al. 2018). The slides were observed with 400x magnitude.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data was presented as a mean \u00b1 SD, and the groups were compared using One-Way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test in case of statistical signi cance, considering p < 0.05 statistically signi cant.\nPage 6/20\nResults And Discussion \u0394-Tocotrienol quanti cation in B. orellana puri ed oil\nThe calibration curve of \u03b4-tocotrienol had R\u00b2 equal to 0.9973 (Fig.\u00a01), and the line equation achieved was . The chromatogram shown in Fig.\u00a02 shows \u03b4-tocotrienol at a retention time of 28.6 min. The fragment pattern read by the library and compared to the external standard con rms this peak as \u03b4-tocotrienol, with an average concentration of 0.725 \u00b1 0.062 mg/ml (72.6 \u00b1 0.9 % of the oil). This is inaccordance with other studies reporting this molecule as the major compound from B. orellana oil (Aggarwal et al. 2010; Mohamad et al. 2018).\nNanodispersion of B. orellana oil characterization\nThe method used to produce the nanoparticles in this study is known as the solvent displacement method. It consists of the interfacial deposition of a polymer after the displacement of an organic solvent from a lipophilic solution to an aqueous phase. Due to the spontaneous diffusion of the polymer to the aqueous phase, the nanoparticles are formed instantly (Martins et al. 2010; Souto et al. 2012).\nTo form the nanoparticulate formulation containing the oil, nanoprecipitation was used, adapted from (Gandhi et al. 2014). During the tests, no instability-related signs, such as phase separation, were observed, and the visual aspect was visibly stable among the formulation components. The formulation had a slightly yellow color and pH of 5.8.\nNanoparticles produced through nanoprecipitation typically have a well-de ned size and narrow size distribution range; they are often more e cient than those produced through emulsi cation and evaporation (Crucho and Barros 2017). The nanoparticles used in this study were stable, with 53.15 \u00b1 0.64 nm size and 0.574 \u00b1 0.032 PDI on the rst day and 59.90 \u00b1 3.63 nm with 0.574 \u00b1 0.032 PDI on the 30\u00b0 day. The zeta potential was 18.26 \u00b1 0.59 mV on the rst day and 19.66 \u00b1 1.45 mV on the 30\u00b0 day (Table 1; Fig. 3).\u00a0\ny = 8,30 \u00d7 106x \u2212 2,818 \u00d7 106\nPage 7/20\nIn general, studies suggest that nanoformulations with particles smaller than 150 nm have higher stability (de Oliveira Carvalho et al. 2021), which can be observed in our study as well. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the formulations are crucial to affect the resulting particles\u2019 average size and size distribution (Apolin\u00e1rio et al. 2020). It is essential noticing the presence of a polymer can lead to decreased particle size compared to emulsion due to its stabilizing effects surrounding the droplets.\nThe components of the formulation can also affect the zeta potential. Zeta potential is a measure of charge at the particles\u2019 surface and is in uenced by interfacial changes, which could occur due to the dissociation of functional groups at the particles\u2019 surface or ion adsorption from the aqueous medium (Honary and Zahir 2013). High Zeta potential values (> 15 mV) are an indicator of good physicochemical stability because the repulsive charges at the droplets\u2019 surface prevent particles\u2019 aggregation (Zieli\u0144ska et al. 2020). The nanoparticles produced in our study had a zeta potential higher than 15 mV, which could explain the stability during the observed period.\nNBO intramuscular injection acute toxicity\nPage 8/20\nDuring four days of observational screening, there were no evident signs of toxicity in all doses of NBO related to the motor system, re exes, or central nervous system disturbances (Table 2). Other parameters commonly observed that could be a sign of toxicity are altered ponderal growth, food and water intake, altered behavior and apathy, and poor hair quality (Cunha et al. 2009; J\u00fanior et al. 2012; Tubesha et al. 2013). Here, these parameters were unaffected as well (Table 3)\u00a0\nTable 2 Results observed from the observational screening four days after the injections.\n\u00a0 Groups\nParameter CON NBO 1 NBO 2.5 NBO 5 NBO 10\nVocal fremitus Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nIrritability Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nTouch response Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nTail touch response Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nContortions Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nBody tonus Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nGrip strength Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nAtaxia Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nAuricular re ex Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nTremors Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nHypnosis/anesthesia Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nLacrimation Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nUrination/defecation Normal Normal Normal Normal Normal\nPiloerection Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nCyanosis/hyperemia Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\nDeath Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent\n\u00a0\nPage 9/20\nTable 3 Food intake, water intake, and weight after four days of the intramuscular injection of NBO.

Even after four days of the administration, we observed that the formulation could still be observed, identi ed by its slightly yellow color (see asterisks in Fig. 4); this suggests that the NBO has a slow absorption rate. At the dose of 10 mg/kg was observed mild muscular edema and hemorrhage.\nUsing the animals\u2019 blood, we assessed biochemical markers of muscle toxicity (Fig.\u00a05). The results show that doses from 1 to 5 mg/kg did not signi cantly affect CPK, LDH, or myoglobin levels. The group treated with NBO at 10 had slightly higher levels of these markers, but the difference was not statistically signi cant. Highly altered levels of these markers are an indicator of muscle damage since these proteins are involved in this tissue maintenance. Intramuscular injection of drugs at high concentrations is expected to increase the amount of these markers in the blood (Ely et al. 2000; de Oliveira Carvalho et al. 2021).\nCPK is a cytoplasmic enzyme highly abundant in skeletal muscle, myocardium, and brain. Studies show that this enzyme has increased concentration proportionally to the degree of muscle damage two hours after the injury. Exceedingly high CPK and LDH can indicate muscle necrosis (Ely et al. 2000; Alves et al. 2019). According to (Moniz et al. 2017), myoglobin should also be evaluated, considering that this marker also is increased during muscle necrosis. Overall, our results show that applying NBO from 1 to 5 mg/kg did not induce any observed changes, while 10 mg/kg could induce slight tissue bleeding.\nAST and ALT are common biochemical markers of hepatotoxicity (Rodrigues et al. 2022). The values obtained are shown in Fig.\u00a06. It is observed that the values were all statistically similar, which indicates a lack of toxicity in the liver.\nNo changes were observed in the erythrogram as well (Table\u00a04); there was a slight but statistically signi cant (p < 0.05) increase in the number of segmented neutrophils in 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, and increased eosinophils in 1 mg/kg. However, considering the lack of dose dependence and the results from others parameters, this does not necessarily mean a sign of toxicity. There is a natural variation among animals\nPage 10/20\naccording to their gender, strain, genotype, among other factors. Also, all the values observed are within the acceptable range of the species (Silva Lima et al. 2017; Villas Boas et al. 2018).\nIn the histopathological analysis, the groups treated with NBO at 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg had a healthy muscle structure. In NBO at 10 was observed necrotic bers and high leukocyte in ltration, ber diameter variation, and increased connective tissue (Fig.\u00a07). According to (Paulsen et al. 2012), tissue changes caused by in ammatory cells in the muscle can affect its function with the occurrence of edema and\nPage 11/20\nincreased protein expression, which will be responsible for the increased values of muscle damage such as CPK (Ribeiro et al. 2006). No in ammatory cells were observed in the muscle of NBO from 1 to 5 mg/kg.\nConclusion The toxicological results of this study show that the acute intramuscular injection of NBO did not induce toxicity signs up to 5 mg/kg and was considered safe. The injection of 10 mg/kg, despite not inducing biochemical (CPK, LDH, myoglobin, AST, ALT) or hematological changes, had histopathological alterations, with in ltered leukocytes, muscle ber morphological variation, and necrosis.\nAbbreviations ALT - Alanine aminotransferase\nAST \u2013 Aspartate aminotransferase\nCPK \u2013 Creatine kinase\nLDH \u2013 Lactate dehydrogenase\nMCH - Mean corpuscular hemoglobin\nMCS - Mean corpuscular size\nNBO - Nanodispersion of B. orellana oil\nOECD - Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\nDeclarations Author contributions HOC: performed experiments and assays, analyzed data, prepared manuscript.
