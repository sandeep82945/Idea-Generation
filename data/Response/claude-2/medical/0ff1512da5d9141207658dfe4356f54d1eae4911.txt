 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study to assess how risk perception and management behaviors change over time, especially after educational interventions. This could provide insight into the long-term impacts of increasing awareness. 

2. Examine potential barriers that prevent increased risk awareness from translating into preventative behaviors. Qualitative research could uncover psychosocial, economic, or cultural factors influencing risk management. 

3. Develop and test educational tools and public health campaigns tailored to the needs of specific demographic groups to increase environmental health literacy and empower preventative behaviors.

4. Conduct a nationwide study across all regions of TÃ¼rkiye to gain a comprehensive understanding of risk perception across different geographic and socioeconomic groups. 

5. Partner with policymakers to translate research findings into evidence-based policies and regulations that promote healthier environments, especially for vulnerable groups like pregnant women and children.
