    "abstractText": "In this work we show the possibility of imparting polarization-sensitive properties to twodimensional films of graphene-like semiconductors, using WSe2 as an example, by the application of ordered silver triangular nanoprisms. In addition, such nanoprisms made it possible to increase the optical sensitivity of optical detectors created on two-dimensional films by a factor of five due to surface plasmon resonance. The peculiarities of the surface plasmon resonance were shown by theoretical modeling, and the optimal conditions of its occurrence were determined. This article demonstrates an effective approach to creating spectrally selective, polarization-sensitive detectors based on two-dimensional graphene-like semiconductors.",

The ability to analyze the optical polarization of the detected light greatly expands the capabilities of numerous applications, such as polarizationencoded quantum key distribution [1], biomedical applications [2], remote optical sensing techniques, object recognition [3], and polarization optical mapping [4]. For use in these applications, detectors must have high quantum efficiency and, at the same time, be compact enough to achieve a high level of integration and flexibility. To date, commercially available devices do not meet these requirements. To achieve polarization sensitivity, additional non-integrable polarizing filters or polarizers are installed directly in front of the optical detector, which significantly increases their size. In addition, flexible integrated devices are better integrated into optical systems, while classical photodetectors, due to their large size, are not suitable for flexible applications. The only possible approach to ensure the above requirements is the transition to new materials. Among such new materials suitable for creating optical sensors, nanomaterials show the greatest promise. Some of them have significant optical anisotropy due to their shape, which allows selective detection of polarization. Such materials include nanowires [5] and carbon nanotubes [6], which are composed into ordered clusters and used as an active, flexible light-sensitive element. However, the creation of such structures is excessively time-consuming, because complex technological techniques are needed for their structuring and ordering. Another approach is to use two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor films. These films, due to their unique quantum-dimensional effects, allow the creation of highly sensitive photodetectors [7] and sensors [8]. 2D semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, were first obtained a relatively short time after the discovery of graphene in 2004. Since then, numerous attempts have been made to create optical detectors based on\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1854. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12111854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1854 2 of 12\nthem. Some of these materials, such as ReSe2, have their own optical anisotropy due to the nature of their crystallographic structure. Thus, a polarization-sensitive photodetector was designed that allowed the detection of two polarization components independently of each other [9]. The only drawback of the above device is a not very high polarization selectivity, which limits the possibility of its application. An alternative to the use of 2D materials that do not have sufficient intrinsic optical anisotropy is to create anisotropy using plasmonic effects. For example, the possibility of using elliptical plasmonic structures to achieve polarization sensitivity through local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was shown [10]. In this case, the 2D material used did not possess optical anisotropy at all, but when using gold structures, it became polarization sensitive. However, in this work, gold structures were used, which reduces the efficiency of such materials. Most importantly, the possibility of only local plasmon resonance near the metal/dielectric structure was taken into account, and not the surface resonance. At the same time, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) theoretically allows the increase of optical absorption up to 100%. Until now the possibility of SPR in such structures had not been investigated. Different theoretical modeling approaches can be used to describe such structures. For example, it is shown in [11] that upgraded local density or generalized gradient approximations to density functional theory can be successfully applied to estimate the optical parameters of nanoscale hybrid metal\u2013silicon materials. Moreover, for example, it was successfully demonstrated in [12] that ab initio molecular dynamics simulation approaches can be used to calculate the parameters of 2D graphitic-like aluminum nitride materials. Finite element modeling is another possible option for evaluating the optical properties of such complex three-dimensional systems, which is most widely used to estimate the effects of plasmonic amplification [13]. In this work, we investigated the possibility of creating highly efficient polarizationsensitive detectors by using SPR. For this purpose, arrays of triangular nanoprisms were created on the surface of the WSe2 monolayer film, which also made it possible to enhance the photosensitivity of the created photodetectors. To study the peculiarities of the surface plasmon resonance emergence, theoretical modeling of optical absorption for the created structures was performed, and the regularities of optical anisotropic absorption were determined."

            "text": "There are many possible variations of the form factors of plasmonic structures designed to enhance the absorption of optical radiation in their adjacent materials by LSPR. To date, the effectiveness of spheres [14], ordered nanodiscs [15], PbS [16] and Ag [17] quantum dots, nanocubes [18], spherical dimers, nanostars, nanorods [14], grid arrays [19], and complexshaped structures [20] has been demonstrated. However, only asymmetric nanostructures can have optical anisotropy, which significantly narrows their list of possible forms. For example, quantum dots, spheres, nanodiscs, or similar symmetric structures cannot be used for this purpose. In such low-dimensional structures there are three main mechanisms that can be involved in increasing the absorption in the semiconductor layer, which is described in great detail in [21]. The first of them is the scattering of optical radiation on plasmonic elements. Usually, this mechanism plays a decisive role when the radiation scattered in this way further passes through the bulk layer of the semiconductor, being absorbed in it. Thus, scattering is required simply to increase the path length of the electromagnetic wave in the semiconductor. However, in this case, this effect makes almost no contribution. This is due to the fact that the plasmonic elements are located above the semiconductor, and most of the scattered radiation escapes into the air medium above. Moreover, the small thickness of the semiconductor, even if the scattered radiation reaches its surface, does not allow it to be effectively absorbed.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1854 3 of 12\nThe second is the local surface plasmon resonance, which manifests itself in the collective oscillation of the electron density near the metal\u2013semiconductor boundary. In the film itself there is a significant increase in the intensity of the electromagnetic wave, which in turn leads to an increase in the photocurrent. This effect is mainly dominant and allows one to obtain an increase in optical absorption using almost any form-factor of plasmonic structures on the surface of the semiconductor as shown in our work. The third mechanism is the surface plasmon resonance, which occurs mainly along long metal films, which also leads to redistribution of the electromagnetic field in the structures adjacent to it. It is worth noting that, in our case, only the latter two mechanisms yield contributions. Therefore, the next factor in selecting the shape of the nanostructures is the effective generation of local surface plasmon resonance. For this purpose, such structures should possess sharp angles, which will enhance the electromagnetic field in their immediate vicinity. On this basis, the most effective form should have multipoint stars such as those mentioned in [14]. However, the characteristic sizes of such structures should be comparable to the length of the incident electromagnetic wave, which leads to technological difficulties in creating such defect-free structures with strictly specified geometric parameters, especially if they have a three-dimensional shape. Moreover, such multi-beam structures, for obvious reasons, begin to lose their anisotropic properties when the number of beams increases. The next important factor is the mutual arrangement of such structures: if they are disordered, such as nanotubes lying on a substrate, then individually they will have optical anisotropy, but in the cumulative arrangement, this will be absent. For this reason, it is necessary to use asymmetric plasmonic structures, the arrangement of which relative to each other must be strictly ordered. The structures must be located as close to each other as possible. This is necessary because total amplification over the entire surface area of the functional material is more important than the amplification value of a single plasmonic structure. The most effective material for the plasmonic element is silver, as it is extremely efficient at generating standing plasmonic waves [22]. So, for example, a comparison of metals used to create plasmonic materials is described in detail in [23]. In this work it is shown that the quality factor for localized surface plasmon resonances (at the 635 nm wavelength) in silver is two times higher than in gold. That is why in our work silver was chosen as a material for plasmonic structures. We also performed theoretical simulations for absorption in a 2D semiconductor film for different compositions of plasmonic structures (see Supplementary Materials S1). Thus, the simulation shows that the absorption in the TMD film is higher by 30% when using Ag rather than Au. It was also found that the choice of material of plasmonic elements does not affect their anisotropic absorption. That is why the ordered plasmonic structures in the form of triangular silver nanoprisms were chosen in this work. Such nanoprisms are optimal candidates for optical amplification, as they fully satisfy all the above parameters. The prisms were arranged relative to each other in the form of a square rectangular matrix. This ordering of elements is usually the most commonly used for such problems. More so, it is optimal when creating detectors sensitive to polarization due to its symmetry. Schematic representation of a photodetector based on such a plasmonic structure is shown in Figure 1. The distance between the elements of the matrix will hereafter be referred to as the period T of the plasmonic structures. The characteristic size of the plasmon element itself was chosen as a circle circumscribed around its triangular base. We considered it important to maintain the ratio of the open area of the TMD surface to the surface occupied by the plasmonic structures. Thus, we exclude the possibility of changing the efficiency of photodetectors only by changing the active area of the light-irradiated semiconductor. Three sets of plasmonic structures that have different periods were created: 200, 300, and 500 nm. A detailed description of the choice of the form factor of plasmonic structures is presented in Supplementary Materials S2. Thus, the optimal thickness of the plasmonic structures was estimated by simulation and the most efficient geometrical parameters were selected.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1854 4 of 12Nanomaterials 20 2, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 12\nFigure 1.

It can be noted that, near the metallic plasmonic structures, there is the greatest increase in the power density of the optical radiation, the distribution of which strongly depends on the polarization parameters. When the incident polarization rotates, the greatest amplification is observed at the corners of the triangle, which are adjacent to the base parallel to the polarization of the incident light.

The results of the\nsimulation (the cross section is conducted in the middle of the semiconductor volume) for\ndifferent incident polarizations of optical radiation in the calculated unit cell with the\nperiod of plasmonic structures T = 500 nm are shown in Figure 5a\u2013g. It can be noted that,\nnear the metallic plasmonic structures, there is the greatest increase in the power density\nof the optical radiation, the distribution of which strongly depends on the polarization\nparameters. When the incident polarization rotates, the greatest amplification is observed\nat the corners of the triangle, which are adjacent to the base parallel to the polarization of\nthe incident light. However, such local amplification occupies a relatively small surface\narea, and therefore it is not its local peak value that is important, but the average value of\namplification over the whole area of the semiconductor.\nCalculated optical radiation amplification distribution in the layer of 2D WSe2 films for plasmonic s ructures at the incident radiation wavelength \u03bb = 635 nm (a\u2013g) for the created photodetectors with period T = 500 nm, (h,i) for photodetectors with doubled spacing between them.\nThe results show that the amplification of optical radiation occurs on the entire surface of the semiconductor, which is located in the calculated unit cell. For example, for the polarization incidence angle \u03d5 = 0\u25e6, the amplification to the left and right of the triangular prism increases fivefold and to the top and bottom is close to unity. As the polarization rotates, such a symmetrical field distribution pattern also begins to rotate following the polarization (Figure 5a\u2013g). Such amplification of optical radiation so far away (more than the wavelength of incident radiation) from the plasmonic structure can be explained by interaction between plasmonic structures, leading to SPR. To verify this assertion, a simulation of optical radiation amplification was performed for a triangular nanoprism of the same size but with twice the distance between them. The results of this simulation are shown in Figure 5h,i. They show that the amplification is located only in a very small region in the immediate vicinity of the plasmonic structures and does not spread farther. This field distribution is characteristic of the LSPR. It was found that, for such modified structures, polarization anisotropy is completely absent (see Supplementary Materials S4), which fully confirms the occurrence of polarization selectivity due to the interaction between the plasmonic structures and not due to their anisotropic shape. Moreover, single triangular prisms, by virtue of their shape, should possess 60-degree symmetry of polarization dependences, which also does not correspond to the\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1854 9 of 12\nobtained results. In addition, it was found that the polarization selectivity of nanoprisms can be altered by rotating the prisms within the ordered matrix in which they are placed (see Supplementary Materials S5). The maximum value of polarization-dependent absorption is observed when one of the sides of the triangle is parallel to the axes of the square matrix in which they are ordered. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to completely get rid of polarization-dependent absorption by rotating the triangular nanoprisms by 15 degrees. Thus, if it is known that the maximum ratio of optical selectivity in such structures is achieved at azimuthal angles of incidence of laser radiation \u03d5 = 0\u25e6 and \u03d5 = 90\u25e6, then it is possible to estimate the maximum possible polarization selectivity for such structures. Thus, Figure 6a,b shows the calculated absorption in the WSe2 monolayer based on this model as a function of wavelength and period of plasmonic nanoprisms for polarization angles \u03d5 = 0\u25e6 and \u03d5 = 90\u25e6, respectively. Figure 6c shows the polarization absorption ratio for this structure, which was obtained by dividing the absorption values at polarization angles \u03d5 = 0\u25e6 and \u03d5 = 90\u25e6 by each other. The results show that by changing the period of the structures, the polarization selectivity can be achieved over the entire visible optical range. Moreover, as can be seen from the presented results, such a change also leads to the appearance of spectral absorption selectivity. Based on the obtained results, the maximum polarization selectivity can be obtained using triangular nanoprisms with T = 600 and an incident wavelength of 675 nm. Theoretically, the accurate selection of parameters of plasmonic structures and pump wavelengths will increase the polarization selectivity at least an additional five times for the created photodetectors.
