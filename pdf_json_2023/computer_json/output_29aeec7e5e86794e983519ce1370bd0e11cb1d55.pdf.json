    "abstractText": "Using wind to disperse microfliers that fall like seeds and leaves can help automate large-scale sensor deployments. Here, we present battery-free microfliers that can change shape in mid-air to vary their dispersal distance. We design origami microfliers using bi-stable leaf-out structures and uncover an important property: a simple change in the shape of these origami structures causes two dramatically different falling behaviors. When unfolded and flat, the microfliers exhibit a tumbling behavior that increases lateral displacement in the wind. When folded inward, their orientation is stabilized, resulting in a downward descent that is less influenced by wind. To electronically transition between these two shapes, we designed a low-power electromagnetic actuator that produces peak forces of up to 200 millinewtons within 25 milliseconds while powered by solar cells. We fabricated a circuit directly on the folded origami structure that includes a programmable microcontroller, Bluetooth radio, solar power harvesting circuit, a pressure sensor to estimate altitude and a temperature sensor. Outdoor evaluations show that our 414 milligram origami microfliers are able to electronically change their shape mid-air, travel up to 98 meters in a light breeze, and wirelessly transmit data via Bluetooth up to 60 meters away, using only power collected from the sun.",

            "text": "Many plants passively disperse biological material in the wind such as seeds and leaves [9, 27, 37]. This ability to disperse in the wind without active propulsion is useful for designing wind-dispersed microfliers [20, 25]. Equipped with sensors, such microfliers could automate the deployment of large-scale wireless sensor networks for environmental monitoring [25]. These designs are much smaller and lighter than drones [14, 19, 50], however they lack onboard actuation and thus do not have in-air control over varying their descent behavior or dispersal distance. In this work, we engineer miniaturized, battery-free, programmable microfliers that can both disperse in the wind and vary their dispersal distance through electronic actuation. The actuation can be triggered either by an onboard sensor or through wireless communication.\nAchieving effective wind dispersal requires minimizing the mass of the microfliers to achieve low terminal velocities for maximum flight time. Introducing actuation and\ncontrol however adds the mass of the actuation mechanism, requires onboard sensing and computation for control, as well as the ability to power these components.\nPrior designs use fixed wing gliders [12] and spinning seed-inspired designs [3, 35] to alter their descent behavior; however, these designs use large, power-consuming motors and servos and required heavy batteries. As a result, they are orders of magnitude larger in size and weight than our sub-gram miniaturized microfliers.\nWe present battery-free microfliers that are able to electronically change their shape in mid-air to alter their falling behavior and vary their dispersal distance (Fig 1). These solar-powered miniaturized devices can be dropped from small commercial drones. They spread outward in the direction of the wind in their tumbling state. Upon reaching a programmable altitude, triggering a timer, or receiving a wireless trigger signal, these devices can use harvested power to transition to a stable state in mid-air, in which they descend with decreased lateral dispersal. Upon landing, the devices continue to harvest energy to\nar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n06 72\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n3 Se\npower onboard environmental sensors and a Bluetooth radio to wirelessly transmit sensor data.\nGiven the limited and intermittent nature of solar harvesting, instead of continuous actuation, our microflier design uses leaf-out origami based on the Miura-ori building block to produce bistable structures [31, 47, 48]. These structures maintain their configuration in either of their two states without any active energy consumption.\nOur work reveals an important property of leaf-out origami: these structures have dramatically different falling behaviors in their two states. Fig 2A,B show comparisons of the flat \u201ctumbling\u201d state in which the structure falls chaotically, and the folded state in which it exhibits a stable descent. A fluid analysis demonstrating the airflow around the microflier in each of its two states is shown in Fig S1. Movies S1,2 demonstrate that a small inward fold can emulate two distinct descending behaviors of two different leaf shapes, shown for comparison. This difference in behavior substantially changes their response to lateral wind gusts (Movie S3), which can be used to vary their wind dispersal distance.\nCreating a solar-powered origami microflier is challenging for three reasons. First, the structure should not transition until actively triggered. As the microflier tumbles, it not only encounters the force of the wind, but also gravity acting on the mass of the payload. This imposes a trade-off between the origami design and the actuator. The structure must be stiff enough to prevent false transitions, but doing so also increases the force the actuator has to deliver, which in turn requires larger components and higher power consumption. Second, transitioning the solar-powered microflier in mid-air imposes the strict requirement that it must be completely untethered from any power source or actuation stimulus, be electronically controllable by the device itself, and produce a rapid response to transition before the device falls to the ground. Although origami systems that use external magnetic fields, shape memory alloys, electrothermal polymers, motors, peizoelectric actuators or electrostatic actuators have been proposed in the literature [5, 15, 18, 28\u201330, 32, 33, 38, 40, 43, 49], none of them meet our size, weight, power, and rapid response requirements. Third, this system must rapidly charge a lightweight energy storage element such as a capacitor up to the voltage required by the actuator, and discharge a pulse of energy sufficient for transitioning. Moreover, many microcontrollers are designed for low voltage operation to minimize power consumption and cannot tolerate the higher voltages that may be required for actuation. This requires creating separate power regulation circuits\nfor both parts of the system and a strategy to dynamically switch between them to multiplex a single lightweight solar array.\nIn this article, we demonstrate that it is possible to address these challenges and build solar-powered origami microfliers that can electronically change their shape in mid-air for wind dispersal of wireless sensors. We make the following key contributions: First, we design origami microfliers and demonstrate that small changes in their shape can dramatically change their falling behavior from chaotic tumbling to a stable descent. Further, we observe that the microfliers are more responsive to lateral wind gusts in their tumbling state achieving as much as 3-fold greater dispersal distance than in their stable state. Second, we combine our origami with a low-power, bistable electromagnetic actuation mechanism compatible with solar power harvesting. This allows our origami microflier to transition between origami states in mid-air, completely untethered. Our onboard actuator produces peak forces of up to 250 mN within 25 ms. This enables the design of robust origami microfliers that can operate without false transition in wind speeds upwards of 5 m/s. Third, we design a solar energy harvesting circuit that can both cold-start from zero charge at sunrise and harvest enough power to transition the structure in mid-air. Additionally, an onboard microcontroller, radio, and pressure sensor enable multiple modes of operation for triggering a transition based on time delays, altitude readings, or wireless commands. After landing, the onboard temperature and pressure sensor wirelessly transmit data to a remote Bluetooth receiver at distances of 60 m. Finally, we perform real-world deployments by dropping our sensors from drones at altitudes of 40 m and demonstrate dispersal up to distances of 98 m in a light breeze. We further show that our 414 mg device can harvest enough energy to transition in mid-air. Additionally, the devices can receive trigger signals via Bluetooth and transmit real-time sensor data as they fall for taking sensor measurements at different altitudes while landing with their solar cells facing up 87% of the time."

            "text": "Bi-stable origami structure. Our objectives were to design miniaturized (sub-gram), wind-dispersed microfliers that have the ability to change their falling behavior to thereby vary their dispersal distance. One method to achieve this is to use active propulsion such as spinning\nrotors that can produce lift; this, however, requires substantial energy and is challenging to achieve using solarharvesting [13]. A lower power alternative would instead be to leverage interactions with the air flowing around the microflier as it falls. In particular, the terminal velocity of a falling object is affected by its projected area and structure dependent drag coefficient [9]. Changing the shape of the falling microflier therefore presents an alternative means of changing its descent behavior.\nTo create a shape change with minimal energy, we used bi-stable origami structures that can alternate between two different folded shapes. Specifically, we leveraged the bio-mimetic Miura folds that occur in leaves [26]. The Miura-ori pattern can be tessellated as a building block for high expansion ratio structures that produce substantial shape changes [26, 41] and achieve bi-stable structures [16, 47]. Additionally, the Miura-ori pattern is a form of rigid origami, meaning the faces of the structure will not\ncontort during folding and deformations only occur along defined crease lines. This provides two key engineering advantages. First, energy is concentrated along the crease lines and not expended, elastically deforming the faces of the structure. This minimizes the energy required to transition the structure from one state to another. Second, the lack of deformation on the faces provides stable areas in which to attach electronic components like solar cells.\nWe designed our origami microfliers by combining multiple Miura-ori unit cells as shown in Fig 3A. An individual unit cell is shown shaded gray and is composed of three distinct types of crease lines: boundary, main, and sub creases. The structure was tessellated by connecting adjacent boundary crease lines to other unit cells, with all the unit cells\u2019 main and boundary crease lines meeting at the origin point \ud835\udc42. Each crease is represented as either a mountain fold (protruding out of the page) or a valley fold (going into the page).\nFollowing the rigid origami model, we assumed all creases act like hinges between rigid and non-bendable panels (faces). Each unit cell is characterized by a central angle (\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60) and main crease line length (\ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc40) parameter. The crease stiffness of our fabricated prototypes was tuned by using different materials, varying material thickness, and by introducing cut patterns along the crease lines to decrease stiffness, shown to the right in Fig 3A. As the leaf-out is folded from one state to the other, its folding stage is characterized by \ud835\udf13, representing the angle between the main crease line and the Z-axis extending through the center of the structure. Intuitively, this angle represents how much the main crease is folded inward.\nTo understand the energy requirements for changing the origami shape, we looked to prior works on leaf-out origami simulations to model the kinematics of the structure in different configurations [47, 48]. It has been shown that we can analyze different configurations of the leafout structure using the rigid origami simulation technique, where we assumed that the crease line folds are represented as torsional springs, each Miura-ori cell exhibits a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) folding motion, and transformations are assumed to be uniform [17, 42, 47, 48]. A uniform transformation has all \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60 with equal \ud835\udf13 values throughout each folding stage, and all mountain and valley\ncrease assignments maintained throughout each folding stage. Using the assumptions stated above, it has been shown that we can estimate the peak energy required to transition the structure by conducting an energy analysis based on the kinematics of the leaf-out structure [47, 48]. Fig 3B shows the energy required to transition the structure between states for a variety of leaf-out configurations with different \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60 . This value represents the sum of the energy required for each fold normalized by their spring constant \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf03 (see Supplementary Materials for details). We assumed this constant is the same across folds as they are made from a uniform material. The normalized energy plots show that as \ud835\udf13 approaches 0\u00b0, the flat state, the energy required to fold the structure to that angle increases rapidly. Beyond this peak, the structure transitions to its other state and the energy rapidly decreases. Movie S4 shows how the structure folds and transitions between states. These results show that increasing the number of unit cells increases the peak energy required to transition, another parameter that can be tuned to match the ideal configuration for a given application. In this work, we optimized the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60 of our leaf-out design to maximize lateral displacement for enabling dispersal in the wind over a wide area. We then tuned the material thickness and crease cut pattern to ensure that the chosen leaf-out configuration\ncan be transitioned given the fixed energy generated from our actuator.\nNext, we evaluated how lightweight origami structures fabricated on thin films fall in each of their states. To\ncharacterize this behavior, we performed empirical measurements due to the complexities of accurately modelling the fluid\u2013structure interactions for thin, deformable, freely falling objects. We used laser micromachining to cut out\neach of the simulated structures from polyimide films (see Methods for details). To tune the energy required to transition, we experimented with altering the film thickness, as well as by varying the cut patterns on the boundary and sub crease lines to vary their stiffness and therefore the force required to transition.\nSpecifically, we evaluated the force required to transition four unit cell origami structures made with different three different polyimide film thicknesses and boundary crease cut patterns. We note that these experiments were performed on the bare folded film. We measured the force by placing the origami folded polyimide sheets onto a precision weight scale (Sartorius QUINTIX125D-1S) and position a screw driven micromanipulator holding a flat carbon fiber plate affixed to a rod above the center of the origami. We slowly moved the carbon fiber rod and plated down to apply pressure to the origami and recorded the reading on the scale at which it transitions. We then converted the measured mass to a force in Newtons and plotted the results in Fig 3C. The legend indicates the percentage of cut length, or the percentage of holes along the crease line. A higher percentage indicates more holes along the crease and therefore lower stiffness. We performed additional characterization of how these values change when the structure has payload such as circuit components on the faces in Fig S2. These experiments showed a range of forces that can be achieved by modulating the material and cut parameters.\nThese results demonstrated the ability to achieve a variety of values to suit potential actuation strategies. During these tests however we observed that off axis forces and airflow caused these thin structures to warp and violate the rigid origami design principle. In order to address this, we again looked to real leaves for inspiration and noted that they have rigid veins that define their structure. We emulated this by creating patterns of carbon fiber and PET as shown in Fig 2C. We attached these carbon fiber root structures to the faces of the origami to create multilayered prototypes (see Methods and Movie S4). We further found that this increases the force required to transition. For example, a 12.5 \u00b5m thick leaf-out structure with 26% holes along the main and sub creases goes from requiring 6.5 mN to transition without the root structure to 34 mN with the root structure.\nWe evaluated the microflier\u2019s resistance to false transitions in high winds by suspending the structure from a thin Kevlar thread above a fan, and exposing the origami face to wind speeds up to 5 m/s. Movie S5 showed that this wind speed was strong enough to break the glue joint\nholding the flier in place, after which it goes into the air and lands on the ground. We note that even after experiencing this force, the structure did not falsely transition, and these results were consistent across 10 experiments averaging 7 s in duration. We further note that by tuning the material thickness and crease cuts we could make the structure even more resilient to false transitions.\nNext, we performed a series of drop tests with our origami microfliers and observed their behavior during free fall. We fabricated an array of origami designs with 3-8 unit cells on 12.5 \u00b5m thick Kapton sheets, and performed drop tests (N=10 trials) for each origami design in its two folded states from a height of 2 m. We recorded videos of their descent, and observed that our designs reach their terminal velocity from this height.\nThese experiments highlighted a key difference in the behavior of the origami in its two states as shown in Movies S1, S2 and S3. When the structure was flat it quickly began tumbling about an axis, whereas in its closed state it exhibited a stable descent. We further observed that the tumbling state was more affected by wind gusts, giving it the potential to travel longer lateral distances during wind dispersal. The results of our drop tests comparing different origami designs in their flat and tumbling state are shown in Fig 3D,E. We observed that the four unit cell design produced a greater number of rotations as it descends. This is correlated with the observation that the four unit cell design achieved greater lateral displacement from the drop location, suggesting that the momentum from this rotation causes it to move further outward from the drop location. Additionally, as shown in Movie S3, flipping contributes to greater lateral displacement in wind gusts. We also performed experiments analyzing falling behavior with payload and different weight distributions shown in Fig S3 and provide additional details in supplementary methods.\nTo understand the cause of this behavior, we performed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements to characterize the flow around and in the wake of the flier, using the setup described in Fig S1A and Supplementary methods (see PIV analysis). In its flat tumbling state, the flier presented sharp edges to the incoming air flow as it falls downward. We observed that the flat, tumbling configuration has a wider, highly asymmetric instantaneous wake, with higher frequency vortex shedding which results in large aerodynamic torque with respect to the flier\u2019s center of mass. Specifically, Fig S1B shows the magnitude of the aerodynamic torque, represented by the location of the center of pressure with respect to the center of the flier is\nsubstantially higher in the flat, tumbling state than in the stable state. The location of the center of pressure moved over a range of 10 mm at characteristic frequencies on the order of 10 Hz causing the flier to tilt and begin tumbling. This represents the main mechanism causing the instability. Once in unstable fall, there was no aerodynamic torque to return the flier to stable fall, perpendicular to its plane. In contrast, the folded stable state presents beveled corners to the flow, resulting in narrower wake, as shown in the time-averaged flow velocity contours in Fig S1C. In this state, the wake vortices formed closer to the center of the flier, resulting in a more symmetric wake and lower aerodynamic torque with respect to its center of mass. Thus, the flier in the folded state is more stable: less prone to tilting its plane from falling perpendicular-to-gravity to aligned-with-gravity. Experimental methods and analysis are discussed extensively in Supplementary Methods (see PIV analysis).\nSolar-powered actuator. Creating an origami microflier that can transition in mid-air between tumbling and stable states requires careful co-design between the origami structure, actuator, and power harvesting circuit which raises multiple design challenges. First, the structure must be robust to false transitions when it encounters the force of the wind and gravity acting on the mass of the payload. This presents a trade-off between the origami design and the actuator. The structure must be stiff enough to prevent false transitions, but doing so also increases the force the actuator has to deliver, which in turn requires larger components and higher power consumption. Second, the actuation mechanism itself must be compatible with the complex geometry of the origami structure and tolerate folding. As shown in Fig 3A and Movie S4, when the origami structure transitions between states, the center point and creases move up and down along the Z-axis whereas the borders of the structure contract inward along the X and Y axes. This makes it challenging to mount a rigid actuator on the structure at a fixed mounting point that is compliant with the origami folds. Third, the actuation mechanism must produce a rapid response to transition the device before falling to the ground. We observed that when dropped from an altitude of 40 m, our microfliers were airborne for approximately 15 s. This means that our actuator must be able to transition much faster than this to achieve our target of programmable transitions at different heights. Fourth, transitioning the structure in mid-air imposes a strict requirement that the microflier must be completely untethered from any power\nsource or actuation stimulus and be electronically controllable by the device. To achieve this in a lightweight form factor we used solar power harvesting; this, however, adds constraints on both the total energy available as well as the maximum voltage and current.\nDespite substantial prior work on programmable matter and robotic origami [36], current systems do not meet these requirements due to the well known scaling challenges of size, weight and power in the microrobotics community [40]. Specifically, designs requiring external magnetic fields or heating need close proximity to the source [29, 32, 33] and cannot operate in midair. Other heat actuated mechanisms like shape memory alloys [15, 18] and electrothermal polymers use large amounts of energy which would require substantially increasing size and mass to accommodate either a large solar array or a heavy battery. Additionally, these actuators have slow response times and can require over a minute to fold [38]. Hygroscopic actuators that cause bending in response to humidity face similar drawbacks of long actuation times and are not electronically controllable [37, 45]. Other designs have used motors combined with thread or gearing mechanisms to achieve folding but again require large and heavy batteries and actuation mechanisms [5, 43]. Piezo actuators are known to be highly efficient at small scale, however require high voltage boost converters to drive them which substantially increases mass and reduces efficiency [24, 30]. Similarly, origami designs driven by electrostatic actuators require even higher voltages of over 1 kV [28]. These challenges are also highlighted by recently developed small folding robots weighing approximately 10 g and cite difficulty scaling down in size due to their use of batteries which occupy roughly half of the robot\u2019s surface area and consumes 40% of its mass [49].\nTo solve these multi-faceted design challenges, we analyzed different actuation modalities to identify candidates that are compatible with solar power harvesting. Each solar cell produces a maximum of 2.8 V in bright sunlight. Although this can be increased by connecting multiple cells in series, achieving hundreds or thousands of volts would require a heavy and inefficient boost converter. Additionally, solar energy varies with factors like clouds and light intensity which requires a capacitor to buffer energy. Small capacitors also cannot tolerate high voltages due to dielectric breakdown, but do have low series resistance and can discharge current quickly. We therefore focused on actuators that require low voltages (< 10V) but higher currents. This suggests electromagnetic actuators or heat\nbased actuation. We eliminate the latter due to their slow response times and high energy requirements.\nThe most common electromagnetic actuators are continuously rotating motors, however we can leverage the properties of origami to simplify our actuation to a single pulse of linear motion. As long as the force on the major creaselines exceeds the energy barrier shown in Fig 3B, it will snap into the other stable state. Thus, we designed a solenoid actuator that can provide the required linear motion. At a high level, the force of a solenoid depends on the strength of the permanent magnet used and the current applied to the coil. The Lorentz force acting on the magnet can be expressed as [6, 7]:\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc67 ( \ud835\udc61 ) = \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 ( \ud835\udc65 ( \ud835\udc61 ) ) \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc59 ( \ud835\udc61 ) \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 (1)\nThe term \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 is the magnetic field experienced by the coil which varies with the position of the magnet \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc59 denotes the current applied to the coil, \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc59 refers to the length of the coil and \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 is the number of windings. This lends itself well to our capacitor based energy storage scheme, as low series resistance capacitors can rapidly discharge high currents to create a motion pulse.\nFig 4A shows a diagram of the actuation mechanism which consists of a solenoid coil (30x3 turns array wound, 2.1 mm coil diameter) and a small 2.0 mm diameter neodymium magnet. We selected the highest grade (N52) to maximize the strength of the permanent magnet. The magnet was constrained to moving up or down within a 2.1 mm diameter tube. The tube was made of an 12.5 \u00b5m thick polyimide film to minimize the distance between the magnet and the coil. Connecting a low series resistance capacitor to the coil results in a short, high amplitude pulse of current which accelerates the magnet upward causing the structure to fold and transition as shown in Fig 4B,C and Movie S6. We note that these diagrams are shown with the tube oriented upward to better illustrate the components, however the microflier rotates in its tumbling state and falls with the tube oriented downward in its stable state.\nWe performed a series of benchmark experiments to characterize the force produced by the actuator itself prior to integration with the origami structure. As shown in Fig S4, a magnet attached to a carbon fiber rod and flat reflector are placed in a polyimide tube with a solenoid coil at the base. The coil and tube are glued to a glass slide to keep them in place. A laser distance sensor (Keyence IA-030) shining down at the reflector and sampling at 1 kHz was used to measure the distance versus time as the magnet accelerated upward. The actuator was connected to the switch and capacitor circuit used on\nthe origami microflier and probed with an oscilloscope (Tektronix MDO34) to measure the capacitor voltage shown in Fig 4D. The second derivative of the distance waveform and the mass of the magnet and carbon fiber rod were used to calculate the force. To achieve maximum force with minimal weight, we evaluated a number of capacitors with different properties and plot the peak force they produce. The same measurements were repeated N=5 times for each of the capacitors shown in Fig 4E. We began by testing a single capacitor, and then proceeded to test two capacitors of the same type in parallel.\nThe peak value of approximately 250 mN was more than six times greater than the force required to transition the structure. The waveforms also show our actuator can be controlled electronically and responds within tens of milliseconds, meeting the requirement for fast motion. Fig 4E further demonstrates the ability to produce sufficiently large pulses of force to transition with only tens of milligrams required for energy storage.\nCoupling this force to the structure however introduces additional challenges as we seek to replicate the bending required for state transition shown in Movie S4. The magnet and coil must be able to push against each other. The structure creases must also be able to bend freely to transition, and as the structure folds inward, the perimeter of the structure shrinks. To address this, we rigidly attached the magnet to the center of the origami structure with a carbon fiber rod, as the center point experiences motion only in the Z direction. We also suspended the tube and coil above it using carbon fiber rods connected to the outer edges of the structure. The rods were rigidly glued to the top of the tube, but are attached to the origami structure with flexible hinges made of 12.5 \u00b5m thick polyimide film as shown in Fig 4A,B. The rigid carbon fiber rods transfer force to the outer edges of the structure, but must also be able to bend at their attachment points to accommodate folding. The magnet produces a force in the Z direction, whereas the rods push the structure inwards in the X and Y directions. At a high level, our design operates similar to an umbrella. Maximizing the force delivered to the structure requires optimizing the initial angle of the rods \ud835\udf03 shown in Fig 4A (see Supplementary Methods and Fig S5).\nIn order to balance the large force required to transition the origami structure with the need for low power, we added an additional magnet as a passive method for reducing the force required by the actuator. By placing an additional permanent magnet in the tube above the coil, as soon as the magnet attached to the origami accelerates upwards, it will experience an attractive force that will\nhelp pull it upwards. Additionally, once transitioned, the origami will remain in this state.\nWe measured the attractive forces between our two 2.0 mm diameter N52 magnets empirically. To do this, we placed a polyimide tube on an approximately 3 cm tall plastic object to create a raised platform on a precision weight scale (Sartorius QUINTIX125D-1S) to make sure the magnets have no interaction with the scale and that metal components in the scale do not affect our measurement. We confirm magnetic effects to not affect the scale readings at this distance. We then placed our cylindrical magnet (Magnet A, 1 mm diameter, 2 mm height, grade N52) on the plastic surface and place the tube around it. We then glued another one of the same size magnets (Magnet B) to the end of a carbon fiber rod and lower it through the top of the tube using a micromanipulator. We recorded the decrease in mass of Magnet A to determine the attractive force caused by lowering Magnet B, shown in Fig 4F. As expected, the attractive force increases nonlinearly as the magnets approach each other. This allowed us to achieve a robust transition with less energy input to the coil. These results demonstrate a fully functional actuator compatible with solar-power harvesting that meets all of our design requirements.\nSolar harvesting and wireless circuit. Programmably triggering our origami microflier to transition in mid-air requires an electronic circuit with multiple components for sensing, control, and power regulation. At the core of the circuit is a programmable microcontroller with an onboard Bluetooth radio (nRF52832, Nordic Semiconductor) which reads data from a temperature and pressure sensor (BMP384, Bosch) and can send a control command to the actuator to trigger it. We fabricated the entire circuit directly on a flexible sheet of copper coated 12.5 \u00b5m polyimide as shown in Fig 5A. This allows for integrating the electronics directly with the origami structure (see Methods). Additionally, this method enables scalable production of origami structures with integrated electronics using industry standard circuit fabrication techniques.\nRunning this device with solar power however requires addressing multiple challenges. To transition in mid-air, the solar cells must rapidly charge a lightweight energy storage element such as a capacitor to above 5 V for the actuator to generate a large enough force to transition our fully assembled origami microflier, as shown in Fig 4D. However our microcontroller can only tolerate a maximum of 3.6 V which introduces the need for dual power regulation circuits to multiplex a single solar cell\narray and the ability to send control commands to these components (see Supplementary Methods for embedded software details). Additionally, to operate for extended periods of time after deployment, these devices need to be able to cold-start without any stored energy due to the lack of an onboard battery. This is challenging as many microcontrollers have short, high current power spikes when turning on. This is often due to initialization procedures such as waiting for their clock oscillators to stabilize before they can run code to go into their low power modes.\nTo address these challenges, we designed the lightweight circuit shown in Figs 5A,B. Power was provided to the circuit by a lightweight solar cell array. To achieve the voltage required by our actuator, we used a minimum of two solar cells (5x5 mm, Microlink Devices) connected in series. For more robust operation in low light environments,\nwe connected an additional two cell array in parallel. The output of the solar cell was connected to a diode to prevent reverse current flow and then into a single pole dual throw switch. We used this switch to multiplex our solar cells between powering the microcontroller and charging the capacitors for the actuator. This strategy allowed us to rapidly charge up for transitioning using all available power and then use the power for sensing and data transmission after deployment with a single lightweight component. The switch control signal used a pull-up resistor to keep it in the default state of charging the microcontroller for startup.\nIn order to sustain the microcontroller while charging the actuator, our microcontroller needed an energy storage capacitor Cstore. We selected a small 7.5 mF supercapacitor which can sustain the microcontroller while transmitting\nBluetooth packets at a rate of 1 packet per second for up to 1 minute, even with no input power. However, this component could only tolerate a maximum of 2.6 V. We placed a voltage regulator which acts as a limiter to prevent damage. We also used a modified version of the lightweight startup circuit presented in our prior work [20] to enable robust cold-start. Briefly, the circuit used a voltage divider from the input to trigger the enable pin of a second 1.9V regulator when Cstore is fully charged. Upon startup, an additional high impedance feedback path kept the system on. We also note that to achieve robust startup we place an additional 100 uF tantalum capacitor in parallel with the larger 7.5 mF capacitor to help buffer the initial transient power spike.\nFig 5C illustrates the full operation of the power harvesting circuit from cold-start to actuation. When first exposed to light with zero charge at t0, the microcontroller storage capacitor Cstore begins to charge. Upon reaching 2.5 V, the voltage regulator limits the value of Cstore whereas the solar array increases to its maximum voltage over 5 V. Simultaneously, the startup circuit with the 1.9 V regulator detects that Cstore is fully charged and turns on to power the microcontroller. The time required to turn on the microcontoller, tcold start, was determined by the light intensity.\nWe evaluated the time required to charge each of the capacitors in our circuit outdoors. We placed the fully assembled origami microflier on its side with its solar cells facing up towards the sun. We connected wires between the solar cell outputs and power input to measure current with a multimeter (Fluke 289), and use 43 AWG wires connected to different points on the circuit to measure the waveforms shown in Fig 5C using an oscilloscope (Tektronix MDO34). We placed a solar power meter (TES 132) next to the solar cells at the same angle to measure the incident solar power. We extracted the startup and charging times from the oscilloscope waveforms to generate the plots in Fig 5D, which shows the microcontroller startup time across a variety of light conditions with 2 and 4 solar cells.\nThe microcontroller then begins running code and can sample its sensor readings, run an onboard timer, or wait for a radio signal to determine when to transition. Fig 5C shows the circuit operating with a fixed delay after which it sets the Vswitch signal high and begins charging Ccoil. The time required to fully charge Ccoil also varies with light intensity. We performed measurements outdoors as explained above and plot the results in Fig 5E with 2 and 4 solar cells. This latency between charging and transition\nintroduces a dependency between the available sunlight and the minimum height from which the sensors can be dropped. The circuit then waits for Ccoil to charge which can either be implemented with a programmed delay, or using an interrupt from the supervisory circuit which detects when Ccoil has reached maximum charge. Next, the circuit sets Vtrig to high which enables the actuator and transitions the structure.\nMovie S7 shows the resulting end-to-end operation of the microflier transitioning completely untethered using solar power. Additionally, Movie S8 demonstrates the same end-to-end operation transitioning in mid-air when dropped outdoors from a ladder at a height of approximately 4 m. The origami microflier begins falling in its tumbling state, and then transitions in mid-air to it\u2019s stable state and changes its descent behavior.\nAfter deployment, the microcontroller continues sampling its sensors. As shown in Fig 5D, the circuit can cold start from zero charge even in low light conditions. To understand how often our device can transmit data, we performed additional outdoor measurements to determine throughput. Due to the complexity of reprogramming the miniaturized circuit during different sun conditions, we measured the power required for Bluetooth first and then measured the power provided by the solar cells. To measure the achievable Bluetooth throughput versus light level we programmed the microcontroller to transmit packets at different rates. We tested the maximum and minimum delays between packets allowed by the chip in its advertising mode. We powered the circuit with a source meter (Keithley 2470) and recorded the average current for a duration of two minutes. We note that shortly after startup, the circuit drew more power, but then settled to a steady state after approximately 1 min. Minimal change is seen after 2 min.\nTo determine the light level required to achieve each transmission rate, we performed the same measurement described above using a multimeter connected between the solar cells and the circuit input during the startup phase. We plot the results in Fig S6 and use linear regression to generate a mapping between light level and currents. The plot shows a highly linear mapping for both two and four cells with \ud835\udc452 > 0.98. We used this data to generate Fig 5F. The results show that in brighter conditions, the circuit harvests enough power to transmit data at the maximum possible rate allowed by the Bluetooth radio chip, sending a packet every 20 ms.\nWe also evaluated the distance at which we can decode Bluetooth transmissions in outdoor environments.\nWe evaluated Bluetooth range in an open field by placing the origami microflier on the ground in the grass, and placing a receiver at increasing distances. We utilized the microflier\u2019s onboard antenna, a chip antenna (Johanson 2450AT14A0100) with an 8 mm length of 41 AWG wire attached to the end to improve performance [21\u201323] as the transmitter. For the receiver, we connected an nRF52832 development board to an 8 dBi patch antenna (L-Com, RE09P-SM) at a height of 2 m. For each trial we transmitted N=1000 packets with sequence numbers from the origami microflier and count the number of packets correctly decoded at the receiver to determine packet delivery rate in Fig 5G. Despite its small antenna, we observed a robust link with low packet error rates up to 60-70 m. This demonstrates the potential for a drone to fly over and collect data from the devices at a high altitude using a Bluetooth receiver.\nOutdoor field evaluation. In addition to characterizing the components of our solar-powered origami microfliers we performed outdoor field experiments to evaluate their real-world behavior. First, we verified that the difference in falling behavior shown in Movies S1, S2, and S3 also occurs outdoors. To evaluate this, we constructed a mechanism to drop our microfliers from a drone (DJI Mavic Mini, Fig S7). The origami microflier is place in a compartment below the drone and a remotely triggered servo opens the compartment. As shown in Movie S9, our origami microflier is dropped from the drone at a height of 20 m. The video shows it begin falling in its tumbling state and then transition in midair to change its falling behavior to stable descent. At the beginning of its fall the flier passes through a region affected by drone induced airflow [39, 44, 46]. We observed in Movie S9 that this appears to have minimal effect with the flier falling straight downward, potentially with some downward acceleration due to downwash. We note that other drone configurations that induce more turbulent flow in this region could even help scatter the fliers laterally.\nWe repeated these experiments in a range of altitudes and wind conditions as shown in Movie S10 to evaluate dispersal distance. We used a hot wire anemometer sampling at a rate of 1 Hz (405i, Testo) to measure the lateral wind speed during these trials. We placed the anemometer at a fixed height of 2 m oriented in the direction that the microflier traveled due to the challenges of measuring ambient wind speed at varying altitudes and trajectories in the field. We also measured the distance from the drop location to the microflier\u2019s landing site. We combined these\n.\ndata to investigate the effect of lateral wind and dispersal distance seen in controlled experiments in Movie S3.\nFig 6A shows a comparison of the distances traveled in tumbling and stable states versus wind speed when dropped from a height of 20 m in an open field. The data shows a division between the two states, especially at higher wind speeds, confirming that the observations in Movie S3 hold outdoors in higher altitudes as well. This is intuitively because the rotation of the sensor in the tumbling state helps maximize the area exposed to lateral wind gusts.\nWe also performed a series of experiments transitioning the origami microfliers in mid-air. To change the shape at different altitudes, we programmed our microfliers to transition a fixed time delay after receiving a trigger command sent over Bluetooth. The origami microfliers were also programmed to continuously broadcast Bluetooth packets with values of their onboard counter as well as temperature and pressure readings. In our implementation, we could use the pressure sensor, a timer, or a Bluetooth command to trigger the transition. We used the same drone and wind measurement setup described above and performed drop experiments in an open park space from an altitude of 40 m. Trials were performed sequentially to facilitate recording data.\nFig 6B shows the distance traveled versus wind speed and Fig 6C shows the same data represented as a map of microflier landing locations. Additionally, the colorbar indicates the amount of time spent in the tumbling state versus the stable state. For example, 100% would indicate the sensor was constantly tumbling and was not programmed to transition whereas 0% would indicate it was programmed to immediately transition and fell only in the stable state. Values in between 0% and 100% indicate a mid-air transition. We observed that similar to Fig 6A, the longer the sensor spent in the tumbling state, the farther it traveled. Further, across microfliers that spent a similar amount of time in their tumbling state, those that experienced higher wind speeds traveled longer distances. We note that although the wind varied across our individual experiments, when dropping multiple devices programmed to transition at different times or altitudes they will experience the same conditions and travel different relative distances. These plots demonstrate that the transitioning mechanism works in real world environments and can achieve our goal of varied dispersal distances.\nDue to their low mass and terminal velocity, our origami microfliers were not damaged by physical impact with the ground. Our design however requires that they land\nwith their solar cells facing upward. To evaluate this, we performed a series of experiments dropping our origami microfliers onto a grass surface from a height of 2 m. We observed that in the tumbling state, the microfliers land upright only 52% of the time (N=50). However, in their stable state they land upright 87% of the time (N=50). In the stable state we observed that an even greater number (96%) initially landed upright but either bounced or collided with an object causing them to flip. This shows that by transitioning to the stable state before landing we can increase the probability of our devices landing upright to harvest power.\nFig 7A illustrates the trajectory of an origami microflier transitioning in mid-air when dropped from 15 m. Although this 2D image makes it difficult to visualize the difference in lateral distance traveled along the Y-axis, the trajectory shows the device tumbling until it transitions and stabilizes in mid-air. Figs 7B,C also show data recorded from Bluetooth transmissions in real time during a drop from 50 m. Fig 7B shows the in-air sensor data as raw pressure measurements converted to altitude. The plot shows the altitude increasing as the drone lifts off and ascends to its target height of 50 m. Upon release, the microflier begins to fall to the ground and shows a corresponding decrease in altitude. Fig 7C shows the temperature data from the microflier as it falls from the drone, again demonstrating the ability for the solar array to power our microfliers in mid-air and the potential for taking atmospheric measurements at different altitudes.\nWe also evaluated performance of the microflier on the ground post-deployment to verify the circuits can coldstart and operate on solar power for extended periods of time. The data was collected by a computer receiving the Bluetooth measurements. Fig 7D,E show the results over the course of three days, during which the sensor turns off at sunset and successfully cold-starts shortly after sunrise. During this time it was able to send 24,000 Bluetooth packets and operate continuously for 6 hours per day. We note that the operational time was limited by the number of sunlight hours at the deployment location in Seattle, WA in December. We performed additional measurements to evaluate sensor performance in comparison to a reference device (see Supplementary Methods and Fig S8)."

            "text": "Here, we designed solar-powered origami microfliers that can change their shape in mid-air to vary their dispersal distance. Our key observation is that leaf-out origami structures exhibit distinct falling modes in their two states:\na tumbling behavior conducive to wind dispersal and a stable descent state less affected by wind. We co-designed a light-weight, low-power actuator and solar power harvesting circuit that enables the microflier to change its\nshape in mid-air using solar power harvested outdoors. Our design uses a programmable microcontroller that makes it extensible to adding other sensors for a wider range of environmental monitoring applications.\nAdding more payload, however, requires additional consideration to maintain a robust difference in falling behavior between the two origami states. We find that the device is sensitive to weight distribution and that adding too much weight on one unit cell can cause asymmetry and thus, flipping in both states (see Supplementary Methods). This can be addressed by adding balancing masses to ensure that weight is uniformly distributed across all cells. Further, the corners of our origami structures are not reinforced with carbon fiber and are flexible which could also affect stability with larger payload.\nOur origami microfliers support bi-directional radio connectivity via Bluetooth. This allows them to not only communicate with a base station, but potentially communicate amongst each other and form peer-to-peer or mesh networks. This presents multiple opportunities to both increase operational range through multi-hop communication, while also presenting routing and scheduling challenges due to variability in solar power on terrains with complex geographic features [11]. We also observe that in brighter conditions, our actuator charges fast enough to be triggered repeatedly. Modifying the design for bidirectional transitions between the states could enable more precise control over falling behavior and even motion such as jumps after falling to the ground. Further, our actuator, circuit, and fabrication methodology to pattern electronics directly onto the folding structure can be applied broadly to the field of origami robots enabling a range of miniaturized battery-free designs.\nFinally, although our microfliers can enable field deployments of environmental sensors, we must also consider their environmental effects at their end of life and their potential to create waste. One solution is to recollect the devices after deployment. The magnets in our actuators present a means for automated collection by sweeping a magnet over the deployment area. We evaluate this using a magnetic sweeping device used to collect nails and other metallic objects on construction sites as well as a small neodymium bar magnet. As shown in Fig S9A-C, even these relatively small magnets can collect our microfliers from distances of 5 cm, and adding an extra onboard magnet extends this to 6 cm. These experiments demonstrate the potential for automated collection for example by pulling an electromagnet behind a tractor in agricultural deployments. Our onboard radio could also be used for localization and presents opportunities to use recent advances in the sensor networking communities [2, 34]. An alternative method that is more attractive for remote\nand difficult terrain would be to incorporate biodegradable materials in the design of our microfliers [1]. Our design already eliminates batteries, and we can build on this to use biodegradeable materials such as cellulose for the structural components [45]. We hope that future advances in sustainable materials paired with innovation in micro-robotic systems could enable this vision."

            "text": "Origami circuit fabrication. We fabricate our origami structures by folding sheets of polyimide films (Dupont Kapton and DuPont Pyralux AC121200E) with the pattern in Fig 3A. We choose the number of unit cells and use a custom python script to generate a tessellation of unit cells with the appropriate angle \ud835\udefc. Next, we choose a film thickness and cut pattern. We tune the structure\u2019s initial folding angle by using a small number of holes along the boundary creases and adding more cuts along the main and sub creases. The stiffer boundary crease dictates the initial folding angle and energy barrier between states. Combined, these factors determine the energy required for transition.\nWe use laser micromachining (LPKF U4) to cut out the shape of the origami and make the crease cuts. We choose four unit cells for our microfliers using data in Fig 3D,E and Fig S10 which indicate this design has the highest lateral displacement which is correlated to the greatest number of rotations during its descent, and the lowest terminal velocity. Additionally this design is symmetric which simplifies weight distribution and fabrication. We choose a side length of 39 mm based on experiments showing smaller prototypes did not exhibit different descent behaviors. This size achieves our sub-gram target mass and provides sufficient area for the electronics.\nWe further demonstrate direct patterning of functional circuits onto the foldable origami to create our final microfliers shown in Fig 2. We use a copper coated film (12 \u00b5m copper, 12 \u00b5m polyimide, DuPont Pyralux AC121200E). We first cover the copper surface in an ink mask. Next, we use the laser to raster away the mask in regions around the desired pads and traces leaving the copper exposed. We then make the crease and boundary cuts. We etch the exposed copper using Ferric chloride and remove the remaining ink using acetone or isopropanol to create the final circuit. Components are then manually placed under a microscope and soldered using a hot plate at 285 \u00b0C. This creates a fully functional circuit on a flat, flexible sheet. This process is similar to commercial flexible circuitboard fabrication which can be used to scale up production.\nTo maintain rigid origami, we attach a carbon fiber root structure as shown in Fig 2C to reinforce the faces. We first create 110 \u00b5m thick carbon fiber layups (0\u00b0,45\u00b0,\u221245\u00b0,0\u00b0, Toray M46J) by laminating the layers together in a heat press (80 psi at 150\u00b0C for 90 minutes). We use the same laser micromachining procedure to cut out eight sections in the desired patterns matching the origami faces. We choose the root pattern to add rigidity with minimal mass. We attach the subsections of the root structure together by placing them on a piece of 50 \u00b5m thick PET tape (Gizmo Dorks) to create a flexible hinge. The PET tape is patterned with cuts allowing it to bend more easily and act like a hinge at the fold of the structure. This allows for the root structures to fold at angle \ud835\udf13. We attach the root structure to the leaf-out circuit in its flat state using cyanoacrylate (CA) glue. We then apply the origami folds shown in Fig 3A to create the folded origami circuit as shown in Fig 5A. The solar cells are placed on pieces of kapton tape and attached to the opposite side of the structure. The solar cells (2-4x 5x5 mm cells, Microlink Devices) are manually wired together and soldered to the remainder of the circuit using 43 AWG wire. Actuator fabrication. After creating the origami structure and circuit, we fabricate our miniaturized electromagnetic actuator and attach it to the structure. We roll a sheet of polyimide film (12.5 \u00b5m, Dupont Kapton) into a tube (2.1 mm diameter, 10.5 mm length) to restrict the motion of the magnet. This tube is designed to match the inner diameter of our solenoid coils (2.1mm diameter, 2.1mm height, 30x3 turns array wound, Golden Eagle Coil & Plastic Ltd). We insert the tube into the coil and use CA glue to attach it at one end of the tube. We then attach a small neodymium magnet (1.0mm diameter, 2.0mm height, grade N52) to a carbon fiber rod (0.25mm diameter, 8.0mm length) and glue it to the center of the root structure to avoid interference with the creases of the hinge. We then glue a second magnet-rod component inside the tube such that it is suspended approximately 8.0 mm above the other magnet when the structure is in its flat, tumbling state. These measurements are empirically determined from Fig 4F, and can be adjusted depending on the strength of the attractive force between the two magnets and the required transition force.

            "text": "Movie S1: Origami microflier behavior in wind tunnel. Our bi-stable origami microfliers exhibit different falling behaviors in their two states over. In the flatter \u201ctumbling state\", they rotate and flip as they fall. In the \u201cstable state\" folded inwards, they exhibit a stable straight downward descent. We compare these behaviors over a vertical wind tunnel first with the base origami structure, followed by our complete microflier with its onboard circuit and actuator.\nMovie S2: Origami microflier compared to falling leaves. Our origami microfliers are shown in free fall in their two states compared to leaves with similar behaviors.\nMovie S3: Origami microflier in lateral wind. Our origami microflier experiences greater displacement due to lateral wind gusts in its tumbling state than in its stable state. The video shows a fan blowing air to the right as the microflier is dropped in each of its states. In its stable state, the microflier moves to the right substantially when it encounters the wind whereas in its stable state the wind has minimal effect.\nMovie S4: Origami microflier manual transition. The video shows a diagram of our microflier\u2019s origami structure and manual folding to demonstrate how it transitions between its two stable states.\nMovie S5: Origami microflier false transition tests. We tested the robustness of our microflier\u2019s bi-stability by hanging one of our prototypes from a thin Kevlar thread vertically above a fan. We recorded videos of the microflier in two different wind speeds, and tracked the fan\u2019s wind speed from an anemometer that actively output the wind speed data to a phone that is visible in the video. The video shows that the microflier does not transition even at wind speeds of 5 m/s. We observe the same result for\nN=10 trials averaging 7 s in duration.\nMovie S6: Electronically actuated origami transition. The video shows a tethered demonstration of how our light-weight, low-power solenoid actuator can produce the required force and bending motion to transition the origami structure from its tumbling state to its stable state. Our actuator produces substantial force causing the structure to briefly lift off the table.\nMovie S7: Untethered solar-powered transition. Demonstration of a fully assembled and untethered origami microflier transitioning between states using harvested solar power. The onboard, battery-free circuit is able to harvest sufficient solar energy to start itself up and begin listening for Bluetooth signals. Upon receiving a packet with the command to transition, it triggers the actuator. The onboard microcontroller can be programmed to transition from a remote signal, onboard timer, or pressure sensor at a particular altitude.\nMovie S8: Mid-air solar-powered transition from low altitude. Origami microflier transitioning in mid-air using harvested solar power when dropped from a ladder at a height of approximately 4 m. The video begins by showing the full trajectory and then proceeds to show a zoomed in, slow motion view pausing to highlight the transition point. We note this version of the microflier is an early prototype with thin wires for debugging and testing visible in the video.\nMovie S9: Mid-air solar-powered transition from drone deployment. Origami microflier transitioning in mid-air using harvested solar power after being dropped from a drone at an altitude of 20 m. The origami microflier starts falling in its tumbling state before transitioning mid-air to the stable state. The video shows the full descent trajectory, then proceeds to show a zoomed in and slow motion view to highlight the transition point.\nMovie S10: Evaluating dispersal distance. We evaluate wind dispersal distance by dropping our origami microfliers from drones at multiple altitudes and in various wind conditions. Recording a drone deployment video from 40 m in higher wind speeds requires running after the microflier as it travels 86 m, resulting in shaking of the camera and difficulty keeping the microflier in the frame."
