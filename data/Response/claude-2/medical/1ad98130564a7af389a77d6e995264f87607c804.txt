 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate different architectures for the CNN component of the hybrid model. The paper uses a U-Net inspired architecture, but other architectures like DenseNets or Transformers could be explored. This may improve feature learning and segmentation performance.

2. Explore additional handcrafted features to integrate into the hybrid model, such as Gabor filters, local binary patterns, or morphological features. Combining more diverse handcrafted features could further improve the model.

3. Evaluate the hybrid approach on larger, more diverse datasets. The paper uses the BraTS dataset, but testing on additional datasets could demonstrate broader applicability and generalization ability.

4. Develop optimal strategies for fusing handcrafted and CNN features. The paper proposes input, feature map, and decision level fusion, but more advanced fusion techniques like attention mechanisms could be researched.

5. Apply the hybrid approach to related tasks like tumor detection, classification, and grading. The segmentation approach could be extended for comprehensive tumor analysis and diagnosis applications.
