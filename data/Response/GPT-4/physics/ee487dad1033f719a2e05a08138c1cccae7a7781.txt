Exploring the Mechanism of Dissociation for E-4031 Analogues: Given the observed differences in dissociation between E-4031 and its analogue E-4031-17 during repeated depolarization protocols, a future study could focus on the detailed mechanism of dissociation for E-4031 analogues. This could include exploring how modifications to the chemical structure affect the drug's ability to dissociate from the hERG channel, potentially leading to analogues with improved safety profiles due to reduced risk of drug accumulation and toxicity.

Investigation of Alternative Polar Substituents on hERG Inhibition: Since the removal of the methanesulphonate group in E-4031-17 did not adversely affect its hERG-blocking capability, further research could explore the effects of alternative polar substituents on hERG channel inhibition. This could help in designing new compounds with high potency for hERG inhibition but with reduced side effects, enhancing the safety of future cardiac and non-cardiac drugs.

Use-/Rate-Dependence of hERG Block by Novel E-4031 Analogues: The study suggests that E-4031-17 might exhibit altered use-/rate-dependence of action compared to E-4031. Future research could systematically investigate this aspect by comparing a series of E-4031 analogues. Understanding the use- and rate-dependence of hERG block can provide insights into how these drugs might behave under different heart rates, which is crucial for developing safer antiarrhythmic medications.

Impact of High [K+]e on hERG Inhibition by Different Drugs: Given that high external potassium concentration ([K+]e) affects the inhibition of inward hERG currents, future studies could investigate how various drugs interact with hERG channels under varying [K+]e conditions. This research could uncover new insights into the electrostatic and structural determinants of drug-channel interactions, potentially leading to the development of drugs with specificity for outward hERG currents, which might have fewer side effects.

Structural Studies on hERG Channel and Drug Interaction: The study hints at complex interactions between drugs and hERG channel residues, including aromatic residues in the S5 and S6 domains. Advanced structural studies, such as cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography, combined with computational modeling, could provide detailed insights into the binding sites and mechanisms of inhibition. This could lead to the rational design of new hERG inhibitors with optimized binding affinities and specificities, contributing to the development of safer therapeutic agents.
