            "text": "In recent years, the international social context has become increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous (VUCA) which has led to the current employment environment becoming unpredictable and variability (Noda, 2020). Due to the uncertainty and dynamic changes of the current employment environment, individual career paths are no longer linear or predictable, and career researchers have recognized this trend and emphasized the importance of actual individual behaviors in career development (Kim et al., 2018). And occupational engagement is an essential behavior that leads to successful and satisfying career development for college students (Cox et al., 2015). Occupational engagement refers to an individual\u2019s efforts to research and engage in career-related activities and is a habitual behavior rather than a specific behavior to make career decisions (Krieshok et al., 2009). It emphasizes the importance of individuals engaging in relevant occupational activities and reflecting on these experiences, and that individuals learn and develop new occupational skills through occupational engagement, as an experiential learning process. Park and Yoo (2020) found that college students with higher levels of occupational engagement tended to have higher levels of career adaptability in an uncertain employment environment. And college students increase their career skills and knowledge reserves in the process of occupational engagement, which helps them to cope with the difficulties they encounter in their career development (Kim et al., 2021). Therefore, how to improve the occupational engagement of college students has become an urgent issue to be solved in the current uncertain social context.\nPersonal growth initiative and occupational engagement\nPersonal growth initiative is an individual\u2019s tendency to actively and consciously refine the skills needed in the growth process (Robitschek, 1998). Self-determination theory\nemphasizes that an autonomous motivational orientation is often associated with higher levels of mental health and high performance in individuals (Deci and Ryan, 2008; Deci et al., 2017). Personal growth initiative emphasizes the dynamic process of individual self-directed change, and research has found that employees with higher levels of personal growth initiative show greater perseverance in finding opportunities for self-growth (Yakunina et al., 2013). Career construction theory (Savickas, 2002, 2013) suggests that individuals continually adjust and adapt to career development based on acquired experiences, which is a dynamic developmental process. Sharma and Rani (2013) found that college students with high personal growth initiative are open to challenges in their career development and always strive for excellence. Personal growth initiative can enable behavioral changes in an individual\u2019s career development and help individuals sustain their occupational engagement, therefore, personal growth initiative can be considered as a launching point for college students to make occupational engagement (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Deci and Ryan, 2008). And Vuyk et al. (2020) conducted a crosscultural analysis and found that personal growth initiative was moderately positively correlated with occupational engagement, and the relation between personal growth initiative and occupational engagement was stronger among Chinese college students compared to Paraguayan college students. It indicates that in the Chinese context, personal growth initiative is an important factor influencing occupational engagement. Furthermore, upon entering the workplace, individuals with high personal growth initiative are immersed in their work longer, are more engaged, and are focused on their responsibilities, because they connect work to emotions and proactively seek and take advantage of development opportunities as they explore their careers (Srivastava and Bajpai, 2021). This study, based on career construct theory, argues that college students\u2019 personal growth initiative will promote occupational engagement, which may have long-term benefits for individual career development.\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nThe mediating role of vocational identity\nVocational identity refers to an individual\u2019s clear and stable picture of his or her goals, interests and talents (Holland et al., 1980; Zhang et al., 2018). Role identity theory suggests that individuals derive their sense of self and meaning from the different social roles they play in society (e.g., friend, partner, student, or manager) and emphasizes that an individual\u2019s selfview shapes his or her identity in a particular social role (Stryker and Burke, 2000). Vocational identity is the selfperception that individuals hold of their abilities to match the requirements of the job, and personal growth initiative happens to be a positive perspective, which has been found to be closely related to vocational identity, as positive self-perceptions lead to the development of a stronger identity associated with the role (Robitschek and Cook, 1999; Deng et al., 2018; Jian and Chen, 2021). Thus, personal growth initiatives may help to promote the development of individual vocational identity. Role identity theory also emphasizes that individuals will develop self-concept apprehension and form an identity with their roles according to the different requirements of the roles they play in society, which will guide their behaviors (Farmer et al., 2003); therefore, when individuals have a strong sense of vocational identity, it will facilitate the achievement of selfdirected and value-driven career goals in career development and help to increase individuals\u2019 occupational engagement (Hall and Cheston, 2002; Vuyk et al., 2020). It has been found that vocational identity is an important indirect factor influencing individual career development, and research has shown that vocational identity mediates the relationship between perceived overqualification and career planning, i.e., individuals who perceive overqualification tend to develop higher levels of vocational identity and engage in more explicit career planning (Ma et al., 2020).\nThe moderating effects of the big five personality traits\nPersonality is a system of interconnected, interdependent traits that together drive behavior (Dai et al., 2004). Goldberg (1990) proposed the \u201cBig Five\u201d or Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality on the basis of a large number of previous studies, and five factors included Neuroticism(N), Extraversion(E), Openness(O), Agreeableness(A), Conscientiousness(C). After a lot of research, the \u201cbig five\u201d model has been accepted by many personality psychologists. Personality traits can have an impact on an individual\u2019s career development, trait activation theory suggests that personality traits are individual responses to traitrelated contextual cues (Tett and Guterman, 2000), and that individual personality traits are associated with the knowledge, skills, and abilities they possess, and that individual personality\ntraits influence the acquisition of knowledge, the development of skills, and the enhancement of abilities, and further influences individual behavior (Liu et al., 2020). Studies have found that individuals with higher levels of openness are more open to new experiences and positively influence their own occupational engagement, while individuals with higher levels of neuroticism negatively influence their own occupational engagement (Janssens et al., 2019; Srivastava and Bajpai, 2021). It has been suggested that personality traits are also highly associated with career adaptability, which is closely related to future career development, and that different personality traits have different effects on career adaptability. Specifically, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extroversion personality traits positively influence youth\u2019s career adaptability, while neuroticism negatively influences youth\u2019s career adaptability (Bacanli and Sars\u0131kog\u0306lu, 2021). Vocational identity involves an individual\u2019s self-perception and self-awareness and, therefore, may interact with an individual\u2019s personality traits to influence his or her occupational engagement."

            "text": "This study examined the relationship between personal growth initiative and occupational engagement of college students in the VUCA environment using a longitudinal design. By constructing a cross-lagged model, we found that personal growth initiative significantly and positively predicted occupational engagement. Based on this, a moderated mediation model was further constructed to verify that vocational identity mediated the relationship between personal growth initiative and occupational engagement, and that neuroticism personality traits moderated the relationship between vocational identity and occupational engagement, i.e., individuals with higher levels of neuroticism personality traits had a relatively weaker positive predictive effect of vocational identity on occupational engagement.\nPositive predictive effect of college students\u2019 personal growth initiative on occupational engagement\nThis study finds a significant positive correlation between personal growth initiative and college students\u2019 occupational engagement, which is in line with previous studies (Sharma and Rani, 2013; Vuyk et al., 2020). And the results of the cross-lagged model show that T1 personal growth initiative can significantly and positively predict T2 college students\u2019 occupational engagement. The possible reason for this is that individuals with high personal growth initiative are willing to spend more time on occupational engagement (Sharma and Rani, 2013). Therefore, enhancing the personal growth\ninitiative of college students can help promote the level of individual occupational engagement, which is beneficial to individual career development. The results of this study further support the view of self-determination theory and career construct theory that individuals with high autonomy motivation usually achieve more positive outcomes in career development (Savickas, 2013; Deci et al., 2017). In the current VUCA environment, the uncertainty and ambiguity of the social context make individuals face certain challenges when it comes to career development, such as employment difficulties and job instability. Individuals with a higher level of personal growth initiative will be more active in seeking opportunities and resources in their career development and reserve career skills to increase their occupational engagement so that they can be successfully employed and increase their job stability, therefore, the personal growth initiative of college students is beneficial to their career development.\nThe mediating role of vocational identity\nThis study finds that vocational identity mediates the relationship between personal growth initiative and occupational engagement. The possible reason for this is that individuals with higher personal growth initiative tend to acquire career-related information and make positive selfchange to further integrate career information with the self as a way to promote their vocational identity (Weigold et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021). Moreover, individuals with higher levels of vocational identity have a better understanding of their career development needs (Diemer and Blustein, 2007), and are consequently able to make more appropriate and extensive occupational engagement. Therefore, increasing the personal growth initiative of college students is beneficial to enhance their vocational identity, which in turn helps them achieve a more appropriate and extensive occupational engagement. This will facilitate college students\u2019 career preparation and help them to make precise management on the path of career construction."

The results of this study support the view of trait activation theory that neurotic trait personality traits are activated in the scenario of career development planning and management by college students, and that the influence of vocational identity on occupational engagement changes under the effect of neurotic personality traits. This may be due to the\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nfact that individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to experience more negative emotions (Costa and McCrae, 1992; Djurkovic et al., 2006), including anger, anxiety, depression, insecurity, helplessness, low self-esteem, mood swings, etc., but their lack of ability to effectively deal with negative emotions, as well as less use of effective or self-appropriate stressful events at work (Zhong and Ling, 2014), thus leading to the emergence of a large number of ruminative behaviors and strong concerns about future career development (Muris and Ollendick, 2005; Barnhofer and Chittka, 2010; Merino et al., 2016). Thus, college students with high levels of neuroticism focus more on the unfavorable aspects of their careers and may develop withdrawal, which hinders occupational engagement."

            "text": "First, this study is an application of career construction theory (Savickas, 2002, 2013) in the current uncertainty social context, where stable and secure traditional employment relationships are being disrupted by short-term, highly flexible employment practices (Guan and Li, 2015), and where individual career development is complicated by the volatility of the employment environment (Noda, 2020). Second, career construction theory emphasizes the dynamic developmental process in which individuals continuously adjust and adapt to their careers based on the experiences they acquire\n(Rudolph et al., 2019). While previous studies on personal growth initiative and occupational engagement have been limited to cross-sectional studies (Sharma and Rani, 2013; Vuyk et al., 2020), this study attempted to construct a cross-lagged model using a longitudinal design and found a positive predictive effect of T1 personal growth initiative on T2 occupational engagement. It indicates that there may be a long-term benefit of personal growth initiative on occupational engagement. Third, based on role identity theory (Farmer et al., 2003) and trait activation theory (Tett and Guterman, 2000), this study further explored the mechanism and boundary condition of college students\u2019 personal growth initiative for occupational engagement, which extended career construction theory. The mediating role of vocational identity implies a role identity mechanism in explaining the effect of personal growth initiative on occupational engagement. This suggests that college students with higher personal growth initiative are more likely to generate higher levels of vocational identity, which in turn promotes higher levels of occupational engagement. Furthermore, trait activation theory emphasizes a unique perspective from interaction psychology that explores the interaction between external contexts and intrinsic traits of individuals, and the predictive role of this interaction on individual behavior (Zagenczyk et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). Based on this, this study found that neuroticism is an important boundary condition for the mediating relationship between personal growth initiative and\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\noccupational engagement through vocational identity. This suggests that career-related role identification processes may be influenced by the level of individual neuroticism personality trait, specifically, individuals with higher levels of neuroticism have a weaker positive predictive effect of vocational identity on occupational engagement."

            "heading": "Practical implications",
            "text": "The employment environment has become unpredictable and variability due to the fact that it is currently in an uncertain social context, that is, the international social environment is becoming increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous (VUCA) (Noda, 2020). Therefore, individuals\u2019 career paths are no longer linear or predictable, and career researchers have recognized this trend and emphasized the importance of actual individual behavior in career development (Kim et al., 2018). Research has found that occupational engagement is an essential behavior that leads to successful and satisfying career development for college students (Cox et al., 2015), and researchers are beginning to look at ways to improve the level of occupational engagement of college students. In this context, this study finds that college students\u2019 personal growth initiative positively predicts vocational identity and occupational engagement, therefore, colleges may consider intervening in students\u2019 personal growth initiative to help them improve their vocational identity and occupational engagement. Thoen and Robitschek (2013) have developed an intervention that can effectively increase the personal growth initiative of college students, namely, intentional growth training (IGT). It contains understanding the process of change (through educational lecture), gaining insight into current life circumstances and emotional states (through thinking about a past attempt to change oneself), exploring issues of stress and risk taking (through describing that change usually involves stepping outside of one\u2019s comfort zone), and setting goals and developing action plans for the future (through the planning of a personal growth activity to complete within 1 week). Based on this, colleges may consider offering IGT-related course practices to promote students\u2019 personal growth initiatives, further improve their vocational identity and occupational engagement, and help them develop well in the current uncertain social context. Furthermore, college students with higher levels of neuroticism have a weaker positive predictive effect of vocational identity on occupational engagement. It indicates that higher levels of neuroticism are detrimental to the improvement of occupational engagement among college students. Therefore, career planning education in college should pay more attention to students\u2019 personality traits, help students with higher levels of neuroticism learn to deal with the negative emotions that may arise in their career development, and encourage them to try to improve their level of occupational\nengagement. At the same time, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing the level of neuroticism among college students (Hedman et al., 2014). Therefore, colleges may consider offering elective courses in cognitive behavioral therapy and encourage students who need it to participate in the relevant courses.\nResearch limitations and future directions\nFirst, this study was conducted in a Chinese context, but there may be cultural differences in the mechanisms and boundary conditions for the role of personal growth initiative on occupational engagement, so follow-up studies may attempt to conduct cross-cultural research to test the crosscultural consistency of the findings. Second, the participants in this study were all college students, and subsequent studies could expand the group span, such as further investigating groups of doctoral students, high school students, or vocational and technical school students, which would help to examine the development of occupational engagement in groups with different educational backgrounds. Third, this study adopted a questionnaire survey method to explore the mechanisms and boundary conditions of the role of personal growth initiative on occupational engagement. It provides a theoretical basis for subsequent studies, which can build on this foundation and carry out intervention practices to improve college students\u2019 vocational identity and occupational engagement through interventions on personal growth initiative (e.g., IGT) and neuroticism (e.g., CBT)."
