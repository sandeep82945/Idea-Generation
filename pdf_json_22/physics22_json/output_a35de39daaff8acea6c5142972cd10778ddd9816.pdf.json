Quantum dots are nanocrystals of semiconducting material, which are commercially available, with gramscale quantities suspended in liter-scale volumes of solvent. Quantum dots can be efficient scintillators, with near unity single-photon quantum yields, and their band-edge electronic properties are determined by their characteristic size, which can be precisely tuned. Examples include lead sulfide and lead selenide quantum dots, which can be tuned to have sub-eVoptical gaps. A dark-matter interaction can generate one or more electron-hole pairs (excitons), with the multiexciton state decaying via the emission of two photons with an efficiency of about 10% of the single-photon quantum yield. An experimental setup using commercially available quantum dots and two photomultiplier-tubes for detecting the coincident twophoton signal can already improve on existing dark-matter bounds, while using photodetectors with lower dark-count rates can improve on current constraints by orders of magnitude.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.095035\nI. INTRODUCTION\nExperimental direct-detection concepts for Dark Matter (DM) below the GeV scale have been extensively studied in recent years (see, e.g., [1\u2013105]). To date, there are a number of leading search strategies, many of which focus on DMelectron scattering as an efficient method to extract and detect small energy deposits following either a scattering or absorption event with a DM particle. Since the ultimate sensitivity of each strategy is unknown, and since there are several unexplained low-energy backgrounds [106] that may impact different DM detection techniques in distinct ways, it is imperative to have a multitude of approaches to search for sub-GeV DM. When designing an experiment it is beneficial to have a low-detection threshold to probe lowmass DM, excellent control over backgrounds, and a target that can be scaled up in mass to probe smaller interactions.\nScintillating targets have previously been argued to potentially fulfill these requirements [8]. For example, semiconductor scintillators such as GaAs, have been proposed as a promising target due to their low-band gap [8,107\u2013111]. Other examples proposed in the literature include directional targets such as organic crystals [112], as well as targets which can probe DM-nucleon interactions such as inorganic compounds [48,113] and molecular gas targets [114,115]. Finally, molecular liquid scintillators have been experimentally demonstrated to be rapidly deployable and scalable, and have already been used to constrain subGeV DM [74,116]. This study advocates for quantum dots (QDs), nanoscopic crystals of semiconducting material, as another excellent low-threshold scintillating DM detector target. QDs are commercially available, with gram-scale quantities suspended in liter-scale volumes of solvent. The basic concept is that DM-electron scattering or, for the case of bosonic DM, absorption by an electron, excites an electron-hole pair in the QD which subsequently relaxes by emitting light. The optical properties of a QD are dependent on its size and shape, which can be tuned precisely at commercial scales.

Specifically, their optical properties when suspended in a solvent and their photoluminescence Stokes shift (shift to lower energy of the emission spectrum compared to the absorbed light) make them very efficient emitters of photons that can easily escape from a bulk target. Essentially, their relaxation properties are very much akin to molecular fluorescence. Additionally, QDs benefit from the DM-scattering and absorption characteristics of bulk semiconductors; when the DM scattering takes place even modestly above threshold, the QD\u2019s electronic response is essentially that of a bulk semiconductor. Practically, an experiment using QDs as a scintillating target could immediately take advantage of the scalability of the target mass and the ease of detecting the photon signal (similar to molecular scintillators [74,112]), while utilizing the small bandgap of semiconductors. Using QDs in particle detectors has been suggested in the context of scintillators that are sensitive to interactions with neutrinos, neutrons, and photons of a variety of energies (see e.g., [117\u2013131]). Following an interaction with DM, an electron-hole pair (an exciton) is created. If this initial exciton has energy larger than twice the energy gap of the QD, it can relax by generating several more excitons with lower energies. This multiexciton generation can yield multiple time-coincident photons as a detectable signal, which would have intrinsically low background. While this would be the most straightforward search strategy for a setup using currently existing technology, future ultralow-background photodetectors capable of sensing single photons could allow one to search for single-photon fluorescence, which benefits from significantly higher quantum yields. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the salient features of QDs in the context of direct-detection experiments. In Sec. III, we describe the calculations of the expected signal rates for both scattering and absorption events. Section IV describes some of the expected backgrounds rates for the proposed setup. Section V presents the results for the expected sensitivity to DM parameter space for the proposed setup. Finally, we conclude and discuss the main results in Sec. VI. Details on a simple semianalytic treatment of the DM-electron scattering rates in QDs as well as a detailed discussion of calculations used in our results are presented in the appendices."

            "text": "While various types of QDs can be fabricated, this study focuses on colloidal QDs composed of elements from columns IVand VI in the periodic table (also known as IV\u2013 VI QDs). In particular, for results presented in this study, we consider PbS QDs, which are commercially available, well-studied, and infrared-active (although there are many other types of QDs with similar properties, e.g., PbSe). Individual QDs of this type have near-unity single-photon\nquantum yield, and their colloidal suspensions can have bulk photoluminescent quantum yields as high as 0.5. These colloidal suspensions are synthesized from solutions of precursors and are available as stable suspensions of QDs in a solvent with a specific QD concentration and a specific crystal size [132,133]. The synthesis generally proceeds through the nucleation of monomeric precipitates of the QD material followed by a period of crystal growth in suspension. Techniques that control the crystal growth phase can generate suspensions of QDs that have very precise size characteristics. The result is a suspension of nanocrystals, each of which consists of hundreds to thousands of atoms. All calculations and estimates in this study consider the simple case of spherical QDs, since these are commercially available and well-studied. However, QDs can also be synthesized in other morphologies which may have further interesting optical properties such as a higher quantum yield. In practice, the term \u201cspherical QDs\u201d refers to objects that are only approximately spherical. In reality, the surface of any QD is covered with ligands, which serve to passivate the surface (allowing charges from surface-dangling bonds to be effectively neutralized), while also maintaining the QD in a colloidal suspension. Importantly, the optical emission characteristics of colloidal QDs is very sensitive to the surface properties of the crystal. For this reason and also because of the inherent complexity of QDs, many of the estimates presented in this study are based on measured quantities in the literature and not on first-principle calculations. A DM scattering or absorption event with the electronic ground state of a colloidal QD results in an excitonic state that is typically well above the optical gap edge. As will be discussed below, the properties of such excitonic states are almost identical to those of a bulk semiconductor and therefore calculating their properties follows directly from well-studied techniques used for semiconductors (see, e.g., Ref. [5]). A schematic diagram of the envisioned experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The spherical QDs are in a colloidal suspension at a concentration for which the volume remains transparent to fluorescent photons emitted from the QDs. The tank is envisioned as a cylindrical volume whose bases are photon collection surfaces coupled to photodetectors such as PMTs, while the remaining surface area is coated with a highly reflective material such as titanium oxide or sodium silicate [134]. A DM particle entering the detector volume can interact, either via scattering or absorption, with an electron in one of the suspended QDs. The energy transferred to the QDs results in the creation of excitonic states. After an energetic (hot) exciton has been generated, it can relax via a number of channels into a band-edge state. Possible exciton relaxation processes are shown in Fig. 2. Relaxation to the band-edge state can happen either\n095035-2\nthrough the emission of phonons, creating a single optically-gapped exciton at the band edge [panel (a)], or by generating multiple optically-gapped excitons at the band edge while also emitting phonons to balance the energy budget [panel (b)]. The latter case is known as multiexciton generation (MEG) and has been experimentally shown to be efficient in colloidal QDs [135\u2013139] (this is the analog of impact ionization in a bulk semiconductor). In either case, the band-edge excitons (either single or multiple) can radiatively recombine, producing fluorescence photons. In the event of MEG, there is a competing threebody relaxation process known as Auger recombination whereby an exciton recombines nonradiatively by donating its energy to a neighboring charge carrier [panel (c)]. This process efficiently depletes the band-edge multiexciton state [140]. However, since Auger recombination requires at least three carriers, the single band-edge exciton is safe from this nonradiative deexcitation. While MEG occurs in bulk semiconductors, strongly confined systems and in particular PbS QDs are expected to have a higher yield of excitons per deposited energy above the bandgap. Compared to the case of a bulk semiconductor, where there is more continuum overlap between the phonon states and electronic bands, in QDs the electronic band is broken into discrete states near the band edge, reducing the overlap and making phonon emission less\nfavorable. Importantly, the existence of real intermediate states between primary excitation and final radiative emission allows one to separate the calculation of the DM-electron interaction rate from the calculation of the photon yield. Experimentally, it allows a separation of the bulk target from the photodetector. The single-exciton radiative quantum yield, QY\u03b3 , is an experimental measure of how many photons are produced per primary electron-hole pair. Since a single exciton can only radiatively deexcite through the emission of a single photon, this is an experimental measure of the radiative branching fraction of the single exciton. Similarly, the biexciton (two pairs of excitons) fluorescence quantum yield, QY\u03b3\u03b3, is an experimental measure of how many coincident two-photon emissions are produced per biexciton. For the case of PbS, the value QY\u03b3 is measured to be QY\u03b3 \u2248 0.5 [141], while QY\u03b3\u03b3 is estimated at QY\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 0.05 [142]. As shown in the remainder of this paper, these values, together with exciton creation and photon collection efficiencies, are large enough to permit an experimental design based on currently available technology that could probe significant regions of unexplored DM parameter space. One of the salient features of colloidal QDs is the Stokes shift between their excitation and emission spectra, which\n095035-3\nis similar to that of molecular chromophores (see, e.g., [143]). For this reason, there is only a small overlap between the excitation and emission spectra, and fluorescent photons cannot efficiently create excitations in neighboring QDs. Experimentally, for PbS, this becomes evident in the bulk fluorescence quantum yield, as discussed below in Sec. III E and Appendix B. Therefore, any sufficiently dilute bulk suspension of colloidal QDs is essentially transparent to its emission photons. This feature results in a fluorescent signal that is proportional to the target volume and allows for easy scalability of any experimental setup. The emitted photons can be detected by photodetectors on the surface of the target volume. The size-dependent optical properties of colloidal QDs makes their diameter, d, a parameter that can be used to optimize the detector\u2019s performance. Specifically, increasing d decreases the confinement energy and therefore also the minimal energy required to excite the QD, \u0394EQD. Additionally, increasing d decreases the Stokes shift [143] and therefore also decreases the bulk fluorescence quantum yield. For the case of DM scattering, we choose d \u00bc 3.3 nm PbS QDs, which have a measured bulk fluorescence quantum yield of about 20% [143] and \u0394EQD approximately equal to the bandgap of silicon, one of our bulk semiconductor benchmarks. For the case of bosonic DM absorption, we choose d \u00bc 5 nm, since dielectric-function data exists for this size. Below, we present rate calculations and projected sensitivities for the envisioned setup."

A QD is a nanocrystal whose characteristic diameter, d, is large compared to the lattice spacing. Therefore, locally, electrons experience a periodic potential. However, globally, the exact translational symmetry is broken by the finite size of d, and the envelope solution is no longer that given by Eq. (1). Specifically, the long-wavelength behavior of the electronic system must obey new boundary conditions set by the surface of the QD. Electrons in a QD occupy states in which the envelope function satisfies these new boundary conditions. Assuming a spherical QD, the electron wave function is approximately given by\n\u03a8\u03ba;nlm\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc u\u03ba\u00f0r\u00de\u03c8nlm\u00f0r\u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere \u03ba \u2208 fc; vg denotes either the conduction (c) or valence (v) bands.

Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the radial component of the 1s envelope wave function. The description given in Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) is most accurate for the lowest-lying states of the conduction and highest states of the valence band, since the long-wavelength solutions are those most affected by the boundary. This is known as quantum confinement. The energetic effect of quantum confinement is to effectively lift the band edge. In a bulk crystal with band gap \u0394Eg, the density of states scales with energy as \u03c1bulk\u00f0E\u00de \u221d ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi E \u2212 \u0394Eg p above the band edge. In a QD, this vanishing continuum at the band edges becomes a discrete ladder of \u03c8nlm states. The energy gap between the highest valence QD state and the lowest conduction QD state (analogous to the \u201chighest occupied molecular orbital\u201cand the \u201clowest unoccupied molecular orbital\u201d gap of molecules) is given by\n\u0394EQD \u2248 \u0394Eg \u00fe \u03c02\n2R2\n1 mh;eff \u00fe 1 me;eff ; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere the second term is the energy of confinement of the electron-hole state with effective masses me;eff and mh;eff , respectively. Figure 3 shows the effects of strong quantum confinement of the continuum bands of a semiconductor. This strong confinement is achieved when the size of the QD is much smaller than the Bohr radius of the exciton in the material. In other words, the size of the QD is smaller than the characteristic size of the bound electron-hole pair. For example, in PbS (PbSe), the size of the exciton is 20 nm (46 nm) [144]. In the strong-confinement regime, the electron and hole behave like uncorrelated particles. Far away from the band edge, the properties of a QD converge to those of bulk semiconductors. Specifically, it has been shown experimentally that the optoelectronic response of PbS and PbSe QDs resemble those of bulk semiconductors for excitations above Er \u2273 2.5 eV [145,146]. The same can be shown from a numerical estimate, since the discrete QD density of states becomes\n095035-4\ndense and converges onto the bulk density of states even moderately above the band edges once any nanocluster grows beyond about 100 atoms [147,148] (a PbS QD with a diameter of d \u00bc 3 nm contains about 1000 atoms). Heuristically, this means that short-wavelength states do not depend strongly on the boundary. Therefore, in practice the approximations of Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) are not necessary for computing rates for almost all cases of interest in the current proposal. Instead, results are taken from more precise numerical codes designed to predict excitation rates in bulk semiconductors. For completeness, Appendix A provides some additional intuition regarding this point. A semianalytic model of a QD as a band-edge dipole correction to the bulk semiconductor is described. It is expected that the leading correction to the bulk description of the form factor will be this dipole term. The Appendix A shows that changes to the dipole behavior of the form factor for an excitation driven by DM do not significantly affect the scattering rate, since that region is kinematically forbidden anyway. Namely, we show that in the limit when q \u226b 1=a \u2248 2.5 keV, both the bulk and QD have form factors that are dominated by momentum transfers localized to single atoms. Therefore, the rate is essentially independent of the envelope piece of the wave function. Furthermore, it is expected that when q \u226b 1=R \u2248 0.5 keV and Er > 2.5 eV, the electronic response of the QD is that of the equivalent bulk semiconductor since the envelope piece of the wave function is a result of the boundary conditions at R."

As we discuss below, final states considered here are always sufficiently far from the band edge; the electronic structure of the QD is modeled using QE-dark [5] as the equivalent bulk semiconductor, with a scissor correction applied to adjust the band gap to be \u0394EQD\u00f0d\u00de. This correction essentially shifts the valence and conduction states of the bulk semiconductor such that the optical gap matches that predicted by \u0394EQD\u00f0d\u00de.

As will be discussed below, the threshold energy for generation of MEG states is approximately 3 \u00d7 \u0394EQD, i.e., approximately 3.6 eV for the case of PbS. From the results of Fig. 4 it is evident that even at the relatively small DM mass of 10 MeV, there is a significant rate well above this threshold energy. Therefore, for these examples the peak rate is expected to efficiently induce MEG states. As will be discussed in Sec. III F, we consider signal events with electron recoil energies in the range 2.5\u201310 eV. This choice is conservative, since it is sufficiently above the band edge so as not to be impacted by the strong confinement effects of the QD, and it is sufficiently small to avoid highly energetic final states, which will not emit fluorescence photons. Moreover, in this energy range, the calculation of the rate with QE-dark [5] is expected to agree reasonably well with other approaches, which either include screening effects [78,99,150] or the effect of core electrons [33]."

For such interactions, the energy transfer to the target is equal to the entire DM particle mass. Therefore, since the typical threshold energies of QDs are in the \u223c eV range, this is also the natural DM mass scale to which such an experiment will be sensitive. Bosonic candidates such as scalars, pseudoscalars, and vectors (e.g., a dark photon) have previously been considered in the literature. However, we find sensitivity to unexplored parameter space\u2014in particular regions that are not already ruled out by stellar cooling bounds\u2014only for the case of dark photons. Therefore, we restrict our discussion to that model. The dark photon, A0, is assumed to couple to the standard model photon, A, via the kinetic mixing portal, i.e.,\nL \u2283 \u03baF\u03bc\u03bdF0\u03bc\u03bd; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd and F0\u03bc\u03bd correspond to the standard model and dark photon field strengths, respectively.

We take \u03c3A from Ref. [152] for mA0 \u2272 5.5 eV and from Ref. [153] for higher masses.

            "text": "If the QD is initially in its ground state and an amount \u0394EQD or more of energy is transferred in an interaction event, an electron-hole pair is created. If the energy transfer is below 2 \u00d7 \u0394EQD, a single excitonic final state can be created, which has the potential to decay into a detectable photon. Theoretically, if the transferred energy exceeds 2 \u00d7 \u0394EQD, a multiexciton state is possible. However, it has been shown experimentally that for Pbs (and for PbSe), the threshold for MEG is closer to 3 \u00d7 \u0394EQD [135\u2013138]. It has also been shown that the surface treatment of the QD, as well as the solvent used to suspend the QDs, play important roles in optimizing the quantum yield of both single exciton and multiexciton states [155]. The number of band-edge excitons generated per primary excitation, i.e., the quantum yield QYex, is energy dependent, and experimentally the quantum yield for PbS (and PbSe) is typically optimized to be around QYex \u2248 2\u20133 at Er \u00bc 4 \u00d7 \u0394EQD [135\u2013138,155]. Since the rate of nonradiative Auger recombination, whereby an electron-hole pair recombines and imparts its energy into a third carrier, scales as n3e=h (ne=h is the carrier density), final states with more than two excitons do not live long enough to emit multiple photons. To remain conservative, we assume that all multiexciton final states with a number of excitons greater than three immediately decay to a biexciton state before emitting photons. We model the function QYex as shown in orange in Fig. 5. Below 3 \u00d7 \u0394EQD, the exciton quantum yield is unity, corresponding to single exciton generation, while above this value the function is modeled as a linear response up to 2 excitons at 5 \u00d7 \u0394EQD and beyond which no additional excitons are created. This functional form roughly captures the spread of values found in the literature with a slight bias towards the conservative direction. Note that QYex should be thought of as an experimental measure of the mean number of excitons created in each excitation and it can therefore be a continuous response. Also shown\n095035-7\nin blue in the figure is the ideal theoretical MEG quantum yield for PbS, which grows linearly with Er."

            "text": "Once single or multiple band-edge excitons are generated, they decay either radiatively by fluorescing, or non-radiatively via, e.g., collisional quenching, Auger recombination, or phonon emission. As discussed above, single-exciton fluorescence is highly efficient with a quantum yield of order QY\u03b3 \u2248 0.5 [141] while multiexciton fluorescence competes with Auger recombination, which lowers the quantum yield for such multiphoton emission. For example, the biexciton, two-photon emission has a quantum yield of order QY\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 0.05 [142]. Since we make the conservative assumption that any exciton multiplicity greater than two is rapidly reduced to the biexciton state with no intermediate photon emission, the resulting signal consists of either a single photon or two coincident photons. For the latter case, the coincidence time is of order the biexciton lifetime, \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u00bc \u03c4\u03b3 \u00d7 QY\u03b3\u03b3=4\u2248 12\u201365 ns, where \u03c4\u03b3 \u2248 1\u20135 \u03bcs is the single-exciton radiative lifetime for PbS QDs (the same is true for PbSe) [132,156].

This is a typical\nvalue for detection efficiency in PMTs used in scintillating DM direct detection experiments [74,112], although newer technologies such as Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs), Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), and Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) aim to push this detection efficiency to near unity. The bulk fluorescence quantum yield, QYBF, is the probability of a single band-edge exciton to emit a photon that can travel macroscopic distances without being reabsorbed by other chromophores (optically active targets). This is an experimentalmeasure of optical losses in the suspension volume (we assume that other losses, such as from photons being absorbed by the side walls, are negligible; see also discussion in Ref. [134]). The value of QYBF is discussed in detail below. QYBF=QY\u03b3 is the self-absorption normalized by the probability of emitting a single photon from a single band-edge exciton. The factor in the second parentheses of the two-photon signal is the detectability of a single-photon event. Note that the factor of 1=2 in the two-photon signal accounts for requiring that each of the two photons hits opposing photodetectors. As discussed in Appendix B, the value of QYBF (and therefore the reabsorption probability) is correlated with the Stokes shift of the emission and absorption spectra, with the width of the emission spectrum, and with the concentration of QDs. The width of the emission spectrum is dominated by the dispersion of the size distribution of QDs, where a tighter size distribution improves fluorescence quantum yield. At room temperature, the line width of a single QD is on the order of 100 meV while that of typical colloidal ensembles is about 250 meV [157]. Experimentally, it has been shown that reabsorption of photons becomes significant for such colloidal suspensions above QD particle concentrations of Cpart;QD \u2248 10 \u03bcM=L [143]. Therefore, in all calculations presented in this study, we take this maximal concentration value, from which one can easily calculate the density of target material given in Eq. (7).

However, we note that the photoluminescent quantum yield of PbS QDs improves significantly at lower temperatures, reaching values more than twice that of room temperature QDs already at 100 K [158].

For the case of MEG, this threshold is experimentally measured and is well within the region where the PbS QDs behave like bulk PbS. For the case of the singlephoton signal, we remain conservative by not counting the region near the band edge where strong confinement effects might affect the optical and electronic excitation response of the QDs. Including this near-bandgap region below the MEG threshold would serve to increase the calculated rate and improve the projected sensitivity of the setup. However, from Fig. 4 we infer that such an improvement would not be significant unless the DM mass is close to threshold. Note that the noisy behavior apparent in the low energy region of the dRex=dEr curves shown in Fig. 4 (which arises from numerical uncertainties in QE-dark close to the band edge) are mostly removed because of this choice for Eth. The upper limit is set by the highest energy expected to produce a visible signal; for higher energies, processes such as ligand excitation or QD ionization could prevent excited states from relaxing to photoluminescent final states.

            "text": "For results presented in this study, we consider two classes of experimental setups: (1) a setup based on\ncurrently available and mature photodetectors such as PMTs, and (2) a more futuristic setup based on highsensitivity photodetectors such as SNSPDs. The former option is achievable on relatively short timescales and therefore, for this setup, we present results only for a coincident two-photon signal under the assumption that this low-background option is a likely first iteration of the experimental concept. The latter option is likely achievable only on longer timescales. For this futuristic setup, we present results for the more challenging single-photon signal, and we show results for an idealized zero background setup. While achieving zero background rates is likely to be experimentally very challenging, we present such results in order to show the ultimate sensitivity of the setup. For the case of PMTs, previous studies focusing on liquid scintillators have proposed and deployed large-area single PMTs as photodetectors [74,112,134] to instrument liter-scale scintillation volumes. These studies suggest that background rates of about 1 Hz for 5 inch diameter bialkali PMTs should be easily obtained when running with moderate overburden (6.25 meters water equivalent), and 0.1 Hz should be possible in deep underground locations and with ideal thermal control. Note, that in previous studies this background was measured to be the dark-count reduced steady-state background in a differential measurement, i.e., data taken with the PMT blind vs observing the scintillator volume. Similar differential measurements can be done to reduce backgrounds here. Furthermore, we note that GaAs photocathodes have been measured to have 1 Hz dark counts at temperatures of \u221240\u00b0 C, while side-on bialkali photocathodes reach approximately 0.3 Hz at around \u221220\u00b0 C [159]. We abstain from making specific recommendations about the exact geometry and composition of the PMT but note that technology exists that can meet the necessary benchmarks mentioned in this study. Furthermore, we point out that manufacturing variance allows hand-picked units to outperform the mean manufacturer specification for dark counts (see, e.g., Ref. [134]). In the calculations that follow, we assume PMT background rates and show results for both \u223c1 Hz and 0.1 Hz. For the case of multiple coincident photons we discuss the dominant sources of backgrounds which are expected to be blackbody radiation and the dark counts of the PMT detectors themselves. However, additional backgrounds, such as Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and lowenergy luminescence [31] from the solvent and from any dielectric holders and other structures inside the detector vessel could also contribute. These effects need to be evaluated carefully before confronting a positive signal with a DM interpretation. For the case of more sensitive photodetectors such as SNSPDs, the detector dark counts will be lower and environmental backgrounds will likely dominate. Furthermore, we note that PMTs in the arrangement presented in Fig. 1 could detect each other\u2019s dynode\n095035-9\nglow during a photoavalanche. This background is straightforward to reduce. For example, since the dynode emission from a PMT has a broad bandwidth, while the fluorescence photons from the QDs are essentially monochromatic, a simple notch filter can be used to ameliorate any potential dynode-glow background. This technique may also be used to reduce potential direct Cherenkov backgrounds. In either case, in situ characterization would be necessary. The single photon background rate of a single photodetector with surface area, Adet, from blackbody radiation can be determined via [115]\nRBBR \u00bc \u0394\u03c9\u03c92\n\u03c02 Adete\u2212 \u03c9 T : \u00f020\u00de\nHere, \u03c9 is the energy of the photon, \u0394\u03c9 is the detector energy resolution, and T is the ambient temperature. For \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9 \u00bc 1.2 eV and Adet \u00bc \u03c0\u00f02.5 inch\u00de2, one finds that T \u2272 230 K reduces RBBR to be below 1 Hz. The envisioned setup includes modules of target material, each as shown in Fig. 1 and each including a single cylindrical tank instrumented with two photodetectors. A two coincident photon signal occurs when both photodetectors record hits within some coincidence time, \u0394tco. The background rate for such coincident events can be calculated from the Poissonian single-photon background rate of each detector, RBG\u03b3 (assumed to be the same for both detectors). As long as RBG\u03b3 \u0394tco \u226a 1, the result for the two-coincident-photon rate is\nRBG\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 2\u00f0RBG\u03b3 \u00de2\u0394tco: \u00f021\u00de\nTaking RBG\u03b3 \u00bc 1 Hz and \u0394tco \u00bc 100 ns (a few times the lifetime of the two-exciton state), one finds that for an exposure time of texp \u2248 1 month, the number of coincident two-photon events is RBG\u03b3\u03b3 texp \u2248 0.52. Since the instrumentation described here corresponds to approximately 10 grams of target material (see Sec. III E), a setup with an exposure of order 10 g-months is expected to be essentially background free for the coincident two-photon signal and any additional reduction of RBG\u03b3 would do little to the overall experimental sensitivity. In order to achieve larger exposures, we propose simply running in parallel several replica setups shown in Fig. 1. Increasing exposure in this way features a linear scaling of the background rate with the target volume, as opposed to the less advantageous scaling of background rates expected from instrumenting a larger tank. Thus, for example, one could envision running ten detectors for one year and achieving exposures of order 100 g-years with RBG\u03b3\u03b3 only ten times larger than the 10 g-month case. Results below are presented for these two example exposures, 10 g-months and 100 g-years, and for single-photon background rates of RBG\u03b3 \u00bc 1 and 0.1 Hz, for the coincident two-photon\nsignal.

For example, for a background-free exposure, i.e., RBG\u00f0\u03b3\u00de\u03b3texp \u226a 1, the 90% C.L. number of events is R90%texp \u00bc 2.99. For a 10 g-month exposure and a single-photon background rate of RBG\u03b3 \u00bc 1 Hz (0.1 Hz), this corresponds to a total coincident two-photon background rate of 0.52 (5.2 \u00d7 10\u22123) events/ month. This is essentially background free and corresponds to 90% C.L. total event counts of 3.95 (3.01). For a 100 g-year exposure, the total coincident two-photon background rate is 63.1 \u00f00.63\u00de events=year. This corresponds to 90% C.L. total event counts of 77.8 (4.13). The calculations above have focused on the case of PMTs as photodetectors. Ideally however, low-background photodetectors such as SNSPDs, MKIDs, or TESs could be used for photon counting. However, scaling up the effective collection area of these devices remains challenging. Skipper-CCDs present another interesting photodetector candidate in the context of scintillator detectors, and one could envision having two CCDs read photons coming from a target; the CCDs have intrinsically low backgrounds, although further reduction of the time to read the entire CCD may be needed for a two-photon coincidence signal counting.1\nWe note that deploying a colloidal QD-based detector at low temperature is not trivial. The photodetector background rate is expected to decrease with temperature, which suggests preferred temperatures between \u221240\u00b0 C and 0\u00b0 C. However, colloidal suspensions of QDs are\n1Taking the Skipper-CCDs used by SENSEI [29] as an example, one option is to collect the charge of the 5.4 million pixels of the CCD into a single pixel and sample that pixel 300 times (to achieve single-electron resolution); this can be done in about 0.26 s. Taking a single-electron background rate of 10\u22124 electrons=pixel=day, achieved in [29] in a detector operating inside a small shield about 100 m underground, one finds a two-photon-coincident background signal rate for two SkipperCCDs operating in parallel of \u223c640 events=year. This is higher than the two-photon-coincident background rate from two PMTs operating with a 1 Hz background rate; however, the readout time scales linearly with the number of amplifiers and the photon detection efficiency is O\u00f01\u00de compared to \u03be \u00bc 0.25 assumed for the PMTs. Hence Skipper-CCDs should be considered as a possible photodetector choice.\n095035-10\ncommonly dispersed in liquid solvents, which become viscous at low temperatures or solidify altogether. Therefore, the choice of organic solvent will have to be determined experimentally. Established data gives an optimistic outlook on the potential for liquid solvent-based deployment of QD detectors. From previous experiments with xylene-based scintillators at T \u00bc 0\u00b0 C, one finds that the optical response of these organic scintillators remains stable for experimental deployment at temperatures where bialkali PMT\u2019s have low dark-count rates [134]. Furthermore, solvents such as toluene have significantly lower measured dynamic viscosities at T \u00bc 0\u00b0 C than xylene (approximately 0.77 mPa \u00b7 s for toluene versus approximately 0.89 mPa \u00b7 s for o=mxylene). Additionally, commercially available PbS QDs have manufacturer-recommended storage temperatures2 of 2\u20138\u00b0 C, which suggests that a T \u00bc 0\u00b0 C deployment is within the realm of practical possibility. If cooling the photodetector below T \u00bc 0\u00b0 C is necessary, e.g., in the case of SNSPDs, then one could envision two possibilities for the QD target volume. One possibility is to cast the QDs in a solid. Solid matrix mono-disperse QD preparations have been experimentally demonstrated in glasses, crystals, as well as polymers with high photoluminescence quantum yields [131,160\u2013165]. Another possibility is to hold the target volume at a different temperature as the photodetector. Such a setup might couple a cryogenic [< O\u00f01 K\u00de] SNSPD to the 0\u00b0C QD target volume via a thermally isolating waveguide. Finally, we note that bulk semiconductor targets with high radiative efficiency (such as GaAs) and QD targets may both have distinct advantages and disadvantages, and it is not yet clear how each of them will eventually perform once experimental reality and backgrounds are better understood. For example, DM-electron scattering in a GaAs target could produce a spectrum of photons (since for each \u223c4.5 eV of deposited energy an extra photon is produced), as opposed to producing only a one- or twophoton signal in QDs; this allows for better background discrimination in a GaAs target. However, in GaAs there are still uncertainties on e.g., the radiative efficiency, how many photons actually make it out of the GaAs bulk, and how well one can couple the photodetectors to the bulk target. Moreover, a QDs based setup has some potential advantages, as they are are commercially available, easy to manufacture, and have a tunable emission spectrum. We believe that it is very important at this stage to have multiple experimental approaches, since unknown hurdles (technological as well as backgrounds) may arise for any particular approach."

For the coincident two-photon signal, results are shown for 10g-month and 100 g-year exposures and backgrounds are calculated assuming RBG\u03b3 \u00bc 1 Hz (dashed curves) and RBG\u03b3 \u00bc 0.1 Hz (solid curves). This setup should be achievable on relatively short timescales. For the single-photon signal, results are shown for a more futuristic 100 g-year exposure under the assumption that single-photon backgrounds are reduced to be negligible. For both signal types, results are shown for a contact interaction corresponding to FDM \u00bc 1 (left panels) and for the case of an ultralight (or massless) mediator corresponding to FDM \u00bc \u00f0\u03b1me\u00de=q2 (right panels). All results are compared to existing constraints on DM-electron scattering from SENSEI [166], XENON10 [2,38,167], XENON1T [94], and DAMIC [98] (see also [74,168,169]). Since the expected number of background events is negligible for a 10 g-month exposure, the sensitivity is driven solely by the signal generation efficiency of the target mass. Because this pilot experiment is background free, it is ideally suited for the characterization of the detector and naturally lends itself as a scale that could be deployed as an experimental proof-of-concept. Even at this very conservative size, the sensitivity of such an exposure is competitive with existing constraints by SENSEI [29] at DMmasses below 10MeV where it would already improve on existing bounds by DAMIC at SNOLAB [98]. Lowering the operating temperature in order to improve the photoluminescence quantum yield and reduce PMT noise, optimizing the QD surface chemistry to improve the biexciton radiative quantum yield, or reducing the rate of Auger recombination at this scale could already probe new parameter space. We find that for the coincident two-photon signal, exposures of order 100 g-years and single-photon background fluxes of order 0.1 Hz probe parameter space significantly beyond the existing SENSEI constraints [29]. The more futuristic setup, which we envision as being sensitive to single-photon events with negligible backgrounds, is expected to probe many orders of magnitude of new parameter space for both DM form factors. We stress that the zero background assumption used for this curve is optimistic and should be thought of as a proxy for the best possible reach of such a setup. A more near-term sensitivity could be comparable to upcoming results from the SENSEI experiment for a 100 g-yr exposure. Current projections for this larger SENSEI exposure are expected to 2See e.g., https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/ aldrich/747017.\n095035-11\nimprove sensitivity over the exposure presented in Fig. 6 by a factor of O\u00f0500\u00de [29]."

In this paper, we have shown that strongly confining IV-VI semiconducting nanocrystals in colloidal suspension are a promising target material, which can be deployed quickly and probe unexplored DM parameter space. The signal consists of either a coincident two-photon event with inherently low backgrounds, or a single-photon event. For the former case, currently available photodetector technologies such as PMTs are sufficient to have sensitivity to DM that would be competitive or even supersede current direct-detection bounds. Such an experimental setup could be achievable on short timescales and requires relatively little research and development. For the latter (single-photon) case, lower background photodetectors and dedicated background reduction techniques would be required. Such a setup is envisioned as a futuristic progression of the experiment. For both DM scattering and bosonic DM absorption, a modest 100 g-year exposure of PbS QDs with a diameter of 3.3\u20135 nm are shown to be up to two orders of magnitude more sensitive than existing constraints for realistic background rates with the coincident two-photon setup. Smaller scale, 10 g-month exposures are expected to be essentially \u201cbackground-free\u201d and present a natural characterization\nscale for the experiment with interesting science potential and competitive sensitivity to cutting edge detectors such as SENSEI and SuperCDMS. The single-photon setup will be able to probe many orders of magnitude of new DM parameter space for both DM scattering and for DM bosonic absorption. Improvements over the conservative benchmarks used in this study may be achieved by lowering the steady-state background while maximizing the detection efficiency of the photodetector. This could be done by running at a deepunderground site and using intrinsically low-threshold lowbackground detectors such as SNSPDs, MKIDs, TESs, or skipper-CCDs. Such photodetectors have already been proposed for use in other direct-detection experimental setups consisting of, e.g., solid-state scintillators [8] (such as GaAs) or molecular gases [115]. Additional possible improvements with respect to results shown in this study include characterizing the biexciton radiative quantum yield of the QDs via sample-averaged time-resolved photon self-correlation measurements [142,171]. Additionally, it should be possible to experimentally optimize the multiphoton emission of the QDs by suppressing Auger-recombination or enhancing the spontaneous emission rate [142,172,173]. Yet another promising avenue is the consideration of cooperative emission effects [114] to focus the emergent photons produced after DM absorption into small surface single photon detectors. This study is a first analysis of the physics case for a QD-based DM detector. Such a setup would utilize the scintillation properties of QDs and would benefit from a\n095035-13\nphoton readout as opposed to the more conventional electron readout typical for semiconductor-based experiments. We conclude that with existing photodetector technologies and commercially available QDs (such as PbS QDs), it seems possible to deploy an intrinsically lowbackground experimental search for MeV-scale DM scattering events and eV-scale DM absorption events that could significantly improve on the current bounds from the leading sub-GeV DM experiments."

            "text": "This appendix provides intuition as to why the scattering rates for QDs can be well-approximated by scattering rates of a bulk semiconductor. Below, we present a simple semianalytical model for the scattering of DM with the electronic states in semiconductors. However, this calculation breaks down at very small momentum transfer, qa \u226a 1 (where a is the lattice constant), precisely in the kinematic region where QDs are expected to differ from semiconductors. We approximate the result for QDs by adjusting the semiconductor calculation at low q and accounting for effects of quantum confinement close to the\nband edge. With these calculations, we show that differences between the two occur in regions of parameter space that are anyway kinematically forbidden. The main conclusion is that the effects of quantum confinement are only important for radiative deexcitation of QDs but not for their excitation rates. Therefore, it is typically sufficiently accurate to use numerical calculations of the bulk material in order to calculate QD excitation rates, while size-dependent radiative deexcitation rates can then be inferred from experimental results. We begin by following previous semianalytic approaches to DM-electron scattering in semiconductors [1,2,4,5,113].

From the BeerLambert law, the molar extinction coefficient is given by\n\u03f5x\u00f0\u03c9\u00de\nM\u22121 cm\u22121\n\u00bc 1\nln\u00f010\u00de NA mol\u22121\nmol ML\nL\n103 cm3\n\u03c3x\u00f0\u03c9\u00de cm2\n\u00bc 1 ln\u00f010\u00de\nNA\nmol\u22121\nmol ML\nL\n103 cm3\ncm\n\u03bbx\u00f0\u03c9\u00de\ncm\u22123\nn\n; \u00f0B3\u00de\nwhere \u03c3x is the absorption cross section for a photon of energy \u03c9, NA is Avogadro\u2019s number, \u03bb is the mean-free path, and n is the chromophore number density. Note that we have specified the units in order to highlight the conventions found in the physics and chemistry literature. One can think of \u03f5x as the inverse mean-free path per unit number density. The factor of ln(10) comes from the BeerLambert law. The transmittance, T, is given as a function of absorbance, A, by\nT\u00f0\u03c9\u00de \u00bc \u03d5t\u00f0\u03c9\u00de \u03d5i\u00f0\u03c9\u00de \u00bc e\u2212\u03c3\u00f0\u03c9\u00denl \u00bc 10\u2212\u03f5x\u00f0\u03c9\u00decl \u00bc 10\u2212A\u00f0\u03c9\u00de; \u00f0B4\u00de\nwhere, for a bulk sample of chromophores x, \u03d5i is the incoming radiant flux, \u03d5t is the transmitted radiant flux, A\u00f0\u03c9\u00de is defined as the negative log of the transmittance T\u00f0\u03c9\u00de, and c is the molar concentration of the chromophore.\nThus, a measurement of the absorbance of a bulk sample of chromophores of known concentration is a direct measurement of the molar absorption coefficient and, in turn, its light absorption cross section. Therefore, measurements of Ix\u00f0\u03c9\u00de and A\u00f0\u03c9\u00de are sufficient in order to compute the probability for a signal photon to be emitted and to traverse a macroscopic sample as a result of exciting a chromophore in the target bulk. Notice that in dilute concentrations of chromophores, after the rapid self-absorption between the emission, Ix\u00f0\u03c9\u00de, and absorption, \u03f5x\u00f0\u03c9\u00de, overlap in axx, further selfabsorption is negligible for path lengths within about an order of magnitude around the l for which the measurements where taken. The relative offset of the peak absorption and emission characteristics for a chromophore is called the Stokes\u2019 shift and is correlated with increasing QYBF [178], since this causes the overlap in axx to decrease\n095035-16\nrapidly. For PbS QDs of d \u00bc 3.3 nm, the concentration at which further self-absorption becomes important due to other factors such as quenching or aggregation is around 10 \u03bcM=L [143]."

            "text": "All results presented in this study were obtained using single electron crystal wave function orbitals and energies obtained using Quantum ESPRESSO [179]. They are obtained from density functional theory (DFT) within the local\ndensity approximation (LDA) using the Perdew-Zunger [180] parametrization for the exchange and correlation functional. Norm conserving pesudopotentials are used for the core electronic levels and plane wave cutoffs of up to 35 Ry (for PbS) and 30 Ry (for Si) were employed in the calculation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. For Si (Ge), a band gap corrected to 1.1 (0.67) eV is applied, while for PbS we correct the band gap to be 0.42 eV. Finally, the band gap of PbS is adjusted to the appropriate value given by Eq. (11) for the QD calculations. Input files for the electronic structure calculations and QE-dark are provided in [181,182].\n[1] R. Essig, J. Mardon, and T. Volansky, Phys. Rev. D 85, 076007 (2012).
