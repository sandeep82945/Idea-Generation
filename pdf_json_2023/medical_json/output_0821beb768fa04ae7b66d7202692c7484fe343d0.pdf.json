    "abstractText": "Accurate radiation therapy (RT) targeting is crucial for glioblastoma treatment but may be challenging using clinical imaging alone due to the infiltrative nature of glioblastomas. Precise targeting by whole-brain spectroscopic MRI, which maps tumor metabolites including choline (Cho) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), can quantify early treatment-induced molecular changes that other traditional modalities cannot measure. We developed a pipeline to determine how spectroscopic MRI changes during early RT are associated with patient outcomes to provide insight into the utility of adaptive RT planning. Data were obtained from a study (NCT03137888) where glioblastoma patients received high-dose RT guided by the pre-RT Cho/NAA twice normal (Cho/NAA \u2265 2x) volume, and received spectroscopic MRI scans preand mid-RT. Overlap statistics between preand mid-RT scans were used to quantify metabolic activity changes after two weeks of RT. Log-rank tests were used to quantify the relationship between imaging metrics and patient overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS). Patients with lower Jaccard/Dice coefficients had longer PFS (p = 0.045 for both), and patients with lower Jaccard/Dice coefficients had higher OS trending towards significance (p = 0.060 for both). Cho/NAA \u2265 2x volumes changed significantly during early RT, putting healthy tissue at risk of irradiation, and warranting further study into using adaptive RT planning.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer and is the most common primary brain malignancy [1,2]. Despite aggressive standard of care treatment for glioblastomas, the median survival is 15\u201316 months with frequent recurrence within 4\u20136 months [3]. One of the challenges that arises during glioblastoma treatment is precisely defining the radiation therapy (RT) target. Conventional imaging involves T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1wCE) MRI and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. T1w-CE identifies glioblastoma by a gadolinium-based contrast agent but fails to identify nonenhancing infiltrative tumor regions. FLAIR is not specific to tumors in that it identifies\nTomography 2023, 9, 1052\u20131061. https://doi.org/10.3390/tomography9030086 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/tomography\nTomography 2023, 9 1053\nabnormalities including edema, inflammation, and radiation effects [4\u20136]. Standard of care RT typically involves treating the resection cavity and the residual contrast enhancement on the T1w-CE MRI to a dose of 60 Gy and treating FLAIR hyperintensity to a dose of 45\u201354 Gy, followed by adjuvant temozolomide [3,7]. In a standard-of-care treatment course, the dosage and the treatment volumes are determined when the treatment is initiated, and are not altered during the course of treatment. However, for treating glioblastomas, the combination of T1w-CE and FLAIR MRIs to identify the RT target may not sufficiently identify infiltrative tumors and can thus result in undertreatment. Combined with clinical imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures metabolic concentrations that can identify infiltrative tumors without the use of contrast agents. An advanced form of MRS imaging, termed spectroscopic MRI, is a 3D wholebrain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging technique that identifies infiltrative, nonenhancing tumors with high specificity [8\u201311]. For glioblastoma, two metabolites of interest include choline (Cho) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Compared to healthy tissue, Cho levels are elevated in tumor tissue due to increased membrane synthesis in proliferating cells, and NAA levels are decreased due to loss of healthy neuronal function. Imagehistology correlation studies have shown that the Cho/NAA ratio is a highly specific tumor biomarker [12]. Changes in metabolically abnormal regions throughout the course of radiation therapy may be useful to provide insight into response to treatment. To monitor volumetric changes, we have developed a pipeline that quantifies the change in treatment volumes during treatment and analyzes how this change is related to patient outcomes. In this report, we show the results of using our tool on a cohort of patients enrolled in a recently completed multisite clinical study (NCT03137888). Information about volumetric changes in metabolic abnormality during treatment can provide insight into the potential utility of adaptive RT planning, a method not commonly used in glioblastoma treatment [13\u201317]. Adaptive RT planning is a strategy that modifies the radiation plan to accommodate changes in tumor and brain morphology during treatment to maximize the benefit of radiation fractions later in the therapy course [13]. The process involves modifying dose, field margin, field shape, and beam intensity according to variations in the treatment target during the early stages of RT. A key component of adaptive RT is the use of an imaging modality that can detect changes due to treatment early on. Since spectroscopic MRI directly images metabolic changes, it is ideally suited for this task as compared to conventional imaging. The application of our pipeline in this context will attempt to demonstrate the outcome prediction capability of spectroscopic MRI after two weeks of treatment (during week 3), determining the potential utility of using this modality to guide adaptive RT planning."

The\nuser first inputs a pair of contours, T1s, and metabolite maps. All images from the second scan\nare registered to the first scan either in Velocity (Varian Medical Systems) or within the program\nusing SimpleITK. After approval of registration, if metabolite maps have varying coverage in the\nvicinity around the tumor, then the quality map for the lower coverage scan is applied to both scans to maintain coverage across both metabolite maps. Overlap statistics between the two contours are then calculated, and difference maps are generated for each axial slice based on the new, modified metabolite maps. After this step, 2D and 3D renderings of the contours can be generated. The steps within the dashed box must be repeated for each pair of contours within a cohort of patients. The final step is to generate Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for OS and PFS for each overlap statistic, stratifying the groups by the median value of the statistic of interest. A log-rank test is performed on each pair of Kaplan-Meier curves to determine if the overlap statistic used is a statistically significant biomarker of survival.\nTomography 2023, 9 1055\nThe pre-RT volume combined with the residual contrast enhancement from the T1wCE received an escalated dose of 75 Gy, while the FLAIR abnormal regions received 50.1 Gy and the resection cavity received 60 Gy. More details regarding patient treatment have been previously reported [22]. Upon completing RT, follow-up imaging acquired every 2\u20133 months was used to determine PFS [25]. OS was determined based on communication with the patients and their oncology team as well as chart review."

The T1 from the mid-RT scan was first registered to the T1w-CE from the pre-RT scan. Once approved, the transformation was applied to all remaining data (contours and metabolite maps) associated with the mid-RT scan. All results were carefully inspected by two authors (A.G.T. and S.K.) and approved by the board-certified medical physicist (E.S.) who is specialized in image registration.

For data acquired during this trial, the brain coverage was 70\u201375% after automatic artifact filtration to remove poor-quality spectra. Such filtering may result in differences in coverage between the scans in areas surrounding the tumor. This process generates a quality map, which is a mask identifying the voxels that passed all criteria. To allow for unbiased comparative analysis, the quality maps with lower coverage masks were applied to the metabolite maps and any contours generated based on metabolic abnormality for both scans."

Dice coefficient (mean overlap) is two times the number of pixels in the intersection of A and B divided by the sum of the total pixels in A and the total pixels in B. The final metric calculated is Hausdorff distance, which represents the maximum distance of A to the nearest point in B [33]. The final quantities calculated are the direction and percentage of volume change. Neither quantity takes any spatial information into account, they only consider the change in volume. Volume change is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the volume of A and B divided by the volume of A.

Statistical Analysis To determine if any of the previously described overlap statistics can be used as biomarkers of survival, we analyzed each one using Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS [34].

We used spatial overlap statistics including total overlap, Jaccard coefficient, Dice co fficient, volume simil rit , Hausdorff distance to quantify how metabolic activity changes after two weeks of tre tment. We the use these metrics to identify a relationship between the degree of change in abnormal metabolic activity and survival in the context of motivating the use of adaptive RT planning. Out of the five different spatial overlap statistics we calculated and tested as biomarkers of survival, the only statistically significant relationships were between the Dice coefficient and PFS (p = 0.045) and between the Jaccard coefficient and PFS (p = 0.045). This p-value is likely attributed to the early separation of curves (around 6 months), no cross-\nTomography 2023, 9 1059\nover, and large separation beginning around 11 months. As shown in Figure 3B,C, a Dice coefficient of more than 0.37 or a Jaccard coefficient of more than 0.22 was associated with a shorter PFS (median of 18.0 months). This suggests that identifying tumors that changed more serves as a surrogate for early response to radiation therapy. While the relationships between Dice and Jaccard coefficients and OS (p = 0.060 for both) were not statistically significant, they trended towards significance. Although there was a separation between the OS curves for the Dice coefficient (Figure 3A) and Jaccard coefficient (Figure 3C), the slight cross-over of curves likely resulted in an insignificant p-value. We believe that a larger cohort is necessary to further investigate this relationship. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of the patient cohort stratified by all other overlap measures resulted in larger, insignificant p-values. Additionally, combining the direction of volume change (increase or decrease of volume) as well as the degree of volume change (percentage) with total overlap, Dice coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient did not result in the identification of statistically significant biomarkers, likely due to the small sample size. The patient shown in Figure 4 experienced a nearly 400% increase in metabolic abnormality volume, indicating that this patient\u2019s tumor was likely resistant to RT. This is further supported by a relatively short PFS of 8.3 months and a lack of positive prognostic molecular data; this patient did not have an IDH mutation or MGMT promoter hypermethylation [8,36]. Patients with a decrease in Cho/NAA \u2265 2x volume could potentially have the size of their RT treatment field decreased in later treatment. Patients with an increase in Cho/NAA \u2265 2 volume could have their treatment altered, either with a larger/different treatment field or with experimental therapies such as new chemotherapy. While this result suggests evidence of a newly proliferating tumor that goes untreated with the original RT plan, it also emphasizes the potential value of a spatial volume overlap analysis tool for providing more insight into volumetric comparisons and showing changes due to treatment both quantitatively and visually. This pipeline can be used with other MRI modalities and volumes such as T1w-CE, FLAIR, and DWI. It can also be used with longitudinal data, providing statistical volume comparisons for more than two studies. Limitations of this study include a small cohort and varying spectroscopic MRI quality. Since the same quality map had to be applied to both scans, by definition, some voxels will be lost, affecting the spatial overlap statistics and all statistical analyses. We are currently in the process of developing new shim-RF head coils that aim to overcome the issue of B0 field inhomogeneity in order to provide improved brain coverage and spectral quality [37]. With only 27 patients, we saw certain trends toward significance, and we believe that a larger study would enable us to investigate these trends more."

This pipeline can be applied to a variety of modalities; in this report, we demonstrated this technique with spectroscopic MRI data collected for 27 patients pre-RT and after two weeks of RT to assess the utility of adaptive RT planning. Adaptive RT planning could potentially limit irradiation of healthy tissue over the course of RT, however; for this dataset, we determined that larger volumetric change indicated response to RT rather than evidence that adaptive RT planning could be useful.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/tomography9030086/s1, Video S1: Demo of 3D contour visualization.\nTomography 2023, 9 1060\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.A.M., L.R.K., H.-K.G.S. and H.S.; formal analysis, A.G.T. and S.H.K.; funding acquisition, H.H. and H.S.; methodology, H.S. and E.S.; software, A.G.T., S.H.K., K.K.R. and E.S.; supervision, B.D.W., H.S. and E.S.; validation, B.D.W., E.A.M., P.B.B., H.S. and E.S.; visualization, A.G.T., S.H.K., A.S.G. and E.S.; writing\u2014original draft, A.G.T., S.H.K., H.S. and E.S.; Writing\u2014review and editing, A.G.T., S.H.K., K.K.R., A.S.G., B.D.W., E.A.M., L.R.K., P.B.B., H.H., H.-K.G.S., H.S. and E.S.
