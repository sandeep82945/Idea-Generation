    "abstractText": "Background and purpose: Sensitive analytical determination of folic acid is important in clinical laboratories due to its versatile biological functions. Experimental approach: A simple folic acid sensor was successfully fabricated based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 modified carbon ionic liquid paste electrode (MoS2-CILPE). The electrochemical properties of the fabricated electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and c hronoamperometry. Key results: The fabricated sensor displayed excellent electroactivity towards folic acid using CV. Under optimal conditions (0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0)), the DPV oxidation peak current was proportional to folic acid concentration in the range from 5.0 \u03bcM to 100.0 \u03bcM with an estimated limit of detection of 1.0 \u03bcM and limit of quantification of 5.0 \u03bcM. Conclusion: The ability of the sensor for routine analyses was demonstrated by the detection of folic acid present in folic acid tablets and urine samples with appreciable recovery values. \u00a92023 by the authors.

Experimental approach: A simple folic acid sensor was successfully fabricated based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 modified carbon ionic liquid paste electrode (MoS2-CILPE). The electrochemical properties of the fabricated electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and c hronoamperometry. Key results: The fabricated sensor displayed excellent electroactivity towards folic acid using CV. Under optimal conditions (0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0)), the DPV oxidation peak current was proportional to folic acid concentration in the range from 5.0 \u03bcM to 100.0 \u03bcM with an estimated limit of detection of 1.0 \u00b5M and limit of quantification of 5.0 \u00b5M.

            "text": "Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of electrochemical sensors and their appli-\ncation in point-of-care diagnostics, environmental studies, food safety, drug screening, and security [1-3]. Low cost, simplicity, high reproducibility, real-time measurements, rapid response, low detection limit and portable\ndevices are some advantages that cause extensive interest in electrochemical methods. Particularly, voltammetric techniques are extremely sensitive and selective for the detection of easily oxidizable analytes [4-\n7]. To achieve sensitivity and selectivity, the modification of the working electrode in voltammetry is a usual practice. These chemically modified electrodes gain considerable attention in electrochemical quantification\nstudies due to the enhanced electron transfer rate as well as selectivity achieved due to modifications [8-11].\nCarbon paste electrode (CPE) has been widely used in the determination of drugs, vitamins and other\nspecies because of its specific properties like easy preparation and wider potential window. The modifier has an important effect on the performance of modified CPEs for electrochemical measurement [12-15].\nH. Soltani et al. ADMET & DMPK 11(3) (2023) 361-371\n362\nRecent activity has focused on the development of nanoscaled particles applied in analytical chemistry to obtain special physicochemical characteristics of electrodes [16-21]. For example, nanomaterials with a large\nsurface area, good conductivity, and excellent biological compatibility can be used as signal amplification elements in electrochemical sensors. Therefore, exploring new advanced nanomaterials is key to developing\nsensors with a high sensitivity and low detection limit [22-24].\n2D layered nanomaterials are an emerging but important class of materials. They refer to materials with\none dimension restricted to a single-atom layer, including monolayer and few-layer nanomaterials [25-27]. In the 2D family, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, WS2, TiS2, TaS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing [28].\nLayer-structured transition-metal dichalcogenides possess an unique layered structure of similar structure to graphite and large surface areas, as well as outstanding physical, chemical, optical, and electronic\nproperties, which holds great potential for applications in catalysis, sensing, optics, and energy [29-31].\nBecause of its ultra thin layer structure, specific electrochemical properties, band gap (1.9 eV), large active\nedges, and easy surface modification, MoS2 becomes one of the fascinating candidates to construct electrochemical sensors with high performance. As one of the layer-structured transition-metal\ndichalcogenides, MoS2 has an analogous structure to graphite, which is composed of three atom layers: a Mo layer sandwiched between two S layers, and the triple layers are stacked and held together by weak van der\nWaals interactions.\nThere are recent reports on using ionic liquids to design high sensitive electrochemical sensors. Ionic\nliquids possess high ionic conductivity, high chemical and thermal stabilities, and high viscosity, and they are promising candidate materials for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors [32-34].\nFolic acid (FA), (2S)-2-[(4-{[(2-amino-4-hydroxypteridin-6-yl) methyl]amino}phenyl)formamido]pentanedioic acid, also known as folate (the natural form in body), vitamin B9, vitamin Bc (or folacin), pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, pteroyl-L-glutamate and pteroylmonoglutamic acid are essential for numerous bodily functions. Since humans cannot synthesize folate, the consumption of natural sources such as some green -leafy\nvegetables or fortified food and tablets is necessary [35-38]. Several chronic diseases, for example, gigantocytic anemia, leucopoenia, mentality devolution, psychosis, heart attack, and stroke , are related to the deficiency of FA. It has also been suggested that decreased folate concentration is associated with\nenhanced carcinogenesis as folic acid with vitamin B12 participates in the nucleotide synthesis, cell division and gene expression. Besides, it is an essential nutrient for pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects\nin the fetus [39-42]. So, a sensitive determination of FA from a clinical viewpoint is very important.\nIn this study, MoS2 modified carbon ionic liquid paste electrode (MoS2-CILPE) sensor was fabricated as a highly sensitive voltammetric sensor to determine the FA. The MoS2-CILPE sensor showed an acceptable ability to determine the folic acid in folic acid tablets and urine samples."

The effect of the electrolyte pH on the oxidation of\n100.0 \u03bcM FA was investigated at MoS2-CILPE using DPV measurements in the PBS in the pH range from 2.0 to 9.0. According to the results, the oxidation peak current of FA depends on the pH value. It increases with\nincreasing pH until it reaches the maximum at pH 7.0, then decreases with higher pH values. The optimized pH corresponding to the higher peak current was 7.0 (Fig. 1), indicating that protons are involved in the\nreaction of FA oxidation (2 electrons and 2 protons).\nThe effect of MoS2 nanosheets and ILs in the modification process was investigated by recording cyclic voltammograms of 100.0 \u00b5M FA at the surface of CPE (curve a), MoS2-CPE (curve b), ionic liquid modified carbon paste electrode (IL-CPE) (curve c) and MoS2-CILPE (curve d). The results are shown in Figure 2. The oxidation current and potential for FA were detected at about 3.1 \u00b5A and 750 mV at the surface of CPE and 4.8 \u00b5A and 732 mV at the surface of MoS2-CPE, respectively. On IL-CPE, the oxidation peak was located at 725 mV with an oxidation peak height of 8.0 \u00b5A (curve c). It can be seen that the oxidation peak potential moved to the negative direction with a significant increase of the oxidation peak current attributed to the\nH. Soltani et al.

ADMET & DMPK 11(3) (2023) 361-371\n366\nAt long enough experimental times (t = 0.3 to 3 s), where the electron transfer reaction rate of FA is more than its diffusion rate toward the working electrode surface, the current is diffusion controlled. Figure 4, inset A, shows the experimental plots of I versus t-1/2 with the best fit for different concentrations of FA employed. The slopes of the resulting straight lines were then plotted versus the FA concentration (Figure 4, inset B). Based on the Cottrell equation (The Cottrell equation is I = nFAC (D/\u03c0t)1/2, where D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s-1), C is the concentration in bulk solution (mM), A is the surface area of the electrode (cm2), F is Faraday\u2019s constant, t is the time\n(s), and n is the number of electrons transferred), the slope of this plot (Figure 4 inset B) can be used to estimate of the diffusion coefficient of FA. From the slope of this plot, the value of D was found to be 5.7\u00d710-6 cm2s-1 for FA.\nCalibration plot and limit of detection\nSince DPV has a much higher current sensitivity and better resolution than CV, DPV was used for the determination of FA. Figure 5 shows the DPV curves of MoS2-CILPE in the PBS with variable FA levels (Step potential = 0.01 V and pulse amplitude =0 .025 V). It was found that the electrocatalytic peak currents of FA oxidation at the MoS2-CILPE surface linearly depended on FA concentrations above the range of 5.0 to 100.0 \u00b5M. The limit of detection is estimated by using the following equation, LOD = 3Sb/m. In this equation, m is the slope of the calibration plot (0.0829 \u03bcA \u03bcM -1) and Sb is the standard deviation of the blank response, obtained from 8 replicate measurements of the blank solution. The limit of detection was 1.0 \u03bcM and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was obtained 5.0 \u00b5M.

The DPV responses after adding interfering\nsubstances into 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) containing 50.0 \u00b5M FA were recorded. The tolerance limit was defined as the ratio of the concentration of the interfering species to the analyte , which led to a relative error of less\nthan \u00b15.0 %. It was found that the 500-fold excess of glucose, glycine, methionine, histidine, alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, phenylalanine, 400-fold excess of Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, NH4+, Cl-, SO42-, 70-fold excess of urea, uric acid, and 10-fold of ascorbic acid did not remarkable interfere for FA determination.\nStability, reproducibility, and repeatability of the MoS2-CILPE sensor\nFor evaluation of the reproducibility of the prepared sensor, five MoS2-CILPE were prepared independently and used in the determination of FA through DPV in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0). Unde r the same experimental conditions, the calculated relative standard deviation (RSD) of peak currents was only about\n4.1 %, indicating reliable reproducibility of the sensing platform.\nThe storage stability of the MoS2-CILPE was further examined by measurement of the FA oxidation peak current over the time interval of 12 days. No obvious decrease in the initial current value of FA was observed after 12 days, implying acceptable storage stability.\nThe repeatability of the MoS2-CILPE sensor was studied by 5 consecutive measurements of 50.0 \u03bcM FA\nwith RSD of 3.5 %, indicating good repeatability of the sensor."

            "text": "A sensitive and reliable electrochemical method based on MoS2-CILPE was proposed for the determination of FA. Due to the large surface area of MoS2, high conductivity and catalytic activity of ionic liquid, the modified electrode exhibited good catalytic activity to FA with enhanced oxidation peak current and decreased oxidation\noverpotential. The voltammetric current response increased linearly with increasing FA concentration in the range of 5.0 to 100.0 \u03bcM and the detection limit of 1.0 \u03bcM was obtained. Moreover, the MoS2-CILPE sensor may provide a facile and effective analysis approach for the determination of FA in real samples."
