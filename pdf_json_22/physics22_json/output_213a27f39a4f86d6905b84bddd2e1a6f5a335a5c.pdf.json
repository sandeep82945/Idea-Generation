Such a problem with far fields was solved by W.D. Hayes pseudo-transonic nonlinear theory in 1954. This far field small disturbance theory is reexamined in this study first by using asymptotic expansion theory. A systematic approach is adopted to obtain the nonlinear Burgers equation for supersonic far fields. We also use the similarity method to solve this boundary value problem (BVP) of the inviscid Burgers equation and obtain the nonlinear flow patterns, including the jump condition for the shock wave. Secondly, the transonic and hypersonic far field equations were obtained from the supersonic Burgers equation by stretching the coordinate in the y direction and considering an expansion of the freestream Mach number in terms of the transonic and hypersonic similarity parameters. The mathematical structures of the far fields of the supersonic, transonic, and hypersonic flows are unified to be the same. The similar far field flow patterns including the shock positions of a parabolic airfoil for the supersonic, transonic, and hypersonic flow regimes are exemplified and discussed.",

Introduction\nAfter WWII, high-speed aerodynamics became important to the design of rockets, missiles, and wave riders during the vehicles launching, cruising, and re-entry stages. Aside from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) helping to predict the high-speed flow fields around flying vehicles, analytic approaches conventionally give clearer pictures about the flow patterns directly. Of course, due to the basic nonlinearity of fluid mechanics, exact solutions are extremely rare. Therefore, people must usually adopt approximation to solve for the flow fields. Most useful approximations are valid when some parameters in the problems are small (or large) in the governing equations or boundary conditions. These perturbation quantities (e.g., the thickness ratio gauge \u03b4 in the thin airfoil theory) are not only in dimensionless form but also used to develop their corresponding perturbation theories and the asymptotic solutions. If the first-order asymptotic solution works feasibly, then its asymptotic expansion related to the higher-order terms O(\u03b4n) of a small gauge \u03b4 is furthermore constructed for higher accuracy. In practice, one (also in this work) usually solves only for the first asymptotic approximation and sometimes the second asymptotic approximation [1\u20133]. When a two-dimensional (2D), steady, inviscid supersonic flow passes through an object with a small thickness ratio \u03b4, (Note that the limit \u03b4\u21920 has a physical meaning only at distances significantly exceeding the mean free path of gas or liquid particles.)\nAxioms 2022, 11, 656. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11110656 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nAxioms 2022, 11, 656 2 of 21\nthe linearized theory of supersonic small disturbance theory can be used to compute the related aerodynamic calculations [1,2]. However, due to the nonlinear nature of the highspeed flows, the assumption of linearization fails in the following three cases [3,4]:\n(1) Corner flow; (2) Transonic and hypersonic regimes; (3) Far fields.\nIn case (1), there is an inherit nonlinear behavior in the supersonic corner flow. The supersonic linearized theory is invalid for finding its approximate solution. Feng [4] constructed a nonlinear asymptotic theory of supersonic corner flow that uses the method of strained coordinates. It gives the correct first-order asymptotic solution for Prandtl\u2013Meyer flow with an expansion fan region and wedge flow with attached oblique shock. The two regimes of case (2) have their nonlinear small disturbance theories and similarity laws for making corrections [5\u20139]. As for the far field nonlinear phenomenon of 2D supersonic flows in case (3), W.D. Hayes [10] proposed the pseudo-transonic theory in 1954 and deduced the inviscid Burgers equation for far fields [11]. From the viewpoint of the strained coordinates method, Van Dyke [12] provided a solution to deal with the far field divergence of the supersonic linearized theory. The shock pair from the leading edge and trailing edge of a thin airfoil in the far field is expected to be one parabolic mirror (with the focus at the airfoils center or the corner) [12]. However, these methodologies in the past lacked a more rigorous and complete asymptotic expansion theory as the basis for their theoretical derivation and analysis. Prior scholars often depended on their strong physical intuition to propose proper assumptions or mathematical simplification to obtain meaningful results. Based on this motivation, this paper redevelops the asymptotic expansion theory to deal with the far field problem of supersonic flows. Herein, the far field divergence problem of linearized theory is first solved by properly stretching the far field coordinate via the perturbation gauge \u03b4, and the inviscid Burgers equation of the supersonic far field is systematically and rigorously derived. Corner flows, double-wedge airfoils, parabolic airfoils, and other flow cases are solved by Burgers solution herein. Finally, the far field equations of transonic and hypersonic flows are directly derived from the supersonic far-field Burgers equation by considering an expansion of the freestream Mach number in terms of the transonic and hypersonic similarity parameters and also stretched coordinates in the y direction.\n2.

The asymptotic expansion in Equation (7) diverges in the far field as \u03b4\u2192 0 , or the secular term cumulates its weighting and jumps from O(\u03b42) to O(\u03b4).\n3. Derivation of Burgers Equation for a Supersonic Far Field In Equation (21), for \u03d52, there is a secular term in the far field where \u03b7 = O ( 1 \u03b4 ) \u2192 \u221e , so the authors define a new stretched far field coordinate (\u03be\u0302,\u03b7\u0302) as shown below to ensure \u03b4\u03b7 = O(1) systematically:\n\u03be\u0302 = \u03b11(\u03b4)\u00b7\u03be (24)\n\u03b7\u0302 = \u03b4\u03b7 (25)\nwhere \u03b11(\u03b4) is the undetermined gauge function of \u03b4.

Again, we found that the shock wave passing the L.E. and T.E. was the same parabola with the symmetric axis of x \u2212 By = 12 in the following: [\nx \u2212 By \u2212 1 2\n]2 = \u03b4 (\u03b3+ 1)M\u221e4\n4B2 y + 1 4\n(96)\nThe iso-Mach lines and shock waves of a parabolic airfoil are all plotted in Figure 2d. Again, the shock position function in Equation (96) of the parabolic airfoil is similar to the case of the double-wedge airfoil in Equation (81) in the far field and matched with van Dykes statement in [12].\nFrom Equation (48), the pressure coefficient is shown in Equation (97):\nCp(\u03be,\u03b7; \u03b4) = \u22122u(\u03be,\u03b7)\u03b4 = 2(1 \u2212 2\u03be)[\nB + \u03b4 (\u03b3+1)M\u221e 4 B2 \u03b7 ]\u03b4 (97)\nWhen we fix the value of \u03b7, the changing of Cp versus \u03be is an N-wave distribution.\n6. Unified Burgers Equation in the Far Field\nConventionally, the linearized supersonic small disturbance theory is mathematically different from the nonlinear transonic small disturbance theory [5,6] and the nonlinear hypersonic small disturbance theory [7\u20139]. As the nonlinear Burgers equation is suitable for the supersonic far field, cross-talk among the supersonic, transonic, and hypersonic far fields becomes possible. In this section, the authors would like to derive the transonic and hypersonic Burgers equation from the supersonic case by stretching the coordinates in the y direction and expanding the Mach number in terms of a small parameter \u03b4 and the transonic and hypersonic parameters, respectively.\n6.1. Transonic Far Field Equation\nAs M\u221e \u2265 1, \u03b4\u2192 0 , the far field Equation (41) for the first-order perturbed velocity potential \u03d51(\u03be, \u03b7) and its boundary condition in Equation (38) can be asymptotically expanded with respect to the transonic regime as shown below:\n\u03d51(\u03be, \u03b7; M\u221e, \u03b3, \u03b4 ) = \u03b1(\u03b4)\u00b7\u03d5\u03021(x, y\u0302; K1,\u03b3) + . . .

Only the regime after the first sonic line (x = \u221a K1 y\u0302) satisfies M\u221e>1 and the far-field Burgers equation (Equation (120) or (124)). The detached distance x0 can be calculated by Ziereps method [14]. We transform the whole-field transonic small disturbance Equation (130) from the coordinates (x, y\u0302) to the oblique coordinates (X, Y) and obtain the following:\n\u03d5\u03021XY + (\u03b3+ 1)\n2K1 \u03d5\u03021X\u03d5\u03021XX \u2212 1 2 \u03d5\u03021YY = 0 (131)\nCole [6] proved the term \u2212 12 \u03d5\u03021YY in Equation (131) to be a higher-order term at the transonic far field, and then Equation (131) reduced to the transonic far field Burgers equation (Equation (120) or (124)) in this work. This deduction is similar to what Hayes followed to neglect Equation (55), and therefore, Hayes termed his supersonic far field approximation as the pseudo-transonic theory, discussed in Section 4 [10].\n6.2.

Unified Far Field Equation The mathematical relationship viewgraph among different high-speed 2D flows is shown in Figure 3. The authors summarized the supersonic far field in Equations (43), (45), and (47), the transonic far field in Equations (124\u2013126), and the hypersonic far field in Equations (158\u2013 160) into a unified form in Table 1. The similarity parameter B in the supersonic regime is \ufffdM\u221e2 \u2212 1, whereas K1 = \u03b4\n\u221223 \u00b7 B2 in the transonic regime and H1 = \u03b42 \u00b7 B2 in the hypersonic regime. The same mathematical structure of the far field high-speed flows allowed us to substitute the unified parameters into the supersonic far field Burgers\u2019 equation BVP (Equations (165\u2013167)) so as to obtain the transonic far-field BVP (Equations (124\u2013126)) and the hypersonic far field BVP (Equations (158\u2013160)), respectively. The far field coordinates and the perturbed speeds u of different speed regimes are also listed in Table 1. Similarly, for the same mathematical structure, the solved far field solutions, including the perturbed speed u, shock wave positions, and the pressure coefficients of different speed regimes, for a parabolic airfoil are shown in Table 2. Herein, the authors more specifically regarded the supersonic far field case as a unified template but only changed the parameter B in the supersonic case to the parameter \ufffdK1 in the transonic case or the parameter \ufffdH1 in the hypersonic case. Of course, the stretched far field coordinates should also be changed as well. Figure 4 shows the iso-Mach lines and shock waves of a parabolic airfoil on an (x,y) plane with \u03b4 = 0.14 subject to supersonic (M\u221e = 2.0), transonic (M\u221e = 1.18), and hypersonic (M\u221e = 5.0) far fields based on the derived results in Table 2.

In addition, the pressure coefficient in the flow field can be deduced from Equation (6) as follows [12]:\nCp(\u03be, \u03b7; \u03b4) = \u22122u(\u03be,\u03b7)\u03b4 + \u22ef (48)\nTherefore, the inviscid Burgers\u2019 equation (Equation (43)) with the boundary conditions in Equations (44) and (45), and the jump condition in Equation (47) can be used to solve the nonlinear boundary value problem (BVP) of a supersonic far field flow with a small disturbance.\n4.

Of course, the stretched far field coordinates should also be changed as well.\nTable 2. Far field results according to different speeds for a parabolic airfoil F(x) = x(1 \u2212 x).

Conclusions\nIn this work, the inviscid Burgers\u2019 equation is a hyperbola-type PDE and can be derived to describe the nonlinear far field characteristics of supersonic, transonic, and hypersonic flows. Compared with the hyperbola-type PDEs of supersonic and hypersonic whole-field flows, the transonic whole-field small disturbance equation is a mixed-type PDE (elliptic type and hyperbola type in both.) The near field of a transonic flow has a detached shock and covers a subsonic flow field locally near the leading edge for the similarity parameter K > 0. Therefore, the whole field of a transonic flow is more complicated. However, at the far field, the transonic flow for K > 0 converges to a Burgers\u2019 equation with a concise flow pattern, and it is similar to the cases of the supersonic and hypersonic far fields. Based on the same mathematical structures, Burgers\u2019 equation was unified to include the supersonic, transonic, and hypersonic far field flows. An example of the parabolic airfoil was shown in the high-speed flow pattern with the parabolic shock at the far field. The far field pressure coefficients as well as the calculated lift forces can be referred to in the study of thin airfoils flying in high speed ranges.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and methodology, C.-K.F.; software, L.-J.Y.; validation, formal analysis, investigation, and resources, C.-K.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation and writing\u2014review and editing, L.-J.Y.; supervision, C.-K.F.; project administration and funding acquisition, L.-J.Y.
