Exploration of Crossoseamines Analogues for Enhanced Anticancer and Antiparasitic Activities: Given the significant activity of crossoseamines A and B against A549, L. major, and P. falciparum, synthesizing analogues with variations in the sesquiterpene and amino acid moieties could yield compounds with enhanced potency and selectivity. This research could involve both the modification of existing functional groups and the addition of new ones to improve solubility, stability, and bioavailability.

Mechanism of Action Studies of Novel Compounds: The paper highlights the anticancer and antiparasitic activities of newly isolated compounds but does not delve into their mechanisms of action. Future studies could focus on understanding how these compounds interact with biological targets, including identifying specific proteins or pathways they affect. This could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and a deeper understanding of the diseases themselves.

Development of Biosynthetic Pathway Engineering for Compound Production: The plausible biosynthetic pathway for crossoseamines A and B suggests a Michael-type reaction involving proline and eudesmanolide moiety. Engineering microbes or plants to efficiently produce these compounds through biotechnological methods could provide a sustainable source of these bioactive molecules. This could involve genetic manipulation of key enzymes in the pathway to enhance production levels.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profiling of Isolated Compounds: Before any clinical application, it's crucial to understand the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (effects and mechanisms of action at the target sites) of these compounds. This research would involve in vivo studies to evaluate bioavailability, half-life, toxicity levels, and efficacy in disease models, providing essential data for further drug development processes.

Combination Therapy Studies Involving Crossoseamines and Standard Treatments: Considering the problem of drug resistance in cancer and parasitic diseases, investigating the potential of crossoseamines A and B in combination with existing therapies could be highly beneficial. These studies would explore whether these compounds can enhance the efficacy of standard treatments, overcome resistance mechanisms, or reduce side effects, potentially leading to more effective and safer treatment regimens.
