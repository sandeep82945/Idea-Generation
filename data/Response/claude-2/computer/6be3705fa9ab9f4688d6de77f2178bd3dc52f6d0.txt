 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Test the method on a larger dataset with more samples across a wider range of DON levels. This could help improve the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish different DON levels.

2. Explore using different CNN architectures or hybrid models that combine CNN with other machine learning methods. This could potentially improve classification performance compared to 1D-CNN alone.

3. Apply the method to other cereal grains and mycotoxins beyond just barley and DON. This would demonstrate the versatility of the approach for detecting toxins in different food crops. 

4. Develop an online/real-time system using hyperspectral imaging and CNN for DON detection during food processing. This could enable quick, non-destructive toxin screening on processing lines.

5. Investigate using the method for early, pre-harvest detection of DON levels in growing barley using aerial/ground vehicles and hyperspectral imaging. This could help farmers identify and manage high toxin fields.
