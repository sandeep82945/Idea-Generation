In this study, a more accurate quantitative method of 2,5-DKG was developed and used to screen G. oxydans ATCC9937 as the chassis strain for the production of 2,5-DKG. Combining the metabolite profile analysis and knockout and overexpression of production strain, the non-enzymatic browning of 2,5-DKG was identified as the main factor leading to low yield of the target compound. By optimizing the fermentation process, the fermentation time was reduced to 48 h, and 2,5-DKG production peaked at 50.9 g/L, which was 139.02% higher than in the control group. Effectively eliminating browning and reducing the degradation of 2,5-DKG will help increase the conversion of 2,5-DKG to 2-KLG, and finally, establish a one-step D-glucose to 2-KLG fermentation pathway.\nKeywords: detection method, 2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid, browning, Gluconobacter oxydans ATCC 9937, feedbatch\nINTRODUCTION\nL-Ascorbic acid has important roles in food (Cendrowski et al., 2021), medicine (Pardo-Planas et al., 2017), and health (Anitra and Silvia, 2017; Reddy et al., 2020). Recent research has also suggested it has particular functions in electron transfer (Xin et al., 2022) and microbial fuel cells (Islam et al., 2020). Currently, in industry, L-ascorbic acid is mainly synthesized by 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2- KLG) via a simple chemical reaction, which uses D-sorbitol as a substrate (Cai-Yun Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2020). In addition, 2-KLG can also be directly generated by 2,5- diketo-D-gluconic acid (2,5-DKG) via a simple reduction reaction (Sonoyama et al., 1982). 2,5-DKG is commonly and directly synthesized using D-glucose as a substrate. In addition to 2,5-DKG being the precursor of 2-KLG, recent studies reported its synthesis may also increase rare-earth element recovery in wastewater (Jindra et al., 2016; Schmitz et al., 2021). As 2,5-DKG reactions during synthesis and decomposition processes are unclear, further research in these areas may provide insights on one-step 2-KLG synthesis and environmental protection.\nEdited by: Tian-Qiong Shi,\nNanjing Normal University, China\nReviewed by: Zhiqiang Wen,\nNanjing Normal University, China Quanyu Zhao,\nNanjing Tech University, China\n*Correspondence: Jingwen Zhou\nzhoujw1982@jiangnan.edu.cn\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nSynthetic Biology, a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nReceived: 12 April 2022 Accepted: 20 May 2022 Published: 08 July 2022\nCitation: Li G, Shan X, Zeng W, Yu S, Zhang G,\nChen J and Zhou J (2022) Efficient Production of 2,5-Diketo-D-gluconic Acid by Reducing Browning Levels During Gluconobacter oxydans ATCC 9937 Fermentation.

(Sonoyama et al., 1988),G. oxydans (Ji and Gao, 2001), Pseudomonas putida (Nikel and de Lorenzo, 2018), and Tatumella citrea (previously known as Erwinia citrea) (Andreeva et al., 2011; Marin-Cevada and Fuentes-Ramirez, 2016), D-glucose is gradually oxidized to D-gluconic acid (GA), 2- keto-D-gluconic acid (2-KG), and 2,5-DKG via glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), D-gluconic acid dehydrogenase (GADH), and 2-keto-D-gluconic acid dehydrogenase (2- KGDH), respectively, on the cell membrane or in the periplasmic space (Kataoka et al., 2015). Then, 2,5-DKG can be transformed into 2-KLG by 2,5-DKG reductase from Corynebacterium glutamate (Badwar et al., 2020). Based on the reported synthesis and metabolism of 2,5-DKG, a new one-step fermentation route was established for 2-KLG production directly from D-glucose, using recombinant Erwinia herbicola encoding the 2,5-DKG reductase gene from Corynebacterium sp. (Anderson et al., 1985). As one of the cheapest carbon sources, the use of D-glucose for 2-KLG production effectively solves the disadvantages of high energy consumption, high water consumption, long cycle, and difficulty in accurate control in other pathways. However, due to uncharacterized speed-limiting factors, 2,5-DKG pathway research is still in its infancy (Panpan Wang et al., 2018).\nThe main speed-limiting issue with the 2,5-DKG pathway is the transformation from 2,5-DKG to 2-KLG. This reaction is mainly catalyzed by 2,5-DKG reductase; therefore, generating a highly catalytically efficient 2,5-DKG reductase could facilitate a one-step fermentation system. Previous studies have investigated different strategies to strengthen 2,5-DKG conversion to 2-KLG, and increase 2- KLG production from D-glucose via the 2,5-DKG pathway; however, the effect is not obvious (Scott et al., 2002; Jeudy et al., 2006; Kaswurm et al., 2013).\nIn addition to generate an efficient 2,5-DKG reductase, it is important to select a good chassis strain (Vivek et al., 2021), optimize 2,5-DKG production processes, and identify possible speed-limiting factors. Previous studies investigated 2,5-DKG production improvements. A mixed culture of two bacteria from soil was developed to convert 50 g/L D-glucose to 2,5- DKG, and generated a 92% conversion ratio (Sulo et al., 2001). In addition, 65.8 g/L 2,5-DKG was harvested from a 10-L bioreactor using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (Qazi et al., 1991). However, the fermentation time in these studies is relatively long, generally more than 120 h. According to our previous studies, due to the lack of standards and the deviation of detection methods, these research data may have large errors. Therefore, the development of a relatively accurate quantitative method monitoring 2,5-DKG changes is warranted.\nIn this study, we established a quantitative detection method for 2,5-DKG based on pure enzyme catalysis. Using this method, we compared 2,5-DKG production levels in five strains, with G. oxydans ATCC 9937 selected as the optimum strain. After analyzing G. oxydans ATCC 9937-mediated 2,5-DKG production from D-glucose, a putative speed-limiting factor was identified. By knocking out and overexpressing the gene encoding the putative rate-limiting enzyme, we identified\nbrowning issues, caused by prolonged fermentation times, as the main factor leading to low 2,5-DKG accumulation. While browning is irreversible, it can be slowed down by shortening fermentation times. To reduce 2,5-DKG production losses caused by browning, we accelerated strain growth and reduced fermentation times by optimizing D-glucose addition at the start of fermentation. Finally, the browning degradation of 2,5- DKG was reduced and production generated a 139.02% increase using the feeding mode. This study provides a basis for further improving the one-step fermentation of D-glucose to produce 2-KLG."

To obtain such a high producer of 2,5-DKG, an effective detectionmethod of 2,5-DKG is required to be established. 2,5-DKG has no standard and lacks quantitative basis, but its oxidation product 2-KLG can be easily quantified. In this study, 2,5-DKG was transformed into 2-KLG by 2,5-DKG reductase, and the actual content of 2,5-DKG was calculated by quantitative analysis of 2-KLG. Firstly, we compared the peak time difference between 2,5-DKG and 2-KLG in HPLC. The peak time of the two were 9.35 and 10.16 min, respectively. Then, the compound 2,5-DKG was completely converted to 2-KLG under the presence of excess cofactor NADPH (Figure 1A); the substrate 2,5-DKG and product 2-KLG were detected by LCMS. After the concentration of 2-KLG in the solution is detected, the actual concentration of 2,5-DKG in the solution is calculated according to 100% conversion. To verify the accuracy of this method, a standard curve was produced for the 2,5-DKG quantification based on the calculation of molar conversion (Figure B), and the results show that the detection method is reasonable.\nBased on this quantitative method, five strains producing 2,5- DKG were compared (Figure 1C), including G. oxydans ATCC 9937, T. citrea CICC 10802, T. citrea CICC 10803, P. putida ATCC 21813, and P. putida KT 2440. After comparing the yield of 2,5-DKG and OD600 of different strains, G. oxydans ATCC 9937 was identified as having the highest 2,5-DKG production (4.08 g/L/OD600) and was chosen as the starting strain. The strain produced 21.6 g/L 2,5-DKG from 100 g/L D-glucose, with a conversion rate of 20.7%. The conversion rate of G. oxydans ATCC9937 from D-glucose to 2,5-DKG is not high. In order to analyze the reasons for the low conversion rate, a detailed understanding of the whole metabolic process and conversion rate of G. oxydans ATCC9937 synthesizing 2,5-DKG with D-glucose as the substrate are necessary."

As only 2- KG is oxidized to 2,5-DKG by 2-KGDH. To find out the possible rate-limiting factors, this study verified its ability to produce 2,5- DKG. Through the detection of samples in different fermentation cycles, the product of G. oxydans ATCC9937 in the fermentation medium with D-glucose as the carbon source is shown in Figure 2B. This study did not detect 5-KG in the medium, it was speculated that the process of G. oxydans ATCC 9937 did not or only produce a small amount of 5-KG.\nG. oxydans ATCC 9937 consumed D-glucose in the first 24 h to generate GA and low 2-KG and 2,5-DKG levels. D-gluconic acid accumulation peaked at 24 h, about 72.96 g/L, and the conversion of D-glucose to GA is about 75.5%. GA was consumed after 52 h, 2-KG peaked at 41.03 g/L at approximately 42 h, and the conversion of GA to 2-KG is about 62.8%. 2,5-DKG peaked at 21.3 g/L at approximately 60 h, and then levels of 2,5-DKG gradually decreased to\n12.7 g/L at 90 h. Although the results showed that 2-KG was completely consumed in about 68 h, the conversion of 2-KG to 2,5-DKG is only 41.4% (Figure 2C), which is relatively low. The reason for this phenomenon may be an important rate-limiting factor for the accumulation of 2,5-DKG.\nKnockout and Overexpression of kgdSLC To block the synthesis of 2,5-DKG and find out other possible transformation pathways of 2-KG and optimize them, it is necessary to edit the coding gene of 2-KGDH. The gene sequence encoding 2-KGDH in G. oxydans ATCC9937 was found by blast. 2-KGDH contains three subunits, kgdS, kgdL, and kgdC (Shinagawa et al., 2014; Kataoka et al., 2015). In order to further determine that the sequence is correct, we knocked out the three subunits respectively. The result showed that, when compared with original control bacteria, all knockouts failed to convert 2-KG to 2,5-DKG. Until 156 h of fermentation, 2-KG concentrations remained at about 75.1 g/L (Figure 3A); the figure showed that the true conversion rate of GA to 2-KG is about 87.8%, which is much higher than the value we calculated before. No other substances were detected other than 2-KG.\nIn the absence of side reaction, the low efficiency of 2-KG to 2,5-DKG may also be caused by the low activity or expression of 2-KDGH. So, we used pBBR1MCS-2 plasmid to complement kgdSLC gene, and replaced the p7 promoter with higher strength to improve the copy number of kgdSLC. Then 2-KG can be transformed into 2,5-DKG again, but 2,5-DKG production did not change significantly when compared with the original control bacteria. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of 2-KGDH did not change significantly whether kgdSLC was overexpressed or not. The conversion rate of D-glucose to 2-KG was as high as 76.3%, while the final conversion rate to 2,5-DKG during fermentation was only 23.1%. However, the knockout and overexpression results of kgdSLC showed that the main rate-limiting factor of the reaction maybe is not the conversion of 2-KG. The knockout and overexpression of kgdSLC also brought another phenomenon; when compared with the yellowish color of the fermentation broth of control cells, the experimental group, which no longer produced 2,5-DKG, was always clear (Figure 3B). In control cells, with increased fermentation time, broth color gradually deepened and finally changed to dark brown, similar to soy sauce. In the earliest relevant studies, it is always mentioned that the production of 2,5- DKG is always accompanied by the color change in fermentation broth. But this color change is more like browning in Maillard reaction. It is necessary to study whether the color change is caused by the browning of 2,5-DKG or other factors."

With increased fermentation time, broth color gradually deepened, andOD420 valuesmaintained an increasing trend. Also, 2,5-DKG concentrations maintained an increasing trend in the early stages, but then declined after peaking at 60 h; the concentration was only 74.52% of the maximum value after 72 h (Figure 4A). Then, 2,5-DKG solution was prepared with a concentration of about 15 g/L, and the same quantity of glutamine as 2,5-DKG was added. After this addition, OD420 absorbance values increased significantly when compared with control group (2,5-DKG solution without glutamine). After 150 h, 2,5-DKG concentrations in control group decreased by 53.9%, and in the experimental plus glutamine group, it decreased by 90.1% (Figure 4B). By fitting OD420 absorbance values of both groups with 2,5-DKG concentrations, we identified a negative correlation between OD420 and 2,5-DKG concentrations, but the relationship was not linear.\nTo further verify that browning is caused by 2,5-DKG, we added a Maillard inhibitor to destroy 2,5-DKG, and then browning will not occur again whether glutamine was added or not (Figure 4C).

To find the best initial D-glucose concentration, we compared the growth curves of strains under different D-glucose concentrations, result showed that the strain grew fastest at an initial D-glucose concentration of 20 g/L (Figure 5A), therefore 20 g/L initial D-glucose concentration was used to optimize the subsequent fermentation process.

The feeding is carried out in two ways; 1) by adding all the remaining D-glucose at one time, and 2) concentrations were maintained at 20 g/L by feeding to finally reach a concentration of 100 g/L. The results showed that the strains grew rapidly in the first 20 h of fermentation, and began to stabilize after 24 h, whether supplemented or not (feeding began at approximately 16 h). However, after reducing the initial D-glucose concentration, the growth of the strain was significantly better than that of the control group. The OD600 of the experimental group was approximately 1.4 times that of the control group, and the finalOD600 of different feeding methods has little difference (Figure 5B).

            "text": "Fermentation broth containing 2,5-DKG is usually darker in color, and therefore, the detection method, which was based on NH4OH-\nHCl reactions (Sulo et al., 2001), caused a large deviation due to culture broth interference. This inevitably affected the absorbance and generated higher 2,5-DKG yields. HPLC approach was relatively accurate; however, a good standard was required to generate a standard curve as 2,5-DKG standards were commercially unavailable, and product purity from self-purification is low. So, there is still a large deviation in theHPLC detectionmethod, resulting in that the detection value of 2,5-DKG in previous studies is much greater than its real value (Qazi et al., 1991). Based on this problem, the method of pure enzyme catalysis can effectively avoid the shortcomings of no standard or insufficient purity of standard, and more accurately quantify 2,5-DKG in the reaction system.\nThe chassis strain G. oxydans ATCC9937 screened by the new quantitative method has a strong membrane dehydrogenase system (Bringer and Bott, 2016; Zou et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Stefanie et al., 2021), only about 10% D-glucose is phosphorylated into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP pathway) after entering the cell and is used for oxidative function and cell growth (Krajewski et al., 2010). Most D-glucose is oxidized in its periplasmic space (Dai et al., 2022) and the final product of oxidation is 2,5-DKG. Some strains cannot completely consume D-gluconic acid, resulting in the conversion of D-gluconic acid to 2-KG becoming the rate-limiting factor, but this situation did not exist in G. oxydans ATCC9937, which can completely consume the D-gluconic acid and 2-KG produced in the fermentation broth, but the final 2,5-DKG is less, and the conversion from 2-KG to 2,5-DKG is low.\nThe conventional idea of metabolic engineering is to directly overexpress the rate-limiting enzyme to improve the yield, but this operation is not conducive to the discovery of side effects. 2-KG can be completely consumed, but the yield of its oxidized product 2,5- DKG is very low.When the cause of this situation is unclear, it is very important to first verify whether there are side reactions and convert 2-KG into other substances. To find the speed-limiting factor more accurately, this study first knocked out the possible rate-limiting factor kgdSLC, and then verified its overexpression. However, the knockout and overexpression results of kgdSLC showed that the metabolic pathway of by-products of 2-KG did not seem to exist or was very few. 2-KG is a relatively stable compound, which can exist in the fermentation broth for a long time without other degradation reactions. The powerful periplasmic dehydrogenase system of G. oxydansATCC9937 can ensure the continuous and efficient reaction of D-glucose to 2,5-DKG, overexpression of kgdSLC by genetic engineering could not further increase the yield of 2,5-DKG. 2- KDGH is not the main rate-limiting factor of the reaction, and the main speed-limiting factor should be the degradation of 2-KG.Many studies have mentioned that 2,5-DKG is easy to degrade, but no research has proved how it is degraded. The data provided in this study showed that the main reason for the low yield of 2,5-DKG is its continuous degradation in the fermentation broth, and the main mode of degradation is browning.\nMany substances will be browning during storage (Tan et al., 2020; Fatouros et al., 2021). Browningmainly includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic two pathways (Paravisini and Peterson, 2019; Pham et al., 2020). The browning of 2,5-DKG is mainly through nonenzymatic reaction. This color change was similar to L-ascorbic acid browning, which is caused by a series of complex reactions during its\nFIGURE 3 | Evaluating the fermentation performance of the kgdSLC knockout strain.

The hydration of 2,3-DKG occurs during degradation and generates colored substances (Penney and Zilva, 1945). As 2,5-DKG contained two carbonyls (Figure 4D), it may have had similar hydration reactions to 2,3-DKG, thereby producing colored substances. Previous studies suggested that 2,3-DKG may have similar antioxidant properties to L-ascorbic acid (Li et al., 2001). Whether 2,5-DKG is also prone to browning, due to its strong reductive capabilities, warrants further research. Therefore, using color deepening as a standard for 2,5-DKG generation is inaccurate. Thus, 2,5-DKG had no color, whereas a yellowishbrown color was caused by browning. Importantly, this browning required no specific temperature; even at 30\u00b0C, 2,5-DKG continued browning with increased content and fermentation time. Because the substances produced by browning are complex, we have not analyzed the detailed browning products for the time being, which may be targeted in subsequent studies. Moreover, the browning phenomenon was irreversible; the only way to slow down the process was to shorten fermentation times and accelerate substrate conversion to 2,5-DKG.\nIn previous studies, fermentation 2,5-DKG usually takes more than 120 h. However, continuous aeration and stirring during fermentation will further accelerate the browning of 2,5-DKG. Too long fermentation time leads to a large amount of browning of 2,5-DKG in the fermentation broth, resulting in very low actual purity of 2,5-DKG. Although the powerful dehydrogenase system enables to oxidize sugar alcohols in the reaction system without excessive biomass (Zhou et al., 2019; Han et al., 2021), too high initial sugar concentration will still inhibit its growth rate and corresponding enzyme activity, resulting in the increase in reaction time. By adjusting the initial D-glucose concentration in the broth, cell growth and substrate transformation efficiency were both accelerated. The time of bacterial transformation of substrate was also greatly shortened, the significant shortening of fermentation time reduced the browning rate of 2,5-DKG in the medium and greatly increased the final yield of 2,5-DKG. Browning will not only affect the accumulation of 2,5-DKG\nbut also the dark substances produced by browning will stain the cell membrane, which will seriously affect the construction of the subsequent 2,5-DKG to 2-KLG pathway. Further research is required to analyze the main mechanisms underpinning 2,5- DKG browning, verify whether there are metabolites easy to combine with it to cause browning in the fermentation process, and further transform the metabolic pathway."
