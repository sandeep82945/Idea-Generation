 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop new theoretical analysis to guarantee the convergence of the proposed InOR-Net model from a theoretical perspective. The current paper lacks theoretical analysis on the model's convergence.

2. Explore new techniques to make the model more robust to noisy point clouds that may be missing core geometric structures. The paper mentions this as a limitation. New data augmentation or reconstruction techniques could help.

3. Apply the model to other 3D data formats beyond point clouds, such as voxel grids or mesh data. This could broaden the applicability of the approach.

4. Investigate how the model could be extended to few-shot or zero-shot incremental learning scenarios with very limited data per new class. This would make it more realistic for real-world applications.

5. Study how the distinctive geometric characteristics learned by the model could be interpreted or visualized to gain insights into the model's reasoning. This could shed light on what geometric properties are most important for recognition.
