The fraction of antibiotic-free neutropenia days was higher for patients in the EDD group compared to control group (median [IQR], 0.8 [0.62\u20130.86] versus 0.51 [0.17\u20130.86], respectively, p = .016). This was true for both perprotocol population and for the allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and anti-CD19 CAR-T subgroups. Antibiotic success rate, breakthrough fever, death within 30 days, and other common cellular therapyrelated toxicities were all similar between the 2 groups.\u00a0\nConclusions \u2013 An EDD antibiotic strategy in patients after cellular therapy was safe and associated with a substantial reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic utilization without compromising cellular therapy outcomes.\nIntroduction Prompt initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, such as piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime, is the mainstay empirical treatment of patients with febrile neutropenia after cellular therapy [1, 2]. However, the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in this scenario is unknown.\nWhile some patients with febrile neutropenia may deteriorate rapidly and are at risk for infections with multidrug resistant gram-negative organisms, for many others fever is secondary to non-infectious processes. For example, among patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, fever may be secondary to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), engraftment syndrome, or GCSF administration [3, 4].\nThe traditional approach to the treatment of febrile neutropenia has been to continue empirical antibiotic treatment until recovery of circulating neutrophil counts [1]. Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance led the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) to suggest de-escalation or discontinuation of empirical antibiotic treatment under certain conditions, irrespective of the neutrophil count [5, 6]. This strategy has been investigated in several studies showing the overall safety of deescalation, albeit including a heterogenous group of both HCT and non-HCT patients [7\u201310]. However, a recent survey on behalf of the European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Infectious Disease\nPage 3/16\nWorking Party showed highly variable adoption of de-escalation strategies among centers, suggesting that more solid data are needed to inform clinical practice [11].\nWe performed a randomized prospective study to compare clinical outcomes of patients with febrile neutropenia after cellular therapy (HCT or CAR-T) allocated to either standard duration or an early deescalation and discontinuation (EDD) antibiotic strategy. In addition, we assessed the use of rapid molecular identi cation of bloodstream isolates to support early antibiotic modi cation.\nSubjects And Methods\nStudy Design And Patients This was a single center, prospective, unblinded randomized study, of patients after HCT (either autologous or allogeneic) or anti CD-19 CAR-T therapy enrolled between January 2020 and March 2021. All patients were enrolled prior to hospital admission. Patients signed informed consent, and the study was approved by the Tel Aviv Medical Center Institutional Review Board (MOH-2019-10-03_007411). Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either standard duration or EDD arms using computerized random number generation (Fig.\u00a01Supplement). Allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.\nStudy Therapy And Procedures Patients who met criteria for febrile neutropenia were treated empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g intravenously every 6 hours), or ceftazidime (2 g intravenously every 8 hours) if they had a documented history of penicillin allergy. Febrile neutropenia was de ned as a single oral temperature of \u2265 38.3\u00b0C, or a temperature of \u2265 38.0\u00b0C sustained for > 1 hour and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/mm3, or an ANC that was expected to decrease to < 500 cells/mm3 over the next 48 hours [1]. Treatment with vancomycin was initiated in accordance with treatment guidelines [1, 5]. Amikacin was added in case of hemodynamic instability unresponsive to a bolus of intravenous crystalloid solution. Patients who continued to be hemodynamically unstable despite treatment with a broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam and amikacin were switched to a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem). A uoroquinolone was added for patients with pulmonary in ltrates on chest imaging. Patients who did not respond to a bolus of intravenous crystalloid solution were started on noradrenaline continuous infusion.\nIn the control (standard duration) arm, empiric antibiotic treatment was continued until recovery of the absolute neutrophil count to \u2265 500/microL. In case of microbiologically con rmed infection, deescalation, if feasible, was deferred until after neutrophil recovery. No de-escalation was performed in this group in patients with no evidence of clinically or microbiologically documented infection (CDI/MDI). In the intervention (EDD) arm, empiric antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 48\u201372 hours if there was no evidence of CDI/MDI, irrespective of neutrophil count or expected duration of neutropeni, and hemodynamic and respiratory clinical stability. Antibiotic de-escalation, if feasible, was performed upon\nPage 4/16\nreceipt of culture identi cation and susceptibility results. Rapid identi cation of bloodstream isolates was performed using the BioFire lmarray multiplex PCR assay (bioMerieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). Microbiological results were reviewed by infectious diseases specialists and used to assess and modify the antibiotic treatment regimen.\nAll authors had access to the primary clinical data.\nChemotherapy Regimens And Supportive Care All patients were hospitalized at the hematology department in single bedrooms equipped with HEPA lters and were treated by a single team of 4 hematologists and 2 infectious disease consultants. Eligibility for allogeneic/ autologous HCT anti CD-19 CAR-T therapy was determined by an expert team based on patient disease status and the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) score, as applicable. Reduced intensity conditioning was based on udarabine (150 mg/m2) with busulfan (6.4 mg/kg intravenously) or melphalan (140mg/m2). Myeloablative regimens were based on either busulfan (12.8 mg/kg intravenously) with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) or udarabine (120 mg/m2), or cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and fractionated total-body irradiation (12 Gy). Autologous HCT was performed with a preparative regimen based on high-dose melphalan (140\u2013200 mg/m2) in patients with myeloma, or the BEAM protocol in patients with lymphoma. CAR-T therapy preparative regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2 and udarabine 30 mg/ m2 for 3 days. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included methotrexate 15 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on days 3 and 6, administered with cyclosporine. In cases of unrelated donor, low-dose antithymocyte globulin was added to the preparative regimen. Stem-cell source was G-derived peripheral-blood stem cells. The CAR T cell products used were either tisagenlecleucel or axicabtagene ciloleucel. Supportive care included growth factors in patients undergoing transplantation from day + 7. Prophylaxis with acyclovir was given to all patients and prophylaxis with cipro oxacin and uconazole was given to all patients given either allografts or undergoing autologous HCT for lymphoma.\nStudy Outcomes Study endpoints were assessed by study investigators who were blinded to each participant\u2019s random assignment. The primary outcome was the number of days without empiric antibiotic therapy and fraction of antibiotic free days out of the total duration of neutropenia (antibiotic-free-neutropenia days and antibiotic-free neutropenia fraction, respectively). Antibiotic-free days were de ned as days in which the patient was not given designated treatment for febrile neutropenia (as such, antibiotic prophylaxis was not considered treatment). The denominator for the calculation of neutropenia fraction was the total number of days with ANC < 500 per microliter during the index hospitalization.\nSecondary outcomes included successful response to treatment, de ned as the combination of continuation of clinical improvement on day 5 after initiation of antibiotic treatment, no reoccurrence of\nPage 5/16\nbacteremia/fever/clinical signs of infection on day 5, and no need for additional therapy on day 4\u20135 after starting treatment. Breakthrough fever (reappearance of fever after at least 48 hours interval from antibiotic discontinuation, death within 30 days of febrile neutropenia onset, duration of hospitalization, duration of neutropenia, graft vs. host disease (GVHD), and characteristics of CRS were also evaluated, as appropriate. The total direct cost of antibiotic treatment was calculated for each patient, based on Israeli market wholesale prices.\nStatistical Analyses Sample size was calculated for the comparison of dichotomous variables between 2 treatment arms. We planned a trial in which the intervention and control arms were independent and the ratio of patients in the 2 arms was 1:1. We used the two-sided t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis. Historical data at TASMC showed an average duration of empiric antibiotic treatment of 5.3 days, corresponding to a 0.5 fraction of antibiotic-free neutropenia days. Assuming the study intervention would decrease this fraction to 0.30 (average of 3.3 days), 36 patients would be required per treatment arm in order to reject the null hypothesis with a power of 0.8 and a one-sided alpha of 0.05. Considering that about 80% of the randomized patients would go on to develop febrile neutropenia, we planned to enroll 50 patients in each arm.\nAll primary and secondary analyses were prespeci ed. Outcomes were assessed among all patients who developed febrile neutropenia (intention-to-treat analysis [ITT]). For the overall and individual end points, the observed proportion of patients with a favorable outcome was determined and 95% con dence intervals were calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Student's t and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for independent samples were used to compare normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively, and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. P values were two-sided; P values \u2264 0.05 were considered to represent statistical signi cance. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.1 (R foundation).\nResults\nEnrollment One-hundred-ten patients signed informed consent and underwent randomization (control group, n = 51, intervention group, n = 59), Fig.\u00a01. There were no signi cant differences between the study arms in terms of baseline patient demographics, characteristics of diseases, and comorbidities, Table\u00a01. All patients were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.\nPage 6/16\nTable 1 Characteristics of Patients\n\u00a0 ITT Per protocol\n\u00a0 Standard group (n = 51)\nStewardship group (n = 59)\nP Standard group (n = 41)\nStewardship group (n = 50)\nP\nAge (years) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n60.6 (8.3) 61.2 (12.5) .79 60.3 (8.2) 60.7 (12.9) .85\nSex, male (%) 26 (51) 38 (64) .18 21 (51) 31 (62) .4\nPrimary diagnosis-n (%) \u00a0 .33 \u00a0 .13\n-Acute leukemia/MDS 9 (18) 14 (23) 4 (10) 13 (25) \u00a0\n-Lymphoma 17 (33) 27 (46) 16 (39) 21 (41) \u00a0\n-Multiple Myeloma 24 (47) 18 (31) 20 (49) 17 (34) \u00a0\n-Other 1 (2) 0 (0) 1 (2) 0 (0) \u00a0\nReason for admission-n (%)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 .93 \u00a0 \u00a0 .54\n- allogeneic HCT 13 (25) 17 (29) 8 (20) 15 (30) \u00a0\n- autologous HCT 26 (51) 30 (51) 22 (53) 24 (48) \u00a0\n- CAR-T 12 (24) 12 (20) 11 (27) 11 (22) \u00a0\nHCTCI (mean \u00b1 SD)* 2 (2) 2 (2) .78 2.2 (1.9) 2.1 (2.1) .97\nKarnofsky score % (mean \u00b1 SD)\n80 (10) 80 (10) .28 80 (10) 80 (10) .32\nNeutropenia < 500/microL (days) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n8 (4) 9 (7) .36 9.1 (4.4) 9.6 (6.5) .65\nNeutropenia < 100/ microL (days) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n6 (4) 7 (6) .45 7.1 (4.4) 7.4 (6.3) .80\nFluoroquinolone prophylaxis -n (%)\n20 (39) 28 (47) .55 17 (41) 24 (48) .59\nHCT-hematopoietic cell transplantation, MDS \u2013 myelodysplastic syndrome, HCTCI \u2013 HCT Comorbidity index, CAR-T \u2013 chimeric antigen receptor T cells, SD \u2013 standard deviation\n*Assessed only in patients that underwent HCT\nOne patient from the control group withdrew informed consent. Forty-one (82%) and 50 (85%) patients, respectively, P = 0.7, developed febrile neutropenia and were included in the per-protocol analysis.\nPage 7/16\nAmong patients with febrile neutropenia (n = 91), 78 patients (86%) were initially treated with piperacillintazobactam, 8 (8.7%) were treated with ceftazidime and 2 (2.1%) were treated with meropenem. Three patients (3.2%) were treated with ceftriaxone and were switched to meropenem within 48 hours. Fourteen patients (15.3%) received vancomycin as part of their initial antibiotic regimen.\nDocumented Infections Fourteen patients (15.3%) had clinically documented infections. Six (6.5%) had central venous catheter exit site or tunnel infection, 5 (5.4%) had opacities on chest imaging consistent with in ammatory in ltrates, 2 (2.1%) had dental infection, and 1 (1.0%) had enterocolitis.\nMDIs were observed in 18 (19.7%) patients, and in all cases these were bloodstream infection (BSIs). Out of 26 bloodstream isolates, Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 15 cases (58%) and Gram-positive organisms in 11 (42%). Eight cases were polymicrobial, including either Gram positive (n = 2), Gram negative (n = 3) or combined Gram positive and Gram-negative organisms (n = 3), Fig.\u00a02, supplement. There were no infections with extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\nAmong patients who received empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia, de-escalation was performed in 9 patients (18%) in the EDD group compared to 1 (2.5%) in the control group, p = 0.038 and complete discontinuation prior to ANC count recovery was performed in 27 (54%) compared to 0 (0%), respectively, p < 0.0001 (Table\u00a03). Among patients with CDI/MDI, de-escalation was performed in 8 (88.8%) vs. 0 (0%), respectively, p = 0.00011. Mean duration of treatment was shorter in the EDD group compared to the control group (3 \u00b1 3.4 days vs. 5.1 \u00b1 5.7 days, respectively; p = 0.026).\nPage 8/16\nTable 3 Treatment outcomes of patients with febrile neutropenia\n\u00a0 Standard arm Stewardship arm\nP Total\nITT cohort N = 51 N = 59 \u00a0 N = 110\nTreatment success 39 (78.0) 50 (84.7) 0.45 \u00a0\nMDI* 8/10 (80.0) 5/9 (55.5) 0.34 13/19 (68.4)\nDe-escalation 1 (2.5) 9 (18.0) 0.038 \u00a0\nDiscontinuation 0 (0) 27 (54.0) < 0.0001\n\u00a0\nLength of stay (days) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n23 \u00b1 9 25 \u00b1 16 0.85 24 \u00b1 11\nNeutropenia (days) (median \u00b1 IQR)\n7 (4.2) 7 (5) 0.89 7 (4.6)\nBreakthrough fever 12 (24) 14 (24) 0.98 26 (24)\nAcute GVHD (cumulative Incidence)\n37% (95% CI 15%-44%)\n22%(95%CI 0%-35%)\n0.708 31% (95%CI 0%-41%)\nCytokine release syndrome (rate)\n9 (75%) 10 (83%) 0.615 79%\nDeath at 30 days 3 (6) 2 (3.3) 0.65 5 (4.5)\nPer-protocol cohort N = 40 N = 51 \u00a0 N = 91\nTreatment success 30 (75.0%) 43 (84.3%) .29 \u00a0\nMDI* 8/10 (80.0%) 5/8 (62.5%) .60 13/18 (72.2%)\nDe-escalation 1 (2.5) 8 (16.3) 0.040 \u00a0\nDiscontinuation 0 (0) 27 (55.1) < 0.0001\n\u00a0\nLength of stay (days) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n23 \u00b1 9 25 \u00b1 16 .85 24 \u00b1 11\nNeutropenia (days) (mean \u00b1 SD)\n7 (4.2) 7 (5) .89 7 (4.6)\nBreakthrough fever 12 (30%) 14 (27%) .79 26 (29%)\nDeath, 30 days 2 (5.0%) 2 (3.9%) 1.0 5 (5.4%)\nMDI \u2013 Microbiology documented infection, BSI \u2013 Blood stream infection, GVHD \u2013 graft versus host disease\n* All MDIs were also BSIs\nPage 9/16\nTreatment Outcomes Primary endpoint.

Duration of neutropenia was associated with both lower treat success and higher rate of death within 30 days, while all other tested variables (treatment arm, CDI, MDI, sex, age, CAR-T infusion, and prophylaxis with uroquinolone) were not signi cantly associated with either treatment success or death within 30 days from infusion of cells (Table\u00a04).\nTable 4 \u2013 Factors associated with treatment success or death within 30 days\nVariable Treatment success Death within 30 days\n\u00a0 Odds ratio 95% CI Odds ratio 95% CI\nStewardship arm 1.56 0.52\u20134.72 0.55 0.044\u20135.034\nCDI 0.34 0.087\u20131.48 4.98 0.38\u201348.34\nMDI 0.40 0.11\u20131.51 1.19 0.022\u201313.019\nMale sex 0.39 0.10\u20131.26 3.023 0.28-153.41\nAge 0.99 0.94\u20131.037 1.075 0.97\u20131.23\nCAR-T 0.55 0.16\u20132.025 0.0 0.0-3.85\nNeutropenia duration 0.88 0.80\u20130.95 1.16 1.039\u20131.32\nFluoroquinolone prophylaxis 0.49 0.15\u20131.47 INF 1.13-INF\nCDI \u2013 Clinical documented infection, MDI \u2013 microbiology documented infection, CAR-T \u2013 chimeric antigen receptor T cells\nOut of the 9 patients in the EDD group who developed MDI, results of 8 patients were available for the assessment of lmarray multiplex PCR assay as an early predictor of bloodstream infection. In 4 (50%) (GPC, n = 3 and GNR, n = 1), lmarray results led to a modi cation of the antibiotic regimen, with a median of 18 (range, 16\u201324) hours before the conventional bacterial identi cation results were available.\nThe mean cost of antibiotic treatment was lower in the EDD group compared to the control group (70 \u00b1 103 vs. 98 \u00b1 82 EUR, p = 0.14 for the ITT analysis and 70 \u00b1 103 vs.108 \u00b1 79 EUR, p = 0.05 for the per protocol analysis). relative cost-reduction was more signi cant for patients with non-CDI/MDI febrile neutropenia (37 \u00b1 17 vs. 80 \u00b1 59 EUR, p = 0.002).\nPage 11/16\nDiscussion This prospective randomized study evaluated the safety and the non-inferiority of early de-escalation and discontinuation of empiric antibiotics in patients who developed febrile neutropenia after receiving cellular therapy (either HCT or CAR-T treatment). We showed that the fraction of neutropenia-free antibiotic days was higher in patients in the intervention group compared to patients in the standard duration (control) group with similar results in all subgroups (allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, and CAR-T treatments). Furthermore, treatment success rates were similar between the 2 treatment arms. Thus, antibiotic restriction was safe and was not associated with higher failure rate. Other safety end points and cellular-therapy speci c toxicities were also similar between the study treatment arms.\nPatients receiving cellular therapy are at a high risk of infectious complications, depending on the duration and nadir of neutropenia, as well as on additional immunosuppressive therapy and disruption of skin or mucosal barriers associated with the preparative regimen [12]. Nevertheless, other cellular therapyassociated complications like CRS after CAR-T therapy or haploidentical HCT, engraftment syndrome and GCSF-associated fever are other common reasons for fever in this setting [13\u201315]. Moreover, challenges associated with increasing multidrug-resistance bacteria, higher incidence of Clostridioides di cile infection, and a growing understanding of the association between antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and poor outcomes of cellular therapeutics resulted in the recommendation to consider stewardship programs in patients after HCT [5, 16, 17]. Speci cally, dysbiosis of gut microbiome (i.e, decrease in microbial diversity and increase in proin ammatory microbial species) was associated with an increased risk for GVHD in the allogeneic HCT setting, and with a higher hematologic relapse rates following both allogeneic HCT and CAR-T therapy [17\u201320]. In addition, identi cation of multidrug resistant bacteria during HCT has been also shown to impact transplantation outcome [21]. In line with this, previous studies that included patients after HCT showed that limiting antibiotic treatment duration was feasible and safe, and associated with reductions in the unnecessary exposure to Gram-positive broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs [7\u20139].\nIn the How Long trial, conducted among high-risk patients for febrile neutropenia and comparing a stewardship strategy to standard treatment, 50% of the cohort were patients after HCT [7]. This study showed that the mean number of empirical antibiotic-free days was signi cantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group (16.1 vs 13.6, p = 0.026). Similarly, we showed that the median fraction of antibiotic-free neutropenia days was signi cantly higher in patients allocated to the EDD arm compared to those allocated to the standard treatment arm (0.8 vs. 0.51, respectively, p = 0.016). Decreasing the number of antibiotic days was safe, and there was similar treatment success rate between the 2 groups. Antibiotic treatment duration was not associated with the incidence of CRS in patients after CAR-T therapy or the incidence of GVHD after allogeneic HCT. While decreasing antibiotic days had some economic bene t it was not substantially meaningful.\nOur study is limited by several factors. First, the unblinded nature of this study may introduce bias in terms of antibiotic consumption in the control group. Second, the incidence of multidrug resistant\nPage 12/16\nbacteria and C. di cile infections was surprisingly low, limiting the generalizability of the ndings to settings with high rates of drug resistant organisms. No association was found between EDD and the incidence of GVHD or CRS. larger cohorts may be needed to further investigate the impact on these outcomes. Nevertheless, the fact that all patients were treated in a single institution and under prospective-designed protocol contribute to the power of evidence of both in patients after HCT, and also after CAR-T cell infusion.\nTo conclude, a restrictive strategy of early antibiotic de-escalation and discontinuation resulted in signi cant reductions in antibiotic use without adversely affecting clinical patient outcomes. Longer follow-up is required to assess the effects of the EDD strategy on late patient outcomes and the frequency of drug-resistant organisms in the HCT/CART patient population. Novel markers for infection in high risk population and Implementation of stewardship strategy in transplantation centers should be considered.\nDeclarations Acknowledgments\nThis work did not receive external funding.\nAuthorship contributions\nRR, OA, RB provided conception and design of the study; RR, OA, AAYBO, OBK, DS, RBA provided study materials or patients; RR, OA, AA RBA were responsible for the collection and assembly of data; RR, IA, DS, RBA, provided data analysis\u00a0and\u00a0interpretation; RR, OA, RBA wrote the manuscript; all authors gave their approval for the nal version of the manuscript.
