    "abstractText": "Transition metal sulphide electrocatalytic materials possess the bright overall watersplitting performance of practical electrocatalytic technologies. In this study, an amethyst-like MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4 rod electrocatalyst was constructed via a one-step hydrothermal method with in-situ-grown ZIF-67 nanoparticles on nickel foam (NF) as a precursor. The rational design and synthesis of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4 endow the catalyst with neat nanorods morphology and high conductivity. The MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF with the amethyst-like rod structure exposes abundant active sites and displays fast electron-transfer capability. The resultant MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activities, with low overpotentials of 81.24 mV (HER) at 10 mA cm\u22122 and 159.67 mV (OER) at 50 mA cm\u22122 in 1.0 M KOH solution. The full-cell voltage of overall water splitting only achieves 1.45 V at 10 mA cm\u22122. The successful preparation of the amethyst-like MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4 rod electrocatalyst provides a reliable reference for obtaining efficient electrocatalysts for overall",

            "text": "Studies have long focused on developing environmentally friendly and recyclable clean energy materials to replace depleted fossil fuels [1\u20133]. In this respect, hydrogen has become one of the most important material candidates for future energy technologies, owing to its cleanliness, renewability, and high calorific value [4\u20136]. Compared with numerous other hydrogen-production methods (e.g., coal gasification, steam methane reforming, biomass conversion, and photocatalytic hydrogen [7]), water-splitting technology has more potential since it only needs a certain voltage to produce high-purity hydrogen simply and without any pollution [8]. Typically, water splitting produces hydrogen and oxygen via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [9]. In the alkaline solution, the HER usually occurs through Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky or Volmer\u2013Tafel mechanism as follows [10,11]:\nH2O + e\u2212 + \u2217 \u2192 H\u2217 + OH\u2212(Volmer step)\nH2O + e\u2212 + H\u2217 \u2192 H2 + OH\u2212 + \u2217(Heyrovsky Step)\nH\u2217 + H\u2217 \u2192 H2 + 2 \u2217 (Tafel step)\nwherein \u2217 is the active adsorption site of the catalyst and (H\u2217) is the adsorbed hydrogen. The OER mechanism can be described as follows [12]:\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2302. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13162302 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2302 2 of 14\nOH\u2212 + \u2217 \u2192 OH\u2217 + e\u2212\nOH\u2217 + OH\u2212 \u2192 O\u2217 + H2O + e\u2212\nO\u2217 + OH\u2212 \u2192 OOH\u2217 + e\u2212\nOOH\u2217 + OH\u2212 \u2192 O2 + \u2217+ H2O + e\u2212\nwherein \u2217 is the active adsorption site, and OH\u2217, O\u2217, and OOH\u2217 are the intermediates. Compared with the HER, the OER involves more intermediates and has a more complicated reaction process. Due to the confinement of material active sites and the complex electrontransfer process of the OER, a high potential is typically required to drive the actual water splitting [13]. Electrocatalysts based on noble metals (Pt and Ru/Ir) can effectively reduce the overpotential of the HER and OER in the water-splitting process. However, the rare reserves and high cost of noble-metal-based electrocatalysts prevent them from being applied to long-term and large-scale hydrogen production in the future [14\u201316]. Therefore, the development of low-cost bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high activity is key to achieving long-term and efficient hydrogen production through water splitting [17\u201319]. Earth-abundant transition metals have attracted considerable attention because of their good catalytic activity and low cost [11,12]. To date, numerous transition-metal-based electrocatalytic materials have been studied, including Ni-based sulphides [10,20], Co-based phosphides/sulphides [8,21\u201323], and Mo-based sulphides [24,25]. Among these materials, Ni-, Co-, and Mo-based sulphides are considered potential electrocatalysts for water splitting because of their abundant active sites and adjustable electronic properties [26]. However, single-component sulphide materials typically exhibit monofunctional catalytic activity for either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Strategies by combining different kinds of transition metal sulphides can effectively improve the activity of catalysts and achieve bifunctional catalytic performance [27\u201329]. Chen et al. constructed a Ni9S8/MoS2 nanosheet-modified NiMoO4 nanorod electrocatalyst with overpotentials of 190 (HER) and 360 mV (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 [27]. Yang et al. synthesized a hierarchical nanoassembly MoS2/Co9S8/Ni3S2/Ni electrocatalyst, which exhibited high HER and OER bifunctional catalytic activities in a wide pH range [30]. Moreover, designing and regulating the structural morphology of electrocatalytic materials are also effective strategies to enhance the activity of electrocatalysts [21]. Recently, the construction of unique electrocatalyst morphologies by incorporating zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) has attracted significant interest [24,31\u201333]. The introduction of ZIF-67 during the preparation of electrocatalysts can not only regulate the structure of the electrocatalyst but also introduce the Co element [33\u201340]. For example, Guo et al. synthesized hollow Co3S4@MoS2 derived from ZIF-67 using a two-step hydrothermal and calcination method, whereby hollow Co3S4@MoS2 exhibited an overpotential of 330 mV (HER) at 10 mA cm\u22122 [41]. Peng et al. combined carbon nanofibers and ZIF-67 to prepare tubular electrocatalytic materials with rough surfaces that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the OER after calcination [42]. However, most electrocatalytic materials derived from ZIF-67 exhibited high overpotentials, owing to the poor conductivity of ZIF-67 [13,24]. Although high-temperature calcination can enhance the conductivity of electrocatalysts, it may destroy the structural characteristics and active catalytic sites of the catalyst [43,44]. According to the previous reports, ZIF-67 can be etched by the sulphide to release Co2+ under hydrothermal conditions, and the conductivity and exposed active sites of the ZIF-derived electrocatalysts can be improved [45]. However, most of the research directly added ZIF-67 powder into the precursor solution to regulate reactions, which may lead to the serious agglomeration of the prepared electrocatalyst [33,46]. The preparation of electrocatalysts by a one-step hydrothermal method using ZIF-67/NF as a precursor is rarely reported.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2302 3 of 14\nGe et al. reported a non-agglomerated MoS2/CoP electrocatalyst exhibiting enhanced HER activity prepared by hydrothermal reaction of ZIF-67 precursor grown on titanium foil (TF) [47]. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of an amethyst-like MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4 rod electrocatalyst with high conductivity and rich active sites via a convenient hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the synergistic effects and improved electronic environment, MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF shows low overpotentials for the HER at 10 mA cm\u22122 and the OER at 50 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline solution and possesses a low full-cell voltage of overall water splitting at 10 mA cm\u22122 and excellent electrocatalytic stability."

As shown in Figure 3, all sample patterns display strong diffraction peaks at 44.5\u25e6, 51.8\u25e6, and 76.4\u25e6 corresponding to Ni foam (PDF#87-0712) (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes, respectively, which are derived from the NF substrate. Owing to the strong Ni peak, the diffraction peaks of ZIF-67/NF and Mo-ZIF-67/NF are less obvious. S-ZIF-67/NF exhibits clear diffraction peaks at 31.4\u25e6, 38.1\u25e6, 50.2\u25e6, 55.1\u25e6, and 77.8\u25e6 that correspond to the (311), (400), (511), (440), and (731) crystal planes of Co3S4 (PDF#47-1738), and the peaks at 21.5\u25e6, 38.6\u25e6, 50.5\u25e6, 55.5\u25e6, 69.6\u25e6, and 72.9\u25e6 could be indexed to (201), (241), (153), (530), (082), and (207) crystal planes of Ni9S8 (PDF#22-1193), respectively. MoS2/Ni9S8/NF and MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF present weak peaks of MoS2 (PDF#37-1492) and Ni9S8 (PDF#221193). Thus, to reduce the influence of NF-derived Ni, MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF powder was scraped from the NF for XRD analysis.

The optimal HER performance of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF originates from the high conductivity and the unique nanorods structure-exposed rich active sites [23,33]. Meanwhile, the improved electronic environment of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF enhances the adsorption of hydrogen-containing species and accelerates the HER [21,53]. At a high current density of 200 mA cm\u22122, MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF also exhibits superior HER catalytic activity, with an overpotential of 161.35 mV.

In addition, the electrocatalytic kinetics were investigated using electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics at the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface. Generally, a smaller Rct represents a higher electron-transfer velocity [30]. Typically, the semicircle diameter in Nyquist plots is positively correlated with the value of Rct, and the specific Rct value can be obtained through equivalent circuit fitting [56]. Nyquist plots for all the synthesized samples are shown in Figure 5d, wherein MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF shows the smallest semicircle diameter. The Rct values of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF, MoS2/Ni9S8/NF, MoZIF-67/NF, and S-ZIF-67/NF are determined as 2.30, 3.27, 8.72, and 23.93 \u2126, respectively.

These results demonstrate that the MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF comprising an amethyst-like rod structure can provide a large ECSA and expose abundant active sites.\nFigure 6. OER performances of the as-synthesized samples in 1 M KOH: (a) LSV curves, (b) overpotential at different current densities, (c) Tafel plots, and (d) Nyquist plots for the different samples.\nElectrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is a vital parameter for evaluating the performance of electrocatalysts [58]. T pically, the ECSA can be determi ed using the formula: ECSA = Cdl/CS, where (Cdl) is the double-layer capacitance and Cs is the specific capa it ce and is generally calculated by using 40.0 \u00b5F cm\u22122 [59]. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the as-prepared samples were measured across the potential range from \u22120.30 to \u22120.20 V (vs. g/HgO) t scanning speeds of 2 \u2013100 mV s\u22121. The CV curves of MoS2@Ni9 8/Co3S4/NF are shown in Figure 7a, whereas those of MoS2/Ni9S8/NF, ZI -67/NF, Mo-ZI -67/NF, and S-ZIF-67/NF are shown in Figure S3a\u2013d, respectiv ly. The Cdl can be obtained by fitting the relationship between half the curren density at \u22120.25 V and the scanning sp eds. The Cdl values of MoS2@Ni9S8/C 3S4/NF, MoS2/Ni9S8/NF, ZIF-67/ F, Mo-ZIF-67/NF, and S-ZIF-67/NF are determined to be 45.32, 17.85, 0.66, 1.54, and 1.68 mF cm\u22122 (Figure 7b), and the corresponding ECSAs are 1133.0, 446.3, 16.4, 38.5, and 42.0 cm2, respectively. Notably, the ECSA of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF is 2.5 and 69 times larger than those of MoS2/Ni9S8/NF and ZIF-67/NF, respectively. These results demonstrate that the MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF comprising an amethyst-like rod structure can provide a large ECSA and expose abundant active sites.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2302 10 of 14Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 14\nFigure 7. (a) CV curves of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF at different scan rates and (b) electrochemical double layer capacitance of the different as-synthesized samples. Performance of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF during the stability test: (c) HER-CP test at 10, 50, and 100 mA cm\u20132; (d) OER-CP test at 10 and 50 mA cm\u20132.\nTypically, ideal electrocatalysts must not only exhibit high HER and OER activities but also outstanding electrochemical stability. As shown in Figure 7c, during the chronopotentiometry (CP) test for the HER, the potentials of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF maintain a linear shape after 10, 50, and 100 mA cm\u22122 for 24 h, displaying excellent HER stability. Similarly, Figure 7d reveals the positive OER durability of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF. The 1000 CV cycles test further evaluated the stability of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF. As shown in Figure S4a, the LSV curves completely coincide before and after 1000 CV cycles for the HER, with almost no change in the overpotential. However, the overpotential of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF increases at the same current density for the OER after 1000 CV cycles (Figure S4b). Compared to that of the HER (Figure S5a), the SEM images reveal a more-pronounced degradation of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF morphology after 1000 CV cycles for the OER (Figure S5b), but the catalyst still attaches to the NF. The relatively weakened OER durability may be derived from the apparent degradation of MoS2@Ni9S8/Co3S4/NF morphology after 1000 CV cycles, which is due to the violent generation of bubbles during the OER process. Moreover, the samples after 1000 CV cycles were used for the XRD test. It can be seen that no other new diffraction peaks of samples appear after 1000 CV cycles (Figure S6). In the sample after 1000 CV cycles for the HER, the peaks at 31.3\u00b0, 37.9\u00b0, 40.2\u00b0, and 55.5\u00b0 correspond to the (222), (330), (114), and (530) crystal planes of Ni9S8 (PDF#221193), respectively. The peaks at 33.5\u00b0, 35.8\u00b0, and 60.1\u00b0 correspond to the (101), (102), and (008) crystal planes of MoS2 (PDF#37-1492), respectively.
