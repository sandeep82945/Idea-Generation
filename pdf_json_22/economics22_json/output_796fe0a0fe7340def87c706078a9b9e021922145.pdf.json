The implications of such principle are considered in the context of the aggregation of probabilistic opinions and of stochastic choice functions. In the former a bounded arbitrage principle and its equivalent form as an approximately Pareto condition are shown to bound the difference between the collective probabilistic assessment of a set of states and a linear aggregation rule on the individual assessments. In the latter we show that our general principle of limited arbitrage opportunities translates into a weakening of the McFadden\u2013Richter axiom of stochastic rationality, and gives an upper bound for the minimum distance of a stochastic choice function to another in the class of random utility maximization models.",

            "text": "In a series of papers, Nau (1992, 1995a, 1995b, 2015) and Nau and McCardle (1990, 1991) advocated the use of no arbitrage conditions as a unifying principle to characterize rational behavior. They have argued that the absence of arbitrage opportunities is not only a fundamental principle underlying the modern theory of asset pricing, but can also be used to characterize a variety of forms of rational behavior. Indeed, several expressions of rationality in economics, ranging from the axiomatic foundations of models of cardinal preferences to the correlated equilibrium outcomes in finite games, have an equivalent form as a no arbitrage condition.1\nIn this paper we show that a weaker principle of bounded arbitrage opportunities characterizes models of approximate rationality for the aggregation of probabilistic opinions and in the context of stochastic choice functions. Our results build on a minimum norm duality connecting the minimum distance between two sets of probability measures to the maximum gain from arbitrage with normalized stakes. Here the possibility of arbitrage denotes a sure gain when betting on a set of states, as in the Coherence Theorem of de Finetti.2 A consequence of our duality is that bounding the gains from arbitrage by a multiple of a positive number \u01eb gives rise to weaker forms of the postulates of collective rationality in the aggregation of probabilities problem, and to a weaker version of the Axiom of Revealed Stochastic Preference, henceforth ARSP, of McFadden and Richter (1990) in the context of stochastic choice.\nIn the two cases we obtain the representation of a probability measure P as the sum\nP = Qm + e. (1)\nHere Qm is a representation (a suitable linear aggregation of other measures) according to the canonical models of rational behavior. The term e stands for an error component whose length does not exceed \u01eb. Our characterization of nearly rational decision-making also includes a version of the two models having\nP = (1\u2212 \u01eb)Qm + \u01ebR, (2)\nwith Qm as before, and for some probability measure R. Like equation (1), the expression in (2) carries a similar interpretation as a deviation from the canonical forms of rationality\n1Recently, Beggs (2021) has also drawn a connection between the Nau-McCardle approach and the rationalization of expenditure data a\u0300 la Afriat. 2A weaker version of what is referred to as the Coherence Theorem in this paper was used in Nau and McCardle (1990, 1991) to illustrate the basic idea behind their results. Here we borrow the stronger version of the theorem as found, e.g., in Nielsen (2019, 2021). Details are given at the end of Section 3 below.\nand can be viewed as a version of the \u01eb-contamination model of Huber (1964). The standard versions of the two models correspond to the case where \u01eb = 0.\nOne such version refers to the aggregation of probabilistic assessments into a single probability measure. This is the linear opinion pool of Stone (1961), where the elements of a set Q are interpreted as the probabilistic assessments of the odds of a set of states by the members of a group, and the probability measure Qm in equations (1) and (2) is the linear averaging of the probabilities in Q with a weight vector m. The traditional approach to collective rational decision-making links the probabilities in Q to the probability P of a social planner by means of a Pareto unanimity condition.3 We show in this paper that weaker forms of the Pareto principle characterize the representations with positive \u01eb. Particularly, we characterize the version of an imprecise form of linear aggregation of probabilistic opinions as in (2), thereby handling the single-profile case of an aggregation rule due to Genest (1984).4\nWe also investigate in this paper an approximate version of the random utility maximization model of Block and Marschak (1960). The exact version of this model represents a stochastic choice function as a suitably defined linear averaging of deterministic choice functions. Each element of Q stands for a profile of choice probabilities induced by a single strict preference ordering. In this setting we give conditions ensuring that the answer to the canonical problem is perturbed proportionally to the extent of the deviation from the original condition that makes the choice probabilities in P a linear averaging of the choice probabilities in the Q \u2208 Q. Our condition for an expression resembling (1) is a modified version of ARSP.5 We also obtain a similar representation with an expression like equation (2) for a stochastic choice function along those same lines. This last variation of the model was recently proposed by Apesteguia and Ballester (2021), for whom the expression in (2) has the component Qm as the stochastic choice function in a certain class predicted by the theorist, while R represents unstructured randomness in the choice data that remains unexplained. Our contribution when compared to their paper is to axiomatically characterize their residual behavior representation when the class of stochastic choice functions the theorist wants to fit the data consists of the set of random utility maximization models.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the setting in which we work in this paper. Section 3 gives a general result about the proximity of the closed convex hull\n3See Mongin (1995) and the references therein. 4The original formulation of Genest (1984) uses the multi-profile setting of McConway (1981). For comparison, here we employ techniques that are different from those in Genest\u2019s paper to deal with the single-profile case. 5The relationship (that we explore in this paper) between the standard version of ARSP and the Coherence Theorem of de Finetti also appears in the work of Clark (1996).\nof two compact sets of probabilities in terms of expectations of certain functions, and relate it to the Coherence Theorem and the concept of arbitrage. In Section 4 we specialize our general setting in order to handle the two important applications already mentioned. While Section 5 concludes with some remarks and open problems about the questions addressed in this paper, all proofs are relegated to Appendix A."

            "text": "The set X is a compact metric space with metric dX . We denote by \u2206(X) the set of all Borel probability measures on X . That is, each element of \u2206(X) is a countably additive nonnegative measure on the Borel sets of X , and the measure of X is normalized to one.\nFor notation we write C(X) to represent the vector space of all continuous functions\nf : X \u2192 R. The vector space C(X) is endowed with the supremum norm \u2016f\u2016\u221e = supx\u2208X |f(x)| . In view of continuity of the elements of C(X) and compactness of X , the supremum can be replaced by a maximum in the definition of the norm above, as well as in the definition of the oscillation \u03c9(f) of a function f \u2208 C(X), namely,\n\u03c9(f) = sup x1,x2\u2208X [f(x1)\u2212 f(x2)].\nIt is also convenient to define the closed unit ball B\u2016\u00b7\u2016\u221e(0, 1) = {f \u2208 C(X) : \u2016f\u2016\u221e \u2264 1}.\nThe set ca(X) stands throughout for the vector space of all Borel signed measures of bounded variation on X . Note that \u2206(X) \u2286 ca(X). The set ca(X) is endowed with the topology of weak convergence. For the purposes of this paper it suffices to notice that this is the topology where a sequence (Rn) in ca(X) converges to R \u2208 ca(X) if, and only if,\nlim n\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nX\nf dRn =\n\u222b\nX\nf dR for all f \u2208 C(X).\nIn the topology of weak convergence, which we refer to as the weak* (or w\u2217, for short) topology, the set of probability measures \u2206(X) is compact.6 As a matter of notation, given R \u2286 ca(X), the set coR designates the smallest closed (in the weak* topology) and convex subset of ca(X) containing R. This will be referred to as the closed convex hull of R.\nIt is also known that the weak* topology on \u2206(X) can be metrized by the so-called\nKantorovich-Rubinstein metric dKR. This metric is given by\ndKR(P,Q) = sup f\u2208Lip1,\u2016f\u2016\u221e\u22641\n(\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) , (3)\n6For this and the assertions to follow referencing the space ca(X) and its underlying topology, see\nBogachev (2007, 2018).\nwhere\nLip1(X) = {f \u2208 R X : |f(x1)\u2212 f(x2)| \u2264 dX(x1, x2) for all x1, x2 \u2208 X}.\nIn the more conventional case where X is a finite set, the topological structures of C(X) and ca(X) coincide with that of a finite-dimensional Euclidean space equipped, respectively, with the maximum norm and the \u21131 norm. Otherwise, as is well known, when the set X is not finite there are in particular nonequivalent solutions, which are useful for different purposes, to the problem of giving a metric structure to the set of all probability measures on X .7 Here the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric is one of many forms of quantifying the distance between two probability measures. Another important metric on the set \u2206(X) is the one induced by the total variation norm \u2016\u00b7\u20161 on ca(X). Denoting by \u03a3X the collection of all Borel sets of X , recall that the total variation of a bounded signed measure R \u2208 ca(X) is\n\u2016R\u20161 = sup\n{ k\u2211\nn=1\n|R(En)| : (En) k n=1 is a partition of X, and En \u2208 \u03a3X\n} .\nThis norm induces a metric on \u2206(X) as usual:\nd1(P,Q) = \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161 . (4)\nAn alternative expression for the total variation of a signed measure, which reveals a connection between the metrics dKR and d1, is based on a Hahn decomposition (X+, X\u2212) of X . Namely, X+ and X\u2212 are disjoint Borel sets of X with X = X+ \u222a X\u2212 and such that R(X+) = supE\u2208\u03a3X R(E) and R(X\u2212) = infE\u2208\u03a3X R(E). Such a partition can be shown to exist and we have\n\u2016R\u20161 = R(X+)\u2212 R(X\u2212).\nHence we know that\nd1(P,Q) = sup f\u2208FX\n(\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) , (5)\nwhen FX is the set of all measurable f : X \u2192 R with norm at most one. For the purposes of this paper we shall assume that FX = B\u2016\u00b7\u2016\u221e(0, 1). Both choices of FX can be used interchangeably in (5).\nWe recall that in the special case where X is finite and endowed with the discrete metric, the total variation and the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance both have the same expression\nd1(P,Q) = dKR(P,Q) = \u2211\nx\u2208X\n|P (x)\u2212Q(x)| .\n7See Gibbs and Su (2002) for a survey and comparison of the many metrics on the set \u2206(X).\nThis is also known as the \u21131 distance. In general, as long as X is infinite and has at least one accumulation point, the metrics d1 and dKR induce different topologies on \u2206(X). Without further assumptions on the metric space X , we have\ndKR(P,Q) \u2264 d1(P,Q) (6)\nfor all P,Q \u2208 \u2206(X). The inequality in (6) reveals, in particular, that any pair of probability measures that are \u01eb-close according to the total variation distance are also \u01eb-close in the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric.8\nIn any case, unless stated otherwise, topological properties of subsets of signed measures of bounded variation on a compact metric space and the convergence of sequences of measures refer to the topology of weak convergence, and not to the notion of distance mentioned in equation (4). Our use of the \u21131 distance will be restricted to quantifying the length of the error term in the representations of the form expressed in (1)."

            "text": "To introduce our general result regarding a minimum distance duality for compact sets of probability measures, it is convenient to first provide an expression to the closure of the convex hull of such sets in terms of probability measures on them. In the next proposition we characterize the closed convex hull of a weak*-compact subset of \u2206(X) as the set of all probability measures on X that can be expressed as the expectation of the probabilities in that set according to some second-order probability measure. It is essentially a simple version of Choquet\u2019s theorem; see Phelps (2001).\nProposition 1. Suppose that R is a weak*-compact set of Borel probabilities measures on the compact metric space X. Given any m \u2208 \u2206(R), denote by Rm the element of \u2206(X) defined by\nRm(E) =\n\u222b\nR\nR(E) dm for all Borel sets E \u2286 X. (7)\nThen coR = {Rm \u2208 \u2206(X) : m \u2208 \u2206(R)}.\nThe next theorem is our minimum distance duality for the total variation distance. With the same notation as in (7), the theorem characterizes the value of the problem of minimizing\n8The converse implication is false as long as the metric space (X, dX) has a countably infinite subset with an accumulation point for the same reason that in this case the topology induced by the \u21131 norm and the topology of weak convergence are not the same. We return to this distinction in Example 1 in the next section.\n\u2225\u2225PmP \u2212QmQ \u2225\u2225 1 over (mP , mQ) \u2208 \u2206(P)\u00d7\u2206(Q), for compact sets P and Q of probabilities, with reference to the disagreement about the expected value of normalized continuous functions on X between the P \u2208 P and the Q \u2208 Q.\nTheorem 1. Let P and Q denote weak*-compact sets of probability measures on the compact metric space X. Then\nmin P\u2208 coP,Q\u2208 coQ \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161 = sup f\u2208C(X),\u2016f\u2016\u221e\u22641 min P\u2208P,Q\u2208Q\n(\u222b\nX\nfdP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nfdQ ) . (8)\nA version of the theorem above appears in Luenberger (1997, p.136) exploring a different but related form of duality in order to bound the distance between two sets of continuous functions under the supremum norm. Such a form is known as the Nirenberg\u2013Luenberger mininum distance duality. In contrast, our Theorem 1 uses the relation between the set of signed measures on the compact metric space X and the continuous linear functionals on C(X) in order to prove a duality result involving two sets of probability measures endowed with the topology of weak convergence. By interpreting the minimum difference \u222b X f dP \u2212\u222b\nX f dQ as the disagreement or discrepancy of the assessment of the expected value of f , Theorem 1 essentially says that the total variation distance between two closed and convex subsets of \u2206(X) is the maximum discrepancy of the assessments of expectations of certain continuous functions with respect to the probabilities in those sets. Geometrically, by viewing\nmin P\u2208 coP,Q\u2208 coQ\n(\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) = min\nP\u2208 coP\n\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212 max Q\u2208 coQ\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ\nas a scalar multiple of the distance between two parallel hyperplanes supporting, respectively, the sets coP and coQ, the minimum distance between the two sets corresponds to the maximal separation. This notion is discussed at length in Dax (2006) in a finite-dimensional setting, and our Theorem 1 becomes a special case of Theorem 13 in Dax\u2019s paper when X is finite. However, the strategy of proof of that Theorem 13 relies on the compactness of the closed unit ball in finite-dimensional normed spaces, which no longer holds in the context of C(X) with an infinite set X . To derive the expression in (8) we use the characterization of the total variation distance in (5) combined with a version of the minimax theorem due to Kneser (1952).\nRegarding the optimization problem in (8), it is not difficult to check that Theorem 1 above implies that for any two compact sets of probabilities, P and Q, there are probability measures mP \u2208 \u2206(P) and mQ \u2208 \u2206(Q) such that\nd1(PmP , QmQ) = sup f\u2208C(X),\u2016f\u2016\u221e=1 min P\u2208P,Q\u2208Q\n(\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) .\nThe identity in (8) is also particularly valuable because it allows us to interchange the roles of maximum and minimum in the original minimization problem. In many concrete cases arising in connection with the dualities presented in Dax and Sreedharan (1997) the expression for the minimum norm can be substantially simplified if we first calculate the minimum of the linear mapping induced by f \u2208 C(X) in (8). In fact, an immediate corollary of Theorem 1 is the following version of an approximate theorem of the alternative.\nCorollary 1. Let P and Q be as in Theorem 1, and \u01eb > 0 be given. Then either I. \u222b X f dP \u2212 \u222b X f dQ > \u01eb for all P \u2208 P and Q \u2208 Q has a solution f \u2208 C(X) with \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1,\nor\nII. d1(P,Q) \u2264 \u01eb has a solution (P,Q) \u2208 coP \u00d7 coQ,\nbut never both.\nCorollary 1 can be interpreted as an approximate version of Gordan\u2019s Theorem of the Alternative for probabilities. It says that either there is a strong disagreement of the expectations of normalized continuous functions on the set X , or else the closed convex hull of the two sets of probabilities are sufficiently close in the total variation metric of a pair of elements in those sets. For comparison, Gordan\u2019s theorem asserts that either there is some disagreement about the expectation of some f \u2208 C(X) according to the measures in P and Q in the sense that\nmin P\u2208P\n\u222b\nX\nf dP > max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ, (9)\nor else the sets coP and coQ have a nonempty intersection. This contrast becomes transparent in a finite-dimensional setting after a close inspection of the fourth column of Table 1 in Dax and Sreedharan (1997), which covers the case where X is finite, P is a singleton, and Q is the convex hull of a finite set. It should be also noted that the normalization \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1 cannot be omitted from system I in Corollary 1 since the inequality in (9) is equivalent to the inequality minP\u2208P \u222b X f dP \u2212maxQ\u2208Q \u222b X f dQ > \u01eb for all f \u2208 C(X) with arbitrarily large norm.\nWe also mention that the use of the total variation distance in Corollary 1 can be sometimes too restrictive, so the previous corollary to our general result comes at a cost in some circumstances. We illustrate this point with the next example.\nExample 1. Consider a collection of approximate systems of the alternative as in Corollary 1, where each system is indexed by n. For\nX = {0} \u222a\n{ 1\nk : k \u2208 N\n}\nthat remains fixed and is viewed as a subset of the real line with the standard topology, in the n-th system we have the sets of degenerate measures \u03b4x:\nPn = {\u03b40} and Qn = { \u03b4 1\nk\n: k = 1, . . . , n } .\nIt is not difficult to verify that in system n we have\nmin P\u2208coPn,Q\u2208coQn \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161 = 2,\neven though as n gets larger the degenerate probability \u03b4 1 n intuitively gets closer to \u03b40 \u2208 Qn once we take into account the standard metric structure of X.9 Hence, given any \u01eb \u2208 (0, 2), for every n there exists a normalized continuous function fn such that fn(0) > fn ( 1 k ) + \u01eb for all k = 1, . . . , n. Such functions are not difficult to construct. It is also not difficult to notice that for n \u2265 1 \u01eb they cannot be Lipschitz continuous with the Lipschitz constant equal to 1. In view of the definition of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric in (3), obviously either In. \u222b X f dP \u2212 \u222b X f dQ > \u01eb for all P \u2208 Pn and Q \u2208 Qn has a solution f \u2208 Lip1(X) with\n\u2016f\u2016\u221e \u2264 1 ,\nor\nIIn. dKR(P,Q) \u2264 \u01eb has a solution (P,Q) \u2208 coPn \u00d7 coQn,\nbut never both. Therefore, given any \u01eb > 0, for all n sufficiently large, system In does not admit a solution and system IIn has a solution, in contrast with the behavior of the related systems under the \u21131 metric.\nWe also provide an equivalent characterization to the existence of a solution to system\nII in Corollary 1 that will be useful in the sequel.\nCorollary 2. Let P and Q be as in Theorem 1. There exists (P,Q) \u2208 coP \u00d7 coQ such that d1(P,Q) \u2264 \u01eb if, and only if, for all f \u2208 C(X) with \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1,\nmin P\u2208P\n\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2264 max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ+ \u01eb. (10)\nCorollary 2 essentially says that, in order to exist P \u2208 coP and Q \u2208 coQ such that P = Q + e for some error term e \u2208 ca(X) with \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb, the inequality in (10) must hold for any continuous and normalized function f . Geometrically, it says that any continuous linear functional of unit norm on the space ca(X) cannot separate in excess of \u01eb the compact\n9This is indeed a consequence of the weak convergence of the sequence of degenerate measures \u03b4 1 n to \u03b40.\nand convex sets coP and coQ. By applying a separating hyperplane type of argument it can be also shown that an almost identical inequality (except for a multiplicative term) can be used to characterize, given \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1) and a weak* compact and convex set R \u2286 \u2206(X), the existence of probabilities P \u2208 coP, Q \u2208 coQ and R \u2208 R such that P is the convex combination of Q and R with weights 1 \u2212 \u01eb and \u01eb, respectively. This is done in the next proposition.\nProposition 2. Let P and Q be as in Theorem 1, and \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose that R is a weak* closed and convex subset of \u2206(X). There exist probability measures P \u2208 coP, Q \u2208 coQ and R \u2208 R such that\nP = (1\u2212 \u01eb)Q + \u01ebR (11)\nif, and only if, for all f \u2208 C(X) with f(x) \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 X and \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1 we have that\nmin P\u2208P\n\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2264 (1\u2212 \u01eb)max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ+ \u01ebmax R\u2208R\n\u222b\nX\nf dR. (12)\nRemark 1. The conditions in (10) and (11) have equivalent forms as, respectively,\nmax P\u2208P\n\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2265 min Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ\u2212 \u01eb. (13)\nand\nmax P\u2208P\n\u222b\nX\nf dP \u2265 (1\u2212 \u01eb)min Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ+ \u01ebmin R\u2208R\n\u222b\nX\nf dR.\nThese are easily verified.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the expressions in (10) and (12) can both be interpreted as bounding the gains from arbitrage with normalized stakes. For concreteness we restrict attention to (10) in its equivalent form as (13), and consider a version of the Coherence Theorem of de Finetti as follows.\nAssume that X has M elements and the only element P of P represents the prices of M bets, and is thus a vector in RM . Each x \u2208 X corresponds to a gamble that the individual is willing to bet on. In state i = 1, . . . , N , the bet x pays the amount Qi(x). We therefore write Qi to represent the profile of payments in state i of each of those M bets. Note that Q = {Q1, . . . , QN} is a subset of R M . If the choice of stakes on each bet x is given by f(x), then the individual receives the amount\n\u2211\nx\u2208X\nf(x)[Qi(x)\u2212 P (x)] (14)\nin state i. De Finetti\u2019s Coherence Theorem can be phrased as saying that either there is a choice of stakes f \u2208 RM with maxx\u2208X |f(x)| = 1 giving a sure gain (i.e., an arbitrage opportunity), meaning that the quantity in (14) is positive for all i, or else there exists a probability measurem on the set of states so that the price P (x) of each gamble x corresponds to its expected value \u2211N\ni=1miQi(x).\nAccording to our Theorem 1, if instead of restricting the sign of the expression in (14)\nwe assume that\nmin i\n\u2211\nx\u2208X\nf(x)Qi(x)\u2212 \u2211\nx\u2208X\nf(x)P (x) \u2264 \u01eb (15)\nfor all f with \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1, then we know that for some m in the simplex of dimension N \u2212 1 we have\nP = N\u2211\ni=1\nmiQi + e (16)\nwhere \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb. 10 The condition in (15) means that (sure) gains from arbitrage obtained with normalized stakes are restricted to the interval [0, \u01eb]. Equation (16) in its turn entails that no arbitrage principles like de Finetti\u2019s are stable. By stability we mean that when we allow for small gains from arbitrage we obtain a representation that resembles the original one except perhaps for a small error that is proportional to the small gains from arbitrage. The results to follow building on Theorem 1 carry a similar interpretation. Since we use probabilities as primitives in this paper, we interpret conditions such as (15) in terms of expectations of normalized functions (or payoffs) f with respect to P and the probabilities in Q. Hence we read (15) like the inequality in (13): for no normalized function its expected value according to P is less than an \u01eb of the minimum expectation evaluated with the probabilities in Q."

An element Q ofQ is to be interpreted as the probabilistic likelihood assessment of a member of the group of individuals about the events in \u03a3X . Depending on the application, these members can be viewed either as members of the society, or as experts or specialists.11\nOur first characterization of the case where the probability P is sufficiently close to an element of the closed convex hull of the set Q relies on a condition that resembles the no arbitrage assumption in de Finetti\u2019s Coherence Theorem. Two equivalent versions of such condition guarantee that P is nearly represented as the linear average of the elements of Q. This is our next proposition.\nProposition 3. Suppose that P = {P} \u2286 \u2206(X), and let Q be a nonempty and weak* compact subset of \u2206(X). Let \u01eb > 0.

For interpretation, if the continuous function f in item (i) of Proposition 3 represents the payoffs contingent on the states, and each probability Q \u2208 Q encodes the opinion of an expert or better informed party about the odds of the states, the assertion in item (i) linking the elements of Q to P says that, except perhaps for a small error \u01eb, the expected value of the normalized payoff vector f according to P cannot exceed the maximum expected payoff according to the opinions of the members of the group. Item (ii) can be interpreted similarly.\nRegarding the limiting cases of Proposition 3, note first that the relevant range for the number \u01eb is the interval (0, 2). For concreteness, for any fixed Q \u2208 Q, we can write P = Q+e, where e = P\u2212Q has norm \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 2. At the same time, the assertion in item (i) in Proposition 3 trivially holds for any \u01eb \u2265 2 since \u222b\nX\nf dP \u2212\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ \u2264 \u2016f\u2016\u221e \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161 \u2264 2\n11Compactness of the set Q can be justified when, for instance, the individuals in the group are indexed by i \u2208 I, with I denoting a compact metric space such as a finite set or the closed unit interval, and a continuous mapping i 7\u2192 Qi associates to each individual in the group her or his assessment of the odds of the states.\nfor any Q \u2208 Q. And for values of \u01eb close to 0, Proposition 3 has as a straightforward corollary the standard condition for linear aggregation of probabilities with reference to de Finneti\u2019s notion of coherence. This is the same as the condition in item (i) of Proposition 3 with \u01eb = 0, which is certainly equivalent to the mentioned item for all \u01eb > 0 arbitrarily small. In fact, set \u01eb = 1 n for n \u2208 N, and find a sequence (mn) of measures in \u2206(Q) such that d1(P,Qmn) \u2264 1 n . By a standard compactness argument involving the weak\u2217 topology and the lower semicontinuity of the \u21131 norm, we can find m \u2208 \u2206(Q) such that P = Qm. More in general, our condition with 0 < \u01eb < 2 is compatible with mild violations of coherence.12\nWe also characterize below the almost linear aggregation rule in (17) with a version of\nthe standard Pareto unanimity condition. This is defined next.\nDefinition 1 (Condition C\u01eb). Let \u01eb \u2265 0. We say that P \u2208 \u2206(X) and Q \u2286 \u2206(X) satisfy the condition C\u01eb when for all f, g \u2208 C(X): if \u222b X f dQ \u2265 \u222b X g dQ for all Q \u2208 Q then\u222b\nX f dP \u2265 \u222b X g dP \u2212 \u01eb\u00b7\u03c9(f\u2212g) 2 .\nCondition C\u01eb reduces to the standard notion of Pareto unanimity about the ranking of the payoff vectors f and g if \u01eb = 0. Our notion of approximately Pareto unanimity for a positive \u01eb has a correction factor of \u03c9(f\u2212g) 2 in order to account for scaling effects. For instance, if we omit the oscillation of the difference f \u2212 g from the last inequality in Definition 1 its assertion would coincide with the standard form of Pareto unanimity.13\nMore important, while the original Pareto condition with \u01eb = 0 would conclude with the optimality of f when choosing from the set {f, g}, Definition 1 is less demanding and requires that f be nearly optimal when compared with g. This weaker requirement of approximate optimality is justified, for instance, as long as the decision maker with assessment P of the probability of the events is uncertain about the true opinions of the members of the group, and leaves some room for probabilities that could have been omitted from the set Q and would weigh in favor of g. For payoff vectors f and g that are sufficiently close, meaning that \u2016f \u2212 g\u2016\u221e \u2264 1, a consequence of condition C\u01eb is that for the decision maker f is an \u01eb-optimal choice from the set {f, g} in the sense of Radner (1980) since in this case we also have \u222b X f dP \u2265 \u222b X g dP \u2212 \u01eb. Somewhat similar to the justification given in Radner (1980) for such a notion of near optimality, the parameter \u01eb could reflect the difficulty the decision maker faces when gauging the preferences of the group, and is thus associated with the costs of discovering the optimal choices based on the opinions of the members of the group.\n12To illustrate this remark, consider Example 2 in Nielsen (2019), where X = {1, 2, 3}, P = ( 1\n3 , 1 3 , 1 3\n) ,\nand Q = {Q1, Q2}, with Q1 = ( 2 3 , 1 3 , 0 ) and Q2 = ( 1 3 , 2 3 , 0 ) . This example reveals a violation of coherence but, as is easily verified, it is compatible with the relation in (17) when \u01eb \u2265 2 3 .\n13To see this, just multiply each of the functions f and g by n \u2208 N, and take the limit in the resulting\ninequalities divided by n as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThe next proposition characterizes the aggregation by nearly averaging with the weaker\nnotion of Pareto unanimity just described.\nProposition 4. Suppose that P, Q and \u01eb are as in the statement of Proposition 3. There exist e \u2208 ca(X) and m \u2208 \u2206(Q) such that the relation in (17) holds if, and only if, P and Q satisfy condition C\u01eb.\nTo illustrate the empirical content of Proposition 4 we consider in the next example the\naggregation of priors in an Anscombe-Aumann setting with state independent utilities.\nExample 2. Each individual i = 1, . . . , N in the group has preferences <i over the Cartesian product CM , where C is a nonempty convex subset of a vector space, and M is a positive integer. The set C represents the set of consequences. We identify CM with the set of all mappings from the M-element set X to C, and thus interpret X as a set of objective states and CM as the set of Anscombe-Aumann acts. Preferences of the individuals, <i, and of the decision maker, <0, satisfy the usual Anscombe-Aumann axioms. We assume further that preferences over consequences are the same among the individuals and the decision maker, so we let them be expressed by a non-constant and affine function u : C \u2192 R where u(c0) = 0 for some consequence c0. We also view c0 as the constant act with consequence c0 in each state. Therefore, there are priors P of the decision maker, and Qi of the members of the group such that the preference relation <0 over acts c is represented by c 7\u2192 \u2211 x\u2208X P (x)u(c(x)),\nwhereas <i is represented by c 7\u2192 \u2211 x\u2208X Qi(x)u(c(x)). In this setting, the Pareto condition ensuring that P is nearly the weighted average of the probabilities Qi says that, if c <i c0 for all i = 1, . . . , N , then 2 2+\u01eb c+ \u01eb 2+\u01eb c\u2217 <0 2 2+\u01eb c0 + \u01eb 2+\u01eb c\u2217, where c \u2217 is the best consequence in the act c, and c\u2217 represents the worst consequence in c.\nIn connection with the results in Section 3, we now give a single-profile version of an aggregation rule proposed by Genest (1984).14 It consists of expressing P as the convex combination of a linear averaging of the probabilities in Q and an extraneous probability measure R \u2208 \u2206(X). That is,\nP (E) = (1\u2212 \u01eb)Qm(E) + \u01ebR(E) for all E \u2208 \u03a3X , (18)\nfor some m \u2208 \u2206(Q), and 0 \u2264 \u01eb \u2264 1. The limiting case \u01eb = 0 corresponds to the standard linear pool of opinions, whereas the case \u01eb = 1 posits no relation between the probability of\n14As mentioned in footnote 4, Genest\u2019s (1984) result appeared in the context of extending a result of McConway (1981), who characterized the linear pool of opinions in a multi-profile setting with two properties. The omission of one of these conditions, the so-called zero-probability property, leads to the aggregation rule of Genest in the original setting.\nthe decision maker and the opinions of the members of the group. In general, the expression in (18) for \u01eb \u2208 [0, 1] is characterized by the following version of the Pareto condition given in Definition 1.\nDefinition 2 (Condition C\u2217\u01eb). Let \u01eb \u2265 0. We say that P \u2208 \u2206(X) and Q \u2286 \u2206(X) satisfy\nthe condition C\u2217\u01eb when for all f, g \u2208 C(X): if \u222b X f dQ \u2265 \u222b X g dQ for all Q \u2208 Q then\u222b\nX f dP \u2265 \u222b X g dP \u2212 \u01eb[\u03c9(f \u2212 g)\u2212maxx\u2208X(f(x)\u2212 g(x))].\nA few remarks are in now order. Like condition C\u01eb, the version of Pareto unanimity given in Definition 2 says that, except perhaps for a term depending on \u01eb, the unanimous comparison of expected values of payoff vectors f and g according to the elements of Q is followed by the comparison of those payoffs according to P . But in contrast to the modified Pareto condition in Definition 1, we have a different form for the new term when comparing expected values. Moreover, since we cannot have maxx\u2208X(f(x)\u2212 g(x)) < 0 in Definition 2, for otherwise \u222b X f dQ < \u222b X g dQ, we see that condition C\u2217\u01eb implies condition C2\u01eb. This is not surprising since any probability measure P expressed as in (18) can be also written as the sum Qm + e, where e = \u01eb(R\u2212Qm) has norm no greater than 2\u01eb.\nThe next proposition characterizes the aggregation rule a\u0300 la Genest with our new version\nof Pareto unanimity.\nProposition 5. Suppose that P andQ are as in the statement of Proposition 3. Let \u01eb \u2208 [0, 1]. There exist R \u2208 \u2206(X) such that the relation in (18) holds if, and only if, P and Q satisfy condition C\u2217\u01eb .\nAs a special case of our first aggregation result for probabilities, we also consider P and the elements of Q arising as subjective probabilities in the setting of Savage (1954). Here P and each Q \u2208 Q are nonatomic.15 We also assume that Q is a finite set of size N . According to a result due to Mongin (1995), a condition that is viewed as a form of consistency between P and the set {Q1, . . . , QN} when comparing the relative likelihood of events is both necessary and sufficient for P to be the linear pooling of the Qi\u2019s. The probabilistic analogue of our modified Pareto condition can be defined as follows.\nDefinition 3 (Condition CM\u01eb ). Let \u01eb \u2265 0. We say that P \u2208 \u2206(X) and {Q1, . . . , QN} \u2286 \u2206(X) satisfy the condition CM\u01eb when for all E1, E2 \u2208 \u03a3X : if Qi(E1) \u2265 Qi(E2) for all i = 1, . . . , N , then P (E1) \u2265 P (E2)\u2212 \u01eb.\n15Recall that a probability measure R \u2208 \u2206(X) is nonatomic if for all E1 \u2208 \u03a3X with R(E1) > 0 there\nexists E2 \u2208 \u03a3X such that 0 < R(E2) < R(E1).\nOur condition CM\u01eb for the case \u01eb = 0 coincides with the consistency condition C1 in Mongin (1995). This case is the analogue of Pareto unanimity when comparing the probability of events, or equivalently when accessing the optimality of binary bets. These are the bets on events in \u03a3X with a payoff of one if the event obtains, and zero otherwise. More precisely, when compared with condition C\u01eb under the assumption that \u01eb = 0, condition C M \u01eb also has an interpretation in terms of bets: replace the set C(X) in Definition 1 with the set of all indicator functions of (Borel) measurable subsets of X . Hence, as long as each probability in Q ranks a bet on E1 above a bet on E2, Definition 3 says that according to P the bet on E1 is also ranked above the bet on E2. The novelty in Definition 3 with \u01eb > 0 is to allow some room for the bet on E1 to be worse than the bet on E2 with respect to their expected values. But we require P (E1) to be in the closed interval [P (E2)\u2212 \u01eb, P (E2)], so the bet on E1 cannot be too inferior when compared with the other bet.\nThe next proposition characterizes an almost linear aggregation of probabilities in the\ncase of nonatomic measures.\nProposition 6. Suppose that P, Q and \u01eb are as in the statement of Proposition 3. Assume further that Q has size N , and that P as well as the elements of Q are nonatomic. There exist e \u2208 ca(X) and mi \u2265 0, for all i = 1, . . . , N , such that P = \u2211N i=1miQi + e, with \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb, if, and only if, P and Q satisfy condition C M \u01eb .\nOur Proposition 6 is an extension of part of Proposition 2 in Mongin (1995). It differs from Mongin\u2019s result in two aspects. First, we assume from the outset that all the probabilities involved are nonatomic, whereas Proposition 2 in Mongin (1995) only requires that the elements of Q be nonatomic. Second, whereas Mongin (1995) obtains the exact relation P = \u2211N\ni=1miQi for a list of nonnegative Pareto weights mi whose sum is one, the expression\nfor P in our Proposition 6 only entails that 1 \u2212 \u01eb \u2264 \u2211N\ni=1mi \u2264 1 + \u01eb. 16 In spite of their\ndifferences, it is not difficult to see that we can recover Mongin\u2019s result as a limiting case when \u01eb goes to zero.17\nFinally, we can give a sharper version of Proposition 6 with the more general conditions for aggregation mentioned in Section 3. Our next proposition characterizes a nearly linear aggregation rule for nonatomic measures with normalized Pareto weights using conditions that are similar to those in Proposition 3.\n16At this time we are also unaware of an example of a representation as in Proposition 6 never holding\nwith \u2211N\ni=1 mi = 1. 17Take \u01eb = 1\nn and find a sequence of nonnegative and bounded Pareto weights (mn) in which the rep-\nresentation holds accordingly for each n. In the limit, P (E) = limn\u2192\u221e \u2211N i=1 mn,iQi(E) + en(E), where \u2016en\u20161 \u2264 1 n , after passing to a convergent subsequence of (mn) if needed.\nProposition 7. Suppose that P, Q and \u01eb are as in the statement of Proposition 6. There exist e \u2208 ca(X) and mi \u2265 0, for all i = 1, . . . , N , with \u2211N\ni=1mi = 1 such that P =\u2211N i=1miQi+e, where \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb, if, and only if, any of the following two equivalent conditions is satisfied.\n(i) For all E \u2208 \u03a3X , P (E) \u2264 maxi Qi(E) + \u01eb 2 .\n(ii) For all E \u2208 \u03a3X , P (E) \u2265 mini Qi(E)\u2212 \u01eb 2 ."

            "text": "In the case of a finite set X the results obtained in Section 3 can be given the interpretation of representing a stochastic choice function as if it were nearly generated by the random utility maximization model of Block and Marschak (1960). This is done here by a suitable definition of the set X , and of the elements of P and Q.\nThe setting consists of a grand set Y of alternatives of size N0, and a family D of subsets of Y . This family represents the choice problems the individual may choose from, and is composed of all nonempty subsets of Y .18 A stochastic choice function is a mapping P0 : D \u2192 R such that\nP0(y, Y ) \u2265 0, \u2211\ny\u2208Y\nP0(y, Y ) = 1, for all Y \u2208 D.\nDenote by L the set of all strict preference orderings on Y , namely, all those relations \u227b\u2286 Y \u00d7 Y that are irreflexive, transitive and satisfy the property that for any two distinct elements y and y\u2032 of Y either y \u227b y\u2032 or y\u2032 \u227b y. Let M = N0 \u00b7 2 N0\u22121, and N = N0!. Define the M \u00d7N matrix A so that each row a(y, Y ) has in its column corresponding to \u227b\u2208 L the value\na\u227b(y, Y ) =    1, if \u227b\u2208 S(y, Y )\n0, otherwise,\nwhere S(y, Y ) = {\u227b\u2208 L : y\u2032 \u227b y for no y\u2032 \u2208 Y } is the set of all strict preferences supporting the optimality of y in Y .\nThe class of all stochastic choice functions that follow the random utility maximization model is the convex hull of the columns of A, which is known as the multiple choice polytope. To describe our approximate version of the model, we rephrase the problem in terms of two\n18The assumption that D = 2Y \\ {\u2205} is inessential and can be easily relaxed. We keep it for simplicity.\nsets of probabilities as in Section 3. Let X = {(y, Y ) : Y \u2208 D, y \u2208 Y }. The set X has M elements and is thus a compact metric space. It is convenient to have X enumerated as\nX = {(y1, Y1), (y2, Y2), . . . , (yM , YM)}. (19)\nDefine P \u2208 \u2206(X) by P (y, Y ) = P0(y,Y ) 2N0\u22121 , and for each \u227b\u2208 L the probability measure Q\u227b on X by Q\u227b(y, Y ) = a\u227b(y,Y )\n2N0\u22121 . The probability P can be viewed as an extended lottery where\nP (y, Y ) represents the joint probability of facing the choice problem Y and choosing the alternative y \u2208 Y from it. A similar interpretation applies to Q\u227b.\nThe stochastic choice function P0 belongs to the multiple choice polytope if, and only if, the sets P = {P} and the convex hull of the finite set Q = {Q\u227b \u2208 \u2206(X) :\u227b\u2208 L} intersect. This the same as saying that, for some \u03c0 \u2208 \u2206(L),\nP0 = A\u03c0. (20)\nThe probability measure \u03c0 is referred to as a stochastic preference for the obvious reasons.\nMcFadden and Richter (1990) characterize such an intersection with ARSP. We will show that, more in general, a modification of ARSP characterizes when the system of choice probabilities is \u01eb-close to the multiple choice polytope, and instead of the expression in (20), we have\nP0 = A\u03c0 + e (21)\nfor some vector e \u2208 RM with \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb. With reference to P and Q, the expression in (21) means that d1(P,Q\u03c0) \u2264 \u01eb\n2N0\u22121 for some Q\u03c0 = \u2211 \u227b\u2208L \u03c0(\u227b)Q\u227b \u2208 coQ.\nThe next example, borrowed from McFadden and Richter (1990), illustrates the repre-\nsentation in (21).\nExample 3. Consider Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4}, and a stochastic choice function P0 where alternatives have an equal probability of being chosen in choice problems of sizes 1, 2 and 4. For choice problems of size 3, the alternative ymin with the smallest index has a slightly better chance of being chosen. Denoting by |Y | the number of elements of Y ,\nP0(y, Y ) =    1 |Y | , if |Y | \u2208 {1, 2, 4} 4 10 , if |Y | = 3, y = ymin\n3 10 , otherwise.\nThis stochastic choice function cannot be rationalized as random utility maximization (see McFadden and Richter (1990) for the calculations). At the same time, it is not too far from\na stochastic function P\u03030 where choices are equally likely in any choice problem. In particular,\nP0(y, Y ) =    P\u03030(y, Y )\u2212 1 15 , if y = ymin\nP\u03030(y, Y ) + 1 30 , otherwise\nfor a 3-element set Y . Hence P0 can be represented as in (21) when \u01eb = 8 15 . It is much less obvious, though, that P0 can also be expressed as in (21) with \u01eb = 1 10 . This bound is achieved\nwhen P\u03030(y, Y ) = \u2211 \u227b\u2208S(y,Y ) \u03c0\u0303(\u227b), with \u03c0\u0303 suitably chosen. 19\nBefore proceeding we need a few definitions.\nDefinition 4. Given the enumeration of X in (19), a tagged trial sequence T is a sequence of finite and fixed length M of the form\nT = ((y1, Y1, t1), (y2, Y2, t2), . . . , (yM , YM , tM)),\nwhere the ti are nonnegative integers. The width wT of a tagged trial sequence is the number maxi ti \u2212mini ti.\nIn the original definition of McFadden and Richter (1990) and McFadden (2005), a trial sequence makes reference to a finite list of pairs (y, Y ) \u2208 X where repetitions are allowed. To keep track of the greatest and the least number of repetitions in a trial sequence, we use the ti that are mentioned in our definition of a tagged trial sequence. 20 In any case, a tagged trial sequence can be interpreted as a vector of payoffs attaching to each (yi, Yi) \u2208 X a nonnegative integer ti. The expected payoff according to the probability P on X is the value \u2211M\ni=1 P (yi, Yi)ti. Likewise, each element Q\u227b of Q also induces an expected value,\nwhich is associated with a column of A. In its original version in McFadden and Richter (1990), ARSP says that the expected payoff according to P of any tagged trial sequence cannot exceed the maximum expected payoff computed with probabilities on X induced by non-stochastic choice functions. That is,\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP (yi, Yi)ti \u2264 max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\nQ\u227b(yi, Yi)ti. (22)\n19A particular choice of a stochastic preference has \u03c0\u0303(yi \u227b yj \u227b yk \u227b yl) = 1 20 when\nijkl = 1342, 2341, 3124, 3142, 3241, 4123, 4132, 4231, 4321, \u03c0\u0303(yi \u227b yj \u227b yk \u227b yl) = 2 20 when ijkl = 1432, 2143, 2431, 3421, and \u03c0\u0303(y1 \u227b y2 \u227b y3 \u227b y4) = 3\n20 . This fact can be verified with the linear program\nmentioned in the last paragraph of Section 5 below. 20Technically, like in Section 4.1, we need to make reference to the oscillation of certain functions in order to characterize the inexact form of aggregation. This is achieved by keeping track of the maximum and minimum number of repetitions using the tags.\nThis is the next definition, where we use the original stochastic choice function instead of P , and the matrix A in place of the set Q.21\nDefinition 5 (ARSP). The stochastic choice function P0 satisfies ARSP if, for every tagged trial sequence T ,\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)ti \u2264 max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti. (23)\nOur version of ARSP, which we will refer to as \u01eb-ARSP, is a weakening of the condition in (23). In terms of the probabilities over pairs (y, Y ), it consists of adjusting the right-hand side of (22) in order to accommodate deviations from the original inequality. This is similar to what is done in Corollary 2 in Section 3.\nDefinition 6 (\u01eb-ARSP). Let \u01eb \u2265 0. The stochastic choice function P0 satisfies \u01eb-ARSP if, for every tagged trial sequence T ,\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)ti \u2264 max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti + wT \u01eb\n2 . (24)\nIn practice, \u01eb-ARSP is a weakening of ARSP that accommodates examples of stochastic functions that are nearly rationalizable by random utility maximization as in Example 3. We note, though, as an illustration of the content of such an axiom, that for \u01eb < 2 it has the same implication as ARSP for non-stochastic single-valued choice functions with respect to the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference. This observation follows from the next example.22\nExample 4. Suppose that a deterministic choice function dictates that y1 is chosen from Y1, and y2 \u2208 Y1. If the weak axiom fails, for some Y2 also containing y1 we have y2 as the choice from it. Now consider the tagged trial sequence T where, with a slight abuse of notation, t(y1, Y1) = t(y2, Y2) = 1, and t(y, Y ) = 0 otherwise. Since each \u227b\u2208 L is transitive and irreflexive, we cannot have a\u227b(y1, Y1) = a\u227b(y2, Y2) = 1. Hence, using \u01eb-ARSP we get that\n2 = \u2211\n(y,Y )\u2208X\nP0(y, Y )t(y, Y ) \u2264 max \u227b\u2208L\n\u2211\n(y,Y )\u2208X\na\u227b(y, Y )t(y, Y ) + \u01eb\n2 < 2,\nwhich is impossible.\n21See Border (2007) and the references therein for a discussion of ARSP. 22The example can be easily extended to the more general case in which the set D of choice problems is not comprehensive, whereby the choice function satisfies the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference. By the strong axiom we mean that the revealed (strict) preference relation is acyclic. See McFadden and Richter (1990, pp. 162-165).\nWe can now state the first characterization of an approximate version of the random\nutility maximization model.\nProposition 8. The stochastic choice function P0 satisfies \u01eb-ARSP if, and only if, there exist e : X \u2192 R and \u03c0 \u2208 \u2206(L) such that\nP0(y, Y ) = \u2211\n\u227b\u2208S(y,Y )\n\u03c0(\u227b) + e(y, Y ), (25)\nwhere e, viewed as an element of RM , has norm \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb.\nA second representation of nearly random utility maximization can be given with the notion of residual behavior of Apesteguia and Ballester (2021). It is a weighted combination of two terms. One stands fo the exact representation where the extended vector of choice probabilities is given as in the right-hand side of (20). It is interpreted as the predicted randomness expected to be found in the choice data. The other term is the component R0 \u2208 R M , where R0(y, Y ) \u2265 0 and \u2211 y\u2208Y R0(y, Y ) = 1 for all Y \u2208 D. When combined with the random utility maximization part, it leads to the expression\nP0 = (1\u2212 \u01eb)A\u03c0 + \u01ebR0. (26)\nComparing with (21), the relation in (26) reveals that a fraction of the data is explained by the random utility maximization model through a stochastic preference. This is the (1\u2212\u01eb)A\u03c0 part. The residual component, namely \u01ebR0, is composed of what is referred to in Apesteguia and Ballester (2021) as unstructured residual behavior. In our setting this residual refers to the portion of the data that is not explained by random utility maximization.\nThe random utility maximization model with the residual behavior just mentioned is\ncharacterized by a version of \u01eb-ARSP. It is defined next.\nDefinition 7 (\u01eb-ARSP\u2217). Let \u01eb \u2208 [0, 1]. The stochastic choice function P0 satisfies \u01eb-ARSP \u2217 if, for every tagged trial sequence T ,\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)ti \u2264 (1\u2212 \u01eb)max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti + (2 N0 \u2212 1)\u01ebmax\ni ti. (27)\nNote that any stochastic choice function represented as in (26) can be also expressed as in (21) with e = \u01eb(R0 \u2212 A\u03c0). Here, \u2016e\u20161 = \u01eb \u2016R0 \u2212A\u03c0\u20161 \u2264 (2 N0 \u2212 1)\u01eb. In fact, any stochastic choice function satisfying \u01eb-ARSP\u2217 also satisfies \u01eb\u0304-ARSP with \u01eb\u0304 = (2N0+1 \u2212 2)\u01eb. More important, as the proposition below shows, \u01eb-ARSP\u2217 characterizes the representation with residual behavior for the random utility maximization model.\nProposition 9. The stochastic choice function P0 satisfies \u01eb-ARSP \u2217 if, and only if, there exist \u03c0 \u2208 \u2206(L), and R0 \u2208 R M with R0(y, Y ) \u2265 0 and \u2211 y\u2208Y R0(y, Y ) = 1 for all Y \u2208 D, such that\nP0(y, Y ) = (1\u2212 \u01eb) \u2211\n\u227b\u2208S(y,Y )\n\u03c0(\u227b) + \u01ebR0(y, Y )."

            "text": "Many important results in economics rest on a separating hyperplane theorem. We gave approximate versions to two classical forms of rationality found in the literature. To this end, we provided characterizations of how close a pair of elements of two compact sets of probabilities are with reference to expected values of normalized functions, and also interpreted the conditions in terms of arbitrage opportunities. For the most part we turned standard arguments involving hyperplane separation into the problem of finding conditions under which two closed and convex sets are not too disjoint. We have shown that forms of nearly rational behavior obtain if, and only if, those two specific sets have points not too far from each other. The extent of departure from the classical forms of rational behavior addressed in this paper is directly proportional to the number \u01eb mentioned in the text. A natural generalization of the results obtained here would be to have conditions that do not explicitly reference the number \u01eb.\nAlso in relation to the more general question studied in Section 3 of this paper, Hellman (2013) was the first to employ techniques similar to the ones used here to prove a related result about nearly common priors. By relying on the idea of turning the non-existence of a common prior into the possibility of strictly separating two compact and convex sets as in Samet (1998), and using the minimum norm duality theorem given in Dax (2006), Hellman (2013) shows that a condition of absence of bets with expected gains for each player greater than \u01eb is equivalent to their priors having a suitably defined distance that does not exceed \u01eb. His setting shares a similar mathematical structure with the problem of aggregation of probabilities in the present paper, and we suspect that our results could be adapted in order to expand the framework of a finite state space in Hellman (2013). Such an extension would involve further mathematical complications and is beyond the scope of this paper.23\nThe connection between the general results presented in Section 3 above and the Coherence Theorem of de Finetti suggests that other forms of absence of arbitrage opportunities can be weakened in order to allow for approximate versions of linear pricing rules. Indeed, Acciaio et al. (2022) have recently shown that approximately arbitrage-free asset prices are near\n23A recent attempt at such an extension can be found in Hellman and Pinte\u0301r (2022).\na linear pricing rule. In this respect, the main difference (at least in the finite-dimensional setting) between the technical aspects of their result and the results reported in Section 3 of this paper is that while we obtain an approximate version of Gordan\u2019s Theorem of the Alternative, they establish such a version for Stiemke\u2019s Alternative. We suspect that the techniques involved in both papers can be also applied to characterize certain nonlinear pricing rules arising in the context of financial markets with frictions, such as the \u01eb-contamination pricing rule as described, for instance, in Araujo et al. (2012, 2018) and Chateauneuf and Cornet (2022).\nRegarding our solution to the problem of aggregating probabilities through a nearly linear averaging procedure, we characterized the single-profile case of the aggregation rule of Genest (1984) with a weaker form of Pareto unanimity. Genest (1984) originally considered the multi-profile setting, where the aggregation rule is invariant under changes of the probabilities of the members of the group. Namely, if we refer to I as the set of individuals (a compact metric space) in the group, the version of Genest\u2019s result translates into the existence of a probability measure m on I, and a probability measure R on X , such that PQ(E) = (1\u2212\u01eb) \u222b I Qi(E) dm(i)+\u01ebR(E) for all E \u2208 \u03a3X and continuous profiles of probabilities i 7\u2192 Qi. In the setting with a finite number of individuals it is not difficult to see that preserving the marginalization property while adding a monotonicity condition and controlling violations of the zero-probability property by \u01eb > 0 gives a multi-profile representation of our Proposition 5.24 We suspect that, by adapting the arguments in Nielsen (2019), we can obtain a multiprofile version of our Proposition 5 under our assumptions about X , the continuity of the profiles i 7\u2192 Qi, and compactness of I. This would at the same time refine and extend Genest\u2019s (1984) characterization of the marginalization property.\nOur results about the representation of stochastic choice functions relied on versions of the McFadden-Richter axiom permitting the rationalization of choice probabilities by random utility maximization. Like the McFadden-Richter axiom, the axioms \u01eb-ARSP and \u01eb-ARSP\u2217 introduced in this paper involve infinitely many restrictions. Therefore, in general we are also interested in weaker forms of the (finitely many) conditions involving the Block-Marschak (BM) polynomials used by Falmagne (1978). With the notation of Section 4.2, and especially in connection with our Proposition 8, it consists of employing the double description of the stochastic choice functions P0 following the random utility maximization model as\n{A\u03c0 : \u03c0 \u2208 \u2206(L)} = {P0 \u2208 R N0 : BP0 \u2265 0}, (28)\nfor some square matrix B of size N0 representing the BM polynomials, to derive the ap-\n24The monotonicity condition is needed because in the original representation of Genest (1984) the weights\nm(i) are not necessarily nonnegative except perhaps in some particular cases.\nproximate form of the representation. By well-known results on approximate solutions to systems of linear inequalities due to Hoffman (1952) and Gu\u0308ler et al. (1995), for a fixed P0 there exists a constant K > 0, depending only on B, such that for some \u03c0 \u2208 \u2206(L) we have\n\u2016P0 \u2212A\u03c0\u20161 \u2264 K \u2225\u2225(BP0)\u2212 \u2225\u2225 1 ,\nwhere (BP0) \u2212 i = max{\u2212(BP0)i, 0}. This shows that bounding the violations of the BM inequalities in the definition of the set in the right-hand side of (28) allows us to bound the distance of a stochastic function to the family of random utility maximization models. We suspect that by using a scaled version of the parameter \u01eb in the inequalities involving the BM polynomials we can also obtain an error term with \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb as in Proposition 8. At this point we do not have such a characterization. Yet, like in the random utility maximization model (see McFadden and Richter, 1990, pp. 182-183), we can also turn the problem of deciding whether choice probabilities are nearly generated by a random utility maximization model according to (25) into a linear programming problem. This is done by writing the problem of minimizing \u2016P0 \u2212 A\u03c0\u20161 subject to \u03c0 \u2265 0 and \u2211 \u227b\u2208L \u03c0(\u227b) = 1 in equivalent form as the linear program\nmin z,\u03c0\nM\u2211\ni=1\nzi\ns.t. \u2212 zi \u2264 P0(yi, Yi)\u2212 N\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c0jaij \u2264 zi, i = 1, . . . ,M\n\u03c0j \u2265 0, j = 1, . . . , N\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c0j = 1.\nChecking \u01eb-ARSP now involves a computational procedure that can be solved with wellknown algorithms and the inspection of whether its output has \u2211M\ni=1 zi \u2264 \u01eb."

Since for each Borel set E the indicator function 1E defined on X , as given by\n1E(x) =    1, if x \u2208 E\n0, if x /\u2208 E,\nis bounded, the mapping R 7\u2192 \u222b 1E dR = R(E) fromR to R is Borel measurable inR since it is the restriction of a Borel measurable mapping on \u2206(X) (Theorem 15.13 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006). Because the mapping R 7\u2192 R(E) is also bounded, it follows that for any m \u2208 \u2206(R) the value of Rm(E), which is nonnegative, is well defined for any Borel subset E of X . Obviously, Rm(X) = \u222b R 1X dm = 1. Now take any countable family {En : n \u2208 N} of pairwise\ndisjoint elements of \u03a3X . For each k, define the function fk : R \u2192 R by fk(R) = \u2211k n=1R(En).\nBy the properties of the Lebesgue integral we obtain that \u222b R fk dm = \u2211k n=1Rm(En).

Using the Dominated Convergence Theorem (Theorem 11.21 of Aliprantis and Border, 2006) it follows that\nRm(\u222a \u221e n=1En) =\n\u222b\nR\nf dm = lim k\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nR\nfk dm = \u221e\u2211\nn=1\nRm(En),\nthus establishing countable additivity of Rm. Therefore, Rm \u2208 \u2206(X).\nTo complete the proof, define the set of simple probability measures on R:\n\u2206s(R) =\n{ m \u2208 \u2206(R) : m = k\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi\u03b4Ri , \u2203 {R1, . . . , Rk} \u2286 R, \u03bbi \u2265 0, k\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi = 1\n} .\nNote that coR = {Rm \u2208 \u2206(X) : m \u2208 \u2206s(R)} \u2286 R\u0303, where R\u0303 = {Rm \u2208 \u2206(X) : m \u2208 \u2206(R)}. If Rm \u2208 R\u0303, by the Density Theorem (Theorem 15.10 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006) there exists a sequence (mn) in \u2206s(R) converging to m. For any closed set A \u2286 X the indicator function 1E on X is upper semicontinuous. Hence, the function R 7\u2192 R(E) = \u222b X 1E dR is also upper semicontinuous, and so is the mapping m 7\u2192 Rm(E) (see Theorem 15.5 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006). Therefore, for any closed set E \u2286 X we have\nlim sup n Rmn(E) \u2264 Rm(E), (29)\nthus showing that Rmn w\u2217 \u2212\u2192 Rm. This establishes the inclusion R\u0303 \u2286 clw\u2217 coR. It now suffices to show that R\u0303 is closed. If (Rmn) is a sequence in R\u0303 converging to R, by weak* compactness of \u2206(R) we may assume without loss of generality that (mn) converges to some m \u2208 \u2206(R). By the same argument leading to (29), we have that (Rmn) converges to Rm. By uniqueness of the limit we must have Rm = R. We conclude that\ncoR = clw\u2217 coR \u2286 R\u0303 \u2286 clw\u2217 coR,\nand thus coR = {Rm \u2208 \u2206(X) : m \u2208 \u2206(R)}."

The latter is viewed as a real-valued function on ca(X). The Cartesian product \u2206(X)\u00d7\u2206(X) is equipped with the product topology. Hence the mapping F is continuous. Since \u2016\u00b7\u20161, as the dual norm of the sup norm on C(X), is a lower semicontinuous function when ca(X) is endowed with the topology of weak convergence (see Lemma 6.22 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006), we conclude that \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161 = \u2016F (P,Q)\u20161 defines a lower semicontinuous function on \u2206(X) \u00d7 \u2206(X). In particular, the minimum of \u2016P \u2212Q\u20161, with P ranging over coP and Q ranging over coQ, is attained.

For a general m \u2208 \u2206(Q), note that by the Density Theorem (Theorem 15.10 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006) we also know that \u2206(Q) = clw\u2217\u2206s(Q), so that mn w\u2217 \u2212\u2192 m for some sequence (mn) in \u2206s(Q). The mapping Q 7\u2192 \u222b X f dQ is weak* continuous (Theorem 15.5 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006). By weak\nconvergence we therefore know that limn\u2192\u221e \u222b Q (\u222b X f dQ ) dmn = \u222b Q (\u222b X f dQ ) dm. At the same time, since for any closed subset E of X the indicator function 1E on X is upper semicontinuous, the function Q 7\u2192 Q(E) = \u222b X 1E dQ is also upper semicontinuous, and so is the mapping m 7\u2192 Qm(E) (see Theorem 15.5 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006). Therefore, for any closed set E \u2286 X we have lim supnQmn(E) \u2264 Qm(E). By the characterization of weak convergence we know that Qmn w\u2217 \u2212\u2192 Qm. Combining the convergence of (Qmn) and (mn) just established yields\n\u222b\nX\nf dQm = lim n\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nX\nf dQmn = lim n\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nQ\n(\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) dmn = \u222b\nQ\n(\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) dm.\nTurn to the proof of Proposition 3. Note that for any f \u2208 C(X) with unit norm the\nfunction \u2212f also has norm one, and \u222b\nX\n(\u2212f) dP \u2264 max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b (\u2212f) dQ+ \u01eb \u21d4 \u222b\nX\nf dP \u2265 min Q\u2208Q\n\u222b f dQ\u2212 \u01eb.\nTherefore the statements in (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Now assume that P is as in (17). In view of equation (32), simple calculations reveal that\n\u222b\nX\nf dP =\n\u222b\nQ\n(\u222b\nX\nf dQ ) dm+ \u222b\nX\nf de\n\u2264 max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ+\n\u222b\nX\nf de\n\u2264 max Q\u2208Q\n\u222b\nX\nf dQ+ \u2016f\u2016\u221e \u2016e\u20161 . (33)\nFor \u2016f\u2016\u221e = 1 and \u2016e\u20161 \u2264 \u01eb the inequality in item (i) is now a consequence of (33). Conversely, suppose that P cannot be expressed as in (17). By Corollary 1 there exists a continuous function f : X \u2192 R with unit norm such that \u222b X f dP \u2212 \u222b X f dQ > \u01eb for all Q \u2208 Q.\nIn particular, because of compactness of Q and continuity of the mapping Q 7\u2192 \u222b X f dQ we\nhave that \u222b X f dP > maxQ\u2208Q \u222b X f dQ+ \u01eb, thus showing that the statement in item (i) does not hold. This establishes the converse implication."

This part of the proof follows similar\nsteps to those of Proposition 2 in Mongin (1995). Define the set C \u2286 RN+1 so that\nC = {z : zi = Qi(E1)\u2212Qi(E2) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, zN+1 = P (E1)\u2212 P (E2), E1, E2 \u2208 \u03a3X}.\nObviously C 6= \u2205. By the Lyapunov Convexity Theorem (Theorem 13.33 in Aliprantis and Border, 2006) the set C is convex and compact.

Condition CM\u01eb implies that C \u2229 D = \u2205.

At the same time, by setting E1 = X , E2 = \u2205, and z\nequal to the zero vector, we obtain that \u2211N\ni=1 \u03bbi \u2265 0, a contradiction. Therefore, we may\nassume without loss of generality that \u03bbN+1 = 1.

            "text": "Assume that P0 is expressed as in (26). If T is a tagged trial sequence, simple calculations show that\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)ti = (1\u2212 \u01eb) \u2211\n\u227b\u2208L\n\u03c0(\u227b)\n[ M\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti\n] + \u01eb M\u2211\ni=1\nR0(yi, Yi)ti\n\u2264 (1\u2212 \u01eb)max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti + \u01eb(2 N0 \u2212 1)max\ni ti.\nThis is \u01eb-ARSP\u2217.\nConversely, suppose that \u01eb-ARSP\u2217 holds. Put N\u0302 = 2N0 \u22121. Because of Proposition 2 ap-\nplied to P = {P}, Q = {Q\u227b :\u227b\u2208 L}, and R = { 1 N\u0302 R \u2208 RM : R0(y, Y ) \u2265 0, \u2211 y\u2208Y R(y, Y ) =\n1 for all Y \u2286 Y , Y 6= \u2205}, it suffices to show that for no vector z \u2208 RM with nonnegative components and \u2016z\u2016\u221e = 1 we have\nM\u2211\ni=1\nPizi > (1\u2212 \u01eb)max Q\u2208Q\nM\u2211\ni=1\nQizi + \u01ebmax R\u2208R\nM\u2211\ni=1\nRizi. (41)\nSo suppose by way of contradiction that the vector z\u2217 \u2208 RM with nonnegative components verifies the inequality in (41). This is equivalent to\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)z \u2217 i > (1\u2212 \u01eb)max\n\u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)z \u2217 i + \u01eb max\nR0\u2208R0\nM\u2211\ni=1\nR0(yi, Yi)z \u2217 i , (42)\nwhere R0 = {N\u0302R : R \u2208 R}. For a fixed Y the mappings y 7\u2192 P0(y, Y ), y 7\u2192 a\u227b(y, Y ) and y 7\u2192 R0(y, Y ) are probability measures on Y . We now identify z(y, Y ) with the corresponding coordinate of z for which (yi, Yi) = (y, Y ). We can now add 1 \u2212 maxy\u2208Y z \u2217(y, Y ) to both sides of (42) and adjust the vector accordingly so that such an inequality also holds when maxy\u2208Y z \u2217(y, Y ) = 1. By repeating this procedure for each nonempty subset Y of Y , we can assume without any loss of generality that for all Y \u2286 Y with Y 6= \u2205 we have z\u2217(y, Y ) = 1 for some y \u2208 Y . Now proceed as in the proof of Proposition 8 to adjust again the vector z\u2217 if needed so that z\u2217 \u2208 QM , z\u2217i \u2265 0 for all i = 1, . . . ,M , and the coordinates for which z\u2217i = 1 are preserved. Hence we can write z \u2217 i = pi qi with 0 \u2264 pi \u2208 Z, and 0 < qi \u2208 Z. Let\nti = pi \u220f j 6=i qj . We therefore have\nM\u2211\ni=1\nP0(yi, Yi)ti > (1\u2212 \u01eb)max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti + \u01eb max R0\u2208R0\nM\u2211\ni=1\nR0(yi, Yi)t \u2217 i\n= (1\u2212 \u01eb)max \u227b\u2208L\nM\u2211\ni=1\na\u227b(yi, Yi)ti + \u01eb(2 N0 \u2212 1)max t\u2217i ,\nwhere the last equality follows from maximizing the second term in the right-hand side of the inequality in (42). This contradicts \u01eb-ARSP\u2217."
