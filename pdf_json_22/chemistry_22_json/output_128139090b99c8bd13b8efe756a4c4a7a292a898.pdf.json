It is formed by individual subunits of orthophosphate which are linked by structurally similar bonds and isoenergetic to those found in ATP. While the metabolism and the physiological roles of polyP have already been described in some organisms, including bacteria and yeast, the exact role of this polymer in mammalian physiology still remains poorly understood. In these organisms, polyP shows a co-localization with mitochondria, and its role as a key regulator of the stress responses, including the maintenance of appropriate bioenergetics, has already been demonstrated by our group and others. Here, using Wild-type (Wt) and MitoPPX (cells enzymatically depleted of mitochondrial polyP) SH-SY5Y cells, we have conducted a comprehensive study of the status of cellular physiology, using proteomics and metabolomics approaches. Our results suggest a clear dysregulation of mitochondrial physiology, especially of bioenergetics, in MitoPPX cells when compared with Wt cells. Moreover, the effects induced by the enzymatic depletion of polyP are similar to those present in the mitochondrial dysfunction that is observed in neurodegenerative disorders and in neuronal aging. Based on our findings, the metabolism of mitochondrial polyP could be a valid and innovative pharmacological target in these conditions.\nKeywords: mitochondria, bioenergetics, mitochondrial metabolism, OXPHOS, inorganic polyphosphate, metabolomics, proteomics, SH-SY5Y cells\nEdited by: Gloria Garrabou,\nInstitut d\u2019Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Spain\nReviewed by: Jaume Amengual,\nUniversity of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, United States\nHeather M.

            "text": "Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is an evolutionary conserved polymer, which is wide spread across all studied organisms, from bacteria to mammals (Kornberg et al., 1999; Kulakovskaya et al., 2010). It is composed of multiple monomers of orthophosphate linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, similar to those present in ATP (Kornberg et al., 1999). The concentration and length of polyP has shown to be variable in different subcellular locations and organisms (Kumble and Kornberg, 1995). In mammalian cells, polyP is usually formed by a couple of hundred monomers of orthophosphate, and it is found within the micromolar range (Kumble and Kornberg, 1995). The metabolism of polyP in these cells still remains poorly understood, even though a study showing the effects of the mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase in the synthesis and degradation of the polymer in the presence of mitochondrial respiration substrates and phosphates has been recently published (Bayev et al., 2020). However, additional pathways independent of the ATP synthase are probably also involved in the metabolism of polyP in mammalian cells (Borden et al., 2021; McIntyre and Solesio, 2021; Patro et al., 2021). In bacteria and yeast, the metabolism of the polymer is well-described. For example, it is known that polyP is converted into inorganic phosphate by the exopolyphosphatase (PPX) enzyme (Kornberg et al., 1999; Kulakovskaya et al., 2010).\nPolyP has been proposed as a key molecule in the cellular stress response in a wide range of organisms, including mammals (Judge and Leeuwenburgh, 2007; Paradies et al., 2010; Armstrong et al., 2018). Accordingly, polyP has an important regulatory role in many cellular processes that are commonly dysregulated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation, apoptosis, energy metabolism, calcium signaling, and protein homeostasis (Muller et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Morrissey et al., 2012; Solesio et al., 2016a; Amodeo et al., 2017; Angelova et al., 2018; Yoo et al., 2018; Maiolino et al., 2019; Solesio et al., 2020). In mammalian cells, polyP has been found in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, associated with membrane proteins (Kumble and Kornberg, 1995), in the extracellular space (Suess et al., 2017), and in different organelles such as acidocalcisomes and mitochondria, where the levels of the polymer correlate with those of ATP (Abramov et al., 2007; Solesio et al., 2016a). In fact, polyP synthesis is dependent on the metabolic status of the cell (Pavlov et al., 2005; Pavlov et al., 2010). Moreover, we have already demonstrated the role of polyP in the regulation of the intra-mitochondrial levels of free calcium, which are closely related to mitochondrial metabolism and ATP generation (Solesio et al., 2016b; Solesio et al., 2020). Indeed, intramitochondrial calcium signaling activates mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which leads to the increased levels of NADH and ATP (McCormack et al., 1990), present in stress response and in aging (Baltanas et al., 2013; Picard et al., 2018).\nMitochondrial function, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) regulation, is especially relevant to high-energy cells, such as neurons (Zheng et al., 2016). Changes in energy metabolism can compromise brain function and be\ncomponents in the etiopathology of multiple diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (Lin and Beal, 2006; Schon and Przedborski, 2011; Koopman et al., 2013). Moreover, increased ROS production, a well-known consequence of dysfunctional mitochondrial bioenergetics, is also a common aspect of neurodegeneration (Kudryavtseva et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2019). Furthermore, our research group has recently investigated the impact of mitochondrial polyP in the regulation of mammalian OXPHOS. By using HEK293 cells that are enzymatically depleted of mitochondrial polyP (MitoPPX), we demonstrated a significant shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis, globally affecting mitochondrial physiology (Solesio et al., 2021). MitoPPX cells are created by the stable transfection of Wt cells with a plasmid containing the sequence for the mitochondrial expression of the exopolyphosphatase enzyme (PPX), which is the enzyme in charge of the degradation of polyP in yeast. The homolog of the PPX enzyme in mammalian cells still remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that the effects induced by transfection with MitoPPX are due to the elimination of polyP and not to the transfection procedure or other effects of PPX on mammalian cellular physiology (Abramov et al., 2007; Seidlmayer et al., 2012; Seidlmayer et al., 2015).\nHere, we conducted a comprehensive proteomics and metabolomics study of the role of mitochondrial polyP in SHSY5Y cells, a cellular model widely used for experimental research in the field of neurodegeneration (Xicoy et al., 2017). Our goal is to better understand the contribution of mitochondrial polyP to the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular bioenergetics. To achieve this, we used Wild-type (Wt) and MitoPPX SH-SY5Y cells. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches were conducted to identify phenotypic differences between the cell lines, particularly focused on mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Our data suggested that the enzymatic depletion of mitochondrial polyP has a deleterious impact on various metabolic pathways, including mitochondrial bioenergetics, where several subunits of the Electron Transfer Chain (ETC) as well as metabolites, are altered. These integrated proteomics and metabolomics profiles could bring new insights into the specific role(s) of mitochondrial polyP in mammalian cells, as well as contribute to finding new therapeutic approaches using mitochondrial polyP as a valid target against dysfunctional organelle in human pathologies."

            "heading": "4 DISCUSSION",
            "text": "A wide range of mitochondrial alterations have been described in the etiopathology of various human diseases. These alterations include but are not limited to dysregulation of the ETC complexes, which will ultimately affect OXPHOS functionality, increasing ROS levels and unbalancing the cellular antioxidant system (Guzun et al., 2011; Gonzalez-Casacuberta et al., 2018; Gonzalez-Casacuberta et al., 2019). However, the exact molecular basis of the mechanism(s) underlying mitochondrial dysfunction still remain mostly unknown.\nPolyP has been described as a key molecule in the cellular stress response, including the regulation of several mitochondrial functions, such as energy metabolism (including calcium homeostasis), and protein homeostasis (Gray et al., 2014; Dahl et al., 2015; Gray and Jakob, 2015; Solesio et al., 2016a; Cremers et al., 2016; Lempart and Jakob, 2019; Xie and Jakob, 2019; Solesio et al., 2020; Solesio et al., 2021). However, the exact molecular mechanism explaining the effects of polyP in the regulation of mitochondrial function are still unclear, especially under stress conditions, such as in human disease.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive study of the effects of polyP on the proteome and the metabolome of mammalian cells has been conducted. Specifically, in the present study, a large number of protein expression and metabolite abundance alterations were described in SH-SY5Y cells that were enzymatically depleted of mitochondrial polyP (MitoPPX). These findings highlighted the importance of polyP in maintaining the proper cellular function, either through direct or indirect regulation of all proteins and metabolites that are differentially expressed in MitoPPX cells.\nThe number of differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins and the different abundance of mitochondrial metabolites\nobserved in MitoPPX cells showed the clear impact that enzymatical depletion of mitochondrial polyP has in the metabolism of the organelle. Two of the main dysregulated mitochondrial metabolic pathways identified by IPA software were OXPHOS and TCA. In our case, when we used IPA, the background was set for all proteins identified in the samples and not for the entire protein coding transcriptome (default in IPA). Specifically, ETC complex I, complex II, and complex IV showed differential protein expression of some of their subunits, leading to a potential alteration of their activity. Moreover, altered levels of succinate and oxoglutarate evidenced the dysregulation of the TCA. Indeed, the observed increased succinate ETC complex II subunits could indicate a blockage of this complex. In addition, further evidence that demonstrated that mitochondrial metabolism was affected, were increased levels of ATP, ADP, NAD, and NADH in MitoPPX cells. These findings reinforced the importance of polyP in the maintenance of mitochondrial and cellular function. One plausible mechanism explaining this differential pattern of protein and metabolites presence in MitoPPX cells could be the reduced chaperoning effects due to the lack of polyP in our model (Gray et al., 2014; Gray and Jakob, 2015; Lempart and Jakob, 2019). It is well known that the chaperoning ability of the cells is critical in the activation of the stress response. Indeed, the lack of mitochondrial polyP could promote the activation of the cellular stress response in MitoPPX cells. This explanation is supported by our proteomic analysis data, showing increased expression of some antioxidant enzymes (including several peroxiredoxins, thioredoxins, SOD1 and catalase), as well as of proteins involved in the regulation of the cellular stress response (including KEAP, Kelch-like ECHassociated protein 1). This entire cellular stress environment could further deleteriously affect mitochondrial metabolism.\nThe observed effects of polyP could also be at least partially mediated by the direct interaction between the polymer and the altered proteins within the OXPHOS and TCA which were identified in our analysis. In contrast to the mentioned increased expression of several antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial SOD2 expression was decreased in MitoPPX cells, which hints at this enzyme as a potential target of polyP. Mitochondrial SOD2 is a superoxide dismutase enzyme dependent on manganese, which is known to form complexes with polyP (Gray and Jakob, 2015). This property suggests a role for polyP in the detoxification process mediated by SOD2. Although we did not show direct evidence of increased ROS levels in these MitoPPX cells, the regulatory effects of the polymer on ROS have already been demonstrated in other organisms (Gray and Jakob, 2015). As previously mentioned, our data showed that ETC complexes I and IV were affected in MitoPPX cells. Some authors have evidenced an overall alteration of oxygen consumption as a consequence of these deficiencies in the ETC, which was also demonstrated by previous work, which was conducted in HEK293 cells (Solesio et al., 2021).\nThanks to our analysis, we were able to identify several upstream regulators of these changes in IPA analysis. For example, KDM5A was identified to regulate mitochondrial proteins, confirming that the lack of polyP could be involved\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 83312714\nin the decrease of KDM5A leading to the decrease of ETC subunits (COX7A2-complex IV and NDUFA4-complex I), and the increase of catalase and TXN2 (both participating in the antioxidant defense). KDM5A is a well-known regulator of the expression of mitochondrial proteins, especially of those involved in mitochondrial respiration (Varaljai et al., 2015). Furthermore, SIX1, a transcriptional factor described to regulate mitochondrial apoptosis (Du et al., 2017), was predicted to lead to decreased levels of 2-oxoglutaric acid and increased ATP levels. These alterations could be the potential cause underlying the TCA abnormalities observed in MitoPPX cells. Finally, creatine was identified to upregulate ATP and phosphocreatine among others. Creatine is an endogenous chemical converted into phosphocreatine, which is used to produce new ATP under certain circumstances (i.e. during high-intensity exercise) (Guzun et al., 2011). Moreover, the protective role of creatine in maintaining mitochondrial physiology is also known (Barbieri et al., 2016), and it has been demonstrated that the dietary supplementation with this molecule could improve cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function, therefore decreasing neuronal cell death in neurodegeneration (Adhihetty and Beal, 2008; Smith et al., 2014). In addition, IPA predicted three upregulated proteins, SIX1, UCP1, and HDAC 11, all of them involved in the upstream regulation of mitochondrial proteins and metabolites, as well as mitochondrial bioenergetics (Fedorenko et al., 2012; Kazak et al., 2015; Chowdhury et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Bhaskara, 2018; Hurtado et al., 2021). In general, the \u2018upstream regulators\u2019 analysis hinted at a cellular compensatory response in MitoPPX cells, in which increased presence of proteins involved in cell stress response, including ATP generation, was present, when compared with the Wt samples.\nThis study has some limitations. We recognize that the use of geneticin exclusively in the MitoPPX cells could exert some effects on the physiology of the SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, transfection with the MitoPPX contrast could change the amount and/or type of proteins in mitochondria. Moreover, our data was not sufficient to clarify the exact molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial polyP was involved in the regulation of bioenergetics within the organelle and therefore, in the regulation of mitochondrial physiology. Indeed, the present proteomics ad metabolomics approaches were not focused on the investigation of these mechanisms but to obtain a snapshot of mitochondrial metabolism. Further research is needed to better understand the role of polyP within mitochondria, especially in the context of neurodegeneration. However, this proteomics and metabolomics analysis bring new insights towards elucidating the role of polyP in the regulation of mitochondrial physiology in mammalian cells. Moreover, targeting the metabolism of polyP could provide us with novel therapeutic approaches for diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction has been broadly described as an early and triggering event, such as in neurodegenerative disorders.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the corresponding author, MS (m.solesio@rutgers.edu).
