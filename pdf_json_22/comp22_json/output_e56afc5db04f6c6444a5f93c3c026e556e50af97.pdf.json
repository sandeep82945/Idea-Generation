    "abstractText": "Patients go to multiple healthcare providers for treatment, and their health data is generally distributed among providers. The distributed health data and the decentralized health care system structure make it ideal for blockchain-based health information systems. The authors consider the referral use case; for instance, a patient goes to his primary health Centre (PHC) for treatment and is referred to a hospital. Authentication is usually done using certificates or key cryptography, which could become cumbersome when multiple parties are involved in a healthcare interaction. The security requirements were defined, and a novel multi-party, mutual patient identity authentication scheme called \"Distributed Dynamic Mutual Identity Authentication (DDMIA)\" was proposed for the referral use case in a blockchainbased e-health network. The DDMIA enables the PHC to authenticate the patient to the referred hospital. The DDMIA scheme was designed using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It was proven to be secure by assuming the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete log problem (ECDLP) and Elliptic curve computational Diffie\u2013Hellman problem (ECDH) using CK-Model. The formal security analysis using BAN logic proved that the sessions are secure after authentication. The DDMIA scheme was simulated in the AVISPA tool and proven safe against all active attacks. DDMIA scheme was simulated in the AVISPA tool and proven safe against all active attacks. The scheme allows a patient to be authenticated by multiple parties without registering with all parties. It eliminates the need for multiple registration centers as well as digital certificates. Hence, the DDMIA scheme can be implemented for similar multiparty authentication requirements in blockchain-based networks.

INTRODUCTION Patients visit various hospitals, private clinics, and public health centres for their health needs. Each of these healthcare providers generate and record health information about the patient [1]. There is a need to share the patient\u2019s health and medical history among healthcare providers, for informed medical decisions, which results in a better quality of healthcare. Technology adoption can improve the quality of healthcare as well as bring down the cost. The national e-health initiatives suggest the adoption of Electronic Health Records to create and maintain a longitudinal electronic record of the patient health information. Policy regulations for aspects like data exchange, data ownership, privacy protection, and security have been set. In general, the adoption of technol-\nogy for the healthcare sector is low in most countries [2]. Some private hospitals have adopted Hospital Information Systems and electronic medical records, however, seamless data exchange and comprehensive patient health records are not available.\nBlockchain technology has the potential to transform the healthcare industry [1]. The authors suggest the use of blockchain technology for integrating health data into EHRs as well as seamless data exchange [3]\u2013[7]. Various private and public e-health providers can be connected on a network to enable data integration and sharing. The patient\u2019s interactions with e-health care providers can be recorded as transactions in a trusted network without the involvement of third parties.

Blockchain-based data exchange will ensure the completeness as well as the immutability of the patient\u2019s health interactions. Several organizations are using blockchain technology for health records. For instance, the Gem Health Network, OmniPHR deploy blockchain-based technology to share patient records in a seamless environment [5]. MedRec is a decentralized record management system to handle EMRs using blockchain technology [8].\nIrrespective of the technology used, e-health providers are required to adopt administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the e-health Data [9]. e-health providers need to implement access controls, authentication, and nonrepudiation of health records [5]. This article addresses the authentication in blockchain-based health data exchange. There is a need to verify the identity of the person or entity involved in the e-health interaction. Authentication services verify the person or entity seeking data access in the network. Identity confirmation is usually done using public-key cryptography or a DNS based authentication using an existing and widely accepted form of identification such as social security number. In some implementations, the provider nodes and patient nodes are authenticated using consensus methods facilitated by miners using the Ethereum technology stack.\nAn important technical barrier in blockchain-based health data exchange is the need for entity authentication to be robust, it must be repeated for every entity-to-entity relationship [6]. We consider a typical use case in Indian Public Health scenarios, which is the referral [10]. The patient approaches his/her primary e-health provider who may refer the patient to another healthcare provider. For instance, a patient approaches the local Public Health Centre (PHC) for treatment. In most cases, the patient is treated in the Public Health Centre by the nurses or midwives. Sometimes the patient cannot be treated at the PHC, he/she will be referred to a doctor at the nearest Government Hospital (GH). Our blockchain-based EHR implementation connects the three parties, the patient and the two e-health providers on a private permissioned blockchain network. There is a need to authenticate the user\u2019s legality while requesting or modifying the patient\u2019s health data. This article focusses on the aspect of authentication of the multiple parties involved in this particular e-health setting.\nA. MOTIVATION AND RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION In blockchain-based Health Information systems, the authentication is mostly done using digital certificates and signatures. When multiple e-health providers are involved in the authentication, then each organization has to set up a certificate authority to generate the certificates. In the multiparty authentication scenario, certificates and signatures are not ideal for authentication. Consider the scenario of a patient who has been referred from Hospital A to Hospital B. The medical or health history of the patient has to be sent from Hospital A to Hospital B. This would require the patient to\nbe registered at both hospitals. The multiple certificates may cause a collision on identity and key management. Besides, if the certificate itself is corrupt, then the authentication fails, and the transaction is considered invalid. In the case of public key-based authentication methods, there are other challenges. The patient is required to manage the private keys for authentication among multiple e-health providers. Many key management solutions are unable to manage the patient\u2019s key pair while using various cryptographic mechanisms [11], [12]. Typically, key management issues occur: (1) When the system compromises its secret key and (2) When the number of patients is high. When the secret key is compromised, the security of the blockchain-based data is not guaranteed [8].\nBased on the use case, the security requirements of the proposed multiparty authentication scheme were listed as follows:\n\u2022 Mutual authentication: The entities involved in the transaction should be authenticated to each other before beginning the transaction. \u2022 Quick credentials verification: When multiple entities are involved in the authentication, the communication overhead should be minimal. The patient credentials should be authenticated before sending the login request to the PHC server. \u2022 Patient anonymity: The system should not reveal the identity of the patient. No potential attacker should be able to obtain the patient's original identity during authentication. \u2022 Secret key management: Key management focuses on securing the secret key. The secret key will be involved in the credentials/authentication parameter encryption and decryption operations. The secret key is also used to calculate the session key, which is necessary to create a secure channel over an insecure communication environment. If the server\u2019s secret key is compromised then the whole session will be vulnerable. \u2022 Session key agreement: The session key creates a secure channel over an insecure communication environment. All three parties should share a common session key among them to establish a secure channel between them. The shared session key should be confidential. If it is revealed, the entire session will be insecure. \u2022 Perfect forward secrecy: This ensures that the session key will not be revealed to the adversary even if the secret key of the server has been compromised. \u2022 Resilience against insider attack: The administrator or a person in the registration centre should not be able to access the password of the entities participating in the authentication \u2022 Prevention of replay attack: In this attack, the adversary intercepts the previously successful login messages. The attacker resends or replay the obtained message and tries to enter into the system. Therefore the system should verify the freshness or validity of the message before authenticating it.\nVOLUME 4, 2016 3\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

A distributed, dynamic, mutual identity authentication (DDMIA) scheme for patients in the blockchain network has been designed and implemented. The authentication scheme is distributed among the parties involved in the referral. The authentication schemes preserve patient anonymity by computing a dynamic identity for every session. One party mutually authenticates the patient to another party without expecting the patient to register with multiple healthcare providers.\nIn general, the proposed blockchain-based authentication scheme is suitable for authentication among multiple parties involved in the communication. In this scenario, DDMIA avoids repeated registration with multiple healthcare providers. Also, the scheme is independent of the third party while authenticating all active participants involved in the communication. Hence, DDMIA reduces the overall time and computation required for traditional multiple authentications. The proposed scheme security is formally proved in the CK-model. Using BAN logic we proved that the proposed scheme secures the sessions after authentication. Also, the proposed scheme is simulated in the AVISPA tool to prove that the scheme is safe against all active attacks. The security features of the proposed work for blockchain-based multiparty authentication has been proved by cryptanalysis.\nB. RELATED WORK Till date, several authentication schemes were proposed in the e-health sector. Chen et al. [14] proposed an authentication scheme for cloud-based electronic medical records which focusses on withstanding impersonation attack, replay attack, and man-in-middle attack. Later Chiou et al. [15] identified the weaknesses in Chen et al. scheme [14], they proved that it does not support patient anonymity, message authentication, and support telemedicine. Mohit et al. [16] reviewed Chiou et al. scheme [15] and identified that it does not support patients\u2019 anonymity and is vulnerable to stolen device attacks. Mohit et al. proposed an authentication scheme for cloud-based e-health systems, which overcomes the identified weaknesses. In the same year, Cheng et al. [17] reviewed Chiou et al. scheme [15] and identified the Key compromise impersonation and the forward secrecy issues in the scheme. Cheng et al. proposed an authentication scheme based on Bilinear pairing to achieve security. In 2018 Li et al. [18] reviewed Mohit et al. scheme and found that the scheme does not support patient anonymity and patient unlinkability. Also, it identified that the scheme is insecure against report revelation and report forgery attacks. Also, Li et al. proposed an authentication scheme to overcome the identified weaknesses.\nSeveral blockchain-based authentication schemes have been proposed. In 2018, Wang et al. [19] proposed a blockchain-based mutual authentication scheme. In this scheme, they claimed that their scheme\u2019s authentication parameters would not be stored in the database. That makes\nthe scheme independent from third parties during the authentication process. In 2019 Conti et al. [20] proposed a blockchain-based distributed authentication scheme to enable secure and efficient mobility management in informationcentric networking. In 2019 Wang et al. [21] introduced a blockchain-based mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for smart grid infrastructure. This scheme elaborates on the conditional anonymity, active participation, and mutual authentication between the participants. In 2019, Liu et al. [22] proposed a Medibchain-based privacy-preserving mutual authentication scheme for the telecare medical information system. The scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography and focused on building a MediBchain-based system for mobile medical cloud architecture. Also, it provides security to sensitive data like patient identity. In 2020 Khalid et al. [23] proposed A decentralized lightweight blockchain-based authentication mechanism for IoT systems. This scheme was based on fog computing technology and built for a public blockchain.\nFinally, the multi-party authentication schemes were reviewed. In 2017, Odelu et al. [24] proposed a multiparty authentication scheme using elliptic curve cryptography. In 2016 Park-Park [25] reviewed Chang et al.'s authentication and key agreement scheme proposed in 2015 and identified that Chang et al.'s scheme does not provide sufficient security and fails to provide accurate password updates. To overcome the identified weaknesses, Park-Park proposed a three-factor user authentication and key agreement scheme using the elliptic curve cryptosystem. In 2017 Amin et al. [26] proposed an anonymous and robust multi-server authentication protocol using multiple registration servers to manage a large number of users. Later, Qi et al. [27] proposed a biometricsbased authentication key exchange protocol for multi-server Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) in 2018. The scheme aimed to secure the system\u2019s private key by not sharing it with the authentication process participants.\nIn 2020 Xiang et al. [28] proposed a permissioned blockchain-based identity management and user authentication scheme for e-Health systems. This scheme authenticates the users and medical servers through the registration center. In 2020, Li et al. [29] a blockchain-based data aggregation and group authentication scheme for the electronic medical system is proposed. Further, in 2020, Cui et al. [30] proposed a hybrid blockchain-based authentication scheme for multi wireless sensor networks. Here, the authors proposed an authentication scheme that performs between multiple wireless sensor networks and designed a hybrid blockchain for the network model. In 2021 Gao et al. [31] proposed a privacy-preserving identity authentication scheme based on the blockchain. In this scheme, users will generate their own identities and their publicly verifiable information. This public information is stored on the blockchain.\nFrom the literature review, we can observe that (i) most of the authentication schemes presented have security issues, and their improved schemes also exhibit security attacks. (ii) Many schemes can perform the authentication between"

(iii)Dependency on the third party is always a bottleneck for the system efficiency when it is too busy handling large incoming requests [50]. Therefore, It is very much necessary to propose a distributed authentication scheme that can mutually authenticate patients and hospitals without the involvement of any third party. Based on the literature, we formulated the security requirements and proposed an appropriate multi-party authentication called Distributed Dynamic Mutual Identity Authentication (DDMIA).\nC. METHODOLOGY The proposed work appears in three stages. (i) the First stage of the work was to set up a blockchain for the healthcare network. (ii) Next stage is to propose a distributed dynamic user authentication scheme and related smart contract algorithms by considering the security requirements of the multi-party authentication scheme. (iii) the Last stage is to analyze the security and the performance of the proposed authentication scheme. The following subsections briefly illustrate how these stages are implemented."

For illustration purposes, the authors considered a scenario where a patient is registered to the local Primary Health Centre (PHCi) and visits the PHCi for treatment. When the PHCi is unable to treat the patient on its own, it refers the patient to the Government Hospital (GHi). The DDMIA scheme does not expect the patient to register to the GHi. Instead, the patient's identity is authenticated to the GHi by the PHCi."

In AVISPA scheme can be implemented by the High-Level Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL). It is a role-based language where every participant in the system is considered as a role. Each role is independent and communicates through channels with other roles. The session security of DDMIA has been analyzed using a formal method called BAN logic [33]. Computation, communication, and functional analysis have been made and compared with other recently proposed schemes to verify the robustness of DDMIA. The DDMIA authentication scheme has been implemented in the GO language using crypto libraries to do the analysis.

RESULT OF FORMAL SECURITY VERIFICATION USING AVISPA TOOL This section presents the results of the security verification using the AVISPA tool. The schemes in AVISPA can be Implemented by the HLPSL. In HLPSL, the Doley-Yao model [37] has been used to build the intruder. During the execution of schemes, the HLPSL code is converted into an Intermediate Format(IF) through hlpsl2if. Further, the backend reads the IF and analys the security goals. There are four backends are used in AVISPA used for security analysis known as On-the-fly Model-Checker (OFMC) [41], CL-AtSe (Constraint Logic-based Attack Searcher) [42], SAT-based Model checker [43] and Tree Automata based on Automatic Approximations for the Analysis of Security Protocols (TA4SP) [44]. If the protocol achieves all defined goals, then the output will be given as SAFE else the output will be UNSAFE.\nThe result of security verification using the AVISPA tool is presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The results are obtained through the back ends OFMC and CLAtSe as SAFE. The other two backends SATMC and TA4SP, do not support the XOR feature. Hence the results are received as \"Inconclusive.\" From the obtained result, we can clearly say that the DDMIA scheme achieves all the specified goals and resists all active attacks.\nD. FORMAL ANALYSIS OF DDMIA USING BAN LOGIC This section presents the formal analysis of DDMIA using BAN-logic proposed by Burrows et al. [33]. The analysis aims to prove the security of the scheme\u2019s session key shared between the Pi, PHCi, and GHi. Before beginning the analysis, we illustrate the notations and the logical postulates related to BAN-logic.\n1) Notations in the BAN Statements [33]\nThis section presents the syntax and semantics of the BANlogic necessary to prove the security goals. The logic model has several objects which are named as principals, encryption keys, and formulas. To better understand the notations, we represented U and S as principals, K is the shared key, SK is the shared session key between the principals, and X denotes the statements. The logical notations and its descriptions are given below:\nU SK\u2194 S : Ui and S share the session key SK to communicate. U |\u2261 X : U believes the statement X and take as true. U / X : U receives statement X and is capable of reading it. U |\u223c X : U sents the statement X .

The execution time for Tsym, Tkdf , Tc is taken from [24], [27], which is 0.0046ms, 0.008ms, 0.02104, respectively.\nThe computation cost of DDMIA is the sum of the costs of Pi; PHCi; and GHi. The cost has been computed based on the number of operations performed during the authentication phase. We are not considering the cost of xor and concatenation operations since the execution time is negligible. Pi needs two Tmul operations and 14 hash operations to compute parameters therefore the computation cost of Pi is 2Tmul + 14Th. Similarly PHCi and GHi needs 12Th, and 1Tmul + 10Th, respectively to compute the communication parameters. Hence, the total computation cost of the proposed DDMIA scheme is 3Tmul + 35Th.\nOn comparison of the DDMIA authentication scheme with multiparty schemes, we observe that the computation cost of DDMIA is better than all, except for the Amin et al. scheme [26]. This difference is because Amin et al. scheme is proposed using hash functions only whereas DDMIA uses elliptic curve cryptography. According to Wang and Wang [49] the usage of hash function only in the scheme, will result in loss of user anonymity and public-key techniques should be used instead. On comparing the proposed DDMIA scheme with other traditional schemes presented in Table 7, we observed that the computation cost of DDMIA is lesser than Xu et al. and Lei et al. schemes and slightly higher than Irshad et al. and Chaudhary et al. schemes. However, these traditional schemes having architectural limitations wherein the patient directly communicates with the hospital. The estimated execution time of the DDMIA scheme is (3 * 0.101 ms) + (35 * 0.008 ms) = 0.583ms. Similarly, on comparing the results of DDMIA with the other multi-party authentication schemes (Table 7), we observed that the estimated execution of the DDMIA is slightly higher than Amin et al. [26] scheme but lesser than all other multi-party schemes.\nThe communication cost was also analysed against the schemes listed in table 7. The communication cost calculation includes the estimated cost of the communication parameters in the login and authentication phase of one complete session. For consistency purpose, we assume that the length of the identity IDi/PIDi/HIDi is 32 bits, the output size of hash function h1(.), h2(.), and h3(.) is 160\nbits, size of an elliptic curve point is 320 bits, the block size of symmetric encryption/decryption is 128 bits, and a random number/Timestamp is 128 bits. The login phase, and authentication and key agreement phase, DDMIA requires a total of 320 + 160 + 160 + 128 = 768 bits, 768 + 160 + 160 + 128 = 1216 bits, 160 + 320 + 128 = 608 bits, and 608 + 160= 768 bits, for the messages M1 = {Cu, CIDi, C1, T1}, M2 = {Cp, C2, T2}, M3 = {C3, Ck, T3} and M4 = {C4}. Hence, the total communication cost required to achieve the one session of DDMIA is 3360 bits.\nCompared to the other schemes presented in Table 7, the overall communication cost of DDMIA is equal to the ParkPark [25] scheme and higher than all other schemes. But, it is still acceptable because the DDMIA scheme is a distributed and dynamic, multi-party authentication scheme where the participants can mutually authenticate without depending upon the registration center. In DDMIA, a registration center is essential only for the registration of healthcare providers. While other multi-party authentication schemes completely depend upon a third party to perform the authentication. Also, DDMIA meets the mentioned security criteria whereas the other schemes are vulnerable to several attacks which are presented in the next section. Hence, we claim that the DDMIA scheme is still efficient and robust in the blockchain based distributed, multi-party architecture."

The functions considered for comparative study are illustrated in the section I A.\nFrom Table 8, it is clear that two schemes, [47] and the proposed DDMIA scheme meet all the functional requirements.

Multiparty schemes like [24] authentication scheme uses elliptic curve cryptography, but the scheme is vulnerable to replay attack. [25] authentication scheme is a three-factor user authentication that uses the elliptic curve cryptosystem. However, the scheme does not support forward secrecy and is vulnerable to insider attack. [26] authentication protocol uses multiple registration servers to manage users and does not provide patient anonymity. Registration in multiple servers may result in identity collision and affect key management. [27] scheme is based on biometrics authentication for multiserver TMIS, But the scheme is vulnerable to insider attack. Therefore, the authors conclude that the DDMIA scheme has all the required security features which makes it the most robust.\nThe proposed multi-party DDMIA scheme ensures that the authentication process is scalable in comparison with a centralized approach. DDMIA decreases the dependency on registration centers for authentication, a one-time registration is done by health care providers in the blockchain network. During the referral itself, authentication is de-centralized, it will be done on the server of the hospital to which the patient has been referred. In case of multiple simultaneous authentication requests on the same hospital server, the requests will be queued and the running time and latency are expected to increase linearly.\nV. CONCLUSION The proposed DDMIA authentication scheme was designed keeping in mind the security requirements of a decentralized, multiparty authentication scheme for blockchain-based networks. The patient registers with a e-health provider 'A'and can initiate a consultation. The e-health provider 'A'can refer the patient to another e-health provider 'B'for appropriate treatment. The patient is not required to register with 'B'and 'A'dynamically and mutually authenticates the patient with 'B'. The security requirements of a blockchain-based e-health network were defined, the DDMIA scheme was proven in theory and with cryptanalysis. The formal security verification was done using the AVISPA tool and BAN Logic proved that the session is secure. In terms of computation cost, the DDMIA scheme is more efficient than all other multi-party schemes. The distributed nature of the multiparty authentication is achieved by using more communication bits, however, this cost will not affect the network. The DDMIA scheme has\nan execution time better than the other multi-party schemes and its distributed nature will ensure scalability. The overall communication cost of DDMIA is higher than all other schemes but it is acceptable because it is a distributed, dynamic and multi-party authentication scheme independent of the registration center. Functional analysis proves that in comparison with other multi-party schemes, the DDMIA is the most robust among them because it achieves all the specified security requirements. Furthermore, the DDMIA scheme is a plug-in over an existing blockchain technology that performs authentication separately from the primary blockchain based transaction system, it is not affected by the writing of transactions and block generation. Hence DDMIA authentication is distributed among healthcare providers and it can scale and perform authentication for simultaneous requests efficiently.\nIn most countries, e-health networks consist of many healthcare providers, and the patient interacts with different providers for every health problem. Each health care provider generates data about the patient and records the same in their own isolated repositories. In the absence of nationwide identifiers, it is challenging to integrate the health data or medical history of a patient into a comprehensive EHR. The features of blockchain-based technologies make them ideal for adoption in e-health environments. The network could be a country-wide network of health providers connected in a permissioned private network. Authentication could become cumbersome because the patient must register with multiple health care providers. This article presents a novel, robust, distributed multi-party authentication scheme for referrals in blockchain-based e-health networks. The DDMIA scheme ensures that healthcare providers can mutually authenticate a patient without registrations faster and securely. In the future, the proposed scheme can be improved in terms of communication cost reduction, which will enhance the throughput and decrease latency. Since the DDMIA scheme has a plug-in architecture, it can also be developed as a cloud-based \u2018Authentication-as-a-service.\u2019 The registration center can also be replaced with a novel consensus algorithm, ensuring a fully decentralized blockchain network. In the future, artificial intelligence-based approaches and intelligent blockchain technologies could play a game-changing role in blockchain-based authentication schemes."
