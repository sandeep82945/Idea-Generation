On the other hand, CO2 is an abundant, renewable, inexpensive and non-toxic C1 source of chemical carbon in organic syntheses.1\u201315 Although utilization of carbon dioxide as C1 feedstock is challenging in view of its thermodynamic and kinetic inertness,16 research that deals with sustainable use of CO2 in producing value-added chemicals is advancing at a rapid rate.17\u201321 Of many important CO2 transformation reactions,22 cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates stands out to be a very attractive transformation process.23\u201357\nrsity, Guwahati 781014, Assam, India.\nSI) available.

Catalyst system 2-TBAB appears to be a bit better than 1-TBAB in case of the substrate AGE (compare entry 8 and 9, 85% and 92% conv., respectively). For the substrate BGE, both the vanadium complexes 1 and 2 showed similar potentiality as catalysts resulting in 85% (entry 10) and 82% (entry 11) conversions for catalyst 1 and 2, respectively. To investigate the effect of CO2 pressure on the catalytic activity of the catalyst system, a reaction was performed with SO as substrate under 1 bar of CO2 pressure keeping other parameters the same. It is seen that 100% conversion of SO (entry 12) to its corresponding COC could be achieved within 6 h of duration in a mere 1 bar of CO2 pressure indicating 1-TBAB combination to be a very efficient catalyst."

Lewis acidic V(IV) center of oxovanadium(IV) complexes 1 and 2 activates the epoxide by coordinating through the epoxide Oatom which results in the weakening of b C\u2013O bond as well as increase in the electrophilic nature of the b carbon of the epoxide. As a result, bromide anion from TBAB attacks epoxide b-carbon more facilely and cleaves the O\u2013CH2 bond to produce intermediate A. In the next step, oxyanion intermediate Amakes a nucleophilic attack at the carbon center of CO2 to generate a carbonate species (intermediate B). In the nal step, the ring closure through nucleophilic attack by carbonate species at bcarbon results in the cyclic carbonate products."

Block shaped brown crystals obtained from the methanolic solutions of complexes 1 and 2 were crystallographically characterised and revealed to be dioxovanadium complexes 1A, [VVO2L1] and 2A, [V\nVO2L2] respectively. Crystal structures determined for complexes 1A and 2A indirectly give an evidence for the formation of complexes 1 and 2 where the vanadium(IV) centers were slowly oxidised to vanadium(V) during the crystallization process. However, structures of oxovanadium(IV) complexes [1 NO3 ]+ and 2 have been optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the uB3LYP/631G**/LANL2DZ level of theory. It is worthy to mention that the structural parameters of the optimized structures are in very good agreement with their dioxovanadium(V) counterparts, 1A and 2A. TD-DFT calculation for the complex 1 (without NO3 anion) could support the presence of electronic absorption bands at longer wavelengths (546 nm, oscillator strength f \u00bc 0.1281) attributable to d\u2013d transitions. Moreover, spin density plot of the oxovanadium(IV) complexes [1 NO3 ]+ and 2 show localization of spin density on the V(IV) centers supporting the experimental EPR lines. An investigation on the catalytic activity of the oxovanadium(IV) complexes in the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide with the epoxides to yield cyclic organic carbonates as products revealed that V-complexes 1 and 2 are efficient catalysts. Applicability of dioxovanadium(V) complexes 1A and 2A as catalysts in various reactions are also being investigated."

In order to consider the solvent effect (dichloromethane was used as the solvent), self-consistent reaction eld method was applied in all of the calculations. Zero-point energies and thermal corrections were also included. As no imaginary frequencies were found, the optimized geometry was ensured to be the potential energy minima by vibrational frequency calculations at the same level of theory.
