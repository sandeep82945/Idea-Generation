            "text": "Page 2/16\n1. Introduction The concept of silicon drift detector (SDD) was introduced by Gatti and Rehak in 1983[1, 2]. A chief feature of a silicon drift detector is its unique small capacitance, which is independent of the detector\u2019s active area [3, 4]. As a result, SDDs have better energy resolution compared with other x-ray detectors [4]. The energy resolution is primarily dependent on the noise level [5\u20137]. The total noise includes the Fano noise and the electric noise. The rst term depends on the material properties; therefore, the main factor affecting the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is the electric noise, which is closely related to the leakage current of the detector and the total capacitance [5\u20137]. Moreover, additional factors can broaden the peak and worsen the energy resolution; those include ballistic de cit [6], imperfect charge collection [8], and various other factors. Those factors are susceptible to the bias conditions of the device. While the energy resolution of SDD has been studied extensively [9\u201311], in literature, a limited number of articles have reported the study of bias conditions on energy resolution. The charge collection of the SDD was measured using a 55Fe radioactive source, and an improvement of the peak-to-background ratio of up to 20% was achieved by optimizing biasing voltages [9]. Another research reported that the energy resolution varies with the different bias voltages on the back contact [10]. The charge collection e ciency and carrier collection time are closely related to the bias conditions since the transport characteristics are susceptible to the bias conditions of the device. In addition, for classical SDDs, the exibility of bias conditions is limited because its maximum applied voltage is not allowed to exceed twice the depletion voltage [12], resulting in fewer studies on the bias conditions. Therefore, we proposed a quasi-doublesided silicon detector to analyze and verify the effect of bias conditions on energy resolution.\nPage 3/16\nIn this paper, a quasi-double-sided silicon detector (QD-SDD) was proposed to enhance the exibility of bias conditions and investigate the effect of bias conditions. Then, simulations were performed to obtain the transient response current of the anode under different bias conditions. Modeling is critical for accurate inference and analysis. Therefore, the parameters used in the model are authentic and reliable. Devices operating at different bias conditions and irradiated by an incident x-ray were simulated. The electrical properties under those conditions were also compared and analyzed. and, the electron collection e ciency of the QD-SDD at different operating conditions was calculated. The magnitude of the electric eld at different bias conditions was extracted, which is essential for the analysis of the carrier transport process. Thus, from the analysis of the simulation results, it is clear that better electron collection e ciency and shorter collection time are achieved due to optimized bias conditions. Finally, the fabricated QD-SDD was characterized using a 55Fe radiation source and better energy resolution of QDSDD was realized by optimizing the bias conditions. Energy resolution down to 170 eV was obtained.\n2. Simulation Of Quasi-double-sided Silicon Drift Detector\n2.1. Design and Parameters in simulation For a conventional SDD, its maximum applied bias voltage is not allowed to exceed twice the depletion voltage, otherwise large hole currents will appear between the drift rings [12]. In order to enhance the exibility of device bias conditions and investigate the effect of bias conditions on device performance, a novel quasi-double-sided silicon drift detector, shown in Fig.\u00a01b, was proposed. Silicon drift detectors are devices that require bias voltages applied on both sides to achieve sideward depletion [2]. For a quasidouble-sided silicon drift detector, the drift path for transporting and collecting electrons is established by applying bias voltages to the four electrodes of the device. On the anode side (front side), a circular n+ region is located in the center, which acts as an anode (Va) to collect electrons, and a large amount of concentric p+ rings surround the anode [13]. The innermost concentric p+ ring (V1) close to the anode and the outermost concentric p+ ring (Vn) near the guard ring area, as the front electrodes, are biased to build the electron drift path. On the other side (back side), the large circular p+ ring in the center (Vb) and the outermost concentric p+ ring (Vbn), as back side electrodes, are also biased to drive electrons toward the anode. In addition, to create a potential gradient that forces electrons to drift toward the anode, different negative voltages are biased at the innermost p+ ring near the anode and the outermost p+ ring on the front side, respectively. The negative bias gradually decreases from the outermost drift ring to the innermost drift ring. The condition of the back side electrodes is similar to that of the front side. Once the electron-hole pairs are created by an incident x-ray, electrons drift toward the anode while holes are driven to the neighboring p+ drift rings [13]. The disad\nTo illustrate the great exibility of a quasi-double-sided silicon drift detector in terms of bias conditions, the TCAD was used to simulate the transient anode current of SDDs. The current response of a silicon drift detector consists of two processes: the generation process of carriers in silicon substrate from an\nPage 4/16\nincident x-ray event; and the transport process of carriers in the device. During the simulation, only the carrier transport process is considered to simplify the model and reduce the computation time. The parameters in the model are realistic, and those parameters are used in experiments. An n-type highohmic wafer with a thickness of 525 \u00b5m (\u2265 10 k\u2126cm, a depletion voltage close to -40 V) was introduced as substrate in the simulation. Table\u00a01 shows the parameters of SDDs used in the simulations. The pitch of drift rings and guard rings are 100 \u00b5m and 65 \u00b5m, respectively. In addition, the numbers of drift rings and guard rings are 20 and 10, respectively.\nTable 1 Parameters used to simulate QD-SDD and classical SDD.\nRadius of anode (\u00b5m)\nWidth of drift ring (\u00b5m)\nGap of drift ring (\u00b5m)\nWidth of guard ring (\u00b5m)\nGap of guard ring (\u00b5m)\nWidth of ground ring (\u00b5m)\n50 75 25 40 30 150\n2.2. The simulation results of QD-SDD and single-sided SDD at different Vn voltages. Carrier collection e ciency and carrier collection time are related to the bias conditions, and shorter collection time [9] and better collection e ciency [10] imply better device performance. In order to investigate how the bias conditions of the QD-SDD affect the transport characteristics and energy resolution, the simulations of the device under different bias conditions were performed and the simulation results were analyzed.\nFirstly, the QD-SDD and classical SDD at different Vn voltages have been simulated with: (1) the innermost drift ring (V1) has been biased at -10 V; (2) the center drift ring on the back (Vb) has been kept at -40 V; (3) the assumption that electrons are generated by x-rays is introduced into the model, and an energy of 3.6 eV is required to generate an electron-hole pair. The bias conditions of QD-SDD are shown in Fig.\u00a02. X-rays are incident vertically on the detector with a distance of 1500 \u00b5m from the anode. The pulse signal is obtained by extracting the instantaneous current response of the anode. In addition, by processing and analyzing the date of the transient anode current, the electron collection e ciency and electron collection time have been plotted as a function of the bias voltages on the outermost drift rings (Vn and Vbn).\nThe QD-SDD depicted in Fig.\u00a02 has been simulated and the transient anode current from x-ray events has been extracted. In addition, the simulation of a single-sided SDD at different Vn voltages has been performed with the same bias conditions. Figure\u00a03 shows the transient anode current evolution after the electron-hole pairs generated by x-rays for a QD-SDD and a single-sided SDD at different Vn voltages. The simulation results show that the transient anode current is composed of a fast ramp and a slow decay component. For a single-sided SDD, the transient anode current is shown in Fig.\u00a01a and it is distorted with increasing Vn voltage at reverse bias voltage greater than \u2212 80 V. At reverse bias voltage less than \u2212 80 V,\nPage 5/16\nthe peak of the pulse current is reduced with decreasing Vn voltage. This result indicates that the maximum voltage applied to classical SDD in simulation is -80 V, which is close to twice the depletion voltage of the device. Due to the presence of the maximum bias voltage, the exibility of the bias conditions for a single-sided SDD is de nite. However, for a QD-SDD, as the bias voltages (Vn and Vbn) on outermost drift rings increase, the change in the transient anode current shown in Fig.\u00a01b is considered in these two aspects: the collection time of electrons becomes shorter; the width of pulse current becomes narrower (pulse peak becomes higher), respectively. The difference in anode pulse current originates from the different bias conditions. It is clear that the transport characteristics have been changed due to the variable Vn voltages and the great exibility of bias conditions is achieved for the QD-SDD. Lastly, both the rise time and the fall time (time required for the current to rise/fall from 10%/90% of its peak to 90%/10%) are reduced due to the increased Vn voltages. The reduction in the rise time or the fall time is mainly due to the larger Vn voltages.\nIn order to clarify the effect of Vn voltage on the transient anode current, the analyze of the electric eld has been performed. The electron concentration in the detector is shown in Fig.\u00a04a, and the drift path of electrons is clearly visible. The transport path of electrons is away from the front surface. A safe distance between the electron drift trajectory and the anode is crucial to avoid trapping electrons at the Si-SiO2 interface [14]. A cutline along with the drift trajectory has been used to extract the electric eld intensity. In order to observe the change in the electric eld as accurately as possible, the line from (0, 160) to (2000,250) is chosen as the cutline. As shown in Fig.\u00a04b, the variation of electric eld intensity at different Vn voltages has been extracted. The electric eld intensity is closely related to the potential difference. As the voltage on the outermost drift rings increases, it can be noticed that the electric eld also increases, and the increment below the drift ring region is greater than that below the anode region. A stronger electric eld means higher electron drift velocity and shorter collection time.\nThe charge collection time is de ned as the time required to collect (1\u20131/e) of the total charge [15]. As shown in Fig.\u00a05a, the electron collection time at different Vn voltages is plotted as a function of the bias voltages of the outermost drift rings. As the bias voltages on the outermost drift rings on both sides increases, the electron collection time to the anode is reduced. The higher potential difference between the innermost drift ring and the outermost drift ring on both sides results in a stronger electric eld in bulk. As a result, the collection time of electrons drifting toward the anode is reduced. Once the electrons are generated by x-rays in the detector, those electrons are driven toward the anode and collected. The collection time is inversely proportional to the electron drift velocity and the time for electrons to reach the anode is shorter for the detector operating at higher Vn voltages. At higher bias voltages, the shorter electron collection time is realized due to stronger electric eld in bulk and reduces the effect of ballistic de cit, resulting in a better energy resolution [17].\nFor the silicon radiation detector system, the pulse height spectrum is related to the charge collection e ciency [8], therefore energy resolution of the detector is affected by carrier collection e ciency. In order to clarify the relationship between Vn voltage and the electron collection e ciency ( ), which has been\nPage 6/16\nextracted by processing the transient anode current. It is de ned as the ratio of the number of electrons collected by the anode to the total number of free electrons created by the x-ray event [18]. The electron collection e ciency is shown in Fig.\u00a05b. The electron collection e ciency of the anode is related to the bias voltage on the outermost drift rings and electron collection e ciency is improved by increasing the Vn voltage. The better collection e ciency is mainly due to the stronger electric eld. 2.3. The simulation results of Vb voltage In order to investigate the effect of Vb voltage on the anode current, the QD-SDD at different Vb voltages has been simulated with 1) the innermost drift ring (V1) has been biased at a xed voltage of -10 V, and 2) the outermost drift rings on both sides (Vn and Vbn) has been biased to -130 V, and 3) the assumption that electrons are generated by x-rays and that the energy of 3.6 eV is required to generate an electronhole pair is used into the model. The QD-SDD shown in Fig.\u00a06 was simulated. The variation of anode pulse current at different Vb voltages is shown in Fig.\u00a07a. The change in instantaneous anode current for the QD-SDD at different Vb voltages is mainly concentrated on the pulse width of the anode current. This phenomenon implies that the change in Vb voltage is different from the change in Vn voltage.\nIn order to analyze the electric eld changes of QD-SDD at different Vb voltages, simulations have been carried out. The cutline along with the electron drift trajectory is drawn. The electric eld at different bias voltages is shown in Fig.\u00a08. The change in the electric eld due to Vb voltage is different from the change due to Vn voltage. It is worthwhile to note that the effect of Vb voltage is not unidirectional. In the horizontal direction, the potential difference between the Vbn electrode and the Vb electrode is reduced as the Vb bias voltage increases, therefore the electric eld (horizontal electric eld) below the drift area decreases. In the vertical direction, the electric eld (vertical electric eld) below the anode area is enhanced for the increased potential difference between the Vb electrode and the V1 electrode. The phenomenon is shown in Fig.\u00a08b. When the distance is less than 500 \u00b5m, the electric eld increases. However, when the distance is greater than 500 \u00b5m, the electric eld decreases.\nThe electron collection time is mainly controlled by the electric eld strength due to the linear relationship between electron drift velocity and the electric eld strength. It is clear that the electron collection time varies with the distribution of the electric eld. The electron collection time of the QD-SDD at different Vb voltages is shown in Fig.\u00a07b. For QD-SDD at higher Vb voltage, the collection time is reduced due to the stronger electric eld below the anode region. It is also important to note that although the electric eld below the drift rings area decreases, the electric eld below the anode area increases with increasing Vb voltage, so the collection time is still reduced because the vertical electric eld is more dominant.\nThe drift path is closely related to the electric eld distribution. The drift trajectory is different due to different bias conditions. Figure\u00a09 displays the drift trajectory of the QD-SDD at different Vb voltages. Therefore, the larger the voltage on the Vb electrode, the closer the electron drift trajectory is to the front surface. To accurately analyze the effect of the Vb voltage, the electron concentration and potential\nPage 7/16\ndistribution along with the cutline at X = 40 \u00b5m are shown in Fig.\u00a010. From the potential distribution in Fig.\u00a010a, it can be observed that the difference in the potential distribution has emerged at different Vb voltages. The detector with a thickness of 525 \u00b5m is not fully depleted when the bias voltage of the Vb electrode is less than 40 V and the depletion region depends on the Vb bias voltage. The comparison of the electric eld (Fig.\u00a08) and the potential distribution (Fig.\u00a010) shows that the lower Vb voltage implies a larger non-depletion region below the anode with a smaller electric eld. The electron concentration in Fig.\u00a010b changes due to the increase of Vb voltage. It can be seen that the drift path is closer to the surface when the Vb voltage increases.\n3. Experiment Results Of Quasi-double-sided Silicon Drift Detector QD-SDDs shown in Fig.\u00a01 were fabricated on a 4-inch n-type wafer with a thickness of 525 \u00b5m and a resistivity of over 10 k\u2126\u00b7cm. The diameter of a QD-SDD is 3.2 mm. In order to verify the effect of the bias conditions on the device performance, the experiments of the QD-SDD under a 55Fe radiative source were measured with: (1) The innermost drift ring (V1) was biased to a xed voltage of -10 V, and the center ring (Vb) on the back was biased at -44 V. (2) The outermost drift rings (Vn and Vbn) on both sides were connected and biased to the same voltage. This measurement was carried out at 213K with a shaping time of 2 \u00b5s. The x-ray spectrum at different Vn voltages is shown in Fig.\u00a011. The QD-SDD at different bias voltages shows different energy resolutions. The detector shows an energy resolution of 210 eV with the Vn bias voltage at -80 V, which is improved to 170 eV with a bias at -130 V or -100 V [13]. The experiment results indicate that the energy resolution is affected by the Vn voltage.\nThe establishment of the electron drift trajectory is also controlled by the bias voltage of the center drift ring on the back side (Vb). The transport characteristics are altered due to the different Vb voltages. The energy resolution of the QD-SDD at different Vb voltages was measured. The innermost drift ring (V1) was biased to a xed voltage of -10 V. The outermost drift rings (Vn and Vbn) on both sides were connected and biased at -130 V. Figure\u00a011b shows the pulse height spectrum at the different Vb voltages. The energy resolution deteriorates as the bias voltage of the back center drift ring increases. The experiment results show that the energy resolution is related to the bias voltage of the Vb electrode.\nQD-SDD used for x-ray detection has two advantages: Firstly, the QD-SDD can be biased at a voltage higher than twice the depletion voltage without the reach-through effect. The electric eld in bulk is enhanced with the increasing potential difference between p+drift rings. As a result, the electron collection time to the anode is reduced. Second, the electron drift path of QD-SDD differs from that of the classical silicon drift detector and is safer for the signal electrons during the drift process because it is farther away from the surface. Therefore, the fewer electrons trapped on the surface, the higher the electron collection e ciency. The better electron collection e ciency and shorter collection time is helpful to achieve a better energy resolution.\nPage 8/16\n4. Conclusion In this work, a novel silicon drift detector, quasi-double-sided SDD (QD-SDD), is proposed to improve the exibility of bias conditions and investigate the effect of bias conditions on energy resolution. Simulations of QD-SDD under irradiated x-rays were performed and the transient current of the anode was obtained. The electrical of the QD-SDD at different bias conditions were analyzed and compared by dealing with the date of the anode current.\nFrom the simulation results, it can be seen that the electric eld in the bulk increases with increasing Vn voltage. A stronger electric eld means a greater electron drift velocity, resulting in shorter drift time and better collection e ciency. The effects of the increasing Vb voltage are considered to be mixed. On the one hand, a larger Vb voltage enhances the vertical electric eld and reduces collection time, on the other hand, a larger Vb voltage leads to a deterioration of the energy resolution. As the Vb voltage increases, the transverse electric eld below the drift region is decreasing, while the longitudinal electric eld below the anode region is increasing. Due to the higher Vb voltage, the collection time is reduced, however, the drift path moves upward, closer to the front surface. The upward shift of the electron drift path results in electrons being trapped at the front surface and the energy resolution decreases.\nCompared with the classical SDD, the QD-SDD has great exibility of bias conditions, and the better electron collection e ciency and shorter drift time is realized when the QD-SDD is under optimized bias conditions. The measurement results also show that better energy resolution of the QD-SDD is realized at optimized bias conditions. The measurement results agree with the device simulation of the QD-SDD.\nDeclarations Acknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFF0709501), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant Nos. 12035020,52072399,62074165,12175305,62104253 and 12105357), Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality (4192064,1212015).\nCredit author statement\nLongjie Wang: Validation, Data Curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Simulated Data, Writing, Original Draft, Writing- Review& Editing,\u00a0\nWei Luo: Mathodology, Data Curation, WritingReview& Editing, Investigation,\nRui Jia: Conceptualization, Data Curation, WritingReview& Editing, Project administration, Investigation\nXing Li: Conceptualization, Data Curation, WritingReview& Editing\nPage 9/16\nXiaorang Tian: Conceptualization, WritingReview& Editing, Project administration,\nMingpeng Zhang: Investigation, Data Curation, Simulated Data\nShuai Jiang: Investigation,\u00a0\nJiawang Chen: Investigation,\u00a0\nChengjian Lin: Investigation,\u00a0\nXiaoping Ouyang:Investigation\nCon icts of interests\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing nancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in uence the work reported in this paper.
