    "abstractText": "The hydrolysate of bitter gourd seed protein, digested by the combined gastrointestinal proteases (BGSP-GPs), exhibited the most potent inhibition on angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) with an IC50 value of 48.1 \u00b1 2.0 \u03bcg/mL. Using two independent bioassay-guided fractionations, fraction F5 from reversed-phase chromatography and fraction S1 from strong cation exchange chromatography exhibited the highest ACE inhibitory (ACEI) activity. Three identical peptides were simultaneously detected from both fractions and, based on the in silico appraisal, APLVSW (AW6) was predicted as a promising ACEI peptide. Their dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) inhibitory (DPP4I) activity was also explored. The IC50 values of AW6 against ACE and DPP4 were calculated to be 9.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 145.4 \u00b1 4.4 \u03bcM, respectively. The inhibitory kinetics and intermolecular interaction studies suggested that AW6 is an ACE competitive inhibitor and a DPP4 non-competitive inhibitor. The quantities of AW6 in BGSP-GP hydrolysate, fractions F5 and S1, were also analyzed using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. Notably, AW6 could resist hydrolysis in the human gastrointestinal tract according to the result of the simulated gastrointestinal digestion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first discovery and characterization of a dual-function (ACEI and DPP4I activities) peptide derived from bitter gourd seed protein.",

            "text": "In a mammal\u2019s blood pressure regulation system, the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves angiotensin I (Ang-I) into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang-II), reducing vasodilation and diuretic effects by altering bradykinin into an inactive form. Simultaneously, ACE2, a homologue of ACE, counteracts the vasoconstrictor effects by converting Ang-II into Ang 1\u20137 (a vasodilator). ACE2 also transforms Ang-I into Ang 1\u20139, and ACE hydrolyzes Ang 1\u20139 into Ang 1\u20137, resulting in a vasodilation effect [1]. However, Ang 1\u20137 has a short half-life of only half an hour in the human body, and its concentration peaks in plasma one hour after intracutaneous injection [2]. Hitherto, the inhibition of ACE has been a pharmaceutical approach for hypertension management. Motivated by the discovery of the first ACE inhibitory (ACEI) drug derived from a Brazilian snake venom peptide (captopril) [3], and the development of commercialized milk drinks containing antihypertensive peptides (such as Ameal S\u2122 by Calpis Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan and Evolus\u2122 by Valio Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) [4], there has been a growing interest in exploring\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1629. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16111629 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1629 2 of 17\nACEI peptides derived from natural protein sources. For instance, ACEI peptides derived from natural protein sources such as scorpion venom [5], calf thymus [6], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [7], animal products (meat, fish, blood, milk, dairy products, and egg) [8], as well as plants (seeds, pulses, mushrooms, and vegetables) [9] have been reported recently. Hypertension patients show a 2\u20133 times higher risk of developing diabetes compared to patients without hypertension [10]. Additionally, the number of youths (those under 20 years old) in the United States with type 2 diabetes is projected to increase by 69% from 2017 to 2060 [11]. To date, various therapeutics for type 2 diabetes have been proposed, including the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4). DPP4 rapidly converts glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) into an inactive form, causing a deficiency in insulin secretion commonly found in type 2 diabetes patients. Inhibiting DPP4 may extend the half-life of incretins and prolong their insulinotropic effect [12]. Researchers have emphasized the potential of peptides derived from food proteins as natural DPP4 inhibitors that may have complementary or additive effects in managing type 2 diabetes. For instance, some natural DPP4 inhibitory (DPP4I) peptides derived from plant or animal proteins, such as dark tea [13], largemouth bass [14], and various vegetables (soy, pea, potato, quinoa, chickpea, lentil, and lupine) [15], have been reported. Diabetes can lead to complications in hypertensive patients, and hypertension can lead to complications in diabetes patients [16]. Therefore, a natural peptide with both ACE and DPP4 inhibitory activity might be beneficial in slowing down the impact of these complications. Bitter gourd is a common vegetable and herb plant in Asia, particularly Taiwan. It has also been recorded as a therapeutic herb that dates back over 2000 years in Chinese materia medica, the Shennong Ben Cao Jing. Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) seeds are a by-product of the bitter gourd food-processing industry, yet they contain relatively high amounts of protein [17]. Previous studies on bitter melon have revealed a wide range of biological activities, e.g., antioxidant, antimycotic, antihyperglycemic, antiobesity, stomachic, anticancer, hypotensive, and anticholesterol activities [18]. Bitter gourd fruit pulp extract has demonstrated hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic patients [19]. In our previous study, bitter gourd seed protein hydrolysate and its derived peptide exhibited ACEI activity and significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rates [20]. However, there has been limited exploration of ACEI peptides with DPP4I activity derived from bitter gourd seed protein derivatives. In this study, ACEI peptides from bitter gourd hydrolysate were screened independently using two liquid chromatography phases: reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography. The peptides from the most active fractions in both RP-HPLC and SCX separations were identified through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) analysis. Identical peptides that were concurrently found in the most active fractions of RP-HPLC and SCX separations were considered ACEI peptide candidates. BIOPEP and PeptideRanker databases were used to appraise the biological activity of ACEI peptide candidates, while the ToxinPred database was employed to predict their toxicity. The ACEI peptide candidate with the highest biological activity score, determined by both BIOPEP and PeptideRanker, was synthesized for further biological activity confirmation and characterization. The IC50 and its inhibition mechanism toward ACE were confirmed. The IC50 against DPP4 and its inhibition mechanism were also determined to explore the potency of this peptide. The molecular-level interaction of an active peptide with ACE and DPP4 was rationalized via molecular docking simulation. Furthermore, the resistance of the peptide toward the simulation of gastrointestinal protease digestion was evaluated, and the quantity of active peptide in hydrolysate and the fractions (RP-HPLC and SCX) were calculated using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode in a liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The discovery of an ACEI peptide with DPP4I activity derived from the bitter gourd seed protein holds promise for enhancing hypertension management in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, this discovery has the potential\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1629 3 of 17\nto increase the value of bitter gourd seeds as a natural source of bioactive peptides. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of an ACEI peptide with DPP4I activity derived from bitter gourd seed protein."

            "text": "A potential ACEI peptide (APLVSW) with DPP4I activity was identified from BGSPGP hydrolysate and screened using two orthogonal bioassay-guided fractionations coupled with in silico analysis. The ACEI and DPP4I IC50 values of APLVSW (AW6) were determined to be 9.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 145.4 \u00b1 4.4 \u00b5M, respectively. According to the molecular docking simulation and inhibition mechanism study, AW6 is a competitive ACEI and a non-competitive DPP4I peptide. The quantities of AW6 in 1 mg of BGSP-GP hydrolysate, fraction F5, and fraction S1 were 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, 9.8 \u00b1 0.3, and 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5g, respectively. Furthermore, AW6 is stable against SGI digestion, which indicates that AW6 might be resistant to the human gastrointestinal tract. This finding suggests that AW6 is promising as a potential ACEI peptide with DPP4I activity that could be beneficial for developing food supplements or therapeutic agents. However, further in vivo and clinical studies are indispensable for verifying the efficacy and bioavailability of this peptide.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16111629/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.-L.H.; methodology, J.-L.H.; validation, C.C.Y.S., M.-L.W. and J.-L.H.; formal analysis, W.-T.H. and C.C.Y.S.; investigation, W.-T.H., C.C.Y.S., M.-L.W. and J.-L.H.; resources, J.-L.H.; data curation, W.-T.H. and C.C.Y.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, W.-T.H. and C.C.Y.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.C.Y.S., M.-L.W. and J.-L.H.; visualization, W.-T.H.; supervision, J.-L.H.; funding acquisition, J.-L.H.
