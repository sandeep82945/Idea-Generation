The D1 domain of flagellin is important for its immunomodulatory function as it contains the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) binding domain [1\u20133]. Flagellin possesses potent adjuvant activity through activating innate immunity and modulating adaptive immune responses via the TLR5-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling [2, 4\u20136]. We have reported that bacterial flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, serves as a versatile adjuvant that can be applied to a wide range of vaccines and immunotherapies [7\u201310]. Post-translation modifications modulate the biological activity of proteins. N- and/or O-glycosylation is important to maintain protein structure, biological activity, molecular stability, solubility, and reduced immunogenicity [11,12]. It has been reported that glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein makes it more virulent by enhancing the binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and evading the immune responses. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens require proper glycosylation for inducing neutralizing antibodies [13,14]. We have shown that the genetic fusion of vaccine antigens with FlaB generates built-in adjuvanted vaccines that induce superior protective immune responses to mixture formulations [7]. Given that prokaryotic expression systems do not provide post-translational glycosylation, for example, a eukaryoticexpression system is required for built-in flagellin-adjuvanted vaccines composed of glycosylated antigens in SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins. In this regard, we first checked TLR5 stimulating activities of eukaryotic expressed FlaB (eFlaB), which should possibly be glycosylated in eukaryotic cells since bioinformatic analysis predicted several glycosylating amino acids. To this end, the codon-optimized flaB gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSectag2B, and transfected into Expi293 cells. His-tagged eFlaB was purified using nickel resin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 1a). eFlaB exhibited increased molecular mass than the calculation based on amino acid contents (Fig. 1a). eFlaB showed significantly attenuated TLR5 stimulating activity in pilot studies. We\nhypothesized that post-translational glycosylation of eFlaB may have interfered with the TLR5 binding since we found putative N-glycosylating amino acid near the TLR5 binding domain. To prove this, we treated WT eFlaB with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and observed that molecular mass decreased and TLR5-stimulating activity was restored (Fig. 1b, c). As for the TLR5 stimulating activities, eFlaB was significantly lower than prokaryotic-expressed FlaB (pFlaB) (eFlaB, EC50 13.83 nM vs pFlaB, EC50 3.32 nM). The PNGase F treatment recovered TLR5stimulating activity (from EC50 13.83 nM to 3.88 nM, Fig. 1c). The defective TLR5-stimulating activity of eFlaB could be attributed to N-glycosylation. We virtually predicted putative N-glycosylating residues in eFlaB using the NetNGlyc-1.0 software (https:// services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetNGlyc-1.0). Five putative glycosylating residues were predicted at N83, N101, N139, N273, and N330. Interestingly, three residues were located near the TLR5 binding domain (N83, N101, N139) (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). We mutated each residue individually and in combinations (Fig. 2a). Corroborating deglycosylation results, the site-directed mutagenesis of N-glycosylating residues resulted in reduced molecular masses and restored TLR5-stimulating activity (Fig. 2b, c). Specifically, single mutation N83A and multiple mutations N83/101A, N83/101/139A, N83/101/139/273A, and N83/101/139/273/330A induced TLR5-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Adding N101A to N83A did not further restore TLR5 stimulating activity while adding N139A, N273A, and N330A to the double mutation (N83/101A) resulted in full recovery of TLR5 stimulating functionality comparable to pFlaB. We also confirmed the N-glycosylation of eFlaB by using the characteristic of ConA that specifically binds with N-glycosylated proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results suggest that glycosylation in distant amino acid residues should have also inhibited the eFlaB-TLR5 interaction (Fig. 2c). Employing a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiment, it was also confirmed that glycosylation interfered with the FlaB-TLR5 binding and deglycosylation resulted in higher affinity binding (Fig. 2d).\n1Clinical Vaccine R&D Center, Chonnam National University, Hwasun-gun, Jeonnam, Republic of Korea. 2Combinatorial Tumor Immunotherapy MRC, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun-gun, Jeonnam, Republic of Korea. 3Immunotherapy Innovation Center, Hwasun-gun, Jeonnam, Republic of Korea. 4Department of Microbiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun-gun, Jeonnam, Republic of Korea. 5Department of Pharmacology and Dental Therapeutics, School of Dentistry, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea. 6Department of Chemistry, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea. \u2709email: selee@chonnam.ac.kr; jhrhee@chonnam.ac.kr\nwww.nature.com/npjvaccines\nPublished in partnership with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () :,;\nWe then tested the adjuvant activity of the mutated variants in a murine influenza vaccination model. Briefly, BALB/c mice were intranasally immunized with split H1N1 (sH1N1) antigen alone or in combination with FlaB variants (Fig. 2e). Compared to the eFlaBadjuvanted group, the N-glycosylation site mutation variants significantly potentiated sH1N1-specific antibody response as comparable level to pFlaB (Fig. 2f). Of note, eFlaB variants showed a similar level of in vivo adjuvanticity, while their in vitro TLR5 stimulating activities were less in N83A and N83/101A variants, suggesting possible deglycosylation in vivo. Interestingly, in contrast to pFlaB, eFlaB variants did not induce recognizable pFlaB- or eFlaB-specific antibodies (Fig. 2g, h). This result indicates that eFlaB variants do not stimulate B cell responses as deimmunized pFlaB did [15]. Eukaryotic post-translational modifications other than glycosylation may have made eFlaB hypoimmunogenic, which requires further clarification. Here, we showed that FlaB manufactured in eukaryotic cells was glycosylated and defective in TLR5 binding (Fig. 2d), suggesting that glycans around the TLR5 binding domain interfered with FlaB interaction with FlaB-TLR5 interaction. Glycan removal either by deglycosylating enzyme or mutating putative N-glycosylation residues restored the TLR5 stimulating functionality. The present findings enable the use of mutated eFlaBs for the development of all-in-one flagellin-adjuvanted protein vaccines that require glycosylation to generate a protective immune response. The variant FlaB sequences could be used for DNA/mRNA vaccines designed to express all-in-one flagellin adjuvanted fusion antigens in vivo. Among putative N-glycosylation target residue, N83 appeared to play a dominant role in inhibiting FlaB from binding to TLR5 since the single mutation N83A could provide sufficient adjuvanticity of eFlaB in inducing sH1N1-specific antibody responses. Moreover, multiple site-directed mutations on N-glycosylation residues (N83/101A, N83/101/139A, N83/101/139/273A, and N83/ 101/139/273/330A) also restored the adjuvanticity of eFlaB to the same level as single mutation N83A in a murine influenza vaccine model (Fig. 2f). However, multiple mutations without N83A (N139/ 273/330A) failed to restore eFlaB induced TLR5-activation (Fig. 2c), corroborating the hypothesis that glycosylation near the TLR5 binding domain interfered with the receptor-ligand interaction. We also found that eFlaB and its variants made discrete structures and remained stable even under room temperature as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and NF-\u03baB reporter assay (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nPreviously we showed that pFlaB could be de-immunized by deleting 19 amino acid B cell epitopes [15]. Here we show that eFlaB variants did not induce FlaB-specific antibody responses without deletion of the immunogenic epitope. Other posttranslational modifications than N-glycosylation may have masked immunogenic B cell epitopes. Thus, eFlaB variants would be more suitable for vaccine and immunotherapeutic developments."

The flaB gene was amplified by PCR reaction using forward primer, 5\u2019- CCCAAGCTTGCCGTCAACGTGAACACCAA-3\u2019 containing HindIII (AAGCTT) site and reverse primer, 5\u2019-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCGCCCAGCAGGGAGAGGGCGC-3\u2019 containing NotI (GCGGCCGC) site. The amplified flaB and eukaryotic expression vector pSectag2B (Invitrogen, V900-20) were digested by restriction enzymes HindIII and NotI at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Then, we ligated the flaB with the pSectag2B vector by T4 DNA ligase (enzynomics, M001S) at room temperature for 2 h. The ligated plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells and spread onto an LB agar plate containing ampicillin (Supplementary Table 1). The sequence was confirmed by the Macrogen online sequencing system (http:// dna.macrogen.com/kor/).\nDNA transfection, protein purification, and characterization The mammalian cell line Expi293TM is obtained from Thermofisher Scientific. DNA transfection was done using ExpiFectamine following the manufacturer protocol (Thermofisher, A14635). Briefly, the Expi293TM cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C, 8% CO2, and 125 rpm shaking speed of incubator (eppendorf, S41I230011) till three or more passages before transfection. On the day of transfection (day 1), 3 \u00d7 106 Expi293TM cells/ml were seeded and transfected with purified pSectag2B plasmids containing the flaB gene. On day 2, enhancer I and enhancer II were added and cultured until day 4. On day 4, we transferred the culture medium to harvest bottles and centrifuged at 35,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 10x lysis buffer (500mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 M NaCl, and 100mM imidazole, pH= 8) in a ratio of 9:1. The mixture was added to the equilibrated Niken column containing 3ml of Ni-NTA agarose bead (Qiagen, 30230), for 30 ml of the protein mixture, at 4 \u00b0C. To remove the nonspecific proteins, the column was washed with washing buffer I (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, and 10mM imidazole, pH=8) and washing buffer II (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 20mM Imidazole, pH= 8). The protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl and 250mM imidazole, pH= 8) at room temperature for 15 min. The buffer was changed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using centrifugal filter tubes (Merck, UFC801024). The recombinant eFlaB protein purity was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent Western blot analysis using anti-FlaB antibody generated in mice using complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma, CAS9007-81-2) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse polyclonal secondary antibody (Dako, P0260)."

We calculated the EC50 by using triplicate OD620 nm values for each concentration of protein. To determine the biological activity of deglycosylated eFlaB variants (Supplementary Fig. 3b), we performed in vitro NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter assay using HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM medium (GibcoTM, 11995-065) comprising 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of antibiotics (GibcoTM, 15140122) at 37 \u00b0C, and 5% CO2. At least 3 passages of cells were used for the NF-\u03baB reporter assay.
