 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the background and results presented in the paper:

1. Develop algorithms to automate identification of O-linked glycans. The current GlyKAn AZ app focuses only on N-linked glycans. Expanding the capabilities to also characterize O-linked glycans would broaden the app's usefulness. This would require building databases of common O-linked glycan core structures and developing fragmentation pattern recognition algorithms specific to O-linked glycans.

2. Incorporate additional ion dissociation techniques like ETD and ECD. The current app relies on CID and HCD fragmentation which produce B and Y ions. Adding capabilities for other ion types like C and Z ions could provide more structural information and help distinguish isomers. This would require expanding the fragment generation algorithms.

3. Build statistical models to score glycan identification confidence. The app currently outputs statistics like % of fragments identified, but more robust statistical models could be developed to provide a confidence score for each glycan identification. This could help analysts better judge the accuracy of the app's identifications.

4. Expand the software to process and identify glycopeptides. The current app analyzes released glycans, but modifying it to also characterize glycans attached to glycopeptides could give information about site-specific glycosylation. This would require significantly altering the algorithms and databases.

5. Develop a cloud-based version of the app. Transitioning GlyKAn AZ into a cloud-based software that could accept data uploads and run analyses on remote servers would make the app more accessible. This would allow users to avoid MATLAB installation and leverage remote computing power.
