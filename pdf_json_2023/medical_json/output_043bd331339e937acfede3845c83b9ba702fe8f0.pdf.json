Although a temporary pacemaker and intravenous amiodarone were introduced, she subsequently went into cardiopulmonary arrest by ventricular fibrillation. After the return of spontaneous circulation, Impella cardiac power (CP) was introduced because of sustained hypotension and severely impaired left ventricular contraction. High-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy was simultaneously introduced. Her atrioventricular conduction and left ventricular contraction drastically improved. Impella CP was successfully removed after 4 days of support. She was eventually administered steroid maintenance therapy and discharged.\nDiscussion We report a case of CS with fulminant haemodynamic collapse treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy under Impella assistance for acute haemodynamic support. Although CS has been known as an inflammatory disease with progressive cardiac dysfunction and rapid deterioration due to fatal arrhythmias, it can be improved with steroid therapy. It was suggested that strong haemodynamic support by Impella could be a bridge to manifest the effects after introducing steroid therapy to patients with CS. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keywords Cardiac sarcoidosis \u2022 Cardiogenic shock \u2022 Impella \u2022 Steroid therapy \u2022 Atrioventricular block \u2022 Positron emission tomography \u2022 Case report - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ESC Curriculum 2.2 Echocardiography \u2022 5.6 Ventricular arrhythmia \u2022 5.7 Bradycardia \u2022 6.4 Acute heart failure \u2022 6.5 Cardiomyopathy\nLearning points \u2022 Cardiac sarcoidosis occasionally disrupts circulatory haemodynamics because of arrhythmia or cardiac dysfunction. \u2022 A combination therapy using mechanical circulatory support and pulse intravenous corticosteroid to treat a patient presenting with cardio-\ngenic shock was suggested.\n* Corresponding author.

            "text": "A 70-year-old woman (height, 155 cm; weight 37 kg), who had no medical history, presented with uveitis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1A). She was referred to the cardiology department with worsening exertional dyspnoea and syncope. Electrocardiography showed a complete atrioventricular block (Figure 2A) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (Figure 2B), whereas echocardiography showed a thinned basal antero/inferoseptum and mildly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 50% (see Supplementary material online, Video S1). She was admitted for expedited workup and treatment.\nThe patient was diagnosed with CS according to the clinical diagnosis group criteria3 based on the following additive findings: high serum angiotensin-converting enzyme [27.0 U/L; normal range (NR) 8.3\u201321.4 U/L], serum lysozyme (10.6 \u03bcg/mL; NR 5.0\u201310.2 \u03bcg/mL), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (555 U/mL; NR 122\u2013496 U/mL) levels; abnormal accumulation in the bilateral hilar lymphnodes and intraventricular wall on gallium-67 scintigraphy; abnormal accumulation in the lateral left ventricular (LV) wall and intraventricular septum on 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET; Figure 3); and positive late gadolinium enhancement of the myocardium, basal antero/inferoseptum, mid anterior, and mid inferior LV wall on magnetic resonance imaging.\nAfter admission, a temporary pacemaker (mode: VVI; lower rate, 80 b.p.m.) was placed, and intravenous amiodarone was administered for the complete atrioventricular block and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia presenting with syncope. On hospital Day 2, she experienced cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and a return to spontaneous circulation after defibrillation (Figure 2C). A newly negative T wave and QT prolongation were observed on electrocardiography (Figure 2D). Echocardiography showed marked wall hypokinesia in the mid-LV apex (see Supplementary material online, Video S2). The LVEF was reduced to 22%. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis or occlusion. However, low cardiac output of 2.0 L/min and an elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 20 mmHg were observed, whereas the right atrial pressure was within the normal range (5 mmHg). She presented a persistently low blood pressure of 61/ 44 (mean, 50) mmHg despite the intravenous administration of dobutamine (maximum dose, 3 \u03bcg/kg/min), milrinone (maximum dose, 0.25 \u03bcg/ kg/min), and noradrenaline (maximum dose, 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min). The patient\u2019s serum lactate level was elevated at 5.9 mmoL/L (NR 0.44\u2013 1.78 mmoL/L). We decided to introduce an Impella cardiac power (CP) device (Figures 1B and 4). Her haemodynamics improved immediately thereafter: blood pressure, 93/73 (mean, 80) mmHg; cardiac output, 3.7 L/min; and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, 15 mmHg. Her serum lactate level decreased to 1.3 mmoL/L.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical course is shown in Figure 4. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, 1000 mg/day) were administered along with the introduction of the Impella device. One day after the steroid therapy (Day 3), atrioventricular conduction was improved as confirmed with a first-degree atrioventricular block (PQ interval, 520 ms) and a complete right bundle branch block. On hospital Day 4, the QRS morphology was normalized, and the PQ interval was further shortened to 500 ms. The steroids were switched to oral prednisolone (40 mg/day) and weekly tapered to 30 mg/day. The PQ interval improved to 304 ms at discharge (Day 40; Figure 2D). The LV wall motion also drastically improved after the introduction of the Impella device and steroids. On hospital Day 3, the impaired wall motion in the mid-LV to the apex improved, and the global LVEF was 38% (see Supplementary material online, Video S3). On hospital Day 6, the patient was weaned from the ventilator and Impella device. Her LVEF improved to 45% on hospital Day 9 and 50% at discharge (see Supplementary material online, Video S4). The B-type natriuretic peptide level decreased from 235 pg/dL (NR <18.4 pg/mL) on admission to 120 pg/dL, and 25 pg/dL on hospital Day 9 and at discharge, respectively. Finally, she was\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ehjcr/article/7/2/ytad045/7017998 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nFigure 1 Chest radiography (A) on admission (Day 0) and (B) after introducing the Impella cardiac power device (Day 2). Chest radiography revealed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ehjcr/article/7/2/ytad045/7017998 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\ndischarged with the concomitant introduction of bisoprolol, spironolactone, and candesartan as heart failure medications and a wearable defibrillator to prevent sudden cardiac death. No apparent cardiac symptoms were observed during discharge. Because pacing was no longer required, no recurrence of ventricular tachycardia was observed, and the LVEF improved after the introduction of steroid therapy, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was not placed; rather; thus, a wearable defibrillator was indicated. Follow-up 18F-FDG-PET showed complete disappearance of abnormal accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes and myocardium (Figure 3). Magnetic resonance imaging performed before discharge showed that the residually positive late gadolinium enhancement of the myocardium was lower than at pre-treatment. No significant ventricular arrhythmia recurrence or reduced cardiac functions were noted. As the patient strongly rejected implantable devices, the wearable defibrillator was removed without conversion to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator at 3 months of post-discharge. The patient received maintenance steroid therapy with oral prednisolone.\nDiscussion This report presents a fulminant case of CS that resulted in the occurrence of complete atrioventricular block, fatal ventricular arrhythmias, and severe LV wall motion abnormalities leading to cardiogenic shock. Combined treatment involving a temporary pacemaker, an Impella CP device, and a high dose of intravenous corticosteroids was performed simultaneously. Immediately thereafter, the atrioventricular conduction and LV wall motion drastically improved, and the patient recovered from the cardiogenic shock.\nSarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease. Cardiac involvement is a known prognostic factor in sarcoidosis, accounting for 85% of deaths.4 The outcomes of patients with CS greatly vary depending on the presence or absence of steroid therapy.5 In CS, the early initiation of steroid therapy prevents the progression of LVEF decrement and reduces the risk of fatal arrhythmias.1 Conversely, steroid therapy is less effective in patients with a markedly reduced LVEF.6 The reduced LVEF dramatically improved after introducing the steroid therapy. This might be due to the highly inflammatory sarcoid lesions that respond to steroid therapy. The atrioventricular block in CS can be improved by steroid therapy.7 High-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy dramatically improved the atrioventricular conduction. Although evidence of the effectiveness of corticosteroid pulse therapy is lacking, it may still be considered for patients with rapidly progressive disease.2 Broad cardiac accumulation, as revealed by 18F-FDG-PET and rapid progression of arrhythmias, indicated that the inflammatory activity of CS was significantly high. The effectiveness of corticosteroid pulse therapy is suggested in patients with CS, severe inflammation, and fulminant clinical course. Follow-up imaging is useful for assessing the disease activity in CS. Follow-up 18F-FDG-PET and magnetic resonance imaging revealed diminished myocardial inflammation and damage after steroid therapy.\nThis case report describes the haemodynamic support using an Impella device in a patient with CS. The Impella is a percutaneous circulatory support device capable of LV venting and increasing the aortic flow rate. Increasing the mean blood pressure and cardiac output and simultaneously decreasing the LV end-diastolic pressure can treat cardiogenic shock caused by LV failure.8 In this case, low cardiac output due to LV dysfunction was observed, whereas right ventricular failure\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ehjcr/article/7/2/ytad045/7017998 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nwas not complicated. Haemodynamics using an Impella device simultaneously with steroid therapy may be effective for patients with fulminant CS. Cardiac sarcoidosis is occasionally characterized by right ventricular failure. Remarkably, patients with advanced right ventricular failure may require venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Furthermore, the use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to heart transplantation should be considered in cases of poor response to steroid therapy.9 Cardiogenic shock may have also been associated with complicated Takotsubo syndrome due to new electrocardiographic changes and LV wall motion abnormalities that occurred after cardiogenic shock. Cardiac sarcoidosis reportedly occasionally presents wall motion abnormalities like Takotsubo syndrome.10 In patients with Takotsubo syndrome and cardiogenic shock, the use of catecholamines should be minimized, and mechanical circulatory support is recommended.11 Considering the aspect of high-risk Takotsubo syndrome, the Impella device effectively intervened appropriately to provide haemodynamic support in the acute phase.\nIn this case, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was not introduced; rather, a temporary wearable defibrillator was placed. However, following the current guidelines, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are highly recommended for non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, including CS with a reduced LVEF, history of ventricular fibrillation, and no reversible factors, such as electrolyte abnormalities.12,13 On this premise, the patient should be considered a candidate for an implantable pacing device with a cardioverter-defibrillator; however, as the patient strongly rejected implantable devices, a wearable defibrillator was prescribed at discharge. The decision not to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was based on the patient\u2019s choice and should not be generalized.\nConclusions Cardiac sarcoidosis occasionally disrupts circulatory haemodynamics due to arrhythmia or cardiac dysfunction. Here, we reported a therapeutic approach using an Impella device and pulse intravenous corticosteroid to treat a CS patient presenting with cardiogenic shock.\nLead author biography Miho Hashimura is a resident physician at the Kitasato University Hospital in Sagamihara, Japan.
