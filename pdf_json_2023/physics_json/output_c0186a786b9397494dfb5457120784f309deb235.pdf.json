    "abstractText": "Natural products serve as a valuable reservoir of anticancer agents. Chinese poplar propolis (CP) has exhibited remarkable antitumor activities, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain elusive. This study aims to elucidate the in vitro cytotoxic mechanisms of CP in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) through comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our evidence suggested that CP possesses a great potential to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells by targeting the glucose metabolism. Notably, CP exhibited a doseand time-dependent reduction in the viability of HepG2 cells. Transcriptome sequencing unveiled significant alterations in the cellular metabolism, particularly within glucose metabolism pathways. CP effectively restrained glucose consumption and lactic acid production. Moreover, the CP treatment led to a substantial decrease in the mRNA expression levels of key glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) and glycolytic enzymes (LDHA, HK2, PKM2, and PFK). Correspondingly, CP suppressed some key protein levels. Cellular metabolomic analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in intermediary products of glucose metabolism, specifically fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and acetyl-CoA, following CP administration. Finally, key compounds in CP were screened, and apigenin, pinobanksin, pinocembrin, and galangin were identified as potential active agents against glycolysis. It indicates that the effectiveness of propolis in inhibiting liver cancer is the result of the combined action of several components. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of propolis in the treatment of liver cancer by targeting glycolytic pathways.",

            "text": "Malignant tumors pose a serious threat to human health, with liver cancer ranking as the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. Infections with the Hepatitis B and C viruses are major risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis linked with chronic illnesses has become a more prominent risk factor for liver cancer in the Western world in recent years [2]. Targeted therapeutic drugs for liver cancer include sorafenib, regorafenib, sunitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and bevacizumab. These drugs can target specific molecules or signaling pathways in cancer cells to inhibit their growth, infiltration, and metastasis [3]. However, these targeted chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic and prone to drug-resistant phenotypes. Therefore, it is important to search for anticancer drugs in natural products and analyze their mechanisms of action for cancer treatment.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 4329. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15204329 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 4329 2 of 20\nPropolis is a resinous substance collected by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) by mixing the exudates from plant resin [4]. The chemical composition of propolis is highly complex and variable due to the raw materials that are collected by the honeybees. There are different types of propolis around the world, including green Brazilian propolis (mainly from Baccharis dracunculifolia), European propolis (Populus nigra L.), red Brazilian propolis (Dalbergia ecastophyllum), Russian propolis (Betula verrucosa Ehrh), and Cuban and Venezuelan red propolis (Clusia spp.) [4]. More than 600 compositions have been identified from different types of propolis [4,5]. Chinese propolis mainly belongs to the \u201cPopulus\u201d propolis, which predominantly contains phenolic acids and flavonoids [5]. Propolis has a broad range of biological activities, such as antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antitumor activities, etc. [6\u20138]. The antitumor effects of propolis have attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years, with studies indicating that Chinese propolis in particular has excellent antitumor activity; however, its mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood [9\u201311]. Abnormal metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and tumor cells are metabolically reprogrammed to meet the energy and biomolecules required for malignant proliferation and metastasis [12]. The Warburg effect has been demonstrated as a marker of energy metabolism in several types of tumor cells [12\u201314]. Aerobic glycolysis in cells regulates their metabolism to ensure an adequate supply of ATP, facilitating the adaptation of cells to altered survival conditions and their rapid proliferation. This enhances the tolerance of tumor cells to harsh conditions and increases their growth [13]. The glycolytic capacity of cancer cells is 20\u201330 times higher than that of normal cells, and this high rate of glycolysis leads to the rapid production of ATP, while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) converts the majority of the generated pyruvate into lactate in the cytoplasm [15]. These acidic products change the tumor microenvironment, which is conducive to tumor invasion and infiltration, as well as the inhibition of the activity and function of tumor immune effector cells [15]. Therefore, targeting the aerobic glycolysis of tumor cells can selectively inhibit tumor cell proliferation and development. Aerobic-glycolysis-related transport proteins and key enzymes are involved in cell development. An increasing number of studies identified a significant upregulation of the expression of glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs) in tumor cells, particularly GLUT1 and GLUT3 overexpression in a variety of solid tumors. When glucose crosses the cell membrane into the cytoplasm, it undergoes phosphorylation to form glucose-6-phosphate, which initiates glycolysis. The activity and protein expression levels of key glycolytic enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), hexokinase II (HK2), M2 pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and phosphofructokinase (PFK), are significantly upregulated in cells [16,17]. The inhibition of GLUT and key glycolytic enzymes of the glucose metabolism by smallmolecule inhibitors or RNAi can slow the growth of many tumor cells [17]. Propolis has excellent antitumor activity, but the effects of propolis on the cell metabolism, especially glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in liver cancer cells, remain unknown. In the present study, based on transcriptomics and cell metabolomics, we explored these effects to further elucidate the antitumor mechanisms of propolis."

Additionally, the absolute value of logarithmic fold changes \u2265 1 and t-test p-values < 0.05 were taken as the thresholds for selecting DEGs. A total of 223 DEGs were upregulated and 477 DEGs were downregulated in the propolis-treated group compared to the control group; the results are shown Figure 2A. This indicates that the propolis-treated group was significantly different against the control group. These genes may be the target genes regulated by CP in HepG2 cells. To gain insights into the function of these significantly altered DEGs, GO enrichment analysis was performed, especially at the biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and cellular component (CC) levels. As shown in Figure 2B, the three most representative Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the CC domain were \u201ccell\u201d, \u201ccell part\u201d, and \u201cintracellular.\u201d The top three GO terms in the MF domain were \u201cbinding\u201d, \u201cprotein binding\u201d, and \u201cion binding\u201d, while the five most enriched GO terms in the BP domain were \u201ccellular process\u201d, \u201csingle-organism process\u201d, \u201csingle-organism cellular process biological regulation\u201d, and \u201cmetabolic process\u201d, suggesting that CP may affect the cellular metabolism of HepG2 cells.

Propolis has significant anticancer properties; flavonoids mainly exert an antitumor effect [26\u201328], but whether propolis affects the tumor cell metabolism remains unclear. Here, for the first time, we found that propolis interferes with the metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, especially the glycolysis pathway, inhibiting the expression of glucose transporter proteins and key glycolysis enzymes, downregulating intermediate metabolites, and ultimately inhibiting the malignant proliferation of liver cancer cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that propolis and its components have the ability to inhibit various types of cancers, such as breast, colon, brain, skin, and blood cancers [29]. This study found that low doses of CP did not affect the viability and proliferation of HepG2 cells, but medium and high doses of CP showed a significant inhibitory effect. These results are consistent with previous research where the cell proliferation of HCC-LM3 cells was\nNutrients 2023, 15, 4329 16 of 20\nsignificantly inhibited after the intervention of high doses of chrysin, the main component of propolis [30]. Previous studies have shown that propolis can suppress the cell cycle, induce apoptosis, autophagy, and antiangiogenic activity, and modulate the tumor inflammatory microenvironment [31,32]. Additionally, propolis has been found to inhibit tumor cell proliferation through various signal pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT, TLR4NF-\u03baB, VEGF, and TGF\u03b2 [33]. However, these studies were not able to fully reveal the antitumor mechanisms of propolis. Propolis is a complex with multiple efficacy components, and its antitumor efficacy also reflects the characteristics of multiple pathways and targets. In the field of human health, transcriptome sequencing is gaining traction as a tool to identify therapeutic targets for diseases [34,35]. Transcriptome sequencing provides a more comprehensive understanding of the antitumor efficacy of propolis by revealing the genes and signaling pathways that propolis may regulate. A transcriptome analysis revealed that CP treatment resulted in significant changes in the expression of 700 mRNAs and exerted antihepatocarcinogenic effects, mainly by affecting ion binding and the cellular metabolism, especially the glucose metabolism. Mammalian cells require an active energy metabolism to survive. Glucose monosaccharide enters the cell via the glucose transporter and initiates glycolysis as a significant source of cellular energy [36]. Lactate, a product of glycolysis, promotes stromal degradation, facilitates tumor metastasis, and evades immune surveillance [36]. Our results show that CP treatment significantly inhibits the production of lactic acid for the cellular consumption of glucose. This tentatively suggests that CP can inhibit aerobic glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and a similar phenomenon was observed in Licochalcone Atreated gastric cancer cells [37]. Next, we examined the effects of CP on GLUT1 and GLUT3 at transcriptional levels, showing that high concentrations of CP significantly inhibited the gene expressions of GLUT1/3. Quercetin, as a competitive inhibitor of GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake, is shown to have anticancer effects at elevated concentrations [38]. The development of HCC is highly correlated with the glucose metabolism. High glucose levels can cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) to build up, and surplus ROS can bind to DNA and cause the formation of HCC [39]. One-third of the genes involved in the glucose metabolism are continuously dysregulated, which is linked to the poor prognosis of HCC [40]. In normal cells, glycolysis converts one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules and generates ATP. Depending on the oxygen supply, pyruvate is either oxidized to carbon dioxide and water through the TCA cycle or, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate produces lactate [41]. In contrast, tumor cells preferentially undergo glycolysis to produce lactate, even under aerobic conditions; this metabolic reprogramming is known as the Warburg effect. To produce energy quickly in cancer cells, glycolysis is preferred over the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and OXPHOS intermediates, including ATP, citrate, and ROS, negatively control three irreversible steps of glycolysis [42]. Thus, minimal dependence on OXPHOS is well suited in tumor cells [43\u201345]. Our previous studies show that tumor cells, including liver cancer cells treated with propolis, exhibit significantly higher levels of ROS, which may also be one of the reasons why propolis inhibits the glycolytic process [9]. The regulation of the key glycolytic enzymes in cancer cells is another important factor of propolis inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. Glycolysis is the first step of the glucose metabolism, consisting of ten enzymatic steps and three irreversible catalyzed reactions. HK2, PFK, and PKM2 catalyze three irreversible processes that are important regulatory points in the glycolytic process [46]. Enzyme activity can be altered in a variety of ways, such as inhibition brought on by an excess of metabolites, the phosphorylation of the enzyme, and transcription-induced changes in the enzyme concentration [46]. HK2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells, and studies have shown that HK2 ablation delays lung and breast tumor progression [47], while HK2 silencing reinstates the flux of pyruvate to the TCA cycle and suppresses aerobic glycolysis, contributing to tumor therapy [48]. Licochalcone A reduces the levels of Akt in two different types of gastric cancer cells to inhibit HK2-mediated tumor glycolysis [37]. PFK\nNutrients 2023, 15, 4329 17 of 20\nhas two isoforms, PFK1 and PFK2, both of which are post-translationally modified in cancer cells [49]. The knockdown of PFK2 in breast cancer cells accumulates ROS to induce apoptosis [50]. It has been demonstrated that PFK expression and activity are inhibited by epigallocatechin-3-gallate in hepatocellular cancer cells [51]. PK has four isoforms\u2014 PKM1, PKM2, PKL, and PKR. PKM2 is favored by tumor cells [52], making it a target for antitumor treatment [53]. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes a reversible reaction, converting pyruvate into lactate, and the high-speed conversion of glucose to lactate results in elevated GLUTs in glucose uptake [54,55]. LDHA is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells, and the silencing of RNAi causes apoptosis to occur in liver cancer due to increased ROS production [56]. Wogonin treatment inhibits the action of LDHA in human gastric cancer and lung adenocarcinoma cells [57]. Increased aerobic glycolysis is the hallmark of tumors. This study shows that propolis can target the glucose metabolism by decreasing the levels of glycolytic key enzymes, such as HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDHA. Among the multiple signaling pathways regulated by propolis, the modulation of metabolic pathways is the most significant. Based on metabolomics, principal component analysis plots showed a clear separation between sample points, suggesting that CP treatment had a greater effect on the metabolism of HepG2 cells. Additionally, altered tumor cell metabolism is a prominent feature of tumorigenesis and development [58]; thus, propolis might target the tumor cell metabolism to inhibit liver cancer cell proliferation. The results regarding cell metabolism further demonstrate that propolis modulates the tumor cell metabolism, including the citrate cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, one carbon metabolism, and the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Under the intervention of CP, the content of intermediate products of glycolysis, such as FBP and acetyl-CoA, significantly decreased. In addition to the rapid production of ATP, intermediates of glycolysis are also precursors for the synthesis of many biomolecules, such as amino acids and lipids [46]. Cell proliferation involves the de novo synthesis of many biomolecules, and acetyl-CoA is a pivotal substance in the metabolism of energy substances in the body [59]. CP intervention leads to a reduction in acetyl-CoA levels, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of biomacromolecules, and thus cell proliferation. The molecular docking results revealed that all seven propolis actives had a strong binding capacity with key glycolysis enzymes, with apigenin, pinobanksin, pinocembrin, and galangin being the best. Previous research found that all four flavonoids suppressed HepG2 cell survival [9]. Apigenin has been demonstrated to decrease GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA production in tumor cells [60,61], and galangin has been shown to bind to the PKM2 site [62]. Combining these four flavonoids with glycolysis may give us with a fresh perspective on propolis\u2019s antitumor activity, which can be examined further in future studies. Thus, CP is a polyphenol mixture with a broad range of targets, and its antitumor activity exceeds that of a single component, implying that propolis targets glycolysis for its anticancer efficacy as a result of the combined action of several components."

            "text": "The distinguishing features of the tumor cell metabolism include increased glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis, leading to the conversion of glucose into lactate. In our current investigation, by utilizing transcriptomics and metabolomics, we found that propolis has the potential to modulate the tumor cell metabolism, especially the glucose metabolism, by suppressing glucose consumption, glucose transporter proteins, glycolytic key enzymes, intermediate metabolites, and lactate production, ultimately resulting in inhibited cell proliferation. This could be due to the combined activity of several propolis components.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu15204329/s1, Table S1: Sequences of the primers for qRT-PCR; Table S2: TOP 100 components in ethanol extract of propolis by HPLC-QTOF-MC; Figure S1.
