Exploration of Other Potential Bioactivities of Milk-Derived Peptides: Since the identified milk-derived cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have demonstrated an ability to be internalized into cells without affecting NF-ÎºB activation or the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, future research could explore other potential bioactivities. This could include investigating the peptides' effects on other signaling pathways, cell differentiation processes, or their potential to modulate autophagy, apoptosis, or cellular metabolism. Such studies could uncover new therapeutic applications for these peptides.

Development of Milk-Derived Peptides as Drug Delivery Systems: Given their cell-penetrating properties without inducing toxicity or inflammation, these peptides could be further studied as carriers for the delivery of therapeutic agents into cells. Research could focus on conjugating these peptides with drugs, siRNA, or other bioactive molecules to assess their efficiency and specificity in delivering cargo into targeted cells or tissues. This line of research could lead to the development of novel drug delivery systems with improved safety profiles.

Investigation of Milk-Derived CPPs in Disease Models: The next step could involve evaluating the therapeutic potential of these peptides in disease models, particularly those involving disorders where cell penetration and modulation of non-inflammatory pathways could be beneficial. For example, models of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, or metabolic disorders could be used to assess the peptides' efficacy in modulating disease-related pathways or as carriers for disease-specific therapeutics.

Elucidation of Mechanisms Underlying the Cell-Penetrating Behavior of Milk-Derived Peptides: Further research could aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-penetrating behavior of these peptides. This would involve studying the interaction of peptides with cell membranes, the role of specific amino acids in penetration efficiency, and the pathways (e.g., endocytosis, direct translocation) through which peptides enter cells. Understanding these mechanisms could inform the design of improved CPPs or the identification of new therapeutic targets.

Assessment of the Effects of Milk-Derived Peptides on Gut Health and the Microbiome: Considering the origin of these peptides and their resistance to digestion, investigating their impact on gut health and the microbiome could be valuable. This could include studying their effects on intestinal barrier function, immune responses in the gut, and interactions with gut microbiota. Such research could reveal novel roles of milk-derived peptides in gut health, potentially leading to the development of new nutraceuticals or therapies for gastrointestinal diseases.
