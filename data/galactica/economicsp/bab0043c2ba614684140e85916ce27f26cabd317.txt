conclusion The question of acceptability is foundational for the development of interventions that build supportive systems for ending TB in Vietnam and in other LMICs. Cash transfers are one mechanism of social protection that has the potential to address the social consequences and determinants of TB. We conclude that this cash transfer UHC+ intervention which delivered both UCT and CCT was acceptable to beneficiaries, implementers and policy stakeholders in Vietnam.
