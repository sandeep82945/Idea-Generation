Our analysis uses a complete and realistic accounting of systematic errors from both theory and experiment and considers the potential of both proton and deuteron beams for a wide range of energies and luminosities. We also consider what can be learned from a possible future positron beam and a potential tenfold luminosity upgrade of the EIC beyond its initial decade of running. We use the SM effective field theory (SMEFT) framework to parametrize BSM effects and focus on semileptonic fourfermion operators, whereas for our precision EW study, we determine how well the EIC can measure the weak mixing angle. New features of our study include the use of an up-to-date detector design of the EIC Comprehensive Chromodynamics Experiment and accurate running conditions of the EIC, the simultaneous fitting of beam polarization uncertainties and Wilson coefficients to improve the sensitivity to SMEFT operators, and the inclusion of the weak mixing angle running in our fit template. We find that the EIC can probe BSM operators at scales competitive with and in many cases exceeding LHC Drell-Yan bounds while simultaneously not suffering from degeneracies between Wilson coefficients.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.016006\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics currently describes all known laboratory phenomena. All particles predicted by the SMhave now been found after the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). No new particles beyond those present in the SM have been discovered and no appreciable deviation from SM predictions has been conclusively observed. Despite the enormous success of this theory, it contains numerous shortcomings. It does not contain an explanation of the dark matter observed in the universe or of the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, and it does not describe neutrino masses. It additionally suffers from several aesthetic issues, such as the hierarchy problem and an extreme hierarchy of fermion Yukawa couplings. Even the sectors of the theory that have been experimentally successful still contain unsatisfying and poorly understood features. For example, the exact composition of the proton\nspin in terms of the spin and orbital angular momentum of its constituent quarks and gluons is still poorly known. Numerous experimental programs that attempt to address these residual issues in our understanding of nature are either running or being designed. Our focus in this manuscript will be on the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. The EIC will be a particle accelerator that collides electrons with protons and nuclei in the intermediate-energy range between fixed-target scattering facilities and high-energy colliders. It will provide luminosity orders of magnitude higher than HERA, the only electron-proton collider operated to date. It will also be the first lepton-ion collider with the ability to polarize both the electron and the proton (ion) beams and the first collider with a fast spin-flip capacity. These unique design featureswill allowdirect extraction of parity-violating (PV) asymmetries in the electroweak neutral-current (NC) scattering cross section associated with either the electron, A\u00f0e\u00dePV, or the proton (ion) spin flip, A \u00f0p\u00f0D\u00de\u00de PV . Experimental uncertainties from effects such as luminosity measurement and detector acceptance or efficiency will be substantially reduced due to these capabilities.

It can measure the value of the weak mixing angle over a wide range of momentum transfer complementary to Z-pole measurements and low-energy determinations. The possibility of polarizing both electron and proton/ion beams gives it unique handles on BSM physics. Our goal in this manuscript is to provide a detailed accounting of the EW and BSM potential of the EIC with a realistic simulation of anticipated experimental uncertainties. We explore the use of the asymmetries A\u00f0e\u00dePV and A \u00f0p\u00f0D\u00de\u00de PV . In addition to determining the BSM reach of PVobservables, we consider the reach of the lepton-charge asymmetry A\u00f0p\u00f0D\u00de\u00deLC at the EIC for the first time, assuming a positron beam will become available in the future. Since no new particles beyond the SM have so far been discovered, we adopt the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) for our BSM studies (for a review of the SMEFT, see Ref. [1]). The SMEFT contains higher-dimensional operators formed by using SM fields, assuming all new physics is heavier than both SM states and the accessible collider energy. The leading dimensionsix operator basis of SMEFT for on-shell fields has been completely classified (there is a dimension-five operator that violates the lepton number, which we do not consider here) [2\u20134]. We find that the EIC can probe the full spectrum of SMEFT operators to the few-tera-electron-volt level or beyond. The wide variety of observables possible at the EIC, which include several asymmetries with either proton or ion beams, ensure that no flat directions remain in the Wilson coefficient parameter space, unlike at the LHC in the neutral-current Drell-Yan process [5\u20137]. Our analysis of the determination of the weak mixing angle, assuming a realistic annual luminosity and accounting for experimental and theoretical uncertainties to the best level that can be reached at the pre-EIC running stage, finds good precision for this fundamental SM parameter in a kinematic region not explored before. The precision will continue to improve as data are accumulated from decades-long running of the EIC. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, first we provide a complete description of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) that includes both SM contributions and the SMEFT extensions. The DIS cross sections that account for both electron and hadron polarizations are provided in both structure-function and parton-model languages. We follow this theoretical framework by presenting a basic strategy to measure different polarization components of the cross sections and to form PV asymmetries at the EIC. Measurement of the lepton-charge (LC) asymmetry is also discussed. In Sec. III, we present data simulation based on the design of the EIC Comprehensive Chromodynamics Experiment (ECCE) detector (recently endorsed as the reference design for EIC detector 1 by the EIC Detector Proposal Advisory Panel [8]) using a fast-smearing method\nand event-selection criteria, followed by projections of statistical precision for PV and LC asymmetries based on the planned annual luminosity of the EIC. The generation of pseudodata, as well as the uncertainty matrix, is presented in Sec. IV, followed by extractions of the EW mixing angle in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we provide an extensive description of our SMEFT analysis framework, with representative results on the fits of single and two Wilson coefficients given in Sec. VII. We also show an example fit in which six Wilson coefficients are turned on simultaneously, in order to demonstrate that EIC data are capable of removing all degeneracies in the semileptonic four-fermion operator parameter space. We conclude in Sec. VIII. In Appendix A, we present novel analysis methods to simultaneously fit PV asymmetries and the beam polarization or LC asymmetries and the luminosity difference between e\u00fe and e\u2212 runs. A complete collection of all the SMEFT fit results of single and two Wilson coefficients from this study is given in Appendix B."

            "text": "In this section, we give a brief overview of the formalism of DIS and the SMEFT. In particular, we generalize the SM DIS cross-section and asymmetry formulas to include contributions from SMEFT operators, which encode new physics at an energy level \u039b that lies well beyond the electroweak scale. We denote a lepton scattering off a nucleus as\nl\u00f0k\u00de \u00feH\u00f0P\u00de \u2192 l\u00f0k0\u00de \u00fe X; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere l stands for an electron or positron, the hadron H stands for either the proton (p) or the deuteron (D), and X denotes the final-state hadronic system. The four-momenta of the initial and final leptons and the initial hadron are denoted as k, k0, and P, respectively. Using the momenta of the initial- and final-state leptons and the initial-state hadron, one can define the following Lorentz-invariant kinematic variables:\ns \u00bc \u00f0P\u00fe k\u00de2; \u00f02\u00de\nQ2 \u00bc \u2212\u00f0k \u2212 k0\u00de2; \u00f03\u00de\nx \u00bc Q 2\n2P \u00b7 \u00f0k \u2212 k0\u00de ; \u00f04\u00de\ny \u00bc P \u00b7 \u00f0k \u2212 k 0\u00de\nP \u00b7 k ; \u00f05\u00de\nW2 \u00bc \u00f0P\u00fe k \u2212 k0\u00de2; \u00f06\u00de\n016006-2\nwhere s is the center-of-mass energy squared, Q2 is the negative of the lepton four-momentum transfer squared, the Bjorken-x variable is the longitudinal hadron momentum fraction carried by the struck parton, the inelasticity parameter y gives the fractional energy loss of the lepton in the hadron rest frame, and W gives the invariant mass of the final-state hadronic systemX. The kinematic variables x, y, s, and Q2 are related to each other via Q2 \u00bc xy\u00f0s \u2212M2\u00de, where M is the mass of the proton or deuteron. The diagrams in Fig. 1 show the partonic tree-level processes that contribute to Eq. (1). These are the contributions to the total tree-level amplitude from the singlephoton exchange, the single-Z-boson exchange, and the SMEFT contact interactions. The SMEFT Lagrangian that describes these contact interactions has the form\nLSMEFT \u00bc 1 \u039b2 X r CrOr \u00fe ; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere the summation index r runs over the set of dimension-six SMEFT operators and the ellipsis denotes SMEFT operators of a mass dimension greater than 6. We restrict our analysis to include only the effects of dimension-six SMEFT operators since the higher-dimensional operators are formally suppressed by additional powers of E2=\u039b2, where E is the typical energy scale of the scattering process. Although these effects can be important for DrellYan production at the LHC [9,10], the low energy of the EIC renders them negligible in this analysis.Or denotes the rth dimension-six operator and Cr is the corresponding (dimensionless) Wilson coefficient arising from integrating out the new-physics degrees of freedom at the scale \u039b. These Wilson coefficients can be constrained through a comparison of SMEFT predictions with precision measurements of various processes studied in a variety of experiments across a wide range of energy scales. The subset of dimension-six operators that we consider in our analysis of DIS is given in Table I. We note that there are additional SMEFT operators but they are known to be far better bounded through other datasets such as precision Z-pole observables [11\u201313], and we neglect them here. The above assumptions leave us with the seven Wilson coefficients associated with the listed operators that enter the predictions for DIS cross sections and asymmetries.\nAs seen in Table I, the SMEFToperatorsOr are expressed in terms of the basis of SM fields before electroweak symmetry breaking. For the purposes of DIS phenomenology below the electroweak scale, it is useful to rewrite these SMEFT operators in the vector and axial-vector basis using Dirac fields that describe themassive electrons (e) and quarks (qf) after electroweak symmetry breaking, which is a customary parametrization (see, e.g., [14]):\nLSMEFT \u00bc 1 \u039b2 X r C\u0303r X f e\u0304 \u03b3\u03bc\u00f0ceVr \u2212 ceAr\u03b35\u00dee q\u0304f\u03b3\u03bc\n\u00d7 \u00f0cfVr \u2212 c f Ar \u03b35\u00deqf \u00fe ; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere the specific values of the vector and axial-vector couplings\u2014ce;qVk and c e;q Ak , respectively\u2014for the rth SMEFT operator follow from the corresponding chiral and flavor structure of the SMEFT operators. The coefficients C\u0303r are related to the Cr by an overall factor and can be fixed by comparing Eqs. (7) and (8). There is freedom to always redefine the C\u0303r by absorbing an overall factor into the couplings ce;qVr and c e;q Ar . We specify in Table I the exact definitions that we use. These couplings are analogous to the vector and axial-vector couplings, ge;qV and g e;q A , of the Zboson but are instead generated from integrating out UV physics associated with the scale \u039b. As seen in Fig. 1, the total tree-level amplitude can be decomposed into three contributions:\nM \u00bc M\u03b3 \u00feMZ \u00feMr; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere M\u03b3, MZ, and Mr denote the contributions from the single-photon exchange, the single-Z-boson exchange, and the SMEFT operators, respectively. In particular, Mr \u00bc P i Mi, where the summation index i runs over the amplitudes arising from the SMEFT operators listed in Table I. Up to leading order in the SMEFT power counting, where only dimension-six SMEFT operators that scale as 1=\u039b2 are kept, the total amplitude squared can be written as\njMj2 \u00bc M\u03b3\u03b3 \u00fe 2M\u03b3Z \u00feMZZ \u00fe 2M\u03b3r \u00fe 2MZr; \u00f010\u00de\nwhereM\u03b3\u03b3 \u00bc jM\u03b3j2,MZZ \u00bc jMZj2, 2M\u03b3Z \u00bc M \u03b3MZ\u00fe M\u03b3M Z, 2M\u03b3r \u00bc M \u03b3Mr \u00feMrM \u03b3 , and 2MZr \u00bc M ZMr \u00feMrM Z. These denote the amplitudes of the single-photon exchange, single-Z-boson exchange, the interference between the single-photon and the single-Zboson exchange, the interference between the singlephoton exchange and the SMEFT, and the interference between the single-Z-boson exchange and the SMEFT, respectively. Here, we ignore the jMrj2 contribution since it scales as 1=\u039b4, formally the same size as contributions from dimension-eight SMEFT operators interfering with the SM.\n016006-3\nFor the hadron-level cross sections and asymmetries, these different contributions will give rise to corresponding structure functions. In particular, in addition to the usual structure functions encountered in the SM DIS, new structure functions corresponding to SMEFT contributions arise. Thus, including the SMEFT contributions, the DIS differential cross section takes the general form\nd2\u03c3 dxdy \u00bc 2\u03c0y\u03b1 2 Q4 \u03b7\u03b3L\u03b3\u03bc\u03bdW \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 \u00fe \u03b7\u03b3ZL\u03b3Z\u03bc\u03bdW\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3Z \u00fe \u03b7ZLZ\u03bc\u03bdW\u03bc\u03bdZ\n\u00fe X r \u03be\u03b3rL\u03b3r\u03bc\u03bdW \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3r \u00fe X r \u03beZrLZr\u03bc\u03bdW \u03bc\u03bd Zr ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere \u03b1 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and L\u03b3;\u03b3Z;Z;\u03b3r;Zr\u03bc\u03bd and W \u03b3;\u03b3Z;Z;\u03b3r;Zr \u03bc\u03bd are the leptonic and hadronic tensors, respectively. The first three terms on the right-hand side (RHS) correspond to the SM contributions from M\u03b3\u03b3 , 2M\u03b3Z, and MZZ, respectively, and the last two sets of terms correspond to the contributions from the SMEFT operators, i.e., 2M\u03b3r and 2MZr, respectively. For completeness, below we collect some useful results to make the form of the cross section explicit. The dimensionless coefficients \u03b7\u03b3;\u03b3Z;Z, \u03be\u03b3r, and \u03beZr are given by\n\u03b7\u03b3 \u00bc 1;\n\u03b7\u03b3Z \u00bc GFM 2 Z 2 ffiffiffi 2 p \u03c0\u03b1\nQ2\nQ2 \u00feM2Z ;\n\u03b7Z \u00bc \u00f0\u03b7\u03b3Z\u00de2;\n\u03be\u03b3r \u00bc C\u0303r 4\u03c0\u03b1 Q2 \u039b2 ;\n\u03beZr \u00bc \u03b7\u03b3Z C\u0303r 4\u03c0\u03b1 Q2 \u039b2 ; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere GF \u00bc 1.1663787\u00f06\u00de \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 is the Fermi constant and MZ \u00bc 91.1876 0.0021 GeV [14] is the mass of the Z boson.

For positrons, one flips the sign of all the geA and c e Ar terms and the overall sign of L\u03b3Z and L\u03b3r above. Using these identities for the leptonic tensors, Eq.

We omit two additional possible\n016006-4\nLorentz structures in the hadronic tensor, typically denoted as the polarized structure functions g2 and g3, since these terms give a contribution to the cross section that is suppressed by M2=Q2 when contracted with the leptonic tensor. Therefore, we do not consider the structure functions g2;3 in the rest of our analysis. The nucleus spin vector S\u03bc satisfies the constraints S2 \u00bc \u2212M2 and S \u00b7 P \u00bc 0. For longitudinal polarization, it takes the canonical form S\u03bc \u00bc \u03bbH\u00f0jpj; E pjpj\u00de, where \u03bbH \u00bc 1 is the nucleon helicity and P\u03bc \u00bc \u00f0E;p\u00de is the nucleon four-momentum.

The quantity d\u03c30 is the unpolarized cross section, d\u03c3e and d\u03c3H denote the cross-section differences between initial electron and hadron states of opposite helicity, respectively, and d\u03c3eH is the cross-section difference between initial electron and hadron states with the same and opposite helicities defined in the center-ofmass frame.

The various cross-section components in Eq. (31) are given in Eqs. (25). The PVDIS asymmetry can be formed by flipping the spin direction of either the electron beam or the ion beam.

This is in contrast to HERA, where data were taken with positive then negative electron polarization, with such long time intervals in between that runs with opposite electron polarizations are essentially two independent experiments.

It is simultaneously fully capable, low risk, and cost effective. ECCE strategically repurposes select components of existing experimental equipment to maximize its overall capabilities within the envelope of planned resources. For example, the central barrel of the detector incorporates the storied 1.4-T BABAR superconducting solenoid and the sPHENIX barrel hadronic calorimeter, currently under construction. For EWNC physics studied in this work, we focus on the detection and identification of inclusive scattered electrons, provided by ECCE\u2019s tracking system [19] combined with electromagnetic calorimetry [20] in a nearly hermetic coverage. ECCE features a hybrid tracking detector design using three state-of-the-art technologies to achieve high-precision primary and decay-vertex determination, fine momentum tracking, and distance-of-closest-approach resolution in the region j\u03b7j \u2264 3.5 with full azimuth coverage. The ECCE tracking detector consists of the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS)\u2013based silicon vertex/tracking subsystem, the \u03bcRWELL tracking subsystem, and the AC-LGAD outer tracker, which also serves as the time-of-flight detector, all optimized by artificial intelligence. For the electromagnetic calorimeter, the system employed by ECCE consists of the PbWO4-based electron endcap EM calorimeter (EEMC) for the region\u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.8, the SciGlass-based barrel ECal for the region \u22121.7 < \u03b7 < 1.3, and the Pb-scintillator\nshashlike-type forward ECal (FEMC, hadron beam direction) that covers roughly 1.3 < \u03b7 < 4. For the inclusive DIS kinematics determination, we use single-electron simulations in the full detector to study the measurement of the electron momentum and trajectory, and we characterize the difference between detected and true values as smearing in the electron momentum and polar and azimuthal angles. The smearing can then be applied to simulated events without involving the full detector. This is referred to as fast smearing and is the simulation method adopted here that yields all physics projections provided in this work. On the other hand, other methods that can be used to identify DIS kinematics, such as detecting all hadrons in the final state or detecting both the scattered electron and all hadrons, are not investigated here. Similarly, the use of the electromagnetic calorimeter can improve track identification in part of the phase space, but is not included in this work."

For the deuterium ion beam, the energy specified is per nucleon. The fast-smearing method is applied to inclusive electron events in the DJANGOH output, and the physics cross section and parity-violating asymmetries are calculated event by event using a modified user routine of DJANGOH. The number of scattered DIS electrons is then calculated using the cross-section information and the expected integrated luminosity after correcting for bin migration. The detector fast smearing is obtained from a singleelectron gun simulation. Resolution spectra are determined for 57 evenly spaced bins for the pseudorapidity range \u03b7 \u00bc \u00f0\u22123.5625; 3.5625\u00de and 1 GeV wide bins in the transverse momentum, pT . For each DJANGOH-simulated event, smearing in the electron momentum, p, and polar and azimuthal angles \u03b8 and \u03d5 are randomly picked from the corresponding spectrum and applied to the event, which are used to determine the detected kinematics of the event. While the smearing spectra are not exactly Gaussianshaped, they are fitted with a Gaussian function. The fitted root-mean-square (RMS) values extracted for illustration purposes are displayed in Fig. 2. Using the fast-smearing method, we generate 20 M total MC events for each of the beam-energy combinations. Of these 20 M, 10 M events are generated to study the kinematic coverage over the full phase space. The remaining 10 M events are generated with Q2min \u00bc 50 GeV2 for which DIS events have the most impact on the extraction of the weak mixing angle. The drawback of the fast-smearing method is that no selection of the hadronic state is implemented. Methods utilizing hadronic final states such\n016006-9\nas the double-angle method may provide better DIS event identification for a certain kinematic range and thus improve the precision of the analysis. Bin migration of inclusive scattering electrons due to internal and external radiative effects is studied with fastsmearing simulation and treated using the \u201cR matrix\u201d unfolding method [23]. Background reactions are studied using the hadronic final state generated by DJANGOH (with Q2min \u00bc 1.0 GeV2), and another Monte Carlo simulation of photoproduction events are generated by PYTHIA (version 6.428, with Q2min \u00bc 0). All events are passed through the full ECCE simulation. We find that the highest background events occur at high y values. These events are rejected at the event-selection stage; see the next section. We have also studied how our results change if a simple \u201ctheory-only\u201d simulation without a detailed detector simulation is performed. We find two major differences with respect to the current analysis:\n(i) As mentioned in the next section, we use the inelasticity constraint 0.1 < y < 0.9 in our current simulation. We find that the regions 0.1 < y < 0.2\nand 0.8 < y < 0.9 are not reliably modeled without a detailed detector simulation. Our theory-only simulation cannot accurately reproduce the expected event counts in this region due to missing detector response effects. We therefore must remove these regions, leading to an effective reduction of statistics for the theory-only simulation. (ii) Second, in the 0.2 < y < 0.8 region considered, the total error is relatively 10% to 30% more optimistic in each bin compared to the full detector simulation, with the 30% differences occurring near the boundaries of the y region. The net result of these two competing effects is that theoryonly bounds are up to 10% more optimistic than those found with a full detector simulation."

In this case, the main experimental systematic uncertainty would come from the luminosity difference between e\u2212 and e\u00fe runs, which is assumed to be 2% (relative in luminosity, absolute inALC) in this analysis. If the detector magnet polarity is reversed, then the detection of DIS positrons would be very similar to that of DIS electrons and all the data simulations, event selections, unfolding, etc., described in Sec. III B apply. The statistical uncertainty in ALC is thus determined by the luminosity of thee\u00fe run,which we assume to be one-tenth of that of the electron beam. Note that beam polarization and thus polarimetry uncertainties do not affect ALC measurements. The EW physics reach of ALC is further clouded by the difference in e\u2212 vs e\u00fe DIS cross sections due to higherorder QED effects. We calculate the value of ALC using DJANGOH version 4.6.19 in both the Born LO (that includes one-boson exchange only) and next-to-leading-order (NLO) radiated mode (that includes higher-order EW and QED effects); see Fig. 5. The difference of NLO minus Born values is taken as an estimate of QED NLO effects, and the uncertainty is assumed to be 5% relative. Because of the moderate Q2 reach of the EIC, the 2% absolute uncertainty from luminosity measurement is a dominating systematic effect for the uncertainty of A\u00f0H\u00deLC . In Appendix A 1, we present a method to simultaneously fit the luminosity term with SMEFT coefficients; however, we find this method yields 15% to 20% weaker SMEFT constraints."

            "text": "Webegin by considering the individual components of the uncertainties. We investigate the effects of sea quarks in the analysis by defining a valence-only approximation for the PDFs. The tag ud in the plot labels implies the valence-only approximation, in which only up- and down-quark contributions are considered in the hadronic cross section, whereas uds indicates that up, down, strange, and their antiquarks are taken into account. Note that for the datasets involving unpolarized deuteron with the ud tag, there will be no uncertainty from PDFs since deuteron PDFs, defined in terms of proton and neutron PDFs using isospin symmetry, cancel when analytically forming asymmetries in the valence-only approximation. Note also that for experimental systematic uncertainties other than those from beam polarimetry, both 1%and 2%values are shown in all figures of this section, although the 1% value is used in the results presented. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the uncertainty components for the dataset D4 in the ud and uds scenarios. As for the PDFs, we use NNPDF3.1 NLO [25] in the unpolarized case and NNPDFPOL1.1 [26] in the polarized case throughout. Only the \u00f0x;Q2\u00de region relevant for SMEFT analysis is shown, although the full region is used for the extraction of the weak mixing angle. The x axis of these plots is ordered by bin number; these are ordered first from low to high Q2, and then from small to\n016006-14\nlarge x within each Q2 bin, leading to the observed oscillatory behavior. When we turn on the sea quark contributions, the unpolarized deuteron datasets receive nonzero but highly suppressed PDF uncertainties, indicating that the assumption of deuteron PDFs completely canceling is a reasonably good approximation. The right panel shows that even after including sea quarks, the PDFs are still the smallest uncertainty component. This indicates that potentially poorly determined sea quark and strange quark distributions have little effect on this analysis. The largest single uncertainty component is the statistical uncertainty (shown as a dark red line). This is larger than both the 1% beam polarization uncertainty (light blue line) and either of the 1% or 2% uncorrelated systematic uncertainty assumptions (solid and dotted blue lines, respectively). When we switch to the high-luminosity (HL-EIC) scenario (dotted red line), the statistical uncertainty becomes comparable to the systematic ones. All uncertainties are significantly smaller than the predicted values of the asymmetry, shown as the solid black line in the plots. In Fig. 7, we display the different contributions to the diagonal entries of the uncertainty matrix of the datasets P5 and \u0394P5. The pattern of uncertainties for P5 is very similar to that observed for D4. The statistical ones are the largest single uncertainty source, while the PDFs are the smallest.\nAssuming high luminosity, the statistical uncertainties become comparable to the anticipated systematic ones. The pattern is different for \u0394P5: the statistical uncertainties are largest for all bins, even assuming high luminosity. The PDF uncertainties are also non-negligible, consistent with the expectation that spin-dependent PDFs are not known as precisely as the spin-independent ones. The anticipated experimental systematic uncertainties are negligible for all bins. Finally, we show in Fig. 8 the individual uncertainties for the electron-positron asymmetry dataset LP5. The error budget is different for this scenario compared to PV asymmetries. Since both beams are unpolarized, there is no uncertainty related to beam polarization. However, since electron and positron runs occur with different beams, there is the possibility of a significant overall luminosity difference between the two runs that can lead to an apparent asymmetry. We assume an absolute 2% uncertainty, 2 times the luminosity uncertainty requirement of [27]. Finally, we consider the possible errors arising from higher-order QED corrections that may differentiate between electron and positron scattering. We estimate this uncertainty by taking 5% of the difference between the Born-level and NLOQED results, obtained by using DJANGOH. The two largest sources of uncertainty throughout the entire kinematic range are the luminosity and statistical uncertainties.\n016006-15\nPDFs, higher-order QED, and anticipated systematic uncertainties are all significantly smaller. Summarizing all the figures presented in this section, we can make the following main points: (i) The expected statistical uncertainties are the dom-\ninant ones for the nominal EIC luminosity. If a highluminosity (HL-EIC) upgrade becomes realistic, they become comparable to experimental systematic uncertainties for PV asymmetries of the unpolarized\nhadron, A\u00f0e\u00dePV. (ii) PDF uncertainties are nearly irrelevant for the\nasymmetries of unpolarized hadrons, A\u00f0e\u00dePV. They become significant, second to statistical uncertainties, for PV asymmetries of polarized hadrons, A\u00f0H\u00dePV .\n(iii) The luminosity effect dominates over the statistical uncertainty for the majority of the phase space in the\ncase of electron-positron asymmetries, A\u00f0H\u00deLC , particularly at low x and low Q2. On the other hand, uncertainties from missing higher-order QED corrections are expected to be small."

            "text": "We now investigate the total uncertainties for the datasets D4, \u0394D4, P5, and \u0394P5. We consider four different scenarios: the nominal annual luminosity planned for the EIC or a potential high-luminosity upgrade beyond the initial phase of the EIC run, combined with 1% or 2% relative experimental systematic uncertainties due to particle background. We show the results in Figs. 9 and 10. We observe first that the dominant uncertainty component in all cases is the statistical one. The four uncertainty scenarios, namely 1% or 2% systematic uncertainties combined with nominal or high luminosity, can, in fact, be reduced to just the luminosity comparison, i.e., nominal vs high. Next, for\nboth D4 and P5, the asymmetry A\u00f0e\u00dePV is measured to percent level throughout the considered phase space. This is not the case for the polarized sets \u0394D4 and \u0394P5. Particularly in the \u0394P5 scenario at low Q2, the anticipated errors are larger than the asymmetry for all choices of systematic error and luminosity. Only in the very highFIG. 8. The same as in Fig. 7 but for LP5.\n016006-16\n016006-17\nQ2 bins does a measurement of the asymmetry A\u00f0H\u00dePV become meaningful. Our evaluation of the uncertainties indicates that using 1% or 2% relative systematic uncertainties makes practically no difference, as the total errors are mostly dominated by the statistical uncertainties for the PVasymmetries or the luminosity difference for the LC asymmetries. We also show that one can take into account the contribution of only the valence quarks to the asymmetries or include the sea quarks up to strange flavor and its antiquark, both of which lead to the same size of PDF errors for the datasets under consideration. In our best-fit analyses, we thus focus on the datasets with 1% relative systematic uncertainty and nominal luminosity in the uds scenario as our main datasets. Comparisons are performed to the ones having high luminosity, keeping the rest of the configuration the same. An important issue to address is whether a joint fit of PDFs and Wilson coefficients would change the potential of the EIC to probe the SMEFT parameter space that we find in this draft. This issue has been studied for both HERA and LHC datasets in the literature [28,29], where it is found that the interplay between PDFs and Wilson coefficients can become a significant challenge for some future high-luminosity measurements at the LHC. It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider such a joint fit, so we can only speculate regarding the exact answer to this question. However, we can make the following points that are supported by the uncertainty plots in this section of this manuscript:\n(i) For the unpolarized deuteron datasets, the PDF uncertainties are an order of magnitude smaller than the statistical uncertainties for the nominal luminosity and 3 to 5 times smaller than the highluminosity statistical uncertainties, as shown in Fig. 6. We therefore expect that a joint fit of the PDFs and Wilson coefficients would not greatly affect the bounds obtained here. The PDFs are\nalready determined sufficiently well from other experiments for the purposes of this analysis. (ii) The same statement holds for the P5 unpolarized datasets for both nominal and high luminosities, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 7. This plot indicates that taking ratios to form asymmetries, as we do in this study, greatly reduces the dependence on PDFs.\n(iii) Looking at the right panel of Fig. 7, we see that the polarized proton PDF error becomes comparable to the statistical error at high Q2 for the high-luminosity dataset. In this case, a joint fit of polarized PDFs and Wilson coefficients will be especially important. We note that the bounds from the polarized hadron datasets are generically much weaker than those for the unpolarized hadron sets (see Fig. 13 for example), since the polarized asymmetry is much smaller than the polarized one. We believe that our main point regarding the EIC sensitivity to SMEFTWilson coefficients is mostly unaffected by this point."

The EIC will provide constraints on sin2 \u03b8W in the intermediate-energy range that resides between the reach of fixed-target and collider facilities. For the extraction of the weak mixing angle, we focus on A\u00f0e\u00dePV, where sin 2 \u03b8W enters through the electron coupling geV;A and the corresponding quark couplings in the structure functions. We also include the one-loop renormalization group evolution [33] of sin2 \u03b8W in the MS scheme, including the relevant particle thresholds that arise between \u03bc \u00bc MZ and \u03bc \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffi Q2 p .

Comparing the theory prediction to the pseudodata, a best-fit value and uncertainty projection for sin2 \u03b8W at\nthe Z pole are obtained by minimizing the \u03c72 function defined as\n\u03c72 \u00bc \u00bdApseudodata \u2212Atheory T\u00bd\u00f0\u03a32\u00de\u22121 \u00bdApseudodata \u2212Atheory ; \u00f055\u00de\nwhere A is a dimension-Nbin vector with Nbin the total number of \u00f0x;Q2\u00de bins, \u03a32 is the uncertainty matrix of dimension Nbin \u00d7 Nbin, described in Sec. IV C, and sin2 \u03b8W\n016006-18\nto be fitted enters Atheory. The PDF portion of the uncertainty matrix is evaluated using the PDF sets CT18NLO [34] (LHAPDF [35] ID 14400-14458), MMHT2014nlo_68cl [36] (ID 25100-25150), and NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118 [25] (ID 303400-303500). Our results for sin2 \u03b8W are shown in Tables III and IV for five energy and nominal-annual-luminosity combinations\nof ep and eD collisions, respectively. These results are illustrated in Fig. 11. The inner error bars show the combined uncertainty from statistical and 1% uncorrelated experimental systematics (due to particle background); the median error bars show the experimental uncertainty that includes statistical, 1% uncorrelated experimental systematics, and 1% electron polarimetry. The outermost error\nbars, which almost coincide with the median error bars, include all the above and the PDF uncertainty evaluated using the set CT18NLO. Results evaluated with the sets MMHT2014 and NNPDF31NLO are similar. Along with our projection with the EIC annual nominal luminosity, we show the \u201cYR reference point\u201d (blue diamond), obtained from combining 100 fb\u22121 18 \u00d7 275 GeV ep and 10 fb\u22121 18 \u00d7 137 GeV eD pseudodata. Also shown are the expected precisions from near-future P2 [37], MOLLER [38], SoLID [39], and PVDIS [40,41] experiments, respectively, that will dominate the landscape of low- to mediumenergy scales. We note that our results have larger uncertainties than in the YR [24], which fits PDFs and sin2 \u03b8W simultaneously using the Jefferson Lab Angular Momentum (JAM)\nframework [42], possibly due to using realistic detector simulation and accurate running conditions. On the other hand, we find that PDF uncertainties are likely not the dominant ones for the EIC projections, but the electron polarization is, for the settings where the integrated luminosity approaches 100 fb\u22121. Consequently, upgrading the luminosity of the EIC does not bring significant improvement on the uncertainty of sin2 \u03b8W , and therefore we do not show our fitting results for the tenfold luminosity upgrade. Our results show that the EIC will provide a determination of sin2 \u03b8W at an energy scale that bridges higherenergy colliders with low- to medium-energy SM tests. Additionally, data points of different ffiffi s p values of the EIC can be combined or the Q2 dependence of the EW parameter can be explored, depending on the run plan of the EIC. Furthermore, one could study the exploratory potential of the EIC beyond the scope of a single SM parameter, and we provide results using the SMEFT framework in the next section."

The bounds on the Wilson coefficient Ceu across numerous datasets are representative and exhibit the common features of fits of single Wilson coefficients. We therefore show only the bounds on Ceu to illustrate the main observations and include the remaining Wilson coefficients in Appendix B 1. Figure 12 displays the\n016006-22\n95% C.L. intervals of Ceu for the four data families in which we are primarily interested in this paper. The intervals are grouped by asymmetries, namely electron PV asymmetries, A\u00f0e\u00dePV, of unpolarized hadrons (\u201cunpolarized APV\u201d); hadron PV asymmetries, A\u00f0H\u00dePV , with unpolarized electrons (\u201cpolarized APV\u201d); and unpolarized electron-positron asymmetries, A\u00f0H\u00deLC , of unpolarized hadrons (\u201clepton-charge A\u201d). PV asymmetries are then grouped into two, showing the fits in the nominal- and high-luminosity scenarios. In each block of intervals, there are four double lines in the case of PV asymmetries and four single lines in LC asymmetries. These four lines correspond to the data families D4 (black and its shade), D5 (red), P4 (blue), and P5 (orange), respectively. The darker of the two lines indicates the bounds from singleparameter fits with the Wilson coefficient Ceu, whereas the lighter ones show the bounds on the Wilson coefficient from simultaneous (1\u00fe 1)-parameter fits with Ceu and the beam polarization. We describe the details of the fits involving the beam polarization as an additional free parameter in Appendix A 2. From Fig. 12, we can extract the following main points: (i) Proton asymmetries of all the three types, namely\nunpolarized and polarized PV asymmetries and LC asymmetries, impose considerably stronger bounds than deuteron. (ii) High-energy low-luminosity datasets D5 and P5 lead to slightly weaker bounds than the lessenergetic but higher-luminosity ones, D4 and P4, respectively.\n(iii) Unpolarized PV asymmetries, A\u00f0e\u00dePV, offer much stricter bounds than the polarized ones A\u00f0H\u00dePV ; however, it should be noted that for some Wilson coefficients, unpolarized proton asymmetries yield nearly the same bounds as the corresponding polarized ones. (iv) Datasets in the high-luminosity scenario make a noticeable difference in the size of bounds. The\nimprovement due to increased luminosity is slightly more significant for polarized deuteron asymmetries. (v) Bounds from electron-positron asymmetries, A\u00f0H\u00deLC , are comparable to or looser than the ones from polarized hadron asymmetries. They never offer stricter bounds than high-luminosity hadron PV asymmetries.\n(vi) If the beam polarization is introduced as a new fitting parameter, unpolarized hadron asymmetries give considerably stronger bounds. The improvement is more significant in the high-luminosity scenario. However, the same fitting method yields weaker bounds with polarized hadron asymmetries. We explain this finding in Appendix A 2.\nAssuming weak correlations, one can also combine the bounds within a given family of datasets, e.g., D4, \u0394D4, and LD4. We find that the resultant bound is never stronger than the strongest one obtained from the individual family members, which is always from the electron PVasymmetry dataset. We note that this observation holds for other Wilson coefficient choices and for the two-dimensional fits in the next section, as well. In Fig. 13, we present the effective UV cutoff scales,\n\u039b= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Ceu p , with \u039b \u00bc 1 TeV, corresponding to the bounds shown in Fig. 12. The organization of this plot in terms of asymmetries and datasets is the same as in Fig. 12. Improved bounds on Ceu with the addition of the beam polarization to the fits are equivalent to higher-energy scales in the unpolarized PV asymmetries, which are indicated by the lighter columns in the background; on the other hand, weaker bounds from the fits with beam polarization are depicted by the lighter columns in the foreground for the polarized PV asymmetries. One can observe that scales reaching 3 TeV can be probed with nominal luminosity, while scales exceeding 4 TeV can be probed for other luminosities. We remark that care must be taken in comparing these mass limits with\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Ceu p , defined in terms of the 95% C.L. bounds on the Wilson coefficient Ceu and with\nothers found in the literature, which sometimes assume a strong coupling limit, equivalent to setting Cr \u00bc 4\u03c0, and also maximally constructive interference between different quark contributions. For example, converting our results to the notation of [44] would yield a bound on \u039b= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Ceu p of 19 TeV, instead of 3 TeV quoted here, which is only very approximate and is calculated by multiplying 3 TeV byffiffiffiffiffi 4\u03c0 p and ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 5 pp , where the latter is to account for the constructive interference between quark contributions, and by another factor to convert 90% C.L. to 95% C.L."

We emphasize that the representative examples shown in this section are the results of the simultaneous fits with beam polarization in light of the significantly improved results of the (1\u00fe 1)-parameter fits in the previous section. The description of the beampolarization fits is presented in Appendix A 2. The complete set of plots of confidence ellipses is given in Appendix B 2. In Fig. 14, we compare the 95% C.L. ellipses for the pair \u00f0Ceu; Cqe\u00de between the data families D4 and P4. Each asymmetry type gives a distinct correlation pattern, complementary to one another. Electron-positron asymmetries give rise to wide and elongated bandlike ellipses compared to PVasymmetries. As in the case of (1\u00fe 1)-parameter fits, electron PV asymmetries of unpolarized hadrons offer the strongest bounds on the pairs of Wilson coefficients. Comparing deuteron to proton, one can see that proton data are significantly more constraining.\nFigure 15 shows the comparison of the simultaneous fit of the Wilson coefficients \u00f0Ceu; Clu\u00de projected for the EIC to the corresponding fit with the LHC data adapted from [45]. The LHC fit exhibits a flat direction; i.e., a particular linear combination of the two coefficients cannot be determined. A similar comparison is given in Fig. 16 for the pair \u00f0Ceu; C\u00f01\u00delq \u00de, using the nominal- and high-luminosity P4 set of the EIC. We observe that in both\nFIG. 15.

More importantly, the EIC projected data show the capability of resolving flat directions and significantly constraining the aforementioned pairs of Wilson coefficients. Finally, in Fig. 17, we present the fits from the P4 dataset and the LHC adapted from [6] for the pair \u00f0C\u00f01\u00delq ; C\u00f03\u00delq \u00de. This figure shows that when the LHC data impose tight bounds on a pair of Wilson coefficients, the EIC preliminary data can introduce far stronger bounds on the same pair of Wilson coefficients. Moreover, the fits from EIC and LHC have distinct correlations, which indicate the complementarity of the EIC to the LHC as a future collider. Treating the projected EIC and the LHC data to be uncorrelated, we also plot the combined fit of the two, which turns out to even more strongly constrain the chosen pair of Wilson coefficients. We remark that the effective UV scales probed with the combined dataset exceed 2 TeV. It should be noted that there appear flat directions in the fits of certain pairs of Wilson coefficients with the projected EIC data that utilize the deuteron beam. Examples include \u00f0Ceu; Ced\u00de and \u00f0Clu; Cld\u00de. We can explain these observations analytically. We find that these pairs always appear in a specific way in asymmetry expressions, for example, 2Ceu \u2212 Ced for electron PV asymmetries with unpolarized deuteron. In all such cases, only one of the data families exhibits this behavior, with the degeneracy broken by another data family. Our results on the bounds from Wilson coefficients in simultaneous (2\u00fe 1)-parameter fits with the beam\npolarization as an additional parameter can be summarized as follows:\n(i) Proton asymmetries impose much stricter bounds than deuteron.\n(ii) Unpolarized hadron asymmetries lead to stronger correlations than the polarized ones.\n(iii) The three types of asymmetries of deuteron and proton considered in this work, together with the LHC data, are complementary to each other in the sense that they offer distinct correlation patterns. (iv) The projected EIC data are capable of resolving all flat directions that appear in the LHCDrell-Yan data.\n(v) The bounds from the projected EIC data can be much stronger than the LHC data, indicating that the EIC has an important role to play in future probes of the SMEFT. We can ask what happens when more than two Wilson coefficients are turned on simultaneously. We study this in Sec. B 3, where we turn on six Wilson coefficients. The resulting bounds are 20% to 30% weaker than the ones found here in the 2d case. We note that no flat directions appear in these fits, indicating that the EIC can fully probe this parameter space without degeneracies."

We have focused on the precision determination of the weak mixing angle over a wide range of momentum transfer and on probes of heavy new physics.\n016006-25\nWe have provided all the formulas for neutral-current DIS and simulation details that will be needed for future studies of these areas. Our BSM analysis utilizes the modelindependent SMEFT framework and focuses on the semileptonic four-fermion operator sector of the theory. We translate our formalism into the DIS language in terms of parity-violating couplings and structure functions to facilitate crosstalk between the high-energy-physics and nuclear communities. We provide a detailed accounting of uncertainties from statistics, experimental systematic effects, beam polarimetry for parity-violating asymmetries, higher-order QED corrections for lepton-charge asymmetries, and finally PDFs. Additionally, we explore simultaneously fitting the beam polarization with the anticipated high-precision parity-violating asymmetry data as a possible analysis technique to improve upon the experimental limitation from beam polarimetry. Our BSM analysis finds that UV scales in excess of 3 TeV can be probed with the currently planned (nominal) annual luminosity of the EIC, with scales above 4 TeV possible if a tenfold luminosity upgrade becomes available beyond EIC\u2019s initial decade of running. For the latter, we focus on studying the physics reach and limitations from sources other than statistical, without comment as to the feasibility of such an upgrade. The most stringent bounds come from polarized electron scattering off of unpolarized protons. Constraints from polarized hadrons, deuterons, and from a possible future positron beam provide important complementary probes. Our complete study of correlations between Wilson coefficients finds that no degeneracies remain upon combining all EIC datasets. This is not the case with LHC Drell-Yan measurements, in which numerous degeneracies exist, and will continue to occur even after LHC\u2019s high luminosity running. This demonstrates that the EIC polarization provides a powerful probe of BSM effects. Although the EIC is primarily thought of as a QCD machine, it is also a powerful probe of potential new physics, in many ways complementary to the higher-energy LHC. We note that current global fits of LHC data, for example to top-quark and Higgs data, probe orthogonal sets of Wilson coefficients [46]. However, the strongest LHC constraints on the semileptonic four-fermion sector of the SMEFT come from the Drell-Yan data. Given that LHC Drell-Yan cross sections are blind to certain combinations of Wilson coefficients, we envision that high-precision EIC data will help remove these degeneracies in global fits, both at the present moment and at the time when high-luminosity LHC Drell-Yan data become available. We hope that our work motivates future studies of the unexpected power of the EIC for new-physics searches."

The second term on the RHS of Eq.

The logic behind this addition is that experimentally, the polarimetry does provide knowledge on the beam polarization, but we hope to obtain a better determination of the polarizations within the uncertainty provided by the polarimetry by fitting data with high statistical precision. As for the beam polarization itself, we use a normalized value of P\u0304 \u00bc 1 in this study for simplicity. Treating the new term to be the contribution of a new observable, we increase the degrees of freedom of the \u03c72 distribution by 1. As in the case of luminosity difference fits, we extend our one- and two-parameter fits of Wilson coefficients to (1\u00fe 1)- and (2\u00fe 1)-parameter simultaneous fits by including the beam polarization as a new parameter. From (1\u00fe 1)-parameter fits, we find that P and any Cr are rather weakly correlated, j\u03c1rj\u2272 0.1, in the polarized hadron datasets, whereas there are strong correlations, j\u03c1rj\u2273 0.7, in the unpolarized hadron asymmetries. We observe similar correlations in the (2\u00fe 1)-parameter fits. In Fig. 20, we present the allowed intervals of the Wilson coefficient Ceu for the nominal- and high-luminosity datasets P4 and \u0394P4, while Fig. 21 displays the 95% C.L. ellipse of the Wilson coefficients \u00f0Ceu; Cqe\u00de for the same datasets in the nominal-luminosity scenario. We find that\n016006-27\nbounds from unpolarized hadron datasets become stronger by 30% to 50%, yet the ones from polarized hadron asymmetries become 15% to 20% weaker. The improvement is sharper in the high-luminosity unpolarized hadron sets, whereas the worsening is significant for the nominalluminosity polarized hadron sets. One can explain why the bounds become weaker in the polarized hadron sets by referring to the correlations. Since in these datasets, the beam polarization and the Wilson coefficients are found to be weakly correlated, one would naively expect the bounds obtained from single-parameter fits of Wilson coefficients to roughly remain the same on the grounds that P and Ck can be thought of as almost fully independent so that they will not affect each other in the fits. Thus, any increase in the allowed limits of the Wilson coefficient can be attributed to the increase in the number of\nparameters fitted, which is reflected as the normalization of the uncertainties of the fit."

We observe that the bounds become 25% to 40% weaker as we increase the number of Wilson coefficients fitted. This is due to an interplay between the increased number of fitted parameters and correlations among them. In Figs. 62\u201366, we compare the confidence ellipses from the initial 2d fits to the ones in the two-parameter projections of the 6d fit of the aforementioned Wilson\n016006-37\ncoefficients. We find that the bounds become 20% to 30% weaker as in the case of the comparison of the oneparameter fits and projections, which can be explained by the same reasoning as mentioned above. The other\nchoices of six Wilson coefficients lead to similar results. We note that no flat directions appear in these fits, indicating that the EIC can fully probe this parameter space without degeneracies.\n016006-38\n016006-39\n016006-40\n016006-41\n016006-42\n016006-43\n016006-44\n016006-45\n016006-46\n016006-47\n016006-48\n016006-49\n016006-50\n016006-51\n016006-52\n016006-53\n016006-54\n016006-55\n016006-56\n016006-57\n016006-58\n016006-59\n016006-60\n[1] I.
