            "text": "Measurement-based care (MBC) is a critical component of an evidence-based decision support framework that guides patient treatment.1 In mental health clinical practice, MBC approaches have been designed to provide systematic, quantitative assessments to track treatment progress, measure symptom severity and reflect on important aspects of health-related quality of life, satisfaction and functioning.2,3 Thus, MBC can be implemented in various ways to enhance clinical practice in mental healthcare settings. Several clinician-rated instruments that rely on interviews and questionnaires for assessments of symptoms have been used to measure treatment outcomes in clinical studies of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).4,5 The Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item questionnaire (each item yields a score of 0 to 6), is a validated, clinician-rated measure of depression designed to measure depression severity and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD.6 It is one of the most frequently used scales for assessment of depression in clinical trials of antidepressant treatments submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).5,7 However, the MADRS as\nNeuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2022:18 1127\u20131132 1127 \u00a9 2022 Morrens et al.

The CGI-S requires the clinician to rate the severity of patient\u2019s illness from a global perspective, relative to the clinician\u2019s experience with patients who have MDD. The brevity and simplicity of CGI-S makes it a more practical measurement tool that can easily be used by a clinician in a busy real-world clinical practice setting.9 The CGI-S directly reflects a clinician\u2019s judgment and captures clinical impressions of depression severity based on observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days.9,10 The scale has also shown good inter-rater reliability among clinicians.7,9,11 Several studies have evaluated the association between change on the MADRS and a 1-point change on the CGI-S and report a range of results. A 1-point reduction in CGI-S score translated into an 8\u20139-point change in MADRS total score, in a study evaluating the relationship of MADRS and CGI-S scales in patients with MDD.7 Another study concluded that based on a 1-point improvement in the CGI-S anchor, a 10-point improvement on the MADRS is an appropriate meaningful change threshold for withinpatient change.12 In a recent post-hoc analysis of phase 3 studies of esketamine nasal spray in patients with treatmentresistant depression (TRD), a 2-point reduction in CGI-S score corresponded to a 12-point reduction in MADRS, thus establishing thresholds for clinically meaningful within-patient changes and better interpretability.13 Phase 3 clinical studies of esketamine nasal spray in patients with TRD have used MADRS as the primary assessment of treatment response and remission.14\u201318 Both MADRS and CGI-S scales have demonstrated comparable ability to measure treatment outcomes with a high correlation in patients with MDD.4\nEvaluating rating agreement between MADRS-based and CGI-S-based outcomes using patient-level data is important to translate clinical trial results into clinical practice. The purpose of this post-hoc analysis was to evaluate the agreement with the pre-specified MADRS-based assessment and a CGI-S score-based definition of response to acute antidepressant treatment in patients with TRD."

Patients also had to meet the study definition of TRD: failed to respond to \u22652 antidepressant treatments of adequate dose and duration in the current episode, with one antidepressant treatment failure assessed prospectively at study entry. The study had three phases: a 4-week screening/prospective observation phase, a 4-week double-blind treatment phase, and a posttreatment follow-up phase of up to 24 weeks. In the 4-week acute treatment phase, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice a week plus a newly initiated daily oral antidepressant (ESKNS + AD) or oral antidepressant plus placebo nasal spray (AD + PBO-NS).\nIndependent Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards (listed in Supplementary Material) for each country approved the study protocol.

Also, of the 198 patients who had a day-28 CGI-S assessment, two did not have a day-28 MADRS assessment. Thus, a total of 196 patients with both MADRS and CGI-S at day-28 were included in the analysis. At the end of the 4-week double-blind phase, the proportion of responders among all patients (n=201) was similar when assessed using the MADRS (61%) and CGI-S (63%) methods (Table 1).\nThe Cohen\u2019s kappa was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67\u20130.86), suggesting substantial agreement between the two methods. The CGI-S-based assessment demonstrated 92.5% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity versus the MADRS-based assessment.

At the end of the 4-week treatment phase, the proportions of responders and non-responders among all patients and patients treated with ESK-NS + AD assessed using the MADRS response criterion were similar to those assessed using the CGI-S criterion. There was substantial agreement (Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient: 0.75\u20130.76) between the two scales.\nStandardized scales provide tangible evidence of treatment response in clinical research. However, the implementation of scales such as MADRS in real-world psychiatry practice is often burdensome for the clinicians and patients. Given the variety of rating scales, using clinically and practically relevant measures that could potentially lower the burden of time associated with assessment is of great importance.19,20 The MADRS has been used in pivotal clinical studies of antidepressants; however, its adoption in clinical practice is uncommon. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an alternative approach to the MADRS using the CGI-S that has similar rigor for assessment of response albeit with lesser burden and can be used by clinicians in real-world practice. During routine clinical visits, the use of a semistructured MADRS tool may not be practical to the physician and cumbersome for patients who have to formally answer to 10 standardized questions and can potentially restrict patient-physician interaction to an assessment bound within the 10 items of the scale. Findings from the present analysis underscore the agreement between depression rating scales and measures of global illness severity and indicate a high agreement between the MADRS and CGI-S for assessment of response. Thus, the simpler and readily understood CGI-S mimics the assessment of response in the clinical trial and can be used to measure treatment response in real-world clinical practice.9 By utilizing a clinician-determined summary, the CGI-S is more intuitive and improvement on the CGI-S reflects a more global account of the patient\u2019s disease status and overall well-being, which is clinically meaningful for the clinician, patients and payer in contrast to assessments based on standardized rating scales for treatment effectiveness.9\nThis post-hoc analysis was based on data from over 200 adult patients with the same diagnosis (and definition) of TRD participating in a phase 3 clinical study from the registration program of esketamine nasal spray, representing a relatively homogenous population for assessment.17 Furthermore, the analysis included data from both active control (AD + PBO-NS)- and study drug (ESK-NS + AD)-treated patients, providing wider range scores that make the findings conceivably more relevant and robust."

            "text": "Inherent limitations of a post-hoc analysis should be considered. The primary study enrolled patients with limited medical and psychiatric co-morbidities and substance use disorder history. Patients with current or recent history (within 6 months) of homicidal ideation/intent or suicidal ideation with intent to act or suicidal behavior (within the past year); diagnosis of psychotic disorder, MDD with psychotic features, bipolar or related disorders, borderline, antisocial, histrionic, or narcissistic personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder; uncontrolled hypertension; seizures were excluded; thus, the sample may not be representative of all the patients with TRD. However, a majority of the study population had either moderate or serious anxiety at baseline, similar to the broader population with TRD. The use of CGI-S also has some inherent limitations. Standardization across clinics typically does not occur; so, neither interrater reliability nor a consensus of how much each rating relies on symptoms or daily function or satisfaction has been agreed. Furthermore, given the\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S358367 DovePress Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2022:181130\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nconcerns of clinician bias, a brief patient-reported scale would be a suitable alternative for regular in-clinic assessments. Nevertheless, the CGI-S approach reflects in many ways the current assessment process in real-world practice and in this case allows the definition of clinically meaningful changes. Finally, it is acknowledged that the most widely used approach of considering a reduction of severity of symptoms of \u226550% from baseline to be a clinical responder is to a large extent arbitrary.13 Moreover, a report based on data from patients with TRD found that a 35% reduction in the MADRS score was associated with a clinically meaningful degree of improvement in health-related quality-oflife21 as assessed by the Quality-of-Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire.22"
