Sincemydiagnosis in 1996,myunchangedHumalog insulin has increased in list price from $21 a vial (\u00a317.80; \u20ac21.07) to $275 or more a vial.2\nLike most people with type 1 diabetes, I need three or more vials a month to survive. Even with health insurance, I\u2019ve given up seemingly everything to afford this essential medicine: I\u2019ve sold all of my belongings, including my car; moved away from my family; cashed out my retirement account; borrowed money from my retired parents; and even given up my dog, Nicky, because I could no longer afford to keep both of us alive and healthy.\nWith US headlines proclaiming earlier this year that \u201cHouse passes bill to cap insulin prices\u201d3 and \u201cHouse passes insulin price cap as Senate looks for path forward,\u201d4 it may have seemed as though US Congress was finally poised to consider legislation that would protect the seven million Americans who, like me, rely on exogenous insulin to survive.5\nAs part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Democrats originally proposeda$35 amonth insulin co-pay cap that applied only to certain Americans with private insurance and those on Medicare. Ultimately, the co-pay cappassed earlier thismonth, but only forMedicare beneficiaries andnot for people with private insurance."

            "text": "Neither of the US\u2019s two political parties proposed legislation to help people without insurance afford insulin, even though those who are uninsured pay the most and, as a result, are more likely to be among the one in four Americans who depend on insulin and must ration it to survive.6 By focusing solely on insulin co-pays for people who are already insured, the act did nothing to tackle the ever increasingprice of insulin for those who are uninsured or how much companies can charge for insulin. Consequently, the price of insulin can still reach $300 or more a vial.\nIf I can\u2019t afford insurance or if I lose my job and the insurance provided by my employer, there\u2019s still no safety net to cushion me from the soaring costs of this lifesaving medicine. I know first hand how easy it is, in the US, to be one of the roughly 31 million people currently without health insurance.7 I know what it\u2019s like to pay astronomical prices for the insulin I need to survive. No one should be in that position. If life is a human right, so is insulin.\nUS Congress must pass a law to limit the price insulin makers can charge for a vial of insulin. Capping the price per vial to no more than it sells for in other countrieswouldbenefit all Americanswithdiabetes, while still allowing insulin makers to maintain huge profit margins on insulin\u2014which costs less than $5 to produce.8 Price capped insulin would also save taxpayers billions in annual Medicare expenditures on insulin. Most importantly, price caps would end the status quo where around a million Americans spend over 40% of their post-subsistence income on insulin.5\nAmericans overwhelmingly support a price cap on insulin.9 Congress must listen to patients with diabetes, and it must cap insulin prices for all. As I wrote in 2017, \u201cFor grassroots patients like me . . . this is quite literally a fight for our lives. We will not be silenced, we will continue to disrupt the status quo pharma has enjoyed for decades at the expense of our health and finances, and we will not stop until [insulin is] affordable and easily accessible to all those who need [it] for survival.\u201d1\nWe will continue our fight to achieve affordable insulin for all who need it in the US.\nCompeting interests: I have read and understood BMJ policy on declaration of interests and declare the following interests: none.\nProvenance and peer review: commissioned; not externally peer reviewed.\n1 Marston L.
