1. **Investigate the use of alternative spatial learning modules:** The paper proposes two spatial learning modules, namely local proximity modeling and global correlation learning, to approximate the functionalities of GNNs. Future research could explore other spatial learning modules that can further improve the performance and efficiency of SimST. For example, one could investigate the use of attention mechanisms or graph convolutional networks with different architectures.


2. **Explore the application of SimST to other spatio-temporal forecasting tasks:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SimST for traffic forecasting. Future research could explore the application of SimST to other spatio-temporal forecasting tasks, such as weather forecasting, air quality forecasting, and energy demand forecasting. These tasks share similar characteristics with traffic forecasting, such as the need to model spatial and temporal dependencies.


3. **Develop more efficient training algorithms for SimST:** The paper proposes a node-based batch sampling strategy to improve the training efficiency of SimST. Future research could develop more efficient training algorithms for SimST, such as distributed training and online learning. These algorithms could further reduce the training time and make SimST more scalable to large-scale datasets.


4. **Study the theoretical properties of SimST:** The paper provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of SimST. Future research could study the theoretical properties of SimST, such as its convergence rate and generalization error. This would provide a better understanding of the behavior of SimST and help to guide the design of future spatial-temporal learning methods.


5. **Combine SimST with other forecasting methods:** The paper focuses on the development of a single forecasting method, SimST. Future research could investigate the combination of SimST with other forecasting methods, such as ensemble forecasting and transfer learning. This could further improve the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting.
