    "abstractText": "Background The COVID\u201019 pandemic has impacted medical professionals\u2019 job satisfaction and was a call to adopt telemedicine. Finding out how far medical professionals are satisfied and ready to use telemedicine would be impor\u2010 tant to improve medical practice. Methods Data was collected from 959 medical professionals from both the governmental and private health sectors in Egypt in 2021 using a specifically designed online questionnaire, to evaluate job satisfaction, perception of tel\u2010 emedicine, and propose solutions to improve medical practice. Results The study revealed low to moderate job satisfaction at governmental (27.2%) and private (58.7%) sectors. Underpayment was the most reported challenge at both sectors (37.8% and 28.3%, respectively). Dissatisfaction with government salary was independently predicted by working at the Ministry of Health and Population (OR = 5.54, 95%CI = 2.39,12.8; p < 0.001). Wage increase (46.10%), medical training of professionals (18.1%), and management of non\u2010human resources (14.4%) were the most proposed solutions to improve medical practice in Egypt. During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, 90.7% of medical professionals had practiced telemedicine with moderate level of perception of its benefits (56%). Conclusions During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, medical professionals reported low to moderate job satisfaction and a moderate level of perception of telemedicine. It is recommended to analyze the healthcare financing system and provide continuous training of medical professionals to improve medical practice in Egypt.",

Underpayment was the most reported challenge at both sectors (37.8% and 28.3%, respectively). Dissatisfaction with government salary was independently predicted by working at the Ministry of Health and Population (OR = 5.54, 95%CI = 2.39,12.8; p < 0.001). Wage increase (46.10%), medical training of professionals (18.1%), and management of non\u2011human resources (14.4%) were the most proposed solutions to improve medical practice in Egypt. During the COVID\u201119 pandemic, 90.7% of medical professionals had practiced telemedicine with moderate level of perception of its benefits (56%).\nConclusions During the COVID\u201119 pandemic, medical professionals reported low to moderate job satisfaction and a moderate level of perception of telemedicine. It is recommended to analyze the healthcare financing system and provide continuous training of medical professionals to improve medical practice in Egypt.\nKeywords COVID\u201119, Job satisfaction, Medical professionals, Telemedicine"

            "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a framework for telemedicine implementation was defined [1\u20133]. However, a systematic review in 2021 indicated that in some countries, certain gaps hindered its implementation such as the lack of rules and regulations regarding the utilization of telemedicine and a lack of telemedicine system integration and infrastructure [4]. In countries with a lack of regulations to authorize and integrate telemedicine services in their national healthcare system, the COVID-19 *Correspondence: Noha Elshaer noha.alshaaer@alexmed.edu.eg 1 Mental Health, Private Practice, Alexandria, Egypt 2 Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt 3 Industrial Medicine and Occupational Health, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt\npandemic was a call to adopt regulations that support broad telemedicine implementation [1, 5\u20137].\nEgypt has taken steady steps in the direction of digital transformation; this has been amplified with the COVID19 crisis, where the Information and Communications Technology sector played an important role through the use of applications that enable organizations to continue their operations while considering health and safety measures [8]. However, implementation of telemedicine in Egypt, like other countries, relies on essential elements; namely, the technology in terms of its availability, training, usability, and quality aspects. In addition, acceptance, financing, organization, and policy and legislation ensuring standardization and security are all required [9, 10].\nTechnology acceptance of both patients and professionals has been identified as the second most reported determinant of a successful telemedicine implementation [9]. The national Egyptian survey conducted in 2020 evaluated the attitude towards telemedicine among the general population. Half of the participants stated that they had formerly used a telemedicine tool mainly video or phone call (39.3%) and mobile application (23.7%). Two thirds of the participants were more likely to favor telemedicine than conventional ways, yet 13.7% found it challenging. The survey results suggested that the majority of Egyptians appear to perceive the benefits of telemedicine positively [11].\nOn the contrary, finding out how far medical professionals are ready to accept and use telemedicine in Egypt has been evaluated in small studies in certain specialties [12, 13]. Studies conducted in other countries during the COVID-19 crisis to evaluate physicians\u2019 perception of telemedicine revealed variable results; for example, a study conducted in northeast Florida in 2020 found physicians had a positive attitude towards the adoption of telemedicine and perceived the quality of health service delivery as comparable to in-person care [14]. On the contrary, in Ireland, health care providers did not universally accepted this mode of health care delivery [15]. A study in the USA 2021 suggested that implementation of telemedicine might be easiest among physicians who perceive the effectiveness of telemedicine, value technologybased workstyle, and have higher satisfaction [16].\nHigh levels of job dissatisfaction were reported among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana and Kenya [17]. A study conducted in Jordan 2021 revealed that being a general practitioner or specialist, working at highly loaded hospitals, suffering from burnout, and low salaries have predicted lower levels of job satisfaction among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic [18]. It has been reported that the COVID-19 crisis had an impact on the physical and psychological\nwellbeing of health care providers in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Work-related stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression were prevalent among health care providers, leaving them vulnerable to suffer from burnout which could lead to a deterioration in the level of job satisfaction [17\u201319].\nEgypt suffers from a shortage of physicians although an average of 10,000 medical students graduate annually [20]. The shortage is believed to be due to the emigration of both qualified trainers and graduates, which is attributed mainly to low job satisfaction [21, 22] and underpayment that has resulted in Egyptian junior doctors leaving their country, especially since some developed countries have easy licensing and registration requirements [20, 23]. A survey conducted in Egypt 2015 found that 85.7% of undergraduate medical students intended to leave Egypt after graduation [22]. Medical professionals\u2019 job satisfaction is a cornerstone for improving the quality of health care [21]. Defining the challenges in medical practice and telemedicine implementation in Egypt is crucial to suggest solutions. The current study was conducted among medical professionals in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate job satisfaction and perception of the benefits of telemedicine, identify challenges, and propose solutions to improve medical practice."

Responses were coded using the \u201cinductive coding\u201d method, where codes arose directly from the survey responses without any predefined set of codes. Though inductive coding is difficult, it was preferred because it is less prone to bias. This method demanded reading every response as follows: reading one response, creating a code to cover it, then reading another response, and applying a previous code or creating a new one to cover it. Throughout that process, a review of codes was done frequently to adjust the codes (split an existing code into two or change its description to cover more responses). More than one researcher interpreted every response, to ensure using multiple perspectives to interpret a single set of data.\nResponses from the survey were exported to a Microsoft Excel file, where an individual response was recorded by placing \u201c1\u201d in each cell where an answer (in a row) matched a category code (in column) to indicate positive response in this category. Sometimes, a single answer entailed multiple different positive responses; this was recorded by placing \u201c1\u201d in every matched category code. Finally, the developed codes were organized into groups of codes related to one another, to create a \u201chierarchical coding frame\u201d which was more powerful and allowed different levels of granularity during the analysis of the results. For instance, the solutions for the improvement of medical practice were organized into six categories according to the World Health Organization health systems\u2019 framework [24]."

This finding denotes a requirement for analysis of the structure and dynamics of healthcare financing in Egypt. According to Fasseeh et\u00a0al. systematic review (2022), in Egypt, governmental health expenditure (GHE) represented approximately one third of the total health expenditure (THE). In the last 12\u00a0years, although THE as an absolute value was increasing, ranging from 139 to 393 billion EGP, THE as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP) was almost stagnant or even declining, with a median of 5.5%. Recently reported GHE (as a percentage of GDP) was 3% (29). However, according to the constitutional obligation in 2014, GHE should gradually rise to match the global levels of THE as a percentage of GDP, which is around 10% (30).\nMoreover, the primary healthcare financing source in Egypt is out-of-pocket expenditure, representing more than 60% of THE, followed by government spending through the Ministry of Finance (37% of THE) (29). Implementation of Universal Health Insurance in the next period is expected to drive the Egyptian healthcare market to a more governmentally funded system, thus reducing the gigantic out-of-pocket expenditure (29, 31, 32).\nIn the present study, the second most proposed solution to improve medical practice was providing mandatory continuous training to medical professionals (18.1%). This supports findings in Schumann et\u00a0 al. study (2019), where searching for training opportunities was found to be a driving factor for migration of Egyptian physicians (20)."

This perception level is similar to that reported in Iran (33); however, a study conducted in Saudi Arabia reported a substantially higher favorable perception level (90%) (34). Professionals\u2019 knowledge about telemedicine and their technology-related skills might have influenced their perception; however, those factors were not evaluated in the current study.\nBenefits of telemedicine reported in the current study were similar to those reported in earlier studies (34\u201337). On the contrary, the most reported disadvantage of telemedicine in the current study was the breakdown of the physician\u2013patient relationship and the inability to perform physical examination (27%). This finding is in agreement with previous findings (35, 36), where it has been suggested that the risk of breakdown in the relationship might be related to factors such as lack of formal training in using telemedical equipment, physical, or mental factors such as suffering from a reduced vision or difficulty of hearing, depersonalization where teleconsultation might be experienced as watching TV not as being real communication, lack of confidence of patients and professionals, and inability to perform entire physical examination over a video link (35).\nMedical professionals in the current study emphasized that telemedicine needs to be legalized in Egypt. An overview of the legislative and policy trend in relation to regulating digital matters suggests that Egypt is adopting a reactive approach that responds to issues with a sometimes-considerable delay (7). For digitalization to achieve its prospects, Egypt needs a nationwide digital ecosystem including universally affordable high-speed Internet, a human capital asset with digital skills, digital platforms, interoperable digital payment services, digital identities, and a legal and regulatory environment (38)."

In addition, an evaluation of the knowledge about telemedicine and technology-related skills would have enabled studying their independent effect on the perception of telemedicine."

            "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, medical professionals reported low to moderate job satisfaction and a moderate level of perception of the benefits of telemedicine. The study highlighted the need to analyze healthcare financing in Egypt and provide continuous training to medical professionals. In addition, future research is required to identify factors related to satisfaction with digital health in general and telemedicine in particular.\nAbbreviations GDP Gross Domestic Product GHE Governmental Health Expenditure HIO Health Insurance Organization MoHP Ministry of Health and Population THE Total Health Expenditure\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions HE: conception and design of the study and drafting the article.
