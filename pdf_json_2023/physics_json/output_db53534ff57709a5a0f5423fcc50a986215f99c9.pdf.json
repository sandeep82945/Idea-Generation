It is well known that the spectral behavior of an organic molecule is strongly related to its structure in both the ground and excited states. The solvent effect on absorption and uorescence spectra is of particular importance.11 Changing the solvent is accompanied by a change in polarity of the surrounding medium, thus affecting the ground and excited states in different ways. So, a systematic analysis of the solvent effect would be useful for studying the excited state behavior of the molecules.11\u201313\ntion, Ain Shams University, Roxy, Cairo,\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nDipole moments for short-lived species provide important information about the excited states, also providing useful information on their emission energy as a function of solvent polarity.11 Various methods have been reported for the determination of the dipole moments of uorescent molecules.14\u201318 Among these, the solvatochromic shi method has been widely accepted for the determination of ground and singlet excited dipole moments because of the linear correlation between the spectral parameters and solvent polarity functions.19\u201321 Since, not many literature reports can be found based on the determination of the ground and singlet excited state dipole moments for the titled molecules (Scheme 1), the present study focused on the solvatochromic shi for the determination of the ground and singlet excited state dipole moments of the synthesized molecules, namely 2-aminochromone-3carboxaldehyde (ACC) and its hydrazones, with semicarbazide hydrochloride and N-phenylthiosemicarbazide yielding 2-[(2- aminochromon-3-yl)methylidene]hydrazine carboxamide (ACMHCA) and 2-[(2-aminochromon-3-yl)methylidene]-N-phenylhydrazine carbothioamide (ACMNPHTCA) (Scheme 1).22,23 The specic and nonspecic interactions between the solvent polarity parameters and solute molecules were studied with the current molecules based on the linear solvation free energy relationship (LSFER).24 The Gaussian 09 program was used based on TD-DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G++(d,p) level\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26587\u201326603 | 26587\nScheme 1 Structural formulas of ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This difference agreed with the IR spectral data and could be attributed to the higher electronegativity of the carbonyl of ACMHCA compared to that of the thione of ACMNPHTCA. This interpretation was further evidenced by shis of the amidic protons (NH2 and NH) at d 6.38, 9.80 for ACMHCA and d 9.89, 11.45 for ACMNPHTCA. These signals also disappeared in the presence of D2O."

The uorescence spectra of 10\u22125 M solutions of ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA were recorded in 11 solvents with different polarities at room temperature. Fig. 2(a) and (b) depict the uorescence spectra for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA in DMF solution, and their emission peak values in different solvents are listed in Table 1.\nAlso, the Stokes shis calculated for the present compounds in diverse polar solvents are listed in Table 2.13,22,23 The magnitude of the Stokes shis of the current organic compounds showed divergent values in different solvents exposing the ranges 7219.8, 1000.0, and 3045.232 cm\u22121 for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively. The observed Stokes shis could be due to changes in the polarizability between the excimer and the dissociative ground state. The magnitudes of the shis in ACC excimer were larger than for its hydrazones, indicating that the ACC excimer was more polarizable.\n26592 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26587\u201326603\nHowever, uorescence is very sensitive to the polarity of the surrounding environment, showing a clear bathochromic shi in all cases here as the solvent polarity increased. Among the three molecules, ACC showed the maximum red-shi (82 nm) and ACMNPHTCA also exhibited a red-shi (65 nm). On the other hand, ACMHCA had a lower tendency for solvent interactions, resulting in a lesser red-shi of the uorescence band (18 nm). These results conrmed that the singlet excited state energy level was more stabilized than the ground state energy level. The large uorescence spectral shis suggest the titled molecules were more polarized in the singlet excited state than in the ground state.18 The solvent effect will be discussed in detail in the solvatochromic section.\nThis interpretation was further conrmed by the negative slopes of DlStoke/nm versus either the theoretical calculated dipole moments of the ground states (mg D\u22121) or the stretching frequencies of the carbonyl and amino groups attached with the chromone moiety (nNH2/cm\n\u22121): DlStoke/nm = 381.28 \u2212 50.999 mg D\u22121, r 0.997, n = 3, DlStoke/nm = 4472.5 \u2212 2.6854 nC]O/cm\u22121, r\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Upon increasing the solvent polarity, the Stokes shi values were found to vary from 8785.2 to 14 172.24, 2968 to 3968, and 2082 to 5127 cm\u22121 for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively. These great differences in Stokes shi values (5387, 1000, and 3045 cm\u22121) for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA indicated a bathochromic shi and ICT due to p / p* transition and conrmed the molecules were more stabilized in polar solvents than in nonpolar ones. This arose from the strong interaction of the singlet excited state with polar solvents; thus, there was a large charge distribution between ground and singlet excited state of the solute molecules, i.e., ACC showed a more pronounced red-shi than its hydrazones ACMHCA and ACMNPHTCA. This nding could be deduced as due to the greater electronic delocalization of ACC than its hydrazones.\nThe quantum yields (f) of ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA were determined using a single point method using 2-aminopyridine as a standard reference, such as in the reported method.38 The quantum yields determined were 0.10, 0.11, and 0.196 in higher polar DMF solution, and 0.08, 0.199, and 0.223 in the least polar benzene solution, for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively, as shown in Table 1. These lower quantum yield values revealed the low lifetime of the excited molecules of the current compounds, whereby they could not be fully protected from collisions with quenchers, in addition to the formation of excimers and/or exciplex. This nding is discussed in detail below.\nFurthermore, the ICT of the present compounds depended on the type of solute\u2013solvent interactions. Increasing the polarity of the solvent quenched the uorescence emission, as evidenced by the negative slopes of the quantum yield (f) with the specic solvent parameters, such as DN, AN, and HBA (b).

            "text": "The solvatochromism of the current compounds, which is used to dene the pronounced change in position and sometimes intensity of a UV/visible and emission bands resulting from the change in the polarity of the medium, can aid estimating the dipole moments both in the ground and excited states. This progression can be utilized to understand the mechanism of solute\u2013solvent interactions, as well as to predict the chemical reaction pathway.\nThe solvatochromic data of the present compounds were analyzed by the linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs) depending on various solvent parameters, such as DN, AN, ET, refractive index (n), dielectric constant (3), and Kamlet\u2013Ta parameters (p*, b, and a). The LSER method was carried out using the solvent parameter as the independent variable and Stokes shi as the dependent variable; rst correlated individually with each one of the solvent parameters to assess them for their ability to provide a reasonable explanation.\nThe analysis results of the LSERs for the Stokes shis data of the investigated compounds with various solvent parameters are summarized in ESI Table 1.\u202021 The results presented in ESI Table 1\u2020 can be evaluated upon the sign of the slopes, the correlation coefficient (r), the number of points that obey the straight line, and the coefficient value of the variables solvent parameter to provide the following information:\n1- The linear relationship of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus DN (Lewis basicity) of the solvents (ESI Fig. 9\u2020) for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA reveals the acidic character of the investigated compounds at ]N+H2 (tautomer B) as indicated from the positive slopes. Furthermore, the trend of the coefficient values (162.5 > 27.7 < 91.3) reected the weakest acidity of ACMHCA, i.e., the degree of acidity of ACC was \u223c6 fold that of ACMHCA and 1.8-fold that of ACMNPHTCA.\n2- However, the positive slope of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus (AN + DN), where AN refers to the Lewis acidity (ESI Fig. 10\u2020), indicates the presence of a basic center, such as the lone pairs on\n26594 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26587\u201326603\nnitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, besides the carbanion (C\u2013O\u2212) in tautomer B, beside the acidic centers. The extent of the basicity could be deduced from their coefficients: 91 > 6.62 <45.12 in the ratio of 14 : 2 : 1 for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively. This result agreed well with that concluded from their 1HNMR data and its correlation with EHOMO/eV given above.\n3- The relationship of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus ENT shown in ESI\nFig. 11\u2020 indicates that ACMHCA had the least polarity of the investigated compounds as designated from their slope's coefcient order: 256.8 > 20.65 < 77.8 for ACC and ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively. The positive slope revealed that the polarity degree as inferred from their coefficients for ACC was \u223c12.4 fold that of ACMHCA and 3.3-fold that of ACMNPHTCA.\n4- The relationship of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus a (solvent hydrogenbond donor, HBD) presented in ESI Fig. 12\u2020 illustrates that the HBD was more prominent in ACC and ACMNPHTCA than ACMHCA as indicated from the coefficient of their slopes (3391 [ 418.81 3155), respectively. The positive slope revealed that the extent of hydrogen-bond-acceptor centers of ACC was about 8 times that of its hydrazone ACMHCA, indicating the consumption of most acceptor centers during the formation of the hydrazones.\n5- Whereas, the relationship of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus b (hydrogen-bond acceptor, HBA) presented in ESI Fig. 13,\u2020 shows the effects of two opposite groups for ACC and ACMNPHTCA (- & + slopes) referring to the dual nature of these compounds, and a poor correlation in the case of ACMHCA. The negative slope indicated hypsochromic shis occurred with increasing the solvent hydrogen bonding effects. The strength of the HBD ability could be deduced from their coefficient values of b (6241.4 > very bad < \u22124618.5, +4149.1) for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively. Thus, the hydrogenbond-donor property of ACC was \u223c1.5-fold that of ACMNPHTCA.\n6- Finally, the relationship of nStoke/cm \u22121 versus p* (dipolarity/polarizability) demonstrated in ESI Fig. 14\u2020 veries the role of nonspecic solute\u2013solvent interactions in the changes of the emission spectra of the current compounds with two opposite groups for ACC and ACMNPHTCA, but the relationship was very bad for ACMHCA.

The presence of two groups with opposite signs of the slope in the cases of ACC and ACMNPHTCA refers again to the dual nature of these compounds depending on the type of solvent used.\nHere, the absorption maximum was almost independent of the nature of the solvent, while the emission maxima were controlled by the solvent polarity. The absolute values of the a, b, and p* coefficients of ACC were 3391, 6241.4, and 13 859; (the ratio was nearly 1 : 2 : 4), respectively. Consequently, the effect of the dispersion\u2013polarization forces was greater than the effect of the orientation\u2013induction interactions. Also, it was observed that the b coefficient was signicantly higher than the a coefficient. Thereby, the H-bond-accepting ability was more powerful than the H-bond-donating ability. The high absolute value of the b coefficient compared to the a coefficient revealed the tendency of a bathochromic effect.39\nAs mentioned above, most the linear relationships of ACMHCA were bad, which might be attributed to the presence of C]O, which is harder than C]S in the other hydrazone. So, multilinear regression (MLR) was used instead, yielding: nStoke/ cm\u22121 ACMHCA = 24 107 cm\u22121 + 412 a \u2212 1168 b \u2212 382 p*, r = 0.912, n = 10. The negative slopes for the b (HBA) and p*, and positive for a (HBD), correlations suggest that the HBD (specic interaction) enhances the red-shi, but HBA (specic interaction) acts in the opposite direction (causes a blue-shi) in addition to the effect of the nonspecic interaction (p*). Finally, it could be concluded that ACMHCA has weak solvatochromic behavior in comparison with ACC and ACMNPHTCA.\nFurthermore, the weight of each solvent parameter on the solvatochromic behavior could be deduced by considering the MLR yields: nStoke/cm\n\u22121 ACMNPHTCA = 23 105 cm\u22121 + 736 a \u2212 4451 b + 187p*, r= 0.90, n= 8. The positive slopes for a andp*, but negative for b correlations suggest the nonspecic interactions could be measured using the solvent's dielectric parameters, such as p*, whereas specic interactions could be measured using a (hydrogen-bond-donor strength) and b (hydrogen-bond-acceptor strength) in addition to the DN (Lewis basicity, AN (Lewis acidity), and ET parameters.\nThe ratios between the contributions of the solvatochromic parameters for the current compounds given above show that most of the solvatochromism was due to the solvent dipolarity/ polarizability rather than to the solvent acidity and basicity. These results could be explained by the effect of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the ]N+H2 and hydrazone tautomers (ACMHCA and ACMNPHTCA).\nConsequently, the effect of the dispersion\u2013polarization forces was greater than the effect of the orientation\u2013induction interactions. However, the H-bond-donating ability dominated over the ability to accept H-bonding, as evidenced from the a coefficient being greater than the b coefficient, indicating a tendency for a bathochromic effect.39 Accordingly, the solventdependent shi of the uorescence spectra of the present compounds could be attributed to various factors, such as:\n(1) Dipole\u2013dipole interactions between the solvent and solute.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

This indicates that Dm = m* \u2212 m, was positive, i.e., the dipole moments of all the systems studied here increased upon excitation. The calculated values of the correlation coefcients of the Stokes shis versus the bulk solvent polarity functions F(3,n) were analyzed using the proposed linear correlation methods13,22,23 reported by Bilot\u2013Kawski, Lippert\u2013 Mataga, Bakhshiev, and Kawski\u2013Chamma\u2013Viallet, as well as by the microscopic solvent polarity parameter ENT 40\u201342 (ESI Table 2\u2020).\nThe ground state (m) and excited state (m*) dipole moments and Onsager cavity radii (a) of ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA were calculated as reported22,23 and were found to be 2.99, 3.47, and 4.42 \u00c5, respectively (Table 3). ESI Table 3\u2020 presents the slopes obtained from the plots of the Stokes shi and averages (( ya + yf)/2) versus the bulk solvent polarity functions. The changes in dipole moment, m, values derived from the obtained slopes (m) are given in ESI Table 1.\u2020 The theoretically calculated ground state dipole moments showed the highest value for the hydrazone ACMHCA, which may be due to the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups located at the extreme ends, which result in maximum charge separation, compared to ACC, which has the minimum charge separation, as shown in Scheme 5, whereas ACMNPHTCA had the highest dipole moment in the excited state. The disagreement between the experimental and theoretical values of m may be attributed to the stronger specic solute\u2013solvent interaction in the solvent media, which are absent in the vapor phase. It was noticed that the m values obtained from the Lippert\u2013Mataga method were relatively large compared to the values obtained by the other methods, especially for ACMHCA, since it does not consider the polarizability effect of the solute. The change in dipole moment upon excitation can be considered a result of the nature of the emitting state and charge transfer.\nIt could be seem that the experimental dipole moment changes (m) (Table 3) were smaller than the theoretical estimates for all cases. The ratios of the singlet excited state dipole moment and ground state dipole moment (m*/m) experimentally and calculated were found to be 1.915, 1.89, and 2.35 (Table 3).\nLinear graphs of the Stokes shi (na \u2212 nf) versus F1 (FL-M), F2 (FB), and E N T, as well as average absorption and uorescence (na + nf)/2 versus F3, were plotted for ACC, ACMHCA, and\n26596 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26587\u201326603\nACMNPHTCA. The solvatochromic plots for ACC are shown in Fig. 3(a\u2013d).\nThe ground (m) and singlet excited state dipole moments (m*) were found to be 2.34 D, 4.48 D (for ACC), 1.798 D, 4.48 D (for ACMHCA), and 2.17 D, 5.42 D (for ACMNPHTCA), respectively, and are tabulated in Table 3. As seen in this table, signicant differences were found for the singlet excited state dipole moment values of the studied compounds, depending on the type of solvatochromic relationship. These differences in the estimated dipole moment values were very probably due to a number of assumptions and approximations that were made concerning the validity of their use; for example, (a) the dipole moments in the ground and excited states were supposed to be approximately collinear43 and (b) the solute molecules were considered to be spherical and consequently, the dipole moment was supposed to remain constant in the Onsager cavity21 as pointed out in the literature.44,45\nThe difference in dipole moment between the ground and singlet excited states suggests that the current molecules had considerable charge distribution in the singlet excited state, which plays an important role in the ICT process. The singlet excited state dipole moment values were found to be higher than that of the ground state, thereby conrming that the molecules were more polarized in the singlet excited state than in the ground state. This also suggests that the molecules have strong solute\u2013solvent interactions, causing a large charge distribution in the singlet excited state.\nAs can be noted in Table 3, the excited state dipole moments (4.48, 3.39, and 5.49 D) were found to be higher than the ground state dipole moments (2.34, 1798, and 2.337 D). The differences ranged from about 2.14\u20133.15 D, indicating that the studied molecules were signicantly more polar in their excited state than in their ground state. Therefore, the solvent\u2013solute interactions should be stronger in the excited state than in the ground state, demonstrating an important redistribution of charge densities between both electronic states.\nThe ground and excited state dipole moments of the current compounds were also estimated assuming that they were parallel such as previously reported.46\u201350 The estimated values are depicted in Table 3. The difference in values of mg and me were compared to the respective values obtained from other methods (ESI Table 3\u2020) and suggest that mg and me were not parallel. This prompted us to estimate the angle between mg and me as reported previously23 and the values were found to be\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The direction of the dipole moment vector in a molecule depends on the centers of the positive and negative charges. Although, non-parallelism between the ground and excited state dipole moments hinders charge migration across the molecule in the excited state more than in the ground state, the angles between them were in the range 65.07\u00b0\u201376.71\u00b0, which is an additional reason for the decrease in the quantum yields.\nFrom Table 3, it could be observed that the dipole moment of the present organic compounds was higher in the rst-excited state compared to in the ground state. The dipole moment increased almost two times upon excitation. This indicates the existence of a more relaxed excited state, due to ICT being favored by the cooperative effects of the 2-aminochromone moieties as donors and the carbonyl/thione groups as acceptors, and suggesting that the present compounds can serve as good nominee components of nonlinear optical materials.51\nThe discrepancies between the experimental and theoretically obtained data using DFT results, which were 5.914, 7.13, and 6.14 D for ACC, ACMHCA, and ACMNPHTCA, respectively, could be attributed to the fact that the theoretical calculations involved the gaseous phase of an isolated molecule while the experimental results were related to solutions."

The HOMO contour of ACC suggests the charge density was localized on the benzene ring, with less on the g-pyrone ring and aldehydic group. However, the LUMOwas concentrated on the benzene, g-pyrone rings, and aldehydic group, but none on the amino group of the chromone moiety. Thus, the delocalization of electrons sees them migrate from the chromone to carbonyl, amino, and phenyl groups. This could be conrmed by a Mulliken charge density plot of the chromone moiety vide infra. Whereas, the HOMO of ACMHCA showed a localization of the charge density all over the molecule, except in the NHph region and on the amino group of the chromone moiety, the LUMO charge density was localized on the benzene and g-pyrone rings and none on the side chain and amino group of the chromone.

The HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap for ACC had the highest value, 4.836 eV, whereas ACMNPHTCA had the lowest value, 3.976 eV, as indicated in ESI Table 4.\u2020 A low value for the energy gap suggests that a molecule is more reactive, so, and has easier p\u2212p* electronic transition. Moreover, the Egap values followed the order: ACC > ACMHCA > ACMNPHTCA; subsequently, ACC was the most stable and ACMNPHTCA the most reactive. The EHOMO values followed the order: ACC < ACMHCA \u223c ACMNPHTCA, while the ELUMO values followed the order: ACC < ACMNPHTCA < ACMHCA.\nThe bond lengths of C]O15, C]O27, C]N18, C]N19, and N18\u2013N19 were computed and found to be 1.25984, 1.25033, 1.30903, 1.39021, and 1.39306 \u00c5, respectively. Thus, the higher electronegativity (more charge density) of N19 related to N18 was antithetical and this was reected by an elongation in the C]N18 (1.30903 \u00c5) and C]N19 (1.39021 \u00c5) bond lengths (ESI Table 4\u2020)."

The emission maxima underwent bathochromic shi as the polarity of the solvent increased, indicating p / p* transitions. The solvatochromic data were analyzed by LSER; accordingly a solvent-dependent shi of the present compounds was noted that could be attributed to variable factors, such as dipole\u2013dipole interactions, a change in the nature of the emitting state induced by the solvent, and nally specic solvent\u2013solute interactions (such as hydrogen bonding). The dipole moments were determined using solvatochromic shi methods. The m* values were found to be higher than the m values, suggesting that the probe molecules were more polar in the excited state. The DFT and TD-DFT theoretical data showed good agreement between the simulated and experimental results. The increase in dipole moment deactivated the biological activities of the investigated compounds for all the screened microorganisms, and vice versa for the effect of the hardness parameter as concluded from their opposite slopes of their linear relationships. FMO analysis suggested the hydrazone ACMNPHTCA was the most reactive molecule and has the most exciting potential in optical devices because it has the lowest band gap. The calculated VOC suggests our molecules are good applicants for organic solar cells. This indicates that ACMNPHTCA may have a very good nonlinear optical response. The current optimistic results should attract the attention of researchers working in this eld of chromonebased hydrazone derivatives.\nAuthor contributions\nOmima M. I.
