            "text": "Agricultural processes generate gigaton quantities of lignocellulosic biomass each year.1,2 Given that biomass contains an enormous amount of CO2 captured and removed from the atmosphere, this biomass represents a priceless contribution to sustainability, but it is signicantly underutilized as a material in its own right. For example, structural materials produced from lignocellulosic biomass would be carbon-negative alternatives to the petrochemically-derived materials widely used in residential and commercial applications. Although signicant progress has been made in the upconversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol, a fuel critical to the green economy, the residual lignin produced aer cellulose extraction is largely discarded as waste or burned as a low-efficiency fuel.3\u20135\nRecent work by our group, however, revealed that lignin\u2013 sulfur composites exhibit mechanical strengths rivalling those\nty, Clemson, South Carolina, 29634, USA.\nineering, Clemson University, Clemson,\n(ESI) available: Proton NMR spectral urves, DMA curves, and stress\u2013strain ra07082k\n0\nof many commercially-available structural materials.6\u20139 A limitation of these composites is that in some applications the lignin component was capped at 5 wt%, even if the monomer feed contained 20 wt% of the lignin derivative. This upper limit of 5 wt% lignin can be attributed to the low miscibility of hydrophilic lignin with hydrophobic sulfur. We therefore hypothesized that esterifying lignin hydroxyl moieties, which are hydrophilic, with unsaturated fatty acid chains, which are hydrophobic, would improve the miscibility of lignin with sulfur and simultaneously introduce olen moieties capable of crosslinking with sulfur.\nThe principal method to prepare high sulfur-content materials (HSMs) is inverse vulcanization (Scheme 1A).10\u201313 Inverse vulcanization employs sulfur as the majority component but is mechanistically identical to Goodyear's traditional vulcanization,2 which employs <5 wt% of elemental sulfur. Inverse vulcanization involves thermal formation of [cS\u2013Sn\u2013Sc] radicals at >159 \u00b0C, whereby subsequent addition of these sulfurcentered radicals to C\u2013C p-bonds produces highly-crosslinked networks comprising stabilized sulfur catenates.14\u201316 In the absence of side reactions, inverse vulcanization is 100% atomeconomical.

Aryl halides, for example, decompose above 220 \u00b0C in the presence of sulfur to give sulfur-reactive aryl radicals, affording HSMs via a process termed radical-induced aryl halide\u2013sulfur polymerization (RASP).9 Anisole derivatives likewise form HSMs when they undergo thermal decomposition in the presence of sulfur at 220\u2013320 \u00b0C, whereupon several moieties undergo facile S\u2013C bond-formation with sulfur or sulfur-centered radicals. This route has been used to prepare durable composite GS80 from guaiacol (Scheme 1B) as well as several HSMs from bisphenol A derivatives.33,34,52,53 At sufficiently low crosslink densities, most HSMs produced by these processes can be recycled by simple melt-casting, owing to the thermal reversibility of S\u2013S bond breakage/formation.54\u201359\nKra (alkali) lignin like that used in the current work has a complex structure (Fig. 1)60 comprising several types of structural subunits that undergoes partial thermal decomposition to form anisole derivatives like guaiacol at 230 \u00b0C. We hypothesized that the reaction conditions for the conversion of guaiacol to GS80 would likewise yield HSMs from oleic acidesteried lignin comprising S\u2013Caryl and S\u2013Calkyl bonds.

            "text": "The primary objectives of the current study were to improve lignin incorporation into HSMs and to elucidate the inuence of reaction temperature on composite properties. Lignin incorporation into HSMs via inverse vulcanization is limited by the poor miscibility of hydrophilic lignin with hydrophobic sulfur. Oleic acid was selected as a derivatizing agent for lignin because it is readily obtained from various biological sources, provides a hydrophobic chain for miscibility with sulfur, provides additional olen moieties for crosslinking, and undergoes facile esterication with lignin hydroxyl groups. The same lot of lignin used for previously reported HSMs was used in this study as well.8 Lignin was esteried via acid-catalysed reaction with oleic acid (Scheme 2) in water at room temperature via a reported green chemical process.61 Excess oleic acid was removed by recursive dialysis using a 14 kDa cut-off membrane to give EL (Scheme 2).\nTotal olen content of esteried lignin (EL) was quantied by integration of the olenic resonance at 5.3 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum to the aldehydic resonance at 10.3 ppm for the internal standard, 2,3,4,5,6-pentauorobenzaldehyde (ESI\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3234\u20133240 | 3235\nScheme 2 Esterification of lignin to form EL followed by inverse vulcanization of EL to form composites ELSx at 180 or 230 \u00b0C.\na Decomposition temperature, here dened as the temperature at which 5% mass loss was observed. b Cold crystallization temperature. c\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This analysis revealed the olen content in EL to be 0.24 mmol g\u22121. Quantication of lignin's total hydroxyl content and of the contribution of each class of hydroxyl-bearing subunit (aliphatic, guaiacyl, syringyl, p-phenolic or carboxylate, Fig. 1) was accomplished using 31P NMR spectrometry of phosphitylated lignin following the reported method (ESI Fig. S2\u2020).62,63 Calculations from a comparison of total hydroxyl content for precursor lignin to that of EL reveal that 7.5% of available hydroxyl sites had been esteried in its conversion to EL. This is consistent with low percentage modication due to the highly crosslinked nature of lignin and consequent inaccessibility of some potential esterication sites.\nEach reaction of EL with elemental sulfur was carried out in a sealed tube under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen at either 180 \u00b0C or 230 \u00b0C, affording composites ELSx@180 and ELSx@230, respectively (x = 80 or 90 wt% sulfur). The reaction mixtures for ELS80@180, ELS90@180, and ELS90@230 remained homogenous for the duration of heating, conrming improved miscibility of sulfur and oleyl-modied EL. Effort to prepare ELS80@230 led to separation of an intractable solid during reaction, so this reaction was not further pursued. The miscibility of EL and sulfur thus has an upper limit of between 10 and 20 wt% at 230 \u00b0C where greater crosslinking is expected. For materials resulting from the homogeneous reaction mixtures, elemental microanalysis conrmed that all lignin in the monomer feed was incorporated into the nal composites. Scanning electron microscopy with elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) further conrmed that the distribution of C and S in the solids was uniform (Fig. S3, ESI\u2020). This is in sharp contrast to reactions of allylated lignin with sulfur, wherein lignin incorporation never exceeded 5 wt%, even if the monomer feed contained 20 wt% lignin derivative.\nUpon cooling to room temperature, ELS90@180, ELS80@180, and ELS90@230 were isolated as readily-remeltable, deep red- to orange-colored solids (Fig. 2). The color of sulfur catenates range from pale yellow for cyclo-S8 to deep red for polymeric sulfur catenates.14,64 The deep red color observed in ELSx@180\n3236 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3234\u20133240\nis diagnostic for the presence of polymeric sulfur catenates in the crosslinked network. The orange color of ELS90@230 is consistent with shorter average sulfur catenate lengths that are expected from increased crosslinking at 230 versus 180 \u00b0C.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed a mass loss event at just above 230 \u00b0C (Table 1 and ESI Fig. S4\u2020), similar to that observed in the sublimation of cyclo-S8. In ELS, this mass loss can be attributed to sublimation of cyclo-S8 entrapped within ELS but not covalently bound to the crosslinked network. Although this mass loss is near the reaction temperature, no mass loss is observed during the reaction because it is performed in a sealed vessel, and any sublimed sulfur depositing on the interior sides of the vessel will melt and return to the reaction mixture. The derivative TGA curve for ELS90@230 (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020) exhibited a decomposition event slightly above 300 \u00b0C, attributable to decomposition of the highly-crosslinked aromatic network.60 Similar thermogravimetric features are displayed by the decomposition of other HSMs comprising highly aromatic organic monomers.7,8,33,34,53\nMelting temperature.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Endothermic peaks at \u223c120 \u00b0C are attributable to melting of cyclo-S8 physically trapped in the material but not covalently incorporated into the crosslinked network. The entrapped, unreacted cyclo-S8 was extracted from each composite using carbon disulde (CS2). Elemental microanalysis conrmed that the CS2-soluble fraction contained only elemental sulfur for ELS90@180 and ELS80@180, thus allowing its quantication. Increased crosslinking caused by higher lignin content predictably yielded more covalently-incorporated sulfur: 16% of added sulfur was covalently trapped in ELS90@180, while 23% was covalently trapped in ELS80@180. These values are typical for similarly-crosslinked HSMs comprising 80\u201390 wt% sulfur. The partial decomposition of lignin backbone at 230 \u00b0C led to some low molecular organic fragments in the soluble fraction of ELS90@230, so free cyclo-S8 alone could not be quantied by this method. Because the amount of covalently-linked sulfur was quantiable for ELS90@180 and ELS80@180, it was possible to calculate the sulfur rank (average number of sulfur atoms per oligo-/ polysulfur crosslink) to be 48 in ELS90@180 and 12 in ELS80@180. Shorter crosslink chains are consistent with higher crosslinking for higher lignin content. These sulfur ranks are also consistent with those of other HSMs comprising 80\u201390 wt% sulfur and similar olen content.8,65\nMicrostructures in ELS composites were elucidated via partial depolymerization with AlBr3 followed by GC-MS analysis of the fragments following a procedure reported previously.9 No fragments were observed that would be expected of species comprising S\u2013Caryl bonds in the ELS composites prepared at 180 \u00b0C, which indicated that crosslinking occurred primarily via inverse vulcanization of the olenic moieties. In contrast, several microstructural subunits having S\u2013Caryl bonds were observed in GC-MS analysis of soluble depolymerization fractions of ELS90@230 (Fig. 3, mass spectra provided in ESI Fig. S6\u2020). These functionalities are the same structural subunits observed in the analogous analysis of GS80 and of other HSMs prepared by the reaction of anisole derivatives with sulfur above 230 \u00b0C.\nFor ELS composites to supplant less sustainable construction materials, they must meet application-specic mechanical strength requirements. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC), for example, must have exural strength > 3 MPa and compressive strength $ 17 MPa (ACI specication 332.1R-06) to be used in residential dwelling foundations (representative stress\u2013strain and plots are provided in ESI Fig. S7\u2013S12\u2020). Mechanical strength characteristics of ELS composites are displayed graphically in Fig. 4. For lignin\u2013sulfur composites synthesized by inverse vulcanization, the highest reported exural strength is 2.1 MPa for LS80, comprising 5% allylated lignin and 95 wt% sulfur.8 The exural strength values for ELS90@180 (3.3 MPa) and ELS80@180 (2.7 MPa) were comparable, and somewhat\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The highest exural strength previously reported for a lignin\u2013sulfur composite is 3.6 MPa for CLS80, a composite prepared via RASP of 20 wt% chlorolignin with 80 wt% elemental sulfur at 230 \u00b0C.9 With a exural strength of 3.9 MPa, ELS90@230 exceeds the previous mark due to crosslinking of olens in ELS whereas only crosslinking through S\u2013Caryl bonds is possible in CLS80. An even higher exural strength (5.6 MPa) has been reported for\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3234\u20133240 | 3237\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 2\n0 Ja\nnu ar\ny 20\n23 .

In this material, the high exural strength could also be attributed to increased crosslink density from lignin\u2013cellulose crosslinks, in addition to sulfur\u2013olen crosslinks. Overall, the exural strength characteristics of the ELS composites are competitive with both load-bearing materials, such as OPC, and nonstructural components, such as Azdel SuperLite\u00ae (glass bre\u2013polypropylene used in automotive door panels).67\nCompressive strengths have not been reported for CLS80 or LS80, but the compressive strength of mAPS95 (17 MPa) is competitive with OPC and compressive strengths of up to 36 MPa have been reported for other HSMs comprising highlyallylated raw biomass and sulfur.43,66 The compressive strengths of ELS composites follow exural strength trends, with a low of 10.9 MPa for ELS80@180, followed by ELS90@180 (20.1 MPa) and a high of 26.8 MPa for ELS90@230. The lower exural and compressive strength of ELS80@180 as compared to that of lesscrosslinked ELS90@180 may seem counterintuitive, but prior work has demonstrated that there is an upper limit to mechanical strength improvements as a function of added organic material for some monomers.52 A higher strength may therefore be attainable when a lower wt% of organic material for which there are more crosslinkable sites per unit mass. This hypothesis is supported by the increase in strength observed in ELS90@230."

Improved miscibility allowed up to 20 wt% lignin incorporation into remeltable HSMs. Crosslink density has a signicant impact on properties of HSMs. In this study, crosslink density was tuned by changing the proportion of monomer feed lignin (10 or 20 wt%) or by the selection of reaction temperature (180 \u00b0C or 230 \u00b0C). At 180 \u00b0C inverse vulcanization occurs, leading to S\u2013Calkyl bond formation. At 230 \u00b0C both inverse vulcanization and reaction of sulfur with lignin's thermal decomposition products occur, facilitating both S\u2013Calkyl and S\u2013Caryl bond formation. Composite exural and compressive strengths were highest when 90 wt% lignin was reacted with sulfur at 230 \u00b0C to give ELS90@230. Composite ELS90@230 exhibits exural (3.9 MPa) and compressive (26.8 MPa) strengths exceeding those of some commercial brereinforced polymer composites and traditional mineral cements used in residential building. These composites thus represent a potential lignin valorisation option that also replaces commercial products whose manufacture produces >8% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.68"

Compounds were separated using a SH-Rxi-5 MS capillary column (Restek Company, Bellefonte, USA: crossbond 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane) having dimensions 30 m (length) \u00d7 0.25 mm (diameter) \u00d7 0.25 mm (lm thickness). The temperature of the injector was initialized to 250 \u00b0C. The temperature was programmed from 40 \u00b0C to 320 \u00b0C at a ramp rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121."

            "text": "CAUTION: Heating elemental sulfur with organics can result in the formation of H2S gas. H2S is toxic, foul smelling, and corrosive. Although we did not observe any mass loss attributable to gas generation, temperature must be carefully controlled to prevent thermal spikes, which contribute to the potential for H2S evolution. Rapid stirring, shortened heating times, and very slow addition of reagents can help prevent unforeseen temperature spikes.\nThe required amounts of elemental sulfur and esteried lignin were weighed directly into a pressure tube under an inert N2(g) environment. Two oil baths were set up at 180 and 230 \u00b0C and two samples for each temperature were prepared using 10 or 20 wt% EL with elemental sulfur. Heating was continued for 24 h with continuous stirring with a magnetic stir bar. No mass loss was observed for any of the reaction tubes, so the solids were isolated in quantitative yield. For ELS90@230 a small amount of elemental sulfur sublimes and 1% of mass is lost due to this. For the reactions carried out at 180 \u00b0C recovery is quantitative.\nElemental microanalysis for ELS90@180. Elemental analysis calcd: C 7.4%, H 0.6%, S 90%; found: C 7.9%, H 0.5%, S 90.2%. The CS2-soluble fraction is 99.2 \u00b1 0.4% sulfur.\nElemental microanalysis for ELS80@180. Elemental analysis calcd: C 14.8%, H 1.2%, S 80%; found: C 14.5%, H 1.1%, S 78.2%. The CS2-soluble fraction is 99.4 \u00b1 0.4% sulfur.\nElemental microanalysis for ELS90@230. Elemental analysis calcd: C 7.4%, H 0.6%, S 90%; found: C 8.4%, H 0.5%, S 89.4% (\u223c1% of the sulfur is lost through sublimation). The CS2-soluble fraction is 98.7 \u00b1 0.4% sulfur."
