    "abstractText": "Thienopyrimidines are structural analogs of quinazolines, and the creation of new 2-alkyl derivatives of ethyl 4-aminothienopyrimidine-6-carboxylates for the study of their anti-proliferative properties is of great pharmacological interest. Some 2-alkyl-4-amino-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 2\u20135 were synthesized, and their cytoand phototoxicity against BALB 3T3 cells were established by an in vitro 3T3 NRU test. The obtained results indicate that the tested compounds are not cytotoxic or phototoxic, and that they are appropriate to be studied for their anti-proliferative and anti-tumor properties. The anti-proliferative potential of the compounds was investigated on MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cancer cells, as well as a MCF-10A cell line (normal human mammary epithelial cells). The most toxic to MCF-7 was thienopyrimidine 3 with IC50 13.42 \u03bcg/mL (IC50 0.045 \u03bcM), followed by compound 4 (IC50 28.89 \u03bcg/mL or IC50 0.11 \u03bcM). The thienopyrimidine 4 revealed higher selectivity to MCF-7 and lower activity (IC50 367 \u03bcg/mL i.e., 1.4 \u03bcM) than compound 3 with MCF-10A cells. With respect to MDA-MB-231 cells, ester 2 manifested the highest effect with IC50 52.56 \u03bcg/mL (IC50 0.16 \u03bcM), and 2-ethyl derivative 4 revealed IC50 62.86 \u03bcg/mL (IC50 0.24 \u03bcM). It was estimated that the effect of the substances on the cell cycle progression was due to cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage for MDA-MB-231, while arrest in G1 was detected for the estrogen (ER)-positive MCF-7 cell line. The tested compound\u2019s effects on the change of the zeta potential in the tumorigenic cells utilized in this study were determined. The calculation which we performed of the physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic parameters influencing the biological activity suggested high intestinal absorption, as well as drug-likeness.",

            "text": "Cancer is a disease caused by mutations in certain genes, and, according to the WHO, it is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The number of cancer-related deaths is expected to reach 11.5 million in 2030. Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of cancer, side effects and drug resistance remain unsolvable problems in the fight against cancer. Therefore, selective and effective chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment are still being sought [1\u20133]. Breast cancer, in particular, is the most prevalent cause of cancer death in women, accounting for 23% of all cancers and 14% of cancer deaths. Based on these concerning data,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176347 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 2 of 21\nit should be noted that research in this area is important not only for the discovery of new drugs and methods of treatment, but also to overcome the psychological load. The isolation of MCF-7 cells (Michigan Cancer Fondation-7) from pleural effusion in the 1970s led to the formation of the MCF-7 cell line, commonly used in many studies [4,5]. The MDAMB-231 (M.D. Anderson\u2014Metastatic Breast 231) cell line is a highly aggressive epithelial human breast cancer cell line, which is also extracted from pleural effusion of a female with mammary adenocarcinoma. This cell line has served as a basis for many investigations dedicated to the creation of new anti-cancer agents [6]. Depending on the breast cancer type, variable therapy treatments can be used, such as immunotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer therapy. The list of the utilized clinic drugs was significantly expanded in the last decade. Nevertheless, active research to discover additional specific targets, as well as new chemotherapeutics, is going on [7\u20139]. The significance of the rational drug design is the basis of many studies aiming to generate novel, small, drug-like molecules. After the development of 4-aminoquinazolines lapatinib, gefitinib, and trastuzumab as anti-breast-cancer agents, a number of thienopyrimidines were synthesized as bioisosteres in order to study their anti-proliferative properties [10,11]. Structural combinations of chalcone with thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinone scaffolds were generated, and their inhibitory activity against MCF-7 cells was proven. Some of the compounds showed anti-cancer and anti-proliferative activities at the G1 phase against MCF-7 cells, which were comparable to those of uracil [12]. 2,3-Disubstituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-ones prepared through one-pot synthesis were reported to inhibit the proliferation of A549 and MCF-7 cells [13]. A series of 2-trifluoromethylthieno[2,3d]pyrimidine derivatives were designed and screened for their anti-tumor effects on MCF-7 and HepG2. Within the series, some derivatives exhibited higher activity than Gefitinib, a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor\u2019s (EGFR) tyrosine kinase [14,15]. Research in the field of ligand-based design led to the discovery of the thienopyrimidine derivatives apitolisib and CUDC-907 inhibiting PI3K kinase and mTOR kinase [16\u201319]. 4-Hydroxy substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines containing isoxazole heterocycle were tested for their cytotoxicity to A549, HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines. The assay indicated that 6-methyl-4-{[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-isoxazol-5-yl-]-methoxy}-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine exhibits a higher IC50 value (4.21 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u00b5M) in comparison to gefitinib (IC50 20.68 \u00b5M) [20]. 5- Amino-2-ethylmercapto-4-phenyl-6-subistituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and studied for their cytotoxicity, then screened against three human breast cancer lines. The most promising compound manifested strong cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line, with IC50 values of 8.3 \u00b5g/mL [21]. The cytotoxic effects of some thienopyrimidines were tested against a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and compared with that of doxorubicin [22]. It was established that 2-(benzylamino)-5,6-dimethylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)one demonstrated cytotoxic activity on the breast cell line MDA-MB-435 (growth percent (GP) = \u221231.02%) [23]. New 4-substituted-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized via the reaction of the corresponding 4-chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives with N-methylpiperazine, morpholine, N-phenylpiperazine, or 1,3-propanediamine. The 4-substituted aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold is another promising backbone for the design and synthesis of potent cytotoxic leads [24]. It has been reported that some 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives show significant potency against MDA-MB-231 and can avoid resistance mediated by Pgp and \u03b2III-tubulin. N4-(4methoxyphenyl)-N4-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine has demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects in an in vivo xenograft model (MDA-MB435) [25]. Many investigations on thienopyrimidine\u2019s anti-cancer properties have been conducted and published [26\u201329]. Despite the results which have been achieved, no medicaments effective enough for the treatment of breast cancer have been developed yet. That is why the creation of new small molecules with good efficiency is of great importance. As can be seen from Figure 1,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 3 of 21\nthe thienopyrimidines can be considered as bioisosteres of the biological nitrogenous bases uracil and adenosine.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 22\nxenograft model (MDA-MB-435) [25].

The structures of thienopyrimidines 2\u20135 were identified through IR, 1H-NMR spectra, and elemental analysis. The stretching vibration of the ester groups in the thiophene ring gave rise to IR bands within the range of 1722\u20131711 cm\u22121. In the 1H NMR spectra, the signals of the thiophen ester group -OCH2CH3 appeared in the form of a triplet at 1.3\u20131.4 ppm for the -CH3 group and a quartet at 4.0\u20134.4 ppm for the -CH2- group. The signals of the -CH3 group attached to the thiophen ring were detected as singlets at 2.85\u20132.87 ppm. In the 13C NMR spectra, the thiophen ester group -OCH2CH3 was characterized by signals at 61\u201362 ppm (for the -CH2-) and ca. 14 ppm (for the -CH3), while the signals for the methyl group at 5-position were observed at ca. 15 ppm. The differentiation of the methylene and methyl signals was clearly visible from the DEPT (distortions enhancement by polarization transfer) NMR spectra (Figures S5d\u2013S8d in the Supplementary Material). The different combinations of methyl/methylene groups of the substituents in the pyrimidine rings also had very characteristic patterns: the methylene groups resonated within the range of 32\u201342 ppm, and the methyl groups of compounds 4 and 5 within a broader range, i.e., 12\u201322 ppm, respectively. The assignment of the H and C signals was confirmed by heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra (Figures S5e\u2013S8e in the Supplementary Material). The assignment of the NMR signals was also supported by the prediction of NMR isotopic shielding by B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations in DMSO solvent (GIAO method) for all compounds (Tables S1\u2013S4 in the Supplementary Material). The comparison between the calculated and experimental data demonstrated that C5 in the thiophen ring (bearing the methyl group) was characterized by a signal at ca. 140 ppm; C6 and \u03b2C by signals in the interval of 114\u2013120 ppm; and C2, C4, \u03b1C, and the C-atom from the carbonyl group by signals in the interval of 160\u2013169 ppm. The signals for the amino group protons were detected at ca. 7.3\u20137.4 ppm only in the spectra of compounds 2 and 4, while in the spectra of 3 and 4, they were lacking, most probably due to an exchange of protons with the water present in the solvent. Nevertheless, the presence of the amino group in all four compounds was unambiguously confirmed by the two IR absorption bands for N-H stretching vibrations in the ranges of 3490\u20133400 cm\u22121 and 3375\u20133280 cm\u22121, as well as the band for scissoring vibration of the amino group at ca. 1640\u20131660 cm\u22121, which was found in the IR spectra."

The cell line BALB 3T3, clone A31 (mouse embryo fibroblasts), was incubated with the test compounds at a concentration from 15 to 4000 \u00b5g/mL for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. The cytotoxicity and phototoxicity were expressed in percentages relative to the negative control determined. Dose\u2013response dependence was observed for all of the tested thienopyrimidines. The obtained results are shown in Figure 3. Based on the dose\u2013response curves, the CC50/PC50 values (50% cytotoxic/phototoxic concentration) were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (Table 1). The CC50 values can be used to calculate the PIF (photo-irritancy factor) for each test compound according to the following formula: PIF = CC50/PC50. The PIF demonstrates the probability that the test compound may cause a phototoxic effect (PIF < 2: not phototoxic; PIF \u2265 2 < 5: probable phototoxicity; PIF \u2265 5: phototoxic). The PIF < 2 obtained for all tested compounds shows a high level of photo safety.\nIn our study, as a positive control for phototoxicity, acridine orange (AO) was used.

The G1 phase occurred between the M and S phases, i.e., the stage in which cells are preparing to divide. After treatments, increases of 11%, 20%, and 20.5%, respectively, compared to the control were detected in this phase. Regarding the highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, 4.38% of the cells of the untreated control were in phase G2, a period of rapid cell growth and protein synthesis during which the cell prepares itself for mitosis. Dramatic increases in the percentage of cells in this phase were observed after the treatments, i.e., 53.65%, 44.9%, and 45.9%, which suggested the existence of a block at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The data presented in Table 4 demonstrate that the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 9 of 21\ntested compounds have different effects on estrogen (ER)-positive and -negative breast cancer lines. The inhibitory effect on cell proliferation occurred due to cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage for the ER-negative MDA-MB-231, while arrest in G1 was detected for the ER-positive MCF-7 cell line.\n2.2.4. \u03b6-Potential Measurement\nSurface electrical charge is specific for each cell type, and is especially important in malignant cells because it determines their state of aggregation and adhesion in the organs. Nearly all metabolically active cancer cells are known to secrete a large amount of lactate as mobile anions. The increased levels of glucose uptake and lactate secretion could be up to 30 times those of normal cells, which is the basis for cancer-detection technologies such as PET (positron emission tomography) scan diagnostics. Cancer cells may have slightly elevated surface contents of negatively-charged immobilized molecules (e.g., sialic acid), i.e., 30\u201350% more than normal cells [33\u201339]. The treatment of tumorigenic (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and non-tumorigenic (MCF10A) cell lines with compounds 2, 4, and 5 demonstrated that these compounds were able to affect their \u03b6-potential, as shown in Figure 6. First, the \u03b6-potential of each cell line was measured, and all obtained values were negative (Figure 6A). The Student t-test statistical analysis which was applied distinguished the \u03b6-potentials of the three studied cell lines with p < 0.05, and the values followed the order of MCF-7 > MDA-MB-231 > MCF-10A. The cells treated with compounds 2, 4, and 5 exhibited more negative \u03b6potential values. Figure 5B represents the relative percentage change of the \u03b6-potential induced by the studied compounds for the different cell lines. Compound 2 was able to decrease the \u03b6-potential of the cells with the following ranking: MCF-7 (42%) > MCF-10A (24%) > MDA-MB-231 (16%). For compound 4, the ranking was as follows: MCF-10A (50%) > MDA-MB-231 (46%) > MCF-7 (3%). For compound 5, this was MCF-10A (36%) > MCF-7 (22%) > MDA-MB-231 (23%). The \u03b6-potential of all studied cell lines was negative: MCF-7 > MDA-MB-231 > MCF10A (Figure 6), which is consistent with the data obtained for anti-proliferative activity (Tables 3\u20135). The investigated compounds 2, 3, and 5 showed lower anti-proliferative activity against MCF-10A in comparison to the manifested cytotoxicity against the tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. As mentioned above, cancer cells have a higher zeta potential due to the negatively charged mobile lactate products in elevated glycolysis. After treatment with compounds 2, 4, and 5, the changes in the zeta potential were not of the same rank. MCF-10A showed higher electrical potential compared to the metastatic cells. One reason for this surprising effect could be the higher percentage of mitotic cells, as can be seen in Table 4, where the surface area is nearly double. The dielectric properties of a cell are determined by the distribution of surface charges, cell size, and morphology, as well as the conductivity and permittivity of their membranes, and could also affect the zeta potential. Henslee et al. have shown that the average radii (\u00b5m) are MCF-10A 9.25, MCF-7 9.1, and MDA-MB-231 8.93 with membrane capacitance (F/m2) of MCF-10A 0.0194, MCF-7 0.0186, and MDA-MB-231 0.0163. This describes the specificity of the dipolophoretic electric properties of breast cancer models [4,39]. On the other hand, cell membranes\u2019 electrical charges are also affected by the sialic acid present in glycolipids and glycoproteins [38,40], as well as the different number of microvili on the cell surface [39,41]. Therefore, it could be speculated that the changes occurring after treatment with the three thienopyrimidines are related to the altered sialic acid, the synthesis of more microvilli rich in lipid rafts, and the externalization of a higher content of negatively charged phosphatidyl serine from the inner to the outer part of the bilayer membrane. The fact that surface electrical properties also depend on phospholipid metabolism should not be overlooked. The membrane of MCF-10A is more ordered in comparison to the tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, which has been confirmed by reports in the literature that the membranes of malignant cells are more fluid compared to the membranes of non-cancerous cells. The highly metastatic\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 10 of 21\ncell line MDA-MB-231, however, showed a higher order compared to MCF-7, possibly due to the higher cholesterol content of the highly metastatic cell line [40,42,43].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 22 glycolysis.

It could be further assumed that the specific physico-chemical features of the three types of cells with different metastatic potential, such as different dielectrophoretic potential, phospholipid composition, microvilli, or cell cycle distribution, play an additional role in the surface electrical properties of cells after compound treatment (Figure 6)."

            "text": "An important goal of drug research is to gain sufficient understanding of the molecular properties that limit oral bioavailability in order to facilitate the design of viable new drug candidates. Lipophilicity and the number of hydrogen bond donors appear to be key properties, as they remain essentially constant in oral medications over time. The number\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 11 of 21\nof H-donors and H-acceptors affects the polar surface of the molecule and reduces the rate of its membrane penetration, which correlates with the bioavailability. Therefore, it is important to calculate the lipophilicity and the physico-chemical parameters of the studied compounds which affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicological properties. The physico-chemical properties of the compounds given in Table 5 were generated using the Molinspiration software, v2013.09 [41,44]. The descriptors of the synthesized ligands (Table 5) are consistent with Lipinski\u2019s rule of five, without any violations [42,45]. Equally important to the characterization of a ligand as a drug candidate is the determination of ligand efficiency (LE). LE is related to the Gibbs free energy of binding for a heavy atom, and may serve to establish the preferred pharmacophores of the leads. The calculation of LE can be performed using the equation given below (1) [43\u201349]:\nLE = pIC50 \u00d7 1.37/HA (kcal/mol) (1)\nLigand lipophilicity efficiency (LLE), also known as lipophilic efficacy (LipE), is related to the possibility of transferring the ligand from 1-octanol to the active site of binding. It has been proposed as a better alternative to LE to capture the enthalpic component of ligand binding [47,48,50,51]:\nLLE = pIC50 \u2212 cLogP (2)\nSince lipophilicity and effectiveness play important roles in the development of new drug candidates, it is essential that their values be greater than 0.3 and 3, respectively [49,52]. As can be seen, the LE and LLE values of compounds 2\u20135, given in Table 5, are higher than 0.3 and 3. The absorption of a drug intended for oral intake depends on its dissolution, i.e., on the solubility of the chemical compound. For this reason, solubility is another important parameter that should be considered when describing biological properties and bioavailability, in particular. SwissADME [50,53] was used to calculate the possible solubility [51\u201356] and to determine the drug-likeness of the studied compounds. The obtained results regarding the solubility of compounds 2\u20135 are given in Table 6.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 12 of 21\nLog S (ESOL\u2212Estimated SOLubility) is a method for the estimating the aqueous solubility of a compound directly from its structure [51,54]. Log S (Ali) solubility is calculated by an alternative model for predicting aqueous solubility by incorporating TPSA [52,55]. Both methods differ from the basic solubility equation, avoiding the melting point parameter. The third method for the establishment of solubility was developed by SILICOS-IT. The linear correlation coefficient was corrected by molecular weight, and its value was R2 = 0.75 [54,57]. The results obtained by the use of the Ali method revealed that all compounds exhibited moderate solubility. The calculations by the other two methods determined the compounds as soluble, except for compound 3. These results are a sign that the compounds can be considered as orally applicable candidates. The pharmacokinetic properties of a drug include the relationship between its absorption, distribution, and inactivation. The passage of drugs across cell membranes is a key part of most pharmacokinetic processes. The most important route by which a drug crosses cell membranes is passive diffusion, the rate of which is determined by molecular size, concentration gradient, lipid solubility, degree of drug ionization, and protein binding. The calculated results, given in Table 7, indicate that thienopyrimidines 2\u20135 could exhibit high gastrointestinal absorption. According to the calculation, a high gastrointestinal absorption (GI) was characteristic of all compounds, although they may not pass the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). On the other hand, the compounds were predicted not to act as substrates of Pg (protein that pumps substances out of cells), which is beneficial, as if they were to enter the central nervous system, they would not be eliminated by the Pg protein. The studied thienopyrimidines might behave as CYP (cytochrome P450 superfamily) substrates/inhibitors towards 1A2, 2C19, and 2C9, but not to members of the 2C6 and 2C4 CYP families.\n* TPSA values calculated by Molinspiration differ from those calculated with SwissAdme.\nThe data related to drug-likeness correspond to five rules, bearing the names of their authors. For Ghose et al. [54,57], the calculated logP should be between \u22120.4 and 5.6, with an average value of 2.52. For molecular weight, the qualifying range is between 160 and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 13 of 21\n480, with an average value of 357. For molar refractivity, the qualifying range is between 40 and 130, with an average value of 97. According to Egan\u2019s rule, a compound demonstrates good bioavailability when its TPSA value is within the range of 0 \u2265 tPSA \u2264 132 \u00c52 and \u22121 \u2265 logP \u2264 6 [55,58]. In researching the molecular properties affecting oral bioavailability, Veber et al. concluded that the polar surface area (PSA) should be \u2264140 \u00c52, while a number of rotatable bonds \u2264 10 or a sum of H-bond donors and acceptors \u2264 12 are sufficient and selective criteria for determining a drug candidate [56,59]. The results in Table 5 show that the physico-chemical characteristics of the compounds were in accordance with the aforementioned rules. Muegge\u2019s rule is based on the so-called pharmacophore point filter, the role of which is to distinguish substances that are drug-like and those that are not, which is based on simple structural rules. To pass filtering, a candidate drug must receive two to seven pharmacophore points [57,60]. For compounds with a carboxylic acid, amine, amidine, or guanidine pharmacophore point, the survival threshold is lowered to one. The compounds which pass the PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds) filter or pan-assay interference compounds are prominent sources of false positives in the drugdiscovery process [61]. The bioavailability radar in Figure 7 is a graphical depiction of the drug-likenesses of compounds 2\u20135. As can be seen from Figure 7, the values of the lipophilicity, size, polarity, solubility, saturation, and flexibility of compounds 2\u20135, summarized in the SwissADME radar of bioavailability, support that the compounds meet the requirements for drug likeness.

On the other hand, this compound showed a higher selective action index towards the investigated cancer cells.

Biological Assay 3.2.1. Chemicals\nThe reference chemical (phototoxic/non-phototoxic drugs), acridine orange (Loba chemie Ltd., Fischamend, Austria), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany. The cell culture reagents were Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). The disposable consumables were supplied by Orange Scientific, Braine-l\u2019Alleud, Belgium.\n3.2.2. Cell Lines\nAll breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection\u2014ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA) without antibiotics. The non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-10A) was cultivated in DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 20 ng/mL human epithelia growth factor (hEGF), 10 \u00b5g/mL insulin, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL hydrocortisone without antibiotics. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere, with 5% CO2 at 37 \u25e6C.\n3.2.3. Cytotoxicity and Phototoxicity Testing\nBALB/3T3 cells were cultured in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks in DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/mL and streptomycin-100 \u00b5g/mL) at 37 \u25e6C, 5% CO2, and 90% relative humidity. Cytotoxicity/phototoxicity was assessed by a validated BALB/3T3 clone A31 neutral red uptake assay (3T3 NRU test) [60,63]. Briefly, cells were plated in a 96-well microtiter plate at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/100 \u00b5L/well and incubated for 24 h. A wide concentration range was applied for the test compounds. For the phototoxicity tests, 96-well plates were irradiated with a dose of 2.4 J/cm2, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. After treatment with neutral red medium, washing, and treatment with the ethanol/acetic acid solution, the absorption was measured on a TECAN microplate reader (TECAN, Gr\u00f6dig, Austria) at a wavelength of 540 nm. The light source which we used was a light-emitting diode (LED) matrix\u2014an artificial solar light simulator Helios-iO, model LE-9ND55-H\u20145500K (SERIC Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cytotoxicity/phototoxicity were expressed as CC50/PC50 values (concentrations required for 50% cytotoxicity/phototoxicity), calculated using non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Software GraphPad Prism 9.5.1, San Diego, CA, USA). The CC50 values were\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 17 of 21\nused to calculate the PIF (photo-irritancy factor) for each test substance, according to the following formula:\nPIF = Cytotoxicity (CC50)/Phototoxicity (PC50) The statistical analysis included the application of one-way ANOVA, followed by\na Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was accepted as the lowest level of statistical significance. All results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD.\n3.2.4. In Vitro Anti-Proliferative Activity\nUsing the standard MTT-dye reduction assay described by Mosmann [62,64], the anti-proliferative activity was tested. The method is based on the metabolism of the tetrazolium salt MTT to insoluble formazan. The formazan absorption was registered using a microplate reader at \u03bb = 540 nm. The measured absorption is an indicator of cell viability and metabolic activity. Anti-proliferative activities were expressed as IC50 values (concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cell growth), calculated using non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n3.2.5. Cell Cycle Analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining\nThe cells were trypsinized, suspended in medium + 10% FCS, and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min); then, the pellet was suspended in PBS (1 mL) and fixed with EtOH. The cells were suspended in 2.5 mL pre-cold 70% EtOH and incubated on ice for 15 min. The staining procedure was as follows: the pellet was suspended in a 500 \u00b5L PI-solution in PBS and 0.1 mg/mL RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 was added. After incubation for 10 min at 37 \u25e6C, the cells were transferred to the flow cytometer and cell fluorescence was measured. The samples were measured by flow cytometry (LSR II, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using BD FACS DIVA software v. 6.1.3 (BD Biosciences).\n3.2.6. \u03b6-Potential Measurement\nThe zeta (\u03b6 \u03be) potential is the electrostatic potential at the shear plane of a cell, and is related to both its surface charge and the local environment. The \u03b6-potential of the intact cells and the treated ones was recorded in a cell suspension (0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) in PBS, using the electrophoretic light-scattering technique on a Zetasizer Nano ZS analyzer (Malvern Instruments, Great Britain). Laser Doppler electrophoresis and velocimetry of cells were used to determine the \u03b6-potential by measuring the speeds of the cells in PBS upon the application of an electric field. The \u03b6-potential was calculated based on the Helmholtz\u2013Smoluchowski equation. The measurements were performed in a U-shaped cell with gold-plated electrodes at 37 \u25e6C. The statistical analysis included the application of one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni\u2019s post hoc test, and p < 0.05 was accepted as the lowest level of statistical significance. All results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. All experiments were performed in triplicate."

The results of the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity test which we performed showed that the studied compounds were not toxic towards BALB 3T3 cells. Compounds 3 and 4 demonstrated the highest antiproliferative activity towards MCF-7; the IC50 values were 0.045 \u00b5M for 3 and 0.11 \u00b5M for 4, respectively, but the thienopyrimidine 4 showed a much higher selectivity index (SI-12.7 vs. SI-3.38) and lower cytotoxicity against MCF-10A cells, which makes this compound preferable for further research. The highest anti-proliferative effect against MDA-MB231 was demonstrated by compound 2, with IC50 0.16 \u00b5M and SI 9.6, followed by the thienopyrimidine 4, with IC50 IC50 0.24 \u00b5M and SI 5.8. On the basis of the cell cycle analysis, it was established that the revealed inhibitory effects of thienopyrimidines 2, 4, and 5 on cell proliferation of the tested cells was due to cell cycle arrest in the G2 stage for the ER\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6347 18 of 21\nnegative MDA-MB-231, while for the ER positive MCF-7 cell line, the arrest was detected in the G1 phase. The results obtained by the treatment of tumorigenic (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A) cell lines with compounds 2, 4, and 5 indicate that these substances are able to affect the \u03b6-potential of the cells. The anti-proliferative ability of compound 4 against the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines and its physico-chemical properties identify it as a lead compound.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28176347/s1.
