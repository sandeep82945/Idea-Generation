    "abstractText": "Skeletal muscle undergoes rapid and extensive atrophy following nerve transection though the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We previously showed transiently elevated Notch 1 signaling in denervated skeletal muscle that was abrogated by administration of nandrolone (an anabolic steroid) combined with replacement doses of testosterone. Numb is an adaptor molecule present in myogenic precursors and skeletal muscle fibers that is vital for normal tissue repair after muscle injury and for skeletal muscle contractile function. It is unclear whether the increase in Notch signaling observed in denervated muscle contributes to denervation and whether expression of Numb in myofibers slows denervation atrophy. To address these questions, the degree of denervation atrophy, Notch signaling, and Numb expression was studied over time after denervation in C57B6J mice treated with nandrolone, nandrolone plus testosterone or vehicle. Nandrolone increased Numb expression and reduced Notch signaling. Neither nandrolone alone nor nandrolone plus testosterone changed the rate of denervation atrophy. We next compared rates of denervation atrophy between mice with conditional, tamoxifen-inducible knockout of Numb in myofibers and genetically identical mice treated with vehicle. Numb cKO had no effect on denervation atrophy in this model. Taken together, the data indicate that loss of Numb in myofibers does not alter the course of denervation atrophy and that upregulation of Numb and blunting of the denervation-atrophy induced activation of Notch do not change the course of denervation atrophy.",

            "text": "Skeletal muscle demonstrates marked and rapid atrophy upon nerve transection [1]. Abundant evidence links increased destruction of sarcomeric proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system to denervation atrophy [2, 3]. Several key signals have been identified as critical drivers of denervation atrophy. Studies from the Kandarian lab showed critical roles for activation of NF-kB [4]. Studies with mice lacking the expression connexin (Cx) 43 and 45 in skeletal muscle fibers implicated de-novo sarcoplasmic integration of these membrane channels in denervation atrophy, reduction of resting membrane potential, activation of NF-kB and entry of sodium\nand calcium into denervate myofibers [5, 6]. It was later shown that miniature end plate potentials stimulated by quantal release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals were sufficient to prevent appearance of Cx in the sarcolemma and thereby prevent denervation atrophy [7]. In Sprague Dawley rats, the anabolic steroid nandrolone (Nan) slowed denervation atrophy slightly though significantly when treatment was combined with testosterone and started at day 29 after nerve transection [8]. Studies of the underlying mechanism found that, in rats, denervation atrophy was associated with a transient elevation in Notch1\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n377\nsignaling via increased nuclear levels of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and upregulation of the Notch target gene Hey1 [9]. Treatment with Nan reduced the nuclear levels of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and the expression of Hey1 to baseline values [9] and resulted in elevated levels of the adaptor protein Numb. Effects of Nan on changes in Notch1 expression and activation may depend on the model of muscle atrophy. For example, in one study of hind-limb unloading, Notch1 expression was decreased, and this change was prevented by 14 days pre-treatment with Nan [10]. Notch 1 is a member of the Notch family of cell-surface receptors. Signaling via Notch is activated by binding of specific ligands which trigger release of the NICD which is translocated to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression [11]. Notch promotes proliferation of satellite cells and suppresses their myogenic differentiation [12, 13]. More recent studies using genetically modified mice implicate Notch signaling in maintaining healthy myofibers [14]. Paradoxically perhaps, Notch signaling has been implicated in muscle loss due to cancer cachexia [15]; Notch signaling was elevated in atrophied muscles of mice bearing tumors while a Notch inhibitor reduced atrophy [15]. Thus, Notch is required for skeletal muscle fiber homeostasis but excessive Notch signaling may stimulate muscle atrophy. It is unclear whether Notch signaling contributes to denervationrelated atrophy. Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its role in asymmetric division of progenitors in nervous system development [16]. It has been implicated as having critical roles in many contexts that include development of the central nervous system and heart [16, 17], inhibition of sonic hedgehog signaling through the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch [18], targeting Notch 1 and NICD for proteolytic destruction via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [16] and cancer biology [19, 20]. Numb plays critical roles in suppressing Notch signaling in response to canonical Wnt signaling [21], a critical step in cell fate determination. Numb expression is upregulated by canonical Wnt signaling via recruitment of TCF-LEF family members to the Numb promoter [22]. In skeletal muscle, decreased expression of Numb in satellite cells delays tissue repair and reduces body and muscle size, possibly through upregulation of myostatin [23]. Numb is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle fibers where it is required for optimal muscle contractility and sarcomeric structure. Numb level decreases in mouse gastrocnemius muscle with aging suggesting that aging related muscle weakness may be the result of reduced Numb expression [24]. Whether Numb protects against skeletal muscle\natrophy is unknown. The objective of the current study was to better understand the possible role(s) of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers in denervation atrophy. Our hypothesis was that genetic ablation of Numb expression in skeletal muscle fibers would accelerate denervation atrophy and that, by abrogating denervation-induced increases in Notch signaling, upregulation of Numb by nandrolone would slow denervation atrophy. To test if loss of Numb in skeletal muscle fibers changed the rate of denervation atrophy, we used genetically modified mice in which Numb knockouts can be conditionally induced in myofibers by injection of tamoxifen. To understand whether upregulation of Numb and abrogation of denervation-induced increases in Notch signaling slowed denervation atrophy, we evaluated muscle atrophy, Notch signaling and Numb levels in vehicle or nandrolonetreated mice. These studies showed no influence of either nandrolone-induced increased Numb or genetically ablated Numb levels on rates of denervation atrophy in mice."

Animals were euthanized by exsanguination.\nExperiment 1 77 males were used for these experiments because they had been used in our prior experiments evaluating effects of nandrolone on muscle mass after denervation in rats [8, 25, 26] and because the androgens used are likely to be virilizing in females. Mice underwent denervation or sham denervation with implantation of Alzet mini osmotic pumps (Alzet, Model 1004).

            "text": "Experiment 1\nEffects of a continuous infusion of nandrolone (0.75 mg/kg/week) on muscle atrophy over time was tested in male C57B6J mice. Following denervation, gastrocnemius muscle weights were significantly reduced at 7 days (18%, p < 0.0001, 14 days (48%, p < 0.0001) and 21 days (55%, p < 0.0001) as shown in Fig.\n1a-c. Weights of denervated muscle from nandrolonetreated mice were not different from those from denervated gastrocnemius from vehicle-treated at any of these time points (Fig. 1a-c). A similar pattern of atrophy was observed for EDL and soleus muscles for which, again, no protection against denervation atrophy was provided by nandrolone (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, nandrolone alone did not afford any protection against denervation atrophy in C57B6J mice.\nExperiment 2 We then determined using male C57B6J mice if seven days of nandrolone treatment combined with a low dose of testosterone reduced muscle atrophy when initiated at the time denervation surgery or at day 29. This experimental design was chosen because in our prior studies with rats we observed using a treatment approach that combined nandrolone (0.75 mg/kg/week) with testosterone slowed denervation atrophy when started at day 29 after nerve transection [8]. When comparing the extent of atrophy between gastrocnemius (Fig. 2) versus soleus and EDL muscles (Supplementary Fig. 2), the most severe atrophy was observed in gastrocnemius. Consistent our findings for with experiment 1, at seven days after denervation, gastrocnemius muscle mass was approximately 18% lower than mass of sham-denervated gastrocnemius (Fig. 1, p<0.0001) and was not altered by a seven-day treatment with nandrolone plus testosterone (Fig. 2a, p = 0.9985). At thirty-five days after denervation, gastrocnemius muscle mass was reduced by 62% when compared to sham-denervated gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 2d, p < 0.0001) and a seven-day treatment with nandrolone/testosterone (Nan/TS) slightly (9.9%) though non-significantly\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n380\nincreased the gastrocnemius muscle mass (Fig. 2b, p = 0.263). Nan/TS did not significantly alter weights of denervated EDL or soleus at either 7 or 35 days after denervation (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d). We next examined effects of Nan/TS on Notch signaling in gastrocnemius muscle from these same mice at 7 and 35 days after transection. Notch intracellular domain (NICD) levels were significantly elevated in nuclei isolated from frozen denervated gastrocnemius muscle collected from vehicle-treated mice at 7 days after nerve transection (Fig. 2) as compared to sham transected animals (Fig. 1a-b) but were not different when comparing sham versus denervated muscle from vehicle-treated mice at 35 days (Fig. 3c-d). At seven days after nerve transection, nuclear NICD levels were significantly lower in denervated gastrocnemius from Nan/TS treated mice as compared to denervated muscle from vehicletreated mice (Fig. 3a-b). At thirty-five days after denervation, NICD levels were not significantly different when comparing denervated muscle from Nan/TS treated and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3c-d).\nExpression of Hey1, a downstream target of NICD, [8] was tested in gastrocnemius muscle at 7 days after denervation. As compared to sham-denervated muscle, Hey1 mRNA levels were increased by 75 % in denervated vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4a) and were significantly reduced by treatment with Nan/TS (Fig 4a). Expression of Numb mRNA was significantly increased in denervated muscle from mice treated with Nan/TS when compared to denervated muscle from vehicle-treated mice at 7 days (Fig. 4b) but was not different when comparing denervated and sham-denervated muscle from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4b). Numb protein levels were not different when comparing muscle from denervated versus sham-denervated vehicle-treated mice at either 7 or 35 days after denervation (Fig. 5a-b). Nan/TS significantly increased Numb protein levels in denervated muscle as compared to denervated muscle from vehicle-treated mice at both 7 days after denervation by more than 3-fold and at 35 days after denervation by more than 2-fold (Fig. 5a-b).\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n381\nExperiment 3 The above findings indicate that nandrolone increases Numb expression in denervated gastrocnemius muscle from mice and this is associated with reduced levels of NICD and of Hey1 mRNA expression. These changes, however, do not slow the course of denervation atrophy indicating that raising Numb levels does not alter the trajectory of denervation atrophy and suggesting that elevated NICD/Hey1 do not drive such atrophy. We recently demonstrated that Numb is present within myofibers and that a conditional inducible deletion of Numb in myofibers results in reduced muscle force generation, disorganization of sarcomeres and defects in\nmitochondrial size and function [24]. We therefore asked whether physiological levels of Numb within myofibers would protect against denervation atrophy. HSA-MCM/Numb(f/f)/NumbL(f/f) mice allow the conditional, inducible knockdown of Numb in skeletal muscle myofibers while not affecting muscle progenitor cells [24]. HSA-MCM/Numb(f/f)/ NumbL(f/f) mice were randomized to either induction of Numb knockouts by tamoxifen treatment or treatment with vehicle. At fourteen days after the start of tamoxifen or vehicle treatment, mice underwent a left sciatic nerve transection and right shamtransection in which the nerve was exposed but not manipulated and mice were euthanized 7, 14 or 28 days later. When comparing the left denervated gastrocnemius muscle weights with those for the right sham-denervated control in the vehicle-treated cohorts, weights of the denervated muscle were significantly reduced by amounts similar to that previously observed for C57B6J mice. Specifically, muscle weights of denervated gastrocnemius isolated from vehicle-treated HSA-MCM/Numb(f/f)/ NumbL(f/f) mice were reduced by approximately 21% at 7 days (Fig. 6a), 35% at 14 days (Fig. 6b) and 56% at 28 days (Fig. 6c). For tamoxifen-treated HSA-MCM/ Numb(f/f)/NumbL(f/f) mice reduced about 20% between sham and denervated muscle at 7 days (Fig. 6a); by 28% and 57% at 14 and 28 days, respectively (Fig. 6a-c). When comparing the right shamdenervated gastrocnemius muscle weights between\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n382\nthe vehicle-treated and tamoxifen-treated groups, muscle weights were slightly reduced in the tamoxifen-treated mice at 7 and 14 days after surgery but were not different at 28 days after surgery (Fig. 6a-c). When comparing gastrocnemius muscle weights between denervated vehicle and denervated tamoxifen-treated groups, no differences in weights were observed at any time of the points evaluated (Fig. 6a-c). Total protein was isolated from gastrocnemius muscle and plantaris muscle. HSA\u2010 MCMNumbf/f/NumbLf/f mice were treated with vehicle or tamoxifen and sacrificed 21 days post\u2010 induction, which corresponds 7 days after\ndenervation. (a) Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of Numb protein in gastrocnemius muscle and plantaris muscle (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

            "text": "The above findings support several conclusions. In mice, as was true in rats, denervation induces activation of Notch 1 signaling which was reflected in increased nuclear NICD levels and Hey1 mRNA expression. Nandrolone plus testosterone increased Numb expression in denervated muscle at 7 and 35 days and blocked the increases in nuclear NICD and Hey1 mRNA. In contrast to our prior findings in rats,\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n383\nnandrolone alone or combined with testosterone did not significantly slow denervation atrophy. Conditional, inducible knockout of Numb and NumbL did not alter the rate of denervation atrophy. Taken together, the findings indicate that denervation atrophy is uncoupled from Numb expression levels, NICD levels or Hey1 expression. Thus, the data support the conclusion that neither Numb expression levels nor Notch 1 activation contributes significantly to denervation atrophy. There are several caveats to consider when interpreting results of the above experiments. The first is that the cell type(s) in which changes in nuclear NICD occurred were not defined; immunofluorescence studies and confocal microscopy approaches were not successful in detecting nuclear NICD in these tissues. The second is that a limitation of our system for knocking down Numb expression in myofibers uses doses of tamoxifen that slightly reduce muscle weights which could mask a small effect of the Numb knockdown on rates of muscle atrophy. Despite this limitation, the dramatic atrophy observed in vehicle and tamoxifen treated mice at 28 days does suggest that the knockdown of Numb in myofibers did not appreciably alter the trajectory of denervation atrophy. The findings in mice largely recapitulated our prior observations in rats showing that denervation induced transient upregulation of Notch 1/Hey1 signaling that was prevented by nandrolone plus testosterone in association with increased Numb expression. In our prior studies in rats, we observed a slight though significant slowing of denervation atrophy when nandrolone plus testosterone treatment was initiated at day 29 after nerve transection. While we found no significant difference in weights of denervated muscle between nandrolone-testosteronetreated mice and vehicle-treated mice at any time point, a trend toward a slight protection against atrophy was noted in mice for which treatment was started at 29 days. It is possible that with a larger group size this difference would become statistically significant. In summary, using an approach whereby Numb expression levels were increased pharmacologically or reduced genetically, no effects of Numb levels on progression of denervation atrophy were observed. Furthermore, in pharmacologic studies, Numb expression, NICD levels and Hey1 expression were coupled, but were not related to progression of denervation atrophy. Collectively, the data do not support a role for Notch 1/Hey1 signaling in driving denervation atrophy or indicate a role for Numb in protecting against denervation atrophy. Because aging reduces expression of Numb [28], one question\nraised by our data is whether the progression of muscle fiber atrophy resulting from denervation caused by the aging process is altered by the reduced expression of Numb in muscle of old organisms. Further investigation is needed to answer this question."
