    "abstractText": "We have studied the radiative decay of the 2s state of one-electron and one-muon ions, where the two-photon mechanism plays an important role. Due to the nuclear size corrections the radiative decay of the 2s state in the electron and muon ions is qualitatively different. Based on the accurate relativistic calculation, we introduced a two-parameter approximation, which makes it possible to describe the two-photon angular-differential transition probability for the polarized emitted photons with high accuracy. The emission of photons with linear and circular polarizations was studied separately. We also investigated the transition probabilities for the polarized initial and final states. The investigation was performed for ions with atomic numbers 1 \u2264 Z \u2264 120.",

Due to the nuclear size corrections the radiative decay of the 2s state in the electron and muon ions is qualitatively different. Based on the accurate relativistic calculation, we introduced a two-parameter approximation, which makes it possible to describe the two-photon angular-differential transition probability for the polarized emitted photons with high accuracy. The emission of photons with linear and circular polarizations was studied separately. We also investigated the transition probabilities for the polarized initial and final states. The investigation was performed for ions with atomic numbers 1 \u2264 Z \u2264 120.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe two-photon transitions represent one of the fundamental processes in the atomic physics. The twophoton decay is best studied for one-electron ions, which is the dominant decay channel of the 2s-electron state for light and middle Z H-like ions, where Z is the atomic number. The probabilities of one- and two-photon transitions become comparable for Z \u2248 40. The decay of the 2s-electron state has been extensively studied in theoretical [1\u201312] and experimental works [13\u201324]. In the reverse process, the two-photon excitation 1s \u2192 2s, a record accuracy of measurement of the transition frequency in hydrogen was obtained [25]. For the onemuon ions the two-photon decay is the main radiative channel for all ions.\nThe experimental investigation of the 2s \u2192 1s transition in muon ions was performed in [26, 27]. Since significant progress has recently been made in the quality of muon beams [28], the study of muon ions becomes relevant.\nUnlike the one-photon decay, the emission spectrum of the two-photon decay has a continuous distribution determined by the energy conservation law. The study of the differential transition probabilities is of particular interest. The energy-differential transition probabilities were investigated theoretically in [3\u20135, 8, 11, 29\u201331].\nFor the one-electron ions the radiative corrections to the transition probabilities are investigated in works [31\u201333]. The dominant part of the electron self-\nenergy radiative correction to the two-photon transition probabilities were calculated in [32, 33]. The vacuum polarization corrections (in the Uehling approximation) are presented in [31]. Contribution of the negative continuum of the Dirac spectrum to the total and differential transition probabilities is investigated in [9] and [11], respectively.\nThe angle-differential transition probabilities have a nontrivial dependence on the angle between the emitted photons. The angular distribution of the emitted photons is determined by the dominant E1E1 transitions, which gives 1 + cos2 \u03b8 distribution, where \u03b8 is the angle between the momenta of the emitted photons. The deviation from this distribution was investigated by Au in the nonrelativistic limit [6]. The deviation leads to an asymmetry of the angle-differential transition probability, which is explained by the interference between the E1E1 and higher multipoles (mainly E2E2 and M1M1). For the one-electron ions the asymmetry of the angular distribution was investigated for unpolarized photons emitted by ions of xenon and uranium in [10].\nIn this work, the asymmetry of the angular distribution is investigated for both unpolarized and polarized emitted photons for all one-electron and one-muon ions including the super heavy elements. The difference between the relativistic calculation of the asymmetry and the calculation of Au [6] reaches three times for the super heavy elements. In the case of light ions, the asymmetry is small, but important for evaluating the nonresonant corrections [34]. The nonresonant corrections set the\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n10 10\n2v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 2\n1 A\npr 2\n02 2\n2 limit of the concept of energy levels and are already taken into account in the most accurate experiments [35]. The polarization properties of the two-photon transitions were studied in the processes of elastic photon scattering on atoms [36\u201338].\nWe consider the two-photon decay of the 2s state of one-electron and one-muon ions with atomic numbers 1 \u2264 Z \u2264 120 within the relativistic theory. We found that the radiative decay of the 2s state in the electron and muon ions is qualitatively different. In particular, for one-electron ions, the only cascade channel is 2s \u2192 2p1/2 \u2192 1s, which is negligibly weak, mainly due to the small energy difference between 2s and 2p1/2 states [31]. In the case of one-muon ions, the situation is different. First, there is another cascade channel: 2s\u2192 2p3/2 \u2192 1s. Second, the energy difference between the 2s and 2p states is sufficiently large, so that the cascade channels become dominant already for the middle Z ions. All this radically changes the decay of the 2s-muon state.\nWe also present the investigation of the angle differential transition probabilities with respect to the polarization of the emitted photons. We studied the differential transition probabilities for the emission of a photon with certain linear and circular polarizations, as well as the transition probabilities for polarized initial and final states. Recently it was reported that the detector technology for the measurement of the linear photon polarization (appearing in the Kshell radiative electron capture by heavy ions) was significantly improved [39]. We introduced a twoparameter approximation for the differential transition probabilities, which was used to analyze different polarizations of photons even in the relativistic domain. The two-parameter approximation describes with a high accuracy the angle-differential transition probability (even for Z = 120, the accuracy is better than 1% for the photons with equal energies), in particular, it explicitly describes the asymmetry of the angular distribution. It was found that the negative continuum of the Dirac equation is of great importance for the asymmetry parameter even for light ions (the transverse gauge was used)."

            "text": "In this paper, we consider the radiative decay of oneelectron and one-muon ions. Since the muon can be considered as a \u2019heavy\u2019 electron (the muon mass is about 207 of the electron mass), the application of the theory developed for electron ions to muon ions consists in replacing the mass of the electron with the mass of the muon [40]. In this section, we present the theory of twophoton decay of one-electron ions.\nWe note, that we do not consider the magnetic hyperfine structure. The hyperfine structure of the muon ions was investigated in [41].\nThe two-photon decay of the 2s state of one-electron\nions can be schematically depicted as\n2s\u2192 1s+ \u03b31 + \u03b32 . (1)\nThe Feynman graphs corresponding to the two-photon decay are presented in Fig. 1, where the double lines represent electrons in the electric field of the atomic nucleus (the Furry picture). The graphs (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 differ in the order of the emitted photons. Index n denotes the summation over the complete Dirac spectrum, including the positive and negative energy continuum.\nUsing the Feynman rules, the S-matrix element for transition from the initial state (i) to the final state (f) corresponding to graph (a) in Fig. 1 can be written as\nS (a) i\u2192f = (\u2212ie) 2 \u222b d4x1d 4x2\u03c8f (x2)\u03b3 \u00b52A\u2217(k2,\u03bb2)\u00b52 (x2)\n\u00d7S(x2, x1)\u03b3\u00b51A\u2217(k1,\u03bb1)\u00b51 (x1)\u03c8i(x1) , (2)\nwhere e is the electron charge,\nS(x1, x2) = i\n2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9ne \u2212i\u03c9n(t1\u2212t2) \u2211 n \u03c8n(r1)\u03c8n(r2)\n\u03c9n \u2212 \u03b5n(1\u2212 i0) (3)\nis the electron propagator, \u03c8i and \u03c8f are the wave functions of the initial and final states, respectively, A\u00b5 is electromagnetic four-potential. The sum includes the summation of the discrete Dirac spectrum and the integration over the positive and negative continuum. In Eq. (3) index n denotes a set of quantum numbers (n = (n, j, l,m)) defining an intermediate state with principal quantum number n, angular momentum j, parity (\u22121)l and projection of the angular momentum m. The photon wave functions A\u00b5(k,\u03bb) are considered in the transverse gauge where the scalar photons are absent\nA\u00b5(k,\u03bb)(x) = (0,A(k,\u03bb)(r, t)) . (4)\nThe vector part of the photon 4-vector expresses as\nA(k,\u03bb)(r, t) = A(k,\u03bb)(r)ei\u03c9t . (5)\n3 The relativistic units are used throughout the paper (~ = 1, c = 1).\nThe amplitude is connected with the S-matrix as\nSi\u2192f = \u22122\u03c0i\u03b4(\u03b5f + \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03b5i)Ufi , (6) where \u03b5i and \u03b5f are the energies of the initial and final states.\nIntegrating over the time variables in Eq. (2) and introducing the following matrix elements\nA \u2217(k1,\u03bb1) ni = \u222b dr\u03c8+n (r)(\u22121)\u03b1A\u2217(k1,\u03bb1)(r)\u03c8i(r) , (7)\nA \u2217(k2,\u03bb2) fn = \u222b dr\u03c8+f (r)(\u22121)\u03b1A \u2217(k2,\u03bb2)(r)\u03c8n(r) , (8)\nwhere \u03b1 are the Dirac alpha-matrices, we obtain the following expression for the amplitude corresponding to the graphs (a)\nU (a) fi = e 2 \u2211 n A \u2217(k2,\u03bb2) fn A \u2217(k1,\u03bb1) ni \u03b5i \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03b5n , (9)\nSimilarly the expression for the graph (b) in Fig. 1 reads as\nU (b) fi = e 2 \u2211 n A \u2217(k1,\u03bb1) fn A \u2217(k2,\u03bb2) ni \u03b5i \u2212 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03b5n . (10)\nIn the case of the one-electron ions, the energy of the intermediate 2p1/2 state is placed between the energies of 1s and 2s states (\u03b51s < \u03b52p1/2 < \u03b52s), the considered two-photon decay can proceed through the formation of the 2p1/2 state (cascade decay). Direct accounting for the 2p1/2 state leads to a zero denominator, if frequency of one of the photons is \u03c91,2 = \u03b5i \u2212 \u03b52p1/2 . Considering this state, it is necessary to make numerous insertions of the electron self-energy Feynman graph into the internal electron line [42]. This procedure adds the self-energy correction \u2206\u03b52p1/2 = L \u2212 i2\u0393 to the Dirac energy \u03b5n corresponding to the 2p1/2 state, where L is the Lamb shift and \u0393 is the one-photon radiative width of the 2p1/2 state. We note that evaluation of the Lamb shift L is a question of renormalization and it is neglected in the present calculation. However, the imaginary part of the self-energy correction (radiative width \u0393) was taken into account. In this approach, zero denominators do not arise.\nWe note that in the case of one-muon ions, between the energies of the 1s and 2s states there is also the 2p3/2 state (\u03b51s < \u03b52p3/2 < \u03b52s). Accordingly, such a procedure must be performed for the 2p3/2 state as well.\nThe total transition amplitude is the sum of the contributions of the graphs (a) and (b)\nUfi = U (a) fi + U (b) fi . (11)\nThe two-photon differential transition probability reads as\ndW (\u03bb1,\u03bb2) fi = 2\u03c0 \u2223\u2223\u2223Ufi\u2223\u2223\u22232\u03b4(\u03b5i \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03b5f ) \u00d7 dk1\n(2\u03c0)3 dk2 (2\u03c0)3 . (12)\nAfter integration over one of the photon energies we obtain the following differential transition probability\ndW (\u03bb1,\u03bb2) fi\nd\u21261d\u21262d\u03c91 =\n1\n(2\u03c0)5 \u2223\u2223\u2223Ufi\u2223\u2223\u22232\u03c921\u03c922 , (13) where \u21261,2 is the solid angle of the corresponding photon momentum. The energy of the second emitted photon is determined by the energy conservation law\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 = \u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5f . (14)\nIt is convenient to introduce the energy sharing fraction\nx(\u03c91) = \u03c91\n\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5f . (15)\nTo describe the polarization of a photon, we introduce a unit vector directed along the photon momentum\nk\u0302 = sin \u03b8k cos\u03d5ksin \u03b8k sin\u03d5k cos \u03b8k  , (16) the vector ez = (0, 0, 1) and two vectors orthogonal to k\u0302\ne(1) = [ez \u00d7 k\u0302] |[ez \u00d7 k\u0302]| , e(2) = [e(1) \u00d7 k\u0302] |[e(1) \u00d7 k\u0302]| . (17)\nIn spherical coordinates, these vectors read as\ne(1) = \u2212 sin\u03d5kcos\u03d5k 0  , e(2) = cos \u03b8k cos\u03d5kcos \u03b8k sin\u03d5k \u2212 sin \u03b8k  . (18) The photon polarization vector (\u03bb) can be presented as a linear combination of the vectors e(1) and e(2)\n(\u03bb) = \u03b11e (1) + \u03b12e (2) , (19)\nwhere |\u03b11|2 + |\u03b12|2 = 1 . To calculate the matrix elements in Eqs. (7) and (8), we use the partial wave expansion of the photon function\nA(k,\u03bb)\u2217(r) =\n\u221a 2\u03c0\n\u03c9 (\u03bb)\u2217e\u2212ikr\n=\n\u221a 2\u03c0\n\u03c9 \u2211 jlm (\u2212i)l( (\u03bb),Yjlm(k\u0302))\n\u00d74\u03c0jl(kr)Y \u2217jlm(r\u0302) , (20)\nwhere j(kr) is the spherical Bessel function. The scalar product involves the complex conjugation for the first element. Integration over the spatial angular variables (r\u0302) is performed analytically, and integration over the radial variables is performed numerically.\nIn Eqs. (9) and (10), summation over the complete Dirac spectrum is performed using the finite basis sets for the Dirac equation [43, 44].\nWe used the Fermi distribution of the nuclear charge density. The nuclear root mean square charge radii were\n4 taken from [45\u201347], they are listed in Tables VI and VII. We note, that for Z = 1 the Fermi distribution is inapplicable, so we used the model of a homogeneously charged sphere. In the case of muon ions, the transition probabilities are sensitive to the nuclear model used. To study it, we also performed a calculation with the model of a homogeneously charged sphere.\nFor the one-muon ions, the nuclear recoil correction was taken into account using the reduced muon mass. In the case of the muon ions, the main radiative correction is the electron vacuum polarization correction, which can be taken into account within the Uehling approximation. For one-electron ions, the nuclear recoil correction and the radiative corrections were neglected because of their smallness [31]."

            "text": "We investigate the radiative decay of the 2s state in one-electron and one-muon ions. We consider ions with atomic nuclear charges in the range from 1 to 120. The main attention is paid to the role of two-photon decay.\nThe 2s state is the longest-lived among the states of the L-shell, i.e. the 2s, 2p1/2, 2p3/2 states. Tables I and II give the transition probabilities for these states for electron and muon ions, respectively. The radiative decay of 2p1/2, 2p3/2 states is determined by the onephoton (E1) transitions to the 1s state. For the electron ions, the dominant channel of the 2s state radiative decay depends on the nuclear charge Z: for light ions, the twophoton (mainly E1E1) transitions predominate, while for heavier ions (Z > 40), the decay is determined by onephoton (M1) transitions. For muon ions the radiative decay is determined by the two-photon (E1E1) transition for all Z. Therefore, in Tables I and II, the total 2s \u2192 1s transition probabilities are given as the sum of the one- and two-photon transition probabilities. Below we consider the decay of 2s states in more detail. The last column of Table I contains data for the 2s \u2192 2p1/2 transition probability for one-electron ions. The data show that this cascade channel is very small. This is explained by the fact that the 2s and 2p1/2 energy levels are very close in one-electron ions. We will show that in the case of one-muon ions this channel is significant.\nThe results presented in Tables I and II are obtained separately for the point-like nucleus (W (e,\u00b5) 0 ) and for the Fermi distribution of nuclear charge density (W (e,\u00b5)). The data show that for the electron ions, the nuclear size corrections are noticeable only for very heavy ions, while for the muon ions they are of great importance even for light ions. For example, for the muon ions with Z = 50 the 2s \u2192 1s transition probabilities calculated with the point-like and the Fermi-distribution of nuclear charge density differ by one order of magnitude. Another remarkable fact is that for muon ions the nuclear size\ncorrections decrease the transition probabilities for the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states, but increase them for the 2s state for Z > 5.\nFor the one-electron ions, the one-photon transition probabilities are listed in [48], the nuclear size corrections are considered in [49]. The two-photon transitions for the 2s-electron state were investigated by many authors [6, 9, 11, 12, 31].\nThe results of calculating the transition probabilities for the 2s state of one-electron ions are presented in Table III. In the double column marked \u2018M1: 2s \u2192 1s\u2019 the one-photon (M1) transition probabilities (W (e)) and their power dependence (pW ) on Z are given. For small Z the transition probabilities are proportional to Z10, for large Z this dependence changes, reaching Z13 for Z = 120. The next multicolumn (E1E1: 2s \u2192 1s) presents the results for the two-photon transition probabilities (W (e)) and their power dependence (pW ); the calculation was carried out in the approximation where only E1 photons were taken into account. In the columns marked \u20182s \u2192 1s,Total 2\u03b3\u2019 the results for the total two-photon transition probability (W (e)) and their power dependence (pW ) are listed. In the mentioned columns, the transition probabilities were obtained by averaging over the projections of the total angular momentum of the initial state (mi) and summing over the final projections (mf ). Due to the different power dependence (pW ) on Z of the one- and two-photon transition probabilities, the two-photon decay dominates for Z \u2264 40, while for larger Z, the decay occurs mainly via single photon M1 emission. The presented data show that taking into account only the E1 photons is a good approximation: even for heavy elements its accuracy does not exceed 1%. However, below we will show that higher multipoles are of importance for differential transition probabilities. The transition probabilities for non-spinflip (mi = mf ) and spin-flip (mi = \u2212mf ) transitions are listed separately in the next columns. The spinflip transition probability for one-photon M1 transition is 2/3W (e,\u00b5), the non-spin-flip transition is 1/3W (e,\u00b5), where W (e,\u00b5) is the total M1 transition probability either for a one-electron or one-muon ion, respectively. In contrast to the one-photon transition, the two-photon transitions occur mainly without the spin-flip. We note, that in the case of the two-photon transitions, the nonspin-flip and spin-flip have different Z dependencies. For a hydrogen atom, the two-photon transition probability with the non-spin-flip is 9 orders of magnitude larger than the transition probability with the spin-flip. For the heavy ions, this difference is only 1.5 order of magnitude. We also compare our results for transition probabilities with the results obtained in work [9], where only E1E1 transitions were considered. Our results are in reasonable agreement. The transition probabilities for a point-like nucleus are presented in work [12], where an analytical expression for the Dirac Coulomb Green\u2019s function was used, and in work [31], where the finite basis sets for the Dirac equation constructed from B splines was employed\n5 [43, 44] (as in the present work). In work [31] the vacuum polarization corrections (in the Uehling approximation) to the transition probabilities were calculated. The results of our calculation (for 1 \u2264 Z \u2264 92) are in complete agreement with work [31], so we do not give their results.\nIn Tables IV and V we give various transition probabilities for the radiative decay of the 2s state of the muon ions. We see that the radiative decay channels of the 2s state for electron and muon ions are qualitatively different. First of all, it should be noted that the order of the energy levels of the L-shell for electron ions and for muon ions is different. In Tables VI and VII we present the bound energies of the 1s, 2s, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states for one-electron ions and one-muon ions, respectively. We can see that, in the case of one-electron ions, only the 2p1/2 state is placed between the 2s and 1s states and the possible cascade channel of decay 2s \u2192 2p1/2 is very week even for super heavy ions (see the last column of Table I). In the case of one-muon ions the both 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states are below the 2s state (see Table VII). The cascade decay channels 2s\u2192 2p1/2 and 2s\u2192 2p3/2 are strong and become dominant for Z > 30 (see Table IV). In Fig. 2 we present the differential transition probabilities for electron and muon uranium ions presented as a function of x (the parameter x is defined by Eq. (15)). The figure demonstrates that for the electron ions the contribution of the cascade channel is not noticeable, while for the muon ions the cascade channels dominate. The differential transition probabilities are symmetric with respect to the middle energy of the emitted photon (x = 12 ). The cascade transitions 2s \u2192 2p1/2 \u2192 1s (the first and the fourth peeks) and 2s \u2192 2p3/2 \u2192 1s (the second and the third peeks) are represented by the resonances in the differential transition probabilities. In Fig. 3 we show the differential transition probabilities for the muon ions for several Z. We can see the increase in the contribution of the cascade transitions with increasing nuclear charge Z. Since the cascade channels are strong in muon ions, the energy of the 2s \u2192 2p and 2p \u2192 1s transitions can be measured, which will provide information about the structure of atomic nuclei.\nThe second important feature of the muon ions is that the nuclear size corrections are of great importance. For Z > 5 these corrections decrease the one-photon transition probabilities and increase the two-photon transition probabilities (see Table IV). Since, in the case of the muon ions, the two-photon decay of the 2s state is dominant for all Z, the nuclear size correction increase the total transition probability of the 2s state. The importance of the nuclear size correction for the muon ions is explained by the fact that the muon is placed much more close to the nucleus than the electron. The values of the root mean square orbital radius of the corresponding states (r(e,\u00b5) = \u3008\u03c8(e,\u00b5)|r2|\u03c8(e,\u00b5)\u30091/2) are given in Table VI and VII. We see that in the case of the muon ions the root mean square radii of the L-shell states are very close to the root mean square radii of\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 x\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nZ=92, electron Z=92, muon\nFIG. 2. The differential transition probabilities (in s\u22121keV\u22121) for electron and muon ions for Z = 92 are presented as a function of the energy sharing fraction x [see Eq. (15)].

In Fig. 4 we present the ratio between the one-photon and two-photon transition probabilities for the electron and muon ions. For small Z these ratios are close for electron and muon ions, but for heavy ions they become very different. The difference between these ratios shows the role of the nuclear size corrections for the\n6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120\nZ\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2 electron muon\nFIG. 4.

However, the radii of the nuclei depend on Z nonlinearly. Accordingly, the Z-dependence of the transition probabilities (where the nuclear corrections are taken into account) is cumbersome. So, we do not present the Zdependence of the transition probabilities for the onemuon ions where the nuclear charge corrections are taken into account.\nIn Tables II, IV we compare our results with the data presented in [26]. In general, our data are in reasonable agreement. The only serious discrepancy is found for the two-photon transition probability for Z = 30 in Table IV.\nWe also investigated the contribution of the E1E1 transition for the muon ions and the separate contributions of the spin-flip and non-spin-flip transitions. In Table V we can see that for the muon ions as well as for the electron ions the E1E1 transition is dominant. However, in contrast to the one-electron ions, for the one-muon ions the spin-flip transition becomes significant for Z > 10.\nFor the one-electron ions, the nuclear size corrections and the vacuum polarization corrections (in the Uehling approximation) for the two-photon transition probabilities were investigated in [31]. In general, these corrections are noticeable only for the heavy ions. In contrast to the one-electron ions, for the one-muon ions these corrections are of importance even for the light ions. In Table VIII we present various corrections to the transition probabilities. We see that the transition probabilities calculated with the point-like nucleus have\nthe same power dependence on Z as the transition probabilities for the one-electron ions. We can also see the importance of the nuclear size correction: the difference between the data for the point-like nucleus and the data obtained with the Fermi distribution for the nuclear charge density exceeds two orders of magnitude for the heavy ions.\nThe nuclear recoil correction is taken into account using the reduced muon mass. This correction is important only for the light ions. The vacuum polarization correction was taken into account within the Uehling approximation. For the one-muon ions the vacuum polarization correction is noticeable for ions with Z > 10.\nSince the nuclear size corrections are large for the one-muon ions, we investigated the dependence of these corrections on the nuclear model. In Table IX we present the results of calculation with two models of distribution of the nuclear charge density: the Fermi distribution and the nucleus considered as a homogeneously charged sphere. We can see that the difference between these two models reaches 3% for super heavy ions. We estimate the accuracy of our calculation by the difference between these models."

The results for differential (over the angle \u03b8 and energy \u03c91) transition probabilities are given in Fig. 6. These results are in good agreement with work [10].

The approximations (21)-(25) for differential transition probabilities is called the two-parameter approximation.\nThe calculated values of the transition probabilities W and the asymmetry factors A are listed in Table X for one-electron ions and in Table VIII for one-muon ions. We can see that for the muon ions, taking into account the nuclear size corrections leads to a significant\ndecrease in the asymmetry factors. For the small Z ions, the asymmetry factors for muon and electron ions are comparable, while for middle and heavy ions, the asymmetry factors for muon ions are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than for an electron ion. Accordingly, we will focus on the study of the asymmetry of the angular distribution of the emitted photon only for oneelectron ions, where it is significant. However, for the light ions, despite their small values, nonzero asymmetry factors lead to the appearance of nonresonant corrections, which are discussed in Subsection III E.\nIn Table X, we also give the asymmetry factor obtained from the nonrelativistic calculations [6]. Our results show good agreement with [6] for light ions. However, the discrepancy between our results for Z = 50 is about 5%, for Z = 92 \u2013 41% and for Z = 118 \u2013 more than 3 times. For middle Z and heavy ions the results of nonrelativistic calculation [6] are larger than our results. The calculated values for the differential transition probabilities dW/d\u03c91 with the corresponding asymmetry factors a(x) for x = 1/2, 1/3 and 1/6 are presented in Tables XI-XIII. The accuracy of the parameters A and a(x) is determined by the accuracy of the approximations (21) and (24), respectively. The best accuracy of the two-parameter approximation reaches for x = 1/2. This accuracy is better than 6 \u00d7 10\u22123% for Z = 1 and becomes 1% for Z = 120. In Table XI (x = 1/2) we also give the asymmetry factor derived from work [10]. In work [10] the calculations were carried out for point nuclei, which explains the difference between our results. As follows from Tables XI-XIII, the asymmetry factor a(x) depends on the energy of the emitted photon (\u03c91, \u03c92).\nHowever, the asymmetry factors A and a(x) are almost independent of the angle between the emitted photons."

            "text": "To study different polarizations of the emitted photons, it is convenient to employ the two-parameter approximation.\nWe consider the two-photon emission in coplanar geometry. We assume that the momenta of the emitted photons are placed in the (x, y)-plane, i.e., the polar angles of the photon momenta are \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03c0/2. The xaxis is directed along the momentum of the first photon k1 = \u03c91ex . In this case, the angle between the momenta of the emitted photons is determined by the azimuth angle of the second photon: \u03b8 = min(\u03d52, 2\u03c0\u2212\u03d52) . Then the vectors e1, e2 (introduced in Eq.

The numerical results for the differential transition probabilities (for x = 1/2) as a function of the angle \u03b8 are presented in Fig. 7.

            "text": "According to Eqs. (9), (10), both the positive and negative energy parts of the Dirac spectrum contribute to the two-photon transition probabilities. The contribution of the negative energy part was investigated in the work of Labzowsky [9], where it was shown that its contribution to the total transition probabilities is small. The contribution of the negative continuum to\n10\nthe differential transition probabilities was studied in [50]. It was noticed that contribution of the negative continuum to M1M1 and E2E2 multipole of the twophoton transitions is of great importance [50]. Since the asymmetry of the differential transition probability is a consequence of the interference of the E1E1 multipoles with M1M1 and E2E2 multipoles, the contribution of the negative continuum to the asymmetry factor is very large. In Tables XIV and XV we present the results of the calculations of the transition probabilities, where we give separately the contributions of the positive and negative energy intermediate states for one-electron and one-muon ions, respectively. The calculation was performed in the transverse gauge (see Eq. (4)). The data in Table XIV show that the negative continuum gives the dominant contribution to the asymmetry even for light ions, while the positive energy intermediate states gives the main contribution to the transition probability. In Table XV we can see that the contribution of the negative continuum for one-muon ions is very small even for heavy ions."

            "heading": "E. Nonresonant corrections",
            "text": "The exited energy level is usually characterized by two parameters: the energy and the width of the level. This is the so-called resonant approximation [34]. In this approximation, the line profile is described by the Lorentz contour, and the energy and width of the level do\nnot depend on the particular process of measurement. If we go beyond the resonant approximation, nonresonant corrections arise, which lead to asymmetry of the line profile [42]. Nonresonant corrections are usually very small, but they are of importance since they indicate the limit to which the concept of energy for an excited atomic state has a physical meaning [34]. This corrections were investigated in many works [51\u201354]. In some precision experiments, nonresonant corrections are already taken into account when determining the accuracy of the experiment [35]. These corrections should also be important for precision measurements with muon ions [27]. We would like to note that, for the light ions, the asymmetry factors for electron and muon ions are of the same order of magnitude.\nSince the asymmetry factor has a nonzero value even for light ions, it can lead to nonresonant corrections to the energy levels. In particular, for the hydrogen atom, the asymmetry factor a(x) (for x = 1/2) is equal to 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22126. This asymmetry factor should be compared with the declared accuracy of precise measurements of frequency of 1s \u2212 2s two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen [25], which is 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221215. This measurement was performed in an experiment in which the reverse process was studied: two-photon excitation of 1s state. The asymmetry factor gives a correction to the twophoton transition probabilities due to the nonzero angle between the photon momenta. If the angle spread between momenta equals to \u03b4\u03b8, then this should lead to a relative uncertainty for the transition probability (see Eq. (25))\n( dW\nsin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c91 (\u03b4\u03b8)\u2212 dW sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c91 (0)\n)( dW\nsin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c91 (0)\n)\u22121 = a(x)(1\u2212 cos \u03b4\u03b8) . (44)\nIf \u03b4\u03b8 is about 1\u25e6, then the relative uncertainty given by Eq. (44) is about 9.3 \u00d7 10\u221210. The relative difference between the differential transition probabilities for 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 (given by Eq. (44) with \u03b4\u03b8 = 180\u25e6) is 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125. We note that in the experiment [25] a set of mirrors was used. Thus, photons were absorbed at both 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 angles. For absorption of photons with 0\u25e6 angle between the momenta, the asymmetry factor decreases the transition probability, while for absorption with 180\u25e6, the asymmetry factor increases the transition probability. Accordingly, the presence of absorption of photons at different angles should significantly reduce the described uncertainty. Nevertheless, in principle, the asymmetry factor should be taken into account as a source of nonresonant corrections."

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY",
            "text": "We investigated the radiative decay of 2s state of one-electron and one-muon ions with respect to the polarization of the emitted photons. The investigation was performed for the ions with nuclear charge numbers 1 \u2264 Z \u2264 120. The particular attention was paid to the role of the two-photon decay channel. For both electron and muon ions the most long-lived state of the L-shell is the 2s state. The radiative decay of the 2s state in the electron and muon ions is qualitatively different. In particular, in contrast to electron ions, in the case of muon ions the cascade (2s \u2192 2p3/2 \u2192 1s and 2s \u2192 2p1/2 \u2192 1s) channels are of great importance. For the muon ions taking into account the nuclear size corrections may change the transition probability by several orders of magnitude.\nThe two-parameter approximation is introduced, which makes it possible to describe with high accuracy\n11\nthe two-photon angular-differential transition probability for the polarized emitted photons. The accuracy of this approximation is 10\u22123% for light ions, remaining within 1% even for the super heavy ions (for the photons with equal energies). The parameters of the approximation are the total (or energy-differential) transition probability and the asymmetry factor, they are listed in the tables. Within the two-parameter approximation, the asymmetry factor completely determines the asymmetry of the differential transition probability. For the onemuon ions the asymmetry is very small. For the oneelectron ions the main contribution to the asymmetry factor is made by the negative continuum of the Dirac spectrum. Using the two-parameter approximation, we investigated the various polarizations of the emitted photons. The angular dependence of the differential transition probabilities for the emission of circularly polarized photons is clearly related to the transition probabilities for linearly polarized photons. A nonzero\nasymmetry factor even for light ions can be a source of nonresonant corrections, which can be important for precision experiments."
