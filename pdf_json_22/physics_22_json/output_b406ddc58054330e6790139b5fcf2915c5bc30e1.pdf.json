Combining reciprocal and real-space magnetic imaging techniques, we first observe, in a single ferroelectric domain, the coexistence of antiferromagnetic domains in which the antiferromagnetic cycloid propagates along different wavevectors. We then show that the direction of these wavevectors is not strictly locked to the preferred crystallographic axes as continuous rotations bridge different wavevectors. At the junctions between the magnetic domains, we observe topological line defects identical to those found in a broad variety of lamellar physical systems with rotational symmetries. Our work establishes the presence of these magnetic objects at room temperature in the multiferroic antiferromagnet BiFeO3, offering new possibilities for their use in spintronics.\nWhen symmetry-breaking phase transitions occur, they induce the formation of topological defects [1], which are isolated regions of lower dimensionality corresponding to a singularity of the order parameter [2]. From topology and symmetry considerations, these defects can be identified and classified in various physical systems, from cosmological to nanometric length scales. In lamellar structures with rotational symmetries, such singular lines appear as dislocations and disclinations which have been extensively studied [3], even before the topological approach to their description was proposed. Illustrating the universality of these patterns [4], similar defects can be found in a broad variety of modulated physical systems including cholesteric liquid crystals [5], ferromagnetic garnets [6] or copolymers [7]. Recently, they were also identified in the helical state of the ferromagnetic B20 material FeGe [8], providing \u2013 besides skyrmions [9] \u2013 additional topological magnetic textures for future use in spintronics.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that these topological defects are present in another type of chiral magnetic material, the multiferroic BiFeO3, which exhibits a lamellar pattern originating from an antiferromagnetic cycloidal order [10] rather than a ferromagnetic helix. We start with a detailed depiction of the magnetic texture of bulk BiFeO3, and we discuss the origin of the generated stray field allowing us to achieve real-space imaging of the antiferromagnetic state with scanning-NV magnetometry. Then, we use this technique to investigate quantitatively the magnetic order and show the coexistence of three magnetic rotational domains within a single ferroelectric domain. At the junctions between these areas where the cycloids propagate along different directions, we observe either a smooth rotation of the wavevector or the formation of topological defects.\nAt room temperature, bulk BiFeO3 is characterized by a slightly distorted rhombohedral structure, which is commonly described by the perovskite-type pseudo-\ncubic unit cell shown in Fig. 1(a) [11, 12]. The Bi3+ ions are displaced with respect to the FeO6 octahedra, giving rise to a large spontaneous ferroelectric polarization P pointing along one of the \u3008111\u3009 directions of the pseudo-cubic cell [13, 14]. Besides this ferroelectric behavior, BiFeO3 is also an antiferromagnet with a Ne\u0301el temperature TN = 643 K. The superexchange interaction mediated by the Fe-O-Fe bond favors a collinear, Gtype antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, the slight shift of the Fe3+ ions away from the center of the FeO6 octahedra induces an additional antisymmetric exchange interaction, often referred to as magnetoelectric interaction, which promotes a non-collinear ordering of the magnetic moments [15]. The competition between the superexchange and the magnetoelectric interactions results in the stabilization of an incommensurate cycloidal rotation of the Fe3+ magnetic moments propagating along a direction k perpendicular to the ferroelectric polarization. In bulk BiFeO3, the period \u03bbb of the cycloidal antiferromagnetic order is around 64 nm [10, 16]. Importantly, for a given polarization direction, the rhombohedral symmetry of BiFeO3 allows three equivalent propagation directions of the cycloid, thus forming three rotational magnetic domains [17]. If P is along the [111] axis, the three propagation vectors k1, k2 and k3 lie in a (111) plane and point along the [1\u2212 10], [0\u2212 11] or [10\u2212 1] directions, as sketched in Fig. 1(a). This non-collinear antiferromagnetic order, which is referred to as type I cycloid [18\u201321], is the one commonly observed in bulk BiFeO3 [10, 16, 17].\nThe rotation angle induced by the magnetoelectric coupling is constant from one Fe site to another along the cycloid propagation direction [15]. Each magnetic moment is thus compensated by its nearest antiparallel neighbors, a fact commonly overlooked in many previous descriptions of the cycloid [16, 22]. On a scale larger than the inter-atomic distance, an antiferromagnetic cycloid resulting solely from the competition between the superexchange and the magnetolectric interactions is therefore ar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n02 24\n3v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n4 F\neb 2\n02 2\nperfectly compensated, and does not produce any static magnetic fields for compensated (001) surfaces. To understand the origin of the stray magnetic field recently measured above BiFeO3 thin films [20, 23, 24], an additional uncompensation is required. It originates from a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction stemming from the antiphase rotation of the oxygen octahedra along the [111] direction [17]. This interaction cants the spins out of the cycloidal plane, leading to an uncompensated magnetic moment mDM with a periodic magnitude locked to that of the antiferromagnetic cycloid, as sketched in Fig. 1(b). The resulting spin density wave (SDW) generates a stray magnetic field whose spatial distribution depends on the cycloid propagation vector. In this work, we employ scanning-NV magnetometry to image this magnetic field distribution in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution.\nTo discriminate between the three possible propagation directions of the cycloid within a single ferroelectric domain, it is convenient to examine their projections on the sample surface. Considering a conventional (001)- oriented BiFeO3 crystal, the k1 propagation vector lies in the surface plane, making an angle of 90\u00b0 with the in-plane component of the polarization [see Fig. 1(c)]. The corresponding SDW produces a stray magnetic field modulated along k1 with a period \u039b1 = \u03bbb \u223c 64 nm. On the other hand, the k2 and k3 propagation vectors are lying out of the surface plane, with an in-plane projection making an angle of 135\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 with the in-plane polarization, respectively [Fig. 1(d,e)]. In both cases, the period of the stray field modulation is equal to the projection of the intrinsic cycloid wavelength on the (001) surface plane, leading to \u039b2 = \u039b3 = \u221a 2\u03bbb \u223c 90 nm. The\nperiod and the orientation of the magnetic field pattern can therefore be used to identify the propagation vector of the cycloid.\nBelow, we investigate the antiferromagnetic order in a millimeter-sized (001)-oriented bulk BiFeO3 crystal grown by the Bi2O3-Fe2O3 flux method [14]. The local ferroelectric properties were first characterized through piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). As shown in Fig. 2(a), the BiFeO3 crystal exhibits a single ferroelectric domain, a feature that is commonly observed for bulk crystals grown by the flux method at temperatures much lower than the ferroelectric Curie temperature (TC \u223c 1100 K) [16]. Combining in-plane and out-of-plane PFM measurements, the direction of the ferroelectric polarization P was unambiguously identified [see black arrow in Fig. 2(a)]. The corresponding antiferromagnetic texture was imaged in real space with a scanning-NV magnetometer operating under ambient conditions. A commercial diamond tip hosting a single NV defect at its apex (Qnami, Quantilever MX) was integrated into an atomic force microscope and scanned in close proximity of the bulk BiFeO3 crystal surface. At each point of the scan, a quantitative magnetic field measurement was obtained by monitoring the Zeeman shift of the NV defect electron spin sublevels through optical detection of the magnetic resonance [26]. The NV-to-sample distance, which sets the spatial resolution of the magnetic microscope, was inferred through an independent calibration procedure [27], leading to dNV = 60\u00b1 1 nm [25].\nThe scanning-NV magnetometer was first operated in dual-iso-B imaging mode to obtain a fast characterization of the magnetic field distribution produced by the SDW bounded to the cycloidal antiferromagnetic order.

The black arrow indicates the projection of the ferroelectric polarization P on the (001) sample surface. (b) Magnetic field image recorded with the scanning-NV magnetometer operated in dual-iso-B imaging mode. The red dashed line indicates the propagation direction of the cycloid along k3. The characteristic period of the modulation is obtained by fitting line profiles with a sinusoidal function, leading to \u039b3 = 92\u00b1 2 nm. (c) Sketch illustrating that the recorded magnetic image is only compatible with a spin cycloid propagating along k3. (d) Right panel: fully quantitative magnetic field distribution. Left panel: line profile taken along the cycloid propagation direction. The red solid line is data fitting (see main text) yielding an uncompensated moment mDM = 0.09\u00b1 0.03 \u00b5B.\nical dual-iso-B image recorded above a single ferroelectric domain of the bulk BiFeO3 crystal is shown in Fig. 2(b). Here the magnetometer signal is modulated along a direction that makes an angle of about 45\u00b0 with the in-plane component of the polarization. This observation indicates an out-of-plane propagation of the cycloid along k3 [Fig. 2(c)], which is further supported by the measured surface period of the modulation \u039b3 = 90\u00b1 2 nm. In this micron-sized area of the sample, we thus observe a single rotational magnetic domain. This experiment constitutes the first real-space observation of the non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in a bulk BiFeO3 crystal.\nTo infer an estimate of the uncompensated magnetic moment mDM linked to the spin cycloid, a fully quantitative magnetic field image was recorded [26]. The resulting map shows a magnetic field modulation with a typical amplitude in the range of 100 \u00b5T [Fig. 2(d)]. A quantitative analysis of this magnetic field distribution was performed by modeling the SDW at a position r in\nthe BiFeO3 crystal as\nmDM(r) = mDM cos(k3 \u00b7 r)(ek3 \u00d7 eP) , (1)\nwhere \u2016k3\u2016 = 2\u03c0/\u03bbb, and {ek3 , eP} are orthogonal unit vectors oriented along the cycloid propagation direction and the polarization [see Fig. 1(b)]. An analytical calculation of the stray field produced by such a spatial distribution of magnetic moments is given in Supplemental Material [25]. The resulting formula was used to fit line profiles across the recorded stray field map with mDM as fitting parameter [Fig. 2(d)]. This analysis leads to mDM = 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5B, a value in good agreement with the one inferred through polarized neutron scattering experiments in bulk BiFeO3 crystals [17]. It corresponds to a periodic wiggling of the cycloidal plane with a maximal canting angle of about 1\u00b0 [Fig. 1(b)]. We note that the uncertainty of the measurement is here mainly due the imperfect knowledge of the flying distance of the scanningNV sensor [22] (see Supplemental Material [25]).\nWith this set of results, it is tempting to conclude that the antiferromagnetic order in our bulk BiFeO3 crystal can be simply described by a single spin cycloid variant, as reported previously using neutron scattering experiments [16]. However, magnetic measurements performed on different regions of the crystal reveal more complex configurations. As an example, Figure 3(a) shows another magnetic field map recorded with the scanningNV magnetometer operated in dual-iso-B imaging mode. Here the three different propagation directions of the antiferromagnetic cycloid can be simultaneously observed in a single ferroelectric domain. Each cycloid variant was identified by considering the orientation of the magnetic field modulation with respect to the in-plane component of the polarization [Fig. 1(c-e)]. In addition, the period of the modulation was inferred for each magnetic domain by fitting line profiles with a cosine function, leading to \u039b1 = 59\u00b1 2 nm, \u039b2 = 82\u00b1 2 nm, and \u039b3 = 94\u00b1 2 nm [Fig. 3(b-d)]. These values are in fair agreement with the expected projections of the cycloid wavevectors on the (001) surface plane. Such a multi-k domain structure is in stark contrast with the magnetic order observed in BiFeO3 thin films, in which a magnetic anisotropy resulting from epitaxial strain lifts the degeneracy between the three possible propagation directions, leading to the stabilization of a single cycloid variant [18, 20].\nEarlier high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments performed on bulk BiFeO3 crystals have also revealed the coexistence of the three cycloid variants, with a predominance of k1 domains [17, 28]. However, we note that for single crystals from the same batch as the ones used in this work, a single cycloidal propagation direction along k1 was detected by neutron diffraction [16]. Thus, the nucleation and growth of a single spin cycloid among the three possible ones seems to be favored in the core of the crystal, and then split into a more complex multi-k domain structure at the crystal surface.

(a) NV magnetometry image recorded in dual-iso-B mode showing the coexistence of the three propagation directions of the antiferromagnetic cycloid (red dashed arrows) in a single ferroelectric domain of the bulk BiFeO3 crystal. (b-d) The left panels show sketches of the three projected propagation directions on the (001) surface with respect to the in-plane component of the polarization P. The right panels show line profiles across the three propagation directions. Solid lines are data fitting with a cosine function and the corresponding periods resulting from the fits are indicated.\nated by the last 30-50 nm of the crystal from its surface. To reconcile bulk and surface observations, we can assume that surface symmetry breaking is associated to a depolarizing electrical field, which might perturb the cycloidal ordering through the magnetoelectric coupling. Indeed a not fully screened polarization would produce an extra (negative) electric field component along [001]. Because the magnetoelectric effect favors cycloids with magnetic moments contained in their (E,k) plane and\npropagation vectors perpendicular to the total electric field, our (001) surface would weaken the k1 cycloidal state compared to k2 and k3 (affected equally). Therefore, a bulk k1 cycloid would be destabilized at the surface and could thus produce the multi-k domain structure observed here. Further theoretical inputs are highly desirable to explore this issue.\nThe magnetic image shown in Figure 3(a) indicates that the transition between the magnetic domains is realized either via a smooth rotation of the cycloidal wavevector or through the formation of complex whirling structures. This is further illustrated by Figure 4(a) showing another magnetic image recorded in a different region of the crystal. Here the propagation direction of the cycloid is continuously rotating such that the boundaries of magnetic domains can hardly be identified. The Fourier transform of this magnetic image features an elliptic shape, which illustrates that the continuous rotation of the cycloid wavevector is correlated with a variation of the surface magnetic modulation period [Fig. 4(b)]. The major axis of the ellipse corresponds to the in-plane propagation direction k1, while the two diffused satellites centered at \u00b145\u00b0 from this axis are associated to k2 and k3. We note that the spots corresponding to k1 are less intense because of the dominance of the out-of-plane variants of the cycloid in the magnetic image of this specific area.\nTo get a larger scale insight on this cycloid propagation rotation, measurements of the wavevector\u2019s norm and orientation with respect to the ferroelectric polarization were realized in different regions of the sample. The results are gathered in the polar diagram shown in Figure 4(c). The plotted ellipse (red solid line) corresponds to the projection on the surface plane of a circle with radius 2\u03c0/\u03bbb in the (111) plane (see Fig. 1(a) and Supplemental Material [25]). Interestingly, all experimental data points fall along this ellipse, with a dispersion reflecting the large spread of cycloid propagation directions. This rotation of the cycloid propagation direction in the (111) plane, which was also noticed in neutron diffraction experiments [10, 17], results from the connection between the different rotational magnetic domains. Complementary measurements were performed in reciprocal space using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS) at the Fe L-edge [29, 30], allowing a large surface scale to be integrated (typically of the order of 100 \u00b5m compared to 1 \u00b5m for scanning-NV magnetometry). This technique, which makes use of soft X-rays in reflectivity geometry, mostly probes the projection of the cycloid period on the surface plane, as the typical absorption length around the Fe L-edge is only a few tens of nm from the surface of the crystal. Therefore, similarly to the scanning-NV measurements, it is only sensitive to the surface magnetic state. As shown in Figure 4(d), we obtain an elliptical diffraction pattern from the REXS experiment, which nicely corroborates the results obtained in real space with scanning-NV microscopy. Furthermore, the ellipse long axis of 62 nm\ncorresponds to the in-plane k1 vector while its short axis of 108 nm aligns in between the k2 and k3 vectors. This enhanced projected period at the short axis may indicate that the continuous rotation of the propagation vectors could step by the [112] crystallographic axis, identified as the type II cycloid. Indeed, recent experiments have shown that such an alternative cycloid, can be stabilized in epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films [18\u201321]. This exotic cycloidal order appears to have a period similar to the type I cycloid and can propagate along three possible directions: k\u20321 \u2016 [211], k\u20322 \u2016 [121] and k\u20323 \u2016 [112], which are all contained in the (111) plane [20]. The continuous rotation of the propagation vector between its three main components in single crystals might then mediated by the exotic cycloidal ordering, as supported by theoretical predictions of multiple propagation vectors in BiFeO3 [31].\nGoing back to the magnetic configuration presented in Fig. 4(a), we now focus on the boundaries between the different rotational domains, where we expect the formation of the topological defects which are typically found in lamellar structures [4]. Fig. 4(e)-(g) display selected\nregions of the larger scale images shown in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a), where singularities can be identified. Although the lack of complete translational invariance in lamellar systems prevents a rigorous topological classification of these defects [2], the naive generalization of this approach allows us to describe such singularities, considering that the order parameter is the cycloid propagation direction. The textures presented in Figs 4(e) and (f) are \u00b1\u03c0-disclinations, as the cycloid wavevector direction covers only half a circle (rotating in opposite senses for the two defects) when we follow a contour enclosing the singularity. The edge dislocation shown in Fig. 4(g) corresponds to a combination of the +\u03c0 and \u2212\u03c0-disclinations. Such edge dislocations have a winding number of 0 or \u00b11/2 depending on the distance between the two disclinations [8, 32]. Albeit all these defects do not have a well-defined or finite integer winding number, meaning that topology does not prevent their annihilation, they are stabilized by the cycloidal lamellar structure resulting from the interplay between the different magnetic interactions in bulk BiFeO3. Our NV magnetometry images of the topological defects are strikingly similar to the MFM\n6 images obtained in the chiral ferromagnet FeGe [8], even if they do not arrange along straight domain walls separating regions where the magnetic spiral propagates along different directions. As discussed previously from the large spread of the data points on the ellipse in Figs. 4(c) and (d), it appears that the cycloid wavevector in bulk BiFeO3 is not stricly locked to the expected crystallographic directions at the vicinity of the crystal surface. This weak anisotropy allows both the smooth transitions between the rotational domains and the formation of isolated defects.\nTo conclude, we have studied the cycloidal antiferromagnetic order at the surface of a bulk BiFeO3 crystal. Combining reciprocal and real-space magnetic imaging techniques, we have shown the coexistence of antiferromagnetic domains in which the cycloid propagates along different wavevectors. In addition, owing to the nanoscale spatial resolution of scanning NV magnetometry, we observed the formation of topological\ndefects typical for lamellar materials at the junctions between these domains. Our work thus demonstrates that these magnetic objects, previously observed in a chiral ferromagnet [8], can be transposed in a multiferroic antiferromagnet, offering new opportunities in terms of robustness and electrical control towards their use in spintronic devices.\nAcknowledgments - We thank support from the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through the project TATOO (ANR-21-CE09-0033-01), the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 964931 (TSAR) and No. 866267 (EXAFONIS), the DARPA TEE program and a public grant overseen by the ANR as part of the \u2018Investissement d\u2019Avenir\u2019 programme (LABEX NanoSaclay, ref.
