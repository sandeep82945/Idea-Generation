    "abstractText": "Job insecurity re\u0082ects the desire and expectation of organizational managers for employees\u2019 exhibition of innovative behavior. Ubiquitous and inevitable, it has gradually become a concern psychological problem for job survival and stability. As a key driver of innovation, employee innovation depends heavily on knowledge workers, who are best able to spot problems and identify and capture opportunities. Based upon the transactional theory of stress and coping (TTSC), this paper discusses the in\u0082uencing mechanism of knowledge workers\u2019 job insecurity and innovative behavior in enterprises, emphatically analyzes the mediating e\u008cects of two coping strategies, i.e., proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior, and veri\u008ees the moderating e\u008cect of organizational climate for innovation. With the data from 665 questionnaires of enterprise knowledge workers, this paper shows that job insecurity can in\u0082uence knowledge workers\u2019 innovative behavior either positively through proactive work behavior or negatively through working withdrawal behavior, thus forming a dual-channel e\u008cect model of in\u0082uencing their innovative behavior, and that organizational climate for innovation has a moderating e\u008cect on the relationship between job insecurity and proactive work behavior/working withdrawal behavior. \u009de organizational innovation climate played a moderating role between job insecurity and proactive work behavior and work withdrawal behavior and detected the value of the boundary where the organizational innovation climate played a mediating role.",

Ubiquitous and inevitable, it has gradually become a concern psychological problem for job survival and stability. As a key driver of innovation, employee innovation depends heavily on knowledge workers, who are best able to spot problems and identify and capture opportunities. Based upon the transactional theory of stress and coping (TTSC), this paper discusses the in uencing mechanism of knowledge workers\u2019 job insecurity and innovative behavior in enterprises, emphatically analyzes the mediating e ects of two coping strategies, i.e., proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior, and veri es the moderating e ect of organizational climate for innovation. With the data from 665 questionnaires of enterprise knowledge workers, this paper shows that job insecurity can in uence knowledge workers\u2019 innovative behavior either positively through proactive work behavior or negatively through working withdrawal behavior, thus forming a dual-channel e ect model of in uencing their innovative behavior, and that organizational climate for innovation has a moderating e ect on the relationship between job insecurity and proactive work behavior/working withdrawal behavior. e organizational innovation climate played a moderating role between job insecurity and proactive work behavior and work withdrawal behavior and detected the value of the boundary where the organizational innovation climate played a mediating role."

Every business and even individuals are faced with \u201cuncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.\u201d With a view to taking the lead in market competition, enterprises have to adopt reform measures and competitive mechanisms such as \u201ccompetition for posts,\u201d \u201clowliest place elimination series,\u201d \u201clayo mechanism,\u201d and \u201c996 work schedule.\u201d Heightened uncertainty in the employment environment leads to the increased employment risks for employees. As employment tensions rise, so does concern among employees about the future loss of work itself or important features, making more and more employees feel insecure at work, and then have a sense of insecurity about the viability of the job [1].\nMeanwhile, the outbreak of COVID-19 has swept over 200 countries and regions, a ecting more than 7 billion people. e world has faced a grave crisis and severe test, which has once again increased the uncertainty in the working environment of enterprises and aggravated the job insecurity of employees. Job insecurity has gradually become one of the important stressors in today\u2019s work [2] and a common psychological problem in the workplace.\nTechnological changes, market changes, and the on-ando pandemic have exposed the enterprises to many uncertainties and problems. Enterprises have also realized that only by developing innovative products or services and constantly maintaining innovative vitality can they survive in the complex market competition [3]. Innovation is mainly driven by employees in an enterprise [4], where knowledge workers are best able to nd problems and identify and capture opportunities [5]. erefore, having a group of\nHindawi Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society Volume 2022, Article ID 1519717, 11 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1519717\nproactive and innovative workers has become the key to improve the innovation capability of enterprises. So far, the research on individual innovation has basically focused on effective interaction [6, 7], positive atmosphere [8], proactive leadership [9, 10] and other supportive and stable factors. However, little attention is paid to negative factors that are not conducive to innovation [11]. Research suggests that it is of equal importance to identify and eliminate negative factors in the workplace that discourage innovation [12]. Studies have found that job insecurity will have a negative impact on employees\u2019 job satisfaction [13], physical and mental health [14], risk tolerance [15], and civic behavior [16], among others. Meanwhile, some scholars analyze that job insecurity has a certain negative impact on innovative behavior [17]. Job insecurity is understood as a hindrance situation, and it is proposed to eliminate employees\u2019 perceived insecurity at work [18]. Other studies, however, have not found such relationship [19]. *is also implies that the relationship between job insecurity and employee innovative behavior is uncertain. Existing studies on the impact of job insecurity on employee innovative behavior are to be improved. *ere is still no consensus on the relationship between the two and ways to influence the latter [20, 21]. More theories are required to explore and explain the relationship between them from more perspectives [22].\nTo sum up, this paper contributes to the following two: first, based on the TTSC, proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior are introduced as positive and negative coping styles, respectively, in an effort to explain the dual-channel effect of job insecurity on knowledge workers\u2019 innovative behaviors. Second, this paper argues that the high or low organizational climate for innovation affects the coping styles of knowledge workers in case of perceived job insecurity and thus constructs a two-path moderated mediation model. With this model, the influencing mechanism and boundary conditions of job insecurity on knowledge workers\u2019 innovative behaviors are analyzed systematically to help business managers better understand the effects of job insecurity requirements and take advantage of job insecurity to enhance the innovative behavior of enterprises."

It expounds the subjective process and important role of cognitive appraisal and coping response [23] and is often applied to study the individual differences in response to stress [24]. *ere is no difference between positive and negative. *e difference between challenge and hindrance stress is the product of subjective cognitive appraisal. Different cognitive appraisals prompt individuals to adopt different coping styles and strategies [25]. In an environment of uncertainty, employees tend to adopt the negative coping style when they have appraised the current situation as damage or threat; when the situation is appraised as a challenge, employees are more willing to adopt the positive coping style [25]. It is essentially a process in which individuals\nadjust to the management objectives set by the organization. Different coping strategies are bound to produce different behavioral outcomes, so it is an important strategy to cope with stress [26]. In conclusion, when the employees feel insecure in the workplace, the cognitive appraisal of stress will influence the employees to adopt different coping strategies and thus have different effects on innovative behavior."

            "text": "e Mediating Effect of Proactive Work Behavior. *e stress of job insecurity is a peculiar phenomenon in business [27]. Job insecurity is pervasive and inevitable [28]. Research shows that organizational environment is an important situational factor to stimulate the proactive work behavior [29]. People tend to be slack in a comfortable environment, while job insecurity from the outside can moderate such slack, and thus the stress from job insecurity is not always negative. According to the TTSC, the duality of stress implies that challenge stressors will stimulate individuals to take positive coping strategies while hindrance stressors are consuming internal resources [25]. Job insecurity may also be a positive stimulus, which plays a positive role in stimulating and maintaining employees\u2019 enthusiasm and effort [30]. Meantime, individuals are more willing to adopt the positive coping style, put in more efforts, and perform better when they believe the availability of greater external benefits in dealing with job insecurity [31], thereby facilitating more proactive behaviors.\nProactive work behavior is a behavior committed to improving the internal working environment of an organization, characterized by spontaneity, foresight, and change [32]. Proactive work behavior is generally positive for the organization [7]. In addition, by exhibiting proactive work behavior, employees can usually have access to more opportunities for career advancement [33]. Parker [34] has proposed that proactive work behavior is committed to changing and improving the working environment within an organization, such as improving workflow [35], offering constructive suggestions [36], putting forward new ideas, and actively implementing them [37]. *erefore, proactive work behavior is a positive work behavior, which is beneficial to improve employees\u2019 work performance and promote their innovative behavior.\nTo sum up, based on the TTSC, this paper holds that employees will make a positive appraisal of themselves when they identify job insecurity as a challenge stressor. *is appraisal will motivate employees to engage in more proactive work behaviors, thus improving their innovative behavior. Based on the above analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed.\nHypothesis 1. (H1+): job insecurity positively influences proactive work behavior.\nHypothesis 2. (H3+): proactive work behavior positively influences employee innovative behavior.\nHypothesis 3. (H5+): proactive work behavior has a mediating effect on the relationship between job insecurity and employees\u2019 innovative behavior."

            "text": "e Mediating Effect of Working Withdrawal Behavior. While perceiving a threat to the ongoing safety of job, employees will rely more on routine solutions and reduce the sharing of knowledge and other resources in order to avoid risks and failures and achieve the purpose of selfprotection, thus producing working withdrawal behavior to some extent [38]. In this situation, employees will have greater psychological stress in the face of work pressure [39]. For example, the threat of losing one\u2019s job can trigger frustration, anger, and pain, inducing emotional exhaustion [40]. In the context of stress response, working withdrawal behavior is the counterproductive work behavior of employees to instinctively protect themselves and deliberately avoid group or specific situational tasks [41]. *e working withdrawal behavior is manifested by being late, leaving early, absenteeism, gossiping during working hours, and turnover intention [42]. Withdrawal can help individuals avoid further pain as a way of distancing themselves from harm [43].\nWhile exhibiting working withdrawal behavior, employees are less committed to their jobs (such as resources and energy), so that it is difficult for them to perfect work tasks, thus reducing the innovative behavior [44]. In addition, job insecurity often causes employees to violate and resist organizational management, thus undermining the employee innovative behavior [45].Wei and Si [46] note that news of layoffs trigger emotional exhaustion among employees, which in turn weakens the employee innovative behavior. Job insecurity is the factor to trigger working withdrawal behavior [46]. Working withdrawal behavior will have a negative impact on employees\u2019 innovation [47].\nIn conclusion, based on the TTSC, this paper finds that when employees identify job insecurity as a hindrance stressor, such negative cognitive appraisal will prime their motivation to protect themselves, so that employees may avoid the threat by holding back, ultimately not conducive to the innovative behavior. Based on the above analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed:\nHypothesis 4. (H2+): job insecurity positively influences working withdrawal behavior.\nHypothesis 5. (H4-): working withdrawal behavior negatively influences employee innovative behavior.\nHypothesis 6. (H6+): working withdrawal behavior has a mediating effect on the relationship between job insecurity and employee innovative behavior.\n2.3. Moderating Effect of Organizational Climate for Innovation. An important factor for an organization to achieve innovation is to encourage and support innovation [48]. From a subjective perspective, this paper interprets\norganizational climate for innovation as employees\u2019 perception of recognition, support, and encouragement of innovation in the working environment [49], including colleague relations, leadership support, resource support, and organizational support. O\u2019Driscoll and Randall [50] believe that organizational support perceivers are more likely to care about and contribute to the development of the organization. Having highly perceived the organizational climate for innovation, employees tend tomeet organizational expectations through proactive behaviors [51]. In this case, perception tends to be more of a challenge for employees, which clarifies their direction of efforts. Otherwise, employeesmay think that the organization is demanding and be more likely to think of the perception as a hindrance and respond to the organization through working withdrawal behavior. Besides, organizations with a strong climate for innovation will attach great importance to learning and provide necessary material resources for employees [52]. Organizations with a strong climate for innovation will offer employees a relaxed and positive working environment and give them psychological resources to minimize their psychological cost and risk perception [48]. At the same time, the efficiency of the team\u2019s knowledge sharing can be improved [53]. Employees tend to have positive feelings when they perceive the work environment as positive and believe that stress on the job enhances potential earnings and will be more motivated to work [54]. *is positive perception will raise employees\u2019 willingness to work proactively, and they will prefer positive actions to gain more resources and get rid of job threats. In the meantime, employees with job insecurity will also be threatened with the loss of resources. Sufficient resources allow employees to deal with job insecurity proactively [55] and serve as a prerequisite for proactive work behavior. With sufficient resources, employees can take the initiative to improve their competitiveness and meet the organization\u2019s expectations, thus improving employment relations and gaining continuing benefits from employment.\nWhile perceiving a high organizational climate for innovation, employees are more willing to work hard to turn stress into motivation, overcome difficulties and challenges at work through proactive behaviors, and achieve changes. Similarly, while perceiving a low organizational climate for innovation, employees are reluctant to engage in proactive work behavior and often adopt working withdrawal behavior to cope with job insecurity. In conclusion, this paper suggests that the higher perceived level of organizational climate for innovation has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between job insecurity and proactive work behavior, and the lower perceived level of organizational climate for innovation negatively moderates the relationship between job insecurity and working withdrawal behavior. Further, it puts forward the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 7. (H7a): organizational climate for innovation positively moderates the impact of job insecurity on proactive work behavior, i.e., the higher the perceived level of organizational climate for innovation, the stronger the impact of job insecurity on proactive work behavior.\nHypothesis 8. (H7b): organizational climate for innovation negatively moderates the impact of job insecurity on working withdrawal behavior, i.e., the higher the perceived level of organizational climate for innovation, the weaker the impact of job insecurity on working withdrawal behavior.\n*e theoretical model is shown in Figure 1."

CMB test is designed to ensure the scientific nature of research and avoid the influence of single sample source on the increase or decrease of interdimensional correlation. Based on the suggestions of Podsakoff et al. [60] and the experience of Anmin and Lei [61], Harman\u2019s single-factor test was employed to make factor analysis on all the 45 items. *e unrotated principal component factor analysis was used to extract 10 principal component factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. *e cumulative explanatory explained variance was 84.395%, and the explained variance of factor 1 was 25.698%, less than the standard 50%. *erefore, there\u2019s no serious common method variance in the data in this paper, and the findings are reliable.\n4.2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis. First, CFA was used in this paper to test the discriminant validity of variables, with the results as shown in Table 2. Compared with alternative 4- factor, 3-factor, 2-factor, and single-factor models, the fitting indexes (\u03c72 \ufffd 327.211, CFI\ufffd 0.965, TLI\ufffd 0.958, RMSEA\ufffd 0.059, SRMR\ufffd 0.071) of the 5-factor model (job insecurity, proactive work behavior, working withdrawal behavior, organizational climate for innovation, and employee innovative behavior) were better than those of other models. Arguably, the 5-factor model in this paper features good structural validity among variables. Second, as advised by Fornell and Larcker [62], when the square root of dimension AVE is greater than the correlation coefficient\nbetween AVE and other dimensions, the discriminant validity is available among dimensions. In this paper, the square root of each dimension AVE is greater than the correlation coefficients between other dimensions, so there is good discriminant validity among the dimensions (Table 3).\n4.3. Description and Analysis. *e mean, standard deviation (SD), and correlation coefficient of each variable are shown in Table 3. Job insecurity had significant positive correlation with proactive work behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.480, p< 0.01), and with working withdrawal behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.173, p< 0.01), which primarily tested Hypotheses 1 and 2. *ere was a significant positive correlation between proactive work behavior and employee innovative behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.387, p< 0.01) and a significant negative correlation between working withdrawal behavior and employee innovative behavior (\u03b2\ufffd \u22120.105, p< 0.01), which primarily tested Hypotheses 3 and 4. organizational climate for innovation had significant positive correlation with proactive work behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.366, p< 0.01) and significant negative correlation with working withdrawal behavior (\u03b2\ufffd \u22120.097, p< 0.05), which provided preliminary support for hypothesis testing.\n4.4. Hypothesis Testing. *is paper uses regression analysis to test the hypothesis. As shown in Table 4, after controlling the demographic variables such as gender and age, job insecurity has a significant positive effect on proactive work behavior in Model 2 (\u03b2\ufffd 0.475, p< 0.01), so Hypothesis 1 is supported. In Model 4, job insecurity has a significant positive effect on working withdrawal behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.195, p< 0.01), so Hypothesis 2 is supported. In Model 8, working withdrawal behavior has a significant negative effect on employee innovative behavior (\u03b2\ufffd \u22120.139, p< 0.01), and proactive work behavior has a significant positive effect on employee innovative behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.191, p< 0.01), so\nHypotheses 3 and 4 are supported. Compared with Model 7, it can be found in Model 8 that the regression coefficient of job insecurity has changed from 0.333 to 0.27 (p< 0.01), indicating that proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior have partial mediating effects on the relationship between job insecurity and employee innovative behavior; thus, Hypotheses 5 and 6 are tenable. In Model 3, the interaction term of organizational climate for innovation and job insecurity has a significant positive effect on proactive work behavior (\u03b2\ufffd 0.118, p< 0.01), indicating that the higher the perceived organizational climate for innovation, the stronger the positive effect of job insecurity on proactive work behavior. *erefore, Hypothesis 7 is supported. In\nModel 6, the interaction term of organizational climate for innovation and job insecurity has a significant negative effect on working withdrawal behavior (\u03b2\ufffd \u22120.155, p< 0.01), indicating that the higher the perceived organizational climate for innovation, the weaker the positive effect of job insecurity on working withdrawal behavior. *erefore, Hypothesis 8 is supported.\nBy following the suggestions of Hayes [63], the process plug-in in SPSS was adopted to further clarify the mediating effect of proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior. *e results are as shown in Table 5. Bootstrap method was used for 5,000 repeated samples with 95% CI. *e lower limit, upper limit, and two-tailed significance tests\nof the total effect, direct effect, and indirect effect were estimated. *e results show that job insecurity has a significant indirect effect on employee innovative behavior through proactive work behavior (indirect effect\ufffd 0.173, 95% CI\ufffd [0.099, 0.247]), excluding 0; job insecurity has a significant indirect effect on employee innovative behavior through working withdrawal behavior (indirect effect\ufffd \u22120.115, 95% CI\ufffd [\u22120.184, \u22120.045]), excluding 0. *us, Hypotheses 5 and 6 are tested again.\nTo test the moderating effect, the data should be first centralized. Hayes [64] verified that the correlation between interaction terms and independent and moderating\nvariables could be reduced after data centralization, thus improving the validity of model estimation. In this paper, process plug-in was used for 5,000 repeated samples with 95% CI to test the moderated mediating effect of organizational climate for innovation. Seen from Table 6, in the influence of the interaction term of job insecurity and organizational climate for innovation on proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior, the confidence interval does not contain 0, indicating that proactive job behavior and working withdrawal behavior are influenced by the moderating variable (organizational climate for innovation) in the relationship between job insecurity and\nTable 5: Analysis on the mediating effect of proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior (N\ufffd 665).\nTypes Paths \u03b2 SE p Bootstrap (95% CI) LLCI ULCI Direct effect JiB ->EIB 0.263 0.039 0.000 0.187 0.339 Indirect effect JiB ->WWB->EIB \u22120.115 0.036 0.001 \u22120.184 \u22120.045JiB ->PWB ->EIB 0.173 0.038 0.000 0.099 0.247\nTable 6: Test results of moderating effect (N\ufffd 665).\nY Interaction item R2-change p value LLCI ULCI PWB JiB\u2217OCI 0.019 0 0.064 0.181 WWB JiB\u2217OCI 0.035 0 \u22120.22 \u22120.096 Note.

Hypotheses 5 and 6 are tested.\nWith a view to further quantifying the moderating effect, Spiller and Fitzsimons [65] have proposed to use JonsonNeyman technique to test the moderating interval, so as to determine the moderating level of the moderator variable to the independent and dependent variables. It can be seen from Figure 2 that when the standardized value of knowledge workers to organizational climate for innovation is greater than \u22122.0407, the moderating effect is significantly positive, but no moderating effect when the value is less than \u22122.0407. Hence, the higher the knowledge workers\u2019 perception of organizational climate for innovation, the stronger the effect on proactive work behavior. Similarly, it can be seen from Figure 3 that when the standardized value of knowledge workers to organizational climate for innovation is less than 0.7315, the moderating effect is significantly negative, but no moderating effect when the value is greater than 0.7315. *erefore, the lower the knowledge workers\u2019 perception of organizational climate for innovation, the stronger the effect on working withdrawal behavior, that is, the higher the perception of organizational climate for innovation, the weaker the effect on working withdrawal behavior. Hypotheses 7 and 8 are thus tested."

From the perspective of integration, this paper reveals the internal mechanism of job insecurity and knowledge workers\u2019 innovative behavior, i.e., the dual-path mediating effect of proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior. Path 1 shows that job insecurity positively influences employees\u2019 proactive work behavior and thus improving their innovative behavior, which verifies that job insecurity positively influences the employee innovative behavior [33, 34]. Path 2 shows that job insecurity triggers employees\u2019 work withdrawal behavior, thus inhibiting their innovative behavior. which supports the study of employees\u2019 negative coping style in the face of job stress [18, 66]. *is paper proposes a dual-path effect of job insecurity on employees\u2019 innovative behavior from an integrated perspective, explaining why job insecurity enhances or inhibits employees\u2019 innovative behavior and providing a new explanation mechanism for the previous two viewpoints. It helps scholars and business management practitioners to understand the function of job insecurity from a balanced and dialectical perspective.\n(2) *is paper clarifies the moderating mechanism of organizational innovation climate in the relationship\nbetween job insecurity and employee innovative behavior. *e results show that high organizational innovation climate enhances the positive relationship between job insecurity and proactive work behavior and stimulates more proactive work behaviors; a high organizational innovation climate enhances the negative relationship between job insecurity and working withdrawal behavior and reduces employees\u2019 working withdrawal behavior. *e above results verify that the perception of organizational innovation climate as a boundary condition can effectively explain the dual-path effect of job insecurity and answer the question of when job insecurity in companies requires stimulating proactive work behaviors and enhancing employees\u2019 innovative behaviors and when it triggers job withdrawal behaviors and reduces employees\u2019 innovative behaviors. *e results of the study illustrate the important value of organizational innovation climate. *e organization should show care and positive feedback to employees, in an effort to improve their perception of organizational innovation climate.\n5.2. Future Research. Job insecurity is objective, from an individual perspective only; the empirical study in this paper shows that job insecurity has, as a stressor, influenced the employee innovative behavior through the dual path of proactive work behavior and working withdrawal behavior. We are expected to focus on how job insecurity influences employees physiologically and physically, and how job insecurity is distinguished as challenge and hindrance stressors. *en, the cross-sectional data in the questionnaire survey has certain limitations in analyzing the relationship between job insecurity and employee innovative behavior, whose correlation can be proved, while the analysis of causality has to be further verified by supplementing time series data.\nWith the TTSC, this paper reveals the effects of job insecurity, the difference of which lies in different behavioral strategies based upon employees\u2019 cognitive appraisal. In addition, the impact of job insecurity on individuals is subject to a number of conditions [67]. *e future research can focus further on the factors that cause differential effects of job insecurity from multiple perspectives (such as age), so as to help business managers and researchers better understand the effects of job insecurity requirements, take advantage of job insecurity, and make it the driving force to enhance enterprise innovative behavior."
