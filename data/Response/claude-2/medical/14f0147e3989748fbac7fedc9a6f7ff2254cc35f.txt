 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a prospective study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up to confirm the findings that vitamin B6 supplementation may not be necessary for patients on long-term D-penicillamine treatment. 

2. Investigate the optimal dose and duration of vitamin B6 supplementation needed for patients starting D-penicillamine treatment. This could help determine if supplementation is only needed temporarily.

3. Explore the effects of D-penicillamine on other B vitamins like B12, folate, etc. This could reveal if supplementation of other B vitamins is warranted.

4. Evaluate if certain patient subgroups like those with nutritional deficits or undergoing growth spurts may benefit more from vitamin B6 supplementation while on D-penicillamine.

5. Conduct electrophysiology studies in patients on long-term D-penicillamine with and without vitamin B6 supplementation to detect any subclinical neurological manifestations of toxicity or deficiency.
