    "abstractText": "Magnetic properties of more than twenty Cantor alloy samples of varying composition were investigated over a temperature range of 5 K to 300 K and in fields of up to 70 kOe using magnetometry and muon spin relaxation. Two transitions are identified: a spinglass-like transition that appears between 55 K and 190 K depending on composition, and a ferrimagnetic transition that occurs at approximately 43 K in multiple samples with widely varying compositions. The magnetic signatures at 43 K are remarkably insensitive to chemical composition. A modified Curie-Weiss model was used to fit the susceptibility data and to extract the net effective magnetic moment for each sample. The resulting values for the net effective moment were either diminished with increasing Cr or Mn concentrations or enhanced with decreasing Fe, Co, or Ni concentrations. Beyond a sufficiently large effective moment, the magnetic ground state transitions from ferrimagnetism to ferromagnetism. The effective magnetic moments, together with the corresponding compositions, are used in a global linear regression analysis to extract element-specific effective magnetic moments, which are compared to the values obtained by ab-initio based density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These moments provide the information necessary to controllably tune the magnetic properties of Cantor alloy variants.",

Two transitions are identified: a spinglass-like transition that appears between 55 K and 190 K depending on composition, and a ferrimagnetic transition that occurs at approximately 43 K in multiple samples with widely varying compositions. The magnetic signatures at 43 K are remarkably insensitive to chemical composition. A modified Curie-Weiss model was used to fit the susceptibility data and to extract the net effective magnetic moment for each sample. The resulting values for the net effective moment were either diminished with increasing Cr or Mn concentrations or enhanced with decreasing Fe, Co, or Ni concentrations. Beyond a sufficiently large effective moment, the magnetic ground state transitions from ferrimagnetism to ferromagnetism. The effective magnetic moments, together with the corresponding compositions, are used in a global linear regression analysis to extract element-specific effective magnetic moments, which are compared to the values obtained by ab-initio based density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These moments provide the information necessary to controllably tune the magnetic properties of Cantor alloy variants.\nKeywords: Cantor alloy, high entropy alloy, magnetism"

            "text": "Work on high-entropy alloys began in the early 2000s with Cantor, Kim and Warren [1]. However, the name \u201cCantor alloy\u201d did not come about until a 2004 study by Yeh et al. [2] coined the term. Since that time, high-entropy alloys have garnered increasing attention for opening a massive number of yetunexplored alloy systems for investigation. Already, studies have found a number of high-entropy alloys with interesting and potentially useful properties such as high hardness and resistance to anneal softening [2], shape memory effects [3, 4], and superconductivity [5].\nMuch work has been done regarding the mechanical properties of Cantor alloys [6\u201311], as well as the magnetic properties of similar compounds [12\u201323], and previous studies on the equiatomic Cantor alloy specifically have revealed the presence of two magnetic transitions. The higher temperature transition occurs at approximately 85 K, and has been identified as spinglass-like through \u00b5SR studies [24]. At approximately 43 K, the material transitions again, this time into a ferrimagnetic state, as determined by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experimental analysis of the magnetic entropy [24]. Despite the small size of the ferrimagnetic transition, prior work has suggested that it is not due to an impurity phase [24]. Other studies have observed notable differences in the size and temperature\nEmail address: jhamlin@ufl.edu (James J. Hamlin)\nof these transitions, likely due to the significant processing dependence of the Cantor alloy [25\u201327]. Not only are the magnetic properties of the alloy highly sensitive to annealing and cold-working [28\u201330], high-temperature anneals do not eliminate the effects of cold-working. Analysis which combined modified Curie-Weiss fitting, specific heat measurements, DFT calculations and Hall measurements has also revealed a large Stoner enhancement factor [24].\nAdditionally, few papers have reported the magnetic properties of four-element combinations of the Cantor alloy, but the nature of the magnetic states has not been universally established. For example, Kao et al. [14] and Lucas et al. [15] both investigated CrFeCoNi, but Lucas et al. state that the compound is paramagnetic at low temperature, while Kao et al. claim that it is ferromagnetic. In this work, a number of four-element compounds were synthesized and measured alongside numerous five-element compounds with varying compositions in order to resolve these issues.\nOur measurements of magnetic susceptibility on more than twenty Cantor alloy samples with varying compositions reveal that increasing the relative amount of ferromagnetic elements, such as Fe, enhances the overall magnetization, while larger quantities of antiferromagnetic elements decrease the magnetization. This observation is consistent with previous Cantor alloy investigations, which reported Fe, Co, and Ni tend to align ferromagnetically while Cr and Mn are typically antiferromagnetic [23, 24, 26]. Herein, these trends are quantified\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier August 23, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n09 53\n7v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n1 9\nA ug\n2 02\nby least squares analysis performed using effective moments of each of the measured samples, revealing that element-specific magnetic moments can be estimated for samples that are close to the equiatomic composition. However, the magnetic properties change when the effective moment becomes sufficiently large due to a lack of antiferromagnetic elements or a relative abundance of ferromagnetic ones. At this point, the compound becomes ferromagnetic, rather than ferrimagnetic at low temperature as evidenced by muon spin-relaxation studies on select samples in the Mn series. Our experimental results, combined with ab-initio based density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide a complete picture of the compositional dependence of the magnetic properties of the Cantor alloy system. The work highlights the great promise of similar regression analysis methods applied to several chemically substituted alloy samples to provide insights into elemental specific contributions to properties in other high-entropy materials."

Following synthesis, samples were sealed in quartz tubes in Ar atmosphere and annealed at 1100 \u00b0C for six days, then quenched in water before measurement. However, the samples consisting of 25% of one element and 18.75% of each other element (25% samples) were annealed first for six days at 1080 \u00b0C and then again at 1100 \u00b0C, quenching in water following each anneal."

This practice permits a simplified notation, listing only the element with an adjusted quantity and the percentage of that element present in the alloy. From that information alone, the relative proportion of other elements can then be inferred. For example, \u201cCr22\u201d is used instead of writing \u201cCr22(MnFeCoNi)78\u201d, and a sample with composition CrFeCoNi is represented by the abbreviation \u201cMn0.\u201d This convention is used from this point onward in this work.\nSamples with an equal proportion of each element (equiatomic) are listed as \u201cEqui.\u201d"

Each sample was secured in a gel capsule inside a plastic straw for measurement.\nMuon spin spectroscopy measurements (\u00b5SR) were conducted at TRIUMF Laboratory in Vancouver, Canada using the LAMPF spectrometer on the M20D beamline. The \u00b5SR technique utilizes the asymmetric decay of initially spin-polarized positive muons into positrons to probe the magnetic properties of the sample [31]. Specifically, \u00b5SR is uniquely sensitive to the volume fraction of different magnetic and nonmagnetic phases, which is important for potentially inhomogeneous systems such as magnetic alloys. The experimentally measured quantity is the time-dependent asymmetry, a(t), which is determined from the difference in positron events between two detectors placed on opposite sides of the sample. The asymmetry is proportional to the component of the net muon spin polarization along the axis connecting the two detectors. Information about the local magnetic field distribution can be inferred from the behavior of a(t) as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Additional details about our experimental configuration are described elsewhere [24], and the open source program BEAMS [32] was used for data analysis."

Electronic wavefunctions were thus modeled using planewaves while the interaction between the frozen core states and\nvalence states was handled according to the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism [36, 37]. Exchange and correlation was treated according to the generalized gradient approximation as parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [38].\nThe modeled Cantor compositions were selected according to the same convention used in the experimental analysis, such that only one element was varied at time, according to Ax[BCDE]100\u2212x, resulting in five separate series of simulations (i.e., one for each species). Within each series, four compositions were modeled (i.e., x = 10, 20, 30, 40). The alloys were modeled using supercells containing 108 atoms, constructed as 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cubic multiplications of the conventional 4 atom FCC unit cell.

Thus, any reported properties represent the average of the three random solution supercells at each composition.\nFor all calculations, a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 gamma-centered k-point mesh, along with a plane-wave energy cutoff of 400 eV and a Gaussian smearing smearing width of 0.01 eV was found to sufficiently minimize fluctuations in the total energy and magnetic moments. The minimization threshold of the total energy with respect to the electronic convergence was set to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV, while ionic convergence threshold was met when forces on all atoms fell below 20 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV \u00c5\u22121."

            "text": "In Fig. 1, results of susceptibility versus temperature measurements are presented on the left side, while magnetization versus field results are shown on the right. Each row displays a collection of samples, grouped according to the elemental concentration being adjusted. Due to their strong magnetic response, most of the x = 0 samples are not included in this figure, with Fe0 as an exception, so the composition dependence of the trends and features of the x > 0 data can be more easily compared. The Cr0 and Mn0 data sets are plotted in Fig. 2.\nThree striking features are identified in the plots shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, a spin-glass-like transition (T2), marked by a peak [24, 26], occurs at high temperatures, which varies widely depending on composition. This feature is most apparent in the Fe30 dataset at about 67 K, Fig. 1E. Secondly, a step-like feature (T1) appears in many datasets, marking a ferrimagnetic transition [24], as clearly present in the Mn25 susceptibility data, Fig. 1C. In all samples in which it appears, the T1 feature occurs at 43(1) K, and although this robustness might be considered as a fingerprint of an impurity phase, prior work has established this transition to be intrinsic to the Cantor alloy [24]. Lastly, another feature (T \u2217) occurs in several samples at approximately 18 K and is most obvious in the Mn25 data, Fig. 1C. The nature\nof the T \u2217 feature is unclear, but may be the result of differences in processing. The x = 25 samples were annealed and quenched twice, once at 1080 K and then at 1100 K, whereas other samples in which T \u2217 appears were annealed and subsequently quenched in the same quartz tube along with several more pieces (up to as many as five), which may have resulted in a slower quench.\nThe magnetization versus field data along the right side of Fig. 1 shows that even at fields of up to 70 kOe, magnetization remains a small fraction of a Bohr magneton. For example, the Fe25 sample reaches approximately 0.03 \u00b5B atom\u22121, much smaller than the Hund\u2019s-rule-predicted effective moments for the constituent elements, which is typically a few \u00b5B atom\u22121 [39]. Thus, near-equiatomic compositions of the Cantor alloy are far from magnetic saturation saturation even at 70 kOe. Even in Mn10, which extends beyond the limits of the y-axis (Fig. 1D), the magnetization reaches only 0.08 \u00b5B atom\u22121 at 70 kOe. One trend visible in Fig. 1 is that hysteresis increases as susceptibility increases, perhaps indicating the presence of ferromagnetic regions within the material.\nThe plots of Fig. 1 also reveal that susceptibility increases with greater proportions of ferromagnetic elements Fe, Co, or Ni. On the other hand, increasing the relative amount of antiferromagnetic elements Cr or Mn decreases the susceptibility. At sufficiently low concentrations of Cr or Mn, the magnetic properties change significantly, resulting in larger saturation magnetization and susceptibility. Consequently, Cr0 and Mn0 data are excluded from Fig. 1 and are instead presented in Fig. 2. The Cr0 sample reaches susceptibility values of approximately 9.1 emu mol\u22121atom Oe\n\u22121, much larger than the susceptibility maximum of, for example, Mn25 of about 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 emu mol\u22121atom Oe\n\u22121. Although the susceptibility and saturation magnetization of the Cr0 and Mn0 samples are orders of magnitude larger than those shown in Fig. 1, they are still lower than effective moments predicted by Hund\u2019s rule [39]. These Cr0 and Mn0 samples also possess a single ferromagnetic transition, compared to the ferrimagnetic and spin-glass-like transition of the near-equiatomic samples.\nTransition temperatures for each measured sample are summarized in Table 1. The positions of the lower temperature (\u201cstep-like\u201d) transitions were determined by local minima of the first derivative, while the critical temperature of the higher temperature transitions are located at the peak in the magnetic susceptibility. In several of the iron samples, the ferrimagnetic transition is either absent are too small to detect, and the spinglass/antiferromagnetic transition is not visible in the ferromagnetic (Cr0 and Mn0) or nearly ferromagnetic (Mn10) samples."

            "text": "\u00b5SR measurements of Mn0 and Mn30 alloys were conducted to evaluate the magnetic homogeneity and confirm the magnetization results. Representative a(t) asymmetry spectra collected in zero applied magnetic field (ZF) are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) for Mn0 and Mn30, respectively. For both samples, the gentle relaxation of the asymmetry at high temperature becomes more rapid as the temperature is lowered toward the transition due to critical slowing down of spin fluctuations. Be-\ntween 77 \u2212 80 K for Mn0 and 175 \u2212 185 K for Mn30, the initial asymmetry value at t = 0 drops to approximately 1/3 of its high-temperature value, signifying the onset of static magnetism [31]. These temperatures agree well with T1 = 75 K for Mn0 and T2 = 190 K for Mn30 given in Table 1. The narrow temperature range in which the initial asymmetry drops demonstrates that the magnetic transition is sharp and uniform throughout the entire volume of the sample, confirming that the non-stoichiometric alloys are similarly magnetically homogeneous as the equiatomic alloy [24]. The uniform magnetic behavior of each sample is further illustrated in Fig. 3(c), where the initial asymmetry plotted as a function of temperature shows an abrupt step at the transition. The initial asymmetry was determined by fitting the generalized exponential function a(t) = a0 exp(\u2212\u03bbt)\u03b2 to the spectra, as was done previously [24]. It is noteworthy that a characteristic Kubo-Toyabe relaxation pattern [40] is observed for Mn0 within the first \u223c100 ns of the spectra below the transition, but is not visible on the time scale used in Fig. 3(a), in contrast to Mn30 and the equiatomic al-\nloy [24], indicative of subtle composition-dependent changes of the internal magnetic field distribution at the muon stopping sites.\nFinally, Fig. 3(d) displays the temperature-dependent relaxation rate \u03bbLF of the long-time asymmetry for data collected in an applied longitudinal field (LF) of 1 kOe (not shown), which is a sensitive probe of spin dynamics. The values of \u03bbLF were determined from generalized exponential fits to the LF asymmetry spectra. Mn0 shows a low, broad peak in \u03bbLF centered around 90 K (slightly above the transition temperature in ZF), while Mn30 shows a much higher and sharper peak centered around 180 K. These results point to differences in the spin dynamics of the two samples, with critical behavior being suppressed in Mn0 and preserved in Mn30. A more detailed theoretical investigation of the microscopic magnetic behavior of Cantor alloys with various Mn-compositions could help explain these differences in the ZF and LF data of the Mn0 and Mn30 samples."

One can obtain an effective moment peff from this fitting using [46]\npeff = 2.82 C1/2m . (2)\nIn the Cantor alloy, Stoner-enhanced Pauli paramagnetism dominates the \u03c7o term, and diamagnetic contributions were predicted to be, at most, 5% of the size of the enhanced Pauli paramagnetism [24]. Van Vleck paramagnetism is present in compounds with a total angular momentum J = 0 ground state. In the Cantor alloy, this state may occur in Cr2+ and Mn3+, though further work is required to determine whether this mechanism plays a significant role.\nFitting Eq. 1 to the field-cooled susceptibility data produces best fit values of \u03c70, peff , and \u03b8 for 23 different samples. In each case, the data were fit from 300 K down to temperatures just above the highest temperature magnetic ordering transition. The parameters derived from fitting each measured sample are summarized in Table 1. Figure S1 (supplementary material) compares the susceptibility with the fit to Eq. 1 for each sample, demonstrating excellent agreement in almost all cases. Fit parameters are not reported for the two samples that appear to have transitioned to a distinct ferromagnetic ground state, Mn0 and Cr0. For these two samples the fit was unreliable, producing values that were unphysical or depended significantly on the temperature range of the fit.\nSeveral conclusions are immediately apparent on review of Table 1. While the values of the Curie-Weiss temperature, \u03b8, remain close to zero, systematic trends are absent. The temperature independent susceptibility, \u03c70, is consistently of order \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 emu mol\u22121atom Oe\u22121. However, systematic trends in \u03c70 are also largely absent, except perhaps in the case of the Ni series. On the other hand, the effective moments, peff show very clear trends across each substitutional series. These trends are illustrated in Fig. 4a, where it is immediately clear that Cr and Mn suppress the susceptibility, while Fe, Co, and Ni have the opposite effect."

            "text": "Average element-specific magnetic moments can be estimated via a least-squares method using the effective moments in Table 1. Assuming that each element contributes to the total\neffective moment as a linear function of its concentration, the net effective moment of the compound can be expressed as\npeff = \u2211\ni\nCi pi , (3)\nin which Ci is the concentration of element i, and pi is the effective moment of that element. For example, the net effective moment of Ni25 could be estimated as\n0.25 pNi + 0.1875(pCr + pMn + pFe + pCo) = peff,Ni25 , (4)\nand similar equations can be generated for each of the samples for which peff values are given in Table 1. If one assumes the element-specific magnetic moments are constant across all samples, an over-determined system of equations with only five unknowns is obtained. This set of linear equations can be solved by linear regression to produce best-fit values of the five elementspecific magnetic moments. Additional details of the fitting process are described in the Supplementary Material, Sec. S1.\nThe resulting element-specific moments are tabulated in Table 2. The extracted moments are of order a few \u00b5B, similar to typical experimental values found for these elements and also of the same order as the Hund\u2019s rules values [39]. However, the Cr and Mn moments enter as negative values, suggesting these elements exhibit a strong antiferromagnetic interaction. The solid lines in Fig. 4 are generated for each substututional series using the moments listed in Table 2 together with Eq. 2. Strikingly, this single set of five element-specific moments produces excellent agreement with the experimentally determined net effective moment across a wide range of compositions."

            "heading": "4.3. Comparison of DFT and experiment",
            "text": "Previous DFT calculations of the equiatomic Cantor alloy suggested a ferrimagnetic ordering at absolute zero [24], where the Fe, Co, and Ni species, and the Cr and Mn species couple ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically, respectively. In this work, the compositional dependence of the net moment was modeled in parallel to the experimental study, probing the\ndependence on a per species basis in the same manner as the experimental investigation. These results are shown in Fig. 4(b), where the net moment, as calculated by DFT, is plotted as a function of the variation of each species in the alloy, such that Ax[BCDE]100\u2212x represents the overall composition. In a similar fashion, a least-square fit is applied to the set of DFT calculated moments to obtain effective local moments of the individual species (see Table 2). Both DFT and experimentally derived element specific moments exhibit consistent signs, i.e., they are in agreement on the ferro- and antiferromagnetic tendency of each species. However, the magnitudes of the effective moments differ. Specifically, they differ on the ferromagnetic strengths of Fe and Ni and on the relative antiferromagnetic strength between Cr and Mn. Notably, DFT calculations predict a weak decrease in net effective moment with increasing Ni concentration, contrary to experimental results. This discord occurs despite the positive moment produced by the linear regression analysis of the DFT moments for Ni. In fact, this behavior can be understood as being due to the rather small Ni moment compared to the moments of Co and Fe, such that increasing Ni concentration proportionally decreases Co and Fe content, which lowers\nthe overall net moment. There could be several reasons for the discrepancy in the element specific moments from the analysis of DFT versus experimental data. First, the experimental peff moments were fit to susceptibility data measured in the temperature range of the paramagnetic state, i.e., above any magnetic ordering transition temperature. The DFT peff moments, on the other hand, were calculated at absolute zero, squarely within the temperature range corresponding to the ferrimagnetic state. Attempting to model the compositional dependence of the paramagnetic state through DFT, however, is not computationally feasible and would likely be subject to errors common to the approximations needed to depict the paramagnetic state in DFT.\nIndependent of the overall magnetic state, another potential contributing factor for the discrepancy between computationally and experimentally derived moments may be related to thermal expansion. The average volume associated with each atomic lattice site is a factor that has been shown have significant influence on the local magnetic moment behavior of species in this alloy [47]. As the volume of the lattice site increases, the magnitude of the local moment of each species may also change at different rates. In the case of Mn, Ma et al. [47] even showed the net direction of the average Mn spin tended to flip from down to up (or from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic) as the atomic volume increases. While the total amount of thermal expansion in the low temperature regime investigated here (T < 300 K) is likely small, effects on the local and net moment behavior may still be present.\nBillington et al. [48] carried out a detailed study of the element specific magnetic properties of the Cantor alloy and certain Cantor alloy variants using a combination of magnetic Compton scattering, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, and bulk magnetization measurements, noting significant discrepancies between computational and experimental results when examining magnetic moments. However, in compounds where computation and experiment disagreed, computational moments were much larger than experimental ones. For instance, they measured a net moment of 0.008 \u00b5B in a SQUID magnetometer for the equiatomic Cantor alloy, while different theoretical calculations predicted moments between 0.4 and 0.9 \u00b5B. However, one should note that the small moment reported from SQUID measurements appears to be based on a high field saturation moment, which is similar in magnitude to the typical magnetization observed at 70 KOe (see Fig. 1). Billington et al. attributed these discrepancies to the spin-glass behavior observed in the Cantor alloy and/or an unconventional magnetic ground state. Concerning the present study, the fact that effective moments extracted from modified Curie-Weiss fits are large compared to the magnetization at 70 kOe (and large compared to DFT calculated moments) is fully consistent with the picture that the Cantor alloy is a Stoner-enhanced itinerant magnet [24]. Such systems can exhibit very large ratios of the effective moment to the saturation moment [49].\nFinally, the moments extracted from our linear regression analysis and tabulated in the first row of Table 2 should not be expected to correspond exactly to element specific moments directly determined via methods such as inelastic x-ray scat-\ntering. Rather, they give the overall incremental contribution to the net effective moment as the concentration of one component of the alloy is adjusted. As such, these moments provide a useful guide to efforts to design Cantor alloy variants with specific magnetic properties."

            "text": "Near the equiatomic composition, the Cantor alloy undergoes two transitions, a ferrimagnetic transition at lower temperature and a spin-glass-like transition at higher temperature. While the spin-glass-like transition temperature varies depending on concentration, the ferrimagnetic transition is remarkably stable, occurring at approximately 43 K in all samples in which it appears despite not resulting from an impurity phase [24]. Trends in the magnetic properties are clearest in the Mn samples, in which larger concentrations shift the spin-glass-like transitions to higher temperatures and decrease the net effective moment. In alloys with low concentrations of Cr or Mn, however, the ferrimagnetic transition becomes ferromagnetic.\nFitting the susceptibility of Cantor alloy samples of many different compositions permits the estimation of the magnetic contribution from each constituent element by assuming a linear contribution from each. This analysis reveals that larger concentrations of ferromagnetic elements Fe, Co, and Ni increase the net effective magnetic moment of the Cantor alloy, while increased quantities of antiferromagnetic elements Cr and Mn decrease the net effective moment. The effective magnetic moments extracted via this process provide a road map facilitating a fine level of control over the magnetic moment of the Cantor alloy by varying its composition. Furthermore, similar regression analyses of data for a variety of chemically substituted samples could be extended to a wider range of high-entropy materials to provide similar insight into the composition dependence of a other properties."
