 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the long-term impacts of biochar application on soil health and crop yields over multiple growing seasons. The current study looked at just one year, so it would be interesting to see the cumulative effects over many years. 

2. Test different types of biochar, created from various feedstock materials, to see if the impacts on soil properties and crop growth vary. This study used biochar made from cassava straw, but biochars can be produced from many organic materials.

3. Explore the economic feasibility and cost-benefit analysis of using biochar as a soil amendment, considering the costs of biochar production versus the potential improvements in crop yields and fertilizer use efficiency. 

4. Look at potential environmental impacts of widespread biochar use, such as effects on greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient runoff, and carbon sequestration at a landscape scale.

5. Conduct field trials with different crops, soil types, and climates to determine if the benefits of biochar are applicable across diverse agroecosystems or are crop and site specific.
