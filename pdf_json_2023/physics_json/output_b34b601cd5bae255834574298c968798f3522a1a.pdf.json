Rechargeable alkali metal-ion batteries (such as lithium or sodium-ion batteries) with high energy and power density have been widely recognized as promising energy storage systems for portable electronic devices.1,2 Currently, graphite with a theoretical capacity of only 372 mA h g\u22121 is widely used as a commercial anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The low theoretical specic capacity and slow diffusion kinetics limit the rapid development of the battery market. Currently, carbonaceous materials have been proved to be one of the most promising anodes.3,4 Thus, it is necessary to explore excellent carbonaceous anode materials for high-performance Li-ion and Na-ion batteries.\nCarbonaceous materials have the advantages of high electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness.

So far, one of the effective strategies to improve the lithium/sodium storage performance of carbonaceous materials is to increase the interlayer spacing of carbonaceous materials, adjusting more Li+/Na+ adsorption active sites to enhance the capacitive contribution of LIBs and SIBs.12,13 Heteroatom doping (such as N, S, P, etc.) has recently been shown to be a good way to enhance the capacitive contribution of carbonaceous materials, thereby enhancing their Li+/Na+ storage performance.14,15 For example, Wang et al. reported a phosphorus and oxygen dual-doped porous carbon spheres with enhanced reaction kinetics, which facilitates the fast transfer of K+ and exhibits a reversible capacity of 401 mA h g\u22121 at 100 mA g\u22121 and excellent cycling stability.16 In addition, heteroatom-doped (N, S, P, etc.) porous carbons can also be easily obtained by carbonization of MOFs with heteroatom-containing ligands.17\u201319 Today, a new catalytic\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Carbonized MOFs precursors release gaseous molecules, and the resulting MnO nodes act as in situ catalysts, and the ligands contain a large amount of N element, which facilitates in situ N doping of the product. As a result, the interlayer spacing of carbon material was increased, additional active sites and many cavities interconnected by channels are generated in the nal carbon material, which alleviates the volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling, expands the contact area between the electrolyte and the active material, and shortens the diffusion distance of electrons and Li+/Na+ during cycling process, thereby improves the electrochemical performance of the electrode material."

When the current density gradually increases from 100 to 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000mA g\u22121, the specic capacities of NCNFs800 decreases from 1150 to 1057, 894, 799, 760 and 716 mA h g\u22121, respectively. When the current density decreased from 1000 to 100 mA g\u22121 again, the discharge capacity is retained at 1309 mA h g\u22121, indicating that NCNFs-800 has good reversibility for LIBs. Moreover, the rate capability of NCNFs800 is superior to those of NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3e, the long-term cyclic stability at a high current density of 2 A g\u22121 is also investigated. Aer 5000 cycles, it is surprisingly found that NCNFs-800 contain a high reversible capacity of 635 mA h g\u22121, suggesting the excellent cycling performance, which is superior than NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700 (Fig. S13\u2020), implying its potential for practical applications.

A broad peak at approximately 1.1 V appears in the rst cathodic process, which can be attributed to the formation of SEI lms.44 In addition, the broad peak at approximately 0.25 V can be ascribed to the interaction of Na+ into the interlayer of carbon and the sorption of Na+ with active sites (defects and edge doping sites) in NCNFs-800.45 The anodic peak at approximately 0.22 V can be attributed to the extraction of Na+ from NCNFs-800.46 The CV curves overlap well aer the subsequent ones, implying highly reversible Na+-storage performances.47 As shown Fig. 3b, the galvanostatic discharge/\nV curves of NCNFs-800 at 0.1 mV s\u22121.

The NCNFs-800 shows excellent cycling performance with a high discharge capacity of 323 mA h g \u22121 aer 150 cycles, which is superior than those of the NCNFs-700 (265 mA h g\u22121) and NCNFs-600 (230 mA h g\u22121) and reported carbon anodes for SIBs (Table S3\u2020). Meanwhile, the coulombic efficiency (CE) of the NCNFs-800 is retained above 99.35% aer the 150 cycles, suggesting that the NCNFs-800 has a good cyclic stability as an anode material in Na+ half cells. Fig. 4d shows the rate performances of NCNFs at different current densities. When the current density gradually increases from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 A g\u22121, the specic capacities of NCNFs-800 decreases from 405 to 341, 299, 274, 264, 253, 231, 207 and 180 mA h g\u22121, respectively. When the current density decreased from 10.0 to 0.1 mA g\u22121 again, the discharge capacity is retained at 356 mA h g\u22121, indicating that NCNFs-800 has good reversibility for SIBs. Moreover, the rate capability of NCNFs-800 is superior to those of NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3e, the long-term cyclic stability at a high current density of 2 A g\u22121 is also investigated. Aer 5000 cycles, it is surprisingly found that NCNFs-800 contain a high reversible capacity of 194 mA h g\u22121, suggesting the excellent cycling performance, which is superior than NCNFs-600 and NCNFs700 (Fig. S16\u2020), implying its potential for practical applications. The cycling stabilities of NCNFs of 1 A g\u22121 is also shown\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nin Fig. S17.\u2020 The high specic capacity and outstanding longterm cycling stability of NCNFs-800 could be attributed to its porous structure and interconnected channels and the doping of nitrogen atoms. The interconnected channels and porous structure can increase the contact area between the material and the electrolyte, shorten the Li+/Na+ diffusion distance, and relieve the volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The doping of nitrogen atoms can improve the conductivity of the electrode material and increase active sites.\nIn order to further explore the electrochemical reactions of NCNFs-800, we simply analyzed the lithium-storage and sodium-storage kinetics of NCNFs-800 based on the measured CV curves at different scan rates from 0.2 mV s\u22121 to 3.6 mV s\u22121 were shown in Fig. S18a and c.\u2020 The curves of NCNFs-800 are similar, and the peak intensities of the cathode and anode increase with the scan rate.50 According the electrochemical theory, the current (i) is related to the scan rate (v):51,52\ni = avb (1)\nlog(i) = b log(v) + log(a) (2)\nwhere a and b are adjustable constants. The lithium-storage and sodium-storage mechanism of NCNFs-800 can be conrmed by b-value that can be obtained through the slope of log(i)\u2013log(v) t curve. In general, the b-value closes to 0.5, implying that the electrochemical reaction is controlled by the diffusioncontrolled process; while the b-value approaches to 1, indicating the ideal capacitive process.53 As shown in Fig. S18b and d,\u2020 for lithium-storage and sodium-storage, the calculated bvalues for NCNFs-800 of both cathodic and anodic perks are closed to 1.0, indicating that the lithium-storage and sodiumstorage behavior for NCNFs-800 is dominated by a capacitive-\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5634\u20135642 | 5639\nFig. 5 Kinetics analysis of NCNFs.

In addition, the capacitance contribution ratio can be calculated by the following formulas:54,55\ni = k1v + k2v 1/2 (3)\ni/v1/2 = k1v 1/2 + k2 (4)\nwhere k1v represents the contribution of the capacitive process, At the scan rate of 1.6 mV s\u22121, the capacitive contribution of lithium-storage and sodium-storage for NCNFs-800 are approximately 71% and 68%, respectively (Fig. 5a and d), which demonstrates the high charge storage capacitive of the NCNFs800. Fig. 5b and e show that the capacitive contribution of the three samples increases with the scan rate.56\nTo further investigate the charge transfer resistance and cycling stability of the electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed. Fig. S19a,\u2020c displays the Nyquist plots of the NCNFs in Li+/Na+ half cells, for Li+ half cells and Na+ half cells, it is clearly observed that the chargetransfer resistance (Rct) values of NCNFs-800 is lower than those of NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700. NCNFs-800 displays a lower tting resistance than NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700, this demonstrates that the abundant defect structure of NCNFs-800 facilitates rapid electron transfer during the discharge/charge process.57 Besides, the Warburg impedance Zw is related to the diffusion process of Li+/Na+, which can be represented by the D value, which can be calculated using the following equations:\nu = 2pf (5)\nZ\u2032 = R + su\u22121/2 (6)\n5640 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5634\u20135642\nD \u00bc R 2T2\n2A2n4F 4C2s2 (7)\nwhere R, T, A, n, F,C and s are the ideal gas constant (8.314 Jmol\u22121 K\u22121), the absolute temperature (298 K), effective surface area of the electrode (1.5 cm2), the number of the transferred electrons (1), the Faraday constant (96 500 C mol\u22121), the bulk concentration (1 M) and the Warburg coefficient, respectively.58 The Warburg coefficient (s) can be calculated by formulas (5) and (6), as shown in Fig. S19b and d,\u2020 for Li+ half cells and Na+ half cells, the corresponding DK+ values of NCNFs-800 is higher than NCNFs-600 and NCNFs-700, indicating that the NCNFs-800 exhibits the highest diffusion rate.59 In addition, as shown in Fig. 5c and f, the EIS prole of the NCNFs-800 is almost overlapped aer 10 cycles, indicating its good reversibility."
