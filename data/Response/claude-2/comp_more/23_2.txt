 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Develop new datasets in other languages to test critical reasoning abilities in a multilingual setting. The current RULE dataset is in English only. Creating versions in other languages would allow for cross-lingual evaluation.

2. Explore different formats beyond multiple choice questions, such as free-form rationale generation, to assess critical reasoning skills. This could mitigate the limitations of the multiple choice format. 

3. Conduct experiments on a wider range of model architectures and sizes to better understand how different models perform on rationale understanding. The current study focuses mostly on large language models.

4. Develop methods to improve models' ability to comprehend eliminative rationales. This could involve techniques to better handle negation or distractor options. The models currently struggle on eliminative subquestions.

5. Investigate whether rationale-augmented training on the main logical reasoning task improves performance on both main questions and subquestions. The current study only looks at test-time rationale augmentation.
