"We overcome label leakage by a dynamic UNet model for cropping arbitrary pixels. The U-Net model created cropped images at a human-level performance we are used for training the multi-class tools detection model. The revised tool classification model started to focus on more relevant regions to make predictions. This approach not only tackles data leakage but also avoids unnecessary computation (wasted in processing irrelevant pixels)."
