Data was collected from 1524 first-generation college students from five universities in Liaoning Province. SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 24.0 were used to analyze the data.\nResults: Family economic capital significantly predicted ability development (standardized regression coefficient = 0.198, P < 0.001) and academic performance (standardized regression coefficient = 0.220, P < 0.001); Family cultural capital significantly predicted ability development (standardized regression coefficient = .114, P < 0.001), academic performance (standardized regression coefficient = 0.217, P < 0.001) and self-concept (standardized regression coefficient = 0.160, P < 0.001); Family social capital significantly predicted academic performance (standardized regression coefficient=0.084, P < 0.01) and self-concept (standardized regression coefficient = 0.156, P < 0.001).\nConclusion: Family capital can significantly affect the academic achievement of firstgeneration college students. To bridge the gap of academic achievement caused by family capital for first-generation college students and promote class mobility, special attention should be paid to the internal actions of students in higher education fields, the connection between different fields should be strengthened, and humanistic care for disadvantaged groups should be implemented.\nKEYWORDS\nfamily capital, academic achievement, ability development, academic performance, self-concept, structural equation model, first-generation college student\n1. Introduction\nAgainst the backdrop of accelerated popularization of higher education and favorable national policies, more and more students from ordinary families have the access to university. At the same time, the structure of the student group also shows diversity and differences. Relevant survey also points out that not less than 70% of college students in China\u2019s undergraduate colleges and universities are \u201cfirst-generation college students in families\u201d (Zhang et al., 2017), which refers to full-time college students whose parents have not received tertiary education at junior college level or above and this definition does not"

As higher education enters a new stage of universalization, first-generation college students have more equitable access to higher education, but still face many problems and challenges in the process of education. The success brought by college entrance exams may seem to open the door to social mobility, but it does not necessarily mean that they can adapt to college life and obtain the same academic achievement and social experience as non-first-generation college students after entering campus. When many scholars study these influences, they first consider the ascribed factors, for example, family background. Related studies have shown that family capital has a significant impact on college students\u2019 academic achievement, which means that differences in family capital significantly affect students\u2019 academic achievement and if such differences continue to expand, it will inevitably affect the children of the lower class to achieve social mobility.\nAs a major group of students, first-generation college students have all the necessity of the research. By investigating the group characteristics of the first-generation college students in families, we\u00a0can analyze more accurately which factors in the family capital affect the academic achievement of first-generation college students in families, and help students to take timely measures to bridge their inherent gaps according to their actual situation. It is of great value and significance to figure out the factors influencing the academic achievement of first-generation college students. For families, a more reasonable investment will be\u00a0 put in their education for better academic achievements so as to avoid the waste of educational resources; as for schools, different measures can be\u00a0taken to show more care for vulnerable groups and then ensure the fairness of education. At the same time, it is worth reflecting on whether higher education and the university field, as links for students\u2019 development, perpetuate class stratification or achieve class mobility? Through the analysis of the influences of family capital on the academic achievement of first-generation college students, this paper attempts to answer the influences mechanism of family capital, hoping to provide more ideas for the research on the influence related to the academic achievement of first-generation college students."

            "text": "The term \u201cfamily capital\u201d originated from the theory of social capital. Coleman et\u00a0al. (1966) pointed out that family capital is a part of social capital and covers the occupation, social status, economic conditions and education level of parents, etc., which is owned by individuals, expounded in interpersonal relations, and provides convenience for individual actions. In Forms of Capital, Bourdieu (1986) pointed out that the three basic forms of capital are economic capital, cultural capital and social capital, and these three kinds of capital are not independent of each other. According to Bourdieu\u2019s \u201cexchange principle,\u201d the three kinds of capital can be\u00a0transformed into each other under certain conditions (Bourdieu, 1986). Coleman (1988) believed that there are three forms of capital, namely, social\ncapital, physical capital, and human capital. Among them, social capital is a capital property characterized by social structure resources owned by individuals, which is provided by family, neighborhood, community and other primitive social organizations, and is divided into social capital within the family and social capital outside the family. The forms of social capital are obligations and expectations, social information networks, norms and effective punishments, authority relations and social organizations. In Coleman\u2019s opinion, the connotation of family capital is relatively broad, and significantly affects students\u2019 academic achievement.\nIn China, research on family capital is based on the capital theory of Bourdieu and Coleman, and expands related to China\u2019s social environment. Liu and Gao (2011) interpreted family capital as the family background that college students use to achieve some \u201cinstrumental purposes,\u201d which is divided into four dimensions: family economic capital, family cultural capital, family political capital and family social capital. Family economic capital is represented by family annual income and inherent assets, and family cultural capital is represented by the cultural level of the father. The political status of the family and the administrative rank of the post are used to represent the political capital of the family, and the father\u2019s occupation, family social status and the breadth of human connections are used to measure the family social capital. Jiang and Yan (2006) divided family capital into three dimensions: family economic capital, family cultural capital and family social capital. Family income, family assets and father\u2019s occupation reflected family economic capital stock; father\u2019s education level, family school supplies and collection reflected family cultural capital stock; and connection between parents and children\u2019s learning reflected family social capital.\nBased on previous research by scholars on family capital and the division of its dimensions, this paper defines family capital as the sum of family members\u2019 economic wealth, parents\u2019 occupation, parents\u2019 cultural level and the stock of social interpersonal relationship. And in this paper, family capital is divided into three dimensions: family economic capital, family cultural capital, and family social capital."

            "text": "Most scholars study the influencing factors of academic achievement from three aspects: individual, school and family. For example, Wang and Liu (2000) pointed out that intelligence level can be\u00a0used to explain the difference in students\u2019 academic achievement, which is fully demonstrated in the difference in the way of students\u2019 thinking. In addition, some scholars have found that there is a significant relationship between students\u2019 academic achievement and individual psychological factors, among which, goal awareness and professional emotions have a positive impact on college students\u2019 academic achievement, while learning process pressure has a negative impact on college students\u2019 academic achievement. Other studies have shown that gender factors will also have an important impact on college students\u2019 major learning. Male students take the dominant position in both high and low groups, and the gender differences in academic performance will continue to deepen in the upper grades. Students can make full use of their abilities and advantages by adjusting their learning state and developing learning methods suitable for themselves, so as to achieve pre-set learning goals and achieve satisfactory academic achievements.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nZhao et\u00a0al. (2020), in studying the influence of school environment on college students\u2019 academic achievement, took teachers\u2019 expectation pressure and graduation pressure from school as variables and found that these pressures would cause some students to show excessive tension and anxiety during study, which would affect their academic performance and reduce their academic achievement. Bai (2013) found in his research on factors influencing college students\u2019 learning gains that good use of school resources, supportive campus environment, more social interactions and academic activities would encourage students to invest more time and energy in their personal learning, thus promoting students to obtain good learning results. In addition, curriculum of colleges and universities, students\u2019 professional identity, educational function of campus activities, humanistic care of schools and teachers, and learning enthusiasm of classmates also have a significant effect on the improvement of students\u2019 academic achievement.\nMost of the factors influencing academic performance were attributed to individual quality and school education, until Coleman et\u00a0al. (1966) pointed out that school conditions did not have a significant effect on academic performance, but it was the socioeconomic status level of students\u2019 families that significantly affected the chance of academic success. The conclusion of Coleman\u2019s report greatly impacts the traditional concept of school education, and reminds people that the research on the factors influencing academic achievement should not be\u00a0limited to the individual and school level. Chinese scholars Liu and Lu (2009) and Li (2013) have proved that there is a direct causal relationship between the educational background of parents and the annual income level of the family and their children\u2019s academic performance. The higher the economic status index, the more parents are likely to invest in their children\u2019s education and the more likely their children are to achieve academic excellence. In addition, parents\u2019 professional status may also affect their children\u2019s academic achievement. Fang and Feng (2008) found that the children of managers have the best academic performance, followed by the children of professional and technical personnel, followed by the children of migrant workers, and the children of those who have no fixed occupation have the worst academic performance.\nIt can be\u00a0 seen that personal factors, school environment and family environment will affect students\u2019 academic achievement to varying degrees, and they jointly affect students\u2019 learning motivation, learning engagement and learning satisfaction. Among them, individual factors and school factors will be\u00a0connected with family factors to varying degrees to affect students\u2019 academic achievement. Therefore, this paper will mainly study the influence of family capital on students\u2019 academic achievement."

Most studies have shown that students\u2019 academic achievement and family economic level are closely related, that is to say, the higher socioeconomic status the parents are, the higher academic achievement level their children will achieve. For example, Frank McCourt studied the influence of family revenue on the achievement of American high school students. He\u00a0 found that the difference of family revenue will lead to the inequality of educational opportunities and the difference of students\u2019 achievement. In China, with the data from 20 higher institutes of Jiangsu Province, Gao et\u00a0al. (2011) also found that \u201cfamily economic status has a significant positive effect on college students\u2019 academic performance during school, and children from high-income families have better academic performance than children from low-and-middle income families.\u201d\nThe \u201ceffective maintenance of inequality\u201d theory suggests that the expanding size of education does not affect the gap in educational quality in spite of the decreasing inequality in access to education formally because the internal disparities in educational quality are still evident. Families in the advantaged class will seek to ensure their children\u2019s education, and they will use their advantages to obtain better educational resources for their children to further maintain their class status. College students from advantaged families with highly educated parents still have their own advantages when they enter college compared to their childhood, and they are more confident and outperform students from poorer areas in terms of academic performance and ability development."

            "text": "With the constant strengthening of China\u2019s investment in education and the continuous adjustment of education policies, China\u2019s higher education has been shifting from meritocratic to universal education, the education inequality in form is gradually diminishing, and many students from poor families have more opportunities to enter universities for higher education with the help of favorable policies. Despite many shortcomings, those children from underclass such as workers and farmers are relying on their own efforts to break the monopoly of the upper class on higher elite education. They are willing to pay more for their studies to convert their cultural capital into economic capital to the greatest extent possible, and to put in more effort to get higher income in the future.\nWhile children from advantaged families are using economic resources to \u201cdirectly\u201d exclude and cultural resources to \u201cinvisibly\u201d exclude students from poor families and widen the gap between classes, children from disadvantaged families are striving to bridge the gap as early as they entered the college (Tan et\u00a0al., 2018). The resilience theory suggests that students from families with low economic and cultural capital but high levels of resilience have the ability to achieve high levels of academic achievement through the investment of non-material resources in family capital that prioritizes education and the stimulation of their own potential.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nIn addition, with the continuous development of economy, more and more parents from the disadvantaged class are aware of the importance of literacy. At present, education is still one of the most effective ways to achieve class mobility. Studies have found that, in contrast to the argument that \u201cRags to riches stories are rare,\u201d families of the classes of worker and peasant show higher educational expectations and are willing to invest more in education to bridge the innate gap, motivating their children to rely on education to achieve class leapfrogging. For example, William H, together with other researchers, have found that educational expectations have a significant impact on students\u2019 academic achievement independent of family socioeconomic status and intelligence. Wang and Shi (2014), based on the 2010 Shanghai Household Living Conditions Survey, found that advantaged families have higher educational expectations for their children and their children also have the same expectations for themselves, which are ultimately beneficial to their children\u2019s higher education attainment.\nIn conclusion, if the inhibitory effect is in dominant position, then there will be\u00a0a gap between children from advantaged and disadvantaged families. Therefore, many current education preferential policies have achieved equity in terms of goals and structures, but there still have inequity in efficiency, and the advantaged class will still predominate the main educational resources. If the incentive effect dominates, then many children from poor families will still work hard to change their academic achievement status without the impact of family deficit. In this way, both the equity of the goals and structures and equal efficiency are met. However, there is no definite conclusion in the academic field as to which of the two effects of family capital dominates among the factors influencing academic achievement of first-generation college students. Therefore, the hypothesizes are proposed as follows.\nH1: Family economic capital has a significant positive effect on the academic achievement of first-generation college students.\nH2: Family cultural capital has a significant positive effect on the academic achievement of first-generation college students.\nH3: Family social capital has a significant positive effect on the academic achievement of first-generation college students.\nAcademic achievement could be divided into three dimensions: academic performance, ability development and self-concept (Jia et al., 2020). Thus, in this study, H1 is subdivided into H1a, H1b and H1c; H2 is subdivided into H2a, H2b and H2c; H3 is subdivided into H3a, H3b and H3c. H1a, H1b, H1c, H2a, H2b, H2c, H3a, H3b and H3c are as follows.\nH1a: FFamily economic capital has a significant positive effect on the ability development of first-generation college students.\nH1b: Family economic capital has a significant positive effect on the academic performance of first-generation college students.\nH1c: Family economic capital has a significant positive effect on the self-concept of first-generation college students.\nH2a: Family cultural capital has a significant positive effect on the ability development of first-generation college students.\nH2b: Family cultural capital has a significant positive effect on the academic performance of first-generation college students.\nH2c: Family cultural capital has a significant positive effect on the self-concept of first-generation college students.\nH3a: Family social capital has a significant positive effect on the ability development of first-generation college students.\nH3b: Family social capital has a significant positive effect on the academic performance of first-generation college students.\nH3c: Family social capital has a significant positive effect on the self-concept of first-generation college students."

Its objective is to document changes in various aspects of Chinese society, economy, population, education, and so on. Prior to the official survey, a small-scale pre-survey was conducted among university students from five universities in Liaoning Province (a total of 330 questionnaires were distributed). The purpose of this pre-survey was to test the rationality of questionnaire item design, completion time, and other factors. Based on the results of the pre-survey, adjustments were made to the wording and content of the survey questionnaire. Additionally, the pre-survey samples were not included in the valid samples for the official survey.\nThe formal questionnaire takes the method of hierarchical clustering sampling. A total of 2,200 questionnaires were distributed in the formal survey, and 2031 of them filled by the students from five universities in Liaoning Province, and were collected in the end.

Therefore, five questions are designed, which are: \u201cthe total annual income of your family\u201d \u201cthe per capita monthly income of your family is approximately\u201d \u201cyour family\u2019s contribution to your university expenses (tuition and living expenses)\u201d \u201cyour father\u2019s occupation\u201d \u201cyour mother\u2019s occupation.\u201d\nIn the aspect of cultural capital, family cultural capital refers to the possession of family cultural resources, including institutionalized family cultural capital, specific family cultural capital and objective family cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1986). Objective cultural capital is embodied in the form of cultural goods, including books, dictionaries, tools and other family possessions. Specific cultural capital is embodied in the temperament tendency internalized in human spirit and body, such as internalized language, skills, tastes, behaviors, knowledge systems, etc. Institutionalized cultural capital is the capital obtained through some system confirmation, such as vocational certificates, academic certificates and award certificates with social value granted by authoritative institutions such as schools and government agencies. Research shows that parents\u2019 education level and family book resources have important influence on the development of students\u2019 reading ability. Scarborough and Dobrich (1994) found that parents\u2019 education level had a positive effect on children\u2019s reading ability. McQuillan and AU (2001) found that household book collections were positively correlated with reading frequency and reading achievement. This article refers to the research of Li and Tan (2019) and Li et\u00a0al. (2022), and designs four questions for family cultural capital, which are: \u201cyour father\u2019s highest education qualification\u201d \u201cyour mother\u2019s highest education qualification\u201d \u201cyour family book collection\u201d \u201chow often do your family members take you\u00a0 to participate in cultural activities (including viewing exhibitions, visiting museums, etc.).\u201d\nIn the aspect of social capital, this paper points out that family social capital mainly refers to the parent\u2013child relationship within the family, parents\u2019 educational expectation for their children, and parents\u2019 external social relationship and the utilization degree of parents\u2019 social relations. Marjoribanks and Mboya (2001) also argue that family social capital mainly refers to the relationship between family members, and that for individuals, parents in the family are important subjects of family social capital. In addition, this paper refers to the research of Zheng (2012) and Du and Ding (2014), and designs 4 questions for family social capital, which are: \u201cwhen encountering matters related to you, your family members will discuss with you\u00a0in advance\u201d \u201cthe number of times your parents communicate with you\u00a0each month\u201d \u201cyour family has a wide circle of friends\u201d \u201cwhen you\u00a0need, you\u00a0can get help from relatives and friends.\u201d Therefore, this study divides family capital into economic capital (annual income of the family, parents\u2019 occupational status, and investment in children\u2019s\neducation), cultural capital (parents\u2019 literacy, book collection at home, and frequency of participation in cultural activities), and social capital (including parents\u2019 interpersonal network, satisfaction with the help provided by relatives and friends, and frequency of communication between parents and children). In each of the questions, five scales were assigned in descending order, with higher scores indicating higher capital stock in that dimension. For the measurement of each dimension of family capital, the Likert Scale is used in the study with five levels from low to high, each assigned a score of 1\u20135. The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of this scale is 0.856. The CR values of economic capital, cultural capital and social capital are 0.936, 0.869 and 0.943 respectively.

For other paths, the C.R values are greater than 1.96, which means that these paths are significant. Thus, H1a, H1b, H2a, H2b, H2c, H3b, and H3c are all confirmed. Through the standardized regression coefficients, it can be seen that for the family economic capital, it has greater impact on academic performance than on ability development. For the family cultural capital, it has the greatest impact on academic performance, followed by self-concept and ability development; for family social capital, it has greater impact on self-concept than on academic performance."

First-generation college students, as the main representative of the student group, have many influencing factors that cause the difference in academic achievement.\nBased on the ascribed factor of family, many scholars have analyzed the differences in the impact of economic capital, cultural capital and social capital in the family on the academic achievement of college students. However, it is not clear whether these factors have a direct and significant impact on the academic achievement of first-generation college students and how they act\nTABLE\u00a04 Correlation matrix.\nEconomic capital Cultural capital\nSocial capital Ability development\nAcademic achievement\nSelfconcept\nEconomic capital 1 0.056* 0.369** 0.266** 0.069** 0.178**\nCultural capital 0.056* 1 0.210** 0.136** 0.056* 0.145**\nSocial capital 0.369** 0.210** 1 0.407** 0.041 0.344**\nAbility development 0.266** 0.136** 0.407** 1 0.056* 0.531**\nAcademic achievement 0.069** 0.056* 0.041 0.056* 1 \u22120.052*\nSelf-concept 0.178** 0.145** 0.344** 0.531** \u22120.052* 1\n*Significant relation at level 0.05. **Significant relation at level 0.01.\nTABLE\u00a05 Test results of model fit degree of initial model.\nIndex \u03c72/df NFI RMSEA GFI AGFI RFI TLI CN P Numerical value 5.250 0.953 0.053 0.935 0.919 0.946 0.956 332 0.000\nCriterion <5 >0.90 <0.08 >0.90 >0.90 >0.90 >0.90 >200 <0.01\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\non the academic achievement. This study explores the influence path of family capital factors on academic achievement through structural equation model, and the results show that family cultural capital has a direct positive impact on the academic achievement of first-generation college students. Among them, economic capital has a greater impact on the academic performance and ability development of the first-generation college students, but has no significant positive impact on selfconcept. Social capital has a major impact on the academic performance and self-concept of the first-generation college students, but has no significant effect on ability development. Generally speaking, the higher the educational level of parents in the family, the more their children are influenced by their parents, and their academic achievements will be\u00a0 relatively prominent. In addition, the improvement of the economic and social status in the family will also provide material support for the children\u2019s educational investment, and the parents\u2019 ability levels are also passed on from generation to generation. At the same time, the social network of parents in the family and the support provided by relatives and friends will also indirectly affect the children. Good interpersonal communication will subtly affect the values and attitudes of children and help children form correct self-cognition. In conclusion, the \u201cinhibitory effect\u201d of family capital in higher education is still dominant, and the overall impact on academic achievement is significant. Indeed, relevant research shows that the family economic disadvantaged college students have the characteristics of \u201clow starting point, rapid development,\u201d their family economic background plays the role of incentives rather than inhibition and helps them catch up with other college students in ability (Tan et\u00a0al., 2018). But this \u201cincentive effect\u201d only exists in some elite institutions, where students rely on high-quality academic performance to obtain high-quality secondary school admission opportunities and resources to make up for the lack of cultural capital of their families, and through self-adjustment and efforts to achieve academic resilience (Zhang and Zhu, 2018).\nFIGURE\u00a02 Modified structural equation model.

            "text": "As an innate factor, family capital has an important impact on students at different stages of school age. In the stage of entering higher education, in addition to structural factors such as family economic level, parents\u2019 educational level, family cultural atmosphere and parents\u2019 social interpersonal relationship, school capital should also be\u00a0noticed. The school factor has been absent for a long time in the research on social inequality in our country. The perspective of Western \u201cconflict theory\u201d often regards schools as \u201cfilters\u201d and \u201cagents of the upper middle class\u201d (Ju and Liu, 2022). The study of schools in the conflict theory is based on Weber\u2019s theory of cultural conflict, which holds that education is controlled by the dominant class and is the transmission of the identity culture of the dominant class. Afterwards, it continued to develop, and the most representative theory in the conflict theory is Bourdieu\u2019s cultural capital theory. Bourdieu\u2019s cultural capital theory emphasizes that children bring the behavior habits soaked in the family to school, which leads to different preferences of the school. The habitus of the upper class is favored and rewarded by the school, which ultimately promotes the educational success of its children, while the educational results of the lower-class children are the opposite (Liu, 2013). In particular, first of all, the conflict theory emphasizes the screening function of education, and holds that the screening mechanism in education implies the class preference of school education, and that the competition of different\nclasses for education is accomplished in the process of education screening, the criterion for screening is the behavioral characteristics of the dominant class. Secondly, conflict theory holds that the stratification of education is the result of class struggle, which is mainly affected by family background. Finally, conflict theory holds that for individuals, rule internalization leads to the results of screening, and rule internalization of different classes leads to different educational achievements (Liu and Hu, 2012). However, this perspective actually ignores the realistic gap between western countries and Chinese society, and ignores the positive role of schools. In the field of higher education, how to weaken the impact of family capital gap on academic achievement, give full play to the positive role of school capital, and achieve effective class mobility. Based on this, the following implications are drawn:"

            "heading": "6.1. Recommendation 1. Pay close attention to the internal actions of students in the field of higher education",
            "text": "In examining academic achievement, previous studies have ignored the group differences of students, limited to the acquisition of educational resources, and seldom considered the real acquisition of resources and the degree of mastery of utilization. Students are slightly different in micro-levels such as personality characteristics, habitual acquisition, and social cognition. Structural duality (Giddens, 2016)\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nholds that, on the one hand, society itself has structures, which constrains people. On the other hand, people should not only recognize the original social structure, but also adjust behavioral rules and social institutions. Similarly, as the main body of higher education, we\u00a0 should not only learn to use educational resources, but also strengthen the interaction between resources and rules. In other words, while using educational resources, we\u00a0must strive to change the rules according to their own needs, so as to meet new educational needs. In addition, Vroom\u2019s \u201cexpectation theory\u201d believes that the greater a person estimates the value of the goal, the greater the probability of the estimated goals will be\u00a0achieved, and the greater the motivation for them. Therefore, in the field of higher education, students themselves should strengthen their expectations of achievement development and self-fulfillment, so as to inspire them to make more efforts in practical actions, give full play to their subjective initiative, and embed their practical actions into objective. At the same time, in the school environment, for students, the selfcontained factors are constantly strengthened, and the impact of the deficit caused by the ascribed factors is reduced, which is conducive to moving toward higher-level goals. Finally, the main body of students should make full use of school capital to make up for the lack of family capital. The theory of resilience explores the inherent advantages of first-generation college students from a positive psychological perspective. This theory explains that individuals show stronger adaptability in adversity. When they find that their objective conditions are insufficient, they will be\u00a0willing to put in more efforts and actions to make up for the innate gap. After first-generation college students enter the university stage, on the one hand, they must give full play to their own subjective initiative, and on the other hand, they must learn to transform the educational and cultural resources of the school into their own cultural capital, and eliminate the conflict between themselves and non-first-generation college students through effective interaction with the school environment. At present, faculty and staff in Chinese universities generally belong to first-generation college students. They have similar family background and study experiences with first-generation college students. They can play a role of example and demonstration in daily contact and teaching process, so as to strengthen effective teacher-student interaction and stimulate students\u2019 academic enthusiasm.\nIn addition, related research shows that when the first-generation group of students cannot obtain a better educational experience from their parents, they will turn this sustenance to the teachers of the school, thereby improving the quality of teacher-student interaction and benefiting students\u2019 educational gains."

            "heading": "6.2. Recommendation 2. Strengthen the interaction between different fields",
            "text": "At present, when studying the academic achievements of firstgeneration college students, scholars mostly focus on the representation of different fields and the internal operation mechanism, ignoring the mutual linkage and influence between different fields (Shen, 2021). First, in the family field, although the parents of first-generation college students have not received higher education and lack of experiences in education, they should give strong support in education investment, give their children high educational expectations so as to bring honor to the family through\neducation. Relevant studies have shown that there are still a large number of families in rural China that cannot afford higher education costs, but material support from family relatives still plays an important role in their children\u2019s education. Therefore, the linkage between small family and large family of China\u2019s first-generation college students may still make up for the lack of capital. Second, for the field of basic education, the \u201cfault phenomenon\u201d between basic education and higher education still exists (Ding and Li, 2022). Education is a continuous and interconnected process, and educational achievements cannot be\u00a0 achieved overnight. The accumulation of education in the previous stage is of great significance to the subsequent stage. Relevant studies have shown that the learning habits and quality formation in high school have an important impact on the adaptation to college. Therefore, in the whole process of education, we\u00a0should do a good job of connecting tasks at each stage, and strengthen the effective interaction between higher education and basic education. For the difficulties and deficiencies that are about to enter the university stage, basic education should make preparations in advance, and especially for children from lower-level families, more attention should be\u00a0paid."

            "text": "At present, with the continuous development of China\u2019s economy, China is paying more and more attention to the issue of education fairness. The introduction of preferential policies for education has helped those families in difficulty, so that children from remote areas can go to school. However, in recent years, one-size-fits-all assistance projects for various vulnerable groups have not been able to effectively meet the complex needs of firstgeneration college students, and the \u201csimple and rude\u201d funding policies of major universities have not achieved substantial results. When dealing with the educational fairness of first-generation college students, China\u2019s colleges and universities can also learn from the relevant experience of foreign countries, such as the intervention project experiences of the University of Maryland in the United\u00a0States. Chinese universities can also collect students\u2019 family situation in advance, create different learning and living environments according to the number of first-generation college students in the university, formulate different dormitory allocation policies and arrange counselors with similar family backgrounds, give effective care for life and learning, and do auxiliary work for better adaptation to university life. In addition, schools should also formulate different teaching modes according to the predicaments of the first-generation college students, such as reducing the direct teaching, encouraging students to discover problems independently, and strengthening effective interaction with teachers in the process of guidance, so as to prevent the first-generation college students from entering new unconscious conflict because of inappropriate campus environment. In addition, when higher education alleviates the impact of disadvantaged family, the support of teachers and peers is also an important driving force for the development of firstgeneration college students. Teachers should not only play the role of good teachers, but also life mentors on the way of students\u2019 development, to increase students\u2019 self-confidence, explore\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nstudents\u2019 potential, and improve students\u2019 cognitive level. School can also strengthen the communication between students by holding various cultural activities, so that students can find suitable companions for them, and can also share the inspirational stories of the senior students to stimulate the fighting spirit of the junior students, narrow the educational gap, and improve their academic achievements."
