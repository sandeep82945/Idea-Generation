1. **Investigate the effect of different degrees of hydrolysis on the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates.** This could be done by varying the hydrolysis time or the enzyme concentration. It would be interesting to see if there is an optimal degree of hydrolysis for antioxidant activity.


2. **Test the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates in other food systems.** The current study only tested the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates in palm olein. It would be interesting to see if they also have antioxidant activity in other food systems, such as emulsions, sauces, or baked goods.


3. **Identify the specific peptides in soy protein hydrolysates that are responsible for their antioxidant activity.** This could be done using mass spectrometry or other analytical techniques. Once the active peptides are identified, they could be synthesized and tested for their antioxidant activity.


4. **Investigate the mechanism by which soy protein hydrolysates exert their antioxidant activity.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy or fluorescence spectroscopy. Understanding the mechanism of action would help to design more effective antioxidant peptides.


5. **Evaluate the safety of soy protein hydrolysates for use in food.** This would involve conducting toxicity studies and clinical trials. Once the safety of soy protein hydrolysates is established, they could be used as natural antioxidants in a variety of food products.
