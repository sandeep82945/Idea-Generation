1. **Investigate the effects of different iron species on Cr(VI) removal by Fe-BC.** The current study did not distinguish between different iron species in the Fe-BC, which may have led to an underestimation of the direct impact of iron content on Cr(VI) removal. Future research should focus on identifying and quantifying the roles of different iron species (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe0) in the Cr(VI) removal process.
2. **Explore the use of other machine learning algorithms for predicting Cr(VI) removal capacity.** The current study used the random forest algorithm, which is a powerful and versatile algorithm. However, other machine learning algorithms may be better suited for predicting Cr(VI) removal capacity, especially when the data is complex and nonlinear. Future research should compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms for this task.
3. **Develop a mechanistic model for Cr(VI) removal by Fe-BC.** The current study provides a statistical model for predicting Cr(VI) removal capacity, but it does not provide a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes. Future research should develop a mechanistic model that can explain the roles of different factors (e.g., iron content, biochar properties, reaction conditions) in the Cr(VI) removal process.
4. **Investigate the long-term stability of Fe-BC for Cr(VI) removal.** The current study did not investigate the long-term stability of Fe-BC for Cr(VI) removal. Future research should evaluate the stability of Fe-BC under different environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, redox potential) and assess its potential for long-term use in Cr(VI) remediation.
5. **Explore the use of Fe-BC for the removal of other heavy metals.** The current study focused on the removal of Cr(VI) by Fe-BC. However, Fe-BC may also be effective for the removal of other heavy metals. Future research should investigate the potential of Fe-BC for the removal of a wider range of heavy metals, including both cationic and anionic species.
