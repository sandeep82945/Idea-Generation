            "text": "Charmed hadrons have been proposed as an important probe in understanding properties as well as signatures of the deconfined medium consisting of quark-gluon plasma formed in the heavy-ion collision experiments ever since the seminal work of Matsui and Satz [1]. It is now well established that the strong interaction matter at vanishing baryon chemical potential undergoes restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry via a crossover transition since the small yet non-vanishing up and down quark masses result also in the explicit breaking of the \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (2)\ud835\udc3f \u00d7 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (2)\ud835\udc45 chiral symmetry group. This chiral crossover transition occurs at a pseudocritical temperature, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 which calculated using Lattice QCD formalism is \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 = 156.5 \u00b1 1.5 MeV [2]. Interestingly, as per observations made in the heavy-ion collision experiments, deconfinement of light-quark hadrons also occurs at \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 , and thus the relevant degrees of freedom change from partonic to hadronic in going from high temperature phase to temperatures below \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 . One of the open questions which heavy-ion experiments aim to answer is whether open-charm states melt beyond \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50, or at \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 like other light-quark hadrons. Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM) is one of theoretical tools to model experimentally measured hadron abundances, and has been extended to SHMc: which incorporates multiple-charmed states based on the observation that the production of charmed-states is strongly Boltzmann suppressed given the massive charm quark mass in relation to the relevant temperature scale, and is instead a result of the initial hard collisions [3]. Another approach to this problem is using lattice calculations of hadronic correlation functions [4],[5] to extract details of the charm hadron spectrum; or by comparing various charm cumulants calculated on the lattice with the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model predictions [6] \u2013 which are valid only in the low temperature phase \u2013 and hence considering the deviation of lattice results from the HRG calculations a signal of the open-charm sector melting [7]. Moreover, existence of the not-yet-discovered open-charm states can also be predicted by the comparison of lattice results with the HRG calculations [7]; and signals of the exotic charm states such as tetraquarks can shed light on the arrangement of quarks inside the bound states [8]."

In other words, in order to distinguish signals of multiple-charm states from \ud835\udc36 = 1 sector, a precision study based on orders of magnitude larger statistics than that has been used in the present study would be required."

Combination of the low-temperature and the high-temperature data sets, as well as the shrinkage of the yellow band representing \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 based on Reference [2], enables discerning the deviation of \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3613 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36 22 from unity right after \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 , which in turn hints at the change of the carriers of the charm degrees-of-freedom at \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 . Given the massive charm quark, ratios of the baryon-charm correlations containing one derivative w.r.t. ?\u0302?\ud835\udc35 should stay unity for the entire temperature range, and the blue-circles representing the updated \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3611 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36 13 values as well as the teal-stars depicting the 2014 HotQCD results in Fig 2 [left] are a clear testament of this fact. Fig. 2 [right] depicts the reciprocal of \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3613 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36 22 for both the updated and the 2014 HotQCD data, therefore the above discussion applies. Ratios of the baryon-electric-charge as well as the baryon-strangeness correlations separated by even ?\u0302?\ud835\udc35 derivatives should be unity in the HRG phase, but should show deviation from unity when the relevant degrees of freedom are no longer baryons. In Fig. 2 [right], unlike the red-squares which take into account one-third of the available statistics, the green-triangles representing \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4431 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc44 11 and the blue-circles representing \ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc46 31 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc46 11 with relatively smaller errors are calculated by taking into account all the available (2+1)-flavor HISQ configurations generated by the HotQCD collaboration. Although, the electrically-chargedbaryon sector as well as the strange-baryon sector start deviating from the HRG expectation slightly before \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 , the charmed-baryon sector shows clear deviation from unity right at \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50. Notice that the green-triangles and the blue-circles do not incorporate the charmed-states, therefore it would be interesting to see the role of open-charm sector in dictating the deviation of \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4431 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc44\n11 and \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4631 /\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc46 11 from the HRG expectation.\nQuantities plotted in Fig. 2 are independent of the details of the hadron mass spectrum, whereas ratios such as, \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3613 /(\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc36 4 \u2212 \ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36 13 ) \u2013 which effectively translates to the ratio of the contributions to the partial charm pressure from the charmed-baryonic and the charmed-mesonic sectors \u2013 are sensitive to the details of the hadron mass spectrum. In Fig. 3 [left], the dashed-teal curve representing the HRG calculation based on the states tabulated in the PDG record clearly misses the numerically\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 2 ) 1 9 1\ncalculated lattice results for \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3613 /(\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc36 4 \u2212 \ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc36 13 ), whereas upon including the states predicted via Quark-Model calculations [10], [11] \u2013 represented by the dashed-magenta curve \u2013 the lattice results upto\ud835\udc47 = 175 MeV can be very well described by the HRG calculation, beyond that the lattice results start to approach their non-interacting quark gas limit. Similar scenario persists for the electricallycharged charm sector tapped into using \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc36112 /(\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc36 13 \u2212 \ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc36\n112 ) in Fig. 3 [middle], where deviation from the QM-HRG starts at \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc50 . The errors of the strange-charm sector projected out using \u2212\ud835\udf12\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36112 /(\ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36 13 \u2212 \ud835\udf12 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36 112 ) in Fig. 3 [right] are not very much under control yet for the updated data and for the 2014 HotQCD data, due to lower statistics might be getting underestimated, therefore, at present it is not possible to make a precise statement about the deviation of the lattice results from the QM-HRG calculations. Nonetheless, depiction of the PDG-HRG curve missing the lattice results is quite vivid. In conclusion, all sub-figures of Fig. 3 reiterate the possibility of the existence of not-yet-discovered baryonic states in the open-charm sector as was argued in Reference [7]."
