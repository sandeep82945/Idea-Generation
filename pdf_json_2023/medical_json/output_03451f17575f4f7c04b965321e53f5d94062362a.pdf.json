    "abstractText": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common cause of vomiting in the first few weeks of life, but in rare cases, it may occur in older subjects with a major risk of delayed diagnosis and complications. We describe the case of a 12-year-and-8-month-old girl who presented to our department for epigastric pain, coffee-ground emesis, and melena, which arose after taking ketoprofen. An abdomen ultrasound showed thickening (1 cm) of the gastric pyloric antrum, while upper-GI endoscopy documented esophagitis and antral gastritis with a non-bleeding pyloric ulcer. During her hospital stay, she had no further episodes of vomiting and was therefore discharged with a diagnosis of \u201cNSAIDs-induced acute upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding\u201d. After 14 days, following recurrence of abdominal pain and vomiting, she was hospitalized again. At endoscopy, pyloric sub-stenosis was found, abdominal CT showed thickening of large gastric curvature and pyloric walls, and an Rx barium study documented delayed gastric emptying. On suspicion of idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, she underwent Heineke\u2013Mikulicz pyloroplasty with resolution of symptoms and restoration of a regular caliber of the pylorus. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, although occurring rarely in older children, should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of recurrent vomiting at any age.",

            "text": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a common condition in the neonatal period (incidence of 1.5\u20133 per 1000 live births) [1] with an unclear etiology [2]. Few cases have been described in adults, with fewer than 300 cases reported in the literature [3\u20135], while presentation in adolescence is definitely the rarest, with only 3 cases described so far [6\u20138]. In an older child/adolescent the diagnostic approach requires a high index of suspicion and exclusion of other conditions leading to gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). The work-up is based on imaging studies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Definitive treatment includes endoscopic or surgical procedures. We report the case of an adolescent girl that, after an extensive gastroenterological and surgical work-up, was successfully treated for late onset HPS. Case description A 12-year-and-8-month-old girl accessed the emergency department for a recent history of epigastric pain associated with multiple episodes of coffee-ground emesis and melena, which arose after taking two doses of ketoprofen for gingivitis. She was the second child of non-consanguineous parents, born at term from vaginal delivery (birth weight: 2810 kg). She had an unremarkable medical history, except for a bilateral inguinal hernia surgically corrected at three years of age. There was no history of cow\u2019s milk or other allergies and no exposure to long-term medications or to active or passive smoking. Initial laboratory exams documented a normal full blood count (hemoglobin levels 13.2 g/dL) and coagulation pattern within normal limits.

Apart from our case, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (hematemesis and/or melena) was reported only in another adolescent girl [8]. Interestingly, in both cases, gastritis was documented. The finding of a gastritis or peptic disease was restricted to older patients; it is therefore possible to postulate a relation between long-standing gastric stasis and a subsequent reactive inflammation. Besides our case, a Helicobacter pylori-associated pre-pyloric ulcer was described in a previous case report [7]. The peculiarity of our case was certainly the age and gender of the patient, the presentation with hematemesis, and the confounding initial endoscopic picture, which showed signs of inflammation compatible with NSAID\u2019s gastritis. Recurrence of symptoms requiring a second endoscopic evaluation led to further investigations and finally allowed us to postulate a diagnosis of HPS. In the management of suspected HPS, first-level investigations include abdominal ultrasound that can document an increased pylorus thickness (in infants: thickness > 3 mm in a transverse section [22,23] and in adults > 8 mm [24]). A subsequent step is to perform a contrast study both to rule out other conditions (malrotation, hiatal ernia) and to document the narrowing of the pyloric lumen with associated delayed gastric emptying and gastric enlargement. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to document mass lesions or ab estrinseco compressions and to definitively diagnose secondary pyloric stenosis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a fundamental step in the diagnostic algorithm of late-onset HPS for several reasons: 1. it allows a direct visualization and size estimation of the narrowed pyloric channel; 2. gastric and duodenal mucosa status can be assessed, and presence of mucosal diseases can be ruled out; 3. mucosal and submucosal biopsies can be performed; and 4. some endoscopic treatments can alleviate symptoms (balloon dilatation and/or cauterization). Definitive diagnosis of HPS can be based on first-level imaging (ultrasound is sufficient in typical neonatal cases) or require further investigations as previously indicated. In our case, we performed both CT and a barium study, and two endoscopic assessments were needed before a definitive diagnosis was made. A histological confirmation (hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the inner circular muscle layer of the pylorus, some degree of fibrosis, and reactive changes in the mucosal layer) is not always necessary, and most of the time, it is not easy to obtain a full-thickness biopsy. In terms of treatment, both endoscopic and surgical strategies have been reported in pediatric-onset HPS. We found endoscopic balloon dilatation attempted in eight cases [14,16,19,21], and in four of them, it was curative [16] with no requirement for surgical options. The treatment of choice for neonatal HPS is pyloromyotomy, which was traditionally performed under laparotomy and subsequently adapted to laparoscopy [25\u201327]. More recently endoscopic piloromiotomy has also been described [28]. In pediatric cases of lateonset HPS, pyloromyotomy was performed as the first treatment in two cases [15,18], and in two other cases [8,21], this was done after failure of less invasive treatments. Resolution was achieved in all the cases. Pyloroplasty, initially performed in 1886 by Dr. Heineke and subsequently by Dr. Mikulicz, relies on longitudinally opening the pylorus and transverse closure, and it is the most common technique for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. The surgical principle on which this technique is based, given its effectiveness, has also been adopted for the treatment of other pathological stenoses, such as intestinal strictures secondary to Crohn\u2019s disease. Given the patient\u2019s age and the thickness of the pylorus, we decided to perform an HMP with an open approach in order to have safer control of the pylorus and to be able to perform a pyloroplasty that would be effective while minimizing the risk of recurrence or iatrogenic injury. In fact, although in our center the approach of choice for pyloroplasty in the infant is laparoscopic, in this case, we felt that the lower tactile feedback of laparoscopy might expose us to a higher risk of perforation or incomplete muscle opening. HMP was\nDiseases 2023, 11, 19 7 of 8\nthe technique of choice in three other cases reported in the literature [6,17,19] and, as in our experience, was resolutive in all of them. A more invasive surgical technique was required in the remaining nine cases, including distal gastrectomy with Billroth-I or Roux-en-y reconstruction [7,14,16,20]. In three cases, this technique was performed after failure of minimally invasive procedures (endoscopic balloon dilatation, botulin injection, and laser coagulation) [7,14,16]. All the reported cases and our personal experience indicate a successful outcome of the surgical strategy with a complete restitution ad integrum of pyloric function and symptom resolution, regardless the specific surgical technique. In this setting, the choice of more aggressive surgical strategies is therefore questionable unless specific contra-indication to less invasive procedures exists or there is a specific necessity for diagnostic purposes [21] (e.g., to collect full-thickness biopsies)."
