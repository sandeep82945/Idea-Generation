    "abstractText": "A new entropy function s+ is defined in terms of the existing entropy function s\u25e6 and temperature as s+ = s\u25e6 \u2212 R lnT to facilitate the analysis of isentropic processes of ideal gases with variable specific heats. The function s+ also makes it possible to calculate the entropy changes of ideal gases during processes when volume information is available instead of pressure information and the variation of specific heats with temperature is to be accounted for. The introduction of the function s+ eliminates the need to use the dimensionless isentropic functions relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr of ideal gases and to tabulate their values. The Pr and vr data are often confused with pressure and specific volume, with an adverse effect on the study of the second law of thermodynamics. The new s+ function nicely complements the existing s\u25e6 function in entropy change calculations: the former is conveniently used when volume information is given while the latter is used when pressure information is available. Therefore, the introduction of the new entropy function s+ is expected to make a significant contribution to the thermodynamics education and research by streamlining entropy analysis of ideal gases.",

            "text": "A good understanding of the fundamentals of thermodynamics is an essential part of an engineering education for most majors. Thermodynamics is usually considered a challenging subject by engineering students because of the abstractions involved. Entropy is an essential part of this course and students often struggle with making sense of it and using it in solving practical problems. It takes time to develop an intuitive understanding of the second-law concepts of entropy, entropy generation and isentropic efficiencies since, unlike energy, entropy is something which can be created out of nowhere. As a result, mastering entropy balance on processes is considered more difficult compared to the energy balance. Entropy change calculations for real substances such as steam and the refrigerants are performed easily and conveniently by relying on the tabulated values of entropy. For ideal gases, we rely on the entropy change relations in the case of constant specific heats, and a combination of relations and tabulated s\u25e6 data when the variation of specific heats with temperature is to be accounted for. In computerized calculations, entropy changes can be calculated easily by using property relations and built-in functions. To facilitate the hand calculations for the analysis of isentropic processes of ideal gas with variable specific heats, the dimensionless functions relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr are defined, and their values are listed in the ideal-gas tables. The values of Pr and vr are determined by the numerical calculation of their defining integrals, and they have no physical meaning. Although the names and symbols imply otherwise, Pr and\nEntropy 2022, 24, 746. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24060746 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nvr have to relation to pressure or specific volume. The use of these terms adds confusion and impacts thermodynamic education negatively. Costa [1] identified and discussed the reasons why thermodynamics is viewed as a difficult subject by engineering students. A survey of college students indicated significant challenges concerning students\u2019 understanding of thermodynamic processes, the first and second laws, and entropy [2]. Mulop et al. [3] acknowledged the difficulties of students learning thermodynamics globally and presented a review and analysis of the different approaches to supporting students\u2019 learning of thermodynamics. Goyings and Arnas [4] noted some difficulties in teaching the second law and the related concepts of entropy and exergy, and proposed an alternative way of teaching thermodynamics. Yang et al. [5] proposed some methods to address some of the challenges associated with the heat transfer and thermodynamics education. Other researchers proposed alternative methods to deal with difficulties involved in learning of thermodynamics and entropy. An alternative to the Carnot\u2013Clausius approach for introducing entropy and the second law of thermodynamics is outlined, and entropy is introduced as a nonequilibrium property [6]. Acevedo et al. [7] presented a new educational package based on e-learning concerning engineering thermodynamics processes, combustion, energy, and entropy analysis. Smith [8] illustrated how thermodynamic energy, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics can be intuitively related to student\u2019s experiences. Recently \u00c7engel [9] addressed the confusion caused by the use of entropy and information interchangeably, and attempted to put things into proper perspective. There are a number of studies in the literature on the significance of using variable specific heats for the analysis of energy conversion systems involving ideal gases. Many studies indicate that the effects of using variable specific heats for the working fluid in the air-standard cycles such as the diesel cycle, the dual cycle, and the Brayton cycle performance are significant and they should be considered in cycle analysis [10\u201314]. In this paper, we introduce a new entropy function s+ to be used in entropy analysis of ideal gases when the variation of specific heats with temperature are considered. The new function is used in both the entropy change calculations and isentropic process analysis of ideal gases. The introduction of this new entropy term s+ complements the existing entropy function s\u25e6 and eliminates the need to define and use of relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr in the analysis of isentropic processes of ideal gases. First, we present the existing coverage for the entropy change and isentropic processes of ideal gases as found in most thermodynamics textbooks [15\u201317]. Then, we define the new entropy term s+ and provide a property table for air which includes the s+ values. We demonstrate the use of s+ by solving some sample problems using both the existing approach and the new approach. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the new s+ term with respect to the existing coverage of entropy."

            "text": "The coverage presented here is based on \u00c7engel et al. [15], but is also available in most thermodynamics textbooks. The differential change of entropy is expressed in terms of other properties as\nds = du T + Pdv T (1)\nds = dh T \u2212 vdP T (2)\nwhere s is entropy, u is internal energy, h is enthalpy, T is temperature, P is pressure, and v is the specific volume. Substituting the property relations du = cv dT, dh = cp dT, and P = RT/v where R is the gas constant into the equations above and integrating them for a process between states 1 and 2 gives\ns2 \u2212 s1 = \u222b 2\n1 cp(T) dT T \u2212 R ln P2 P1 (3)\ns2 \u2212 s1 = \u222b 2\n1 cv(T) dT T + R ln v2 v1\n(4)\nThe specific heats of ideal gases, with the exception of monatomic gases, depend on temperature, and performing the integrals in the equations above requires the use of cv(T) and cp(T) functions, which is not practical for hand calculations. Assuming constant specific heats at some average value for simplicity gives the following approximate relations:\ns2 \u2212 s1 = cv,avg ln T2 T1 + R ln v2 v1\n(5)\ns2 \u2212 s1 = cp,avg ln T2 T1 \u2212 R ln P2 P1 (6)\nFor better accuracy, the variation of specific heats with temperature needs be accounted for. In computerized calculations, this can be easily done by using the built-in functions for properties and numerical integration schemes. For hand calculations, it is convenient to perform these integrals once and tabulate the results. For this purpose, it is common to choose absolute zero as the reference temperature and define a function s\u25e6 as\ns \u25e6 = \u222b T\n0 cp(T) dT T\n(7)\nThen the integral in Equation (3) is simply s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1, and Equation (3) becomes\ns2 \u2212 s1 = s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1 \u2212 R ln P2 P1\n(8)\nNow, noting that cv = cp \u2212 R for ideal gases and utilizing Equation (7), the integral in Equation (4) can be expressed as\u222b 2\n1 cv(T) dT T = \u222b 2 1 [ cp(T)\u2212 R ] dT T\n= s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1 \u2212 R ln T2 T1 = (s \u25e6 2 \u2212 R ln T2)\u2212 (s \u25e6 1 \u2212 R ln T1) = s+2 \u2212 s + 1\nwhere the function s+ is defined as\ns+ = s \u25e6 \u2212 R ln T (9)\nThat is, the value of s+ of an ideal at a given temperature can be determined by subtracting R lnT from the value of s\u25e6 at the same temperature. Then, the entropy change of an ideal gas can also be expressed as\ns2 \u2212 s1 = s+2 \u2212 s + 1 + R ln v2 v1\n(10)\nThis is equivalent to\ns2 \u2212 s1 = s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1 \u2212 R ln T2 T1 + R ln v2 v1\nThe definition of the function s+ and the new entropy change relation in Equation (10) are important additions to the literature since they enable the calculation of entropy change of ideal gases when the volume information is given instead of pressure information. This way, tedious iterations are avoided in hand calculations. It is clear that s\u25e6 and s+ are functions of temperature alone, and their values are zero at absolute zero temperature. The values of s+ are calculated from its definition\ns+ = s \u25e6 \u2212 R ln T for air at various temperatures and the results are listed in Table 1 together with other properties of air.\nIt is noted that, unlike internal energy and enthalpy, the entropy of an ideal gas varies with specific volume or pressure as well as the temperature. Therefore, entropy cannot be tabulated as a function of temperature alone. The s\u25e6 and s+ values in the tables account for the temperature dependence of entropy."

            "text": "Several relations for the isentropic processes of ideal gases can be obtained by setting the entropy-change relations equal to zero. When this is done for the case of constant specific heats, we obtain\nTv k \u2212 1 = constant\nTP (1 \u2212 k)/k = constant\nPv k = constant\nIsentropic relations of ideal gases for the case of variable specific heats are obtained by setting Equations (8) and (10) equal to zero, yielding\ns \u25e6 2 = s \u25e6 1 + R ln P2 P1\n(11)\ns+2 = s + 1 \u2212 R ln v2 v1\n(12)\nThese two equations are equivalent, and one can be derived from the other. They vary only in convenience: Equation (11) should be used when pressure information is given for a process and Equation (12) should be used when volume information is given to avoid iteration. Next, we provide definitions for relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr for the completeness of the treatment. First, we rearrange Equation (11) as\nP2 P1\n= exp s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1\nR\nor P2 P1 = exp(s \u25e6 2/R) exp(s\u25e61/R) The quantity C1 exp(s\u25e6/R) is defined as the relative pressure Pr where C1 is a constant with a proper unit. With this definition, the last relation becomes\nP2 P1 = Pr2 Pr1\n(13)\nNote that the relative pressure Pr is a dimensionless quantity that is a function of temperature only since s\u25e6 depends on temperature alone. Therefore, values of Pr can be tabulated against temperature. This is done for air in Table 1. Sometimes, specific volume ratios are given instead of pressure ratios. This is particularly the case when automotive engines are analyzed. In such cases, one needs to work with volume ratios. Therefore, we define another quantity related to specific volume ratios for isentropic processes. This is done by utilizing the ideal-gas relation and Equation (13):\nP1v1 T1 = P2v2 T2 \u2192 v2 v1 = T2P1 T1P2 = T2Pr1 T1Pr2 = T2/Pr2 T1/Pr1\nThe quantity C2T/Pr or C2T/exp(s\u25e6/R) is a function of temperature only and is defined as relative specific volume vr where C2 is a constant with a proper unit. Thus,\nv2 v1 = vr2 vr1\n(14)\nEquations (13) and (14) are used for the isentropic processes of ideal gases with variable specific heats. The introduction of the function s+ renders the definitions of relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr obsolete.\nWe should note that the relative pressure and relative specific volume are useful when it comes to problems where temperatures are known but pressure or volume needs to be determined. For example, assume we need to calculate final pressure (P2) during an isentropic process when initial temperature and pressure (T1 and P1) and final temperature (T2) are given. The final pressure can be determined easily using the relation (P2/P1 = Pr2/Pr1) after reading Pr1 and Pr2 values from Table 1 at the given temperatures T1 and T2. The final pressure can also be determined using the relation [s \u25e6 2 = s \u25e6 1 + R ln(P2/P1)] after reading s \u25e6 1 and s \u25e6 2 from Table 1 at T1 and T2. This method also involves a single relation but requires more operations due to the gas constant R and the exponential term. This particular case has little practical importance since the exit pressure is normally taken to be the same for the actual and isentropic processes involving work-consuming and work-producing devices such as turbines and compressors. Next, we solve two example problems using the existing conventional approach as found in most thermodynamics books and the new approach proposed in this paper based on the new entropy term s+. The first example deals with the calculation of the entropy change of air and the second example deals with the analysis of the ideal Otto cycle that includes two isentropic processes of the air."

The only relation we have for the entropy change of an ideal gas under variable specific heat assumption is Equation (8):\ns2 \u2212 s1 = s \u25e6 2 \u2212 s \u25e6 1 \u2212 R ln P2 P1\nBut we do not have pressure information at the initial and final states.

At the beginning of the compression process, air is at 95 kPa and 27 \u25e6C, and 750 kJ/kg of heat is transferred to air during the constant-volume heat-addition process.

            "text": "The solution of the two example problems using the existing approach and the new approach clearly show the convenience of the new approach in entropy analysis of ideal\ngases with variable specific heat treatment. The advantages of defining the new entropy term s+ can be explained as follows. The concept of relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr are eliminated. Entropy is already a challenging subject in thermodynamics and forcing students to learn and use these Pr and vr functions makes it even more difficult. These functions were introduced a long time ago to allow isentropic process calculations when people did not have electronic calculators and had to use logarithmic tables or slide rulers. Table 1 is an abbreviated version of air table that exists in most thermodynamics textbooks. It includes one column for the entropy term s\u25e6 and two more columns for relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr. With the introduction of the s+ term, a new column for the s+ term is added but two columns for Pr and vr are eliminated. With this change, students can perform the same entropy change and isentropic process calculations for air under variable specific heat treatment by dealing with a smaller amount of data in the air table. In the existing system, for the entropy change of ideal gases under variable specific heat treatment, only one equation (Equation (8)) is available. If temperature and pressure information is given in the initial and final states (or inlet and exit states), the student can easily calculate entropy change using Equation (8). However, if temperature and volume information is given in the initial and final states, there is no relation available. In this case, the student needs to first find pressure information at the initial and final states and then use Equation (8) to calculate the entropy change (see Example Problem 1 using the existing approach). With the introduction of the s+ term and its inclusion in the air table, the student can directly use Equation (10) to determine entropy change, as shown in the solution of Example Problem 1 using the new approach. In the existing system, for the isentropic processes of ideal gases under variable specific heat treatment, three equations (Equations (11), (13) and (14)) are available. Equations (11) and (13) are equivalent as they are both used when pressure information is given. In the new approach, both the relative pressure Pr and the relative specific volume vr are eliminated and their values in the air table are removed. With the definition of the s+ term and the addition of its values in the air table, a student only needs two equations (Equations (11) and (12)) to solve isentropic process problems. Equation (11) is used when pressure information is given and Equation (12) is used when volume information is given. The entropy terms s\u25e6 and s+ have some physical sense but not Pr and vr functions. The change in s\u25e6 represents the temperature-dependent part of the entropy change when the pressure information is available (Equation (8)). Similarly, the change in s+ represents the temperature-dependent part of the entropy change when the volume information is available (Equation (10)). The Pr and vr functions are dimensionless quantities but the s\u25e6 and s+ terms have the same unit as entropy. An additional advantage of eliminating the relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr is that these terms will no longer be confused with pressure and specific volume as well as the reduced pressure PR and pseudo-reduced specific volume vR terms used in the compressibility factor calculations."

            "text": "The definition of a new entropy term s+ and its inclusion in ideal-gas tables along with the existing term s\u25e6 allows a convenient way of calculating entropy change of ideal gases when variation of specific heats with temperature is accounted for. It also allows the calculation of final state properties when isentropic processes of ideal gases are considered. As a result, the need for the definitions of relative pressure Pr and relative specific volume vr is eliminated and the values of Pr and vr are removed from ideal-gas tables. Entropy is viewed as a challenging subject by most students of thermodynamics. Thus, the introduction of the new entropy term s+ is expected to provide considerable convenience and ease in the study of entropy and the second law analysis of energy systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.A.\u00c7.; methodology, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; validation, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; formal analysis, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; investigation, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; resources, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; data curation, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; writing\u2014 review and editing, Y.A.\u00c7. and M.K.; supervision, Y.A.\u00c7.
