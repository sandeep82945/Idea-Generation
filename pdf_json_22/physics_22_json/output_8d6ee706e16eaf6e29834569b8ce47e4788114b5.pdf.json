Cosmological data has the sensitivity to constrain not only the energy density of DR, but also whether it is interacting. In this paper, we present a systematic study of five types of interacting DR (free-streaming, fluid, decoupling, instantaneous decoupling, and recoupling DR) and their impact on cosmological observables. We modify the Boltzmann hierarchy to describe all these types of interacting DR under the relaxation time approximation. We, for the first time, robustly calculate the collision terms for recoupling scalar DR and provide a better estimation of the recoupling transition redshift. We demonstrate the distinct features of each type of DR on the CMB and matter power spectra. We perform MCMC scans using the Planck 2018 data and BAO data. Assuming no new physics in the SM neutrino sector, we find no statistically significant constraints on the couplings of DR, although there is a slight preference for the fluid-like limit of all the cases. In the case of instantaneous decoupling DR, this limit corresponds to a late transition redshift around recombination. The \u2206Neff constraint varies marginally depending on the type of DR.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a great success because it unifies all elementary particles we have detected and passes extensive experimental tests. The SM, however, is not complete, because of several fundamental puzzles, such as the existence of cold dark matter (CDM), the Higgs hierarchy problem, and non-zero neutrino masses. Physics beyond the SM (BSM) is needed to resolve these puzzles. Many BSM models that are proposed to address these fundamental puzzles predict some light particles that behave like radiation during the epochs probed by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Since these light particles typically have negligible interactions with the SM, they are usually called dark radiation (DR). For example, some well-motivated models addressing the Higgs hierarchy problem tend to generate dark radiation, e.g., Twin Higgs models [1\u20134] and N-naturalness models [5]. On the cosmological side, the so-called \u039bCDM model describes the evolution of our universe extremely well and explains the cosmological data across many scales [6]. Despite this success, there are tensions between CMB measurements and late universe measurements. For example, the Hubble and S8 tensions, referring to disagreement between the predicted values of today\u2019s expansion rate of the Universe and matter clustering from CMB data in comparison with locally determined quantities (see, e.g., [7\u20139] for reviews on the Hubble tension and Ref. [10] for a study of the S8 tension), have attracted significant attention. Many BSM models that attempt to alleviate one or both of these two tensions involve dark radiation (see, e.g., [11\u201341]). Constraining the properties of dark radiation is therefore crucial to test BSM models that address puzzles of the SM, with a potential link to tensions in cosmological data.\nSince dark radiation has extremely weak couplings with the SM particles, it is challenging to constrain it directly from terrestrial and astrophysical measurements. Cosmological data, however, is sensitive to components that only have gravitational interactions with the SM sector. For example, CMB datasets can determine the dark matter density as well as the density of any decoupled radiation, including dark radiation. One well-known example of such decoupled radiation is SM neutrinos, which decouple from the SM bath when the temperature of the universe is around the MeV scale, much earlier than the time of CMB decoupling. Therefore, SM neutrinos only have gravitational effects\n\u2217Electronic address: thejs.brinckmann@gmail.com \u2020Electronic address: jaechang@umd.edu \u2021Electronic address: peizhi.du@rutgers.edu \u00a7Electronic address: mloverde@uw.edu\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n13 26\n4v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n2 J\nul 2\n02 3\n2 on the CMB. The current constraints from Planck collaboration on the energy density of decoupled radiation, usually denoted as Neff , assumes such radiation is free-streaming. This is because SM neutrino interactions become negligible by the epochs probed by the CMB so the particles propagate freely at the speed of light. The effect of radiation on the CMB power spectrum is to increase damping of the higher \u2113 modes, and free-streaming radiation additionally introduces a phase shift in the CMB peaks, due to the fact that free-streaming radiation propagating super-sonically pushes the SM sound horizon towards a larger scale [42, 43]. Current CMB data has the precision to resolve this damping and phase shift, so it is able to distinguish whether the decoupled radiation is free-streaming or interacting.\nGoing beyond the SM, neutrinos or dark radiation can have non-trivial self-interactions that prevent them from freestreaming. Non-standard neutrino interactions can generate strong self-interactions among neutrinos. One example is the Majoron model, where the Majoron is the Goldstone boson from lepton number breaking and is related to the generation of neutrino masses [44\u201346]. The Majoron will mediate self-interactions among SM neutrinos. If the coupling is strong, neutrinos behave as a coupled fluid and the constraints on Neff vary compared to the free-streaming case due to the distinct signatures on the CMB power spectrum [47\u201351]. More generally, these same type of models can also generate decoupling and recoupling features in neutrinos depending on the mass of the Majoron [52\u201370]. Recently, these models are studied extensively in the literature because they were also proposed to solve the Hubble tension [71\u201373]. However, it has been shown that the decoupling neutrino models do not solve the Hubble tension [64\u201366]. Separately, these models are generally in conflict with other terrestrial and astrophysical constraints because they tend to modify SM neutrino interactions significantly [74\u201377].\nMuch more freedom is allowed if we study interacting dark radiation and assume no new physics in the neutrino sector. Practically, we fix the Neff of neutrinos to its SM prediction and study constraints on additional contributions to DR (\u2206Neff). In this paper, we present a systematic study of five types of DR, categorized by the behavior of their self-interactions. We first discuss the standard free-streaming and fluid DR. We then study decoupling DR, which are light dark fermions mediated via a heavy scalar mediator. We also study instantaneous decoupling DR, that can arise from models with dark recombination or dark sector confinement. For the recoupling case, we choose to study a self-interacting scalar DR model that can originate from models with axion-like particles. There is another popular scenario for recoupling DR: the Majoron-like model with a light mediator. In this scenario, the light mediator is unavoidably generated in the process of recoupling, leading to additional signatures that we do not consider here.\nTo describe the effects of these different kinds of DR on the perturbations in the CMB we modify the Boltzmann equations to account for these interactions. Refs. [78, 79] provide the general framework to calculate the collision terms due to interactions using the relaxation time approximation. Under this approximation, the collision term is proportional to the product of thermally averaged interaction rate \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 and some numerical coefficient \u03b1, we dub the relaxation time coefficient, that needs to be calculated for different type of interactions. Refs. [78, 79] calculated the coefficient \u03b1 for the decoupling case and so far no calculation is done for the recoupling case. In this work, we, for the first time, calculate the relaxation time coefficient for the recoupling case with scalar DR. Only after this can one provide a robust map between the particle physics model parameters and the cosmological constraints. Moreover, the general expectation of the relaxation time coefficient is order unity, which is the case for decoupling DR. However, we found the relaxation time coefficient for the recoupling case is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than unity. This means the naive estimation of the time of the transition will also be modified by including this coefficient. In this paper, we provide a new definition of the transition time (redshift) by setting \u03b1\u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H instead of usual \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H. We demonstrate that this new definition gives a better estimate of the transition redshift according to numerical calculations of the DR behavior.\nWe modify the public Boltzmann solver CLASS [80\u201382] to account for each type of interacting DR, and show the changes to the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing power spectra, together with matter power spectrum. We discuss different features of these observables for each type of DR and also give an intuitive physical understanding of how they arise. After performing MCMC scans using current CMB and BAO data, we place a updated constraints on BSM models with dark radiation. We find no statistically significant bounds on the coupling constants of DR, although we find a slight preference for a late transition redshift for instantaneous decoupling DR at around recombination, and for the fluid-like limit of all the cases. The data exhibits interesting features at some specific times/redshifts in the early universe, but more constraining data is required to derive statistically significant bounds. The constraints on \u2206Neff also differ marginally under different assumptions. The rest of this paper is organized as the follows. In Sec. II, we discuss the qualitative effect of five kinds of DR on the CMB, including free-streaming, fluid, decoupling, instantaneous decoupling and recoupling DR. We also present example particle physics models of these types of DR. In Sec. III, we derive the Boltzmann hierarchy that can account for all these types of DR, under the relaxation time approximation. We calculate the relaxation time coefficient for decoupling and recoupling cases (with more details in Appendix A) and present a better way to estimate the redshift of the transition. In Sec. IV, we present the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing spectra, together with the linear theory matter power spectrum from CLASS. In Sec. V, we show the results of MCMC scans based on Planck 2018 data and BAO data. We conclude in Sec. VI. In Appendix B, we discuss a simple model for scalar DR that has\n3 the feature of recoupling DR. In Appendix C, we show more details of the MCMC scans."

            "text": "For the purpose of this work, we classify DR according to its gravitational effects on cosmological perturbations. The energy density of DR contributes to the parameter Neff, which is defined by\n\u03c1r = \u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u03bd + \u03c1DR \u2261 \u03c1\u03b3 [ 1 + 7\n8\n( 4\n11\n)4/3 Neff ] , (1)\nwhere \u03c1r denotes the energy density of total radiation in the early universe and \u03c1\u03b3 is the energy density of photons, \u03c1\u03bd the energy density of neutrinos, and \u03c1DR the energy density of DR. We fix the SM neutrino contribution to Neff to the \u039bCDM value of 3.0461 and dub the contribution from DR as \u2206Neff. That is, we define\nNeff = 3.046 + \u2206Neff . (2)\nSince SM neutrinos decouple from the photon bath much earlier than CMB decoupling, neutrinos can be treated as free-streaming for CMB analysis. The primary constraints on free-streaming neutrinos from CMB power spectrum arise from the phase shift of the peaks and suppression of high \u2113 modes [86]. If the DR is also free-streaming, it has similar effects on CMB as neutrinos, and the size of the effects is controlled by \u2206Neff. More generically, DR may have non-negligible self-interactions or interactions with other particles that prevent DR from free-streaming. For example, DR can behave as a tightly coupled fluid if interactions are always strong compared to the Hubble rate. One key difference between free-streaming and tightly coupled fluid is that tightly coupled fluid has vanishing quadrupole and higher multipoles of its density perturbation, while these moments are nonzero and have non-trivial time evolution if DR is free-streaming (see Sec. III for more detail). Because of this, tightly coupled DR generates different signatures compared to the free-streaming case with the same \u2206Neff [48].\nIn many theoretical models, DR may have additional features that are not captured in the above two cases. For example, the rate of interactions that keep DR in equilibrium are typically temperature-dependent and can therefore drop below the Hubble rate at an early time or a later time. Depending on the type of interactions, DR may be tightly coupled in the early universe and starts to free-stream later (the decoupling case), or the other way around (the recoupling case). The effects of these types of DR on observables should therefore be between those of free-streaming and tightly coupled cases with the same \u2206Neff. Moreover, due to different properties before and after the transition, decoupling/recoupling DR leaves distinct features on the spectrum that depend on the transition time. These features are discussed in detail in Sec. IV.\nIn what follows, we will identify DR by the behavior during epochs probed by CMB and large-scale structure (LSS) data.2 We classify DR into five groups according to their interactions and for each discuss examples of particle physics models that can lead to these types of DR. Note that our analysis in this paper is not restricted to the specific model we present. It can be generalized to other models where the interaction rate has the same temperature dependence.\n1. Free-streaming: This type of DR does not have any self-interactions or the interaction strength is negligible compared to the Hubble rate during epochs probed by CMB and LSS data. This kind of DR behaves identically to massless SM neutrinos. Free-streaming DR is therefore a natural consequence of BSM models involving light sterile neutrinos. Gravitational waves are another example of free-streaming DR. The effect of free-streaming DR on cosmological observables can be described by \u039bCDM model with additional \u2206Neff.\n2. Fluid: We refer to DR as a fluid or fluid-like if it has strong self-interactions (the interaction rate is always large compared to the Hubble parameter) during the whole cosmological time of interest. For example, non-Abelian gauge fields in the dark sector can behave like fluid DR [13]. Moreover, fluid DR is the strong coupling limit of the decoupling and recoupling DR mentioned below. Due to these strong interactions, the anisotropic stress and all higher multiples of fluid DR are dynamically set to zero.\n1 Note that more recent calculations prefer 3.044 [83\u201385]. 2 While big bang nucleosynthesis probes cosmic history at an earlier time than the CMB, relic abundances are sensitive to the total amount of radiation rather than the perturbations to the radiation. BBN is therefore not generically sensitive to interactions in DR.\n4 3. Decoupling: If the self-interactions among DR are mediated by a heavy mediator, the thermal averaged interaction rate \u0393 may scale as T 3 or T 5, depending on the particle nature of DR and the mediator. In the early universe, this interaction rate can be larger than the Hubble rate, which scales as T 2/Mpl, so DR interacts strongly and is tightly coupled. However, if \u0393 drops below the Hubble rate at a later time, this interaction decouples and DR starts to free-stream. We dub this case decoupling.\nMany particle physics models predict decoupling DR. To be concrete, we consider the example of DR that is an effectively massless Majorana fermion \u03c7 that couples to a massive mediator \u03d5. The Lagrangian can be written as\n\u2212L \u2283 1 2 m2\u03d5\u03d5 2 + 1 2 g\u03d5\u03d5\u03c7\u0304\u03c7, (3)\nwhere m\u03d5 is the mass of \u03d5 and g\u03d5 is the Yukawa coupling between \u03d5 and \u03c7. This Lagrangian is similar to that of Majoron models, where the scalar \u03d5 couples to SM neutrinos instead of DR \u03c7. At T \u226a m\u03d5, \u03d5 can be integrated out and we obtain an effective Lagrangian with 4-fermi interactions\n\u2212L \u2283 1 8 Geff\u03c7\u0304\u03c7\u03c7\u0304\u03c7, (4)\nwhere Geff \u2261 g2\u03d5/m2\u03d5. This term generates self-interactions among DR and the thermally averaged interaction rate scales as G2effT 5, which can lead to decoupling.\n4. Instantaneous Decoupling: This is a special type of decoupling DR, which undergoes much faster transition than the case discussed above. In this case, we can simply treat the DR as a fluid before a certain redshift zdec, which characterizes the time of decoupling, and free-streaming after zdec. Such DR can arise in models that contain a complex dark sector with a bound state that is neutral to DR. DR may decouple from the bath of the dark sector when dark sector particles form bound states, either a dark atom similar to recombination in the SM sector or dark baryons similarly to the QCD phase transition (see, for example, Atomic Dark Matter models [87\u201389] and Twin Higgs models [90]). In these cases, the interaction rate includes a factor exp(\u2212B/T ), where B is the binding energy of the dark atom or the confinement scale of dark baryons.3 This exponential factor changes decoupling qualitatively, making the duration of the decoupling transition much shorter than the standard decoupling described above. We assume dark atoms or dark baryons form only a small fraction of dark matter so we can ignore any changes to cold dark matter perturbations due to interactions between dark atoms and DR. That is, our instantaneous case only changes the behavior of \u2206Neff and no other cosmological parameters.\n5. Recoupling: Recoupling radiation free-streams in the early universe and becomes tightly coupled at a later time. In this paper, we model recoupling DR as a light scalar (\u03d5) with \u03d54 interaction\n\u2212L \u2283 \u03bb\u03d5 4! \u03d54, (5)\nwhere \u03bb\u03d5 is the dimensionless coupling constant. We present one explicit realization of such DR in models of axion-like particles (ALPs) in Appendix B. The interaction in Eq. (5) leads to a thermal averaged rate that scales as \u03bb2\u03d5T , which decreases more slowy than the Hubble rate. Therefore, this type of DR has the desired recoupling feature: the interaction rate can be smaller than the Hubble rate initially but become stronger later.\nWe note that the recoupling DR can also arise in models with fermionic DR that interact with a light mediator. For example, using the same Lagrangian in Eq. (3) but setting m\u03d5 \u2192 0, the rate of self-interactions among DR (\u03c7) can be estimated to be \u223c g4\u03d5T , which has the right T dependence for recoupling. However, the light mediator \u03d5 will be produced via \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 \u03d5\u03d5, and will come into equilibrium with \u03c7 after recoupling [67]. Therefore, the abundance and perturbations of \u03d5, which are not covered in our analysis in this paper, can potentially have important impact on cosmological observables.\nThe qualitative effects of decoupling or recoupling DR on cosmological observables can be viewed from the time dependence of their interactions. The opacity of DR provides an intuitive way to visualize the time dependence of\n3 T here is the temperature of dark radiation, which may be different from the photon temperature.\ndifferent types of interactions. We define the opacity for decoupling and recoupling DR as\nOdec(t) = 1\u2212 exp [ \u2212 \u222b t0 t \u27e8\u0393\u27e9dt ] , (6) Orec(t) = 1\u2212 exp [ \u2212 \u222b t\n0\n\u27e8\u0393\u27e9dt ] , (7)\nwhere \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 is the thermal averaged interaction rate and t0 is the time today (the exact definition of \u0393 for the models above will be given below in Eq. (15)). The opacity indicates the fraction of particles that have been scattered from the time t to the time today t0 for decoupling cases, or from the start of the universe to the time t for recoupling cases. Zero opacity means DR is free-streaming, while fluid DR corresponds to opacity being unity. For decoupling and recoupling cases, the opacity will start from 1 and evolve to 0 (decoupling) or vice versa (recoupling).\nThe opacity (Odec,rec) for three difference cases (decoupling, instantaneous decoupling and recoupling DR) is shown as a function of redshift in Fig. 1. We have chosen a step function to model Odec(z) for the instantaneous decoupling case where the transition occurs at z = 104, and selected values of the coupling constants (Geff , \u03bb\u03d5 for decoupling and recoupling cases) such that they lead to the same transition redshift zdec,rec = 10\n4 (our precise definition of zdec,rec = 10\n4 will be given later in Eq. (20)). While the instantaneous decoupling transition is much faster than standard decoupling, it is also clear from Fig. 1 that the transition of the recoupling case is slower than the decoupling case. This can be understood from the fact that decoupling rate has a stronger T dependence (\u221d T 5) than that of recoupling (\u221d T ). As we shall see, the time dependences visible in the opacity in Fig. 1 will lead to distinct signatures on observables."

            "text": "In this section, we present the Boltzmann equations relevant for self-interacting dark radiation. We use the synchronous gauge and write perturbations around a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric written as\nds2 = a2(\u03c4)(\u2212d\u03c42 + (\u03b4ij +Hij)dxidxj), (8)\n6 where \u03c4 is the conformal time and a(\u03c4) is the scale factor. The metric perturbation Hij has the following expression in Fourier space,\nHij(k, \u03c4) = k\u0302ik\u0302jh(k, \u03c4) + ( k\u0302ik\u0302j \u2212 1\n3 \u03b4ij\n) 6\u03b7(k, \u03c4), (9)\nwhere h and \u03b7 denotes the trace and traceless longitudinal part of Hij respectively. Here k \u2261 kk\u0302 is Fourier conjugate to comoving position x. We consider the phase space distribution of DR f(q,k, \u03c4), which can be decomposed as\nf(q,k, \u03c4) \u2261 f\u0304(q, \u03c4)(1 + \u03a8(q,k, \u03c4)), (10)\nwhere f\u0304(q, \u03c4) is the averaged phase space distribution and q \u2261 qq\u0302 is the comoving momentum of DR, which is related to the physical momentum p as q = ap. In this work, we demand that all kinds of DR in our analysis have nearly thermal distributions, which means the averaged phase space distribution is set to the equilibrium distribution,\nf\u0304(q, \u03c4) \u2248 f\u0304 eq(q) = Ne\u2212q/TD,0 , (11)\nwhere TD,0 is the temperature of DR today. Here, we use the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as an approximation, and the normalization factor N is chosen to match the energy density between the Maxwell-Boltzmann and BoseEinstein/Fermi-Dirac distribution: \u222b dq q3f\u0304 eq(q) = \u222b dq q3fBE/FD(q). Therefore, we will get N = \u03c04/90 for bosons and N = 7\u03c04/720 for fermions. Since the equilibrium distribution is independent of time, all non-trivial time evolution due to self-interactions is encoded in the perturbation \u03a8(q,k, \u03c4). The nearly thermal condition can be simply achieved in decoupling DR, because strong self-interactions keep DR in equilibrium before decoupling and the later evolution only generates perturbations. For the recoupling case, however, self-interactions cannot keep DR in equilibrium initially. To satisfy this condition, we assume DR is a thermal relic (like SM neutrinos) that inherits a thermal distribution from other processes. We present an example of a scalar DR model in Appendix B that predicts recoupling DR with thermal initial conditions.\nAs mentioned before, the non-trivial time evolution of f(q,k, \u03c4) appears in the perturbation \u03a8(q,k, \u03c4) defined in Eq. (10). The Boltzmann equation for \u03a8 is given as:\n\u03a8\u0307 + ikP1(k\u0302 \u00b7 q\u0302)\u03a8 + d ln f\u0304\nd ln q [ \u2212 h\u0307 6 \u2212 P2(k\u0302 \u00b7 q\u0302) 3 (h\u0307+ 6\u03b7\u0307) ] = C[f ], (12)\nwhere P\u2113 are the Legendre polynomials and \u02d9 denotes the derivative respect to \u03c4 . C[f ] is the collision term that accounts for self-interactions. The full expression of C[f ] was derived in [78, 79] and is summarized in Appendix A. Since we deal with purely relativistic particles, it is convenient to use F instead of \u03a8 in the analysis,\nF (k, q\u0302, \u03c4) \u2261 \u222b dqq3f\u0304\u03a8\u222b dqq3f\u0304 \u2261 \u221e\u2211\n\u2113=0\n(\u2212i)\u2113(2\u2113+ 1)F\u2113(k, \u03c4)P\u2113(k\u0302 \u00b7 q\u0302). (13)\nThe explicit expression for C[f ] is complicated, we then use the relaxation time approximation [91] to simplify the formula. The basic assumption is that the leading order contribution in C[f ] is linear in F : C[f ] \u221d \u2212F . It has been checked in [79] that this approximation agrees well with the exact results for the decoupling case. To our knowledge, the explicit check for the recoupling case has not been performed yet. However, for both cases the key approximations are the same: i) keeping only linear order in perturbations and ii) applying the separable ansatz: \u03a8\u2113(k, q, \u03c4) \u2248 \u2212 14 d ln f\u0304 d ln qF\u2113(k, \u03c4) [79], which can be easily derived for radiation using the separate universe argument: the only x dependence of \u03a8 is in temperature T (x). Therefore, we expect the approximation works for the recoupling case as well.\nUnder the relaxation time approximation, the full Boltzmann hierarchy for F\u2113 can be simplified as\nF\u03070 = \u2212kF1 \u2212 2\n3 h\u0307,\nF\u03071 = k\n4 F1 \u2212\nk 2 F2,\nF\u03072 = 2k\n5 F1 \u2212\n3k\n5 F3 +\n4\n15 h\u0307+\n8 5 \u03b7\u0307 \u2212 \u03b12a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9F2,\nF\u0307\u2113 = k\n2\u2113+ 1 [\u2113F\u2113\u22121 \u2212 (\u2113+ 1)F\u2113+1]\u2212 \u03b1\u2113a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9F\u2113, \u2113 \u2265 3, (14)\n7 where \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 is the thermally averaged rate for self-interactions and \u03b1\u2113 is the relaxation time coefficient. The above formula is general and can be applied to all kinds of self-interacting DR. As we discuss below, different types of interactions will lead to different values of \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 and \u03b1\u2113.\nThe thermal averaged rate for a 2 \u2192 2 self-interaction process (p1 + p2 \u2192 p3 + p4) is simplified under assumption of f\u0304(E) \u226a 1 [66]:\n\u27e8\u0393\u27e9 \u2261 1 n\u0304\n\u222b d\u03a01d\u03a02d\u03a03d\u03a04f\u0304(E1)f\u0304(E2)(1\u00b1 f\u0304(E3))(1\u00b1 f\u0304(E4))\u27e8|M|2\u27e9(2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)(p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 \u2212 p4)\n\u2248 g 2\nn\u0304 \u222b d3p1 (2\u03c0)3 d3p2 (2\u03c0)3 f\u0304(E1)f\u0304(E2)\u03c32\u21922vrel (15)\nwhere pi = (Ei,pi) is the 4-momentum of each particle and d\u03a0i \u2261 gd 3pi\n(2\u03c0)32Ei with spin degeneracy g, n\u0304 \u2261\ng \u222b d3p/(2\u03c0)3f\u0304(E) is the equilibrium number density and we use n = gNT 3/\u03c02 for massless particles. The quantity \u03c32\u21922 is the cross section for 2 \u2192 2 self-interaction and vrel = s/(2E1E2) is the relative velocity of initial particles. The matrix element squared \u27e8|M|2\u27e9 is averaged over initial and final spins of all particles, and includes a factor 1/(Ni!Nf !) that removes the double counting of identical particles, as well as a factor of Ni, because the number of initial identical particles changes by Ni units per interaction in the Boltzmann equations. Here Ni(Nf ) denotes the number of identical particles in the initial (final) states. In our case, we always consider 2 \u2194 2 process of all identical particles. Therefore, this factor becomes Ni/(Ni!Nf !) = 1/2. We will show the analytical expression of \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 for the different cases below.\nThe calculations of the relaxation time coefficients \u03b1\u2113 are shown in Appendix A, where we follow calculations in [78, 79].4 We note that for all models, \u03b10 = \u03b11 = 0 due to energy and momentum conservation.\nWe summarize the thermal averaged rate and the relaxation time coefficients for our DR scenarios below.\n1. Free-streaming: Free-streaming DR has no self-interactions, therefore we should set \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = 0 in Eq. (14). This result coincides with the Boltzmann hierarchy for free-streaming neutrinos.\n2. Fluid: Fluid DR has very strong self-interactions and is always tightly coupled. This corresponds to the limit \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 \u2192 \u221e in Eq. (14). In this limit, the term \u2212\u03b1\u2113a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9F\u2113 dominates in the time evolution, and the solution is F\u2113 \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b1\u2113 \u222b a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 d\u03c4) for \u2113 \u2265 2. This indicates that all \u2113 \u2265 2 modes will be dynamically set to zero for the\nwhole thermal history. Therefore, we can set F\u2113(k, \u03c4) = 0 for \u2113 \u2265 2 for all \u03c4 . This means that the anisotropic stress and all higher multiples of DR are always zero.\n3. Decoupling: As mentioned in Sec. II, we consider a Majorana fermion \u03c7 with a heavy scalar mediator \u03d5 as a model for decoupling DR. The Lagrangian is given in Eq. (4) with Geff \u2261 g2\u03d5/m2\u03d5 being the effective Fermi constant. We assume the mediator is heavy for the interest of cosmological evolution and thus its abundance can be neglected. The only effect of the heavy mediator is that it generates self-interactions among dark radiation. This case will lead to,\na \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = 7\u03c0G2effT 5 D,0\n576a4 , (16)\nin Eq. (14), where TD,0 is the temperature of the DR today. Note that a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 \u221d a\u22124 blows up for very small a (early times). Physically, this limit corresponds to the radiation behaving as a fluid, but to avoid numerical issues, we set a cut-off on a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9: a \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = Min[7\u03c0G2effT 5D,0/(576a4),\u039b], with \u039b chosen be 100/Mpc. We have checked numerically that the observables are not very sensitive to the precise value of \u039b chosen, for \u039b \u2265 100/Mpc. The relaxation time coefficients are \u03b12 = 1.39, \u03b13 = 1.48, \u03b14 = 1.57, \u03b15 = 1.62 in this model (see details in Appendix A). Since the \u03b1\u2113 are very similar in value and \u03b1\u2113>2 have weaker effects on observables, we simply set \u03b1\u2113 = \u03b12 (2 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 \u2113max), where \u2113max = 17 is the standard cut-off on the number of moments in CLASS. We verify that this approximation, compared to setting \u03b12 = 1.39, \u03b13 = 1.48, \u03b14 = 1.57, \u03b1\u2113(5\u2264\u2113\u2264\u2113max) = 1.62, makes a negligible effect on the CMB and matter power spectra we consider.\n4. Instantaneous Decoupling: Instantaneous decoupling dark radiation behaves like a coupled fluid at early times, and rapidly transitions to free-streaming radiation at some redshift zdec. This case mimics the transition of photons in the SM sector that behave as an interacting fluid due to interactions with free electrons, but\n4 Note we define \u03b1\u2113 with respect to the thermal averaged rate, not the rate from the dimensional analysis used in [78, 79].\n8 quickly transition to free-streaming after hydrogen formation. As mentioned before, the fluid regime can be modeled as F\u2113 = 0 (\u2113 \u2265 2), while the free-streaming case corresponds to setting \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = 0 in Eq. (14). To account for both regions, we set the initial condition for F\u2113 as F\u2113\u22652 = 0 and modify the Boltzmann equation in Eq. (14) to be\nF\u03072 =\n( 2k\n5 F1 \u2212\n3k\n5 F3 +\n4\n15 h\u0307+\n8 5 \u03b7\u0307\n) g(z, zdec),\nF\u0307\u2113 =\n( k\n2\u2113+ 1 [\u2113F\u2113\u22121 \u2212 (\u2113+ 1)F\u2113+1]\n) g(z, zdec), \u2113 \u2265 3, (17)\nwhere g(z, zdec) is a function of z and zdec, which has the feature that g = 0 for z > zdec and g = 1 for z < zdec. We choose a smooth function for g(z, zdec):\ng(z, zdec) = 1\n2\n[ tanh ( zdec \u2212 z \u2206zdec ) + 1 ] , (18)\nwith \u2206zdec = 0.01zdec. Typically, the decoupling width \u2206zdec for instantaneous decoupling cases is a few percent of zdec, but the observables we show are not particularly sensitive to \u2206zdec for values of \u2206zdec/zdec <\u223c 0.1, as we discuss in Sec. IV. We have checked that the results from Eq. (17) are almost identical to those from the general Eq. (14) with a large \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 at z > zdec and \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = 0 for z < zdec. We note that the above choice of g(z, zdec) can also model decoupling DR with heavy mediators, with the choice of \u2206zdec = 0.4zdec [66].\n5. Recoupling: As mentioned in Sec. II, we consider a light scalar with a \u03d54 self-interaction as a model for recoupling DR. This type of recoupling DR (with Lagrangian shown in Eq. (5)) can be described by Eq. (14) with,\na \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = \u03c0\u03bb2\u03d5TD,0\n23040 , (19)\nand \u03b12 = 0.188, \u03b13 = 0.294, \u03b14 = 0.356, \u03b15 = 0.395 (see Appendix A for details). Since \u0393 \u221d T and H \u221d T 2 in radiation dominated era, the self-interaction rate will be significant compared to the Hubble rate at late times, leading to recoupling. This means dark radiation is free-streaming at early times, but behaves as a fluid at late times. Similar to the case of decoupling DR, we make the approximation: \u03b1\u2113 = \u03b12 (2 \u2264 \u2113 \u2264 \u2113max) for recoupling DR, which we have checked (compared to setting \u03b12 = 0.188, \u03b13 = 0.294, \u03b14 = 0.356, \u03b1\u2113(5\u2264\u2113\u2264\u2113max) = 0.395) does not affect physical observables.\nWhile all expressions above allow for a general TD,0, for simplicity in all numerical calculations from here on we will set TD,0 = T\u03bd,0, where T\u03bd,0 is the SM neutrino temperature today.\nWe choose adiabatic initial conditions at superhorizon scales for DR perturbations assuming that DR is freestreaming [42, 128]. This initial condition provides the correct free-streaming limit when the rate \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 goes to zero. If the rate \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 is large around the initial time, i.e., the fluid limit, the higher moments F\u2113\u22652 of DR are dynamically set to zero rapidly and remain zero as long as \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 is large (for the instantaneous decoupling case we simply set F\u2113\u22652 = 0 as discussed before). As a result, other perturbations (e.g. F1 and metric perturbation \u03b7 in the synchronous gauge) will also deviate from free-streaming values and quickly approach the fluid limit of the corresponding perturbations. As long as the mode evolution begins sufficiently early (k\u03c4 \u226a 1), this is equivalent to setting initial conditions that treat DR as fluid directly. We have checked that these two types of initial conditions agree in the fluid limit.\nTo develop insight into the physical effects of DR, it is helpful to study the time dependence of self-interactions and identify the time, or redshift, of de/re-coupling transitions. The opacity given in Eqs. (6) and (7), and shown in Fig. 1, is one way of doing this and characterizes the average scattering of DR particles. The observable effects of interacting DR, however, are due to changes to the behavior of DR perturbations. Therefore, we will define the transition redshift based on the effects on DR perturbations\nAs shown in the general Boltzmann hierarchy, Eq. (14), the time dependence of self-interactions comes from \u03b1\u2113a\u27e8\u0393\u27e9. Since the dominant effect comes from \u2113 = 2 moment, we define the zdec/rec as\n\u03b12\u27e8\u0393\u27e9(z) = H(z) \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=zdec/rec . (20)\nWe note that this is different than the usual definition \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H by a relaxation time coefficient \u03b12. These two definitions are similar if \u03b12 is close to unity, as in the decoupling DR case. For recoupling DR, however, \u03b12 is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than unity and the rate has only weak z dependence (\u27e8\u0393\u27e9 \u221d z), resulting a big shift\nof the value of zdec/rec. More generally, \u03b12 might be different than one for other types of interactions, and thus a dedicated calculation of \u03b12 is needed to determine zdec/rec. To illustrate the time dependence of self-interactions on perturbations and the estimate of zdec/rec, we present in Fig. 2 the ratio of the anisotropic stresses from interacting DR and free-streaming DR, \u03c3dec,rec/\u03c3fs, where \u03c3 = 2F2. These are shown for different choices of Geff for the decoupling case and \u03bb\u03d5 for the recoupling case. Plotted are the ratios of the k = 10\u22123/Mpc modes, which are super-horizon for the times shown and clearly illustrate the timedependent changes to the behavior of DR. Fluid-like DR should have \u03c3 = 0, whereas free-streaming DR will have non-zero \u03c3. Normalizing by the anisotropic stress of the free-streaming case removes the additional cosmological time dependence.\nThe ratio in Fig. 2 has the expected behavior, evolving from 0 to 1 for the decoupling cases and 1 to 0 for the recoupling cases. The vertical grid lines show two definitions of zdec/rec: our definition \u03b12\u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H (solid) and the usual definition \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H (dashed). In the decoupling panel (a) in Fig. 2, the two definitions of zdec provide similar results because \u03b12 here is close to one and \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 \u221d z5. For the recoupling case in panel (b), however, the two definitions of zrec differ by nearly one order of magnitude. Our definition gives a better estimate of the transition time for \u03c3rec/\u03c3fs. For comparison we also plot the ratio of \u03c3dec/\u03c3fs for the instantaneous decoupling case in panel (c). For instantaneous decoupling, the interaction rate has a sharp transition around the parameter zdec in Eq. (17) with a large \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 at z > zdec and \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = 0 for z < zdec. Both definitions (\u03b12\u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H or \u27e8\u0393\u27e9 = H) therefore provide the identical results: the parameter zdec naturally denotes the decoupling redshift.\nIV. IMPACT ON OBSERVABLES\nIn this section, we discuss how the interacting dark radiation scenarios described in Sec. II affect the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra, and the matter power spectrum. While the physical effects of fluid-like, decoupling, and recoupling radiation on CMB power spectra are discussed in, e.g., [42, 47, 48, 50, 60] and on matter power spectra in [71], we will review them here for completeness. Our focus in this section is to extend the analysis of the effects of interacting DR on CMB and matter power spectra to describe the different changes made by different types of interactions. The main new results are a discussion of the differences between interacting scenarios with radiation that decouples instantaneously versus via a slower transition described by decoupling from four-Fermi interaction, or radiation that starts out as free-streaming and recouples at a later time. As we shall see, each of the five examples raised in Sec. II \u2013 free-streaming, fluid, decoupling, instantaneous decoupling, and recoupling \u2013 leave a distinct imprint on the CMB and matter power spectra.\nThe CMB and matter power spectra are sensitive to interactions in relativistic dark-sector particles because interactions change the behavior of linear perturbations in the stress-energy tensor of the DR, and the DR is gravitationally\n10\ncoupled to the photon and matter perturbations we observe in the CMB and large-scale structure. We first review physics of the two extreme cases, free-streaming and fluid DR, before moving on to discuss radiation that transitions between the two extremes.\nRadiation with frequent interactions can be characterized as fluid-like. Perturbations in a relativistic fluid are completely characterized by the equation of state w = P/\u03c1 and sound speed cs = \u03b4p/\u03b4\u03c1. For a tightly coupled relativistic fluid, these quantities take simple values, w = c2s = c\n2/3. The only non-zero quantities in the fluid stressenergy tensor are the energy density and pressure, the fluid anisotropic stress and all higher moments vanish, and fluid perturbations propagate at cs = c/ \u221a 3. On the other hand, perturbations in relativistic free-streaming particles will have the same equation of state w = 1/3, and adiabatic sound speed cs = P\u0307 /\u03c1\u0307, but perturbation fronts propagate at c. Free-streaming particles also have significant anisotropic stress and the full Boltzmann hierarchy, rather than just the continuity equation, is required to describe the evolution of perturbations. Decoupling or recoupling DR transitions between these two regimes. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the duration of the transition varies with the model. The process of decoupling from self-interactions is relatively slow in comparison with instantaneous DR decoupling and the process of recoupling is even slower.\nDifferences in the duration of the transition between fluid-like and free-streaming change the evolution of perturbations in the DR energy density. Figure 3 illustrates these differences for perturbations to the DR energy density, \u03b4DR = \u03b4\u03c1DR/\u03c1DR, with wavenumber k = 1/Mpc.\n5 The horizon-crossing transition occurs at csk\u03c4 \u223c 2\u03c0, which for this mode is around z \u223c 105, deep in the radiation-dominated era. For each DR example, we show a range of de/re-coupling times corresponding to transitions occurring prior to horizon crossing, during horizon-crossing, and after horizon crossing. If the decoupling or recoupling transition is complete prior to horizon crossing, then the DR perturbations match the free-streaming and fluid-like cases exactly and we do not show those curves. As expected, the DR perturbations that decouple instantaneously show a nearly immediate transition between following fluid and free-streaming curves. On the other hand, the decoupling radiation with slower transition begins to deviate from the fluid-like curve at an earlier time and takes longer time to approach the free-streaming solution. Finally, the recoupling DR transition is sufficiently slow that even for zrec \u223c 106 (\u03bb\u03d5 = 4.8\u00d7 10\u221211), the evolution does not fully match the fluid solution.\nThe DR perturbations couple gravitationally to the photon and matter perturbations that generate CMB and matter power spectra. Fluid DR will undergo acoustic oscillations along with the photon-baryon fluid (see Fig. 3), enhancing the amplitude of acoustic oscillations in photon-baryon fluid, and therefore CMB temperature and polarization power spectra. Free-streaming particles do not participate in acoustic oscillations, and thereby suppress the amplitude of oscillations in CMB power spectra. Additionally, since perturbations in a relativistic fluid to propagate at a speed\n5 For figures in this section we use a larger cut-off \u039b = 108/Mpc in order to achieve good accuracy at very high k\u03c4 (see discussion below Eq. (16)).\n11\ncs < c, while perturbations in free-streaming radiation propagate at c, there is a slight difference in horizon crossing times. This subtle difference, just barely visible as a shift to the right for the interacting cases in Fig. 3, induces a phase shift in the acoustic peaks in CMB power spectra. This phase shift is a particularly distinct signature that is hard to mimic via changes in other cosmological parameters [42, 48].\nFor DR that transitions between fluid-like and free-streaming during the radiation dominated era, the observables acquire a scale-dependence, with the behavior of each mode depending on the behavior of the DR around horizon crossing. For instance, photon perturbations that cross the horizon while the DR is fluid-like (k \u226b (cs\u03c4dec)\u22121 or k \u226a (cs\u03c4rec)\u22121) will have larger amplitude oscillations and no phase shift, while those that cross while the species is free-streaming (k \u226a (cs\u03c4dec)\u22121 or k \u226b (cs\u03c4rec)\u22121) will have reduced oscillation amplitude, and a phase shift with respect to the fluid-like case [47, 50, 71]. Modes that cross the horizon during the transition have intermediate behavior. This is visible in Fig. 3. Consider the decoupling case in panel (a), the curve with Geff \u2265 0.021 (zdec <\u223c 104) matches the fluid curve through horizon crossing and only later starts to depart. The curve with Geff = 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 (zdec \u223c 105) matches the fluid case as it begins to oscillate, then gradually switches to follow the free-streaming curve before the first oscillation is complete. Similar features are visible in panel (b), though the transition between fluid and free-streaming behavior is much more abrupt. The recoupling scenarios are shown in panel (c). Recoupling is so gradual that none of the curves follow the fluid one exactly, though for the earliest recoupling case, \u03bb = 4.8\u00d7 10\u221211 corresponding to zrec \u223c 106, the DR is sufficiently coupled to undergo acoustic oscillations. The impact of DR on primary CMB power spectra is plotted in Fig. 4. Each panel illustrates the changes to the CMB power spectra between cosmologies with common background evolution with same total energy density in radiation, Neff = 3.046 +\u2206Neff, with \u2206Neff = 0.5, but differ in the behavior of perturbations of the DR contributing to \u2206Neff. The different curves compare \u2206Neff = 0.5 in interacting DR, relative to \u2206Neff = 0.5 in free-streaming radiation. As expected, the amplitude of CMB spectra is enhanced at for all interacting DR and the oscillatory features demonstrate that the location of the peaks is shifted slightly. The enhancement is largest for DR that is interacting for longer, either decoupling at a later time, or recoupling at an earlier time. After matter-radiation equality, the fractional contribution of DR to the energy density drops as 1/a and whether the DR is interacting or not is increasingly less relevant. For instance, recoupling transition at z \u223c 1000, the effect of the power spectra is very small. For decoupling at z >\u223c 106 (Geff <\u223c 10\u22125/MeV2) the power spectra in this \u2113-range are indistinguishable from the purely free-streaming case.\nIn Fig. 4, the primary difference between the decoupling and instantaneous decoupling scenarios is the amplitude of the change to the power spectra: since the decoupling model begins the transition to free-streaming earlier (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), the effect on CMB spectra is smaller. As noted in [66], there is some degeneracy between the width of the decoupling transition and the amplitude of the effect. There are, however, additional features that are distinct between the two scenarios. The CMB spectra at multipole \u2113 have peak sensitivity to wavenumber k \u223c \u03c0\u2113/(2dLSS), where dLSS is the distance to the surface of last-scattering. For instantaneous decoupling at zdec = 10\n4 , the decoupling transition is visible as a relatively sharp change in the CMB spectra around \u2113dec \u2248 (2/\u03c0)kdecdLSS \u2248 2200, where kdec = 2\u03c0/(cs\u03c4dec). For the earlier decoupling redshifts this feature as at too high of \u2113 to be detectable in the foreseeable future. For the standard decoupling model the more gradual transition washes this feature out.\nDuring the radiation-dominated era, perturbations in radiation dominate the gravitational potential on large scales. The CDM perturbations are evolving in these potentials and are therefore also sensitive to the different behaviors of interacting DR. To understand how DR impacts CDM, it is helpful to look at the time average of the DR perturbations, which is a better estimate of the net source to the gravitational potential driving CDM. In Fig. 5, we show the time average (\u27e8\u03b4DR(\u03c4)\u27e9 \u2261 \u222b \u03c4 0 d\u03c4 \u2032\u03b4DR/\u03c4) of the radiation perturbations plotted in Fig. 3. It is clear that while the interacting cases have a larger amplitude around horizon crossing, at later times the free-streaming perturbations are larger and therefore source a larger gravitational potential. This means that we expect CDM perturbations entering the horizon during the radiation dominated era to be larger in cosmologies with free-streaming DR in comparison to those with fluid DR. The case where DR decouples around horizon crossing is special, the time-average of the DR is larger at horizon crossing, yet does not decrease subsequently (see Fig. 3) and at late times is slightly larger than the freestreaming case. We will see that the CDM perturbations that cross the horizon around decoupling indeed experience a slight boost.\nThe effect of DR on the CDM perturbations is illustrated in Fig. 6. Plotted is the fractional change in the amplitude of the Newtonian gauge CDM perturbation, \u03b4cdm, when \u2206Neff = 0.5 in DR is made interacting, as opposed to freestreaming. Each panel shows a range of k-values corresponding to modes that cross the horizon at a variety of epochs relative to the de/re-coupling transitions and matter radiation equality. On super-horizon scales and during the radiation-dominated era, the matter perturbation in the Newtonian gauge is slightly larger in a cosmology with interacting DR (see e.g., [42] and note that this difference disappears in the synchronous gauge). Interacting radiation experiences a larger boost at horizon crossing (Fig. 3) relative to free-streaming radiation that is transmitted to the CDM. Eventually, however, \u03b4cdm modes that cross the horizon during the radiation-dominated era with interacting DR experience suppressed growth because, time-averaged over an oscillation, the source to the gravitational potential\n12\nis smaller than for free-streaming radiation (see Fig. 5). Modes that cross the horizon near the decoupling transition experience a mixture of effects, a boost in amplitude at horizon crossing while the DR is interacting, but then a decreased subsequent decay as the radiation transitions to free-streaming before a full oscillation is complete. This is visible in the k = 0.1/Mpc mode in panel (a). A similar feature occurs as the Universe transitions to matter domination. Modes that cross the horizon during this transition may experience an initial boost due to interactions,\n13\nbut the subsequent suppression in amplitude does not occur as the radiation perturbations cease to dominate the gravitational potential. This is visible for the k = 0.1/Mpc and k = 0.01/Mpc modes in the recoupling and fluid plots in panels (b) and (c). The scale-dependent time evolution in Fig. 6 leads to scale-dependent features in the matter power spectrum. Figure 7 illustrates the k-dependent changes to the matter power spectrum when an additional DR contribution of \u2206Neff = 0.5 is interacting instead of free-streaming. For the decoupling cases, the matter power spectrum is suppressed at high k, corresponding modes that entered the horizon both during radiation domination and while the DR was interacting. In the cases where decoupling occurs during the radiation-dominated era, a peak appears around wavenumber k \u223c \u03c0/(cs\u03c4dec) corresponding to the scales that have just reached their first maximum after horizon crossing. As the Universe transitions from radiation to matter domination whether the relativistic species are fluid-like or free-streaming becomes less relevant to the evolution of the matter perturbations and the low-k matter power spectra agree for all scenarios. The time-dependent change from radiation to matter domination leads to a scale-dependent feature near keq that is qualitatively similar to the feature caused by the decoupling transition even for a fluid-like species that never decouples. Finally, the change in the power spectra for the recoupling scenarios show a mix of behavior. The highest k-modes are identical to the free-streaming case. As k decreases, they begin following the fluid curves below krec \u223c \u03c0/(cs\u03c4rec), but then agree with the free-streaming case for k \u226a keq. Finally, the duration of the de-/recoupling transition is also important. If the transition from fluid-like to free-streaming is instantaneous, a ringing feature is visible in the matter power spectrum. This occurs because modes that have entered the horizon prior to decoupling oscillate, along with the photon-baryon fluid, and an instantaneous transition will\n14\nimprint these oscillatory features on the final matter power spectrum. For the more gradual decoupling transition these features are washed out. The recoupling models we consider have very gradual transitions from free-streaming to fluid-like and overall a much smaller imprint on the matter power spectrum. We note that while we have implemented instantaneous decoupling as a transition of width \u2206zdec/zdec = 0.01 (see Eq. 18), the ringing features seen in Fig. 7 are nearly unchanged for decoupling transitions as wide as \u2206zdec/zdec = 0.1.\nThe changes to the matter power spectrum in Fig. 7 lead to similar, but less pronounced changes to the CMB lensing power spectrum. Figure 8 shows the fractional change to the CMB lensing spectum when an additional DR contribution of \u2206Neff = 0.5 is interacting instead of free-streaming. For each scenario the qualitative features are similar to the changes to the matter power spectrum, but suppressed in amplitude and sharp spectral features are washed out, due to the fact that CMB lensing at a given multipole moment depends on the matter power spectrum at a range of k. Nevertheless the suppression at high \u2113 is apparent, as is the peak in \u2206C\u03d5\u03d5\u2113 near \u2113dec and \u2113eq. The instantaneous and standard decoupling cases, however, do not have distinguishable features.\n15"

            "text": "In this section, we present constraints on five interacting DR scenarios we have discussed. For the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis we use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm6 [92, 93] of the cosmological sampling package MontePython v3.27 [94, 95], connected to an altered version of the Boltzmann Solver CLASS v2.78 [80\u201382]. We impose a Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion of R \u2212 1 <\u223c 0.01 for determining when the MCMC chains are converged.\nWe use the following dataset combination:\n\u2022 CMB: Planck 2018 CMB temperature and polarization auto- and cross-correlation, both high-\u2113 and low-\u2113 [96], and with the full set of nuisance parameters, as well as Planck 2018 CMB lensing9 [97].\n\u2022 BAO10: The Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS, z = 0.106) [99], the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS DR7 MGS, z = 0.15) [100], and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 (BOSS DR12, z = 0.38, 0.51, 0.61) three redshift bin sample [101] (containing the CMASS and LOWZ galaxy samples [102]).\nWe make the following notable modelling choices (unless otherwise specified): Three degenerate massive free-steaming neutrinos, as a good approximation to either the normal or inverted hierarchy [103], with a varying neutrino mass sum and a prior \u2211 m\u03bd > 0 eV. The neutrinos contribute 3.046 to Neff. The helium fraction is inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and we make other standard \u039bCDM assumptions, such as spatial flatness and a cosmological constant. All CMB power spectra (including lensing reconstruction) are modelled using linear theory, since we do not have an accurate non-linear prescription for the interacting DR models and all publicly available non-linear methods assume free-streaming DR. In any case, differences due to non-linear modelling are expected to be smaller than the errorbars for Planck on all scales, but this point needs to be carefully considered for future data. While we have seen in Sec. IV that DR can also impact the amplitude and shape of the high-k matter power spectrum, we do not include any datasets that probe this directly. We expect that the current bounds on \u2206Neff from CMB will be stronger than those available from, e.g. current Lyman-\u03b1 forest data [104, 105], but these signatures would be interesting to explore in the future.\nThe main results are shown in Table I and Fig. 9. In Table I, we show mean values and 68%CL intervals (unless otherwise noted) for each parameter. We also show the best-fit values for \u2206Neff and the interaction parameters as well as the minimum effective chi-squared and the chi-squared contribution from each likelihood.\nIn Fig. 9, we show posterior distributions (1-\u03c3 and 2-\u03c3 intervals as dark and light shaded contours, respectively) for our Decoupling (top left, in green), Instantaneous Decoupling (top right, in purple) and Recoupling (bottom, in yellow) cases, compared to Free-streaming (in red) and Fluid (in blue) reference cases in each subplot. As the most interesting parameters for these models, we opted to show the angular scale of the CMB, \u03b8s, the amount of DR beyond standard neutrinos, \u2206Neff, and the Hubble parameter today, H0, in addition to the relevant interaction parameters: Geff in units of (MeV)\n\u22122 and an estimate of zdec for Decoupling (see Eq. 20 and surrounding text), zdec for Instantaneous Decoupling (as a model parameter, in this case), and \u03bb\u03d5 and an estimate for zdec for Recoupling\n6 As we will see in the following, the posterior distribution for the coupling parameters show local minima and maxima, which can be difficult for the Metropolis-Hastings to properly sample and care should be taken. However, in all our cases, no parts of the coupling parameter space is ruled out with any notable significance, so we know all possible values are allowed and have been sampled, with chains moving freely through different parts of parameter space, and we can be confident no modes have been missed by the sampling algorithm. We note that problems are known to arise when modes are clearly separated in parameter space and the MCMC chains are unable or unlikely to jump from one mode to another, in which case Metropolis-Hastings is not a suitable algorithm for exploring the posterior space and alternatives should be used, such as, e.g., nested sampling algorithms. 7 Find the new MontePython v3.5 at https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython public 8 Get the most recent CLASS v3.2 at https://github.com/lesgourg/class public 9 Although the data in our MCMC runs do include the changes to the CMB lensing spectra shown in Fig. 8, we expect those features are too small to be resolved with current data and do not contribute to our constraints. 10 It is, in principle, possible that constraints using BAO data could be biased for models of self-interacting dark radiation, as these models introduce a phase shift in the acoustic peaks. However, Ref. [98] studied this problem for a number of extensions to the \u039bCDM model, including a fraction dark matter interacting with neutrinos, a model with a similar phase-shifting property. Therefore, for current BAO data combined with other probes, such as CMB in our case, models of self-interacting dark radiation is not likely to exhibit a bias in constraints derived using standard BAO likelihoods. For future data, this conclusion may be different, and it may be necessary to include BAO data, or full shape power spectrum information, in the analysis in a consistent way, or at least check that it is not a problem in a way similar to Ref. [98].\n16\n(see Eq. 20). For the set of full triangle plots see Appendix C. In the bottom right panel of each subplot, we highlight interesting points in parameter space with arrows, e.g. transition points and peaks in the 1-d marginalized posterior distribution, discussed in the following.\nDecoupling (Fig. 9, top left, green):\n\u2022 Looking at the \u2206Neff vs \u03b8s panel (first column, 2nd from the top), we see that the posterior for the Decoupling case neatly extends across the Free-streaming to the Fluid case. This comes from no strong preference by the datasets being considered for either model, so an MCMC exploration is allowed to freely vary across the full parameter space.\n\u2022 This is further illustrated by the 1-d posterior panel for log10(Geff) (bottom right), where the posterior is flat towards smaller log10(Geff) (larger zdec) values \u2013 with the free-streaming regime to the far left of the plot and smaller values asymptoting to the Free-steaming case \u2013 through intermediate decoupling redshifts, until there\u2019s a small (but not statistically significant) preference for a late decoupling beginning right around recombination, i.e. around the leftmost arrow at log10(Geff) \u2248 \u22120.15 [corresponding to log10(zdec) \u2248 3.05] and peaking at log10(Geff) \u2248 0.85 [corresponding to log10(zdec) \u2248 2.5]. We cut the posterior exploration a bit after this point, since large values of log10(Geff) (small zdec) asymptote to the Fluid case. This is because when decoupling happens sufficiently far after recombination, we are no longer sensitive to the decoupling behavior with the current datasets and the posterior would remain flat except for MCMC noise. Indeed, due to the notable decoupling width, we can understand why the posterior of the Decoupling case is not flat beyond recombination (as opposed to the Instantaneous Decoupling case), but instead peaks after recombination.\n\u2022 Considering log10(Geff) vs \u03b8s (bottom row, 1st panel) and log10(Geff) vs \u2206Neff (bottom row, 2nd panel), we see a change in the preferred values for \u03b8s when the interaction strength gets larger [larger log10(Geff), smaller zdec] and that \u2206Neff bounds are somewhat relaxed towards larger log10(Geff) values. This can be understood from the fact that interacting DR does not cause a phase-shift of the acoustic peaks like free-streaming DR, or DR with intermediate decoupling redshifts causes a reduced phase-shift. This feature brings the model into slightly better agreement with the data, allowing for a larger contribution of the species, and causes the preferred value for \u03b8s to shift towards larger values.\n\u2022 Finally, there is no notable impact on the Hubble parameter (bottom row, 3rd panel), beyond a slight widening of the posterior for a late decoupling towards the Fluid asymptote, far from enough to be relevant in terms of resolving tensions.\nInstantaneous Decoupling11 (Fig. 9, top right, purple):\n\u2022 Considering the \u2206Neff vs \u03b8s panel (first column, 2nd from the top), we see the posterior for Instantaneous Decoupling mostly tracks that of the Fluid comparison case. This can be easily understood from the 1-d posterior panel for log10(zdec) (bottom right), where we see a preference for low decoupling redshift values, asymptoting to the Fluid case once we get beyond recombination. This preference dominates the other marginalized posterior distributions. Two transition points are indicated with arrows, one at log10(zdec) \u2248 3.55, from where the preference starts to increase for lower decoupling redshifts, and one at log10(zdec) \u2248 2.8, where we are fully beyond recombination and have reached the Fluid case asymptote and the posterior flattens to just MCMC noise. There appears to be a peak (albeit not statistically significant) at log10(zdec) \u2248 3.15, so the data seems to prefer a decoupling just before recombination.\n\u2022 Considering log10(zdec) vs \u2206Neff (bottom row, 2nd panel) we see the \u2206Neff bound is significantly relaxed for late decoupling times (small zdec) from near recombination onwards, leading to larger uncertainty for the Hubble parameter (bottom row, 3rd panel). Note that since the 1-d marginalized posterior distributions for \u2206Neff and H0 include the high decoupling redshift part, the relaxed bounds are less apparent there.\nRecoupling (Fig. 9, bottom, yellow):\n\u2022 Looking at the \u2206Neff vs \u03b8s panel (first column, 2nd from the top), we see the recoupling case nearly spans the posterior space of the Free-streaming and Fluid comparison cases, like the Decoupling case. The reason is the\n11 The MCMC results in this section parameterize instantaneous decoupling as a transition of width \u2206zdec = 0.01zdec, as discussed in Sec. II. We have, however, checked that our parameter constraints are virtually unchanged for a decoupling width of \u2206zdec = 0.1zdec.\n17\nsame as before, because we have a mostly unconstrained parameter space, with a neat transition between the two asymptotes. Indeed, considering the 1-d posterior panel for log10(\u03bb\u03d5) (bottom right) we see a mostly flat posterior, with a small increase in probability starting from log10(\u03bb\u03d5) \u2248 \u221211.4 [corresponding to log10(zrec) \u2248 3.7], indicated by an arrow, towards larger values of the coupling strength, corresponding to an earlier recoupling.\n18\nInterestingly, there appears to be a small peak (not statistically significant) at intermediate recoupling redshifts, around log10(\u03bb\u03d5) \u2248 \u221211.0 [corresponding to log10(zdec) \u2248 4.6], indicated by a second arrow, but we clearly need more sensitive datasets to constrain this model.\n\u2022 Considering the other bottom row panels, we see a similar shift in \u03b8s (first panel) as we did for the Decoupling case. This is not surprising, larger values of the coupling parameters in both examples, corresponding to earlier recoupling or later decoupling, asymptote to the Fluid case whereas the late recoupling, or early decoupling, models asymptote to the Free-streaming case. In the second of the bottom panels, we see the bound on \u2206Neff is relaxed for models recoupling early or at intermediate redshifts, while late recoupling bounds are similar to the Free-streaming bounds. Finally, for the Hubble parameter (third panel), we see a slight relaxation of the confidence interval compared to the Free-streaming asymptote, but not enough to play a role in resolving cosmological tensions.\nIt is worth remembering that our choice for how to implement the neutrino mass sum, \u2211\nm\u03bd , impacts the bounds on \u2206Neff, as there\u2019s a direct correlation between neutrino mass sum and allowed values of \u2206Neff. In many works, the neutrino mass sum is taken to be fixed (a common choice is around the minimal allowed value for a normal hierarchy neutrino configuration with two low mass and one more massive neutrino, \u2211 m\u03bd = 0.06 eV), but the absolute scale of the neutrino mass sum is not known, only the mass difference between states. To reflect this uncertainty, we allow the neutrino mass sum to vary in our main analysis, which impacts bounds on \u2206Neff compared to fixing the neutrino mass sum, as shown in Tables II (fixed neutrino mass sum) and III (varying neutrino mass sum).\nFor the fixed neutrino mass sum comparison in Table II, we limit the scope to only the Free-streaming and Fluid reference cases, as they can be considered the boundary cases for self-interacting dark radiation. In this case, we consider \u2211 m\u03bd = [0, 0.06, 0.11] eV to cover massless neutrinos, minimum normal hierarchy mass in two configurations (degenerate masses, denoted \u201cdeg\u201d, and a normal hierarchy approximation with two massless and one massive neutrino, denoted \u201c2 massless\u201d), and minimum inverted hierarchy mass (only degenerate masses).\nIn Table III, we allow the neutrino mass sum to vary, with two common choices, one remaining agnostic about the mass of cosmological neutrinos freely varying the neutrino mass sum \u2211 m\u03bd > 0 (acknowledging that new physics\ncould allow for different \u2211\nm\u03bd in cosmology compared to that from terrestrial measurements, see, e.g., [107\u2013115]) and\n19\nthe other imposing a minimal allowed neutrino mass sum roughly corresponding to the minimal mass sum allowed in a normal hierarchy configuration with \u2211 m\u03bd > 0.06 eV. In both cases, we consider degenerate massive neutrinos, as the difference compared to more realistic configurations is very small [103].\nWe find differences of order 10% in the bounds on \u2206Neff for common choices used in the literature for how to treat neutrino masses, a difference that increases for less common choices. For simplicity, throughout the paper we assumed the standard neutrinos behave as expected with a contribution to Neff of 3.046, but somewhat different results might be obtained if this assumption is relaxed and all of Neff is varied.\nAs a side note, if a very large neutrino mass sum were to be detected from cosmology, \u2206Neff bounds would dramatically change. This has been hinted at by some recent analyses, e.g. an analysis that factors out the Planck lensing anomaly12 found \u2211 m\u03bd = 0.51 +0.21 \u22120.24 eV at 68% CL from a combination of BOSS and Planck [117] (see also the ACT DR4+WMAP results [118], as well as Ref. [119], for similarly large neutrino mass sum bounds from cosmology when avoiding the Planck lensing anomaly). As a rudimentary check, fixing \u2211 m\u03bd = 0.5 we find a Free-streaming \u2206Neff < 0.738 and a Fluid \u2206Neff < 0.727 at 95%CL, wildly different from conventional results. Of course, a proper analysis with the full lensing-anomaly treated likelihoods and varying neutrino mass sum should be conducted, but if a large neutrino mass were to be a reality, all Neff bounds would change accordingly."

            "text": "Dark radiation commonly arises in BSM scenarios and may contribute a detectable level of radiation density in the Universe in addition to photons and neutrinos. This contribution is typically parametrized with \u2206Neff and can be constrained by cosmological data. Yet, the signatures of DR can vary depending on the nature of DR and the parameter \u2206Neff, which solely characterizes the energy density, is insufficient to capture the full range of scenarios. More generally, DR will have perturbations, along with the SM particles, and their energy density, pressure, and anisotropic stress evolve differently depending on whether the DR is interacting with itself or another constituent. In general, interaction rates evolve differently from the Hubble parameter, and dark radiation can decouple or recouple from interactions during cosmic history. In this paper, we explore the cosmological signatures of and constraints on DR with interactions that modify the time-dependence of the sound speed and anisotropic stress of DR and thereby leave distinct signatures in cosmological observables.\nWe classify DR into five interaction types: free-streaming, fluid-like, decoupling, instantaneous decoupling, and recoupling. Free-streaming and fluid-like DR are the usual scenarios in which radiation is either non-interacting or interacting for the whole observable cosmic history. The free-streaming case is part of standard cosmological analyses (e.g. [6]) and the fluid-like case have been studied by, e.g. [48, 51]. Decoupling DR is the case where its self-interaction is through a heavy mediator, so that interactions cease and radiation transitions from fluid-like to free-streaming, as with SM neutrinos. In this case, the decoupling transition happens smoothly as \u0393/H \u221d T 3. In contrast, instantaneous decoupling occurs suddenly due to the presence of a heavier or bound state that exponentially suppresses the scattering rate, similar to SM hydrogen recombination. Recoupling DR arises in scenarios with a light mediator or a renormalizable self-interaction term such as \u03d54 theory. In this case, the DR is initially free-streaming but interactions change the behavior of DR to behave more like a fluid (for decoupling and recoupling types of\n12 See, e.g., Refs. [6, 116] for discussions on the Planck lensing anomaly.\n20\nmodels, see, e.g., [47, 50, 60, 71]). These scenarios are described in Sec. II. We implemented the DR scenarios above in the Boltzmann equations, using the relaxation time approximation to include the collision terms in the Boltzmann hierarchy. The interaction terms include the thermal averaged interaction rate and the relaxation time coefficient, which are carefully calculated in this work for different interaction benchmarks. Since the relaxation time coefficients depend on multipole \u2113, the time at which moments in the Boltzmann hiearchy transition between fluid-like and freestreaming also depends on \u2113. We define decoupling and recoupling with respect to the \u2113 = 2 moment in the Boltzmann hierarchy, related to the anisotropic stress, and provide a precise relation between parameters in the DR Lagrangian and the decoupling or recoupling redshift. Our approach is described in Sec. III and the details of calculations are given in Appendix A.\nWe have shown that the DR scenarios lead to distinct signatures on CMB and matter power spectra. These signatures, along with a detailed discussion of the physical mechanisms, are presented in Sec. IV. A summary of the changes to CMB power spectra is in Fig. 4, on the matter power spectra in Fig. 7, and on CMB lensing in Fig. 8. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of the matter power spectrum to the duration of the decoupling transition, visible by comparing panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 7. We anticipate that for currently allowed values of \u2206Neff, the signature in the matter power spectrum is too small to be detected. Yet, it would be interesting to explore whether these features can be exploited to detect or constrain DR with future large-scale structure datasets. We leave this to future work.\nWe derive MCMC constraints from Planck 2018 CMB data and BAO data on these DR scenarios, using the cosmological sampling package MontePython interfaced with a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS, in which the Boltzmann hierarchy with the relaxation time approximation is implemented for each of our interacting DR cases. The 1- and 2-d marginalized posterior distributions for each of our cases are shown for select parameters in Fig. 9 and for the full cosmological parameter space in Appendix C. In Table I, we show bounds for each of our cosmological parameters along with information on the best-fitting model. We find no statistically significant bounds on the coupling constants of DR, although we find a slight preference for a late transition redshift for instantaneous decoupling DR at around recombination, and for the fluid-like limit of all the cases. The data exhibits interesting features at some specific times/redshifts in the early universe, but more constraining data is required to derive statistically significant bounds. The constraints on \u2206Neff differ marginally for the different cases, but only at the order of about 5\u2212 10%. We note that the models of interacting DR considered here do not help resolve the H0 and \u03c38 tensions, as Planck CMB bounds on \u2206Neff do not allow for a signifcant deviation from the standard prediction, a situation that is unchanged by the presence of interactions, and therefore the models under consideration are unable to alleviate these cosmological tensions. Finally, in Tables II and III, we consider how our prior choice for the neutrino mass sum affects bounds on \u2206Neff for our DR cases, finding a difference of order 10%, comparable or larger than the differences due to interactions, highlighting the importance of being clear on prior assumptions when reporting results.\nAlthough current data are only able to provide hints towards preferred couplings of interacting DR, without placing statistically significant bounds, future experiments and surveys will be able to detect the small scale signatures of interacting DR discussed in Sec. IV. Upcoming CMB experiment Simons Observatory [120], the future CMB-S4 experiment [121], and possibly CMB-HD [122] will delve into increasingly smaller scales of the CMB anisotropies, potentially bringing signatures of interacting radiation within reach (compare to signatures of interactions seen in primary CMB in Fig. 4, increasing significantly towards smaller scales, as well as CMB lensing in Fig. 8). These future datasets will simultaneously aid in detecting novel signatures of interactions and constraining Neff to much better precision, with nearly an order of magnitude improvement expected by CMB-S4 over current constraints. Concurrently, data from current and near-term galaxy surveys such as DESI [123], Euclid [124], the Roman Telescope [125], and the Rubin Observatory [126] will dramatically improve our measurements of the linear-theory matter power spectrum. The signatures of interacting radiation shown in Fig. 7 present an interesting target worthy of further exploration. In the longer term, gravitational waves present a clean and complementary probe of the DR interaction history [127]. In summary, the prospects of confirming or ruling out non-standard interactions in the neutrino and DR sector are excellent."

Again, \u03b10,1 = 0 due to energy and momentum conservation. Note that \u03b12 for the recoupling case is much smaller than unity.

            "heading": "Appendix B: A model for self-interacting scalar dark radiation",
            "text": "Here we present a model for dark radiation that consists self-interacting light scalars. We consider axion-like particles (ALP) in the dark sector, denoted as \u03d5, which are Goldstone bosons from a global dark U(1) symmetry breaking. Below the spontaneously breaking scale f , we demand the leading coupling between \u03d5 and other fields be \u03d5fGDG\u0303D, where GD is the field strength of a dark SU(N) gauge field. This coupling can be rewritten as a total derivative. Therefore, the ALP mass is protected by a shift symmetry at perturbative level and can be naturally light. After the dark SU(N) field confines, \u03d5 acquires a potential non-perturbatively as\nL\u03d5 \u2283 \u039b4 cos ( \u03d5\nf\n)\n\u2248 \u039b4 \u2212 \u039b 4\n2f2 \u03d52 +\n\u039b4\n24f4 \u03d54\n\u2248 \u039b4 \u2212 m2\u03d5 2 \u03d52 + m2\u03d5 24f2 \u03d54 (B1)\nwhere \u039b characterizes the energy scale of the confinement. In the second and third lines of the above equation, we neglect terms from the expansion that contain \u03d5n, (n > 4), because their effects will be suppressed by fn\u22124. The third line of Eq. (B1) shows the ALP model predicts a naturally light scalar field with m\u03d5 \u2261 \u039b2/f and a \u03bb\u03d524 \u03d5 4 interaction with \u03bb\u03d5 \u2261 m2\u03d5/f2. To check whether the ALP model can be a model for the recoupling dark radiation, we need to demand i) \u03d5 is a thermal relic (similar to SM neutrinos) during the cosmic history relevant for CMB measurements, and ii) it has the correct self-interaction strength for recoupling near recombination. Since we are interested in the case of low f and \u039b (see below), \u03d5 and SU(N) gauge fields are in thermal equilibrium for TD > \u039b . The first condition can be achieved when TD drops below \u039b, where a confinement phase transition occurs in dark SU(N) theory. Since \u03d5 is the only light particle after the phase transition, all SU(N) gauge degrees of freedom will eventually convert into \u03d5. This conversion is fast given the low f and \u039b we consider, so it is plausible to treat \u03d5 as a thermal relic when TD <\u223c \u039b. Moreover, \u039b needs to be high enough that \u03d5 remains as a thermal relic during the history relevant for CMB measurements. This translates to a constraint of \u039b >\u223c O(100) eV, where O(100) eV roughly corresponds to the highest temperature scale that current CMB data can probe.\nFor the second condition, we need the coupling strength of the order of \u03bb\u03d5 \u223c 10\u221212 to achieve recoupling around z \u223c 103 (see discussion in Sec. II). Given that m\u03d5 and f are correlated for fixed \u03bb\u03d5 (\u03bb\u03d5 \u2261 m2\u03d5/f2), an arbitrary small m\u03d5 leads to too small f and \u039b, violating the first condition. Assuming the temperature of the dark sector is roughly the temperature of SM neutrino bath (TD \u223c T\u03bd), we need m\u03d5 <\u223c 0.1 eV to ensure \u03d5 remains as radiation before recombination. Saturating m\u03d5 \u223c 0.1 eV, we can infer that f \u223c 0.1 MeV and \u039b \u223c 100 eV. Therefore, the ALP model satisfies both conditions and we use it as a benchmark model for recoupling dark radiation."
