Elucidation of UA's Mechanism of Action at the Molecular Level: Although the paper outlines UA's broad pharmacological activities, detailed mechanistic studies on how UA interacts with specific NRs at the atomic or molecular level are still needed. Research could focus on high-resolution structure determination of UA bound to different NRs using techniques like X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM. This can help in the design of UA derivatives with enhanced efficacy and specificity.

Development of UA Derivatives for Improved Bioavailability and Efficacy: UA's pharmacological potential is clear, but like many natural compounds, its bioavailability might be limited. Future research can focus on synthesizing UA derivatives or formulating drug delivery systems that improve its bioavailability, stability, and tissue targeting. Such studies could lead to more effective UA-based therapeutics with lower required doses and reduced side effects.

Comparative Studies on UA Effects Across Different Cancer Types: While the review highlights UA's antiproliferative effects against specific cancers, comprehensive studies comparing its effects across a wide range of cancer types are needed. This includes detailed analyses of UA's action on cancer stem cells and its potential to overcome drug resistance in chemotherapy-resistant cancer lines.

Investigation into UA's Role in Aging and Longevity: Given UA's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aging properties, further research into how it influences longevity and aging processes could be valuable. Studies could explore UA's effects on age-related markers, senescence, and longevity pathways in model organisms ranging from nematodes and fruit flies to mammals.

Clinical Trials to Validate UA's Therapeutic Potential: Despite the promising in vitro and in vivo data, there is a significant gap in clinical evidence for UA's efficacy in humans. Designing and conducting well-structured clinical trials to test UA's therapeutic benefits in treating metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancers could validate its use as a therapeutic agent. These trials should aim to determine optimal dosing, assess long-term safety, and evaluate the efficacy of UA alone or in combination with existing treatments.
