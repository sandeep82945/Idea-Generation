1. **Investigate the effects of different biochar feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions on the molecular properties of biochar and its impact on biogas production.** This could involve studying the relationship between the feedstock composition, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time on the surface area, porosity, functional groups, and other molecular properties of biochar. The research could also examine how these properties influence the adsorption capacity, microbial activity, and biogas yield in anaerobic digestion systems.


2. **Explore the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of biochar on biogas production.** This could involve conducting detailed studies to understand how biochar properties, such as surface chemistry, porosity, and heavy metal content, affect microbial activity, fermentation pathways, and the production of inhibitory compounds. The research could also investigate the role of biochar-microbe interactions and the impact of biochar on the microbial community structure and diversity.


3. **Develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of biochar on biogas production.** This could involve investigating the use of pre-treatments, such as chemical or thermal activation, to modify the surface properties of biochar and improve its compatibility with microorganisms. The research could also explore the use of co-digestion with other substrates, such as manure or food waste, to balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and reduce the potential for negative effects.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of biochar application on biogas production and soil health.** This could involve conducting field trials or long-term laboratory experiments to assess the impact of biochar addition on biogas production, soil fertility, and microbial community dynamics over time. The research could also examine the potential for biochar to accumulate in the soil and its effects on soil properties and ecosystem functioning.


5. **Explore the potential of biochar for carbon capture and storage in anaerobic digestion systems.** This could involve investigating the ability of biochar to sequester carbon dioxide produced during anaerobic digestion and its potential for use as a soil amendment to enhance carbon sequestration. The research could also examine the stability of biochar-derived carbon in the soil and its contribution to long-term carbon storage.
