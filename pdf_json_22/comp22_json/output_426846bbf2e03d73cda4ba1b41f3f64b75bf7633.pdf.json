    "abstractText": "We consider the incompressible Euler equations in the half cylinder R>0 \u00d7 T. In this domain, any vorticity which is independent of x2 defines a stationary solution. We prove that such a stationary solution is nonlinearly stable in a weighted L norm involving the horizontal impulse, if the vorticity is non-negative and non-increasing in x1. This includes stability of cylindrical patches {x1 < \u03b1}, \u03b1 > 0. The stability result is based on the fact that such a profile is the unique minimizer of the horizontal impulse among all functions with the same distribution function. Based on stability, we prove existence of vortex patches in the half cylinder that exhibit infinite perimeter growth in infinite time.",

Theorem 1.1 is analogous to that of radial and monotone solution in R2 from the recent work [12].\nTheorem 1.1. For any constants L,M > 0, there exists a constant C1 = C1(L,M) > 0 such that if \u03b6 = \u03b6(x1) is in L \u221e(S+), non-negative, non-increasing, and compactly supported with\nsupp (\u03b6) \u2282 {x1 < L}, \u2225\u2225\u03b6\u2225\u2225\nL\u221e(S+) \u2264M, (1.2)\nthen for any non-negative \u03c90 \u2208 L\u221e(S+) with compact support, the corresponding solution \u03c9(t) of (1.1) satisfies\nsup t\u22650\n\u2225\u2225\u03c9(t)\u2212 \u03b6\u2225\u2225 J1(S+) \u2264 C1 [\u2225\u2225\u03c90 \u2212 \u03b6\u2225\u2225 12J1(S+) + \u2225\u2225\u03c90 \u2212 \u03b6\u2225\u2225J1(S+)]. (1.3)\nRemark 1.2. The non-negativity of \u03c90 is necessary in our proof for technical reasons. One of the reasons is that the rearrangement of a function, which is frequently used in our proof, cannot be defined on the infinite domain S+ if the function contains a negative part. On the other hand, boundedness and compact support of \u03c90 are imposed to apply the standard global well-posedness theory as well as to ensure that J1-norm of \u03c90 is finite.\nThis can be considered as an extension of the work by Marchioro\u2013Pulvirenti [20], where they considered the Euler equations (1.1) in a bounded strip while we consider the equations in the infinite strip. More precisely, the result in [20, Theorem 1] shows the explicit L1\u2212stability of the form (1.3) of the x2\u2212independent and monotone \u03b6 \u2208 L\u221e in a bounded strip {x1 < L}, where C1 depends on the domain size L and the L\u221e\u2212norm of the initial perturbed data \u03c90. By imposing the weight 1 + x1 on the L1\u2212norm, we were able to remove the dependence on\n\u2225\u2225\u03c90\u2225\u2225L\u221e and to extend the domain into the infinite strip {x1 <\u221e}. This stability result is used in showing our next result, which deals with the perimeter of a smooth vortex patch. In R2, if the initial data is given as a patch \u03c90 = 1\u21260 for some open set \u21260 \u2282 R2, then the unique solution is of the form \u03c9(t) = 1\u2126t , where \u2126t = \u03a6(t,\u21260). Here, \u03a6(t) is the flow map, which is the unique solution of the ODE\nd dt \u03a6(t, x) = u\n( t,\u03a6(t, x) ) , \u03a6(0, x) = x, (1.4)\nwhere u(t) is determined from \u03c9(t) by the Biot\u2013Savart law in R2, given as u(t) = \u2212 12\u03c0 x\u22a5\n|x|2 \u2217 \u03c9(t). Moreover, it is well known if the boundary \u2202\u21260 of \u21260 is connected and C \u221e\u2013smooth, then \u2202\u2126t is connected and C \u221e\u2013 smooth as well ([5, 4, 23]). It can be shown that the same holds for open patches with smooth boundaries in S+, by adapting the proof of Kiselev\u2013Ryzhik\u2013Yao\u2013Zlato\u030cs [17].\nRecently, it was shown in [10] that there exists a patch on R2 that has perimeter growth for finite time. The following theorem shows the existence of a patch on S+ where the growth of the perimeter is infinite in infinite time (see Figure 1).\nTheorem 1.3. There exists a constant C2 > 0 and a bounded, open set \u21260 \u2282 S+ with its smooth, connected boundary \u2202\u21260 \u2282 S+ := {x1 \u2265 0} that satisfies\nlength(\u2202\u21260) \u2264 20, \u2202\u21260 \u2229 \u2202S+ 6= \u2205,\nsuch that for any t \u2265 0, the solution 1\u2126t of (1.1) with the initial data 1\u21260 satisfies\nlength(\u2202\u2126t) \u2265 C2t, \u2200t \u2265 0.\nHere, the boundary \u2202S+ of S+ is the circle {0} \u00d7 T.\nIn an annulus, suggested by Nadirashvili [22], two points each on the inner circle and the outer circle possess different angular velocities for all time. This difference leads to the growth of length of the curve on the annulus that connects the two points. Theorem 1.3 shows that such growth of length can occur in an unbounded space having one connected boundary component as well.\nWan\u2013Pulvirenti [25] showed a L1\u2212stability of a disc patch 1Br , r > 0 among patches in a bounded disc BR, R \u2265 r. More generally, [20] proved a L1\u2212 stability of a radially symmetric and monotone solution among solutions in L\u221e(BR), R > 0 as well. Sideris\u2013Vega [24] presented a L\n1\u2212stability of a disc patch 1Br , r > 0 among patches with a compact support in R2. The most recent work [12] extended the work in [20] to show a weighted L1\u2212stability of a non-negative, radially symmetric, and non-increasing solution among non-negative solutions in L\u221e(R2). In addition, [1] proved an orbital stability, admitting translation, of the Lamb dipole by using a variational method. [6] showed a stability, up to translation, of the Hill\u2019s spherical vortex among non-negative axi-symmetric solutions in 3D. [9] presented an orbital stability in L1 of m\u2212fold Kelvin waves for symmetric perturbations and constructed an m\u2212fold Kelvin wave which shows perimeter growth for sufficiently long finite time.\nIn the full strip S, [3] showed a stability of a cylindrical patch 1{|x1|<L} for sufficiently large L > 2. The existence and uniqueness result in the strip is based on the work from [16], in which it characterized various properties of a solution with bounded velocity and vorticity. [7] estimated the upper bound of the horizontal support size of a non-negative solution in L\u221e(S) with compact support in S. Bedrossian\u2013Masmoudi [2] proved asymptotic stability and inviscid damping of Couette flow in S. Zillinger [27] showed linear inviscid damping for monotone shear flows. Ionescu\u2013Jia [15] showed inviscid damping of a shear flow in a bounded cylinder [0, 1]\u00d7T, along with that the support of the vorticity perturbation stays in the cylinder for all t \u2265 0.\n[22] proved that in an annulus, there exists a smooth solution of (1.1) which is C1\u2212unstable among smooth solutions. [10] constructed a patch in R2 in which the perimeter of the patch boundary grows for sufficiently large finite time. [11] constructed a solution, close to Lamb dipole, with compact support in R2 which shows\ngrowth of its gradient and support size for infinite time. [8] proved the existence of a solution that is close to the Hill\u2019s vortex in L1(R3), its support being close to that of the Hill\u2019s vortex as well, which exhibits filamentation for infinite time. This, as corollaries, produced infinite growth of perimeter and gradient as well."

            "text": "In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we needed to reproduce the main ideas that were used in the proof of [12, Lemma 3.3], such as the conservation of the measure of level sets, the total mass, the angular impulse, and properties of symmetric decreasing rearrangement, including the rearrangement estimate established in [20]. We use the conservation of the level set measure, the total mass, and the horizontal impulse. The last quantity corresponds to the angular impulse in R2. Then we define the rearrangement on S+ to be x2\u2212independent so that it is defined in the same way the symmetric decreasing rearrangement is defined on R2. This implies that the nonexpansivity property and the rearrangement estimate on R2 can be reproduced to S+. In addition, we use the idea of cutting off a non-negative function by a certain height. One of the important property of the cut-off operator \u0393\u03b1, \u03b1 > 0, which is defined in section 2.4, is that it commutes with the rearrangement operator \u2217:\n(\u0393\u03b1f) \u2217 = \u0393\u03b1(f \u2217),\nfor any non-negative f \u2208 L1. The use of this cut-off operator makes our stability result be independent of the L\u221e\u2212norm of \u03c90. Remark 1.4. Using the conservation of the total mass and the horizontal impulse, we can reproduce the simplest stability of the stationary patch 1D of the unit disc D= B1(0) in R2 from [24] and Dritschel [13] to the stationary patch 1\u2126 with\n\u2126 := {x1 < 1} \u2282 S+ :\u222b \u2126t4\u2126 |1\u2212 x1|dx = \u222b \u2126t\\\u2126 (1\u2212 x1)dx+ \u222b \u2126\\\u2126t (x1 \u2212 1)dx = \u222b \u2126t (1\u2212 x1)dx+ \u222b \u2126 (x1 \u2212 1)dx\n= \u222b \u21260 (1\u2212 x1)dx+ \u222b \u2126 (x1 \u2212 1)dx = \u222b \u212604\u2126 |1\u2212 x1|dx, t \u2265 0.\nHowever, note that the weight |1\u2212 x1| vanishes when x1 = 1; this norm is not strong enough to control the flow map pointwise.\nWe move on to Theorem 1.3. The idea in [10] was using the L1\u2212stability of the circular patch 1D and its corresponding velocity uD, which can be derived explicitly. The fact that the Biot\u2013Savart kernel K in R2 is roughly 1|x| was used to show that the difference between velocities u\u2126t of 1\u2126t and uD of 1D is uniformly bounded by the L1\u2212difference of 1\u21260 and 1D up to the power of 14 . The method used in the proof required two points that are located on \u2202\u21260 in the initial time and move along the flow map to have certain amount of radial distance with each other. If that is the case, then the tangential velocities of those two points differ. This difference creates the perimeter growth of the boundary. However, for infinite time, there is no reason for the radial distance in the future to be nonzero, since the radial velocity of each point need not vanish. Thus, in this method, the perimeter growth of \u2202\u2126t is limited to finite time where the distance is kept. This is why we use a different approach in Theorem 1.3.\nSimilarly as in R2, the unique solution of (1.1) with patch-type initial data \u03c90 = 1\u21260 is the patch \u03c9(t) = 1\u2126t , where \u2126t is the image of \u21260 through the flow map. As a way of understanding this patch 1\u2126t , we can go through the following process. First, we periodically extend the velocity field u(t) of 1\u2126t to the half plane R2+ := R>0\u00d7R. Then, denoting this extension as uext(t), we generate the flow map \u03a6(t) in R2+ from uext(t). Then we project \u21260 \u2282 S+ through the flow map \u03a6(t) to obtain the image \u03a6(t,\u21260) = \u03a6t(\u21260). Finally, \u2126t \u2282 S+ is obtained by projecting \u03a6t(\u21260) onto S+ via the map Q : R2+ \u2212\u2192 S+, which is defined as\nQ(x1, x2) := (x1, x2 \u2212 2n\u03c0),\nfor some n \u2208 Z that satisfies x2 \u2208 [(2n\u2212 1)\u03c0, (2n+ 1)\u03c0). Such a framework is depicted in Figure 2.\nWe require the boundary \u2202\u21260 of the initial patch \u21260 to be connected and to have at least one point that intersects with \u2202S+ = {0} \u00d7 T, the boundary of the domain S+ (cf. the boundary \u2202\u2126 = {0, 1} \u00d7 T of the (steady) set \u2126 is not connected.). Then we use the fact that the point stays on the x2\u2212axis \u2202R2+ along the flow map, that is, \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) \u2229 \u2202R2+ 6= \u2205 for any t \u2265 0. This is because the horizontal velocity of any point on \u2202R2+ is zero. Then we use the important fact that the vertical velocity of that point is strictly greater than the growth rate of the vertical center of mass of the patch 1\u03a6t(\u21260) on R2+:\nu2 ( t,\u03a6(t, x0) ) \u2212 d dt\n1\n|\u03a6t(\u21260)| \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) x2dx \u2265 C > 0, x0 \u2208 \u2202\u21260 \u2229 \u2202S+, t \u2265 0,\nwhich is depicted in Lemma 3.4. In this lemma, we show that the rate of 1\u03a6t(\u21260) is close to the rate of 1\u03a6t(\u2126), the half of the vertical velocity of the point on \u2202\u03a6t(\u2126)\u2229\u2202R2+. Here, \u03a6(t) is the flow map induced from the periodic extension of u, the velocity of the steady solution 1\u2126. Due to this difference in vertical velocities, which is maintained for every time, the vertical distance between the point on \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) \u2229 \u2202R2+ and some point on \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) near the vertical center of mass of 1\u03a6t(\u21260) is bigger than Ct. This distance works as a lower bound of length(\u2202\u2126t) in Theorem 1.3. To prove this, we use the stability (1.3) from Theorem 1.1 applied on the bounded strip 1\u2126, and the velocity u corresponding to 1\u2126 that is calculated explicitly in Section 3.1.\nOrganization of the paper\nIn Section 2, we define the cylindrical Biot\u2013Savart law and list the conserved quantities of \u03c9(t), give the definition of rearrangement and its properties, define the cut-off operator, and move on to the proof of Theorem 1.1. We begin Section 3 by calculating the velocity field u of the patch 1\u2126 and the total mass of\n1\u2126. After defining the map Q from the , we define periodic extensions of u(t) and u, and induce flow maps \u03a6(t) and \u03a6(t) from these extensions. Then we present that \u2126t is the image of \u03a6(t,\u21260) = \u03a6t(\u21260) through the map Q. After explicitly calculating the growth rate of the vertical center of mass of the patch 1\u03a6t(\u2126) on R2+, we prove several lemmas concerning the control of the difference of vertical velocities and the growth rates of vertical center of mass between 1\u03a6t(\u21260) and 1\u03a6t(\u2126). We finish the paper with the proof of Theorem 1.3."

(2.6)\nThere are two properties of rearrangement that we use in this section. The first is the nonexpansivity, which is introduced in the following lemma.\nLemma 2.2 (Nonexpansivity).

This is the extension of [20, Lemma 2] in a bounded strip {x1 < a}, a > 0. Recall that in Theorem 1.1, we required the stationary solution \u03b6 = \u03b6(x1) to be non-increasing. This is because it satisfies \u03b6\n\u2217 = \u03b6, and this fact is used in applying the above lemma with g = \u03b6 in the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nThe second is the rearrangement estimate (2.7), which is a refinement of (2.6). Such an estimate can be found in [20, Lemma 1] when the fluid lies on the bounded strip {x1 < a}, a <\u221e.\nLemma 2.3.

Without loss of generality, we assume \u2016f\u2016L\u221e = 1. First, let us consider the case f = 1\u2126, where \u2126 \u2282 S+ is a measurable set with finite measure.

For s \u2208 [0, \u03b1], we have\n{\u0393\u03b1(f\u2217) > s} = {f\u2217 > s} = {f > s}\u2217 = {\u0393\u03b1f > s}\u2217,\nand for s \u2208 (\u03b1,\u221e), we have {\u0393\u03b1(f\u2217) > s} = \u2205 = {\u0393\u03b1f > s}\u2217.\nThis property is crucial in the proof of Theorem 1.1."

(3.4)\nTo prove this lemma, we use an elementary lemma (e.g. see Iftimie\u2013Sideris\u2013Gamblin [14]) that is used in bounding the velocity term by the L1\u2212norm and the L\u221e\u2212norm of the vorticity term.\nLemma 3.2 ([14, Lemma 2.1]). Let A \u2282 R2 and f \u2208 (L1 \u2229 L\u221e)(A) be a non-negative function. Then there exists an absolute constant C \u2032 > 0 such that for any x \u2208 R2, we have\u222b\nA\nf(y)\n|x\u2212 y| dy \u2264 C \u2032 \u2225\u2225f\u2225\u2225 12 L1(A) \u2225\u2225f\u2225\u2225 12 L\u221e(A) .\nProof of Lemma 3.1. We fix x = (x1, x2) \u2208 S+. First, we define the periodic extensions \u2126t,ext,\u2126ext \u2282 R2+ of sets \u2126t,\u2126 \u2282 S+ as\n\u2126t,ext = \u2126t, \u2126ext = \u2126 in S+,\n\u2126t,ext +\n( 0\n2k\u03c0\n) = \u2126t,ext, \u2126ext + ( 0\n2k\u03c0\n) = \u2126ext for any k \u2208 Z.\nAlso, we define a subset A \u2282 R2+ as A := R>0 \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c0 + x2, \u03c0 + x2). Then using that K2(x, \u00b7), 1\u2126t,ext , and 1\u2126ext are 2\u03c0\u2212periodic in y2, we have\n|u2(t, x)\u2212 u2(x)| \u2264 \u222b S+ |K2(x, y)| \u00b7 |1\u2126t(y)\u2212 1\u2126(y)|dy = \u222b A |K2(x, y)| \u00b7 |1\u2126t,ext(y)\u2212 1\u2126ext(y)|dy.\nNow we use the estimate (2.4) of K2 and the above lemma to get |u2(t, x)\u2212 u2(x)| \u2264 \u222b A |K2(x, y)| \u00b7 |1\u2126t,ext(y)\u2212 1\u2126ext(y)|dy \u2264 \u222b A ( C0 |x\u2212 y| + 1 ) \u00b7 |1\u2126t,ext(y)\u2212 1\u2126ext(y)|dy\n\u2264 C \u20320 \u2225\u22251\u2126t,ext \u2212 1\u2126ext\u2225\u2225 12L1(A)\u2225\u22251\u2126t,ext \u2212 1\u2126ext\u2225\u2225 12L\u221e(A) + \u2225\u22251\u2126t,ext \u2212 1\u2126ext\u2225\u2225L1(A)\n= C \u20320 \u2225\u22251\u2126t \u2212 1\u2126\u2225\u2225 12L1(S+) + \u2225\u22251\u2126t \u2212 1\u2126\u2225\u2225L1(S+),\nfor some C \u20320 > 0. Finally, taking C3 := max{1, C \u20320}, we have\n|u2(t, x)\u2212 u2(x)| \u2264 C \u20320 \u2225\u22251\u2126t \u2212 1\u2126\u2225\u2225 12L1(S+) + \u2225\u22251\u2126t \u2212 1\u2126\u2225\u2225L1(S+) \u2264 C3[|\u2126t4\u2126| 12 + |\u2126t4\u2126|].\nAs a corollary of this lemma, applying the J1\u2212stability, obtained in Theorem 1.1, on (3.4) allows us to control the difference between u2(t) and u2 with the difference between \u21260 and \u2126 in measure.\nCorollary 3.3. There exists a constant C4 > 0 such that if \u21260 \u2282 {x1 < 3} is a bounded open set that satisfies |\u212604\u2126| \u2264 1, then for any t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 S+, the velocity fields u(t) and u from the previous lemma satisfy\n|u2(t, x)\u2212 u2(x)| \u2264 C4|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 . (3.5)\nProof. Using (1.3) from Theorem 1.1 with L = M = 1, \u03b6 = 1\u2126, and \u03c9(t) = 1\u2126t , we can take an absolute constant C1 > 0 that satisfies\n|\u2126t4\u2126| = \u222b\n\u2126t4\u2126 1dx \u2264 \u222b \u2126t4\u2126 (1 + x1)dx \u2264 C1 [(\u222b \u212604\u2126 (1 + x1)dx ) 1 2 + \u222b \u212604\u2126 (1 + x1)dx ] .\nThen using the conditions \u21260 \u2282 {x1 < 3} and |\u212604\u2126| \u2264 1, we have |\u2126t4\u2126| \u2264 C1 [(\u222b\n\u212604\u2126 (1 + x1)dx\n) 1 2\n+ \u222b \u212604\u2126 (1 + x1)dx ] \u2264 4C1 [ |\u212604\u2126| 1 2 + |\u212604\u2126| ] \u2264 8C1|\u212604\u2126| 1 2 .\n(3.6)\nFinally for any t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 S+, combining this with (3.4) from the previous lemma, we obtain |u2(t, x)\u2212 u2(x)| \u2264 C3 [ |\u2126t4\u2126| 1 2 + |\u2126t4\u2126| ] \u2264 C3 [\u221a 8C1|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 + 8C1|\u212604\u2126| 1 2 ] \u2264 C4|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 with C4 := C3( \u221a 8C1 + 8C1).\nUsing this corollary, we prove that the growth rate of the vertical center of mass ddtk(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) of 1\u03a6t(\u21260) is close to ddtk(1\u03a6t(\u2126)) in (3.3) if the sets \u21260 and \u2126 in S+ are close with each other in measure.\nLemma 3.4. There exists a constant C5 > 0 such that if \u21260 \u2282 {x1 < 3} from the previous corollary satisfy |\u21260| = |\u2126| as well, then for any t \u2265 0, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ddtk(1\u03a6t(\u21260))\u2212 ddtk(1\u03a6t(\u2126))\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C5|\u212604\u2126| 14 . (3.7) Proof. We fix t \u2265 0. Then following a similar procedure as in (3.3), we have\nd dt k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) = d dt [(\u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) 1 dx )\u22121 \u00b7 \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) x2dx ] = (\u222b \u21260 1 dx )\u22121 \u00b7 \u222b \u21260 d dt \u03a62(t, x)dx\n= 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b \u21260 uext,2 ( t,\u03a6(t, x) ) dx = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) uext,2(t, x)dx.\nThen taking N \u2208 N that satisfies \u03a6t(\u21260) \u2282 R>0 \u00d7 [\u2212(2N + 1)\u03c0, (2N + 1)\u03c0) and using notations\nEt,k = \u03a6t(\u21260) \u2229 {(2k \u2212 1)\u03c0 \u2264 x2 < (2k + 1)\u03c0}, \u2126t,k = Et,k \u2212 (\n0 2k\u03c0\n) , k \u2208 {\u2212N, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N},\nfrom (3.2), we have\nd dt k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) uext,2(t, x)dx = 1 2\u03c0 N\u2211 k=\u2212N \u222b Et,k u2 ( t, Q(x) ) dx\n= 1\n2\u03c0 N\u2211 k=\u2212N \u222b Et,k u2 ( t, x\u2212 (0, 2k\u03c0) ) dx = 1 2\u03c0 N\u2211 k=\u2212N \u222b \u2126t,k u2(t, x)dx = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u2126t u2(t, x)dx.\nNow note that from the inequality (3.6), we can get\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b \u2126t u2(x)dx\u2212 \u222b \u2126 u2(x)dx \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b \u2126t\\\u2126 u2(x)dx\u2212 \u222b \u2126\\\u2126t u2(x)dx \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u222b \u2126t4\u2126 |u2(x)|dx\n\u2264 \u2225\u2225u2\u2225\u2225L\u221e(S+) \u00b7 |\u2126t4\u2126| \u2264 8C1|\u212604\u2126| 12 .\nUsing this and (3.5) from Corollary 3.3, we can obtain upper and lower bounds of ddtk(1\u03a6t(\u21260)). For the upper bound, we have\nd dt k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u2126t u2(t, y)dy \u2264 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u2126t [ u2(x) + C4|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 ] dx\n\u2264 1 2\u03c0 [ \u222b \u2126 u2(x)dx+ 8C1|\u212604\u2126| 1 2 + C4|\u2126t| \u00b7 |\u212604\u2126| 1 4 ] \u2264 d dt k(1\u03a6t(\u2126)) + (2C1 + C4)|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 .\nIn the same way, the following lower bound can be derived:\nd dt k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) \u2265 d dt k(1\u03a6t(\u2126))\u2212 (2C1 + C4)|\u212604\u2126| 1 4 .\nFinally, taking C5 := 2C1 + C4, we obtain (3.7)."

            "text": "We finish this paper by proving Theorem 1.3.\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Let \u21260 \u2282 S+ be a bounded, open set with a smooth boundary \u2202\u21260 that satisfies the following conditions (see Figure 1):\n(a) there exists a closed curve \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 S+ such that \u03b3([0, 1]) = \u2202\u21260 and \u03b3(0) = \u03b3(1); (b) length(\u2202\u21260) \u2264 20; (c) |\u21260| = |\u2126|;\n(d) \u03b4 := |\u212604\u2126| \u2264 min { 1, ( 1\n4(C4 + C5)\n)4} ;\n(e) k(1\u21260) = 0; (f) (0, 0) \u2208 \u2202\u21260 \u2229 \u2202S+.\n(3.8)\nNote that the set \u2126 does not satisfy the condition (a) due to disconnectedness of its boundary \u2202\u2126 = ({0}\u00d7T)\u222a ({1}\u00d7T). We fix t \u2265 0. We claim that there exist two points a = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2) \u2208 \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) depending on t and an absolute constant C2 > 0 such that they satisfy\na2 \u2212 C2t \u2265 k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) \u2265 b2. (3.9)\nOnce the above is shown, then we obtain\nlength(\u2202\u2126t) \u2265 |a\u2212 b| \u2265 a2 \u2212 b2 \u2265 C2t,\nand the proof is done. We consider the point \u03a6(t, (0, 0)) \u2208 R2+ = R\u22650 \u00d7 R. Then note that we have \u03a61(t, (0, 0)) = 0 because any point on the x2\u2212axis stays on the axis along the flow map, due to the tangential boundary condition of u at x1 = 0. Additionally, using the inequality (3.5) from Corollary 3.3, we get\n\u03a62(t, (0, 0)) = \u03a62(0, (0, 0)) + \u222b t 0 d ds \u03a62(s, (0, 0))ds = 0 + \u222b t 0 uext,2 ( s,\u03a6(s, (0, 0)) ) ds\n= \u222b t 0 u2 ( s,Q ( \u03a6(s, (0, 0)) )) ds \u2265 \u222b t 0 [ u2 ( Q ( \u03a6(s, (0, 0)) )) \u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 ] ds.\nThen due to \u03a61(s, (0, 0)) = 0, we have the lower bound of \u03a62(t, (0, 0)): \u03a62(t, (0, 0)) \u2265 \u222b t\n0\n[ u2 ( Q ( \u03a6(s, (0, 0)) )) \u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 ] ds = \u222b t 0 [( 1\u2212Q1 ( \u03a6(s, (0, 0)) )) \u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 ] ds\n= \u222b t 0 [( 1\u2212 \u03a61(s, (0, 0)) ) \u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 ] ds = \u222b t 0 (1\u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 )ds = (1\u2212 C4\u03b4 1 4 )t.\n(3.10)\nSimilarly, we can find the upper bound of k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) using the inequality (3.7) from Lemma 3.4 and the calculation (3.3):\nk(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) = k(1\u21260) + \u222b t 0 d ds k(1\u03a6s(\u21260))ds \u2264 \u222b t 0 ( d ds k(1\u03a6s(\u2126)) + C5\u03b4 1 4 ) ds = ( 1 2 + C5\u03b4 1 4 ) t. (3.11)\nThen by the above bounds (3.10), (3.11), and the condition (d) of (3.8), we have\n\u03a62(t, (0, 0))\u2212 t\n4 \u2265 (1\u2212 C4\u03b4\n1 4 )t\u2212 t\n4 =\n( 1\n2 \u2212 C4\u03b4\n1 4 ) t+ t\n4 \u2265 ( 1\n2 \u2212 C4\u03b4\n1 4 ) t+ (C4 + C5)\u03b4 1 4 t \u2265 ( 1\n2 + C5\u03b4\n1 4 ) t \u2265 k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)).\nWe choose a = \u03a6(t, (0, 0)) and C2 = 1 4 . It is only left to show that there exists a point b \u2208 \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) such that k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) \u2265 b2. (3.12)\nIndeed, if every point \u03be \u2208 \u2202\u03a6t(\u21260) satisfies k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) < \u03be2, then it leads to the following contradiction:\nk(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) = (\u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) 1 dx )\u22121 \u00b7 \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) x2dx > (\u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) 1 dx )\u22121 \u00b7 k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)) \u00b7 \u222b \u03a6t(\u21260) 1 dx = k(1\u03a6t(\u21260)).\nThis finishes the proof of the claim (3.9).\n\u2022 Data availability statement : Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study."
