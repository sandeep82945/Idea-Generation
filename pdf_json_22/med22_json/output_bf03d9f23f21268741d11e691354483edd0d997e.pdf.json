How to cope with breech delivery (vaginal or C-section) has been discussed to find the safest in terms of morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the risks of foetal and maternal mortality and perinatal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery against elective caesarean in breech presentations, as reported in observational studies.\nMethods Studies assessing perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with breech presentations births. Cochrane, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cuiden databases were consulted. This protocol was registered in PROSPERO CRD42020197598. Selection criteria were: years between 2010 and 2020, in English language, and full-term gestation (37-42 weeks). The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analyses were performed to study each parameter related to neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity.\nResults The meta-analysis included 94 285 births with breech presentation. The relative risk of perinatal mortality was 5.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.61-11.51) times higher in the vaginal delivery group, 4.12 (95% CI = 2.46-6.89) for birth trauma and 3.33 (95% CI = 1.95-5.67) for Apgar results. Maternal morbidity showed a relative risk 0.30 (95% CI = 0.13-0.67) times higher in the planned caesarean group.\nConclusions An increment in the risk of perinatal mortality, birth trauma, and Apgar lower than 7 was identified in planned vaginal delivery. However, the risk of severe maternal morbidity because of complications of a planned caesarean was slightly higher.\nOne of the most controversial topics in obstetrics in recent years has been the discussion about how to deal with breech delivery, whether vaginal or caesarean. Although caesarean is considered a safe way of treating breech delivery, it contributes to high rates of postpartum maternal morbidity in developed countries and it is known to cause significant complications such as anaemia, urinary tract infections, superficial or complete dehiscence of the operative wound, endometritis, inflammatory complications [1], muscle pain, headache, lack of sexual satisfaction after delivery, digestive problems, fever and infection, abnormal bleeding, and stress urinary incontinence [2].\nCarrasco et al. V IE W PO IN TS PA PE RS\n2022 \u2022 Vol. 12 \u2022 04055 2 www.jogh.org \u2022 doi: 10.7189/jogh.12.04055\nHowever, in 2000, the authors of the Term Breech Trial Collaborative Group (TBT) [3] published a randomised multicentre collaborative study about how to deal with term breech delivery. They concluded that elective caesareans offered better results than vaginal deliveries in full-term foetuses with breech presentation, while maternal complications were similar between the two groups. So, according to this evidence, the practice of elective caesarean was fostered in such presentations [3]. Following this trend, the TBT recommendation was adopted by important organisations in many countries, opting for a scheduled caesarean before the end of gestation and this way preventing spontaneous breech vaginal delivery, and the attributed risks, from being triggered [4].\nSubsequently, in 2006 the PREMODA multicentre study was published [5]. Based on this study, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists changed their protocols that same year and concluded that vaginal delivery in breech presentation and single-term gestation was a reasonable option in properly selected pregnant women and experienced health workers [6].\nTherefore, the TBT study [3] was called into question and some national associations [7] included the option of having a vaginal breech delivery in their childbirth care protocol for full-term breech presentation, allowing the free evolution of the delivery process, provided that there is specifically trained staff in the affected centre. This procedure is currently accepted [6].\nAnalysing the original TBT data [3], serious concerns were raised regarding the design of the study, methods, and conclusions. In a considerable number of cases, there was a lack of adherence to the inclusion criteria and there was great interinstitutional variation regarding the standards of care. Also, inadequate methods of foetal antepartum and intrapartum evaluation were used, and a large proportion of women were recruited during active delivery, in many cases, without assistance from a doctor with adequate experience [8].\nPrimary caesarean in the first pregnancy has been associated with neonatal and maternal adverse outcomes in subsequent delivery [9]. In this way, abandoning vaginal delivery with breech presentation and opting indiscriminately for a caesarean would mean denying women access to health care options [10].\nThe Cochrane review conducted by Hofmeyr et al., which focused on planned caesarean section for term breech delivery, concluded that it reduced perinatal and neonatal death as well as serious neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity compared with planned vaginal delivery. Authors suggested to consider mother\u2019s preference for vaginal birth and risks such as future pregnancy complications, and the option of external cephalic version [11].\nThe meta-analysis conducted by Berhan et al. [12] (1993-2014) aimed at assessing the risk of morbidity and perinatal mortality in breech, full-term and single-foetus deliveries. Results showed a higher relative risk in vaginal delivery for perinatal mortality, trauma at birth, and Apgar at the fifth minute of life.\nThe present meta-analysis sought to update scientific evidence with the latest studies published in the last 10 years (2010-2020), so the results would be a complementary update. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the risks of vaginal delivery with elective caesarean in breech presentations, in terms of neonatal mortality, perinatal trauma, Apgar, neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) admittance, and maternal morbidity, according to evidence published during the last 10 years."

            "text": "For this study, the default inclusion criteria were:\n1. Observational studies of cohorts were included; reviews, brief reports, guidelines, and comments were excluded.\n2. Studies that assessed perinatal mortality and morbidity in relation to the type of delivery with breech presentation.\n3. Studies published in any language, between January 2010 and September 2020.\n4. Studies in which the samples were characterised by full-term gestations (between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation), with a single foetus, and breech presentation.\nThe authors decided to establish observational studies as an inclusion criterion as a review restricted to randomised controlled trials would have given an incomplete summary of the effects of a treatment, due to potential harms. Therefore, ClinicalTrials.gov was not consulted. The studies published before 2010 were excluded because recent scientific publications have turned other previously published ones into outdated evidence, and the aimed was to gather the latest reliable results. In addition, studies where foetuses had lethal congenital abnormalities and caesareans made by other obstetric indications such as multiple pregnancy or intrauterine foetal deaths were also excluded.\nThe selection of studies was carried out in three stages. First, after reviewing the titles, all relevant literature was retrieved from the respective databases. Second, summaries of all recovered articles were reviewed and then grouped as \u201celigible for inclusion\u201d or \u201cNot eligible for inclusion\u201d. Third, articles that were grouped as \u201celigible for inclusion\u201d were revised in detail for the final decision.\nThe entire process of selection, the quality assessment and also data extraction were carried out by two investigators independently. Each study was individually evaluated by one of the researchers and results were shared. In case of discrepancies, both researchers discussed their arguments and agreement was reached by consensus; occasionally, a third researcher\u2019s assessment was required.\nMethodological quality of the included studies\nThe methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This scale was designed for assessing the quality of non-randomised studies included in a systematic review and/or meta-analyses. It contains eight items organised in three dimensions: the selection of the study groups (four items); the comparability of the groups (one item); and the ascertainment of the outcome (three items). Studies were evaluated following a star system such that each item can be awarded a maximum of one star, excepting the item related to comparability, which allows the assignment of two stars. The total score ranges between zero and nine stars [15,16]."

The results of the different items were compared on the basis of the primary outcomes, which were neonatal mortality, perinatal trauma, Apgar, neonatal ICU admittance, and maternal morbidity.\nData were extracted using a standard Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet. The extracted data included: the name of the first author, year of publication, period of study, country where the study was conducted in, conclusion of the study, sample size, type of delivery, intrapartum and neonatal mortality, perinatal trauma, Apgar score at the first and fifth minute of life, neonatal ICU admissions, and severe maternal morbidity.\nIn this review, neonatal mortality was considered as deaths before 7 days of age after birth. The WHO establishes early neonatal mortality up to the seventh day of life. Complications at birth as a result of childbirth are manifested in the first 7 days [17]. In fact, all the observational studies included in the present meta-analysis took this same period of time as a reference. Perinatal trauma included collarbone fracture, humerus or femur, intracerebral bleeding, cephalic haematoma, facial paralysis, brachial plexus injury, and other trauma.\nFor this study, severe maternal morbidity was considered as unexpected labour and delivery outcomes that result in significant short-term or long-term consequences for the woman\u2019s health. Serious complications of the intervention, whether caesarean or delivery, severe postpartum haemorrhages, neurological problems, sepsis, lung, kidney, or cardiac problems were included [18].\nCarrasco et al.

Heterogeneity was determined using the Cochran\u2019s Q \u03c72 test and the I2 values for the following variables:\n(1) Early and incipient neonatal death, (2) birth trauma, (3) Apgar test score at 5 minutes, (4) neonatal admission to ICU, (5) severe maternal morbidity.\nHeterogeneity between studies was assessed by calculating values for I2 and P values. Due to the high I2, an important statistic for assessing heterogeneity, the random effects method was used. The I2 value was interpreted as without heterogeneity (0%), low heterogeneity (<40%), moderate heterogeneity (<60%), substantial heterogeneity (<75%) and considerable heterogeneity (\u226575%) [19]. The stability of the overall RR in the withdrawal of any of the studies was performed by sensitivity analysis (treating one study at a time). All meta-analyses were performed using the Epidat Software 3.0 (Xunta de Galicia, Santiago de Compostela, Spain).\nRESULTS Description of the included studies\nThe initial electronic search yielded a total of 19 055 references, and after removing duplicate records, 6802 references were reviewed. Of these, after reading the title and abstract, 6644 references were deleted for not meeting the inclusion criteria, so 158 were selected for full text review. Following the research protocol, 142 were excluded because they were not related to the current revision, because some made comparisons between breech and vertex presentation, and others assessed long-term maternal and neonatal complications. Finally, 16 articles were selected for meta-analysis [10,20-34]. The selection process is shown in Figure 1.\nOf the 16 studies, 10 had been conducted in Europe, 2 in Asia, 2 in Oceania, and 2 in Africa. Of these, 4 were in favour of elective caesarean to minimise neonatal morbidity but recognised that this increased longterm maternal morbidity by conditioning the type of birth for a future pregnancy [10,21,27,34]. Two of the reviewed studies found that caesarean reduced the risk of neonatal mortality [10,21]. However, 12 of the studies involved in the meta-analysis concluded that vaginal delivery could be an acceptable option in breech presentation provided that strict criteria for the selection of cases were established [20,22-26,28-33]. Sample sizes for the studies included ranged from 111 to 58 320 (Table 1).\nRegarding methodological quality assessment, the included studies were scored from 5 to 9 stars according to de Newcastle-Ottawa scale (Table 2). The publication bias was analysed, and results were summarised in Figure S1 and Figure S2 in the Online Supplementary Document."

The grouped meta-analysis showed a nearly 3.33 (95% CI = 1.95-5.67) times higher risk of the Apgar test having a score of less than 7 points in the planned vaginal delivery group. The overall heterogeneity of the tests showed considerable variability between studies (I2 = 86%).

In the planned vaginal delivery group, there were 435 (1.86%) admittances at the ICU of newborns, while in the planned caesarean group, the figure was 869 (3.72%) [20,21,23-25,27,29,30] (Figure 5). The grouped meta-analysis showed a 1.90 (95% CI = 1.34-2.70) times increased risk of admittance to ICU in the planned vaginal delivery group. The overall heterogeneity of the tests showed substantial variability between studies (I2 = 64%).

Maternal morbidity was found in 6 cases (0.69%) for the planned vaginal delivery group, and in 83 cases (2.64%) for the planned caesarean group. The grouped meta-analysis showed a 0.30 (95% CI = 0.13- 0.67) times reduced risk of severe maternal morbidity in the planned vaginal delivery group than in the planned caesarean group.

            "text": "Regardless of whether childbirth is done vaginally or through caesarean delivery, morbidity and mortality rates have been represented higher at breech births than at cephalic births [35]. Since the publication of TBT [3], several studies have shown increased morbidity and perinatal mortality with breech presentations in planned vaginal delivery vs planned caesarean [9,21,36,37]. These results were consistent with TBT [3] and PREMODA results [5].\nAlthough the potential biases associated with the observational design of the studies included in this meta-analysis must be recognised, with the consequent caution in comparing results with similar previous studies, our results were in line with previous meta-analyses. According to Berhan et al. [12], the relative risk of perinatal mortality, trauma at birth, and Apgar at the fifth minute of life were higher in the planned vaginal delivery than in planned caesarean for term singleton breech (3.4 vs 6.3; 3.1 vs 4.2; and 4.7 vs 2.99, respectively). Our study, despite having included only observational studies, agreed with these outcomes.\nFigure 6. Meta-analysis of severe maternal morbidity in term singleton breech presentation (planned vaginal delivery vs planned caesarean section) (n = 4007).\nFigure 5. Meta-analysis of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in term, singleton breech presentation (planned vaginal delivery vs planned caesarean section) (n = 32 438).\nRisks of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section\nV IE\nW PO\nIN TS\nPA PE\nRS\nwww.jogh.org \u2022 doi: 10.7189/jogh.12.04055 9 2022 \u2022 Vol. 12 \u2022 04055\nFor the severe maternal morbidity indicator, the present meta-analysis showed a relative risk of 0.30 in favour of vaginal delivery. This means that vaginal delivery is a protective factor against severe maternal morbidity. Although the risk is low, maternal morbidity and mortality increase as a result of complications of a planned caesarean for breech presentations [21,36]. Several studies claimed that planned caesarean may increase the risks for the mother as a result of scarred uterus [9,21,34], so the relative safety of planned caesarean should be weighed [9,38].\nIn the absence of a contraindication for vaginal delivery, a woman with a breech presentation foetus must be truthfully informed, considering the scientific evidence so far, of the risks and benefits of vaginal breech delivery and elective caesarean, so that the woman can decide and consent to the desired type of delivery [29,39]. The woman\u2019s decision must be respected and, to do so, the staff attending births must be trained and updated in the assistance of breech vaginal deliveries [39,40]. Otherwise, the woman will be denied a medical treatment option to which she could have turned to [40].\nRegardless of the way of planning the type of delivery, vaginal delivery in breech presentation will always exist, as a delivery may always become urgent and present with these characteristics. Therefore, it is essential that staff attending births do not lose this ability and master it in order to provide quality health care to women [39]."

            "text": "The risks for neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity implies an ethical dilemma: assuming either the risk of neonatal mortality or the risk of severe maternal morbidity. The risk of neonatal mortality was higher; therefore, we would only consider exposing the mother and foetus to vaginal delivery in the case of good obstetric conditions and given that the health care professional is well trained and experienced in these procedures. Otherwise, we recommend delivery by caesarean section. Our study bases the practice of individualisation on decision-making when choosing the type of delivery in unique gestations with full-term foetuses and breech presentation. Each pregnancy should assess the risks individually, considering the woman\u2019s preferences and the context, and seeking a balance between neonatal mortality and maternal morbidity.\nSome limitations have been found in conducting this research, starting with the great variability regarding the size of the samples. Studies with very small samples have had little weight when calculating RR in the grouped meta-analysis, while studies with a very large sample size had much more weight. For this reason, we have had to accept a relatively high (moderate) percentage of heterogeneity (I2) in some meta-analyses as, if eliminated, the sample would be drastically reduced.\nVaginal, breech, full-term delivery with a single foetus had a higher risk of morbidity and perinatal mortality than caesarean delivery under the same conditions. Still, the results of this meta-analysis suggested that the risk of vaginal breech delivery is lower than in the results of other previously published studies [29-31,33,34].\nAdditionally, the potential bias accompanying observational studies should be acknowledged, given the Newcastle-Ottawa tool identified some items with lack of quality. Therefore, caution is suggested when comparing and generalising the results."

            "text": "Term breech birth risks have been analysed according to two possibilities: Vaginal delivery and caesarean delivery risks. Caesarean had high rates of postpartum maternal morbidity. Also, there is no evidence of reduced child perinatal morbidity or mortality. Otherwise, there is no contraindication for vaginal delivery in breech presentation in selected pregnant women and in the presence of experienced health workers.\nOur results could help in decision-making related to breech delivery, individualising the decision for each case by knowing the risks associated with each option. From an ethical perspective, the issue addressed in the review is highly sensitive, considering the risk of maternal morbidity and the risk of neonatal mortality. For this reason, further research is suggested that consolidates the available evidence for decision-making between the studied delivery methods.\nCarrasco et al.
