    "abstractText": "Purpose Financial resources for health care are limited, so assessment of intervention effectiveness in terms of health in relation to its costs is important. Measuring health outcomes in cost-effectiveness analyses is usually done by health-related quality of life measures, like the EQ-5D. However, over the past decade, innovations on the conceptual level of health have evolved and novel approaches are rising such as the capability approach, subjective wellbeing, and Positive Health. This study assesses the psychometric properties of the subjective wellbeing-5 dimension (SWB-5D) outcome measure. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study design was used to determine the concurrent and construct (convergent and known group) validity for the SWB-5D. Concurrent and convergent validity were estimated as correlations between the SWB-5D and the Dutch version of the EQ-5D, ICECAP-A, and PH-17. Assessment of known-groups validity was based on the variables illness, education, and the overall happiness (Cantril Ladder) and overall health scale (EQ-5D VAS). Results A representative sample of 1016 respondents of the Dutch population completed an online questionnaire. The SWB-5D showed reasonable concurrent validity and showed good convergent and known-group validity. The SWB-5D had a lower ceiling effect compared to the EQ-5D and ICECAP-A. Conclusion Compared to traditional health measurement approaches, novel approaches are more focused on the mental and social pillars of health. The SWB-5D shows psychometric feasibility of comprehensive measurement of health, as indicated by a range of validity measures in a large representative sample of the Dutch population.",

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) theoretically enable direct comparison of the costs of obtaining health outcomes between different healthcare interventions. Health outcomes have increasingly been assessed using a multiattribute utility instrument (MAUI) [1]: a generic healthrelated questionnaire about the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) combined with a (country specific) accompanying formula or set of weights for converting responses into utility scores.\nDuring the development of the MAUIs, different conceptual models of health have been used to measure health, based on the current World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) definition of health, first formulated in 1948. It describes health as \u201ca state of complete positive physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease of infirmity\u201d [2]. Thereby, three building blocks of health are defined: physical, mental, and social. HRQoL is most commonly measured with the EQ-5D instrument [3].\n* M. Elske van\u00a0den Akker-van Marle vandenakker@lumc.nl\nHeleen N.

This is important in the context of economic evaluations when interventions do not (only) affect physical functioning but also the other factors of quality of life, for example in the context of social care, mental health care [6], chronic care, and elderly care [7]. Currently, the effectiveness of interventions for these patient groups might be underestimated, which could ultimately lead to unwarranted underallocation of health care resources for these interventions.\nThe subjective wellbeing-5 dimensions (SWB-5D) is a new measurement tool and is intended to be better suited to assess quality of life comprehensively [8] (Pietersma, de Vries, & van den Akker-van, 2014). The intention was that the SWB-5D would be able to detect important effects of health interventions in\u00a0situations that are more care related than cure related, such as, end-of-life care, informal care, in\u00a0vitro fertilization, and chronic diseases.\nThe SWB-5D has been developed in two phases: (1) using a Delphi procedure in different stakeholdergroups to have a good understanding of what stakeholders perceive as important for HR-SWB [9] and (2) an exploratory factor analysis to investigate whether the identified domains in de Delphi can be summarized in a limited number of underlying factors [8]. This resulted in the identification of five domains, physical indepence, positive affect, negative affect, autonomy, and personal growth, each of which is represented by one item in the SWB-5D, see Online Resource 1. The next step is establishing the validity of the SWB-5D, which is vital in order to confidently use this instrument.\nThe aim of the current study is to assess the concurrent and construct (convergent and known group) validity and interpretability of the SWB-5D."

Utility scores are derived from preferences of the Dutch citizens [10] ranging from 1 (perfect health) to \u2212\u00a00.446 (worse than death) and anchored at 0 (death). The EQ-5D also contains a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) which records subject\u2019s self-reported health on a vertical scale ranging from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine).\nICECAP\u2011A\nThe ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A) is designed to measure people\u2019s capability (what an individual can do) rather than function (what they actually do) to highlight the importance of freedom to choose [11]. The measures consist of 5 items representing five dimensions: stability, attachment, autonomy, achievement, and enjoyment. Four response levels were defined for respondents to describe their level of ability to achieve these wellbeing states ranging from unable/cannot to completely/all/a lot. ICECAP-A scores were transformed into capability values using the Dutch tariff ranging from 1 (full capability) to 0 (no capability) [12].\nPH\u201117\nThe Postive Health (PH)-17 has a six-dimension structure comprising physical fitness, mental functions, future perspective, contentment, social relations, and daily lifemanagement [13]. For each dimension, two or three items are proposed on an 11-point Likert scale, ranging from totally disagree to totally agree. Scores for the six dimensions were computed as the mean score on the statements per dimensions. The total score was obtained by summing the mean scores of the six dimensions and ranged between 11 and 66, with higher scores indicating better health."

Correlation sizes below 0.2 were considered absent, those from 0.2 to less than 0.35 were considered weak, those from 0.35 to less than 0.50 were considered moderate, and those of 0.5 or greater were considered very strong [15]. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. To correct for type 1 error rate (false-positive correlations), Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied [16]. Instead of dividing the level of every test by the number of all tests, the Bonferroni-Holm procedure orders the test results from the smallest to the highest p value and adjusts the \u03b1 or p values sequentially. Prior to examining the data, a list of hypotheses was designed (Online Resource 2). At least 75% of these hypotheses should be confirmed to indicate good convergent validity [17]. Convergent validity assesses the extent of correlation between instruments intended to measure similar or overlapping constructs, in our case quality of life [18]. The convergent validity of the SWB-5D was determined by calculating Spearman rank correlations to test their association with the health (EQ5D and EQ-VAS), capability (ICECAP-A), and wellbeing (Cantril Ladder) measures. A list of all hypotheses on\n1 3\nconvergent validity and a visualization of the overlapping concepts tested can be found in Online Resource 2.\nHypothesis 1 (H1) concerned the correlation between SWB-5D sum score and utility score of the EQ-5D. Both questionnaires aim to measure quality of life, albeit with a different approach. However, we would expect that they correlate. Four out of the five questions of EQ-5D are based on the physical pillar of health. Therefore we hypothesized that these items correlate with the physical independence dimension of the SWB-5D (H2-5). Loneliness (SWB-5D) and anxiety/depression (EQ-5D) were expected to correlate because even though these concepts differ, both should indicate \u201cno happy feelings\u201d (H6). Furthermore, we expected that high happiness scores (SWB5D) would correlate with low anxiety/depression (EQ-5D) scores (H7). Similar to hypothesis 1, we expect the SWB5D sum score to correlate with the EQ-VAS score (H8).\nWe expected that sum score of the SWB-5D correlates with the ICECAP-A utility score (H9). Having problems concerning physical independence as captured by the SWB-5D might involve more dependency on others, which would be reflected in lower autonomy scores on the ICECAP-A (H10). Furthermore, we expected that happiness and loneliness were related to enjoyment and attachment (H11\u201314). Both questionnaires include a domain of autonomy, for which we expected that they would relate to each other (H15). Moreover, we expected that personal growth (SWB-5D) and achievement (ICECAP-A) would be related (H16). Finally, the SWB-5D sum score was hypothesized to correlate with the Cantril Ladder score (H17).\nKnown\u2011groups validity Known-groups validity was defined as the ability of the questionnaire to discriminate between subgroups. This was assessed by comparing differences in SWB-5D scores as a function of EQ-VAS score (below or above 65), Cantril Ladder score (below or above 7), illness (present or absent), and education (low, medium, or high). We expected higher SWB-5D scores for respondents with higher self-reported health/happiness scales (EQ-VAS and Cantril Ladder) and no illnesses. Based on earlier research, we also expected a difference between educational groups with lower reported health status for respondents with lower education [19]. Details on the hypotheses can be found in Online Resource 2. Since the SWB-5D scores did not follow a normal distribution, associations between the SWB-5D scores and selected variables were tested using a Mann\u2013Whitney U test for two group comparisons and a Kruskal Wallis H test for comparisons between three groups. Again, HolmBonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied. In addition, the standard error of the mean (SEM) was calculated, which allows us to identify whether outcome changes between measures can be attributed to a real mod-\nification. The SEM is equal to the square root of the error variance: SEM = \u221a 2\nerror [20, 21]."

Similarly to the result from the concurrent validity, the hypotheses that the items autonomy from the ICECAP-A and SWB-5D would correlate are not confirmed. Furthermore, good known-group validity was attained, since 4 of 4 hypotheses were confirmed (100%).\nAn explanation for the differences between the autonomy item from the ICECAP-A and SWB-5D could be that \u201cI am able to be completely independent\u201d (ICECAP-A) is interpreted as that you are able to do your usual activities independently [25], while \u201cI live my life in my own way\u201d (SWB-5D) might be interpreted as a way of life in which you make your own choices. Qualitative research is needed to further clarify this difference. Comparing opinions and interpretations of the items by respondents allows to investigate whether the intended non-tangible dimension is measured. Also the finding that the items\u2019 physical independence of the SWB-5D and autonomy from\nthe ICECAP-A do not correlate should be addressed in future qualitative research. While the use of a single item to measure a dimension has the advantage of reducing the burden for patients, it is likely to come with a disadvantage as well. Trying to capture a broad definition of health in only a few constructs with only one item per dimension may reduce reliability and validity, because items might be either formulated too broadly or fuzzy, or focus on different aspects of the same non-tangible dimension across different measures.\nCorrelations between the SWB-5D and the other tools were moderate which suggest that there is considerable overlap between the instruments, but also differences. These differences might reflect that additional aspects are measured with the SWB-5D which go beyond the existent measures [8]. This is supported by the fact that the SWB-5D explains a considerable amount of variance (56.7%) of the overall happiness measure (Cantril Ladder), which is higher than for the ICECAP-A and EQ-5D explaining, respectively, 52.1% and 49.1% of the variation in happiness (Online Resource 4)."

The Dutch guidelines for conducting economic evaluations in healthcare also specify that the ICECAP should be added when interventions aim to improve not only health, but wellbeing in terms of living situation, autonomy, and social interaction as well [27]. In line with this, the SWB-5D can be an additional measure for interventions for which mental and social aspects play an important role, e.g. that are more related to care than cure. However, adding questionnaires will lead to additional burden for the respondents, therefore, development of one new instrument in which all relevant pillars of health (physical, social and mental) are represented might be the ultimate goal. This study may add to this development. Another way forward may be the use of bolt-ons to existing measures that are frequently used such as the EQ-5D [28\u201330]. Several bolt-ons were identified already such as cognitive functioning, vision, hearing, relationships, and\n1 3\nsleep [30] covering additional mental and social domains.

Further research should assess other quantitative psychometric properties, such as test\u2013retest reliability. But, in line with other studies [31\u201333], our study highlights the importance that beyond a quantitative approach, it is essential to explore how the instrument succeeds in measuring outcomes that matter to patients, as well as patient\u2019s understanding of the questions asked. For such purpose, qualitative methods can be applied such as, face validity, response process validity, cognitive interviewing, and comments to open-ended survey questions. Another factor that should be taken into account is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was at the time of data collection a global health treat which might have negatively affected health and wellbeing outcomes. However, this is not expected to affect the assessment of psychometric properties.\nLast, by developing the SWB-5D, the intention was to detect effects of (health) interventions in\u00a0situations that are more care related than cure related [8]. Therefore, the SWB5D, or an alternative broad health measurement, should also be tested and evaluated in these care situations to reveal the responsiveness of the instrument, i.e. whether the instrument is able to reflect the effects of (health) interventions in these patient groups."

The present study showed good psychometric properties of the SWB-5D in a large representative Dutch sample. To conclude, this study is a step forwards in measuring health in a broad sense in health economic evaluations.\nThis instrument demonstrates both overlap and differences with other measurement tools, indicating that the SWB-5D measures a distinct concept. The present study adds to the established literature that there is a need to qualitatively explore measures and for a novel default measure. Whether this could be the SWB-5D or another novel initiative, we should strive together for a more comprehensive health measure standard.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11136- 022- 03234-8.\nAcknowledgements This paper is based on the first author\u2019s thesis as fulfilment of her Master degree at the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
