    "abstractText": "Background: Students can take different approaches to using online learning technologies: deep and surface. It is important to understand the relationship between instructor role and student approaches to using online learning technologies in online learning settings supported by cloud computing techniques. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted to analyze the relationships between medical students\u2019 perceptions of instructor role (instructor support, instructor-student interaction, and instructor innovation) and students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies in cloud-based virtual classrooms. A 25-item online questionnaire along with a sheet with basic demographic was administered to all medical students at Qilu Medical Schools of Shandong University China. Overall, 213 of 4000 medical students (5.34%) at the medical school participated in the survey. Results: The results showed high levels of medical students\u2019 perceived instructor support, instructor-student interaction and instructor innovation. Most students adopted the deep approaches to using online learning technologies. Instructor support, instructor-student interaction and innovation were positively related to students\u2019 deep approaches to using online learning technologies. Instructor support was negatively related to students\u2019 surface approaches to using online learning technologies. Conclusions: The relationship between instructor role (instructor support, instructor-student interaction and instructor innovation) and students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies highlight the importance of instructor support and innovation in facilitating students\u2019 adoption of desirable approaches to learning from the application of",

The key difference is that deep approaches involve the intention to understand and create meaning from what is being learned, whereas surface approaches involve an\n*Correspondence: liucy@sdu.edu.cn\n1 Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nintention to reproduce. Deep approaches to learning can lead to motivation and develop the ability of selfdirected learning which is a key aspect of adult learning in present medical education. Medical students can combine reflective practice with a checklist to reduce medical errors and solve complex medical problems. With the increasing use of the internet in higher education, online learning technology is widely used to implement learning, such as presentations, resource downloads and quizzes before cloud computing [3]. For medical students, online learning supported by cloud computing techniques including learning management platforms, multimedia (electronic database), tools for collaborative authoring, scheduling, and communication could be perceived as useful for learning [4]. In online learning settings, student approaches to using online learning technologies, as additions to approaches to learning, have received increasing attention in higher education. According to the Student Approaches to Using Online Learning Technologies (SAOLT) Scale [3], deep approaches to using online learning technologies are meaningful, engaged and developed understanding. To review and cross-reference ideas between different sources, the approaches are \u2018likely to stimulate critical thinking and new research pathways, while students adopting this approach are trying to connect the ideas in the course to the real-world experiences\u2019 [3], which is effective usage of online learning technologies have become thoroughly penetrates any category of critical thinking especially such as gathering relevant information, evaluating the credibility of a source, and communicating effectively with others and these skills are assumed to spark research inspiration. Whereas surface approaches to using online learning technologies are predominantly reproductive and are not efficient usage of the technologies to engage in inquiry, which are \u2018 tend to restrict the use of online learning technologies to minimize work, to only fulfill minimum course requirements and to try to avoid developing a meaningful online presence\u2019 [3]. In blended learning settings, researches into student approaches to learning and to using online learning technologies has commonly identified the positive association between deep approaches and academic achievement, and the negative relationship between surface approaches and academic achievement [3, 5\u20137]. Meanwhile, effective approaches to online learning technologies could contribute to the students\u2019 learning outcomes through their effect on students\u2019 learning process [3, 8]. Therefore, adopting both deep approaches to learning and to using online learning technologies, is imperative to be a reflective, self-directed medical practitioner. However, current knowledge about how to effectively help the medical students to develop deep approaches to online learning technologies remains very limited. The concept of student approaches to learning is context and task-dependent [9\u201311]. The role of instructors, one of the key elements of learning contextual factors, has been acknowledged as a significant factor influencing the learning approaches adopted by students [11]. Studies exploring instructor role in student learning suggest that instructor role is mainly assessed in terms of instructional support [12, 13], instructor scaffolding strategies such as instructor-student interaction [14, 15], and instructor innovation [16]. These studies indicate that instructor role in online learning environments facilitates students\u2019 understanding of the knowledge and encourages student engagement by utilizing various facilitation strategies and teaching tools supported by the cloud technique [14, 15, 17]. In online learning environments, instructional support refers to the students\u2019 perceived instructional guidance from instructors, which includes providing relevant resources, timely feedback and explanation, and correcting students\u2019 misunderstandings [12, 15, 16]. Instructor-student interaction is one type of three types interactions: teacher-student interaction (e. g. immediate and targeted feedback), peer interaction and student-content interaction. Instructors\u2019 implementation of strategies to promote learner-instructor interaction has been identified as a driving force for promoting students\u2019 motivation [12, 14]. Instructor innovation involves the new course design, unusual class activities and teaching techniques employed by instructors in order to meet the challenges faced by today\u2019s education [18]. Although a considerable number of studies have been conducted to explore the relationship between instructor role and student approaches to learning (SAL) in traditional and blending learning settings across a range of disciplines, such as science [19], nursing [20], and medicine [21], an integrated understanding of instructor role and student approaches to using online learning technologies (SAOLT) have received relatively less attention amongst medical students in a cloud-based virtual classroom. The understanding of the relationship between instructor role and student approaches to using online learning technologies, would help instructors design and create an effective online learning environment and make effective use of the educational tools supported by cloud computing techniques. As a consequence of the sudden outbreak of COVID19 in mainland China, the traditional faceto-face or blending teaching activities in higher education have been replaced by cloud-based virtual classrooms since 2020, leading to a shift from \u2018forced remote learning\u2019 to \u2018the new normal\u2019 online learning environments [22, 23]. The role of instructor is\none of the important research branches of the learning environment, and it is a significant determinant of students\u2019 learning outcomes. Since instructors have been found to use different teaching strategies for different learning environments [24], the contribution of this study is to provide evidence about instructor role and SAOLT in a specific context such as a cloud-based virtual classroom within a medical student sample. Within such a changed learning context, how do medical students perceive the instructor\u2019s role, and what is the predominant learning approach to using online learning technologies amongst medical students? How do instructors influence medical students\u2019 choices of learning approaches to using online learning technologies? An integral understanding of how various learning environmental factors may affect medical students\u2019 learning approaches to using online learning technologies is crucial to create a favorable remote learning environment. The present study aims to explore the characteristics of and relationship between medical students\u2019 perceived instructor role and approaches to using online learning technologies in a cloud-based virtual classroom in mainland China."

The second section included 10 items from the questionnaire based on student approaches to online learning technologies questionnaire (SAOLT) [3], which measures student approaches to using online learning technologies. The SAOLT was built on the theoretical framework of the student approach to learning including qualitatively different approaches to learning: deep approaches which are well understood, or surface approaches which are mainly reproductive. Six and four items were used to represent deep and surface approaches to online learning technologies construct, respectively. All items were slightly modified to indicate the online learning environment, and all items were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5 \u201cstrongly agree\u201d.

So the higher mean score was taken to be indicative of the individual\u2019s predominant learning approach in this study. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was employed to identify if the students\u2019 perceptions of instructor role, deep and surface approaches to learning variables vary across gender, and grade.

To verify whether the sampling was adequate and ideal for Factor Analysis, the Kaiser\u2013 Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) measure and Bartlett test of sphericity were used. According to Table\u00a0 1, the analysis results show that both KMO values for each section were higher than 0.85. Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity for two sections (p < 0.001) indicated that the factor analysis was appropriate. A factor analysis was performed to obtain item loading for each factor of the data. Factor loading of items less than 0.40 was used as a criterion to remove items. Table\u00a01 shows the rotated factor analysis in which five factors and 25 items were obtained by EFA: aligning with an instructional support (Factor 1), an instructorstudent interaction (Factor 2), an instructor innovation (Factor 3), a deep variable (Factor 4) and surface variable (Factor 5).

Results of Paired t-tests (See Table\u00a04) showed there was a significant difference between the mean scores of deep approaches and surface approaches (t (191) = 8.28, p < 0.001)."

Since the mean scores of all three dimensions of the instructor role were higher than 3.70, medical students were considered to endorse a certain amount of support and interactivity provided by their instructors, and instructors had a certain amount of innovations in a cloud-based virtual classroom. Meanwhile, most medical students agreed that they had adopted more deep approaches rather than surface approaches to learning in a cloud-based virtual classroom. Previous research indicated that providing effective instructional support and interactivity was particularly critical for the instructors in online learning environments [14, 16]. Therefore, in a cloud-based virtual classroom, medical students"

However, the results also indicated that students perceived a higher level of instructor-student interaction than that of instructor support and instructor innovation during the learning experience in a cloud-based virtual classroom. So, it is still a challenge for instructors and administrators how to improve effective and innovative teaching support by using cloud computing technology in cloud-based learning settings.\nResults of the SOALT questionnaire showed that medical students adopted more deep rather than surface approaches to using online learning technologies in a cloud-based virtual classroom. This result is consistent with the results of previous research with medical students in blended learning environments [30]. The possible explanation could be due to the medical curricula reform made in China in response to the Ministry of Education\u2019s requirements to cultivate more reflective and self-directed medical practitioners, which was accordant with the global trend towards encouraging deeper learning in medical education [31]. The main aim of medical curricula reform is to create a student-centered learning environment in which various teaching methods, unlike didactic pedagogies, are adopted to foster deep learning and understanding [32\u201334]. According to constructivist learning theory [34, 35], instructors may promote students\u2019 deep approaches to learning by \u201cways of thinking about teaching and learning that emphasize student responsibility and activity in learning rather than content or what the teachers are doing\u201d (Cannon and Newble, pp. 16\u201317) [35]. Given that students may develop their approaches to using online learning technologies as shown by their level of responses and activity, it could be possible for instructors to make students more engaged in learning and better encourage them to adopt deeper approaches to using online learning technologies, such as inquiry-based activities designed by the instructor via cloud-based education apps [36].\nThis study showed no significant difference in students\u2019 perceptions of instructor role and approaches among those with different demographic characteristics such as gender and grade. The previous studies about the demographic characteristics are mixed and elusive [37\u201339]. Since students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies are dependent on the learning environment and experience [3, 40], it is necessary to further investigate the impact of student demographics on the online learning process in a cloud-based classroom.\nThe second research question asked: How do instructors influence medical students\u2019 choices of learning approaches to using online learning technologies in a cloud-based virtual classroom? This study revealed a significant positive relationship between instructor role and students\u2019 deep approaches, and a significant negative contribution of instructor support to the students\u2019 adoption of surface approaches in a cloud-based virtual classroom. The instructor innovation contributed more than instructor support or instructor-student interaction as a significant coefficient in the regression with deep approaches to using online learning technologies as the dependent variable.\nThe positive effect of instructor role on students\u2019 adoption of deep approaches to use online learning technologies among medical students in a cloud-based virtual classroom, to our knowledge, is the first time to be reported. The results are similar to the findings of previous research into deep approaches to learning in blended learning environments [41]. To attain deeper learning in a cloud-based virtual classroom, it was more critical for instructors to offer proper guides on how to adopt deep approaches to using online learning technologies during learning process [3, 7, 14, 30]. The instructional guidance not only helps to deepen content understanding through the well-designed inquiry-based tasks etc. and promotes collective, cumulative and purposeful class interactions, but may also include the integration of content knowledge and online learning technologies in the online learning context, for example, how to develop and evaluate high-quality performance assessments via cloudbased education apps to have a deeper understanding of what kinds of tasks motivate thoughtful work, and how students think as they fulfilled the tasks. In this study, although students\u2019 perception of instructor-student interaction was the highest level among the three, the contribution of it to enhancing students\u2019 deep approaches to online learning technology was the smallest which may be due to the ineffective or low-quality class interactions. It is perhaps not surprising that the most positive correlations between instructor innovation and deep approaches to using online learning technologies, as instructors who keep pace with these new educational technologies could consider innovative and effective course design based on student needs, use various kinds of assessments and perform activities with personal characteristics supported by a good integration of content and cloud computing learning technologies [14, 42]. To stimulate students\u2019 deep learning in online learning environments, the challenges of instructors\u2019 innovation may include how to develop online adaptive expertise through inquiry-based tasks to find gaps and understand deviations in students\u2019 knowledge and acquire new structures, explanations, and forms\nof interaction, and how to encourage them to express their own cognitive processes and analyze and self-evaluate their problem-solving. Furthermore, it is well known that assessment can be instructive [43]. Therefore, the other challenges of instructors\u2019 innovation might include how to create an effective online assessments system that encourages the kinds of learning that are required to achieve the goals of career readiness.\nThe negative effect of instructional support on medical students\u2019 adoption of surface approaches to using online learning technologies further supported the importance of instructional support to reduce student adoption of surface approaches. Compared with deep approaches, surface approaches to learning and to using online learning technologies are positively related to perceptions of unreasonable online course design and learning workload, and poor academic performance in blended learning settings [3, 44]. Therefore, instructor support could be the key to creating a high-quality online learning environment by providing proper instructional guidance mentioned above to boost deep approaches and reduce surface approaches to using online learning technologies.\nDespite the low response rate of this study, the results are still encouraging and might be considered as representative because the demographic structure in terms of age and gender is consistent with current data on the broader medical undergraduate population in Chinese public universities. There are two possible reasons for the low response rate. The first one could be the general perception of lower student response rates of the online surveys compared to other survey methods such as paper-based surveys [45, 46]. The second one could be that medical students were less interested in the research topic of this survey because they thought the pure synchronous online teaching model was only a temporary emergency tool. Therefore, many students lacked the enthusiasm to respond to the questionnaires distributed by QR codes. This can be explained by the results of previous studies on the high correlation between survey response rates and participants\u2019 research interests [47].\nThis finding contributes to the body of literature by examining the relationship between the instructor role and students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies in cloud-based learning environments. Furthermore, it contributes to our understanding of why instructor support and innovation could be related to improving the quality of cloud-based online teaching and learning."

            "text": "The low response rate is one of the limitations of this study. The small sample group could increase the risk of receiving skewed results that don\u2019t fairly represent the\nrest of the students. To solve the issue of low response rate of the online surveys, higher response rates could be achievable by using multiple contacts, and teacherstudent communication and incentives in future online surveys [45]. The present study might offer some insight into the characteristics of and relationships between instructor role and students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies in a cloud-based virtual classroom in mainland China. Some limitations should be noted as indications for future work. First, the implications of our work for actual learning are limited. Although Ellis et. al. demonstrated the positive correlation between SAL and SOALT in a blended environment [3], further studies should be needed on the associations and interplay among SAL, SOALT and actual learning outcomes at the level of dependent variables in a specific context. In addition, the results of this study were based on the self-report data, therefore, some biases and limitations such as social desirability or introspective ability are inevitable. To improve our ability to interpret the effects of instructors\u2019 role, SAL and/or SOALT on actual learning outcomes, a mixture of data sources\u2014 including self-report data and an evaluation of the final assignment\u2014will be needed. Based on Biggs\u2019s 3P Model of Student Learning theory [48], the triadic reciprocal causation among Presage, Process and Product suggests that there are several possible models of the interrelationships amongst the role of the instructor, students\u2019 learning approaches including usage of online technology, and learning outcomes. Accordingly, further investigation of the interrelationships among the three variables is required to help teachers to design highquality inquiry-based activities which make much more efficient use of the Internet. Second, three dimensions of the instructor role in this study were examined (instructor support, instructor-student interaction, and instructor innovation). It is also essential to determine how students\u2019 approaches to using online learning technologies may change when instructors perform more different roles, such as boosting peer interaction. Last but not least, further study may consider a longitudinal research design to determine the consistent causation between these variables."

Medical students associated greater instructor support, instructor-student interaction, and innovation with greater self-reported use of deep\nlearning online tools, and instructor support had significant negative effects on the adoption of students\u2019 surface approaches to using online learning technologies. This study indicates that instructor-student interaction still needs to be improved, and instructor support and innovation could be more important in facilitating students\u2019 adoption of desirable approaches to online learning technologies in a synchronous online learning setting.\nAcknowledgements We sincerely appreciate the comments and advice we received from editors and reviewers in the production of the study.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions RW, JH and CL designed the study.
