In this work, we investigate the emerging dynamics of particles featuring ligands that selectively bind receptors decorating an interface. The formation of a ligandreceptor complex leads to a molecular bridge anchoring the particle to the surface. We consider systems with reversible bridges in which ligand-receptor pairs bind/unbind with finite reaction rates. For a given set of bridges, the particle can explore a tiny fraction of the surface as the extensivity of the bridges is finite. We show how, at time scales longer than the bridges\u2019 lifetime, the average position of the particle diffuses away from its initial value. We distill our findings into two analytic equations for the sliding diffusion constant of particles carrying mobile and fixed ligands. We quantitatively validate our theoretical predictions using reaction-diffusion simulations. We compare our findings with results from recent literature and discuss the molecular parameters that likely affect the particle\u2019s mobility most. Our results, along with recent literature, will allow inferring the microscopic parameters at play in complex biological systems from experimental trajectories.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLigand\u2013receptor interactions underly most of the biological processes found at the cell membrane, like adhesion and signaling1. Much work has quantified the interaction strength between particles (e.g., colloids, viruses, or vesicles) and surfaces (e.g., supported lipid bilayers or cell membranes) mediated by ligand\u2013receptor complexes2\u20137. Different groups have also studied the particle\u2013surface first contact leading to the formation of an interacting patch8\u201310. Despite the particle\u2019s mobility being pivotal in many biological processes, except for studies in a shear flow11\u201313, little has been done to understand the rolling/sliding dynamics of a functionalized particle at the interface14\u201318. For instance, successful cellular invasions by Influenza A Viruses19,20 and Herpes Viruses21 require the invader to diffuse along the cell membrane while remaining bound. Similarly, it is believed that the Malaria parasite uses ligand gradients to reorient itself towards a configuration favoring erythrocyte invasion22. In the self\u2013assembly of functionalized colloids, the mobility of bound particles is pivotal to relax disordered aggregates into crystalline structures23.\nThis study aims at improving our understanding of how particles bound to receptor\u2013expressing surfaces24 can laterally diffuse (slide). We develop a model in which the particle\u2019s center of mass is constrained to remain\na)These two authors contributed equally b)Electronic mail: Bortolo.Matteo.Mognetti@ulb.be\nwithin a finite area, \u2126, by the presence of bridges. \u2126 is entirely determined by a subset of bridges (in the following constraining bridges). The emerging dynamics are then controlled by the timescale over which a constraining bridge is added or removed along with the average displacement of the particle following an update of \u2126. We summarize our results using two simple equations (Eqs. 6, 10) expressing the diffusion constant in terms of the single-bridge off\u2013rate koff , the average number of bridges \u3008nb\u3009, and the area of the surface reachable by a single ligand. Our predictions hold in the limit in which the evolution of \u2126 is slow as compared to the timescales taken by the particle to explore \u2126. We clarify how this approximation holds based on the finding that the number of constraining bridges remains constant in the many-bridge limit (\u3008ncb\u3009 \u2248 5). In a recent contribution, Kowalewski et al. derived an expression similar to Eq. 6 (Eq. 7) for the diffusion of a molecular walker (Fig. 1b)25. As compared to Ref. 25, the present contribution clarifies how Eqs. 6 and 7 hold only if \u3008ncb\u3009 does not increase with the number of bridges.\nIn Sec. II we discuss our model as compared to experimental systems. In Sec. III, we derive the emerging diffusion constant for particles with mobile ligands (Eq. 6). In Sec. IV, we validate the results of Sec. III using reaction\u2013 diffusion simulations16. In Sec. V, we present our predictions for fixed ligands (Eq. 10). Finally, in Sec. VI, we summarize and discuss the findings of the paper in view of recent results.17,25\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n03 90\n8v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n5 A\npr 2\n02 2\n2 UV: SIDE VIEW\nUV: TOP VIEW\n(a) (b) Fixed ligands\nFixed receptors\nCOLLOIDAL PARTICLES MOLECULAR WALKER\nMobile ligands\n(c)\nFIG. 1.

            "text": "Unilamellar vesicles are a class of particles usually employed to carry mobile ligands (Fig. 1). Ligands (like membrane proteins or synthetic moieties) are anchored to the membrane through trans-membrane domains, hydrophobic complexes (inset of Fig. 1a, top), or covalent (e.g., glycosidic) bonds2. A schematic model of functionalized vesicles at the interface would comprise a contact region and an outer cap (Fig. 1a). Ligand-receptor bridges can form only inside the contact region, in the following modeled by a disk (Fig. 1a, bottom). The outer region acts as a finite reservoir of ligands. Neglecting fluctuations in the direction orthogonal to the surface, we model the system using a 2D representation in which the particle is identified with the disk corresponding to the contact region (Sec. III A). This model does not track the position of the mobile, free ligands which are mapped into uniform, depletable densities (as the total number of ligands is fixed).\nParticles with fixed ligands (Fig. 1b, left) include colloids functionalized by synthetic moieties or biological particles like viruses (e.g., Ref. 20). Spherical particles tend to roll rather than slide15,16. Sliding is occasionally more prominent in non-spherical particles like, e.g., the rod\u2013shaped strand of the Influenza A virus. In Sec. V, we predict the sliding diffusion constant using a 2D model (Fig. 8).\nRef. 25 employed a 2D model similar to the one of Fig. 1a, bottom to study molecular walkers (Fig. 1b, left). Molecular walkers are made from star-shaped polymers tipped by reactive moieties (e.g., Ref. 26). Each ligand\ncan then reach out to receptors found inside the circle centered over the projection of the branching point onto the surface with a radius equal to the length of the ligand.\nFig. 1c reports the important molecular parameters of the system. Bridges form or break with a rate constant equal to kon or koff , respectively. We refer to Secs. IV and V for the calculation of the rates, respectively, for fixed and mobile ligands. The reaction rates have a major impact on the emerging dynamics. A system composed of static bridges would result in a particle arrested on a surface. Another important element is the bond potential h. Ligand/receptor backbones are often constituted by flexible polymers. For ideal polymers, stretching the tethering points far away is contrasted by a harmonic attraction, h(d) = \u2212kd2/2 (where d is the lateral distance between tethering points). For non-ideal polymers, the bond potential is a multi\u2013body function that also depends on neighboring ligands/receptors. For more rigid backbones, the bond potential is dominated by the finite stretchability of the bridges. In this work, for fixed ligands, we use a square\u2013well bond potential, h(d) = 0 if d < \u03bb, h(d) =\u221e if d > \u03bb, where \u03bb is the maximal lateral extensibility of a bridge (e.g.,20). This choice is mainly motivated by the possibility of deriving universal analytic results which could then be used (when compared with other systems) to assess the importance of the bond potential h (Sec. VI).\nFor mobile ligands (Fig. 1a), the bond potential h plays a minor role as averaging over the ligand position results in a null force exerted onto the particle. This consideration holds only if the tethering point anchoring the bridge to the vesicle can explore most of its available configurational space before unbinding.\nIn this study, we only consider fixed, randomly distributed receptors. We comment on the mobility of the receptors and their distribution in Secs. V and VI."

III A), we characterize the configurational space (\u2126) available to a particle featuring a static set of bridges. In Secs. III B and III C, we then investigate, respectively, the rate at which \u2126 evolves when the set of bridges changes because a bridge is either added or removed and the average displacement of the particle following a change of \u2126. Based on such an understanding, in Sec. III D we propose an analytic expression for the emergent diffusion constant D (Eq. 6). Eq. 6 holds in the limit in which D is not limited by the diffusion constant of the free particle (nb = 0), D0. The simulation protocol employed in Secs.

            "text": "Following on from Sec. II (Fig. 1a), we model particles functionalized by mobile ligands using 2D disks of radius R moving over a surface decorated by randomly distributed, fixed receptors (Fig. 2a). The model tracks the position of the disk and the ensemble of receptors (dots in Fig. 2a) forming a bridge with a ligand moving on the particle.\nWe assume that bridges cannot be formed with receptors outside the particle\u2019s perimeter. Therefore, for mobile ligands, we assume that the interaction range is much smaller than the disk\u2019s radius (\u03bb R). For a given particle position, the bridges are taken as uniformly distributed inside the circle (Fig. 2a). For a given set of bridges, the circle\u2019s center can then explore a finite fraction of the surface compatible with the fact that bridges remain inside the perimeter of the particle rattling around the set of bridges (gray circles in Fig. 2a).\nFig. 2c highlights the configurational space available to the disk\u2019s center (\u2126) corresponding to the bridges of Fig. 2a. \u2126 comprises an ensemble of vertices joined with curved edges (in the following we will refer to such an object as a \u2019curved polygon\u2019). The edges are arcs of circles of radius R centered on the bridges in contact with the perimeter (thick, red points in Fig. 2a). Similarly, the vertices of \u2126 correspond to configurations in which the perimeter of the particle (gray lines in Fig. 2a) touches two bridges.\nIn general, only a finite fraction of bridges can come in contact with the perimeter of the particle (Fig. 2a). In the following, we will refer to them as \u2019Constraining Bridges\u2019 (CBs). Intriguingly, the number of CBs (ncb) remains finite when increasing the number of bridges nb (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 reports the average (\u3008ncb\u3009) and the variance of the number of CBs as a function of nb. The CBs can be defined as the smallest subset of bridges that,\nwhen joined by circle arcs of radius R, contain all the remaining nb\u2212ncb points (Fig. 2b). The sets of CBs are then similar to the vertices of a convex hull27,28 with the difference for convex hulls being that the edges between the points on the border are straight lines (SI Fig. 1) rather than the arcs shown in Fig. 2b. This key observation justifies the fact that, contrary to what is observed in Fig. 3, the number of points belonging to the convex hull diverges logarithmically with nb\n27,28. Notice, for instance, that the stretching of two bridges far away\n4 from each other towards the particle\u2019s border pins the particle in a single configuration and would impede any other bridge from touching the perimeter (right panel of SI Fig. 1).\nWe define by Aout the area of the region outside the\ncurved polygon identified by the CBs (Fig. 2b). Aout will be used in the next section to estimate the probability that \u2126 changes following the formation of a new bridge.\nWe now consider the case in which bridges break and form (corresponding to points that disappear and appear in Fig. 2a) with a rate constant equal to kTon and koff , respectively. We decompose the motion of the particle into two components. At short timescales, the particle rattles around the current CBs. At larger timescales, comparable or larger than the lifetime of a given set of CBs (\u03c4cb), the particle is driven by the diffusive motion of the CBs29. Hence, the emerging mobility of the particle is controlled by \u03c4cb and the typical displacement of the particle following an update of the CBs, \u03b4cb. These two quantities are discussed in the next two sections (Secs. III B and III C). First, notice that these two dynamics are not strictly independent as possible updates of the CBs depend on the actual position of the particle. Second, this decomposition is valid only in the limit in which the particle can explore an area comparable with \u2126 (Fig. 2c and Fig. 4) before the next update of the CBs takes place. This is often the case given that the system explores the polygon with a diffusion constant D0 with D0 = 10\n6 \u2212 104 nm2/s for micrometer-nanometer particles."

In event b, a receptor belonging to the CBs unbinds. Notice how both events could, in principle, add/remove multiple bridges to/from the set of CBs. For instance, in an event of type a, the new bound receptor could prevent some of the existing CBs from touching the perimeter. The rate at which an event of type a happens is given by ka = k T onAout/Atot. As defined before, k T on is the rate of forming any bridge, contained or not by the CBs. Events of type b happen with a rate kb = koffncb. koff is the rate at which a single bridge breaks (Fig. 1c). Instead, kTon reads as kTon = kon \u00b7n` \u00b7nr, where kon is the rate at which a bridge form from a given ligand\u2013receptor pair (Fig. 1c) and n` (nr) is the number of free ligands (receptors covered by the disk). If the number of bound receptors nb is steady (nb = \u3008nb\u3009), the rates of forming and destroying a bridge are equal (kTon = koff\u3008nb\u3009). This equality allows expressing the average values of ka and kb as a function of koff and geometric factors\n\u3008ka\u3009 = koff\u3008nb\u3009 \u3008Aout\u3009 Atot\n\u3008kb\u3009 = koff\u3008ncb\u3009 , (1)\nwhere Atot = \u03c0R 2 and we neglect correlations between fluctuations in nb and Aout. The average rate at which sets of CBs are reconfigured is then given by \u3008\u03c4cp\u3009\u22121 = \u3008ka\u3009 + \u3008kb\u3009 (where we treat events a and b as independent). Notice that events of type a are the reverse of events of type b. These two types of events decrease and increase Aout by the same quantity. Therefore, in steady conditions, we have \u3008ka\u3009 = \u3008kb\u3009. From Eq. 1 we then derive\n\u3008Aout\u3009 = \u03c0R2 \u3008ncb\u3009 \u3008nb\u3009\n\u3008\u03c4cb\u3009 = 1\n2koff\u3008ncb\u3009 .

In Fig. 4 we also sample the average area (\u3008|\u2126|\u3009) of the configurational space \u2126 (Fig. 2c).\n5 Given that the distance between the outer-most bridges and the disk\u2019s border scales like 1/\u3008nb\u3009, we expect that the disk could move along a given direction by a displacement \u03b4`, \u03b4` \u223c 1/\u3008nb\u3009.

For a given set of CBs, we sample the position of the disk center, x(\u2126), by generating points inside \u2126 as done in Fig. 2c. While exploring \u2126, we attempt either to add or remove bridges. The probability of adding and removing a bridge are given in SI Sec. 1. Once a reaction move changes the set of CBs, we estimate the average position of the disk for the new set of CBs, x(\u2126\u2032), and calculate \u03b4cb = |x(\u2126\u2032) \u2212 x(\u2126)|. By repeating the procedure, we obtain the distribution of \u03c4cb (Fig. 5) and of \u03b4cb (Fig. 6).\nIn Figs. 5 & 6 symbols refer to systems with an average number of bridges ranging from \u3008nb\u3009 = 5 to \u3008nb\u3009 = 5120 (as in Figs. 3, 4).

Emerging diffusion constant (D)\nHaving estimated \u03c4cb and \u03b4cb, we are now in a position to predict the emerging diffusion constant D. The dynamics is limited by the reaction rates if D0\u3008\u03c4cb\u3009 \u2265 \u3008|\u2126|\u3009. This inequality certainly holds in the large \u3008nb\u3009 limit where \u3008|\u2126|\u3009 \u223c \u3008nb\u3009\u22122 (Eq. 3) and \u3008\u03c4cb\u3009 \u223c 1 (Eq. 2). In a time interval \u2206T , the average displacement of the particle will be (neglecting correlations between sequential values of \u03b4cb)\n\u3008\u2206x2\u3009 = \u2206T\u3008\u03c4cp\u3009 \u3008\u03b4cb\u30092 = 2D\u2206T (5)\nfrom which we extract\nD = koff\u03c0R\n2\n\u3008nb\u30092 . (6)\nFor a molecular walker (Fig. 1b), Ref. 25 recently reported the following expression for D\nD = 1\n2 konkoff kon + koff\nR2\n\u3008nb\u30092 , (7)\nwhere R is now the length of the walker\u2019s branches. This contribution identified the time-step (\u3008\u03c4\u3009) of the coarse-grained dynamics with the time taken to a single ligand to bind and sequentially unbind a receptor (\u3008\u03c4\u3009 = k\u22121on + k\u22121off , when neglecting avidity terms in the binding event). Ref. 25 then derived Eq. 7 by fitting simulation results (with \u3008nb\u3009 < 16) with D \u223c \u3008\u03b4\u30092/\u3008\u03c4\u3009 and \u3008\u03b4\u30092 \u223c \u3008nb\u3009\u22122 (guessed from a relation similar to Eq. 3). As compared to Ref. 25, we provide a microscopic definition of \u3008\u03c4\u3009 based on the identification of the set of constraining bridges.\nIt may look surprising that in Eq. 6 D increases with the radius of the disk R. However, Eq. 6 holds only if the unconstrained diffusion constant D0 is sufficiently high to allow the particle to sample the configurational space \u2126 for timescales smaller or comparable with \u3008\u03c4cb\u3009. Such an approximation, for a given number of bridges nb, breaks down for sufficiently large values of R. In such a limit, D will be limited by D0. Secondly, when comparing disks coated with the same density of ligands, \u3008nb\u3009 would scale with the area of the disk resulting in a diffusion coefficient scaling as D \u223c 1/R2.\nEq. 6 predicts how the ligand/receptor densities affect the mobility of the system only through \u3008nb\u3009. This observation explains why colloids functionalized with higher\n6 densities of ligands crystallize better23. Indeed, higher coatings increase the multivalent effect and therefore the melting temperature and koff at the melting.\nIn Sec. V, we generalise Eq. 6 to the case of fixed ligands."

The list of possible reactions include the breakage of a bridge and the binding of a free receptor to a free ligand. Consistently with the fact that we do not track the explicit position of the ligands (Sec.

To limit the number of rejets, we use the results of the previous section to gauge NB as a function of \u2206t, D0, and \u3008\u03b4cb\u3009. Understanding the impact of different reaction\u2013diffusion algorithms31 on the mobility of the particle deserves future investigations. We consider a disk of radius R = 100 nm placed at the center of a square with side equal to 1\u00b5m. We cover the surface with NR = 17777 randomly distributed receptors corresponding to an average receptor\u2013receptor distance equal to d = 7.5 nm. This is a typical coverage density usually employed, for instance, in experiments with ligands/receptors made of DNA oligomers2,32. We do not expect that using regularly distributed receptors would have a major impact on the results of this section25. The surface of the disk is covered with NL = 558 mobile ligands, matching the receptor density. The on\u2013 and off\u2013 rates, for flexible ligands, can be calculated as2,33\nkon = \u03b3kon,0 \u03c0R2L\nkoff = \u03b3kon,0 Keq = \u03b3kon,0KD , (9)\nwhere Keq, KD, and kon,0 are, respectively, the equilibrium costant, the dissociation constant, and the on rate measured for ligands and receptors free in solution (i.e. not anchored to the particle and surface). L is a length comparable with the size of the ligands. \u03b3 (\u03b3 < 1) is a non-dimensional term accounting for the fact that the diffusion constants of anchored ligands/receptors are reduced as a result, e.g., of the drag exherted by the bilayer onto the anchoring point32,34,35 or by the solvent onto the polymeric backbone supporting the reactive complex36. kon,0 can span multiple orders of magnitudes (e.g., Refs. 21, 37, and 38) and is always smaller than the diffusion\u2013limited value k (dl) on,0 \u2248 108M\u22121s\u22121 (where M is the molarity unit, 1 \u00b7M = 0.602 nm\u22123), calculated using the Smoluchowski\u2019s equation for a nanometer\u2013size probe. Importantly, our simulations model bridge formation/denaturation as Poissonian events and therefore neglect rebinding events39. This is not expected to be a serious drawback as the emergent diffusion is order of magnitudes smaller than the diffusions constant of the ligands (which could be \u2248 \u00b5m2/s). The calculation of the on/off rates of ligands tethered to a surface is currently debated40.\nFig. 7 reports our simulation results for the mobile ligand system with \u3008nb\u3009 = 111. Fig. 7a (left) shows the two configurational spaces (\u21261 and \u21262) sampled by an \u2248 2 \u00b7 10\u22123s trajectory. Figs. 7a (center and right) show the center of mass trajectory (points) while constrained to remain in \u21261 and \u21262, respectively. Notice that the trajectory exploring \u21261 is much shorter than the one constrained by \u21262. The variability of the trajectory length is related to the stochastic nature of \u03c4cb. Importantly, in both cases, the trajectories can travel a distance comparable to the size of \u2126i. This justifies the assumptions employed in the previous section and clarifies how the long-time diffusion is controlled by the evolution of \u2126 arising from the formation/rupture of bridges.\nIn Fig. 7b, we report the mean squared displacement\n7 for two pairs of on and off rates with kon/koff constant (resulting in the same \u3008nb\u3009). In both cases, we show how Eq. 6 predictions agree with simulation results. A validation employing different \u3008nb\u3009 is presented in the next section. The simulation programs employed to obtain Fig. 7b is available online41."

            "heading": "V. FIXED LIGANDS",
            "text": "We now discuss the case in which ligands are not mobile but fixed to the surface of the particle. We define by r (L) i the coordinates of the ligands\u2019 tethering points (square symbols in Fig. 8a). A receptor, grafted in r (R) i , can then form a bridge with ligand i if |r(R)i \u2212 r (L) i | < \u03bb, where \u03bb is the maximal lateral distance between the tethering points of a ligand\u2013receptor pair forming a bridge. For a given set of bridges, the possible configurations of the particle are then the ones in which none bound receptor exits the circle of radius \u03bb centered over the conjugated ligand (dashed circles in Fig. 8a). By shifting all the bound receptor\u2019s position by the position of the corresponding conjugated ligand (r (R) i \u2192 r (R) i \u2212 r (L) i ), as done in Fig. 8b, we show how the possible configurations of the particle (for a given orientation) correspond to the possible configurations of a disk of radius \u03bb with mobile ligands binding uniformly distributed receptors (Fig. 2). In particular, the area available to the center of the particle with fixed ligands (for a given orientation) will follow from the expression of \u3008|\u2126|\u3009 (Eq. 3) by replacing R with \u03bb. Similarly, \u03bb replaces R in the average displacement \u3008\u03b4cb\u3009 (Eq. 4), while the average time to reconfigure a set of constraining bridges \u3008\u03c4cb\u3009 (Eq. 2) does not change. Finally, the sliding diffusion constant will mimic Eq. 6 as\nfollows\nDfixed = koff\u03c0\u03bb\n2\n\u3008nb\u30092 . (10)\nThe previous equation implies that, if \u03bb R, the emerging diffusion for fixed ligands will be much smaller than for mobile ligands. Moreover, the configurational area available to the particle\u2019s center of mass will also decrease. The latter observation implies that the assumptions underlying Eq. 6 are less severe in the present case: the trajectory will have the same time (\u03c4cb) to explore configurational spaces (\u2126i) smaller than the ones considered in Fig. 7a.\nTo validate Eq. 10, we simulate a d =100 nm diameter disk carrying NL = 200 randomly distributed ligands and a surface featuring 0.1 receptors/nm\u22122. As for mobile ligands, we do not expect that major differences would arise from using surfaces with regular patterns of ligands/receptors (except for settings in which bridges could form only in particular alignment conditions). Ligands can bind receptors placed at a lateral distance smaller than \u03bb = 10.0 nm (Fig. 8). For fixed ligands, the relations between kon, koff and kon,0, koff,0 are different from what stated by Eq. 9. In general, kon and/or koff are also a function of the relative distance between the tethering points (e.g. Ref. 2). In this section, consistent with the fact that bridges do not exert any force onto the particle when the distance between tethering points is smaller than \u03bb, we consider configuration\u2013independent rates. This choice is consistent with previous literature (e.g. 20). In Sec. VI, we discuss how different bond potentials between bridged tethering points could affect our findings.\nGiven that ligands are fixed, the particle\u2019s orientation, \u03b8, is a non\u2013degenerate variable. In particular, the system features an emerging rotational diffusion constant, D\u03b8. The (rotational) diffusion constant of the free particle is D0 = 10\n5 nm2/s (D\u03b8,0 = 100 rad/s). As found in Sec. IV, in the limit of validity of the theory, D0 and D\u03b8,0 do not affect the emerging diffusion constants (Dfixed and D\u03b8). In all simulations, we use \u2206t = 10\u22125 s and NB = 10 (Sec. IV).\nFigs. 9a and 9b report simulation results for Dfixed as a function of \u3008nb\u3009. We consider sets of runs with koff constant and different kon (Fig. 9a) and sets with kon constant and different koff (Fig. 9b). The resulting average number of bridges ranges between \u3008nb\u3009 \u2248 8 and \u3008nb\u3009 \u2248 100. Systems with koff constant can be directly compared with Eq. 10 (dashed lines in Fig. 9a). For the simulations at constant kon, the predictions of Eq. 10 are given by the horizontal dashed lines calculated using the different koff employed by the simulations. In the large NL limit (at constant \u3008nb\u3009), it can be shown that, for constant kon, Dfixed decreases as 1/\u3008nb\u30093 (SI Sec. IV). Overall, the simulation results of Fig. 9a are in excellent agreement with Eq. 10 for all values of kon and koff . Dfixed is not a function of the particle\u2019s shape, as highlighted by the geometric construction in Fig. 8 and SI\n8\nFig. 3a. In particular, contrarily to D0, Dfixed is always isotropic.\nFrom the simulation results, it is not immediate to speculate about systematic errors in Eqs. 6 and 10. Our theory neglects that, for low values of \u3008nb\u3009, the emerging diffusion constant could be limited by D0. However, in Figs. 7b, 9a, and 9b, the theory overestimates simulations rarely. Possible systematic errors could arise from treating successive unit displacements \u03b4cb as independent variables while some degree of correlation is expected given that successive \u2126i share a subset of constraining bridges. A detailed study of the statistical properties of the coarse-grained dynamics underlying our model deserves future investigations.\nFig. 9c and SI Fig. 2 report the results for the rotational diffusion constant, D\u03b8 vs nb, at constant koff (Fig. 9c) and kon (SI Fig. 2). D\u03b8 mimics the trends observed for Dfixed. By fitting the data points at constant koff (Fig. 9c) we find\nD\u03b8 = c koff\u03c0\n\u3008nb\u30092 (11)\nwith c \u2248 0.13. Contrarily to what observed for Dfixed, D\u03b8 is affected by the shape of the particle. In particular, D\u03b8 decreases when considering more elongated particles (SI Fig. 3b). The simulation programs employed to obtain Fig. 9 is available online42."

            "heading": "VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this paper we have derived two simple equations (Eqs. 6, 10) for the emergent sliding diffusion constant of particles bound to a surface through reversible linkages. We validated the theoretical predictions by employing reaction diffusion simulations. The diffusion constant is\ncontrolled by the rate at which ligand\u2013receptor pairs unbind (koff), the average number of bridges (\u3008nb\u3009), and the area of the surface accessible to a single ligand (\u03c0R2 in Eq. 6 or \u03c0\u03bb2 in Eq. 10). Our results strictly apply to the case of fixed receptors. For mobile receptors, particles anchored to a surface through static bridges can laterally diffuse34,35.\nRef. 17 recently presented numerical and analytic predictions of the emerging sliding diffusion of a 1D system. As compared to our setting, this contribution employs harmonic (rather than square-well) bond potentials h (Fig. 1c) to model the forces exerted by the bridges onto the particle. The prediction of Ref. 17 for D (in the large \u3008nb\u3009 limit) reads as follows\nD = kBT\n\u0393 + \u3008nb\u3009\u03b3 + \u3008nb\u3009 kkoff + \u3008nb\u3009 \u03b3kon koff\n, (12)\nwhere \u0393 and \u03b3 are the friction coefficients controlling the diffusion of the free particle (D0 = kBT/\u0393) and of the reactive tips of the ligands, while k is the spring constant of the bond potential. Ref. 17 predicts how, for \u3008nb\u3009 \u2192 0, the emerging sliding diffusion is limited by D0. In the many\u2013bridge limit, it predicts a 1/\u3008nb\u3009 scaling law which is in contrast with Eqs. 6 & 10. Such a disagreement unlikely arises from the fact that Ref. 17 employs a 1D system. Indeed, adapting our model to a 1D system would not impact the 1/\u3008nb\u30092 scaling found in Eqs. 6, 10. It sounds more reasonable that the two different types of bond potentials could play a crucial role. This observation points to the fact that polymeric details of the ligand/receptor molecules, not directly linked to the rate coefficients (kon,0 and koff), may have a major impact on the mobility of the particle. The bond potential is largely tunable. For instance, ligands resembling fully flexible ideal polymers or thin rods would result, respectively, in a quadratic and logarithmic bond potential43.\n9 Existing literature in biophysics, employing models with cross-linked objects, already reported emerging friction terms \u03b6 (\u03b6 \u223c 1/D) which are non\u2013linear in the number of crosslinkers. For instance, Wierenga et al.44 show how the friction between two sliding cytoskeletal filaments is super exponential in the number of crosslinkers, \u3008nb\u3009. In this system, the highly non-linear increase of \u03b6 in \u3008nb\u3009 arises from the necessity of having a specific sequence of \u3008nb\u3009 unbinding-rebinding events to observe a net (O(1)) relative displacement of the filaments. Intriguingly, cooperative effects may also reduce the friction constant. For instance, Fogelson et al.45 study monovalent particles diffusing over a substrate decorated by receptors. In this system, multiple particles diffuse faster (as compared to a diluted system) as a result of an effective repulsive force mediated by the functionalized surface.\nWhen comparing the predictions of Eqs. 6, 10 with experiments employing spherical particles, one should consider that the latter tend to roll rather than slide15,16. The prediction of the emergent rotational diffusion constant deserves future investigations. As compared to the present investigation, Ref. 16 studied large rates constants (kon,0 \u2265 106 M\u22121s\u22121). Due to the short simulation times employed (milliseconds rather than seconds as in this study), Ref. 16 did not detect sliding motion for small kon,0 and large nb. In the regime of validity of Eqs. 6 & 10, we predict how the diffusion constant is not a function of the drag exerted by the medium onto the particle. This result could be tested in experiments, for instance, by adding inert polymers to increase the viscosity of the medium without affecting the biochemistry of the system. On the other hand, sliding is likely the major component of the mobility of non-spherical particles, like the elongated form of Influenza A Virus (IAV)20. However, it is believed that IAV particles achieve their mobility because of the catalytic effect of neuramidase ligands cleaving the sialic acid present on the receptors19. The outcomes of the present study (as well as Refs. 17 and 25) will help quantitatively assess the contribution to the mobility of the particle due to the presence of activity in IAV and other biological systems. Finally, for fixed ligands, we predict that elongated particles would diffuse homogeneously. This observation will allow for the detection of catalytic activity which has been shown to be responsible for persistent motions19.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSee supplementary material for figures supporting the claims made in the manuscript and details about the simulation alghoritms."

BrownianDiffusion(\u2206t\u2032) attempts a Brownian dynamics step which is accepted unless a bridge exits from the disk perimeter (for mobile ligands) or becomes overstretched (when the ligand-receptor distance becomes larger than \u03bb, for fixed ligands).\nFire Reactions() and Brownian Diffusion() require the list of all the receptors which could potentially form a bridge. We update this list using Verlet lists. For mobile ligands, we initialise a single Verlet list including all the receptors found at a distance smaller than \u03c3 from the edge of the disk (see Fig. 4). For fixed ligands, we use a different Verlet list for each ligand i listing all the receptors closer than d to i (d > \u03bb)."

NR is a function of the disk\u2019s position and is updated using the Verlet lists described in the previous section. In view of the ligands\u2019 mobility, we use a well-stirred approximation in which a receptor can bind to all free ligands belonging to the disk with a rate constant equal to kon. The Gillespie algorithm samples the next reaction to be fired (with a probability proportional to its affinity, line 5 below) along with the time for it to happen, treac. treac is sampled from a Poisson distribution with average equal to 1/aT , aT = aTon + a T off (line 3 below).

In Eq. 7, the fact that n (mobile) ` n (fixed) ` is compensated by the fact that, for mobile ligands, kon accounts also for the entropic cost of localizing a ligand in the proximity of a fixed receptor (see the \u03c0R2 term in the definition of koff , Main Eqs. 9).\nUsing Eq. 7, we derive the following expression for the emerging diffusion constant expressed as a function of kon\nD = konnrn\n(X) ` A\n\u3008nb\u30093 (8)\nwhere A = \u03c0R2 and A = \u03c0\u03bb2, respectively, for mobile and fixed ligands.
