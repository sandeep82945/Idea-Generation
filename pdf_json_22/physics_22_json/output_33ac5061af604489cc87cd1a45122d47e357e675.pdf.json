            "text": "Inverse problems of determining unknown excitations or scattering inclusions by acoustic waves appear in diverse areas of scientific and engineering importance, e.g., nondestructive evaluation, sonar detection, and ultrasonic tomography. In many areas of applied sciences, it is very difficult or extremely expensive to access the phased data of the complex-valued time-harmonic wave field, while the phaseless/modulus data is usually much cheaper to acquire [12, 17, 20]. Hence, reconstruction from phaseless data is both theoretically and practically important and has received considerable attention in the literature in recent years [1, 7, 13, 16, 19, 22, 23, 27]. Recently, there is also a surge of interest in the co-inversion problem of simultaneously recovering the source term and the passive inhomogeneity from the scattering measurements, see, e.g. [3, 4, 9, 14, 15]. However, to our knowledge, the simultaneous reconstruction of source and scatterer from phaseless data has not yet been studied in the existing literature.\nIn this paper, we investigate a new model of simultaneously reconstructing the point sources and the impenetrable obstacle from phaseless scattering data. This phaseless co-inversion problem suffers from the drastic difficulties of nonlinearity and severe ill-posedness, in particular, the dual unknowns and the loss of phase information substantially obstruct the application of algorithms\n\u2217School of Mathematics, Jilin University, Changchun, China, dyzhang@jlu.edu.cn \u2020School of Mathematics, Jilin University, Changchun, China, wuy20@mails.jlu.edu.cn \u2021School of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China. ykguo@hit.edu.cn (Corresponding author)\nfor phased inverse scattering problems. Meanwhile, it is well acknowledged that a lack of information cannot be remedied by merely the mathematical implementation itself and therefore the incorporation of additional information is indispensable for achieving effective reconstruction. To this end, motivated by the techniques of artificial reference sources/objects for phaseless inverse scattering problems [8, 10, 11, 25, 21, 24], as well as the recent decoupling strategy for the interior co-inversion problem [26], in the current work we propose a novel method for tackling the challenging phaseless co-inversion problem. The basic idea of our method is to decode the source and scatterer components from the scattering system with the help of the additional illuminations due to the so-called reference sources. These artificially appended sources play a significant role in decoupling the co-inversion problem into the usual inverse source subproblem and inverse obstacle scattering subproblems. Then the uniqueness issue on these subproblems could be separately analyzed, namely, the shape of the scatterer together with the boundary condition could be uniquely determined, meanwhile, the unknown source locations can be also uniquely identified. Moreover, the decoupled subproblems can be numerically treated easily by the direct sampling scheme and the reverse time migration method, respectively. The overall algorithm works with the data due to only a single frequency and does not rely on any solver of the forward problem. Since the computational demanding process is not involved, the proposed method can be implemented easily. In addition, neither the number of obstacles nor the boundary conditions are required to be priorly known. In our view, the aforementioned features of our study constitute the noteworthy novelty of this article.\nThe remaining part of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the mathematical formulation of the phaseless co-inversion problem as well as the incorporation of reference sources. In Section 3, the theoretical results are provided to justify the unique identifiability of underlying sources and obstacles from the modulus of near-field measurements. In Section 4, the phaseless co-inversion problem is decoupled into two subproblems of inverse obstacle scattering and inverse source problem. Then the subproblems are tackled respectively with direct imaging indicators. The indicating behavior for locating the sources is analyzed as well. Numerical experiments are presented in Section 5 to confirm the theoretical analysis of our inversion process and illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our newly proposed phaseless co-inversion algorithm."

            "text": "We begin this section by introducing the phaseless co-inversion problem of an obstacle and its excitation point sources under consideration. Let D \u2282 R2 be a simply connected bounded domain with C2 boundary \u2202D. For a generic point z \u2208 R2\\D, the incident field ui due to the point source located at z is given by\nui(x; z) = i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (k|x\u2212 z|), x \u2208 R2\\(D \u222a {z}), (1)\nwhere H (1) 0 is the Hankel function of the first kind of order zero, and k > 0 is the wavenumber. Then, the forward scattering problem can be stated as follows: given the source point z and the obstacle D, find the scattered field us(x; z) which satisfies the following boundary value problem\n(see [6]):\n\u2206us + k2us = 0 in R2\\D, (2) Bu = 0 on \u2202D, (3)\nlim r:=|x|\u2192\u221e\n\u221a r ( \u2202us\n\u2202r \u2212 ikus\n)\n= 0, (4)\nwhere u(x; z) = ui(x; z) + us(x; z) denotes the total field and (4) is the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Here B in (3) is the boundary operator defined by\nBu =\n\n\n\nu, for a sound-soft obstacle, \u2202u \u2202\u03bd + ik\u03bbu, for an impedance obstacle.\n(5)\nwhere \u03bd is the unit outward normal to \u2202D and \u03bb is a real parameter. This boundary condition (5) covers the Dirichlet/sound-soft boundary condition, the Neumann/sound-hard boundary condition (\u03bb = 0), and the impedance boundary condition (\u03bb 6= 0). It is well known that the forward scattering problem (2)-(4) admits a unique solution us \u2208 H1loc(R2\\D) (see, e.g., [6, 18]), and the scattered wave us has the following asymptotic behavior\nus(x; z) = eik|x| \u221a\n|x|\n{ u\u221e(x\u0302; z) +O ( 1\n|x|\n)}\n, |x| \u2192 \u221e\nuniformly in all observation directions x\u0302 = x/|x| \u2208 S1 := {x \u2208 R2 : |x| = 1}. The complex-valued analytic function u\u221e(x\u0302; z) defined on the unit circle S1 is called the far field pattern or scattering amplitude (see [6]).\nLet zj \u2208 R2\\D (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N) be mutually distinct source points, P := \u222aNj=1{zj}, B\u03c1 = {x \u2208 R 2 : |x| < \u03c1} and \u0393\u03c1 = \u2202B\u03c1, such that ( D \u222a P )\n\u2282 B\u03c1. Assume that \u0393R = \u2202BR is the measurement curve with BR = {x \u2208 R2 : |x| < R} and R > \u03c1. Denote the superposition of wave fields by\nw(x;P ) = N \u2211\nj=1\nw(x; zj), zj \u2208 P, j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N,\nwith w in place of ui, us, u or u\u221e, accordingly. Then, the phaseless co-inversion problem under consideration is to determine the obstacle-source pair (\u2202D, P ) from the phaseless measurements {|u(x;P )| : x \u2208 \u0393R}.\nTo our knowledge, this model inverse problem as well as its uniqueness issue were not studied in the literature. Motivated by the reference point techniques for tackling the phaseless inverse scattering problem, we will consider incorporating artificial point sources into the co-inversion system. Let z1, z2 \u2208 R2\\(D \u222aP ) be two additional source points and t1, t2 \u2208 R. By the linearity of the direct scattering problem, the total field produced by the incident waves ui(x;P )+ t1u\ni(x; z1)+ t2u i(x; z2) is given by\nu(x;P, t1z1, t2z2) := u(x;P ) + t1u(x; z1) + t2u(x; z2), x \u2208 R2\\(D \u222a P \u222a {z1, z2}),\nTo introduce the phaseless co-inversion problem with artificial sources, we also need the following definition of the admissible curve.\nDefinition 2.1 ([23]). (Admissible curve) An open curve \u0393 is called an admissible curve with respect to domain \u2126 if\n(i) \u2126 is simply-connected;\n(ii) \u2202\u2126 is analytic homeomorphic to S1;\n(iii) k2 is not a Dirichlet eigenvalue of \u2212\u2206 in \u2126;\n(iv) \u0393 \u2282 \u2202\u2126 is a one-dimensional analytic manifold with nonvanishing measure.\nNow, the phaseless co-inversion problem with artificial sources under consideration can be stated as the following.\nProblem 2.1 (Phaseless co-inversion problem).

            "text": "In this section, we present the uniqueness result on Problem 2.1, which shows that the location of the point sources, the location and shape \u2202D, as well as the boundary condition B for the obstacle, can be simultaneously and uniquely determined from the modulus of near-fields.\nTheorem 3.1. Let D1 and D2 be two obstacles with boundary conditions B1 and B2, and P1 and P2 be two sets of source points, such that \u222a2j=1(Dj\u222aPj) \u2282 B\u03c1 \u2282 BR. Assume that \u0393 is an admissible curve for G with G \u2282 BR\\B\u03c1. The scattered field and the total field with respect to Dj \u222a Pj and Dj \u222a {z} are denoted by usj(x;Pj), uj(x;Pj), usj(x; z) and uj(x; z), j = 1, 2, respectively. If the near-fields satisfy that\n|u1(x;P1)| = |u2(x;P2)|, \u2200x \u2208 \u0393R, (6) |u1(x;P1, t\u2113z)| = |u2(x;P2, t\u2113z)|, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393), \u2113 = 1, 2, (7) |u1(x;P1, t\u2113z0)| = |u2(x;P2, t\u2113z0)|, \u2200x \u2208 \u0393R, \u2113 = 1, 2, (8) |u1(x;P1, t\u2113z0, t\u2113z)| = |u2(x;P2, t\u2113z0, t\u2113z)|, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393), \u2113 = 1, 2, (9)\nfor an arbitrarily fixed wavenumber k, a fixed z0 \u2208 R2\\B\u03c1 and two positive constants t1, t2 with t1 6= t2. Then we have D1 = D2,B1 = B2 and P1 = P2.\nProof. The proof is divided into two parts. (i) Uniqueness for the obstacle. From (6) and (7), we have for all x \u2208 \u0393R, z \u2208 \u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393 and \u2113 = 1, 2,\nt\u2113 ( |u1(x; z)|2 \u2212 |u2(x; z)|2 ) = 2Re ( u2(x;P2)u2(x; z)\u2212 u1(x;P1)u1(x; z) )\nwhere the overline denotes the complex conjugate. Further, by t\u2113 > 0 (\u2113 = 1, 2) and t1 6= t2, we obtain\n|u1(x; z)| = |u2(x; z)|, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393), (10)\nRe ( u1(x;P1)u1(x; z) ) = Re ( u2(x;P2)u2(x; z) ) , \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393). (11)\nSimilarly, from (6), (8) and (9), we deduce that\n|u1(x; z0)| = |u2(x; z0)|, \u2200x \u2208 \u0393R, (12) |u1(x; z, z0)| = |u2(x; z, z0)|, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393). (13)\nBy using (10), (12) and (13), it can be seen that for all x \u2208 \u0393R, z \u2208 \u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393,\nRe ( u1(x; z0)u1(x; z) ) = Re ( u2(x; z0)u2(x; z) ) .\nThen, following a similar argument of (12) and (13) in Theorem 2.2 in [23], we know that\nu1(x; z) = e i\u03b3(x)u2(x; z), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u03930R \u00d7 (\u03930\u03c1 \u222a \u03930) (14)\nor u1(x; z) = e\ni\u03b7(x)u2(x; z), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u03930R \u00d7 (\u03930\u03c1 \u222a \u03930), (15) where \u03b3(x), \u03b7(x) are real-valued functions, and \u03930R \u2286 \u0393R, \u03930\u03c1 \u2286 \u0393\u03c1,\u03930 \u2286 \u0393 are open sets.\nFirst, we consider the case (14). From the reciprocity relation [2, Theorem 3] for point sources, we see\nei\u03b3(z)u2(z;x) = u1(z;x) = u1(x; z) = e i\u03b3(x)u2(x; z), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u03930R \u00d7 \u03930\u03c1,\nwhich yields \u03b3(x) = \u03b3, where \u03b3 is a constant. Then, the analyticity of uj(x; z)(j = 1, 2) with respect to x leads to u1(x; z) = e\ni\u03b3u2(x; z) for all (x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 \u03930\u03c1. Then, from the uniqueness of the obstacle scattering problem in R2\\BR and the analyticity of uj(x; z)(j = 1, 2), we have\nu1(x; z) = e i\u03b3u2(x; z), \u2200x \u2208 R2\\(D1 \u222aD2 \u222a {z}),\ni.e., for all x \u2208 R2\\(D1 \u222aD2 \u222a {z}),\nus1(x; z) + i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (k|x\u2212 z|) = ei\u03b3\n(\nus2(x; z) + i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (k|x\u2212 z|)\n)\n.\nNow, by letting x \u2192 z and the boundedness of the scattered field usj(x; z)(j = 1, 2), we find ei\u03b3 = 1, and thus the far-field patterns coincide, i.e.\nu\u221e1 (x\u0302; z) = u \u221e 2 (x\u0302; z), \u2200(z, x\u0302) \u2208 \u03930\u03c1 \u00d7 S1,\nwhich, together with the mixed reciprocity relation [6, Theorem 3.24], yields\nvs1(z;\u2212x\u0302) = vs2(z;\u2212x\u0302), \u2200(z, x\u0302) \u2208 \u03930\u03c1 \u00d7 S1,\nwhere vsj (x; d), x \u2208 R2\\Dj, d \u2208 S1, is the scattered field generated by the obstacleD and the incident plane wave vi(x; d) = eikx\u00b7d, j = 1, 2. Further, from the analyticity of vsj (x; d)(j = 1, 2) with respect to x, we have vs1(x; d) = v s 2(x; d) for all x \u2208 \u0393\u03c1, d \u2208 S1. And the uniqueness of the exterior scattering in R2\\BR implies that v\u221e1 (x\u0302; d) = v \u221e 2 (x\u0302; d), \u2200x\u0302, d \u2208 S1. (16)\nNext, we are going to show that the case (15) does not hold. Suppose that (15) holds. From the reciprocity relation [2, Theorem 3] for point sources, we see\nu1(z;x) = e i\u03b7(x)u2(z;x), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u03930R \u00d7 \u03930.\nThen, the analyticity of uj(z;x)(j = 1, 2) with respect to z leads to u1(z;x) = e i\u03b7(x)u2(z;x) for all (x, z) \u2208 \u03930R \u00d7 \u2202G. Let w(z;x) = u1(z;x)\u2212 ei\u03b7(x)u2(z;x), then {\n\u2206w + k2w = 0 in G,\nw = 0 on \u2202G.\nBy the assumption of G that k2 is not a Dirichlet eigenvalue of \u2212\u2206 in G, we obtain w = 0 in G. Again, from the analyticity of uj(z;x)(j = 1, 2) with respect to z, it can be seen that for every x \u2208 \u03930R,\nu1(z;x) = e i\u03b7(x)u2(z;x), \u2200z \u2208 R2\\(D1 \u222aD2 \u222a {x}),\ni.e., for all z \u2208 R2\\(D1 \u222aD2 \u222a {x}),\nus1(z;x) + i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (k|x\u2212 z|) = ei\u03b7(x)\n(\nus2(z;x)\u2212 i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (k|x\u2212 z|)\n)\n.\nNow, by letting z \u2192 x and the boundedness of the scattered field usj(z;x)(j = 1, 2), we find ei\u03b3(x) = 1, and u1(z;x) = u2(z;x), \u2200z \u2208 R2\\(D1 \u222aD2 \u222a {x}). By taking z = |z|z\u0302 and using the definition of far-field pattern (see [6, Theorem 2.6]), we obtain\nlim |z|\u2192\u221e\n|z|e\u2212ik|z|u1(|z|z\u0302;x) = u\u221e1 (z\u0302;x),\nlim |z|\u2192\u221e\n|z|eik|z|u2(|z|z\u0302;x) = u\u221e2 (z\u0302;x).\nNoticing u1(|z|z\u0302;x) = u2(|z|z\u0302;x) and u\u221e1 (z\u0302;x) 6= 0 for z\u0302 \u2208 S with some S \u2282 S1, we have\nlim |z|\u2192\u221e\ne2ik|z| = u\u221e2 (z\u0302;x)\nu\u221e1 (z\u0302;x) ,\nwhich is a contradiction. Hence, the case (15) does not hold. Having verified (16), by Theorem 5.6 in [6], we have D1 = D2 and B1 = B2. (ii) Uniqueness for the point sources. In the following, we will show that P1 = P2. Since the obstacle and its boundary condition are uniquely determined, we know u1(x; z) = u2(x; z) =: u(x; z) on \u0393R for z \u2208 \u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393. From (11), we have\nRe ( u(x;P1)u(x; z) ) = Re ( u(x;P2)u(x; z) ) , \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u0393R \u00d7 (\u0393\u03c1 \u222a \u0393). (17)\nAccording to (6), we denote\nu(x;Pj) = r(x)e i\u03b1j (x), u(x; z) = s(x, z)ei\u03b2(x,z),\nwhere r(x) = |u(x;Pj)|, s(x, z) = |u(x; z)|, \u03b1j(x) and \u03b2(x, z) are real-valued functions, j = 1, 2. Since \u0393 is an admissible curve of G, by Definition 2.1, the reciprocity relation [2, Theorem 3] and the analyticity of u(z;x) with respect to z, we have u(x; z) 6\u2261 0 for x \u2208 \u0393R, z \u2208 \u0393. Then, the continuity leads to u(x; z) 6= 0, \u2200x \u2208 \u039b1, z \u2208 \u03a3, where \u039b1 \u2286 \u0393R and \u03a3 \u2286 \u0393 are open sets. Similarly, by the analyticity and continuity of u(x;Pj)(j = 1, 2) with respect to x, we deduce u(x;Pj) 6= 0 for x \u2208 \u039b with an open set \u039b \u2286 \u039b1. Therefore, r(x) 6= 0, s(x, z) 6= 0, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3. Taking (17) into account, we derive that\ncos(\u03b11(x)\u2212 \u03b2(x, z)) = cos(\u03b12(x)\u2212 \u03b2(x, z)), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3.\nHence, either \u03b11(x) = \u03b12(x) + 2m\u03c0, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3 (18)\nor \u03b11(x) = \u2212\u03b12(x) + 2\u03b2(x, z) + 2m\u03c0, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3 (19)\nholds with some m \u2208 Z.\nFor case (18), it is easy to see that for all (x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3,\nu(x;P1) = r(x)e i\u03b11(x) = r(x)ei\u03b12(x)+i2m\u03c0 = u(x;P2),\nwhich, together with the analyticity of u(x;Pj)(j = 1, 2) and the uniqueness of the obstacle scattering problem in R2\\BR, yields\nu(x;P1) = u(x;P2), \u2200x \u2208 R2\\BR.\nAgain, by the analyticity of u(x;Pj), j = 1, 2, we obtain\nu(x;P1) = u(x;P2), \u2200x \u2208 R2\\(D \u222a P1 \u222a P2),\ni.e. for all x \u2208 R2\\(D \u222a P1 \u222a P2),\nus(x;P1) + u i(x;P1) = u s(x;P2) + u i(x;P2).\nSuppose P1 6= P2. Then, there exists a source point z\u2217 such that z\u2217 \u2208 P1 and z\u2217 /\u2208 P2. By the boundedness of us(x;Pj)(j = 1, 2) and z\n\u2217 /\u2208 P2 we have that u(x;P2) = us(x;P2) + ui(x;P2) is bounded as x \u2192 z\u2217. This is a contradiction since z\u2217 \u2208 P1 and u(x;P1) = us(x;P1) + ui(x;P1) is unbounded as x \u2192 z\u2217. Hence, we have P1 = P2.\nFinally, we will show that the case (19) does not hold. Suppose that (19) is true, then we have for all (x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7 \u03a3,\nu(x;P1)u(x; z) = r(x)e i\u03b11(x)s(x, z)e\u2212i\u03b2(x,z)\n= r(x)e\u2212i\u03b12(x)+i2m\u03c0s(x, z)ei\u03b2(x,z)\n= u(x;P2)u(x; z).\nBy the reciprocity relation [2, Theorem 3] and r(x) 6= 0, s(x, z) 6= 0, \u2200(x, z) \u2208 \u039b\u00d7\u03a3, we deduce that for x \u2208 \u039b,\nu(z;x) = u(x;P1)u(z;x)\nu(x;P2) , \u2200z \u2208 \u03a3.\nSince \u03a3 \u2286 \u0393 and \u0393 is an admissible curve of G, by definition 2.1 and the analyticity of u(z;x) with respect to z, we obtain that\nu(z;x) = u(x;P1)u(z;x)\nu(x;P2) , \u2200z \u2208 R2\\(D \u222a {x}).\nThen, a contradiction can be derived by a similar discussion of case (15). Hence the case (19) does not hold, which completes the proof.\nRemark 3.1. We would like to point out that this artificial source method can also be applied to a co-inversion problem with phase information, and the corresponding theory of uniqueness can be established easily since the co-inversion problem can be decoupled linearly by the artificial source technique."

            "text": "In this section, we present several numerical examples to demonstrate that our approach is effective for the reconstruction of sources and obstacles from phaseless measurements. Synthetic forward data is computed by the boundary integral equation method. To test the stability of our co-inversion scheme, we add some random perturbations to the synthetic data such that\n|u\u03b4| = |u|+ \u03b4r|u|\nwhere r is a uniform random number ranging from \u22121 to 1, and \u03b4 > 0 denotes the noise level.\nExample 5.1. In the first example, we consider the reconstruction of a sound-soft starfish-shaped obstacle whose boundary is given by the parametric form\nx(t) = (1 + 0.2 cos 5t)(cos t, sin t), 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0.\nIn Figure 2, we illustrate the reconstruction of the obstacle together with 4 sources located at (3, 1), (2, 2), (\u22121.5, 3) and (\u22122.5,\u22121.8). The wavenumber is fixed to be k = 4\u03c0 and the scaling parameter \u03c3 in Problem (4.2) is chosen as \u03c3 = 1. In Figure 2(a) for the model setup, the 128 receivers (denoted by small blue stars) and 128 reference points (denoted by small black points) are uniformly deployed on the circle centered at the origin with radius 10 and 9, respectively. The sampling points for the sources forms a 200\u00d7 200 uniformly spaced grid over [\u22125, 5]\u00d7 [\u22125, 5] while a 200\u00d7 200 uniformly spaced grid over [\u22122, 2]\u00d7 [\u22122, 2] is used for imaging the obstacle. The normalized indicator functions for imaging the sources and the obstacle are depicted in Figure 2(b)(d) and Figure 2(c)(e), respectively. In Figure 2(b)(d), the exact target sources are marked by the small red \u201c+\u201d and it can be seen that the recovered source locations match well with the significant local extreme values of the indicator function. In Figure 2(c)(e), the exact boundary of the scatterer is marked by the black dashed line. All these results demonstrate that the inversion algorithm performs well in identifying the locations of the point sources as well as the shape of the obstacle, provided that the noise level is sufficiently small.\nExample 5.2. In the second example, we test the inversion of a sound-hard peanut-shaped obstacle and 5 sources located at (3, 1), (2, 2), (\u22121.5, 3), (\u22122.5,\u22121.8) and (1,\u22122.6). The exact boundary of the obstacle is given by\nx(t) = \u221a 4 cos2 t+ sin2 t(cos t, sin t), 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0.\nThe wavenumber is chosen as k = 5\u03c0 and the scaling parameter is still \u03c3 = 1. In this example, 5% noise is added to the synthetic data. Similar to the first example, a 200\u00d7 200 sampling grid is adopted to image the sources and the obstacle, respectively. We refer to Figure 3 for the illustration of the model setup concerning this example. We also compare the performance of the full aperture measurements and limited observations. For the full aperture case, 160 sensors and 160 artificial sources are utilized, whereas only half of the sensors and artificial sources are available in the limited aperture case. It can be seen from Figure 3 that, due to the lack of information, the non-illuminated portion of the targets (both source and obstacle) could not be well reconstructed. Meanwhile, the illuminated parts can still be satisfactorily recovered.\nExample 5.3. In the last example, the co-inversion of two sound-soft obstacles and the corresponding source points is considered. The scatterer consists of a kite-shaped obstacle\nx(t) = (\u22122 + cos t+ 0.65 cos 2t\u2212 0.65, 2 + 1.5 sin t), 0 \u2264 t < 2\u03c0.\nand a unit disk centered at (3,\u22123). We set k = 18, \u03c3 = 1 and \u03b4 = 5% in this example. The receivers and reference sources are located uniformly on the circle with radii 15 and 14, respectively. For the reconstruction, here a 200\u00d7 200 sampling grid over [\u22126, 6]\u00d7 [\u22126, 6] is utilized to image the sources and obstacles. The reconstructions are demonstrated in Figure 4. One could easily observe that the quality of obstacle recovery deteriorates greatly as the number of measurements decreases. At first glance, it seems from Figure 4(c)(d) that the reconstruction of sources is not significantly affected by\nthe reduction of data. However, if we collect the coordinates of local maximizers over the sampling grid and compare them with the exact source points, then it can be immediately seen that the case of insufficient data would produce a mismatched reconstruction of one source point. This comparison is illustrated in Figure 5 where the exact target sources are marked by the small red \u201c+\u201d and the reconstructions are marked by the small black \u201c\u25e6\u201d. These results show that a diminution of the data could lead to incorrect reconstructions, hence the availability of adequate data is essential for the accuracy of recoveries."
