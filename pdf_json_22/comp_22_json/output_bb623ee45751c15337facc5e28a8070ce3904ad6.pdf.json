            "text": "Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is able to create virtual twins of physical objects in order to facilitate the processing of control and to manage cyber\u2010physical systems. DT can be exploited in networking and communications for many aspects, such as system modelling, physical data processing, cloud computing, and edge computing [2]. Therefore, studies of DT are attracting much attention from active researchers [3\u20136]. More specifically, in [3], a DT\u2010assisted task offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) was investigated to address the problem of minimising power and time\noverhead. Another work in reducing offloading latency for DT edge network was introduced in [4]. In [5], DT was proposed for intelligent authorisation in the beyond 5G smart grid applications. DT was exploited in [6, 7] to empower edge networks for the industrial Internet of things environment. These representative studies demonstrate the huge potential of DT in various domains, especially in networked systems.\nIn recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been under the spotlight due to their flexible configuration and mobile characteristics [8, 9]. Numerous research studies have been conducted to enhance the control performance of UAVs. In [10], authors carried out the ground test of UAV, evaluating the performance of its entire flight control system through rotor speed, roll attitude, etc. The flight test [11] and collision\nThis paper has been accepted in part for presentation in the first International Conference on 6G Networking (6GNet 2022) to be held on July 06\u201008, 2022 in Paris, France [1].\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors.

UAVs achieve even better performance in many research areas by combining with other advanced technologies. To integrate with the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) [13], a well\u2010performed UAV\u2010assisted IRS symbiotic radio system has been formed. The system performs better as data information is transferred via UAV by optimising the UAV trajectory and the IRS phase shifts. Applying a deep reinforcement learning algorithm [14], the decision making of UAVs can be autonomous rather than pre\u2010planned. UAV\u2019s low consumption of energy also attracts public attention. Through optimisation algorithms, resource allocation can be optimised, and the total energy consumption in a multi\u2010UAV network framework can be minimised [15, 16]. Based on their outstanding advantages, UAVs are now being developed and used in military and civil applications [17]. These applications are in many fields, such as environment monitoring, traffic control, public safety, damaged buildings detection, and industrial automation [18\u201320]. Particularly, with the help of UAV, Yang X et al. [21] develop a method for high\u2010precision geolocation of distant targets, which is more effective than the conventional one\u2010shot localisation way. Search and rescue operations with UAVs participation increase the speed of rescue and thus improve the survival rate of people [22, 23]. In Ref. [24], UAVs are used as flying base stations to ensure the connectivity of communication networks in unexpected disasters. These aerial vehicles also play a role in smart cities [19].\nWith the rapid development of the 5G network, ultra\u2010 reliable and low\u2010latency communication (URLLC) emerges as a promising paradigm to ensure a certain quality of service (QoS). With strict requirements of extremely low latency (from 1 ms to few milliseconds) and ultra\u2010high reliability (over 99.999%) [25], URLLC plays an indispensable role in remote healthcare, autonomous driving, immersive virtual reality, cloud robotics, deterministic communication, and many other areas [26]. This novel communication service uses short packet transport, which allows optimising the transmission of control information [27].\nEvolved from cloud computing, MEC has been widely considered as a key application in 5G communication. This promising technology extends the capabilities of cloud computing at the network edge [28] and performs excellently in smart manufacturing, industrial Internet of things (IoT) as well as many other areas [29\u201331]. In recent years, many efforts have been put intoMEC. In Ref. [32], the author demonstrates a well\u2010 established MEC architecture and integrates an application deployment use case, establishing a proof of concept, which is very similar to the actual deployment of the MEC system in a 5G environment. Combining with the optimising method, MEC is an appropriate solution to improve the quality of service. In Ref. [33], the author proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)\u2010based optimisation framework to minimise the cost of delay and energy consumptions for user equipment in a time\u2010 variant dynamic MEC system. The considered MEC system outperforms other baseline solutions according to the demonstration, whereas Wu J et al. [34] adopt an offloading strategy in\nMEC that considers delay and energy consumptions of cost optimisation. Two schemes named optimised OMA and hybrid NOMA are proposed in [35] for solving the problem of joint power and time allocation for MEC offloading. Through these extensive studies of MEC, this evolving technology has been used in various use cases, for example, an audience metre [36]. In this particular use case, MEC modules are used to improve the algorithm\u2019s performance, detecting the estimated number of participants in an event over the entire time period.\nMEC and URLLC techniques are closely related to each other. Under the sufficiently powerful computing of MEC, applications can be processed in real time. By reducing the transmission processing time and reception processing time, MEC can reduce latency in 5G systems significantly. Since finite blocklength (FBL) is adopted to satisfy the latency constraints of URLLC, Yang et al. [37] propose a MEC network where one MEC server is used to minimise the error probability between users under FBL and energy consumption constraints. This FBL scheme is also considered in a MEC\u2010enabled vehicular network to support URLLC [38]. The placement of MEC servers that promises URLLC requirements has also been studied. An algorithm called LowMEP has been proposed to find a minimum number of MEC servers, satisfying the quality of service [39]. The combination of these two promising techniques is frequently used in various fields. For industrial application, Jia et al. [40] propose a 5G MEC gateway system capable of supporting URLLC to enable communication in factories. For autonomous vehicles application, vehicle\u2019s latency and energy cost functions have been established to investigate URLLC resource scheduling for edge computing [41].\nAdditionally, UAV\u2010assisted communications can be effectively combined with MEC to enable time\u2010sensitive and computation\u2010intensive services for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications [42\u201345]. UAV\u2010based edge networks not only be able to minimise the energy consumption of IoT devices with optimal offloading decisions [46, 47] but also reduce the latency by providing edge caching solutions [48]. More importantly, ultra\u2010reliable and low\u2010latency communications (URLLC) recently emerged as a promising technology for mission\u2010critical applications [49]. Combining UAV\u2010enabled MEC with URLLC opens many opportunities as well as challenges for the next generation of IoT applications [50]."

            "text": "In this section, we present the clustering algorithm for UAV deployment by considering an efficient QoS\u2010constrained K\u2010means clustering approach [57\u201359]. In particular, the constrained clustering method considers whether the mth UE can be grouped in the kth cluster based on two types of pairwise\nconstraints, namely must\u2010link constraints and cannot\u2010link constraints [58], which represent the satisfied QoS constraints and the violated QoS constraints, respectively.\nThe constrained K\u2010means clustering algorithm can be briefly described as follows. At the initial stage, the locations of UAVs are randomly set within the deployment area as the centroid location. First, based on the Euclidean distance between the UEs and the UAVs, the mth UE is assigned to an appropriate cluster with the smallest distance. Then, if QoS constraints are not satisfied for any UEs, the altitude of the corresponding UAV must be adjusted. Finally, the centroid location for each cluster is updated. Such procedure repeats until the cluster members are stable or the number of iterations exceeds a predefined threshold.\nAs an illustrative case, we set the number of UEs randomly located in a critical area at M = 6 and the number of UAVs at K = 2 with the path loss threshold corresponding to the QoS requirement \u03b3QoS = 110 dB. Figure 2 shows the clustering result after implementing the QoS\u2010constrained K\u2010means clustering algorithm."

            "text": "4.2.1 | Convergence of the proposed algorithm\nFigure 3 clearly demonstrates the convergence of the proposed algorithm in reducing the worse\u2010case e2e latency. In particular, with the model of Mk = 4 UEs, K = 2 UAVs, the optimising process converges at six iterations. The figure additionally illustrates the impact of the required computation resource on the e2e latency. Unsurprisingly, when the required computation resource increases, the e2e latency of computational tasks gradually increases. For instance, the observed scenario witnesses a considerable rise in the worst\u2010case e2e latency from 0.6 s to approximate 0.87 s when Cm rises to 1100 megacycles.\n4.2.2 | Impact of required computation resource\nFigure 4 plots the impacts of required computing resources of the tasks (Cm) in the e2e latency of UEs under the proposed algorithm and other benchmark schemes. Particularly, when the tasks are more complicated, which require more computation resources, the e2e latency gradually increases. For instance, in the model of Mk = 4, K = 2 as observed in Figure 4, when Cm rises from 800 to 1, 200 megacycles, the worst\u2010case latency obtained by using Algorithm 1 increases by approximate 300 ms. In addition, Figure 4 clearly demonstrates that our proposed algorithm is far better than all benchmark schemes. These results prove that joint optimisation of both communication and computation resources significantly improves the performance of MEC\u2010based systems in reducing the e2e latency of UEs.\nAbbreviations: UE, user equipment; URLLC, ultra\u2010reliable low\u2010latency communications.\nF I GURE 3 Convergence of the proposed algorithm with different values of required computation resource (Cm) in the scenarios of Mk = 4, K = 2\nF I GURE 4 The worst\u2010case latency among different values of required computation resource (Cm \u225c C ) in the scenarios of Mk = 4, K = 2\n904 - LI ET AL. 17519683, 2022, 8, D\now nloaded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1049/sil2.12128 by Q ueen'S U niversity B elfast, W iley O nline L ibrary on [22/09/2023].

Figure 5 clearly states that when the transmit power budget of UEs increases, the worst\u2010 case e2e latency of UEs gradually reduces. For instance, the model of Mk = 4 UEs, K = 2 UAVs witnesses a considerable decline in latency by around 100 ms when the maximum of UEs transmit power reaches 23 dBm.\n4.2.4 | Impact of UEs' processing rate\nTo demonstrate the impact of UEs' processing rate on obtaining the minimised latency and adjusting optimal offloading decisions, Figure 6 presents the numerical results of experiments with a range values of F locmax. Unsurprisingly, when the processing capacity of UEs increases from 1 to 1.3 GHz, the e2e latency of UEs significantly reduces in both models. This is because the UEs are more powerful in processing tasks locally. Additionally, due to the constraints on UEs energy consumption in (17d), the average offloading portions of UEs have to increase to satisfy the energy budget when UEs have higher processing rate.\n4.2.5 | Impact of ESs' processing rate\nThese results definitely demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed offloading design."
