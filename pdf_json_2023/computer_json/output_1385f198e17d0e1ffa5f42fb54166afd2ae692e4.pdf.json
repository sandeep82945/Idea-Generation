    "abstractText": "This paper investigates the performance tradeoff for a multi-antenna integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with simultaneous information multicasting and multi-target sensing, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends the common information messages to a set of single-antenna communication users (CUs) and estimates the parameters of multiple sensing targets based on the echo signals concurrently. We consider two target sensing scenarios without and with prior target knowledge at the BS, in which the BS is interested in estimating the complete multi-target response matrix and the target reflection coefficients/angles, respectively. First, we consider the capacity-achieving transmission and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the achievable rate and the multi-target estimation Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) accordingly. To this end, we design the optimal transmit signal covariance matrix at the BS to minimize the estimation CRB for each of the two scenarios, subject to the minimum multicast rate requirement and the maximum transmit power constraint. It is shown that the optimal covariance matrix consists of two parts for ISAC and dedicated sensing, respectively.

INTRODUCTION\nFuture beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to support abundant intelligent applications such as the metaverse, auto-driving, smart homes, and smart cities, which demand ultra-high-capacity, ultra-low-latency, and ultra-high reliable communications, as well as high-accuracy and high-resolution sensing. Towards this end, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology for realizing B5G/6G, which enables the dual use of radio signals and wireless network infrastructures for providing both sensing and communication services simultaneously [2]. By seamlessly coordinating and integrating sensing and communications [3], ISAC is expected to significantly enhance both communication and sensing performances, while improving the spectrum utilization efficiency and the cost efficiency. As such, ISAC has recently attracted tremendous research interests in both academia and industry [4], motivating extensive studies on ISAC from different research perspectives such as unified ISAC waveforms [2], multi-antenna ISAC [3], networked ISAC [5], [6], wideband ISAC [2], and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled ISAC [7], [8].\nAmong various enabling techniques, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been recognized as an important solution to enhance the performance of wireless networks, by equipping multiple antennas at the wireless transceivers, e.g., base stations (BSs). In particular, MIMO\n3 can provide potential spatial multiplexing and diversity gains to increase the communication rate and reliability [9], while offering spatial and waveform diversity gains to enhance the sensing accuracy and resolution [10], [11]. Indeed, how to optimize the transmit waveform and beamforming design based on proper sensing and communication performance metrics is a key technical challenge to be tackled for multi-antenna ISAC. On the one hand, for communication, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and data rate are widely adopted as performance measures. On the other hand, for sensing, various performance measures may apply depending on the specific sensing tasks. For instance, when the sensing estimation tasks for target detection and tracking [12] are considered, the estimation mutual information [13], radar sensing SINR [14], transmit beampattern [15], and Crame\u0301r-Rao bound (CRB) [16] are widely applied, among which the beampattern and CRB-based designs are most promising. The basic idea of beampattern-based design is to match the transmitted beampattern with a pre-defined sensing beampattern such that the transmit signal beams are focused towards the desired target directions and those leaked to the other undesired directions are suppressed as possible. There have been extensive existing works considering the waveform/beamforming design based on the transmit beampattern. For example, the authors in [15], [17], [18] studied the downlink ISAC over broadcast channels by considering different setups, in which the transmit beamforming was optimized to properly balance the tradeoff between the transmit beampattern for sensing and the received SINR for communication. These designs were then extended to the case of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in [19]. However, aiming to mimic the transmit beampattern may not be able to capture the quality of sensing directly and thus may lead to sacrificed sensing performances.\nIn contrast to the transmit beampattern, the CRB has been recognized as a practically relevant and analytically tractable metric to directly measure the sensing performance limits for estimating target parameters. In general, the CRB provides the lower bound of variance for any unbiased estimators, which can be derived by exploiting the Fisher information matrix to measure the amount of information that the data provides about the parameter of interest [12], [16], [20], [21]. As a result, directly optimizing the CRB is a viable new approach that is suitable for designing ISAC systems, which not only facilitates the characterization of the fundamental CRB-rate (C-R) performance tradeoff, but also leads to potentially enhanced parameter estimation performances. For instance, the authors in [16] studied the multiuser ISAC over a broadcast channel with one single-target, in which the transmit beamforming was optimized to minimize the estimation\n4 CRB, subject to the individual SINR (or equivalently rate) constraints at multiple communication users (CUs). Furthermore, [20] and [21] investigated the C-R tradeoff in a point-to-point MIMO ISAC system with one CU and one target. In particular, the authors in [21] optimized the transmit covariance to characterize the complete Pareto boundary of the C-R region for the MIMO ISAC system in two specific scenarios with point and extended target models, respectively, by considering the radar coherent processing interval to be sufficiently long. As for [20], the authors revealed the C-R tradeoff for a more general case with finite radar coherent processing intervals. In addition, [22] investigated the C-R tradeoff for ISAC in multi-antenna broadcast channels, in which the emerging rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique was exploited to further improve the ISAC performance.\nWith recent advancements in webcast and content broadcasting applications, it has become crucial for future B5G/6G wireless networks to effectively support simultaneous data transmission to multiple users through multicast channels [23], [24]. Additionally, the ability to conduct multi-target sensing and tracking plays a vital role in various multicast applications, such as surveillance, object detection, and autonomous vehicles [4]. Consequently, supporting efficient ISAC over multi-antenna systems during such information multicasting has become an increasingly important problem. This problem, however, is particularly challenging. This is due to the fact that the transmission principle for multicast channels significantly differs from that for broadcast channels, thus rendering the prior ISAC designs [16], [20]\u2013[22] over broadcast channels not applicable. To illustrate this, we consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicast channel as an example. First, it has been demonstrated in [23] that achieving the MISO multicast capacity typically requires a high-rank transmit covariance matrix for transmitting common messages. This stands in contrast to the MISO broadcast channel, where the capacity is achievable by employing a rank-one covariance matrix for each user\u2019s individual message along with dirty paper coding [25]. Next, it has been shown in [24] that in MISO multicast channels, the transmit beamforming optimization problem for minimizing the transmit power while ensuring individual users\u2019 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements is an NP-hard problem. This is distinct from the MISO broadcast channels, in which the transmit beamforming design for SINR-constrained power minimization has been proven to be a convex problem [26], [27]. Due to such significant differences, new design approaches and principles are needed for ISAC over multicast channels, thus motivating our investigation in this work.\nThis paper investigates the multi-antenna ISAC over a multicast channel with multi-target\n5 sensing, in which a multi-antenna BS sends common messages to a set of single-antenna CUs and simultaneously exploits the received echo signals to estimate the parameters of multiple sensing targets. In particular, we consider two scenarios for multi-target sensing without and with prior target knowledge at the BS, namely Scenario I and Scenario II, respectively. In practice, Scenarios I and II may correspond to the target detection and target tracking stages for multi-target sensing, respectively.1 The main results of our work are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 First, we consider the capacity-achieving transmission, based on which we characterize\nthe fundamental performance tradeoff between the estimation CRB for multi-target sensing versus the channel capacity for information multicasting in the two scenarios, which generalizes the target sensing study compared with [1]. To this end, we minimize the corresponding estimation CRB for each scenario, by optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the BS, subject to the minimum multicast rate constraint and the maximum transmit power constraint. We obtain the globally optimal solutions to the two rate-constrained CRB minimization problems by applying advanced convex optimization techniques. For both scenarios, the optimal transmit covariance is shown to consist of two signal parts for ISAC and dedicated sensing, respectively. \u2022 Next, to facilitate the implementation, we present new joint information and sensing beam-\nforming designs for efficient ISAC. In such designs, the BS sends one common information beam together with multiple dedicated a-priori known sensing beams such that each CU is capable of canceling the interference caused by these sensing beams. For each of the two scenarios, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm by adopting the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to obtain a high-quality joint beamforming solution for minimizing the multi-target estimation CRB while ensuring the minimum multicast rate requirement. \u2022 Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the C-R tradeoff performance achieved by\nour proposed designs, as compared to two benchmark schemes, namely the isotropic transmission and the joint beamforming without sensing interference cancellation. It is shown\n1In general, the BS often lacks prior knowledge of the targets before transmission. Therefore, an initial target detection stage is required, in which the ISAC signal transmission is designed to estimate the complete multi-target response matrix for extracting multi-target parameters. With the obtained target parameters at hand, a subsequent target tracking stage is implemented, in which the ISAC signal transmission is designed by leveraging such a piece of prior information to facilitate the tracking of these targets or the estimation of their reflection coefficients and angles.\n6 that for each scenario, the proposed designs significantly outperform the two benchmark schemes and the proposed joint beamforming with sensing interference cancellation achieves performance close to the upper bound achieved by the optimal transmit covariance when the number of CUs is small. We also perform simulations to assess the estimation performance using randomly generated information signals and practical estimators. The results clearly demonstrate that our CRB minimization designs significantly reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) of estimation compared to conventional beampattern-based designs. This highlights the superior performance and feasibility of our proposed designs in the practical ISAC implementation and provides more comprehensive performance comparison than [1].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the multicast multitarget ISAC system model and formulates the multicast-rate-constrained CRB minimization problems for Scenarios I and II when the BS does not and does have the prior multi-target knowledge, respectively. Sections III and IV develop the optimal solutions to the formulated multicast-rateconstrained CRB minimization problems for Scenarios I and II, respectively. Section V proposes joint information and sensing beamforming designs with sensing interference pre-cancellation at the CUs. Section VI provides numerical results.

By assuming that L is sufficiently large, the sample covariance matrix of X can be approximated as the statistical covariance matrix4 Sx, i.e., 1\nL XXH \u2248 Sx. (7)\nTo facilitate the derivation of the CRB matrix for estimating the parameters of targets, we rewrite (6) as\n3Similar as in prior works on ISAC and radar sensing [16], [21], we ignore the self-interference due to the signal transmission in (5), as the sensing receiver can handle such an issue properly [29]. This is different from the communication receivers, for which the self-interference might be a severe issue. Furthermore, similar to prior works on MIMO radar sensing [11], [28] and MIMO ISAC [2], we consider the estimation of target angles and complex coefficients based on the echo signals in (6), in which the Doppler effects are omitted. 4We will show that the approximation is sufficiently accurate for practical values of L (e.g., L \u2265 64) in the numerical results in Section VI.\n9 Y = AcrBA H t X +Z, (8)\nwhere Y = [y(1), ...,y(L)], Z = [z(1), ...,z(L)], Ar = [ar(\u03b81), ar(\u03b82), . . . ,ar(\u03b8M)], At = [at(\u03b81),at(\u03b82), . . . ,at(\u03b8M)], \u03b8 = [\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8M ]T ,\u03b2 = [\u03b21, \u03b22, . . . , \u03b2M ]T , and B = diag(\u03b2). Let G = AcrBA H t denote the multi-target response matrix. Accordingly, we vectorize (8) as\ny\u0303 = (XT \u2297 INr)g\u0303 + z\u0303, (9)\nwhere y\u0303 = vec(Y ) \u2208 CNrL\u00d71, g\u0303 = vec(G) \u2208 CNrNt\u00d71, and z\u0303 = vec(Z) \u2208 CNrL\u00d71. It follows from (9) that the received signal vector r\u0303 is a CSCG random vector with mean (XT \u2297 I)g\u0303 and\ncovariance \u03c32rI , i.e., y\u0303 \u223c CN ( (XT \u2297 I)g\u0303, \u03c32rI ) .\nIn particular, we consider two different sensing scenarios, namely Scenario I and Scenario II, in which the BS does not and does have a-prior knowledge about the multiple targets such that the BS aims to estimate the complete multi-target response matrix G = AcrBA H t and the targets\u2019 coefficients/angles (i.e., {\u03b2m}Mm=1 and {\u03b8m}Mm=1), respectively. In practice, Scenario I may correspond to the target detection phase, in which the BS tries to identify the number of targets and obtain their parameters based on matrix G via spatial spectrum algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC). On the other hand, Scenario II may correspond to the target tracking phases, in which the BS needs to track the M targets by estimating their coefficients/angles, with their initial parameters known in advance [31], [32], respectively.\n1) CRB for Estimating G in Scenario I: First, we consider Scenario I, in which the BS lacks prior knowledge of the targets in the initial target detection stage [2], [33]. In this scenario, the BS is interested in estimating the complete multi-target response matrix G = AcrBA H t based on the received signal Y in (8), or equivalently estimating g\u0303 based on r\u0303 in (9). After obtaining the estimate of G, the BS can further implement spatial spectrum algorithms such as MUSIC [34] to further extract the angle information of these targets. In this scenario, the BS needs to estimate NrNt complex parameters in g\u0303 or G. Based on the complex linear model in (9), it has been established in [35] that the CRB matrix for estimating g\u0303 is\nC1= ( (XT \u2297 INr)H(\u03c32rI)\u22121(XT \u2297 INr) )\u22121 = \u03c32r ( XcXT \u2297 INr )\u22121(a) =\n\u03c32r L\n( STx \u2297 INr )\u22121 , (10)\nwhere (a) follows from the approximation in (7). For facilitating the sensing performance optimization, scalar functions of the CRB matrix are normally adopted as the performance metrics, some examples include trace, determinant, and minimum eigenvalue (10). In this paper, we adopt its trace as the scalar performance metric, i.e.\nCRB1(Sx) = Nr\u03c3\n2 r\nL tr(S\u22121x ).

This may correspond to the target tracking stage in practice [2], [33]. Let \u03b2R = [Re(\u03b21),Re(\u03b22), . . . ,Re(\u03b2M)] T and \u03b2I = [Im(\u03b21), Im(\u03b22), . . . , Im(\u03b2M)]T denote the real and imaginary parts of \u03b2. Accordingly, we have a total of 3M real parameters to be estimated, given by \u03be = [\u03b8T ,\u03b2TR,\u03b2 T I ] T . To facilitate the CRB derivation, we have the following lemma [35].\nLemma 1.

Notice that in our considered setup, the transmit multi-beam signals X are reused for both sensing and communications. This ensures the optimal performance, as adopting separate communication and sensing signal beams would lead to the degradation in both communication and sensing performances, due to the potential mutual interference between communication and sensing signals. Let C1 and C2 denote the achievable C-R regions of the ISAC system in Scenario I and II, respectively, which are defined as\nCi \u25b3 = \u22c3 Sx\u2ab00 { (R\u0302, \u03a8\u0302)|R\u0302 \u2264 R(Sx),\u03a8\u0302 \u2265 CRBi(Sx), tr(Sx) \u2264 P } , i \u2208 {1, 2}. (20)\nOur objective is to characterize the Pareto boundary of each region Ci, i \u2208 {1, 2}, at each point of which we cannot improve one criteria without sacrificing the other [20], [21]. Note that the multicast rate R(Sx) in (4), CRB1(Sx) in (11), and CRB2(Sx) in (18) are both convex with respect to (w.r.t.) Sx. Therefore, the C-R regions Ci, i \u2208 {1, 2}, are both convex sets. As a result, we can characterize the whole Pareto boundary by finding each boundary point via minimizing the CRB subject to varying multicast rate thresholds [20], [21], [36].\nIn particular, we optimize the transmit covariance matrix Sx to minimize the estimation CRB for multi-target estimation while ensuring a minimum multicast communication rate R\u0304, subject to a maximum transmit power constraint in (1). First, consider Scenario I, for which the multicastrate-constrained CRB minimization problem is formulated as\n(P1) : min Sx\u2ab00\nNr\u03c3 2 r\nL tr(S\u22121x )\ns.t. min k\u2208K\n{ log2 ( 1 +\nhHk Sxhk \u03c32\n)} \u2265 R\u0304,\ntr(Sx) \u2264 P.

(22b)\n12\nIn problem (P1.1), the objective is a trace inverse function that is strictly convex w.r.t. Sx [37], and the constraints in (22a) and (22b) are both affine. As a result, problem (P1.1) is a convex optimization problem. In Section III, we will obtain its globally optimal solution in a semi-closed form by applying the Lagrange duality method [36].\nNext, we consider Scenario II, for which the multicast-rate-constrained CRB minimization\nproblem is formulated as\n(P2) : min Sx\u2ab00 CRB2(Sx)\ns.t. min k\u2208K\n{ log2 ( 1 +\nhHk Sxhk \u03c32\n)} \u2265 R\u0304,\ntr(Sx) \u2264 P.

(24b)\nIn Section IV, we will find the optimal solution to problem (P2.1) or equivalently (P2) by using the semi-definite programing (SDP) technique.\nIt is worth noting that by solving the multicast-rate-constrained CRB minimization problem (P1) or (P2) under one given rate threshold R\u0304, we can generally find one Pareto boundary point at C-R region C1 for Scenario I or C2 for Scenario II. By adjusting the value of R\u0304, we can obtain the complete Pareto boundary points on C-R region Ci, i \u2208 {1, 2}, for achieving different C-R tradeoffs [20], [21].\nRemark 1. Before proceeding to solve problems (P1) and (P2) for ISAC, we discuss the two special cases with sole information multicasting and sole multi-target sensing, respectively. First, considering the information multicasting only, the maximum multicast capacity can be found by solving the following problem:\nmax Sx\u2ab00 min k\u2208K\n{ log2 ( 1 +\nhHk Sxhk \u03c32 )} s.t. tr(Sx) \u2264 P. (25)\nIt has been shown in [23] that problem (25) is optimally solvable via SDP. Let Scomx denote the optimal solution to problem (25). Accordingly, we have the maximum multicast capacity as Rmax = R(S com x ), and the corresponding CRB in Scenario i \u2208 {1, 2} as CRBi(Scomx ). As such,\n13\nwe obtain a corner Pareto boundary point of the C-R region Ci as (Rmax,CRBi(Scomx )), which corresponds to the maximum multicast rate. Note that in Scenario I, if Scomx is rank deficient, i.e., not a full-rank matrix, we have CRB1(Scomx ) \u2192 \u221e, which means the transmit degrees of freedom (DoFs) are not sufficient to estimate the complete multi-target response matrix G. Next, we consider the multi-target sensing only, in which the CRB minimization problem is expressed as follows, where i = 1 and i = 2 correspond to Scenarios I and II, respectively.\nmin Sx\u2ab00 CRBi(Sx)\ns.t. tr(Sx) \u2264 P. (26)\nFor Scenario I, it has been shown in [16] that the optimal solution to problem (26) is Ssen,1x = P Nt I , i.e., the isotropic transmission is optimal. For Scenario II, it has been proved in [28] that the optimal solution Ssen,2x to problem (26) can be obtained via semidefinite program (SDP). With Ssen,ix at hand, the minimum CRB is obtained as CRB i min = CRBi(S sen,i x ), and the corresponding multicast rate becomes R(Ssen,ix ). We thus obtain another corner Pareto boundary point( R(Ssen,ix ),CRB i min ) at the C-R region Ci, which corresponds to multi-target CRB minimization."

It is clear that the transmit covariance can be decomposed into two parts, including U com\u03a3optcomU H com towards the CUs for ISAC, and U sen\u03a3optsen U H sen for dedicated sensing. In the first signal part for dedicated sensing, equal power allocation is adopted. In contrast, in the second signal part for ISAC, more transmit power is allocated over the sub-channels with stronger combined channel gains (\u03b1opti )."

Note that this high-rank covariance is typically achieved through multi-stream transmission. While the transmitted streams may interfere with each other, it is remarkable that separate codeword decoding can still achieve capacity by utilizing a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver. The basic idea behind the LMMSE-SIC receiver is as follows: for each target stream, we convey the observed sequence to a corresponding LMMSE filter and then decode that particular stream. Subsequently, we reconstruct the interference caused by that stream and cancel it before decoding the next stream. Note that although this LMMSE-SIC approach is capacity achieving, it requires high decoding complexity [9].

Based on the first-order approximation, it follows that\n19\nhHk ww Hhk \u2265 2Re(wHhkhHk w(i))\u2212w(i)HhkhHk w(i). (47)\nBy replacing hHk ww Hhk as Re(wHhkhHk w (i)) \u2212 w(i)HhkhHk w(i), we approximate the nonconvex quadratic constraints in (45a) as 2Re(wHhkh H k w (i))\u2212w(i)HhkhHk w(i) \u2265 \u0393,\u2200k \u2208 K. (48)\nAccordingly, we obtain a restricted convex version of problem (P3.2) in iteration i as (P3.3-i) : max\nw,Sx tr(S\u22121x )\ns.t. (48), (45b), and (46a).\nNotice that problem (P3.3-i) is convex and thus can be optimally solved via numerical tools such as CVX. Let w\u0302(i)opt denote the optimal solution to problem (P3.3-i) in iteration i, which is updated as the local point for the next iteration, i.e., w(i+1) = w\u0302(i)opt. Note that in order to implement the SCA based algorithm, we need to find a feasible initial point. In particular, we first find the transmit information beamforming to maximize the multicast rate by using the algorithm in [24] based on the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian randomization. Suppose that w\u0302 denote the obtained transmit information beamformer. Accordingly, we use w(0) = w\u0302 as the initial point for the SCA-based algorithms."

As such, the SCA iterations are ensured to result in monotonically decreasing CRB objective values. Therefore, the convergence of the SCA-based algorithm for handling problem (P3.2) and thus (P3) is guaranteed [39]. Also, following [39], the iteration can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point.\nNext, we analyze the computational complexity.

            "text": "This subsection presents the C-R tradeoff performance achieved by our proposed optimal transmit covariance solution and the joint beamforming design, as compared to the following two benchmark schemes.\n\u2022 Isotropic transmission: The BS adopts the isotropic transmission by setting the transmit\ncovariance as Sx = PNtI = S sen,1 x , which is optimal in minimizing the estimation CRB in Scenario I (see Remark 1). This scheme is only feasible when the achieved multicast rate\nR(Ssen,1x ) is no smaller than the rate threshold R\u0304. \u2022 Beamforming without sensing interference cancellation: The BS sends one information\nbeam wscom(n) together with dedicated sensing beams xsen(n). Different from the design in Section IV, we consider that the CUs are not capable of canceling the interference caused by sensing signals hHk xsen(n). As a result, the received SINR becomes hHk ww\nHhk hHk Sshk+\u03c3 2 . The joint\nbeamforming designs in this case correspond to problems (P3) and (P4) by replacing (41) as min k\u2208K { log2 ( 1 + hHk ww Hhk\nhHk Sshk + \u03c3 2\n)} \u2265 R\u0304. (49)\nAlthough the resultant beamforming optimization problems are non-convex, they can be solved similarly as for (P3) and (P4) by using the SCA technique. We skip the details for brevity and the interested readers can refer to [1] for the detailed algorithm for solving the problem for Scenario I. First, we consider Scenario I, in which Rayleigh fading is adopted [16] for modeling the communication channels from the BS to the CUs. hk is a CSCG random vector with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. The total transmit power budget at the BS is set as P = 10 dBm unless otherwise stated. Fig. 2 shows the achieved C-R tradeoff performance, where we set Nt = Nr = 10 and K = 3. It is observed that as the CRB increases, the achievable rate by the optimal covariance solution approaches the asymptotical multicast capacity but can never\n21\nreach it. This is due to the fact that in this setup, the rate-maximization transmit covariance Scomx (see Remark 1) is rank-deficient such that CRBcom \u2192 \u221e. It is also observed that the optimal covariance solution significantly outperforms the other three schemes and the proposed transmit beamforming with sensing interference cancellation outperforms that without sensing interference cancellation. This is because in this scenario, full-rank transmission with multiple dedicated sensing beams is necessary for effective target estimation, which may result in harmful sensing interference making the sensing interference cancellation crucial. Figs. 3 and 4 show the achieved C-R tradeoff performance with Nt = Nr = 4, where K = 50 and K = 500, respectively. In both figures, it is observed that when the CRB becomes sufficiently large, the optimal covariance solution reaches the multicast capacity. This is because the rate-maximization transmit covariance Scomx is of full-rank such that CRBcom is finite. Furthermore, it is observed that the two transmit beamforming designs perform much worse than the optimal covariance solution and the isotropic transmission (w.r.t. the rate and CRB), while the performance gaps become more substantial when K becomes larger (i.e., K = 500 in Fig. 4 compared with K = 50 in Fig. 3). This is due to the fact it is more likely that some CUs may have wireless channels orthogonal to the information beam with the increasing number of CUs, thus making the transmit beamforming design less efficient. Fig. 5 shows the estimation CRB versus the transmit power P , where R\u0304 = 1.2 bps/Hz, Nt = Nr = 10, and K = 10. It is observed that in the low transmit power regime, the transmit beamforming with sensing interference cancellation performs close to that without sensing interference cancellation, and inferior to the optimal covariance solution. This is becasue in this case, most power needs to be allocated for communication, thus making the sensing interference cancellation less efficient. By contrast, in the high transmit power regime, the\n22\ntransmit beamforming with sensing interference cancellation is observed to perform close to the optimal covariance solution and significantly outperform that without sensing interference cancellation. This is due to the fact that in high SNR regime, a single communication beam with equal power allocation is able to satisfy the communication requirement. As a result, the sensingoptimal isotropic transmission is adopted for both BF with sensing interference cancellation and optimal design. This highlights the importance of sensing interference cancellation in this case.\nNext, we consider Scenario II. In this scenario, there are M = 2 target located at 30\u25e6 and \u221230\u25e6, with the reflection coefficients being normalized to be \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 1 [41]. We consider\nRician fading for the wireless channel from the BS to each CU, i.e., hk = \u221a\nKr Kr+1 a(\u03b8K [k]) +\u221a 1\nKr+1 hk,NLoS, where Kr = 4 dB denotes the Rician factor, \u03b8K [k] denotes the AoD for CU\nk \u2208 K, and hk,NLoS is a CSCG random vector with zero mean and identity covariance matrix.\nFigs. 6 and 7 show the achieved C-R tradeoff with Nt = Nr = 10, P = 10 dBm, and K = 10 CUs, where the CU channels are correlated and uncorrelated with the sensing channels\n23\n(i.e., {\u03b8K [k]} are randomly sampled in \u00b130\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 and \u00b160\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6), respectively. It is observed in Fig. 6 that the achieved CRB almost remains unchanged when the rate threshold R\u0304 is less than 3.5 bps/Hz. This is due to the fact that the rate constraint is inactive in this regime, and thus we can minimize the CRB and achieve a satisfactory communication rate concurrently by exploiting the correlated communication and sensing channels. On the other hand, it is observed in Fig. 7 that the achieved CRB monotonically increases as the required achievable rate becomes larger. This is because when the communication and sensing channels are less correlated, the communication and sensing signals can hardly be reused for optimizing both performances, thus leading to a more evident C-R tradeoff. Fig. 8 shows the CRB versus the transmit power P for Scenario II, with R\u0304 = 1.2 bps/Hz, Nt = Nr = 10, and K = 10, where the CUs\u2019 angles {\u03b8K [k]} are randomly sampled between \u221290\u25e6 and 90\u25e6. It is observed that the proposed transmit beamforming with sensing interference cancellation performs close to that without sensing interference cancellation when P is small and approaches that of the optimal covariance solution when P is large. This phenomenon is similar to Fig. 5 for Scenario I, which can be similarly explained."

            "text": "This subsection shows the exact estimation performance by considering the practical estimators, i.e., least square (LS) estimator for Scenario I and the Capon approximate maximum likelihood (CAML) estimator for Scenario II [16], [41]. In the simulation, we generate the transmitted signal x(n) based on the given transmit covariance Sx as\nx(n) = V u, (50)\n24\nwhere Sx = V V H is the Cholesky decomposition for Sx and u is a CSCG random vector with zero mean and identity covariance. In this case, we obtain the received signal in (6). Accordingly, for Scenario I, the LS estimation of g\u0303 based on (6) is obtained as g\u0303est = ( XcXT \u2297 INr )\u22121 (XT \u2297 INr)H y\u0303. (51)\nIn particular, we can find that g\u0303est \u223c CN ( g\u0303, \u03c32r(X cXT \u2297INr)\u22121 ) . As a result, g\u0303est is a minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator thus is CRB-achieving. For Scenario II, we estimate \u03b2 and \u03b8 simultaneously by adopting the CAML estimation [41], for which 20,000 angle grids in [\u221290\u25e6, 90\u25e6] are considered to ensure the resolution.\nFor comparison, we consider the beampattern-based design [33] as the benchmark scheme. The basic idea of beampattern-based design is to allocate more power in desired target directions. Let \u03b8N \u2208 RN\u00d71 denote the angle grid vector of interest, which is given as [\u2212\u03c02 : \u03c0 200 : \u03c0 2 ], and q \u2208 RN\u00d71 denote the desired beampattern in this grid. For Scenario I, we set q[n] = 1,\u2200n. (52)\nFor Scenario II, we set\nq[n] = 1, \u2203m \u2208 M, |\u03b8m \u2212 \u03b8N [n]| \u2264 \u2206\u03b8,0, others, (53) where \u2206\u03b8 is a pre-defined angle width. Accordingly, the beampattern-based design aims to minimize the beampattern matching error while ensuring the multicast rate constraint at CUs, which is formulated as\nmin Sx\u2ab00,\u03b7 N\u2211 i=1 |\u03b7q[i]\u2212 aH(\u03b8N [i])SxaH(\u03b8N [i])|2\ns.t. min k\u2208K\n{ log2 ( 1 +\nhHk Sxhk \u03c32\n)} \u2265 R\u0304,\ntr(Sx) \u2264 P. (54)\n25\nProblem (54) can be transformed as a convex problem that can be optimally solved via CVX.\nIn the simulation, we obtain the results by averaging over 1000 Monte Carlo realizations. We suppose that there are M = 2 targets located at \u221230\u25e6, 30\u25e6. We set Nt = Nr = 10, K = 10, and R\u0304 = 0.5 bps/Hz.\nFirst, we evaluate the estimation performance in Scenario I. Fig. 9 shows the estimation RMSE and the CRB versus the transmit power P with L = 64, in which the actual RMSE and the theoretical CRB using Sx, and actually average CRB using 1LXX H are shown. It is observed that our considered CRB-based design achieves much better sensing performance than the beampattern-based benchmark. Furthermore, the actual RMSE and actual CRB are observed to be almost identical. This is due to the fact that the LS estimator is adopted to estimate g\u0303, which is generally a CRB-achieving estimator.\nFig. 10 shows the RMSE and the CRB versus the transmit sequence length L for Scenario I, where P = 15 dBm. It is observed that the gap between the RMSE/CRB achieved by the sample covariance 1 L XXH versus that by covariance Sx becomes negligible when the sequence length L is greater than 64. This means that the approximation in (7) is quite accurate when L \u2265 64 in Scenario I.\nNext, we evaluate the estimation performance for Scenario II. Fig. 11 shows the RMSE or the root CRB of angle estimation versus the transmit power P with L = 64. It is observed that the CRB-based design improves the practical estimation performance as compared to the beampattern-based design. It is also observed that the actual CRB using 1 L XXH is well approached by the estimation RMSE. In this case, the gap between the RMSE and the theoretical CRB using Sx mostly originates from the approximation error.\n26\nFig. 12 shows the estimation RMSE or root CRB of angle estimation versus the transmit sequence length L with P = 15 dBm. It is observed that for the CRB-based design, the achieved estimation RMSE nearly achieves the CRB using Sx with L \u2265 64. However, for the beampatternbased design, the achieved RMSE is unable to achieve the corresponding CRB. This shows the benefits of CRB-based design again.\nFig. 13 shows the RMSE or root CRB of amplitude estimation with L = 64. It is observed that there always exists a gap between RMSE and CRB both in CRB- and beampattern-based designs. This gap comes from the CAML estimator. It is also observed that the CRB-based design actually improves the estimation RMSE around 4 dB compared to beampattern-based design.\nFig. 14 shows the estimation RMSE or root CRB of amplitude estimation versus the transmit sequence length L with P = 15 dBm. It is observed that there is almost no gap of CRB using 1 L XXH and Sx with L \u2265 16 while there is always around 2 dB gap between the RMSE of amplitude estimation and CRB, which is due to the CAML estimator."

One particularly promising direction is expanding the design to multi-group multicast channels, where the presence of inter-group interference cannot be overlooked. Next, extending our work to a multi-cell scenario is another interesting direction, in which different BSs need to coordinate their signals effectively to mitigate multi-cell interference. Moreover, investigating multicast ISAC with other sensing tasks represents another interesting aspect, as it involves employing diverse sensing metrics.

Let S\u2217x denote the optimal solution to problem (56) with given (\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2208 D. Furthermore, let Soptx denote the optimal primal solution to problem (P1), and \u03bb opt and {\u00b5optk } denote the optimal dual solution to problem (D1.1).\nAs the strong duality holds between problem (P1.1) and its dual problem (D1.1), problem (P1.1) can be solved by equivalently solving dual problem (D1.1). In the following, we first solve problem (56) with a given set (\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2208 D, then find \u03bbopt and {\u00b5optk } for problem (D1.1), and finally obtain the optimal primary solution Soptx to problem (P1.1).\nFirst, we evaluate the dual function g ( \u03bb, {\u00b5k} ) with any given (\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2208 D. To this end, we suppose that rank(A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k})) = N \u2264 Nt without loss of generality.

This is different from Proposition 1, which considers the optimal dual variables (\u03bbopt, {\u00b5optk }), for which rank(A(\u03bb opt, {\u00b5optk })) = Nt follows.\n29\nwhere \u03a3 = diag(\u03c41, . . . , \u03c4Nt) with \u03c4i = \u03b1 \u22121/2 i for i \u2264 N and \u03c4i \u2192 +\u221e for N < i \u2264 Nt.\nProof. Please refer to Appendix B.\nBased on Lemma 3, the dual function g ( \u03bb, {\u00b5k} ) is obtained. Next, we find the optimal dual solution \u03bbopt and {\u00b5optk } to solve dual problem (D1.1). As problem (D1.1) is always convex but non-differentiable in general, we adopt sub-gradient based methods such as the ellipsoid method to find its optimal solution. The basic idea of the ellipsoid method is to first generate an ellipsoid containing \u03bbopt and {\u00b5optk }, and then iteratively construct new ellipsoids containing these variables with reduced volumes, until convergence [42]. To successfully implement the ellipsoid method, we only need to find the sub-gradients of the objective and constraint functions in problem (D1.1).\nFirst, we consider the objective function of problem (D1.1), one sub-gradient of which at any given [\u00b51, . . . , \u00b5K , \u03bb]T \u2208 C(K+1)\u00d71 is [tr ( H1S \u2217 x ) \u2212 \u0393, . . . , tr ( HKS \u2217 x ) \u2212 \u0393, P \u2212 tr(S\u2217x)]T . Then, we consider the constraints in (57b). It is clear that the subgradient for constraint \u00b5k \u2265 0 is \u2212ek,\u2200k \u2208 K, and the subgradient for \u03bb \u2265 0 is \u2212eK+1. Finally, we consider constraint A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2ab0 0 in (57a), whose subgradient is given in the following lemma. For notational convenience, we define Hk = hkhHk ,\u2200k \u2208 K. Lemma 4. Let v \u2208 CNt\u00d71 denote the eigenvector of A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) corresponding to its smallest\neigenvalue. The sub-gradient of A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2ab0 0 in (57a) at given ( \u03bb, {\u00b5k} ) \u2208 D is\n[vHH1v, . . . ,v HHKv,\u22121]T . (59)\nProof. This lemma follows by noting that A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) \u2ab0 0 \u21d0\u21d2 vHA(\u03bb, {\u00b5k})v \u2265 0.\nWith the sub-gradients of the objective function and all the constraint functions obtained, we can efficiently implement the ellipsoid method to obtain the optimal dual solution \u03bbopt and {\u00b5optk }.\nNotice that at the optimal dual solution \u03bbopt and {\u00b5optk }, it must follow that \u03bbopt > 0 and A(\u03bbopt, {\u00b5optk }) is of full rank (i.e., rank(A(\u03bbopt, {\u00b5 opt k })) = Nt), since otherwise, the maximum transmit power constraint in (22b) cannot be satisfied. Then, Proposition 1 follows directly from Lemma 3. This completes the proof.\n30"

(61)\nIn this case, when N < Nt, for i > N , \u03c4i must approach infinity to achieve the minimum value 0, i.e., for i > N , \u03c4i \u2192 +\u221e. As for i \u2264 N , by checking the first order differentiation, we have \u03c4i = \u03b1 \u22121/2 i . Then, we obtain S\n\u2217 x as S\u2217x = U\u03a3U H , (62)\nwhere \u03a3 = diag(\u03c41, . . . , \u03c4Nt) with \u03c4i \u2192 +\u221e, for i > N , and \u03c4i = \u03b1 \u22121/2 i , for i \u2264 N .\nWhen A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k}) is full-rank, we have tr(A(\u03bb, {\u00b5k})Sx) + tr(S\u22121x ) = tr(\u039bS\u0303x) + tr(S\u0303x \u22121 ) = Nt\u2211 i=1 \u03b1i\u03c4i + Nt\u2211 i=1 1 \u03c4i . (63) For any i \u2264 Nt, we need to set \u03c4i = \u03b1\u22121/2i to achieve the minimum value. Then, the S\u2217x is given by S\u2217x = U H\u03a3U , where \u039b\u0303 = diag(\u03c41, . . . , \u03c4Nt) with \u03c4i = \u03b1 \u22121/2 i , for i \u2264 Nt."
