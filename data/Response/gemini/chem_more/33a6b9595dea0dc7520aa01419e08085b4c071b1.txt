1. **Investigate the cross-talk between different CysPTM types.** The paper mentions that different CysPTM types can competitively co-occupy at the identical position, forming cross-talks. Future research could explore the mechanisms and consequences of these cross-talks, and how they affect protein function and cellular signaling.
2. **Develop new computational methods for predicting CysPTM sites.** The paper mentions that there are 10 online computational programs for predicting CysPTM sites, but they focus on oxidation and lipid PTM categories. Future research could develop new methods that can predict a wider range of CysPTM types, including the recently reported metabolite PTM types.
3. **Explore the role of CysPTMs in disease.** The paper mentions that CysPTMs are associated with many diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorder. Future research could investigate the specific roles of different CysPTM types in these diseases, and how they could be targeted for therapeutic purposes.
4. **Develop new chemical probes for detecting CysPTMs.** The paper mentions that the enrichment of CysPTM sites is mainly based on chemical proteomics techniques, where various chemical probes have been invented. Future research could develop new chemical probes that are more specific and sensitive for detecting different CysPTM types.
5. **Investigate the structural consequences of CysPTMs.** The paper mentions that CysPTMs may regulate protein structures and functions. Future research could use structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, to investigate the structural consequences of different CysPTM types, and how they affect protein function.
