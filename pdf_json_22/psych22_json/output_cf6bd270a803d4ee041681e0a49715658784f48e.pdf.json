Specifically, a previous study found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived an illusory Gestalt (global) compared to the non-illusory (local) interpretation in a bistable stimulus. This study provided only a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that favors an illusory interpretation. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural machinery that biases perception towards the illusory interpretation immediately before the stimulus onset, is also predictive of an individual\u2019s general tendency to perceive it, which remains stable over time. We examined individual differences in task-free functional connectivity of insula and IPS and related it to differences in the individuals\u2019 duration of the two interpretations. We found stronger connectivity of the IPS with areas of the default mode and visual networks to predict shorter local perceptual phases, i.e., a faster switch to an illusory percept, but no equivalent results for the insula. Our findings suggest a crucial role of an IPS interaction with nodes of key intrinsic networks in forming a perceptual tendency towards illusory Gestalt perception.\nKeywords: bistable illusion, fMRI, functional connectivity, resting-state networks, subjective perception\n1. Introduction\nOur whole awake life, the brain is engaged in interpreting the overwhelming amount of visual input. We constantly select, sort and group the incoming information to create a meaningful experience of the external world. These processes are usually automatic and are only called into question when an ambiguous or noisy cue has been interpreted in an illusory way rather than by its mere physical properties, e.g., when we misinterpret an object shadow as a threatening creature in the darkness or see contours of animals in cloud formations. These examples illustrate that the subjective interpretation of the stimuli is determined not only by the bottom-up sensory information that comes into the visual system, but also by our knowledge, goals and expectations, which shape the outcome of perception in a top-down fashion.\nThe neural mechanisms of these subjective, interpretative aspects of perception are often investigated using bistable (sometimes also called \u2018ambiguous\u2019) stimuli. These visual stimuli can be interpreted in two different ways based on the same sensory input. During continuous viewing, subjective perception alternates spontaneously between these mutually exclusive interpretations, a state which is known as perceptual bistability (Sterzer et al. 2009; Mart\u00ednez and Parra 2018; Devia et al. 2022). A special type of bistable stimuli, termed \u2018asymmetric\u2019 bistable stimuli, is particularly relevant for studying the interpretative processes in perception. In contrast to typical bistable stimuli, which contain two equally complex perceptual interpretations, these stimuli yield one simpler interpretation, that is closer to the actual sensory input, and one more complex, illusory interpretation, that is derived from the simpler one (Lorenceau and Shiffrar 1992; Anstis and Kim 2011).\nPrevious research with bistable stimuli showed that subjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by the sensory input and top-down influences, but also by an individual\u2019s current brain state (Kleinschmidt et al., 2012). For example, spontaneous brain activity in areas specialized for representing a certain sensory content increases before an ambiguous stimulus is perceived according to the area\u2019s \u2018preferred\u2019 interpretation. Specifically, spontaneous activity in the human face-selective fusiform face area is higher if participants report perceiving a face in the ambiguous face-vase illusion (Hesselmann et al. 2008). In a recent fMRI study, we could demonstrate a similar effect using an asymmetric bistable stimulus with a global (illusory) and a local (non-illusory) interpretation (Anstis illusion, Anstis and Kim, 2011; Wilding et al., 2022).\nWe found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived the global compared to the local interpretation. These two key regions are repeatedly implicated in bistable perception paradigms (Sterzer and Kleinschmidt 2010; Zaretskaya et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2018). Since this study used a paradigm with task-free prolonged fixation periods interleaved with brief stimulus presentations, the findings suggest that an upcoming percept may be determined (or at least biased) by signal fluctuations in intrinsic resting-state brain networks. Specifically, prestimulus insula activity seems to indicate the involvement of the salience network and the IPS activity the involvement of the dorsal attention network in favoring the illusory global percept.\nImportantly, the study discussed above provided only a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that leads to favoring the illusory interpretation of the visual input. However, the perception of a bistable stimulus fluctuates not only moment-to-moment within an individual. There are considerable inter-individual differences in the parameters of bistable perception across individuals, which remain relatively stable over time in conventional as well as asymmetric bistable paradigms (Kleinschmidt et al. 2012; Boeykens et al. 2019). Previous studies successfully linked inter-individual variability in the reversal rate of conventional bistable stimuli to various aspects of brain structure and function, such as cortical thickness (Kanai et al. 2010, 2011), microstructural gray matter tissue properties (Kanai et al. 2010), and resting-state connectivity (Baker et al. 2015; Mao et al. 2020). These findings suggest that an individual\u2019s dynamic of bistable perception represents a trait-like property with corresponding signatures on the neural level.\nIn the current study, we tested whether the neural machinery that predicts the illusory global percept occurrence, is also predictive of a subject\u2019s individual tendency to perceive the illusory component of the sensory input. We addressed this research question by examining individual differences in task-free resting-state functional connectivity of the superior insula and the anterior IPS regions, and linking them to the individual differences in the average duration of the local and global perceptual phases of an asymmetric bistable stimulus. To ensure that observed resting-state functional connectivity signatures are stimulus-specific and are not inherent to all bistable stimuli, we used three additional bistable stimuli with different sensory content and involving different perceptual mechanisms. We found that stronger connectivity of the IPS with\nthe core default mode network (DMN) as well as with extrastriate visual areas predicted shorter local perceptual phases, i.e., a faster switch to an illusory, global percept. We did not find any resting-state signature of the global phase duration after the switch from local, and no equivalent results for the insula. Our findings show that several key nodes across different intrinsic networks may work together in shaping the selfgenerated illusory aspects of perceptual Gestalt experience. They also suggest that the overall tendency to perceive the illusory aspect of the stimulus is driven by two distinct mechanisms, one facilitating a switch to the global percept, and the other maintaining the global percept in consciousness, with the latter not being captured by the resting-state connectivity patterns.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1 Participants\n56 healthy volunteers (m= 24.0, SD= 2.83; 34 female) were included in this study. Four participants were excluded from the original sample of 60 participants due to technical difficulties during respiration recording or the inability to perceive both options of at least one bistable stimulus. All participants were right-handed and had no neurological, cardiovascular, or psychiatric diseases. They had normal or corrected to normal visual acuity and were not taking any medication regularly. Participants received a standardized instruction before they gave written informed consent. They received monetary compensation. Psychology students could alternatively choose compensation in the form of course credit for their participation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Graz and was conducted according to the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n2.2 Data acquisition MRI session\nResting-state data were acquired on a 3T MRI system (MAGNETOM Vida, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with a 64-channel head coil. First, a structural T1-weighted image was acquired for each participant, using the following parameters: 176 slices, voxel size= 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm, TR= 1530 ms, TE= 3.88 ms, TI= 1200 ms, flip angle= 7 \u00b0, FOV= 256 mm. Subsequently, resting-state functional data were acquired in an 8-minute session, in which participants were instructed to fixate a central red dot on the screen and to avoid directed thoughts. Physiological signals were recorded during the whole resting-state period, using a photoplethysmograph (cardiac signal) and a respiratory belt, both with a sampling rate of 400 Hz. This was done to avoid contamination of functional data with physiological noise, which is especially severe in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies, as it introduces spurious correlations (Deckers et al. 2006; Chang and Glover 2009; Birn 2012; Murphy et al. 2013). The functional data were acquired using a T2*-weighted 2D echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: 46 interleaved slices, no slice gap, voxel size= 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm, repetition time (TR) = 3220 ms, echo time (TE) = 32 ms, flip angle= 82 \u00b0, FOV = 228 mm, 155 volumes. After collecting resting-state data, which is the focus of this study, subsequent functional, diffusion and structural scans were acquired that are not part of the current research question."

During the whole experiment, participants rested their head on a chin rest, which was positioned approximately 65 cm from the monitor and were asked to fixate the red dot in the center of the screen (dot size: 0.27\u00b0 v.a.). Each stimulus was presented four times for 120 s, interleaved with a 20 s baseline period. The order of the stimuli was pseudorandomized and counterbalanced across participants. During stimulus presentation, participants were instructed to continuously indicate which of the two interpretations they perceive by pressing either the left or the right button on a high-precision mechanical gaming keyboard (APEX M800, SteelSeries, Denmark) for as long as they experienced one interpretation. Whenever their percept switched, they changed to the other button, letting go of both buttons only briefly during switching (or when they were unsure of their percept). Before each run, participants familiarized themselves with the two possible interpretations of each bistable stimulus in an exercise run lasting 30-60 s. This resulted in a total time of around 9 minutes per run/illusion. Over all illusions and participants, the average total measuring time was 45.22 min. (SD= 4.10)."

When viewed continuously, the stimulus can be perceived either as four rotating dot pairs (local nonillusory interpretation) or as two moving illusory squares (global illusory interpretation) with a side length of 5.89\u00b0 v.a. that are formed by long-range grouping of the individual dots (Anstis and Kim 2011). It is well-known that parameters of different bistable stimuli correlate with each other, with the degree of correlation depending on the similarity of the involved mechanisms (Carter and Pettigrew 2003; Gallagher and Arnold 2014; Cao\net al. 2018). Therefore, to determine which of the effects are specific to the illusory long-range grouping in the Anstis illusion, and which are shared with other types of bistable perception, we used three additional bistable stimuli which are also illustrated in Figure 1. The Rubin face-vase illusion (side length: 6.9\u00b0 v.a.) can appear either as two faces, which are turned to each other or one vase in the middle (Rubin 1915). In the Coffer illusion (side length: 6.9\u00b0 v.a.), one can either see several rows of squares lined up next to each other or have the impression of several circles suddenly appearing in front of the squares (Norcia 2006). Finally, in the ambiguous structurefrom-motion (SFM) illusion (350 black dots with dot size 0.16\u00b0 v.a., randomly placed within an aperture of 3.15\u00b0 by 6.14\u00b0 and moving at a speed of 0.56\u00b0v.a./s in opposite directions) one\u2019s perception changes between leftward and rightward rotation of a 3D cylinder (Wallach and O\u2019Connell 1953).

The anterior IPS was defined using the probabilistic atlas of visual topography (IPS5; Wang et al., 2015). The superior insula ROI was taken from the Destrieux parcellation atlas provided by FreeSurfer (Fischl et al. 2004). Analysis was performed using FreeSurfer and FS-FAST version 7.1.0.\nFor the first-level single-subject analysis, the average time course of each of the two seed regions, anterior IPS and the superior insula, was extracted for each hemisphere and then averaged over both hemispheres. The time course of the respective seed was included in the GLM as regressor of interest. In addition, we used the physiological signals recorded during the resting state scan to account for physiological noise. Pulse and respiration signals were processed using the MATLAB-based PhysIO toolbox (Kasper et al. 2017) as described in our previous work (Wilding et al., 2022). In brief, the physiological data were aligned to the fMRI time series, preprocessed using a peak detection algorithm and subsequently RETROICOR phase expansion (Glover et al.\n2000) was applied. The 18 resulting regressors were then downsampled to a reference slice of each volume and added to the GLM as nuisance regressors. To account for head-motion induced artifacts, six motion regressors were added to the GLM.\nIndividual beta estimates for the seed time course regressor, which represent the functional connectivity of the seed with each cortical surface location, were taken to the second-level group analysis. The group analysis consisted of the whole-brain regression with mean dominance durations (geometric mean) of each percept as predictor (X) and connectivity maps as data (Y). Group results were corrected using the Monte Carlo Simulation method with a cluster-forming threshold of p<0.01 and a cluster significance level of p< .05 (two-sided), with an additional Bonferroni correction for two spaces (left and right hemisphere surface) of the cluster-level p-value. Attribution of significant clusters to the resting-state networks was performed using the Schafer parcellation with 400 parcels (Schaefer et al. 2018). Our previous study showed that a joint activity increase in the IPS and the insula predicts the subsequent global perception of an individual (Wilding et al. 2022), suggesting perception-related covariation of activity in the two areas. Therefore, in addition to performing a seed-based functional connectivity analysis for each seed separately, we performed the unshared functional connectivity analysis by adding time courses of both seeds into the same first-level GLM. This allowed us account for resting-state functional connectivity that is common to the two seeds and examine their unique connectivity targets.\n3. Results\n3.1 Behavioral results\nSince the dominance durations of different bistable stimuli typically correlate with each other (Carter and Pettigrew 2003; Gallagher and Arnold 2014; Cao et al. 2018), prior to the main analysis we first analyzed the correlation structure of dominance durations in our dataset. This information is important because strongly correlated dominance durations may manifest themselves as similar connectivity maps in our second-level group analysis (see below).\nFor all but the Anstis illusion, strongest correlations were observed for dominance durations between percepts within the same illusion (Table 1). Interestingly, we did not observe a significant association between the durations of the illusory (global) and nonillusory (local) interpretation of the Anstis illusion (r= 0.26, p= 0.06), suggesting that the two perceptual interpretations in this stimulus are governed by independent perceptual and neural mechanisms (Figure 2). Consistent with previous findings, durations of percepts belonging to different illusions showed weak to moderate correlations (Cao et al. 2018).\n3.2 Functional connectivity results"

Additionally, we observed significant negative associations with clusters in the right temporal lobe and the extrastriate cortex (see Figure 4B and Table 4).\nSimilar to insula\u2019s connectivity, we tested whether similar results could be found for the percept durations of other illusions. We found a cluster in the superior frontal cortex associated with duration of the square percept in the Coffer illusion (Figure S1). There were no significant effects for other illusions.\nNote. Significant clusters in the whole-brain group regression analysis. Peak MNI coordinates, cluster size, peak z-value as well as the overlapping parcels from Schaefer et al. (2018) 400 parcellation are listed. Only parcels with an overlap of 50 mm2 or more are shown.\nThe above results suggested that both insula and IPS connectivity strength inversely predicts the duration of the local percept, such that the stronger the connectivity, the shorter the local percept phase of an individual. They also suggest that the connectivity targets of the two areas that are predictive of the local percept duration differ. While the insula\u2019s connectivity targets are located mainly in the IFG and a temporal cluster, the IPS connectivity targets primarily involve the extrastriate visual cortex, as well as the frontal, parietal, precuneus and the lateral temporal nodes within the DMN.\nTo test whether the above pattern of results is free of shared connectivity between seed regions, we conducted an additional regression analysis with \u2018unshared\u2019 functional connectivity of the insula and the IPS by adding the time courses of both seed regions into the same first-level GLM.

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the top-down interpretative processes involved in visual perception by linking resting-state connectivity of large-scale brain networks and an individual\u2019s tendency to perceive the more complex, illusory interpretation of a bistable stimulus. We confirmed that especially the IPS, which is involved in biasing the perception towards the global illusory interpretation in task-based fMRI, is also relevant for determining the individual\u2019s general propensity for the global perception in a traitlike manner. We found that interactions between the IPS and the core DMN, as well as the extrastriate cortex, predict how soon an individual abandons the local nonillusory interpretation and switches to the illusory alternative.\nInsula and IPS contributions to shaping illusory perception\nIn our previous study, we used a slow event-related paradigm with long inter-stimulus intervals and brief stimulus presentations to show that the global stimulus interpretation is preceded by increased activity within the superior insula and the IPS (Wilding et al. 2022). Our current findings extend these results by demonstrating that the IPS shapes the way participants perceive the Anstis stimulus not only in a moment-to-moment manner, but also as an individual trait. In other words, individual connectivity strength of this area with several nodes of the default mode and the visual network predicts the individual tendency for switching to an illusory percept. Importantly, these IPS connectivity targets remained predictive of the global percept duration even when insula connectivity with these areas was accounted for.\nOur insula connectivity findings were less conclusive. Although insula connectivity with several areas was predictive of the local percept duration in our main analysis, these effects disappeared after accounting for IPS connectivity with the same areas. This suggests that insula effects could partially be explained by the covariation of insula resting-state activity with that of the IPS. It therefore seems that the IPS, and not the insula, is the primary driver of the resting-state connectivity predictors of the illusory Gestalt perception. This finding appears to be in contrast with our previous study that investigated immediate prestimulus predictors of illusion perception (Wilding et al. 2022). In that study, it was the insula rather than the IPS that showed the strongest and most consistent prestimulus effects. Taking the findings of both studies together, we conclude that the insula may be more involved in shaping subjective illusory\nperception in the current moment, while the IPS may drive the trait-like aspects of illusory perception that remain stable over time.\nOur IPS results fit into a series of studies linking resting-state functional connectivity properties with different individual characteristics, such as working memory or executive control (Hampson et al. 2006; Seeley et al. 2007; Reineberg et al. 2015). Resting-state functional connectivity correlates of bistable perception dynamics have also been reported, with resting-state fluctuations and connectivity being predictive of switching speed with conventional bistable stimuli (Baker et al. 2015; Mao et al. 2020). In the current study we demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity contains more than just the signature of perceptual stability or switching speed. Using a special type of bistable stimulus with an illusory and a non-illusory interpretation we were able to distill the specific connectivity signatures of self-generated, illusory aspects of perception, and specifically of the readiness of an individual to switch to an illusory interpretation of the sensory input."

            "text": "The anterior IPS is well-known to play a major role in bistable perception and in representing illusory aspects of perceptual experience (Britz et al. 2009; Kanai et al. 2010; Knapen et al. 2011; Zaretskaya et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2018). An intriguing question is why specifically the interaction of the IPS with parts of the DMN, mainly the precuneus/PCC and the IPL, predicts how soon participants switch to the global percept. The DMN is typically thought to be responsible for self-generated and internally oriented cognition, being disengaged during any kind of sensory processing (Andrews-Hanna et al. 2014). However, multiple studies demonstrated that the DMN is active not only during rest, but also during sensory tasks requiring a disengagement from the current sensory input and/or a reliance on prior experience, such as delayed match to sample task or contextual priming (Smallwood et al. 2013; Konishi et al. 2015; Yeshurun et al. 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2018; Murphy et al. 2018; Sormaz et al. 2018). The type of processing involved in such tasks has been termed \u2018perceptual decoupling\u2019 (Schooler et al. 2011). The results of this processing are subsequently integrated with the current sensory input.\nYeshurun and colleagues (2017) were able to demonstrate this notion of the DMN\u2019s role in integrating extrinsic sensory information with prior intrinsic models. They provided subjects with diverging contextual information before presenting them with a\nstory, which could consequently be interpreted in two different ways. Interestingly, neural activity within DMN regions was more similar within subjects sharing a certain interpretation of the story compared to subjects who interpreted the story in a different way. These findings suggest comparable neural patterns within the DMN in subjects sharing an interpretation of external events, which was guided by prior contextual information (Yeshurun et al. 2017). In light of these findings, we suggest that a faster switch towards global illusory perception in our study may be mediated by a similar DMN-based perceptual decoupling mechanism. Increased functional connectivity between the IPS and the DMN allows the brain to disengage from the current sensory input that is reflected in the local stimulus interpretation, and to produce a more complex internally generated global illusory percept.\nOur finding that the DMN is involved in shaping subjective visual experience is thus consistent with the emerging view of the DMN being situated at the top of the processing hierarchy (Margulies et al. 2016). The DMN is thought to represent the most abstract and complex mental content, and is considered to be the source of experience and knowledge-based priors that are integrated with the current perceptual input (Smallwood et al. 2021; Yeshurun et al. 2021). It can therefore provide abstract information about the illusory percept to the visual areas and the IPS. Interestingly, similar interactions between the default-mode network and other intrinsic- networks are thought to underlie hallucinatory experiences (Alderson-Day et al. 2016), confirming the proposed commonalities between illusions and hallucinations (Pearson and Westbrook 2015).\nInterestingly, apart from the DMN areas, we also found IPS connectivity with visual clusters of the extrastriate cortex to be predictive of how soon the local percept will be abandoned. These visual clusters are located outside of the primary visual cortex and are not a part of any topographic visual area (Wang et al. 2015). The location of these clusters is similar to the location of the lateral occipital complex (LOC), which is known for its role in processing real and illusory objects (Grill-Spector et al. 2001; Martinez et al. 2007; Cichy et al. 2011). Our results imply that connectivity of the IPS with the DMN on the one hand, and with the LOC on the other hand, together favor a faster switch to a more complex, grouped stimulus interpretation. While the IPS-DMN connectivity may represent the self-generated, internal aspect of the global percept, the IPS-LOC connectivity may represent its perceptual object-like qualities."

            "text": "It is somewhat surprising that our analysis revealed primarily the resting-state correlates of the local percept duration but not the global one. Unlike most bistable stimuli that show a strong correlation between the durations of the two percepts across individuals (see Table 1 and Figure 2), the correlation between global and local percept duration for the Anstis illusion was unexpectedly weak. In a typical bistable paradigm, the two possible interpretations are thought to be governed by the same competitive mechanism of mutual inhibition and adaptation (Moreno-Bote et al. 2007, 2010; Shpiro et al. 2007; Alais 2012). The very weak (and not significant) correlation between percepts of the Anstis stimulus indicates that the mechanisms that determine the average duration for each of them may be different. It is possible that, while the duration of the local percept is determined by factors like adaptation and evidence accumulation, the ability of an individual to maintain the global percept in consciousness may be related to other factors such as working memory capacity or the amount of experience with the stimulus, which is known to change within an individual over time (Anstis and Kim 2011). We also can\u2019t rule out that the duration of the global percept may be better reflected in aspects of brain structure rather than function (Kanai et al. 2010, 2011)."
