"There can be several future works that can be considered for the project. Investigating the usage of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to boost the quality and realism of the stylised images is one approach that might be taken. Future research might also look into the transfer of different styles to a single image or the transfer of styles between various modalities, like from an image to a 3D model. It should also focus on creating new evaluation criteria and benchmarks to rate the performance of 3D style transfer systems. Also, future research can concentrate on enhancing the computational effectiveness and scalability of 3D style transfer models to allow their use in practical applications."
