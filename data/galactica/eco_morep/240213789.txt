conclusions This study developed an econometric model to examine the seasonality patterns of domestic air transport prices in Brazil, both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reveal statistically significant changes in these patterns. Notably, we observed a trend towards increased price discounts during the low season, alongside a long-term trajectory of substantial overall price increases. This intensified discrepancy between high and low season prices (seasonal deconcentration) could be attributed to the reduced seat capacity in the postpandemic era, as well as the evolving composition of the domestic passenger market. Understanding price seasonality is crucial for both businesses and consumers. It provides valuable insights into the patterns of supply and demand throughout the year, enabling the optimization of purchasing, selling, and marketing strategies. In light of this, our findings have implications for airline corporate policy. By incorporating them into revenue management practices, airlines can better accommodate varying seasonal demand stemming from both leisure and business travel. Aligning revenue management with consumer-focused market research could also facilitate strategies aimed at stabilizing the annual demand cycle through proactive counter-seasonal initiatives.
