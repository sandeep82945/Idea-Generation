Development of Advanced Genetic Tools for Nocardioides simplex: Addressing the challenge of genetic manipulations in N. simplex due to the absence of suitable genetic tools and plasmid instability. Research can focus on creating stable genetic systems for this strain to allow for precise genetic editing and expression control, enabling more efficient engineering for steroid bioconversion processes.

Exploration of Other Promoters and Regulatory Elements in Mycolicibacterium Strains: While the hsp60 and acetamidase promoters were compared for their strength in expressing the kstD2NS gene, there is potential to explore other promoters or regulatory elements that might offer higher expression levels or more nuanced control of expression in response to environmental conditions or substrate availability.

Investigation of Co-factor Optimization and Electron Transport Chain Modification: Given the potential issues around the sufficiency of redox partners and electron transport limitations affecting the activity of KstD2NS, future research could explore the optimization of co-factor availability and modification of electron transport pathways. This could enhance the efficiency of steroid dehydrogenation in recombinant Mycolicibacterium strains.

Enhancing Steroid Substrate Transport Across Mycolicibacterium Cell Walls: Since passive transport of hydrophobic steroid compounds may be a limiting factor, research could focus on altering cell wall permeability or engineering transport systems to improve steroid uptake. This might involve the manipulation of mycolic acid composition or the expression of specific steroid transporters.

Comprehensive Analysis of Steroid Degradation Pathways in Mycolicibacterium: Given the observed steroid degradation activities, there is a need to elucidate the pathways and enzymes involved in the degradation of hydrocortisone and other steroids. Understanding these pathways could lead to strategies to minimize unwanted degradation, improving yield and selectivity of desired steroid products.
