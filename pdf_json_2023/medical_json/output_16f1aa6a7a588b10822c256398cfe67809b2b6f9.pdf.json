            "text": "A 69-year-old, Hispanic woman presented with a 6-month history of an irregular, asymmetrical, dark brown lesion on the left nipple, surrounded by a discrete pink plaque (Figure\u00a01A). Dermoscopic examination showed an atypical pigment network, black granules and globules at the center of the lesion, as well as structureless pink and white areas (Figure\u00a0 1B). Histopathology revealed epidermal infiltration by large, atypical, pale cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for negative for s100, Melan-A, and HMB-45, hence ruling out the presumptive diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and GATA3 was positive and therefore, pigmented mammary Paget disease was diagnosed. The patient was referred to the surgical oncology team and underwent modified radical mastectomy. No evidence of lymph node invasion was detected. At the 6-month follow up, the patient remains free of recurrence."

            "text": "Pigmented mammary Paget disease (PMPD) is a rare presentation of a breast intraductal carcinoma that extends to the epidermis of the nipple-areola complex [1]. The main differential diagnoses include malignant melanoma and pigmented epidermotropic metastases of breast carcinoma. PMPD dermoscopy findings include atypical pigment network, structureless blue-grey areas, brown or blue dots and globules, as well as other non-pigmented findings (structureless pink and/or white areas) [2]. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry are essential for the diagnosis. Particularly in skin of color patients, further dermoscopic descriptions are warranted, as even benign lesions (lentigo, nipple-areola melanosis, naevi, seborrheic keratosis) can resemble PMPD. Therefore, new-onset, evolving, pigmented lesions in the nipple-areola complex should be biopsied."
