See the published version at https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-023-04360-0.\nPage 3/18\nAbstract Purpose\nThe postoperative period after laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is marked by a temporary increase in volume, which can impact the accuracy of radiographic assessment. The current criteria for progressive disease (PD) suggests that a 20% increase in size of brain metastasis (BM) assessed in 6\u2013 12 weeks intervals should be considered as local progression (LP). However, there is no agreement on how LP should be de ned in this context. In this study, we aimed to statistically analyzed which variations in tumor volume were associated with LP.\nMethods\nWe analyzed 42 BM that underwent LITT between 2013\u20132022. For this study, LP was de ned following radiographic features, while PD with a combined clinical and radiographic criterion. A ROC curve was generated to evaluate volume change as a predictor of LP and nd the optimal cutoff point. A logistic regression analysis and Kaplan Meier curves were performed to assess the impact of various clinical variables on LP.\nResults\nOut of 42 lesions, 12 (26.7%) had LP. An increase in volume of 25.6% from baseline within 120\u2013180 days after LITT presented a 70% sensitivity and 88.9% speci city for predicting LP (AUC: 0.78, p = 0.0412). The multivariate analysis showed a 25% increase in volume between 120\u2013180 days as a negative predictive factor (p = 0.007). Volumetric changes within 60\u201390 days after LITT did not predict LP (AUC: 0.57; p = 0.612).\nConclusion\nVolume changes within the rst 120 days after the procedure are not independent indicators of LP of metastatic brain lesions treated with LITT.\nIntroduction Brain metastases (BM) represent the most common intracranial tumor, occurring ten times more often than primary brain tumors[1]. The standard of care involves surgical resection with or without stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiation therapy[2, 3]. For patients who are refractory to these therapeutics or are unable to undergo open craniotomies, minimally invasive techniques like magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) have been explored as alternatives. LITT delivers precise thermal energy in a controlled manner with minimal collateral damage [4\u20136].\nDe ning radiographic progression after laser ablation in patients with brain tumors is challenging given that ablated lesions usually increase in volume in the rst weeks after the procedure. This post-ablation\nPage 4/18\ncontrast-enhancing volume (CEV) change is variable in incidence, magnitude, and time course. Prior reports show it takes, on average, 294.5 days after LITT for a BM to measure less than its original size[7]. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)[8] criteria suggest that central nervous system (CNS) lesions should be re-assessed at intervals 6\u201312 weeks apart to evaluate radiographic progression in non-ablated lesions. However, there is no consensus on how long post-ablation edema may persist, hindering radiographic assessment. Thus, the moment at which a post-LITT increase in volume should be considered pathological or prompt further treatment is unknown. While few case series report volumetric evolution after LITT, they offer small samples[9], a short follow-up, and/or an inaccurate method to measure lesion volume[10].\nIn this study, we present a large cohort with volumetric analysis of changes in the CEV throughout the peri-ablation period for brain metastases (BM) with the longest follow-up to date, showing early as well as late changes. We sought to better characterize the CEV changes, identify potential predictors of local control (LC), and clarify the prognostic signi cance of this post-ablation response. Speci cally, we aim to determine when an increase in volume of a post-ablated lesion in clinically stable patients should be considered progressive disease (PD) and not a secondary effect of the procedure (i.e. pseudoprogression), and to statistically quantify which variations in tumor volume are a predictors of local progression (LP).\nMethods A series of 243 patients who underwent LITT to treat brain tumors from February 2013 to June 2022 were reviewed at the University of Miami Hospital (UMH) with the approval of the Investigational Review Board. Data was deidenti ed, thus consent was waived. Only patients with BM and complete follow-up until their death or with follow-up longer than 6 months and more than three MRIs postoperatively were included in the study. Demographic information and clinical outcomes were collected.\nOperative technique Patients underwent LITT using the Visualase platform (Medtronic Inc., Dublin, Ireland) as described previously[11, 12]. The procedure involved a pre-operative MRI with contrast enhancement for planning the surgical trajectory. The ROSA robot was used to determine the entry point and angle for the LITT catheter. The patient was then transferred to an MRI room for thermometry, where reference thermal maps were created using proton resonance frequency changes. Safety markers were placed near the tumor margin to trigger a laser shut-off if temperatures reached 50\u00b0C, while a high-temperature marker was set near the laser catheter to detect temperatures above 90\u00b0C. The procedure involved a test dose of thermal energy at 4W for 30 seconds to check the system's performance, followed by the treatment dose of 7.5 to 15 W delivered in bursts of 60\u2013180 seconds duration. Volumetric analysis\nPage 5/18\nThe study measured contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI sequences for pre-operative and post-operative CEV. Using axial images, the UMH PACS program outlined a Region of Interest and calculated the tumor volume via the freehand tool. Tumor surface area was measured per slice and multiplied by the slice thickness to calculate one volume; total tumor volume was calculated as the sum of slice volumes. This volume was normalized to the pre-operative baseline to track tumor growth as a percentage of the postoperative volume, with 100% representing the preoperative volume. Volumetric analysis was performed at various timeframes after LITT: 24\u201348 hours preop, 12\u201372 hours postop, 60\u201390 days, 120\u2013180 days, and 210\u2013365 days. The date of the procedure represented day 0. Clinical variables de nition In the volumetric analysis, LC was de ned as the absence of a new enhancement in the ablated area or no increase in volume on two consecutive MRIs compared to the baseline, regardless of the percentage. Local progression (LP) was the opposite scenario. Time to LP was the time from LITT to LP or last follow-up.\nThe cohort was divided into two groups using clinical and radiographic features guided by the RANO[8] criteria: 1) patients neurologically stable without signs of LP, and 2) neurologically unstable, locally progressed patients at the last follow-up or with early death (< 60 days after LITT). The aim was to divide the cohort into 1) complete/partial response + stable disease, and 2) PD. An isolated increase in volume in only one MRI was not used as a criterion to divide the cohorts, as the focus of the analysis was on volume changes over time.\nOverall survival (OS) was de ned as the time from treatment until death or last follow-up. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software (Version 9). The main clinical outcome of this study was local control (LC) after ablation. The chi-square test was used to examine categorical variables, while the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for continuous variables. To assess the effect of relative volume change on LP, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the optimal cutoff point that predicted the likelihood of LP was searched. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of various independent variables on post-operative LC. A backward selection criterion was applied for the multivariate analysis. The validity of the model was tested with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Kaplan Meier (KM) curves were generated to compare the time-toLP between patient groups based on volumetric criteria at different time points. A p value < .05 was considered statistically signi cant for all analyses.\nResults Between Feb 2013 and June 2022, 72 patients underwent 92 LITT procedures for BM. Of these, 35 patients (42 lesions) met the inclusion criteria. 45 total LITT procedures were performed, with three lesions ablated twice due to progression. The average patient age was 59 and 77.1% were female. The\nPage 6/18\nmedian pre-op KPS was 90. Common primary sites of metastases were breast (34.3%), lung (28.6%), and melanoma (17.1%), while other origins made up 20% of cases. Regarding location, 61.9% of patients had multifocal BM, and 81% of ablated lesions were located supratentorially with a mean preoperative volume of 3.8 cm3. 88.7% had previously treated brain lesions via craniotomy, radiation therapy, or a combination. Additional demographic details can be found in Table\u00a01.\nPost-operative management and outcome The mean extent of ablation (EOA) was 161%: 10 patients achieved > 200%, 25 100\u2013200%, and 10 < 100% ablations. Only 4 surgical complications were recorded after a mean follow-up of 30.7 months. Adjuvant therapy was received by 47.4% of the lesions after ablation: four patients went through radiotherapy, six, radiotherapy + chemotherapy, and ten, chemotherapy alone; immunotherapy was not used. The mean OS was 20.8 months, with a 6-months survival rate of 76.2% (Table\u00a01).\nDuring follow-up, 12 (26.7%) of the lesions suffered LP at a mean time of 9.7 months after LITT. Only 4 of them did not received any form of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Five refractory lesions were surgically treated after progression: two lesions (# 2 and #8) from different patients were treated with a second round of ablation; another BM was surgically resected (#32); and two additional lesions (#41 and #42) from a single patient were microsurgically resected after their rst LITT (lesion #42 subsequently needed a second LITT). All of the biopsies of these subsequent procedures con rmed recurrence except the third procedure done for lesion # 42. Volumetric analysis An analysis was run to describe the impact of volume changes after LITT on LC. Other clinical variables (preoperative volume, EOA, age at surgery, primary tumor diagnosis, etc) were added to the analysis to assess their possible interaction.\nFirstly, we analyzed lesion size at various time frames and built ROC curves with the volume data to determine which volume increase best predicted eventual LP in each timeframe. The ROC curve built for the 60\u201390 days timeframe after LITT showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.57, which was not statistically signi cant (p = 0.612). The trade-off point between sensitivity and speci city was searched. The optimal diagnostic point was an increase in volume of 4.6% from baseline, with a sensitivity of 58.3% and a speci city of 57.1% (Fig.\u00a01a).\nFor the 120\u2013180 days timeframe after LITT, the ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.78, which was statistically signi cant (p = 0.0412). The optimal diagnostic point was an increase of 25.6% from the baseline volume, which presented a sensitivity of 70% and speci city of 88.9% for predicting eventual LP. On the other hand, an increase of 11.7%, presented a speci city of 77.8% with the same sensitivity, while an increase of 42.2% showed a lower sensitivity (60%) (Fig.\u00a01b).\nConsecutively, tumors were dichotomized between lesions that showed a 25% increase in volume compared to the baseline vs. lesions that increased < 25% or that even decreased in size compared to\nPage 7/18\nbaseline at each timeframe. On univariate analysis, a \u2265 25% at 120\u2013180 days after LITT was the only signi cant negative predictive factor of local control with an OR 0.038 (95% CI 0.002\u20130.285, p = 0.006). (Table\u00a02). All the other clinical variables tested in univariate analysis were not signi cant for predicting LP. The best- tted multivariate logistic regression model included as variables the EOA, \u2265 25% volume at 120\u2013180 days, and a decrease of 20 points or more in the preoperative KPS measure at last follow-up. The analysis con rmed that a 25% increase in volume at 120\u2013180 days was an independent negative predictive factor of LC (OR = 0.015, CI 95% 0.0003\u20130.184, p = 0.007). That statistical tool also showed that a 20 point or more decrease in KPS score was also a negative predictive factor (OR 0.079, CI 95% 0.006\u20130.65, p = 0.029). EOA as a continuous variable was not signi cant (p = 0.147) The HosmerLemeshow goodness-of- t test indicated that the selected model was correct, given that it did not differ from a null model without predictors (p = 0.787) (Table\u00a02).\nKaplan-Meier curves were assembled to continue testing the validity of the previous ndings. When dichotomized into two groups (\u2265 25% volume increase v. < 25% increase) there was no signi cant difference between the survival curves at 60\u201390 days (p = 0.63). However, those two groups did have a signi cant difference at 120\u2013180 days (p < 0.0001) (Fig.\u00a01c and d).\nAs described in the methods, the cohort was divided into two groups: 1) non-progressive (n = 26 lesions), and 2) PD (n = 16). The mean preoperative volume of the latter group was 4.44 \u00b1 3.11 cm3, while the former was 3.46 \u00b1 3.13 cm3 (p = 0.35). When comparing the average increase in volume size, no signi cant difference was found at the 12-72hs postoperative nor at the 60\u201390 days from LITT timeframe. However, at 120\u2013180 and 210\u2013365 days after LITT, the two groups showed a signi cant difference in their mean volume increase, with p = 0.04 and 0.002, respectively. In the rst group, 100% of the lesions showed LC, while only 25% in the second (Table 3). All patients with locally controlled lesions in the second group passed away shortly after the procedure due to systemic causes related to their primary tumor. Three patients that showed LP after LITT, were surgically treated and hence had pathological con rmation of recurrence (lesions #2, 8, and 32). Among these patients, survival time from this second intervention until death was 1462, 469, and 47 days, respectively. Two additional lesions (#41 and 42) in one patient also had a con rmed recurrence. Both showed a hemorrhagic transformation past the perioperative period, developed increased intracranial pressure symptoms, and consequently were resected. After this second procedure, a volumetric increase was detected, and a second ablation was performed in lesion #42. This was the only case of radionecrosis of the whole cohort (Fig. 2a).\nFinally, two patients of the non-progressed group showed an increase in one postoperative MRI without signi cant changes in their clinical status (#1 and 19), and another one showed a 19% relative volume increase compared to baseline that did not signi cantly change during follow-up. Thus, they were closely controlled without changing their adjuvant treatment. LC was achieved as de ned in this study (Fig. 2b).\nDiscussion\nPage 8/18\nOur study found that a 25.6% volume increase from baseline volume 120\u2013180 days post LITT presented a 70% sensitivity and 88.9% speci city for predicting LP. An increase of 25% at 120\u2013180 days and a 20- point drop in KPS score at last follow-up were independent predictive factors for LP, as shown in KM curves as well. However, a volume change at 60\u201390 days timeframe wasn't signi cantly associated with LP. This suggests that for clinically stable patients with ablated BM, changes below 25% up to 4 months after ablation may warrant follow-up imaging, but not changes in therapy. This information could be helpful in making treatment decisions for patients with persistent or new volume increases after LITT.\nThe de nition of PD has been established by the RANO group as a \u2265 20% increase in the size of BM assessed in 6\u201312 week intervals should be considered a PD. This cutoff point was used in different retrospective studies that included ablated lesions but was not validated with data to support it[10, 13\u2013 15]. No expert consensus exists regarding this cutoff for ablated BM, evidenced by the fact that this cutoff varies within the literature, as seen by Rao et al[16], or in other cases where a numerical cutoff to de ne LITT failure is omitted alltogether[17]. In addition, there is no certainty of how the expected volume increase after LITT may affect the radiographic assessment for LP. Mainly, how long after the procedure one may consider a relative volume increase indicative of LP. As reported by Allatar et al[18] nearly twothirds of BM go through a pattern of expansion and shrinkage after LITT, expanding even up to 486.9%[7]. Some reports underline the fact that the shrinkage begins 15 to 30 days after the procedure[9], while others report that it may happen as late as 3 months[17]. Understanding the existence of these uncertainties explains the need to establish the point at which an increase in volume correlates with LP. Our results provide consistent data that an isolated volume change before 4 months post-ablation should not provoke action in clinically stable patients. Within the 4 months timeframe, volume alteration may be in part due to the expected expansion after LITT. Although we present one of the biggest samples with longer follow-up, external validation of these results in a larger cohort is necessary to strengthen this suggestion.\nThe RANO criteria have proven to be a reliable tool to classify the treatment response of neuro-oncology patients. Since its inception in 2010[19], some de nitions of PD underwent slight adaptations for speci c pathologies and treatments. As such, a BM-RANO criterion, and after that, an immunotherapy RANO[20] were released. Given the impact LITT has on the radiographic features, LC criteria should also be adjusted for this context. We here present data-driven conclusions supporting that a 25% increase after 120 days of the ablation could predict eventual LP, and consequently, PD as re ne by RANO criterion. Our study shows that volume changes during the rst 90 days after ablation are not good predictors of LP and should not prompt any alterations in treatment in clinically stable patients.\nAt 12-72hs after ablation, we found an average volume increase of 161%. In our cohort, it took at least 210 days for the mean ablation volume to fall below preoperative volume. This nding coincides with Beechar et al.[21] who reported a pre-LITT median volume of 5.054 cc that only in the 180\u2013270 days timeframe descends below that baseline to a median of 3.677 cc. When the cohorts were dichotomized according to which showed con rmed PD versus the one that remained stable, the latter reduced their\nPage 9/18\nsize below the preoperative one as early as day 60 (96%), while the former remained bigger than preoperative until day 210 (95%) with a peak at the 120\u2013180 day (226%) timeframe.\nBastos et al.[15] found that an incomplete ablation (< 100%), recurrent BM, and the absence of postoperative systemic therapy were independent predictive factors of LP. In our cohort, these variables fail to be statistically signi cant. We did nd that a 25% volume increase 120\u2013180 days after LITT and a clinical decline were associated with LP. Differences may be rooted in the fact that we only included ablated BM, while Bastos et al. analyzed a mixed cohort of metastasis and radionecrosis patients.\nAlmost one- fth (19.2%) of non-progressed patients showed a larger volume than their baseline at last follow-up. These patients were neurologically stable and had a median OS of 11.3 months, without new surgical interventions. So, a nal caveat derives from what we have observed. Although determining a cutoff value of volume expansion helps predict local progression, the physician should always have a holistic view integrating clinical status with volume trends over time.\nLimitations This study is limited by its retrospective design. We also acknowledge that we include patients who died in the perioperative period, which can skew the distribution of some variables and bias the LP incidence. This is because an early death a few days after LITT does not allow for the BM to show its true behavior. However, we decided to include these patients in our study to avoid selection bias and present a real cohort from a tertiary institution.\nConclusions After LITT, BM shows a characteristics volume increase that affects how we diagnose a radiographic progression. Volume changes detected within the rst four months after LITT were not found to be a prognostic variable of future LP.\nDeclarations Funding:\u00a0This study did not receive any funding or nancial support.\nFinancial interests:\u00a0M Ivan is a consultant and grant recipient from Medtronic.
