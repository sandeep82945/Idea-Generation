1. **Investigate the impact of nurses' pre-understandings and emotions on the quality of care provided to patients with mental illness in prehospital emergency care.** This could be done through qualitative studies that explore nurses' experiences of encountering patients with mental illness, or through quantitative studies that examine the relationship between nurses' pre-understandings and emotions and patient outcomes.


2. **Develop and evaluate educational interventions to improve nurses' knowledge and skills in caring for patients with mental illness in prehospital emergency care.** This could involve developing new curricula, providing continuing education opportunities, or creating online resources for nurses. The effectiveness of these interventions could be evaluated through studies that measure changes in nurses' knowledge, skills, and attitudes, as well as studies that examine the impact of the interventions on patient outcomes.


3. **Explore the role of collaboration between nurses and other healthcare professionals in providing care to patients with mental illness in prehospital emergency care.** This could involve studies that examine the current state of collaboration between nurses and other healthcare professionals, as well as studies that develop and evaluate new models of collaboration. The effectiveness of these models could be evaluated through studies that measure changes in patient outcomes, as well as studies that examine the impact of the models on nurses' and other healthcare professionals' satisfaction with their work.


4. **Investigate the impact of organizational factors on the quality of care provided to patients with mental illness in prehospital emergency care.** This could involve studies that examine the relationship between organizational factors, such as staffing levels, resources, and policies, and patient outcomes. The effectiveness of interventions to improve organizational factors could be evaluated through studies that measure changes in patient outcomes, as well as studies that examine the impact of the interventions on nurses' and other healthcare professionals' satisfaction with their work.


5. **Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term outcomes of patients with mental illness who receive care in prehospital emergency care.** This could involve studies that follow patients over time to examine their health status, quality of life, and use of healthcare services. The results of these studies could be used to identify factors that are associated with better outcomes for patients with mental illness, and to develop interventions to improve the long-term outcomes of these patients.
