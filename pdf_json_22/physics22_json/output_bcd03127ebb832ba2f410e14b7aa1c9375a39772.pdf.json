    "abstractText": "The goal of Radar Emitter Recognition (RER) is to extract the features of a received emitter signal. It has become a critical issue as new radar types are emerging and the electromagnetic environment is becoming more dense and complex. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently proven effective for emitter identification, however, recognition of phase-coded waveforms at a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) remains a challenge. In this paper, a novel phase-based RER approach using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) is proposed while enhancing ability of learning features from noisy signals. The phase spectrum of phase-coded signals is analyzed in contrast to the amplitude spectrum used in the state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. The derived phase-based features are directly provided as an input to the proposed BiLSTM architecture. A fully connected layer follows the BiLSTM layer. Finally, a softmax classifier is employed to accomplish the recognition task. Six distinct types of phase-coded waveforms degraded by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with SNRs ranging from -8dB to 8dB are simulated. The suggested method in this research involves simple pre-processing and exhibits overall recognition accuracy of more than 90% at SNR of -2dB.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE complexity of today\u2019s radar environment makes itdifficult to distinguish between the different threat signals present in a measured spectrum. The rapid advancement of radar design theory and manufacturing technology leads to a growing number of new radar types [1], [2]. These characteristics make the recognition of radar signals extremely difficult [3]. It is very hard to create a Radar Emitter Recognition (RER) system that can perform efficiently with a variety of radar types. Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) radars are specially designed radars that try to obscure their emissions from hostile receivers including Radar Warning Receivers (RWRs) [4]\u2013[6]. A typical way to realize LPI radar signals is to reduce the radar\u2019s peak Effective Radiated Power (ERP) using pulse compression techniques. The use of intrapulse modulation for pulse compression is very effective. It has a high bandwidth-time product and large radar signal processing gain [7]. The transmitted pulse is either frequency\nor phase-modulated to increase the bandwidth. The top-level diagram for an airborne RWR is shown in Fig. 1. The process of emitter recognition, which is an important technology in the field of electronic countermeasures, is as follows: first, the radar signal is preprocessed; then, the preprocessed signal is analyzed to identify the intrapulse modulation schemes used by threat emitters. The extraction of these characteristics investigates the model of threat emitter, function, threat level, and other information to distinguish the enemy radars. RER technology has evolved through different stages. In the first stage, traditional methods using the parameter matching approach were used to match the intrapulse parameters of intercepted signal with the information maintained in a database [8]\u2013[10]. Radar signal identification has made a lot of progress after decades of research. Deep learning has made significant progress in this field. In the second step, artificial intelligence technology is used to integrate the intelligence component into the parameter matching ap-\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Deep learning methods, which are based primarily on the time-frequency transform fall under the third category. LPI radar signals are non-stationary so the time-frequency transforms are widely used for feature extraction [11], such as Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD) [12], Wigner Ville Distribution (WVD) [13], Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) [14], [15], Choi-William Distribution (CWD) [16], Stockwell Transform (ST) [17], and Fourier based Synchro Squeezed Transform (FSST) [18].\nA. RELATED WORK IN MACHINE LEARNING\nDeep learning has attracted much interest in the field of automatic radar waveform recognition and has increased the recognition accuracy of radar emitter signals. In [19], a recognition approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Sample Averaging Techniques (SAT) is proposed, however FRANK, P1, and P4 signals still need to enhance their recognition rates. Furthermore, the problem of identifying Barker codes has yet to be overcome. Lunden in [20] proposes a supervised classification technique based on features extracted from received pulses. The overall recognition rate is 98% at Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of 6dB. A novel technique based on intrapulse parameters is proposed in [21] using the variant of STFT and Reinforced Deep Belief Network (RDBN) but Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) and Non-Linear Frequency Modulation (NLFM) get confused with other modulation schemes. The modulation classification problem is considered in [22] when the intercepted radar signals are sent using radio over fiber networks. It is observed that at SNR of -2dB the recognition accuracies of phase coded signals is less. A novel 1D deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) based radar emitter recognition method is provided in [24]. The recognition accuracies of phase-coded signals are not considered in this research. A waveform categorization method based on the FSST combined with deep learning is used in [25]. However, for low SNR levels, the proposed approach has less capability to\ndifferentiate between LFM and Costas codes."

            "text": "In RER algorithms, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to categorize the intercepted signals and is used for denoising, classification, and de-interleaving of pulse streams [26]. The phase-based radar sequences are not used at the input of RNN. In [12], a hybrid network built on a shallow CNN, LSTM, and DNN is proposed that can recognize six distinct radar emitter signals with SNRs ranging from -14 dB to 20dB. The suggested approach, however, does not address the identification of polyphase-coded waveforms. In [27], a novel recognition approach based on CNN-LSTM and STFT is presented. The suggested method can identify eight distinct radar signals with an overall accuracy of 96% at an SNR of -2dB. However, the recognition accuracies of polyphase coded signals other than P2 are not discussed. The multiple feature images joint decision (MFIJD) model with two different feature extraction structures is proposed in [28]. It is observed that Structure 2 is based upon LSTM and has less recognition accuracy for phase-coded signals at low SNR values. For decades, identifying the different Intrapulse modulation techniques used by LPI radar waveforms has been a major research challenge.\nIn most state-of-the-art techniques, low recognition accuracies are observed for phase-coded signals using the magnitude spectrum at low SNR values [29]. In this work, we propose a phase spectrum-based feature extraction method as phase should be an important candidate for the recognition of phase-coded signals. We are filling the gap to achieve good recognition accuracies at low SNR by investigating the phase spectrum of the phase-coded waveforms."

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND In this section, LPI radar waveforms are discussed alongwith the proposed phase-based feature extraction method using STFT.\nA. PHASE CODED LPI RADAR WAVEFORMS In the LPI radar system, a long-duration pulse is phase or frequency modulated before transmission, and the received signal is then passed through a matched filter to concentrate the energy into a shorter pulse. Barker, Frank, P1, P2, P3, and P4 codes are among the phase-coded signals utilized in our research."

Binary phase modulation is commonly used in Barker-coded pulses and they offer low complexity [30]. These codes have the unity magnitude side lobes and are only available for lengths, M= 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nPolyphase modulation refers to the exploitation of several phase values to modulate long-duration pulses. Lower sidelobes are produced using polyphase codes as compared to biphase codes. This subsection introduces the mathematical definition of polyphase-coded waveforms."

The Barker code elements of length (L= 4, 7, 11, and 13) are used in the simulation having the pulse widths of 2\u00b5s, 14\u00b5s, 11\u00b5s and 13\u00b5s respectively. The Frank codes are generated for (L= 3, 4, and 6) using the formula mentioned in section II having the pulse widths of 9\u00b5s, 16\u00b5s, and 36\u00b5s respectively. Similarly, P1 codes are produced for lengths (L= 2, 4) having the pulse widths 8\u00b5s, and 16\u00b5s respectively. Using the formula given in section II, the P2 codes are generated for lengths (L= 4, and 6) having the pulse widths of 16\u00b5s, and 36\u00b5s respectively. P3 codes are developed for lengths (N= 4, 12, 16) with the pulse widths of 8\u00b5s, 12\u00b5s, and 16\u00b5s respectively. Signals are created for lengths (N= 4, 12, 15) with pulse widths of 8\u00b5s, 12\u00b5s, and 15\u00b5s, respectively, using P4 codes. The parameters of simulated phase-coded signals are given in Table 1. After the various emitter signals are simulated with different phase coding schemes, the classification model is trained. The model\u2019s output is the category labels of the emitters. The proposed BiLSTM network is trained using 765 signals for six different types of phase-coded waveforms with SNRs ranging from -8dB to 8dB with a 2dB stepsize. We divide the labels into two parts, 80% labels for training and 20% for validation. The ability of BiLSTM network to recognize phase-coded signals is tested using the testing dataset containing 85 signals at each SNR value ranging from -8dB to 8dB and their confusion matrices are also given in this section.\nB. NETWORK PARAMETERS For our classifier model to perform classification tasks, hidden nodes in the BiLSTM layer, network depth, activation functions, and other parameters are all established. The input and recurrent weights are initialized randomly using a Gaussian distribution with a 0 mean and a standard deviation of 0.01. For all gates, the initial bias terms are set to zero. Training epochs are also important throughout the learning phase. In our BiLSTM design, the network is trained with only 100 epochs and hidden nodes for the BiLSTM network\nTABLE 2: Training Parameters for BiLSTM Architecture\nParameters Values No of BiLSTM Layers 1 Hidden Units (BiLSTM Layer) 110 Activation Function tanh, sigmoid Epochs 100 Optimizer Adam Mini-Batch Size 306 Sequence Length According to longest sequence Learning Rate 0.01 Learning rate (drop rate) 0.1 Shuffle Once every epoch Gradient Threshold 1\nare kept as 110. The Adam optimizer is used to acquire the best-learned weights. The mini-batch size is kept at 306 for each training iteration. The initial learning rate for training is 0.01. The learning rate schedule is piecewise, the software changes it every 50 epochs by multiplying it by 0.1. The validation frequency is kept as 20 so that the network will be validated after 20 iterations during the training process. The gradient threshold is taken 1 and the length of sequence for a single iteration of the mini-batch is adjusted by the network itself.

The confusion matrix is used to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithm as well as to estimate the recognition accuracies of the phase-coded waveform for testing datasets. Radar emitter identification accuracy (RERA) is plotted versus SNR ranging from -8dB to 8dB as shown in Fig.8. Each waveform has its unique relationship between SNR and RERA. All waveforms in our system have a positive correlation between SNR and RERA. When SNR is less than -2dB, RERA increases significantly for all phase-coded waveforms. The majority of waveforms have a RERA of 90% at -2dB, except P1 codes. The overall accuracy for all codes is about 90% at an SNR of -2dB.\nThe confusion matrix is shown in Fig. 9 that represents the testing accuracies of phase-coded waveforms at the SNR of -4dB. The recognition accuracies of codes are given in the bottom row of the confusion matrix. Barker, P2, and P4 codes have about 90% recognition accuracies as compared to other codes. Frank code has an accuracy of 86.7%, P1 has 50%, whereas P3 has 80% as it is confused with Barker code. The overall recognition accuracies of all phase-coded waveforms using the proposed algorithm are observed to be 83.5% at SNR of -4dB. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 10, the confusion matrix is displayed at SNR of -2dB. More than 90% accuracy is observed for Barker, P3, and P4 codes. P2 code has an accuracy of 90%, 86.7 % for Frank, and 80% for P1 code as it gets confused with P4 code.

Our suggested approach does not require any complex pre-processing and is best suited for online recognition of phase-coded signals at the EW receiver side. However, the proposed work contains certain inconsistencies that need to be addressed. Frank codes are confused with Barker codes at low SNR levels.

The proposed technique operates well in practice, with 90% overall identification accuracies for six different types of emitter waveforms at the SNR of -2dB. The experimental results show that employing the BiLSTM framework using phase-based feature extraction, recognition accuracies of polyphase coded signals have improved when compared to other approaches in the literature. The proposed research does not involve any complex pre-processing, and the feature extraction is performed on the noisy and modulated phase-coded signals obtained at EW receivers. This technique can be beneficial while performing online recognition of phase-coded waveforms as less processing time is required. Furthermore, Barker codes have a good recognition accuracy even at low SNR, but they are rarely discussed in the literature. In the future, researchers can explore more advanced deep learning methods to determine an unknown number of radar signal recognitions in a more realistic environment as well as the combined version of different phase-coded signals"
