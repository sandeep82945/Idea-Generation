Lycorma delicatula, spotted lanternfly, is primarily associated with Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle, a tree from its native range that is now globally distributed. While L. delicatula is a known pest of cultivated Vitis spp. in South Korea, its relationship with the specific grape species grown in the United States is unclear.

A diet of A. altissima served as a positive control. Lycorma delicatula provided with a diet of V. riparia or V. vinifera \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019 yielded the highest survivorship and fastest rates of development among grape diets and were statistically equivalent to those provided with A. altissima. Vitis rotundifolia did not support L. delicatula growth past the third-instar life stage, indicating this species is a poor host for the early development of this pest. Our results indicate that both V. riparia and V. vinifera are favorable hosts for L. delicatula and may provide the means for this insect to invade and establish in new regions.",

            "text": "Just under 6 million tons of grapes were grown commercially in the United States in 2022 (NASS 2023), mainly comprised of numerous varieties of the winegrape, Vitis vinifera L. (Vitales: Vitaceae), which is also used in raisin and oil production. Approximately 25% of the total yield consists of varieties of species such as Vitis labrusca L. and Vitis rotundifolia Michx. Lycorma delicatula (White) (Hempitera: Fulgoridae), an invasive planthopper from China commonly known as the spotted lanternfly, is a major threat (Urban and Leach 2023) to the $5.9 billion wine and grape industry (NASS 2023). Winegrape growers with current L. delicatula populations are concerned with reduced vigor from direct feeding and sooty mold growth from honeydew residues excreted onto fruits and leaves (Urban and Leach 2023). Indeed, Leach and Leach (2020) found an inverse relationship between the density of L. delicatula in winegrape blocks and overall grape yield. While many insecticides are rated as good/excellent against L. delicatula (Park et al. 2009, Leach et al. 2019), this invasive insect proliferates easily in nearby wooded areas and reinfests\ngrapevines quickly. Lycorma delicatula have been observed feeding on other grape species growing in cultivated and noncultivated areas, including V. labrusca, V. riparia Michx. (Barringer and Ciafr\u00e9 2020), and V. rotundifolia based on gut content analysis (Avanesyan and Lamp 2020).\nExperimental research shows a varied ability for L. delicatula to exploit specific Vitis species as a host plant. Nixon et al. (2022b) and Elsensohn et al. (2023) found L. delicatula could not complete development to adulthood and had poor survival over 2 wk on V. rotundifolia, respectively. Conversely, Elsensohn et al. (2023) found strong survivorship and development on V. vinifera. And while L. delicatula is observed on V. riparia in natural habitats, when it was included as a host along with Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (Sapindales: Simaroubaceae) in a rearing study, its presence provide strong survivorship to the adult stage, but not at a greater level than a diet of A. altissima alone (Nixon et al. 2022a). In South Korea, common host plants include several members of the Vitaceae family (Park et al. 2009). This study differs from prior work by providing\nJournal of Economic Entomology, 116(6), 2023, 2207\u20132211 https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toad198"

            "text": "Following the protocol from Nixon et al. (2022b) and Elsensohn et al. (2023), insects were reared from egg masses collected from A. altissima trees in Winchester, VA, in March 2022. Masses were held in ventilated storage at ambient conditions until brought to Fort Detrick, MD, quarantine facility in April. Egg masses were then set up in mesh cages (W32.5 \u00d7 D32.5 \u00d7 H77.0 cm, 680-\u00b5m aperture mesh, BugDorm-4S3074 Insect Rearing Cage, MegaView Science Co., Taiwan) with A. altissima trees in a greenhouse and monitored for hatch every other day.\nAll plants for experimental trials were maintained in a greenhouse at the Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, WV. The following plants were procured as 2-yr-old vines: Vitis labrusca on 5C rootstock (Amberg Grapevines, LLC Clifton Springs, NY), V. riparia (Double A Vineyards, Fredonia, NY), V. rotundifolia \u2018Carlos\u2019 (Ty Ty Plant Nursery, Ty Ty GA), V. vinifera \u2018Chardonnay\u2019 Colmar/3309 (Amberg Grapevines, LLC Clifton Springs, NY), and V. vinifera \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019 19/3309 (Amberg Grapevines, LLC Clifton Springs, NY). Ailanthus altissima plants were grown from seeds (as per Nixon et al. 2022b) and maintained in 2.7-liter pots at 50 cm height. Vitis spp. were potted in 2.7-liter plastic pots with potting soil, grown to, and maintained at a height of 50 cm, with flower clusters removed daily. All vines were treated weekly with foliar fungicide (MilStop, BioWorks, Victor, NY) to prevent downy and powdery mildew growth.\nAt the start of the experiment, plants were transported to Fort Detrick, MD, and placed in a mesh cage, and 30 neonates (<48 h from egg hatch) were added. Five cages of each treatment diet with 2 plants per cage were set up. Plants were placed in a 15.3-cm-diameter dish to hold excess water and covered with a mesh bag secured with a zip tie at the base of the vine to prevent accidental insect drowning. Plants were replaced as necessary based on a subjective evaluation of plant health, including the amount of honeydew, the presence of yellow and dropped leaves, or visible microbial growth. We replaced the plants on average every 3 wk for the first to third instars and every 2 wk when the fourth instars and adults were present. Survivorship and development were assessed 3 days per week. Dead insects and molts were counted and removed at each check and continued until all individuals in a cage died. Each week, cages were placed in a walk-in cooler (4 \u00b0C) for approximately 10 min to reduce L. delicatula movement and allow for a full count of live individuals. The climate-controlled greenhouse was maintained at an average temperature of 20 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (range 7\u201343 \u00b0C) and average relative humidity of 55 \u00b1 10% (range 5\u201395%).\nWhen dead, females were collected in 95% ethanol and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until dissected. For dissections, females were rehydrated for 10 min with deionized water. Ovary development was rated using a modified scale based on Nixon et al. (2022b) and Hepler et al. (unpublished): (i) previtellogenic-I (0\u20131 immature oocytes/ ovarioles detectable; ovaries undeveloped, bright white in color); (ii) previtellogenic-II (>1 immature oocytes/ovarioles detectable; bright white in color); (iii) vitellogenic-III (ovaries more developed, multiple oocytes on \u201cstring\u201d; beige to yellowish in color); (iv) vitellogenic-IV (ovaries contain many eggs; eggs not fully yellowed and not full size, without hardened/thicken surface); (v) postvitellogenic (eggs filled with yellow yolk; surface hardened); (vi) postoviposition.\nSpecimens were also examined for evidence of mating (ratings 1\u20133), such as the presence and number of whole spermatophores (with (2) or without (1) wings) or the presence of a crystalline spermatophore (3). The lifetime survivorship of individuals was analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis with pairwise comparisons (\u03b1 = 0.05) using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. Survival analysis was conducted using the base, survival (Therneau 2022), and survminer (Kassambara et al. 2021) R packages in R v4.2.2 (R Core Team 2021). Treatment effects on survival were assessed with an ANOVA, with treatment as a fixed effect and cage as a random effect. Tukey test was used for the mean separation among the treatment diets.\nFor nymphs, the period to complete development from one instar to the next was defined as the amount of time from when an insect began a nymphal life stage and molted to the next stage. Only insects that survived to the next nymphal instar were included in this analysis. For the first instars and some adult L. delicatula, the exact start and end dates were known. However, because each replicate cage held 30 insects, it was difficult to know the exact day of molting or death for each individual. Therefore, we calculated conservative minimum and maximum estimates for development time. For the minimum estimation, we assumed all mortality occurred in the first individuals that molted to the next nymphal instar, using the molting dates of later individuals for the start dates of that particular instar. For the maximum estimation, we assumed all mortality occurred in the individuals that molted last to the next instar, so earlier molt dates were used as the start date for the instar."

            "text": "Overall, there were significant differences in survivorship among the Vitis diets (Fig. 1, \u03c72 = 104, df = 5, P < 0.001). Vitis riparia, V. vinifera \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019, and A. altissima diets yielded the greatest levels of survivorship and development across all life stages of L. delicatula. While V. riparia ranked as a significantly better host for L. delicatula, V. vinifera \u2018Chardonnay\u2019 equaled the performance of the other 2 top diets, V. vinifera \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019 and A. altissima. However, in this particular experiment, among the 5 replicate cages containing 30 neonate L. delicatula nymphs with A. altissima used as a positive control host, all neonates in a single cage quickly perished for unknown reasons. All replicate data were included in the analysis; the average life span of all insects in the A. altissima treatment was 66.6 \u00b1 5.0 days, while excluding the failed replicate, mean life span was 80.3 \u00b1 5.6 days. In similar trials conducted under the same abiotic conditions, diets of A. altissima yielded the greatest survivorship (Nixon et al. 2022b, Elsensohn et al. 2023). As observed in previous research, V. rotundifolia did not support the development of nymphal L. delicatula, with all insects dying prior to or during the third instar life stage (Table 1) (Nixon et al. 2022b). Vitis labrusca was also a poor diet relative to other hosts, with only 2 insects reaching the adult stage and living fewer than 20 days (Tables 1 and 2).\nAll females that lived longer than 70 days had yellow tissue visible on the sides of their abdomens (Table 3). Furthermore, a total of 8 females showed signs of matedness: 1 from the \u2018Chardonnay\u2019 diet, 2 from the \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019 diet, and 5 from the A. altissima diet. Three females displayed a fully crystallized spermatophore, while the others showed lesser development. In this study, mating was not controlled for, so females in some cages lived without any males or males may have died before mating occurred. These data suggest that L. delicatula can live solely on winegrapes from hatching and produce offspring in the same year, confirming observations from a prior study (Elsensohn et al. 2023).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jee/article/116/6/2207/7336857 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nFor each diet, development stage estimates displayed increasing variability with each subsequent nymphal instar. Vitis species including V. labrusca and V. rotundifolia were poor hosts for L. delicatula development and had the largest variation in development stage estimates for first-, second-, and third-instar nymphs, with the minimum development periods numerically longer than all other treatments. Adult survival times were not statistically different (F = 2.03, df = 4, 76, P = 0.98, ANOVA). Similarly, in semi-field studies in which first instar nymphs were caged onto V. labrusca, survivorship was poor with only 24% reaching the adult stage, compared with 86.3% and 88.8% on A. altissima alone and\npresented in a mixed host diet, respectively (Laveaga et al. 2023). In contrast, Kreitman et al. (2023) observed greater survivorship on V. labrusca than in our studies, though their studies were conducted in a growth chamber at constant 25 \u00b0C and we conducted ours in a quarantine greenhouse with temperatures that varied according to outdoor conditions (7\u201343 \u00b0C). Additionally, Kreitman et al. (2023) used bare-rooted plants and ours were grafted onto 5C rootstock (V. berlandeieri \u00d7 V. riparia parentage). Interestingly, on native V. riparia (self-rooted), we observed the longest survivorship of an individual L. delicatula; a single male persisted for ~200 days, at least 10 wk longer than any other individual.\nFig. 1.

On \u2018Chardonnay\u2019, adult L. delicatula lived more than 6 wk on average, and those on \u2018Pinot Noir\u2019 lived over 10 wk. Adults can be found for over 12 wk in late summer and fall, and the first 5\u20137 wk is when heavy feeding is observed to occur. Feeding by adults on winegrapes can cause serious damage to the vines, reducing vigor and carbon stores, making them more susceptible to winter injury (Harner et al. 2022, Urban and Leach 2023). Sooty mold growth from honeydew deposited on leaves may also play a role in the reduced vigor of winegrapes as the mold prevents photosynthesis in affected leaves, though its impact is currently unknown (Urban and Leach 2023). The long life span of L. delicatula adults on these 2 popular winegrape varieties suggests this insect may be present in vineyards during and after harvest, which could lead to issues over winter and the following growing season. In this study, we used 3,309 rootstock varieties (a V. riparia \u00d7 V. rupestris parentage) often recommended for the mid-Atlantic (Wolf 2008). This same rootstock, as well as others, are also recommended\nfor western growing regions like California, with selection based on Phylloxera and nematode resistance as well as vigor, soil texture, and nutrient availability (Lambert et al. 2008, Walker 2019). The impact of L. delicatula on these same Vitis varieties grown on different rootstocks may vary and remain unknown.\nIslam et al. (2022) found that heavy L. delicatula feeding on the hybrid \u2018Marquette\u2019 (rootstock not reported) led to extensive changes in gene expression associated with biosynthesis of cell wall, structural components, and detoxification, potentially allocating more resources to these pathways compared with more tolerant varieties. Thus, future studies should aim to investigate differences in L. delicatula survivorship on Vitis species grafted to different rootstocks to determine if rootstocks may convey a degree of tolerance against, or resistance to L. delicatula. Additionally, regions with V. vinifera and/or V. riparia may be more vulnerable to invasion and establishment of L. delicatula even in the absence of A. altissima."
