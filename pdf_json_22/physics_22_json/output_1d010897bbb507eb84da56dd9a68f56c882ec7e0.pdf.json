    "abstractText": "In this paper, we use geometric singular perturbation theory and blowup, as our main technical tool, to study the mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) that occur in two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units with symmetric and repulsive coupling. In particular, we demonstrate that the MMOs in this model are not due to generic folded singularities, but rather due to singularities at a cusp \u2013 not a fold \u2013 of the critical manifold. Using blowup, we determine the number of SAOs analytically, showing \u2013 as for the folded nodes \u2013 that they are determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model undergoes a (symmetric) saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced problem, which \u2013 although resembling a folded saddle-node (type II) at this level \u2013 also occurs on a cusp, and not a fold. We demonstrate that this bifurcation is associated with the emergence of an invariant cylinder, the onset of SAOs, as well as SAOs of increasing amplitude. We relate our findings with numerical computations and find excellent agreement.",

            "text": "Coupled nonlinear oscillators are ubiquitous in physics, chemistry, biology and many other contexts. Interestingly, the collective behavior of the population of oscillators may exhibit qualitatively different dynamics that the individual units would if uncoupled. Coupling may, e.g., lead to oscillator death [2, 14] or, on the contrary, promote oscillatory activity [17, 51, 52]. In neurons and other cells capable of exhibiting complex bursting electrical activity, gap junction coupling can change the cellular behavior from a simple action potential firing to bursting [10, 33, 38, 44, 45] and lead to large increases in the burst period [34].\nA particular kind of complex dynamics, also observed in models of cellular electrical activity, consist of mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) where small- and large-amplitude oscillations (SAOs and LAOs, respectively) alternate [6, 11]. Such dynamics is caused by cellular mechanisms operating on different time scales and can be seen, e.g., in the classical HodgkinHuxley model [22] for neuronal action potential generation [43], and in experimental data and models of cortical neurons [20], stellate cells [12, 42], neuroendocrine cells [3, 41, 48, 49], cardiac cells [26, 54], among others. The mathematical structure causing MMOs is increasingly well understood by Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT henceforth) [15, 25] and often involves folded singularities, canard orbits [46, 53] and singular Hopf bifurcations [18], which are generally related to saddle-node bifurcations in the fast subsystem when treating slow variables as parameters [6, 11].\nIn our recent study of coupled bursting oscillators [39], we revisited the finding by Sherman [44] who showed that coupling of spiking cells can lead to bursting via slow desynchronization so that each burst is preceded by a large number of full action potentials (spikes). Before the transition to bursting, the averaged membrane potentials show SAOs reflecting amplitudemodulated spiking [39]. We showed that the dynamical structure of the system obtained by averaging was captured by a system of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) units [16, 35]:\nv\u03071 = \u2212v31 + 3v1 \u2212 w1 + g(v2 \u2212 v1), v\u03072 = \u2212v32 + 3v2 \u2212 w2 + g(v1 \u2212 v2), w\u03071 = (v1 \u2212 c), w\u03072 = (v2 \u2212 c),\n(1)\nwith symmetric and repulsive coupling g < 0, and that this simple system exhibits MMOs organized by a singular Hopf bifurcation related to a folded singularity [18]. However, this bifurcation was not related to a transcritical bifurcation of a folded node (the folded saddle-node [31]), as is typically seen in applications [11], but rather to a cusp catastrophe in the fast subsystem. This observation motivated the current study of what we will refer to as\ncusped singularities."

            "text": "In this paper, we continue our study of the two identical FHN units (1). We start by highlighting three separate properties. Firstly, for g = 0 then (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) decouple as a Lienard equation:\nv\u0307i = \u2212v3i + 3vi \u2212 wi, w\u0307i = (vi \u2212 c),\n(2)\nfor i = 1, 2, and the dynamics of each pair is identical, being oscillatory (through relaxation oscillations) for c \u2208 (\u22121, 1) and nonoscillatory (through a globally attracting equilibrium) for c > 1 (and c < \u22121) for all 0 < 1 [16, 23], see Fig. 1.\nSecondly, the system (1) is symmetric with respect to\nS : (v1, v2, w1, w2) 7\u2192 (v2, v1, w2, w1),\nso that v1 = v2, w1 = w2, being the fixed point of this symmetry, defines an invariant subspace. This will play an important role in the following.\nFinally, there is a unique equilibrium\nq : (v1, v2, w1, w2) = (c, c,\u2212c3 + 3c,\u2212c3 + 3c), (3)\nof (1) and this point q lies on the symmetric subspace defined by v1 = v2,\nw1 = w2. The Jacobian evaluated at q has eigenvalues\n\u03bd1,2 = 3\u2212 3c2 \u00b1 \u221a (3\u2212 3c2)2 \u2212 4 2 , (4) \u03bd3,4 = 3\u2212 3c2 \u2212 2g \u00b1 \u221a (3\u2212 3c2 \u2212 2g)2 \u2212 4 2 . (5)\nLet\nvs(g) :=\n\u221a 1\u2212 2\n3 g. (6)\nThen a Hopf bifurcation occurs for c = vs(g) where \u03bd3,4 are purely imaginary (\u00b1i \u221a ). In fact, a direct calculation (based upon center manifold and normal form theory, see specifically [19, Equation 3.4.11] and Remark 6 below) shows that the associated first Liapunov number is given by\nl1( ) = 3(g \u2212 3)\n8g \u221a (1 +O( )). (7)\nSeeing that l1( ) > 0 for g < 0 and all 0 < 1, it follows that we have a (singular) subcritical Hopf bifurcation [18, 19] for all > 0 small enough.\nIn [39], it was observed numerically that the system (1) for c < vs but c \u2248 vs and 0 < 1 exhibits mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) with an increasing number of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) as c approaches vs from below, see Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and the figure captions. Following large-amplitude oscillations (LAOs), the two cells almost synchronize (v1 \u2248 v2). However, as the voltages approach c, they begin to diverge as they spiral apart, creating SAOs with increasing amplitudes before departing into additional large-amplitude excursions. Interestingly, for some c values, e.g., c = 1.27, there is an alternation between v1 and v2 being increasing (and v2, respectively, v1 being decreasing) at the beginning of the LAOs, whereas this does not occur for other c values. We will show that this phenomenon corresponds to the system leaving the neighborhood of the cusped singularity in different directions, a behavior which is not possible for the standard folded node. We return to this point in the Conclusions."

            "text": "In this paper, we describe the origin and mechanisms underlying the MMOs in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. In particular, we show that the coupled system (1) possesses a degenerate folded singularity in the singular limit \u2192 0, and demonstrate \u2013 through a center manifold computation \u2013 that this singularity corresponds to a cusp, see also Fig. 5 and the figure caption for details. Moreover, by performing a detailed blow-up analysis, we dissect the details of the dynamics near this new type of singularity and show that it lies at the heart of the mechanism causing SAOs. As for folded singularities [46], we divide our analysis into two parts: one part covering the generic case (i.e. without an additional unfolding parameter) and one covering the bifurcation\nin the presence of an unfolding parameter. Since, the former case resembles the folded node [53] \u2013 in particular, we will show that the number of SAOs is also determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues \u2013 we will refer to this singularity as the \u201ccusped node singularity\u201d. Similarly, our results also show that the degenerate case, which we name the \u201ccusped saddle-node singularity\u201d, as the classical folded saddle-node (of type II [31]), marks the onset of SAOs in the coupled FHN system.\nFor any b \u2265 0, let bbc, denote the largest integer n \u2208 N0 such that n \u2264 b. We then summarize our findings on the SAOs in the following theorem (we refer to Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 for more detailed versions).\nTheorem 1 Consider (1) with g < 0 and suppose\nc \u2208  1\u2212 12g\u221a 1\u2212 2g3 , vs  . (8) Then we have ( the cusped-node case):\n1. There is a desingularization of the reduced problem on the critical manifold C of the slow-fast system (1) such that the system has an attracting singularity f1, given by\nvi = vs, wi = ws, for i = 1, 2,\nfor ws := \u2212v3s + 3vs, that lies on a cusp of C. Moreover, the linearization around f1 has the following eigenvalues\n\u03bb1 := \u22126vs(vs \u2212 c), \u03bb2 := \u2212\u03bb1 + 2g. (9)\nwith \u03bb2 < \u03bb1 < 0 for the values in (8). The point f1 is therefore a stable node for the desingularized system; specifically, it (locally) attracts all points on the attracting subset of C.\n2. Orbits of (1) that pass through f1 for 0 < 1 will (in general) undergo SAOs around the symmetric subspace v1 = v2, w1 = w2 before leaving a neighborhood of f1.\n3. Suppose that \u03bb2\u03bb1 /\u2208 N. Then the amplitude of these SAOs is of the\norder O( \u03bb2 2\u03bb1 ) and the number of SAOs is given by b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c many full 180\u25e6 rotations around the symmetric subspace v1 = v2, w1 = w2, for all 0 < 1.\nNext, fix any\nc2 \u2208 ( \u2212 1\n3vs , 0\n) , (10)\nand consider\nc = vs + \u221a c2. (11)\nThen we have ( the cusped-saddle node case):\n4. The singularity f1 of the desingularized reduced problem on C is a saddle-node for c = vs with \u03bb2 < \u03bb1 = 0, locally attracting all points on the attracting subset of C.\n5. With c as in (11) and c2 fixed in (10), the regular singularity q, given by (3), is of saddle-focus type for all 0 < 1, having a two-dimensional unstable manifold with focus-type dynamics.\n6. Orbits of (1), with c as in (11) and c2 fixed in (10), that pass through f1 for 0 < 1 will (in general) undergo SAOs around the symmetric subspace v1 = v2, w1 = w2, before leaving a neighborhood of f1.\n7. There are finitely many of the SAOs that are O( 1/4) in amplitude as \u2192 0.\n8. The number of SAOs with an amplitude that is exponentially small with respect to > 0 is unbounded as \u2192 0.\nThere are no SAOs for c2 > 0 and all 0 < 1. 2\nDespite the similarities between the folded and cusped versions of the singularities, we will also illuminate some differences. For example, we show that the cusped saddle-node is intrinsically related to a regular Lienard equation in the same way that the FSN is related to the canard explosion. See Lemma 9 and Proposition 6 for details.\nRemark 1 The reference [29] also considers coupled oscillators in four dimensions, including systems like (1). The focus is (also) on emergence of MMOs in these types of systems. However, in contrast to our work, the singularities in [29] are folded and not \u201ccusped\u201d and the analysis of the coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo system, see [29, Section 4], also focuses on the attractive coupling g > 0. In the present paper, we will only consider g < 0."

(12)\nIn Theorem 1, we count the number of SAOs as 180\u25e6-rotations around the symmetric subspace. In the coordinates (12), the symmetric space corresponds to u = 0, z = 0, so when projected onto the (u, z)-plane, SAOs correspond to full 180\u25e6 rotations around the origin. Therefore we have the following: The number of SAOs is one less than the number of zeros of u = 0. We illustrate this in Fig. 6 for c = 1.24, g = \u22121 and = 0.01. Here \u03bb2\u03bb1 = 4.06 and we find five simple zeros of u and in agreement with Theorem 1 precisely four full 180\u25e6-rotations.\nOn the other hand, Fig. 7A shows a typical orbit of the system (1) in the (u, y, z)-space for c = 1.28, g = \u22121, = 0.01. It corresponds to the cusped saddle-node case. The orbit approaches the symmetric subspace u = 0, z = 0 denoted by \u03b3 (red dotted line), and moves towards and beyond the cusped singularity f1 located at the origin (blue dot), coming close to the saddle-focus point q (red asterisk) before spiralling outwards. To find the number of SAOs as a function of c, we counted the number of zeros of u = 0 as asymptotes of z/u (see Fig. 7B) for a range of c values. These numerical results were then plotted against the theoretical values of item 3 in Theorem 1 using the explicit expressions for the eigenvalues (9), see Fig. 7C. The correspondence is excellent with minor discrepancies for c values in the interval given by (10)-(11), the cusped-saddle node region, where Theorem 1 predicts an unbounded number of exponentially small SAOs as \u2192 0 (see Theorem 1, item 8). This is not a surprise, as Theorem 1, item 3, assumes that c is uniformly bounded away from vs. The increment in amplitude of the SAOs as c increases and enters the cusped-saddle node region, due to focus dynamics near q, see Theorem 1, items 5 and 6, is also confirmed by the simulations (Fig. 7D)."

To see this, one can use that\ntr (Dh)2 \u2212 4detDh = 9(v21 \u2212 v22)2 + 4g2 > 0.\nThe expressions for mu,s are not important and therefore left out. Following this lemma, we now define CRN , CAN and CS as the subsets of C with 0 \u2264 r < mu(\u03b8), r > ms(\u03b8) and mu(\u03b8) < r < ms(\u03b8), respectively, in the polar coordinates (r, \u03b8).

Then\nC = CRN \u222a Fu \u222a CS \u222a Fs \u222a CAN .\nWe then conclude the following (see Fig. 8 for an illustration):\nLemma 2 Fi, i = u, s are sets of loss of normal hyperbolicity, but (since trDh \u2277 0 on Fi) the linearization along Fu has one positive eigenvalue whereas the nontrivial eigenvalue of the linearization along Fs is negative.

When v1 6= v2, we consider u = 12(v1 \u2212 v2), x = 1 2(v1 + v2) with u 6= 0. This gives\nx = gc\n3c2 + g \u2212 3 , u2 = (x\u2212 c)2 + 1\u2212 c2. (22)\nfor c 6= \u221a\n1\u2212 g3 .

This gives the pitchfork bifurcations. It is a direct calculation to verify the remaining claims regarding f3(c) and f4(c) of items 2 and 3.\nThe linearization of (20) around v = vs(g) produces the following eigenvalues:\n\u03bb1 := \u22126vs(vs \u2212 c), \u03bb2 := \u2212\u03bb1 + 2g.

The function Q is smooth and odd in u: Q(\u2212u, y) = \u2212Q(u, y) for all u, y sufficiently small. Moreover, locally S splits into a disjoint union Sa \u222a F \u222a Sr where\nSr,a := S \u2229 {y \u2277 f(u2)}, F = S \u2229 {y = f(u2)}, (32)\nwhere\nf(u2) := \u22129v 2 s + g\nvs u2 +O(u4). (33)\nFinally, the point (u, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) is a cusp singularity of S. 2\nProof The result follows from the implicit function theorem. In particular, by implicit differentiation S is non-normally hyperbolic at points where \u2202Q \u2202u (u, y) = 0; solving this equation, depending smoothly on y and u\n2, gives y = f(u2) with f as in (33), or\nu2 = f\u22121(y) = \u2212 vs 9v2s + g y +O(y2), (34)\nlocally by the implicit function theorem. Inserting (34) into z = Q(u, y) gives\nz2 + ay3[1 +O(y)] = 0,\nupon squaring both sides. Here a = 4v 3 s\n(9v2s+g)g 2 > 0. Setting y\u0304 = y[1+O(y)]1/3\nand z\u0304 = z/ \u221a a finally gives the cusp normal form z\u03042 + y\u03043 = 0 [1].\nNotice that S is symmetric; (u, y, z) \u2208 S implies that (\u2212u, y,\u2212z) \u2208 S for all (u, y, z) sufficiently small. In particular, (0, y, 0) \u2208 S for all y \u2248 0. We illustrate the situation in Fig. 11.\nAny point p \u2208 W s(Sa), belongs to the stable manifold of a base point on Sa. We shall denote this base point by\n\u03c0a(p) \u2208 Sa, (35)\nsee Fig. 11.\nLet\nA(u, v) := ( 1 \u2212Q\u2032y(u, y) 0 Q\u2032u(u, y) ) .\nHere Q\u2032s := \u2202Q \u2202s denotes the partial derivative of Q with respect to s = u, y. Then the reduced problem on S can be written as\nQ\u2032u(u, y) ( u\u0307 y\u0307 ) = A(u, v) ( u,\nvs \u2212 c+ 12gy + 3 2gvsu 2 +m(u, y,Q(u, y), 0),\n) ,\n(36)\nby implicit differentiation.\nLemma 4 (36) is smoothly conjugated to the reduced problem (17) on C in a neighborhood of v = vs, w = ws. 2\nProof This is by construction: The critical S within Ma is the set of equilibria of (26) and this set coincides with C upon application of the coordinate transformation defined by (24) and (25). We therefore obtain the desired transformation through the u-equation in (24) and the y-equation in (25):\nu = 1\n2 (v1 \u2212 v2), y =\n1 2 (h1(v1, v2) + h2(v1, v2))\u2212 ws. (37)\nWe see that v = vs gives (u, y) = (0, 0) and the Jacobian matrix of the right hand sides with respect to v = vs is(\n1 2 \u2212 1 2 g g\n) .\nSince this matrix is regular, having determinant g < 0, (37) defines a diffeomorphism (v1, v2) 7\u2192 (u, y) on a neighborhood of v = vs by the inverse function theorem and this gives the desired conjugacy between (36) and (17).\nConsequently, our results on (17), see e.g. Proposition 1, can (locally) be transferred to (36). It will, however, be useful to perform the analysis of (36) in the u, y-plane directly nonetheless. To do so, we study a desingularization of (36). Specifically, since Q\u2032u < 0 on Sa, the system(\nu\u0307 y\u0307\n) = \u2212A(u, v) ( u,\nvs \u2212 c+ 12gy + 3 2gvsu 2 +m(u, y,Q(u, y), 0),\n) (38)\nis equivalent to (36) there. Orbits of (36) on Sr are also orbits of the desingularized system (38) but the direction of the flow has changed. (u, y) = (0, 0)\nis then an equilibrium of the desingularized system (38), and a direct calculation shows that the eigenvalues of the linearization are (\u22122g)\u03bb1, (\u22122g)\u03bb2, recall (23). Therefore for all c in the interval 1\u2212 g 3\u221a\n1\u2212 2g 3\n< c < vs, (u, y) = (0, 0)\nis a hyperbolic stable node for (36), recall also Proposition 1. In particular, using (23) we find that \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 < 0 for c = 1\u2212 1 2 g\u221a\n1\u2212 2g 3\n. This value of c is always\nless than vs for g < 0 (and greater than the value 1\u2212 1\n3 g\u221a\n1\u2212 2g 3\ncorresponding to\nthe second pitchfork bifurcation, recall Proposition 1). A direct calculation then gives the following.\nLemma 5 Consider\nc \u2208  1\u2212 12g\u221a 1\u2212 2g3 , vs  . (39) Then\n\u03bb2 < \u03bb1 < 0, (40)\nand the invariant set u = 0 is therefore the weak direction of the stable node (u, y) = (0, 0). 2\nConsequently, all points on Sa approaches (u, y) = (0, 0) tangentially to the set u = 0 under the forward flow of (38) for these values of c. In the following, we shall denote the corresponding set (0, y, 0) in the (u, y, z) space by \u03b3. For c as in (39), it corresponds to a singular weak canard for the folded node [53]. In fact, \u03b3 is distinguished from all orbits on Sa insofar that it is symmetric with respect to S.\nAs S has a cusp singularity at (u, y, z) = 0, v = vs, w = h(vs) is not a regular folded node singularity [53] of the slow-fast system (1). We refer to it as a cusped node.\nNotice also that in the nonhyperbolic case c = vs, it follows fromQ(0, y) = 0 that the invariant set \u03b3 becomes an attracting center manifold of (38) along which we have y\u0307 = 3vs\n2g2 y2(1 +O(y)) > 0 on Sa. Despite the resemblance, the\ntranscritical bifurcation at c = vs is also not a folded saddle-node (type II) [31]. We will instead call it a cusped saddle-node.\nIn the following, we describe the dynamics of (29) near the cusped node (u, y, z) = 0 for = 0 (corresponding to v = vs in Fig. 10) for c-values fixed in the interval (39). Here we will blowup (u, y, z, ) = 0 and describe how trajectories that start near Sa will evolve as the pass the folded singularity. Subsequently, we will turn our attention to the cusped saddle-node. For this purpose, we will (essentially) include c in the blowup transformation and blowup (u, y, z, , c) = (0, 0, 0, 0, vs). This will enable us to describe the onset and termination of MMOs.\nRemark 2 The point (u, y) = (0, 0) also has a strong eigendirection for (38) along y = 0 whenever (39) holds. In fact, a direct calculations shows that u\u0307 < 0 along the fold y = f(u2), u 6= 0, and, as a consequence, the strong stable manifold for (38) lies completely within the repelling subset Sr of S in this case, see the red orbit on S in Fig. 11. Therefore, since the direction is reversed on Sr, it follows that (36) does not have a strong canard (in contrast to the standard folded node).\nThe lack of a strong canard relates to another important difference between the folded node and the cusped node. Indeed, for the folded node, there is only one fast direction away from the fold. In contrast, as we see in Fig. 11, there are two separate fast directions (in green, using single headed arrows to indicate the lack of hyperbolicity) away from the cusp. 2"

V\u0302 , being equivalent with V for r > 0, will have improved hyperbolicity properties for r = 0 and it is therefore this vector-field that we will study in the following. To do so we will use certain directional charts [30]. We will focus on two charts: the \u201centry chart\u201d obtained by setting y\u0304 = \u22121 in (41), and the \u201cscaling chart\u201d obtained by setting \u0304 = 1 in (41).

We will refer to these charts as y\u0304 = \u22121 and \u0304 = 1 in the following and the dynamics in each of these are analyzed in the following sections. Notice that the charts (43) and (44) overlap on y\u0304 < 0, \u0304 > 0 and the associated change of coordinates is given by the following expressions:\nr2 = r1 1/4 1 , z2 = z1 \u22123/4 1 , y2 = \u2212 \u22121/2 1 , u2 = u1 \u22121/4 1 , (45)\nfor 1 > 0. In the following, we analyze the dynamics in each of the two charts. The analysis of the remaining charts, required to cover the sphere completely, is similar and therefore left out. We summarize our findings in Fig. 12. We refer to the figure caption for further details. In the following, we will use the convention that a set, say P , will be given a subscript 1 or 2 when expressed in the respective charts y\u0304 = 1 and \u0304 = 1. When the charts overlap, P1 will then be related by P2 under the change of coordinates (45).\nRemark 3 The references [5, 24] also describe a slow-fast cusp singularity in R3 using GSPT and blowup. However, their blowup weights differ from ours since these references consider the cusp in absence of singularities of the reduced flow. The results of [5, 24] therefore generalizes [47] on regular jump points.

(48)\nThen the subset Sa,1 of S1 within u1 \u2208 (\u2212up,1, up,1) is partially attracting, the linearization about any point in this set (r1, u1, z1, 1) \u2208 Sa,1 having one single nonzero and negative eigenvalue. Consequently, by center manifold theory we obtain the following result.\nProposition 3 For any \u03bd > 0 small enough, consider I(\u03bd) := [\u2212up,1 + \u03bd, up,1 \u2212 \u03bd]. Then there exists a three dimensional center manifold Na,1 of points (0, u1, 0, 0), u1 \u2208 I(\u03bd) of the following graph form:\nNa,1 : z1 = u1 ( \u22121 g ( \u22123vs + (9v2s + g)u21 ) +O(r21, 1) ) , (49)\nfor u1 \u2208 I(\u03bd), (r1, 1) \u2208 [0, \u03b4]2 and some \u03b4 > 0 small enough. 2\nIn the expansion (49), we have used that u1 = z1 = 0 is invariant for all r1, 1 \u2265 0.\nAs usual, Na,1 is foliated by constant -values: = r 4 1 1 and Na,1 \u2229 { = r41 1} therefore provides an extension of Fenichel\u2019s slow manifold Sa, , being a perturbation of a compact subset of Sa, up close to the blowup sphere. Specifically, at 1 = \u03b4 we have r1 =\n1/4\u03b4\u22121/4 = O( 1/4) and Na,1 \u2229 { = r41 1}, upon blowing down to the (u, y, z)-variables, therefore extends Sa, as an invariant manifold up to a \u201cwedge-shaped\u201d region of (0, 0, 0) which extends O( 1/4),O( 1/2),O( 3/4) in the u, y, z-directions, respectively, recall (41).\nA direct calculation shows that the reduced problem on Na,1 is given by\nr\u03071 = \u2212 1\n2 r1,\nu\u03071 = u1 ( \u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 +O(u21, r21, 1) ) ,\n\u03071 = 2 1,\n(50)\nrecall (23). Here we have used a desingularization through division by 1 [ vs \u2212 c+O(r21) ] ;\nnotice that the square bracket is positive for any r1 \u2265 0 small enough by assumption of (39). Then for c as in (39), see also (40), one can show that (r1, u1, 1) = 0 is the only equilibrium on Na,1 and it is hyperbolic for (50) with eigenvalues\n\u22121 2 ,\u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 , 2. (51)\nLemma 6 Suppose that (40) holds and that\n\u03bb2 \u03bb1 6= 3.\nThen there is a C1-linearization of (50) of the form:\n(r1, u1, 1) 7\u2192 u\u0303 = \u03c8(r1, u1, 1), (52)\nwhere \u03c8(0, 0, 0) = 0, \u2202\u03c8\u2202u1 (0, 0, 0) = 1, so that\n\u02d9\u0303u1 = u\u03031 ( \u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 ) .\n2\nProof According to the classical work [4], a smooth system x\u0307 = Ax+O(x2), with eigenvalues \u03bdi, i = 1, . . . , n, of the matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, is linearizable by a C1-diffeomorphism if\n\u03bdi 6= Re(\u03bdj + \u03bdk),\nfor all i = 1, . . . , n and all Re \u03bdj < 0 and Re \u03bdk > 0. In the present case, this gives\n\u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 6= \u22121 2 + 2 = 3 2 ,\nsetting \u03bdi = \u2212\u03bb2\u03bb1 + 1 2 , \u03bdj = \u2212 1 2 and \u03bdk = 2, and\n\u22121 2 6= \u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 + 2 = \u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 5 2 ,\nsetting \u03bdi = \u221212 , \u03bdj = \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 12 , and \u03bdk = 2, recall (51). The first inequality clearly holds since the left hand side is negative by (40). Similar, the second inequality implies \u03bb2 6= 3\u03bb1 and the existence of the C1-linearization therefore follows. Seeing that the r1- and 1-equations are already linear, one can easily show that the linearization takes the form (52).\n3.2 Analysis in the \u0304 = 1-chart\nInserting (44) into (29) with \u0307 = 0 augmented gives\nu\u03072 = \u2212z2 \u2212 1\ng\n( 3vsy2 + (9v 2 s + g)u 2 2 +O(r22) ) u2,\ny\u03072 = vs \u2212 c+ r22 ( 1\n2g y2 + 3vs 2g\nu22 +O(r22) ) ,\nz\u03072 = u2,\n(53)\nand r\u03072 = 0, upon division of the right hand side by the common factor r 2 2. All O-terms are smooth. This is our local form of V\u0302 , recall (42). Notice that since \u03b3 : u = z = 0 is invariant for all \u2265 0, the set \u03b32 defined by u2 = z2 = 0 is also invariant for all r2 \u2265 0 and y2 increases for c in the interval (39) for all 0 < r2 1. Consider r2 = 0. Then we obtain\ndu2 dy2 = 1 vs \u2212 c\n( \u2212z2 \u2212 1\ng\n( 3vsy2 + (9v 2 s + g)u 2 2 ) u2 ) ,\ndz2 dy2 = u2 vs \u2212 c .\nLinearization around u2 = z2 = 0 gives\ndU2 dy2 = 1 vs \u2212 c\n( \u2212Z2 \u2212\n3vs g y2U2\n) ,\ndZ2 dy2 = U2 vs \u2212 c .\n(54)\nSetting\ny2 =\n\u221a \u2212g(vs \u2212 c)\n3vs Y2,\nwe can write this system as a Weber equation:\nU \u2032\u20322 (Y2)\u2212 Y2U \u20322(Y2) + \u03bb2 \u03bb1 U2(Y2) = 0, (55)\nrecall (23). The implication of this is the following: Let Na,2(r2) denote the center manifold obtained in the chart y\u0304 = \u22121 written in the \u0304 = 1- coordinates (u2, y2, z2, r2). It is parametrized by r2 =\n1/4 and Na,2(0) denotes the intersection with r2 = 0, i.e. with the blowup sphere.\nWorking in the y\u0304 = 1 chart, for example, we may also obtain a repelling critical manifold N2,r(r2) in much the same way. This extends the repelling slow manifold Sr, into scaling chart as an invariant manifold and we write N2,r(0) to denote the intersection with r2 = 0. We extend each of these manifolds by the flow and denote the extended objects by the same symbol. Then \u03b32 \u2282 Na,2(0) \u2229N2,r(0). Using (55), we have the following.\nLemma 7 The intersection of Na,2(0) and N2,r(0) along \u03b32 is transverse whenever \u03bb2\u03bb1 /\u2208 N. In the affirmative case, the tangent space of Na,2(0) along \u03b32 twists b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c-many times, where each twist corresponds to a full rotation by 180\u25e6 degrees. 2\nProof The proof of this is identical to the proof of [46, Lemma 4.4] for the folded node. Basically, regarding the transversality, we first use that the tangent spaces of Na,2(0) and N2,r(0) along \u03b32 coincide with the set of solutions of (54) having algebraic growth as y2 \u2192 \u2213\u221e, respectively. Next, for \u03bb2\u03bb1 /\u2208 N it is standard that there are no bounded solutions of (55). This proves the transversality. Finally, regarding the number of twists, we use that any solution of (55) having algebraic growth as y2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e has b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c+ 1 simple zeros. Two consecutive zeros correspond to a full 180\u25e6-rotation in the (U2, Z2)-plane and the result therefore follows. Remark 4 Whenever n := \u03bb2\u03bb1 \u2208 N, then U2(Y2) = Hn(Y2/ \u221a\n2), with Hn the Hermite polynomial of degree n, is a bounded solution of (55), see [53]. This means that TNa,2(0) = TNr,2(0) and the tangent spaces form a single band with \u03bb2\u03bb1 -many twists. This may give rise to secondary intersections of Na,2 and Na,r (like secondary canards, see [27, 53]) upon perturbation. But in contrast to the folded node, the bifurcations \u03bb2\u03bb1 \u2208 N do not produce additional intersections of the Fenichel slow manifolds themselves, since in our case we do not have a strong canard, recall Remark 2. See also [27]. We therefore do not pursue the description of these bifurcations any further. 2"

            "text": "We can now state our main results on the dynamics for fixed c in the interval (39). Firstly, following Lemma 7 and the fact that Na,2(r2) and N2,r(r2) are O(r22)-close to Na,2(0) and N2,r(0) in the scaling chart, we conclude:\nProposition 4 The Fenichel slow manifolds Sa, and Sr, intersect transversally along \u03b3 whenever b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c /\u2208 N for all 0 < 1. 2\nRemark 5 A similar result holds for the folded node, see e.g. [46, 53]. But in contrast to these results, we are here deliberately referring to the Fenichel slow manifolds, i.e. the slow manifolds obtained from perturbing compact subsets of Sa and Sr through Fenichel\u2019s theory [15] and extending these by the forward flow. For the general folded node, it is only invariant manifolds \u2013 that have been extended as center-like manifolds \u2013 that are shown to intersect transversally along a weak canard; the Fenichel slow manifolds are only a subset of these extended manifolds. This relates to the delicacy of the weak canard and whether this object in fact ever reaches the Fenichel slow manifolds, see also [27] for a discussion of these technical aspects. The reason why we can be more specific in the present context is that \u03b3, which\nplays the role of the weak canard, exits for all > 0 for our system and this set therefore (locally) belongs to Sa, and Sr, . 2\nWe now proceed to state our main result on the SAOs of the cusped node. For this, we will follow [53] and count, in line with Lemma 7, the number of SAOs as the number of full 180\u25e6-rotations in a plane transverse to \u03b3. More precisely, consider an orbit O : t 7\u2192 (u(t), y(t), z(t)), t \u2208 I := [0, T ], with\n(u(t), z(t)) 6= (0, 0),\nfor all t \u2208 I. The number of SAOs is then the rotation number\nn = b(\u0398(T )\u2212\u0398(0))/\u03c0c,\nwhere \u0398(t) \u2208 R, t \u2208 [0, T ], is the lift of the angle \u03b8(t) \u2208 R/2\u03c0Z defined by tan\u03c6(t) = z(t)u(t) , t \u2208 [0, T ]. Similarly, we define the amplitude of the SAOs as maxt\u2208[0,T ] |(u(t), z(t))|. (In Theorem 3, however, we will measure the amplitude in terms of |(u2(t), z2(t))|).\nIn the following, we write f = f(\u00b5) \u223c \u00b5 whenever there are positive constants c1 < c2 such that\nc1\u00b5 \u2264 f(\u00b5) \u2264 c2\u00b5,\nfor all 0 < \u00b5 1.\nTheorem 2 Fix c as in (39), any \u03b4 > 0 sufficiently small and suppose that\n\u03bb2 \u03bb1 /\u2208 N.\nConsider any point p so that \u03c0a(p) \u2208 Sa\\\u03b3, recall (35). Then the following holds for all 0 < 1: The forward orbit of p intersects the section defined by y = yexit := ( \u03b4 \u22121)1/2 in a point (u, y, z) = (uexit, yexit, zexit) with\nuexit \u223c \u03bb2 2\u03bb1 , zexit \u223c 1 2 + \u03bb2 2\u03bb1 , (56)\nand undergoes b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c many SAOs. The order of the amplitude of the SAOs are given by (56). 2\nProof We first work in the y\u0304 = \u22121 chart. Then the forward flow of the point p can be described by the reduced problem (50). We therefore integrate these equations from (r10, u10, 10) to (r11, u11, 11) with 11 = \u03b4 > 0. Here r10, u10 = O(1) and 10 \u223c as \u2192 0 by assumption on \u03c0a(p) /\u2208 \u03b3. To perform the integration, we apply Lemma 6 and consider\nr\u03071 = \u2212 1\n2 r1,\n\u02d9\u0303u1 = u\u03031 ( \u2212\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + 1 2 ) ,\n\u03071 = 2 1.\nIntegrating these equations gives\nu\u030311 = ( \u2212111 10 ) \u03bb2 2\u03bb1 \u2212 1 4 u\u030310,\nand r11 = ( \u03b4 \u22121)1/4. Therefore u11 \u223c\n\u03bb2 2\u03bb1 \u2212 1\n4 using (52). We then transform the result using (45) to the scaling chart. Here we apply regular perturbation theory from y2 = \u2212\u03b4\u22121/3, which corresponds to 1 = \u03b4, up to y2 = \u03b4\u22121/3. This value of y2 corresponds to yexit. Now, the order of the amplitude of u2 and z2 does not change during this finite time passage. Using (49) and (43), we therefore finally obtain (56). The number of small amplitude oscillations follow from Lemma 7 upon taking \u03b4 > 0 small enough (and subsequently > 0 small enough)."

The analysis is straightforward and illustrated in Fig. 14. In particular, the associated layer problem has the set (47) as a manifold of equilibria, being attracting for u1 \u2208 (\u2212up, up) and repelling for u1 /\u2208 [\u2212up,1, up,1], recall (48). The reduced problem has a stable node at (u1, z1) = 0 on the attracting branch and we are therefore in the \u201crelaxation regime\u201d, but the relaxation oscillations for 1 > 0 small enough are repelling. (Notice that in contrast to (2), the middle branch of the critical manifold of (60) is attracting. Compare also Fig. 1 with Fig. 14.)

In particular, P1(0) is a singular slow-fast relaxation cycle. 2\n4.2 Analysis in the \u0304 = 1-chart\nThe resulting equations can be obtained from (53) upon substituting (57). We have\nu\u03072 = \u2212z2 \u2212 1\ng\n( 3vsy2 + (9v 2 s + g)u 2 2 +O(r22) ) u2,\ny\u03072 = r 2 2 ( \u2212c2 + 1\n2g y2 + 3vs 2g\nu22 +O(r22) ) ,\nz\u03072 = u2,\n(61)\nand r\u03072 = 0.

In particular, we notice that\n\u03b32 : u2 = z2 = 0, y2 \u2208 R,\nis now a critical manifold for r2 = 0. In fact, the associated fast sub-system\nu\u03072 = \u2212z2 \u2212 1\ng\n( 3vsy2 + (9v 2 s + g)u 2 2 ) u2,\nz\u03072 = u2,\n(62)\nwith y2 fixed as a parameter for r2 = 0, is a Lienard equation.\nLemma 9 The system (62) has a unique repelling limit cycle P2(y2) for each y2 < 0. 2\nProof This follows from Lienard\u2019s theorem [40]. In fact, (62) is topologically equivalent with the van-der Pol system in backward time. In particular, there is a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of (62) at y2 = 0.\nBy uniqueness, the set P2 coincides with P1 upon using the change of coordinates (45) where these overlap.\nBy Fenichel\u2019s theory [15], the manifold P2 of repelling limit cycles of (61) for r2 = 0, perturbs as an invariant manifold P2,r2 within compact subsets. It creates a funnel region, where trajectories inside contract towards \u03b32, while trajectories outside get repelled away from the local neighborhood of the cusp. On the perturbed cylinder, repelling limit cycles may exist. This depends upon c2. Indeed, the reduced problem on P2 is given by averaging:\nLet T (y2) be the period of P2(y2) as a periodic orbit (u2(t; y2), z2(t; y2)) of (62). Then\ny\u20322 = \u2212c2 + 1\n2g y2 + 3vs 2g 1\nT (y2) \u222b T (y2) 0 u2(t; y2) 2dt, (63)\non P2. Consequently, the reduced problem has an equilibrium at y2 for the parameter value c2 whenever\nc2 = 1\n2g y2 + 3vs 2g 1\nT (y2) \u222b T (y2) 0 u2(t; y2) 2dt, y2 < 0. (64)\nNotice that y2 = 0 on the right hand side gives c2 = 0. It is possible to show that u(t, y2) = 2 \u221a \u2212y2vs 9v2s+g\ncos(t) +O(y2) (using e.g. a Melnikov computation, see [28], where a similar computation is performed in a related context). This gives a linear approximation of the right hand side of (64):\nc2 \u2248 3v2s + g\n2g(9v2s + g) y2. (65)\nConsequently, the right hand side is a decreasing function of y2 for y2 < 0 small enough for g < 0. Numerical computations (see Fig. 15) indicate that this holds for all y2 < 0. We have not found a way to show this, but if we assume this, then we have the following result.\nProposition 6 Suppose that the right hand side of (64) is a strictly decreasing function of y2 < 0. Fix any c20 > 0 and let y20 be the unique value y2 such that (64) holds with c2 = c20. Then the reduced problem (63) on P2 has a unique attracting fixed point at y2 = y20 for the parameter value c2 = c20.\nMoreover, for all 0 < r2 1, the corresponding singular cycle P2(y20) then perturbs to a hyperbolic (saddle-type) limit cycle P2,r2(y20) of (61) for c2 = c20. This limit cycle is O(r22)-close to P2(y20). 2\nAs c2 ranges over a compact subset I of (0,\u221e), we then obtain a family of repelling limit cycles on P2,r2 for all 0 < \u2264 0(I). Recall that r2 = 1/4. It is possible to show that the family P2,r2 overlaps with the repelling Hopf cycles emanating from y2 = 0 at c2 = 0, recall Remark 6.\nRemark 6 The Liapunov coefficient l1 (recall (7)) of the Hopf bifurcation for c2 = 0 (corresponding to c = vs(g)) can be calculated from (61). Indeed, a direction calculation shows that the two-dimensional center manifold at the Hopf-point takes the following form\ny2 \u2248 \u2212 3vs 2 u22 \u2212 3vs 2 z22 ,\nfor c2, r2 \u2192 0, up to and including quadratic order in (u2, z2). On this center manifold, with c2, r2 \u2192 0, we then have that\nu\u03072 = \u2212z2 + f(u2, z2), z\u03072 = u2,\n(66)\nwith\nf(u2, z2) \u2248 \u2212 1\ng\n( \u22129\n2 v2sz 2 2 +\n( 9\n2 v2s + g\n) u22 ) u2,\nup to an including cubic order in (u2, z2). The system (66) is already in normal form and we therefore have that\nl\u03021 := 1\n16\n( \u22023f\n\u2202u32 (0, 0) +\n\u22023f\n\u2202u2\u2202z22 (0, 0)\n) =\n3(g \u2212 3) 8g\nusing [19, Equation 3.4.11]. This gives the leading order expression in (7) upon division by r22 = \u221a . This division corresponds to the desingularization in the chart \u0304 = 1, recall (42). 2\nWe now proceed to study the properties of the critical manifold\n\u03b32 : u2 = z2 = 0, y2 \u2208 R,\nof (61) for r2 = 0. The linearization of (62) around u2 = z2 = 0 gives( \u22123vsg y2 \u22121\n1 0\n) . (67)\nThe eigenvalues are imaginary \u00b1i for y2 = 0 due to the Hopf. From this we can easily deduce the stability properties.\nLemma 10 The critical manifold \u03b32 of (61) for r2 = 0 is normally hyperbolic for y2 6= 0. The subset \u03b3a2 with y2 < 0 is attracting whereas the subset \u03b3r2 with y2 > 0 is repelling. Moreover, \u03b3 r 2 = \u03b3 rf 2 \u222a \u03b3rn2 where \u03b3 rf 2 is the subset of\n\u03b32 with y2 \u2208 ( 0,\u2212 2g3vs ) having normal focus stability (i.e. the eigenvalues of (67) are complex conjugated with positive real part) whereas \u03b3rn2 is the subset of \u03b3r2 with y2 \u2265 \u2212 2g 3vs\nhaving normal nodal stability (i.e. the eigenvalues of (67) are real and positive). 2\nThere is a similar division of \u03b3a2 = \u03b3 af 2 \u222a \u03b3an2 for y2 \u2208 ( 2g 3vs , 0 )\nand y2 \u2264 2g3vs , respectively, but this will be less important.\nThe reduced problem on \u03b32 is given by\ny\u20322 = \u2212c2 + 1\n2g y2.\nIt has a hyperbolic and attracting equilibrium at y2 = 2c2g. In combination with Lemma 10, we realize the following.\nLemma 11 Let q2 denote the equilibrium (u2, y2, z2) = (0, 2c2g, 0) which is hyperbolic and attracting for the reduced problem on \u03b32. Then the following holds.\n\u2022 For c2 > 0, then q2 sits on the attracting part of \u03b32 and it perturbs to an attracting equilibrium (61) for all 0 < 1.\n\u2022 For c2 \u2208 ( \u2212 13vs , 0 ) , then q2 \u2208 \u03b3rf2 and it perturbs to a saddle-focus\nequilibrium of (61) for all 0 < 1 with a one-dimensional stable manifold along \u03b32 and a two-dimensional unstable manifold with focustype dynamics.\n\u2022 For c2 < \u2212 13vs , then q2 \u2208 \u03b3 rn 2 and it perturbs to a saddle equilibrium of\n(61) for all 0 < 1 with a one-dimensional stable manifold along \u03b32 and a two-dimensional unstable manifold with nodal-type dynamics. 2\nWe illustrate the findings in the \u0304 = 1-chart in Fig. 16. See figure caption for further details. We are now ready to describe our main result on small amplitude oscillations for the cusped saddle-node.\nTheorem 3 Consider c as in (57) with c2 \u2208 ( \u2212 13vs , 0 ) fixed and any point p so that \u03c0a(p) \u2208 Sa\\\u03b3. Then the following holds for all 0 < 1: The forward orbit of p intersects the section defined by y = 0 in a point (u, y, z) = (u0, 0, z0) with\nu0, z0 = O(e\u2212c/ \u221a ). (68)\nThe number of SAOs of the forward orbit is unbounded as \u2192 0, but finitely many are O(1) in amplitude in the (u2, z2)-plane. 2\nProof For c2 \u2208 ( \u2212 13vs , 0 ) , q2 belongs to \u03b3 rf 2 and is of saddle-focus type, recall Lemma 11. (68) follows directly from the exponentially contraction e\u2212c\u03c4/ \u221a towards the invariant \u03b3a2 on the slow time scale \u03c4 of (61); recall that r2 = 1/4. Due to the focus behavior of \u03b32 near y2 = 0, recall Lemma 10, the forward orbit will experience an unbounded number of SAOs as \u2192 0. These will be exponentially small in amplitude. Moreover, since \u03c0a(p) \u2208 Sa\\\u03b3 and \u03b32 is the stable manifold of q2, the forward orbit of p will extend along \u03b3 rf 2 , remaining exponential close for all y2 \u2208 [0, y21(c2)], for some 0 < y21(c2) < 2c2g. Beyond this, the orbit will eventually be repelled away from \u03b32 due\nto the unstable manifold of q2. Since q2 \u2208 \u03b3rf2 for c2 \u2208 ( \u2212 13vs , 0 ) , we obtain finitely many O(1) SAOs due to the focus dynamics in the (u2, z2)-projection at some distance from q2. This completes the proof.\nRemark 7 With the assumptions of Theorem 3, there is a bifurcation delay along \u03b32. For the statement of the theorem, we did not need to determine this delay in details. However, due to the invariance of \u03b32, it can be determined by a way-in/way-out function in the following way: Let\n\u03bd\u00b1(y2) = \u2212 3vs 2g y2 \u00b1 1 2 \u221a 9v2s 4g2 y22 \u2212 4, (69)\ndenote the eigenvalues of (67). Then for c2 < 0 the exit point y2,exit \u2208 (0, 2c2g) is for r2 \u2192 0 determined by\u222b y2,exit\n\u2212\u221e\nRe \u03bd+(y2)\n\u2212c2 + 12gy2 dy2 = 0. (70)\n(The integral is convergent since Re \u03bd+(y2)\u2212c2+ 12g y2 \u2248 \u22124g 2 3vsy22 for y2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and y2,exit > 0 exists and is unique for each c2 < 0 since Re \u03bd+(y2)\n\u2212c2+ 12g y2 \u2192 \u221e for y2 \u2192 2c2g\u2212.\ny2,exit(c2) is also continuous and y2,exit(0 \u2212) = 0.) The integral gives a lengthy expression and we have not found a way to solve for y2,exit. We therefore only present a diagram (obtained in Matlab) for g = \u22121, see Fig. 17 and the figure caption for further details, of y2,exit as a function of c2.\nDue the invariance of \u03b32, the delay for our system (1) is different from the bifurcation delay for the folded saddle-node, see e.g. [31]. Indeed, for the folded saddle-node, the delay for analytic systems depends upon (following [36, 37]) buffer points. If we were to break the symmetry of (1), then one would like to rely on the same methods. But this could be problematic in this context, since the center manifold in Proposition 2 is not expected to be analytic. 2\nA similar result holds for c2 < \u2212 13vs , but due to the normal nodal dynamics along \u03b3rn all SAOs may be exponentially small in this case. We see this in Fig. 17 for the value of g = \u22121. In particular, for c2 < \u22120.42 the exit point (green part of curve) is in the normal nodal regime where there are no additional O(1)-oscillations when the trajectory separate from \u03b32. For c2 > 0, on the other hand, the forward flow of p is attracted to the stable equilibrium near q2.\nRemark 8 Formally, the scaling (57) does not overlap with the regime covered by Theorem 2 where c is fixed in a compact subset of c < vs. There is therefore a gap that we do not cover in this paper. However, to cover this gap, and obtain a complete description of c in a full neighborhood of vs, one could include c in the blowup transformation (41) as follows\nc = vs + r 2c\u0304,\nand consider (u\u0304, y\u0304, z\u0304, \u0304, c\u0304) \u2208 S4. In particular, in this way, one could cover the gap by working in the directional chart corresponding to c\u0304 = \u22121. Notice that the associated scaling chart \u0304 = 1 gives rise to the same coordinates (u2, y2, z2, r2, c2) where c = vs+r\n2c2 in agreement with (57). (This also motivates the use of the subscript on c, recall the convention before Remark 3.) We shall not pursue this further in the present paper. 2"

            "text": "In this paper, we have analyzed cusped singularities (cusped node and cusped saddle-node) and demonstrated that they form a mechanism for SAOs in two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units with symmetric and repulsive coupling. As for the folded node, we showed that the number of SAOs is determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues of the cusped node (upon desingularization). Similarly, we showed that the cusped saddle-node marks the onset of SAOs. Although there are many similarities between the folded singularities and the cusped versions studied in the present paper, there are also several differences, see e.g. Remark 2 and\nLemma 9. Perhaps most importantly, our cusped node does not have a strong canard and there are also two fast directions away from the cusp (u increasing and u decreasing in Fig. 8), as opposed to just one in the case of the standard folded singularity. The latter property also has consequences on MMOs and the LAOs that we see in Fig. 2. For the folded node, MMOs occur if there is return to the funnel region, see [6]. The same is true in the present case, but it is slightly more subtle. Suppose (for definiteness) that there is a return mechanism to Sa\\\u03b3, leaving the cusp region along the positive u-direction. Then as a consequence of Theorem 2, we obtain the following: Let b\u03bb2\u03bb1 c be even (odd) and suppose that the return to Sa is on the u-positive side (u-negative side, respectively) of \u03b3. Then we have (\u201cone-sided\u201d) MMOs for all 0 < 1 with u always increasing upon passage through the cusp. However, if affirmative, then the system (1) \u2013 due to the symmetry S \u2013 also has MMOs with u always decreasing upon passage through the cusp. In fact, more generally, once we have a return to Sa\\\u03b3 along one direction (u-positive or u-negative), then the symmetry give rise to a return along the other direction (u-negative or u-positive, respectively) too. We can then also have (\u201cmixed\u201d) MMOs where u alternates sign upon passing through the cusp f1. We see this in Fig. 2 for c = 1.27. Indeed, here there is an alternation between v1 and v2 being increasing (v2, respectively, v1 decreasing) which precisely corresponds to a change in sign in u. The description of the return mechanism for (1), and whether we have \u201cone-sided\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d MMOs, require a careful analysis of the layer problem (13) but also of the reduced problem (14) (away from the cusp). We leave such an analysis to future work.\nIn future work, it would also be interesting to study the cusped singularities in a general setting without a symmetry. We already have some partial results in this direction. The cusped node then becomes a co-dimension one bifurcation of a folded node that transverses the cusp upon parameter variation. In line with our findings, the number of SAOs does not change upon this passage. Within this context, it would also be interesting in future work to study the secondary canards and the role of a strong canard.\nSimilarly, the cusped saddle-node becomes co-dimension two without the symmetry. However, going from a folded saddle-node to a cusped saddlenode seems slightly more involved. A folded saddle-node (type II) is accompanied by a canard-like explosion of limit cycles (due to the strong canard), see also [28]. In our symmetric cusped saddle-node there is no explosion, but instead a cylinder on which limit cycles occur, recall Proposition 6. It is unclear how this scenario unfolds without the symmetry and how it precisely connects to the folded saddle-node. Moreover, a folded saddle-node actually comes in two versions. We have only focused on type II in this manuscript [30], but there is also a type I [50]. Future research should also uncover how the generalized cusped saddle-node relates to these."
