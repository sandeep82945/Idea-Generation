            "text": "Successful colonization of a multitude of ecological niches by the bacterium Pseudomonas 9 aeruginosa relies on its ability to respond to concentrations of self-produced signal molecules. 10 This intercellular communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) tightly regulates the 11 expression of virulence determinants and a diversity of survival functions, including those 12 required for social behaviours. In planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa, the transcriptional 13 regulator LasR is generally considered on top of the QS circuitry hierarchy; its activation relies 14 on binding to 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL), a product of the LasI synthase. 15 Transcription of lasI is activated by LasR, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Few studies 16 have looked at the function of QS during surface growth even though P. aeruginosa typically 17 lives in biofilm-like communities under natural conditions. Here, we show that surface-grown P. 18 aeruginosa readily produces 3-oxo-C12-HSL in absence of LasR, and that this phenotype is 19 frequent upon surface association in naturally occurring environmental and clinical LasR-20 defective isolates, suggesting a conserved alternative function for the signal. Indeed, even in the 21 absence of the cognate regulator LasR, 3-oxo-C12-HSL upregulates the autologous expression of 22 pyocyanin and of LasR-controlled virulence determinants in neighboring cells. This highlights a 23 possible role for 3-oxo-C12-HSL in shaping community responses and provides a possible 24 evolutive benefit for mixed populations to carry LasR-defective cells, a common feature of 25 natural of P. aeruginosa. 26 27\nIMPORTANCE 28\nThe bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes and thrives in many environments, in which 29 it is typically found in surface-associated polymicrobial communities known as biofilms. 30 Adaptation to this social behavior is aided by quorum sensing (QS), an intercellular 31 communication system pivotal in the expression of social traits. Regardless of its importance in 32 QS regulation, the loss of function of the master regulator LasR is now considered a conserved 33 adaptation of P. aeruginosa, irrespective of the origin of strains. By investigating the QS 34 circuitry in surface-grown cells, we found accumulation of QS signal 3-oxo-C12-HSL in absence 35 of its cognate receptor and activator, LasR. The current understanding of the QS circuit, mostly 36 based on planktonic growing cells, is challenged by investigating the QS circuitry of surface-37 grown cells. This provides a new perspective on the beneficial aspects that underline the 38 frequency of LasR-deficient isolates. 39\nINTRODUCTION 40\nBacteria are social organisms that often respond to environmental cues in coordination. 41 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very adaptable Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes diverse 42 ecological niches. The flexibility of this opportunist human pathogen is aided by several 43 regulatory networks, assuring proper responses to changing environmental conditions. Quorum 44 sensing (QS) is a gene expression regulation mechanism based on the production, release, 45 detection and response to diffusible signaling molecules that synchronizes the transcription of 46 target genes in a population density-dependent manner (1). In P. aeruginosa, three interlinked 47 QS systems regulate the expression of hundreds of genes \u2013 including several encoding virulence 48 determinants (2). In this bacterium, QS regulation is structured as a hierarchical network 49 composed of two N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-based circuits (las and rhl) and the pqs 50 system, that relies on signaling molecules of the 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinoline (HAQ) family. The 51 las and rhl systems comprise an AHL synthase (LasI and RhlI) responsible for the syntheses of 52 N\u2010(3\u2010oxododecanoyl)\u2010L\u2010homoserine lactone (3-oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL) and N\u2010butanoyl\u2010L\u2010homoserine 53 lactone (C4\u2010HSL), respectively (3, 4). These autoinducers activate their cognate LuxR-type 54 transcriptional regulators \u2013 LasR and RhlR, which in turn can induce the transcription of target 55 QS-regulated genes. Under standard laboratory conditions, the las system is generally considered 56 to be atop the regulatory hierarchy. Once activated by the binding with its cognate autoinducer, 57 LasR regulates several virulence traits such as the elastase LasB (lasB) (5, 6). LasR also induces 58 the transcription of the LasI synthase coding gene, creating a positive feedback loop (7). The pqs 59 system relies on the LysR-type transcriptional regulator MvfR (also known as PqsR) (8, 9). The 60 latter directly activates the operons pqsABCDE and phnAB, both required for HAQ biosynthesis, 61 and indirectly regulates the expression of many other QS-regulated genes via PqsE (8, 10-14). 62 MvfR has dual ligands as it can be induced by 4\u2010hydroxy\u20102\u2010heptylquinoline (HHQ) and the 63 Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS; 3,4-dihydroxy-2-alkylquinoline), both members of the 64 HAQ family (15, 16). The rhl and pqs circuits are directly and positively regulated by LasR, 65 which induces the transcription of rhlR and rhlI as well as mvfR (13, 15, 17, 18). 66\nIn addition to sensing the surrounding chemical environment, bacteria are also responsive to 67 mechanical signals, such as those involved in the physical encounter of the cell with surfaces or 68 with each other. Indeed, several behaviors are specific to life on surfaces, including movement 69 on semi-solid (swarming motility) and solid surfaces (twitching motility) as well as biofilm 70 formation (19-21). Not surprisingly, virulence is also induced by surface attachment as many 71 infection strategies require contact with the host (22-24). Even though QS and surface-sensing 72 regulate many of the same social behaviors, little is known about how these different regulatory 73 cues converge to modulate bacterial responses. Exploring the link between surface-sensing and 74 QS is particularly relevant as P. aeruginosa readily adopts a surface-attached mode of growth as 75 biofilms in its natural habitats. Biofilms are organized communities encased in a self-produced 76 exopolymeric matrix. In the context of infections, biofilms contribute to host immune evasion 77\nand delay antibiotic penetration (25, 26). In fact, P. aeruginosa persists as biofilms in the lungs 78 of people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (27). 79\nWhile the emergence of LasR-defective mutants has long been associated with adaptation to the 80 CF lung environment (28-31), it is actually a common feature of P. aeruginosa from diverse 81 environments (32, 33). Interestingly, some LasR-defective isolates, known as RAIL (for RhlR 82 active independently of LasR), retain a functional RhlR regulator (31, 32, 34-37). Their sustained 83 QS responses are in line with our previous report showing that in the presence of a nonfunctional 84 LasR, RhlR acts as a surrogate activator for a set of LasR-regulated genes (38). It is noteworthy 85 that in the wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PA14 background, surface-sensing upregulates lasR, 86 and that surface-grown cells induce LasR targets more strongly than their planktonic counterpart 87 (39). Thus, surface-sensing appears to sensitize cells to the cognate autoinducer 3-oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL. 88 Considering the prevalence of LasR-defective mutants, unable to produce nor respond to 3-oxo\u201089 C12\u2010HSL, we wondered how P. aeruginosa would respond to surface attachment, as biofilm 90 formation is essential to this bacterium physiology and pathology. 91\nIn this study, we investigated the effect of surface-sensing on QS responses of LasR-defective 92 strains. We found that, upon surface attachment, LasR becomes dispensable to the production of 93 3-oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL. This response is conserved among naturally occurring environmental and 94 clinical LasR-defective isolates. Production of 3-oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL modulates the production of 95 virulence factors at the individual (LasR-defective background) and community levels (mixed 96 with LasR-responsive cells). As a result, virulence of mixed populations, composed of LasR-97 responsive and LasR-defective cells, is accentuated. We propose that the production of 3-oxo\u201098 C12\u2010HSL by LasR-negative cells, modulating biological bacterial responses on diverse levels, has 99 a positive role in shaping community responses of the population. 100\n101\nMATERIALS AND METHODS 102\nBacterial strains and growth conditions 103 Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. 104 Oligonucleotides used are listed in Table S1. Bacteria were routinely grown in tryptic soy broth 105 (TSB; BD Difco, Canada) at 37\u00b0C in a TC-7 roller drum (NB, Canada) at 240 rpm or on 106 Lysogeny Broth (LB; BD Difco, Canada) agar plates. For quantification of QS signaling 107 molecules and related data, King\u2019s A broth (planktonic growth) or King\u2019s A agar (surface-108 associated growth) supplemented with 100 \u00b5M FeCl3 were used (40). For the latter, sterile 109 King\u2019s A agar was poured into each well of a 96-well plate (200 \u00b5l per well) and allowed to 110 solidify at the center of a biosafety cabinet. When needed, the following concentrations of 111 antibiotics were included: for Escherichia coli 100 \u00b5g/ml carbenicillin, 15 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin, and 112 15 \u00b5g/ml tetracycline. Diaminopimelic acid (DAP) was added to cultures of the auxotroph E. 113 coli \u03c77213 at 62.5 \u03bcg/ml. Irgasan (20 \u00b5g/ml) was used as a counter-selection agent against E. 114\ncoli. For P. aeruginosa, 300 \u00b5g/ml carbenicillin, 30 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin, and tetracycline at 125 115 \u00b5g/ml (solid) or 75 \u00b5g/ml (liquid). 116 117\n119\n121\nConstruction of in-frame deletion mutants 122 An allelic exchange technique based on the use of a suicide vector was used to construct gene 123 knockout deletions (46). Mutant alleles, flanked by regions of homology to the recipient 124 chromosome, were synthesized in vitro by PCR from PA14 genomic DNA and then cloned into 125 the allelic exchange vector pEX18Ap (yielding pTOP01, pTOP02, pTOP03, and pTOP04). 126 Plasmids were assembled from purified PCR products and restriction enzyme-cleaved plasmid 127 backbone by employing a seamless strategy of ligation-independent cloning (pEASY\u00ae -Uni 128 Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit, TransGen Biotech Co.). These suicide vectors were 129 transferred into P. aeruginosa by conjugation with E. coli donor strain (SM10). Carbenicillin 130 was used to select recipient merodiploid cells and E. coli donor cells were counter-selected using 131 Irgasan. Double-crossover mutants were isolated by sucrose counter-selection and confirmed by 132 PCR. 133 134 Inactivation of pilU gene 135 Transfer of transposon insertion (::MrT7) from the PA14 non-redundant transposon insertion 136 mutant library was used (47) to inactivate pilU. Genomic DNA from pilU::MrT7 (mutant ID # 137 53607) was extracted and transformed into the recipient PA14 \u2206lasR background. Gentamicin 138 (15 \u00b5g/ml) was used to select transformants. 139 140 Construction of chromosomal reporter strains 141 The promoter region of lasI was PCR-amplified from PA14 genomic DNA. pTOP05 (mini-142 CTX-lasI-lux) was constructed by the assembly of the purified PCR product and the enzyme-143 cleaved mini-CTX-lux backbone (48). pTOP05, pCTX-1-PlasB-lux and pCDS101 were integrated 144\ninto the attB chromosomal site of PA14 and isogenic mutants by conjugation on LB agar plates. 145 Selection was performed on LB agar plates containing tetracycline. 146 147 Luminescence reporter measurements 148 For lux reporter readings, luminescence was measured using a Cytation 3 multimode plate reader 149 (BioTek Instruments, USA). Relative light units (RLU) were normalized by colony-forming 150 units per mL-1 (reported in RLU CFU-1). When mentioned, AHLs were added to a final 151 concentration of 1.5 \u03bcM of C4-HSL and 3 \u03bcM of 3-oxo-C12-HSL from stocks prepared in high-152 performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade acetonitrile. Acetonitrile only was added in 153 controls. 154 155 Quantification of QS signaling molecules 156 Concentration of 3-oxo-C12-HSL was measured for bacteria grown in liquid King\u2019s A 157 (planktonic growth) and on King\u2019s A agar (surface growth) using HPLC/tandem mass 158 spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as previously described (49). Quantification was performed at 159 indicated times post-inoculation in both growth conditions. For planktonic growth, overnight 160 cultures grown on TSB were diluted to OD600 0.1 in fresh King\u2019s A medium. At the given time-161 points, cultures were mixed with acetonitrile containing the internal standard tetradeuterated 4-162 hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ-d4), in a 4:1 ratio of culture to solvent (HHQ-d4 final 163 concentration of 3 ppm). Bacterial suspension was vortexed and centrifuged at maximum speed 164 for 10 min in order to pellet bacterial cells. The resulting mixture was transferred into vials for 165 LC/MS/MS analyses. Alternatively, for cells grown on agar surfaces, overnight cultures on TSB 166 were diluted to OD600 0.05 in TSB medium. Cultures were grown until an OD600 of 1 and agar 167 plugs were inoculated with 5 \u00b5l of bacterial suspension. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 168 samples were collected at the indicated time-points. Each sample was composed of two agar 169 plugs mixed with 1 mL of acetonitrile containing the internal standard. This mixture was 170 incubated at 4\u00b0C for 16h under gentle agitation, optimizing the diffusion of signaling molecules 171 from the agar to the solvent. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at maximum speed 172 for 10 min and the resulting supernatant was transferred into a LC/MS vial. All samples were 173 injected using an HPLC Waters 2795 (Mississauga, ON, Canada) on a Kinetex C8 column 174 (Phenomenex) with an acetonitrile-water gradient containing 1% acetic acid. The detector was a 175 tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Quattro premier XE; Waters) equipped with a Z-spray 176 interface using electrospray ionization in positive mode (ESI+). Nitrogen was used as a 177 nebulizing and drying gas at flow rates of 15 and 100 ml \u00b7 min\u22121, respectively. Concentration was 178 normalized by CFUs per mL-1 and reported in ng CFU-1. All experiments were performed in 179 triplicates and repeated at least twice independently. 180 181 Pyocyanin quantification 182 Quantification of pyocyanin produced by surface-grown cells was performed similarly to 183 previously described in (50). Overnight cultures were diluted and grown in TSB until an OD600 184\nof 1. At this point, 5 \u03bcL were used to inoculate agar plugs from a 96-well plate containing King\u2019s 185 A agar supplemented with FeCl3 (200 \u03bcL per well). Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24h. 186 Pyocyanin was extracted in 500 \u03bcL of chloroform from two agar plugs (by replicate). Tubes 187 were vortexed and centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 x g. 200 \u03bcL of the organic phase was 188 recovered in a new tube and a second chloroform extraction was performed on the plugs. The 189 organic phase (400 \u03bcL) was acidified with 500 \u03bcL 0.2 N HCl and vortexed. The samples were 190 centrifuged for 3 min at 12,000 x g and the absorbance of the pink aqueous phase was read at 191 OD520 nm. Blank was performed by pyocyanin extraction from uninoculated agar plugs. Values 192 were corrected by colony-forming units per mL-1 from samples prepared in the same conditions. 193 194 Drosophila melanogaster feeding assay 195 Fruit flies (D. melanogaster) were infected orally in a feeding assay model (51). Male flies (4- to 196 6-days old) were anesthetized under a gentle stream of carbon dioxide and separated into vials, 197 each containing 10 males. Each strain (or condition) tested was composed of three independent 198 vials, totalizing 30 flies. Vials were prepared with 5 mL of a solution of sucrose agar (5% of 199 sucrose and 1.5% agar). Once solidified, a sterile filter disk was placed on the surface. Prior to 200 infection, bacteria were grown in 6 mL of TSB until an OD600 of 3. At this point, the bacterial 201 suspension was centrifuged 3 min at 12,000 x g and the pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of 202 sterile 5% sucrose and dispensed on the filter papers. Sterile 5% sucrose alone was used as 203 control. Males were starved 6-8h prior to the infection. Flies were kept at 25\u00b0C and about 50% 204 humidity. They were subjected to 12 hrs cycles of light/dark. Mortality was monitored daily for 8 205 days. The experiment was performed twice, each time in triplicate. 206\n207\nRESULTS 208\nSurface growth induces production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in the absence of LasR. In P. 209 aeruginosa prototypical strains such as PA14, the quorum sensing regulatory cascade is 210 considered to be primarily activated by the las system. LasR, once activated by the binding of 3-211 oxo-C12-HSL, regulates the transcription of target genes, including the gene coding the LasI 212 synthase. This process induces the production of more 3-oxo-C12-HSL, resulting in a positive 213 feedback loop. In standard laboratory liquid cultures of P. aeruginosa, production of 3-oxo-C12-214 HSL peaks early and decreases overtime ((11); Fig. 1A). We note the same pattern of production 215 in wild-type P. aeruginosa PA14 (WT) cells grown on an agar surface (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, in 216 a LasR-negative background, the production pattern of 3-oxo-C12-HSL is influenced by 217 suspended vs surface culture conditions (Fig. 1). As expected, production of the LasR ligand is 218 barely detectable at the stationary phase of a \u0394lasR mutant in broth cultures. However, its 219 concentration is elevated during surface growth (Figs. 1A and B). In WT culture, the peak 220 concentration is observed during the exponential growth phase while it shifts to late-stationary 221\nphase in the \u0394lasR mutant, solely when growing on the surface. This shift might indicate a role 222 for other regulators in the activation of lasI transcription in the absence of LasR. 223 224 Production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and expression of lasI are RhlR-dependant in LasR-negative 225 backgrounds. Expression of the gene coding the LasI synthase, responsible for the synthesis of 226 3-oxo-C12-HSL, is typically considered to be regulated by LasR. Therefore, little to no 227 production of this AHL is expected in LasR-defective strains, which is what is observed in 228 planktonic cultures. However, upon surface growth, 3-oxo-C12-HSL is produced in the absence 229 of LasR. To make sure the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in this condition still requires LasI 230 activity, we measured concentrations of this AHL in a \u0394lasI mutant grown under the same 231 surface-associated conditions. As expected, 3-oxo-C12-HSL is not detectable in a \u0394lasI mutant, 232 irrespective of the growth phase (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that transcription of lasI can 233 occur in absence of LasR upon surface growth. To further investigate this, we measured the 234 activity of a chromosomal lasI-lux reporter in a \u0394lasR background in both planktonic and 235 surface-grown cells. In agreement with the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL, transcription of lasI 236 was observed in LasR-negative background grown on a surface (Fig. 2B). 237 238 We have previously reported that RhlR can act as a surrogate regulator of LasR-dependent 239 factors in the absence of LasR (38). In P. aeruginosa planktonic cultures, this activation is seen 240 by the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL at late stationary phase in LasR-negative backgrounds. 241 However, as shown in Fig. 1A, the concentration of this AHL in a \u0394lasR mutant in broth cultures 242 remains extremely low early on. In contrast, surface growth readily induces production and the 243 corresponding upregulation of lasI transcription in a \u0394lasR mutant (Figs. 1A and 2B). To verify 244 if RhlR is responsible for this upregulation, we measured concentrations of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in a 245 \u0394rhlR and a double lasR rhlR mutant (Figs. 3 and S1) upon surface growth. The production 246 profile of 3-oxo-C12-HSL is similar between the WT and a \u0394rhlR mutant, peaking at exponential 247 growth phase and decaying overtime (Fig. S1). The concomitant inactivation of lasR and rhlR 248 abrogates 3-oxo-C12-HSL production, which concurs with our previous finding of RhlR being 249 the alternative activator of lasI in LasR-negative backgrounds (Figs. 3 and S1). This result 250 suggests that the transcription of lasI is mediated by RhlR in surface-grown cells. 251 252 Thus, in the absence of LasR, surface-grown cells appear to rely on the activity of the rhl system 253 to control QS-regulated factors, including the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Since the full 254 activity of RhlR depends on both C4-HSL and PqsE (13), we measured the concentration of 3-255 oxo-C12-HSL in the double mutants \u0394lasR \u0394rhlI and lasR \u0394pqsE in order to further elucidate the 256 role of the Rhl system in this mechanism. As expected, inactivating rhlI or pqsE in a lasR 257 background severely affects the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (Fig. 3) and confirm that the 258 production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL by LasR- cells growing on a surface is dependent on the RhlR-259 mediated transcription of lasI. 260 261\nInduction of the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL upon surface growth is a widespread 262 response among P. aeruginosa strains. Conserved regulation pathways strongly suggest the 263 importance of bacterial responses to their fitness (52). We have observed that surface growth 264 induces production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in an engineered lasR deletion mutant of P. aeruginosa 265 PA14. To verify if this response is restricted to this prototypical strain, we measured 266 concentrations of this AHL in six naturally occurring LasR-defective P. aeruginosa isolates: 267 three strains we recently identified among a collection of environmental isolates (32) and the 268 other three are LasR-defective CF clinical isolates (E41, E113 and E167) from the Early 269 Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) study (31, 37). Timing of sampling was chosen based on 270 the 3-oxo-C12-HSL production profile of PA14 \u0394lasR, which peaks at late exponential phase 271 (Fig. 1). Considering that growth curves can differ greatly between P. aeruginosa strains, we 272 decided to also include a 24h time-point. Environmental and clinical LasR-negative strains 273 behave similarly to the engineered PA14 \u0394lasR mutant, with production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL being 274 augmented upon surface growth when compared to planktonic (Fig. 4). The production profile 275 varies among the LasR-negative backgrounds: strain 18G steadily produces 3-oxo-C12-HSL 276 during surface growth. At 24h, there is 6-fold more in surface than in the planktonic growth 277 conditions. The environmental strain 32R and the clinical strain E113 have production profiles 278 similar to PA14 \u0394lasR, and the concentration of 3-oxo-C12-HSL peaks at the late exponential 279 phase (Figs. 4 and S2). Production is advanced (compared with PA14 \u0394lasR) in strains 78RV 280 and E167. In these strains, AHL production peaks at early exponential phase (Figs. 4 and S2). 281 Finally, upregulation of 3-oxo-C12-HSL production upon surface growth was not observed for 282 the clinical strain E41 under our test conditions. Taken together, these results confirm that the 283 absence of a functional LasR generally induces the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in response to 284 growth in association with surfaces, despite the general requirement of LasR to produce this 285 AHL in standard laboratory planktonic culture conditions. 286 287 3-oxo-C12-HSL induces the expression of pyocyanin in the absence of LasR. The 288 conservation of surface-primed induction of 3-oxo-C12-HSL production in LasR-defective 289 isolates strongly suggests that this signaling molecule mediates significant biological responses 290 in this context. Because 3-oxo-C12-HSL is only/essentially known as the autoinducing ligand of 291 LasR, in a LasR-defective background, its production could be considered as a waste of 292 resources. Thus, a plausible explanation for the conservation is that, in the absence of a 293 functional LasR, 3-oxo-C12-HSL remains beneficial when P. aeruginosa is growing on a surface. 294 Pyocyanin production relies on the expression of the redundant operons phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 295 (phz1) and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2 (phz2) \u2013 culminating in the synthesis of phenazine-1-296 carboxylic acid (PCA). PCA is converted to several phenazines, including pyocyanin, the blue 297 pigment characteristic of P. aeruginosa cultures (53). Transcription of the phz1 operon relies on 298 RhlR (13, 54). To verify if 3-oxo-C12-HSL could be implicated in RhlR-dependant QS, we 299 evaluated the level of transcription from the phz1 promoter during surface-growth, using a 300 chromosomal phzA1-lux fusion reporter, in an AHL- and LasR-negative triple mutant 301\n(\u0394lasR\u0394lasI\u0394rhlI). As expected, no transcription is seen in the control condition or when only 3-302 oxo-C12-HSL is provided, and upon addition of exogenous C4-HSL, phz1 transcription is 303 induced, consistent with the requirement of C4-HSL for RhlR activity (Fig. 5A). However, 304 unexpectedly, combined addition of C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL further induces the expression 305 of phz1 (Fig. 5A). The synergetic activation of these signal molecules is also seen for pyocyanin 306 production (Fig 5B). The concomitant addition of C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL induces by 307 almost 3-fold the production of this redox-active molecule compared to the addition of C4-HSL 308 alone. Similar to the observed phz1 expression, 3-oxo-C12-HSL alone is not sufficient to induce 309 pyocyanin production. These results clearly demonstrates that 3-oxo-C12-HSL modulates QS-310 regulated responses even in the absence its cognate response regulator LasR. This activity 311 depends on the presence of C4-HSL, thus likely on the function of RhlR. 312 313 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced by LasR-negative strains positively regulates the LasB virulence 314 determinant in cocultures. AHLs are conserved extracellular intraspecies signaling molecules. 315 Based on this characteristic, we wondered if 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced by LasR-defective isolates 316 could be used by surrounding LasR-active cells to induce LasR-dependent factors. These factors 317 include several exoproducts such as proteases (e.g. LasA and LasB) that can be used by the 318 whole population (\u201cpublic goods\u201d). To verify this, we measured the activity of the chromosomal 319 lasB-lux reporter inserted in \u0394lasI mutant (\u0394lasI::CTX lasB-lux background) in a surface-320 associated coculture with a \u0394lasR mutant. Because the \u0394lasI mutant is unable to produce 3-oxo-321 C12-HSL, the las system cannot be activated in this background; however, this strain is LasR-322 active and prone to induction by exogenous 3-oxo-C12-HSL. As expected, lasB transcription is at 323 basal levels in \u0394lasI mutant monoculture (Fig. 6). Coculture with \u0394lasR, which produces 3-oxo-324 C12-HSL under these surface culture conditions, induces the transcription of the lasB-lux reporter 325 by more than 4-fold at late stationary phase in which the concentration of LasR-inducing 3-oxo-326 C12-HSL is at its peak. This upregulation depends solely on the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL by 327 the \u0394lasR mutant, as it is not seen in cocultures with the double mutant \u0394lasR\u0394lasI. Thus, 3-oxo-328 C12-HSL produced by LasR-negative strains can be used by surrounding LasR-active cells, 329 modulating the expression of the QS-regulated genes at the communal level. 330 331 Virulence of P. aeruginosa is positively modulated by LasR-defective cells in coinfection. 332 Even in absence of a functional LasR or endogenous production of its cognate autoinducer, 333 virulence traits are positively regulated by 3-oxo-C12-HSL at the individual and community 334 levels (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, we postulated that a coinfection with a mixture of LasR-responsive 335 and LasR-defective strains would be more virulent than a separate infection with the respective 336 strains. To test this, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an infection host \u2013 in 337 which P. aeruginosa cause a disease and mortality (51). We fed fruit flies with P. aeruginosa 338 cells and monitored survival of the flies for 8 days post-infection. Feeding assay mimics a 339 chronic infection (55). Virulence of WT PA14 (LasR-active) and \u0394lasR mutant (LasR-defective) 340 were tested, as well as a coinfection with a 7:3 ratio of each, respectively (Figs. 7 and S3). To 341\naddress the role of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in this response, we also assessed the virulence of the double 342 mutant \u0394lasR\u0394lasI in individual and coinfection settings (Figs. 7 and S3). Under our conditions, 343 fly death was accelerated at the beginning by coinfection of PA14 and \u0394lasR, while overall 344 survival was similar between the later and WT PA14. However, virulence of the coinfection 345 PA14 and \u0394lasR\u0394lasI was severely attenuated, indicating that 3-oxo-C12-HSL modulates 346 virulence in coinfection settings. 347 348\nDISCUSSION 349 The characteristics and behaviors displayed by bacteria within biofilms have been extensively 350 investigated over the years. These surface-associated communities exhibit features that clearly 351 distinguish them from the free-living counterpart. This is due to a sequential and highly regulated 352 process that mediate the transition from planktonic to sessile lifestyle (56). Although QS 353 regulates social behaviors, often also modulated by aspects related to the sessile way of life, it 354 has been essentially characterized genetically and biochemically in cells grown in broth. In the 355 present study, we show that surface-association is sufficient to induce the LasR-independent 356 expression of lasI in P. aeruginosa and that 3-oxo-C12-HSL modulates the expression of 357 virulence determinants even in the absence of the cognate transcriptional regulator LasR. 358 359 Surface-sensing has been previously linked to differential bacterial responses. For instance, we 360 have shown that regulation of the small RNAs RsmY/RsmZ is modulated differently in broth 361 versus surface-grown cells, probably aiding bacterial adaptation to growth conditions (57). 362 Similarly, expression of lasR increases in a surface-dependent manner, culminating in a surface-363 primed QS activation, due to the sensitization of surface-grown cells to the cognate AHL 3-oxo-364 C12-HSL (39). Therefore, QS of P. aeruginosa responds differently to the same concentration of 365 3-oxo-C12-HSL: weaker QS activation is seen in planktonic cultures, in contrast to high QS 366 activation in surface-associated cells. This mechanism is reported to rely on type IV (TFP) pili 367 retraction, as surface-primed lasR upregulation is lost in the absence of the motors PilT and PilU 368 (39). Thus, a relationship between QS and surface sensing is established but its complexity 369 remains to be clearly defined. 370 371 LasR-defective P. aeruginosa isolates have been generally related to human chronic infections, 372 in which this bacterium persists in the lungs of people with CF as a biofilm. Recently, the 373 general high occurrence of such isolates challenged this long-held notion (32, 33). Loss of LasR 374 function appears to be a widespread adaptation feature of this bacterium (32). Our results support 375 a model in which surface attachment, a growth condition often encountered by P. aeruginosa, 376 induces RhlR-dependent production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in LasR-defective background \u2013 377 sustaining QS-responsiveness in this condition. Why is RhlR-dependent expression of LasI 378 observed in a LasR-deficient background more prominent in sessile cells? Compared to 379 planktonic growth, both sessile LasR-active and LasR-defective cells produce more C4-HSL 380 (Fig. S4), which could lead to a stronger activation of the rhl system, culminating in the 381\nupregulation of RhlR-dependent factors. However, the RhlR-dependent 3-oxo-C12-HSL 382 overproduction in sessile cells is seen only in LasR-defective backgrounds. 383 384 Irrespective of the mechanism, the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL appears to have important 385 biological implications. As mentioned before, surface-association upregulates LasR, thus 386 sensitizing cells to 3-oxo-C12-HSL (39). Upregulation of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in LasR-defective 387 background does not appear dependent on this mechanism, as the TFP retraction motors PilT and 388 PilU are not required for this response (Fig. S5). 389 390 The conservation of surface-primed induction of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in naturally occurring LasR-391 defective isolates of P. aeruginosa is an indicator of its importance. We observed this response 392 in naturally-evolved LasR-defective isolates from both clinical and environmental origins (32, 393 43). The environmental isolates used here, namely 18G, 32R and 78RV were recently 394 characterized as LasR-defective strains based on their inability to perform LasR-dependent 395 activities in liquid cultures (32). Of note, due to the ability to mediate RhlR-regulated QS, LasR-396 defective 78RV was characterized as a RAIL strain (32), like the CF isolates E113 and E167, 397 which also have functional RhlR-dependent QS responses (37). In the absence of a functional 398 LasR, surface-association induces the production of the 3-oxo-C12-HSL signal irrespective of the 399 QS-responsiveness mediated by LasR-independent RhlR. This response is prevalent, but not 400 universal. Isolate E41 produces trace concentrations of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and its production was 401 not induced by surface-association when compared with planktonic cells. Response variability is 402 not surprising considering the diversity of P. aeruginosa isolates, but our results highlight that 403 LasR-deficient P. aeruginosa isolated from both clinical and environmental settings are often 404 proficient in the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL when adopting an attached growth mode. Thus, 405 this ability appears to be an intrinsic and beneficial feature of this species. 406 407 Mutations in the cognate synthase gene, lasI, are much less frequently detected than those found 408 in the lasR gene (33). The most accepted explanation for this discrepancy is social cheating. 409 Cheaters are individuals that benefit of a shared beneficial product or function (\u201cpublic good\u201d) 410 while contributing less than average to the metabolic cost. Inactivation of LasI would not prevent 411 response to 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced by neighboring WT cells and thus activate a functional 412 LasR. LasR-defective isolates emerge even in experimental conditions that do not apparently 413 require QS-induced products (and thus cheating) (58). An alternative explanation for a lower 414 frequency of lasI-null isolates is that 3-oxo-C12-HSL might contribute an alternative function 415 beyond LasR activation. This interpretation is supported by our results, where LasR-defective 416 strains retain the ability to respond to the presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Indeed, expression of 417 phz1, a QS-regulated operon required for pyocyanin production, is controlled by RhlR and its 418 cognate ligand C4-HSL. Concomitant addition of 3-oxo-C12-HSL further induces phz1 419 transcription, and positively regulates pyocyanin production suggesting a response to this non-420 cognate AHL (Fig. 5). The induction of RhlR-controlled phz1 expression by 3-oxo-C12-HSL is 421\nalso seen in the double mutant \u0394lasR\u0394lasI (Fig. S6). Basal expression of phz1 is due to the self-422 produced C4-HSL. Addition of 3-oxo-C12-HSL further enhances phz1 transcription activity and 423 the highest expression is seen when C4-HSL is added with 3-oxo-C12-HSL. The RhlR-dependent 424 response to the non-cognate signal 3-oxo-C12-HSL remains to be understood, but further 425 supports the importance of maintaining LasI activity in the absence of LasR. 426 427 Producing 3-oxo-C12-HSL in the absence of LasR can also have a positive community outcome. 428 Because it is exported, we have shown that this AHL can have exogenous effects in surrounding 429 cells in a surface-associated setting. Thus, localized production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL by LasR-430 negative clusters could induce the expression of QS-regulated virulence factors in LasR-active 431 cells, with minimal metabolic cost to the LasR-negative producers. Moreover, the production 432 profile is delayed in LasR-defective strains when compared to the WT. Therefore, the mixed 433 population composed of both LasR-active and LasR-defective cells would be subjected to steady 434 levels of 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Furthermore, in natural habitats, P. aeruginosa is part of complex 435 polymicrobial communities. Microbes within these communities can actively respond to one 436 another, and these interactions range from cooperation to competition (59). Steady production of 437 3-oxo-C12-HSL by P. aeruginosa might be relevant in shaping the biological activities of the 438 population. Accordingly, LuxR homologues BtaR1 and BtaR2 \u2013 from Burkholderia 439 thailandensis \u2013 are promiscuous and prone to activation by 3-oxo-C12-HSL (60). Importantly, P. 440 aeruginosa and B. thailandensis are soil saprophytes and thus, may occupy the same 441 environmental niches (61). The ecological relevance of sensing signals produced by 442 neighbouring cells is seen by the conservation of an orphan LuxR homologue (SdiA) in 443 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a bacterium unable to produce AHLs (62). This 444 ability to \u201ceavesdrop\u201d the environment, by sensing AHL produced by other bacteria is likely not 445 unique in this bacterium and might modulate interspecies interactions and justify the benefit of 446 sustained production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in P. aeruginosa. This idea is further supported by the 447 marine sponge symbiont Ruegeria sp, a bacterium with a solo LuxI homologue, thus unable to 448 utilize this molecule in a traditional QS-regulated pathway (63). 449 450 QS signals also play a pivotal role in host-pathogen interactions. QS-regulated molecules can act 451 as interkingdom QS signals, thus responsible for the communication of bacteria with mammalian 452 cells and the modulation of host immune systems. Indeed, this was reported for 3-oxo-C12-HSL 453 (recently reviewed by (64)). Due to the long acyl chain of this autoinducer, the molecule has 454 lipophilic properties and, by directly interacting with biological membranes, can enter 455 mammalian cells and directly interact with intracellular molecules (65). Presence of 3-oxo-C12-456 HSL induces apoptosis of haematopoietic cells and cytotoxicity of non-haematopoietic cells, 457 including those of the airway epithelium (66-70). The host immune responses are also 458 suppressed by 3-oxo-C12-HSL, negatively impacting cytokines production, T cell differentiation 459 as well as the function of antigen-presenting cells (71-73). Thus, this signal molecule is central to 460 virulence and pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa and the sustained production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL by 461\nbiofilm-growing LasR-deficient isolates in infected hosts might account for worse clinical 462 outcomes. In infected hosts, could the immunomodulatory activity of 3-oxo-C12-HSL, rather than 463 its role as quorum sensing signal, justify the regulatory by-pass in the absence of LasR? 464 465 Sustained production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL in the absence of LasR in response to surface growth, 466 the most common lifestyle adopted by P. aeruginosa in its natural environments, appears to be 467 beneficial to the colonization of many environmental niches. Combined with the widespread 468 feature underlying the emergence of LasR-defective isolates, it raises an important question: do 469 these isolates emerge solely to benefit from the cooperating individuals or could they play a 470 positive role in shaping the bacterial community responses? 471 472 473 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 474 We thank George A.
