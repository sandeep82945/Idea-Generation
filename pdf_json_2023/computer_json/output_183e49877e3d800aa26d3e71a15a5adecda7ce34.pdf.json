Identification of peripheral diagnostic biomarkers is an effective approach to improving diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this study, four datasets of schizophrenia patients\u2019 blood or serum samples were downloaded from the GEO database and merged and de-batched for the analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WCGNA). The WGCNA analysis showed that the cyan module, among 9 modules, was significantly related to schizophrenia, which subsequently yielded 317 schizophrenia-related key genes by comparing with the DEGs. The enrichment analyses on these key genes indicated a strong correlation with immune-related processes. The CIBERSORT algorithm was adopted to analyze immune cell infiltration, which revealed differences in eosinophils, M0 macrophages, resting mast cells, and gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, by comparing with the immune genes obtained from online databases, 95 immune-related key genes for schizophrenia were screened out. Moreover, machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, LASSO, and SVM-RFE were used to further screen immune-related hub genes of schizophrenia. Finally, CLIC3 was found as an immune-related hub gene of schizophrenia by the three machine learning algorithms. A schizophrenia rat model was established to validate CLIC3 expression and found that CLIC3 levels were reduced in the model rat plasma and brains in a brain-regional dependent manner, but can be\u00a0reversed by an antipsychotic drug risperidone. In conclusion, using various bioinformatic and biological methods, this study found an immunerelated hub gene of schizophrenia \u2013 CLIC3 that might be\u00a0a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for schizophrenia.\nKEYWORDS\nschizophrenia, peripheral immune-related biomarkers, CLIC3, WGCNA, CIBERSORT, LASSO, random forest, support vector machine"

            "text": "Schizophrenia is considered to be\u00a0one of the most serious mental illnesses, affecting approximately 1% general population (McCutcheon et\u00a0 al., 2020). However, to date, the pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of schizophrenia still remain ambiguous. Early identification and diagnosis are likely to result in significant benefits for individuals with schizophrenia and the society (Gaebel and Zielasek, 2015). Therefore, identifying promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of schizophrenia is one of the focuses in future schizophrenia research.\nAlthough the occurrence and development of schizophrenia is mainly located at the central nervous system (CNS), gene expression and metabolism in the peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients may also be\u00a0 affected through a wide range of cytokines, neurotransmitters, or hormones; in addition, the strong heritability of schizophrenia indicates the possible presence of detectable genetic biomarkers in peripheral blood (Kurian et\u00a0 al., 2011). Therefore, identifying genetic biomarkers in peripheral blood become a highly viable option in improving the diagnosis of schizophrenia.\nThere is growing evidence suggesting that the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may be\u00a0 related to a range of dysfunctional immune processes in the CNS and peripheral tissues (Khandaker et\u00a0 al., 2015). It was reported that indirect signs of immune dysregulation were presented in the CNS at the early stages of schizophrenia (Gangadin et\u00a0al., 2019); hence, in the post-mortem brain samples of schizophrenia patients, biomarkers of neuroinflammation were detected (Trepanier et\u00a0 al., 2016). In addition, levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, such as cytokines, were shown to be\u00a0elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients (Muller, 2018). Furthermore, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines were revealed to be\u00a0associated with monocytes and macrophages in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (Goldsmith et\u00a0 al., 2016). More importantly, those immunerelated changes in the CNS may originate from peripheral blood (Muller, 2018). Thus, identification of immune-related biomarkers in peripheral blood is of great significance for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a01, in the present study, four datasets of schizophrenia peripheral blood gene expression (GSE18312, GSE27383, GSE165604, and GSE38484) were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and combined into one dataset. A differentially-expressed gene (DEG) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed with the combined dataset to screen key genes for schizophrenia, while an immune infiltration analysis was conducted to reveal significantly changed immune cell types using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Then, by comparing the key genes with the immune gene set from online databases, immune-related key genes for schizophrenia were obtained. Next, based on these immune-related key genes, three machine-learning algorithms were employed to identify hub gene (s) of schizophrenia, followed by in vivo validation of the hub gene (s). Overall, the present study might provide potential diagnostic biomarker (s) and therapeutic tactic (s) for schizophrenia."

The innate immune system dataset was downloaded from PathCards of GeneCardsSuite4 after being retrieved by the keyword \u201cimmune.\u201d The last gene set was obtained from the online database ImmPort.5\nThe machine-learning algorithms were performed in R. Hub genes were screened using three machine learning algorithms including Random Forest algorithm (Izmirlian, 2004), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm (Tibshirani, 1997), and support vector machines\u00a0- recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm (Guyon et\u00a0al., 2002). Random Forest algorithm was implemented using the R package randomForest (Version 4.7\u20131.1) (Breiman, 2001). The threshold for candidate hub genes was determined by the lowest point of the tenfold cross-validation error curve. The intersections of the genes with top-ranked mean decrease accuracy and those with top-ranked mean decrease Gini were considered as candidate genes. The R package glmnet (Version 4.1\u20137) was applied to implement the LASSO algorithm (Friedman et\u00a0al., 2010; Simon et\u00a0al., 2013). Candidate genes were selected by performing a tenfold cross-validation to adjust the optimal penalty parameter. Furthermore, the SVM-RFE approach was implemented using the R package e1071 (Version 1.7\u201313).6 The parameters of the algorithm were set as follows: cost = 10, cachesize = 500, scale = F, type = \u201cC-classificatio,\u201d kernel = \u201clinear.\u201d The point of the lowest tenfold cross-validation error was selected as the threshold for candidate genes. Finally, the intersection gene(s) of the above three groups of candidate genes were selected as final hub gene(s).\nThe potential of the expression levels of the hub genes to differentiate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls was determined by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. The area under curve (AUC) indicates the accuracy with which a particular hub gene can differentiate schizophrenia patients and controls. AUC values above 50% suggest that a hub gene can possibly differentiate between schizophrenia patients and controls and an AUC value of 100% indicates that it can perfectly differentiate between schizophrenia subjects and controls.\n3 https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/\n4 https://pathcards.genecards.org/\n5 https://www.immport.org/\n6 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=e1071"

After 1-week acclimatization, the rats were randomly assigned into three groups (6 rats per group) and drug administration began. The experimental procedures of the present study were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Yangzhou University Medical College (Ethics No.: YXYLL-2020-53).\nMK-801 is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist and commonly-used to establish NMDAR hypofunction models that mimic schizophrenia (Bia\u0142o\u0144 and W\u0105sik, 2022). The drug administration was performed as described previously (Pan et\u00a0al., 2022a,b, 2023a,b). Briefly, the rats except the controls received daily intraperitoneal injections of MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg/day, #M107, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM for 2 weeks, while the control group were intraperitoneally injected saline (0.9%) for comparison. In our previous study, this modeling method induced schizophrenia-like abnormalities in male SD rats (Pan et\u00a0al., 2022b). After the 2-week modeling, the risperidone group were orally administrated with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg/day, Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd., Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China) three times a day (07:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 11:00 PM) for another 2 weeks. Risperidone was orally delivered by mixing risperidone powder with a 0.2 g cookie dough pellet (containing corn flour, sugar, and milk powder). The other two groups were administrated with equivalent cookie dough pellets without risperidone. Two hours after the last administration, the rats were sacrificed and their blood and brains were collected and frozen for the subsequent biological experiments.\nPrefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hippocampus (HIP) are the brain regions that were reported to be\u00a0 closely associated with schizophrenia (Heckers, 2004; Bois et\u00a0al., 2015; Mueller et\u00a0al., 2015; Brady et\u00a0al., 2019).

Specifically, the repeated MK-801 administration significantly reduced the protein levels of CLIC3\u00a0 in PFC (ANOVA: F2,15 = 5.84, p < 0.05; post hoc: \u201328.4%, p < 0.05 vs. the control group) and CPu of the model rats (ANOVA: F2,15 = 4.56, p < 0.05; post hoc: \u201330.8%, p < 0.05 vs. the control group) (Figures\u00a08C,D). On the other hand, in the NAc and HIP, the expression of CLIC3 was not significantly altered by the MK-801 administration (both p > 0.05) (Figures\u00a08E,F). It should also be\u00a0noted that the antipsychotic drug\u00a0- risperidone also eliminated the inhibitory effects of MK-801 on CLIC3 expression in both PFC and CPu (both p <\u00a00.05 vs. the MK-801 group) (Figures\u00a08A,B), indicating that CLIC3 might be\u00a0a potential therapeutic target of schizophrenia."

Due to the poor understanding on the molecular basis of schizophrenia, exploration and identification of peripheral genetic markers in blood is imperative, which will greatly benefit the clinical diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia. The present study analyzed four datasets of schizophrenia peripheral blood gene expression (GSE18312, GSE27383, GSE165604, and GSE38484). By using the WGCNA and DEG analyses and the KEGG and GO enrichment analyses, 317 DEGs were identified and also found to be\u00a0related with immune processes. Subsequently, an immune infiltration analysis was performed using the CIBERSORT algorithm and revealed that 4 types of immune cells (eosinophils, M0 macrophages, resting mast cells, and gamma delta T cells) dramatically differed between the schizophrenia subjects and healthy controls. Moreover, three machine-learning algorithms including Random Forest, LASSO, and SVM-RFE were employed to further screen hub gene(s) from these 317 genes. Finally, 1 immune-related hub gene of schizophrenia\u00a0- CLIC3 was identified, followed by the protein-level validations of CLIC3\u00a0 in the brain of schizophrenia model rats. To our best knowledge, the present study is the first study that revealed the relationship between CLIC3 and schizophrenia.\nIn the present study, we\u00a0first identified 317 differentially-expressed key genes associated with schizophrenia using the WGCNA and DEG analyses. The subsequent KEGG and GO enrichment analyses pointed out that these 317 key genes were mainly related to immune processes, such as, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, cell activation involved in immune response, neutrophil activation involved\nin immune response, neutrophil mediated immunity. Since the samples examined in this study were blood lymphocytes or PBMC, these enrichment results were consistent with our speculation. It has been well-documented that immunity and inflammation are closely associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Khandaker et\u00a0al., 2015). These findings confirmed that abnormal alteration in the immune system is strongly associated with schizophrenia and also indicated that the peripheral immune system is very likely to be\u00a0a diagnostic indicator and therapeutic target for schizophrenia. Therefore, further research focusing on the peripheral immune system is going to be\u00a0of great importance in the diagnosis and therapeutics of schizophrenia. However, it is also worth noting that the other molecular pathway revealed by the enrichment analyses such as \u2018Sphingolipid signaling pathway,\u2019 \u2018Mitophagy,\u2019 \u2018Oxidative phosphorylation,\u2019 \u2018Apoptosis,\u2019 and \u2018COVID-19\u2019 cannot be\u00a0neglected and in-depth investigations on these pathways in schizophrenia are also required in the future.\nCIBERSORT is a de-convolution machine learning algorithm used to estimate the proportion of 22 types of immune cells on the basis of gene expression. Since the 317 schizophrenia-associated key genes were related to various immune processes, the CIBERSORT algorithm were employed to identify related immune cell types. The data revealed that among the 22 immune cell types, 4 types of immune cells, including eosinophils, gamma delta T cell, M0 macrophages, and resting mast cells, were revealed to be\u00a0 significantly different in schizophrenia. Under inflammatory conditions, eosinophils were involved in immune regulation in neurons mainly through migrating to inflammatory sites and acting with various cytokines (Rothenberg and Hogan, 2006; Wechsler et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, gamma delta T\nFIGURE\u00a06 Immune cell infiltration analysis. (A) Relative percentage of 22 groups of immune cells in each sample.

Macrophages play a major role in innate immunity in the brain (Monji et\u00a0al., 2013) and macrophage CD163 mRNA levels were found to be\u00a0 increased in schizophrenia patients, particularly in the high inflammation schizophrenia subgroup (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022). Lastly, mast cells were found in various brain regions, interacting with neurons, glia, blood vessels, and other hematopoietic cells (Dimitriadou et\u00a0al., 1990; Manning et\u00a0al., 1994; Silver and Curley, 2013). Up-regulation of mast cells induced by inflammation can lead to cognitive, sociobehavioral abnormalities and anxiety-like behavior (Nautiyal et\u00a0al., 2008; Skaper et\u00a0al., 2014; Breach et\u00a0al., 2021). These findings suggest that these types of immune cells are very likely to be\u00a0associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrneia and could be\u00a0used as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets of schizophrenia in the future.\nAlthough 317 schizophrenia-associated key genes were identified in the first section of this study, it is unfortunately almost impossible to use all of them to diagnosis schizophrenia or develop new drugs. It is necessary to investigate their importance or correlations with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and then screen out one or several most important gene(s) for schizophrenia. Machine learning techniques have emerged from Artificial Intelligence (AI), which primarily sought to determine pattern recognition. Applications of machine learning in translational medicine include the development of novel drugs and treatments, diagnostic development, surgical planning, outcome prediction, and intraoperative assistance. At present, machine learning has become one of the most important methods for identifying critical genes, which can facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets and/ or diagnostic biomarkers; at the same time, machine learning is considered as one of the major supplementary approaches to reduce the resources required for necessity measurement (Aromolaran et\u00a0al., 2021). In the field of psychiatry, machine learning has been widely used for modeling and therapeutic discovery of various neuropsychiatric diseases, inducing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression disorders, etc (Tai et\u00a0al., 2019). In the present study,\nthree machine-learning algorithms were adopted to screen hub gene(s), including Random Forest, LASSO, and SVM-RFE. These three machine-learning algorithms are able to screen out and rank the genes that are very likely to be\u00a0associated with schizophrenia based on the current data. Since these three machine-learning algorithms have their own intrinsic advantages and shortcomings, using only one algorithm would bring unpredictably biased screening results. Therefore, to avoid such biases, the shared gene(s) of the results of these three machinelearning algorithms were considered as hub gene(s) in the current study. As the results showed, only one gene was screened out by the three machine-learning algorithms, namely CLIC3.\nCLIC3 has been found to be\u00a0expressed in human placenta and fetal membranes (Money et\u00a0al., 2007), osteoblasts (Brum et\u00a0al., 2017), and various cancer cells (Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Chen et\u00a0al., 2020; Kawai et\u00a0al., 2020). Its rich expression promotes immune evasion in cancer cells (Vlachostergios et\u00a0 al., 2022). Addtionally, it was reported that in hepatitis B virus, CLIC3 promotes classical macrophage activation via the NF-\u03baB pathway (Liang et\u00a0al., 2022). Unfortunately, the exact role of CLIC3\u00a0 in schizophrenia is not clear based on existing literature. Therefore, we\u00a0established a schizophrenia animal model and examined the protein expression of CLIC3\u00a0in the plasma and brain. The results demonstrated the CLIC3 expression was decreased in the plasma and the PFC and CPu of the brains. These findings indicate that altered CLIC3 expression is very likely to be\u00a0associated with schizophrenia and could be\u00a0a potential biomarker of schizophrneia. However, in-depth investigations, especially the examination of CLIC3 expression in schizophrenia patients, are still required to further verify the role of CLIC3\u00a0 in schizophrenia. Futhermore, since schizophrenic patients always experience a long history of various medications, it is possible that the alterations in the CLIC3 protein expression may not be\u00a0observed in patients due to feedback regulation of the body. Therefore, CLIC3 expression in clinical samples such as post-mortem brain, peripheral blood, or cerebrospinal fluid, is required to be\u00a0investigated in the future. On the other hand, employing a long-term schizophrenia animal model might also be\u00a0an effective approach to examine the changes of CLIC3\u00a0in schizophrenia and validate our current findings.\nIn the present study, we\u00a0 found that risperidone was able to reverse the altered expression of CLIC3\u00a0in the plasma and brains of the schizophrenia model rats, suggesting that regulating CLIC3 expression might be\u00a0a potential approach to treating schizophrenia and CLIC3 is a possible therapeutic target of risperidone. Nevertheless, it should be\u00a0 noted that although risperidone is a common-used antipsychtic drug, there are many other antipsychotic drugs in the market, such as haloperidol, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, etc. These drugs possess different pharmacological mechanisms and are suitable for different clinical manifestations. Therefore, the effects of other antipsychotic drugs on CLIC3 are also required to be\u00a0 examined in the future. In addition, besides schizophrenia, risperidone is also used to treat symptoms of bipolar disorder and symptoms of irritability in autistic children (Chopko and Lindsley, 2018). Thus, whether CLIC3 is also a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in bipolar disorder and autism is also a topic worth further exploring.\nIt is also worth noting that the current study used MK-801 to establish a NMDAR hyperfunction animal model, thus whether abnormal CLIC3 expression is associated with NMDAR dysfunction requires to be\u00a0verified in future studies. Moreover, risperidone was widely reported to have positive effects on\nTABLE\u00a02 Candidate hub genes for schizophrenia screened out by the random forest, LASSO, and SVM-RFE algorithms.\nRandom forest LASSO SVM-RFE\nTLR10, S100A8, ITGAL,\nFBXO4, RPLP0, CKLF,\nMS4A6A, ACTN4, GDI2,\nCLIC3, ARG1, PLXNA3,\nCD48, GENE, HPSE,\nTPM2, GMFB, TFRC,\nLY96, SAMSN1, CD3E,\nTPT1, RASGRP3,\nANXA1, SPTAN1,\nPTGDS\nS100A8, SPTAN1,\nTLR10, ARG1, CLIC3,\nSAMSN1, CD3E,\nRPLP0, CREG1, TFRC,"

Therefore, whether risperidone regulates the immune system through modulating CLIC3 expression is worth being explored in the future. It should be\u00a0also noted that in the NAc and HIP, the CLIC3 expression was not significantly modulated, indicating that the alterations of CLIC3 expression are probably dependent on brain regions. Nevertheless, the exact relationship between CLIC3 expression and schizophrenia-related brain regions cannot be\u00a0elucidated by the present data.\nIn conclusion, the current study identified 1 immune-related hub gene\u00a0- CLIC3 and 4 peripheral immune cells (eosinophils, M0 macrophages, resting mast cells, and gamma delta T cells), which might be\u00a0closely related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In particular, CLIC3 has potential to be\u00a0a promising biomarker or therapeutic target of schizophrenia. These findings together provide new insights for the diagnosis and therapeutics of schizophrenia."
