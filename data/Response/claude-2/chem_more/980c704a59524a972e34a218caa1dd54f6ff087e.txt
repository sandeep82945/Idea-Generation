 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on targeting Hsp90 for glioblastoma and neurodegeneration:

1. Conduct preclinical studies on combination therapy of Hsp90 inhibitors with standard treatments like temozolomide or radiation for glioblastoma. Assess efficacy and toxicity profiles.

2. Explore the use of natural products that target Hsp90, like gedunin, celastrol, or flavonoids, as leads for new Hsp90 inhibitor drug development for glioblastoma and neurodegeneration.

3. Investigate the optimal dosing and administration schedules of existing synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing toxicity for glioblastoma and neurodegenerative diseases. 

4. Evaluate the ability of Hsp90 inhibitors to cross the blood-brain barrier and their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in brain tumor and neurodegeneration models. 

5. Examine the mechanisms by which Hsp90 inhibitors provide neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease models, such as by reducing protein aggregation or modulating signaling pathways.
