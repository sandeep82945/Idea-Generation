First synthesised in 1992 by Stalke from Cs metal and free amine,2 CsHMDS [CsN(SiMe3)2] has been the one Cs amide of note albeit featuring in only a handful of applications, though recent studies hint at a more promising future.3\u20136 These include as a catalyst for selective hydrogen isotope exchange of benzylic C\u2013H bonds with D2;\n3 as a precatalyst for imine to amine transfer hydrogenation,4a and as a mediator in magnesiate-catalysed transfer hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.4b Also reported are indirect applications where CsHMDS was either not added directly but suspected of forming in situ, as in catalytic alkynylations of polyfluoroarenes,5 and in alkaline-metal-catalysed aminobenzylation of aldehydes with toluenes.6 Since HMDS is a common Br\u00f8nsted base anion1a,7 one might intuitively expect CsHMDS to be a strong stoichiometric base, but though used to deprotonate indene and fluorene,8 its reactivity with organic substrates has\nnot yet been studied in any detail. While organocaesium Br\u00f8nsted bases are rare, inorganic bases such as CsOH and Cs2CO3 have made a significant impact in organic synthesis with acidic substrates, such that a \u2018\u2018caesium effect\u2019\u2019 has been postulated, derived from observations that these salts and their derivatives sometimes outperform smaller alkali metal congeners in assorted organic transformations. However, this is not a unified effect since it is cited in different contexts and the origin/s of this superior performance remain uncertain.9 To gain insight into their chemistry, here we report benchmarking studies of RbHMDS and CsHMDS with the common carbonyls benzaldehyde and acetophenone, focusing on their reactivity, but tracking the remarkable structural outcomes of isolable metal products. Such structures are exceptionally rare, though a variety of crystallographically characterised monometallic and heterobimetallic CsHMDS complexes are known (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI\u2020).2,10\na Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow,\nG1 1XL, UK.

Commun., 2024, 60, 91\u201394 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024\nCsHMDS was mixed with acetophenone in a 1 : 1 ratio in benzene (Scheme 1), to form a white suspension. 1H NMR analysis of the isolated solid in THF-d8 revealed two multiplet resonances in the olefinic region at 3.28 and 3.90 ppm and aromatic signals in the range 7.02 to 7.68 ppm indicated formation of a metalenolate species (see ESI,\u2021 pg. 6). The 13C NMR shift ofQCH2 at 72.3 ppm compares to that of potassium enolate [{KOC (Mes)QCH2 toluene}4] (74.6 ppm, Mes = mesityl).11 The compound\u2019s identity was confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study on crystals grown from a THF/hexane mixture at 20 1C. Enolate [CsOC(Ph)QCH2]N (1-Cs) was revealed having a remarkable infinite non-covalent network with ionic Cs\u2013O bonds in a Pbca space group (Fig. 2). Two asymmetric Cs-enolate bridges form a four-atom ring (grey shaded) with Cs and O atoms occupying opposite corners. The edges [2.9319(1) \u00c5 and 2.9631(6) \u00c5] and bond angles [91.1(2)1 at O and 88.8(7)1 at Cs] described by this\nCs2O2 plane are close to that of a perfect square. These square planes stack in parallel in an alternating staggered arrangement. Four such planes from three adjacent stacks assemble together generating a distorted hexagonal prism with two parallel planes from the middle stack sharing their faces and two adjacent ones sharing one edge. These hexagonal prisms fuse together via all their quadrilateral faces in an infinite non-covalent network. Each Cs interacts with two other enolate O atoms [e.g., Cs1\u2013O1B, 2.9582(1) \u00c5; Cs1\u2013O1C 4.2610(8) \u00c5], respectively shorter and longer than the sum of the ionic radii of [Cs (1.67 \u00c5) and O (1.35 \u00c5)],12 of two adjacently stacked shaded square planes. The difference in contact lengths is the result of the shaded planes tilted at 27.0(9)1 with respect to an adjacent stack. Each enolate ion engages with five Cs atoms (Fig. 2 \u2013 bottom) with O and benzylic C atoms (e.g., O1 and C1) bound to three centres (Cs1, Cs1A, Cs1D); whereas terminal C2 of the enolate interacts with two Cs atoms (Cs1E, Cs1F). The C1\u2013C2 length [1.376(11) \u00c5] indicates a CQC double bond fitting the description of an enolate (see Table S1 for selected bond angles, ESI\u2020). Note that this hexagonal grid network is preferred over face-on cation\u2013p interactions between Cs and the Ph p-surface, a common feature in heavy alkali metal compounds having aryl rings.13 Instead Cs interacts side-on to the p-electron cloud of the ring (Cs1 C8) in 1-Cs.\nWhile alkali metal amides, alkoxides, and enolates are known to exhibit ladder-like, cubic, or hexagonal prism motifs derived from folding of four-rung ladders,1c,d,14 to our knowledge, the special architecture of 1-Cs is the first such example of a Csorganoelement compound manifested in a near hexagonal prism. Isolation of 1-Cs therefore confirms the Br\u00f8nsted basicity of CsHMDS for deprotonation of an enolizable ketone.\nMimicking the above experiment with RbHMDS led to isolation of a highly reactive set of crystals (coated in oil) which decomposed during the XRD operation. After failed attempts to obtain a clean NMR spectrum of the product, the reaction solvent was altered to more polar THF. This reaction mixture gave a white suspension that gradually converted into a dark yellow solution, which gave X-ray quality crystals at 20 1C, albeit in poor yield. Surprisingly, the structure determined (space group: C2/c) was the C\u2013C coupled product [{RbOC(Ph)QC(H)C(Ph)QCH2}3 (THF)2]N (2-Rb), presumably formed by a base mediated self-aldol-type reaction (Scheme S1, p12, ESI\u2020). 2-Rb is composed of partly solvated trinuclear asymmetric units (with disordered THF ligands) with Rb\u2013O interactions resembling a skewed three-rung (Rb3O3) ladder (Fig. 3). Alternating short and long C\u2013C bonds indicate a dienolate intermediate (see Table S2, ESI\u2020). The planes defined by Rb2O2 units lie at an angle of 14.5(2)1 with respect to their plane normal. Two of the three Rb atoms (Rb2 and Rb3) in the asymmetric unit in one disordered model are solvated by THF, whereas THF-free Rb1 has the shortest Rb1\u2013O1 bond distance of 2.685(3) \u00c5 [cf., Rb2\u2013O2, 2.770(4) \u00c5; Rb3\u2013O3, 2.797(3) \u00c5] due to the lower coordination. The trinuclear fused ladder propagates linearly in a slipped manner via interactions with Rb and the adjacent diene unit to form an infinite chain. The four sp2 hybridized C atoms sandwich between two Rb cations or vice versa and lie in the range 3.131(6)\u20133.770(6) \u00c5 from Rb. Reaction of RbHMDS and acetophenone in 1 : 2 ratio in THF-d8 reveals the appearance of a singlet CH resonance at 5.25 ppm of 2-Rb\nScheme 1 Reactions of RbHMDS and CsHMDS with acetophenone and benzaldehyde in this work.\nFig. 2 (top left) Section of the infinite network structure of [CsOC(Ph)QCH2]N (1-Cs); (top right); section displaying the fused distorted hexagonal Cs\u2013O prisms.

Corresponding 13C NMR signals appear at 90.8 ppm (for CH) and 99.5 ppm (for CH2). Unreacted CsHMDS, acetophenone and free HMDS(H) signals can also be seen in the spectrum.\nInspired by this unexpected result, reaction of CsHMDS and acetophenone was repeated in THF to yield a similar laddershaped dienolate [CsOC(Ph)QC(H)C(Ph)QCH2 THF]N (2-Cs), as confirmed by its XRD analysis (P%1 space group, Fig. 4). The structure of 2-Cs bears resemblance to that of 2-Rb as the asymmetric units [{CsOC(Ph)QC(H)C(Ph)QCH2 THF}6 THF] propagate linearly into an infinite four-rung ladder of Cs2O2 rings. Rungs and edges have a mean bond length of 2.899 \u00c5 and 3.209 \u00c5, respectively. The diene p-electrons interact with Cs akin to that in 2-Rb. 1H NMR spectrum of the crystals in THF-d8 confirmed the identity of 2-Cs in solution through a singlet CH resonance at\n5.36 ppm and doublets at 6.35 (J = 3.92 Hz) and 4.72 ppm ( J = 3.20 Hz) for the terminal CH2 atoms with aromatic signals in the range of 7.79\u20137.06 ppm (see ESI,\u2021 p. 16). Heating the CsHMDS and acetophenone mixture in THF-d8 to 50 1C also gave 2-Cs as evidenced by a 1H NMR spectrum (see ESI,\u2021 p. 8).\nReports of alkali-metal dienolate structures are extraordinarily rare15 with the one exception of Seebach\u2019s N,N0-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU)-solvated lithium dienolate of pinacolone, made via the aldol condensation product of two pinacolones. It was postulated that aldol addition occurred while making the pinacolonenolate and after a reaction sequence of water splitting to enone and deprotonation to the dienolate, the final product [(DMPU)LiOC(H)(tBu)QC(H)C(tBu)QCH2]2 was isolated.\n15a Since a small amount of final product was isolated, this could imply a similar pathway in forming 2-Rb/Cs.\nTo test the reactivity of RbHMDS and CsHMDS in the absence of an acidic proton, stoichiometric reactions with benzaldehyde were performed in THF at 70 1C (Scheme 1). Colourless reaction mixtures turned purple for Cs and pink for Rb. Crystals grown from the supernatants at \u2013 20 1C studied by XRD revealed them to be [RbOC(Ph)QNCH2Ph]N (3-Rb) and [CsOC(Ph)QNCH2Ph]N (3-Cs), which crystallised without any solvent coordination in P21/c and Pca21 space groups respectively (Fig. S5 for 3-Rb; Fig. 5 and Fig. S6 for 3-Cs, ESI\u2020). These compounds may be viewed as alkali metal b-imino-alkoxides derived from the tautomer or iminol form of N-(benzyl)benzamide. While the asymmetric unit of 3-Rb contains one [RbOC(Ph)QNCH2Ph] unit, 3-Cs has two [CsOC(Ph) QNCH2Ph]2 units. One Cs atom in the asymmetric unit bridges two b-imino-alkoxide anions via their O atoms while the other Cs binds via the N atom and the p-cloud of Ph ring closest to N (Cs Ct, 3.359 \u00c5, Ct = centroid of Ph ring) of one anion. Analysing bond metrics of 3-Rb and 3-Cs revealed the existence of Rb/Cs\u2013O sinteractions [Rb1\u2013O1, 2.877(9) \u00c5; Cs1\u2013O1, 2.9233(5) \u00c5, Cs1\u2013O2, 2.9837(3) \u00c5] and of an unsaturated N environment [for 3-Rb\nFig. 3 (top) Asymmetric unit of the structure of [{RbOC(Ph) QC(H)C(Ph)QCH2}3 (THF)2]N (2-Rb); (bottom) section of the infinite ladder of 2-Rb.

Commun., 2024, 60, 91\u201394 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024\nC1QN1 1.3152(9) \u00c5; for 3-Cs C1QN1 1.2833(7) \u00c5, C16QN2 1.303(1) \u00c5] (see Tables S4 and S5, ESI\u2020).\n3-Rb forms a cage-like network comprising parallel zig-zag Rb\u2013O\u2013Rb chains which are intercalated by Rb\u2013N and Rb\u2013p (Z6 to the Ph ring shaded grey, Z2 to the CQN bond, and Z1 to the ipso C of the Ph ring shaded yellow) interactions from neighbouring b-imino-alkoxide moieties. Rb coordinates to two O and N atoms forming two different cyclic rings, a Rb\u2013O\u2013Rb\u2013N 4- atom and a highly distorted Rb\u2013O\u2013C\u2013N\u2013Rb\u2013O\u2013C\u2013N 8-atom ring. Each former ring is fused with the latter rings on all sides. This allows the 4-atom grids to propagate linearly in one direction (vertically in Fig. S5, ESI\u2020), via the Rb corners giving it a unique cage shape. The cage motif is preserved in 3-Cs with interlocking zig-zag Cs\u2013O\u2013Cs chains containing an excess of Cs\u2013p interactions on account of the larger radius of Cs versus Rb. Interestingly, this is a marked deviation from the usual azaPeterson olefination mechanism with NaHMDS and benzaldehyde affording N-(trimethylsilyl)imine, an intermediate in the reaction pathway for aminobenzylation of aldehyde with NaHMDS/caesium trifluoroacetate co-operation.6a Though the mechanism of formation of 3 is unknown, germane literature by Toru et al.16 reported heating 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and HMDS(H) in a 2 : 1 ratio at 70 1C to afford N-(pyridin-4ylmethyl)isonicotinamide. Reaction steps involve breaking a Si\u2013N bond, forming a strong Si\u2013O bond, then condensation to the imine which tautomerizes to the amide via a 1,3-proton shift. We have postulated a mechanism for formation of 3 (Scheme 2) along similar lines.\nIn conclusion, this study reveals that both CsHMDS and RbHMDS display interesting reactivities with organic carbonyl substrates. With acetophenone, CsHMDS behaves predictably as a Br\u00f8nsted base deprotonating the a-CH3 group, but the reaction is still novel through the remarkable hexagonal prism shaped network of the enolate product (1-Cs). Adding more novelty, in donor THF, the alkali metal enolates formed in situ ultimately produces dienolates 2-Rb and 2-Cs, which have rarely been isolated for any alkali metal. Further diversity is seen with benzaldehyde in producing b-imino-alkoxides 3-Rb and 3-Cs, which both adopt eye-catching cage networks that interconnect zig-zag M\u2013O\u2013M chains but in distinct ways. Finally, while this study shows that RbHMDS and CsHMDS can exhibit Br\u00f8nsted basicity, some reactions and all the new structures have unique features that demand these heavier alkali metal amides should be studied with a much wider range of organic substrates.\nThis research was supported by the Leverhulme Trust (grant award no: RPG-2019-264)."
