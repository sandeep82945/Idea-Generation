This work demonstrates a model 2D superconducting system with engineered disorder and highlights the impact of dissipation on the local magnetic properties of 2D superconductors and Josephson junction arrays.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe effects of disorder and inhomogeneity on the superconducting properties of thin films have attracted both practical and theoretical interest, particularly in the presence of spatial correlations [1\u20133]. Disorder has been shown to weaken superconductivity in single crystal Sr2RuO4 and thin film YBa2Cu2O7\u2212\u03b4 [4, 5]. In contrast, disorder in monolayers of TaS2 was recently reported to enhance the critical transition temperature [6]. In single atomic layers of lead on silicon, the presence of disorder can lead to atomically short Josephson weak links [7]. The addition of correlated disorder in superconductors can be beneficial for some aspects of superconductivity compared to systems without correlation [8]. In YBa2Cu2O7\u2212\u03b4, microstructures of columnar defects introduced by irradiation pin flux lines more strongly than random point defects, shifting the irreversibility line significantly upward [9\u201311]. In two-dimensional (2D) superconductor-to-insulator systems, the existence of disorder is thought to create weakly coupled islands of su-\n\u2217 Contributed equally to this work \u2020 ilya.sochnikov@uconn.edu\nperconductivity; with increasing disorder, such islands can remain even beyond the superconductor-insulator transition [12, 13]. In numerical studies of the quantum XY model, correlated disorder was shown to cause a broadening of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition with respect to temperature, whereas uncorrelated disorder had no effect on the sharpness of the transition [14]. Inhomogeneity at any length scale can also complicate interpretation of bulk or sample-averaged measurements.\nGiven the effect of both correlated and uncorrelated disorder on superconducting systems, one open question is: how do spatial correlations in disorder affect the magnetic response of a 2D superconducting system? To explore this question, we used scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device microscopy (scanning SQUID microscopy or SSM) to measure the local diamagnetic response of arrays of niobium islands with proximity coupling via a thin layer of gold. Superconducting island arrays on normal metal can be a useful model for studying disorder in 2D superconductors, as both the disorder and critical current can be engineered by changing the spacing between superconducting islands [15\u201317].\nPreviously, Eley et al. showed that transport in ordered arrays of niobium islands on gold can be mod-\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n09 08\n4v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nup r-\nco n]\n1 8\nA ug\n2 02\n2\n2 eled by treating the entire array as a single diffusive superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junction with a junction length equal to the island-toisland spacing, d [18]. Neighboring islands couple to each other by proximitizing the underlying gold, and the system undergoes a BKT transition with decreasing temperature [19\u201321]. In this work we study the effect of engineered disorder on the local magnetic response of proximity coupled superconducting island arrays by comparing SSM susceptibility measurements to a model in which we treat the system as a network of one-dimensional (1D) SNS Josephson junctions, each with a Josephson coupling energy EJ determined by the junction length or distance between islands. We find that the disordered arrays exhibit a spatially inhomogeneous diamagnetic response which, for low applied magnetic fields, is well described by this junction network model. Upon increasing the applied field, the response becomes nonlinear and dissipative, with both the degree of nonlinearity and the spatial structure of the dissipative effects depending strongly on the details of the engineered disorder in a way that is not fully captured by the model."

            "text": "We measured arrays with three types of island configurations: 1) ordered, 2) uncorrelated disorder, and 3) correlated disorder (Figure 1). The ordered array consists of a 100 \u00d7 100\u00b5m2 square lattice of nominally circular niobium islands, with a lattice constant a = 500 nm; each island in the array has a diameter Disland = 260 nm and a height of 100 nm. The minimum edgeto-edge island spacing in the ordered array is therefore d0 = a \u2212 Disland = 240 nm. The disordered arrays were generated by displacing the island positions in the ordered array by a distance |\u2206R| drawn from a normal distribution f(|\u2206R|) = 1\n\u03c3 \u221a 2\u03c0 exp\n( \u2212 |\u2206R| 2\n2\u03c32\n) with stan-\ndard deviation \u03c3 [22]. For arrays with uncorrelated disorder, this process defined the final island locations. To generate correlated disorder, an additional filter kernel was applied to normally distributed island displacements so that the covariance of the displacements of any two islands is described by the correlation function\nR(z) = \u03c32 exp ( \u2212z 2\n`2\n) , (1)\nwhere z is the center-to-center distance between pairs of islands in the square lattice and ` = 5\u00b5m is the correlation length [22].\nFor each array, the locations of the islands were patterned onto a 10 nm thick gold film with lateral dimensions 80\u00d7 80 \u00b5m2 using electron beam lithography, after which the niobium islands were deposited using electron beam evaporation. Transport measurements performed in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 10 mK show two distinct transition temperatures: one from\nFigure 1. Device and sensor geometry.

The background is the SiO2 substrate, the bright pink regions are bare gold film, the gray region is niobium islands directly on SiO2, and the dark pink central 80\u00b5m\u00d780\u00b5m region is niobium islands on top of the gold film.

The islands are drawn to scale, i.e., each island has a diameter of 260 nm. The SQUID susceptometer geometry is shown in (b), with the field coil in blue (large radius) and the pickup loop in red (small radius). There are also superconducting shields covering the field coil and pickup loop leads, which are shown as orange and green polygons, respectively.\nthe niobium islands themselves entering the superconducting regime (T1) and a second, lower transition temperature (T2) marking the onset of phase coherence in the proximitized gold film [16] (see Supplemental Material [23], which includes Refs. [24\u201333]). The superconducting transition temperature of the niobium islands themselves is lower than that of bulk niobium, consistent with previous work [34].\nThe arrays were studied using a scanning SQUID microscope mounted in a helium-3 refrigerator at its base temperature, T = 400 mK. The scanning SQUID susceptometer used in this work consists of gradiometric concentric pickup loop and field coil pairs, with pickup loop inner radius rinnerPL = 1.7\u00b5m (outer radius r outer PL = 2.7\u00b5m) and field coil inner radius rinnerFC = 5.5\u00b5m (outer radius routerFC = 8.0\u00b5m) (Fig. 1 (b)) [35]. Using an SR830 lock-in amplifier, we apply a local low-frequency AC magnetic field to the array using the field coil carrying current IFC and record the flux \u03a6PL through the pickup loop generated by the array\u2019s response as a function of the field\n3 Sample Type of Disorder \u03c3 Ordered Ordered 0%\nUC3 Uncorrelated 40% UC4 Uncorrelated Uniformly distributed C2 Correlated 10% C3 Correlated 15%\nTable I.

We define this response, normalized by the current through the field coil, as the local susceptibility, \u03c6 = \u03a6PL/IFC, which we report in units of \u03a60/A where \u03a60 is the superconducting flux quantum. The gradiometric design of the SQUID susceptometer allows us to detect a local magnetic response due to current flowing in the arrays, \u03a6PL = \u03c6IFC, which is much smaller than the flux through the pickup loop due to the field coil. For example, the measurements presented below have a typical signal magnitude of \u223c 1 \u03a60/A (with signal-to-noise ratio 1 except at very small IFC), which is approximately 1/1000 of the intrinsic mutual inductance between the field coil and pickup loop. (See Supplemental Material [23] for a more detailed description of the sensor design and susceptometry measurement technique.) The susceptibility \u03c6 has a component \u03c6\u2032 that is in-phase with the applied field and a component \u03c6\u2032\u2032 that is out-ofphase with the applied field. The in-phase component is a measure of the local diamagnetic screening in a superconducting sample and hence the London penetration depth or superfluid density, while the out-of-phase component is a measure of dissipative currents. The measurements were performed at nominally zero applied global field, so that the only applied field was the local AC field from the susceptometer field coil."

We applied root-meansquare (RMS) field coil currents IFC from 0.012 mA up to 3.024 mA, corresponding to about 1 \u00b5T to 300 \u00b5T at the center of the field coil, at a frequency of fFC = 800 Hz to probe the linear and nonlinear regimes of the diamagnetic response. The in-phase susceptibility images reveal striking differences in the spatial structure of the diamagnetic susceptibility between the completely ordered array and arrays with disorder (Figure 2). At the lowest field coil current, the ordered array shows homogeneous diamagnetic screening (Figure 2 (a)). From the magnitude of the in-phase susceptibility signal, we estimate an effective 2D penetration depth (equal to half the Pearl\nlength [36]) of \u039b > 500\u00b5m, indicating weak Meissner screening and a small superfluid density [37]. Only at higher field coil currents does spatial structure appear in the form of reduced diamagnetism at the edge of the array (Figure 2 (b-c)). In contrast, in all the arrays with engineered disorder, our measurements reveal significant spatial inhomogeneity in the local diamagnetic response. The diamagnetism in these arrays varies on a length scale of a few microns over the entirety of the array (Figure 2 (g-i) and (m-o)). In arrays with correlated disorder, this inhomogeneity can be seen even at the smallest applied field (Figure 2 (m)).\nThe magnitude and spatial structure of the diamagnetic susceptibility is not constant as a function of the applied field. In Figure 3, the distribution of in-phase diamagnetic susceptibility for each array is plotted as a function of applied field coil current, revealing differences between the ordered and disordered samples in the linearity of the diamagnetic response with respect to the local applied field. Because \u03c6\u2032 necessarily goes to zero at the edges of the arrays, in Figure 3 we plot the distribution of \u03c6\u2032 only from the central 50\u00d750\u00b5m2 region of each array (see colored boxes in Figure 2 (a, g, m)). Except near the edges of the gold film, the ordered sample remains in the linear regime (i.e., the susceptibility is constant as a function of applied field and the out-of-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032\u2032 is small) up to IFC = 1.512 mA (Figure 2 (a-f) and Figure 3 (a)), while the disordered samples enter the nonlinear regime, with decreasing in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 and significant dissipative out-of-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032\u2032, at applied field coil currents as low as IFC = 0.312 mA (Figure 2 (g-l) and (m-r), Figure 3 (b-e)). At the highest IFC, the ordered array begins to exhibit an inhomogeneous response (Figure 2 (c, f)), which we attribute to heating of the gold film due to vortex motion near the edges of the array [23].\nTo explore the role of disorder in the inhomogeneous, nonlinear magnetic response of this engineered 2D superconductor, we have modeled the system as a network of 1D SNS Josephson junctions in which pairs of adjacent islands form junctions with critical current Ic, or Josephson energy EJ = Ic\u03a60/2\u03c0, determined by the junction length or edge-to-edge island spacing d (see Figure 4). Eley et al. found that for ordered triangular arrays of niobium nano-islands on gold, the dependence of the critical current of the entire array on edge-to-edge island spacing d and temperature T is well described by the expression for a single diffusive SNS junction:\nIc(d, T ) = c0 ETh(d)\neRN\n[ 1\u2212 c1 exp ( \u2212c0ETh(d)\n3.2kBT\n)] , (2)\nwhere RN is the normal state resistance, kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and c0 and c1 are dimensionless fitting parameters which are of order 1 [18, 38]. The Thouless energy ETh is given by ETh(d) = ~D/d2, where D is the normal metal diffusion constant, with D = 95 cm2/s for the gold films studied here. At temperatures T that are small compared to the Thouless energy ETh/kB\n4\n(\u2248 1.26 K for the ordered array), Equation 2 is dominated by the term c0ETh/eRN \u221d 1/d2. We therefore assume that the critical current of each junction is given by Ic(d) = I0(d0/d)\n2, where d0 = 240 nm is the minimum island spacing for the ordered array (Figure 1 (b)) and I0 is a constant that corresponds to the maximum critical current per junction in the ordered array. The value of I0 determines the overall strength of the diamagnetic response and select it to roughly match the magnitude of the measured in-phase susceptibility.\nWe model the field coil and pickup loop as 1D circular loops with radii rFC = 6.8\u00b5m and rPL = 2.5\u00b5m respectively (see Figure 4). Given the applied magnetic vector potential A(r) due to a current IFC in the field coil, we solve for the superconducting phase \u03d5i of each island i centered at position ri in the network, subject to the constraints of current conservation and phase single-valuedness, via a large-scale nonlinear programming solver [23, 39, 40]. We then calculate the supercurrent flowing between each pair of islands (i, j) assuming a sinusoidal current-phase relation Iij(\u03b8ij , dij) = Ic(dij) sin \u03b8ij , where dij = |ri \u2212 rj | \u2212Disland is the junction length and \u03b8ij = \u03d5j \u2212 \u03d5i \u2212 2\u03c0\u03a6\u221210 \u222b rj ri A(r) \u00b7 dr is\nthe gauge-invariant phase across the junction. Finally, we compute the flux \u03a6PL through the pickup loop due to the supercurrent flowing in the network to obtain a simulated in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 = \u03a6PL/IFC.\nIt is not computationally practical to model the response of all \u223c 25, 000 islands in an array simultaneously, so we make two simplifying approximations. First, for each field coil position, we construct a network or graph containing only islands inside a \u201cpatch\u201d of radius rpatch = 17\u00b5m = 2.5\u00d7 rFC around the center of the field coil. If the field coil is positioned zFC = 2\u00b5m above the array, the magnitude of the field from the field coil at the edge of patch is \u2248 4% of the field at the center and junctions outside of the patch are at least rpatch = 6.8\u00d7 rPL away from the center of the pickup loop. Therefore, junctions outside of rpatch are both weakly influenced by the field from the field coil and inefficient at coupling flux into the pickup loop, such that they don\u2019t contribute significantly to the susceptibility signal. In practice, increasing rpatch by 20%, from 2.5 \u00d7 rFC to 3 \u00d7 rFC, increases the simulated susceptibility by < 3% and does not significantly affect the spatial structure [23]. Second, we assume that only islands whose centers lie within a ra-\n5\ndius rcutoff = 0.9\u00b5m of one another form junctions. We chose rcutoff = 0.9\u00b5m so that 2\u03beN < rcutoff < 2a, where \u03beN = \u221a ~D/kBT \u2248 0.425\u00b5m is the normal metal coherence length and a = 0.5\u00b5m is the ordered array lattice constant [18, 41, 42]. For this patch radius and junction cutoff radius, a typical patch contains a few thousand islands and 10, 000\u2212 20, 000 junctions [23]. Note that this model simulates the static magnetic response of the arrays, but the local field applied by the SQUID field coil varies sinusoidally at a frequency fFC = 800 Hz. Thus, an additional assumption is that fFC is slow compared to other timescales in the system, such that the applied field can be approximated as time-independent. This model also neglects any inductive coupling between the junctions, which we expect to be small given the very weak screening in this system [43].\nA comparison of the in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 measured in the SSM experiments and simulated using the junction network model is shown in Figure 5. The model reproduces the spatially uniform and linear magnetic response in the ordered array (Figure 5 (a, f, k)). In the arrays with uncorrelated disorder, the local diamagnetic response exhibits a granular spatial structure (Figure 5 (b, c)), and \u03c6\u2032 is suppressed more rapidly with increasing applied field than in the ordered array or the arrays with correlated disorder (Figure 3 (b, c)). Both of these effects are captured qualitatively by the junction network model (Figure 5 (g, h) and (l, m)). The simulated susceptibility of the correlated arrays is in good agreement with the measurements (Figure 5 (d, i) and (e, j)), which is most easily visible in array C3 (Figure 5 (e, j)) as it exhibits\nthe highest contrast and most distinctive spatial features in \u03c6\u2032 as a function of field coil position.\nThe magnitude of \u03c6\u2032 depends strongly on the distance zFC between the field coil and the sample, and in this particular experiment there was significant uncertainty (\u223c 2 \u2212 3\u00b5m) in zFC. This is likely the cause of the discrepancy in the magnitude of \u03c6\u2032 at low field coil currents between Figure 3 (experiment) and Figure 5 (k-o) (simulation), and is why we plot the normalized susceptibility \u03c6\u2032/\u03c6\u2032max in Figure 5 (a-j). We expect that if zFC were known with a high degree of certainty, the junction network model would reproduce quantitatively both the magnitude and spatial structure of the in-phase susceptibility at low applied fields.\nAlthough susceptibility simulations using the junction network model do exhibit nonlinearity with increasing applied field as the gauge-invariant phase \u03b8 across junctions in the network becomes large enough that sin \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 is not a good approximation (see Figure 5 (k-o) and Supplemental Material [23]), in all cases the observed onset of nonlinearity in simulation occurs at a larger applied field than in experiment. For example, the ordered array shows appreciable out-of-phase response at IFC = 1.512 mA (Figure 2 (f)), however the flux through an a \u00d7 a = 500 \u00d7 500 nm2 square unit cell or \u201cplaquette\u201d due to a loop with radius rFC = 6.8\u00b5m carrying IFC = 1.512 mA is < 0.017 \u03a60, corresponding to a gaugeinvariant phase difference of \u03b8 < 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.017/4 \u2248 0.027 radians across each of the four junctions in the plaquette, a value for which sin \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 is a very good approximation. Furthermore, this mechanism for nonlinearity is purely\n6\ngeometric, having no dependence on the overall strength of the Josephson coupling in the system (which is set in the model by the critical current scale I0). This suggests that there is another mechanism contributing to the onset of nonlinearity and dissipation in these arrays. One candidate is motion of vortices induced in the 2D superconducting system above a lower critical field Bcrit0 , as has been studied theoretically for uniform applied fields [44, 45] and for nonuniform applied fields in the context of two-coil mutual inductance susceptibility measurements [46\u201348]. Lemberger and Ahmed [47] found that for a 2D superconductor in the weak screening (large \u039b) limit with Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \u03be subject to a nonuniform field from a point dipole or small current loop, there can be no vortex-free state above a lower critical field Bcrit0 \u2248 \u03a60/(2\u03c10\u03be), where \u03c10 \u039b is the radial distance from the magnetic source at which the applied field changes sign. This relationship between the coherence length \u03be and the onset of vortex-related nonlinear magnetic response has been used to measure \u03be in superconducting thin films [48]. For our field coil with radius rFC = 6.8\u00b5m located 2\u00b5m above the film, the applied field changes sign at \u03c10 \u2248 7.5\u00b5m. Assuming \u03be = a for the ordered square array with lattice constant a [42] gives a lower critical field Bcrit0 \u2248 275\u00b5T, or a lower critical field coil current IcritFC \u2248 3.4 mA. The actual applied field (or field coil current) at which nonlinearity due to vortex dynamics begins to occur is necessarily smaller than this maximum vortex-free field, which is consistent with the SQUID measurements (Figure 2 (f)). In a homogeneous 2D superconductor, vortices are expected to first appear at the position with the highest superfluid momentum, i.e., the position where the vector potential |A(r)| is largest [47, 49], and we expect the same to be true for the ordered array. Any vortices that are present will experience a force due to the local AC applied field from the field coil. If the vortices are not strongly pinned they will move under this force, and it is this vortex motion that causes dissipation. For a detailed analysis of the impact of vortex dynamics on two-coil mutual inductance measurements of 2D superconductors, see Ref. [50]. Viewed through this lens, our results (Figures 2 and 3) suggest that disorder in the island spacing affects both the superfluid density and the coherence length \u03be of the 2D superconductor formed by the proximity coupled nano-islands, and that both quantities can be probed locally with SSM via the linear and nonlinear magnetic response, respectively. Future work will focus on the magnetic response of ordered proximity coupled island arrays as a function of the island spacing over a wider range of local applied AC field. Such measurements will allow us to validate our model for the island spacing dependence of the junction critical currents, Ic(d), and quantify how well the junction network model describes nonlinearities at higher applied field, which will in turn inform the design of future experiments on arrays with different geometries and materials. Beyond scanning SQUID microscopy, the prox-\n7\nimity effect model systems introduced here could potentially be studied with time or frequency resolved imaging to better understand the dynamics causing dissipative behavior [51].\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the design, control, and measurement of a model superconducting system with engineered disorder to simulate the spatial evolution of superfluid density and phase coherence in 2D superconductors with micron-scale disorder. Scanning SQUID microscopy measurements reveal a magnetic response that is nonlinear and spatially inhomogeneous, and this response can be tuned by changing the disorder landscape. For small applied fields, the local diamagnetic response of the arrays is in good agreement with a model that treats the system as a network of Josephson junctions with island spacing-dependent Josephson coupling. However, we find that the onset of nonlinearity and dissipation with increasing applied field cannot be fully explained simply by considering the nonlinear (i.e., sinusoidal) current-phase relation of the junctions. This\nmotivates future work on a theoretical description that incorporates the rich nonlinear and dissipative physics underlying this engineered, disordered 2D superconducting system."

Each FC-PL pair has a mutual inductance |\u03a6PL/IFC| of approximately 900 \u03a60/A, meaning that a current of IFC = 1 mA flowing through the field coil threads a flux of |\u03a6PL| = 0.9 \u03a60 \u2248 1.86 mT\u00b5m2 through the pickup loop. The gradiometric geometry of the circuit means that, in the absence of a sample with nonzero magnetic susceptibility, the total mutual inductance between the two field coils and the SQUID is zero (modulo any lithographic imperfections): M = (\u03a6frontPL + \u03a6 back PL )/IFC = 0 \u03a60/A.\nWhen the front field coil is brought close to a superconducting sample, the sample screens the field from the field coil, modifying the mutual inductance of the front FC-PL pair, and thus the mutual total mutual inductance of the susceptometer. The amount by which the sample modifies the SQUID mutual inductance M is the scanning SQUID susceptibility signal \u03c6(x, y) = \u2206MzfC(x, y), which is measured as a function of relative sample-sensor position (x, y) as the sensor is rastered over the sample surface with the field coil at a fixed height zFC. \u03c6(x, y) is measured using phase-sensitive low-frequency lock-in detection, allowing us to detect both the in-phase magnetic response \u03c6\u2032(x, y) and out-of-phase magnetic response \u03c6\u2032\u2032(x, y) of the sample. In addition to the samplesensor spacing zFC, the susceptibility signal \u03c6 depends on the sample\u2019s local magnetic screening length (the London penetration depth \u03bb for bulk superconductors, or the Pearl length 2\u039b = 2\u03bb2/t for superconducting thin films with thickness t \u03bb) [37]. Given the layer structure of the SQUID susceptometer used here, the pickup loop is roughly 550 nm closer to the sample than the field coil: zPL = zFC \u2212 550 nm, which is accounted for in the modeling [35]."

All images were taken at the same nominal temperature and SQUID - sample distance zFC, with the exception of the data for C2 (panels j, k, l), which is known to have been measured with a 2 \u2212 3\u00b5m larger sensor-sample distance compared to all other arrays, resulting in a relative overall reduction in signal magnitude. However, for all measurements shown here there is some uncertainty (\u223c 2\u2212 3\u00b5m) in zFC, which makes it difficult to compare the absolute magnetic of the diamagnetic response both between measurements of different arrays and between measurements and simulations of the same array. Note that the field coil currents shown for C2 (j, k, l) differ slightly from those shown for the other four samples.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a SQUID susceptibility measurement increases with increasing field coil current IFC. At large field coil currents (Figure S4, bottom row), the diamagnetic response of the bare niobium islands deposited outside the region with gold film is visible in the images of the two uncorrelated arrays, (UC3, Figure S4 (f)) and (UC4, Figure S4 (i)). This is why the region of nonzero \u03c6\u2032 is larger in (f, i) than it is in (d, g). The dissipative out-of-phase response \u03c6\u2032\u2032 is limited to the smaller region with gold beneath the islands (Figure S5f and i). For the ordered and correlated disorder samples (c, l, o), the signal from the bare niobium islands is not easily visible due to the large signal from the proximitized gold region. Figure S6 is an expanded version of Figure 3 in the main text, showing the distribution of both in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 and out-of-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032\u2032 as a function of applied field coil current for all five arrays. Note that \u03c6\u2032\u2032, which is associated with dissipation in the arrays, starts near zero at low field coil\ncurrent and appears to plateau at higher field coil current. In contrast, \u03c6\u2032, which is associated with Meissner screening currents, starts at a finite value at low field coil currents and decreases with increasing field coil current (except near the center of the ordered array, where \u03c6\u2032 is roughly constant as a function of field coil current).\nAs mentioned in the main text, the ordered array begins to exhibit an inhomogeneous magnetic response at the highest local applied AC field (or field coil current IFC), as can be seen in Figure 2 (c, f) or in panel (c) of Figures S4 and S5. The edges of the array show significantly reduced in-phase response \u03c6\u2032 (Figure S4 (c)) and increased dissipative out-of-phase response \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (Figure S5 (c)). Even away from the edges, the bottom half of the array shows a slightly smaller in-phase response than the top half of the array (Figure S4 (c)).\nThis difference in \u03c6\u2032 between the top and bottom halves of the ordered array is most likely due to local heating of the gold film caused by vortex motion near the edges of the array, rather than to an intrinsic difference between the two halves of the device. If the junctions in the bottom half of the array simply had a smaller critical current (e.g., due to lithography or morphology differences), the bottom half of the array would have a weaker diamagnetic response than the top half for all values of the applied AC field (as the effective penetration depth for an ordered junction array with junction critical currents Ic is \u039b \u221d 1/Ic). However, the diamagnetic response of the ordered array appears to be very homogeneous for smaller applied AC fields (Figure S4 (a, b)).\nTo generate the susceptibility maps shown in Figures S4 and S5, the SQUID sensor is raster-scanned over the field of view. Typically starting at the bottom left corner of the field of view, data is acquired while the field coil and pickup loop are scanned horizontally to the bottom right corner, producing the bottom row of pixels. Then the sensor is returned to the left side of the field of view (without acquiring data) and its position is advanced towards the \u201ctop\u201d of the field of view by a distance corresponding to one pixel. The process is repeated to acquire the next row of pixels. Vortex motion occurring when the sensor is near the bottom edge of the array (orange/yellow features at the bottom of Figure S5 (c)) could heat the gold film causing a weaker diamagnetic response from the bottom half of the array, but only at applied AC fields large enough to induce vortices near the edge of the array.\nThe diagonal feature near the center right of the array in panel (c) of Figures S4 and S5 is also consistent with this picture (i.e., heating due to vortex motion as the sensor passes over the left edge of the array). Under this hypothesis, the fact that \u03c6\u2032 in the top right quadrant of the array in Figure S4 (c) is equal to \u03c6\u2032 in the entire array at lower applied AC fields in Figures S4 (a, b) indicates that the heating effect is absent when the field coil and pickup loop are in that region of the device, i.e., the gold film has cooled to its equilibrium temperature by the time the SQUID reaches that region, and that region is mea-\n4 Figure S4.

The SQUID sensor is scanned in a plane that is nominally parallel to the sample surface.

This data was taken in a dilution refrigeration system with a base temperature of 10 mK. Note that the data taken on UC3 was done using a 3-point measurement set-up, while C3 was done using a 4-point measurement set-up. As a result, the data from UC3 has a lower signal-to-noise ratio and the resistance was offset by a constant. Another result of the 3-point measurement is the resistance seemingly increases below 1 K. This is believed to be due to a change of phase in the current, and does not have any physical significance.\nIt is important to note how the change in disorder affects the shape of the resistance versus temperature graph. In C3, the islands begin to enter the superconducting phase at around 8 K. The sharper drop around 3.5 K represents when the system was sufficiently cool enough to have a proximity effect on the surrounding gold to get a supercurrent flowing through parts of the gold substrate.

In UC3, the island superconducting regime is more smeared out and the proximity-induced effect of gold requires lower temperatures to begin. Note that the data for UC3 was taken using a 3-point measurement, so the data was offset by a constant resistance and had a phase shift near 0 Kelvin, resulting in a seemingly non-zero resistance.\nand it takes a lower temperature for the gold to become a proximity-induced superconductor.

We assume that pairs of islands (i, j) form 1D Josephson junctions (edges) with critical current Ic,ij or Josephson energy EJ,ij = Ic,ij\u03a60/2\u03c0. To simplify the problem, we assume that only islands whose centers lie within a radius rcutoff of one another form junctions, such that there are m junctions in total. As described in the main text, we assume that the junction critical currents depend on junction length or edge-toedge island spacing dij = |ri \u2212 rj | \u2212Disland according to Ic,ij(dij) = I0(d0/dij)\n2, where d0 = 240 nm is the minimum edge-to-edge island spacing in the ordered array and I0 is a constant that corresponds to the maximum critical current per junction in the ordered array [18].\nWe remove from the network any islands that have fewer than 2 neighbors within the cutoff radius rcutoff because such islands are either completely isolated (0 neighbors) or can only satisfy the current conservation constraint (see below) if no current flows through the adjacent junction (1 neighbor). If two or more islands are overlapping (i.e., edge-to-edge island spacing dij \u2264 0, see Figure S2), we remove the overlapping islands and replace them with a single island whose center is located at the average position of the centers of the original islands.\nFor an applied magnetic vector potential A(r), assuming all junctions have a sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR), the current Iij flowing from island i to island j is Iij = Ic,ij sin \u03b8ij , where \u03b8ij = \u03d5j\u2212\u03d5i\u22122\u03c0Aij is the gaugeinvariant phase difference and Aij = \u03a6 \u22121 0 \u222b rj ri\nA(r) \u00b7 dr. Given a network constructed as described above, the goal is to find island phases \u03d5i that satisfy the following constraints:\n\u2022 Current conservation: for each island i, the sum of the currents entering i is equal to the sum of the currents leaving i.\n\u2022 Phase single-valuedness: for each loop (closed path) ` in the network,\n\u2211 i,j in loop ` ( \u03d5j \u2212 \u03d5i \u2212 2\u03c0 \u03a60 \u222b rj ri A(r) \u00b7 dr ) = \u2211 i,j in loop ` (\u03b4ij \u2212 2\u03c0Aij)\n= \u2211\ni,j in loop `\n\u03b8ij\n= 2\u03c0(f` \u2212 n`),\nwhere f` \u2208 R is the frustration index of the loop and n` \u2208 Z is the number of flux quanta enclosed in the loop [49].\nFor a connected graph with n nodes and m edges, the number of basis cycles is m \u2212 n + 1 [31]. All loops in the graph can be formed from these basis cycles via\nsymmetric differences, so this represents the minimum number of loops for which we need to enforce the phase single-valuedness constraint. We treat the total flux \u03a6` = \u03a60f` through each loop ` as a single continuous variable.

The magnetic vector potential A(r) from the field coil carrying current IFC is given in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, K(m) and E(m) [30]:\nA(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = \u2212\u00b50IFCa \u03c0m (m\u2212 2)K(m) + 2E(m)\u221a r2 + a2 + 2ar sin \u03b8 \u03d5\u0302, where\na = rFC, and\nm = k2\n= 4ar sin \u03b8\nr2 + a2 + 2ar sin \u03b8 .\nHere the vector r = (r, \u03b8, \u03d5) is given in spherical coordinates relative to the center of the field coil, with r the radial distance from the field coil center, \u03b8 the polar angle, and \u03d5 the azimuthal angle. For each field coil position, we model a \u201cpatch\u201d containing all islands within a radius rpatch of the field coil center, rather than the entire array in order to reduce the computational resources required to solve the model (see discussion of scaling below). We assume that junctions outside of rpatch are both weakly influenced by the field from the field coil and inefficient at coupling flux into the pickup loop such that they don\u2019t contribute significantly to the susceptibility signal (see Figure S9).\nThe magnetic field B produced by a given set of junction currents Iij , is given by the Biot-Savart law:\nB(r) = \u00b50 4\u03c0 \u2211 junctions ij Iij \u00d7 (r\u2212 rij) |r\u2212 rij |3 , where\nrij = 1\n2 (ri + rj) is the center of junction ij, and\nIij = Iij(rj \u2212 ri).\nThe resulting flux through the pickup loop \u03a6PL is found by integrating the z-component of B over the surface of the pickup loop. In practice, the pickup loop is discretized into a Delaunay mesh [32] composed of a few thousand triangles t, each with area At and centroid (center of mass) position rt, so that the flux through the pickup loop is:\n\u03a6PL = \u222b PL B(r) \u00b7 z\u0302d2r\n\u2248 \u2211\ntriangles t\nAtB(rt) \u00b7 z\u0302.\nFinally the (in-phase) susceptibility is given by \u03c6\u2032 = \u03a6PL/IFC."

This gives an estimate of d(xi, yi) at each of the island positions, from which we compute d(x, y) for any (x, y) within the film via linear interpolation.\nThe arrays with correlated disorder (C2, C3) are locally ordered on a length scale given by the engineered correlation length, ` = 5\u00b5m, so one might expect their local magnetic response at low applied fields to be approximately described by a local effective penetration depth \u039b(x, y), as given in Equation 2. In contrast, the arrays with uncorrelated disorder (UC3, UC4) are not ordered on any experimentally relevant length scale, so we do not expect Equation 2 to capture their magnetic response.\nHaving defined the film\u2019s effective penetration depth \u039b, we model the film\u2019s response to the field due to a current IFC flowing in the SQUID susceptometer field coil by self-consistently solving Equation 1 inside the film and the three superconducting layers of the SQUID, and Maxwell\u2019s equations in the vacuum regions between superconducting layers. We use the SuperScreen Python package [33], which implements a numerical method developed by Brandt [29] and first applied to scanning SQUID microscopy by Kirtley, et al. [25, 26] Just as in a scanning SQUID susceptometry measurement, the\n10\nFigure S11. Schematic depiction of the CLF and DJN models. (a) Niobium island positions for a 25 \u00d7 25\u00b5m2 region of correlated array C3 (\u03c3 = 15%), with island diameters drawn to scale. (b) Effective penetration depth \u039b(x, y) for the same region, calculated using Equation 2 assuming I0 = 260 nA with d(x, y) obtained by averaging the local island spacing over 8 nearest neighbors. The colored polygons in the bottom right show the geometry of SQUID susceptometer simulated in the CLF model, again drawn to scale. (c) The network of Josephson junctions used to represent this region of the array in the DJN model. Each line represents a single junction, where we assume that niobium islands form junctions with all neighboring islands within a radius of rcutoff = 0.9\u00b5m \u2248 2.1\u00d7 \u03beN , where \u03beN \u2248 0.425\u00b5m is the normal metal coherence length. The shade of each line corresponds to the junction critical current, as shown by the colorbar. The blue circle shows the 1D loop with radius rFC = 6.8\u00b5m used to model the field coil, and the red circle shows the 1D loop with radius rPL = 2.5\u00b5m used to model the pickup loop. Regions in (a) that are more densely populated with islands have a shorter penetration depth in (b) and have a higher density of junctions in (c), and those junctions have larger critical currents.\npresence of the sample modifies the mutual inductance \u03a6PL/IFC between the SQUID field coil and pickup loop and this change in the mutual inductance, which depends upon \u039b(x, y) in the vicinity of the field coil, is the SQUID susceptibility signal. The simulated susceptibility is completely independent of IFC due to the linearity of the London model (Equation 1). See Figure S12 for a comparison of results from the CLF and DJN models to the measured low-applied-field in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 for all five arrays.\nThe DJN approach avoids two assumptions required by Equation 2 and the CLF model, namely that the superconducting phase gradient across the array is small, and that the array is (at least locally) ordered [49]. Avoiding the first assumption allows us to explore nonlinearities in the magnetic response at large applied fields as the gauge-invariant phase \u03b8 across junctions in the network becomes large enough that sin \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 is not a good approximation. Avoiding the second assumption means that the model is applicable to arrays with both correlated and uncorrelated disorder.\n11\nFigure S12. Comparison of results from the CLF and DJN models to the measured low-applied-field in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032 for all five arrays. Top row (a-e): Normalized in-phase susceptibility \u03c6\u2032/\u03c6\u2032max measured at IFC = 0.05 mA for panels (a, b, c, e) and IFC = 0.1 mA for panel d. Middle row (f-j): \u03c6\n\u2032/\u03c6\u2032max calculated using the DJN model with rcutoff = 0.9\u00b5m and rpatch = 17\u00b5m = 2.5 \u00d7 rFC. For both models we use a field coil current IFC = 0.05 mA, a distance zFC = 2\u00b5m between the sample surface and SQUID field coil, and a critical current scale of I0 = 260 nA. Bottom row (k-o): \u03c6\n\u2032/\u03c6\u2032max calculated using the CLF model, with local island spacing d(x, y) averaged over 8 nearest neighbors. Note that there are regions near the center of array UC4, with uniformly distributed island positions (panel c), where niobium islands have been scraped off due to contact with the SQUID susceptometer, which is not accounted for in either model."
