    "abstractText": "Breast cancer is the most frequent form of cancer occurring in women of any age. Among the different types, the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is recognized as the most severe form, being associated with the highest mortality rate. Currently, there are no effective treatments for TNBC. For this reason, the research of novel therapeutics is urgently needed. Natural products and their analogs have historically made a major contribution to pharmacotherapy and the treatment of various human diseases, including cancer. In this study, we explored the potential anti-cancer effects of erucin, the most abundant H2S-releasing isothiocyanate present in arugula (Eruca sativa) in MDA-MB-231 cells, a validated in vitro model of TNBC. We found that erucin, in a concentrationdependent manner, significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. Additionally, erucin prevented intracellular ROS generation promoting the expression of key antioxidant genes and halted MDA-MB-231 cell migration, invasion, and colony formation. In conclusion, using a cellular and molecular biology approach, we show that the consumption of erucin could represent a novel and promising strategy for intervention against TNBC.",

            "text": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 12\u201320% of all breast cancer cases and affects with higher frequency young women carrying BRCA1 gene expression [1]. The term triple-negative refers to the fact that breast cancer cells lose the expression of three major classes of hormone receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These alterations make patients refractory to conventional hormonal therapies, causing major difficulties in clinical decision making and management. Current treatment options are limited to surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Although progress has been made over the last century in cancer research, TNBC still causes the highest rate of deaths among all types of breast cancer [2]. For this reason, there is an urgent need to discover and develop new therapeutics to treat effectively TNBC. In this regard, numerous therapeutic dietary or non-dietary compounds present in plants have gained much interest due to their preventive and protective action against different types of cancer [3\u20135]. A considerable number of pre-clinical and clinical studies show that phytochemicals exert protective effects against the growth and spread of tumor cells by regulating their proliferative capacity, and survival, as well as counteracting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [6,7]. Among edible phytochemicals, the consumption of cruciferous vegetables belonging to the large family of Brassicaceae (also called Cruciferae) has been reported to decrease the risk of\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 6764. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24076764 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\ndeveloping several types of cancers, including lung, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer [8\u201310]. The Brassicaceae family includes the rocket plant, which is an annual plant very popular all around the world for the edible green leaves commonly used for salad and food dish recipes. The two main varieties of rocket plants are Diplotaxis tenuifolia (wild rocket) and Eruca sativa (arugula, or cultivated rocket). Eruca sativa contains a wide range of compounds with nutraceutical and organoleptic properties, including isothiocyanates, phenolic compounds, and carotenoids. Among them, erucin (4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate) is one of the major components of leaves obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucoerucin. As demonstrated in a large number of in vitro and in vivo studies, erucin exerts protective effects against several types of human cancers, including breast cancer [8,11\u201315]. Remarkably, recent findings revealed that the protective effect of erucin relies on its intrinsic capacity to slowly release hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is one of three gasotransmitters, along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), which act in our body to modulate numerous biological processes [16]. Despite that, the potential use of erucin against TNBC has not yet been investigated. Toward this goal, in this study we explored the potential anticancer effect of erucin on cell proliferation and survival, ROS production, migration, and invasion in human MDA-MB231 cells using an in vitro model of TNBC."

Subsequently, we explored the potential effects of erucin on cell necrosis and apoptosis in the same cell line using FACS analysis. Using this approach, we found that erucin (30 \u00b5M) induced both early and late cell apoptosis in about 60% of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1B). This effect was then confirmed by western blot analysis, revealing the time-dependent cleavage (hence activation) of Caspase-3 and its substrate poly (adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase (PARP) by erucin (Figure 1D)."

Additionally, by western blot analysis, we found that erucin significantly increased the expression of LC3II protein, which is the lipidated form of the LC3I (Figure 2F,G), and concomitantly decreased the expression of p62. These latter are known to be two key positive and negative regulators of autophagosome formation and activity, respectively (Figure 2F\u2013H)."

            "text": "Natural compounds, including those present in Cruciferae, are shown to significantly prevent and decrease cancer development and progression. In particular, the protective effect of Cruciferae is attributed to isothiocyanates, a large class of products derived by the hydrolysis of glucosinolates, including sulforaphane and erucin [19]. Remarkably, in the last few years, the potential use of erucin as a new strategy to tackle chemoresistance in cancer emerged owing to its ability to remove oxidative stress and halt inflammatory signaling [20\u201322]. In a recent review article, Singh and colleagues report that erucin exerts anticancer effects by inhibiting carcinogen-activating enzymes and promoting the activity of detoxifying enzymes and the mechanisms leading to the inhibition of metastasic processes and angiogenesis [23]. Additionally, erucin leads to the activation of apoptotic processes in cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and suppressing microtubule dynamics [24,25]. However, erucin potentiates the anticancer activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines [26] and, in combination with lapatinib, seems to overcome drug resistance in the same cells [27,28]. H2S donors and their derivatives were demonstrated to effectively reduce the proliferation and apoptosis of TNBC cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation or expression of proteins associated with NF-\u03baB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. They also inhibited the expression of MMP-2/9 and EMT to resist TNBC metastasis by inhibiting aberrant activation of the \u03b2-catenin pathway [29]. Recently, Citi et al. reported that erucin limits the proliferation, growth, and survival of pancreatic cancer cells through a mechanism dependent on the slow release of H2S [13]. However, the role of H2S in cancer is still matter of debate since, in the current relevant literature, there are studies either supporting a beneficial or detrimental role on cancer development, differentiation, metastasis, and proliferation. These divergent effects are most likely due to different effect in different type of cancers as well as the methodological approaches used. Another variant to be taken into account is the release kinetic of H2S. Indeed, H2S is known to produce hormetic responses, which refer to a biphasic dose/concentration effect. Typically, a low dose produces stimulatory or beneficial effects, while a high dose produces inhibitory or toxic effects [30\u201332]. The second important issue is how much of the hydrogen sulfide released effectively penetrates the cells. Erucin it has been shown to release H2S inside cells in a dose-dependent manner [33]. In our experimental settings, erucin reduced proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner of MDA-MB-231 cells, which is an elective model of TNBC with an high proliferative capacity. In particular, at the concentration selected 30 \u00b5M erucin causes an inhibition of cell proliferation of about 50%. Moreover, at this concentration erucin also promotes a significant apoptosis concomitantly enhancing the expression of key genes and proteins (BECN1, LC3, ULK1, ATG13, BNIP3) triggering and driving autophagy. Thus, erucin acts on both autophagy and apoptosis, with these functions being intimately intertwined to control, among numerous processes, the cell fate [34,35]; this approach represents a promising target in many types of cancer. Intracellular imbalance in ROS production is one of the major pathological mechanisms underpinning tumor initiation and metastatic progression [36]. Treatment of cells with erucin significantly prevented the intracellular formation of ROS in TNBC cells. This effect could be simply due to the ability of the H2S released intracellularly by erucin to scavenge ROS directly [37]. However, based on our results, the antioxidant effect of erucin is not only exerted through the direct \u201cquenching\u201d effect of H2S on ROS; erucin also induces the expression of Nrf2 and concomitantly reduces the expression of its repressor Keap1. Nrf2 is also a key transcriptional factor acting to promote the expression of numerous antioxidant genes, including GCLC, GCLM, SOD1, and HMOX-1. Since the expression of all the aforementioned genes was increased in MDA-MB-231 cells, erucin displays a direct quenching\neffect coupled to a molecular modulation on Nrf2, as shown by other researchers [38]. To further characterize the erucin profile, we studied the ability of this H2S donor to interfere in vitro with migration, invasion, and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells. To perform this study, we used doses that do not trigger apoptosis and/or autophagy. Erucin, at the 1 \u00b5M concentration, showed a significant inhibitory effect on migration. The same dose caused an even more marked inhibitory effect on invasion and colony formation, giving about 80% on both parameters evaluated. These results further support the proposal that erucin effects involve a reduction in both ROS and more than one molecular mechanism. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the use of hydrogen sulfide donors as a promising strategy for curative and/or adjuvant therapies against TNBC. Moreover, our data suggest that low and slowly delivered levels of hydrogen sulfide intracellularly are necessary to achieve beneficial effect. However, future studies are necessary to explore the effect of erucin alone or in combination with conventional anticancer agents using in vivo models of TNBC."
