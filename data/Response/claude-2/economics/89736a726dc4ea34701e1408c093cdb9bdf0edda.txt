 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different components of human capital (general, technical, managerial) on innovation performance in more detail. The current model combines them into overall human capital stock, but looking at their distinct effects could provide more nuanced insights. 

2. Incorporate additional variables into the model that influence human capital and innovation, such as organizational culture, leadership, collaboration between teams, etc. This could reveal new relationships and dynamics.

3. Conduct empirical research using survey data from high-tech firms to quantify the model's variables and relationships. This could validate or refine the theoretical model with real-world data. 

4. Compare the human capital-innovation link across different types of high-tech firms - e.g. hardware vs software, biotech vs infotech. There may be differences in how human capital drives innovation.

5. Extend the model to other knowledge-intensive industries beyond high-tech, such as management consulting, financial services, healthcare, etc. This could identify commonalities and differences in the human capital-innovation relationship.
