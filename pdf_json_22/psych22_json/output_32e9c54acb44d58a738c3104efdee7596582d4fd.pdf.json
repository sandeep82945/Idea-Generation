Few studies have examined the combined relationship between mindfulness, depression, and emotional eating, with even fewer studies examining mindfulness as a potential mediator. To our knowledge, no known studies have examined this potential mediational relationship speci cally in bariatric surgery candidates.\nWhat This Study Adds The current study adds to the existing literature by examining mindfulness facets as potential mediators between depression symptoms and emotional eating speci cally in bariatric surgery candidates. Results from the current study suggest that nonjudgment towards thoughts and feelings may be one particular mechanism to target in treatments to reduce emotional eating in bariatric surgery candidates who are experiencing depression symptoms.\nIntroduction\nPage 3/16\nEmotional eating, generally de ned as eating with the intended function of reducing stress or emotional upset, is a common behavior found in bariatric surgery candidates (occurring in up to 40% of surgery candidates) and often is associated with depression and anxiety symptoms [1]. Pre-surgical emotional eating severity has been found to be signi cantly associated with poorer weight loss outcomes following 3 types of bariatric procedures (gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, biliopancreatic diversion; [2]) and weight regain following gastric bypass surgery [3]. However, one study found that emotional eating was associated with increased odds of post-surgical weight loss success (de ned as > 50% excess weight loss 2 years post-operatively; [4]).\nDepression also is common in bariatric surgery candidates, present in at least one quarter and up to one half of patients (e.g., [5\u20138]). There is some evidence to indicate that depression may not improve following bariatric surgery, especially in the long-term [6, 9]. One study found that while pre-operative depression was not predictive of post-operative depression 6\u201312 months following surgery, it was predictive of post-operative depression at 24\u201336 months post-surgery [10]. Some studies have also found that the risk of suicidality increases after bariatric surgery, with mood disorder and hopelessness independently being associated with this risk [11].\nTherefore, the presence of pre-operative depression may serve as a risk factor for poor outcomes in bariatric surgery. However, ndings on this have been mixed, with some studies indicating no effect of pre-operative depression on weight loss outcomes especially if the depression is well-controlled [12, 13], some nding poorer weight loss outcomes in those with pre-operative depression [10], and some nding that pre-operative depression actually improves outcomes such as increasing physical quality of life and weight loss [14].\nOne reason for the inconsistency in results could be that depression may have an indirect impact on weight loss outcomes. Depression may be more directly related to engagement in post-surgical behaviors that are not conducive to good outcomes, such as missing follow-up medical appointments or engaging in problematic eating behaviors. For example, individuals with depression-obesity comorbidity may be prone to engaging in a vicious cycle of overeating to manage emotions, which may lead to weight gain and resulting feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and self-perceived inadequacy [15].\nThe relationship between depression and emotional eating has been well documented (e.g., [16\u201319]). Among overweight individuals, eating triggered by depression was associated with emotion regulation di culties and lower psychological well-being [20]. This relationship may vary by severity of obesity, with emotion dysregulation being associated with greater emotional eating through depression in individuals with severe obesity but not moderate obesity [21]. Individuals with current or remitted depression endorsed signi cantly more emotional eating [22], and both emotional eating and dichotomous thinking mediated the relationship between depression and body mass index (BMI) [23]. Emotional eating also has moderated the relationship between depression and BMI [24, 25].\nExamining modi able psychological processes that serve as links between emotional eating and depression could further inform treatment development efforts and improve surgical outcomes for these\nPage 4/16\npatients. Mindfulness may be one such process. Studies from bariatric surgery samples, patients with diabetes, college students, and other non-clinical samples have found that higher levels of mindfulness were negatively associated with emotional eating, including mindfulness facets such as acting with awareness, describing, and nonjudging [26\u201331]. In a Dutch general population, emotional eating was signi cantly and negatively associated with depression and this relationship was mediated by acting with awareness [16]. Interestingly, higher levels of observing predicted greater emotional eating in some studies [7, 32, 33].\nIn a study of 820 bariatric surgery candidates, it was found that higher levels of acting with awareness and describing were associated with less emotional eating above and beyond depression severity, with a trend towards a similar relationship with nonreacting [32]. However, no known studies have examined the degree to which mindfulness mediates the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating speci cally within bariatric surgery candidates. Perhaps one reason for the mixed ndings with respect to depression symptoms on bariatric outcomes could be that the interaction between symptoms and the reaction towards those symptoms is most important, rather than the symptoms themselves per se. A nonaccepting stance towards those emotional experiences could result in engaging in actions that would reduce the likelihood of surgical success, such as emotional eating.\nThe current report from the Rhode Island Bariatric Surgery (RIBS) study of the Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) Project seeks to examine the potential mediating effects of mindfulness on the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating within bariatric surgery candidates. Based on prior research suggesting that multiple facets may be related to depression and emotional eating, all ve facets of mindfulness (observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreacting) were tested as potential mediators. However, it was hypothesized that the mindfulness facet of acting with awareness would be the strongest mediator between depression severity and emotional eating based on some studies [16, 30, 32].\nMaterials And Methods\nParticipants Participants included 743 individuals seeking bariatric surgery in Rhode Island for whom complete data was available on self-report measures of depression severity, mindfulness facets, and emotional overeating. Data was collected from July 2004 through October 2009. The majority of participants were White, female, married, and had graduated high school (Table\u00a01). Average BMI for this sample was 47.4 and ranged from 45.9 to 63.2, indicating that all of the participants were classi ed as obese based on criteria from the National Institutes of Health [34].\nPage 5/16\nTable 1 Demographic Characteristics of Bariatric Surgery Candidates\nVariable N = 743\nSex, % (n)\nFemale\nMale\n80.6 (599)\n19.4 (144)\nRace, % (n)\nWhite\nAfrican American or Black\nAsian\nPortuguese\nNative Hawaiian/Other Paci c Islander\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native\nOther\n79.5 (591)\n8.1 (60)\n0.3 (2)\n2.0 (15)\n0.1 (1)\n0.4 (3)\n1.3 (10)\nEducation, % (n)\nLess than high school\nHigh school/equivalent\nCollege graduate or greater\n5.9 (44)\n57.7 (429)\n36.4 (270)\nEthnicity, % (n)\nHispanic/Latinx\nNon-Hispanic/Latinx\n8.2 (61)\n91.8 (682)\nMarital Status, % (n)\nMarried/Living as if married\nNever married\nSeparated/divorced\nWidowed\n64.3 (477)\n19.1 (142)\n14.9 (111)\n1.6 (12)\nAge, M (SD) 42.8 (11.5)\nProcedure Surgeons referred participants for a comprehensive pre-surgical psychiatric evaluation as part of the surgical clearance process. The evaluations were conducted at the outpatient psychiatry practice of\nPage 6/16\nRhode Island Hospital. The RIBS program is an integrated clinical-research program, in which evaluations are conducted as part of a clinical service to determine psychiatric clearance for bariatric surgery and informed consent is obtained to use the information from the evaluation for research purposes. Informed consent was obtained prior to administering the evaluation, and procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All research procedures were approved by the institutional review committee at Rhode Island Hospital. Details on the development of the RIBS study have been presented elsewhere [35]. Measures Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)[36]. The FFMQ is a self-report questionnaire composed of 39 items and consists of ve subscales assessing different facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, being nonjudgmental, and being nonreactive. Items are rated on a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The FFMQ has demonstrated reliability and validity [36], and each of the subscales in the current study showed good internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha ranging from 0.79 to 0.87).\nClinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale (CUDOS)[37]. The CUDOS is an 18-item self-report questionnaire of depression, tied to DSM-IV criteria. Items are rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (almost always true). The last two items assess interference of depression symptoms and quality of life; therefore, a total score is derived by summing the rst 16 items. The CUDOS has demonstrated excellent reliability and discriminant/convergent validity [37]. Internal consistency in the current sample also was excellent (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.89).\nEmotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ)[38]. The EOQ is 6-item self-report measure assessing the frequency of overeating in response to emotions such as anxiety, sadness, and anger. For each emotion, participants were asked, \u201cOn how many of the past 28 days have you eaten an unusually large amount of food given the circumstances in response to feelings of [emotion]?\u201d Each item is rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from no days, 1\u20135 days, 6\u201312 days, 13\u201315 days, 16\u201322 days, 23\u201327 days, and every day. The EOQ has demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It also has been shown to be signi cantly correlated with binge eating frequency, eating disorder features, and depressive symptomatology [38]. A total score was calculated by taking the average of the 6 items, with higher scores indicating more frequent emotional overeating. In the current study, internal consistency was good (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.70). Data Analyses Initial Pearson correlations were calculated between the EOQ, CUDOS, and FFMQ subscales. Next, separate mediation analyses were conducted for each FFMQ facet on the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating using a nonparametric bootstrapping approach via the Hayes PROCESS Macro 4.0 for SPSS version 25 [39]. The Preacher and Hayes [40] model was used to test the statistical signi cance of the cross product of the a and b coe cients (a*b), which equals the difference between the direct and indirect effects (c-c\u2019). This test has been recognized as the preferred test of cross-\nPage 7/16\nsectional mediation [37]. For each analysis, depression severity (CUDOS) was the predictor variable, emotional eating (EOQ) the outcome variable, and the mindfulness facet (FFMQ facet) the mediator variable. From the original dataset, 5,000 identically sized datasets were created by randomly drawing participants and replacing each value as it was sampled. Z-score based bias corrections were then used to derive con dence intervals for the 5,000 a*b values. Mediation is considered signi cant if the lower and upper bounds of these con dence intervals do not contain zero [42]. The nonparametric bootstrapping approach was chosen because it does not require any distributional assumptions, whereas the Sobel test assumes a normal distribution of the cross products which can negatively affect statistical power [41]. Therefore, the Sobel test is reported in the current study merely for comparison purposes.\nResults As shown in Table\u00a02, the CUDOS was signi cantly correlated with all of the other measures except the observing facet of the FFMQ. The EOQ was signi cantly correlated with all of the measures except the FFMQ describing and nonreacting facets. Of note, the signi cant correlation between the FFMQ observing facet and the EOQ was in the unexpected direction, suggesting that higher levels of observing were associated with higher levels of emotional eating.\nTable 2 Correlations Between Emotional Eating, Depression, and Mindfulness Facets\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\n(1) EOQ -- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(2) CUDOS 0.08* -- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(3) Observe 0.09* 0.04 -- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(4) Describe -0.04 \u2212 .29** 0.35** -- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(5) Aware -0.08* -0.49** 0.02 0.43** -- \u00a0 \u00a0\n(6) Nonjudge -0.11** -0.47** -0.14** 0.31** 0.56** -- \u00a0\n(7) Nonreact -0.02 -0.16** 0.41** 0.41** 0.16** 0.09* --\nNote.

In step 1 of the mediation model, the regression of depression severity on emotional eating, ignoring nonjudging, was signi cant (Coeff = 0.01, SE = 0.004, p = 0.02). In Step 2, the regression of depression severity on the mediator, nonjudging, was also signi cant (Coeff = -0.30, SE = 0.02, p < .001). Step 3 showed that the mediator (nonjudging) controlling for depression severity, was signi cantly associated with emotional eating (Coeff = -0.02, SE = 0.01, CI = -0.03 - -0.002, p = .03). Furthermore, Step 4 showed that when controlling for the mediator (nonjudging), depression severity was not signi cantly associated with emotional eating (Coeff = 0.005, SE = 0.005, p = 0.31). This model accounted for 50.5% of the variance (1- [c\u2019/c]*100). The Sobel test also indicated that the indirect effect between depression severity and emotional eating via nonjudging was signi cant (Coeff = 2.23, SE = 0.002, p = 0.03).\nGiven the cross-sectional nature of the data, we also tested reverse mediation. This analysis revealed that the regression of nonjudging on emotional eating, while ignoring depression severity (mediator), was signi cant (Coeff = -0.02, SE = 0.01, p = 0.002). The regression of nonjudging on depression severity (mediator), also was signi cant (Coeff = -0.72, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). Depression severity (mediator) was not signi cantly associated with emotional eating after controlling for nonjudging (Coeff = 0.004, SE = 0.005, CI = -0.005\u20130.014, p = 0.30), and nonjudging remained signi cantly associated with emotional eating even after controlling for depression severity (Coeff = -0.02, SE = 0.007, p = 0.03). The Sobel test also con rmed that depression severity did not signi cantly mediate the relationship between nonjudging and emotional eating (Coeff = -1.00, SE = 0.004, p = 0.32).\nDiscussion To our knowledge, this is the rst study to examine mindfulness facets as potential mediators of the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating in bariatric surgery candidates. Results indicated that only the nonjudging facet of mindfulness signi cantly mediated the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating, suggesting that it may be judgment towards thoughts and feelings, rather than the depression itself, that is associated with greater emotional eating. Based on prior studies (e.g., [16]) it was expected that other mindfulness facets would be signi cant mediators and acting with awareness would be the strongest mediator of the relationship between depression severity and emotional eating. Items on the nonjudging scale re ect criticism towards oneself for having thoughts and feelings and judging them as irrational, abnormal, or bad (and then items are reverse-scored such that higher scores re ect less self-criticism or judgment). Therefore, the content of the nonjudging items is highly consistent with the experiences of people with depressive symptoms and rumination, which may explain why this subscale in particular emerged as a signi cant mediator between depression and emotional eating.\nPrior studies have found that presurgical emotional eating was associated with poorer weight loss outcomes [2], including weight regain [3]. However, one study found the opposite, suggesting that presurgical emotional eating was associated with increased odds of weight loss success two years after\nPage 9/16\nsurgery [4]. The authors hypothesized that perhaps one reason for this nding was that through the process of acknowledging their emotional eating, patients may have been more willing to address this issue which then would be indicative of greater surgical success. It should be noted that in the Wedin et al. [4] study, history of emotional eating was assessed via a dichotomous variable (yes/no), whereas the present study assessed current emotional eating via a validated self-report questionnaire that assessed frequency of eating in response to various emotions. Therefore, continued research examining the impact of emotional eating on bariatric weight loss outcomes is warranted and should use validated measures of emotional eating. In addition, there is an increasing need to assess the impacts of emotional eating on longer-term surgical outcomes (> 2 years post-surgery) and examine potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between emotional eating and weight loss outcomes. For example, it would be useful to know if there are speci c factors that buffer the effects of emotional eating on surgical outcomes, such as mindfulness or emotion regulation skills.\nBased on the ndings from the present study, it is possible that fostering a nonjudgmental stance towards thoughts and feelings may be helpful in improving eating habits that would support greater postsurgical success. A recent meta-analysis of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for weight loss concluded that MBIs were related to signi cant weight loss and reduced problematic eating behaviors among overweight and obese individuals [43]. MBIs have demonstrated large effect sizes for improving eating behaviors and medium effect sizes for reducing anxiety and depression among overweight or obese adults [44], and they have signi cantly reduced emotional eating especially when combined with weight management or behavioral strategies [45, 46]. A pilot randomized controlled trial utilizing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which includes fostering mindfulness skills and acceptance towards di cult thoughts and feelings, found that ACT was associated with signi cant improvement in eating disordered behaviors, body dissatisfaction, quality of life, and acceptance towards weight-related thoughts and feelings compared to standard follow up by the surgical team in bariatric surgery patients [47]. A 1-day ACT workshop also signi cantly reduced emotional eating, with results maintained at a 3-month follow-up [48]. While some studies have found that mindfulness training did not result in signi cant weight loss (as measured by BMI) among overweight or obese individuals [49], overall the literature to date suggests that the relationship between mindfulness and weight loss is worthy of further investigation.\nThis study had several strengths. First, it included a large clinical sample of adults seeking bariatric surgery. Second, to our knowledge, this is the rst study to examine which speci c facets of mindfulness mediate the relationship between emotional eating and depression severity within bariatric surgery candidates. Third, this study utilized validated and well-established measures of mindfulness, emotional overeating, and depression. However, this study also had a number of limitations that should be noted. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this sample, a causal relationship between depression and emotional eating cannot be isolated because of the lack of the temporal component for formal mediation analyses. Although these constructs often are assessed in a static manner, the use of adaptive or maladaptive mindfulness strategies in the presence of discomfort often is a complex, dynamic, and contextual process [50, 51]. Therefore, future studies should continue to examine the impact of mindfulness on the\nPage 10/16\nrelationship between symptoms such as depression or anxiety and emotional eating in a more contextual fashion, via longitudinal and experimentally-based paradigms. Furthermore, the current study only addressed potential mediation with respect to depression symptoms; future studies should examine these relationships with other psychiatric symptoms that are common in this sample, including social anxiety [7, 52, 53] and posttraumatic stress [54\u201356]. In this way, it would be helpful to determine if there are transdiagnostic factors such as mindfulness and emotion regulation strategies underlying various types of psychological symptoms that play an important role in emotional eating, that could then be identi ed as potential targets for treatment to reduce emotional eating.\nThe sample consisted of primarily White females, therefore the results of this study may not generalize to a population with different demographic characteristics. Future research should include a more diverse sample in terms of age, ethnicity, and gender to continue to examine these relationships. Because participants were individuals seeking bariatric surgery, results may not generalize to individuals who are not seeking treatment for obesity or who are seeking a different type of weight loss treatment. In addition, participants were undergoing the evaluation to obtain psychiatric clearance for bariatric surgery, and it is possible that symptoms may have been underreported for fear that endorsing these symptoms or emotional eating would result in psychiatric non-clearance. Indeed, mean levels of depression as reported on the CUDOS were within the \u201cminimal\u201d range. Therefore, future research should continue to examine these relationships in ways that will lower demand characteristics, such as conducting research-only evaluations that are completely separate from the clinical process of psychiatric pre-surgical clearance.\nFuture research should continue exploring the mediation effects of mindfulness on the relationship between depression and emotional eating, to further identify important targets for treatment. Such studies could also focus on exploring the relationship between different types of emotional eating, such as eating in response to different negative (anxiety, anger, depression) and positive (happiness) emotions [20]. Although some preliminary evidence suggests the potential e cacy of MBIs in addressing weight loss and emotional eating, additional studies are needed to examine the long-term effects of changes in mindfulness on emotional eating and weight loss outcomes, and how baseline levels of these variables may moderate long-term outcomes. Future research also should examine whether variables other than mindfulness (e.g., emotion regulation) mediate the relationship between depression and emotional eating, as prior studies suggest that emotion regulation skills may be important treatment targets for emotional eating as well [25, 57].\nStrengths and Limits:\nStrengths included use of a large sample of adults seeking bariatric surgery, examination of speci c facets of mindfulness as potential mediators within bariatric surgery candidates, and utilization of validated and well-established measures of mindfulness, emotional overeating, and depression. Limits included a cross-sectional and primarily White and female sample.\nDeclarations\nPage 11/16\nFunding: The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have no relevant nancial or non- nancial interests to disclose.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
