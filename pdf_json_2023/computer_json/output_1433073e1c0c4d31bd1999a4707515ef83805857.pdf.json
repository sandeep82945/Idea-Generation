            "text": "WeChat is the most popular instant messaging tool in China[1].The rapid expansion of technology and the increasing possibilities it offers are inextricably linked to concerns about the possible consequences of barriers to the adoption of new technologies[2]. In the 21st century, population ageing has become a global trend[3]. Although China has entered the population ageing, the older adult consumer group has not received enough attention. Social governance of the aged is of great significance to social development. Therefore, the mental health of the older adult should be promoted so that they can live a peaceful and happy life in their later years[4].\nAs people age, older people may experience more social exclusion[5]\uff0cbecause retirement can lead to dramatic changes in later life, and older people begin to disengage from society. Recently, older adults have shown a special enthusiasm for adopting social media in daily life. Social media enable older adult people to connect with a larger network of contacts to observe friends and family members\u2019 status updates, and to express themselves to others online, which may play a role in promoting happiness in old age. So it's worth investigating how social media has changed the lives of these people (Rui, Yu, Xu, & Cui, 2018)."

In the questionnaire collection, most of the older people we met couldn't see the paper questionnaire we provided because of their health, so we would ask the older people in the form of a question and answer, and fill in the data directly into the questionnaire star."

(2) Social gratification and self-esteem gratification have a significant effect on subjective well-being. (3) Social isolation will moderate the effects of older adult\u2019 s moment sharing behavior on their perceived hedonic gratification, social gratification, as well as self-esteem gratification. (4) Social isolation doesn\u2019t moderate the effects of older adults\u2019 moment sharing\nbehavior on subjective well-being. Education background, age and other control variables have no effect on the subjective well-being of the older adult. (5) Adult\u2019s moment sharing behavior do not affect subjective well-being through hedonic gratification, while it can affect subjective well-being through social gratification and self-esteem gratification."

Enterprises should pay attention to the needs of the older adult, according to demand to produce satisfactory products, to get more older adult users. Enterprises should pay attention to the aging of the products when making social software, and add a function that can satisfy the self-display of the old people in the software, so that the old people get more attention, to enhance the subjective well-being of the older adult. In addition, this study was limited to the older adult in Nanjing, and the empirical results may be limited."
