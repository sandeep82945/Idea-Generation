Interlayer tunneling11 and Coulomb interactions12 offer an additional degree of freedom for modulating the electrical properties of multilayers.13 However, the experimental investigation of cross-plane charge transport through well-dened multilayer 2D materials remains challenging due to the difficulties in achieving atomically precise control.

Such anchor groups can signicantly affect transport through the parent molecular core. In contrast, by utilizing noncovalent interactions to bridge between two graphene electrodes, the cross-plane break junction technique (XPBJ) can access the intrinsic properties of molecules without adding anchor groups.22,23 This technique takes advantage of the p\u2013p orbital overlap between graphene electrodes and planar molecules, which can form a cross-plane transport channel for electrons passing between the graphene electrodes.\nHerein, we investigate charge transport through molecular bilayer-graphene (MBLG) junctions using the XPBJ technique with graphene electrodes at room temperature. We nd that a single MBLG can couple to the two graphene electrodes via vdW interactions, and that the resulting electrical conductances increase with the atomic number of MBLG.

Our study demonstrates the direct measurement of through-space charge transport in p-stacked assemblies and using a new type of sub-nano device based on molecular vdW stacks.\nThree well-dened MBLGs, denoted as MBLG-C96, MBLGC108, and MBLG-C114 [(C96H24R6)2, (C108H24R6)2, and (C114H24R6)2, R \u00bc mesityl], were synthesized,24,25 whose molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1a. Compared with MBLGC114, MBLG-C108 contains a cavity defect at its centre, and the stable bilayer structure is obtained by two vertically stacked graphene nanoakes via p\u2013p stacking interaction. Their peripheral mesityl groups were introduced to tune the aggregation behavior.24,25 The graphene-based single-molecule junctions based on MBLGs are constructed with our home-built XPBJ setup (Fig. 1b), which is modied from the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM-BJ) setup for the gold electrode. The gold tip and gold substrate are replaced by O-ring shaped copper wire and copper foil coated with singlelayer graphene respectively. The liquid cell alleviates solvent volatilization, and helps to retain copper foil atness. Nanogaps with different sizes between the two graphene electrodes are formed by moving the tip up and down repeatedly. The target molecule without anchoring groups can be trapped at the appropriate nanogap size and couple weakly to the two graphene electrodes via vdW interactions.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the 1D conductance histograms of the three MBLGs show obvious peaks, indicating the successful fabrication of single-MBLG junctions in the mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/ decane (1/4, v/v). The most probable conductances of singlemolecule junctions formed from MBLG-C96, MBLG-C108, and MBLG-C114 are 10 5.32 G0 ( 0.37 nS), 10 5.02 G0 ( 0.74 nS), and 10 4.65 G0 ( 1.74 nS), respectively. Among the three MBLGs, the measured conductance of molecular junctions for MBLG-C96 is the lowest, because MBLG-C96 with the smallest size bridges the two graphene electrodes, which is consistent with our previous research.22 MBLG-C114 with the largest number of benzene rings shows the highest p electron overlap, the measured conductance of which is about 370% higher than that of MBLG-C96. In contrast with MBLG-C114, the structure ofMBLG-C108 possesses a cavity defect at the centre, leading to the decrease of interlayer p-electron coupling. As a result, the conductance of MBLG-C108 is 50% lower than that of single-molecule junctions of MBLG-C114. The onedimensional (1D) conductance histogram and 2D conductance\u2013distance histogram of mixed solvent (THF/decane) show no distinct peak and plateau (Fig. S15\u2020). Therefore, we can conclude from the above that the conductance of molecules with similar structures increases with increasing intermolecular p-electron coupling. As in our previous study, we found that the conductance of single-fullerene junctions decreases when the intramolecular p conjugation of the fullerene molecule is interrupted.26\nChem.

View Article Online\nThe inset of Fig. 2a shows typical individual traces of three MBLGs with a notable plateau. To further demonstrate the conductance differences, 2D conductance\u2013distance histograms of MBLG-C96, MBLG-C108, and MBLG-C114 are shown in Fig. 2b\u2013d, respectively. It can be seen that all the 2D conductance\u2013distance histograms possess highly distinct intensity clouds, indicating the formation of well-dened single-molecule junctions of MBLGs. The plateau lengths of molecular junctions for MBLG-C96, MBLG-C108, and MBLGC114 are statistically analyzed to be 1.47 nm, 1.37 nm, and 1.48 nm, which are obviously shorter than the diameter of the carbon skeleton of these MBLGs, suggesting that charge transport takes place in a cross-plane direction. The plateau length of single-MBLG junctions is longer than that of molecular junctions based on PAHs, which only have a singleatom thickness.22 This is consistent with a junction structure composed of a stacked bilayer graphene nanoake and two graphene electrodes.\nTo further investigate the inuence of the layer number of molecular graphene on charge transport through molecular junctions, C96H24R9 (MSLG-C96, R \u00bc mesityl) shown in Fig. 3a was synthesized, in which mesityl groups are graed to the periphery of the graphene nanoake to hinder the interlayer stacking. Mass and NMR spectroscopy clearly demonstrated that C96H24R9 adopts a single-layer structure without interlayer stacking in C2D2Cl4 (see Fig. S12 and S13 in the ESI\u2020), and therefore C96H24R9 can be regarded as molecular single-layer graphene (MSLG). The conductance of single-molecule junctions for MSLG-C96 is measured in the mixed solvent of THF/ decane, in which two kinds of typical individual conductance\u2013 distance traces with high conductance (HC) and low conductance (LC) appear (Fig. 3b). The most probable conductances of HC and LC are determined to be 10 4.48 G0 ( 2.56 nS) and 10 5.41 G0 ( 0.32 nS) from the corresponding 1D histogram (Fig. 3c). In the corresponding 2D histogram of MSLG-C96 in THF/decane (Fig. 3d), it can be found that the plateau length of molecular junctions for MSLG-C96 with HC ( 1.06 nm) is shorter than that of LC ( 1.44 nm). The conductance value and plateau length of LC are consistent with those of MBLG-C96 in THF/decane, indicating that the dimer of MSLG-C96 may be formed in THF/decane. The conductance curves of HC and LC show uncorrelated relation veried in the 2D cross-correlation histogram shown in Fig. S25,\u2020 which indicated that the appearance of each conductance state is independent during the XPBJ process. To validate the formation of the dimer, C2H2Cl4 is mixed with the nonpolar solvent CCl4 (1/9, v/v) as the solvent to avoidMSLG-C96 aggregation. As shown in Fig. 3e, the conductance of molecular junctions for MSLG-C96 is 10 4.49 G0 ( 2.51 nS), which is very close to its HC in THF/decane as shown in the green frame in Fig. 3c and e, suggesting that the measured LC of MBLGs could be attributed to their stacked structures in the experiment. In our previous work, it was shown that increasing the number of benzene rings in planar PAHs, enhances the coupling strength between the graphene electrode and molecules and increases the conductance of their molecular junctions.22 However, the conductance of MSLG-C96 with 34 benzene rings is much lower than that of anthanthrene with\n5856 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 5854\u20135859\n6 benzene rings. Our DFT calculations (below) suggest that this is due to the steric hindrance of the peripheral mesityl groups that enlarges the distance between the plane of MSLG-C96 and the graphene electrodes. The 2D conductance\u2013distance histogram also presents a clear molecular plateau (Fig. 3f), with a plateau length of 1.07 nm. The consistent conductance value and plateau length of MSLG-C96 in C2H2Cl4/CCl4 and its HC in THF/decane suggest that the HC in THF/decane is the intrinsic conductance of MSLG-C96. The plateau length difference between MSLG-C96 and MBLG-C96 is 0.40 nm, which matches well with the interlayer distance ( 0.35 nm) of MBLGs revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction,24 suggesting the cross-plane charge transport through the MSLG-C96 and the dimers.

View Article Online\nthe four nanographene molecules during stretching are calculated and shown in Fig. S24.\u2020 The distribution of conductance variations of MSLG-C96 is much wider than that of the other three bilayer graphene molecules, indicating that the interfacial change between molecules and electrodes dominates during the pulling process.\nTo elucidate the charge transport properties of molecular junctions for MBLG and MSLG observed in the experiment, we calculated the transport properties of MBLG-C96, MBLG-C108, MBLG-C114, and MSLG-C96 using the ab initio density functional theory package SIESTA27 and the quantum transport code GOLLUM.28 Fig. 4a and b show the graphene sheets, which form the electrodes in the calculations. The electrons are injected from leads 1 and 2, and collected by leads 3 and 4. Each graphene sheet is extended to innity in the z-direction, while in the y-direction, periodic boundary conditions are used. The MBLGs and MSLG-C96 are placed between the two graphene sheets and their electrical properties are calculated (for details see the ESI\u2020). Fig. 4c shows the average transmission of MBLGC96, MBLG-C108, MBLG-C96, and MSLG-C96 (see Fig. S28\u2013 S32\u2020). Among the three MBLGs, MBLG-C114 has the highest transmission coefficient, originating from the smallest HOMO\u2013 LUMO gap and the largest molecular area. MBLG-C108 possesses a higher transmission compared to MBLG-C96, due to a stronger coupling with electrodes (indicated by wider HOMO and LUMO transmission resonances) even though the former has a larger HOMO\u2013LUMO gap than the latter (Table\nFig. 4 Theoretical simulations for molecular graphene. Sandwiched structures of the molecular junction based on MBLG-C114 (a) and MSLG-C96 (b). (c) The average transmission function of MBLG-C96 (salmon curve), MBLG-C108 (purple curve), MBLG-C114 (orange curve), and MSLG-C96 (blue curve) as a function of the Fermi energy EF, estimated by density functional theory (DFT). The average transmission function is obtained from those of different contact geometries (see Fig. S26\u2013S32\u2020 for details). Fermi energy EF is shown by the gray vertical dashed line, which is predicted by DFT.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nS3\u2020). To understand how the molecules are sandwiched and interact with graphene sheets in the experiment, we calculated the transmission functions for geometries in which the angles between the graphene ake and the side groups are around 90 for those MBLGs. The molecular geometries ofMBLG-C108 and MBLG-C96 are obtained from the crystal data. The results show low conductance (10 10 to 10 9 G0) between the two graphene sheets (Fig. S28\u2020) compared to the experimental values (10 5 to 10 4 G0) (Fig. 2a and 3e). Consequently, it is estimated that the angles between the side mesityl groups and the graphene ake of MBLGs would be smaller than those from the crystal congurations. To demonstrate this feature, we manually rotate the angle of the side groups to 30 and 10 . It is found (Fig. S29\u2013 S32\u2020) that the transmission probabilities increase when the angles between the core and the mesityl groups decrease. In other words, the rotation angles of the mesityl groups tune the charge transport between the two graphene sheets. In detail, a higher transmission probability of 10 6 to 10 4 G0 was obtained at an angle of 10 while the junctions of 30 show relatively lower transmission functions, which appear in the range of 10 7 to 10 6 G0 (Fig. S29\u2020). Considering the dynamic conguration evolution in the pulling process, the average transmission functions are obtained over the 18 molecular junctions with the side groups rotated to 30 and 10 which are represented by the thicker black solid lines (Fig. S29\u2020) and all the colored lines shown in Fig. 4. The higher transmission functions of 10 geometries make the majority contributions to the average ones where the distance between the bottom graphene sheet and the lower ake of MBLGs is 4.3 A\u030a (see Fig. S28 of the ESI\u2020 for details).\nTo demonstrate the effect of the side mesityl groups, the side groups of the monomer were articially rotated to 20 , 30 , 35 , and 40 . It is found that a side group angle of 40 relative to the plane of MSLG-C96 gives the closest agreement with the experimental conductance. This corresponds to a distance between the bottom graphene sheet and MSLG of 4.7 A\u030a (see Fig. S30\u2020). The distance between the two graphene sheets calculated from 4.7 A\u030a 2 matches with the separation in the experiment 1.07 A\u030a. To further illustrate our results, many different congurations (Fig. S26\u2020) between the graphene sheets andMSLG-C96 are also considered (see Fig. S30 and S31\u2020 for further details). These results demonstrate that the rotation angle of the peripheral mesityl groups could be dramatically different from those in the crystal structure and that charge transport through the molecular junctions of MBLGs and MSLG-C96 is sensitive to the angles between the graphene ake and peripheral mesityl groups. It is also interesting to note that the mesityl groups can also mediate electron transport. This is demonstrated in Fig S32,\u2020 where it is shown that by articially removing the mesityl groups, whilst maintaining the spacing between the graphene electrodes, the electrical conductance is reduced. Finally, it is demonstrated that the large area of the molecule and a smaller HOMO\u2013LUMO gap improve the crossplane conductance of the molecular junctions, which is consistent with the conclusion of our previous studies on PAHs.22\nChem.

            "text": "To conclude, single-molecule vdW heterojunctions based on molecular graphene were fabricated by employing the XPBJ technique. The electrical conductance of molecular junctions based on MBLG-C114 is larger than those of the smaller molecules MBLG-C96 and MBLG-C108, suggesting that the size of MBLG could be used to tune charge transport through vdW heterojunctions. It was found that the molecular junctions based on single-layer molecular graphene are more conductive than double-layer molecular graphene junctions and furthermore, the tunneling distances between MBLG-C96 and MSLGC96 match the interlayer distance, which is consistent with cross-plane charge transport. DFT calculations demonstrate that the angle between the core of molecular graphene and peripheral mesityl groups has a signicant effect on the charge transport through single-molecule graphene junctions, and the attening of the mesityl groups leads to higher electrical conductance. This work provides new insight into cross-plane transport and interactions in vdW heterojunctions, and highlights new strategies for designing and fabricating electronic devices based on molecular vdW assemblies."

Therefore, the conductance traces in 2D histograms are aligned on the x axis (DZ) as the zero point when the conductance value is 10 3 G0."

The cutoff energy was 200 Rydberg, and the force tolerance was 0.02 eV A\u030a 1. To compute their electrical conductance, the MBLGs and MSLG were placed between two graphene electrodes. For each structure, the transmission coefficients T(E) were calculated using the Gollum quantum transport code,28 which uses the DFT mean-eld Hamiltonian and overlap matrices from SIESTA27 and T(E) is computed using the following formula\n5858 | Chem.
