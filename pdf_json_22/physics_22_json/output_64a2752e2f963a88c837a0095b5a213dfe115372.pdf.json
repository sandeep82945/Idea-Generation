    "abstractText": "Statistically thinned array antennas are usually employed to form single-beam radiation patterns. In this work, the possibility to adopt such type of antennas to obtain multiple-beam patterns is successfully explored. In particular, two schemes are proposed and compared. In the first one, multiplebeam patterns are realized by considering each beam corresponding to a different feeding network. In the second scheme, multiple-beam behavior is achieved by a single feeding network. A key question addressed in this manuscript is given by the analysis of the statistical deviation of the synthesized radiation pattern, as compared to the reference one. To this end, the up-crossing method is employed. In particular, the assumption of symmetric thinned arrays leads to analytical results, but avoids the adoption of the simplified hypothesis which usually give inaccuracy. The proposed approach is verified by a Monte Carlo analysis, and shows very good agreement between empirical data and theoretical predictions.

INTRODUCTION\nSTATISTICALLY thinned arrays give a type of randomarray obtained by removing/turning off some elements from the so-called reference filled array, according to a probabilistic law which depends on the amplitude taper of the original reference array [1]- [4]. This type of array is appealing, as it requires a reduced number of elements (with respect to the reference array) to achieve the same resolution, with the peak side-lobe level mainly influenced by the residual elements after thinning operation. Moreover, no amplitude-tapering is needed, so that T/R modules can be used in their optimised configuration [1] [5]. Thinned arrays can be usefully adopted in a variety of applications, including satellite communications, radio-astronomy, groundbased high frequency radars, and interference cancellation by adaptive beam-forming. They can be generally adopted in all applications primarily requiring high resolution and low secondary lobes, rather than high gain [6]- [8]. They could be also exploited in the framework of mm-waves\ncommunications [9]- [11].\nThinning operation can be typically realized by the adoption of specific optimisation procedures [12]- [18]. In spite of better performance, these approaches generally entail a high computational cost, which can become cumbersome for large antenna arrays [8].\nIn this paper, statistically thinned arrays (STA) are considered. They are treated in terms of excitation coefficients typically given by binomial random variables. Other schemes assuming different levels for excitations have been also proposed in the literature [19]. Even if they provide a better approximation for the desired array factor, a more complicated feeding network is however required by this latter strategy.\nThe array factor of STA is a stochastic process which needs to be characterised by resorting to the probability theory. A statistical characterization is relatively easier in the presence of a high number of antenna elements, when the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) can be applied [3]. This is just the case where the reduction in the number of elements is\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

An accurate statistical characterization of a thinned array is generally difficult to obtain. Nonetheless, an a priori estimation of the array pattern (such as in terms of the peak side-lobe level) as a function of the array features and the thinning level, is highly desirable. To satisfy this need, several results have been produced over the years in literature, starting from the papers [1] and [3]. Recently, in [20], more accurate results have been presented for the case of symmetric thinned arrays. In particular, the up-crossing method has been used, but avoiding simplified assumptions which degrade the accuracy.\nStatistically thinned arrays are generally adopted for single-beam applications, with possible linear phase excitation if a beam steering feature is required. However, many practical cases exist which impose the presence of simultaneous multiple beams [6]. Therefore, in this contribution, STA is applied to realize multiple-beam patterns. Two schemes are proposed. In the first one, each beam is associated to a different feeding network; hence, simultaneous independent beams can be obtained. The second scheme relies on a single feeding network, so the beams are no longer independent. In both cases, the approach developed in [20] is adopted to estimate the achievable performance in terms of two parameters, namely the array factor variance and the \"distance\" error between the statistical array factor and the reference one. The former is a local measure of the array factor dispersion around the reference array; the latter provides a \"global\" metric. In particular, by assuming symmetric STA, the mentioned performance parameters are obtained analytically, even if they account for the non-stationarity of the array factor, often neglected in other studies. Monte Carlo analysis is applied to successfully validate the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we are dealing with the array factor only and no mutual coupling is assumed between antenna elements [21]. In any case, since thinned arrays are usually obtained from periodic lattices, they still allow a more adequate control of mutual coupling than aperiodic arrays. [4].\nThe work is organised as follows. Section II contains the fundamental concepts on single-beam statistically thinned arrays. In Section III, the two thinning schemes for multiplebeam array factors are outlined, while in section IV they are tested and validated by numerical analysis. Conclusions and potential future developments are finally reported. In addition, the paper includes an appendix section to support the theoretical derivations.\nII. SYMMETRIC STATISTICALLY THINNED ARRAYS For the sake of argument, we briefly report some basic concepts regarding statistically thinned arrays. Let us consider a linear array of N isotropic radiators arranged along the x axis within the segment [\u2212L/2, L/2], L being the array aperture in terms of wavelength (refer to Fig. 1). N is assumed to be even, and the elements are half-wavelength spaced at xn = \u2212x\u2212n = 0.25 + (n \u2212 1)0.5, with n = [1, 2, ..., N/2] (i.e., there is no element in the position x = 0). Moreover, the amplitude coefficients are chosen so that A\u2212n = An.\nThe corresponding array factor can be written as\nFref (u) = 2 N/2\u2211 n=1 An cos[2\u03c0xn(u\u2212 u0)] (1)\nwhere u = cos \u03b8 and u0 = cos \u03b80, with \u03b8 and \u03b80 being the observation and the steering angles, respectively. Accordingly, the visible space is given by the interval [\u22121, 1]. Fref (u) is the so-called reference filled array factor, to be approximated by the thinned array.\nHerein, we address the case of symmetric thinned arrays, which are obtained by thinning only half the array, and then, for each remaining element, by locating further elements in the position \u2212xn. The corresponding thinned array factor is given by [20]\nF (u) = 2C N/2\u2211 n=1 Fn cos[2\u03c0xn(u\u2212 u0)] (2)\nwhere {Fn}N/2n=1 are independent Bernoulli random variables. In particular, Pr{Fn = 1} = 1 \u2212 Pr{Fn = 0} = Fn = pn (Pr{\u00b7} is a probability measure, while the term Fn represents the mean of Fn). Also, 0 \u2264 pn = \u03b1An/maxn{An} \u2264 1, with 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1 being the thinning factor. Indeed, for \u03b1 = 1, natural thinning is obtained. C = maxn{An}/\u03b1. Note that, since an uniform arrangement has been considered, F (u) is a periodic function.\nSince the {Fn}N/2n=1 are random variables, F (u) is a stochastic process whose mean and variance are respectively given as [20]\n\u00b5(u) = Fref(u) (3)\n\u03c32(u) = P (u)\u2212 F 2ref (u)\n= 4 N/2\u2211 n=1 ( max{An}An/\u03b1\u2212A2n ) cos2[2\u03c0xn(u\u2212 u0)]\n(4)\nwhere P (u) = F 2(u) is the power-pattern of the (symmetric) thinned array, and P (u) gives its mean."

Furthermore, since F (u) is periodic, \u00b5(u) and \u03c3(u) are periodic as well [20]. Under these conditions, the cumulative distribution function (cdf ) of the array factor magnitude (and consequently of the power-pattern) is easily found to be expressed as [20] [23] [24]\nP {F (u) \u2264 \u03be} = Q [ \u2212\u03be + \u00b5S(u)\n\u03c3S(u)\n] \u2212Q [ \u03be \u2212 \u00b5S(u) \u03c3S(u) ] (5)\nin which Q(x) = (1/ \u221a 2\u03c0) \u222b\u221e x e\u2212x 2/2 dx [25]. It can be shown that eq. (5) can be written in a closed-form [23], by exploiting the condition that for positive arguments the Qfunction can be written in a closed-form with very small errors [25].\nThe number of active elements Nt = 2 \u2211N/2\nn=1 Fn is a Gaussian random variable as well, with mean and variance equal to (\u03b1/max{An})\u00b5(0) and (\u03b1/max{An})2\u03c32(0), respectively [20].\nIt must be remarked that the above simple results are achieved due to the assumption of symmetric configurations. For general asymmetric arrays, the distribution of the array factor magnitude can be expressed in terms of a generalised non-central chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom [26]. In this case, no closed-form can be obtained. Anyway, symmetric and asymmetric thinned arrays return the same mean array factor and the average of Nt. Furthermore, the difference in the achievable performance are not so relevant, as shown in [20].\nIII. MULTI-BEAMS STATISTICALLY THINNED ARRAYS In this section, two schemes for obtaining a thinned array factor consisting of multiple beams are introduced. Basically, they are obtained by adapting the general statistical thinning approach outlined in the previous section. For convenience, such schemes are addressed in the sequel as scheme 1 and scheme 2.\nThe starting point is the definition of the multiple-beam reference array factor\nFrefM(u) = N/2\u2211 n=\u2212N/2 AnBne 2j\u03c0xnu (6)\nwith Bn = \u2211M m=1 e \u22122j\u03c0xnum . It is seen that Fref (u) consists of M identical beams which are steered at the directions um. Since A\u2212n = An (and real) and B\u2212n = B\u2217n, it is useful to arrange (6) as\nFrefM(u) = 2 N/2\u2211 n=1 A\u0303ncos(2\u03c0xnu\u2212 \u03d5n) (7)\nwith A\u0303n = An|Bn| and \u2212\u03d5n = \u2220Bn, or equivalently as\nFrefM(u) = 2 N/2\u2211 n=1 An [an cos(2\u03c0xnu) + bn sin(2\u03c0xnu)]\n(8) with\nan = M\u2211 m=1 cos(2\u03c0xnum) (9)\nbn = M\u2211 m=1 sin(2\u03c0xnum) (10)"

This means that the actual excitation coefficients pertaining to the multiple-beam reference array factor have not been employed in defining the binomial random variables and that, simply, all the beams are thinned in the same way. This scheme, however, allows to obtain independent steerable beams, in the sense that each beam can correspond to a different chain of phase shifters and therefore to a different signal [27].

Therefore, by this thinning scheme, introducing additional beams does not change the distribution of the actual number of antenna elements that remains after the thinning.

SCHEME 2 In this case the multi-beam nature of the array factor is directly considered in thinning procedure. More in detail, the binomial random variables F\u0303n are now set according to the amplitude coefficients A\u0303n in (7), that is Pr{F\u0303n = 1} = F\u0303n = p\u0303n = \u03b1 A\u0303n/max{A\u0303n} = 1 \u2212 Pr{F\u0303n = 0}. The resulting thinned array factor hence writes as\nF\u0303M2(u) = 2C\u0303 N/2\u2211 n=1 F\u0303n cos(2\u03c0xnu\u2212 \u03d5n) (14)\nin which C\u0303 = max{A\u0303n}/\u03b1. This scheme can be obtained by feeding the antenna elements with a single chain of phase shifters, which provide the N phases {\u03d5n}. Therefore, while M \u00d7Nt phase shifters are needed for scheme 1, here, only N\u0303t = 2 \u2211N/2 n=1 F\u0303n phase shifters are required, with N\u0303t being still a Gaussian random variable with mean 2 \u2211N/2 n=1 p\u0303n and variance 4 \u2211N/2 n=1 p\u0303n(1\u2212 p\u0303n). Note that N\u0303t \u0338= Nt. What is more, for scheme 2 the average number of active radiators depends on the number of beams. Also scheme 2 allows to obtain multi-beam array factors without amplitude tapering, though the excitation coefficients are different from the ones pertaining to scheme 1. However, by this scheme, the beams are not independent.\nFM2(u) has again a Gaussian distribution with mean\n\u00b5M2(u) = FrefM(u) (15)\nand variance\n\u03c32M2(u) = PM2(u)\u2212 F 2 refM(u)\n= 4 N/2\u2211 n=1 An\n[ max{A\u0303n}\n\u03b1 \u2212 A\u0303n\n] cos2(2\u03c0xnu\u2212 \u03d5n) (16)\nC. GLOBAL CHARACTERISATION A rough array factor characterization, and hence a comparison between the two schemes, can be given in terms of the distribution of the array factor magnitude, which, as remarked above, is easy to obtain for the symmetric case. However, the mean and variance of the array factor provides only local information, i.e., for each different value of u. A global metric, instead, should be linked to the distance (in a probabilistic sense) between the actual and the reference array factors. To this end, as in [20], we consider the normalised standardised error, \u03f5(u) = [FMi(u) \u2212 FrefM(u)]/\u03c3Mi(u) (i = 1 for scheme 1 and i = 2 for scheme 2). In particular, performance is estimated in terms of \u03f5(u) magnitude supremum (with u implied)\nPr { S = max\nu\u2208[\u22121,1] {|\u03f5|} \u2264 \u03be\n} =\nPr { |FMi \u2212 FrefM | \u2264 \u03be \u03c3 a a Mi \u2200 u \u2208 [\u22121, 1] } (17)\nBy setting H = maxu\u2208[\u22121,1]{|FrefM(u)|}, (17) is equivalently recast as\nPr {S \u2264 \u03be} = Pr { |FMi \u2212 FrefM |\nH \u2264 \u03be \u03c3Mi H , \u2200 u \u2208 [\u22121, 1] } (18)\nEquation (17) gives a measure of the error over the whole visible space, including the beam regions. Indeed, Pr{S \u2264 \u03be} = p% entails that, with a probability of p%, \u03f5(u) lies between FrefM(u)\u2212 \u03be \u03c3Mi(u) and FrefM(u)+ \u03be \u03c3Mi(u), for each u. In this sense, FrefM(u)\u2212\u03be \u03c3Mi(u) and FrefM(u)+ \u03be \u03c3Mi(u) can be considered as generalised p-percent level curves [20].\nIt can be verified that the magnitude of the coefficient of variation [28], |CV (u)| = |\u03c3Mi(u)/\u00b5Mi(u)|, is relatively higher in the region of secondary lobes. Accordingly, it is expected that (18) is mainly contributed by the error in such a region, whereas FMi(u) \u2248 FrefM(u) in correspondence of the main beams.\nFinding a closed-form solution for the S-distribution is a very complicated problem. However, for the symmetric thinned arrays under concern, the up-crossing method can be conveniently employed and it has proved to work remarkably well [24].\nLet N\u03be be the number of times |\u03f5(u)| up-crosses (i.e., crosses with positive slope) the level \u03be. Accordingly, a first result is Pr{S \u2264 \u03be} = 1 \u2212 Pr{N\u03be \u2265 1} \u2265 1 \u2212 N\u03be (assuming that |\u03f5(u)| is below \u03be at u = \u22121), where the Markov inequality, Pr{N\u03be \u2265 1} \u2264 N\u03be has been exploited and N\u03be is the mean of the number of up-crossings. Hence, a lower bound for the S-distribution is obtained. However, if N\u03be is modeled as a Poisson random variable [30], the Sdistribution as can be analytically estimated as [24]\nPr{S \u2264 \u03be} \u2248 Pr{|\u03f5(\u22121)| \u2264 \u03be} e\u2212N\u03be (19)\nwhere Pr{|\u03f5(\u22121)| \u2264 \u03be} can be calculated from (5). Here, the final crucial issue is the computation of N \u03be. This can be achieved as follows [22]\nN\u03be = \u222b 1 \u22121 du \u222b \u221e 0 \u03b3 f|\u03f5||\u03f5|\u2032(\u03be, \u03b3;u) d\u03b3 (20)\nin which f|\u03f5||\u03f5|\u2032(\u03be, \u03b3;u) is the joint probability density function of |\u03f5(u)| and its first derivative. Since \u03f5(u) is a real stochastic process, it follows that the determination of the up-crossings of |\u03f5(u)| is equivalent to the simultaneous study of the up-crossings of \u03f5(u) and \u2212\u03f5(u). Moreover, since \u03f5(u) is a Gaussian process [3], then \u03f5(u) and its derivative \u03f5\u2032(u) = d\u03f5(u)/du are jointly Gaussian [22] (of course, the same holds true for \u2212\u03f5(u) and its derivative). Eventually, (20) can be written as (see [20] for details)"

Also, Pr{|\u03f5(\u22121)| \u2264 \u03be} can be calculated in an extremely simple way. The same does not hold true for asymmetric thinned arrays. In fact, in this case, to get tractable expressions, the real and imaginary part of \u03f5(u) and their derivatives are considered as being four independent stationary Gaussian processes, with the real and imaginary part of \u03f5(u) (resp. the real and imaginary part of \u03f5\u2032(u)) having the the same variance [31]. These are strong assumptions that generally lead to unreliable results [23]."

In particular, 2000 realisations are employed in the following examples.\nEach beam of the reference array factor is obtained by sampling a Taylor n-bar current distribution with n = 5 and side-lobe level equal to \u221225 dB [21]. Thus, the coefficients {An} are related to the samples of the corresponding current distribution [4]. Furthermore, as stated above, elemental radiators are half-wavelength spaced.\nIn order to check the behavior of statistically thinned arrays as the number of beams varies, we consider four reference array factors.

Although N may seem excessive for linear arrays, it is worth remarking that in the literature linear thinned arrays with elements till 2 \u00d7 104 [3] have been considered in order to study the properties of statistically thinned arrays.\nResults concerning case 1 are shown Fig. 2. In this natural thinning case the average number of active elements is equal to 70% of the maximum number N = 200. Fig. 2a shows the magnitudes (in dB) for the four reference array factors discussed above and the magnitudes of realisations of thinned array factors, all normalised with respect to their supremum. As can be seen, the side-lobes of |F (u)|/max{|F (u)|} increase with the number of beams. This trend was already observed for random aperiodic arrays [24] [29]. However, the main lobes of the actual and reference array factors are very similar. The above results are consistent with the variance behaviours reported in Fig. 2b. Indeed, as the number of beams increases, the variance levels become higher. This entails a greater dispersion around the actual reference array. Fig. 2c shows the comparison between the empirical and the theoretical S-distributions (obtained by exploiting eq.(19)).

The next two examples just allow to shed some light on this question.\nFor case 2 a more severe thinning is imposed so that the average number of radiators after the thinning is lower than in the previous case. Indeed, now the mean of Nt is equal to 100, whereas in the previous case it was 140. Results concerning this case are reported in Fig. 3. As expected, previous considerations still apply. However, now the side-lobe level is in general increased; this is consistent with the variance behaviours that are higher than the corresponding previous cases. This basically confirms that the actual number of elements plays a crucial role in controlling the dispersion of the array factor realisations, [1] [20] [23]- [26]. The point is that such a dispersion can be precisely estimated through the analytical S-distributions (see Fig. 3c).\nIn the last example (case 3), the maximum number of antenna elements is increased at N = 280, while the thinning is kept at 50%. This way, the mean of Nt is the same as case 1. Results are shown in Fig. 4. While the trend is of course the same as the previous cases, it is seen that the performance is in between the one of case 1 and 2 (see, for example, the variance behaviours in 4b). This entails that the achievable performance is not only affected by the average number of elements in the array (after the thinning), as it is often\nstated in the literature. However, our theoretical estimations of S-distributions works remarkably well and hence gives a general tool to foresee the performance by accounting for all the relevant problem parameters.\nAs a further validation, scheme 1 was also tested using CST Studio Suite. In particular, Fig. 5 shows the comparison between the CST return and the theoretical directivity, in the azimuth plane, of a linear array of cylindrical halfwavelength dipoles arranged parallel to the z axis of the orthogonal Cartesian system, while the array axis coincides with the x axis. Moreover, N = 200, \u03b1 = 1, M = 4, the operating frequency is 1GHz and the spacing between antenna elements is half a wavelength. As can be seen, an excellent matching is observed."

DISCUSSION From previous results, it can be noted that the S-distributions look nearly identical, regardless of the number of beams and the average number of retained elemental radiators. This, of course, does not mean that the distance between the statistically thinned array and the reference one is the same in all the cases. This is because S-distributions refer to standardised processes. Indeed, what they actually measure is the probability that the array factor is globally within a strip (around the reference one) that depends on the stan-\ndard deviation, \u03c3Mi(u), which in turn depends on the case under consideration. Also, as argued above, since the error is mainly related to the side-lobe regions, the S-distribution gives an estimation of the peak level of secondary lobes.\nStatistically thinned arrays are particularly suited for large antenna arrays which are populated by a high number of elements. In these cases, the statistical dispersion around the reference array factor can be made very low [3].

Looking at the table, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\u2022 For a given thinning factor, the variance decreases as the number of active elements increases; \u2022 For a given average number of active elements, natural thinning performs better (compare \u03c3\u0303M1 for the cases (200, 1) and (280, 5/7); \u2022 While for scheme 1 the expected value of the number of active elements is always the same (regardless of the number of beams), this is not the case for scheme 2; \u2022 With the same number of beams, N and \u03b1, scheme 1 is more efficient than scheme 2; \u2022 \u03c3\u0303Mi allows to roughly estimate the peak level of the secondary lobes.\nConcerning the last point, consider, for example, the case in Fig. 2. Here, the highest level of the secondary lobes, for the (200, 1)-two beams sub-case (of scheme 1), is about \u221215 dB.

In particular, the number of beams can be determined beforehand by checking if it is compatible with the desired performance.\n.\nAPPENDIX A For scheme 1, it is easy to prove that the mean of the derivative of the array factor, F \u2032M1(u) = dFM1(u)/du, is \u00b5F \u2032M1\n(u) = dFM1(u)/du = dFrefM(u)/du, while the variance is\n\u03c32F \u2032M1 (u) = [dFM1(u)/du] 2 \u2212 [dFrefM(u)/du] 2\n= 16\u03c02 N/2\u2211 n=1 {[ max{An} \u03b1 An \u2212A2n ] \u00d7 max{1} 1 aaa [xnbn cos(2\u03c0xnu)\u2212 xnan sin(2\u03c0xnu)]2 }\n(26)\nFor scheme 2, the mean of the derivative of the array factor, F \u2032M2(u) = dFM2(u)/du, is also equal to \u00b5F \u2032M2 (u) = dFrefM(u)/du and the variance is\n\u03c3F \u2032M2 (u) = [dFM2(u)/du]\n2 \u2212 [dFrefM(u)/du] 2\n= 16\u03c02 N/2\u2211 n=1\n[ max{A\u0303n}\n\u03b1 A\u0303n \u2212 A\u03032n\n] x2n sin 2(2\u03c0xnu\u2212 \u03d5n)\n(27)"
