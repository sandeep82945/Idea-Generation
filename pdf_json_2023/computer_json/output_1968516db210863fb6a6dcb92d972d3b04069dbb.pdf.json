    "abstractText": "Background A quantitative assessment of pulmonary edema is important because the clinical severity can range from mild impairment to life threatening. A quantitative surrogate measure, although invasive, for pulmonary edema is the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) extracted from the transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD). Severity of edema from chest X-rays, to date is based on the subjective classification of radiologists. In this work, we use machine learning to quantitatively predict the severity of pulmonary edema from chest radiography. Methods We retrospectively included 471 X-rays from 431 patients who underwent chest radiography and TPTD measurement within 24 h at our intensive care unit. The EVLWI extracted from the TPTD was used as a quantitative measure for pulmonary edema. We used a deep learning approach and binned the data into two, three, four and five classes increasing the resolution of the EVLWI prediction from the X-rays. Results The accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) in the binary classification models (EVLWI < 15, \u2265 15) were 0.93 (accuracy), 0.98 (AUROC) and 0.86(MCC). In the three multiclass models, the accuracy ranged between 0.90 and 0.95, the AUROC between 0.97 and 0.99 and the MCC between 0.86 and 0.92. Conclusion Deep learning can quantify pulmonary edema as measured by EVLWI with high accuracy.",

By impeding the gas exchange and reducing lung compliance, severe pulmonary edema is potentially life threatening [2]. Measuring and monitoring pulmonary edema is useful in many, but especially important in critically ill patients.\nTechnically, the attenuation of X-rays should be proportional to the amount of lung water, and thus, a chest radiograph should be a valuable tool in monitoring the amount of pulmonary edema. Commonly, radiologists rate the severity on a categorical scale.

Measurement of EVLW by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD), although invasive, shows good correlation with the gold standard ex\u00a0vivo method of gravimetry [3]. However, mixed results have been reported in the literature with the grade of correlation of clinicians\u2019 chest X-ray reports or clinicians\u2019 scores to extravascular lung water (EVLW), ranging from good [4, 5] over modest [6, 7] to poor [8, 9].\nRecently Horng et\u00a0al. used a radiologist-based categorical four grade severity score to train a deep learning classification system on chest radiographs and report a high performance [10]. To our knowledge, our present study is the first to explore the usefulness of deep learning in predicting the quantitative pulmonary edema measure EVLW from chest radiographs.\nAcquisition of\u00a0the\u00a0chest radiographs and\u00a0classification A total of 471 images from 431 patients were acquired between 06/2014 and 09/2022 on two Carestream Health DRX-Revolution X-ray machines (120\u00a0kV, 0.6 mAs). The images were extracted in the jpg format. We used the 374 images acquired between 06/2014 and 12/2020 as the training set and 97 images from 01/2021 to 09/2022 for the test set with no patient overlap. We included patients who underwent chest radiography and a TPTD measurement within a maximum of 24\u00a0 h. TPTD measurement was performed as previously reported [11, 12] and the extravascular lung water was indexed as previously reported (EVLWI, [6])."

            "text": "In this study, we sequentially developed a deep learning model that accurately quantifies pulmonary edema from chest X-ray images. We use the EVLWI measured invasively by TPTD [2] as ground truth. Our models show very good to excellent performances when binning the available data up to five classes for the clinically most relevant EVLWI range from 6 to 20.\nDeep learning has been used in the literature to classify various pathologies from chest radiographs. For example, Majkowska et\u00a0 al. use a machine learning approach to automatically detect four abnormal findings in X-ray images [17]. For the detection of airspace opacity, which includes pulmonary edema, an AUROC of 0.91 to 0.94 is reported. Jarrel et\u00a0al. use a deep learning approach to diagnose the presence of absence of congestive heart failure (CHF) from chest X-rays. The authors use a cutoff of 100\u00a0 ng/L BNP as a marker for CHF and find an AUROC of 0.82 [18]. Horng et\u00a0 al. not only diagnose the presence but also quantify lung edema with deep learning [10]. However, the authors use radiology reports as ground truth to categorize\ntraining/test data into 4 classes ranging from \u201c0: no edema\u201d to \u201c3: alveolar edema\u201d and an AUC of 0.88 in 2vs0 and only 0.69 in 2vs1.\nWe see our study as an expansion of these previous works. In our opinion, there are several strong points in our approach. Pulmonary edema presents as a continuous value. We could further increase the resolution of the classification in a clinically relevant range in comparison to Horng et\u00a0al.\u2019s.\nMore importantly, our study uses invasively measured EVLWI values as the ground truth instead of subjectively classified radiological estimations of pulmonary edema. While there generally is a good correlation between the gold standard of gravimetry and EVLWI [3] for measuring extravascular lung water, there are mixed results in the literature for correlating classical qualitative or semiquantitative radiological scores and EVLWI. Chrysopoulo et\u00a0 al. find a good correlation between a 5 scale severity score and EVLW [19]. Brown et\u00a0al. report a modest positive correlation of clinician-based chest X-ray severity score and EVLW [9]. Halperin et\u00a0 al. describe a\nmodest to poor correlation between a clinical edema score and an EVLW measurement [7].\nThere are also strong points from a conceptual view. While measuring lung water by TPTD needs a dedicated catheter and equipment, our method uses chest X-rays, which is a widely available tool. On the one hand, this could allow using EVLWI guided fluid therapy on intensive care units where TPTD is not available. On the other hand, this approach could enable access to EVLWI surrogate measurement for a much larger patient cohort. One could speculate for example guiding the diuretics dose by EVLWI in patients with heart failure.\nThere are limitations to our study too. While Jarrel et\u00a0 al. use 103,489 and Horng et\u00a0 al. 369,071 X-rays to test and train their models we could only use 471 images. This is due to the fact, that thermodilution is an invasive modality, feasible almost only in intensive care units. Furthermore, we tested our model only on a single institution\u2019s critically ill patients. Thus, our results need external confirmation, despite promising results of the above-mentioned studies and the prediction of\n\u2022 fast, convenient online submission\n\u2022 thorough peer review by experienced researchers in your field\n\u2022 rapid publication on acceptance\n\u2022 support for research data, including large and complex data types\n\u2022 gold Open Access which fosters wider collaboration and increased citations\nmaximum visibility for your research: over 100M website views per year \u2022\nAt BMC, research is always in progress.\nLearn more biomedcentral.com/submissions\nReady to submit your research ?

Therefore, model generalization may require not only external imaging data but also additional training with imaging data acquired on standard up right X-ray systems.\nDespite these limitations our study demonstrates, that deep learning is a useful tool for the quantification of pulmonary edema with a meaningful resolution with high accuracy."
