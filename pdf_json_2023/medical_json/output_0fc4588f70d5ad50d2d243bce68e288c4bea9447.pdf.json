    "abstractText": "Precocious puberty is a common developmental abnormality of the pediatric endocrine system and is characterized by the early appearance of puberty including attainment of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive capacity before 8 years of age in girls and before 9 years of age in boys (1). Precocious puberty can be subdivided into central precocious puberty (CPP) and peripheral precocious puberty (PPP) from the perspective of etiology, of which CPP is caused by the activation of the hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in advance and the release of excessive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and is mostly idiopathic (2). And idiopathic CPP is more common in girls than in boys. CPP can result in early epiphyseal closure because of the advancement of bone age in children, leading to decreased adult final height, as well as a series of psychological problems, including depression and anxiety (3). The medical therapy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) is widespread for the care of sex hormone-dependent diseases including CPP, and is the clinical gold-standard treatment for CPP (4, 5). Studies have shown that GnRHa treatment can effectively alleviate symptoms of precocity in children and improve final adult height (6, 7). However, the height of some children may not achieve the desired final height after GnRHa treatment, which was closely related to the inappropriate deceleration of growth (4, 8-10). Therefore, GnRHa and growth hormone (GH) combination therapy is usually used to promote bone growth and maturation in clinical practice, but the inconvenient application and high price of GH limited its use in patients (11). Moreover, GnRHa treatment may have a side effect on body mass index (12). And there was a gradual increase in obesity during GnRHa treatment (13, 14). The reason for weight gain may be related to the expression of the GnRH receptor on the surface of adipocytes, which promotes the proliferation of adipocytes and the accumulation of lipid droplets (15). Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore and discover new adjuvant therapy drugs for overcoming the growth deceleration and fat accumulation induced by GnRHa therapy in children with CPP. Indirubin-3\u2019-monoxime (I3O) is an analogue of indirubin which is an active ingredient of Danggui Longhui Wan, the traditional Chinese herbal mixture used for the anticancer treatment of chronic leukemia (16, 17). Recently, increasing studies revealed obesity in children as a high risk for central precocious puberty via inducing the premature activation of the HPG axis (18, 19). I3O was reported to restore bone loss and inhibit adipocyte differentiation in high-fat diet-induced obese mice (20, 21). During the process of sexual development, kisspeptin-1 (encoded by the KISS-1 gene) secreted by Kisspeptin neurons binds to the Indirubin-3\u2019-oxime promotes the efficacy of GnRHa in obese-induced central precocious puberty and maintains normal bone growth and body weight via the ERK-Sp1-KISS-1/ GPR54 axis",

            "text": "Precocious puberty is a common developmental abnormality of the pediatric endocrine system and is characterized by the early appearance of puberty including attainment of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive capacity before 8 years of age in girls and before 9 years of age in boys (1). Precocious puberty can be subdivided into central precocious puberty (CPP) and peripheral precocious puberty (PPP) from the perspective of etiology, of which CPP is caused by the activation of the hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in advance and the release of excessive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and is mostly idiopathic (2). And idiopathic CPP is more common in girls than in boys. CPP can result in early epiphyseal closure because of the advancement of bone age in children, leading to decreased adult final height, as well as a series of psychological problems, including depression and anxiety (3).\nThe medical therapy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) is widespread for the care of sex hormone-dependent diseases including CPP, and is the clinical gold-standard treatment for CPP (4, 5). Studies have shown that GnRHa treatment can effectively alleviate symptoms of precocity in children and improve final adult height (6, 7). However, the height of some children may not achieve the desired final height after GnRHa treatment,\nwhich was closely related to the inappropriate deceleration of growth (4, 8-10). Therefore, GnRHa and growth hormone (GH) combination therapy is usually used to promote bone growth and maturation in clinical practice, but the inconvenient application and high price of GH limited its use in patients (11). Moreover, GnRHa treatment may have a side effect on body mass index (12). And there was a gradual increase in obesity during GnRHa treatment (13, 14). The reason for weight gain may be related to the expression of the GnRH receptor on the surface of adipocytes, which promotes the proliferation of adipocytes and the accumulation of lipid droplets (15). Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to explore and discover new adjuvant therapy drugs for overcoming the growth deceleration and fat accumulation induced by GnRHa therapy in children with CPP.\nIndirubin-3\u2019-monoxime (I3O) is an analogue of indirubin which is an active ingredient of Danggui Longhui Wan, the traditional Chinese herbal mixture used for the anticancer treatment of chronic leukemia (16, 17). Recently, increasing studies revealed obesity in children as a high risk for central precocious puberty via inducing the premature activation of the HPG axis (18, 19). I3O was reported to restore bone loss and inhibit adipocyte differentiation in high-fat diet-induced obese mice (20, 21). During the process of sexual development, kisspeptin-1 (encoded by the KISS-1 gene) secreted by Kisspeptin neurons binds to the\nIndirubin-3\u2019-oxime promotes the efficacy of GnRHa in obese-induced central precocious puberty and maintains normal bone growth and body weight via the ERK-Sp1-KISS-1/\nGPR54 axis\nChunjie Jiang, Lu Qi, Jiang Xue, Yibiao Wang*\nChildren\u2019s Medical Center, Second Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250033, China\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\nKeywords:\nIndirubin-3\u2019-oxime, central precocious puberty, GnRHa, ERK, Sp1\nOriginal paper\nArticle history: Received: February 9, 2023 Accepted: April 20, 2023 Published: April 30, 2023\n* Corresponding author.

The application of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is widely useful for the medical therapy of CPP. This study aimed to investigate the combination effect and mechanism of indirubin-3\u2019-oxime (I3O), an active ingredient analogue of traditional Chinese medicine, and GnRHa treatment on the progression of CPP. First, female C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for the induction of precocious puberty and treated with GnRHa and I3O alone or in combination. Development of sexual maturation, bone growth and obesity were determined by vaginal opening detection, H&E staining and ELISA. The protein and mRNA expression levels of related genes were evaluated via western blotting, immunohistochemical method and RT-qPCR. Subsequently, tBHQ, an inhibitor of ERK, was applied to verify whether the mechanism of I3O was associated with this signaling. The results showed that the treatment of I3O alone or in combination with GnRHa could alleviate the HFDinduced earlier vaginal opening and serum levels of the gonadal hormone in mice. And, I3O could significantly eliminate the role of growth deceleration of GnRHa in bone development and reversed the side effect of GnRHa on body weight. More importantly, we found that I3O decreased the expression of KISS-1 and GPR54 by suppressing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Sp1 in the hypothalamus in mice. In summary, these data indicated that I3O could promote the efficacy of GnRHa in HFD-induced precocious puberty, and maintain bone growth and body weight in mice via the ERK-Sp1-KISS-1/GPR54 axis.\nDoi: http://dx.doi.org/10.14715/cmb/2023.69.4.29 Copyright: \u00a9 2023 by the C.M.B.

In recent years, I3O was reported to prevent neuronal apoptosis and inhibit the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting ERK signaling (24, 25). And ERK MAPK is required for the activation of Sp1 activity (26).\nTaken together, we intended to explore whether I3O in combination with GnRHa would further suppress precocious sexual maturation and whether I3O could play a role in bone growth and obesity during GnRHa treatment in this study. In addition, we also wondered whether the underlying mechanism involved is related to the ERKSp1-KISS-1/GPR54 axis."

Mice in HFD group were randomly divided into four groups: while modeling, seven mice in the HFD group were given saline intraperitoneally, labeled as the HFD + saline group; seven mice were given I3O (1 mg/kg, Med Chem Express, China) intraperitoneally once every two days, labeled as the HFD + I3O group; seven mice were given GnRHa (2.5 mg/kg) intramuscularly once a week, labeled as the HFD + GnRHa group; seven mice were given the combined treatment of GnRHa+I3O, labeled as the HFD+GnRHa+I3O group.\nDesign 2: To investigate the pharmacological mechanism of I3O in the treatment of central precocious puberty.\nDuring the process of a high-fat diet feeding, seven mice aged three weeks were pre-injected subcutaneously with t-Butylhydroquinone (50 mg/kg, tBHQ, ERK activator, Med Chem Express), followed by the intraperitoneal injection of I3O (1 mg/kg) once every two days, labeled as the HFD + tBHQ + I3O group. tBHQ alone injection for HFD mice was used as the positive control.\nAll mice were euthanized at 35 days, the day on which all mice reached puberty. The serum and the related tissues including the hypothalamus were collected for the subsequent experiments.\nObservation of the vaginal opening condition Mice were kept in place, and the vulva was exposed by lifting the tail. Observe the color of the mucous membrane,\nthe opening and the turgidity of the vulva. The vulva mucous membrane of the proestrus female mice is light red and slightly moist, vaginal opening is not open, slightly swollen around.

            "text": "Excessive estrogen secretion in children with central precocity affects bone growth and promotes obesity. Here, we explored the mechanism of I3O on GnRH release, which can explain the reason why I3O relieved the symptoms of central precocious puberty, and searched the mechanism of action of inhibiting the growth deceleration effect of GnRHa on bone growth and the side effect on obesity from the perspective of sex hormones. I3O treat-\nment was found to inhibit GnRH secretion in a mouse model of CPP induced by a high-fat diet, which may attribute to the attenuation of upstream signaling to some extent in GnRH neurons. Therefore, western blotting assay and RT-qPCR were carried out and the data revealed that I3O could inhibit the protein and mRNA level of Kisspeptin-1 and GPR54, which may be involved in its mechanism of action on sexual precocity development (Figure 4A, B). Studies have demonstrated that Sp1, as a transcription factor, is a key modulator of KISS-1 gene transcription (22, 23). And activation of the ERK pathway was necessary for the phosphorylation of Sp1 (26). Therefore, we speculated that I3O may regulate the phosphorylation of the ERK-Sp1 axis to affect the expression of kisspeptin-1 and GPR54 in the hypothalamus. Herein, Western blotting assay was performed to evaluate the changes of total and phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2 and Sp1 in the hypothalamus to verify the above speculation. And we found that I3O could inhibit the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 and Sp1, indicating and verifying that I3O could reduce the expression of the downstream gene KISS-1 by suppressing the phosphorylation level of the transcription factor Sp1, and this process may be mediated by inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK (Figure 4C). Next, to observe and verify that I3O suppressed the phosphorylation of Sp1 through reducing the activation of ERK, t-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, ERK activator) was injected subcutaneously 2 hours before I3O treatment in high-fat diet-induced mice for rescue experiment (Figure 4D). And we found that the suppressive effect of I3O treatment on protein and mRNA expression of GnRH, Kisspeptin-1 and GPR54 in serum and hypothalamus was all restored by tBHQ in HFD mice (Figure 4E-4H).\nTo measure and verify whether I3O played a role in CPP model mice, we monitored the vaginal opening time of mice, and we found that tBHQ treatment significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of I3O treatment on the vaginal opening time of HFD mice (Figure 4I). More importantly, I3O induced the decrease of body mass and the increased expression of MMP-13 and Col-X in growth plate tissues of high-fat diet-treated mice was inhibited by tBHQ, indicating that I3O could delay the process of sexual maturation and suppress increased body mass and promote bone\nFigure 2.

The above experimental data indicated that I3O could inhibit the phosphorylation of Sp1 and the transcription level of the downstream target gene KISS-1 by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, thus reducing the expression levels of Kisspeptin-1, its receptors GPR54 and GnRH, and relieving the central precocious puberty in mice induced by a high-fat diet."

            "text": "Puberty is a process in which adolescents acquire secondary sexual characteristics, accelerated physical growth and the development and maturation of the reproductive system (27). In the endocrine system, sex hormone is a kind of hormone that affects the growth and development of the human body and maintains sexual function. The secretion of sex hormones is regulated by HPG axis, and GnRH secreted by hypothalamic arcuate nucleus nerve cells combines with the receptors so that the pituitary gland is stimulated and periodically secrete gonadotropin, including LH and FSH, both of which promote the levels of sex hormones through acting on the gonads and affect the growth and development of mammary gland, adrenal cortex and bone (28). Central precocious puberty is caused\nby the premature activation of the HPG axis and the release of excessive GnRH. Several pieces of research have demonstrated that early puberty is often related to obesity, and obesity is a risk inducer for CPP (29, 30). Therefore, in this study, central precocious puberty model mice were established by the induction of a high-fat diet and verified by the increased serum levels of GnRH, LH and FSH, consistent with the results of previous studies (31).\nIn the clinic, GnRHa is widely used in the treatment of children with CPP. However, the effect of GnRHa on final height remains not necessarily well (8). Here, we explored and found the suppressive effect of I3O, the analogue of indirubin of Chinese traditional medicine, on the advanced vaginal opening time and increased gonadotropin levels in CPP mice induced by a high-fat diet for the first time. In high-fat diet-induced obese mice, I3O reversed bone loss and fat gain (20). In this study, we observed that I3O could promote the increase of growth plate width to enhance bone development and suppress the body mass in mice induced high-fat diet, this finding was consistent with the previous report (20). Additionally, GnRHa was found to result in the growth deceleration of bone development and promoted the body weight verified by the decreased growth plate width, the decreased expression of MMP-13, Col-X and Col-\u2161, the slightly increased body mass and weight of fat in each organ during treatment, but these effects could be inverted by I3O treatment in HFD mice.\nKisspeptin plays a centrally functional role in regulating the secretion of GnRH and peripheral factors, including adipokines, that affect puberty timing. The high-fat diet was reported to impair follicular development by regulating the kisspeptin/GPR54 axis expressed in ovarian of offspring (32). And accumulating shreds of evidence showed that KISS-1 gene (coded kisspeptin-1) expressed in kisspeptin neurons exerts the role by binding its receptor GPR54 expressed in GnRH neurons to stimulate the secretion of GnRH (33). Among them, the KISS-1 gene was regulated by Sp1, a transcription factor that was affected by the ERK pathway (22, 26). In this study, we revealed that I3O alleviated the sexual precocity induced by a high-fat diet in mice by inhibiting the ERK-Sp1-KISS-1/ GPR54 axis in the hypothalamus at the first time verified by the lessened expression of phosphor-ERK and phosphor-Sp1 under I3O treatment and the tBHQ-reversed the suppressive effect of I3O on the phosphorylation level of Sp1. However, in recent years, I3O was reported to activate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and impair adipocyte differentiation to maintain a healthy weight (21). It is well known that adipocyte differentiation plays an important role in the occurrence of obesity (34, 35). And it has been found that I3O stimulated chondrocyte maturation and longitudinal bone growth by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway (36). Based on these studies, we will explore and find the related mechanism of I3O treatment on body mass and bone growth from the perspective of adipocyte and chondrocyte of high-fat diet-induced mice in future work.\nIn conclusion, our study revealed that I3O could alleviate the symptoms of central precocious puberty induced by a high-fat diet and promote bone growth to increase final height, as well as reduce the side effects of GnRHa on weight gain. The mechanism of I3O involved the regulation of the ERK-Sp1-KISS-1/GPR54 axis in the hypothalamus. Our present research exerted a new understanding viewpoint on the drug therapy for obesity-induced central\nFigure 4.
