    "abstractText": "Herein, we present an innovative graphene oxide (GO)-induced strategy for synthesizing GO-based metal-organic-framework composites (Co-BTC@GO) for high-performance supercapacitors. 1,3,5-Benzene tricarboxylic acid (BTC) is used as an inexpensive organic ligand for the synthesis of composites. An optimal GO dosage was ascertained by the combined analysis of morphology characterization and electrochemical measurement. The 3D Co-BTC@GO composites display a microsphere morphology similar to that of Co-BTC, indicating the framework effect of Co-BTC on GO dispersion. The Co-BTC@GO composites own a stable interface between the electrolyte and electrodes, as well as a better charge transfer path than pristine GO and Co-BTC. A study was conducted to determine the synergistic effects and electrochemical behavior of GO content on Co-BTC. The highest energy storage performance was achieved for Co-BTC@GO 2 (GO dosage is 0.02 g). The maximum specific capacitance was 1144 F/g at 1 A/g, with an excellent rate capability. After 2000 cycles, CoBTC@GO 2 maintains outstanding life stability of 88.1%. It is expected that this material will throw light on the development of supercapacitor electrodes that hold good electrochemical properties.",

            "text": "Supercapacitors have attracted a lot of attention as a pollution-free way of storing electrical energy with long cycle life and high power density [1\u20135]. Recently, they have partially replaced conventional rechargeable batteries in industries such as elevators, electric vehicles, mobile electronics, and rail transportation fields. The emergence of supercapacitors is generally considered to be the most effective power supply system to bridge the gap between low energy density conventional capacitors and low power density lithium-ion batteries [6\u20138]. Graphene oxide (GO), generally considered by researchers as a chemical derivative of graphene with oxygen functional groups, is frequently regarded as an excellent and efficient material for supercapacitors due to its excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, high electron mobility, and other outstanding properties [9\u201313]. At the same time, GO has some of the same excellent properties as graphene. Most critically, GO is an ideal material for electrode doping because of its abundant source, very low price, and environmental friendliness [14\u201317]. In addition, because GO contains oxygen-containing groups on its surface, it can be used as a surface functionalizer, thereby making it more suitable for integrating with organic substrates and the decoration of functional materials [18,19]. Strong directional interactions between GO sheets, however, often result in GO sheets stacking and reducing its surface area [9,20\u201324]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystal structures that have recently received a lot of attention from researchers because of their regularity, porosity, and large\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3234. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12183234 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3234 2 of 13\nspecific surface area, as these properties can increase the rate of electron and ion transfer during electrochemical reactions [25\u201328]. Further, MOFs have multiple electron arrangements in their outer electron orbits, which enables multi-level redox behavior and more charge storage possibilities [29,30]. However, pristine MOFs have poor electrical conductivity, so they are rarely used for supercapacitor electrodes. To overcome the disadvantages of MOFs, one approach is to design and synthesize highly conductive MOF-based hybrid composites [31\u201338]. In one study, CNTs@Co-BTC microspheres (CCBM) were synthesized via solvent heat. Electrochemical test results showed that the MOF microspheres (CCBM) had the better electrical capacity and cycling performance than Co-BTC microspheres (CBM). CCBM apparently possessed a higher specific electric capacity (553.3 F/g at 1 A/g) than CBM (371.8 F/g at 1 A/g) [39]. The other method is to use MOF derivatives as electrode materials for supercapacitors to obtain good conductivity and large specific capacitance. For example, hollow carbon nanofibers with an inside-outside decoration of bi-metallic MOFderived Ni-Fe phosphides ((Ni-Fe)-P-C@HCNFs) electrode have a high specific capacitance of 1392 F/g at 1 A/g and good cycling stability [40]. It is also possible to construct multicomponent composites using MOFs containing highly conductive materials. For instance, MOF was grown directly on GO sheets and used as a hybrid supercapacitor electrode with a maximum specific capacitance of 447.2 F/g at 1 A/g [41]. In recent years, several groups have recognized the benefits of combining MOF and GO for new special composite materials, not only solving the problem of graphene oxide superimposition caused by the mutual orientation effect, but also improving the conductivity of MOFs [42\u201347]. The composites with outstanding properties can be used in supercapacitor applications. Herein, we report a facile method combining Co-BTC and GO to fabricate highly porous three-dimensional structures to meet the demand for high-performance supercapacitors. The basic principle is to combine the 2D lamellar structure of GO with the 3D structure of Co-BTC microspheres to produce composites with excellent electron and charge transport properties. The ultimate objective of this study is to analyze the morphological characteristics of the composites and evaluate their electrochemical properties, while the effect of the Co-BTC:GO ratio on capacitance is fully investigated and discussed by synthesizing Co-BTC@GO with different graphene oxide content."

A more significant redox peak can be observed in the CV curve for Co-BTC@GO 2, indicating a substantially greater capacitance. Two sets of redox peaks can be observed in the CV curves, indicating that the capacitance is mainly a pseudo-capacitance provided for by the redox mechanism rather than a pure double layer capacitance. With the gradual increase in the scan rate, it can be seen that the reduction peak clearly shifts to the lower voltage, while the oxidation peak shifts to the higher voltage. The shape of the CV curves, on the other hand, remains consistent, indicating that the Co-BTC@GO 2 electrode has an excellent rate for properties and reversibility. The GCD values for the Co-BTC@GO 2 electrode measure in the range of 1\u201320 A/g (Figure 6d) (GCD curves for Co-BTC, Co-BTC@GO 1, and Co-BTC@GO 4 are displayed in Figures S1b, S2b, and S3b).
