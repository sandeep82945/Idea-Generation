Extension to Other Forms of Subjectivity in Text: Investigate the applicability of the described recommender system-inspired architectures to other subjective NLP tasks beyond argument quality, such as sentiment analysis, humor detection, and offensive content identification. These areas could significantly benefit from nuanced models that account for individual differences in perception and interpretation.

Cross-Lingual and Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Explore the effectiveness of the proposed models across different languages and cultural contexts. Since subjectivity can be highly influenced by cultural and linguistic nuances, developing and testing these models in a cross-lingual setting could provide insights into the universality of argument quality criteria and the adaptability of the models to capture diverse annotator perspectives.

Integration of Explicit Knowledge Bases: Enhance the models by integrating explicit knowledge bases or structured argumentative frameworks that provide objective grounding for arguments. This could help in better identifying common ground among annotators and refining the balance between capturing individual perspectives and adhering to universally accepted argumentation principles.

Personalized Feedback Systems for Argumentation Training: Develop interactive systems that provide personalized feedback on argument quality based on the models' ability to understand individual annotator preferences. Such systems could be used in educational contexts to help individuals improve their argumentation skills by understanding diverse perspectives on what makes an argument effective.

Investigation of Model Explainability and Bias: Conduct in-depth studies into the explainability of the proposed models, particularly in how they manage to balance individual and common perspectives. Additionally, explore potential biases that might arise from the models' preference for certain annotator perspectives over others, especially in contexts with a diverse range of opinions. Understanding and mitigating these biases is crucial for the ethical application of such models in real-world scenarios.
