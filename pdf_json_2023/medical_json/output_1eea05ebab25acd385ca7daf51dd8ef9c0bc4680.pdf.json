Persistent hyperglycemia can induce inflammation and oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees (Acanthaceae) (A. paniculata) on blood glucose, inflammation, and oxidative stress in canine diabetes. A total of 41 client-owned dogs (23 diabetic and 18 clinically healthy) were included in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nMethods: The diabetic dogs were further divided into two treatments protocols: group 1 received A. paniculata extract capsules (50 mg/kg/day; n = 6) or received placebo for 90 days (n = 7); and group 2 received A. paniculata extract capsules (100 mg/kg/day; n = 6) or received a placebo for 180 days (n = 4). Blood and urine samples were collected every month. No significant differences in fasting blood glucose, fructosamine, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde levels were observed between the treatment and placebo groups (p > 0.05).\nResults and Discussion: The levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were stable in the treatment groups. The blood glucose levels and concentrations of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the client-owned diabetic dogs were not altered by A. paniculata supplementation. Furthermore, treatment with this extract did not have any adverse effects on the animals. Non-etheless, the effects of A. paniculata on canine diabetes must be appropriately evaluated using a proteomic approach and involving a wider variety of protein markers.\nKEYWORDS\ncanine diabetes, oxidative stress, inflammation, adverse effects, A. paniculata (Burm.f.) nees (acanthaceae)"

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disorder caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency, which impairs glucose uptake into the cell (Nelson and Reusch, 2014). Insulin-dependent DM, a disease that resembles type 1 diabetes in humans, has been commonly recognized in dogs (Behrend et al., 2018). The diagnosis of DM in dogs is based on the presence of hyperglycemia and glucosuria, along with signs of weight loss, decreased appetite, polyuria, and polydipsia (Nelson and Reusch, 2014). Uncontrolled DM results in persistent hyperglycemia that can cause complications, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and atherosclerosis (Papatheodorou et al., 2016). The overproduction of superoxide has been proposed as a unifying mechanism that mediates the tissue-damaging effects of prolonged hyperglycemia (Brownlee, 2005). Thus, the management of DM is aimed at controlling the blood glucose level, which can be accomplished through insulin therapy, dietary modification, and control of concurrent disorders (Papachristoforou et al., 2020).\nIn combination with standard treatment, botanical drugs are utilized as an adjunct therapy to prevent long-term complications and improve the overall wellbeing of diabetic dogs. A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees (Acanthaceae) (A. paniculate), one of the most popular medicinal plants, consists of many active phytochemicals, such as andrographolide, neoandrographolide, andrographiside 14- deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, 14-deoxy-11-oxoandrographolide, and \u03b2-sitosterol (Dai et al., 2019). The aerial part of this plant was commonly used due to the presence of andrographolide, the primary active component of A. paniculata (Patil and Andrographolide, 2020). The biological activities of andrographolide include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antidiabetic, antifertility, antiviral, antibacterial, cardioprotective, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective effects (Okhuarobo et al., 2014; Kishore et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021). A. paniculata is known to exert anti-inflammatory properties by downregulating the levels of cyclooxygenase and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in human, rats, and mice (Abu-Ghefreh et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Jaiyesimi et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2022).\nEvidence suggests that A. paniculata might be considered as a promising candidate for the management of DM; for instance, oral A. paniculata supplementation was used as a hypoglycemic agent in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Yu et al., 2003) and high-fatfructose-fed rats (Nugroho et al., 2012). Andrographolide supplementation ameliorated renal mesangial cell proliferation and inflammation by inhibiting protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling (Ji et al., 2016). Treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with A. paniculata reduced oxidative stress by increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities (Zhang and Tan, 2000). Furthermore, decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased levels of glutathione were observed in the kidneys of diabetic rats supplemented with A. paniculata (Hidayat and Wulandari, 2021).\nStudies in humans and rodents demonstrated the potential of A. paniculata as a supplemental treatment for DM in tandem with standard medicine. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published evidence of the impact and safety of A. paniculata supplementation in client-own diabetic dogs. Therefore, the aim of\nthe present study was to evaluate the outcomes of A. paniculata supplementation in canine DM-associated inflammation and oxidative stress. Additionally, the adverse effects of A. paniculata supplementation were determined in the animals."

A total of 41 client-own dogs (23 diabetic and 18 clinically healthy) from Prasu Arthorn Animal Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Mahidol University were included in this study. The clinically healthy dogs were used for cross-sectional normal baseline evaluations. All dogs were used after obtaining the signed consent forms from the owners. The design used for the experiments in this study is shown in Figure 1. For the determination of optimum dose and duration of A. paniculata treatment, the diabetic dogs were divided into two treatment protocols. In the first protocol, dogs were given either A. paniculata extracted capsules (50 mg/kg/day; n = 6) or a placebo (n = 7) for 90 days. In another protocol, dogs were given A. paniculata extracted capsules (100 mg/kg/day; n= 6), while others were given placebo (n= 4) for 180 days. Routine treatment was provided to all the dogs. The clinical parameters and the levels of the inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in each group. The characteristics of the dogs in each group are shown in Supplementary Table S1A.\nThe inclusion criteria were diabetic dogs of any breed, age, or sex, with stable blood glucose levels for the previous 3 months. The diabetic dogs were diagnosed with a history of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss with normal or increased appetite, fasting hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. The exclusion criteria for the study were as follows: dogs with unstable diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, those that received corticosteroids, and those with diseases that affect the blood glucose levels, such as hyperadrenocorticism, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, neoplasia, and acromegaly. To reduce the confounding factors, all the diabetic dogs enrolled in this study were fed a commercial diabetic diet and allowed to live indoors or within their compounds, close to their owners, without any changes in their environment during the study period.\n2.2 A. paniculata and placebo\nA commercial A. paniculata capsule (Abhaibhubejhr\u00ae FAHTALAI-JONE capsule, lot: MB00916006) was used as a supplement in this study. Each capsule contained 400 mg of the aerial part of A. paniculata, which was standardized to a content of 1% w/w andrographolide. The procedures and findings of the analysis of andrographolide in the capsule of A. paniculata are detailed in Supplementary material B. Lactose powder, which was similar in appearance to theA. paniculata capsule, was used as a placebo in this study. The dosage of the drug was referenced from the dosage given in experimental rats in a previous study (Panossian et al., 2000) and calculated to that used for dogs using the conversion factors proposed by Reagan-Shaw (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02"

The clinical parameters, which included complete blood count (CBC) and the levels of glucose, fructosamine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, were analyzed every 30 days during routine health check-up. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were selected as the inflammatory biomarkers, whereas SOD and MDA were used as the oxidative stress biomarkers. The biomarkers were evaluated on days 0 and 90 or 180, depending on the treatment protocol.\nOne drop of the blood sample was used to test the glucose level using the AlphaTRAK glucometer (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, United State). The blood samples were then divided into three parts and used for further experiments. The ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples were stored at 4\u00b0C, and the CBCs were measured using an animal blood counter (Horiba Medical, Montpellier, France) within 4 h. The second part was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min within an hour after blood collection; the resultant plasma was used to measure the ALT, ALP, BUN, and creatinine levels using an automatic analyzer (Chema diagnostica, Monsano AN, Italy), and the serum was collected in a sterile microcentrifuge tube and stored at \u221280\u00b0C to measure the IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, SOD, and MDA levels. The third part was collected in plain tubes and sent to a commercial laboratory within 24 h to measure the fructosamine level.\nThe urine sample was collected by cystocentesis and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min (Hettich Lab Technology, Tuttlingen, Germany). The physical and chemical properties (color, clarity, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketone, and bilirubin levels, and erythrocyte counts) of the urine supernatants were tested using the dipstick test (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, United State). The urine sediments were evaluated under a light microscope (ZEISS, Jena, Germany).

A. paniculata, a medicinal plant typically used as an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent, has been studied for its possible impact on the management of DM in humans (Nugroho et al., 2012; Dai et al., 2019; Adiguna et al., 2021; Hossain et al., 2021). Andrographolide is a potential bioactive phytochemical in A. paniculata, which possesses antidiabetic properties (Nugroho et al., 2012; Ji et al., 2016; Islam, 2017; Naik et al., 2017; Mehta et al., 2021; Syukri et al., 2021). Plasma andrographolide was detected in dogs orally treated with A. paniculata tablets, indicating that andrographolide can be absorbed via the GI tract (Xu et al., 2015). However, it is important to be aware of the adverse effects of these natural products. Knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of A. paniculata in canine DM is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of A. paniculata supplementation on the levels of glucose, fructosamine, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers, and to determine the presence of any adverse effects in canine diabetes.\nInitially, the animals were treated with 50 mg/kg ofA. paniculata for 90 days, based on previous studies on rats, to determine the longterm efficacy and safety of the medicinal plant; however, no improvements were observed in the treatment group. Therefore, the dose and duration of A. paniculata supplementation were\nFIGURE 5 The effects of A. paniculata supplementation (doses 50 and 100 mg/kg) on inflammation in the diabetic dogs.

The dose and frequency of insulin administration to the dogs were not adjusted during A. paniculata supplementation. However, the findings of this study were not in concordance with those reported in mice and rats (Yu et al., 2003; Akhtar et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020; Jaiyesimi et al., 2020; Wediasari et al., 2020). Oral andrographolide and A. paniculata lowered the blood glucose levels of streptozotocininduced diabetic rats in a dose-dependent manner (Yu et al., 2003; Wediasari et al., 2020). Furthermore, A. paniculata extract was reported to reduce hyperglycemia by inhibiting \u03b2-cell dysfunction in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (Jaiyesimi et al., 2020). An ethanolic extract of A. paniculata and andrographolide lowered the plasma glucose levels by enhancing the translocation of glucose-transporter-4 in insulin-resistant obese mice (Akhtar et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020).\nHyperglycemia elevates the levels of inflammatory markers and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, leading to several DM complications (Siddiqui et al., 2019). Furthermore, increased oxidative stress and inflammation could result in insulin resistance and reduced \u03b2 cell function. These vicious cycles are linked to the pathogenesis of DM. In the current study, no changes in the plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were observed in the A. paniculata-treated diabetic dogs. However, the extract has been reported to significantly reduce the levels of these markers in diabetic rats (Jaiyesimi et al., 2020). In another study, treatment with andrographolide suppressed cardiac inflammation via nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and reduced both cardiac fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (Liang et al., 2018). Similarly, andrographolide reportedly blocked the NF-\n\u03baB signaling pathway induced by TNF-\u03b1 in adipocytes, suggesting that it might reduce insulin resistance by modulating the insulin signaling pathway and improving glucose uptake (Jin et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2020). In the current study, no significant differences in the levels of the oxidative stress markers, including SOD and MDA were observed between the healthy and diabetic groups of dogs. This is contrary to previous reports, which indicated the beneficial effect of A. paniculata and andrographolide on DM complications via reductions in oxidative stress. For instance, andrographolide reduced the characteristics of diabetic nephropathy in murine glomerular mesangial cell lines by reducing the intracellular oxidative states. As considered, andrographolide renal hypertrophy and extracellular matrix accumulation in diabetic mice, as well as NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX-1) expression, ROS production, and proinflammatory cytokines (Lee et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2016). In addition, the cardioprotective effects of andrographolides in diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice have been associated with a decrease in ROS produced by NOX activation (Liang et al., 2018).\nThe etiology and type of diabetes differ across species, which might explain the variability in the responses to A. paniculata treatment. Insulin deficiency, the most common type of canine diabetes, is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, which leads to insufficient insulin production and glucotoxicity comparable to that seen in human type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (Nelson and Reusch, 2014; Gilor et al., 2016; O\u2019Kell et al., 2017). Assuming dogs with clinical diabetes have end-stage T1DM may result in a lost potential to treat and reverse glucotoxicity (Gilor et al., 2016). This might explain why A. paniculata treatment did not improve the characteristic features of canine DM in the present study. Furthermore, the findings of the current study were\nFIGURE 8 The effects of A. paniculata supplementation (doses 50 and 100 mg/kg for 90 and 180 days, respectively) on the biochemical parameters of renal injury in the diabetic dogs.

However, the DM in rodents was chemically induced with streptozotocin or alloxan, which promotes cell death and decreases insulin production; this is different from the canine DM produced by chronic autoantibody destruction over a long period (Al-awar et al., 2016; Furman, 2021; O\u2019Kell et al., 2022). A. paniculata treatment was reported to lead to beneficial outcomes in insulin-resistant obese mice, a model for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which is not frequent in dogs (Catchpole et al., 2005; Akhtar et al., 2016; Heydemann, 2016; Chen et al., 2020).\nInterspecies variations in pharmacokinetics, particularly the absorption process, may impact the response to A. paniculata treatment. Although oral A. paniculata tablets were absorbed via the GI tract in dogs, the information about the pharmacokinetics involved is currently lacking (Xu et al., 2015). Furthermore, variations in bioavailability across studies beyond species variations may be related to the use of various forms of A. paniculata (Loureiro Damasceno et al., 2022; Songvut et al., 2022). Andrographolide metabolism and clearance variations have been observed among species (Panossian et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2013). DM involves complicated metabolic processes; hence, the parameters utilized to assess the impact of A. paniculata in this study, such as the blood glucose, fructosamine, cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), and oxidative stress indicators (SOD and MDA), may not sensitive enough. The pathogenesis and complications of DM, along with the treatment response, have been analyzed using proteomic patterns (Riaz, 2015; Pena et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019). Candidate proteins which including alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), haptoglobin, retinolbinding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein were shown to vary significantly between normal and prediabetes/diabetes in human patients (Riaz, 2015; Kim et al., 2019). Plasma proteomic analysis in canine DM showed a differential expression of alpha-2-HS glycoprotein, transthyretin, apolipoprotein A-I, and apolipoprotein A-IV compared with healthy dogs (Suemanotham et al., 2022). Plasma potential biomarkers such as apolipoprotein C-I, apoA-I, transthyretin, and cystatin C were purposed to predict the progression and response to the treatment in diabetic kidney disease (Riaz, 2015; Pena et al., 2016). Consequently, the effects of A. paniculata on canine diabetes should be evaluated using a proteomic approach and involving a wider variety of protein markers.\nConfounding factors such as diet, activities, and environment were common limitations in this clinical study. Therefore, dogs that were fed a commercial diabetic diet, allowed to live indoors or within compounds close to their owners, and did not experience any changes in their environment before and during the study period, were included in the present study. The randomized, double-blind placebo control trial, considered as the gold standard method for medical research, was used in this study to mask the bias. Thus, we believe that, based on the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and the robust study design, the results of this study should adequately represent the effect of A. paniculata, despite the clinical confounding factors.\nPhysical examinations were conducted, and the biochemical parameters of liver injury and kidney function were evaluated during the treatment periods. Additionally, adverse reactions such as weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, and allergy were monitored. No changes in physical and biochemical parameters, including ALT, ALP, BUN, and creatinine levels, were noted in all dogs supplemented with A. paniculata (dosages, 50 and 100 mg/kg/ day for 90 and 180 days, respectively). Andrographolide was reported to exert beneficial effects by lowering the levels of urea, BUN, and creatinine in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (Xu et al., 2012). In another study,A. paniculata demonstrated protective effects against hepatic injury induced by paracetamol and ethanol in rodents (Nagalekshmi et al., 2011; Sivaraj et al., 2011; Mondal et al., 2022). Adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dizziness, drowsiness, and urticaria, of A. paniculata extracts or pure metabolites, were observed in some human clinical studies (Thamlikitkul et al., 1991; Saxena et al., 2010; Jayakumar et al., 2013). Non-etheless, no adverse effects were observed in any of the treated dogs in the present study. The worsening of the clinical signs of DM, such as weight loss, polyphagia, polyuria, and polydipsia, was not encountered. These findings suggest that the dosages of A. paniculata administered were harmless within the trial durations specified in this investigation.\nThe supplementation of A. paniculata did not statistically improve the clinical signs and did not affect the DM parameters or the inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the current study, which might be attributed to three main reasons. First, the doses and treatment period of A. paniculata supplementation were insufficient. Secondly, the pharmacokinetic variations among species and dosage forms of A. paniculata may impact the plasma concentrations of andrographolide, leading to variations in the pharmacological response (Zhao et al., 2013; Loureiro Damasceno et al., 2022; Songvut et al., 2022). Lastly, the biomarkers we used were not sensitive enough to identify the changes in the etiology and complications of DM. Therefore, protein profiling has been suggested to better understand the prognosis, development of complications, and treatment outcome prediction of DM (Chen and Gerszten, 2020; Araumi et al., 2021; Gummesson et al., 2021). However, unless the appropriate biomarkers can be evaluated, there is still a possibility that A. paniculata can contribute to delay the development and consequences of canine diabetes. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that treatment with A. paniculata for 180 days did not affect the clinical parameters and levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in canine DM. Additionally, no adverse effects were observed in the diabetic animals. These positive attributes demonstrate the tolerability of A. paniculata for long-term treatment in canine diabetes. Nonetheless, the relevance of other biomarkers such as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), transthyretin, and alpha2-glycoprotein for observing the changes in the pathogenesis of DM must be explored further."
