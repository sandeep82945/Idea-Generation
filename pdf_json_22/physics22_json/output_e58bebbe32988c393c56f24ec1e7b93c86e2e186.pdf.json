    "abstractText": "This paper proposes a frequency-time hybrid solver for the time-dependent wave equation in twodimensional interior spatial domains. The approach relies on four main elements, namely, 1) A multiple scattering strategy that decomposes a given interior time-domain problem into a sequence of limitedduration time-domain problems of scattering by overlapping open arcs, each one of which is reduced (by means of the Fourier transform) to a sequence of Helmholtz frequency-domain problems; 2) Boundary integral equations on overlapping boundary patches for the solution of the frequency-domain problems in point 1); 3) A smooth \u201cTime-windowing and recentering\u201d methodology that enables both treatment of incident signals of long duration and long time simulation; and, 4) A Fourier transform algorithm that delivers numerically dispersionless, spectrally-accurate time evolution for given incident fields. By recasting the interior time-domain problem in terms of a sequence of open-arc multiple scattering events, the proposed approach regularizes the full interior frequency domain problem\u2014which, if obtained by either Fourier or Laplace transformation of the corresponding interior time-domain problem, must encapsulate infinitely many scattering events, giving rise to non-uniqueness and eigenfunctions in the Fourier case, and ill conditioning in the Laplace case. Numerical examples are included which demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

Methods often utilized in both the literature and applications, such as the finite difference method [56], the finite element (FE) method [35, 41, 60] and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method [36,58], rely on use of volumetric discretizations of the spatial domain in conjunction with appropriate time-stepping discretization methods; recent related contributions include the unconditionally stable space-time FE/DG methods [11,45] which can avoid use of fine temporal meshes even in the common situations in which fine spatial meshes are required for resolution of challenging geometric features. Volumetric discretization approaches can treat problems in general geometries and including spatially varying media. As is well known, however, such methods often suffer from spatial and temporal numerical dispersion errors (also known as pollution errors [7,42]), and they therefore require use\n\u2217Department of Computing & Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Blvd., CA 91125, United States.

This method requires treatment of the Dirac delta function, and it therefore leads to integration domains given by the intersection of the light cone with the overall scattering surface. As a result, the schemes resulting from the discretization of the TDBIE are generally complex, and, additionally, they have presented challenges concerning numerical stability [13]. The \u201cConvolution Quadrature\u201d method [10,16,46,51] (CQ), in turn, relies on the combination of a finite-difference time discretization and a Laplace-like transformation to reduce the time-domain problem to modified Helmholtz problems over a range of frequencies. The Helmholtz problems in the CQ context are tackled by means of frequency-domain integral equations, and, thus, the CQ method effectively eliminates spatial dispersion. The solution method inherits the dispersive character of the finite-difference approximation that underlies the time-domain scheme, however. A certain \u201cinfinite tail\u201d in the CQ time history that results from \u201cthe passage through the Laplace domain\u201d also presents \u201ca serious disadvantage\u201d [51, Chapter 5.1].\nA frequency-time hybrid solver has recently been proposed [6], in which the time evolution is evaluated by means of a certain \u201cwindowing and time-recentering\u201d procedure. The algorithm presented in that reference simply decomposes the incident time signal as a sum of a sequence of smooth compactly supported incident \u201cwave packets\u201d. Using Fourier transformation in time, the solution for each one of the wave packets is expressed in terms of regular-Helmholtz frequency-domain solutions\u2014thus eliminating spatial dispersion, just like the CQ method. The \u201crecentering\u201d strategy then allows for use of a fixed set of frequencydomain solutions for arbitrarily long times. A tracking strategy is used to determine the time interval during which the solution associated with each wave packet must be kept as part of the simulation. An efficient implementation of the required Fourier transformation processes is introduced in [6] which includes specialized high-frequency algorithms, including, e.g. \u201ctime re-centering\u201d of the wave as well as Chebyshev and Fourier-Continuation Fourier transform representations. Unlike other approaches, the hybrid method [6] can provide highly accurate numerical solutions for problems involving complex scatterers for incident fields applied over long periods of time. The method allows for time leaping, parallel-in-time implementation and, importantly, spectral accuracy in time. The CQ approach and other hybrid methods [31, 48], in contrast, have only provided solutions for incident signals of very brief time duration, as indicated in the various comparisons with other methods provided in [6].\nThe present paper proposes an extension of the time-domain method [6] to problems posed in interior physical domains. An immediate challenge arises as such a program is contemplated, namely, that the interior-domain Helmholtz equation is not uniquely solvable at any frequency whose negative square is an eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. This problem does not arise if the CQ method is used instead: the resulting modified Helmholtz problems are uniquely solvable for all Laplace frequencies. In order to avoid the aforementioned time-dispersion and infinite tail difficulties inherent in the CQ method, however, the present paper retains the use of the Fourier transform, and it re-expresses the full time-evolution as a problem of multiple scattering among various portions of the domain boundary. Thus, taking into account the wave\u2019s finite speed of propagation, the original domain boundary is decomposed into a number Narc of overlapping open-arcs, each one of which gives rise to a corresponding scattering problem, in absence of all other arcs in the decomposition. For simplicity, this paper restricts attention to the case Narc = 2, but a numerical illustration is presented for a simple Narc > 2 case. (Complete details concerning the algorithm and its implementation for arbitrary Narc \u2265 2 will be presented elsewhere [12].) In view of Theorems 2.8 and 3.4 below (see also Algorithms 1-4), by appropriately accounting for multiple scattering, solutions for such open-arc problems can be combined into a full solution, which is mathematically exact and numerically accurate, for the given interior domain problem. Crucially, the frequency-domain open-arc scattering problems that result upon Fourier transformation are uniquely solvable.\nSolution via e.g. a Laplace transformation in time, in contrast, while also eliminating the difficulties arising from the existence of interior-eigenvalues (and associated lack of existence and uniqueness for the necessary frequency-domain problems), entails the instability inherent in numerical inverse Laplace transformation. We suggest that this Laplace-transform instability reflects precisely the use of frequencydomain solutions that incorporate infinitely many multiple scattering events, from which the solution up to a given finite time T is then to be obtained\u2014somehow eliminating, via high-frequency cancellations, all contributions from multiple scattering events beyond time T , and thereby, in view of such cancellations, incorporating a powerful source of ill conditioning at any finite spatio-temporal discretization level. Note that each frequency-domain solution in the Laplace frequency domain indeed contains infinite-time information, as is evidenced by the fact that the same set of frequency-domain solutions can theoretically be used to propagate the time-domain solution of the wave equation up to arbitrarily long times. The proposed multiple-scattering algorithm avoids the instability by restricting the number of multiple scattering events considered to what is strictly necessary to advance the solution up to a given finite time.\nIn the proposed algorithm the necessary frequency-domain open-arc scattering problems are obtained by means of a frequency-domain integral equation solver, as indicated in Algorithm 2. In view of the classical regularity theory for open-surface problems (see [21, 29, 43, 50, 54]), the open arc solutions are singular at the arc endpoints: they behave like a non-integer power of the distance to the endpoint and, e.g., in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions considered in this paper, they tend to infinity as the endpoint is approached. The two-dimensional version [25] of the Chebyshev-based rectangular-polar discretization methodology [18], which incorporates a change of variables introduced in [24, Eq. (4.12)], is utilized to evaluate the corresponding integrals with a high order of accuracy. Together with an appropriate geometrical description, such as those provided by engineering NURBS-based models\u2014which include parametrizations expressed in terms of certain types of Rational B-Splines\u2014the overlapping-patch boundary-partitioning strategy can be used to tackle interior wave-equation problems in general three-dimensional engineering structures. Such extensions of the proposed methods, however, are not considered in this paper, and are left for future work.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2.1 describes the wave propagation and scattering problem under consideration. Section 2.2 introduces the overlapping-arc scattering structure, and the time-domain boundary integral equations for the open-arc time-domain scattering problems. A necessary Huygenslike domain-of-influence condition is introduced in Section 2.3, which simply states that, as in free space, waves move along boundaries at the speed of sound. Surprisingly, to the best of the authors knowledge, such a result has not been established as yet. A discussion in this regard is presented in Section 2.3, including a rigorous proof of validity in a simple geometrical context as well as clear numerical evidence of validity in other cases; the rigorous proof of validity of this condition for general curves is left for future work. As a byproduct of the constructions concerning the Huygens condition, a 2D double-layer time-domain formulation is introduced in Remark A.2 in Appendix A which bypasses certain difficulties encountered previously. On the basis of these materials, Section 2.4 re-expresses the interior time-domain problem in terms of a proposed open-arc \u201cping-pong\u201d multiple-scattering approach, and it presents the main theoretical result of this paper, Theorem 2.8\u2014which establishes that the interior time-domain problem is indeed equivalent to the proposed ping-pong problem. Section 2.5 then re-expresses the ping-pong problem in terms of associated open-arc frequency-domain problems, and Section 2.6 presents the aforementioned windowing and time-recentering strategy that is used to enable the treatment of problems of arbitrary long time duration. The numerical implementation of the multiple scattering approach is presented in Section 3, including the windowed Fourier-transform algorithm [6] used (Section 3.1), the methods utilized for the evaluation of singular frequency-domain integral operators, and a novel arc-extension approach that facilitates the avoidance of open-arc endpoint singularities (Section 3.2). The overall computational implementation is outlined in Section 3.3. Numerical examples demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, finally, are presented in Section 4."

The hybrid approach proposed in the present paper relies, instead, on a multiple scattering strategy that transforms the original wave equation problem in a bounded domain into a sequence of wave equation problems of scattering by overlapping open-arcs\u2014for which the frequency domain solutions exist at all frequencies, and for which, therefore, general timedomain solutions can effectively be obtained via the windowing and recentering Fourier-transform methods introduced in [6]. The overlapping-arc scattering structure used as well as necessary theoretical results concerning open-arc time-domain scattering problems are presented in the following sections."

Thus, as illustrated in Figure 1(b), the scattering surface \u0393 in Figure 1(a) is covered by two overlapping patches \u03931 = \u03931 \u2282 \u0393 and \u03932 = \u03932 \u2282 \u0393, \u0393 = \u03931 \u222a \u03932, whose intersection \u039312 = \u03931\u2229\u03932 equals the disjoint union \u039312 = \u0393112\u222a\u0393212 of two connected components \u0393112 and \u0393212.

Here, for given \u03c3 > 0 and \u03b1, p \u2208 R, and for a given Hilbert space D, we have used the spatio-temporal Sobolev spaces Hp\u03c3,\u03b1(R, D) of functions with values in D which vanish for t \u2264 \u03b1. The spaces Hp\u03c3,\u03b1(R, D) are defined by [9,26]\nHp\u03c3,\u03b1(R, D) := { f \u2208 L\u2032\u03c3,\u03b1(D) : \u222b \u221e+i\u03c3 \u2212\u221e+i\u03c3 |s|2p\u2016L[f ](s)\u20162Dds <\u221e }\n(2.9)\ntogether with the norm\n\u2016f\u2016Hp\u03c3,\u03b1(R,D) := (\u222b \u221e+i\u03c3 \u2212\u221e+i\u03c3 |s|2p\u2016L[f ](s)\u20162Dds )1/2 , (2.10)\nwhere L[f ] denotes the Fourier-Laplace transform of f given by L[f ](s) := \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e f(t)eistdt, s \u2208 C\u03c3 := {\u03c9 \u2208 C : Im(s) > \u03c3 > 0}, (2.11)\nand where L\u2032\u03c3,\u03b1(D) := {\u03c6 \u2208 D\u2032\u03b1(D) : e\u2212\u03c3t\u03c6 \u2208 S \u2032\u03b1(D)} is defined in terms of the sets D\u2032\u03b1(D) and S \u2032\u03b1(D) of D-valued distributions and D-valued tempered distributions that vanish for t \u2264 \u03b1, respectively.

It can be easily checked that, as suggested by the notation used, the space Hp\u03b1(\u03b2,D) does not depend on \u03c3. This can be verified for integer values of p by using a norm equivalent to (2.10) that is expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to the variable t, in conjunction with smooth and compactly-supported window functions of t which equals one over the restriction interval (\u2212\u221e, \u03b2] for a given value of \u03b2.

            "text": "The multiple scattering algorithm proposed in this paper depends in an essential manner on a certain domain-of-influence condition, stated as Condition 2.2 below, which is in essence a variant of the well known Huygens principle in a form that is applicable to the problem of scattering by obstacles and open arcs. Thus, Condition 2.2 expresses a well accepted principle in wave physics, namely, that solutions of the wave equation propagate at the speed of sound, and that the wave field vanishes identically before the arrival of a wavefront. This property has been rigorously established by the method of spherical means [8] for the problem of propagation of waves in space without scatterers. Further, some mathematical results have previously been given for the corresponding problem of scattering by obstacles [51, Proposition 3.6.2]. But previously available results for obstacle-scattering problems are not sharp, as they only ensure that the field propagates away from the complete boundary (with speed equal to the speed of sound), but they do not account for propagation along the scattering boundary. In particular, for incident fields illuminating a subset of the boundary of a scatterer, previous theoretical results do not establish that the field propagates at the speed of sound along the scattering boundary. This boundary-propagation character provides a crucial element in the main theorem of this paper, Theorem 2.8\u2014which, showing that the exact solution of the problem (2.1) can be expressed as the sum of a series of multiple-scattering iterates, forms the basis of the ping-pong multiple-scattering algorithm proposed in this paper. Although we conjecture that Condition 2.2 is always valid, to the best of our knowledge such a result has not previously been\nestablished. A full theoretical treatment of this problem is beyond the scope of this paper, but, as indicated in Remark 2.3, this paper does include a complete proof for the case of straight arcs as well as clear numerical supporting evidence for the validity of this condition for curved arcs.\nLet C denote an Lipschitz open arc. Given an incident signal g(x, t) defined for x \u2208 C and t \u2208 R, which vanishes for t \u2264 0, consider the wave equation problem{\n\u22022ws\n\u2202t2 (x, t)\u2212 c2\u2206ws(x, t) = 0, (x, t) \u2208 R2\\C \u00d7 R,\nws(x, t) = g(x, t), (x, t) \u2208 C \u00d7 R. (2.12)\nUsing these notations, the necessary Huygens-like condition is presented in what follows.\nCondition 2.2. We say that an open Lipschitz curve C with endpoints e1 and e2 satisfies the restricted Huygens condition iff for every Lipschitz curve Cinc \u2286 C satisfying dist(Cinc, {e1, e2}) > 0, and for every function g \u2208 Hp\u03c3,0(R, H1/2(C)) defined in C such that\n{x \u2208 C | g(x, t) 6= 0} \u2286 Cinc for all t > 0, (2.13)\nwe have\n{x \u2208 R2 | ws(x, t) 6= 0} \u2286 \u039bs(t) for all t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {e1, e2}), (2.14)\nwhere\n\u039bs(t) = {x \u2208 R2 | dist(x, Cinc) \u2264 ct}.\nRemark 2.3. We conjecture that Condition 2.2 holds for arbitrary open and closed Lipschitz curves C (where, in the case of closed curves, the wave equation problem is posed either in the interior or the exterior of the curve) and for all t > 0 (without the restriction t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {e1, e2})). The proof is left for future work. The validity of Condition 2.2 for the case in which C is a line segment is established in the following lemma. We have also verified numerically the validity of this condition for a wide range of curved open arcs; one such verification is presented in Section 2.3.1 below.\nIn what follows we denote R2\u00b1 := {x = (x1, x2) \u2208 R2 : x2 \u2277 0} and R20 := {x = (x1, x2)> \u2208 R2 : x2 = 0}.\nLemma 2.4. Let c1 < c2. Then the (straight) open arc C = (c1, c2) \u00d7 {0} \u2282 R20 satisfies the restricted Huygens Condition 2.2.\nProof. Let Cinc \u2286 C denote an arc contained in C satisfying dist(Cinc, {(c1, 0), (c2, 0)}) > 0, let a function g \u2208 Hp\u03c3,0(R, H1/2(C)) be given that satisfies the assumption (2.13), extend g to all of R20 by setting g = 0 in R20\\C, and consider the problems{\n\u22022vs\u00b1 \u2202t2\n(x, t)\u2212 c2\u2206vs\u00b1(x, t) = 0, (x, t) \u2208 R2\u00b1 \u00d7 R, vs\u00b1(x, t) = g(x, t), (x, t) \u2208 R20 \u00d7 R\n(2.15)\nfor the functions vs\u00b1 = vs\u00b1(x, t). In view of equation (A.7) in Appendix A it follows that\nvs+(x, t) = 1\n\u03c0c2\u222b Cinc \u222b t\u2212c\u22121|x\u2212y| 0 [ x2g(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2 +\nx2g (1)(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2\n] d\u03c4dsy (2.16)\nfor all x \u2208 R2+ and all t > 0, where g(1)(x, t) = \u2202g \u2202t (x, t). Noting that for t > 0 and x /\u2208 \u039b s(t) we have t \u2212 c\u22121|x \u2212 y| < 0 for all y \u2208 Cinc, and since g(\u00b7, t) = 0 for all t \u2264 0 by assumption, we conclude that {x \u2208 R2 | vs+(x, t) 6= 0} \u2286 \u039bs(t) for all t > 0. Similarly, {x \u2208 R2 | vs\u2212(x, t) 6= 0} \u2286 \u039bs(t) for all t > 0. It follows that{\nvs+(x, t) = v s \u2212(x, t) = 0 \u2202x2v s +(x, t) = \u2202x2v s \u2212(x, t) = 0\nfor x \u2208 R20\\C and t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {(c1, 0), (c2, 0)}).\nThis implies that\nws(x, t) =  vs+(x, t), x \u2208 R2+, vs\u2212(x, t), x \u2208 R2\u2212, 0, x \u2208 R20\\C, t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {(c1, 0), (c2, 0)}),\nis the unique solution to the wave equation problem (2.12) for t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {(c1, 0), (c2, 0)}). Hence, the condition\n{x \u2208 R2 | ws(x, t) 6= 0} \u2286 \u039bs(t) for all t \u2264 c\u22121dist(Cinc, {(c1, 0), (c2, 0)})\nfor the function ws follows from the corresponding properties, established above, for the functions vs\u00b1, and the proof of the lemma is complete.\nFor ease of reference, in the following lemma we present the Huygens Condition 2.2 in the form that will be used in the proof of Theorem 2.8. In order to match the setting of the theorem, for an integer j we introduce the notation\nj\u2032 = mod(j, 2) + 1 (j \u2208 N), (2.17)\nwhere, for integers a and b, mod(a, b) denotes the remainder of the division of a by b. In our context, where the index values j = 1, 2 refer to the corresponding arcs \u03931, \u03932, we have j\u2032 = 1 (resp. j\u2032 = 2) for j = 2 (resp. j = 1).\nLemma 2.5. Let j \u2208 {1, 2}, p \u2208 R, and T0 > 0, and assume that, for j \u2208 {1, 2}, (a) gj \u2208 Hp\u03c3,T0(R, H\n1/2(\u0393j)) satisfies gj(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u039312 \u00d7 R; (2.18)\nand, (b) \u0393j satisfies Condition 2.2. Then, recalling equation (2.3), letting t0 = \u03b412/c > 0, and calling wsj \u2208 H p\u22123 \u03c3,T0 (R, H1(\u2126j)) the unique solution of the wave equation problem (2.4), we have\nwsj (x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393trj\u2032 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T0 + t0].

In other words, usM |(\u2212\u221e,T (M)] = us|(\u2212\u221e,T (M)] \u2208 Hp\u22123M0 (T (M), H\n1(\u2126)). But from Theorem 2.1(a) we also know that us \u2208 Hp\u22123/2\u03c3,0 (R, H1(\u2126)), and, thus, us|(\u2212\u221e,T (M)] \u2208 H p\u22123/2 0 (T (M), H\n1(\u2126)). It follows that, as claimed, usM is a solution of the wave equation that coincides with us up to time T (M) and satisfies usM |(\u2212\u221e,T (M)] \u2208 H p\u22123/2 0 (T (M), H 1(\u2126)).\nThe validity of the relation (2.26), and thus, the proof of the theorem, are established in what follows by induction on the integer M . We first verify the relation (2.26) in the case M = 2. Since us2(x, t) = vs1(x, t) + v s 2(x, t) for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393\u00d7 R, to establish the M = 2 result it suffices to show that\nvs1(x, t) + v s 2(x, t) + u i(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393\u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b412/c], (2.27)\nwhich, in view of (2.22), results from the conditions\nvs1(x, t) + v s 2(x, t) + u i(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u03932 \u00d7 R (2.28)\nand\nvs2(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393tr1 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b412/c]. (2.29)\nEquation (2.28) follows immediately from Definition 2.6 since per (2.21) and (2.22) we have vs2(x, t) = f2(x, t) = \u2212ui(x, t)\u2212vs1(x, t) on \u03932 for all t \u2208 R. To verify (2.29), we note from (2.24) that f2(x, t) vanishes for (x, t) \u2208 \u039312 \u00d7 R. Then in view of Lemma 2.5, equation (2.29) results and thus, the proof for the case M = 2 follows.\nUsing the notation j\u2032(m) = mod(j(m), 2) + 1 (equation (2.17)), to complete the inductive proof we assume that for any M \u2208 N with 2 \u2264M \u2264 L,L \u2265 2, the following two relations hold:\nusM (x, t) + u i(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393j(M) \u00d7 R, (2.30)\nand\nvsM (x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393trj\u2032(M) \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, (M \u2212 1)\u03b412/c]. (2.31)\nWe then show that the same relations and, as a result, the relation (2.26), hold for M = L+ 1. To do this we note that equation (2.23) tells us that vsL+1(x, t) + v s L(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393j(L+1) \u00d7 R. Therefore, the M = L\u2212 1 condition (2.30) implies that\nusL+1(x, t) + u i(x, t) = vsL+1(x, t) + v s L(x, t) + u s L\u22121(x, t) + u i(x, t) = 0 (2.32)\nfor (x, t) \u2208 \u0393j(L+1) \u00d7R. Noting that j\u2032(L) = j(L+ 1) and using (2.24) and (2.31) with M = L we see that fL+1(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393j(L+1) \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, (L\u2212 1)\u03b412/c] \u222a \u039312 \u00d7 R, and, thus, Lemma 2.5 tells us that\nvsL+1(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393trj\u2032(L+1) \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, L\u03b412/c] (2.33)\n\u2014or, in other words, the relations (2.30) and (2.31) hold for M = L + 1. Combining the relation (2.31) and the condition (2.30) for M = L, it follows that\nusL+1(x, t) + u i(x, t) = vsL+1(x, t) + u s L(x, t) + u i(x, t) = 0 (2.34)\nfor (x, t) \u2208 \u0393trj\u2032(L+1)\u00d7(\u2212\u221e, L\u03b412/c]. The relation (2.26) forM = L+1 results from (2.32) and (2.34), which completes the proof.\nRemark 2.9. As detailed in Section 3.2, a variant of the setting considered in Theorem 2.8, involving certain \u201cextended\u201d open arcs \u0393\u0303j, is utilized in the actual numerical implementation we propose. The use of extended arcs eliminates numerical accuracy losses that arise from the solution singularities that exist at the open-arc endpoints. As indicated in that section, the theorem and proof remain essentially unchanged.\nThe proposed multiple scattering strategy for the solution of the wave equation problem (2.1) for (x, t) \u2208 \u2126 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T (M)] (M = 2, 3, . . . ), which is embodied in Theorem 2.8, the associated ping-pong solutions vsm, and the sum (2.25) (m = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M), is summarized in Algorithm 1. Note that, in this algorithm, the necessary solutions vsm(x, t) are obtained by means of the hybrid frequency-time approach presented in Section 2.5.\nAlgorithm 1 Multiple scattering algorithm 1: Do m = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M 2: Evaluate the boundary data fm via relations (2.22)-(2.23). 3: Compute vsm(x, t), (x, t) \u2208 (\u2126 \u222a \u0393j\u2032(m))\u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T (M)] in Definition 2.6 using the open-arc hybrid\nsolver presented in Section 2.5. 4: End Do 5: Compute usM (x, t), (x, t) \u2208 \u2126\u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T (M)] using equation (2.25)."

(2.42)\nClearly, the function fm(x, t) may represent a signal of arbitrarily long duration: this is merely a smooth compactly supported function for t \u2208 [0, T ], with a potentially large value of T > 0. For such large values of T the Fourier transform Fm(x, \u03c9) is generally a highly oscillatory function of \u03c9, as a result of the fast oscillations in the Fourier transform integrand factor ei\u03c9t\u2014see e.g. [6, Fig. 1]. Under such a scenario a very fine frequency-discretization, requiring O(T ) frequency points, and, thus, a number O(T ) of evaluations of the frequency-domain boundary integral equation solver, is required to obtain the time-domain solution vsm(x, t). This makes the overall algorithm unacceptably expensive for long-time simulations. To overcome these difficulties, a certain \u201cwindowing and time-recentering\u201d procedure was proposed in [6, Sec. 3.1], that decomposes a scattering problem involving an incident time signal of long duration into a sequence of problems with smooth incident field of a limited duration, all of which can be solved in terms of a fixed set of solutions of the corresponding frequency-domain problems for arbitrarily large values of T .\nFor a given final time T , the windowing-and-recentering approach is based on use of a smooth partition of unity P = {\u03c7k(t) | k \u2208 K},K = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K}, where the functions \u03c7k satisfy \u2211 k\u2208K \u03c7k(t) = 1 for t \u2208 [0, T ]\nand where, for a certain sequence sk (k \u2208 K), each \u03c7k(t) is a non-negative, smooth windowing function of t, supported in the interval [sk \u2212H, sk +H] of duration 2H. The partition-of-unity P can be generated on the basis of the smooth function \u03b7(t; t0, t1) given by\n\u03b7(t; t0, t1) =  1, |t| \u2264 t0, e 2e\u22121/s s\u22121 , t0 < |t| < t1, s = |t|\u2212t0t1\u2212t0 ,\n0, |t| \u2265 t1.\n(2.43)\nWithout loss of generality, in this work we set\nH = T\n3K/2\u2212 1 , sk =\n3 2 (k \u2212 1)H, (2.44)\nand\n\u03c7k(t) = \u03c7(t\u2212 sk), \u03c7(s) =  \u03b7(s/H; 1/2, 1), \u2212H/2 \u2264 s \u2264 H, 1\u2212 \u03b7(s/H + 3/2; 1/2, 1), \u2212H < s < \u2212H/2, 0, |s| \u2265 H,\n\u2014a prescription that clearly ensures that sK +H/2 = T and \u2211K\nk=1 \u03c7k(t) = 1 for all t \u2208 [0, T ]. A depiction of such a partition of unity, with H = 10, is presented in Figure 2.\nUtilizing the partition-of-unity P, any smooth long-time signal f(t), t \u2208 [0, T ], can be expressed in the form f(t) = \u2211 k\u2208K fk(t), fk(t) = f(t)\u03c7k(t), (2.45)\nwhere fk is compactly supported in [sk\u2212H, sk +H].

Indeed, an accurate Fourier approximation of a certain period P > 2A can be obtained on the basis of the FC(Gram) Fourier Continuation method [3, 23] from which the approximation errors decay as a user-prescribed negative power of L\u0303. Substituting (3.6) into (3.5) and integrating term-wise gives the approximation\nIba[F ](t) = e \u2212i\u03b4t L\u0303/2\u22121\u2211 m=\u2212L\u0303/2 cm \u222b A \u2212A e\u2212i 2\u03c0 P (\u03b1t\u2212m)\u03c9d\u03c9\n= e\u2212i\u03b4t L\u0303/2\u22121\u2211 m=\u2212L\u0303/2 cm P \u03c0(\u03b1t\u2212m) sin ( 2\u03c0A P (\u03b1t\u2212m) ) , (3.7)\nwith errors that are uniform in the time variable t.

This algorithm results in high-order convergence in spite of the logarithmic singular character of the function F . In detail, letting nch denote the selected number of Clenshaw-Curtis mesh points and assuming that q > nch + 1, the errors resulting from this approximation strategy decay as O(Q\u2212(nch+1)) as nch \u2192 +\u221e.\nAlgorithm 3 also requires the evaluation of the Fourier transform\nFk,slow(f)(\u03c9) := \u222b H \u2212H f(t+ sk)\u03c7k(t)e i\u03c9tdt\nfor the smooth boundary-values function f . This computation proceeds in a manner analogous to that used for the evaluation of IWwc [F ](t), except that, instead of Fourier continuation approximation of the function F used in that case, here a regular Fourier expansion\nf(t+ sk)\u03c7k(t) = L\u0302/2\u22121\u2211 m=\u2212L\u0302/2 c\u0302kme i \u03c0 H mt, (3.8)\nof periodicity interval [\u2212H,H], is used\u2014which results in high-order convergence on account of the smooth vanishing of the function \u03c7k(t) at the endpoints of the interval [\u2212H,H]. The approximation of Fk,slow(f)(\u03c9) is then obtained via an expression analogous to (3.7)\u2014with uniform errors for all \u03c9 \u2208 R, which are determined solely by the error in the approximation (3.8)."

            "text": "The numerical implementation of the hybrid multiple scattering strategy additionally requires evaluation of the layer-potentials Sj , j = 1, 2 and the integral operators Sj , j = 1, 2 (equations (2.37)and (2.39), respectively), both of which can be expressed as integrals of the form\nH(x, \u03c9) = \u222b\n\u0393j\n\u03a6\u03c9(x, y)\u03c8(y, \u03c9)dsy, x \u2208 \u0393j , x \u2208 \u2126 or x \u2208 \u0393\\\u0393j , (3.9)\nfor certain densities \u03c8(y, \u03c9). Depending on the location of observation point x, the integral H(x, \u03c9) may be weakly-singular, nearly-singular or non-singular. The numerical evaluation of H(x, \u03c9) with high accuracy can be achieved by means of a suitably modified version of the two-dimensional Chebyshev-based rectangular-polar discretization method [25] (cf. [18]) which adequately accounts for the singular character of the unknown potential \u03c8 at the endpoints of the open-arcs \u0393j . In detail [29], the density function \u03c8 can be expressed in the forms \u03c8 = \u03b1/w near the endpoints where \u03b1 is a smooth function and w \u223c d1/2j where dj denotes the distance to the endpoint of \u0393j . Then a special change of variables introduced in [24, Eq. (4.12)] (see also [4,21]), which eliminates the 1/w singularity, is utilized here to evaluate the integrals H(x, \u03c9) with high-order accuracy.\nIn view of the aforementioned density singularity, it can be easily shown that the collected boundary data Fm (m \u2265 1) is also singular: it behaves like d1/2j(m) near the endpoints of the arc \u0393j(m). Graded meshes near the endpoints could be employed to ensure high-order accuracy in the solution of the associated boundary integral equations. But a different approach is utilized in this paper, whereby the edge singularity in the boundary data may be entirely avoided by slightly and smoothly extending the boundary \u0393j in the\ndirection normal to \u0393j\u2014as illustrated in Figure 3. More precisely, letting x = x(s) and \u03bd = \u03bd(s) denote a parametrization of \u0393 = \u03931 \u222a \u03932 and its normal vector, respectively, the curve \u0393j is prolonged beyond its endpoints into an extended open arc \u0393\u0303j . Here the extension arc, denoted by \u0393ej = \u0393\u0303j\\\u0393j , is given by\ny(s) = x(s) + a(s) \u00b7 \u03bd(s) (3.10)\nfor s in a neighborhood beyond each parameter value s = s0 corresponding to an endpoint of \u0393j . In order to ensure sufficient smoothness, leading to high-order accuracy, a certain number of derivatives of the function a are required to vanish at s = s0. The extended arcs \u0393\u0303j used are such that their endpoints are far from the region where the corresponding fields must be evaluated. Since the problems for the extended open-arcs are handled with high accuracy (by means of the numerical method [18, 25]), and since the corresponding solutions are evaluated away from the extended-arc singular points, the difficulties arising from endpoint singularities are completely eliminated.\nRemark 3.1. The incident field ui can easily be extended to each one of the two curves \u0393\u0303j, j = 1, 2; the corresponding extensions will be denoted in what follows by uij, j = 1, 2. The necessary extensions can be obtained either by simply evaluating on the extended curves an incident field function ui defined in all of R2, whenever, as is often the case, such a function is provided, or, alternatively, by using a Sobolev extension theorem such as [49, Theorem 3.10] on each curve \u0393\u0303j.\nThis extension procedure, which provides great flexibility, does not negatively affect any aspect of the proposed multiple scattering algorithm. Indeed, letting \u2126\u0303j = R2\\\u0393\u0303j and considering the wave equation problem {\n\u22022w\u0303sj \u2202t2\n(x, t)\u2212 c2\u2206w\u0303sj (x, t) = 0, (x, t) \u2208 \u2126\u0303j \u00d7 R, w\u0303sj (x, t) = g\u0303j(x, t), (x, t) \u2208 \u0393\u0303j \u00d7 R,\n(3.11)\nwe have the following result analogous to Lemma 2.5.\nLemma 3.2. Let j \u2208 {1, 2}, p \u2208 R, and T0 > 0, and assume that, for j \u2208 {1, 2}, (a) g\u0303j \u2208 Hp\u03c3,T0(R, H\n1/2(\u0393\u0303j)) satisfies g\u0303j(x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 (\u039312 \u222a \u0393ej)\u00d7 R; (3.12)\nand, (b) \u0393\u0303j satisfies Condition 2.2. Then, recalling equation (2.3), letting t0 = \u03b412/c > 0, and calling w\u0303sj \u2208 H p\u22123 \u03c3,T0 (R, H1(\u2126\u0303j)) the unique solution of the wave equation problem (3.11), we have\nw\u0303sj (x, t) = 0 for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393trj\u2032 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T0 + t0]. (3.13)\nDefinition 2.6, in turn, needs to be adjusted as follows.\nDefinition 3.3. For m \u2208 N we inductively define v\u0303sm(x, t) as equal to the solution w\u0303sj(m)(x, t) of the open-arc problem (3.11) with boundary data\nv\u0303sm(x, t) = f\u0303m(x, t) for (x, t) \u2208 \u0393\u0303j(m) \u00d7 R, (m \u2208 N), (3.14)\nwhere f\u0303m(x, t) : \u0393\u0303j(m) \u00d7 R\u2192 C denotes the causal functions defined inductively via the relations\nf\u03031(x, t) = \u2212ui1(x, t) on \u0393\u03031, (3.15)\nf\u03032(x, t) = { \u2212ui2(x, t)\u2212 v\u0303s1(x, t), x \u2208 \u03932, 0, x \u2208 \u0393e2,\n(3.16)\nand,\nf\u0303m(x, t) = { \u2212v\u0303sm\u22121(x, t), x \u2208 \u0393j(m), 0, x \u2208 \u0393ej(m), m \u2265 3. (3.17)\nThe new inductive relations give rise to the following slightly modified version of Theorem 2.8.\nTheorem 3.4. Let M \u2208 N, M \u2265 2, p \u2208 R, and let T = T (M) = (M \u2212 1)\u03b412/c. Denote an M -th order multiple-scattering sum\nu\u0303sM (x, t) := M\u2211 m=1 v\u0303sm(x, t), (3.18)\nwhich includes contributions from all M \u201cping-pong\u201d scattering iterates v\u0303sm(x, t) with m = 1, . . . ,M . Then, given ui \u2208 Hp\u03c3,0(R, H1/2(\u0393)) and uij \u2208 H p \u03c3,0(R, H1/2(\u0393\u0303j)), j = 1, 2 as indicated in Remark 3.1, we have u\u0303sM \u2208 H p\u22123/2 0 (T (M), H 1(\u2126)) and us(x, t) = u\u0303sM (x, t) for all (x, t) \u2208 \u2126\u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, T (M)].\nThe proof of this theorem is essentially identical to the proof of Theorem 2.8, and it is therefore omitted for brevity.\nIncorporating the Fourier transform and time-windowing and recentering strategies introduced in previous sections, we are led to a new version of the hybrid multiple scattering algorithm which, except for straightforward modifications related to arc extensions, is entirely analogous to Algorithm 3, and whose slightly modified pseudocode is once again omitted. The overall algorithm for evaluation of the numerical solution us of equation (2.1), incorporating the extended arcs \u0393\u0303j , is presented as Algorithm 4 in Section 3.3.\nClearly, the weakly-singular integrals H(x, \u03c9) need to be evaluated at a sufficiently large number of frequency discretization-points \u03c9 in the interval [\u2212W,W ]. The computational cost required for such evaluations can be reduced by utilizing the decomposition\n\u03a6\u03c9(x, y) = \u03a80(x, y) + \u03ba 2\u03a81(x, y) +H\u03c9(x, y), (3.19)\nwhere\n\u03a80(x, y) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0 log |x\u2212 y|, (3.20)\n\u03a81(x, y) = |x\u2212 y|2\n8\u03c0 log |x\u2212 y|, (3.21)\nand\nH\u03c9(x, y) =  \u03a6\u03c9(x, y)\u2212 \u03a60(x, y)\u2212 \u03ba2\u03a61(x, y), x 6= y,\ni 4 \u2212 1 2\u03c0 (ce + log(\u03ba/2)), x = y,\n(3.22)\n(ce = 0.57721566 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 is the Euler constant). The function H\u03c9 is more regular than the Green function \u03a6\u03c9(x, y) itself, and its integration under a given error tolerance is therefore less onerous. The discretization matrices associated with the weakly-singular and nearly-singular integrals of the form\nH`(x, \u03c9) = \u222b\n\u0393\u0303j\n\u03a8`(x, y)\u03c8(y, \u03c9)dsy, x \u2208 \u0393\u0303j , \u2126 or \u0393\\(\u0393\u0303j), ` = 0, 1, (3.23)\nin turn, are independent of frequency, and can thus be precomputed before the ping-pong iterative process is initiated.\nIn this work, the two-dimensional Chebyshev-based rectangular-polar integral solver [18,25] is employed for the evaluation of all singular integrals. The remaining integrals involving the smoother kernelsH\u03c9 can be integrated efficiently and accurately by means of Fejer\u2019s quadrature rule, and they can be further accelerated e.g. by the methods presented in [14,22,44] and references therein, but such accelerations were not utilized in this work. In our numerical implementation, prior to the ping-pong iteration process we additionally use\nthe Lapack function ZGESV to pre-compute the inverses A\u22121j (\u03c9) of the coefficient matrixes Aj(\u03c9) (j = 1, 2) resulting from the discretizations of the integral operators\nH1(x, \u03c9) + \u03ba2H2(x, \u03c9) + \u222b\n\u0393\u0303j\nH\u03c9(x, y)\u03c8(y, \u03c9)dsy, x \u2208 \u0393\u0303j , j = 1, 2; (3.24)\nthese inverse matrices are then used repeatedly to obtain the numerical solution \u03c8\u0303m,k(x, \u03c9) of the integral equation \u222b\n\u0393\u0303j(m)\n\u03a6\u03c9(x, y)\u03c8\u0303m,k(y, \u03c9)dsy = F\u0303m,k(x, \u03c9) on \u0393\u0303j(m) (3.25)\nwith F\u0303m,k = Fk,slow(f\u0303m) and j = j(m) for all k \u2208 K and all m = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M ."

We now consider test cases that demonstrate the accuracy of the time-domain solver for the problem scattering by a single open-arc \u03931 depicted in Figure 1(c). We consider incident fields of two different kinds, namely, 1) A Gaussian-modulated point source ui1(x, t) equal to the Fourier transform of the function\nU i(x, \u03c9) = 5i\n2 H\n(1) 0 (\u03c9|x\u2212 z|)e\n\u2212 (\u03c9\u2212\u03c90) 2\n\u03c32 ei\u03c9t0 (4.2)\nwith respect to \u03c9, with \u03c3 = 2, \u03c90 = 15, t0 = 4 and z = (0, 0); and 2) A plane-wave incident field\nui2(x, t) = \u2212 sin(4g(x, t))e\u22121.6(g(x,t)\u22123) 2 , g(x, t) = t\u2212 tlag \u2212 x \u00b7 dinc (4.3)\nalong the incident direction dinc = (1, 0) with tlag = 2. Together with a sufficiently fine fixed spatial discretization, the fixed numerical frequency intervals \u03c9 \u2208 [5, 25] and \u03c9 \u2208 [\u221220, 20] were used for the incident fields ui1 and ui2, respectively. Figures 5 and 6 present the scattered field as a function of time t at the observation point x = (0.5, 0) and the corresponding numerical errors at that point, respectively, as functions of the number of frequencies used\u2014demonstrating the fast convergence of the algorithms as the frequency-domain discretization is refined.\nExample 3. This example presents the solutions produced by the full hybrid ping-pong multiple scattering algorithm for the wave equation problem (2.1) in two different domains \u2126, namely, the unit disc centered at the origin and the unit square \u2126 = [\u22121, 1]2, for t \u2208 [0, 10], and for each one of the two timedomain sources considered in Example 2: the point source ui1(x, t) and the plane wave source ui2(x, t). For the plane-wave incidence case the exact solution is given by us(x, t) = \u2212ui2(x, t) for x \u2208 \u2126. In this example, the extensions \u0393\u0303j of \u0393j for j = 1, 2 are constructed by means of portions of tangent circular arcs of radii 0.1. For the wave equation problem (2.1) in a unit disc domain, the numerical errors as a function of M are displayed in Figures 7 and 8: clearly, rapid convergence and high accuracy are observed. Figures 9 and 10 display the total field within the rectangular domain \u2126 at various times, for two different point-source locations z, and two different values of \u03c90 in (4.2), and using a total of M = 10 ping-pong iterations; we have verified that, in this case, the numerical errors are less than 10\u22128 for all t \u2208 [0, 10].\nExample 4. We now use Algorithm 4 to solve wave equation problems in a disc-shaped domain (Figure 1(c)) and a T-shaped domain (Figure 11(a)), up to final times T = 10, and using M = 7 ping-pong iterations. The incident wave is a pulse function given by\nui(x, t) = f(t\u2212 |x\u2212 z0|/c), f(s) = sin(4s)e\u22121.6(s\u22123) 2 , (4.4)\nwhich is displayed in Figure 11(b). Figure 11(c) displays the corresponding Fourier transform, in view of which the fixed numerical bandwidth value W = 15 was used for this example. Figures 12-14 display the total field within \u2126 at various times and for different source point locations.\nExample 5. This example concerns a long time propagation and scattering problem in a unit disc domain under the incident wave (4.4) with z0 = (0, 0). For this example we have used \u03b412 = 2 sin \u03c010 \u2248 0.618, M = 45, K = 4 (so that sK + H = 55), W = 20, J = 454, and \u2206t = 0.11, and we have computed the necessary frequency domain solutions using open-arc discretizations Mj , j = 1, 2, each one of which contains 224 discretization points. Note that the exact solution values at the points x = (\u2212 \u221a 3/4, 1/4) and x = (0.5, 0) coincide (since |(\u2212 \u221a\n3/4, 1/4)| = |(0.5, 0)| = 0.5). This simple symmetry relation provides a valuable verification of the numerical solution\u2014which, as illustrated Figure 15, is closely satisfied by the numerical solution. Tables 2 and 3, finally, present the numerical solution errors maxt\u2208[0,T (M)] |usnum\u2212 usref | for the present problem at the point x = (0.5, 0), for various values of M and corresponding final times T (M), together with other statistics such as precomputation time and total computational times. Note in particular that the solution errors do not grow as the final times increase.\nExample 6. In our final example we briefly demonstrate the feasibility of a version of the proposed multiple scattering algorithm which utilizes more than two patches. This extended algorithm requires use of appropriately windowed boundary data for the open-surface wave equation problems associated with multiple patches. At each step, the multiple wave equation problems can be solved in parallel. Complete details concerning the algorithm and its implementation will be presented elsewhere [12]. In the example\npresented here a three-patch decomposition of the boundary \u0393, as shown in Figure 16, is utilized to solve once again the wave equation problem (2.1) on the unit disc, under plane-wave incidence ui2(x, t), considered in Example 2, and the exact solution is given by us(x, t) = \u2212ui2(x, t) for x \u2208 \u2126. The numerical solutions at x = (0.5, 0) as functions of time t for various values of M are displayed in Figure 17.

            "text": "This paper proposed a frequency-time hybrid integral-equation method for the wave equation problem in an interior two-dimensional bounded spatial domain. The solver is based on a novel ping-pong multiple scattering strategy that reduces the original problem to a sequence of problems of scattering by open-arcs. Exploiting the Huygens principle, relying on a domain decomposition strategy based on use of overlapping patches, and utilizing boundary integral equation formulations for frequency-domain sub-problems and an efficient Fourier transform algorithm, the proposed method produces the interior time-domain solution efficiently and with high accuracy. An extension of the ping-pong algorithm that incorporates arbitrary\nnumbers of overlapping subdomains should enable application of the method to complex 2D and 3D geometries. The method can also be extended to enable solution of elastic and electromagnetic wave problems, and including problems of scattering by impenetrable obstacles, problems of transmission for penetrable structures and problems in multi-layered media. Such extensions, which lie beyond the scope of this paper, are left for future work."

            "text": "This appendix obtains the explicit expression (2.16), used in the proof of Lemma 2.4, for the solution vs+(x, t) of problem (2.15), where g is a causal function (g(x, t) = 0 for t \u2264 0) defined on R20 \u00d7 R, which satisfies the assumption (2.13) for a bounded subset Cinc \u2282 R20. The construction utilizes the associated frequency-domain Green\u2019s function G\u03c9(x, y), which, for each y \u2208 R2+, is defined as the solution of the problem {\n\u2206xG\u03c9(x, y) + \u03ba 2G\u03c9(x, y) = \u2212\u03b4y(x), (x, \u03c9) \u2208 R2+ \u00d7 R, \u03ba = \u03c9/c, G\u03c9(x, y) = 0 (x, \u03c9) \u2208 R0 \u00d7 R.\nAs is well known, the method of images yields\nG\u03c9(x, y) = i\n4 H\n(1) 0 (\u03ba|x\u2212 y|)\u2212\ni 4 H (1) 0 (\u03ba|x \u2032 \u2212 y|), x 6= y, (A.1)\nwhere x\u2032 = (x1,\u2212x2) denotes the image point of x = (x1, x2) \u2208 R2+ with respect to R20, and where H (1) 0 denotes the Hankel function of first kind and order zero. Let now V s+(x, \u03c9) denote the Fourier transform of vs+(x, t) with respect to t for x \u2208 R2+; clearly V s+ is a solution of the Helmholtz equation with wavenumber \u03ba in R2+, and with Dirichlet boundary conditions V s+ = g\u0302 on R20\u2014where g\u0302(x, \u03c9) denotes the Fourier transform of g(x, t) with respect to t. Clearly g\u0302(x, \u03c9) vanishes for x 6\u2208 Cinc since, in view of (2.13), so does g(x, t). Use of Green\u2019s theorem together with the Green function G\u03c9 [30] yields\nV s+(x, \u03c9) = \u222b Cinc \u2202\u03bdyG\u03c9(x, y)g\u0302(y, \u03c9)dsy, x \u2208 R2+, (A.2)\nwhere, denoting by \u03bdy = (0, 1)> the unit upward normal on R20,\n\u2202\u03bdyG\u03c9(x, y) = i\u03ba\n2 x2 |x\u2212 y| H (1) 1 (\u03ba|x\u2212 y|).\nIt follows that, for x \u2208 R2+, vs+(x, t) equals the inverse Fourier transform of (A.2). To proceed with the construction we introduce the following notations. We call R30 = R20 \u00d7 R the plane in three dimensional space with cross-section R20, we let x\u0306 = (x>, 0)> /\u2208 R30, y\u0306 = (y>, z)> \u2208 R30 and r\u0306 = \u221a r2 + z2 with\nr = |x\u2212y| = \u221a\n(x1 \u2212 y1)2 + (x2 \u2212 y2)2. Using the unit normal \u03bdy = (0, 1)> of R20, finally, the corresponding unit normal on R30 is denoted by \u03bdy\u0306 = (0, 1, 0)>.\nIn preparation for the main result of this appendix we establish the following Lemma.\nLemma A.1. The following formulas hold:\n1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 dz = i 4 H (1) 0 (\u03bar), (A.3)\n1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u2202yi ( ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 ) dz = i 4 \u2202yiH (1) 0 (\u03bar), i = 1, 2. (A.4)\nProof. The expression (A.3) is established in [27, Lemma 3.1]. Using the notations\nr\u03060 = (x 2 1 + (x2 \u2212 y2)2 + z2)1/2,\nto establish the y1 component of (A.4) (the y2 component follows analogously), it suffices to show that\u222b y1 0 dy1 \u222b \u221e 1 \u2202y1 ( ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 ) dz = \u222b \u221e 1 ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 dz \u2212 \u222b \u221e 1 ei\u03bar\u03060 r\u03060 dz; (A.5)\nthe result then follows by differentiation with respect to y1. To establish (A.5), we seek to utilize Fubini\u2019s Theorem on the left hand integral, but, unfortunately, the integrand does not satisfy the hypothesis of Fubini\u2019s theorem: it is not an integrable function of the variable (y1, z). To address this difficulty we integrate by parts the left-hand integral: using the relation\nei\u03bar\u0306 = r\u0306\ni\u03baz \u2202ze\ni\u03bar\u0306, (A.6)\nwe obtain \u222b \u221e 1 \u2202y1 ( ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 ) dz = \u222b \u221e 1 1 i\u03baz \u2202z\u2202y1e i\u03bar\u0306dz = \u2212 1 i\u03ba \u2202y1e i\u03bar\u0306 \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=1 + \u222b \u221e 1 1 i\u03baz2 \u2202y1e i\u03bar\u0306dz.\nFubini\u2019s Theorem can now be applied to the last integral, and we thus obtain\u222b y1 0 dy1 \u222b \u221e 1 \u2202y1 ( ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 ) dz = \u2212 1 i\u03ba ei\u03bar\u0306 \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=1 + 1 i\u03ba ei\u03bar\u03060 \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=1 + \u222b y1 0 dy1 \u222b \u221e 1 1 i\u03baz2 \u2202y1e i\u03bar\u0306dz\n= \u2212 1 i\u03ba ei\u03bar\u0306 \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=1 + 1 i\u03ba ei\u03bar\u03060 \u2223\u2223\u2223 z=1 + \u222b \u221e 1 1 i\u03baz2 (ei\u03bar\u0306 \u2212 ei\u03bar\u03060)dz.\nNow, replacing z\u22122 = \u2212\u2202zz\u22121 and integrating by parts in the last integral, and then using (A.6) once again, equation (A.5) results, as desired. The proof is now complete.\nTo establish (2.16) we proceed as follows. In view of Lemma A.1 and equation (A.1), and noting that for x \u2208 R2+, y \u2208 R20 we have x2 \u2212 y2 6= 0, the normal derivative of the Green function on the boundary R20 is given by\n\u2202\u03bdyG\u03c9(x, y) = i\u03ba\n2 x2 r H (1) 1 (\u03bar) = i 2 \u2202y2H (1) 0 (\u03bar) = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u2202y2 ( ei\u03bar\u0306 r\u0306 ) dz = \u2212 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e i\u03bar\u0306 \u2212 1 r\u03063 x2e i\u03bar\u0306dz\nand, therefore, equation (A.2) gives\nV s+(x, \u03c9) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b Cinc\u00d7R i\u03bar\u0306 \u2212 1 r\u03063 x2e i\u03bar\u0306 g\u0302(y, \u03c9)dsy\u0306, x \u2208 R2+.\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform we obtain\nvs+(x, t) = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b Cinc\u00d7R \u222b t 0 [ 1 r\u03063 \u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 c\u22121r\u0306) + 1 cr\u03062 \u03b4\u2032(t\u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 c\u22121r\u0306) ] x2 g(y, \u03c4)d\u03c4dsy\u0306\n= 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b Cinc\u00d7R [ 1 r\u03063 g(y, t\u2212 c\u22121r\u0306) + 1 cr\u03062 g(1)(y, t\u2212 c\u22121r\u0306) ] x2dsy\u0306.\nwhere g(1)(x, t) = \u2202g\u2202t (x, t). Using the relations dsy\u0306 = dzdsy we thus obtain\nvs+(x, t) = 1\n\u03c0 \u222b Cinc \u222b +\u221e 0 [ (r2 + z2)\u22123/2g(y, t\u2212 c\u22121 \u221a r2 + z2)\n+ 1\nc(r2 + z2) g(1)(y, t\u2212 c\u22121\n\u221a r2 + z2) ] x2dzdsy.\nUtilizing the change of variables \u03c4 = t \u2212 c\u22121 \u221a r2 + z2, or equivalently z = c \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122r2, and dz = \u2212cz\u22121 \u221a r2 + z2d\u03c4 , we then obtain\n(r2 + z2)\u22123/2dz = \u2212 1 c2(t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122r2 d\u03c4\nand 1\nc(r2 + z2) dz = \u2212 1 c2(t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122r2 d\u03c4.\nIt then follows that, for x \u2208 R2+,\nvs+(x, t) = 1\n\u03c0c2 (A.7)\u222b\nCinc \u222b t\u2212c\u22121|x\u2212y| 0 [ x2 g(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2 +\nx2 g (1)(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2\n] d\u03c4dsy, (A.8)\nas desired.\nRemark A.2. Although not used in this paper, it is worthwhile to note here that, for an arbitrary twodimensional Lipschitz curve \u0393, and letting \u0393\u0306 = \u0393 \u00d7 R, the changes of variables used in this appendix can easily be utilized to obtain an expression for the time-domain double-layer potential in two-dimensions, which had heretofore not been successfully derived. Utilizing once again the notations used above, from the Kirchhoff formula [55, Eq. (22), Sec. 8.1], we know that the classical three-dimensional time-domain double-layer potential is given by\nD3D(\u03c6)(x\u0306, t) = 1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u0393\u0306 [ \u2202(r\u0306\u22121) \u2202\u03bdy\u0306 \u03c6(y\u0306, t\u2212 c\u22121r\u0306)\u2212 1 cr\u0306 \u2202r\u0306 \u2202\u03bdy\u0306 \u03c6(1)(y\u0306, t\u2212 c\u22121r\u0306) ] dsy\u0306.\nThe two-dimensional double-layer potential D2D can then be obtained by assuming that the causal signal \u03c6 is independent of z. Then using the change of variables \u03c4 = t\u2212 c\u22121 \u221a r2 + z2 we obtain\nD2D(\u03c6)(x, t)\n= 1\n2\u03c0c2 \u222b \u0393 \u222b t\u2212c\u22121|x\u2212y| 0 [ (x\u2212 y) \u00b7 \u03bdy\u03c6(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2 + (x\u2212 y) \u00b7 \u03bdy\u03c6(1)(y, \u03c4) (t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221a (t\u2212 \u03c4)2 \u2212 c\u22122|x\u2212 y|2 ] d\u03c4dsy.\nwhich provides a correction to the expression presented in [51, Page 19]. The contributions [8, Sections 6.3- 6.5], [38, Page 42] and references therein outline some of the difficulties previously encountered in regard to the 2D double-layer potential."
