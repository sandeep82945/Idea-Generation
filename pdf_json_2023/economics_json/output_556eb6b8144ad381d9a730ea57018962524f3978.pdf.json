    "abstractText": "Background Private clinics are important places for residents to obtain daily medical care. However, previous researches mainly focused on public medical institutions but ignored the issue of systematic allocation of social medi\u2010 cal resources such as clinics. It is critical to understand the private clinics distribution to analyze the rational allocation of medical resources and the spatial difference. Methods Based on the field survey, land census, population density, and economic data from Guiyang, this study analyzes the spatial pattern of private clinics in the main urban area of Guiyang and the influencing factors by using spatial analysis methods such as kernel density, standard deviation ellipses, and geo\u2010detector. Results The private clinics in the main urban area of Guiyang are characterized by \"inner dense, outer sparse dense,\" showing an overall spatial clustering feature of \"four cores and two belts with many points\" and \"dense inside and sparse outside.\" Different types of private clinics have distinct spatial distribution characteristics and agglomeration forms. The growth of private clinics is closely linked to the population growth of mountainous cities. The most impor\u2010 tant factors influencing the spatial pattern of private clinics are residential land factors, followed by traffic factors and population density. The impact of economic, natural, and spatial factors is minimal. When using a geo\u2010detector, the results of multi\u2010factor interaction differ from those of single factors, and factor interactions have greater explanatory power than single factors in clinic distribution. Conclusion This study investigates the geographic distribution and influencing variables of private clinics in typical mountain cities and identifies the causes of the current disparity in the distribution of healthcare resources. It is neces\u2010 sary to gradually develop the primary healthcare system in mountainous cities with legislation, counterpart support, and social resources. While ensuring equal access to health care for low\u2010income people and mobile populations, vari\u2010 ous medical needs of community members should be fully considered and implemented as soon as possible.",

The growth of private clinics is closely linked to the population growth of mountainous cities. The most impor\u2011 tant factors influencing the spatial pattern of private clinics are residential land factors, followed by traffic factors and population density. The impact of economic, natural, and spatial factors is minimal. When using a geo\u2011detector, the results of multi\u2011factor interaction differ from those of single factors, and factor interactions have greater explanatory power than single factors in clinic distribution.\nConclusion This study investigates the geographic distribution and influencing variables of private clinics in typical mountain cities and identifies the causes of the current disparity in the distribution of healthcare resources. It is neces\u2011 sary to gradually develop the primary healthcare system in mountainous cities with legislation, counterpart support, and social resources. While ensuring equal access to health care for low\u2011income people and mobile populations, vari\u2011 ous medical needs of community members should be fully considered and implemented as soon as possible.\nKeywords Private clinics, Space pattern, Influence factors, Main urban area of Guiyang, Multisource data\nThe issue of limited access to healthcare resources in China has received a lot of attention from researchers in a variety of fields [1]. One-fifth of the global total population of this country should be considered the need of medical resources, especially with the aging, and the rising prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases *Correspondence: Fang\u2011Juan Du dfj521@gznu.edu.cn 1 School of Geography and Environmental Sciences, School of Karst Science), Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang 550001, Guizhou, China\nin the next several decades. Therefore, the importance to the future development of China\u2019s healthcare is how to strengthen the network of community health service institutions, including both the public and also the private resources to meet the diverse needs of residents in terms of health services. Medical institutions that provide primary care are usually regarded as the foundation of the healthcare system, mostly consisted of clinics, township hospitals (health offices) in rural areas, and community health centers in urban areas in China [2]. Although the total number of existing medical and health institutions in China have reached 10,30,935 by the end of 2021, an increase of 8013 compared to 2020, with a growth rate of 0.78% [3], the location of primary healthcare facilities is crucial for offering individuals access to essential medical treatment in everyday life, which matters both the citizens\u2019 health and wellbeing, and the justice of healthcare.\nPrevious researches about the distribution of healthcare institutions focused on public institutions and the balance of healthcare resource allocation at various scales, mainly those state-owned ones [4\u20139], the descriptive analysis, the Lorenz curve, and the Gini coefficient are widely used to examine the equilibrium of medical resource allocation [10, 11], whereas geographic information technologies such as kernel density [12] and the two-step search method [13\u201315] are used to examine the spatial distribution and accessibility of the medical resources [16]. Obviously, these studies ignored the complementary role of private medical institutions, underestimated the function of their healthcare in China. Although a few studies have used point of interest data of private clinics into the primary care system, just only for a comprehensive analysis [17], nearly discussed the private clinics\u2019 distribution characteristics and influencing factors. With China\u2019s diversified medical development patterns, a large number of rapidly expanding private clinics have their characteristics and complement and interpenetrate with other medical systems, forming a ponderous system [18].\nThe environment for residents to access routine medical treatment has been improved by profit-driven clinics, especially in rural and urban areas that are still comparatively underdeveloped. However, private clinics are difficult to gain acceptance due to historical, governmental, and cognitive concerns. The \"Guidance on Conducting Pilots to Promote Clinic Development\" issued by the General Office of the National Health and Wellness Commission in 2019 further clarified the significance of clinics in implementing the Health China strategy and enhancing the overall effectiveness of medical services. Ten cities, including Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen,\nwere taken as pilots to improve clinic construction and management policies [19].\nComparing with the state-owned hospitals, private clinics provide dental treatments [20], multi-morbidities, and easy-to-diagnose common disorders, with the flexible settings, useful services, a range of varieties, and reasonable prices [21, 22]. According to a largescale national poll conducted in 2015, more than 80% of urban and rural inhabitants prefer community hospitals or clinics for the treatment of minor daily ailments [23], which could be shown that the private clinic is a typical primary medical institution and an essential part of the modern medical and health service system. The total number of clinics registered and operating in China increased from 259,833 in 2020 to 271,056 in 2021, accounting for 27.72% of the total number of primary healthcare institutions, with an increase of 4.32%, which far exceeds the overall growth rate of health care institutions [3]. It is the foundational that the spatial distribution of the private clinics is the complementary role in the primary care system.\nGeographers are used to discuss the spatial distribution and analyze the geographical factors, including physical and social ones. This study focuses on the individual private profit-making medical institutions, private clinics, by using geographic probes for single factor and interaction analysis, especially as the case of study, Guiyang is a typical mountainous city, which means high input and low efficiency for public services. The goal of this paper is to give some reasonable suggestions for the spatial optimization of various medical resources, and further promote the medical resource to use and management effectively."

To calculate the density of the points, a circular area search is performed on each grid point [27]. The formulation of the kernel density function f(x) is shown below, which reflects the spatial location of x points.\nwhere, fn(x) is the kernel density estimate of the center point of the private clinic service space in the study area; n is the number of samples in the center of the clinic service space (pcs); h is the area search radius (m); x \u2212 xi is the distance between two center points (m). The geometric meaning of this function is that the density value is highest at each center point, and it diminishes for the place far away from the center point. The larger the kernel density value, the higher the degree of aggregation."

It is good at analyzing type quantities, both numerical and qualitative data, as well as detecting the interaction of two factors on the dependent variable and testing its statistical significance [29].\nSingle influence factor analysis In this research, the factor detection module is primarily used to introduce the spatial distribution determination force indicator q for the private clinics in the main urban area of Guiyang City. The formula for calculating q is shown below.\nWhere, h = 1,2\u2026, L is the number of strata of the influence factor X on the spatial distribution of clinics; Nh and N are the number of cells within stratum h and the whole study area, respectively; 2\nh and are the vari-\nances of Y values in stratum h and the whole study area, respectively; SSW and SST are the sums of the stratum variance (within the Sum of squares) and the total variance of the whole area (total sum of squares) [29]. q falls within [0, 1], and a larger value of q indicates that the factor has a greater influence on the distribution in the clinic space and vice versa. q = 1 means that the independent variable X completely controls the variance of clinic space; q = 0 means that the spatial pattern of clinics is randomly distributed and the independent variable X has no effect on the variance of private clinic space.\nInfluence factor interaction analysis The interaction detection module is used to investigate the interaction between the spatially distributed independent variable factors in the clinic, and the q-values of the respective variable factors, as well as the strength of their explanatory power on the dependent variable Y are compared. The q-value magnitudes of factors X1 and X2 on Y, i.e., q(X1) and q(X2), and the q-value magnitudes when X1 and X2 interact, i.e., q(X1 X2), are calculated using the above equation. The interaction types of q(X1), q(X2),\n(6)\nq = 1 \u2212\n\u2211L\nh=1 Nh 2 n\nN 2 = 1 \u2212\nSSW SST , SSW =\nL \ufffd\nh=1\nNh\u03c3 2 h , SST = N\u03c32\nand q(X1 X2) are compared, and the interaction types between the two factors in the private clinic distribution can be divided into the following categories (Table\u00a02).\nSelection of influencing factors Most of the existing studies on the influencing factors of medical resource allocation use qualitative descriptions [30, 31] or investigate the drivers of medical resource distribution through the weighted regression models and superposition analysis [32, 33]. However, there are few quantitative studies for each driver, which fail to reveal the spatial structural characteristics of medical resources and the impact of their influencing factors. Based on the distribution range and pattern of clinics in Guiyang\u2019s main urban area, this study exploits available and reliable multi-source spatial data and refers to previous studies on the spatial analysis of medical resources such as public medical care and tertiary hospitals in the city [12, 17], as well as the \"spillover\" effect of public medical institutions such as hospitals (Table\u00a0 3). The spatial distribution of clinics in Guiyang\u2019s main urban area was modeled by using eight measurable proxies in five dimensions, including natural environmental factors, demographic factors, transportation conditions, economic development level, and spatial distance.\nIn this study, the main urban area of Guiyang City was created based on the field survey. Grid coordinate points (1\u00a0km \u00d7 1\u00a0km) were collected in the fishnet, and the grid was used taken the research unit, while the data-free area was excluded to avoid the influence of different administrative divisions on the analysis results. Following Jenks\u2019 natural best breakpoint method, the factors were classified into five levels, and the spatial distribution of the clinic services in the main urban area of Guiyang was analyzed through factor detection and interaction detection using geographic probes. Then, the determining power and significance level of each factor on the spatial distribution pattern of clinics were derived, and the types of interaction between the factors of each variable were compared."

General clinic and integrated of Chinese and western medicine clinics are distributed in the main urban area of Guiyang city in a large range of \"surface + point\". The multiple cores cluster together to form a large scale cluster area, with a wide distribution and influence range, and the core areas of the two clinics are slightly different. The distribution of Chinese clinic, dental clinics, and ethnic medical clinics exhibit a pattern of \"one core multi-point,\" but the core locations differ significantly, with the former two types of clinics concentrated in old urban areas and the latter in suburban interface and old industrial areas.\nSpatial distribution direction of\u00a0private clinics The spatial layout of private clinics in main urban area of Guiyang City was further investigated by using the standard deviation ellipse analysis method. The results that the overall standard deviation in the ellipse\u2019s longaxis direction of the clinic space is 13.20\u00b0 to the south of the east, indicating an eastward-westward pattern. Except for TCM and ethnomedicine, the standard ellipse of all types of clinic service spaces overlaps; the ellipse centers of the other types of clinics are close to each other and parallel to the overall distribution direction. Meanwhile, the ellipse centers of the traditional treatment places like TCM and ethnomedicine are westward, and the long-axis direction of the standard deviation ellipse is 62.49\u00b0 and 28.50\u00b0 to the west of the north, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 4). On the one hand, the majority of the mountains straddling Guiyang\u2019s central city have a north\u2013south orientation, which hampers the city\u2019s early east\u2013west expansion, and the city mainly extends longitudinally along with the orientation of the mountains.

It indicates that the medical and health services should be sufficiently close to the service recipients, i.e., the source of the recipients of medical care has a fundamental influence on the spatial distribution of medical care. This also indicates that clinics, as a medical professional\nfield, have developed into the living service industry and become an important place for providing daily medical services [35], and the observations are consistent with national statistics [3]. \u2461 Residents rely on transportation road networks to access these services, such as seeking medical advice and purchasing medicines. The greater the density of the road network, the better the traffic accessibility, and the denser the clinic outlets [17]. This is more prevalent in cities with mountains. The degree of medical resource distribution and aggregation is closely related to the accessibility of metropolitan highways. \u2462 The areas with high road density are mostly located in areas of higher economic development, and thus have a higher population and GDP per capita, which fully confirms the previous analysis results of the nuclear density pattern of clinic distribution. It demonstrates that the population flow brought about by the dense distribution of residential neighborhoods and roads gives life to the clinic service space. Meanwhile, the clinic space has more advantages than public medical facilities in terms of distance [36].

The relationship between natural elements in mountainous cities and settlement dispersion, road density, and other characteristics can be explained by the interaction of influencing factors. The data indirectly show how topography influences the structure of mountain cities and the geographical distribution of medical services.\nThe impact of\u00a0urban development patterns on\u00a0the\u00a0spatial distribution of\u00a0clinics The long axis of the standard deviation ellipse of general clinics, integrated Chinese and western medicine clinics, and dental clinics shows an east\u2013west distribution, whereas the long axis of the ellipse of Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine shows a significant north\u2013south distribution. The inherent geography of mountainous cities suggests that the pattern of cities tends to be from a single core to several satellite cities [37]. The same is true of Guiyang. With the development of transportation corridors like roads, bridges, and tunnels, Guiyang gradually overcame the mountain barrier and expanded outward. These transportation corridors are objective influencing factors of the unequal distribution of urban and rural medical resources. Guiyang was originally a relatively flat basin. Quality medical resources have long been concentrated in the central city and have not been effectively relocated and supplemented with urban expansion and population growth, which have created an opportunity for private practice development.\nThe relationship between\u00a0policy development and\u00a0the\u00a0spatial distribution of\u00a0health care resources The distribution of clinics has a clear preference for residential land, densely populated areas, and densely populated areas. The implementation of relevant policies by the Chinese government has played a significant role in guiding the evolution of urban geographic functions and the allocation of various resources. The implementation of policies governing clinic approval has promoted the rapid development of social medicine and health services. Meanwhile, since 2010, Guiyang has been constructing a large number of commercial and subsidized housing units in the west, which has attracted a certain amount of foreign and mobile population, and the focus of urban development has gradually shifted from the old city to the west [38]. In response to urbanization, the\ngovernment is actively strengthening medical resource integration and implementing a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, as well as gradually improving medical service accessibility and coverage. However, large public hospitals in Guiyang are overcrowded due to finite high-quality resources. This results in an objective \"mismatch\" between population distribution and quality medical resources, and it makes blank space for the growth of informal ethnic medicine. In terms of spatial structure, the distribution of clinics in Guiyang\u2019s main urban area exhibits significant spatial differentiation and clustering characteristics, indicating that the central urban area and the suburban junction are more balanced, while the townships are sparser. Meanwhile, this study discovered that some townships around Guiyang failed to form effective detection data points due to a lack of medical resources. It shows that medical scarcity zones of public medical resources at various levels are easy to establish in remote cities and localities, which is more typical in China\u2019s western region [39]. According to the survey findings, social capital is difficult to concentrate in these areas due to the absence of economic development dynamics, and public healthcare resources are required to satisfy people\u2019s fundamental healthcare needs [12].\nInteraction between\u00a0public health services and\u00a0healthcare-seeking behavior The assurance of high-quality urban life, which is related to social and spatial justice, is provided by reasonable matching and effective utilization of medical resources in space [40, 41]. The fundamental difference of the type of health systems in China is the dual medical systems of indigenous medicine and Western or modern medicine in contrast to developed countries and regions [42]. Evidence from some developing countries, shows that traditional medical practitioners-including herbalists, diviners and others\u2014form the main body of primary health workers in many rural areas, and even urban populations rely on and patronize traditional health systems [43, 44]. A considerable part of Guiyang\u2019s medical and health resources are provided by private clinics, which is tied to the market demand created by locals\u2019 regular medical practices. The majority of the 80 informal ethnic medical sites discovered during this survey are located in shantytowns, abandoned industrial zones, or next to farmers\u2019 markets in protected housing and demolition and resettlement sites at the border of suburbs, where a disproportionately large percentage of impoverished and migrant residents live together with public healthcare facilities of relatively low quality. Once the residents are ill, they will select private clinics because they are quick, affordable, and convenient, creating a niche market for illegal or ethnic private medical care. In informal medical settings, the\nhygienic environment and technical proficiency of the medical staff are usually not guaranteed [45], and there are higher medical hazards. These residents\u2019 medical conduct and social traits will have a big impact on their health in the long run [46]. Generally, urban low-income persons and the mobile population experience varying degrees of difficulty in obtaining medical consultation clinics due to low levels of health awareness, off-site medical policies, reimbursement bases, and insufficient consumption of health services [47, 48]."

            "text": "According to the field work and analysis, we found that there are 716 private medical clinics of five major categories, among which the major part is the general clinics, and traditional Chinese medicine clinics account for only 1%, less than integrated Chinese and modern medicine clinic. By contrast, the ethnic medical clinics are unexpectedly above 10%, which is noticeable that the alternative role of health service for the target group, and the supervision and management to the local medical administrations. It is important to promote the coordinated development of various types of medical and health services, and improve the health and well-being of all people.\nThe distribution of these private clinics has obvious spatial differentiation and clustering characteristics, especially distributed unevenly in the west and east of Guiyang\u2019s main urban area, the \"four cores\" have the highest distribution density and are located in Guiyang\u2019s central city and suburbs. It is necessary to consider how to balance the resource allocation between urban and suburban district areas and provide quality healthcare services to people of all various social classes.\nThe main factors influencing the spatial distribution of clinics are residential land use, road density, population density, and GDP per capita. which shows that social healthcare resources could be as a spot to understand the whole of the healthcare system of less-developed western mountainous cities in China\u2019. Comparing with the plain cities, the medical resource allocation guidelines in mountain cities must consider the topographic characteristics, residential land use, population density in the difference of administrative regions [7]. As same as the assistance of legislation, counterpart assistance, social resource utilization etc..\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank all the reviewers who participated in the review, as well as MJEditor (www. mjedi tor. com) for providing English editing services during the preparation of this manuscript.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions Wei Li was responsible for research, data processing and writing the first draft of the paper; Ou Ruan prepared figures1\u20113.
