1. **Investigate the relationship between the length of the appended peptide blocks and the BL intensity in more detail.** The study found that the BL intensity of the new ALucs was influenced by the length of the appended peptide blocks. However, the exact relationship between these two factors is not yet fully understood. Future studies could investigate this relationship in more detail, using a wider range of peptide block lengths and different luciferase constructs. This information could be used to design new ALucs with tailored BL intensities for specific applications.


2. **Explore the use of the new ALucs in other bioassays and molecular imaging modalities.** The study demonstrated the utility of the new ALucs in single-chain molecular strain probes and PCA probes. However, these are just two examples of the many potential applications of these new luciferases. Future studies could explore the use of the new ALucs in other bioassays and molecular imaging modalities, such as gene expression assays, protein-protein interaction assays, and in vivo imaging.


3. **Investigate the structural basis for the differences in BL intensity and color among the new ALucs.** The study found that the BL intensity and color of the new ALucs varied depending on the length and sequence of the appended peptide blocks. However, the structural basis for these differences is not yet fully understood. Future studies could use X-ray crystallography or other structural biology techniques to determine the 3D structures of the new ALucs and investigate how these structures relate to their optical properties.


4. **Develop new CTZ analogs with improved optical properties.** The study found that the BL spectra of the new ALucs could be modulated by using different CTZ analogs. However, the CTZ analogs used in the study were not optimized for use with the new ALucs. Future studies could develop new CTZ analogs with improved optical properties, such as higher quantum yields and longer emission wavelengths. These new CTZ analogs could be used to further expand the range of colors that can be generated by the new ALucs.


5. **Investigate the potential of the new ALucs for use in optogenetics.** Optogenetics is a technique that uses light to control the activity of neurons. The new ALucs could potentially be used as optogenetic actuators, allowing researchers to control the activity of neurons with light. Future studies could investigate the potential of the new ALucs for use in optogenetics, and explore their use in developing new optogenetic tools for neuroscience research.
