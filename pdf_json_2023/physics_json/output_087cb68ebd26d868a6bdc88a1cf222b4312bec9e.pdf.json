Approximately 60\u201370% of the damage is caused by hydroxyl radicals [3]. The brain contains high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and relatively low levels of antioxidant enzymes, making it highly susceptible to oxidative damage [2]. Radiation can affect cognitive functions such as learning and memory because it can damage neurogenesis, promote brain cell apoptosis, and cause neurodegenerative changes [3].\n\u2020Xiaoming Liu and Mengya Liu contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: Xiujun Qin xiujunqin@163.com 1Department of Radiology and Environmental Medicine, China Institute for Radiation Protection, CAEA Center of Excellence on Nuclear Technology Applications for Non-Clinical Evaluation for Radiopharmaceutical, Shanxi Key Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Toxicology & Radiation Injury Pharmaceuticals, CNNC Key Laboratory for Radiotoxicology and Preclinical Assessment of Radiopharmaceuticals, Taiyuan 030006, P. R. China 2School of forensic medicine, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, P. R. China\nMethods and results HRW significantly improves the cognitive impairment in rats exposed to ionizing radiation. Based on metabolomics and biological network results, we identified 54 differential metabolites and 93 target genes. The KEGG pathway indicates that glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, and glycerophospholipid metabolism play important roles in ionizing radiation therapy.\nConclusion Our study has systematically elucidated the molecular mechanism of HRW against ionizing radiation, which can be mediated by modulating targets, pathways and metabolite levels. This provides a new perspective for identifying the underlying pharmacological mechanism of HRW.\nKeywords Hydrogen-rich water, Ionizing radiation, Brain tissue metabolomics, Biological network\nRadiation may cause long-term cognitive impairment, especially in children whose nervous system is still developing [3, 4].\nHydrogen has great potential in the clinical treatment of various neurological diseases [5]. Previous studies have shown that hydrogen treatment can effectively prevent and alleviate neonatal brain injury and cognitive dysfunction, especially cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [6\u20138]. Hydrogen can cross the blood-brain barrier and quickly cross cell membranes to interact with toxic ROS. Therefore, hydrogen has great potential in the clinical treatment of various diseases of the nervous system.\nMetabolomics, as a new omics technique, study the cellular processes involving metabolites, intermediates and products of cell metabolism, and has find applications in drug metabolism, biomarkers, and environmental toxicants. Metabolomics elucidates the end points of biological processes, reflecting the physiological and pathological state through metabolic levels [9]. Therefore, metabolomics is a useful tool to investigate pharmacodynamics and mechanism of action of radioprotectants which reflect the end state of diseases and treatments [10\u201314]. However, the changes in endogenous metabolites are unknown, and using metabolomics alone as a tool may not reveal the effectiveness of radiation protection agents in the treatment of radiation-induced diseases.\nComputer virtual computing based on high throughput omics data analysis and network database search may reveal complex network signal relationships among drugs, targets and diseases [15]. For radioprotective agents, their pharmacological effects are characterized by multi-targets and multi-levels. The biological target network has the advantage to analyze and explain the action mechanisms from a holistic perspective, promoting the in-depth investigation [16]. Combining the two key technologies of computer simulation and metabionomics, the molecular mechanism of agents\u2019 action on diseases can be explained from the metabolic level and genetic levels. For example, Liu et al. linked the biological targets network with metabolomics and found that amino acid metabolism is a potential target for Xiaoyaosan antidepressant [17].\nTo the best of our knowledge, no studies have used metabolomics combined with biological network approaches to study the effect of hydrogen on radiationinduced cognitive impairment. This study used metabolomics combined with a biological target network to investigate the molecular biological mechanism of HRW on radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats."

In the site\nnavigation task, rats acclimated themselves with the test environment by swimming for 2\u00a0min in the circular pool without a platform the day before the formal test. Rats were then trained for five consecutive days. To start training, rats were placed in the pool facing the pool wall, the swimming route of the rats were tracked, the escape latency (the time from entering the water to finding platform\u2013all limbs on the platform) was measured. Rats were allowed to rest on the platform for a few seconds before returning them to their cages. The escape latency was recorded as 120\u00a0s if the rat did not find the platform within 2\u00a0min and were guided to the platform. The arithmetic mean of the escape latencies was calculated four times per day. The position navigation test was followed by a spatial probe test in which the platform was withdrawn and the rats were placed at any entry point in the pool on day six. The swimming distance of rats were recorded and analyzed within 1\u00a0min. Record the passage time they cross the original platform, the time the rat retained in the original platform quadrant, their swimming distance in the platform quadrant, and the number of times the rat crossed the platform.\nBrain tissue samples collection and preparation After the brain tissue was collected, 30\u00a0 mg brain tissue sample were accurately weighed and transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.

            "text": "Effect of HRW on learning and memory in rats with ionizing radiation Morris water maze test was used to assess the functional consequences of radiation exposure on the brain and whether HRW produced any neurocognitive benefits. During the training period of the first five days, the radiation group had significantly longer escape latency than the control group, the HRW group and the radiation -HRW treatment group (P < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 1A.). The spatial search test was performed from day six. The radiationHRW group had significantly longer retention time in the original platform quadrant, greater platform crossings, and longer swimming distance than the radiation group (P < 0.05 Fig.\u00a01B, C, D). These results indicated that brain radiation damaged the spatial memory and spatial search ability of rats, and HRW had a protective effect on radiation-induced cognitive impairment.\nHRW regulated metabolic disorders in ionizing radiation rats PLS-DA was used for metabolic profiling to reduce the dimensionality of complex data obtained from brain tissue samples from the control and radiation groups. The model was clearly separated from the control group, indicating that this radiation had a significant effect on the endogenous metabolic spectrum of rat brain tissue (Fig.\u00a0 2A). The PLS-DA model was then validated with an arrangement test (Fig.\u00a0 2B). All the permutation values of R2 and Q2 were smaller than the original values,\nindicating that the established model was stable and reliable. We further analyzed the differences between groups using PLS-DA (Fig.\u00a02E). The control group, the radiation group, and radiation-HRW group could be clearly distinguished, indicating that HRW was effective for radiation group rats. The QC samples were collected together in PLS-DA to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the system and method.\nBrain tissue sample data from control and model groups were analyzed with OPLS- DA to identify radiation-related differential metabolites. The combination of VIP > 1 (in S-plot) and P < 0.05 (in T-test) revealed a\nsignificant contribution of metabolites to homeostasis (Fig.\u00a0 2\u00a0 C and 2D). Compared with the control group, a total of 80 metabolites including LysoPE(18:1(11Z)/0:0), pantothenic acid, gamma-glutamylleucine, 1-phosphate ribose, stearoylethanolamide, etc., changed significantly in the model group. After the intervention of HRW, such changes were significantly adjusted (Table\u00a0 1), indicating that HRW dramatically reversed the metabolic disorders of ionizing radiation rats.\nRegulation of key metabolite-related metabolic pathways by HRW To explore the metabolic pathways of ionizing radiation rats, differential metabolites were introduced into MetaboAnalyst for pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway effect > 0.1 was considered to be a key metabolic pathway (the results are shown in Fig.\u00a03), and five metabolic pathways related to ionizing radiation were identified, including: glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldonic acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, glycerophospholipid metabolism, alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism. Four metabolic pathways (glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldonic acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, and glycerophospholipid metabolism) are specifically regulated by HRW. The above results suggest that HRW may improve ionizing radiation by regulating multiple metabolic pathways. It reflects the multi-objective and multi-pathway mechanism of HRW. Integrative analysis of metabolomics and network pharmacology An interaction network based on metabolomics and network pharmacology was constructed to fully understand the mechanism of HRW against ionizing radiation (Fig.\u00a04). Differential metabolites were introduced into the Cytoscape\u2019s MetScape plug-in to collect a compoundresponse-enzyme-gene network. By matching potential targets identified in network pharmacology to genes from the MetScape analysis, we identified one key target. The key relevant metabolites are phosphatidylcholine, choline and glucuronide salts. The pathways affected are glutathione metabolism, ascorbic acid and aldehyde acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronic acid interconversion, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. They may play an\nimportant role in the therapeutic effects of FWR on ionizing radiation."

There were interactions between these signal pathways that can synergistically affect pathways that in turn, synergistically affected the HRW treatment with ionizing radiation (Fig.\u00a05).\nTherapeutic performance evaluation of biomarkers Brain tissue biomarkers are the cornerstone of ionizing radiation diagnosis, and their function was assessed by ROC analysis. A total of three metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers including phosphatidylcholine, choline, and D-glucuronate. Figure\u00a0 6\u00a0 A shows that the AUC for phosphatidylcholine, choline, and D- glucuronide were 0.8147, 0.6843, and 0.6503, respectively.

WR-2721 is the only FDA-approved radioprotective agent that can prevent radiation-induced damage, especially hydroxyl radical damage. WR-2721 can cause dizziness, vomiting and other adverse reactions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe radioprotectants. Hydrogen is a safe, convenient, non-toxic substance with little or no side effects and selective antioxidant function. Hydrogen scavenging prevents oxidative stress-induced damage [19, 20]. Hydrogen has a protective effect on various tissues from radiation damage. For example, intake of hydrogenrich water after radiation can alleviate damages to the immune system, skin, hematopoietic system, small intestine, and heart by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [21\u201325]. Their selective neutralization of harmful oxygen radicals has attracted increasing attention in the field of radiation protection. Hydrogen can cross the blood-brain barrier and quickly cross cell membranes to interact with toxic ROS. However, the material basis and potential\nmechanisms of hydrogen utilization in many neurological diseases remain unclear.\nIn our previous study, a single partial whole-brain irradiation with a 6-MeV electron beam of 30\u00a0Gy could successfully induce cognitive dysfunction in rats [26]. Compared with control rats, the number of new neurons decreased by 67% on the 7th day after 30\u00a0Gy whole brain irradiation [27]; and on the 30th day after irradiation, there were no surviving new neurons, indicating that irradiation with 30\u00a0 Gy successfully induced acute cognitive dysfunction. In this study, a single 30\u00a0Gy electron beam whole brain irradiation was used to establish a model of cognitive dysfunction in rats. Then, we investigated the effects of HRW on cognitive function and its possible mechanism using Metabolomics combined with biological networks. The results showed that after HRW\ntreatment, the cognitive dysfunction of rats was alleviated, and the protective effect was related to the regulation of phosphatidylcholine, choline, and D-Glucuronate. The results of brain metabolomics showed that HRW can significantly regulate the levels of 54 different metabolites, including glutathione metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. These pathways were discussed below.\nPyroglutamic acid is a cyclized derivative of L- glutamic acid produced by non-enzymatic reaction of glutamic acid, glutamine and \u03b3-glutamine peptide. It can also be generated by the reaction of \u03b3-glutamyl cyclotransferase with amino acids. Acquired pyroglutamic acid deficiency (penicillins) and glutathione deficiency (e.g., malnutrition or sepsis) often result in moderate to severe encephalopathy clinically [28]. In our study, decreased levels of relevant metabolites were observed to decrease in ionizing radiation rats, and these metabolites could be restored by HRW, indicating that glutathione metallurgy may be the mechanism by which HRW treats ionizing radiationinduced brain injury.\nCognitive impairment seriously affects people\u2019s physical and mental health and also causes a substantial economic burden [29]. This study showed that HRW can regulate the glycerophospholipid metabolism, which is the most abundant phospholipid in the body, and can activate the phospholipase A2 pathway to release arachidonic acid, thereby regulating the metabolism of glycerophospholipids and improve depression [30]. In addition, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, pentose and gluconate interconversions are closely related to cognitive impairment [31, 32]. Our study found that HRW can improve ionizing radiation-induced brain cognitive impairment by modulating these pathways.\nAlthough this study systematically explained the mechanism by which HRW improves cognitive impairment, there are limitations that require further study: This study only used non-targeted brain Metabolomics and biological target network at the level of metabolites and metabolic pathways. This model could be easily exploited in future works for the elucidation of pharmacological effects and mechanisms using a multi-omics approach based on integrated transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics studies.Further studies warrant adding corresponding pathway inhibitors at the cellular and animal levels for verification. In depth analysis though might be worth being conducted in future studies."
