conclusion Various methods are available to increase the digestibility of proteins, with implications for increasing the consumption of protein-rich foods, especially meat, thereby improving protein utilization for older adults. These methods are gut microbiota and probiotics; chemical methods, including aging and enzymatic treatment (plant-derived proteases); and physical methods, including heat, ultrasound, HPP, and PEF. There is substantial evidence emerging to suggest that diet composition plays an important role in shaping the gut microbiome and that various diet components may impact the gut microbiota composition. In this context, the digestibility of proteins may depend on the gut microbiota. The chemical and physical methods disrupt the structural integrity of meat protein and dissociate connective tissues, muscle fiber, and myofibrils, with potential implications for improving meat protein digestion in older adults.
