Cross-Domain and Cross-Lingual Entity Linking: Building on the success of the proposed method in specific domains, future research could explore the adaptation of this keyword-enhanced sparse retrieval approach to cross-domain and cross-lingual settings. This would involve investigating how keywords and context cues transfer across different domains and languages, potentially requiring the development of domain-agnostic or language-agnostic keyword extraction methods.

Integration with Dense Retrievers for Hybrid Models: Although the paper highlights the advantages of sparse retrieval in few-shot settings, integrating the keyword extractor with dense retrievers could create a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both approaches. Such a model could use keyword extraction to improve query formulation for dense retrieval or use dense retrieval scores as an additional feature in the ranking process.

Automated Query Expansion and Refinement: The paper introduces a method for keyword extraction to enhance query formulation. Future work could extend this by exploring more advanced techniques for automated query expansion and refinement, using not only keyword extraction but also synonym detection, paraphrasing, and context understanding to dynamically adjust queries based on retrieval feedback or success rates.

Exploring Different Sources of Distant Supervision: The proposed method uses distant supervision based on overlapping tokens between mention contexts and entity descriptions. Future research could explore alternative or additional sources of distant supervision, such as entity co-occurrence patterns in large corpora, semantic similarity measures, or external knowledge graphs, to enrich the training data for the keyword extractor.

Scalability and Efficiency Improvements: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, further research could focus on improving the scalability and efficiency of the keyword extractor and the overall entity linking process. This might include optimizing the algorithm for parallel processing, reducing the computational complexity of the keyword extraction and retrieval steps, or developing more efficient data structures for managing the entity knowledge base.
