These circuits undergo a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in their entanglement structure, but the nature of the critical point differs drastically from the case with constant measurement rate. In particular, at the critical measurement rate, we find that the entanglement of a subsystem of size ` scales as S \u223c \u221a `; moreover, the dynamical critical exponent z =\u221e. The MIPT is flanked by Griffiths phases with continuously varying dynamical exponents. We argue for this infinite-randomness scenario on general grounds and present numerical evidence that it captures some features of the universal critical properties of MIPT using large-scale simulations of Clifford circuits. These findings demonstrate that the relevance and irrelevance of perturbations to the MIPT can naturally be interpreted using a powerful heuristic known as the Harris criterion.\nThe study of hybrid dynamics, unitary evolution interspersed with measurements, in random quantum circuits has garnered a significant amount of attention in recent years [1\u20134]. It has become well-established that the competition between scrambling dynamics and local measurements leads to a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT), which is a phase transition in the entanglement structure of the quantum state conditional on a set of (typical) measurement outcomes. In previously studied models of measurement-induced criticality a recurring theme is the emergence of conformal invariance at the critical point [1, 2, 5\u20139]. This symmetry holds even in the presence of fairly drastic modifications of the dynamics, e.g., the addition of conservation laws [10\u201314] or the removal of scrambling in lieu of few-site measurements [15\u201318]. A natural question is whether conformal invariance is robust against the presence of weak spatial randomness\u2014e.g., measurement rates that are spatially varying.\nThe MIPT in random circuits has space-time randomness, and in the standard treatment [1, 2, 5\u201342] this randomness is spatially and temporally uncorrelated. As such, the correlation length exponent \u03bd at this transition is constrained to satisfy the Chayes-Chayes-FisherSpencer (CCFS) bound [43] \u03bd \u2265 2/D, where D = d + 1 is the spacetime dimension. Numerical studies in d = 1 have yielded an exponent \u03bd \u2248 1.3 [1, 5, 8, 10, 13] that is clearly consistent with the CCFS bound. However, stability against quenched spatial randomness (which is columnar, i.e., perfectly correlated in time) imposes the stronger bound \u03bd \u2265 2/d, which is not satisfied. Con-\nsequently, the stability argument due to Harris [44, 45] implies that the conformally invariant critical point is unstable to any added static spatial randomness.\nIn this work we we explore what new critical universality class this instability leads to. We pursue two complementary approaches: first, we explore classically simulable Clifford circuits with a spatially varying measurement rate; second, we construct a real-space renormalizationgroup (RSRG) treatment [46\u201350] that is strictly valid in the limit of large on-site Hilbert space dimensions, but that may plausibly describe the fixed point more generally. The two approaches are mutually consistent in many respects, but qualitative deviations between the two critical points are found in some observables.\nThe RSRG mapping yields the following key, universal predictions: (i) the new critical point exhibits activated dynamical scaling, i.e., space and time scale with the relation log t \u223c \u221a x [cf. the relativistic behavior at the conventional MIPT (x \u223c t)]; (ii) the steady-state entanglement of a subsystem of size ` at the critical point scales as S(`) \u223c \u221a ` [cf. \u223c log ` in the absence of static disorder]; (iii) the MIPT is flanked by Griffiths phases in which the late-time dynamics is governed by rare-region effects. We put forward these three behaviors as sufficient criteria to claim two critical points are described by the same infinite-randomness fixed point. Our numerical evidence indicates that both Clifford circuits and percolation are consistent with each of these predictions. However, we also find that the tripartite information at the Clifford critical point acquires a broad distribution, with its average growing as a fractional power law of system size. ar X iv :2\n20 5.\n14 00\n2v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .d\nis -n\nn] 2\n7 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 This numerical observation appears robust, and goes beyond any existing theoretical calculation. This feature also appears to be absent in our numerical simulations of percolation with columnar disorder.\nModels and entanglement probes of the MIPT : We consider random circuit models of the \u201cbrick wall\u201d structure that consist of randomly chosen two qubit gates between nearest neighbor q-state spins. For our numerical simulations we focus on randomly sampling Clifford gates between qubits (q = 2) that allow us to reach large system sizes as they can be simulated with classical efficiency [51\u201354]. For our analytic treatment of the problem we take Haar random gates and send q \u2192\u221e. Last, we also consider a classical limit of this model by solving a percolation problem with columnar disorder, in the supplement [55].\nTo build static spatial randomness into the problem we focus on a position-dependent measurement probability px that is applied between every layer of unitary gates and is given by px = r n x , where rx is a random variable uniformly distributed in [0, 1] and n is the tuning parameter. For a given realization of the circuit we generate a fixed static px and find it convenient to parameterize the strength of the measurement rate by its disorder averaged value, i.e. p = 1n+1 , and in the following we denote averages over circuit realizations via \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7. This distribution is chosen in order to have long tails so that rare regions of atypical values of px play an important role in the dynamics for relatively modest system sizes, but we do not expect it to change the universal properties of the critical point in the thermodynamic limit. This static measurement profile produces a \u201ccolumnar\u201d disorder pattern in space-time.\nThe measurement transition is present in quantities that involve averages that are non-linear in the reduced density matrix conditional on measurement outcomes, therefore we focus on entanglement probes of the system. Firstly, we focus on the von-Neumann entanglement entropy by dividing our system (with periodic boundary conditions) into two regions A (of length x) and B (of length L \u2212 x) and trace out region B, resulting in the entanglement entropy S(x, t) = \u2212TrA[\u03c1A log2 \u03c1A], where \u03c1A = TrB |\u03c8(t)\u3009\u3008\u03c8(t)| is a trace of the density matrix over region B where |\u03c8(t)\u3009 is the time-evolved wavefunction on a given sampled quantum trajectory.\nSecond, we utilize the behavior of the tripartite mutual information to identify and characterize the critical point of the entanglement transition. The tripartite mutual information is defined as\nI3(A,B,C) \u2261 S(A) + S(B) + S(C)\u2212 S(A \u222aB) \u2212S(A \u222a C)\u2212 S(B \u222a C) + S(A \u222aB \u222a C) (1)\nwhere we have omitted the time label and have partitioned the geometry of the system into adjacent regions A,B,C each of size L/4. The value of I3 depends sensitively on the nature of the circuit realization; we thus have a probability distribution P [I3] over trajectories and circuit realizations, and we denote the circuit-\naveraged value as I3. In the presence of strong spatial randomness the mean I3 is not representative of the distribution P [I3] as it becomes broad with fat tails requiring a more general scaling ansatz to capture the critical dynamics. Thus we study the distribution P [I3] in detail, which motivates us to generalize the scaling ansatz from Refs. [5, 8] to include the possibility of extensive scaling at the critical point (see supporting distribution data in the Supplement [55]). As a result, in order to numerically identify the critical point we find it most accurate to work with the distribution P [I3].\nTo understand the nature of purification dynamics we also study the ancilla order parameter, which is defined as follows [56]: At t = 0, a site in the system is maximally entangled with a reference qubit and the system is scrambled by unitary evolution for a time 2L. The system is then evolved under the hybrid dynamics for an additional time 2L and the average entanglement entropy of the reference qubit, SQ acts as an order parameter for the transition. In the volume-law phase, local measurements do not reveal information about the reference qubit and the entanglement entropy remains nonzero up to times exponential in the system size while in the arealaw phase, the measurements quickly collapse the state of the reference qubit and disentangle it from the system. Near the critical point, SQ obeys single parameter scaling allowing for an additional probe of the transition that is complimentary to I3.\nRSRG for quenched disorder : The transition is analytically tractable for Haar-random circuits in the limit of large on-site Hilbert space q \u2192 \u221e, using mappings onto replica statistical mechanics models [6, 25, 30, 57\u2013 59]. Upon averaging over random Haar gates, measurement locations and outcomes, any nonlinear function of the density matrix of the system can be mapped onto an effective two-dimensional k!-state Potts model in the replica limit k \u2192 1, which is known to describe bond percolation [6, 25]. Quenched disorder in the circuit leads to columnar disorder in the statistical mechanics model, which is amenable to RSRG techniques [46, 48, 55]. We find that for any number of replicas, and directly in the replica limit k \u2192 1, the transition is described by an infinite randomness fixed point with space-time scaling log t \u223c `\u03c8, with \u03c8 = 12 (z = \u221e that diverges like z \u223c `\u03c8/ log `), in agreement with known results on percolation with columnar disorder [60]. Scaling properties follow from known results [46\u201348]: in particular the (average) correlation length exponent is \u03bd = 2, and the scaling in the phases is controlled by Griffiths effects.\nOne important consequence of the mapping is the prediction that the steady-state entanglement entropy at criticality scales as S \u223c \u221a `. In the statistical mechanics picture, the entanglement entropy is related to the free energy cost of inserting a domain wall of size ` at the (spatial) boundary of the system [6, 25]. The free-energy cost of a domain wall is related to the logarithm of the boundary two-point function, which typically scales as exp(\u2212`\u03c8) [46\u201348]. Since S is related to the logarithm\nof the boundary two-point function it is dominated by typical samples and not rare samples; hence the result above. From the spacetime scaling mentioned above it follows that S \u223c log t.\nAlthough our predictions are restricted to q = \u221e, infinite randomness fixed points tend to be \u201csuperuniversal\u201d [61, 62]: for example, the critical properties of the random Potts model do not depend on the number of states [61], in sharp contrast with the clean case. It is therefore plausible to expect those specific predictions to extend to the finite q case as well, as we verify numerically below for qubits (q = 2). Notably, however, we find deviations between the universal behavior of the q = \u221e percolation model and the Clifford model in the scaling of mutual information quantities at the critical point.\nGriffiths phases: The RSRG treatment predicts that on either side of the critical point, certain dynamical quantities are dominated by rare-region effects. The pres-\nence of rare region effects is manifest in spatial profiles of the entanglement entropy S(x, t) for cuts at various positions x and times t for a given profile of measurement rates, as depicted in Fig. 1a. At small values of p we find that frequently measured regions act as bottlenecks that hinder the growth of the entanglement past that cut. In contrast, for large values of p we see that regions that are measured infrequently produce highly scrambled local regions.\nThe observables that quantitatively diagnose these Griffiths effects are distinct in the two phases. In the volume-law phase, we expect regions with a high measurement probability to act as bottlenecks for entanglement growth. Consider a region of size ` that is locally in the area-law phase. Suppose the region gets entangled with degrees of freedom to its left, so it is in a mixed state. Measurements rapidly purify this mixed state; the probability that it remains mixed long enough for entanglement to spread across it is suppressed as e\u2212`/\u03be where \u03be is the local correlation length inside the rare region. Therefore the rate at which entanglement spreads across a rare region of size ` scales as e\u2212`/\u03be. Because the measurement rate is spatially uncorrelated, the density of rare regions of size ` is exponentially suppressed, as f ` for some f that depends on the microscopic details of the disorder but approaches unity at the transition. Therefore, bottlenecks that allow entanglement growth at rate \u2264 \u03b3 occur at density f\u2212\u03be log \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2261 \u03be| log f |. Ref. [63] addressed the problem of entanglement growth in the presence of a power-law distribution of bottlenecks; it was found that S(t) \u223c t1/z, where z = (\u03b1+ 1)/\u03b1.\nIn Fig. 1b the late time entanglement growth is shown along with a power-law fit to at late times to extract z in the volume law phase. We stress that this in stark contrast to space-time random circuits that scale ballistically in time.\nIn the area-law phase, rare locally scrambling regions\ndo not dominate the steady-state entanglement; the observable they dominate, instead, is the purification rate of an initially mixed state. A region of size ` that is locally in the volume law phase purifies on a timescale \u223c e`/\u03be where \u03be is the local correlation length of the region. As before, the density of volume law regions of size L is suppressed as f\u0303 ` for some f\u0303 that approaches unity at the transition. In a sample of size L, the largest expected volume-law region has f\u0303 ` \u223c 1/L so ` \u223c logL/| log f\u0303 |. The purification time of the sample is controlled by this largest bottleneck and therefore scales as \u03c4(L) \u223c Lz where z = 1/(\u03be| log f\u0303 |). Deep in the area law phase z \u2192 0 but as p \u2192 pc rare region effects begin to play a role in the dynamics and the size of the largest rare region determines the purification time, giving rise to the power-law behavior \u03c4 \u223c Lz. In Fig. 1c, z is extracted via fits to the largest system sizes.\nIn summary, we find that in each Griffith regime the dynamic exponent z = z(p) is a continuously varying function of p. From the volume-law side, z starts near 1 and increases as p \u2192 pc while from the are law side z starts near 0 and increases, see Fig. 1a. These results provide an underestimate of z near pc as it is heavily affected by finite-size effects.\nIdentifying the critical point and its properties: Next, we turn to determining the location of the critical point using the tripartite mutual information. As previously mentioned, due to the distribution P [I3] developing fat tails, see supplement [55], the mean I3 does not fully characterize the distribution, which dramatically modifies the single parameter scaling I3 near the transition. Therefore, we turn to properties of P [I3] to identify pc. In the volume law phase, the probability to find I3 = 0 must vanish in the thermodynamic limit, whereas it must approach unity deep in the area law phase [55]. As shown in Fig. 2, this behavior is consistent with our numerical data allowing us to identify P [I3 = 0] as a scaling variable, which importantly does not require knowing the scaling of I3 only the assumption that it crosses at pc.\nUsing the scaling ansatz\nP [I3 = 0] \u223c F [L1/\u03bd(p\u2212 pc)] (2)\nwhere F (x) is arbitrary scaling function, we find excellent data collapse as shown in Fig. 2(inset) for pc \u2248 0.145(5) and \u03bd \u2248 2.2(2) in good agreement with the RSRG. Importantly, the estimated value of \u03bd is stable with respect to the Harris/CCFS bound.\nWe would also like to comment on identifying the transition using a data collapse of I3 with the less constrained scaling ansatz I3 \u223c Lag [ (p\u2212 pc)L1/\u03bd ] , to account for any possible L dependence at the critical point, that could be incurred for example due to a fat tail in P [I3]. For completeness, we consider three cases of the scaling function motivated by generality, the behavior of P [I3 = 0], and the RSRG picture, see supplementary information for details [55]. In all cases we find similar results for pc, \u03bd, and a > 0 with differences . 10%. Last, we note that the non-zero value of a is beyond the classical limit of the model as we show in the supplement [55].\nMotivated by these results, we study the average, halfcut, bipartite entanglement entropy S(L/2, t) as a function of the system size L and time t. Near the transition, for p \u2248 pc, in the long time limit (t L) we find\nS(L/2, t\u2192\u221e) \u223c \u221a L (3)\nwhereas, for large system sizes (L t) we obtain\nS(L/2\u2192\u221e, t) \u223c log t, (4)\nas shown in Fig. 3a in excellent agreement with the RSRG predictions. These results demonstrate that the critical point has a divergent dynamic exponent consistent with an infinite randomness fixed point. In the classical limit of percolation, we have also found the scaling in Eqs. (3) and (4), see supplement [55]. Additionally, we compute the saturation time t\u2217 at which S(L/2, t) reaches its late time value as shown in Fig. 3b. In the disordered system, rare regions will cause the entanglement to grow\n5 sub-ballistically so that the saturation time is no longer t\u2217 \u223c L. Numerically, in the volume-law phase we find a stretched exponential t\u2217 \u223c e \u221a L while in the area law phase it approaches a constant, see Fig. 3b (inset). Finally, we examine the average order parameter dynamics SQ(t, L) at the critical point as shown in Fig 3c. Our results have demonstrated this critical point is of the infinite randomness type that has a divergent dynamic exponent z \u223c \u03be\u03c8 \u223c |p \u2212 pc|\u2212\u03bd\u03c8, therefore we use the activated dynamic scaling ansatz [64] that yields\nSQ(t, L) \u223c g ( log t\nL\u03c8\n) , (5)\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary scaling function and \u03c8 is the so-called activation or barrier exponent. We find the excellent data collapse that yields \u03c8 = 0.56(4) in reasonable agreement with the RSRG result, see Fig. 3c (inset). Importantly, this value of \u03c8 is consistent with the lengthtime scaling of the entanglement entropy in Eqs. (3) and (4).\nDiscussion: Introducing static disorder to the measurement induced phase transition is a relevant perturbation that produces a flow to an (apparently) infiniterandomness critical point. We have constructed a field theoretic description of this transition in terms of a real space renormalization group approach and verified its key predictions using large scale simulations of Clifford circuits as well as its classical limit through percolation. Our results for the tripartite mutual information for Clifford circuits and simulations of percolation show qualitatively different behavior, raising the possibility that these two infinite-randomness fixed points belong to distinct universality classes. Analytically computing this quantity within the RSRG is an important task for future\nwork.\nFinally, the results for static randomness presented above stand in stark contrast with the case of static quasiperiodic modulation in space. The bound governing the relevance of quasiperiodic perturbations added to random circuits is the weaker Luck [65] bound \u03bd \u2265 1/d. Therefore quasiperiodic spatial modulations of the measurement rate leave the universal nature of the MIPT unchanged, as we demonstrate in the supplement [55]. The demonstration of a successful application of the Harris/Luck criteria to measurement induced criticality provides a powerful heuristic to interpret relevant and irrelevant perturbations on this information-theoretic transition. Under this paradigm, future work could begin to understand how topologically-ordered phases and transitions change with static randomness [10].\nAcknowledgements: AZ was supported by a HEERF graduate fellowship, JHP and RV were supported by the Alfred P.

QUASIPERIODIC MEASUREMENT PROFILE\nIn systems where aperiodic structures are introduced, the Luck criterion [65] states that the aperiodicity is relevant when\n\u03c9 > \u03c9c = 1\u2212 1\n\u03bdd , (S1)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c9 < 1 is the wandering exponent. For quasiperiodic structures \u03c9 = 0 and quasiperiodicity is irrelevant when \u03bd \u2265 1/d. This condition is satisfied for our model and we should, therefore, not expect the universality class of the model to change upon introducing the quasiperiodic measurement profile.\nIn the quasiperiodic model, the measurement probability on site x given by\npx = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p cos(Fn\u22122Fn 2\u03c0x )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, (S2)\nwhere p is the tuning parameter and Fn and Fn\u22122 are Fibonacci numbers from the sequence\nFn = 4, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, 84, 136, 220, 356, 576, ... (S3)\nUsing Fn = Fn\u22121 + Fn\u22122 and limn\u2192\u221e Fn+1 Fn = \u03d5, where \u03d5 is the irrational number known as the golden ratio, the period Tn = Fn Fn\u22122 approaches the irrational number 1 + \u03d5.\nWe begin by identifying the critical point of the entanglement transition through finite-size scaling of the tripartite mutual information using the scaling ansatz\nI3 \u223c h[L1/\u03bd(p\u2212 pc)]. (S4)\nWe find that for pc = 0.255(5) and \u03bd = 1.28(2) the data collapses onto a single curve, see Fig. S1a. Compared to the traditional model where px = p = const., the value of pc has increased as expected due to the average measurement rate having been reduced by the cosine modulation, i.e., at each site px \u2264 p so that px \u2192 2p/\u03c0. On the other hand, the value of \u03bd matches well with previous results suggesting the universality class is unchanged [1, 5].\nA similar result is found using the entanglement entropy of a reference qubit, SQ, as an order parameter [56]. Applying a scaling collapse of the data with ansatz\nSQ(t, L) \u223c g[L1/\u03bd(p\u2212 pc), t/Lz] (S5)\nwe find pc = 0.255(5) and \u03bd = 1.30(7), see Fig. S1b. Additionally, the order parameter dynamics at the critical point, SQ(t), can be used to estimate the dynamical exponent z [56]. Fig. S1c shows the data collapses onto a single curve for z = 1.03(2), which is consistent with conformal invariance at the critical point. These results are consistent with the expectation from the Luck criterion that the universality class is unaffected by the introduction quasiperiodic structure.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFIG. S1.

Distribution of I3 in the disordered model\nIn this section, we show how the distribution of the tripartite mutual information can be used as an estimate of the critical point. In Fig. S2, we see that P [I3] has broad tails in the volume law phase which compress towards zero as one moves into the area law phase. Looking at a particular p in the volume law phase, we see that the distribution is broadening with increasing system size and the weight of the distribution at zero, P [I3 = 0], is decreasing. On the other hand, in the area law phase, P [I3 = 0] becomes L independent and approaches 1. We propose the weight of the distrubtion at zero as a way to identify the critical point since it does not require knowing the scaling of I3 only the assumption that it crosses at pc.\nB. Alternative identification of the critical point in the disordered model\nIn this section, we focus on identifying the transition using a data collapse of I3 with the less constrained scaling ansatz,\nI3 \u223c LaF [L1/\u03bd(p\u2212 pc)], (S6)\nto account for any possible L dependence at the critical point. We consider three cases of the scaling function:\n\u2022 In the most general case we choose a, pc, \u03bd to be free parameters (Fig. S3a) \u2022 Based on the \u221a L scaling of S(x, t) at the critical point we fix a = 12 and choose pc, \u03bd to be free parameters\n(Fig. S3b)\n\u2022 Based on the analytical results for large on-site Hilbert space dimension we fix \u03bd = 2 and choose a, pc to be free parameters (Fig. S3c)\nThe results for each of the methods are shown in Table S2 B. In all instances we find similar values for pc, \u03bd, and a that are consistent with the results quoted in the main text that were obtainted from the data collapse of the distribution.\npc \u03bd a\nCase 1 0.15 1.91 0.33\nCase 2 0.14 2.16 0.5\nCase 3 0.15 2 0.24\nP [I3 = 0] 0.14 2.21 \u2013\nS3. PERCOLATION\nThe introduction of static disorder in a generically random model does not change the established connection of the Hartley entropy S0 with bond percolation on a tilted square lattice [2]. The connection to percolation allows us to\n(a) (b) (c)\nFIG. S2. Probability distribution of the tripartite mutual information, P [I3], in the volume law and area law phases.

This result matches the behavior of the entanglement entropy in the disordered circuit model. (c) In contrast with the disordered circuit model, the percolation I3 is independent of the system size at the critical point.\nperform classical calculations to characterize this transition as well. Furthermore, bond percolation on a square lattice has a duality between cut and uncut bonds, allowing us to pin the transition at pc = 1/2 provided the distribution of probabilities is symmetric about 1/2. Therefore, we need to use a different distribution than what is used in the main paper. The distribution we use is\nP (x)dx = D + (D \u2212 1)(1\u2212 2x)2\n(D \u2212 (D \u2212 1)(1\u2212 2x)2)2 dx, (S7)\nwhere D controls the degree of disorder. While this family of distributions naturally sit at the critical point, we can move away from the critical point by using a function x(y) = (1\u2212 q)y/(q + (1\u2212 2q)y) and the distribution changes\nP (y)dy = P [x(y)] dx\ndy dy =\nD + (D \u2212 1)(1\u2212 2x(y))2 (D \u2212 (D \u2212 1)(1\u2212 2x(y))2)2 q(1\u2212 q) (q + (1\u2212 2q)y)2 dy, (S8)\nwhere now q tunes us away from symmetric distributions.\nA. Long cylinder percolation algorithm\nIn order to use percolation to very late \u201ctimes,\u201d we need to find the minimal cuts on very long cylinders at the edge of the system. Standard percolation algorithms build the entire percolating network as a sparse matrix which implies O(L2T 2) operations; however, we can focus on the leading edge, calculating all minimal cuts on that edge for O(L3T ) operations.\nThe basic idea of the algorithm is given in Fig. S5. After constructing the dual lattice, the minimal cut has been reduced to a shortest-path algorithm with some bonds that have weight 0 (cut bonds) and some that have weight 1 (uncut bonds). In this language, a cut starting between sites 2i \u2212 1 and 2i (or 2i and 2i + 1) and ending between sites 2j \u2212 1 and 2j (2j and 2j + 1) during even (odd) time steps is represented by a shortest path between i and j on\nS4\nFIG. S5. (a) The underlying qubit circuit (gray lines) with the overlaid tilted square lattice. Notice how vertical \u201czig-zags\u201d represent the individual qubits now (red line is qubit 2i). The bottom shows how we represent measurements (a dashed line on the dual tilted square lattice). (b) The leading edge graph where the vertices at time T are fully connected but with weights that are equal to the shortest path on the tilted square lattice originally. (c) The time-step graph created from adding on the next layer along with bonds that are either weight 1 or 0. This new graph has shortest weighted paths that are the same length as the tilted square lattice.\nthe dual lattice [see Fig. S5(a)]. Once calculated, we replace our dual graph with a graph where each i and j on the leading edge is connected by a bond whose weight is precisely its shortest path. If we then build up the next time step, we can use those shortest paths along with new bonds connecting the layers to compute new shortest paths, without needing the full dual lattice.\nSome definitions: The dual graph at time T is defined by the vertices labeled by (i, t) for a position 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L/2 and a time 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T as in Fig. S5(a). Furthermore, it is a weighted graph where the weight is 0 if it crosses a broken bond (measurement) and 1 if it crosses an intact bond (no measurement). We define mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (i, j) as the length of the shortest path on the dual graph at time T between (i, T ) and (j, T ). Next, we define the leading-edge graph at time T as a complete, weighted graph on L/2 vertices with the weights defined by Wij = mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (i, j), see Fig. S5(b). Last, we define the time-step graph from T to T + 1 as the graph made by taking the leading-edge graph at time T and connecting L/2 new vertices labeled (i, T + 1) with connectivity and weights inherited from the dual graph at time T + 1, see Fig. S5(c).\nThe algorithm is then based on the following simple theorem: Theorem The quantity mincut1\u2264t\u2264T+1(i, j) is equal to the length of shortest path of (i, T + 1) to (j, T + 1) on the time-step graph from T to T + 1. Proof : Let the shortest path on the dual graph of time T + 1 from vertex (i, T + 1) to (j, T + 1) be labelled by consecutive bonds (b1, b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bN ). We can break this up into paths that exist purely on bonds that go from time T to T + 1 and bonds that go between all other times. Breaking up those paths, the geometry of the tilted square lattice implies the path is equivalent to the ordered set (`1, r1, `2, r2, . . . , rM\u22121, `M ) where \u2211 j |`j |+ \u2211 k |rk| = N .\nIf rk goes from point (a, T ) to (b, T ), we first need to show |rk| = mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (a, b). This is easily established by\nS5\ncontradiction: if |rk| > mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (a, b), then we can just choose the minimal path since no vertices on the T + 1 layer are within rk, contradicting our statement that the original path (b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 bN ) was the shortest path. On the other hand, if |rk| < mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (a, b), then since rk does not include vertices on the T + 1 layer, it would be a path on the dual graph of time T that is shorter than the mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (a, b), contradicting its definition.\nFinally, on the time-step graph from T to T + 1 take the path (`1, r\u03031, `2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r\u0303M\u22121, `M ) where r\u03032 goes directly from (a, T ) to (b, T ) on the bond of weight mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (a, b). By definition of the weights on the time-step graph, this path has a length equal to the length on the dual graph at time T + 1. If a shorter path can be created, we can similarly break it up (`\u20321, r\u0303 \u2032 1, ` \u2032 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r\u0303\u2032M \u2032\u22121, `\u2032M \u2032) however, this corresponds to a path where r\u0303\u2032j is replaced by a path on the dual graph of time T r\u2032j that is of the same length, and therefore we have constructed a path on the dual graph of time T that is shorter than our original, a contradiction, proving the theorem.\nWith this theorem, we need only keep track of Wij(T ) = mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (i, j) and the connections\nCij(T + 1) =  1 if (i, T ) to (j, T + 1) crosses an unmeasured bond, 0 if (i, T ) to (j, T + 1) crosses a measured bond,\n\u221e if not adjacent. (S9)\nThe full weighted bond matrix for the time-step graph is then\nW(T + 1) =\n( W (T ) CT (T + 1)\nC(T + 1) D\n) , (S10)\nwhere Dii = 0 and Dij = \u221e if i 6= j. Since W is L \u00d7 L, we can now perform the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm to find all Wij(T + 1). In this way, all minimal cuts can be constructed via an initial minimal cut matrix W0\n1. W (0)\u2190W0\n2. For t = 1 to T : Generate C(t) matrix, construct W(t) with W (t\u2212 1) and C(t), and perform Floyd-Warshall on W(t) to find W (t).\n3. return W (T ).\nThe expensive part of this algorithm is the Floyd-Warshall step which scales as L3, making the run time for this algorithm O(L3T ). In particular, for exponential times, this algorithm wins over algorithms that scale like T 2. This is why we call it the long-cylinder percolation algorithm.\nB. Percolation results\nWe focus on using the distribution in the strongly disordered D = 10 case. The percolation probabilities apply to bonds that correspond to the qubits they correspond to; so for instance, all the red bonds in Fig. S5(a) have a probability pi drawn from the distribution Eq. (S7). Here, we can simulate a fully entangled state by initializing the weights W0 as purely off-diagonal with each diagonal Wi,i+l = 2l (with indices mod L/2), and a product state just uses W0 = 0.\nDefining the half-cut entropy as S(L) = mincut1\u2264t\u2264T (i, i + L/4) (the Hartley entropy), we obtain Fig. S4(a) and see it takes exponentially long time to saturate the half-cut entropy. Furthermore, by looking at Fig. S4(b), we can clearly see scaling that S(L) \u223c \u221a L as is expected for the strong disorder. Lastly, we can also compute I3 with a combination of minimal cuts and observe that it is roughly L independent within error bars, see Fig. S4(c).\nS4. STATISTICAL MECHANICS MODEL AND RSRG\nLet us consider a monitored Haar quantum circuit with measurements occurring with a site-dependent probability pi. Entanglement properties of quantum trajectories can be mapped onto a classical replicated statistical mechanics model whose degrees of freedom are permutations of the replicas [6, 25]. The quenched probabilities of measurement then translates into some columnar quenched disorder in the statistical mechanics description. We remark that the analysis in this section is not completely rigorous as we do not formally prove that our analytic continuation used in the replica limit is unique. However, despite the lack of a rigorous justification, there is strong evidence from known\nS6\nresults for clean Potts models that one can prove such a uniqueness result [68]. Instead, we attribute a plausible explanation for the numerically observed differences between the percolation and Clifford critical theories mentioned in the main text to finite-q corrections that could potentially affect the critical behavior as in the clean case [6].\nIn the limit of infinite onsite Hilbert space dimension (q \u2192 \u221e), we have a Potts model with k! states where k is the number of replicas, defined on a tilted square lattice [6, 25]\nZ = \u2211 gi\u2208Sk \u220f \u3008i,j\u3009 ( (1\u2212 p\u3008i,j\u3009)\u03b4gi,gj + p\u3008i,j\u3009 ) . (S11)\nThe tilted square lattice is a square lattice rotated by 45 degrees. Each site of the tilted square lattice corresponds to a unitary gate in the original circuit. The degrees of freedom (\u201cspins\u201d) of the statistical model are permutations gi \u2208 Sk defined on those sites, with fixed boundary conditions on the top layer of the circuit set by the entanglement properties one is interested in [6, 25]. Here, the measurement probabilities p\u3008i,j\u3009 are inhomogeneous only in the spatial direction, and constant in the vertical (imaginary time) direction. The degrees of freedom in the Potts model are permutations, but this does not matter in that limit, beyond the fact that there are k! states with k \u2192 1 in the replica limit.\nThe replica limit corresponds to percolation with columnar quenched disorder, which we here analyze using strong disorder RG techniques. It is known that the critical random Ising (k = 2) and k!-state Potts model for k! integer are described by infinite random fixed points [46, 61]. In order to take the replica limit k \u2192 1 in a controlled way, we derive an algebraic real space renormalization group (RSRG) approach to the Potts model, which allows us to analytically continue the number of states k! to any real number.\nThe first step is to notice that the transfer matrix of the Potts model (S11) on the tilted square lattice can be written in terms of operators ei, which generate the so-called Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra [68]. This algebraic formulation will allow us to work with any representation of the Potts model, in terms of spins, clusters or loop gas, which in turn will allow us to take the replica limit in the end. The TL algebra consists of all the words written with the N \u2212 1 generators ei (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1), subject to the relations\n[ei, ej ] = 0 for |i\u2212 j| \u2265 2, (S12a) e2i = \u221a k!ei, (S12b)\neiei\u00b11ei = ei, (S12c)\nUp to a normalization factor 1/ \u221a k!, the operators ei can be thought of as projectors. For example, for k = 2 we have an Ising model and the TL generators read\ne2i\u22121 = 1\u221a 2 (1 + \u03c3xi ) ,\ne2i = 1\u221a 2\n( 1 + \u03c3zi \u03c3 z i+1 ) . (S13a)\nFor the k!-state Potts model, we have\ne2i\u22121 = 1\u221a k! 1 + \u2211 gi 6=g\u2032i |gi\u3009\u3008g\u2032i|  , e2i = \u221a k! \u03b4gi,gi+1 . (S14a)\nInstead of working with a transfer matrix, it turns out to be more convenient to consider some anisotropic Hamiltonian limit. In the language of the original monitored circuits, this corresponds to considering the limit of continuous time (gates close to the identity), and weak measurements. Using the usual classical to quantum mapping, the universal properties of this statistical mechanics model can be inferred from the 1+1d effective Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212 N\u22121\u2211 i=1 Ji ei\u221a k! , (S15)\nwhere Ji > 0 are random positive parameters, that are related to the original random probabilities pi in a limit of continuous time and weak measurements. Note that eq. (S15) combined with (S13) and (S14) corresponds to the familiar Hamiltonians for the Ising and Potts quantum chains. Criticality is obtained by enforcing the same distribution of the couplings Ji on odd and even bonds, which in terms of the original probabilities can be achieved through a statistical symmetry pi \u2194 1 \u2212 pi as in the percolation problem above. Note that at this stage, the Potts\nS7\nmodel is formulated purely algebraically, and the number of states k! can be analytically continued to a real number. In particular, we can consider a representation of the Potts model in terms of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters [68], where each cluster carries a Boltzmann weight k!: this corresponds to a different representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, where k can be tuned continuously. The algebraic RSRG approach we derive below applies to any representation.\nAs we will now show, the groundstate properties of the system can be understood in terms of a RSRG approach that can be carried out using only the commutation relations (S12) of the TL algebra. As usual within the RSRG approach, we identify the strongest bond \u2126 = Ji of the chain, solve the corresponding local Hamiltonian H0 = \u2212\u2126ei/ \u221a k! and deal\nwith the rest of the Hamiltonian V = H\u2212H0 = \u2212Ji\u22121ei\u22121/ \u221a k!\u2212Ji+1ei+1/ \u221a k!+ . . . perturbatively. The groundstate\nmanifold is defined by the projector Pi = ei/ \u221a k! and we also define P\u0304i = 1 \u2212 Pi. The effective Hamiltonian in the groundstate manifold can be obtained using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation Heff = e iSHe\u2212iS \u2212 H0 where S is obtained perturbatively in V by requiring [Pi, e iS ] = 0, that is, by requiring that U = eiS decouples the low and high energy sectors PiH and P\u0304iH of the Hilbert space H. One then finds S = 1i\u2126 (P\u0304iV Pi \u2212 PiV P\u0304i) + . . . and the resulting effective Hamiltonian is given by Heff = Pi(V + [iS, V ]\u2212 12{S\n2, H0}+ SH0S + . . . )Pi. Using (S12), we find the first order term PiV Pi = \u2212(Ji\u22121 +Ji+1)/k!Pi which acts as a constant in the subspace generated by Pi. The second order term then reads Pi([iS, V ]\u2212 12{S 2, H0}+ SH0S + . . . )Pi = \u22121/\u2126\u00d7 PiV P\u0304iV Pi which yields, using (S12)\nHPieff = CPi \u2212 2Ji\u22121Ji+1\nk!\u2126\ne\u0303eff\u221a k! , (S16)\nwhere C is a constant that will renormalize the energy: the energy shift after the decimation is \u2212\u2126 + C, with C = \u2212Ji+1+Ji\u22121k! + 1 \u2126\n( (Ji+1+Ji\u22121) 2\n(k!)2 \u2212 J2i+1+J 2 i\u22121 k!\n) , and\ne\u0303eff = 1\u221a k! eiei\u22121ei+1ei, (S17)\nis an effective TL generator is the low-energy subspace PiH. It is indeed straightforward to verify that e\u03032eff = \u221a k!e\u0303eff , e\u0303effei\u00b12e\u0303eff \u2212 e\u0303eff = 0 and Pi(ei\u00b12e\u0303effei\u00b12 \u2212 ei\u00b12)Pi = 0. This simple calculation allows us to derive the expression of the effective coupling\nJeff = 2\nk! Ji\u22121Ji+1 \u2126 , (S18)\npurely algebraically. This process can be iterated by identifying the next largest coupling in the chain, and decimating it in the same way. The recursion relation (S18) agrees with previous results in the case where k! is an integer [46, 61], but the upshot of the above algebraic approach is that it allows us to analytically continue to k real. In particular, this recursion relation also applies in the replica limit k \u2192 1, where it describes percolation in media with columnar disorder.\nFor any value of k! and for strong enough initial randomness in the couplings Ji > 0, the recursion relation (S18)\nis known to flow to an infinite randomness fixed point with space time scaling log t \u223c \u221a `. The scaling properties discussed in the main text then follow from standard RSRG results [46, 48\u201350]. Those predictions also agree with earlier results on percolation in media with columnar disorder [60]."
