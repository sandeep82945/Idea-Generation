Detailed Investigation of ANS Function in PWS Across Different Age Groups: Given that Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) affects individuals throughout their lifespan, conducting longitudinal and cross-sectional studies across various age groups could provide insights into how ANS dysfunction evolves over time in PWS patients. This research could also explore how puberty, aging, and hormonal changes impact ANS function in PWS.

Comparative Studies on the Effectiveness of Therapeutic Interventions: Investigate the impact of various therapeutic interventions (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, growth hormone therapy, modafinil for sleep disturbances) on ANS function in PWS. This could include randomized controlled trials to assess improvements in autonomic symptoms, metabolic profiles, and overall quality of life.

Molecular and Genetic Studies to Uncover Underlying Mechanisms: Given the genetic basis of PWS, further studies could focus on identifying the specific genetic mutations and their pathways that lead to ANS dysfunction. This research could involve detailed molecular genetic testing, including the role of specific genes like necdin and MAGEL2 in autonomic regulation, and how these influence clinical phenotypes in PWS.

Development of Non-Invasive, Comprehensive ANS Testing Protocols for Children: The current study highlighted challenges in administering autonomic function tests to children. Future research could focus on developing and validating non-invasive, child-friendly testing protocols that accurately assess ANS function. This could enhance the diagnostic process and monitoring of ANS-related symptoms in pediatric populations, including those with PWS.

Exploration of Neuroendocrine and Autonomic Interactions in PWS: Given the complex interplay between the autonomic nervous system and hormone regulation in PWS, studies could explore the relationship between ANS dysfunction and neuroendocrine abnormalities (such as hyperghrelinemia). Research could also investigate the effects of altered ANS function on food intake, satiety signals, and metabolic disturbances in PWS, potentially uncovering new therapeutic targets.
