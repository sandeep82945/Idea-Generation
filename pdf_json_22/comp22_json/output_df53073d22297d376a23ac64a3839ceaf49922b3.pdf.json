    "abstractText": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum classical algorithm designed for current and near-term quantum devices. Despite its initial success, there is a lack of understanding involving several of its key aspects. There are problems with VQE that forbid a favorable scaling towards quantum advantage. In order to alleviate the problems, we propose and extensively test a quantum annealing inspired heuristic that supplements VQE. The improved VQE enables an efficient initial state-preparation mechanism, in a recursive manner, for a quasidynamical unitary evolution. We conduct an in-depth scaling analysis of finding the ground-state energies with increasing lattice sizes of the Heisenberg model, employing simulations of up to 40 qubits that manipulate the complete state vector. In addition to systematically finding the ground-state energy, we observe that it avoids barren plateaus, escapes local minima, and works with low-depth circuits. For the current devices, we further propose a benchmarking toolkit using a mean-field model and test it on IBM Q devices. Realistic gate execution times estimate a longer computational time to complete the same computation on a fully functional error-free quantum computer than on a quantum computer emulator implemented on a classical computer. However, our proposal can be expected to help accurate estimations of the ground-state energies beyond 50 qubits when the complete state vector can no longer be stored on a classical computer, thus enabling quantum advantage.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of quantum computing has seen a growing interest in developing useful applications for current and near-future quantum devices. Currently, and in the foreseeable future, quantum devices are expected to remain error prone due to noise and decoherence. Hybrid quantum classical algorithms, which are to some extent resilient to errors, have been proposed to integrate quantum and classical resources [1\u20136]. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) [2,7] and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm [8\u201310] are among the proposed candidates to address chemical and combinatorial optimization problems, respectively. Prototype problems have been experimentally demonstrated [11\u201315]. Simulations have also analyzed such variational methods [16\u201319].\nDespite the progress, all demonstrated applications fall within the small-scale proof-of-concept domain.

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nVQE has a simple description, there is a lack of thorough understanding when applied beyond a small number of qubits. Recent works have suggested that such explorative endeavors, which are expected to require large numbers of parameters, will encounter barren plateaus [20] in the energy landscapes, diminishing all hope for quantum advantage. Furthermore, hitherto alternative problems in the largely unexplored large-scale simulations may be waiting for us. Thus, it is of immediate relevance to investigate VQE beyond the small scale to establish a potential quantum advantage.\nIn this work, with a focus on the Heisenberg model, we contribute in three major aspects. First, we propose and test a general \u201cevolution\u201d heuristic that can, by construction, systematically lower the ground-state energy. We benchmark the performance of the heuristic on one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices, as well as several randomly generated Hamiltonians. Second, we perform large-scale simulations of VQE using an ideal quantum computer emulator and analyze the performance trend as a function of an increasing number of qubits. Last, we study the experimental realizations of our methods. We ask whether finite samples are sufficient to accurately approximate the ground-state energy. We propose and test a benchmarking toolkit suitable for current and future devices, using a physically relevant problem.\n2331-7019/23/19(2)/024047(16) 024047-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we review the working of VQE and discuss the current problems that variational simulations face. In Sec. III, the theory of a \u201cstate-evolution\u201d heuristic is introduced, which builds upon VQE. In Sec. IV, the heuristic is tested for the Heisenberg model and randomly generated Hamiltonians. In Sec. V, we move on to large-scale applications of VQE and systematically study the performance for increasing lattice sizes. In Sec. VI, we discuss the relevant aspects for experimental realization, propose and test the benchmarking toolkit, and discuss if quantum advantage is feasible through VQE for the Heisenberg model.\nII. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM EIGENSOLVER\nFigure 1 visualizes the working of the VQE. As a hybrid method, it requires a quantum and a classical processing unit. The calculation is started by giving some initial parameters as input to the classical unit. The quantum unit prepares a problem-specific initial state and takes as input the variational parameters suitably placed in a quantum circuit that needs to be executed on the device. After the execution, a measurement gives the output as a sequence of bits whereby each bit corresponds to the measurement outcome of each qubit. The bitstring is transferred to the classical unit, which is tasked to accumulate the bitstrings and calculate the energy once a certain number of bitstrings\nis reached. The calculated energy is fed to a classical optimization algorithm, optimizer in short, which computes the next set of parameters with the aim that successive iterations minimize (or maximize) the energy. When some internal criteria of the optimizer are met, it stops the procedure. The last (or lowest) calculated energy is then the ground-state energy.\nAlthough the variational quantum eigensolver has been originally proposed in the context of quantum chemistry, the idea is general and readily usable for physics (and other) problems. We focus on its application to the quantum spin model given by\nH = N\u2211\n\u3008i,j \u3009 Jij \u03c3 i \u00b7 \u03c3 j , (1)\nwhere \u3008i, j \u3009 are pairs on a hypercube lattice of N sites, \u03c3 \u2208 {\u03c3 x, \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z} are the Pauli matrices, and J > 0. One benefit of studying spin models, in contrast to fermionic ones, is that such models find direct mappings to qubits and do not require transformations [21\u201323] that may yield prohibitively long circuits.\nWe analyze the model for simple one-, two-, and threedimensional lattices visualized in Fig. 2. A horizontal or vertical layer illustrates a two-dimensional lattice and the edges of such a layer, a one-dimensional ring. Regardless of the dimension of the model, each spin interacts only with the nearest neighbor(s), shown through dotted lines. The alternating configuration of spins shown in Fig. 2 is called the N\u00e9el state. For an even number of spins, the ground state is found in the zero-magnetization sector. The mapping of the spins to qubits is straightforward; all spins pointing up are mapped to the initial state |0\u3009 and those antiparallel to |1\u3009. For the example shown in Fig. 2, the preparation step of the quantum processing unit in Fig. 1\n024047-2\nleaves the state |0\u3009 unchanged for spins pointing in one direction and flips it to |1\u3009 for those in the other direction."

            "text": "Several factors play a role in variational methods. We briefly discuss the essential modules.\nOptimizer: tasked with lowering the energy at successive iterations and stopping the calculation, an optimizer plays a central role. There are two broad categories of optimizers: gradient-based and gradient-free. Depending on whether a device or an (ideal) emulator is used, each has its own merits and drawbacks. This work focuses on gradientbased optimizers since they converge faster for noise-free energy evaluations [24]. We use the sequential leastsquares programming (SLSQP) and Broyden-FletcherGoldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithms [25\u201328]. For use on a quantum device, efficient (stochastic) methods have been developed [29\u201334].\nAnsatz: the choice of an ansatz is crucial to algorithms. As the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era [35] devices can handle only low depth circuits, we focus on these. In this paper, we examine a few different ansatzes that produce low-depth circuits and require a small number of parameters.\nInitial state: the optimization process can be significantly accelerated if an efficient initial state is known for the problem. An example is the Hartree-Fock state in quantum chemistry [36,37]. For our problem, it is the N\u00e9el state [38,39].\nInitial parameters: in order to take advantage of a specific initial state, the parameters in an ansatz also need to be appropriately chosen. Clever choices of initial parameters help avoid barren plateaus [6,40\u201342]. In contrast, random initialization consists of randomly choosing each parameter\u2019s value in the interval [0, 2\u03c0)."

(1) focus towards implementation on current devices [11,43] as well as outlining efficient schemes for similar problems [44,45]. They consider a few qubits and one dimension only. The one-dimensional isotropic case of the model is analytically solvable using the Bethe ansatz\n[46]. Attempts have been made to implement VQE for this model on a quantum computer [47,48].\nEven for small problems requiring a few qubits, the global minimum of the multidimensional rugged energy landscapes can be surrounded by multiple local minima. A simple numerical demonstration to show this is carried out as follows. We implement the \u201csimple\u201d case of onedimensional isotropic antiferromagnetic rings with different numbers of spins. The BFGS optimizer is restarted 100 times, and the parameters are assigned randomly from the interval [0, 2\u03c0). It suffices to count unique values of energy for the purpose of demonstration. We accommodate the fact that the minima may be a valley (in multidimensions) by rounding from floating-point precision to 10\u22123 for the counting. Figure 3(a) shows the number of local minima, Ml, per 100 trials. For larger (N \u2265 7) problem sizes, the landscapes have multiple local minima. Figure 3(b) shows that the average energy for 100 runs is very close to the ground state in all cases, demonstrating that when the local minima exist, they surround the global minimum. Therefore, it is vital that variational methods are equipped with a procedure to escape from local minima. Recent works in this direction are limited and resource expensive [49].\nDespite the fact that the system memory, which doubles per qubit, for simulating up to about 30 qubits is available on modern personal computers, medium-scale simulations of the model given in Eq. (1) beyond 15 qubits are rare in the literature. One reason for this is that the memory requirement is not the only barrier to such simulations. Large circuit depths and thousands of iterations required to reach reasonable accuracy demand considerable resources beyond the small scale. For example, Ref. [50] reported that the simulations for the one-dimensional spin model\n024047-3\nfor 20 qubits required a week even with 192 CPU cores. We accommodate the resource demand for our simulations on a supercomputer [51] using a massively parallel emulator [52,53]. The same emulator performed quantum verification in the supremacy experiment [54].\nThe phenomenon of barren plateaus [20,55\u201358] is seen as a significant hurdle for increasing the problem sizes. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the number of parameters as low as possible without sacrificing accuracy, not only to avoid barren plateaus but also to keep the total computational time to a minimum. Without actually performing large-scale simulations, it remains untested whether such problems can be effectively countered. Methods to tackle all the above-mentioned obstacles are essential for leveraging the power of future quantum devices using VQE. We address some of these problems in the present work."

(3)\nLet U( ) represent the unitary operators corresponding to the optimized numeric values of the parameters. In order to avoid mixing of the optimized and unoptimized parameters, we denote the optimized parameters with . In our notation, the VQE performs the task U(\u03b8) \u2192 U( ). The state, after the optimizer signals convergence, is given by\n| 1\u3009 = U( )| 0\u3009. (4)\nWe propose that the final state from Eq.

To make use of | \u3009 from cycle p at cycle p + 1, the parameters in Up+1(\u03b8) need to be appropriately chosen, otherwise the progress is lost.\nThis means Up+1(\u03b8) should initially be an identity circuit [59]. Therefore, a suitable choice for our ansatz is \u03b8 = [0, . . . , 0], where by avoiding an initialization at random in the energy landscape we avoid possible barren plateaus [20]."

            "text": "In proposing Eq. (6), it is assumed that the U(\u03b8) at each cycle is the product of the same unitary operators. This assumption can be relaxed, such that for each evolution cycle, U(\u03b8) contains either a different combination or a different set of unitary operators. In the former case, the number of parameters M for all evolution cycles will remain the same. In the latter case, there are two possibilities: (a) \u2265 M operators or (b) \u2264 M operators. For near-term devices, option (b) is of considerable interest due to limited resources. For option (b), the maximum number of \u201cactively\u201d utilized parameters during each evolution cycle is M . Keeping the number of parameters in a circuit low has at least two benefits for our VQE simulations. First, a low number of parameters helps the classical gradient-based optimizer to converge quicker since fewer gradient computations are required per iteration. Second, the construction of the ansatz is such that the circuit depth is directly proportional to the number of parameters. Thus, a lower number of parameters implies lower-depth circuits, and therefore usage of less computational resources.\nWhen building a different U(\u03b8) at each cycle, it is currently unclear how to choose the best one for a given Hamiltonian. Adaptive methods [60\u201364] to build each operator one by one solve this problem but are computationally expensive. Due to the absence of a cost-effective way to ascertain a new U(\u03b8) for each cycle, we use the same one for each cycle. As our numerical investigations show in the following sections, this simple approach has significant benefits. However, even without the numerical evidence, Eq. (5) tells us that the number of active parameters during VQE can be carefully kept below a threshold and for each new cycle of evolution different unitary operators can be made accessible. This allows for expanding the parameter space at a minimal expense of a polynomial increase in the circuit depths.\nIn Ref. [65], a similar approach with the difference that parameters added in each cycle can be optimized together with the previous parameters was suggested, and demonstrated for an eight-qubit circuit only. It has been shown to be useful for combinatorial optimization problems [66]. Another similar technique involves changing the Hamiltonian at each iteration [67]."

Since an optimizer in the VQE algorithm is designed only to accept those parameters that ultimately lower the energy, the construction of the evolution heuristic guarantees that the energy is either lowered or stays constant. For p \u2192 \u221e, one can imagine choosing the parameters such that the state evolution corresponds to an adiabatic evolution. A similar line of thought has helped to develop the quantum approximate optimization algorithm [8] and rapidly quenched quantum annealing [69].\nFrom a numerical simulation perspective, the small or large but ultimately finite value of p depends on the computational resources required for each cycle. Our numerical evidence shows that indeed by increasing p , there is a systematic decrease in energy. We discuss these results in the following sections. Our numerical evidence suggests that the evolution method is a useful heuristic."

If an ansatz can accurately represent the ground-state energy of a given problem, optimization of the parameters may still pose problems, and the evolution heuristic can help overcome them. On the other hand, if an ansatz has a poor overlap with the ground state, the heuristic can still help achieve quasioptimal results. The ansatz we consider approximates the ground-state energy reasonably well, but not exactly, for the larger problems of interest [70]. The\nansatz is given by\nU(\u03b8) = l=1 k=l+1\u220f\nl=N\u22121 k=N\nUlk(\u03b8lk)\nl=1 k=l+1\u220f\nl=N\u22121 k=N\nUkl(\u03b8kl), (9)\nwhere\nUkl(\u03b8kl) = { e\u2212i\u03b8kl\u03c3 y k \u03c3 x l if k = N or l = N ,\ne\u2212i\u03b8kl\u03c3 y k \u03c3 x l \u03c3 z N otherwise.\n(10)\nThe number of unitary operators in this ansatz is given by N (N \u2212 1). We note that, as pointed out previously in Refs. [71\u201373], the ordering of the factors in Eq. (9) is relevant. Any other ordering can produce results that may be different from one another. We name the specific combination of the factors in Eq. (9) as the XY ansatz. The operators defined in Eq. (10) can be easily implemented in terms of single- and two-qubit gates on a quantum circuit. The details about the implementation are given in Appendix A.\nThe choice of the XY ansatz is motivated by three empirical considerations. First, the ansatz produces low-depth circuits that can be implemented on near-term quantum devices. Second, the parametrized gate is always placed on only one qubit. Due to manufacturing imperfections, not all qubits in a device perform equally well, and the XY ansatz allows the best performing qubit to implement the parametrized gates. For current devices having higher twoqubit gate error rates, the best performing qubit may be the best connected qubit. Third, the ansatz has an all-to-one connectivity between the qubits, which is easier to implement in devices, in contrast to an all-to-all connectivity [65]."

Three types of strategies are used, namely, RI; initialization from the N\u00e9el state (NS) where the parameters are initialized as zeros; and the evolution heuristic. We calculate the energy fidelity given by the ratio of the final energy obtained using VQE and the ground-state energy. As shown in Fig. 4(a), for N \u2264 6, NS performs just as well as the best out of 100 RI optimization runs\u2014both can find the ground-state energy. The\n024047-5\naverage performance of RI, however, begins to deteriorate for N \u2265 6. Keeping the RI runs to 100, we observe a significant drop in the average performance as N increases. The drop in the performance can be understood from the perspective that as the number of parameters is increased, a larger number of restarts would be required to keep up the performance. Meanwhile, if the best RI run is better than NS, it is only slightly so. On the other hand, the initial energy for NS is lower than RI, requiring fewer energy evaluations until optimization convergence (data not shown). Thus, NS achieves similar accuracy by reducing the huge computational cost from 100 RI runs to just one run.\nWe perform our evolution heuristic on the final state at the end of the optimization of NS. In this way, we leverage the |\u03c81\u3009 obtained after the optimizer gets stuck in a local minimum for each N \u2265 7. We know that these are local minima because RI runs find a lower energy. For each evolution cycle, we use the same U(\u03b8), and the stopping criterion is when the change in energy is less than 10\u22124. As initial parameters we use zeros for each new cycle, the reason for which is discussed in Appendix B. The results are shown in Fig. 4(b). The odd-spin lattices have relatively lower energy fidelities due to the degeneracy of the ground state. Our heuristic further increases the energy fidelities in all cases, beyond the best of RI runs and significantly better than the average of RI runs. The evolution heuristic successfully overcomes several local minima for all N . One way to interpret how it overcomes is as follows. Once an optimizer gets stuck, a new cycle is started, which can be seen as another VQE process but with a new initial\nstate. Such a configuration change creates a restructuring of the energy landscape where a larger or different part of the Hilbert space becomes accessible. The energy obtained from the initial parameters loaded in the new cycle is no longer located at a local minimum as in the previous cycle. Using the evolution heuristic, we get the triple benefit of having a smaller parameter space, low-depth circuit, as well as a higher energy fidelity."

(11) is analytically solvable for J xxij = J yyij = J zzij = 1, the energy for a finite subset with random coefficients can only be computed numerically.\nWe generate two sets of random Hamiltonians, specifically for N = 6 and N = 8. In the case of N = 6, we use only half the number of operators in the XY ansatz, which in itself produces a different ansatz. Since the XY ansatz can be split into a product of two groups of unitary operators U2(\u03b82)U1(\u03b81)| 0\u3009, we use only U1(\u03b81) as the ansatz. We prepare the system in the N\u00e9el state. We initialize the parameters randomly for each experiment and perform the evolution on the state obtained. Each evolution cycle uses the same U(\u03b8). In Fig. 5(a), we show the results for the N = 6 case. For each of the 1000 experiments, we perform ten calculations per experiment such that after the first VQE calculation there are nine evolution cycles. We plot the ratio of the final energy E(1) obtained using VQE (blue squares) and the final energy E(2) calculated (orange dots) after the evolution cycles performed on the final state obtained from VQE. In the case of N = 8, we use the XY ansatz, and all other settings are the same as in the N = 6 case. The results are shown in Fig. 5(b). From the results, we observe that the heuristic also works for N = 8. We observe that there is a significant improvement in the energy by using the evolution heuristic.\nThe fact that E(1)/E(2) < 1 in a large sample of random experiments for both test cases shows that the heuristic is useful in further increasing the energy fidelity without requiring a larger parameter space. While the evolution heuristic does not guarantee to find the global optimum, i.e., a fidelity of 1.0 (data not shown), the results from this section show that it can produce quasioptimal energy fidelities that would otherwise require a large number of\n024047-6\nrandomly initialized optimization runs. Furthermore, the simple approach of using the same U(\u03b8) for each evolution cycle appears useful for a relatively large set of problems."

For the purpose of demonstration, we perform only a few evolution cycles per lattice, given by the green crosses. Each cycle is observed to increase the energy fidelity indicated by the crosses moving higher up. Similarly, Fig. 6(b) shows the results for ladder and square lattices of dimensions up to 13 \u00d7 2 and 6 \u00d7 6, respectively. Except for 6 \u00d7 6, all two-dimensional lattices are chosen to have open boundary conditions. The energy per spin for the largest ladder and square lattices, after one evolution cycle, are \u22122.216 and \u22122.647 as compared to the ground state energy per spin \u22122.261 and \u22122.715, obtained by the Lanczos method\n[74]. Note that J = 1 and the Hamiltonian has dimensionless units. In all large-scale simulations, the low-depth XY ansatz can find the ground-state energy with a fidelity greater than 96%. We observe that while a single evolution cycle increases the energy fidelity, for the two-dimensional lattices, the second cycle did not produce any variation in the energy. Furthermore, the convergence of the evolution heuristic to the ground state appears to slow down as the ring size increases. A possible reason for both observations is the breakdown of the assumption that the same U(\u03b8) is a good candidate for each cycle, suggesting that some other ansatz should be tested in the future.\nThe largest system that we simulate is a 40-qubit isotropic ladder. Since the time required to perform one energy calculation is large, we remove some of the parameters. In order to remove the parameters, we rewrite the two product terms in Eq. (9) as U2(\u03b82)U1(\u03b81)| 0\u3009, and consider only U1, which contains then only half of the parameters. Further, we roughly follow the rule l + 10 \u2265 k > l and reduce the parameters from 1560 originally to a more manageable 400. After four iterations, the energy\n024047-7\nper spin is \u22121.966 (without evolution), which is significantly lower than the N\u00e9el-state energy \u22121.5. The ground and first excited state energies are \u22122.312 and \u22122.262, respectively, found using the Lanczos algorithm. The VQE energy estimate is considerably higher than the groundstate energy, which can be explained as follows. Firstly, restricted by the computational time required, the estimate uses only the standard VQE. Lastly, the number of parameters in the XY ansatz is heavily reduced, resulting in reduced performance.\nWe also study the evolution heuristic for the 40-qubit ladder. We reduce the parameters even further with the rule k = l + 1 (using U1 only) to 40. Let us denote the resulting product of operators as U40(\u03b8)| 0\u3009. We perform two evolutions after the initial standard VQE energy of \u22121.867 with the same U40(\u03b8) per cycle, with a few iterations only, to obtain the energy per spin \u22121.878. The evolution heuristic can lower the energy even for a very small parameter space. Due to the construction of the heuristic, a different U(\u03b8) may prove helpful in further improving the energy estimate. This is a task for future work."

Most protocols involve physically irrelevant tasks, although the hope for future quantum computers is to solve physically relevant problems, e.g., in physics or chemistry. The Heisenberg Hamiltonian could be a candidate. However, the XY ansatz we present requires all-to-one connectivity between the qubits. Although all-to-all connectivity is native to the trapped-ion devices [75], the number of functional qubits remains low. Alternatively, current superconducting devices, among others, which mostly offer neither all-toall nor all-to-one connectivity but other benefits, are also dominant in the research community. Considering the limited qubit connectivities of the current devices, we propose that the mean-field Hamiltonian, given by Eq. (11) with J \u03b1\u03b1ij = 1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 {x, y, z}, is a suitable candidate for benchmarking. The ground-state energy of the Hamiltonian is given by a simple and easy to verify [76] expression 3(a \u2212 N )/2 where a = 1 for odd N and a = 0 for even N .\nWe propose a very low-depth \u201cmean-field ansatz\u201d well suited for the mean-field Hamiltonian. With a constant circuit depth of five, independent of the number of qubits, the mean-field ansatz accurately recovers the ground state of the model using only up to N/2 parameters. The details of the mean-field ansatz are given in Appendix C. In Fig. 7, we show numerical evidence that the ansatz can recover the ground-state energy for N \u2264 40. Since the ground-state energy for the model is the same for N even and N even + 1 spins, for an odd number of spins we consider only N \u2264 15. The solution is easily verified by setting all parameters \u03b8i = \u03c0/2 for i = 1, . . . , N/2. Therefore, in general, the mean-field ansatz and Hamiltonians are simple\n024047-8\nbenchmarks for physics problems on the current and future quantum devices.\nUsing the ansatz, we perform benchmarking of the IBM Q devices. In Fig. 8(a), we show the energy landscape for the N = 5 mean-field Hamiltonian by using a twoparameter mean-field ansatz on an ideal emulator. We create a 16 \u00d7 16 grid and plot the energy on the z axis. We observe that the landscape is periodic for each parameter in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0 ]. The global minimum is located at \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03c0/2. We compare the ideal landscape with those obtained from two different IBM Q devices, Santiago [77] and Belem [78], having quantum volumes 32 and 16, respectively. The results are shown in Figs. 8(b)\u20138(d). Due to the limited connectivity between the qubits in the IBM Q devices, a careful selection of the layout is essential. We demonstrate the effects of using different layouts by choosing a layout where two adjacent qubits in our circuit are physically separated by one qubit in the middle, thus requiring swap gates. Using 213 samples, we observe qualitative agreement to the ideal landscape for all cases. For all\nthe tested devices, the minimum also appears to be located at \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03c0/2. The ground-state energy, calculated by exact diagonalization, is \u22126. The minimum energies found on the devices are \u22125.30 (Santiago), \u22123.97 (Belem without using swap), and \u22123.38 (Belem using swap). The quantitative difference can be attributed to the errors in the devices. We observe that the device with a larger quantum volume shows better results for our benchmark. The IBM Q Belem device performs worse when swap gates are required for the implementation, even for swapping only two qubits. Knowledge of the actual device connectivity is essential to obtain better results. The two parameters and an energy landscape having a unique global minimum reachable from all initial points makes this a simple benchmarking problem for the N = 5 case."

Instead, one draws samples from the underlying distribution. The potential advantage of quantum computing rests on two closely related assumptions about the sampling. First, the number of contributing states in a certain basis (i.e., the computational basis) from the entire Hilbert space does not increase exponentially with N . Second, a finite number of samples is sufficient to represent the entire distribution accurately. The hope of gaining quantum advantage is to find algorithms that fulfil the above two assumptions. This section discusses whether these two assumptions are viable for the Heisenberg model using the XY ansatz.\nFrom the final state | \u3009 calculated on the emulator, we sample 213 times from the underlying probability distribution. This sample size is motivated by currently available IBM Q devices, which offer a maximum of 213 samples per experiment. It should be noted that 213 samples are not necessarily sufficient to accurately extract all the possible unique states for the larger lattice sizes. However, accurate energy fidelity has overriding significance. In Fig. 9(a), we count the number of unique states or distinguishable bitstrings sampled from | \u3009 for the one-dimensional isotropic rings and compare it to the number of unique states in the Hilbert space. We perform the same task for the ladder lattices, and the results are shown in Fig. 9(b). From both plots, we observe that the first assumption appears to be satisfied; that is, the number of unique states (purple dots and green squares) do not seem to grow exponentially with N .\nIn Fig. 9(c), we plot the energy fidelity obtained by calculating the energy from the 213 samples for both rings and ladders. The fidelities can be directly compared to those obtained by calculating the energy from | \u3009, shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). We observe that the fidelities in Fig. 9(c) and Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) differ by about 1% for the rings and less than 3% for the ladder lattices. The difference is further reduced by using more samples.

In this section, we compare the expected computational time required by a fully functional future quantum computer against an emulation of an ideal quantum computer using a massively parallel simulator run on a supercomputer for the task of finding the ground state of the Heisenberg model. We question if quantum advantage is possible using VQE for the Heisenberg model. Although emulation of VQE might not be the best classical method for finding the ground-state\nenergy of the Heisenberg model on a classical computer, we restrict ourselves to the same method for the purpose of comparison.\nThe largest number of successive operations on a quantum computer are given by\nNo = Ng \u00d7 aTh \u00d7 Ns, (12)\n024047-10\nwhere Ng is the maximum number of gates that need to be sequentially executed [79], Th is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian to be measured, a is a constant that encodes the number of groups of the Hamiltonians, which can be simultaneously evaluated, and Ns is the number of samples required to reach a certain statistical accuracy. The time taken to complete No operations can be estimated by knowing the single- and two-qubit gate times. On the IBM Q superconducting type of quantum computer, single-qubit gates take about 85 ns and two-qubit gates take about 400 ns [80]. Ion traps offer even slower two-qubit gates of the order 1.6 \u03bcs [81]. For our calculations, we take the IBM Q values.\nFor the N = 24 spins\u2019 ring, we count the total number of energy evaluations required up to three evolution cycles to be 84 744. At each cycle, a new layer of U(\u03b8) is added to the circuit. The largest number of single- and twoqubit sequential operations executed are approximately 6400 and 11 500, respectively. By taking optimistic values aTh = 3 and Ns = 213, the time required to calculate the energy once is about 126 s. The total time required to complete the variational calculation using a quantum computer stands at 124 d. In comparison, running the emulator on a supercomputer required 4 d for the same computation.\nSimilarly, for the 6 \u00d7 6 and 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 lattices, the time required to calculate the energy once is 90 and 52 s, respectively. The total number of energy evaluations are 12 700 and 68 426. The total time required to complete the variational calculation using a quantum computer stands at about 13 and 41 days, compared to 7 and 4 days on the supercomputer, respectively. Counterintuitively, the VQE runtime for the 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 spins lattice is less than that of the 24 spins\u2019 ring due to the total energy evaluations and the number of evolutions performed.\nThe above calculations reveal that the large number of energy evaluations required to obtain the ground-state energy forbids quantum computers to run VQE in a reasonable amount of time. However, as shown in Appendix E, we observe quick drops in the energy initially during the optimization, which relatively slows down as it approaches a local minimum. Hence, the first few iterations provide the largest decrease in energy. For the 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 lattice, energy per spin of \u22122.605 is found within 5 \u00d7 103 energy evaluations. This will expectedly take 24 h on a quantum computer.\nIn summary, VQE on an emulator using a classical computer performs the task faster than a hypothetical fully functional quantum computer up to the number of qubits and tasks we test. This does not mean that emulators will always perform tasks faster than actual quantum computers. For several parameters and lattice topologies, e.g., random couplings or frustrated structures, the Heisenberg model is a hard problem. The memory requirements to store the complete state vector for a 50 or more qubit system is beyond the current memory-storage capacities of\nmodern supercomputers. If the favorable scaling of the ansatz continues, a future quantum computer may be able to approximate the ground-state energy of the Heisenberg model beyond 50 qubits. For such large problems, the polynomial time scaling given in Eq. (12) can be expected to hold. In this sense, the realization of potential quantum advantage using VQE for the Heisenberg model may be anticipated on a quantum computer."

We introduce and extensively test a state-evolution heuristic to overcome the obstacles faced by current VQE algorithms. Without increasing the active number of parameters, our tests show that the heuristic could escape local minima. In contrast, the current standard method, which uses restarts of sets of random parameters, would quickly become intractable even for quantum computers. We observe that the evolution heuristic improves the estimates of the ground-state energies of the Heisenberg model compared to the standard VQE and this across all lattice dimensions. The simulations are accelerated by initializing the quantum system in the N\u00e9el state, which continued to be an initial state with significantly lower energy to start the variational optimization, as compared to random initializations. Taking into account that the current and near-term devices will only have a limited computational capacity, we propose as a benchmark a mean-field ansatz requiring a circuit depth of five independent of the number of qubits. The benchmark is able to accurately recover the ground state of the mean-field spin model using only N/2 parameters. Finally, realistic gate-execution-time calculations of the current quantum hardware capabilities show that an emulator can perform the task of finding the ground-state energy of the Heisenberg model faster than current (ideal) quantum computers. However, there is hope for quantum advantage because a computation that cannot be performed on classical hardware due to memory limitations may be performed on future quantum computers.\nEven though our heuristic works very well, innovatory improvements can benefit the evolution method\u2019s performance and cogency. One possible direction is to investigate analytical or cost-effective numerical ways to find the best U(\u03b8) for each cycle and given problem. While the variational methods are not affected by the sign problem [82], it remains to be seen if the optimization algorithms will remain efficient for N > 40. The parallelizability of VQE is another aspect that can be explored [83]. The evolution heuristic can be seen as complementary to the idea of optimizing all parameters actively, i.e., the entire parameter space can be made active when evolution stops making progress and vice versa. Another\n024047-11\ncritical issue is the connectivity of the XY ansatz; while the heuristic is ansatz independent, the development of a hardware-connectivity efficient ansatz that also accurately approximates the ground state of the Heisenberg model is an open problem. The effect of quantum noise should also be studied in future works. While we show that the simulations find the ground state for up to the limit of what can be classically simulated using a limited number of samples, it remains to be seen if this favorable scaling continues beyond what can be classically simulated.

            "text": "We illustrate how the XY ansatz is implemented as a quantum circuit. The ansatz consists of products of unitary operators of the forms exp(\u2212i\u03b8A \u2297 B) and exp(\u2212i\u03b8A \u2297 B \u2297 C), which would require factorization into products of unitary operators [84] and significantly increase the circuit depth. Instead, when A = B = C = \u03c3 z, we take the implementation [85] given by the circuit shown in Fig. 10. To implement A, B \u2208 {\u03c3 x, \u03c3 y} as in the case of the XY ansatz, we appropriately change the basis as done in Ref. [15]. When the number of qubits is larger than two, after changing the basis, we always place the parametrized gate on the qubit with the largest index. After several trials we find that by using operators of type exp(\u2212i\u03b8A \u2297 B \u2297 C) to place all the parametrized gates on one qubit, the performance is consistently better. We believe that this aspect of quantum circuit preparation needs further exploration, but this is outside the scope of the current work."

            "text": "We discuss numerical examples that shed light on what parameters need to be employed when starting a new evolution cycle. We study two possibilities: all parameters initialized either randomly or as zeros.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, the energy fidelity drops rapidly if random new nonzero parameters are used instead of zeros. While starting a new evolution cycle with parameters as zeros increases the energy fidelity (not visible in the scale on plot), random parameters show the opposite effect. This is understood from Eq. (5), where |\u03c8\u3009 can be used effectively in the next evolution cycle only if for the initial parameters \u03b8\nU(\u03b8)U( )| 0\u3009 = U( )| 0\u3009. (B1)\nAn evolution cycle that systematically lowers the energy at each iteration can be achieved by setting U(\u03b8 = [0, . . . , 0]) in Eq. (B1), but not by setting the parameters randomly. Additionally, setting parameters as zeros is equivalent to an identity circuit and is shown to help avoid barren plateaus [59] (see Appendix D). By using random parameters,\nU(\u03b8)U( ) = U( ), (B2)\nand | \u3009 is not preserved for the next cycle.\n024047-12"

We construct an optimized circuit for the mean-field ansatz as shown in Fig. 12.\nThe ansatz requires only a nearest-neighbor connectivity for quantum devices, which is readily available for current devices. For the N = 5 case discussed in the main text, we construct the same ansatz as one would for a fourqubit circuit and leave the fifth qubit without any gates. Due to the simplicity of the problem, such an approach appears to work. The final state appears to be a product of two-qubit states. Once the ansatz is constructed, the meanfield Hamiltonian terms can be measured by rotating to the appropriate basis."

            "text": "We compare the initial energy obtained using the N\u00e9el state and using randomly generated parameters (RI). As a specific example, we consider the 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 lattice where the circuit contains 702 variational parameters. We choose 104 different random sets of values for the parameters and plot the energy obtained in each case. We do not perform a VQE calculation but plot the energy corresponding to the initial parameters. Figure 13 compares the energy obtained using RI runs and the N\u00e9el state. Given that 104 random points in the energy landscape correspond to E \u2248 0, the\nlandscape is relatively flat or barren across a vast region. We expect that the gradients computed around the points where the energy is calculated would be close to zero in this case. This is numerical evidence for the presence of barren plateaus for the lattice under discussion.\nFor all the RI cases, the obtained energy did not deviate too much from E = 0, which is a poor initial energy for an optimizer to start. We also plot the energies obtained after evolution on the N\u00e9el state and the ground-state energy for comparison. The results show that initial energies obtained from random parameters are far away from the ground-state energy, and assuming there are no local minima between the initial point and the global minimum, it would take a significantly large number of iterations as compared to starting from the N\u00e9el state to approximate the ground-state energy. Thus, the N\u00e9el state is an efficient initial state for this example."

            "text": "We show the energy progress at each step of the optimization for selected lattices. We plot the energy at each step of the optimization curve for 24-qubit onedimensional ring, a 6 \u00d7 6 (36-qubit) square lattice, and a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 (27-qubit) three-dimensional lattice, as shown in Fig. 14. Initially, we observe a quick drop in the energy across all lattices, including those not shown here. As the VQE reaches a local minimum, the gradients become smaller and so does the relative decrease in the energy. This is reflected by the flat part of the curve towards the right of each plot. The steplike structure reflects the working of quasi-Newton optimization algorithms.\nAs observed for the 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 case, after a significant initial drop, the drop in energy slows down after 104 energy evaluations. This is explained by the fact that the optimizer gets trapped in a local minimum. However,\n024047-13\nby using the evolution heuristic, escape from the local minimum becomes possible (around 4 \u00d7 104 evaluations), which shows a relatively large drop in the energy again.\nIn Sec. VI C, we focus on comparing the time required to obtain the same optimization curves using an emulator and an ideal quantum computer. Figure 14 shows that, on the one hand, obtaining the ground state requires a large number of energy evaluations, and on the other hand, the most considerable change in the energy drop occurs during the first few iterations. If the accuracy of the final energy is not relevant, the energy obtained within the first few iterations could also be used for comparing the computational times.\n[1] N. Moll, P. Barkoutsos, L. S.
