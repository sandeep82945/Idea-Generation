    "abstractText": "Consistent production of bioactives from microbial sources remains a big challenge for fermentation based bio-processes. Setomimycin, a rare 9,9\u2019-bianthrylanthracene antibiotic reported to be active against Gram positive bacteria i.e. Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis, including mycobacteria is one of the least exploited antibiotic. Present work aims to enhance and maximize setomimycin production using One Factor at a Time (OFAT) approach, followed by Taguchi L9 orthogonal array (OA) design in 30L fermenter. Four most influential parameters, namely carbon source, nitrogen source, air and agitation were selected for optimization studies. The optimized production medium supplemented with 150 g/L glycerol and 7.5 g/L soyabean meal with an agitation rate of 100 RPM and air flow rate of 20 LPM (Liters Per Minute) resulted in 675 mg/L setomimycin production within 96\u2013108 h of fermentation as compared to the initial production i.e. 40 mg/L. Thus, an overall enhancement of 16.8 folds was achieved in setomimycin production after optimization in 30L fermenter.",

            "text": "Increasing antibiotic resistance towards the existing drugs has surfaced as a major concern recently. Therefore, a continuous research and development for the discovery of new antibiotics has become a foremost goal for the scientists. Most of the antibiotics discovered so far are either the natural products of microbes or semi-synthesised from these products (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021). Biaryl preanthraquinones such as julichromes, spectomycins, and setomimycins, are special class of antibiotics isolated from actinobacteria specially, Streptomyces genus (Dong et\u00a0al., 2020: Staley et\u00a0al., 1994: Omura et\u00a0al., 1978). Atroposelective biaryl compounds are mostly formed in nature through intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2020). The monomeric subunits of these biarylic pre-anthraquinones are derived from a common polyketide precursor. The coupling of the two subunits takes place in regio-selective manner depending on the Streptomyces strain.\u00a0 Setomimycin, a rare 9,9\u2019-bianthrylanthracene antibiotic (Scheme\u00a0 1) was isolated for the first time from Streptomyces pseudovenezuelae by Omura et\u00a0 al. (1978). Although the total biosynthesis of setomimycin is not well understood, however Pr\u00e4g et\u00a0al. (2014) identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for setomimycin biosynthesis in S. afghaniensis and suggested that cytochrome P450 is responsible for the dimerization. Setomimycin is reported to be active against various Gram-positive bacteria such as B. subtilis, S. aureus, M. smegmatis and B. cereus. Recently, our group has also reported a potential strain for setomimycin production and its bioactive potential as antiviral as well as anticancer agent (Manhas et\u00a0al., 2022a, b).\nKeeping in mind the limited market availability and cost, it is important to develop efficient fermentation process with enhanced and consistent production\u00a0 of setomimycin. Growth of microbes and production of Scheme\u00a01 Structure of setomimycin\ntheir metabolites in a bioreactor is highly affected by physiochemical factors like nitrogen sources, carbon sources, trace elements. pH, temperature, time of fermentation, agitation and aeration rate also play significant role in the process (Wenzel et\u00a0 al., 2011). Raw material for fermentation medium involves the major cost of a process, therefore needs to be optimized strategically. The components of media should yield optimal growth of microbes along with higher production of the metabolite with no or minimum number of by-products (Elisashvili et\u00a0 al., 2001). Glycerol, being a major by-product of alcoholic beverage and soap industries is one of the obvious choice as a cheap carbon source. Soyabean meal is also a key agri-waste after the extraction of soy oil. Due to its low cost, high protein content and ease of availability, it is widely used as an alternative nitrogen source for fermentation (Hong et\u00a0al., 2004; Song et\u00a0 al., 2008). Also, maintaining the required cultivation conditions keeping minimum stress exposure for the microorganism are the key factors in optimizing the fermentation process and further scale up (Schmidt, 2005). Optimization of these parameters during fermentation is an important step to surpass the difficulties arising due to large scale production of the desired metabolite.\nUsual Design of Experiments (DOE) for developing a process generally requires a large set of experiments, which is highly tedious and time consuming. Therefore, in order to overcome this, a statistical approach by Taguchi design that consists of wellplanned experiments has been suggested (Bhattacharya et\u00a0 al., 2009). Taguchi orthogonal array design allows the study of a set of variables with a limited number of experiments instead of large set of experiments. Thus, it helps in improving the quality and the performance of the process through DOE and Robust Technology Development (RTD). It utilises pair-wise balancing property, where variables are arranged in an orthogonal array and each combination of variables appears an equal number of times (Subba Rao et\u00a0 al., 2008). Various fermentation processes have been successfully optimized using Taguchi method (Azmi et\u00a0 al., 2011; Rao et\u00a0 al., 2004; Nagarijun et\u00a0 al., 2005). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is also used to validate the statistical significance of the experimental results, thus making the analysis more accurate and precise (Sawyer, 2009).\nIn the present study, we have used an actinobacterium Streptomyces sp. strain RA-WS2 that has recently been identified for setomimycin production (Manhas et\u00a0 al., 2022a, b). The culture parameters that could influence the production of setomimycin; such as carbon source, nitrogen source, agitation and aeration\nrate were optimized by methodological application of Taguchi design using an OA layout of L9. The results obtained were further validated by fermentation in\u00a030L bioreactor to compare the predicted and observed values."

The culture has also been submitted to Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC-\u00a025512) under Budapest Treaty. The isolate has recently been reported for the production of a bianthraquinone antibiotic i.e. setomimycin under submerged fermentation for its antiviral and anticancer properties by Manhas and coworkers (2022a, b)."

Various physical and chemical factors were evaluated on the basis of the two responses such as biomass (DCW g/L) and setomimycin (mg/L) production. Initially, the effect of various production media (Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1d) was studied to determine growth and production of setomimycin. Further studies on the effect of temperature (20 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C), pH (5 to 9), inoculum (2.5 to 15%) in selected fermentation medium with agitation (50 to 300\u00a0 rpm) and different air to volume ratio were carried out. Effect of various carbon and nitrogen sources was evaluated under the optimized conditions. Optimization studies were carried out in 500\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100\u00a0mL production medium and incubated at 28 \u00b1 2\u00a0 \u00b0C for 96\u2013120\u00a0h on a rotary shaker at 200 RPM. All the optimization experiments were carried out in triplicate and responses in terms of biomass (DCW, g/L), crude extract (g/L) and setomimycin content (mg/L) were determined.\nTaguchi orthogonal array design layout in\u00a030\u00a0L fermenter Use of Taguchi approach in Design of Experiments (DOE) facilitates the entire parameter space with a small number of experiments. Therefore, L9 Taguchi orthogonal array was chosen to design the experimental layout. Based on the significant factors identified in OFAT experiments, carbon source (glycerol), nitrogen source (soyabean meal), agitation (RPM) and air (VVM) were selected for optimization studies at fermenter level (30\u00a0 L fermenter). Taguchi orthogonal array experimental design led to 9 experiments in 30\u00a0L fermenter having\n15\u00a0 L production medium. For the fermentation experiments in the bioreactor, three levels were attributed for each independent parameter. The experimental design based on the significant parameters and levels as shown in Table\u00a01.\nThe experimental matrix (L9) with four significant independent factors and their respective levels have been\nillustrated in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S3. For each experiment, the responses in terms of biomass (DCW g/L) and setomimycin content (mg/L) were evaluated. The mean responses for each run in the array were analyzed in terms of Signal- to- noise (S = N) ratio to study the variation. Analysis of the graphs and ANOVA was carried out using Minitab (version 20) in terms of S/N ratio as larger the best using following equation\u00a0\nwhere, S/N = Signal to noise ratio. Y = Signal factor (Biomass DCW in g/L or Setomimycin content in mg/L). n = Number of repetitions in the experiment.\nTaguchi design recommends the use of the S/N ratio to determine which settings of the controllable factors result in a closer mean to the desired target and a minimum variability transmitted from the noise variables (Yang and Tarng, 1998; Freddi and Salmon, 2019). The significance of all terms was judged statistically when the p value was less than 0.05 (p < 0.05).\nS / N = \u221210 *log ( \u2211 (1/Y 2)/n )"

            "text": "Biaryl preanthraquinones represented by julichromes, spectomycins, and setomimycin, are classified in literature on the basis of position of intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling of their monomeric units (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021). The natural process for biosynthesis of these compounds takes place from a common polyketide precursor, however the coupling reaction proceeds in a regioselective manner, with the position of attachment of the two subunits depending on the specific Streptomycete strain (Pr\u00e4g et\u00a0 al., 2014). Setomimycin is known to have antimicrobial activity against various Gram-positive bacteria such as B. subtilis, S. aureus, M. smegmatis and B. cereus (Omura et\u00a0al., 1978). Although few groups have reported the isolation and bioactivities of setomimycin from different Streptomyces strains (Pr\u00e4g et\u00a0al., 2014; Omura et\u00a0al., 1978), however could not be commercially exploited much due to its limited access in the market. Recently, our group has reported a potential Streptomyces strain\nfor the production of setomimycin and its bioactivities (Manhas et\u00a0al., 2022a, b). Keeping in view the lower yields of production by the reported strains (Kay et\u00a0 al., 1981), attempts were made to develop an efficient fermentation process for the production of setomimycin.\nTaguchi orthogonal array design facilitates with a set number of trials with only limited experiments (Bhattacharya et\u00a0al., 2009). Therefore, an improved fermentation process may be developed by effective and robust Taguchi Experiment design. During the present optimization studies for the production of setomimycin by Streptomyces sp. RA-WS2 were performed starting from initial shake flask experiments with 2.6\u00a0 g/L DCW with 40\u00a0 mg/L setomimycin production. Further optimization strategy was designed to enhance setomimycin production with organized experimentation. Pre-requisite for the optimization of a fermentation process is to choose suitable and cost-effective growth medium (Singh et\u00a0 al., 2017). Several researchers prefer to use industrial byproducts so as to make the process commercially viable (Sitepu et\u00a0al., 2014). Therefore, in order to maximize the DCW as well as setomimycin production, effect of production media was evaluated. Our results indicate that PM-7 (Starch casein broth) was the most favorable medium for growth as well as setomimycin production with 1.3-fold enhancement.\nFurther optimization of fermentation conditions in the chosen production medium, resulted in 3.7\u00a0 g/L DCW and 63\u00a0 mg/L setomimycin production with an overall 1.5\u00a0 fold enhancement. Following optimization of fermentation conditions, carbon and nitrogen sources were optimized utilizing cheap and readily available industrial wastes. Interestingly, the selected carbon source i.e. glycerol, a readily available industrial byproduct as well as agriwaste nitrogen source, served the purpose of minimizing the cost of raw material (Yazdani et\u00a0 al., 2007). The optimization of carbon and nitrogen sources in the production medium led to 11 folds increase in DCW and 10.2 folds enhancement in setomimycin production with 100\u00a0g/L glycerol and 5\u00a0g/L soyabean meal in the modified production medium.\nBased on the shake flask experiments using OFAT approach, four significant factors viz. glycerol, soyabean meal, agitation and air played a significant role on the growth (DCW) as well as setomimycin content. Taguchi method helps to attain the most optimal process variables in an easy, structured and an effective way (Shahavi et\u00a0al., 2016). Further optimization of fermentation conditions was carried out in 30L Fermenter using modified PM-7 medium. The results indicate that the maximum setomimycin production (630\u00a0mg/L) is achieved in early stationary phase i.e. 108\u00a0h of fermemtation. Thus, Taguchi Orthogonal array optimization resulted in about 15.8\nfolds increase in DCW and 15.7 folds enhanced production of setomimycin. The results were in agreement with the reports demonstrating a multi fold increase in the bioproducts formation by optimization studies using Taguchi orthogonal array (Azmi et\u00a0 al., 2011; Rao et\u00a0 al., 2004; Nagarijun et\u00a0al., 2005).\nOur results also show that soyabean meal was the highest influencing parameter in improving the production of biomass (Fig.\u00a04a,b). It is evident from the S/N and the main effects plots that the concentration of soyabean meal had the greatest effect on biomass production followed by glycerol concentration, agitation, and aeration rate. S/N ratio analysis revealed that the optimum conditions for setomimycin production were similar to that obtained using main effects plot of the fermentation. It is also evident from the S/N and the main effects plots (Larger the better) that the concentration of soyabean meal had the greatest effect on setomimycin production followed by glycerol concentration, agitation, and aeration rate. A successful fermentation process is influenced by various variables, therefore, effect of each factor on the production of a metabolite has to be understood deeply. Linear regression model was used to fit the experimental data and to identify the relevant model terms. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is also used to validate the statistical significance of the experimental results, thus making the analysis more accurate and precise (Sawyer, 2009). Therefore, ANOVA was used to further analyse the results of orthogonal array experiments and to find out the variation of each of the factor towards the growth (DCW) and production of setomimycin. In order to determine the quality of experimental results, statistical F-ratio was utilized, which is measured as the ratio of mean sum of squares (Kwak, 2005). Signal to noise ratio was calculated, where systemic variance was divided by unsystematic one and the larger ratio was considered better. Soyabean meal, glycerol and agitation bearing p < 0.05 were identified as significant factors for the optimization studies. Further, the optimization of fermentation process to maximize biomass (DCW) as well as setomimycin production not only required to study the effect of individual factors but also the interactions between these factors. Therefore, the interaction between every two factors was evaluated as shown in Interaction plots for DCW and setomimycin production (Fig.\u00a0 5a). Contour plots examine the relation between the response variable and two control variables by viewing discrete contours of the predicted response variables. The contour plots explaining the relation between the process parameters and biomass as well as setomimycin production. Such relationships were found to have similar trend with that of reported for other antibiotics (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2008; ElHousseiny et\u00a0 al., 2021). After determining the optimal\nparameters, Taguchi model suggested solution for optimum production of DCW as well as setomimycin production followed by validation experiments. Therefore, fermentation experiments were carried out in 30L under suggested conditions and 40\u00a0g/L of DCW and 675\u00a0mg/L of setomimycin was obtained in 120\u00a0 h of fermentation. This is the best yields for setomimycin production as compared to other Streptomyces sp. reported in literature (Kay et\u00a0al., 1981). The experimental values were not only close to the predicted values, but also provided an optimized process parameters resulting in an overall 16.8 folds enhancement in the DCW and 16.6 folds enhancement in setomimycin production as compared to the unoptimized parameters. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on such study for setomimycin production by any Streptomyces culture.\nIn conclusion, process parameters for fermentation of Streptomyces sp. RA-WS2 have been optimized to maximize the biomass (DCW) and setomimycin production (mg/L). Taguchi orthogonal array design resulted an optimum yields of 40\u00a0g/L DCW and 675\u00a0mg/L setomimycin production in modified production medium. An overall 16.6 folds enhancement in DCW and 16.8 folds enhancement in setomimycin production was achieved after optimization. To our knowledge the present process for setomimycin production is the best production obtained so far in literature. It is anticipated that the demonstrated process may further be scaled up at commercial scale leading to increased availability of the antibiotic in the market.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13568- 022- 01497-5.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Table S1a.
