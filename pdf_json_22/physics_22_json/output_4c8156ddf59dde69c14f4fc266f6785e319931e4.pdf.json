    "abstractText": "We construct a supergravity background corresponding to a backreacted D0/D4-brane system. The background is holographically dual to the Venecianno limit of the Berkoos-Douglas matrix model. It is known that the localized D0/D4 system is unstable when the D0-branes are within the D4-branes. To circumvent this difficulty we separate the D4s from the D0s, which are placed at the origin, and restore the symmetry of the combined system by distributing the D4-branes on a spherical shell around the D0-branes. The backreacted solution is first obtained perturbatively in Nf/Nc and displayed analytically to 1st order. A non-perturbative numerical solution is then presented.",

            "text": "The general two D-brane intersection was discussed in [1] and it was pointed out that the method of Cherkis and Hashimoto [2] does not yield a solution in terms of elementary functions for the D0/D4 intersection. The problem was not further pursued there and the more serious difficulty of the instability when the branes are not separated was therefore not encountered. By separating the branes and distributing the D4\u2019s on a spherical shell we are able to provide both an analytic perturbative solution and a numerical nonperturbative solution. Much progress has been made in improving the understanding of Gauge/Gravity duality especially in low dimensional settings. The existence of explicit dual geometries to known quantum theories has enabled non-perturbative studies of the corresponding field theories\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nmake quantitative comparisons with the predicted results from their gravitational duals. This work is still in its primitive stage and much remains to be done. In particular there is as yet no known backreacted dual geometry which is accessible to numerical lattice field theory techniques. Our present study is a first step in this direction.\nOf the low dimensional gauge/gravity pairs the most studied is the BFSS model and its massive deformation the BMN matrix model. The gravitational dual of the BFSS model is the solution of IIA supergravity with a stack of coincident D0-branes or equivalently its lift to 11-dimensional supergravity. This geometry can be conveniently probed using D4-branes [3] which can be displaced from the origin where the D0-branes are located and in the presence of a black hole the shape of the condensate is determined by the background geometry. Checks of the condensate provide strong probes of the background geometry. In particular the comparison of the condensate as computed from a Born-Infeld probe action [3] on the geometry with a non-perturbative lattice study of the gauge theory provides a strong test of the gravity predictions and probes the dual geometry in layers associated with the location of the D4-branes. A further check is provided by comparison of the mass susceptibility of the condensate [4]. It is noteworthy that all these checks give excellent agreement between the matrix model and its gravitational dual.\nTo go beyond the probe limit one needs to solve for the backreacted geometry taking the non-perturbative effects of the D4-branes into account. It is not difficult to set up the necessary supergravity equations, however the simplest situation,1 where the D0-branes all sit at one point within the overlapping D4-branes, suffers an instability [5] reflected by divergent gravity solutions. In the dual field theory this corrspond to the limit of vanishing mass of the fundamental fields.\nTo overcome this difficulty and preserve spherical symmetry we distribute the D4-branes on a spherical shell around the D0-branes.2 More specifically we displace the D4s from the D0-branes, hence introducing a mass for the fundamental fields and further distribute the displacement of the D4s on a spherical shell around the D0s. Then, just as in electrostatics, the solution interior to the shell is that in the absence of D4-branes while in the exterior one has the spherically symmetric solution of the combined system with continuity of the geometry required on the shell. We are then in a position to solve the resulting D0/D4 system. We begin by studying it perturbatively in Nf/Nc. The resulting 1st order perturbative backreaction is sufficient to guide the full non-perturbative solution.\nUnfortunately, we have not yet found the solution in the presence of a black hole which would be dual to the Berkooz-Douglas model in a thermal bath but we are optimistic that a numerical solution can be constructed in this case also.\nThe principal results of the paper are:\n\u2022 We study the case of D4-branes separated from the D0-branes and distributed (smeared) over an S4 orthogonal to the D4s and surrounding the D0s and find the resulting backreacted geometry.\n1Certain aspects of the abelian D0-D4 bound state have been studied in ref. [6]. 2For more backreacted solutions in the context of the gauge/gravity correspondence we refer the reader\nto [9]\u2013[18] for localized and [19]\u2013[37] for smeared solutions.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\n\u2022 We provide an explicit perturbative solution to the leading backreaction of the D4-branes on the D0-geometry in a perturbative expansion in NfNc .\n\u2022 We find a numerical solution for general NfNc \u03bb 2m3q where \u03bb is the \u2018t Hooft coupling and\nmq is the bare mass of the fundamental flavours.\nThe paper is layed out as follows: in section 2 we briefly review the matrix model, then in section 3 we set up and exhibit the dual geometry with the relevant partitial differential equation, (3.18), necessary to find the non-perturbative geometry. In section 3.4 we exhibit the perturbative solution for a generic distribution of D4-branes that preserve the spherical symmetry of the overlapping D0/D4 intersection. In section 4 we solve for the explicit solution to first order with the D4s distributed on a spherical shell as in figure 1 and in section 4.3 we exhibit the non-perturbative solution for this shell distribution. The bulk of the paper closes with a discussion. The paper closes with some technical appendices, in particular in appendix C we present the equivalently smeared D2/D6 system."

            "text": "It is well known that D0-branes solutions of type IIA supergravity can be obtained by dimensional reduction of solutions to eleven dimensional supergravity with momentum along theM-theory circle. On the other hand the D4-branes solutions of type IIA supergravity are obtained after dimensional reduction of anM5-brane solution of eleven dimensional supergravity. This is why the eleven dimensional uplift of the backreacted D0/D4-brane intersection can be obtained by considering anM5-brane geometry with momentum along the M-theory circle. This construction is a magnetic dual analogue of the construction used by Cherkis and Hashimoto [2] to obtain the uplift of the backreacted D2/D6-brane intersection. Starting from the most general invariant ansatz for the eleven dimensional metric consistent with the above assumptions and imposing the requirement to preserve 1/4 of the original supersymmetry of the background one can reduce the anzatz to a form depending on a single harmonic function.

We obtain:\nGp(v, v\u2032) = \u0398(v\u2032 \u2212 v)e\u2212p(v\u2032\u2212v)(1\u2212 p v)(1 + p v\u2032) + \u0398(v \u2212 v\u2032)e\u2212p(v\u2212v\u2032)(1 + p v)(1\u2212 p v\u2032)\n2p3v\u20322 .\n(3.41)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nThe general solution of equation (3.38) can now be written as:\nhn(p, v) = \u221e\u222b dv\u2032Gp(v, v\u2032)\nhn\u22121(p, v\u2032) p v\u20323 + 4\u03c0 2 15 An(p) e \u2212p v(1 + p v) . (3.42)\nNote that we have intentionally omitted the lower boundary of the integral in equation (3.42) since its dependence can always be absorbed in a redefinition of the constant An(p). In more details we have:\n\u221e\u222b dv\u2032Gp(v, v\u2032)f(v\u2032) \u2261 e\u2212p v(1 + p v) v\u222b dv\u2032\ne p v \u2032(1\u2212 p v\u2032) 2p3v\u20322 f(v\u2032)+\n+ ep v(1\u2212 p v) \u221e\u222b v dv\u2032 e\u2212p v \u2032(1 + p v\u2032) 2p3v\u20322 f(v\u2032) , (3.43)\nwhere in the first integral we have taken the primitive function evaluated at v. The freedom to add a constant to the primitive function reflects the freedom to redefine the constant An(p) in equation (3.42). Next we define:\nG\u0303k+1p (v, v\u2032) = \u221e\u222b dv1\nGp(v, v1) p v31\n\u221e\u222b dv2\nGp(v1, v2) p v32\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u221e\u222b dvk\nGp(vk\u22121, vk) p v3k Gp(vk, v\u2032) p v\u20323\n(3.44) with the convention G\u03031p(v, v\u2032) = Gp(v, v\u2032)/(p v\u20323) and G\u03030p(v, v\u2032) = \u03b4(v \u2212 v\u2032). Now using recursively (3.42) for the general solution of (3.38) regular at large v, we can write:\nhn(p, v) = 4\u03c02\n15 n\u2211 k=0 Ak(p) \u221e\u222b dv\u2032 G\u0303n\u2212kp (v, v\u2032) e\u2212p v \u2032(1 + p v\u2032) , (3.45)\nwhere A0(p) = 1 is fixed by D0-brane charge conservation and the rest of the constants remain undetermined. Note that the undetermined constants Ak(p) are constants only in v and the undetermined behaviour in p can describe a very large family of possible solutions once the Fourier transform is performed. Formally, we can write down the solution valid for v > v4:\nH(u, v) = 1 + r 7 0\n15 \u221e\u222b 0 dp p2 J1(p u) u \u221e\u2211 n=0 (p v4)3n v3 n\u2211 k=0 Ak(p) \u221e\u222b dv\u2032 G\u0303n\u2212kp (v, v\u2032) e\u2212p v \u2032(1 + p v\u2032) ,\n(3.46) which (using that we know the solution at n = 0) can be written as:\nH(u, v) = 1 + r 7 0\n(u2 + v2)7/2 + (3.47)\n+ r 7 0\n15 \u221e\u222b 0 dp p2 J1(p u) u \u221e\u2211 n=1 (p v4)3n v3 n\u2211 k=0 Ak(p) \u221e\u222b dv\u2032 G\u0303n\u2212kp (v, v\u2032) e\u2212p v \u2032(1 + p v\u2032) .\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nWe can also substitute in equation (3.37) to write down the solution for the Fourier transformed h(p, v):\nh (p, v) = 4\u03c0 2\n15 v3\n[ e\u2212p v (1 + p v) (3.48)\n+ \u221e\u2211 n=1 (p v4)3n n\u2211 k=0 Ak (p) \u221e\u222b dv\u2032 G\u0303n\u2212kp ( v, v\u2032 ) e\u2212p v \u2032 (1 + p v\u2032)]\nIn practice, we quickly loose analytic tractability of the perturbative solution (3.47) when attempting to evaluate the higher order contributions. In the next section we will \u201cregulate\u201d the geometry by introducing a hollow shell of partially smeared D4-branes. This will allows us to determined the constants of integration Ak(p) and construct a perturbative solution."

While the boundary condition at infinity is physically clear (asymptotic flatness) it is not as clear in the massless case near the core of the geometry. In fact, the authors of [5] have argued that the massless solution is unstable and the D0-branes would desolve inside the D4-branes if the two stacks of D-branes are not separated. To circumvent this difficulty we separate the D4-branes from the D0-branes and distribute them spherically symmetrically (i.e. smear them) along the S4 directions of the R5 transverse to the D4-branes (see figure 1). The result is a shell of radius v0, where in the decoupling limit v0 is related to the bare mass of the fundamental flavours mq in the holographic theory via:\nmq = v0\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 .

Note also that the Rammond-Rammong field has jump in its first derivative at the shell. In fact these leads to cusp in the matric leading to a delta function in the Einstein tensor.

Therefore, if one keeps the perturbative parameter small (v4 v0) the perturbative expansion is well defined and valid everywhere (except at the origin where H diverges).\nIn fact, one can see that the range of values of the function H1 is seeded at the origin where the function H1 is multi-valued. Indeed, consider the correction (4.23) inside the shell (v\u0303 \u2264 1) evaluated on the ray u\u0303 = \u03ba v\u0303.

However, instead of solving perturbatively the equation of motion (3.28) we solve it numerically. The non-petrubative solution inside the shell and its Fourier transform are given in equations (4.14) and (4.16), respectively. The Fourier transform of H(u, v) outside the shell is given by equation (3.27) and satisfies equation (3.28). Our strategy is to solve numerically equation (3.28) for h(p, v) by imposing continuity at v = v0 and regularity at infinity. One can show that for large v the Fourier transform function h(p, v) has the asymptotic form:\nh(p, v) = A(p) e\u2212p v ( 1 v3 + p v2 +O ( 1 v4 )) +B(p) ep v ( 1 v3 \u2212 p v2 +O ( 1 v4 )) . (4.25)\nIt is clear that regularity of the solution requires B(p) = 0. On the other hand continuity at v = v0 requires:\nh(p, v0) = 4\u03c02 15 e \u2212\u03b3 p v0 1 + \u03b3 p v0 v30 . (4.26)\nThe boundary condition (4.26) at v = v0 and the regularity condition at v =\u221e (B(p) = 0 in (4.25) are sufficient to obtain a unique numerical solution to equation (3.28). For more details on the numerical techniques that we used we refer the reader to section E in the appendix. Here we simply present the numerical profile of the function H(u, v). It is again convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables u\u0303 = u/v0, and v\u0303 = v/v0, and define v\u03034 = v4/v0. Then we can write the correction function Hc as in equation (4.22):\nH(u, v) = 1 + r 7 0\n(u2 + v2) 7 2\n[ 1 + v\n3 4 v30 Hc\n( u\nv0 , v v0 , v4 v0\n)] . (4.27)\nNote that unlike the first order correction function H1, in (4.22), the correction function Hc is non-perturbative and thus dependent on v4/v0. In figure 3 we have provided contour plots of the correction function Hc for different values of the parameter v4/v0 whose physical meaning is given by equation (4.12). As one can see for v4 < v0 the contour plot is very similar to the one for the first order correction presented in figure 2. The analogies with the perturbative studies go even further. One can again see that the range of the correction function is seeded at the shell and is determined by the solution inside the shell. Indeed, let us evaluate the correction function Hc(u, v) inside the shell along a ray u\u0303 = \u03ba v starting at the origin. Using equation (4.14) For the we obtain:\nHc (\u03bav\u0303, v\u0303, v\u03034) = v30 v34\n( H (\u03bav\u0303, v\u0303) ( (\u03bav\u0303)2 + v\u03032 )7/2 \u2212 1 ) = ( \u03ba2 + 1 )7/2 v90 ( v30 + v34 ) 3/2 v34 ( (\u03ba2 + 1) v30 + v34\n) 7/2 \u2212 v30v34 , (4.28)\nwhich is a constant. The parameter \u03ba is again in the range [0,\u221e), which cover all of the internal region of the shell. Furthermore one can check that the right-hand side of equation (4.28) is monotonically increasing function of \u03ba. Therefore, to we obtain the minimum value of the correction function inside the shell, we take the limit \u03ba\u2192 0 to obtain:\n\u2212 v 3 0 ( 2v30 + v34 )( v30 + v34 ) 2 = \u22122 + 3v34v30 +O ( v6 v60 ) , (4.29)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nwhich to leading order agrees with the lower limit for the first order correction H1. In the same way if take the limit \u03ba\u2192\u221e we obtain the maximum value of the correction function Hc inside the shell: (\nv30 + v34 ) 3/2 \u2212 v9/20\nv 3/2 0 v 3 4\n= 32 + 3v34 8v30 +O ( v6 v60 ) , (4.30)\nwhich again to leading order agrees with the maximum value of the first order correction H1. Furthermore examining again the contour plots in figure 3, we verify that the range ot the correction function Hc outside of the shell is seeded at the shell and one can understand the contour lines as curves with a \u223c 1/(u2 + v2)7/2 fall off with a constant of proportionality seeded at the origin, where the correction function Hc is multi-valued while the full function H diverges.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4"

The leading perturbative solution in Nf/Nc is given by (4.22) and (4.23) and presented in graphical form in figure 2. Just as in electrostatics, the solution interior to the shell is the same as that in the absence of the D4s, however the interior expression is modified from\nH(u, v) = 1 + r 7 0 r7\nto H(u, v) = 1 + \u03b3 3r70 r7\n(5.1)\nwhere \u03b32 = 1 + NfNc \u03bb 2m3q and r2 = u2 + \u03b32v2 is the interior radial coordinate.

The non-perturbative (in Nf/Nc) solution, as can be seen from figure 3, is quite similar to the leading perturbative solution.

If we use the analytic solution inside the shell (4.14) evaluated at v = v0, it is easy to show that in the limit v4 \u2192 \u221e, while keeping v0 fixed, we have:\ne\u03a6 = (\n1 + v 3 4 v30\n)\u22121/41 + ( 1 + v 3 4 v30 )3/2 r70(\nu2 + ( 1 + v\n3 4 v30\n) v20\n)7/2  3/4 = ( v0 v4 )3/4 +O [( v0 v4 )15/4] ,\n(5.2) which is the behaviour of the dilaton in the near horizon limit of the D4-brane background. Our study is the begining of a larger one. The next step is to include the presence of a black hole in the dual geometry. This would be dual to the finite temperature BerkoozDouglas model and would provide predictions for observables such as the internal energy and condensate of the matrix model as a function of temperature. Further generalisations would involve the mass deformed BD-model [38], i.e. the BMN model with fundamental flavours. This however would be especially challenging since the dual geometry to the BMN model is itself quite complicated."

The first projection (A.7) reflects the fact that the M5-brane breaks the 11D Poincare invariance down to P4 \u00d7 SO(5), while the second projection reflects the fact that momentum along the x11 direction (labelled by \u20181\u2019 in the index notations) breaks the 11D Poincare invariance down to SO(9) invariance (rotational summetry in the transverse directions), which is also the symmetry of the D0-brane background in 10D.

[12] the authors applied GV method to various membranes to study the possibility of asymptotically plane wave spacetimes which admit an event horizon. Our goal is more modest we will use the GV method as a shortcut to deform theM5-brane solution into the\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nuplift of the backreacted D0/D4-brane intersection. We start by the observation that the uplift of the D0-brane solution to eleven dimensions can be constructed as GV deformation of flat space-time. Indeed, it is easy to see that the metric:\nds211 = \u2212dt\u03032 + dx\u0303211 + dr2 + r2d\u212628 . (B.5)\nadmits a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing field (with S = 0). To this end consider lightcone coordinates:\nt = ( t\u0303\u2212 x\u030311 ) / \u221a 2 (B.6)\nx11 = ( t\u0303+ x\u030311 ) / \u221a 2 . (B.7)\nThe flat metric is now: ds211 = 2dt dx11 + dr2 + r2d\u212628 . (B.8)\nand clearly the vector field k = \u2202/\u2202x11 satisfies the requirements (B.2) with S = 0. Next we consider the deformation:\nG\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd +H \u03b4x11\u00b5 \u03b4x11\u03bd , (B.9)\nto obtain:\nds211 = 2dt dx11 +Hdx211 + dr2 + r2d\u212628\n= \u2212H\u22121dt2 +H ( dx11 +H\u22121dt )2 + dr2 + r2d\u212628 , (B.10)\nwhich is the metric of the uplift of the D0-brane to eleven dimensions. Note that the choice H \u221d 1 + r70/r7 satisfies equations (B.4).

The result (after the translation x11 \u2192 x11 \u2212 t) is the metric (3.12) which we duplicate below:\nds211 = ( 1 + v 3 5 v3 )\u22121/3 ( \u2212H(u, v)\u22121 dt2 +H(u, v) ( dx11 + (H(u, v)\u22121 \u2212 1) dt )2 +\ndu2 + u2 d\u212623 ) + ( 1 + v 3 5 v3 )2/3 ( dv2 + v2 d\u212624 ) .\nNote also that the first equation in (B.2) is satisfied with we consider H = H(u, v), while the second equation is the harmonic equation (3.18):\n\u22022vH(u, v) + 4 v \u2202vH(u, v) +\n( 1 + v\n3 5 v3 )( \u22022uH(u, v) + 3 u \u2202uH(u, v) ) = 0 .\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4"

[2], considered the Fourier transform of H:\nH(y, r) = 1 +QM2 \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 eipyHp(r) , (C.3)\nwhere Hp(r) is a solution of the ordinary differential equation:( 1\n1 + 2mr\n)( \u22022\n\u2202r2 + 2 r \u2202 \u2202r\n) Hp(r)\u2212 p2Hp(r) = 0 . (C.4)\nThe solution of equation (C.4) regular at infinity is [2]:\nHp(r) = cpe\u2212p rU(1 + pm, 2, 2pr) , (C.5)\nwhere U(a, b, z) is the confluent hypergeometric function. The normalization factor cp was fixed in ref. [2] to:\ncp = \u03c02 8 1 m2 (pm)2\u0393(pm) . (C.6)\nby requiring that in the limit m\u2192\u221e while keeping z2 = 8mr fixed, one has:\nHp(z) = \u03c02\n2z2 pz K1(pz) , (C.7)\ncorresponding to:\nH(y, z) = 1 +QM2 \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 eipyHp(z) = 1 + QM2 (y2 + z2)3 . (C.8)\nTo arrive at this result the authors of ref. [2] exploited the fact that in limit m \u2192 \u221e (with fixed z2 = 8mr) the 11D uplift of the geometry is that of a M2-membrane, which suggests the asymptotic form (C.8)). Clearly this is a property very specific to the D2/D6 intersection and the fact that the 11D uplift of the D6-branes is a magnetic monopole realised as a Taub-NUT geometry. We will show how to arrive at the same result following the method applied to the D0/D4 system.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nTo this end, we distribute the D6-branes on a shell of radius r0 surrounding the D2branes. inside the shell (for r < r0) the density of the D6-brane Ramond-Ramond charge vanishes and the corresponding warp factor is constant. Imposing continuity at the shell we arrive at the following form of the 10D metric for r \u2264 r0:\nds2 =H(y,r)\u22121/2 (\n1+ 2m r0\n)\u22121/2( \u2212dt2+dx21+dx22 ) (C.9)\n+H(y,r)1/2 (\n1+ 2m r0\n)\u22121/2( dy2+y2d\u212623 ) +H(y,r)1/2 ( 1+ 2m\nr0\n)1/2( dr2+r2d\u212622 ) .\nNow we define:\nt\u0303 = (\n1 + 2m r0\n)\u22121/4 t , (C.10)\nx\u0303i = (\n1 + 2m r0\n)\u22121/4 xi , for i = 1, 2 ; (C.11)\ny\u0303 = (\n1 + 2m r0\n)\u22121/4 y , (C.12)\nr\u0303 = (\n1 + 2m r0\n)1/4 r . (C.13)\nresulting in the metric:\nds2 = H(y\u0303, r\u0303)\u22121/2 ( \u2212dt\u03032 + dx\u030321 + dx\u030322 ) +H(y\u0303, r\u0303)1/2 ( dy\u03032 + y\u03032d\u212623 + dr\u03032 + r\u03032d\u212622 ) (C.14)\nThe most symmetric solution is then that of a D2-brane:\nH(y\u0303, r\u0303) = 1 + QD2\n( 1 + 2mr0 )\u22123/4 (y\u03032 + r\u03032)5/2 , (C.15)\nwhere QD2 = (3/64m)QM2. Going back to the original variables we have:\nH(y, r) = 1 + QD2\n( 1 + 2mr0 )1/2 ( y2 + ( 1 + 2mr0 ) r2 )5/2 = 1 +QM2 \u222b d4p(2\u03c0)4 eipyH(0)p (r, r0) , (C.16)\nwhere:\nH(0)p (r, r0) = \u03c02 16m e \u2212p r\n( 1+ 2m\nr0 )1/2 r . (C.17)\nNext we consider a solution of the form (C.5) outside of the shell (r > r0):\nHp(r) = bpe\u2212p rU(1 + pm, 2, 2pr) , (C.18)\nand impose continuity across the shell. Namely, we require that:\nHp(r0) = H(0)p (r0, r0) , (C.19)\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 3 4\nwhich is:\nbpe \u2212p r0U(1 + pm, 2, 2pr0) =\n\u03c02 16m e \u2212p r0\n( 1+ 2m\nr0 )1/2 r0\n(C.20)\nand can be used to determine the constant of integration bp as a function of p. We obtain:\nbp = \u03c02 16m e \u2212p r0\n[( 1+ 2m\nr0\n)1/2 \u22121 ]\nr0 U(1 + pm, 2, 2pr0) . (C.21)\nNow taking the r0 \u2192 0 limit:\nlim r0\u21920 bp = lim r0\u21920  \u03c0 2 16m e \u2212p r0 [( 1+ 2m r0 )1/2 \u22121 ] r0 U(1 + pm, 2, 2pr0)  = \u03c0 2 8 1 m2 (pm)2\u0393(pm) , (C.22)\nwe recover the result (C.6)."

The last two terms in equation (D.1) are the DBI and WZ actions of the D4-brane. Choosing co-moving frame for the D4-brane x\u00b5 = (\u03bea, ym) the DBI action can be written in a ten dimensional form as:\nSDBI = \u222b d10x e\u03a6/4 \u221a det [ g\u0302ab + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032e\u2212\u03a6/2Fab ] \u03b4(5) (xm \u2212Xm (\u03be)) , (D.2)\nwhere the functions Xm(\u03be) for m = 1, . . . , 5 describe the embedding of the D4-brane. One can see that varying the action (D.1) with respect to the ten dimensional metric will result in a delta function source term in the Einstein equations."

The results presented in the paper were obtained in Mathematica. To employ a shooting technique we have to specify both the value and derivative of the function h(p, v) and the shell v = v0. While the value h(p, v0) is fixed by imposing continuity and using the analytic solution inside the shell, the first derivative is obtained using a searching procedure. The criteria to select the correct value of the first derivative is to obtain a regular solution at infinity. To this end one employs the perturbative solution at large v (v v0) and imposes the constraint that Bn(p) in equation (3.39) vanishes. The final step to obtain the numerical solution is to perform numerically the inverse Fourier transform integrating over the numerically generated function h(p, v). A challenge here is integrating numurerically for large momenta p. To improve the accuracy of the behavior of the function h(p, v) for large p ip to a cutoff \u03bbp is approximated parametrically and the integration in the open interval [\u039bp,\u221e) is performed analytically over the approximated function.\nOpen Access.
