    "abstractText": "Parallel multi-thread processing in advanced intelligent processors is the core to realize high-speed and high-capacity signal processing systems. Optical neural network (ONN) has the native advantages of high parallelization, large bandwidth, and low power consumption to meet the demand of big data. Here, we demonstrate the dual-layer ONN with Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) network and nonlinear layer, while the nonlinear activation function is achieved by optical-electronic signal conversion. Two frequency components from the microcomb source carrying digit datasets are simultaneously imposed and intelligently recognized through the ONN. We successfully achieve the digit classification of different frequency components by demultiplexing the output signal and testing power distribution. Efficient parallelization feasibility with wavelength division multiplexing is demonstrated in our high-dimensional ONN. This work provides a high-performance architecture for future parallel high-capacity optical analog computing.",

            "text": "Deep neural network (DNN) has been an essential tool for developing general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI). The DNNs based on commercial electrical hardware processors or specifically optimized algorithms are extensively explored in pattern recognition, intelligent translation system, and material science [1\u20135]. With the rapid development of AI and increasing demand for high-capacity datasets processing, high-performance processors with accelerated matrix multiplication operations and high parallelism have attracted great attention in recent years. Progress of intelligent hardware plays a crucial role in developing next-generation advanced neural network processors. Nowadays, electronic neural network accelerators and processors based on the graphics processing unit (GPU), application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) dominate the commercial AI technique and specific function processing. However, intelligent electronic neural network hardware is still suffering from limited electrical bandwidth and huge energy consumption for the larger matrix decomposition. The computing carrier by electrons strictly restricts the computing capacity. It is worth mentioning that optical neural networks (ONN) based on photonic devices can compensate for the troublesome deficiencies of electrical hardware processors [6\u20139]. ONN can provide a higher speed with at least two orders of magnitude, lower power consumption, and larger bandwidth than conventional electrical artificial intelligent processors. To date, ONN has developed from free space optics [10\u201314] to integrated photonic devices [15\u201321]. Meanwhile, continuous innovations of nano-micro fabrication and photonic integrated devices pave the way for miniaturized intelligent photonics processers. Synchronous high-dimensional datasets processing or multi-thread operation is the urgent tendency with the arrival of the big data era. Photons have the natural superiorities of encoding highdimensional information due to the abundant dimensions, such as polarization encoding [22\u201324], orbit angular momentum demodulation [25], optical frequency components encoding in communication, and quantum technology [26\u201329]. Photon takes the unique superiority of parallel information transmission and processing by introducing the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique, which has been widely used in current high-capacity optical communication systems [30, 31] and parallel quantum key distribution [32]. Based on the independent propagation characteristic of photons, the rate of\ninformation throughput of ONNs depending on the bandwidth or quantities of available wavelengths can be increased exponentially. Assisted by the commercial WDM techniques, the soliton microcomb (SMC) source [33] has demonstrated that it could efficiently contribute to the implementation of high-speed and parallel photonic convolution image accelerators [34, 35]. Especially, SMC can also be employed for parallel different information processing in ONN systems, which is promising in rapid parallel scenario analysis or multi-thread information processing via utilizing the dimension of wavelengths, such as emotion recognition, gesture recognizer, Fourier transformation of signals, speech recognition, and computing accelerator.\nIn this letter, we propose an architecture of high-dimensional ONN, which consists of an on-chip SMC source, WDM module, and dual-layer ONN. In the dual-layer ONN structure, we introduce the chip-based Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) network as the matrix multiplication linear layer and electro-optic nonlinear modules as the nonlinear activation function, which is composed of electro-optic modulators (EOM), detector modules, and FPGA control systems. The flexible programmable capability of the MZI network ensures multi-objection classification and recognition via learning from the different objection datasets. Integrated microresonator technology provides the automatic single SMC generation characterized by the coherent multi-wavelength light source with a frequency spacing of 49\u00a0GHz, which is compatible with the commercial WDM technique. Benefitting from the large width of photonics devices and WDM techniques, the parallel high-dimensional ONN processor based on chip-based single SMC is experimentally demonstrated via classifying the MNIST datasets. The recognition accuracies of the digit \u20180\u2019, \u20182\u2019, and \u20187\u2019 from the MNIST datasets are around 85% for different wavelengths. This work paves the innovative routines for exploring the chip-based parallel high-capacity AI accelerator."

Each frequency component via WDM could be regarded as one coherent laser and take one task, and then all components are coupled into the ONN chip to realize high-capacity signal processing and parallel high-dimensional computing. The flexible programmable characteristics of ONN guarantee the feasibility of different datasets processing and the demultiplexing technique is applied to divide the optical frequency components, respectively. The potential recognition information or computing results will be characterized by testing the power of output signals according to the classification results from the presupposed algorithm or optimization procedure."

The basic principle of single SMC generation is based on the auxiliary laser heating the micro-cavity to reach the thermal balance. The auxiliary laser is shifted about 100\u00a0MHz from the pump laser via the acoustic optical modulator (AOM). The details of single SMC generation are demonstrated in the supplementary information. The proper frequency spacing between the pump and auxiliary laser could ensure the thermal balance in the soliton existence region or the red-detuned region. Once the pump laser is located at the soliton region, the external frequency modulation on\nthe AOM and forward tuning of the pump laser frequency would make the microcomb state stabilize at the single SMC existence region. In our SMC source generation experiment, the micro-cavity is designed with strong anomalous dispersion and the pump and the auxiliary laser are located in the same resonance mode. The micro-cavity is fabricated at the platform of high-index doped silica glass with the radius of 592.1\u00a0\u03bcm. Pump laser is provided by the narrow linewidth laser at 1560.2\u00a0nm to be compatible with WDM. The generated optical spectrum of single SMC source is shown in Fig.\u00a02(a), which covers the S, C, and L bands. As is shown in Fig.\u00a02(b), the repetition rate is about 49\u00a0GHz, which meets the requirement of frequency spacing for avoiding crosstalk in dense WDM communication systems. By introducing the dense WDM technique, the single SMC source could be divided into many equidistant coherent lasers via demultiplexing to take several hundred tasks to realize parallel high-dimensional computing."

The algorithm keeps adjusting the gradient of the matrix of W\n1 andW 2 to minimize the\nobjection function between experimental vectors and the target reference vectors value.\nFigure\u00a04(a) shows the basic architecture of dual-layer ONN, which is composed of the MZI network as the linear matrix multiplication operation, and the photoelectric conversion module as the nonlinear layer. In the dual-layer ONN, light signals are encoded by the amplitude modulator. The linear layer is composed of the specific arranged MZIs fabricated in the platform of high-index doped silica glass. Each linear layer is composed of 29 programmable MZIs and each MZI corresponds to the neuron of ANN. The MZI network chip is packaged by the polarization-maintaining fiber array and thermally controlled via an external TEC controller as shown in Fig.\u00a04(d). The coupling loss between the MZI network and polarization-maintaining fiber array is\nabout 1\u00a0dB. The ultra-low coupling loss greatly contributes to the multi-layer ONN achievement. The transmission loss of the waveguide around 1560\u00a0nm is about 0.05\u00a0dB\u00a0 cm\u22121. Each MZI consists of phase shifter ( ) between two 50% directional couplers and an extra thermo-optic phase shifter (\u2205) as shown in Fig.\u00a04(c). MZI implements the SU(2) transformation unitary matrix,\nMatrices of the linear layer can be decomposed into sets of SU(2) transformation unitary matrix multiplication via the cascaded MZI. Via controlling external voltage to change the phase of the phase shifter ( ) , the transmission matrix of the single MZI could be adjusted. Figure\u00a04(e) shows the transmission trace via tuning the voltage on phase shifter ( ) . According to the test results, 27\u00a0dB extinction ratio can be achieved, which means the directional coupler of beam\nU MZI\n= 1\n2\n( ei\ufffd ( ei \u2212 1 ) iei\ufffd ( ei + 1 )\ni ( ei + 1 )\n1 \u2212 ei\n)\n1 3\nsplitter is fixed at 50:50. The high extinction ratio ensures arbitrary high-resolution matrix formation. Besides, the nonlinear activation function plays a critical role in ANNs by enabling them to learn complex mappings via minimizing the target vectors and reference vectors. Limited by the transformation efficiency, nonlinear motivation threshold power and flexible programming, the cascaded all-optical activation function is challengeable with the increasing layers of ONN. To overcome the challenge, we adopt an electrooptical architecture activation function to achieve the nonlinear layer computing. Figure\u00a04(b) shows the basic structure of the nonlinear activation function. The light signal goes through the 50:50 directional coupler and is divided into two portions, one is transformed into the electrical signal via commercial PD, and another portion and be modulated by an amplitude modulator. The depth of ONN is determined by the efficiency of PD and loss of waveguide. The FPGA\nsystem or commercial computer could calculate the nonlinear function value via detected signal power and adjust the output of the amplitude modulator via an external controlled voltage source. And then the output optical signal would be modulated and then enter into the next linear matrix layer. By means of external FPGA and voltage source, the arbitrary nonlinear activation functions could be formed and XOR logic gate could be recognized by introducing the non-monotone nonlinear function in the single-layer ONN. The accuracy of nonlinear activation is determined by the extinction ratio of the amplitude modulator, which is about 23\u00a0dB in our experiment. In the dual-layer ONN, the second nonlinear layer and output layer are performed via the commercial PD and FPGA. Figure\u00a04(f) shows the transmission power curve via sweeping the laser wavelength when the input light experiences the four MZIs. The transmission power curve is approximately identical, which proves that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00957-8\u00a9 The authors\nthe matrix of MZI network has a relatively large bandwidth toward wavelength. The bandwidth of MZI is over 30\u00a0nm, which means that it can maintain similar matrix values and eigenvectors at different driving voltages at a large wavelength range. The large bandwidth of MZI network supports the implementation of synchronous processing of abundant datasets via multiwavelength encoding."

The selected frequency components are amplified to 15 mW as the input signal and then sent to the same dual-layer ONN. The dense WDM is connected with the output ports of the second linear layer and the different wavelengths from the output signal are separated. By detecting the statistical power distribution of output ports from different wavelengths, the objected tasks could be recognized. In practice, we first choose the digit datasets from MNIST to train the dual-layer ONN. The digit of \u20180\u2019,\u20182\u2019, and \u20187\u2019 are selected to train in the dual-layer ONN system. Meanwhile, we choose the sigmoid function as the nonlinear activation function. Limited by the number of optical neurons, the original image couldn\u2019t be directly\nloaded to ANN or ONN to accomplish the training process or power distribution statistics. The original image is divided into a series of pixel vectors, we sum up the total logarithm power of each port and statistic exponential power distribution after completing the training process. In the training process, the matrix parameters of dual-layer ONN can be obtained by using the standard back-propagation algorithm and the stochastic gradient descent method. The reference vectors of \u20180\u2019,\u20182\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 are, respectively, corresponding to (1 0 0), (0 1 0), and (0 0 1) for the output ports. The target recognition can be obtained by comparing the power distributions and object power vector values. Figure\u00a05 illustrates the experimental recognition results based on the duallayer ONN architecture. When the loaded digit datasets are imposed from \u20180\u2019 to \u20187\u2019, the output port of maximum power is changed from the first output port to the third output port via continuously loading the test digit datasets, which is consistent with the pre-established objection vector. Besides, the recognition accuracies for different wavelengths are approximately identical and the accuracies are about 85%. It should be mentioned that the programmable flexibility from MZI network and nonlinear control unit supports the multi objections recognition via learning from the different datasets. The large bandwidth of the MZI network and highrepetition-rate single SMC support the high-dimensional ONN to accomplish high-capacity computing.\n1 3"

In this work, on-chip microcomb technology provides a pivotal multi-wavelength light source, which can carry different information via utilizing several frequency components to realize high-speed and highcapacity signal processing systems. The microcomb also has the native advantage to realize the high repetition rate or large frequency spacing by the careful geometric design, so that it could efficiently avoid signal crosstalk in parallel multi-thread processing. Moreover, the large bandwidth of the MZI network provides an opportunity to allow several wavelengths to maintain similar matrix values via a thermalcontrolled MZI network and supports the different wavelengths with the same datasets to transmit in the same MZI network. The combination of a stable single SMC source, MZI networks, and WMD technique is an efficient approach to developing high-dimensional optical neural networks for high-cavity parallel recognition systems and signal processing. It is worth mentioning that our functional chips of SMC and MZI networks are based on the same material platform and compatible with CMOS technology. What is more, we achieve an efficient device package and ultra-low coupling loss. The details and methods of the device packaging are presented in the supplementary information. The challenge to the recognition accuracy is the cross-talk between different MZIs during the thermal tuning process. The possible solution is applying a faster adjuster, electro-optic modulation, or thermal deposition to reduce the thermal crosstalk.
