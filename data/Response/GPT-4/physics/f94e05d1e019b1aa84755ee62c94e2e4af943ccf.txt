Development of Portable, Real-Time IR Spectroscopy Devices for Point-of-Care Testing: Research could focus on designing and validating portable IR spectroscopy devices that can be used in various settings, including clinics, remote areas, and patients' homes. These devices would facilitate the rapid, non-invasive analysis of saliva for early disease detection, monitoring, and personalized treatment plans.

Exploration of Salivary Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Building on the foundation of detecting diseases like diabetes and cancer, future research could explore the potential of IR spectroscopy in identifying salivary biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This would involve correlating specific spectral patterns with disease progression and treatment response.

Integration of AI and Machine Learning for Enhanced Spectral Analysis: Future studies could focus on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms with IR spectroscopy data to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection and monitoring. This could involve developing predictive models that can identify subtle changes in salivary biomarkers indicative of specific diseases or treatment responses.

Comparative Studies Across Different Body Fluids: While the paper focuses on saliva, research could expand to compare the diagnostic potential of IR spectroscopy across different body fluids (e.g., tears, sweat, urine) for a broader range of diseases. This would help determine the most effective and convenient sampling methods for various conditions.

Advanced IR Spectroscopy Techniques for Subcellular Analysis: Investigating the use of advanced IR spectroscopy techniques, such as surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, for subcellular analysis in saliva. This research would aim to uncover deeper insights into the molecular changes associated with diseases at an even earlier stage, facilitating ultra-early detection and the potential for preventative interventions.
