    "abstractText": "Developing plasmonic metal-based photocatalysts can improve the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overcome the limitations of semiconductor-based photocatalysts. A MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam composite electrode was fabricated on a copper foam and employed for photoelectrocatalytic HER. The optical behavior and photoelectrocatalytic HER test results indicate that the surface plasmon resonance effect of copper and silver is the primary source of light absorption. Additionally, molybdenum sulfide was employed as a hot-electron trap to capture the energetic electrons generated from copper and silver, thereby promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Its binder-free electrode exhibits the better HER performance and excellent stability. Low-cost plasmonic metals, copper and silver, were used as the source of photocatalysis, providing a novel perspective for enhancing photoelectrocatalytic HER performance.",

            "text": "Photoelectrocatalytic HER has been identied as one of the best ways to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution.1 The rst-generation semiconductor-based photoelectrocatalyst materials were proposed by scientists Fujishima and Honda in the 1970s.2 In the following decades, they were continuously utilized for enhancing photoelectrocatalytic reactions through modication3\u20136 and decoration.7\u201311 However, low electric conductivity and narrow window for light absorption12,13 became fatal aws that limited the HER performance. In recent years, plasmonic metal-based materials, such as precious metal Au,14\u201317 have been considered a novel and reliable means of boosting the photoelectrocatalytic HER.18,19 Research has shown that plasmonic metals can effectively improve photoelectrocatalytic performance due to their three advantages: the antenna effect, adjustable resonance energy, and ultra-sensitive sensing.20\u201322 Thus, plasmonic metals are expected to become the next generation of photocatalysts. Besides, metals with high conductivity promote electron transfer and rapid electrocatalytic reactions.23 However, the cost of photoelectrodes has increased due to the use of precious metals in the preparation process. Therefore, it is imperative to utilize low-cost plasmonic metals such as copper and silver for efficient light harvesting and hot electron generation. The photogenerated carriers resulting from plasmon resonance effects are more prone to recombination compared to\nllege of Technology, Shuozhou, Shanxi 18@163.com tion (ESI) available.

Furthermore, amorphous molybdenum sulde has been demonstrated to exhibit superior catalytic performance due to the presence of catalytically active sites located at lattice defects.29\u201331 The twodimensional layered molybdenum sulde, with a band gap of 1.8 eV, can generate photo-induced carriers under visible light illumination.32,33 The appropriate band structure of molybdenum sulde can trap the hot electrons34 originated from surface plasmon resonance effect, which synergistically participate in photoelectrocatalytic HER.\nIn this paper, a hierarchical porous copper foam (Cu foam) was used as a conductive substrate. Ag nano-layers and amorphous molybdenum sulde were successively grown in situ on the Cu foam by means of wet chemical and electrochemical deposition methods (MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam). The prepared electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The results of the photoelectrocatalytic HER test indicate that the MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam electrode exhibits the strongest photoelectrocatalytic performance, with a photo response current density (DJ) 2.88 times higher than that of Cu foam and 1.83 times higher than that of Ag\u2013Cu foam.

Furthermore, the corresponding elemental mapping images shown that Mo, S, and Ag elements were uniformly spatially distributed on the Cu foam (Fig. 1f1\u20134), which suggested that the MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam composite electrode can be synthesized through the two-step procedure.

The specic overpotential values at 10 mA cm\u22122 and 50 mA cm\u22122 under illumination were presented in Table S1.\u2020\nThe Tafel slope, obtained from the LSV curves of prepared electrodes, serves as an indicator of the intrinsic catalytic activity. As is shown in Fig. 6b, the Tafel slope of MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam (54.2 mV dec\u22121) was comparable to that of MoS2@Cu foam (68.5 mV dec\u22121), yet signicantly lower than that of Ag\u2013Cu foam (115 mV dec\u22121) and pure Cu foam (153 mV dec\u22121). This suggested that the outer layer of molybdenum sulde can serve as an electron mediator between plasmonic meatal and H+ in aqueous solution, stimulating rapid kinetics for HER.\nThe enhanced photoelectrocatalytic performance of MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam was also attributed to its higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The estimation of the ECSA at the solid\u2013liquid interface can be achieved through the measurement of electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) via CV test.42 The EDLC values were determined by calculating the slope of the linear regression analysis of the capacitive current plotted against scan rate (Fig. S4\u2020).

This indicated that the MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam composite electrode possessed the highest ECSA. The values of Tafel slop and ECSA were exhibited in Table S1.\u2020\nThe Nyquist plot was generated through EIS analysis to evaluate the surface kinetics of the electrodes prepared, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. The diameter of the tted semicircle represented the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which denotes the resistance encountered during electron transport. The Nyquist plots of the electrodes with layer of molybdenum sulde (MoS2@Ag\u2013Cu foam and MoS2@Cu foam) exhibited a narrower semicircle diameter than that of the other electrodes. The as prepared electrodes displayed the smaller Rct values under illumination, especially for electrode with silver nano-layer.\nAs illustrated in Scheme 2a, upon exposure to resonant optical radiation, the plasmonic metal exhibited oscillation of its free electrons within the conductive band. Then the hot electron\u2013hole pairs were generated via non-radiation attenuated Landau damping within a time frame of 1 to 100 fs.44 The plasmon-induced electric eld promotes the transition of electrons from occupied states to the higher energy SPR states.45,46 Unfortunately, the photoelectrocatalytic performance of pure plasmonic metals is severely limited by their high recombination probability for photogenerated carriers (shown in Fig. 3a) and sluggish kinetics for HER (shown in Fig. 6).
