To this aim, we report a detailed analysis of breakdown performance of planar GaN-on-Si MOS capacitors. The analysis is carried out on capacitors processed on different GaN bulk doping (6E18 Si/cc, 6E17 Si/cc and 2.5E18 Mg/cc, p-type), different structures (planar, trench-like) and different geometries (area, perimeter and shape). We demonstrate that (i) capacitors on p-GaN have better breakdown performance; (ii) the presence of a trench structure significantly reduces breakdown capabilities; (iii) breakdown voltage is dependent on area, with a decreasing robustness for increasing dimensions; (iv) breakdown voltage is independent of shape (rectangular, circular). TCAD simulations, in agreement with the measurements, illustrate the electric field distribution near breakdown and clarify the results obtained experimentally.",

            "text": "The use of innovative semiconductor materials is a key factor to address the increasing demand for safe and reliable conversion and distribution of energy [1]. Among other materials, gallium nitride (GaN) is increasingly gaining popularity [2], thanks to the commercialization of efficient lateral transistors, with capabilities in the voltage segment up to 600-900 V [3]. However, to meet the needs of the emerging fields, such as Electric Vehicle/Hybrid Vehicles or power grids, voltage capabilities in the range of 1800 V and more are required [4]. In this context, vertical and semi-vertical GaN topologies are in the forefront of next generation power devices, overcoming the bottleneck of breakdown voltage vs area trade off affecting lateral structures [5], [6].\nAmong all the different architectures, trench-gate MOSFETs on foreign substrates are promising candidates for the realization of high power and high frequency switches, thanks to their economic advantages with respect to native substrates [7]. Nonetheless, heteroepitaxial vertical and semivertical GaN technology is in a nascent stage and several problematic issues have to be fully investigated for the realization of high-quality devices\n[8].\nIn particular, the choice of the gate stack dielectric is fundamental for the reliability of the trench MOSFET structures: a bi-layered gate dielectric has been proven to provide better performance with respect to a single-layered gate stack, without significant drawbacks [9], [10]. Other important questions still need to be addressed: how does gate stack reliability depend on the doping level and on the doping type (n-type or p-type) in the epitaxy? Does the reliability depend on gate layout geometry? What is the impact of trench formation on the reliability of the gate stack?\nThe aim of this paper is to address these open questions, by investigating the breakdown limits of several MOS capacitors, with different characteristics [11]. More specifically, the study is focused on the analysis of MOS capacitors with different GaN doping (n+, n and p-type), different structures (planar and trench), different shapes (rectangular and circular) and different dimensions (area and perimeter). The results, complemented by 2D simulations, provide a description of the robustness of the different layers included in the gate stack of a GaN-on-Si semi-vertical trench MOSFET."

            "text": "The devices under test are GaN MOS capacitors, with a bi-layered dielectric composition, grown on 8- inch silicon substrates. The study was focused on the analysis of four different wafers, with varying GaN doping and varying structures. The wafers can be classified based on their dominant processing features as follows: (i) wafer R, called \u201creference\u201d, planar capacitor on n+ (= 6 \u2219 1018 cm-3) GaN; (ii) wafer L, called \u201clower doping\u201d, planar capacitor on n (= 6 \u2219 1017 cm-3) GaN; (iii) wafer P, called \u201cp-doping\u201d, planar capacitor on p-type (= 2.5 \u2219 1018 cm-3) GaN; (iv) wafer T, called \u201ctrench\u201d, trench-like capacitor on n+ (= 6 \u2219 1018 cm-3) GaN. The structures (planar and trench) and the dielectric composition (Al2O3 interface dielectric to GaN + SiO2 main dielectric), are shown in Figure 1.\nThe GaN layers, in the four analysed wafers, were grown by MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapor deposition). For the wafer with a patterned trench etch, a dry etch step was used for GaN removal. First a bulk GaN removal step was implemented using a Cl2/Ar chemistry. Secondly Atomic Layer Etch (ALE) processing steps are implemented as a softlanding step. A recess depth of ~400 nm is targeted. Before the dielectric deposition wet cleaning steps are implemented on all samples to clean up organic residues. On top of the gate dielectric a TiN/Ti/Al containing stack is used as metal electrode. Afterwards an N-implantation is used to isolate the n+-GaN in the bond pad areas of the capacitor structures. Ohmic contacts to the n+-GaN are realized by recess etching, cleaning, Ti/TiN/Al based metallization and low-temperature ohmic anneal [12]. The same metallization scheme is used for the GaN\nstack with p-type doping, resulting in a Schottky type of contact. PECVD SiO2 is used as intermetal dielectric, and the metal stacks are finished with a 4 \u00b5m-thick Al stack.\nIn the wafers, different capacitors were tested, based on their shape and area, to compare the breakdown performance between the different wafers and the different geometries, as discussed in the following. In Figure 2, the typical CV characteristics of the devices are reported (voltage difference is between the metal on top of the oxide stack and the contact to the GaN). The characteristics are shown for the same circular capacitor shape, for the different analysed wafers. The figure highlights two main properties of the devices: (i) wafer T and wafer R have similar CV characteristics. This is due to the amount of doping used for gallium nitride, that is the same for the two wafers. The slight differences in the curves could be ascribed to the variability between different samples and to the different geometry. (ii) wafer L, with lower doping, has a significant lower capacitance for decreasing applied voltage. This is due to the depletion region in the semiconductor, that is wider for a lower doping device.\nFor all the following tests, I-V sweeps with a semiconductor parameter analyser (Keysight E5263A) have been performed."

            "text": "In this section, the breakdown performance (with positive bias on the electrode on top of the oxide stack) of the MOS capacitors on the different wafers will be investigated. The analysis is carried out on identical circular capacitors with an area of 10-3 cm2. The I-V characteristics until breakdown for nine\nidentical capacitors are presented in Figure 3(a). The intra-wafer leakage level and voltage dependence are quite consistent, although the dispersion in breakdown voltage is higher in all planar capacitor wafers (see Figure 3 (b)) compared to the trench capacitors. The lowering in doping from 6 \u2219 1018 cm3 (wafer R) to 6 \u2219 1017 cm-3 (wafer L) results in a worsening in breakdown voltage by 16 % (this will be discussed further). The p-doped wafer (wafer P) presents the highest average breakdown voltage (+8 % with respect to wafer R, reference). This higher breakdown voltage is ascribed to the additional voltage drop in the semiconductor, needed to bring the p-type material into inversion. The introduction of the trench etch (wafer T) reduces the breakdown voltage by 34 % (compared to wafer R). This is because of the electric field crowding at the trench corners, as shown by numerical simulations, see Figure 4.\nThe breakdown results are summarized in Table 1.\nTo visualize and compare the conditions near breakdown for planar vs trench capacitor structures, Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD simulations were performed under identical bias condition (and considering ideal devices). Figure 4 presents the electric field at a representative voltage of 40 V for all planar capacitors (Figure 4 (a)) and of 35 V for trench like structures (Figure 4 (b))\nIn planar capacitors the electric field distribution in the oxide is uniform across the entire gate stack, while for trench structures an evident crowding at the corner of the trench is involved, with a high and sharp electric field peak. Although these results reflect the lowering in measured breakdown voltage for trench structures, they could also explain their lower dispersion, since the failure is expected to occur in the trench corner area and thus the breakdown behaviour between samples would probably be similar. Simulations also explain the higher robustness of pdoped structures (wafer P): as previously assumed, a lower electric field is present in the oxide, due to the drop of potential in the semiconductor to get inversion. The lower electric field in the gate stack\nallows the p-doped structure to reach higher voltages before the occurrence of breakdown. Finally, a consideration on reference and lower-doping structures must be done: the simulated electric field is essentially the same for wafers R and L, indicating no theoretical causes (in ideal devices) for the differences observed experimentally. Although the reasons of this are not completely clear (further investigations are currently carried on), a hypothesis was formulated: the premature breakdown could be related to the higher charge trapping observed in wafer L (not shown here and currently under study), that - due to accumulation of charge in distributed defects (both in the oxide/GaN interface and in the bulk oxide) - would lead to increased electric field (with respect to reference devices) for the same applied voltage."

            "text": "The same set of I-V breakdown measurements were performed on MOS capacitors with different shape and different areas (on the same sample wafers as discussed previously), with the aim to identify any dependencies. In Figure 5 we report the breakdown voltages for circular and rectangular capacitors with two different area values: (a) devices with \ud835\udc34 = 3 \u2219 10\u22124 cm2; (b) devices with \ud835\udc34 = 3 \u2219 10\u22123 cm2.\nCapacitor shape was found not to impact the breakdown voltage. On the other hand, a clear\ndecrease of breakdown voltage is present for increasing device area. To better analyse this phenomenon, in Figure 6 the breakdown dependence on (a) area, (b) perimeter and (c) P/A ratio, for circular capacitors, are plotted.\nA clear trend is highlighted by this figure: for increasing area (and thus increasing perimeter since the structures considered are circular, shown in Figure 6, or rectangular, not shown) all the wafers exhibit a decreasing breakdown voltage. Considering the P/A ratio dependency, the most probable factor limiting the robustness, in this case of analysis, is the area. This could be mainly ascribed to the presence of uniformly distributed failure spots, rather than to the existence of perimeter-related defects."
