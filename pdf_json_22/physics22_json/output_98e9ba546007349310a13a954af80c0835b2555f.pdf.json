    "abstractText": "\u03b2-LiGaO2 with an orthorhombic wurtzite-derived structure is a candidate ultrawide direct-bandgap semiconductor. In this work, using the non-adiabatic Allen-HeineCardona approach, we investigate the bandgap renormalization arising from electronphonon coupling. We find a sizable zero-point motion correction of -0.362 eV to the gap at \u0393, which is dominated by the contributions of long-wavelength longitudinal optical phonons. The bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2 decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. We investigate the optical spectra by comparing the model BetheSalpether equation method with the independent-particle approximation. The calculated optical spectra including electron-hole interactions exhibit strong excitonic effects, in qualitative agreement with experiment. The contributing interband transitions and the binding energy for the excitonic states are analyzed. \u2217fangdqphy@xjtu.edu.cn",

In this work, using the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-\nCardona approach, we investigate the bandgap renormalization arising from electron-\nphonon coupling. We find a sizable zero-point motion correction of -0.362 eV to the\ngap at \u0393, which is dominated by the contributions of long-wavelength longitudinal\noptical phonons. The bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2 decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. We investigate the optical spectra by comparing the model Bethe-\nSalpether equation method with the independent-particle approximation. The\ncalculated optical spectra including electron-hole interactions exhibit strong excitonic\neffects, in qualitative agreement with experiment. The contributing interband\ntransitions and the binding energy for the excitonic states are analyzed.\n\u2217fangdqphy@xjtu.edu.cn\nI. Introduction\nLiGaO2 has been of interest for use as a promising lattice-matched substrate for the epitaxial growth of nonpolar GaN [1] and ZnO films [2]. The ground-state structure of\nLiGaO2 is the orthorhombic Pna21 structure, referred to as \u03b2-LiGaO2, for which the prototype is \u03b2-NaFeO2. This material is a ternary analogue of wurtzite ZnO, which is arrived at by replacing the Zn2+ ions alternatively by the Li+ and Ga3+ ions. The LiGaO2 crystal can be grown by the Czochralski method [3], and atomically flat LiGaO2 surfaces were reported [4]. Recently, researches on LiGaO2 have also focused on possible application in optoelectronic devices. LiGaO2 can be alloyed with ZnO by a standard solid state reaction, forming x(LiGaO2)1/2-(1-x)ZnO (x \u2264 0.38) semiconductor alloys with tunable bandgap between 3.33 eV and 3.7 eV [5]. Solid solutions of \u03b2-\nCuGaO2 and \u03b2-LiGaO2, i.e., \u03b2-(Cu1-xLix)GaO2, were synthesized, for which the bandgap changes from 1.47 eV to 3 eV in the composition range of 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.89,\ncovering the full visible range [6]. Defect studies show that the equilibrium carrier\nconcentrations induced by the native point defects of LiGaO2 are negligible [7], while n-type doping should be readily achieved with Si or Ge dopants, making LiGaO2 a candidate ultrawide bandgap semiconductor [8].\nThe bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2 has been investigated experimentally and theoretically in the literature [9\u201314]. A bandgap of 5.6 eV was derived from the soft x-ray spectroscopy\nanalysis [9], while Ref. [10] gave a direct gap of 5.26 eV by the optical absorption\nmeasurement. The theoretical bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2 calculated with density functional theory (DFT) method depends strongly on the exchange-correlation functional used.\nBoth local and semi-local functionals severely underestimate the bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2, e.g. 3.136 eV obtained with the local density approximation (LDA) [13] and 3.363 eV\nwith the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation [14].\nJohnson et al. using the modified Becke-Johnson functional (mBJ) predicted a direct\ngap of 5.658 eV, in reasonable agreement with the soft x-ray spectroscopy\nmeasurements [9]. A recent study using the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW)\nmethod in the 0.8\u2211 approximation reported a gap of 5.81 eV based on the experimental\nlattice constants of \u03b2-LiGaO2 [14], and this study also estimated a zero-point motion correction of -0.2 eV to the bandgap by the electron-phonon coupling using a model\nwith a single longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. Taking the zero-point renormalization\n(ZPR) into account, Ref. [14] gave a gap of 5.6 eV, in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental value in Ref. [9], manifesting the importance of the electron-phonon\ninteraction in this material.\nThe influence of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure of\nsemiconductors and insulators is nonnegligible in many cases and has attracted\nconsiderable attention recently [15\u201320]. However, the first-principles calculation of the\nbandgap renormalization in polar materials is difficult. The LO phonons at long\nwavelength generate macroscopic electric fields, and the electron-phonon vertex\ndiverges for q \u2192 0, where q is the phonon wave vector. To address this challenge,\nVerdi et al. proposed a strategy that separates the short-range and the long-range\ncontributions to the electron-phonon matrix elements, which generalizes the Fr\u00f6hlich\ntheory and can be used in conjunction with ab initio interpolation method for efficient\nand accurate calculation [21]. Miglio et al. [18] highlighted the importance of non-\nadiabatic effects in the ZPR of the electronic band gap and showed that for the materials\nwith light elements, the magnitude of ZPR is often larger than 0.3 eV, and up to 0.7 eV,\nwhich cannot be ignored for accurate bandgap calculation in these materials.\nIn this work, we investigate the bandgap renormalization of \u03b2-LiGaO2 induced by the electron-phonon coupling using first-principles calculations, finding a sizable zero-\npoint motion correction of -0.362 eV to the bandgap. Furthermore, to explore the optical\nspectra, we perform separate calculations including the electron-hole interaction based\non the equilibrium static crystal structure."

            "text": "A. Electronic band structure\nOur first-principles calculations for the structural relaxation and electronic band\nstructure are based on DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package\n(VASP) [22]. The electron-ion interaction is described by means of the projector\naugmented-wave method [23,24] and the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional is\nused [25]. The cut-off energy for the plane wave basis set is set to 550 eV and a 4\u00d74\u00d74\nMonkhorst-Pack k-point grid is employed for the Brillouin zone (BZ) integration [26].\nAll atoms are relaxed until the Hellmann-Feynman forces on them are less than 0.01\neV/\u00c5. For the quasiparticle G0W0 and GW0 investigations, the PBEsol equilibrium structure, 96 frequency grid points, and 1200 bands are used, with a cut-off energy of\n200 eV for the response function [27].\nB. Electron-phonon coupling\nThe effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic band structure is studied\nwith the ABINIT (version 9.6.2) code [28,29] using the PseudoDojo PBEsol norm-\nconserving pseudopotentials [30], and setting the plane wave cut-off energy to 1088.46\neV. A 4\u00d74\u00d74 \u0393-centered k-point grid for the BZ sampling is employed to obtain the\nelectronic ground state density. For the phonon calculations, a coarse 4\u00d74\u00d74 \u0393-centered\nq-point grid is used with the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) approach,\nwhich gives converged phonon dispersion.\nIn the many-body perturbation theory approach, the electron-phonon self-energy\ne ph n \u2212 k consists of two terms, namely the Fan-Migdal (FM) and Debye-Waller (DW) terms, at the lowest order of perturbation [31,32]:\n( , ) ( , ) ( )e ph FM DWn n nT T T  \u2212 =  +k k k . (1)\nThe frequency-dependent FM term is given as\n2\n,\n( , ) | ( , ) |\n( ) ( )\n( ) 1 ( )\nFM mnn BZ m BZ\nm\nm\nm\nm\nd T g\nn T f T\ni\nn T f T\ni\n \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n   \n+\n+\n+\n+\n= \n +  \n\u2212 + +\n+ \u2212 + \n\u2212 \u2212 + \n k\nq k q\nk q q\nq k q\nk q q\nq k q\n, (2)\nwhere the phonon modes are denoted by indices  , wave vector q , and energy q , and ( )mf T+k q and ( )n Tq are the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distribution functions, respectively. The electron-phonon matrix elements ( , )mng  k q are defined by\n( , ) | |KSmn m ng V  += k q q kk q , (3)\nwith KSVq the first-order variation of the self-consistent Kohn-Sham (KS) potential induced by the phonon mode vq . The static DW term is approximated with [32]\n2, ( , ) ( ) 2 ( ) 1 DW DW mn n\nm n m\ng T n T \n     = +  \u2212 k q q k k\nk q\n, (4)\nwhere 2, ( , )DWmng  k q is an effective matrix element that, within the rigid-ion approximation, can be expressed in terms of the ( , )mng  k q matrix elements.\nWe use a Fourier-based interpolation technique to obtain the phonon coupling\npotentials on arbitrary q-points [28,33,34]. Meanwhile, a special numerical treatment\nis used to address the long-range behavior of the phonon coupling potential in polar\nsemiconductors. As the discussion in Refs. [21,28,34], the long-range part associated to a displacement of atom  along the cartesian direction  is defined as\n( ) ( )*\n,( )4 ( )\n( ) ( )\nie V i\n\n  \n\n +  \u2212\n \u2212\n+  =\n +   + \nq G r \u03c4\nq\nG q\nq G Z r\nq G \u03b5 q G , (5)\nwhere *Z and  \u03b5 are the Born effective charge tensor and the dielectric tensor,\nrespectively, and summation over the cartesian directions \u03b2 is implied. The long-range\npart is subtracted from the phonon coupling potential to yield the short-range part of\nthe potential. The short-range part of the phonon coupling potential is then Fourier\ntransformed from the coarse q-point mesh to a real space lattice-vector mesh. The\ninterpolated short-range part of the phonon coupling potential for an arbitrary q point\ncan be obtained via the inverse Fourier transformation. The long-range part is added to\nrecover the full phonon coupling potential. This scheme reproduces accurately the\nelectron-phonon coupling matrix elements [34].\nWe employ the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona (AHC) approach [18] to evaluate\nzero-point and temperature-dependent renormalizations of the electronic band structure.\nThe correction to the energy of the electronic state nk is obtained from the real part of the self-energy, Eq. (1), evaluated at the bare KS eigenvalue, i.e. nk = : [31,32]\n( ) Re ( , )e phn n nT T  \u2212  =  kk k . (6)\nC. Optical property\nWe use two methods to calculate the optical spectrum. The first one is based on the\nindependent-particle picture. The frequency-dependent dielectric matrix in the long-\nwavelength limit is calculated using VASP code [35] and a 10\u00d710\u00d710 \u0393-centered k-\npoint grid. A scissors correction [36,37] is used in order to reproduce the GW0+ZPR gap.\nBeyond the independent-particle approximation, the electron-hole interactions may\nsignificantly alter the optical spectrum. These can be accounted for by solving the\nBethe-Salpether equation (BSE) [38,39]. However, calculations on dense k-point grids\nat the standard GW+BSE level for the 16-atom primitive cell of \u03b2-LiGaO2 are prohibitive due to the huge computational cost. Alternatively, we employ an analytic\nmodel for the static screening. In this model BSE (mBSE) the dielectric function is\ndescribed as [40]\n( ) 2 1 1 , 2 | | ( ) 1 1 exp\n4   \n\u2212 \u2212\n  + = \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \n  G G\nk G k , (7)\nwhere  and  are the ion-clamped static dielectric function and the rangeseparation parameter, respectively, which are determined by fitting 1\n, ( ) \u2212 G G k to the\nscreened Coulomb kernel diagonal values obtained from the GW0 calculation. The off-\ndiagonal elements of the inverse dielectric functional are neglected making the screened Coulomb kernel diagonal ( =G G ). The inverse of the dielectric function from GW0 and the fit according to Eq. (7) are shown in Fig. S3 (see Supplementary material). The parameters, obtained from the fit to the GW0 dielectric function,  =1.3981 and 1 \u2212 =0.3147, are used as input for the mBSE calculations. The quasiparticle energies are\napproximated by the application of the scissors operator with a shift corresponding to\nthe difference between the GW0+ZPR gap and the PBEsol gap to the PBEsol singleparticle energies.

            "text": "A. Structural and electronic properties\nWe first optimize the lattice constants of \u03b2-LiGaO2 using the 16-atom primitive cell. The values obtained with the PBEsol functional are a=5.399 \u00c5, b=6.367 \u00c5, and c=5.015\n\u00c5, as shown in Table I, which are closer to the experimental data than the previous\nresults obtained using the LDA or PBE functionals. Figure 1 shows the calculated\nelectronic band structure of \u03b2-LiGaO2, which gives a direct bandgap of 3.261 eV across the \u0393 point. The valence bands between -6 eV and 0 eV are dominated by the O 2p\nstates, and the narrow bands at around -12 eV are the Ga 3d derived bands. The bottom\nof conduction band is mainly contributed by the Ga 4s state. These features are in good\nagreement with prior studies [9,14]. In Fig. 2, we zoom in on the region near the valence\nband maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) and present the\norbital contribution for each band. The top three valence bands near the \u0393 point are\nformed by the pz, px, and py orbitals due to the crystal-field splitting. The VBM, VBM1, VBM-2 states labeled according to the irreducible representations a1, b1, and b2 of\nthe point group C2v have the same symmetry as a vector along z, x, and y, respectively, chosen along the c, a, and b lattice axes. The CBM state corresponds to the a1\nrepresentation. The symmetry of the electronic states plays an important role in\ndetermining whether the optical transition between them can occur; for example, the\noptical transition from the a1 VBM state to the CBM at the \u0393 point are dipole-allowed\nonly for E || c, from the b1 VBM-1 state to the CBM for E || a, and from the b2 VBM-\n2 state to the CBM for E || b.\nThe effective masses of electron and hole along the x, y, and z directions obtained\nusing the VASPKIT code [41] are given in Table II. The electron effective mass is about\n0.4 (in unit of free electron mass), almost independent of the directions. The hole in\neach valence band has one light mass in the direction corresponding to the symmetry\nof the band and two heavy masses in two other directions. Compared with the values\nobtained in Ref. [14] using the 0.8\u2211-QSGW method, our calculated electron masses\nagree well, while some heavy hole masses have small discrepancy.\nTo overcome the bandgap underestimation problem of the semilocal functional, we\nperform quasiparticle G0W0 and GW0 calculations. The bandgap at \u0393 is calculated to be 5.538 eV and 5.995 eV for the G0W0 and GW0, respectively. The GW0 gap is larger than the experimental values, 5.6 eV from Ref. [9] and 5.26 eV from Ref. [10], but\ncomparable with the 0.8\u2211-QSGW gap of 5.81 eV [14]. The reason for the difference\nfrom the experiments may be that our calculation does not account for the electron-\nphonon coupling effect for the electronic bandgap.\nB. Bandgap renormalization due to the electron-phonon coupling\nIn Fig. S1, we test the convergence of the ZPR of the bandgap of \u03b2-LiGaO2 in terms of q-point sampling. We find the ZPR obtained with a 20\u00d720\u00d720 q-point grid is -0.354\neV, while that with a 24\u00d724\u00d724 q-point grid is -0.362 eV, showing that we have reached\nconvergence to 0.01 eV. It is interesting that this ternary oxide has a large ZPR. Using\nthe first-principles non-adiabatic AHC methodology Miglio et al. [18] found that the\nZPR for ZnO is -0.157 eV (the experimental data is -0.164 eV [42]) and for MgO -\n0.524 eV. \u03b2-LiGaO2 lies between ZnO and MgO in terms of the value of ZPR. Taking electron-phonon coupling into account, the GW0+ZPR gap is 5.633 eV, as shown in Table III, that agrees very well with the experimental result of 5.6 eV from the soft x-\nray spectroscopy measurements [9].\nFigure 3 (a) show the temperature dependence of the bandgap renormalization. The\nmagnitude of the bandgap renormalization increases monotonically with elevating\ntemperature. The absolute value of bandgap renormalization changes by 0.126 eV with\ntemperature increasing from 0 K to 300 K. In Fig. 3 (b), we present the vibrational\ncorrection to the VBM and CBM. The VBM correction is 0.228 eV and the CBM\ncorrection -0.134 eV due to zero-point motion. From the Fr\u04e7hlich model [18,43], the CBM correction can be expressed as 1 1\nZPR 2\nLO c\nm \n \n\n\n = \u2212 \u2212 \n  . The VBM\ncorrection has similar expression but opposite sign. The smaller correction for CBM is\nmainly due to the smaller effective mass for electrons. Bhosale et al. [44] showed that\nmaterials with d electrons in the valence band (e.g., CuGaS2, AgGaS2) exhibit a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the energy gap associated with low-energy\nvibrations of the d-electron elements, while those without d electrons (e.g., ZnSnAs2) exhibit the standard gap decrease with increasing temperature. For \u03b2-LiGaO2, the valence bands between -6 eV and 0 eV have no d electrons and its behavior agrees with\nthe result of Ref. [44].\nTo explore the origin of the bandgap renormalization, we estimate the ZPR using the\ngeneralized Fr\u04e7hlich (gFr) model proposed in Ref. [18]. In this model, the CBM correction gFr cZPR is given by\n( )\n( )\n1/2 gFr *\n4 0 deg\n2\n3/2\n0\n1 ZPR ( )\n2\n( ) ( )\n( )\nc n\njn\nj\nj\nd m n \n \u2212\n\n= \u2212 \n       \n  q q\nq p q q\nq\n, (8)\nwhere 0 and degn represent the primitive cell volume and the degeneracy of the band edge, respectively, *( )nm q is the electron effective mass, 0 ( )j q denotes the q \u2192 0 limit of the j-phonon branch, i.e. 0 ( )0 ( ) limj j qq   \u2192 = q q , and ( )jp q is the mode-polarity vector. A similar expression exists for the VBM correction. This model includes the\nfeatures of multiphonon, anisotropic, degenerate band extrema for real material and can\nbe readily evaluated only at q = \u0393. The ZPR for \u03b2-LiGaO2 from the generalized Fr\u04e7hlich model is found to be -0.307 eV, which captures 85% of the first-principles result,\ndemonstrating that the large ZPR of \u03b2-LiGaO2 is dominated by the contributions from the long-wavelength LO phonon modes.\nC. Optical property\nNext, we discuss the optical spectrum of \u03b2-LiGaO2. The calculated optical spectra based on the equilibrium static crystal structure are illustrated in Fig. 4 (a). The spectra\nobtained within the independent-particle approximation show different onsets for\ndifferent polarizations, consistent with the symmetry analysis for the electric dipole\ntransition presented above; for example, the onset of the spectrum is at 5.63 eV for E ||\nc, 5.71 eV for E || a, and 5.74 eV for E || b, respectively. This trend agrees well with the\nstudy of Radha et al. that used the 0.8\u2211-QSGW method [14].\nThe inclusion of the mBSE correction shows strong excitonic contributions to the\nspectrum. The onsets of the spectra of different polarizations are redshifted dramatically\nwith pronounced exciton absorption peaks at 5.20 eV (E || c), 5.27 eV (E || a), and 5.32\neV (E || b), respectively. The characteristics of our calculated spectra are in reasonable\nagreement with the experimental result of Tum\u0117nas et al. [11], though in the experiment\nthe positions of the peaks are higher in energy overall. The exciton wave function is expressed in the electron-hole product basis [40], , , , ,c v c v i i\ncv A   = k k k k . In Figs. 4(b)-\n4(d), we plot the fat-band pictures according to the coefficients , , || c i vA k of the exciton wave functions for the three marked transitions. The transition #1 is localized at \u0393 and\nis between the O 2pz states at the VBM and the CBM states. The transition #2 (#3) is also localized at \u0393, but involve the O 2px (2py) states and the CBM states.\nForm the data above, we can get an average binding energy of 0.43 eV for the\nexcitons corresponding to the transitions #1, #2, and #3. We note that for MgO, a wide\ngap semiconductor with a gap of about 7.8 eV [45], the exciton binding energy is\ncalculated to be 0.429 eV by Fuchs et al. [46], 0.37 eV by Filip et al. [47], while the\nexperimental value is 0.08 eV [45] and 0.145 eV [48]. This discrepancy is attributed to\nthe neglect of polaronic [40] and phonon screening effects [47]. Our mBSE calculations\nfor \u03b2-LiGaO2 do not involve the polaronic and phonon effects, likely leading to an overestimated exciton binding energy.\nWe estimate the binding energy Exb of the lowest exciton state using a simple hydrogen-like atom model, i.e. 2 xbE 13.606 / ( )em = (in eV) with \u03bc the effective mass, me the free electron mass, and \u03b5 the dielectric constant [49]. Using an average hole effective mass of about 3 me and an electron effective mass of 0.4 me, we obtain \u03bc = 0.35 me. We choose the static dielectric constant (including ionic contribution) of 7 for \u03b5, finding a reduced Exb of 0.097 eV, in line with the rough estimate of about 50 meV from the experiment of Tum\u0117nas et al. [11].\nRecently, studies of polarons from first principles have advanced considerably. A\nsecular equation involving phonons and electron-phonon matrix elements was proposed\nto investigate polaron energies and wave functions, without resorting supercell\ncalculations [50,51]. A self-consistent many-body theory of electron-phonon couplings\nwas developed, which unifies the calculations of phonon-induced band structure\nrenormalization and polaron localization [52,53]. The localization effects on the band\nstructure renormalization of \u03b2-LiGaO2 is worth investigating in future work. Moreover, recent developments of polaron calculations [50\u201353] make possible the exploration of\npolaronic effects on the exciton property."
