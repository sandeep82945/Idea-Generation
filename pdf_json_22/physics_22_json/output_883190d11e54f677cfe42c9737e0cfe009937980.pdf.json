Additionally, due to the existence of a negative group velocity spectral range, some of the wavefronts in the superfluid splash are converging.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have seen major advances in imaging of the fluid density n(r, t) and velocity v(r, t) fields in neutral quantum liquids such as superfluid 4He [1\u20134], superfluid 3He [5], atomic gas superfluids [6], and charged quantum liquids such as electrons in graphene [7] and Cooper-pair liquids in superconductors [8]. These emerging capabilities open a door to visualization of a variety of effects, some of which have already been described [9, 10]. A theoretical study of a family of such effects, splashes, is given in this paper.\nA splash is the response of the medium to a local perturbation of a short duration; it is described by an initial value problem. A familiar example from classical physics is the expanding pattern of annular waves caused by a small rock impacting a surface of calm water [11\u201313]. Analogs of this phenomenon exist in quantum liquids. For instance, a low-energy electron injected inside liquid 4He triggers quick formation of a bubble around it [14]; the reaction of the superfluid to the formation of the bubble is an example of a three-dimensional splash in a neutral quantum liquid. The surfaces of superconductors and two-dimensional electron systems allow for a large degree of control over the perturbation. Specifically, applying a short voltage pulse with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope to a graphene sheet [15] can initiate a splash in the two-dimensional sea of Dirac electrons.\nFor any localized disturbance, the response of the medium is small at long times t after the perturbation ceased to operate, and then is described by a linear theory. In such a theory, developed below, splashes are a result of the interference of collective excitations of the medium; the outcome is determined by their frequency spectrum \u2126(k) (here k is the wave vector).\nPrevious treatments of splashes focused on the water surface as a medium. Here the relevant excitations are the capillary gravity waves whose dispersion law in the deep water (and incompressible fluid) limit has the form [16]\n\u21262(k) = gk + \u03b3\n\u03c1 k3 (1)\nwhere g is the free-fall acceleration, k = |k| is the wave number, \u03b3 is the coefficient of surface tension of water and \u03c1 is the density of water.\nFor \u03b3 = 0 the initial value problem has been fully solved by Cauchy and Poisson (CP) [11]. Specifically, the position of the l-th wavefront in the splash rl as measured from the point of impact in the large time limit gt2/rl 1 is given by the expression\nrl = gt2\n8\u03c0l (2)\nwhose hallmark is accelerated expansion of the rings. The parameters of the spectrum (1) can be combined to form a spatial scale \u03bb, the capillary length, and a time scale \u03c4 , such as\n\u03bb =\n( \u03b3\ng\u03c1\n)1/2 = 0.28 cm, \u03c4 = ( \u03b3\ng3\u03c1\n)1/4 = 0.017 s (3)\nwhere the numerical values are for water at 20\u25e6C [16]. The CP theory is only valid for wavelengths long compared to the capillary length. When the scales (3) are used as units of length and time (see below), the dispersion law (1) acquires the parameter-free form\n\u21262 = k + k3 (4)\nwhich means that there is more to the water splash than implied by the CP result (2).\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n01 26\n1v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n3 0\nJa n\n20 23\n2 0 2 2 \u03a9\u2019 \u03a9\u2019 \u03a9/k \u03a9/k\nk\nv\nkm\nvm\nkc\nvc\nFIG. 1: Group \u2126\u2032(k) and phase \u2126(k)/k velocities versus the wave number k in units of l/\u03c4 and 1/l, respectively, Eq.(3), for capillary gravity waves (4).\nKelvin [17] pioneered a general method for analyzing splashes due to excitations with arbitrary dispersion law, and found that the dynamics of splashes is determined by the interplay between the phase and the group velocities. The CP result (2) has its simple form because the group velocity for gravity waves (\u03b3 = 0 in Eq.(1)) is half the phase velocity.\nFor the general dispersion relation, Kelvin argued that interesting phenomena are sure to occur whenever there are extrema of the phase velocity, because then the phase velocity \u2126/k and group velocity d\u2126/dk \u2261 \u2126\u2032(k) are equal (indeed the condition (\u2126/k)\u2032 = 0 is equivalent to \u2126/k = \u2126\u2032(k)). For the particular case of capillary gravity waves (shown in Figure 1), there is a minimum when k = kc = 1 and\nv = vc = \u221a 2 (23 cm/s, physical units). (5)\nThe group velocity \u2126\u2032 also has a minimum (Figure 1) at\nkm = (2/ \u221a 3\u2212 1)1/2 \u2248 0.39 corresponding to the velocity\nvm = \u221a 3 ( 2\u221a 3 \u2212 1 )1/4 \u2248 1.08 (18 cm/s, physical units) (6) Observations show [12, 13] that a few seconds following the perturbation of a water surface, a quiescent region inside the annular waves is formed. Rayleigh demonstrated [18] that this region expands with the constant velocity vm (6). Outside the quiescent region there are two systems of waves of different wavelength present at the same place. In practice only one system is visible,\nand Rayleigh conjectured that the other (corresponding to short waves of predominantly capillary origin) is rapidly damped. Rayleigh\u2019s conjecture has been justified by Lighthill [19] who also observed that new wavefronts nucleate \u201dfrom nowhere\u201d at the boundary of the expanding region of calmed water.\nLe Me\u0301haute\u0301 [20] additionally argued that the waves in the annular region have a narrow range of wave numbers centered around km, Figure 1, corresponding to the minimum group velocity vm (6).\nBelow we give a general theory of dynamics of wavefronts in splashes in the weakly absorbing isotropic medium and apply it to various cases. While elaborating on Rayleigh\u2019s results [18] regarding the water spash, we expand on Lighthill\u2019s observation [19], showing that new wavefronts arise at the inner boundary of the annular region in pairs at equal time intervals. We also support Kelvin\u2019s intuition regarding the significance of the minimum phase velocity vc (5): it sets the velocity of expansion of a group of capillary gravity rings in the long-time limit where the conjecture of Ref. [20] fails.\nThis theory also applies to a plasmonic splash in a twodimensional Fermi sea. Here the relevant dispersion law is [21\u201325]:\n\u21262(k) = gk + u2k2 (7)\nwhere g (no longer the free-fall acceleration) and the speed of sound u are determined by the equation of state of the electron gas [25]. While the spectra (1) and (7) are the same in the long-wavelength limit, the remaining difference - k3 versus k2 contributions - makes the plasmonic splash a simpler version of its water counterpart as discussed below.\nA final application of the theory involves a splash in bulk superfluid 4He whose elementary excitations exhibit a spectral region with negative group velocity [26]. A recent analysis of the wake patterns in this system [27] established that these excitations are responsible for features similar to the Kelvin ship wake. Below it will be shown that negative group velocity excitations are responsible for converging wavefronts in superfluid 4He splashes."

            "text": "Regardless of its particular manifestation, splashes are described by linear response theory [26, 28, 29]. Let us suppose that every particle of the medium is perturbed by an external field of the potential energy U(r, t). Then the operator of the perturbation acting on the whole medium is\nV\u0302 (t) = \u222b n\u0302(r, t)U(r, t)ddx (8)\nwhere n\u0302(r, t) is the Heisenberg density operator and d is the space dimensionality (in classical linear water wave\n3 theory n(r, t) is the height of the water surface while U(r, t) is the excess pressure [30]). The Fourier transform of the induced density due to the perturbation is given by \u03b4n(\u03c9,k) = \u2212\u03b1(\u03c9,k)U(\u03c9,k) where \u03b1(\u03c9,k) is a generalized susceptibility [26, 28, 29] and U(\u03c9,k) is the Fourier transform of U(r, t). Inverting the Fourier transform and specifying to the case of a point instantaneous source, U(\u03c9,k) = const, the induced density will be given by\n\u03b4n(r, t) \u221d \u222b d\u03c9ddk\n(2\u03c0)d+1 \u03b1(\u03c9,k)ei(k\u00b7r\u2212\u03c9t). (9)\nThe dynamics of the wavefronts in the splash can be determined by using Kelvin\u2019s stationary phase argument [11, 17]. At positions and times such as the phase f = k \u00b7 r \u2212 \u03c9t is large in magnitude, the exponential in (9) is highly oscillatory, and contributions of elementary plane waves interfere destructively leaving almost no net result, unless \u03c9 = \u00b1\u2126(k) (which are the poles of the susceptibility \u03b1(\u03c9,k) [26, 29]) and have a phase which is stationary with respect to k. Subjecting the phase\nf = k \u00b7 r\u2213 \u2126(k)t (10)\nto the condition of stationarity \u2207kf = 0 one finds\nr = \u00b1\u2207k\u2126 \u00b7 t. (11)\nSince the phase f is constant along the wavefronts, the last two equations can be solved to determine the wavefront dynamics in a parametric form. In an isotropic medium they become\nr(k) = \u2126\u2032\n\u2126\u2032k \u2212 \u2126 f, t(k) = \u00b1 1 \u2126\u2032k \u2212 \u2126 f (12)\nwhere the lower sign in the expression for t(k) accounts for the possibility of a negative group velocity.\nSince r and t are positive, the phase f is determined by the interplay between the phase and the group velocities, as well as by the sign of the latter. Specifically, there are three possibilities:\nf =  2\u03c0l, if \u2126\u2032 > \u2126/k\n\u2212 2\u03c0l, if 0 < \u2126\u2032 < \u2126/k 2\u03c0l, if \u2126\u2032 < 0\n(13)\nwhere l is a positive integer. The dynamics of the wavefronts of the last type is given by Eqs.(12) with the lower sign chosen in the expression for t(k); otherwise, the expression for t(k) with the upper sign should be used.\nSeveral conclusions anticipating the gross features of splashes can be deduced from Eqs.(12):\n(i) When the equation \u2126\u2032\u2032 = 0 has real solutions, i. e. the group velocity has an extremum v = vm, the expressions for r(k) and t(k) have simultaneous extrema. Then the equation r = |vm|t gives the locus of the points where new wavefronts nucleate or existing ones disappear. When this happens at a nonzero k = km which is\nnot an end point of the spectrum, the wavefronts appear or disappear in pairs. Since positions of extrema of t(k) are l-independent, the wavefronts appear (or disappear) at regular time intervals\nt(km) \u2261 tm = 2\u03c0\n|vmkm \u2212 \u2126(km)| . (14)\n(ii) In the vicinity of an extremum of the group velocity, the spectrum can be approximated by its Taylor expansion\n\u2126(k) = \u2126(km) + vm(k\u2212 km) + \u2126(3)(km)\n3! (k\u2212 km)3 (15)\nCombining it with Eqs.(12) and (13), one can then see that when the group velocity has a minimum (\u2126(3)(km) > 0), that is negative, vm < 0, then t(k) has a minimum while r(k) has a maximum at k = km. The consequence is that pairs of wavefronts nucleating with period tm (14) will be converging toward the center of the splash.\n(iii) The large t limit is controlled by the points of the spectrum where the phase and the group velocities are equal; these are also extrema of the phase velocity. If this happens at k = kc with finite common velocity v = vc, equation r = vct gives the asymptotic large t behavior of wavefronts whose wave numbers are close to k = kc. If kc = 0, then vc is the speed of sound u. If kc = 0 and vc = 0 (vc =\u221e), then the asymptotic large t expansion of wavefronts is sub-ballistic (super-ballistic).\n(iv) Eqs.(12) and (13) imply that if r/l and t/l are used as variables to represent splashes, visual complexity of their original r(t) patterns is reduced since all the wavefronts of given family (according to Eq.(13)) \u201dcollapse\u201d onto a single curve (or a pair of curves) representing that family."

In the t tm limit the effects of gravity are negligible, and evolution of these annular rings follows Eq.(17). As t \u2192 \u221e the solutions k(l)(t) asymptotically approach k = kc from above.

For arbitrary t > tm this is shown in Figure 3: \u201dnucleation\u201d at t = tm followed by bifurcation into two branches.\nAt t = 2tm (18) the equation for t(k) (12) acquires yet another solution k = km that for t > 2tm bifurcates into two. Their evolution repeats what was already found for the first pair of solutions k\u2212,+(t). Generally, new wavefronts are created periodically in 0.43 s intervals (18) followed by bifurcation into two, one of which, at t large, approaches the CP result (2) while the other expands with the velocity vc = 23 cm/s (5). These wavefronts given by f = \u22122\u03c0l solutions to Eqs.(12), are shown in Figure 3. The shaded grey region of calmed water expands with the constant velocity vg = 18 cm/s (5). In practice it should become clearly defined in a time interval estimated as several tm (18), i.e. several seconds, which explains observations.\nThe greyscale line r = vct is shown for reference; it separates the two f = \u00b12\u03c0l regimes discussed earlier.\nDespite their ubiquity, systematic quantitative studies of splashes on deep water in the linear regime have been lacking. Possible reasons for this have already been given by Rayleigh [18]: the short waves of capillary-gravity origin represented in Figure 3 by the \u201ddashed\u201d wavefronts may be rapidly damped, and the length scale for full development of the splash pattern may be inconveniently large.\nBoth of these obstacles can be overcome if instead of water one uses superfluid 4He. Damping is eliminated in the superfluid state, and the coefficient of surface tension of the superfluid extrapolated to zero temperature, \u03b3 = 0.37 erg/cm2 [31], is about 200 times smaller than that of water. Given the density of the superfluid \u03c1 = 0.145 g/cm3 [26], the 4He counterparts of the capillary length and the time scale (3) can be found as\n\u03bb(He) = 0.051 cm, \u03c4 (He) = 0.0072 s. (19)\nSince the capillary length of water (3) is five times larger, many more wavefronts will be present within the same observation area in the case of the superfluid. Moreover, the velocity unit in the case of superfluid 4He, \u03bb(He)/\u03c4 (He) = 7 cm/s, is about a half of that of water \u03bb/\u03c4 = 16 cm/s (3)."

Elementary excitations in superfluid 4He\nThe dispersion law \u2126(k) of elementary excitations in a superfluid is a non-monotonic function of the wave number k [26]: after an initial linear in k increase (16), the function \u2126(k) reaches a maximum at k = k\u2217 followed by a \u201droton\u201d minimum at k = k0. Therefore the group velocity is negative and takes on its minimal value in the [k\u2217; k0] range. Additionally, the spectrum has an end point k = ke where the group velocity vanishes [26]. As a result, the group velocity is positive and takes on its maximal value in the [k0; ke] range. Dependences of the group and the phase velocities on k are sketched in Figure 5; the phase velocity also has a minimum and a maximum at k finite, and both velocities have simultaneous maxima of magnitude u at k = 0.

Color legend is explained in the main text.\nfor the phase velocity curve to distinguish, according to the inequalities (13), five different spectral ranges corresponding to five families of the wavefronts:\n(i) The [0; k\u2217] range (blue).

Here the group velocity is larger than the phase velocity and the former takes on a maximal value.\n(v) The [kc2 ; ke] range (magenta). Here the group velocity is smaller than the phase velocity.\nEmploying the empirically known dispersion law [26], the extremal phase and group velocities (extrapolated to zero pressure) characterizing the splash in a superfluid can be estimated as:\nvm1 = \u22122 \u00b7 104 cm/s, vc1 = 5.9 \u00b7 103 cm/s, vm2 ' u = 2.4 \u00b7 104 cm/s, vc2 = 9 \u00b7 103 cm/s.

As t \u2192 \u221e, the corresponding solution to the equation for t(k) (Figure 6) approaches k = kc2 , thus implying that the wavefronts expand asymptotically reaching the velocity v = vc2 (20); the greyscale double-dashed line r = vc2t is shown for reference.\n(iii) The black colored (smallest slope) wavefronts emerge at the center of the splash with period t0 = 2\u03c0/\u2126(k0) and expand, asymptotically reaching the Landau critical roton velocity v = vc1 (20) for large t; the greyscale dashed line r = vc1t is shown for reference.\n(iv) The dynamics of the green colored (diverging) wavefronts can be understood via the argument already given in the discussion of the water splash.

            "text": "To summarize, we demonstrated that in large time regime dispersion law of relevant collective excitations alone suffices to understand dynamics of wavefronts in splashes in isotropic media. The outcome is determined\nby the interplay between excitation\u2019s phase and group velocities as well as the sign of the latter. The salient features of splashes are controlled by the existence of extremal values of the phase and the group velocities: the group velocity gives the expansion rate of the locus of the points where new wavefronts nucleate or existing ones disappear, while the phase velocity determines the large-time expansion rate of a group of wavefronts. If the group velocity is negative in a spectral range and takes on a minimal value within it, then converging wavefronts will be present in the splash.\nTo illustrate our theory we also carried out several case studies of experimentally relevant setups. Specifically, splashes on water and in two-dimensional electron gas were found to be similar: following a localized perturbation, a quiescent region inside the annular waves forms. This region expands with a constant rate corresponding to the minimum group velocity \u2013 the speed of sound for the two-dimensional electron gas or 18 cm/s for water, the conclusion due to Rayleigh [18]. New wavefronts nucleate at the boundary of the quiescent region at regular time intervals (0.43 s for water), in pairs (in water) or one at a time (in a two-dimensional electron gas). When the wavefronts appear in pairs, one of them expands with the minimal phase velocity (23 cm/s for water). The other (water and two-dimensional electron gas) expands asymptotically with a constant acceleration. The gross features of a splash in a superfluid are determined by five extremal velocities. Additionally, due to the existence of a negative group velocity spectral range, some of the wavefronts in superfluid 4He splash are converging.\nThe existence of converging wavefronts in splashes is not unique to superfluid 4He. Similar conclusions apply to a dipolar quantum gas whose spectrum also features a roton minimum [32]. More generally, whenever there exists a spectral range where the group velocity as a function of the wavenumber is negative and it takes on a minimal value within this range, then converging wavefronts will be necessarily present in the splash. The first known realistic example of a spectrum featuring excitations of negative group velocity, the optical branch of vibrations in crystals [33], belongs to this category, too.\nWe hope that both the general analysis and sample studies carried out in this work will guide future observations of splashes."
