    "abstractText": "The impact of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the biosynthetic manipulation of Priestia megaterium metabolism where an existing gene cluster is enhanced to produce and enrich bioactive secondary metabolites has been studied previously. In this research, we aimed to isolate and elucidate the structure of metabolites of compounds 1 and 2 which have been analyzed previously in P. megaterium crude extract. This was achieved through a PREP-ODS C18 column with an HPLCUV/visible detector. Then, the compounds were subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. Furthermore, bioinformatics and transcriptome analysis were used to examine the gene expression for which the secondary metabolites produced in the presence of AuNPs showed significant enhancement in transcriptomic responses. The metabolites of compounds 1 and 2 were identified as daidzein and genistein, respectively. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to assess the expression of three genes (csoR, CHS, and yjiB) from a panel of selected genes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of the identified secondary metabolites. The expression levels of two genes (csoR and yijB) increased in response to AuNP intervention, whereas CHS was unaffected.",

            "text": "Trace metals can function as effectors of metalloregulators or as cofactors of natural product biosynthetic enzymes in Streptomyces [1]. Additionally, they can influence the growth and morphology of Streptomyces. Recently, many metal ions have been studied for their ability to regulate secondary metabolite production in various microbes [2]. These metal ions can be involved in the initiation, activation, control, and inhibition of a variety of microbiological pathways as well as the interactions between soil, plants, and microbes. They are necessary for several metabolic processes, such as the electron transport chain, photosynthesis, and the transport and storage of various metabolites [3]. For example, copper ions can stimulate differentiation and antibiotic synthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor [4]. They can serve as a crucial cofactor in many enzymes and electron transport proteins through their redox activity [5]. As there is a low intracellular demand for Cu+, some microbes express efflux systems or excrete at least one kind of metal-binding\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45, 6704\u20136716. https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb45080424 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cimb\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45 6705\nmetallothionein to control the internal levels of this ion. These metalloregulators, such as CopY, CsoR, and YcnK, are called copper-sensing transcriptional regulators and are mainly present in Gram-positive bacteria [6,7]. Most bacteria also produce P-type copper export ATPases (CopA) as defense mechanisms when copper concentrations are high [7]. It has been found that CsoR from Thermus thermophilus binds to several different metal ions in vitro, including Cu+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ag+, and Ni2+, and allows the release of CsoR from the copper chaperone (copZ) promoter. Both copper and zinc ions can strongly upregulate copZ\u2013csoR\u2013copA expression in vivo [7,8]. Additionally, genomic modulation had been observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae when exposed to silver ions and nanoparticles (AgNPs). The transcriptome analysis demonstrated that, in comparison to silver ions, AgNPs improved copper transport and other genes, and the majority of these AgNPs affected genes playing important roles in the metabolism [9]. There have been only a few reports of NPs\u2019 effect on microorganisms\u2019 growth characteristics and secondary metabolite profiles. Liu et al. studied the antibiotic production of S. coelicolor M145 in the presence of copper oxide (CuO) NPs. They found that a low concentration of CuONPs increased the production of actinorhodin (ACT) antibiotics, whereas high concentrations inhibited this process. It was also observed that increased production of antibiotics was correlated with smaller sizes of CuO particles. Further, the transcriptional analysis demonstrated that the ACT biosynthetic gene cluster was significantly upregulated after exposure to CuONPs [10]. In another study, aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3NPs) were also shown to have a similar elicitor activity for secondary metabolism, while bulk particles had a low impact on the antibiotic production [11]. In recent years, increasing studies have demonstrated the role of NPs as an elicitor for inducing the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Although many efforts are still required to elucidate the mechanism, an effect of NPs on cytochrome P450 enzyme overexpression involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis has been proposed. The effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes on metabolite biosynthesis has been widely explored in plants. For example, CYP71B6 in Arabidopsis was found to have a biological impact on the biosynthesis of defense-related indolic compounds upon treatment with silver nitrate (AgNO3) compared to untreated leaves, indicating that CYP71B6 is involved in the biosynthesis of ICOOH derivatives [12]. In another study, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) have been investigated as a trigger for activating signal transduction pathways involved in the defense metabolites of Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings showed that the LPS perception triggered the enhanced expression and activity of CYP79B2/B3, leading to variation in the biosynthesis of specialized secondary metabolites [13]. The CYP450 enzymes are critical enzymes in the natural product biosynthetic pathway; their gene sequences have recently been discovered in bacteria [14]. Compared to mammalian P450s, bacterial enzymes have very high coupling efficiencies for native substrates [15]. Many pathways of microbial secondary metabolism contain CYPs involved in multi-step oxidation, rearrangements, epoxidations, and heteroatom oxidation [16]. For example, 18 different CYPs were found in S. coelicolor A3(2). Among them, CYP158A2, CYP105N1, and CYP170A1 encode three different BGCs (i.e., T3PK synthase, non-ribosomal peptide synthase, and terpene synthase, respectively) [16\u201318]. Although the CYP450 superfamily has been studied in various Bacillus species associated with secondary metabolism [19], one gene encoding a unique monooxygenase (cytochrome P450BM3) that can catalyze the hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids has been designated as CYP102A1 for B. megaterium [20]. This study aimed to isolate and elucidate the structure of the enriched compounds following AuNP intervention in P. megaterium metabolism. Bioinformatics and transcriptome analysis were then used to examine the impact of upregulation on gene expression of csoR, CHS, and yjiB that may be involved in the biosynthesis of the identified secondary metabolites.\nCurr.

However, numerous isoflavone derivatives were previously identified in several Streptomyces species [25\u201328]. The identity of daidzein (1) and genistein (2) was confirmed by matching with spectroscopic data in the literature [23].\nFigure 2.

Flavonoids and isoflavonoids are involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways [29]. Phenylpropanoids are exclusively utilized by plants and microorganisms and are derived from the shikimate pathway, which generates essential aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine and/or tyrosine. The biosynthetic pathway of both daidzein and genistein was already studied in plants [30]. Meanwhile, the entire biosynthesis pathway of naringenin is found in Gram-positive S. calvuligerus [31]. In recent years, researchers have studied the effect of NPs on Streptomyces metabolism to produce antibiotic secondary metabolites, with or without the induction of ROS [10,11,32]. Furthermore, CYP450 could dramatically affect microbial metabolism for the syntheis of chalcone derivatives. For instance, chalcone synthase (CHS) was found to be cotranscribed by RppA and RppB proteins in an engineered S. griseus. The induced transcript from the CYP450RPP enzyme would be read via rppA\u2013rppB genes and, due to this close proximity, CYP450RPP was found to be involved in the synthesis and modification of flavonoids and isoflavonoids [33]. Meanwhile, quinoneforming oxygenases (MomA) belong to the cupin superfamily and are mainly responsible for the binding of one equivalent metal ion. 3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) is biosynthesized by rppA and its neighbor gene CYP450-mel. MomA catalyzes the oxygenation of THN to produce flaviolin [34]. Two decades later, the ncs gene encoding naringenin chalcone synthase was discovered in S. clavuligerus. It is required for the link to the ncyP gene which encodes a CYP450 oxygenase. Both are responsible for the entire synthesis of naringenin [31]. The AntiSMASH prediction has previously been discussed and suggested the naringenin molecule that appeared in the MIBiG comparison of the molecules with structural similarities correlated with those found in S. calvuligerus [22]. Indeed, the HPLC profile of P. megaterium from crude extract isolations showed daidzein (1) and genistein (2) isoflavones as shown in Section 3.2 on structure elucidation. There has never been a reported study of naringenin-related compound production and isolation in P. megaterium. Therefore, it would be worthwhile investigating whether the naringenin pathway and putative gene clusters in P. megaterium are comparable to those found in S. clavuligerus and whether the production of isoflavone metabolites is affected by the presence of AuNPs.\nFigure 2. he ical structures of co pounds (1) and (2) isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of P. megaterium culture."

There are two copper efflux systems: one is a CopZ-like copper metallochaperone protein and the other is a copper-exporting P-type ATPase (CopA). CsoR and two sets of the copper chaperone are well studied in S. lividans [38]. This produced higher amounts of cytochrome (c) oxidases and tyrosinase in the CsoR deletion strain compared with the wild-type in response to copper stress [38]. In addition, both cytochrome (c) oxidases and quinol oxidases belong to the heme\u2013copper family of oxygen reductases [39,40].
