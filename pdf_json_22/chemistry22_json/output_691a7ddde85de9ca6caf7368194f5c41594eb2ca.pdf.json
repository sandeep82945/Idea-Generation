However, its potential mechanisms and biomarkers are still unclear. Methods: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLCQ-Exactive Orbitrap-MS)-based metabonomics was adopted to discover the potential biomarkers in mice after agarwood incense smoke (AIS) intervention. Furthermore, the chemical components in agarwood were identified based on UHPLC-Q-Exactive OrbitrapMS. The global view of potential compound-target-pathway (C-T-B) network was constructed through network pharmacology to understand the potentially material basis of biomarkers. Results: Metabolic profiling indicated that the metabolic changed significantly in mice serum after AIS intervention. A total of 18 potential biomarkers closely related to insomnia and emotional disease were identified, mainly involving in tryptophan metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways. A total of 138 components in agarwood were identified based on UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS. The results showed that mainly compounds such as flidersia type 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones (FTPECs) and sesquiterpenes exerted good docking abilities with key target proteins, which were involved in multiple diseases including depression and hypnosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study enhanced current understanding of the change of metabolic markers after AIS intervention. Meanwhile, it also confirmed the feasibility of combining metabolomics and network pharmacology to identify active components and elucidate the material basis of biomarkers and mechanisms.

Network pharmacology is a new discipline that could elucidate the action of TCM through constructing the \u201ccomponents-targets-biomarkers\u201d (C-T-B) network and screening out the targets of particular interest.16 The integration of metabolomics and network pharmacology provide great inspiration to explore potential pharmacological activity and elucidate the possible mechanism of agarwood incense smoke (AIS) intervention by connecting active compounds, molecular targets, metabolites and potential pathways.\nIn this paper, we aim to illustrate the differential biomarkers and possible mechanism after AIS intervening in mice using metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis. Firstly, the differential metabolites characterized as AIS intervention were analyzed by serum metabolomics and multivariate analysis. Moreover, the targets for upstream regulation of differential metabolites were excavated. Secondly, the chemical constituents of agarwood were characterized and the potential targets were predicted. Thirdly, the intersection of potential compounds targets and metabolite targets were screened and merged into a C-T-B based on the metabolomics and network pharmacology. Finally, these chemical constituents from agarwood were docked with pivotal targets through molecular docking study to further interpret the effects of AIS (Figure 1)."

However, due to the fact that most of the compounds have the same molecular formula and similar fragment ions, some chromone isomers cannot be distinguished. It is worthwhile to note that the total ion chromatography of agarwood incense smoke was basically consistent with the agarwood sample (Figure S2). Although the retention time of chromatographic peaks is slightly different.\nIt is useful to further identify the chemical components in agarwood based on the MS/MS spectrum and the cracking rule. According to reports, the most 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones in agarwood have been substituted by methoxy and hydroxyl groups, causing the neutral loss of 18 Da (-H2O),15 Da (-CH3) and 31 Da (-OCH3).22 The characteristic fragmentation behavior of the 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones was the cleavage of the CH2-CH2 bond between chromone moiety and phenyl moiety, forming the diagnose fragments of 6A+ and 6B+. The compound 2 had the molecular formula C17H18O7, and showed two fragment ions at m/z 193.0489 (6A+) and 107.0492 (6B+), which resulted from the breaking of CH2-CH2 bond. Besides, THPECs were also characterized as the successive neutral losses of two H2O and two CO molecules. Similar to the above cleavage feature, the compound 2 displayed the fragment ions at m/z 317.1008, 299.0903, 271.0955 and 243.1010, in accordance with the successive neutral losses of two H2O (m/z 299.0903) and two CO molecules (m/z 243.1010). Thence the compound 2 was tentatively annotated as aquilarone F belonging to the THPEC (Figure 4A).22 The compounds of 108, 119 and 123 showed similar molecular\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S348028 DovePress Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2022:16270\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nions at m/z 311 and the same molecular formula C19H18O4. However, the fragment ions among the three compounds were different due to the different positions of -OCH3. As for the compounds of 108 and 119, the fragment ions at m/ z 220.0721 (6A+) and 91.0543 (6B+), corresponding to chromone ion (C10H7O2+2 OCH3) and benzyl ion (C7H7), were tentatively identified as 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones (Figure 4B). Additionally, 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones could also undergo RDA cracking, producing fragments 1,3A+ and 1,3B+, except for THPECs. Similarly, the 1,3A+\nfragment ions at m/z 181.0490 (compound 108) and 151.0390 (compound 119) attributed to the RDA cracking were observed. Although it is not impossible to distinguish the isomers, it could be preliminarily inferred that two -OCH3 molecules were substituted at the A ring of compounds 108 and 119, while compound 123 had only one -OCH3 molecule at the A ring based on the fragment ions at m/z 181.0490 and 151.0390. The compound 108 and 119 were tentatively characterized as 6,7-dimethoxy-2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone or isomer (FTPEC), and the compound 123 was tentatively assigned as 6-methoxy-2-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]chromone or isomer (FTPEC).23\nAccording to the negative MS/MS spectrum, the phenolic compound (compound 3) was characterized as the neutral losses of -Glc (C6H10O5) based on the fragment ion at m/z 259.0244. The fragment ion at m/z 403.0665 resulted from the neutral losses of H2O molecule. Moreover, the neutral loss of C3H6O3 (m/z 331.0457) could aid to characterize the phenolic compound, which was consisted with the fragmentation characteristics of the flavone. The compound 3 was assigned to the Mangiferin (Figure 4C).24\nDrug Design, Development and Therapy 2022:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S348028 DovePress\n271\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nBesides, the cleavage of sesquiterpene (compound 20) was characterized by the successive neutral losses of H2O and CH2 molecules. The MS/MS spectrum with the fragment ions at m/z 235.1685, 217.1581, 189.1633, 175.1115 and 161.0955 corresponded to the successive neutral losses of two H2O molecules [M+H-2H2O]+ (m/z 217.1581), a CO molecule [M+H-2H2O-CO]+ (m/z 189.1633), and then two CH2 molecules [M+H-2H2O-CO-2CH2]+ (m/z 161.0955).

These above differential biomarkers identification results were mainly related to tryptophan metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis.\nMetabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the tryptophan metabolism, which included tryptophan, 5-HT, NAS, 6-hydroxymelatonin, 5-hydroxyindolea cetylglycine, N-Formylkynurenine, kynurenic acid and indole-3-acetate was the most significantly impacted metabolic pathway. Notably, these biomarkers were the important components in sleep-wake cycle and were related to a variety of neurological diseases.28 Tryptophan could be metabolised by the tryptamine, kynurenine pathways as well as the 5-HT pathway, which mainly included tryptamine, kynurenine, tryptophan, and the downstream metabolites (Figure 3C).29 Importantly, the increase of tryptophan, 5-HT, NAS, 5-hydroxyindoleacetylglycine, 6-hydroxymelatonin and the decrease of indole-3-acetate, N-Formyl-kynurenine and kynurenic acid indicated that tryptophan tended to the 5-HT pathway, thereby competitively reducing the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenic acid and tryptamine pathways. Tryptophan was the\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S348028 DovePress Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2022:16274\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nprecursor of the 5-HT, which had a direct effect on the synthesis of 5-HT. In the central nervous system, tryptophan has been implicated in regulation of sleep, depression and anxiety.30,31 5-HT, a precursor for the synthesis of NAS and subsequent melatonin, is an important chemical substance that induces sleep. According to report, 5-HT has been claimed to help alleviate insomnia, depression, and headaches.32As themetabolites of 5-HT,NASwas believed to be potential biomarkers for sleep-related disorders.33 Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland, which is located in the center of the brain but outside the blood-brain barrier.34 The secretion ofmelatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep\u2013wake cycle.35 Melatonin is mainly metabolized in liver via cytochromes P450 to form 6-hydroxymelatonin, which could reflect the level of metabolism of melatonin.36 It has been reported that the 6-hydroxymelatonin had the potentially neuroprotective.37 N-Formyl-kynurenine is the initial bioproduct of tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway that catabolizes nearly 95% of tryptophan in mammalian cells.38 Kynurenic acid is a downstream product of N-Formyl-kynurenine, which adversely affects sleep and cognitive, in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a disruption of the normal sleep architecture during the light phase.39 In summary, the tryptophan metabolic pathway plays an important role in sleep and emotional disease.40\nArginine and proline metabolism is one of the central pathways for the biosynthesis of the amino acids. Recent studies have shown that chlorogenic acid has a significant improvement effect in rat models of sleep deprivation, and the mechanism might regulate the abnormal pathways of arginine and proline metabolism.41 At the same time, we found that proline was the only disturbed metabolite in this pathway, and its up-regulation might relate the decline of the metabolic levels. According to a previous study, cysteine and methionine is likely associated with psychiatric condition.42 Additionally, MTA, a sulfurcontaining nucleoside produced by animal tissue metabolism, is a marker of sleep deprivation. Normally, it was cleaved in eukaryotic cells by an MTA phosphorylase to adenine and 5-deoxy-5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, which was the key step in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine.43 Steroid hormone plays an essential role in regulating metabolism, salt and water balance, and in enhancing immunity, withstanding illness and injury.44 Furthermore, the steroids could also be synthesized and metabolized by cholesterol in the central and peripheral nervous systems independently, acting on GABAA receptor.45 This may provide a possible mechanism for the hypnotic effect of neurosteroids. Cortisol as key biomarker in steroid hormone biosynthesis had a consistent variation trend with published literature.46\nFor the network pharmacology analysis, in total 138 compounds were determined and employed to construct C-T-B network combined with biomarkers. Notably, network pharmacology analysis highlighted 5 targets, namely AKT1, GAPDH, MAPK3, TP53 and EGFR. Among them, AKT1 was highly related to depression47 associated with disturbances of sleep, cancer48 and hypnosis.49 AKT1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase and is involved in lithium signaling, which has been considered a vulnerable gene for bipolar disorder previously.50A study considered that protein kinaseAKT1could be involved in pathogenesis of affective disorders.51 Anti-GAPDH autoantibodies play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.52 AKT1 and GAPDH were related to the disorder of glucose and energy metabolism in major depressive disorder.53 Abundant researches indicated that inflammation-related targets such as MAPK3, TP53 and EGFR were important in the pathophysiology of depression.54 Many reports have shown that MAPK played important part in synaptic plasticity.55 The activation of p38 MAPK cascades are implicated in synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders through clinical observations and preclinical investigations. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are one of the most frequent alterations in human cancers, which was associated with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The stress adaptive processes induced by mutant p53 trigger positive loops feeding its own accumulation in cancer cells."
