Fixing the construction cost comparable to that of the baseline detector design and considering the benchmark channels (Z \u2192 f f , WW fusion with H \u2192 f f , ZH \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd f f , and tt \u2192 b?\u0304?\u03bc\u03bd\u03bcud) of various operating modes of the CEPC, we obtain the optimal tracker radius that provides the best average resolution of the track momentum or jet energy. The optimal tracker radii for track momentum resolution range from 1.59 m to 1.73 m and for jet energy resolution from 1.82 m to 1.97 m, depending on the benchmark channels. Compared to the jets, the tracks prefer a smaller radius and a longer length because the track momentum resolution degrades more significantly than jet energy resolution in the forward region. The benchmark channel for Z-pole prefers a smaller radius and longer length compared to other benchmark channels because the final state particles at the Z-pole have a more forward distribution. We also analyze the scaling behavior of the optimal tracker configuration at floating construction cost and observe a weak dependence.",

            "text": "The Circular Electron Position Collider (CEPC) is a proposed \ud835\udc4d and Higgs boson factory [1, 2]. It has a main ring with a circumference of 100 km, which is almost four times the length of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3]. Table 1 summarizes its baseline operating scheme and the corresponding boson yields. As a \ud835\udc4d-factory, the CEPC will produce nearly one tera of \ud835\udc4d bosons at the center-of-mass energy (\ud835\udc38cm, \u221a \ud835\udc60) of 91.2 GeV. As a Higgs factory, it will produce one million Higgs bosons at \ud835\udc38cm of 240 GeV. Beyond the baseline operating scheme, \ud835\udc38cm of the CEPC can be upgraded to 360 GeV to study the top quark and the Higgs boson. Due to the much cleaner collision environment compared to the hadron collider and large integrated luminosity, the CEPC is expected to boost the measurement precision of the properties of the Higgs boson by an order of magnitude on top of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [4], to improve the current measurement precision of electroweak by at least an order of magnitude, and to perform extensive studies of flavor physics and QCD. To fully exploit the enormous physics potential of the CEPC, its detector is required to identify different physics objects efficiently and measure their energy and momentum precisely. The baseline design of the CEPC detector [2] is particle flow algorithm (PFA) [6] oriented, consisting of a highprecision tracking system with a low material budget, a high-granularity calorimeter system, and a 3-Tesla magnet system, as shown in figure 1. It is targeted at a variety of physics objects [7], including tracks and calorimeter clusters at the subdetector level, final state particles (including leptons, photons, charged and neutral hadrons) at the particle flow level, and high-level composite physics objects such as \ud835\udf0b0, \ud835\udc3e0\n\ud835\udc46 [8], \u039b0 [8], \ud835\udf0f [9], and jets [10].\nTracks and jets are the most important physics objects at CEPC. Because almost 97% of Higgs events and 70% of \ud835\udc4d-pole events decay into multi-jet final states, and the majority (\u223c65%) of\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nTable 1: The operation scheme of the CEPC, including the center-of-mass energy ( \u221a \ud835\udc60), the instantaneous luminosity (L), the total integrated luminosity ( \u222b L), and the event yields.

The successful reconstruction of tracks not only plays an essential role in the PFA oriented jet reconstruction, it is also critical for any physics measurement involving charged particles in the final state, e.g., Higgs analysis via the \u2113\u2113\ud835\udc3b channel, \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07/\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f measurements [9], and most of flavor physics measurements. In addition, free of the QCD background, hadronic events at CEPC are expected to be reconstructed with high efficiency and purity. The reconstruction of hadronic final states (jets) is thus an advantage of the CEPC compared to the LHC, for example in the analysis of \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f/\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50/\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a and the measurement of the weak mixing angle in \ud835\udc4d-pole operating mode.\nThe CEPC tracker takes a cylinder configuration with a radius of 1.8 meters and a length of 4.7 meters. Its barrel and endcaps joints at | cos(\ud835\udf03) | = 0.8. The tracker is highly hermetic with an acceptance characterized by | cos(\ud835\udf03) | < 0.995, and the acceptance of the calorimeter is\n\u2013 2 \u2013\neven larger. Figure 2 shows the measurement resolutions of the tracks and jets with the CEPC baseline detector, which provides per-mille level track momentum resolution and 3.5%\u20135% relative jet energy resolution in the barrel region. However, these resolutions degrade in the endcap region. The reconstruction performance of physics objects depends strongly on the radius and length of the tracker. The construction cost, which is evaluated by the tracker volume and tracker surface area in this paper, of the detector also depends strongly on these two geometric parameters. For example, a larger tracker usually has better performance, but also leads to higher construction cost. In this work, we optimize the tracker configuration, i.e., the tracker radius and the tracker length, with respect to the fixed construction cost. The tracker configuration optimization is based on several physics benchmark processes, including:\n- \ud835\udc4d \u2192 \ud835\udf07\u2212\ud835\udf07+/\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 91.2 GeV,\n- \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udf08 + \ud835\udf07\u2212\ud835\udf07+/\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 240 GeV,\n- \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion with \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udf07\u2212\ud835\udf07+/\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 360 GeV,\n- \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2192 \ud835\udc4f?\u0304?\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 and its charge conjugation at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 360 GeV, both denoted as \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2192 \ud835\udc4f?\u0304?\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51.\nTheir feynman diagrams are shown in figure 3. In these four processes, isolated muon tracks are used to optimize the track momentum resolution. For the optimization of the jet energy resolution, we use the jets hadronized from \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e in the first three processes and from \ud835\udc4f?\u0304?/\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 in the \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 process. The\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion process at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 360 GeV is included because the measurement of its cross section is crucial for the determination of the Higgs width. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology of optimization and the resolution modeling of track momentum and jet energy. In section 3, we obtain the optimal tracker configuration with the cost fixed to the baseline value. In section 4, we analyze the impact of the construction cost on the optimal configuration. Finally, we summarize the conclusions in section 5.\n\u2013 3 \u2013"

            "text": "The performance of the detector is evaluated as the average measurement resolution of physics objects with differential cross-sections (\ud835\udf0e) of the benchmark channels as weights, which is illustrated as the following formula:\nRes(\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc3f) = 1 \ud835\udf0e\n\u222b Res(\u039b; \ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc3f) d\ud835\udf0e\nd\u039b d\u039b, (2.1)\nwhere \u039b, Res(\u039b; \ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc3f), and Res are the kinematic variable, differential resolution, and average resolution for the physics objects, respectively. Specifically, Res stands for \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc38/\ud835\udc38 for tracks and jets, respectively. Due to the rotational symmetry of the detector, \u039b represents (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udf03) and (\ud835\udc38, \ud835\udf03) for tracks and jets, respectively. In the integral, the acceptance of the detector, | cos \ud835\udf03 | < 0.995 for tracks, is considered. The d\ud835\udf0ed\u039b is obtained from the WHIZARD [11] event generator. Figure 4 shows the polar angle distributions of the quarks in the benchmark channels where the particles and antiparticles are merged. The muons have almost the same distributions as the quarks in the same process, so the distributions of the muons are not shown in figure 4. The quarks at the \ud835\udc4d-pole are distributed forward as 1+cos2 \ud835\udf03 in the leading order of electroweak theory [12]. In the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b process near threshold, the Higgs bosons are produced almost at rest. The fermions decaying from the lowly boosted and spin-zero Higgs boson are isotropically distributed. In the\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion process, the fermions from the Higgs decay are significantly forward distributed because of the strongly forward distributed Higgs boson. In the \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2192 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udf08\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 channel, near the threshold of top quark production, the fermions have the polar angle distributions of the form\n\u2013 4 \u2013\n1 + \ud835\udc46\ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc53 cos \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc53 [13, 14], where \ud835\udc46 denotes the polarization of top quark and \ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc53 is the so-called analysis power for \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udf07, and their antiparticles). \ud835\udf05 \ud835\udc53 have opposite signs for the particle and its antiparticle. After merging particle and antiparticle, the fermions in the \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2192 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udf08\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 channel have a flat distribution in cos \ud835\udf03 . We model the \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 as a function of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 and cos \ud835\udf03 for the tracks, and model the \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc38/\ud835\udc38 as a function of \ud835\udc38 and cos \ud835\udf03 for the jets. We also parameterize a function by the radius and length of the tracker according to the full simulation results. The modeling details for the tracks and jets are presented in sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. Finally, we use the construction cost constraint. The tracker length \ud835\udc3f can be determined by the tracker radius \ud835\udc45 once the cost is fixed. For simplicity, we use \ud835\udc45 to describe the tracker configuration in the following, and the average resolution can be evaluated as a function of \ud835\udc45. We obtain the optimal \ud835\udc45 as well as \ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f, etc., by obtaining the best average resolution. You can read the results and discussions in section 3."

            "text": "The projection of the track onto the endcap is an arc, and the track transverse momentum resolution is primarily determined by the accuracy of the radius of the arc. We define the effective radius \ud835\udc5f as the distance between the position of the outermost detectable track hit and the \ud835\udc67-axis. For a particle with an elementary charge and a transverse momentum of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 flying in a magnetic field of 3 T, the radius of the arc is approximately 1.1 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47GeV/\ud835\udc50 m. Typically, the \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 of an isolated track is several GeV/\ud835\udc50, so the radius of the arc is several times larger than the effective radius \ud835\udc5f .

The larger the arc length for a given \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 value, the better the track momentum resolution can be. This explains the degradation of \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 when the particle hits the endcaps. In the first-order approximation, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 is proportional to \ud835\udc5f\u22122 [15] and can be parameterized as:\n\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc5f\u22122\n\ud835\udc45\u221220 (\ud835\udc500 + \ud835\udc501 cos2 \ud835\udf03),\nln \ud835\udc500 = \ud835\udc4e0 + \ud835\udc4f0 ln \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc510 ln2 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udc501 = \ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4f1 ln \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc511 ln2 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 .\n(2.3)\nWe use the terms in the parentheses in eq.

            "text": "In this section, we research the optimal configuration with the construction budget fixed to the baseline. Figure 6 shows the relationship of the tracker length \ud835\udc3f versus the radius \ud835\udc45 with the fixed cost. In this work, the cost of the detector can be estimated by the volume of the tracker, the surface area of the tracker, and the volume of the entire calorimeter system. In principle, a more realistic estimator could be a linear combination of these estimators with different weights. However, since the weights are not known, we will optimize the tracker configuration with respect to each cost estimator. The optimal configuration with respect to the combination of these estimators should be in the middle of the optimal configurations for each cost estimator. For the calorimeter volume estimator and the tracker surface area estimator, the dependencies of \ud835\udc3f on \ud835\udc45 are similar, so we discuss only the tracker volume estimator and the tracker surface area estimator below.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nUsing eq. (2.2)\u2013(2.3), the track transverse momentum resolution is predicted as a function of \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 and cos \ud835\udf03. For a given track momentum, the track transverse momentum resolution as a function of cos \ud835\udf03 is shown in figure 7. All curves have a U-shaped valley. The wide bottom corresponds to the tracks hitting the barrel, and the two sides are the tracks hitting the endcaps. The closer the track is to the \ud835\udc67-axis, the smaller the effective radius becomes, resulting in a rapid degradation of the track momentum resolution.\nSimilarly, with eq. (2.4), the jet energy resolution is predicted as a function of cos \ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udc38 . For a given jet energy, the jet energy resolution as a function of cos \ud835\udf03 is shown in figure 7. The figure shows a similar pattern, a U-shaped valley, to that of the track. However, the dependence of JER on the polar angle is much weaker than that of the track momentum resolution, since the measurement of the jets can always rely on the ECAL, especially in the forward region of the detector. The performance of the jets in the endcaps is up to two times worse than that in the barrel.\nAs the radius \ud835\udc45 increases (and the length \ud835\udc3f decreases respect to the fixed cost), the measurement performance of the tracks and jets gets better in the barrel and gets worse in the endcaps, as shown in figure 7. There is an optimal \ud835\udc45 to achieve the best average resolution over the phase space of physics objects. The average track momentum resolution and the average JER are calculated as functions of the tracker radii, as shown in figure 8. Table 2 summarizes the optimization results for each channel and cost constraint.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nFor the optimal tracker configuration, tracks prefer a smaller tracker radius (in other words, a larger tracker length) compared to the jets for each of these benchmarks. This is because the resolution of the tracks in the forward region degrades much more than that of the jets. Therefore, a longer tracker length is required for the tracks to mitigate the poor performance in the endcaps. The benchmark channels of the \ud835\udc4d process prefer a longer tracker compared to those of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion, and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 processes for both the tracks and the jets. This is because the particles in the final state of the \ud835\udc4d-process have a stronger forward distribution; therefore, the resolution in the forward region receives a higher weight.\nAs for the optimal performance, the optimal average energy resolution for the jets depends mainly on the jet energy, since the dependence of the resolution on the polar angle is small. The benchmark channel with more energetic jets will have better optimal performance. For the tracks, both the polar angle distribution and the energy distribution of the tracks affect the optimal average resolution. We find two simple cases to analyze. (1) The tracks in the benchmark channels of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 processes have a relatively flat distribution in cos \ud835\udf03. Therefore, in these two channels, the benchmark channel with more energetic track will have the worse optimal performance. (2) The optimal average resolution of benchmark channel of \ud835\udc4d is comparable to that benchmark channel of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b. In the former, the tracks have advantages due to their lower energy and disadvantages due to their more forward direction. Finally, the two factors cancel each other out.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nTable 3 shows the performance degradation for different tracker radii compared to the optimum for each benchmark channel. The degradations for jets are generally smaller than those for tracks. This is simply because the performance of the jets is less sensitive to the polar angle.\n\u2013 12 \u2013"

For tracks, the optimal \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f is independent of the construction budget. When the cost is estimated as the tracker volume, we can rewrite eq. (2.3) by replacing (\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc3f) with (\ud835\udc49 , \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50):\n\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 /\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc49\u22122/3 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udf03; \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50),\nwhere \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc49 is a function of (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udf03) and \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 is the parameter of the function. The average resolution would then be \ud835\udc49\u22122/3 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50). The tracker volume as a global scaling factor does not affect the optimal \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 and \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f. The optimal average resolution is proportional to \ud835\udc49\u22122/3.\nWhen the cost is estimated as tracker surface area, we can reformulate eq.

These assertions are confirmed in figure 9. For jets, however, the optimal \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f is only weakly dependent on the construction budget. As the size of the tracker increases (assuming that the shape remains unchanged), the performance in the barrel benefits more than that in the endcaps. In particular, performance in the region near the \ud835\udc67-axis can\u2019t benefit from the longer tracker length. With a higher construction budget, it would be better to increase (decrease) the length (radius) to balance the performance in the barrel and endcaps. Thus, the \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f becomes smaller as the construction budget increases."

            "text": "The CEPC, as a future Higgs and \ud835\udc4d boson factory, focuses on testing the Standard Model and searching for new physics. To fully exploit its physics potential, the optimization of its detector is necessary. In this paper, we focus on the tracker configuration optimization in terms of the construction cost and two key detector performances, i.e. the track momentum resolution and the jet energy resolution. Multiple benchmark channels are considered, including \ud835\udc4d \u2192 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc53 ,\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion with \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc53 , \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udf08 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc53 , and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2192 \ud835\udc4f?\u0304?\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51, covering four operation modes of CEPC with \ud835\udc38cm from 91.2 GeV to 360 GeV. We first perform a cost constrained optimization of the tracker configuration with the cost fixed to the baseline value. The cost is estimated by either the tracker volume or the tracker surface area. In the baseline design of the CEPC detector, the tracker has a cylinder configuration (\ud835\udc45 = 1.8 m, \ud835\udc3f = 4.7 m) with corresponding volume and surface area of 47.84 m3 and 73.51 m2, respectively. The resulting optimal tracker radii range from 1.59 m to 1.73 m for track momentum resolution and from 1.82 m to 1.97 m for jet energy resolution, depending on benchmark channels. The optimal \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f fixing tracker volume to CEPC baseline is shown in table 4. In general, tracks prefer smaller \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f compared to jets for all benchmark channels because the tracks have a deeper valley in the curve of resolution versus cos \ud835\udf03, as shown in figure 7. The benchmark channels of the \ud835\udc4d process prefer smaller optimal \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f for both tracks and jets compared to those of the \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc3b,\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a fusion, and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 processes because the tracks and jets in the \ud835\udc4d process have a more forward distribution. The optimal average resolution for the jets mainly depends on the average energy. In contract, the optimal average resolution for the tracks depends on not only the average energy but also the polar angle distribution, since the resolution for the track is more sensitive to the polar angle compared to that for the jet. Compared to the optimal configurations, the degradation of the baseline detector are within 0.4% for the jets and 12.4% for the tracks. Regarding the dependence of the tracker configuration on the construction budget, we find that as the construction budget increases, the optimal configuration for tracks remains unchanged, and the corresponding average resolution is inversely proportional to the surface area of the tracker. For jets, on the other hand, the optimal \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc3f becomes smaller as the construction budget increases, and the corresponding average resolution improves slightly. If we double the construction budget, the average resolutions improve by 37% to 50% for tracks and 5% to 9% for jets, depending on the benchmark channel and the cost estimator."
