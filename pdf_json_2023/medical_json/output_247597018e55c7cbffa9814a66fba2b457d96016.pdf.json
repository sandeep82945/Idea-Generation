    "abstractText": "This study aims to analyze the cycle characteristics, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes in early rescue intracytoplasmic sperm injection (r-ICSI) cycles in normal and hyper-ovarian response women in their first IVF/ICSI attempts. Data from short-term in vitro fertilization (IVF, N = 7148), early r-ICSI (N = 618), and ICSI (N = 1744) cycles were retrospectively analyzed from normal and hyper-ovarian women who underwent their first IVF/ICSI cycles at our center from October 2015 to October 2021. The r-ICSI group was subdivided into partial r-ICSI (N = 451) and total r-ICSI (N = 167) based on the number of fertilized oocytes in the IVF part. Cyclic characteristics, pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes in the fresh cycle were compared among the four groups; pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes in frozen-thawed cycles were compared regarding cleavage and blastocyst transfers derived from r-ICSI cycles. Partial r-ICSI cycles showed different cyclic characteristics compared to total r-ICSI cycles, presenting as elevated AMH and estradiol levels on trigger day and an increased number of oocytes retrieved. Early r-ICSI delayed blastocyst development as seen by the increase in the number of day 6 blastocysts. There was no significant difference among the groups in clinical pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and live birth in fresh cleavage-stage embryo transfer cycles. However, early r-ICSI groups showed a reduction in clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in fresh blastocyst transfer cycles but not in the frozen-thawed cycles. For pregnant women, early r-ICSI did not show a negative effect on the risk of preterm birth, Cesarean section, neonatal birth weight, and sex ratio. In conclusion, early r-ICSI had comparable pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes when compared with short-term IVF and ICSI groups in fresh cleavage-stage embryo transfer cycles, but early r-ICSI did result in reduced pregnancy outcomes in fresh blastocyst embryo cycles, possibly due to delayed blastocyst development and asynchronization with the endometrium.",

            "text": "Fertilization is a complex physiological process that successively includes sperm penetration, extrusion of the second polar body (PB), oocyte activation, decondensation of maternal and paternal nuclei, and cytoplasmic chromosome migration of the pronuclear material [1]. A fault with any of the individual steps could cause fertilization failure, thus leading to infertility at the very beginning step [2]. Despite the success of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertile couples, fertilization failure is the most frustrating situation for embryologists and leads to cycle cancellation, economic loss, and much distress for the patients. The incidence of total fertilization failure (TFF) after in vitro fertilization (IVF), in cases with normal sperm quality, has been reported to range from 5% to as high as 15\u201320% [3]. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was introduced in the early 1990s\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 1993. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12051993 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nto treat severe male infertility by injecting sperm into the oocytes [4], with a significantly reduced incidence of TFF [5]. ICSI application in ART cycles has increased rates to close to 80% in the United States and approximately 100% in the Middle East [6]. The reliability in fertilization represents a plausible reason for the expansion of ICSI over IVF for non-male infertility indications. However, excessive employment of ICSI in couples without male factor infertility, aiming at preventing TFF, is still debated and thought to have non-superior impacts on pregnancy outcomes, with higher costs and increased workload [7,8]. Fertilization failure after IVF is proposed to be due to the failure of a sperm to penetrate into the oocytes. Rescue ICSI (r-ICSI) was first introduced in 1993 for insemination on the second day after IVF failure, solving sperm penetration issues. However, late r-ICSI on 1-day-old oocytes yields poor fertilization and pregnancy outcomes, probably due to oocyte aging and asynchronization between embryo development and endometrial receptivity. Late r-ICSI is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes in the fresh cycle [9], while embryos derived from late r-ICSI are suggested to be transferred in a frozen-thawed cycle with improved implantation rates and clinical pregnancy rates [10,11]. Based on the published data, it is necessary to notice that the overall success rate of late r-ICSI is in the range of \u201cfutility\u201d or \u201cvery poor prognosis\u201d [12]. Short-term IVF combined with early r-ICSI at 4\u20136 h after insemination could improve the fertilization outcomes and avoid oocyte aging since the second PB is extruded in 80% and 90% of fertilized oocytes by 4 and 6 h, respectively [13]. In addition, to prevent TFF, short-term IVF with early r-ICSI can shorten the incubation time of oocytes in a potential detrimental environment from metabolic sperm degradation products. In clinical practice, however, given the increased burden of laboratory workflow implementation, the early r-ICSI technique is currently quite unpopular. Hitherto, limited studies focused on the pregnancy outcomes from early r-ICSI, the lack of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical information, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes, hindering the application of early r-ICSI. Given this scenario, it is worth depicting the beneficial roles of early r-ICSI in order to assist embryologists in proceeding with IVF in non-male factor infertility. Our center has been performing short-term IVF and early r-ICSI for non-male factor infertile couples in their first IVF cycle for over ten years. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cyclic characteristics between short-term IVF, r-ICSI, and ICSI cycles from normal and hyperovarian response women in their first IVF attempts and identify the potential risk factors of fertilization failure. The pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were compared among the groups to evaluate the safety and efficacy of r-ICSI on pregnancy outcomes."

            "text": "ICSI, one of the most remarkable technological breakthroughs in ART, was initially developed to conquer severe male infertility but is currently widely applied in infertile couples without an indication of male factor infertility due to the guaranteed fertilization\nrate [17]. An open-label, randomized controlled study showed that ICSI did not improve the live birth rate compared with conventional IVF in infertile couples without male factor infertility, which challenges the value of the routine use of ICSI in ART [18]. Lately, clinical evidence has supported the need to limit the extensive use of ICSI and stated that the use of ICSI should be reserved only for male factor infertility [18]. Among the strategies that encourage the use of conventional IVF, rescue ICSI, by performing ICSI after 4 to 24 h on unfertilized oocytes, has been proposed to effectively rescue cycles with TFF or near TFF [19]. Given the implementation difficulties, early r-ICSI is currently not the preferred option compared to late r-ICSI, even though late r-ICSI is associated with a low success rate and deterioration in oocyte quality and embryo development. In addition, the cyclic outcomes, clinical safety, and efficacy of early r-ICSI have been poorly investigated to date. A previous study showed a reduced total number of top-quality embryos yielded on day 3 from early r-ICSI in women with primary infertility compared with conventional ICSI (4.02 vs. 5.15). No significant difference was found in pregnancy and delivery outcomes between the two groups [20]. Another long-term retrospective study suggested similar clinical pregnant and neonatal outcomes with early r-ICSI compared with IVF and ICSI; however, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were not well-defined in this study, and no specific analysis was performed on blastocyst transfers and frozen embryo transfer cycles [21]. In this study, we performed a retrospective 6-year analysis on embryonic laboratory parameters as well as pregnancy and delivery outcomes from early r-ICSI cycles in non-poor ovarian women during their first IVF attempts. The main results showed that early r-ICSI has no negative effect on pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes in fresh cleavage-stage transfer cycles, which is similar to previously reported pregnancy outcomes [20,21]. Interestingly, the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates from fresh blastocyst transfers were dramatically reduced in r-ICSI groups compared with IVF and ICSI groups, even though the fresh blastocyst transfer showed superior pregnancy and delivery outcomes compared to cleavage-stage embryos in IVF and ICSI groups. The possible reasons for these inferior pregnancy outcomes could be delayed blastocyst development and the time shift in fecundation. The blastocyst formation rate and top-quality blastocyst rate were decreased in r-ICSI groups compared to the IVF group, indicating that delayed fertilization by 5\u20136 h may postpone embryo development at the blastocyst stage and possibly lead to asynchronization between the blastocyst and endometrial receptivity. However, the sample size for fresh blastocyst transfers in r-ICSI groups was small. The reasons for dissatisfying pregnancy outcomes in fresh blastocyst transfer and the underlying mechanisms need to be further verified. ICSI or half ICSI has been proposed for use in couples with primary and unexplained infertility since the fertilization barrier could be the causative factor for primary unexplained infertility [22]. However, evidence of improved fertilization and pregnancy outcomes with the use of ICSI, rather than IVF, for primary and unexplained infertility is still debated [23]. In this study, although the proportion of patients with primary infertility in the r-ICSI groups was higher than in the IVF group, the actual number of cases (417 cases) was about one-tenth of the IVF group (3419 cases). Likewise, the actual quantity of couples with unexplained infertility (128 cases) was three-tenths of the IVF group (420 cases) despite the increased proportion. The normal fertilization (2PN) rates were acceptable both in the IVF and r-ICSI groups (62.03%, 57.75%, and 65.31%, respectively), although lower than the ICSI group (67.61%), while the embryo laboratory data and the overall pregnancy outcomes were similar among the IVF, r-ICSI, and ICSI groups, and TFF occurred in 21 couples (0.27%) in the IVF group after r-ICSI and 8 couples (0.45%) in the ICSI group. A prospective clinical study randomized 60 unexplained infertile couples with IVF or ICSI, and their results showed no significant differences in fertilization rate, embryo quality, implantation rate, and live birth rate [22]. A retrospective analysis of 1130 half-ICSI treatments found no improvements in pregnancy outcomes in ICSI-originated embryo transfers in spite of superior fertilization rates and embryo quality [22]. Currently, the evidence supporting the routine or preventive use of ICSI for primary and unexplained infertility is limited\nand does not reveal improvements in clinical outcomes. Early r-ICSI combined with IVF successfully prevents the occurrence of fertilization failure and does not affect embryo quality and clinical outcomes. Late r-ICSI, re-insemination on 1-day-old oocytes, has been proposed as a supplementary strategy to prevent cycle cancellation due to TFF, in spite of the fact that it may result in an increased proportion of polyspermy, poor embryo quality with genetic abnormalities, and poor pregnancy outcomes [24]. Except for the possibility of double insemination of oocytes that were already fertilized due to disappearing or delayed pronuclei formation, the 3PN formation also increased because of oocyte aging [25]. Reducing the time between oocyte retrieval and r-ICSI on aged oocytes can yield a higher rate of normal fertilization, as well as improved embryo quality and pregnancy outcomes. Traditionally, in our laboratory, the early fertilization sign of 2PB is checked at 4 p.m. (4 h later after insemination), and r-ICSI is performed on oocytes without 2PB at 5\u20136 p.m. if the proportion of oocytes with 2PB is less than 30%. Our data showed the rate of 3PN is significantly reduced in r-ICSI groups compared to the IVF group, and the 2PN rate was comparable to the IVF group. Therefore, checking the second PB at 4 to 6 h after insemination can precisely evaluate the fertilization failure, and early r-ICSI does not increase the risk of polyspermy. The limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of the r-ICSI procedure, as well as the fact that the incidence of r-ICSI is relatively low in IVF cycles, resulting in the small sample size in the r-ICSI groups compared to the IVF and ICSI groups, especially the small sample size in fresh blastocyst transfer cycles. Considering the controversies in strictly distinguishing normal and hyper-response women in clinical practice [26,27], the data from normal and hyper-ovarian responses were not analyzed separately. In addition, fertilization failure also occurred in repeated cycles, which has a normal fertilization rate by IVF insemination, and aging has been correlated with zona pellucida thickening, which is also a risk for fertilization failure, while women with repeated cycles and poor ovarian response were excluded from this study. Further studies are needed to explore the risk factors and cyclic characteristics for fertilization failure and the outcomes of r-ICSI in women with repeated cycles and poor ovarian response."

Our finding showed that increased ovarian reserve function (young age, high AMH, and increased number of oocytes retrieved) may be a risk factor for partial FF but not for TFF. The pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were comparable in fresh cleavage-stage embryo transfers from r-ICSI cycles compared with IVF and ICSI cycles. However, postponed insemination by r-ICSI may potentially delay blastocyst development, thus resulting in a reduction in the live birth rate in fresh blastocyst transfers. Therefore, blastocysts derived from r-ICSI cycles are suggested for frozen-thawed transfer cycles. Our study demonstrates that early r-ICSI is an efficacy and safe option for embryologists in proceeding with conventional IVF in couples without male infertility.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.Q. and Q.X.; methodology, L.C.; software, Q.Q.; validation, H.Z., L.C. and X.L.; formal analysis, L.C.; resources, Q.Q. and Q.X.; data curation, J.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.C; writing\u2014review and editing, Q.Q. and Q.X.
