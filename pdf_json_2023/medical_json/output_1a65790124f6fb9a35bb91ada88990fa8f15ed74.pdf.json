We performed an environmental chemical analysis of five Slovenian water samples, two rivers, one groundwater, and the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants, with a highly sensitive analysis of twenty-five endocrine-disrupting compounds belonging to the groups of natural hormones, synthetic hormones, and bisphenols. Since these compounds are simultaneously present in the environment, it is important to study their individual effects as well as the effects of mixtures. We investigated in vitro the estrogenic potency of selected natural and synthetic steroid hormones and bisphenols detected in surface, ground and waste water in Slovenia using the OECD-validated transactivation assay on the cell line Hela9903. We predicted their mixture effects using the concentration addition model and compared them with experimentally determined values. Two mixing designs were used: a balanced design in which chemicals were combined in proportion to their individual EC50 values, and an unbalanced design with compounds in proportion to their measured concentrations in the environmental samples. The estrogenic effects of the experimental mixtures followed the concentration addition model. Real water samples exhibited weaker estrogenic effects, showing the great heterogeneity of the real water samples.\nAbbreviations: BPA, bisphenol A; BPAF, bisphenol AF; BPAP, bisphenol AP; BPB, bisphenol B; BPC, bisphenol C; BPE, bisphenol E; BPF, bisphenol F; BPG, bisphenol G; BPS, bisphenol S; BPZ, bisphenol Z; CA, concentration addition; CMA, chlormadinone acetate; E1, estrone; E2, 17\u03b2-estradiol; E3, estriol; EE2, 17\u03b1ethinylestradiol; EA, effect addition; ER, estrogen receptor; NOEC, no observed effect concentration; OECD, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n* Corresponding author.

            "text": "Substances that exhibit endocrine disruptive properties (endocrine disrupting chemicals, EDCs) are one of the most important contaminants of emerging concern, as they pose great risks for causing adverse effects on aquatic organisms if present in watersheds (Carnevali et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2018; Sumpter, 2005). The effects that they pose towards non-target aquatic organisms can be severe and are mainly related to their ability to disrupt the homeostasis of the endocrine system. This may manifest in serious conditions such as the development of cancer and disorders of reproductive, neuroendocrine, and immune systems (Kuo et al., 2012; van Duursen et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2022). For example, it was shown that chronic exposure to low concentrations of synthetic estrogen, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, led to feminization of male fish and impacts on gonadal development which resulted in a near extinction of the species from the lake that was studied (Kidd et al., 2007). The toxic effects of EDCs are important not only in terms of aquatic wildlife and their biodiversity but can also be detrimental to human health. Non-target chronic effects of EDCs on humans are associated with chronic exposure to contaminated waters through ingestion of treated and untreated waters, contaminated food, and dermal exposure (Ju and\nZouboulis, 2016; Pironti et al., 2021). This poses a risk for adverse developmental, neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular, immune effects, and negative effects on fertility rates and presents a serious modern public health issue (Brehm and Flaws, 2019; Schug et al., 2011; Vessa et al., 2022).\nSteroid natural and synthetic hormones are among the most potent EDCs of pharmaceutical origin in the aquatic environment and are considered the group of pharmaceuticals of highest concern (Runnalls et al., 2010). Similar conclusions on the importance of identifying drugs that pose risks to the environment were drawn later by Gunnarsson et al. (2019). Particularly ethinylestradiol (EE2) and some progestogens (e.g. levonorgestrel) (Fig. 1) are considered the human pharmaceuticals of highest environmental concern for the aquatic environment (Gunnarsson et al., 2019). Human urine is one of the sources where natural and synthetic hormones enter the aquatic environment as they are used as contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapy in human medicine (Wise et al., 2011). After entering the water treatment system, a portion of them is removed, however, they are still present in sewage effluents from where they enter surface water (Wise et al., 2011). During wastewater treatment they can also be transformed back to their parent compounds (eg. glucuronide conjugates to their parent estrogens) and transformation of glucuronide conjugates also occurred in river water\nM. Durcik et al.\nChemosphere 330 (2023) 138712\n(Kumar et al., 2012). Additionally, hormones are used in veterinary practice and agriculture industry which is another source of their presence in wastewater. Besides that, livestock waste can also directly enter environmental waters (Ojoghoro et al., 2021; Wise et al., 2011). Sources where bisphenols enter wastewater are also industrial waste and urban runoff (Cladie\u0300re et al., 2013), additionally, they enter the environment as atmospheric aerosols from burning municipal waste (Fu and Kawamura, 2010). However, compared to natural and synthetic hormones, bisphenols are much less potent, suggesting that they would pose lower health risks than hormones (Autrup et al., 2020).\nEDCs are present in the environment simultaneously, and their endocrine effects are most likely additive (Drakvik et al., 2020; Kase et al., 2018; Park et al., 2020). To assess the toxicity of chemical mixtures, the concentration addition (CA) model has commonly been used. The mathematical CA method was first described in 1926 by Loewe and Muischnek and it is useful to predict the combined effects of chemicals with the same mode of action (Loewe and Muischnek, 1926). It was shown that five commonly used pesticides act additively in vitro and their combined antiandrogenic effects follow the CA model (Birkh\u00f8j et al., 2004). In in vivo study, Brian et al. (2005) demonstrated that CA model correctly predicted the effects of a mixture of five estrogenic chemicals (estradiol (E2), EE2, nonylphenol, octylphenol, and bisphenol A (BPA)) on vitellogenin induction in fish (Brian et al., 2005). In another in vivo study on rats, a mixture of five phthalates reduced the testosterone production in a CA manner (Howdeshell et al., 2008). On the other hand, mixtures of chemicals with different modes of action are usually characterized by the independent action (IA) model (Cedergreen et al., 2008). However, it was shown that even binary and ternary mixtures of compounds with dissimilar modes of action induced triglyceride accumulation in a CA manner (Alarcan et al., 2022). In practice, CA model which generates more conservative predictions is usually the default recommended model for risk assessment (Cedergreen, 2014). In a recent review by Martin et al. (2021) it was concluded that CA concept appears to be suitable for most mixtures, but caution should be applied as some classes of chemicals exert non-additive, synergistic mixture effects. These are some combinations of pesticides, fungicides, and metal compounds. (Martin et al., 2021). However, synergism occurs rarely and usually at high concentrations (Cedergreen, 2014) and it is unlikely to be detected in environmental samples that contain many chemicals, often at low concentrations. Still, some studies found deviations from additivity for androgen antagonistic effects of parabens (Kjaerstad et al., 2010), though others did not (Ermler et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2021; Orton et al., 2014). In the study by Kjaerstad et al. (2010) where CA underestimated the mixture effects of parabens, equimolar mixture ratios were used although the individual parabens displayed different androgen antagonistic potencies. This could explain the deviation from additivity and a balanced mixture ratio design as it was used by Ermler et al. (2011) would be more suitable. A balanced design where compounds are combined at fixed equi-effective ratios, proportional to their individual active concentrations (e.g. their EC50s) is advantageous especially for mixtures of chemicals with a wide range of individual potencies, as the contribution of each compound would be evident (Evans et al., 2012). Such balanced design was used also by Silva et al. (2002) in a study of estrogenic effects of eight chemicals (including hydroxylated PCBs, parabens, bisphenol A, benzophenones, and genistein) where the mixture effects were correctly predicted by CA model (Silva et al., 2002). Mixtures of estrogenic chemicals and their CA predicted effects were studied also by Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mas\u030cic\u030c, however only for combinations of six bisphenols (Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mas\u030cic\u030c, 2020).\nThe present study consists of two parts. First, an environmental chemical analysis was performed on five samples from different Slovenian waters (two rivers, a groundwater and an influent and effluent wastewater). In these samples, we have performed an ultra-sensitive analysis of twenty-five endocrine disrupting compounds (Fig. 1), belonging to the groups of natural hormones, synthetic hormones, and\nbisphenols, which is the most comprehensive methodology for compounds with estrogenic activity to date. Furthermore, this method is uniquely sensitive to detect estrone (E1), E2, estriol (E3) and EE2 down to 0.03, 0,1, 0.02, and 0.02, ng/L, respectively, surpassing the detection limit goals set by EU Water FrameWork Directive Watchlist from 2018 (EC Decision, 2018/840). For the substances of interest, the number of studies found in literature, their array of analyte selection and the measured concentrations are considerably lower, in comparison with other, more researched substances (e.g., antibiotics) (Booth et al., 2020). Thorpe and coworkers studied E2, E1, EE2, and nonylphenol found in wastewater treatment plants effluents (Thorpe et al., 2006). Most of the studies of steroid hormones present in aquatic environment focus on E1, E2, E3, synthetic hormone EE2, and a few others (e.g. testosterone and progesterone) (Go\u0301mez et al., 2021; Gonza\u0301lez et al., 2020; Harraka et al., 2021; Praveena et al., 2016; Thorpe et al., 2006). However, many other steroid substances were detected in the environment (Grobin et al., 2022a; Ojoghoro et al., 2021; Pironti et al., 2021).\nIn the second part, the same samples and the chosen analytes were studied for their estrogenic agonist potencies. Estrogenic effects of many bisphenols and hormones are already known, but various assays are used for the determination of their potencies. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has fully validated the stably transfected transactivation (TA) assay using the ER\u03b1-HeLa-9903 cell line for the determination of human estrogen receptor alpha (hER\u03b1) agonists and antagonists (OECD, 2016). The aforementioned assay, described in the Test Guideline (TG) 455, was used in the present study.\nIn the group of natural steroid hormones of our interest for the present study are estrogens E1, E2, and E3, androgen hormone testosterone, progesterone which binds to progesterone nuclear receptor, and corticosterone, a glucocorticosteroid produced in the adrenal cortex. The synthetic hormones which were included in our study are mainly used as contraceptives or in hormone therapy. 17\u03b1-Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen and is often used in combination with other drugs (e.g., norethindrone, drospirenone, dienogest) (Casey and Murray, 2008; Machado et al., 2011; Pe\u0301rez-Campos, 2010). Norethindrone, levonorgestrel, gestodene, drospirenone, dienogest, and chlormadinone acetate (CMA) are synthetic progestogens that exert their effects via binding to progesterone receptors (Regidor, 2019). In addition to progestogenic activity, levonorgestrel binds also to androgen receptor (Vrettakos and Bajaj, 2022) and gestodene possesses weak androgenic, weak antimineralocorticoid and weak glucocorticoid activity (Fuhrmann et al., 1995). Dienogest and CMA show antiandrogenic properties besides progestogenic activity (Raudrant and Rabe, 2003). Tibolone binds as an agonist primarily to estrogen receptors, with a preference for ER\u03b1. Additionally, it displays androgenic and progestogenic properties (Karsdal et al., 2008). Cyproterone is an antiandrogen that suppresses the actions of testosterone. It blocks androgen receptors, and its acetate form is used in the treatment of hypersexuality in males, treatment of prostate cancer (Goldenberg and Bruchovsky, 1991; Neumann and Kalmus, 1991), and, in combination with estrogen, for the therapy of hyperandrogenism (e.g. severe acne and hirsutism) in females (van der Spuy et al., 2003).\nBesides binding to their target receptors, some hormones also crossreact with other steroid receptors, such as testosterone which binds with low affinity to progesterone and estrogen receptor (Gao et al., 2005), and norethindrone that shows also estrogenic and androgenic effects (Onobrakpeya et al., 2001). Levonorgestrel and gestodene also induce estrogenic effects through their metabolites (Garc\u00eda-Becerra et al., 2002; Lemus et al., 2000; Santilla\u0301n et al., 2001), while drospirenone and cyproterone show no estrogen activity (Kuhl, 2005; Machado et al., 2011). Bisphenols on the other hand, are used as dye developers and in the production of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins and coating products, therefore, personal care products, textiles, food and beverages are all sources for human exposure (Durcik et al., 2022).\nTable 1 provides a list of monitored compounds and their estrogenic activities reported in the ToxCast database. No activities were reported\nM. Durcik et al.\nChemosphere 330 (2023) 138712\nin the database for drospirenone, dienogest, cyproterone, and bisphenol G. In this study, hER\u03b1 agonistic potencies for these compounds were determined using the validated OECD test guideline (TG) 455. We investigated the effects of their mixtures on estrogenic agonist potency using a balanced mixture ratio and in unbalanced combinations proportional to the concentrations measured in the environmental samples. The in vitro data obtained were then compared with the predictions of the model CA. Mixtures of compounds equal to their NOEC were also prepared and tested for their potential estrogenic potency."

The two river water samples (A and B) showed the presence of natural hormones E1, E2, E3, and progesterone in concentrations up to 5.8 ng/L, and the synthetic hormones EE2, norethindrone, drospirenone, and CMA in concentrations up to 20 ng/L (Table 3). Among bisphenols, the major contaminant in river water samples was BPS, exceeding the BPA by a factor of 20. BPS was also present in every sample taken in this campaign, and the same applies to drospirenone. On the other hand, regarding BPS, the opposite is true in case of the groundwater (sample C) which contained a surprisingly high concentration of BPA: more than 6000 ng/L which is even higher than both of the wastewater samples; the groundwater sample C also contained all the other monitored bisphenols as well (Table 3). Additionally, natural and synthetic hormones were in groundwater in the same concentration ranges as in the river water samples with the exception of EE2 and CMA, which were not detected. The influent and effluent wastewater samples (D and E) contained as expected several tens to several hundred-fold higher concentrations of pollutants compared to river and groundwater samples. All the monitored analytes were present there except E2, levonorgestrel, BPAF, and BPC. The significantly lower concentrations of E1, E3, testosterone, tibolone, and all the bisphenols in effluent samples points to their significant and efficient removal during the treatment process.

To investigate the estrogenic agonist potency of the mixtures of compounds detected in Slovenian water samples, we first collected and tested the estrogenic agonist potency of all 25 compounds in the OECD-validated transactivation assay on the Hela 9903 cell line. All 10 bisphenols tested were the subject of our previous research (Durcik et al., 2022; Gramec Skledar et al., 2019; Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mas\u030cic\u030c, 2020), and their estrogenic agonist activity was previously determined in our laboratory using the same protocol; their potencies are summarized in Table 4.\nPrior to testing natural and synthetic hormones\u2019 estrogenic agonist potencies, we tested their influence on cell viability at 10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM concentration (additionally at 75 \u03bcM for testosterone, progesterone, cyproterone, dienogest and CMA) using resazurin assay. Due to solubility issues, higher concentrations were not used in cytotoxicity and transactivation assays. None of the compounds were considered\ncytotoxic as they did not significantly reduce cell viability by more than 20% (Supporting information, Fig. S2), which is the limit defined in the OECD protocol.\nWe then tested their estrogenic agonist potency on Hela 9903 cells using the reference compound E2 as a strong estrogenic agonist. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 5. Our measurements of estrogenic potencies for individual compounds show the strongest low picomolar (EC50, 11 pM) agonistic activity for estradiol (E2), followed by E3, and E1, the latter with 6 nM agonistic activity. Among synthetic hormones, EE2 displayed similar picomolar (EC50, 12 pM) estrogenic activity to E2. Agonist activity of norethindrone and tibolone was in the nanomolar range, 10-fold weaker activity was measured for levonorgestrel and gestodene, dienogest showed an EC50 value of 2 \u03bcM and the weakest, 48 \u03bcM activity was obtained for chlormadinone acetate.

On the other hand, drospirenone displayed 37% effect relative to the E2 maximum, enabling us to calculate at least its PC10 value.\nThe results clearly show that estrogen agonists have different effects due to the chemical structures of the hormones. Two hydroxyl groups of estradiol in positions 3 (A-ring) and 17 (D-ring) (the numbering is shown in Fig. 1 for E2) are required for strong potency, which is also true for EE2, which contains the same hydroxyl groups. Thereafter, the potency decreases for E3 with three hydroxyl functional groups and becomes even weaker for compounds with only one hydroxyl group. Compounds without hydroxyl groups do not exhibit estrogenic agonist potency. In general, two hydroxyl groups properly spaced and linked by a lipophilic scaffold are required for estrogen agonistic potency (Paterni et al., 2014), a characteristic also matched by bisphenols."

In addition, we prepared simulated samples AS-ES, where we combined for each sample AS-ES the compounds that we detected at the same concentration as in the real water samples A-E (Table 3). The simulated samples AS-ES were also tested in the resazurin reduction assay and the transactivation assay (Fig. 4). None of the real water A-E or simulated AS-ES samples exhibited cytotoxicity (Fig. 3a and 4a). In real water samples A-E the internal standard (IS) was added as it is needed to compensate for possible changes in the method (e.g. instrument response) for quantification of samples and the same samples were used for biological testing. When tested individually at its 100 \u00d7 concentration, IS showed 66% estrogen activity relative to positive control. The interpretation of biological results of water samples A-E should take into consideration the added IS. Among the compounds present in IS, the most potent estrogen agonists are E2 (EC50 = 11 pM) and EE2 (EC50 = 12 pM), added at concentrations of 7.3 and 6.7 pM, respectively; all other IS compounds have lower potency compared to their concentrations present in IS. In the water samples A-E, EE2 was detected only in sample B, and E2 was detected in samples B and C, and at lower concentrations compared to IS (Table 3). This means that the addition of IS may have possibly contributed to the measured activity of samples A-E, however, when comparing the results (Fig. 3), it is clear that the estrogenic activities of samples A-E significantly differ from that of the IS; furthermore, the activities also significantly differ among the water samples A-E. This observation indicates, that the contribution of IS has insignificant effect to the overall measured estrogenic activity even at 100 \u00d7 concentration., We can conclude that the estrogenic\npotency of the real water samples at their 100 \u00d7 concentration is much more influenced by the concomitant compounds present in the real water samples, which could even act as estrogenic antagonists, showing\nna, not applicable; NA, not active \u2013 no dose response curve was obtained, EC50 > 50 \u03bcM; ND, not determined (low potency and incomplete dose-response curve, so EC50 and PC50 could not be determined); nt, not tested \u2013 not active based on screening at 10 and 50 \u03bcM with <0.1% of maximal estrogenic activity induced by 1 nM E2; PC10, concentration of the test compound for 10% maximum activity of the positive control (1 nM E2); PC50, concentration of the test compound for 50% maximum activity of the positive control; EC50, half maximal effective concentration of test compound; Max. versus E2 max., test compound maximum level of response (%) relative to induced response by 1 nM E2 on the same plate.\nM.

Only samples A, B, and D at 100 \u00d7 concentration show estrogenic activity above 10% activity of the positive control (E2), but below 50% relative to E2. As expected, estrogenic agonistic potencies were lower for samples at 1 \u00d7 concentration than at 100 \u00d7 concentration. At the 1 \u00d7 concentration, samples A and E showed the only significant potency (Fig. 3b). From the figure of simulated samples AS-ES (Fig. 4b), it can be seen that sample DS shows the highest estrogenic potency, which is to be expected since it is a simulation of the wastewater sample from the Ljubljana WWTP and the concentrations of bisphenols and hormones detected in this sample were by far the highest of all samples, with the exception of BPA, which was found in higher concentration in sample C. However, compared to natural and some synthetic hormones, bisphenols are much less potent (Tables 4 and 5) and their relative effect potencies are lower (Supporting information, Table S1). Therefore, bisphenols are unlikely to have such a significant contribution to potency and high concentrations of hormones are probably the reason for the highest potency of sample DS as seen from their calculated contributions (Supporting information, Table S1). Other simulated samples showed comparable results, BS and ES showed weak estrogenic potency (>10% estrogenic activity of the positive control), while AS and CS were just below the 10% limit (Fig. 4b)."

We prepared a mixture of the eleven compounds (out of 25 monitored) measured in the real water sample D and tested them in fixed equi-effective ratios (mixture DE); proportional to the EC50 values of each analyte to ensure a\nbalanced contribution of each compound to the overall potency of the mixture (Fig. 5aa). Two additional chemicals were detected in sample D, drospirenone and progesterone, however as they showed low or no estrogenic activity when tested individually (Fig. 2) and we couldn\u2019t obtain their EC50 values, these two compounds were excluded from the experiment. The included chemicals were therefore E1, E3, testosterone, norethindrone, tibolone, gestodene, CMA, BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPE. Obtained EC50 value for DE mixture was 3.93 \u03bcM which is in close agreement with the predicted CA EC50 value (4.29 \u03bcM; Supporting information, Table S2). The MDR value, which evaluates the accuracy of the model, was 1.09 indicating high probability of additive interactions, therefore we can confirm that mixture effect follows the concentration addition model. The predicted CA EC50 values were calculated also for equi-effective mixtures of compounds found in water samples AE-CE and EE and were all in the low micromolar range (Supporting information, Fig. S3a, Table S2).\nWe then examined the mixture of chemicals found in sample D using the unbalanced mixture design (Fig. 5b). Here, the compounds were combined proportionally to their measured concentrations in the real water sample D, therefore same as in simulated samples (Table 3). The EC50 value obtained for this mixture (DS) was 2.8 nM (Supporting information, Table S3). The EC50 value predicted by the CA model was lower at 1.7 nM, but was in the same low nanomolar range. The MDR value, which evaluates the accuracy of the model, was low at 0.61. It is in the range indicating the probability of additive interactions (0.5\u20132), but indicates an overestimation of the model. Similar to the above experiment, the CA model was also applied to other samples with different combinations and concentrations of chemicals (Supporting information, Fig. S3b, Table S3). The highest estrogenic potency was predicted for the sample AS with the lowest number of chemicals, a 10-\nM. Durcik et al.\nChemosphere 330 (2023) 138712\nfold lower potency was predicted for BS and DS, a 10-fold lower for ES, and another 10-fold lower for CS with the highest number of chemicals in the mixture. If we extrapolate the results for sample D to other samples, we could assume that the predicted EC50 values may be overestimated. The model CA depends on the proportions of the compounds in the sample. The sample AS contains only 6 compounds, but for this reason their proportions in the mixture are higher, resulting in the lower predicted EC50 value (Supporting information, Fig. S3b, Table S3)."

For bisphenols, all six bisphenols studied were measured in the water samples.\nMany studies on estrogens in surface water and wastewater focus on E1, E2, and EE2, which are included in the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring list for substances in surface waters (Carere et al., 2016; OJ L 78, March 24, 2015, p. 40\u201342; OJ L 226, August 24, 2013, p. 1\u201317). Among synthetic hormones, ethinylestradiol (EE2) is one of the most commonly prescribed hormonal drugs. Although used doses of EE2 in medicines are low, due to its very high potency (Runnalls et al., 2010), the common use of EE2 and its metabolites in the environment has resulted in significant environmental pollution and adds to the total estrogenic load of waterways (Abibu et al., 2021; Klaic and Jirsa, 20222; Thorpe et al., 2003). Our data show higher concentrations of E1 in environmental waters compared to E2 and EE2 (Table 3), which is expected since E1 is the transformation product of the other two. For E1, our highest measured concentration in surface waters was 5.8 ng/L (sample A, Table 3), similar to the concentrations measured in a study of European waters from Central and Southern Europe countries (Kase et al., 2018; Ko\u0308nemann et al., 2018). However, in the WWTP wastewater, the concentration of E1 (44 ng/L, sample E, Table 3) exceeds the values measured in wastewaters in the studies by Kase et al. and Ko\u0308nemann et al. by a factor of two, indicating a higher load. Concentrations of E2 are in a similar range to published concentrations in surface waters, while we were unable to detect it in wastewater (Sample E, Table 3). Similarly, EE2 was not detected in wastewater sample E, while maximum measured concentrations in European wastewaters for E2 and EE2 were 1.1 ng/L and 7.5 ng/L, respectively (Kase et al., 2018; Ko\u0308nemann et al., 2018). On the other hand, our measurement of EE2 in surface water (sample B, 0.9 ng/L, Table 3) shows that the environmental load of this compound is greater here than in other European waters from the above studies and the measured concentration is nine times higher than the predicted no-effect concentration for aquatic life (0.1 ng/L; Stewart et al., 2023). EE2 is of particular concern because it is extremely potent in vivo and in addition, it is resistant to degradation and accumulates in sediment and biota (Aris et al., 2014; Rand-Weaver et al., 2013). By measuring vitellogenin induction in fish, it was shown that in vivo it is much more potent than E2 (Thorpe et al., 2003). It also disrupts craniofacial development of zebrafish at environmentally relevant concentrations (Stewart et al., 2023). Of the other synthetic hormones, we detected drospirenone in all samples, while CMA was not found in samples A and C, but was detected at higher concentrations in both wastewater samples (D and E, Table 3). In the last decade, by far the most frequently prescribed contraceptive medicines in Slovenia were those containing a combination of\nM. Durcik et al.\nChemosphere 330 (2023) 138712\ndrospirenone and EE2, which could be the reason for the presence of drospirenone in all samples (NIPH Slovenia), and the presence of EE2 in surface water sample B, whose concentration of 0.88 ng/L was significantly above the European water quality standard currently set at 0.035 ng/L, and which is expected to be even lowered to 0.017 ng/L (SCHEER).\nBisphenol BPA is widely used worldwide and is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. However, in 2017, it was added to the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and is being replaced by structural analogs due to its harmful effects on humans. The most commonly used substitutes for BPA include BPS and BPF, and due to their massive use, all three are widely distributed in environmental samples. (Chen et al., 2016; Lehmler et al., 2018). As expected, our results also show that BPA, BPS, and BPF were present in most or all samples. BPA and BPS were detected in the highest concentrations, followed by BPF (Table 3). Unsurprisingly, the highest concentrations of contaminants were measured in the WWTP influent (Sample D), and as expected, concentrations of the aforementioned chemicals were lower in the WWTP effluent (Sample E).\nThe analytical results of the environmental study showed unexpectedly high contamination of groundwater with EDCs. High concentrations of E1, E2, E3, and several bisphenols were detected in the groundwater sample (C, Table 3), which were comparable to and even exceeded the levels of these compounds in surface water or wastewater influent (D), as in the case of BPA, BPAF, and BPC. The measured BPA concentration in sample C (6551 ng/L, which equals to 28.73 nM) exceeded recently reported BPA concentrations found in groundwater monitoring wells near municipal solid waste landfills several times over (Kotowska et al., 2019). The speculation about the possible sources of such a high measured BPA concentration in groundwater is as difficult to make as it is alarming. In our other groundwater sampling campaigns (data not shown here), we have also observed high fluctuations in multiple EDC concentration levels, even when the samples were taken at the same sites but from different depths, which points to a high variability in groundwater EDC-burden. Nevertheless, even with such a high concentration of the found BPA, based on our current knowledge (considering the PC10 for BPA is 120 nM), the imposed estrogenic activity risk solely from BPA seems to be low. However, combination effects, especially with more potent EDCs, such as E1, E2 and EE2, the contribution of BPA, together with its emerging substitutes, to the\ncumulative estrogenic activity cannot be neglected. Another important observation was the high concentration of natural estrogen compounds in surface and groundwater: E1 (6 ng/L), E2 (up to 0.25 ng/L), E3 (up to 2.4 ng/L), approaching the environmental quality standards for freshwater for E1 (3.6 ng/L) and E2 (0.4 ng/L), which are likely to be even lowered as foreseen by the new SCHEER draft proposal for 2022 under the EU Water Framework Directive (SCHEER). Our findings of the high concentrations and variety of contaminants present, particularly in groundwater, underscore the importance of monitoring them and also highlight the relevance of knowing what these compounds can do in combination in target organisms.\nThe results of in vitro determination of estrogenic potency of each natural hormone ranged from low picomolar to low nanomolar potencies, with E2, which is also a positive control in the OECD assay used, being the most potent. The estrogenic potencies of the other natural hormones were in the following order: E2 > E3 > E1, each tenfold weaker than the previous, while progesterone and corticosterone showed no activity in this assay. A similar picomolar estrogenic potency as E2 was also shown by EE2. Ihara and coworkers (2014) demonstrated a similar order and potencies for E1, E2, and E3, however EE2 was tenfold weaker than E2 and fell in the same activity range as E3 in that study (Ihara et al., 2014). The EC50 values of other synthetic hormones ranged from the low nanomolar to the micromolar range in the following order: tibolone, norethindrone > gestodene, levonorgestrel > dienogest > CMA, with no significant activity measured for drospirenone and cyproterone. In general, the estrogenic potencies determined here correlate well with the available data in the ToxCast database (Table 1).\nOf the real water samples (A-E, Fig. 3b), sample C, a heavily contaminated sample with the highest BPA concentration of all water samples, showed no estrogen agonistic potency in the in vitro test. Water sample D, which came from a wastewater treatment plant, also showed very low potency. Such results of a real water samples regarding estrogen agonist potency could be expected, since the samples are complex real mixtures containing numerous other chemicals and contaminants in the water in addition to the tested analytes. The other unknown constituents of these mixtures could affect measurements of hER\u03b1 activity and also act as estrogen receptor antagonists that compete with our analytes for binding and consequently interfere with the estrogenic response. On the other hand, the results of the screening of less complex,\nM. Durcik et al.\nChemosphere 330 (2023) 138712\npure simulated samples AS-ES (Fig. 4b), which contained only the analytes studied, were logical, with the simulation of the wastewater treatment plant influent (DS) showing the highest estrogen agonist potency. The concentrations of analytes in this sample are considerably higher compared to the other samples, so such a result is to be expected. We can confirm here the concentration addition model for mixture DE at balanced equi-effective concentrations. When testing mixture DS with components in proportion to real sample concentrations of monitored analytes (non-balanced design), the effect could not be absolutely confirmed with the CA concept, as the low MDR value suggests an overestimation of the model. The experimental (DS, EC50 = 2.8 nM) and predicted EC50 values were much lower here for all samples, being in the low and even sub-nanomolar area (Supporting information, Fig. S3b, Table S3). However, such data should not be considered as the real prediction of toxicity as only the studied analytes are included in these simulated samples. In reality, the ratios between compounds, which is an important factor in the CA model, could be much different due to the presence of other compounds. As mentioned above, these other contaminants could also interfere with the estrogenic response. For our experiment with compounds of various EC50 values, the balanced mixture design was probably more suitable for predicting mixture effects with the CA model. Here compounds were combined in proportion to their EC50 values for a balanced contribution of each chemical to the mixture effect.\nIn vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mixtures of chemicals, with each chemical present at its sub-effective concentration, can still induce endocrine activity (Silva et al., 2002; Gramec Skledar and Peterlin Mas\u030cic\u030c, 2020; Tinwell and Ashby, 2004). Thrupp et al. (2018) studied the in vivo effects of five synthetic steroidal pharmaceuticals (EE2, trenbolone, beclomethasone dipropionate, desogestrel and levonorgestrel) on egg production in fish. They found that a mixture of these chemicals had a significant effect at their NOEC levels, suppressing egg production by over 50%. The effect \u201csomething from \u2018nothing\u2019\u201d was clearly demonstrated here (Thrupp et al., 2018).\nHowever, our experiment with mixtures of chemicals found in the six samples at their no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) in three samples did not produce such significant results. Nevertheless, the mixture D (mixture of chemicals found in sample D, at their NOECs) showed a clear difference compared to individual compounds and displayed noteworthy estrogenic activity (~12% of the maximal estrogenic effect, Fig. 6), above the 10% limit for estrogen agonists. It was followed by mixture E, being just below the limit with ~9% of the maximal estrogenic effect. The CA model did not successfully predict these results as with this method, for D and E almost no estrogenic activity was predicted.\nUnlike other studies that examined mixtures with fewer components, here we tested mixtures of several estrogenic chemicals (from 6 to 14) that belong to two structural classes (steroid scaffold hormones and bisphenols). We attempted to apply the concentration addition model to evaluate the toxicity of these mixtures. For this purpose, the estrogenic activities of each compound had to be determined, since the known effects of each component are required for the calculations of CA. Our data show that the toxicity predictions of CA depend on the number of chemicals in the combination, their concentrations, and thus their proportions in the mixture. In addition, the calculations depend on the potencies of the compounds, which in our case fell within a wide concentration range (from EC50 of 11 pM (E2) to 48 \u03bcM (CMA)), requiring careful mixture design. Mixtures synthesized in the laboratory that simulate mixture combinations of real water samples can be adequately characterized with the used in vitro assay and CA model. We were also able to assess real environmental samples with the cell-based assay and detect their basic estrogenic activities. However, the real mixtures contain an unknown number of other, unmonitored compounds at unknown concentrations that may interfere with the assay and also affect the calculations and CA model predictions. This indicates that the characterization of complex real samples with respect to individual\nestrogenic agonists and antagonists is more challenging. Still, simple bioassays, such as the used hER\u03b1-Hela-9903, a combination of bioassays or more complex models, such as vitellogenin mRNA expression in fish embryos or other in vivo models (Chen et al., 2018) are useful to screen environmental samples as a whole and assess their overall estrogenicity, prior to further advanced analyses."

Eighteen of 25 hormones and bisphenols studied were measured in water samples at quantifiable concentrations, and their estrogenic activities have been described here. Evaluation of the effects of mixtures on the hER\u03b1 receptor illustrates the importance, but also the complexity, of predicting the toxicity of mixtures. The CA model accurately predicted the effect of a balanced equally potent mixture, and our data show the difference between two mixture designs.\nCredit author statement\nMartina Durcik: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.
