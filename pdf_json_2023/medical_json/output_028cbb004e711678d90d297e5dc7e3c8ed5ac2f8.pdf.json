    "abstractText": "Background: Globally, occupational hazards are a concern, especially in waste management. With 31.2% of its population in urban areas, India is confronted with escalating waste management challenges. People worldwide generate about two-thirds of a kilogram of waste daily. Effective solid waste management is crucial due to population growth, changing waste patterns, and rapid urbanisation. It profoundly impacts environmental, resident, and worker health. Rag picking is an informal profession undertaken by a marginalised population of the society, which involves collecting waste from trash cans, streets, and household waste. To assess the burden and the pattern of morbidity, and the occupational factors associated with it, as well as their health-seeking behaviour, the present study was carried out among women rag pickers in Mumbai, India. Methodology: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted through a mixed-method approach in Mumbai's Chembur and Govandi areas, focusing on women rag pickers aged 15 to 49 years. The research was conducted over a period of three months, during which a total of 150 female rag pickers from individual families were identified and included in the study through purposive sampling. The structured questionnaires gathered quantitative data on socio-demographics, health-seeking behaviour, morbidity, and monthly expenses. The qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions with rag pickers, analysing themes related to rag picking as occupational preference and substance usage factors. Ethical approval from the institute and informed consent from each participant were obtained prior to data collection. Results: Among the cohort of 150 women rag pickers, 67.3% were aged between 15 and 30 years, with 82% belonging to the lower socio-economic class. A notable 43.4% of these women engaged in significant tobacco use, primarily through oral consumption, while about 56.7% of their family members exhibited high substance use, including pan, tobacco, and alcohol. In terms of health-seeking behaviour, 51% refrained from seeking treatment for minor ailments, 29% resorted to home remedies or self-medication, and 20% sought care at hospitals. A morbidity analysis over the past three months revealed prevalent health issues, informing potential interventions. Examination of monthly expenditure patterns unveiled an average income of 9000 INR (130 USD), with a significant 61% allocation towards food and grocery expenses. Qualitative insights indicated that the preference for rag picking was driven by limited alternatives and substance use was influenced by peers and served as a means to cope with stress. These findings underscore distinct health-seeking behaviours, and the unique needs of women rag pickers, providing valuable guidance for targeted policies to enhance their well-being. Conclusion: These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve the well-being and socio-economic conditions of women rag pickers in India. Universal healthcare coverage, community-based initiatives, and social inclusion are vital for addressing their unique challenges and enhancing their quality of life.

India produces 12 million tons of inert waste from street sweeping and construction and demolition (C&D) annually, which makes up about one-third of municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills [1]. Municipal bodies in India, according to estimates, can only collect 70-80% of the country's daily average of 62 million tons of waste [2]. On a worldwide scale, each person generates roughly two-thirds of a kilogram of waste per day. The solid waste management system is\nHow to cite this article Iyer S, Shah H, Patel J, et al.

Cureus 15(10): e47464. DOI 10.7759/cureus.47464\ncrucial because of high population growth, rapidly changing waste characterisation and generation patterns, and expanding urbanisation and industrialisation in developing countries [2,3].\nManagement processes of solid waste not only have an impact on environmental health and the inhabitants\u2019 health but the health of those directly involved in the processes. Rag picking, also known as waste picking or scavenging, is the practice of collecting and sorting recyclable materials from trash cans, streets, and household waste. Rag pickers engage in the random sorting and collection of refuse, then vending their findings to scrap merchants in exchange for monetary compensation, which depends upon the weight and categorisation of the waste materials [4]. Despite the significance of rag picking in terms of resource recovery and waste management, it is predominantly undertaken by underprivileged people, namely, women, due to the limited availability of alternative employment options [5].\nRag pickers are members of a very vulnerable group who are exploited by both fate and society [6]. Waste pickers are engaged in informal employment within the unregulated sector, which poses challenges in accurately quantifying the amount of waste they collect. When using the disposal site, they risk coming across a lot of plastic and iron items, as well as needles, syringes, used condoms, saline bottles, unclean gloves, and other hospital garbage. Therefore, the rag pickers are prone to various diseases and health hazards, owing to their occupation, such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, dysentery, parasites, and malnutrition [7].\nTo assess the burden and the pattern of morbidity, and the occupational factors associated with it, as well as their health-seeking behaviour, the present study was carried out among women rag pickers in Mumbai, India."

Rag picking was preferred over working for others, as it allowed for self-employment and independence. Furthermore, the findings indicated that rag-picking often emerged as a byproduct of the prevailing social exclusion system, rather than as a first-choice occupation.\n\"In the absence of formal education, we sought various job opportunities. Those who found something better moved on, but we have settled here. We work in people's homes, which often results in challenges, such as accusations of theft or getting mistreated.\"\n\"We do this work independently, on my own schedule. There is no external pressure. If we don't want to work on a particular day, we don't. The income in this profession may be limited, but it brings peace. If another job opportunity comes along, we would take it, but they are hard to come by.

The findings shed light on important socio-demographic features, health-seeking behaviour, morbidity status, monthly expenses, and qualitative insights into the reasons for their occupational preference and addiction [8]. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies to address the challenges faced by this vulnerable population.\nRegarding the socio-demographic features, it was observed that a significant proportion of women rag pickers belonged to the lower socio-economic class, highlighting their economic disadvantage [8]. However,\n2023 Iyer et al. Cureus 15(10): e47464. DOI 10.7759/cureus.47464 5 of 8\na positive trend was observed in healthcare utilisation, with a majority of the women reporting giving childbirth at healthcare facilities, indicating improved access to formal maternal care services. Tobacco addiction was found to be prevalent among women rag pickers, primarily in the form of oral consumption [3]. Additionally, the study revealed that these women carried a heavy responsibility as they supported an average of five dependent family members. Substance addiction was also found to be common among the family members of rag pickers, further underscoring the complex challenges faced by this population. This is similar to other studies conducted in the various demographics of metropolitan cities in India [4,9,10]. Furthermore, a low level of educational attainment was observed among women rag pickers, with one-third having attained only primary education.\nThe findings related to health-seeking behaviour highlighted that a considerable proportion (51%) of participants did not seek treatment for minor ailments or unless there was an emergency. Home remedies were commonly used by a significant portion (29%) of the participants as a routine approach for addressing health concerns. On the other hand, a number of participants (20%) relied on government or private hospitals when they fell ill.\nThese patterns indicate the need to promote regular healthcare-seeking behaviour among women rag pickers, especially for non-emergency situations, and to improve access to primary healthcare services. The existing structure of the National Health Mission covered the urban slum areas with extended services through urban primary health centres and urban Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). However, there is no visible specific strategy for community mobilisation for marginalised populations to address the social determinants of health and to link them to primary care services.\nThe assessment of morbidity status provided valuable insights into the prevalence and types of health conditions encountered by the study participants. This information is crucial for understanding the burden of morbidity and tailoring healthcare interventions to address their specific health needs. Similar types of signs and symptoms were observed in several studies that highlight the issue to address and consider this vulnerable group to cover under comprehensive primary health care [4-6,11,12]. There were several studies indicating the need to address their health needs due to psychological vulnerability due to their work environment and financial constraints. This highlights the need for targeted mental health interventions. These groups of population may serve as vehicles for the transmission of certain pathogens that degrade waste, thereby, constituting some public health hazards. Understanding their health practices is crucial for their well-being and broader public health and creating a structure to make regular health check-up systems through the urban health centres [13,14].\nThe study delved into the income and spending patterns of women engaged in rag picking. On average, they earned approximately 9000 INR (equivalent to 130 USD) each month, with a significant portion, around 61%, allocated for food expenses. Interestingly, health care was not a top priority for these women, as reflected in their limited medical expenditures. These findings underscore the financial challenges these women encounter and emphasise the importance of ensuring their access to affordable healthcare services related to their occupational health hazards [8,10,15].\nQualitative interviews revealed several factors influencing the preference for rag picking as an occupation and the reasons for substance usage among participants. Concerns about risks associated with other opportunities, such as domestic help, influenced their preference for self-employment. Numerous studies have consistently echoed these findings, emphasizing that the preference for rag-picking often arises due to limited alternative job opportunities within the context of social exclusion. The role of peer influence in driving personal substance use, along with the utilisation of substances as a coping mechanism, has been a recurrent theme among the participants [8,16].\nThe work done by waste pickers often goes unnoticed, but they play an important role in society by saving money on waste collection and disposal. Many studies have tried to figure out how much money the informal waste sector contributes to the economy - it is a lot, billions of dollars each year. A closer look by Medina shows that waste pickers actually help society in positive ways, and with some help, they could do even more [17]. Plus, waste picking also helps save money by making waste management and disposal cheaper. Further detailed studies on their hygiene practices, non-use of protective equipment, inhuman living conditions, and level of health awareness will provide a critical understanding while making social and health interventions to recognise their contribution to our health environment."

These findings contributed to the existing knowledge and can support in development of targeted interventions aimed at improving the well-being and socio-economic conditions of women rag pickers. The universal coverage of health programs, provision, and inclusion of this vulnerable group for health awareness to ensure right health-seeking behaviour and accessible community-based social interventions should be focused to ensure the well-being and betterment of women rag pickers in India.\nAdditional Information"
