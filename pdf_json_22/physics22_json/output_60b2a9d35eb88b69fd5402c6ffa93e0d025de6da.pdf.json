    "abstractText": "Solar cells based on lead-free perovskite have demonstrated great potential for nextgeneration renewable energy. The SCAPS-1D simulation software was used in this study to perform novel device modelling of a lead-free perovskite solar cell of the architecture ITO/WS2/CH3NH3SnI3 /P3HT/Au. For the performance evaluation, an optimization process of the different parameters such as thickness, bandgap, doping concentration, etc., was conducted. Extensive optimization of the thickness and doping density of the absorber and electron transport layer resulted in a maximum power-conversion efficiency of 33.46% for our designed solar cell. Because of the short diffusion length and higher defect density in thicker perovskite, an absorber thickness of 1.2 \u03bcm is recommended for optimal solar cell performance. Therefore, we expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of lead-free and highly effective perovskite solar cells.",

            "text": "A photovoltaic solar cell is a promising renewable and non-polluted source of energy [1]. In terms of research and development, halide-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the fastest growing photovoltaic technology [2\u20134]. The first potential report of halide-based perovskite solar cells appeared in 2009. In such studies, organic\u2212inorganic (CH3NH3PbI3) hybrid perovskite has been used as a light-sensitizer in a dye-sensitized solar cell and a power conversion efficiency of 3.8% has been achieved. The ability of halide perovskites to operate not only as powerful light absorbers but also as efficient electron and hole conductors was demonstrated in the literature [5\u20137] with power conversion efficiencies of 10.9% and 9.7%, respectively. These findings led to the start of a global effort to improve perovskite cell efficiency beyond 20%. The Pb-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained a lot of potential over silicon-based solar cells due to their ease of fabrication and low cost. Lead-based halide perovskite also exhibits several desirable optoelectronic properties such as a high absorption coefficient, a comparatively moderate bandgap, and a high charge diffusion length [7\u20139].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2201. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13122201 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2201 2 of 13\nConsidering these great advances towards high performance, the toxicity and lack of stability of the absorber layer in lead-based PSCs remains a serious problem for their widespread commercialization [10\u201312]. One potential way to address these concerns is to replace the hazardous toxic lead in the PSC\u2019s CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer with a suitable non-toxic element. The methylammonium tin iodide CH3NH3SnI3 has, amongst others, become a viable alternative due to its eco-friendliness, as well as its smaller effective mass of holes [13], excellent mobility [14], narrower bandgap, and wider visible absorption spectrum [15]. The study of the characteristics of perovskite solar cell materials, as well as their control through accurate modelling, can lead to the production of efficient and cost-effective solar cells [16,17]. To build cost-effective, efficient, and lead-free PSCs, the electrical and optical properties of CH3NH3SnI3 must be explored using modelling before dealing with very complex fabrication processes. The main objective of this research is to design lead-free PSCs with an improved efficiency. In this study, we have used a solar cell capacitance simulator in one dimension (SCAPS-1D) program. To get the highest feasible PCE, different aspects were optimized. Initially, we have calibrated the device structure with previously reported experimental work [18]. Then, an investigation of the proposed device structure ITO/WS2/CH3NH3SnI3/P3HT/Au has been performed. There has been a lot of interest in WS2 as ETL due to its potential as an electron transport layer in thin film solar cells [19]. It is easily available at a low cost and is less hazardous than other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) compounds. The development of WS2 in thin film solar cells is still in its infancy compared with other photovoltaic materials [20]. Due to its superior optoelectronic properties, tungsten disulfide (WS2) has become the primary material for thin film solar cells. Its tunable bandgap is an essential feature that is usually ignored. WS2 has a large direct bandgap (>2 eV) and a small indirect bandgap (~1.3 eV) [20\u201322]. Furthermore, it exhibits high carrier mobility, good conductivity, native n-type semiconducting characteristics [23], and excellent electron conduction properties [24]. Moreover, it can be deposited through a solution process or by sputtering at low temperature [25]. Homo-polymer poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an HTL is one of the few viable choices for commercial Organic Photovoltaic (OPV). Its application in large-area, roll-to-roll printed solar cells has already been amply shown [26,27]. Additionally, the semi-crystalline structure of P3HT, in contrast to more amorphous polymers, is nearly unique in setting an acceptable morphological length-scale for bulk heterojunction OPV from a variety of solvents and processing conditions, as well as giving it outstanding charge transport properties [28,29]. P3HT has attracted great interest as a polymeric hole-selective material for perovskite solar cells due to its low cost [30], wide band-gap [31], relatively high hole mobility [32], high thermal stability [33], scalable solution processability [34], robust hydrophobicity, and oxygen impermeability [35]. An analysis of the impact of CH3NH3SnI3 as an absorber layer with different thicknesses and bandgap is performed. After this, the impact of ETL (WS2) with varying thicknesses and doping concentrations on the performance of PSCs has been investigated. At the end of this simulation analysis, the optimized device structure with the highest efficiency of 33.36% is obtained."

In this device design, ITO serves as an electron transport layer, which is covered by an N-type (WS2) material. The organic and inorganic intrinsic perovskite CH3NH3SnI3 serves as the absorber layer, while the p-type P3HT serves as the hole transporting layer on which the contact is formed.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2201 3 of 13Micromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 13\nFigure 1. Schematic device structure of perovskite solar cell.\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1. The Effect of the Thickness and Doping Concentration of the Absorber Layer\nThe impact of the active perovskite layer thickness on the efficiency of the solar device will be explored in this section. Absorber layers play a vital role in the improvement of the performance of the solar device [39,40]. All parameters, such as bandgap, thickness, and doping concertation, play an important role in optimizing performance. Figure 2 illustrates the variation of the electrical parameters with thickness, such as Voc Jsc and FF, \u03b7. The simulated outcome shows that solar cell parameters are highly dependent on the thickness of the perovskite layer. The electrical parameters, such as Jsc, and \u03b7, increase with the increase in the thickness of the perovskite layer while the FF and Voc decrease with a further rise in thickness. When increasing the absorber layer thickness, it has been observed that the Jsc, and eta performance improve but the Voc performance degrades.\nSince, as the absorber layer thickness increases, more photons are absorbed, and as photons penetrate deeper into the absorber layer, more electron-hole pairs are produced which increases the performance of the device [41]. The decrease in Voc is caused by an increase in the dark saturation current, which enhances charge carrier recombination [42]. This is addressed by the photo-generated current and dark saturation current\u2019s dependence on open-circuit voltage, which is expressed as [42,43] V kTq Ln JJ 1 (1)\nHere Jsc represents the photo-generated current density, kT/q represents the thermal voltage, and J0 represents the saturation current density\nThe SCAPS-1D program was used to simulate a solar cell device. It is freely available to the research community. Solar radiation of AM_1.5 spectrum (1 kW/m2) is illuminated from the ITO win ow layer of the perovskite device structure. To start simulation one has to insert the material parameters by selecting the option \u2018set problem\u2019, click on \u2018add the layer\u2019, then insert the electrical and optical properties of the suitable material, such as thickness, electron affinity, dielectric permittivity (relative), bandgap, electron and hole thermal velocity (cm/s), electron and hole mobility (cm2/V-s), donor density ND (cm\u22123), acceptor density NA (cm\u22123). Then, insert the absorption coefficient (\u03b1) in the absorption model and rec mbination model, add the r combination details, and include the defects of the material [36,37]. Similarly, add the layers of the different materials and make the different types of solar cells. After adding the parameters as mentioned above, one has to check the illumination of light and whether or not light is passing through glass substrate (FTO, AZO, ITO, tc.) and through ETL layer which h s less thickness (to allow th whole light to be absorbed in the absorber layer). Check whether the connections of the voltage are connected properly or not. Then, set the working point values to room temperature (300 K) and set the frequency. Add the series and shunt resistance values, ideally the series resistance would be low and t e shunt resistance would be very high. The SCAPS-1D simulation software is superior to other simulation software because it gives good consistency between experimental and simulated results. In the present simulation, series and shunt resistances are taken as 1 \u2126 and 106 \u2126 respectively. The effect of t e da gling bond on the interface of the materials has been ignored. Benchmarking is achieved by matching the correct defect design before starting the simulation, therefore, the simulated outcome matches the corresponding experimentally tested values. The parameters used in the simulation for the perovskite solar cell with device structure Glass/ITO/WS2/CH3NH3SnI3/P3HT/Au are listed in Table 1.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2201 4 of 13"

Absorber layers play a vital role in the improvement of the performance of the solar device [39,40]. All parameters, such as bandgap, thickness, and doping concertation, play an important role in optimizing performance. Figure 2 illustrates the variation of the electrical parameters with thickness, such as Voc Jsc and FF, \u03b7. The simulated outcome shows that solar cell parameters are highly dependent on the thickness of the perovskite layer. The electrical parameters, such as Jsc, and \u03b7, increase with the increase in the thickness of the perovskite layer while the FF and Voc decrease with a further rise in thickness. When increasing the absorber layer thickness, it has been observed that the Jsc, and eta performance improve but the Voc performance degrades. Since, as the absorber layer thickness increases, more photons are absorbed, and as photons penetrate deeper into the absorber layer, more electron-hole pairs are produced which increases the performance of the device [41]. The decrease in Voc is caused by an increase in the dark saturation current, which enhances charge carrier recombination [42].

Effect of Doping Density of ETL The impact of the doping density of the WS2 ETL on the functional parameters of perovskite cells has been investigated. The doping density of the ETL layer has been varied from 1015 cm\u22123 to 1022 cm\u22123, as shown in Figure 5a. Initially, with increases in the doping density of the ETL material, PCE, Voc, and FF go on increasing to a certain value of 1018 cm\u22123 and with a further increase in the doping density, Voc and FF become saturated while PCE slightly decreases and then becomes constant. The QE vs. wavelength curve shows almost constant variation in quantum efficiency with an increase in the doping concentration of the electron transport material (ETM) (Figure 5b). The QE with varied doping density at a wavelength range of ~400\u2013900 nm is observed to be constant, while a slight change can be seen below 400 nm, as shown in Figure 5b.

The optimized performance of the proposed device structure such as Voc, FF, Jsc, and PCE are 1.0997 V, 37.1778 mA, 81.59%, and 33.36% respectively. It can also be concluded that with the increase in the ETL doping concentration, the suggested structure has good performance and can compete with the existing lead-based perovskite solar cells.
