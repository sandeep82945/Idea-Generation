This approach mitigates the E-waste problem and unlocks potential for non-invasive wildlife monitoring and the exploration of uninhabited areas, with minimal environmental impact.10,11\nA solution-processable conducting polymer, poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is regarded as themost successful conducting polymer for practical applications due to its remarkable properties, including high electrical conductivity, eco-friendly aqueous processability, and good stability in different environmental conditions.12\u201315 These exceptional characteristics have paved the way for the development of advanced organic electronic devices such as organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, organic transistors, and bioelectronics applications.12,16,17 In response to the increasing demand for wearable and portable electronics, considerable attention has been directed towards improving the insufficient mechanical exibility/stretchability of PEDOT:PSS via the incorporation of plasticizers, elastomeric materials, and/or so polymers.18,19 Moreover, several research groups have begun exploring the potential of fabricating biocompatible PEDOT:PSS hydrogel for bioelectronics, inspired by the fact that an increase in ionic strength can help in the gelation of PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions.12,20,21\nRecently, biodegradable and environmentally friendly electronics have become a hot topic due to the increased awareness of E-waste and its environmental impact.9 Although PEDOT:PSS exhibits excellent electronic properties through the aforementioned processing and treatments, developing PEDOT:PSS with\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26267\u201326274 | 26267\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

One of the rst demonstrations of biodegradable PEDOT:PSS was reported in 2016, where silk was selected as the biodegradable counterpart and subjected to be enzymatically degraded.25 Subsequent studies have conrmed that the feasibility of combining PEDOT:PSS and silk, and achieving degradation via enzymatic or alcohol solutions.26,27 More recently, researchers have explored incorporating clay with PEDOT:PSS to enhance biodegradability, in which super worms can ingest the composite for degradation.28 On the other hand, while there have been studies on PEDOT:PSS composite lms with cellulose, most studies have utilised low-dose toxicity solvents (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide) as conductivity enhancer and no comprehensive degradation studies have been studied so far.29\u201333 Therefore, further study is needed to understand the characteristics of this composite system using only environmentally friendly materials and explore its biodegradability, marching towards the green electronics in the future.\nFor this reason, we conducted a study on the PEDOT:PSS composite system consisting of PEDOT:PSS, seaweed cellulose (s-cellulose) and glycerol, and assessed its biodegradability over time using soil as a medium. The s-cellulose was chosen due to its natural abundance, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nontoxicity.3,34,35 We hypothesise that the addition of s-cellulose can enhance the overall biodegradability of the PEDOT:PSS composite. Glycerol, knows as a plasticizer and secondary dopant for PEDOT:PSS, was utilised to improve its electrical conductivity.36\u201339 As a result, the combination of these PEDOT:PSS, s-cellulose and glycerol led to the development of highly conductive and biodegradable organic conductors. We have successfully developed heaters using these composite lms. Due to their biodegradable nature, these heaters have the potential for thermotherapy applications, including use in wildlife rehabilitation. They also hold promise for applications such as defrosting and de-icing plants and serving as heating pads to stimulate seed germination during cold weather conditions."

            "text": "The fabrication process of PEDOT:PSS/s-cellulose/glycerol composite lms is depicted in Fig. 1, aimed at enhancing the overall biodegradability of PEDOT:PSS by incorporating scellulose. Glycerol plays a multifunctional role in this process, acting as a plasticizer to improve the mechanical properties by forming hydrogen bonds not only with s-cellulose chains but also with PSS\u2212 chains. This thus disrupts the original hydrogen bonds among s-cellulose chains and PSS\u2212 chains, which results in well-mixed composite.40 Additionally, glycerol serves as an\n26268 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26267\u201326274\nadditive enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, promoting agglomeration and gelation of the material during drying to obtain highly conductive free-standing PEDOT:PSS composite lms.37,38 To produce these biodegradable electrical lms, a mixture of PEDOT:PSS, s-cellulose, and glycerol are prepared in 10 : 5 : 8 (ml) ratio. The selection of 5ml of s-cellulose is crucial to ensure the formation of a homogeneous lmwithout segregation and precipitation, as demonstrated in ESI (ESI) Fig. S1.\u2020 The mixture solution is subjected to magnetic stirring until it reaches a state of homogeneity, aer which it is cast into a 55 mm diameter Petri dishes and dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for two days. Following the drying process, the lms can be easily peeled off from the Petri dishes, facilitated by the hygroscopic nature of glycerol, which helps maintain the wet stability of the composite lms. Subsequently, the lms are further dried on a hotplate at 120 \u00b0C. As a result, we successfully achieved highly exible conductive PEDOT:PSS composite lms.\nElectrical properties of PEDOT:PSS composite lms\nTo evaluate the electrical performance of the PEDOT:PSS composite lms, the electrical conductivity was compared with the pure PEDOT:PSS, which was measured using a four-pointprobe. The obtained average conductivity of pure PEDOT:PSS lms is 0.7 S cm\u22121 and that of PEDOT:PSS composite lms is 5.3 S cm\u22121, an order higher than pure PEDOT:PSS aer the introduction of s-cellulose and glycerol. This notable increase in conductivity can be attributed to the formation of hydrogel bonds between the hydroxyl groups of glycerol and PSS\u2212.40 These bonds weaken the coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS, promoting the rearrangement of PEDOT chains with a more extended conformation.41 This conformational change allows for enhanced p\u2013p interactions between PEDOT chains, creating more conductive pathways for efficient charge transport.\nTo conrm that, we conducted Raman spectroscopy analysis for pure PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS/s-cellulose, PEDOT:PSS/ glycerol, and PEDOT:PSS/s-cellulose/glycerol, as depicted in Fig. 2a. In the Raman spectra, the band observed between 1400 and 1500 cm\u22121 are attributed to PEDOT, with a characteristic peak at 1432 cm\u22121 for pure PEDOT, corresponding to symmetrical Ca = Cb stretching vibrations of the aromatic rings in PEDOT.22 Notably, we observed a signicant red shi from 1432 cm\u22121 to 1428 cm\u22121 with the addition of s-cellulose and further to 1425 cm\u22121 with the addition of glycerol. This shi indicates a transformation of PEDOT chains from a coil-like (benzenoid-dominant) to linear-like (quinoid-dominant) structure, enabling greater delocalisation of conjugated p-electrons along the chains. Consequently, this conformational change can enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the conformational change is more pronounced with the addition of glycerol compared to scellulose, indicating that the primary increase in conductivity is attributed to glycerol, which is in a good agreement with the previous report for PEDOT:PSS/s-cellulose.31\nPure PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS composite lm were used as electrical conductor in an LED circuit to demonstrate their\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The PEDOT:PSS composite lm demonstrates higher LED luminescence compared to the pure PEDOT:PSS lm, highlighting its superior conductivity when serving as a better conductor (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the mechanical robustness and exibility of the PEDOT:PSS composite lms were assessed. The lms exhibited the ability to bend, fold, and twist while maintaining the LED light functionality. Furthermore, it can adhere conformably to human skin, showcasing its excellent conformability and deformability. Notably, the addition of s-cellulose and glycerol is essential to achieve thick lms with more than several tens of microscale thickness, enabling various applications with free-standing feature (Fig. 2c).\nMicrostructural and chemical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS composite lms\nThe scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. 3 compare the surface morphologies of pure PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS with glycerol, pure s-cellulose and composite lms. The pure PEDOT:PSS lm shows the typical smooth and homogenous surface (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the introduction of glycerol into PEDOT:PSS results in the formation of interconnected micro grains that exhibit a highly clustered structure (Fig. 3b). The interconnected clustered grains, linking conducting islands, facilitate the charge transfer between PEDOT chains, enhancing PEDOT:PSS conductivity.42 These observation is in line with the Raman spectra analysis, providing further evidence of the positive effect of glycerol on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. In the surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS composite lms, it seems that the brillarstructure mainly originating from s-cellulose were well\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndistributed on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS, conrming the uniform presence of s-cellulose in the composite lms (Fig. 3c and d).\nTo conrm that s-cellulose and glycerol are present in the lms upon the fabrication, we performed attenuated total reection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) by comparing the presence of the absorption bands with the pure components (Fig. 4). In the ATR-FTIR spectra, we successfully identied PEDOT:PSS, s-cellulose, and glycerol in the composite lms by their characteristic peaks. The ngerprint region of PEDOT:PSS appears in the range of 500\u20131000 cm\u22121.43,44 The broad band at 3000\u20133500 cm\u22121, 2800\u20133000 cm\u22121, and the peak at 1030 cm\u22121 are assigned to O\u2013H stretching, C\u2013H stretching, C\u2013O stretching from glycerol.45,46 Additionally, the peak at 3338 cm\u22121 and 1647 cm\u22121 are related to O\u2013H stretching and bending in scellulose.47,48 This result indicates the formation of a composite between PEDOT:PSS, s-cellulose, and glycerol.\nThermal degradation and biodegradability of PEDOT:PSS composite lms\nTo investigate the temperature-dependent thermal property changes in PEDOT:PSS aer adding s-cellulose and glycerol, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on PEDOT:PSS, s-cellulose and composite lms (ESI, Fig. S2\u2020). In all samples, the weight loss at around 100 \u00b0C can be attributed to water evaporation within the lms. The pure PEDOT:PSS lm exhibits signicant thermal degradation at approximately 300 \u00b0 C due to the decomposition of PSS, resulting from degradation of the sulfonate group in styrene, while decomposition of the PEDOT:PSS polymer backbones likely occurs above 350 \u00b0C.49 The pure s-cellulose lm shows a sharp weight loss starting\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26267\u201326274 | 26269\nFig. 2 (a) Raman spectra of PEDOT:PSS and with s-cellulose, with glycerol, and PEDOT:PSS composite films.

In the case of the PEDOT:PSS composite lm, the decomposition and weight loss commence earlier, from 130 to 240 \u00b0C, mainly due to the vaporisation of glycerol.46 These ndings, along with ATR-FTIR analysis, clearly verify the presence of glycerol and s-cellulose in the composite lms. More importantly, the addition of s-cellulose and glycerol to PEDOT:PSS accelerates thermal degradation, which is advantageous for biodegradable characteristics.\nS-cellulose is widely recognized as biodegradable material. We aimed to assess the biodegradability of PEDOT:PSS composite lms by evaluating their degradation rate in soil. The experimental setup, as depicted in ESI, Fig. S3,\u2020 involved\n26270 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26267\u201326274\nexposing the lms to simulated sunlight for several hours each day. The weight versus day graph displays a signicant reduction in the lm's weight, with almost a 50% decrease aer one week (Fig. 5). This can be attributed to the loss of water and glycerol into the soil, which is evident from the thinner appearance and dried surface of the PEDOT:PSS composite lms. Additionally, the consistently moist soil without the need for additional watering further conrms the presence of glycerol in the soil, as glycerol naturally retains water. Subsequently, the weight reduction occurred at a slower pace in the following weeks. Notably, we observed the formation of holes and cracks along the edges of one lm during the third week in the soil. Similar deterioration was observed for another sample during the seventh week, with both samples continuing to degrade in subsequent weeks. Overall, this soil degradation provides compelling evidence that the biodegradability of PEDOT:PSS lms can be enhanced by incorporating s-cellulose. Based on\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The circular PEDOT:PSS composite lmswith a diameter of 55mmwere connected to a direct current (DC) power supply through copper tape placed on 1 mm-thick glass supporting substrate, and supplied with voltages ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 V (ESI, Fig. S5\u2020). All PEDOT:PSS composite lms were tested in a temperature-controlled environment (set at 25 \u00b0C and 1 atm) and the temperature distribution on the lms surface was captured using a thermal IR camera. The electrothermal performance of the PEDOT:PSS composite heaters was evaluated under three key parameters, maximum operating temperature, heating time, and cooling time.\nFig. 6a shows the relationship between surface temperature and applied DC voltage for PEDOT:PSS composite lms as electrical heaters. As the DC voltage increases from 0 V to 3.5 V, the temperature of the lm rises from 23 \u00b0C to 105 \u00b0C. The temperature was measured aer applying voltages for two minutes. The mechanism underlying the heating of PEDOT:PSS composite lms under applied voltages involves current ow through the composite. Specically, some of the kinetic energy from the owing electrons is converted into heat, thereby warming the PEDOT:PSS composite lm.50 In addition, this result also demonstrates the effectiveness of conversion of electrical energy into Joule heating due to the low resistance as the current allows to ow through the PEDOT:PSS composite lms.51 As a demonstration of the heater's capability, we used PEDOT:PSS composite to heat up deionized water (ESI, Fig. S6\u2020).\nNext, we examined the time-dependent temperature proles for the PEDOT:PSS composite lms under different voltage\nas a wearable and portable heater (a) photography of PEDOT:PSS\nutes after applying the corresponding voltage.

The temperature gradually rises as both the operating voltage and time increase. For instance, aer two minutes, the samples operated at lower voltages of 1 V and 1.5 V reach their highest heating state temperatures of 38 \u00b0C and 51 \u00b0 C. By increasing the driven voltages to 2.0 V and 2.5 V, the surface temperature of the samples reaches maxima of 62 \u00b0C and 79 \u00b0C, respectively. Similarly, when operated at higher voltages of 3.0 V and 3.5 V, the samples reach surface temperatures of 101 \u00b0C and 139 \u00b0C, respectively. Subsequently, upon turning off the applied voltage, these samples exhibit a rapid cooling response with the rate of cooling primarily inuenced by the highest temperature and decrease swily as the accumulated heat dissipates into the surrounding environment through convection. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the temperature plateau was not achieved during the 240 s heating time due to the large heat capacity of the 1 mm-thick glass substrate used to support the PEDOT:PSS composite lms in this experiment. The heat conducts from the PEDOT:PSS composite lm into the supporting substrate resulting in signicant heat storage, which can impact the rapid increase in temperature. When the power supply was turned off, the stored heat from the substrate began to conduct back into the lm, also affecting the rapid decrease in temperature. The achievement of a temperature plateau could be addressed by utilizing thinner substrates for testing, although it was not the primary focus of this experiment.52 Overall, modulating the applied DC voltage enables precise temperature control to meet specic usage demands, showcasing the outstanding electrothermal characteristics of PEDOT:PSS composite lms for Joule heating applications.\nConsidering the safe operation and compatibility for wearable applications, 1.5 V was chosen as the applied voltage to study the long-term heating stability of the PEDOT:PSS composite lms. At 1.5 V, the PEDOT:PSS composite lms demonstrate good thermal stability and provide reliable heating performance for 900 s (Fig. 6c). The conductive PEDOT:PSS networks provide current pathway in the composite lms, enabling stable and efficient heat generation even at a low voltage of 1.5 V. This heating stability is highly desirable for long-term and reliable operation of the heater during deployment. Fig. 6d illustrates the surface temperature increase as a function of applied voltage, with low power consumption ranging from 0.6 to 7.7 watts across the driving voltages of 1 V to 3.5 V. This corresponds to a temperature range of 38 to 139 \u00b0C.\nFurthermore, Fig. 6e compares the Joule heating performance of various PEDOT:PSS-based electrical heaters with silver nanowires (AgNWs),5,52\u201365 metals,51,66 carbon based67\u201369 and additives.6,36,70\u201375 Among these, AgNWs are the most commonly combined with PEDOT:PSS to form composite for wearable heaters. This is due to their high electrical and thermal conductivities, which enable efficient heat generation.53,54 However, these nanomaterials are prone to oxidation because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, not to mention the high raw material costs.53 PEDOT:PSS composites that incorporate metals or carbon based materials typically require a substrate. Such substrate might not adequately so to adapt to skin for wearable applications, nor biodegradable.51,67 To enhance\n26272 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26267\u201326274\nwearer comfort, fabric-like wearable heaters have also been developed, primarily using PEDOT:PSS on textiles.6,36,70,72\u201375 However, these too are not biodegradable. Our PEDOT:PSS composite heaters can achieve high temperature under relatively low operating voltage, demonstrating its superior performance as low-voltage wearable and portable heaters when compared to those heaters reported in the previous literature. Additionally, its exibility and importantly biodegradability, make them ideal for thermotherapy applications in wound healing and pain management for injured wildlife without worrying E-waste in the forest. Furthermore, its excellent heating capability and biodegradability make it applicable for defrosting, deicing, demisting, and promoting seed germination in cold weather regions."
