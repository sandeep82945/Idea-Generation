1. **Investigate the potential of chlorantraniliprole as a new Alzheimer's disease drug candidate.** Chlorantraniliprole was shown to be a good starting point for a new Alzheimer's disease drug candidate in a molecular docking study. Further research could focus on synthesizing and testing chlorantraniliprole derivatives to see if they have improved potency and selectivity for acetylcholinesterase.


2. **Study the effects of selected pesticides on human health.** The results of the prediction study showed that all of the selected pesticides considered in this study have good oral bioavailability, and those with high toxicity, therefore, could be harmful to human health. Further research could focus on conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the toxicity of these pesticides and to determine their potential adverse effects on humans.


3. **Develop new methods for the extraction and analysis of pesticides in agricultural products.** The QuEChERS method is a widely used method for the extraction and analysis of pesticides in agricultural products, but it has some limitations. Further research could focus on developing new methods that are more sensitive, selective, and rapid than the QuEChERS method.


4. **Investigate the environmental fate and transport of selected pesticides.** The environmental fate and transport of pesticides are important factors to consider when assessing their potential risks to human health and the environment. Further research could focus on studying the fate and transport of selected pesticides in different environmental compartments, such as soil, water, and air.


5. **Develop new strategies for the management of pesticide resistance.** Pesticide resistance is a major problem that can lead to the failure of pest control programs. Further research could focus on developing new strategies for the management of pesticide resistance, such as the use of integrated pest management (IPM) practices and the development of new pesticides that are less prone to resistance.
