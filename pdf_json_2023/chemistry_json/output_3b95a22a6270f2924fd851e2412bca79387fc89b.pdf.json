    "abstractText": "In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized using Cucumis melo L. leaf extract via a green synthesis approach and their potential against diabetes and coccidiosis was tested under in vitro conditions. The phytochemical components in the leaf extract reacted with silver nitrate in solution and yielded C. melo-silver nanoparticles (Cm-AgNPs). The synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed via UV\u2013visible spectroscopy by obtaining a peak at 440 nm. The nanoparticles were characterized by their morphology, crystallinity, and the presence of functional groups. In vitro \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assays were carried out at different concentrations in the range of 20 to 100 \u03bcg/mL of Cm-AgNPs. The Cm-AgNPs exhibited enzyme inhibitory activity in a concentration-dependent manner. As the concentration of Cm-AgNPs increased the inhibitory activities were also increased linearly and the highest inhibition was observed at 100 \u03bcg/mL. The effectiveness of Cm-AgNPs against Eimeria tenalla was assessed by an in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell lines. The results revealed that the viability of the oocysts and further sporulation were decreased with the increased concentration of Cm-AgNPs. The AgNPs synthesized from the C. melo leaf extract have shown promising potential against diabetes and coccidiosis, and they could be used in biomedical applications.",

The nanoparticles, either organic (carbon, C) or inorganic metals (silver, Ag, and gold, Au), play a significant role as biomedical agents and pharmaceutical products. Among the metallic nanoparticles, Ag-based nanoparticles (AgNPs) are small in size, ranging from 10\u2013100 nm with specific physicochemical characteristics such as size, shape, electrical conductivity, optical density, and high reactive surface area [1]. These unique characteristics allow control over the different characteristics of drugs or other biomedical agents such as alteration in solubility and blood pool retention time, controlled release over short or long durations, environmentally triggered controlled release, or highly specific site-targeted delivery [2]. The AgNPs\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4995. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134995 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4995 2 of 15\nsynthesized were proven to have potential therapeutic applications against many diseases, such as cancers [3,4], and antimicrobial, antifungal, and antioxidant effects [5\u20138]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most commonly prevalent non-communicable and life-threatening diseases among populations around the world [1]. In normal conditions, intestinal enzymes, such as \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase, degrade the starch and oligosaccharides found in food to glucose, and the insulin hormone secreted by the pancreas helps glucose enter into cells to be used for body energy [9,10]. Sometimes the pancreas does not make enough insulin or the body does not use the secreted insulin properly. Thus, glucose stays in the blood and, over time, it causes the development of chronic hyperglycemia. The combination of insulin resistance and the inhibition of insulin secretion results in type 2 diabetic conditions, influenced by genetic determinants, the over-intake of food, a sedentary lifestyle, and aging [10]. Clinical studies have shown that currently available treatments like insulin injection and antihyperglycemic drugs can cause several side effects in patients when the drugs are used in the long term and slow down therapeutic responses [11]. Today, the role of biosynthesized nanoparticles is attracting the interest of the pharmaceutical industry to create safe antidiabetic drugs to be used among patients. Coccidiosis disease is caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria developing within the intestine of most domestic and wild animals and birds. Live attenuated and non-attenuated vaccines are available to curtail the risks of infection, but they are not cost-effective. Another disadvantage is that live vaccines need host cells to replicate and to instigate active immunity, which causes them to result in subclinical coccidiosis [12]. The control of coccidiosis is difficult due to the emergence of drug resistance and the limitations of available anticoccidial vaccines lead to frequent disease outbreaks. Therefore, alternative approaches, such as the use of AgNPs and plant extracts as anticoccidial agents are being considered and are now the focus of many researchers. The infection of chicken intestines begins with the ingestion of sporulated oocysts releasing sporocysts, which in turn release sporozoites. The discharge of sporozoites from infected oocysts/sporocysts, otherwise known as the excystation process, is a critical step in the intracellular development of parasites inside the host cells [13]. Generally, AgNPs are prepared by employing different chemical reactions, such as the reduction in Ag ions in aqueous solutions with or without stabilizing agents [14], thermal decomposition of inorganic solvents [15], chemical reduction and photoreduction in reverse-micelles processes [16,17], and microwave-assisted irradiation [18]. However, these chemical methods have certain disadvantages, such as the involvement of toxic and hazardous chemicals during the processes, being economically not viable, being unsafe to the environment, and the resultant product being biologically unsafe or incompatible with living entities [19,20]. Thus, there is a growing need to develop nontoxic, biocompatible, eco-friendly, and efficient methods to synthesize AgNPs for their use in medical and pharmaceutical products. This has caused researchers turn their focus to living organisms. In recent times, many studies have been conducted by exploring the different kinds of organisms, such as bacteria [21], fungi [22], algae [23], and plants [24,25], to create costeffective, safe, and environmentally compatible AgNPs. Many plants and plant extracts have been reported for the successful production of stable nanoparticles, particularly Cantharanthus roseus leaf extracts [26] and Clitorea ternatea and Solanum nigrum [27]. Kesharwani et al. fabricated high-density stable nanoparticles of size 16\u201340 nm using the leaf extracts of Datura metal [28]. Black tea leaf extracts were also used in the formation of AgNPs [29]. It is assumed that the leaf extracts contain a large number of active metabolites, such as alcoholic components, alkaloids, proteins, amino acids, and enzymes that aided in the reduction in Ag ions and led to the formation of AgNPs [28]. Cucumis melo L. is commonly known as musk melon, and it belongs to the family of Cucurbitaceae. It is a climbing annual herb. It grows well in a well-drained deep soil and it has long been cultivated mainly for its edible fruits; however, it is found as a weed in cultivated fields, natural open areas, grasslands, and wastelands [30]. Cucumis melo leaves\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4995 3 of 15\nare simple and alternate, approximately rounded and pubescent with cordate bases on long petioles, and with 3 to 7 shallow or irregular lobes [31]. The leaves have medicinal importance, owing to the presence of a group of phytoconstituents [32]. It has been found that the leaf extracts of the Cucurbitaceae family have antibacterial, antifungal, wound-healing, antiviral, antidiabetic (type 2), antidiarrheal, and anti-inflammatory activities [33,34]. The present study to synthesize AgNPs from the leaf extracts of C. melo has proven its excellent antidiabetic potential and anticoccidial efficacy under in vitro conditions."

The morphology of AgNPs from the SEM results is in correlation with the previously reported AgNPs biosynthesized from C. melo [43]. Less than 100 nm of silver nanoparticles with spherical shapes are highly active in terms of sustainable silver release due to their vast surface region [44]. Silver nanoparticles of smaller sizes have proven antibacterial efficacy [45], antiviral properties, and other beneficial uses [46]. The IR peaks at 1640, 1748, and 3320 cm\u22121 are characteristic of AgNPs and are in close agreement with the previously synthesized AgNPs using plant extracts [47]. The IR peak at 3429.35 cm\u22121 was assigned to alcoholic O-H or N-H groups in the phenolic compound stretching vibration. A weak absorption peak at 1768.34 cm\u22121 corresponds to aldehyde, ketone, and carboxylic acid groups. From previous reports, it was predicted that the peak at 1768.34 cm\u22121 was involved (terpenoids) in the reduction process of silver ions to silver (ref). Terpenoids might have been oxidized to carboxyl groups and could have led to IR absorption in this position. A strong peak at 1630.52 cm\u22121 is suggested to be the capping of AgNPs. The peaks at 1384.48 cm\u22121, 1097.15 cm\u22121, 832.97 cm\u22121, and 598.67 cm\u22121 assigned to NO2, C-OH, aliphatic chloro compounds, and aliphatic bromo compounds were present in C. melo extract, respectively. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase is the key enzyme that breaks down the complex starch and carbohydrates, i.e., oligosaccharides, to disaccharides in the intestine. Hence, the inhibition activity of \u03b1-amylase offers an effective strategy to reduce the level of post-prandial hyperglycemia. Amylase inhibitors or starch blockers contain substances that prevent starch dietary components from being absorbed by the body. Therefore, the increase in blood sugar levels can be reduce through carbohydrate consumption [48]. Both C. melo leaf extracts [32] and biosynthesized AgNPs [48,49] have been reported as potential \u03b1-amylase inhibitors. The main role of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors is to inhibit the absorption of carbohydrates from the small intestine. \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors are compared favorably to inhibitor enzymes that change complex non-absorbable into simple absorbable carbohydrates. These enzymes involved slow carbohydrate absorption and lead to a reduction in\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4995 10 of 15\nblood glucose level [50,51]. Similar dose-dependent amylase inhibition activity by Cassia auriculata-AgNPs was also reported by Thirumal and Sivakumar [48]. The results obtained in this study are in agreement with those of Kazeem et al., who mentioned that mild amylase inhibition is desirable compared to the excessive inhibition of amylase activity, since it leads to the abnormal bacterial fermentation of undigested starch in the colon [52]. They also inferred that the different biological components in the leaf extract might have greatly contributed to the inhibition of enzyme activity by competing with the substrate for binding to the active sites of \u03b1-amylase. Our results closely match with the concentration-dependent inhibitory activity of biosynthesized AgNPS varied between 18.3% and 63.1% [48]. Kazeem et al. found that the phytochemicals present in leaves do not compete with the substrate for binding to the active sites on \u03b1-glucosidase; however, they compete for separate sites on enzymes and retard the cleavage of di- to monosaccharides and reduce the glucose level in the blood [52]. In line with previous reports [48,49], the AgNPs synthesized from the leaves of C. melo have also been shown to have strong intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme activity, which can effectively and safely be used against postprandial hyperglycemia. Similar pathological observations were made by Kasem et al. [53]. Chickens can be infected with sporulated oocysts found in feed material, and these oocysts are the primary cause of coccidiosis spreading among chickens [53,54]. Additionally, E. tenella oocysts can remain viable and active for a period of nine months in poultry litter, making it a source for other poultry farms [55]. Many plant extracts-based nanoparticles have proven anticoccidial ability against Eimeria. Kasem et al. observed in vitro sporulation disruption with the chitosan-based nanoparticles from the ethanolic leaves extract of Rosmarinus officinalis in the oocysts of E.tenella [53]. Dkhil et al. reported that Ag-nanoparticles synthesized from the rhizome extracts of Zingiber officinale have anticoccidial ability against E. papillata [56]. Ismail et al. demonstrated that the leaves of C. melo are rich in phenolic compounds and exhibited high antioxidant potential [57]. Hence, it could be concluded that the secondary metabolites in the leaves of C. melo might have caused oxygen stress and disrupted the survival of the oocysts of E. tenella. Additionally, as suggested by Cedric et al., in extracts of Psidium guajava, the leaf extract might have penetrated the cell wall of oocysts and damaged the intracellular components [58]."
