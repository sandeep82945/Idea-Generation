A new approach, not yet explored, is the activation frequency. Objective: The aim of this split-mouth randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of reactivation intervals on the efficiency of tooth movement. Methods: Thirty eight patients having a Class I malocclusion with bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion or severe crowding, Class II with mandibular deficiency or Class III, requiring first premolar extraction and canine retraction were recruited. Elastomeric chains producing 150g were replaced every two, four, six or eight weeks. There were 36, 37, 36, and 36 quadrants randomly allocated to these groups, respectively. The canine retraction rate was the primary outcome. Canine tipping, rotation, and root resorption and pain were the secondary outcomes. Only the outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. Results: The average total movement for the 6 months was 5.14, 5.31, 2.79 and 3.85\u00a0mm for the two-week, four-week, six-week and eight-week reactivation intervals, respectively. Root resorption was significantly higher in the twoweek and four-week groups. No adverse events were observed. Conclusion: The canine retraction rate, tipping, rotation and pain were similar in 2, 4, 6 and 8-week activation intervals groups. Longer reactivation intervals show less root resorption. The trial protocol was not pre-registered. The study was self-funded.\nKeywords: Canine retraction. Appointment interval. Reactivation interval. Rate of tooth movement.

Um aspecto ainda n\u00e3o avaliado s\u00e3o os diferentes intervalos entre as ativa\u00e7\u00f5es. Objetivo: O objetivo desse estudo controlado e randomizado de boca dividida foi avaliar a influ\u00eancia de diferentes intervalos de reativa\u00e7\u00e3o na efici\u00eancia da movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dent\u00e1ria. M\u00e9todos: Foram recrutados 38 pacientes com m\u00e1 oclus\u00e3o de Classe I com biprotrus\u00e3o dentoalveolar ou apinhamento severo, Classe II com defici\u00eancia mandibular ou Classe\u00a0III, que necessitavam de extra\u00e7\u00e3o do primeiro pr\u00e9-molar e retra\u00e7\u00e3o do canino.

A factor not yet explored is the reactivation interval. Varying the duration between appointments may affect the onset and duration of the resorptive and depository cycles of bone remodeling.\nGenerally, appointment intervals are guided by the type of appliance and the patient\u2019s and clinicians\u2019 schedules. The JCO readers\u2019 survey6 and the AAO survey7 report that the most frequent appointment intervals is about 6 weeks. Fewer orthodontists were seeing patients every 4 weeks.6 Nowadays, appliances sustain adequate forces and support less frequent visits.\nA retrospective study by Alger8 showed that extending the appointment interval to six weeks did not prolong the overall treatment time.\n5\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nDecreasing the number of appointments may improve patient satisfaction, decrease orthodontists\u2019 chairside time, indirect cost and allow more patients to be scheduled.5 However, it may cause overcorrection and delay monitoring patient\u2019s oral hygiene and cooperation."

Canines and second premolars were bonded with 0.022-in Roth prescription brackets (Mini Master; American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, USA). Leveling and alignment were performed using sequential wires up to 0.016 x 0.022-in SS, bypassing the four incisors.\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nTemporary anchorage devices (TADs; 1.8mm x 8mm) (3M\u00a0Unitek, Monrovia, CA) were placed between the second premolars and first molars. The patients were then referred for premolars\u2019 extraction and canine retraction was started within one to two weeks. Power arms, 8mm in length, were fabricated using a 0.016 x 0.016-in stainless steel wire to approximate the delivered force to the center of resistance (Fig 1).\nA pre-retraction cone beam computed tomography (CBCT; Aceton X-mind Trium. La Cietat. France) was acquired within two weeks of the premolar extraction. A second CBCT was acquired after 6 months of canine retraction. Patients who missed the follow-up CBCT were rescheduled within 7 days. The DICOM images were imported into InVivo 5 software (version 5.3.1; Santa Clara, CA, USA).\nFigure 1: Canine retraction with elastomeric chains connected from the miniscrews to the power arms.\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nUsing a force gauge (50-500 g, Dental Morelli Ltda, Sorocaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), the elastomeric chains (Short, Silver, American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, Wis.) were stretched between the TADs and the power arms, to deliver 150g. According to the allocated intervention, the elastomeric chains were replaced every two, four, six or eight weeks. It was possible for a single patient to have a different reactivation schedule for each quadrant. The\u00a0TADs stability was checked at each visit.\nUsing the Invivo 5 software, CBCT landmarks were identified on the 3D volume and adjusted on the multiplanar slice locator, in the axial, sagittal and coronal views, using the Invivo\u00a05 software. The stable bony landmarks; incisive foramen, the anterior and posterior nasal spines and the right and left mental foramina were identified (Fig 2).\nFigure 2: Bony landmarks: 1. Incisive foramen, 2. Mental foramen, 3. Anterior Nasal Spine, 4. Posterior Nasal Spine.\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nDental landmarks, the canine crown tip and canine root apex were localized in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes. They\u00a0were identified as the smallest point at the apex, which coincided in the three planes (Fig 3). Root resorption was calculated as the difference in canine length, from cusp tip to root apex, between the pre- and post-retraction CBCTs.\nFour reference planes were constructed. The median sagittal plane (MSP) was constructed along the anterior nasal spine, the incisive foramen and the posterior nasal spine. The horizontal plane (HP) was constructed perpendicular to the MSP and passing through the Anterior Nasal Spine (ANS) and the Posterior Nasal Spine (PNS). The maxillary frontal plane (FP1) was perpendicular to the MSP and the HP, passing through the incisive foramen. Similarly, the mandibular frontal plane (FP2) was perpendicular to the MSP and the HP, passing through the right and left mental foramina. The planes are shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 3: Localization of canine root apex in transverse (1), sagittal (2) and coronal (3) planes. CBCT reference planes (Medial Sagittal Plane, Horizontal Plane, maxillary & mandibular frontal planes ).\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nThe primary outcome was the amount of canine retraction for six months. The amount of canine retraction was calculated as the difference between the pre-retraction and post-retraction perpendicular distances from the upper and lower canine cusp tips to the constructed FP1 and FP2, respectively. The\u00a0amount of canine retraction for the six months was reported. Secondary outcomes of interest were canine tipping, rotation, root resorption and pain. Canine tipping was measured between the long axis of the canine (cusp tip to root apex) and their respective frontal planes (Fig 4). The maxillary and mandibular canine rotation angles were measured from a line connecting the maximum mesial and distal crown convexities to their respective frontal planes.\nFigure 4: CBCT reference planes: Median Sagittal Plane (MSP), Horizontal Plane (HP), Maxillary (FP1) and Mandibular (FP2) Frontal Planes.\nMSP\nHP FP 1FP 2\n11\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nThe outcome evaluator remeasured 10 CBCTs, to calculate the intra-observer agreement.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Studies have previously compared different methods of canine retraction. Most studies concluded that different techniques produce similar rates of movement.4 Thus, the commonly used elastomeric chains are as effective, and perhaps more economic than other means.5,10\nHowever, force decay of elastomeric chains is a disadvantage. Studies showed a significant decrease in the initial force during the first hour of activation. It was then relatively stable for the following four weeks, retaining 30-60% of the force.11 This evidence led clinicians to replace the elastomeric chains every 3-4 weeks.12\n17\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nStudies reported canine retraction for up to 1513 or 1614 weeks with unchanged elastomeric chains. Therefore, the elastomeric chains were chosen for this study.\nThe 2005 JCO survey6 evaluated clinicians\u2019 preference regarding interval between appointments. None of the responders indicated appointment intervals of three weeks or less. A\u00a0period of six to eight weeks between appointments was preferred in non-extraction cases,15 extraction cases using friction mechanics and in working parents and school children.6 Yet, the literature search performed in the present study showed a four-week reactivation interval in most of the studies using elastomeric chains.\nVarying the reactivation interval for canine retraction produced similar amounts of tooth movement. The difference between the highest and lowest amount was 2.35mm, which was statistically insignificant. This may be explained by the variation in the amount of canine retraction and the fact that tooth movement depends on the strain and tissue reaction produced in the periodontium, regardless of the reactivation rate.\nAlthough orthodontic appliances were activated every two weeks8,15 in the past, there are no trials evaluating the effect of this interval. However, studies by Ziegler and Ingervall16 and Al-Suleiman and Shehadah17 used a three-week reactivation interval, and showed average monthly canine retraction rates of 1.41mm and 1.42mm, respectively. Lotzof et al.18 reported\n18\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\n1.63\u00a0mm of retraction every three weeks. The higher retraction rates observed with frequent activations may be explained by the use of 0.018-in stainless steel wires, which may have reduced friction during sliding.\nStudies that reactivated elastomeric chains every four weeks observed canine retraction comparable to the results of the present study. Mezomo et al.19 showed 2.53\u00b10.62 mm of canine retraction in three months (0.84\u00b10.21 mm/month), while Dixon et al.10 reported 2.33\u00b11.18 mm of overall space closure in four months (0.58mm/month).\nMitra et al20 reactivated power chains every six weeks, and reported a total canine retraction of 2.78\u00b10.13\u00a0 mm in 4.5 months (0.61mm/month). This rate was closer to that shown by Dixon et al.10 Compared to the results of the present study, the slower rate of space closure in these trials may be explained by the use of posted archwires instead of direct attachment to the canine brackets.\nHeavy archwires are recommended for sliding mechanics, to prevent wire bending and binding with the brackets.21 However, static friction is largely influenced by the vertical dimension of the archwire.22 Approximately half of the retraction force is lost due to this friction.23 Therefore, we retracted the canines using 0.016\u00a0x\u00a00.022-in archwires. This wire\u2019s flexibility may increase the kinetic friction by allowing a larger angle between the wire\n19\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nand the bracket. To overcome this, we used a relatively low force for retraction,23 and a power arm21,24 was used to approximate the line of action of the force to the center of resistance of the tooth,25 thus minimizing wire bending. Several researchers have used 0.016\u00a0x\u00a00.022-in archwires24,26 and even 0.018-in archwires,16 to reduce the friction during sliding.\nBypassing the four incisors avoided round-tripping the anterior teeth, and prevented these teeth to take up the extraction space in the cases with crowding. It also allowed the early retraction of the canines.\nIt was expected that frequent activations would increase the canine tipping. However, the four groups showed similar tipping, probably due to the use of the power arms. Studies by Zeigler and Ingervall,16 and Al-Suleiman and Shehada17 lasted six and five months, respectively. The tipping of 8.5\u00b0 (1.41\u00b11.29\u00b0/month) reported by Zeigler and Ingervall16 was similar to that observed in the four-week reactivation interval of the present study; while Al-Suleiman & Shebada17 reported 14\u00b0 of tipping. This result was probably due to the less rigid archwire used with the 0.018-in slot brackets.\nZeigler and Ingervall16 and Mezomo et al.19 reported 4.04\u00b0 and 4.8\u00b0 of canine rotation for every millimeter of retraction, respectively.\n20\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nTotal rotation was 24\u00b0 in six months and 12.27\u00b0 in three months. Al-Suleiman and Shehadah17 reported 3.32\u00b11.42\u00b0 of rotation. However, it is not clear if this rotation was for the five months of retraction or per millimeter of retraction. In\u00a0this study, an average of 2\u00b0 of canine rotation per millimeter of retraction was comparable to the other studies. However, canine rotation showed high variation in this sample.\nThe studies employed different methods of outcome measurements. Three studies used innovative tools to measure the amount of canine retraction, without radiation exposure16,18,19 The\u00a0 pre-retraction model was used to construct a plate, with occlusal indentations for the molars and incisors.16 This plate was fitted intra-orally during retraction. The distal surface of the canine bracket was measured to a stiff vertical wire incorporated in the plate. The authors reported that the molars moved during the canine retraction and that the plate had to be modified to fit at the incisal edges. Other studies constructed an acrylic transfer plate, on the rugae area, with stiff wire extensions.18,19 The plate was transferred to subsequent models, and the canines21 and the first molars18,19 were measured to the wire extensions. Although the studies used different methodology, their results did not show large variations, and the reporting of the mean difference makes comparing the results possible. The use of unstable teeth for reference may be adequate when assessing overall space closure.10,20 However, it will not provide information on the amount of space closed by anchorage loss of the posterior unit.\n21\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nOrthodontic treatment produces mild to moderate root shortening. Frequent reactivations decrease the time for the resorbed cementum to recover. The maximum root resorption in all the groups was smaller than 2.7 mm, which is within the average amount reported for orthodontic apical root resorption. The results in this study were higher than those reported by Alkebsi et al27 (0.73mm). Although they used similar mechanics for retraction, their trial duration lasted three months. Longer durations of tooth movement were associated with increased root resorption.28 The progression of root resorption should be monitored if the force is frequently reactivated.\nIn the present study, the follow-up CBCTs were acquired after six months of retraction. This left a waiting period between the complete canine retraction and the acquisition of the second CBCT for the 27 canines, which may have allowed for the correction of root resorption, distal tipping and rotation, thus underestimating the true amounts of change. However, this does not seem to be the case in the present study, since the changes observed were similar to those reported in the above-mentioned studies.\nSimilar to other studies,9,29 the pain intensity was highest on the first day after activation, then declined. The pain scores showed high inter and intra-individual variability, which was also reported by other studies evaluating canine retraction.30 It was not possible to statistically compare the pain intensity between\n22\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nthe groups, due to the high frequency of patients reporting zero pain. The percentage of patients who reported pain in the four groups was similar. Yet, compared to the other groups, pain lasted for more days in the two-week reactivation group. Pain was rarely reported in patients participating in this study, which differs from other studies.9,29,30 This may indicate that ethinicity and environment play a strong role in the pain experience.31,32\nThe results of the present study should be interpreted with caution. Limitations of the study, including the missing data reported in the eight-week group and the uneven number of quadrants across the groups, may affect the robustness of the analysis. Block randomization with each patient receiving the four interventions would have eliminated this problem. However, this was not possible since not all patients required four premolar extraction. The large variability for canine tipping, rotation, root resorption, and pain should be considered. Some image artifacts in the CBCTs prevented a clear localization of the mesial and distal crown convexities, which may have increased the error of measurements for canine rotation. Although the trial protocol was not pre-registered, the authors adhered to the protocol and have reported all relevant outcomes.\nNineteen quadrants in seven patients had severe crowding. Although the anterior teeth were not leveled and aligned, they may have used up part of the extraction space. The inclusion of these cases may have underestimated the amount of canine retraction.\n23\nDental Press J Orthod. 2023;28(5):e2123166\nThere are some drawbacks regarding the generalizability of this study. The pain experience reported is different from most published trials, which may be attributed to ethnicity and culture. There was an unequal representation of males and females in the present study. Since this was the first prospective trial to evaluate the effect of reactivation intervals, further studies are required to elucidate the reliability of these results.\nThis study was conducted to highlight the effect of different reactivation intervals on the canine retraction rate using conventional elastomeric chains. The present data may guide the methodology and sample size calculation of future studies."
