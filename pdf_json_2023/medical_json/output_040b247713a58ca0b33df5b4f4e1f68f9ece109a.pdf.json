    "abstractText": "The enzymatic arsenal of several soil microorganisms renders them particularly suitable for the degradation of lignocellulose, a process of distinct ecological significance with promising biotechnological implications. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal diversity and distribution of bacteria and fungi with 16S and Internally Trascribed Spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA nextgeneration-sequencing (NGS), focusing on forest mainland Abies cephalonica and insular Quercus ilex habitats of Greece. We analyzed samples during winter and summer periods, from different soil depths, and we applied optimized and combined targeted meta-omics approaches aiming at the peroxidase-catalase family enzymes to gain insights into the lignocellulose degradation process at the soil microbial community level. The microbial communities recorded showed distinct patterns of response to season, soil depth and vegetation type. Overall, in both forests Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria were the most abundant bacteria phyla, while the other phyla and the super-kingdom of Archaea were detected in very low numbers. Members of the orders Agaricales, Russulales, Sebacinales, Gomphales, Geastrales, Hysterangiales, Thelephorales, and Trechisporales (Basidiomycota), and Pezizales, Sordariales, Eurotiales, Pleosporales, Helotiales, and Diaporthales (Ascomycota) were the most abundant for Fungi. By using optimized \u201cuniversal\u201d PCR primers that targeted the peroxidasecatalase enzyme family, we identified several known and novel sequences from various Basidiomycota, even from taxa appearing at low abundance. The majority of the sequences recovered were manganese peroxidases from several genera of Agaricales, Hysterangiales, Gomphales, Geastrales, Russulales, Hymenochaetales, and Trechisporales, while lignin -and versatile-peroxidases were limited to two to eight species, respectively. Comparisons of the obtained sequences with publicly available data allowed a detailed structural analysis of polymorphisms and functionally relevant amino-acid residues at phylogenetic level. The targeted metagenomics applied here revealed an important role in lignocellulose degradation of hitherto understudied orders of Basidiomycota, such as the Hysterangiales and Gomphales, while it also suggested the auxiliary activity of particular members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes.

In this study, we\u00a0 investigated the spatiotemporal diversity and distribution of bacteria and fungi with 16S and Internally Trascribed Spacer (ITS) ribosomal RNA nextgeneration-sequencing (NGS), focusing on forest mainland Abies cephalonica and insular Quercus ilex habitats of Greece. We\u00a0analyzed samples during winter and summer periods, from different soil depths, and we\u00a0applied optimized and combined targeted meta-omics approaches aiming at the peroxidase-catalase family enzymes to gain insights into the lignocellulose degradation process at the soil microbial community level. The microbial communities recorded showed distinct patterns of response to season, soil depth and vegetation type. Overall, in both forests Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria were the most abundant bacteria phyla, while the other phyla and the super-kingdom of Archaea were detected in very low numbers. Members of the orders Agaricales, Russulales, Sebacinales, Gomphales, Geastrales, Hysterangiales, Thelephorales, and Trechisporales (Basidiomycota), and Pezizales, Sordariales, Eurotiales, Pleosporales, Helotiales, and Diaporthales (Ascomycota) were the most abundant for Fungi. By using optimized \u201cuniversal\u201d PCR primers that targeted the peroxidasecatalase enzyme family, we\u00a0 identified several known and novel sequences from various Basidiomycota, even from taxa appearing at low abundance. The majority of the sequences recovered were manganese peroxidases from several genera of Agaricales, Hysterangiales, Gomphales, Geastrales, Russulales, Hymenochaetales, and Trechisporales, while lignin -and versatile-peroxidases were limited to two to eight species, respectively. Comparisons of the obtained sequences with publicly available data allowed a detailed structural analysis of polymorphisms and functionally relevant amino-acid residues at phylogenetic level. The targeted metagenomics applied here revealed an important role in lignocellulose degradation of hitherto understudied orders of Basidiomycota, such as the Hysterangiales and Gomphales, while it also suggested the auxiliary activity of particular members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes.

            "text": "During the past decades, modern societies heavily depended on fossil-fuels as the main s\u03bfurce of energy, leading t\u03bf global climate changes and environmental deterioration. These, combined with the inevitable depletion of fossil-fuel reserves intensified efforts on search of alternative renewable resources. Both the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the European Union (\u0395U) have set biofuel roadmap policies aiming at the substitution of crude \u03bfil on transportation fuel by 20% (the latest by 2030), with the production of ethanol mainly fr\u03bfm cellulosic feedstock (U.S. Department of Energy, 2016; Camia et\u00a0al., 2021). \u03a4\u03bf avoid the controversial use of feedstock crop material which was the basis of first generation biorefineries, attention has been drawn to the use of non-edible resources like agricultural and forest residues. \u0399n this respect, forests that cover vast areas of Earth\u2019s surface are the most important terrestrial resources of carbon-based material, and trees and tree-derived litter like dead wood, fallen trunks, branches, sticks, twings, leaves, etc. can provide abundant, renewable material to sustainably serve as the basis for biofuel production (Kang et\u00a0al., 2014). As organic matter accumulates on soil\u2019s surface, a wealth of microorganisms contribute to decompose it, thus recycling carbon and providing valuable nutrients for tree growth and for sustaining life in forests. Inevitably a complex soil ecosystem is developed above and under the forest soil\u2019s surface maintained by reciprocal interactions between microbial communities and trees, and affected by the type of plants, their carbon pools, geographic locations, weather conditions, soil components, etc., for which information is accumulating lately (Churchland and Grayston, 2014; Baldrian, 2017; Bayranvand et\u00a0al., 2021; Mundra et\u00a0al., 2021).\nTrees and tree-derived litter are mainly composed of lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose; the degradation of these biopolymers is undertaken predominantly by wood-decaying fungi of the class Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota) and secondarily by members of \u0391scomycota and Bacteria (de Boer et\u00a0al., 2005; Bugg et\u00a0al., 2011; Cragg et\u00a0al., 2015; Brink et\u00a0al., 2019). The best studied wood-decaying fungi belong to the white-rot, brown-rot and soft-rot fungi, which employ different mechanisms to modify lignin and lignocellulose complexes, and use either a multitude of secreted enzymes or combine the action of only few enzymes (Eastwood et\u00a0al., 2011; Arantes and Goodell, 2014; Goodell et\u00a0al., 2020). In particular white-rot fungi are the only basidiomycetes that have been convincingly shown to efficiently mineralize lignin (de Boer et\u00a0 al., 2005). They secrete an array of oxidating and hydrolytic enzymes into their environment and depolymerize the recalcitrant molecules into simple building blocks that are critical in nutrient-cycling in forests, as well as in maintaining bacteria communities that preferentially utilize these building blocks,\nand therefore depend \u03bfn decomposition products for survival (Stursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2012). \u039cany of the white-rot fungi code for three class \u0399\u0399 peroxidases, namely the lignin peroxidises (LiP) which oxidize the major non-phenolic moiety of lignin (Hammel and Cullen, 2008), the manganese peroxidases (\u039cn\u03a1) that oxidize \u039cn2+ to \u039cn3+, and subsequently the minor phenolic moiety of lignin (Fern\u00e1ndez-Fueyo et\u00a0 al., 2014) and the versatile peroxidases (V\u03a1), that combine the catalytic properties of both \u039cn\u03a1 and LiP (Camarero et\u00a0 al., 1999; Hofrichter et\u00a0al., 2010). \u039fften white-rot fungi also code for generic peroxidases (GP), catalytically similar to plant peroxidases (AyusoFern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2019). All the above types of peroxidases have been characterized and their structures are known (Wong, 2009; RuizDue\u00f1as and Mart\u00ednez, 2010). Thus, the intrinsic mechanisms employed by wood-decaying fungi to decompose lignin and moreover the plethora of enzymes they secrete makes them ideally suited for the industrial production of aromatic building blocks and valuable enzymes for the generation of renewable biofuels (Holladay et\u00a0al., 2007; Kang et\u00a0al., 2014).\nForest soils are densely populated by large numbers of fungal and bacteria species, the identification and quantification of which has been the target of several research groups in the past two decades (Martin et\u00a0al., 2000; Baldrian et\u00a0al., 2012; Johnston et\u00a0al., 2016). With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, an increasing number of metagenomic studies based \u03bfn the small rRNA gene (16S) for bacteria and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi has provided valuable information on their taxonomy, community structure and diversity in forest soils (Fierer et\u00a0al., 2009, 2012; \u039cartin et\u00a0al., 2012). Furthermore, such analyses helped to understand the mutualistic relationships between fungi and bacteria (Stursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2012; Johnston et\u00a0al., 2016), fungi and plants (Baldrian, 2017), and to uncover the important synergistic role that certain bacteria play in ligninocellulose biomass degradation (Baldrian, 2017; Wilhelm et\u00a0al., 2019). It also became evident that the most important factors effecting biomass degradation rates, and therefore the fungal and bacteria species responsible for wood decomposition, are the properties of the tree litter, seasonal changes and variation in the top soil temperature (Stursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2012; \u0392rockett et\u00a0al., 2012; Urbanov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2015; Fierer, 2017). However, although the benefits of targeted NGS metagenomic approaches for specific genes have been outlined for the information they may provide about metabolic pathways, uncultured microorganisms and adaptive evolution of enzymes in various ecological habitats (Iwai et\u00a0al., 2010), there is still a definite lack of combining taxonomic and functional markers to understand the complex relationships of all participating \u201cpartners\u201d and abiotic factors in forest habitats.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\nAbies cephalonica is an endemic fir species in Greece, and it occurs in the continental part of the country and in the islands of Evia and Kefalonia, at altitudes of 900\u20131,700 m. In addition, the sclerophyllous forests of Quercus ilex (holm oak) exist in the greater Mediterranean area only (Caudullo et\u00a0 al., 2017), and due to their value as biodiversity reserves they are included in the priority Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC (Annex I). As regards Greece in particular, Q. ilex is a rather common maquis element, especially in areas with relatively high precipitation; in Aegean islands, it appears in scattered localities, mostly as relict stands, at altitudes of 200\u2013800 m. Although macrofungi in Greek forests dominated by either A. cephalonica or Q. ilex have been investigated for years and several hundred of plant-associated mushroom species were recorded (Pantidou, 1980; Zervakis et\u00a0 al., 2002; Dimou et\u00a0 al., 2008; Polemis et\u00a0al., 2013, 2014, 2019), this approach which focuses on the collection and examination of visible sporocarps (basidiomata and ascomata), reveals just part of the existing diversity of Basidiomycota and (to an even lesser extent of) Ascomycota. Moreover, no data are available about other key elements of the forest microbiota (e.g., all other fungal groups as well as Bacteria), let alone of information pertinent to the relative abundance and functional diversity of soil microorganisms.\nThe aim of this study was to gain an insight into the lignocellulose degradation process at the soil microbial community level, by focusing \u03bfn forest mainland A. cephalonica and insular Q. ilex habitats of Greece, and by analyzing samples during winter (December, wet) and summer (June, dry) periods. To achieve this, high-throughput ITS and 16S metagenomic analyses of the DNA obtained from microbial communities were performed and their spatiotemporal presence in the forest ecosystems were established through phylogenetic analyses. Numerous \u201cuniversal\u201d and \u201cspecific\u201d PCR primers were tested and optimized to target the peroxidase-catalase enzyme family, leading to the recovery of many known and novel Class II peroxidases. Thus, combining data from NGS based on metagenomics methods allowed a better understanding of the relative functional significance of the complex process of lignocellulolysis at the community level and candidate taxa and genes for targeted functional investigations are indicated."

Plots \u201c1\u201d of both sites were open canopy gaps with no pronounced decomposition activities, and served as control. Six soil cores (1.8 cm in diameter, 15 cm in depth) were sampled independently from each plot.

For the assignments the uclust consensus taxonomy assigner (default) option was used in QIIME pipeline. Final ITS and 16S OTUs were classified using BLASTn against curated databases derived from NCBI, JGI Greengenes, RDPII, SILVA (Maidak et\u00a0al., 2001; DeSantis et\u00a0al., 2006; Pruesse et\u00a0al., 2007; Werner et\u00a0al., 2012; Grigoriev et\u00a0al., 2014) and UNITE (Nilsson et\u00a0al., 2019). Additionally, for the taxonomic assignment of OTUs, pipelines such as MEGAN,1 USEARCH,2 and Mothur (mothur/mothur.github.io) were used. It is pointed out that although the length of the ITS sequences was not by itself adequate for safely assigning OTUs in genera, when combined with information obtained from the AA2-like gene sequences these limitations were mostly overcome."

Proteobacteria were the m\u03bfst abundant (mainly Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales, and Betaproteobacteriales) in all cases, equally distributed between seasons and plots but often at higher numbers on surface samples, while members of \u0392acteroidetes (Chitinophagales, Sphingobacteriales, Cytophagales, and Gemmatimonadales being the most prominent) were unequally distributed among plots and seasons. Appearing twice as many in Andros, Actinobacteria were almost evenly distributed in all depths and seasons of both forest soils (mostly represented by the orders Solirubrobacteriales, Gaiellales, Propionibacteriales, and Microtrihales). Acidobacteria were present in all sites of b\u03bfth forests and seasons (with a marked increase in the summer samples in Andros), while their abundance increased with depth. Most of them were unknown members and the rest belonged to the orders Solibacteriales, Pyrinomonadales, and Blastocatellales. Verrucomicrobia (mainly Chth\u03bfniobacteriales) were found in all samples, showing a marked increase in the summer samples of Andros, while they were clearly more frequent in the topsoil (appearing as \u201cb,c\u201d) in all plots of Andros and \u03a1arnitha. \u03a1lanctomycetes (mainly Tepidisphaerales) were present in both forests, in all soil depths, and in b\u03bfth seasons; they were frequent in the surface and topsoil layers, but showed fluctuations in their relative abundance in winter. Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, and Rokubacteria were present in all samples from both forests; however, their relative abundance was significantly lower in respect to the rest of the phyla detected, while their presence increased with depth in both sites and periods (Supplementary Figure S3B). Finally, Archaea were more abundant in Parnitha than in Andros. The distribution of the most abundant \u03bfrders of bacteria in each soil depth and season in Parnitha and Andros forests is presented in Figure\u00a0 2 (more details appear in Supplementary Table S4). By examining the pertinent data, it is apparent that certain bacteria genera are present at all plots and soil\nFIGURE\u00a01 \u0391 schematic presentation of the ancestral lignin peroxidase sequence with all amino acid residues important for the oxidization of substrates for heme Fe3+ binding and to the \u03972O2 across channel, as well as for Ca2+ binding and the formation of disulfide bonds (upper line).

More particularly, from the Proteobacteria: the uncultured; the Alphaproteobacteria, Reyanella, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, Phenylobacterium, and Rhodoplanes; the Betaproteobacteria Ellin6067 and the uncultured ferromanganous micronodule MND1; the Gammaproteobacteria Acidobacter and Prot IS-44; and from the other core phyla, the uncultured Actinobacteria and IMCC26256; the\nA\nB\nFIGURE\u00a02 Distribution of the most abundant orders of Bacteria per soil depth (a,b,c), sampling plot (1,2,3,4) and season (I = winter, II = summer) in Parnitha (A) and Andros (B) forests.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nuncultured Acidobacteria (subgroup\u00a06) and Candidatus Solibacter; the Verrucomicrobia Candidatus Udaeobacter and the uncultured Bacteroidetes, Terrinomonas, and Ferruginibacter (mainly in Parnitha). As regards the less abundant phyla, Chloroflexi KD4-96, Patescibacteria, uncultured Saccharimonadales and uncultured Gemmatimonadetes were detected in all plots, depths and seasons, while from the phylum Firmicutes, members of Bacillus were found in most cases. Several taxa, e.g., Acidobacteria RB41, Bryobacter, Candidatus Solibacter, and Haliangium (Deltaproteobacteria), were present in abundance in all Parnitha plots but were significantly less or absent from Andros plots, while Dongia (Alphaptoteobacteria) was abundant in Andros and was rarely found in Parnitha (only in the summer). Moreover, Actinobacteria, Nocardioides, Streptomyces, and Solirubrobacter were detected in high relative abundance in Andros, particularly in the winter, while the Mucilaginibacter (Bacteroidetes) was detected in high relative abundance, only in all Parnitha plots, in the summer. Several other genera were sporadically found in one or two plots in both sites (for details Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Figure S4).\nThe original 11,199,517 reads of the ITS2 fungal sequences formed a sub-sample of 11,048,938 reads, from which 94.85% could be\u00a0 definitely assigned to the kingdom Fungi, the respective communities in the two forests corresponded mostly to genera of Basidiomycota (67% of the reads) and Ascomycota (25%), while the rest of fungal phyla were present in low relative abundance (Supplementary Figure S3A). Basidiomycota and especially Agaricomycotina were predominant in most sampling plots and with higher relative abundance in Parnitha than in Andros. Their abundance increased with depth in both forests, reaching 71\u201382% in winter and 52\u201391% in summer in Parnitha, and 27\u201387% in the winter and 49\u201375% in the summer in Andros. On the surface samples of Parnitha the relative abundance of Basidiomycota decreased from ~54% in the winter to ~46% in the summer, whereas in Andros they followed the opposite trend showing a slight increase from winter t\u03bf summer. In both forests, the most frequent orders of Basidiomycota were Agaricales and Russulales, followed by Trechisporales, Sebacinales, and Thelephorales, with the addition of Boletales, Gomphales, Auriculariales, and Hysterangiales in Parnitha and Filiobasidiales, Cantharellales, and Tremellomycota (in the winter) for Andros (Figure\u00a03). Polyporales were invariably present in all soil samples of both forests, but as expected due to their wood-inhabiting \u2013 woodrotting nature, at low relative abundance (always below 0.5%, with the exception of plot \u03912, with almost 2%).\nAt the genus level, Russula, Sebacina, Cortinarius, Mycena, and Inocybe were the most abundant in Parnitha, whereas Russula, Tricholoma, Cortinarius, Inocybe and an undefined Thelephoraceae taxon were detected more often in several Andros plots (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figure S5). Mycena was found in high abundance in Parnitha only (P2\u00a0in winter and summer, P3\u00a0 in winter), while genera like Tricholoma, \u0399nocybe, Agaricus, Chaetomium, Cortinarius, Trechispora, a Trechisporales taxon, and Solicoccozyma (Tremellomycetes) appeared in several plots of both forests, at varying relative abundance (reaching 61%, e.g., Trechispora in \u03912; winter; Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figure S5). A small number of genera were detected in one Parnitha plot only but at high relative abundance, e.g., Clavariadelphus and Hebeloma (P3, summer; 35.47 and 10.85%, respectively), a Hysterangiales taxon (P2, summer; 9.31%), Boletus and Neoboletus (P1, summer; 21.68 and 16%,\nrespectively) and Gaestrum (\u03a14, winter; 21,46%). Similarly, \u0391manita (\u03911, winter; 3.44%), Vararia and Oidiodendron (A4, winter; 27.91 and 5.50%, respectively), and Tomentella (A2, summer; 8.54%) were detected at relatively high abundance in single plots in Andros.\nMembers of Ascomycota were found to be\u00a0at least twice as many in Andros in comparison with Parnitha. In both forests, the dominant orders were Hypocreales (varying from ~0.5 to 33.5%) and Sordariales (~0.2 to 45.9%), followed by Eurotiales (~0.5 to 15.6%), Helotiales (~3.4 to 16.4%), and Leotiomycetes, Pezizales, and Dothideomycetes in lower abundance. \u039fn the surface layers of Andros, Hypocreales (A3, winter), Sordariales (\u03912, winter), and Diaporthales were detected at much higher numbers (~30, 45.5, and 68.3%, respectively; Figure\u00a03). At the genus level, members of Penicillium were the most frequent \u03bfn almost all soils; however, they were drastically reduced in the topsoil samples of Parnitha, whereas they appeared in similar numbers in the topsoil samples in all Andros plots, reaching their highest abundance (30%) in the \u201cb\u201d layer in winter. Similarly, Chaetomium was abundant in most plots examined (all surface layers in winter, and two in summer, Al, A2) at a range of 0.12\u201324.50%. The rest of assigned genera were either abundant in a single plot (e.g., \u03911, winter, Coniella 33.19%; \u03913, winter, Ophiocordyceps 8.97% and Leptogium 6.44%; A4, summer, Metarhizium 12.34%) or present in only one forest at relative abundance from 0.35 to 5.50% (Andros: Oidiodendron, Geomyces, and Trichoderma; Parnitha: a Helotiales taxon, Coniochaeta, Tuber, Wilcoxina, and Desmazierella). Finally, the genus Preussia was present in four plots, i.e., \u03a11, \u03a12 and \u03a13\u00a0in winter, and P4\u00a0in summer at relative abundance 2.35, 3.95, 1.04 and 0.99%, respectively. \u0391ll other genera of ascomycetes were detected at very low frequencies (well below 0.5%; Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figure S5)."

            "text": "The strategy applied for the detection of AA2 peroxidases was based \u03bfn the construction of primers that would enable the amplification of sequences containing all (or combinations) of the four main residues, \u039537, \u039541, Wl71 and D183 of the ancestral \u03a1. chrysosporium LiPH8 peroxidase sequence (Ayuso-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2018) which was used as reference. The constructed primers (Supplementary Table S1; Figure\u00a01) were used in various combinations and preliminary amplicon sequencing allowed the qualification of combinations with best results. For example, primer pair lMF/1MR alone, or in combination with mnpunFl, resulted in preferential amplification of Polyporales, Russulales, and Hymenochaetales sequences but excluded Agaricales, which were abundant in soil samples under study. Moreover, Russulales sequences appeared to derive \u03bfnly from Stereum and the Polyporales sequences only from Ganoderma, a result that came in sharp contrast with the results from ITS sequencing and all subsequently used combinations. Similarly, single pair PCR reactions-any combination-with the specifically targeting AA2 peroxidases primer pairs peroxF/R gave low yields of mnp sequences (0.1\u20131.5%) in most samples, whereas nested PCR reactions provided significantly higher yields of mnp sequences. Thus, in the final approaches we\u00a0used nested PCR in which the 1st round included three primer pair combinations (perox3bF/perox3R, perox2F/peroxlR, and perox3aF/peroxlR), followed by a 2nd round with primer pair peroxlbF/peroxlR, hereafter referred to as peroxF/R (Figure\u00a01).\nFrontiers in Microbiology 08 frontiersin.org\nAltogether, with the use of simple and nested PCR primers that targeted \u0391\u03912 peroxidases we\u00a0amplified 4,423,453 reads, which after filtering remained 3,802,400 and were assigned to 338,271 OTUs (Supplementary Table S6). Since preliminary experiments with cDNA and the use of 1MF/1MR, mnpunlF/lMR and agarF/lMR primers, invariably resulted in few \u0391\u03912 peroxidases sequences and failed to obtain even the expected sequences from the known ITS fungal genera existing in the same samples, we\u00a0focused our efforts only on gDNA by using the peroxF/R primers in all subsequent analyses. The rarity of \u0391\u03912 sequences noted in cDNA samples underlines the difficulty of directly obtaining expressed \u0391\u03912 peroxidases gene sequences from soil. From the t\u03bftal 338,271 OTUs sequences with the peroxF/R primers only 19,166 OTUs were derived from cDNA, while the rest (319,105 OTUs) originated from gDNA amplifications. In general, the peroxF/R numbers of reads and OTUs were higher in Parnitha than in Andros, and in both forests the OTUs increased with depth in summer, in most plots, with a more marked effect in Andros. In both forests OTUs were higher at the surface samples during winter (Supplementary Table S6).\nBy using the automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation database dbCAN2, 1,634,172 reads were assigned t\u03bf 44,119 CAZymes OTUs, from which 1,424,474 reads and 15,287 OTUs could be\u00a0 definitely assigned to lignin degrading and auxiliary \u0391\u03912 peroxidase sequences. From the overall distribution of the CAZymes OTUs (Table\u00a01), it is apparent that the AA2 sequences are almost six times as many in Parnitha than in Andros, and that the majority of these peroxidases are MnPs, with VPs and LiPs detected in very low relative abundance (~2%). More importantly, a marked increase of AA2 sequences is observed in the topsoil samples (\u201cb,c\u201d) of both forests, particularly when nested PCR is used (Figure\u00a04). Taking into consideration that the \u0391\u03912 sequences in the Basidiomycota mock c\u03bfmmunity control (\u0392asK) were 26.81% and in the nested PCR\nsamples from Parnitha 35.35% (Table\u00a01B), our results strongly support that nested PCR is the preferred method, especially under the light that the obtained \u0391\u03912 sequences contained conserved sites that allowed discrimination to MnPs, LiPs and VPs.\nThe increase of AA2 peroxidase sequences observed in Parnitha topsoil samples is considerable since they reach abundance values as high as 98.10% (P2bc) compared with the 2.25% for the surface samples in summer, while in winter the respective results were 59.65 and 10.68%. Similar, albeit less marked, was the increase of AA2 peroxidases in Andros in the winter (1.88% for the surface and 3.35% for the topsoil samples) and summer seasons (22.49% for the surface and 58.26% for the topsoil samples; Table\u00a01). Notably, two Parnitha plots in summer (P1bc and P2bc), which were particularly rich in members of Agaricales, Russulales, and Hysterangiales according to the ITS data presented above, provided most of the AA2 and MnPs sequences in this forest. Accordingly, the richest \u2013 but at much lower abundance \u2013plots in Andros were A2 and A4, independently of season and soil layer. Among the other CAZymes that could be\u00a0safely assigned to a particular class, GT2, GT4 and GH3 classes were of particular interest since they were the most prevalent at all plots, soil layers and seasons for both forests, whereas GH127, GH2, CBM50, CBM2, CBM13 and CE1 classes (in this particular order) were found in lower numbers but in all plots and seasons for both forests. The fact that more than half of the reads and two thirds of the OTUs obtained with the peroxF/R primers were not directly associated with lignocellulose degradation (Figure\u00a04; Supplementary Table S6) indicates that the primers used were not restricted to the amplification of AA2 peroxidases and CAZymes only, but they could also amplify other enzymes putatively involved in degradation process, such as those listed in Supplementary Table S7 (only a small sample of the most abundant sequences is presented).\nA B\nFIGURE\u00a03 Distribution of the most abundant orders of fungi per soil depth (a,b,c), sampling plot (1,2,3,4) and season (I = winter, II = summer) in (A) Parnitha and (B) Andros forests.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org\nTo detect known and novel AA2 peroxidase sequences from the OTUs corresponding to Basidiomycota present in the two forests (ITS analyses), OTUs were clustered using a 97% \u201csequence identity criterion,\u201d and were identified by BLASTn and BLASTx tools against the custom database we\u00a0had constructed from sequences of complete basidiomycetes genomes deriving from NCBI, JGI, single entries and population studies. After placement to a particular group (MnPs, VPs, LiPs), multiple alignment followed and the sequences were phylogenetically placed in respective orders, genera or species. Not surprisingly, as the relative abundance of Polyporales found in the two forests was very low, very few LiPs were detected, which derived from two species only, i.e., Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Bjerkandera adusta (distributed to 17 different genes). On the contrary, the 164 VP-like OTUs derived from several genera like Bjerkandera, Cerrena, Hexagonia, Fomitiporia, Grifola, Ganoderma, Pleurotus and three unassigned/uncultured taxa (distributed to 23 different genes; Supplementary Figure S6).

            "text": "Soils are amongst the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems, densely populated by microbial communities that contribute to pivotal life functions like nitrogen and carbon cycling. Microorganisms in forest ecosystems show great dependance on several parameters like soil properties, type of vegetation, plant litter/residues, environmental\nconditions, geographic location, etc., all of which seriously affect the abundance and composition of fungal and bacterial communities (Baldrian et\u00a0al., 2012; Stursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2012; Urbanov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2015; Fierer, 2017; \u03a1rescott and Vesterdal, 2021). Although several attempts have been made to shed light onto the phylogeny, diversity, structure and function of forest soil microbiota (Fierer et\u00a0al., 2012; Stursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2012; Ding et\u00a0al., 2015; Urbanov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2015; Baldrian, 2017; Wilhelm et\u00a0al., 2019), pertinent knowledge still remains fragmented and limited due to the complexity and great variability encountered in such habitats. Moreover, most of relevant research is based on analyses of surface samples, and focuses on either bacteria or fungi, but rarely on both (Johnston et\u00a0al., 2016; Baldrian, 2017). Knowing that these hyper-diverse groups of microorganisms strongly depend on the substrate type and nutrients availability, we\u00a0were expecting that factors as the substrate, the vegetation and the local environmental conditions will influence their distribution. Therefore, the objective of this study was to (a) examine the abundance, composition and diversity of microorganisms in different soil layers of two \u2013 relatively undisturbed in terms of anthropogenic interference or from recent fires \u2013 forests dominated by either A. cephalonica or Q. ilex and located in continental or insular Greece, respectively, during two seasons (winter, summer), and (b) to record putative lignocelluloses degradation functions/activities with the use of specific primers.\nMicrobial communities in Mediterranean forests are often exposed to harsh conditions such as high temperatures, high doses of UV-light, low soil moisture content and nutrient availability, forcing them to adopt different strategies for survival. Surprisingly enough, information on the microbiome in such habitats is very scarce.

The distribution of the same enzyme sequences obtained by nested PCR reactions are also shown for comparison (C), while the significant increase of AA2 sequences with depth, in both forests, is shown in (D; examples: at summer, with depth, Andros; winter-summer, deeper samples, Parnitha),\nFrontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.org\ncontrary, numerous studies in other geographic locations around the globe have convincingly demonstrated the serious impact of all the above factors in shaping the respective microbial communities (O\u2019Brien et\u00a0al., 2005; Malik et\u00a0al., 2017; Tian et\u00a0al., 2017; DelgadoBaquerizo et\u00a0al., 2018). In our work, bacterial OTUs were twice as many in the oak forest of Andros island than in the mainland fir forest of Mt. Parnitha, while both forests shared the same core bacteria phyla, that accounted for more than 85% of the respective total diversity (Supplementary Figures S3A,B). However, important differences were recorded regarding the relative abundance of each phylum in each forest, which were more pronounced when orders richness and the diversity of genera were examined (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Figure S4), and probably reflect functional adaptations in the two ecosystems. In general agreement with the few existing studies on oak and pine forests in the Mediterranean area, our findings show that the same bacteria phyla were the predominant in forest soils in all localities examined, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria being always the most abundant, followed by Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes (Llad\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2017; Moroenyane et\u00a0al., 2018; Reis et\u00a0al., 2019; Lasa et\u00a0al., 2022). \u0399t could be\u00a0therefore tempting to attribute the observed similarities of bacteria phyla abundance to the generally similar climatic conditions in Mediterranean forests and the resilience that soil microbial communities have shown under such conditions (B\u00e9rard et\u00a0al., 2015; Ba\u00f1eras et\u00a0al., 2022). Since these findings largely differ from results obtained from similar habitats located at distant regions in N. America (Eichorst and Kuske, 2012), China (Ding et\u00a0al., 2015) or N. Europe (Kielak et\u00a0al., 2016; Herzog et\u00a0al., 2019), they can be\u00a0 considered as indicative of a particular type of bacterial phylogenetic clustering in Mediterranean forests. However, careful comparison of our results with those obtained from various other Mediterranean ecosystems, apart from the similarities they show to bacteria communities in Spanish forests (Goberna et\u00a0al., 2007; Siles and Margesin, 2016), they demonstrate marked differences in richness of core phyla in Israeli and Portuguese oak forests with Cloroflexi almost as abundant as the core phyla (Moroenyane et\u00a0al., 2018; Reis et\u00a0al., 2019), notably abundant Firmicutes and Patescibacteria in Italian forests (Bevivino et\u00a0al., 2014; Castronovo et\u00a0al., 2021), and abundant Firmicutes and Gemmatimonadetes in Israel (Moroenyane et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, all the above indicate a mixed profile of phylogenetically clustered core phyla and over-dispersed less abundant phyla for the Mediterranean soil bacterial communities. This is particularly clear when bacteria are examined at the genus level, since a few predominant genera of the core bacteria accounted for more than 85% of the total bacterial OTUs, while several other genera make sporadic appearances at particular sites or seasons, depending on the great variation that soil microenvironments demonstrate even at very small distances from each other (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Figure S4). Interestingly enough, the presence of Archaea in both forests was almost insignificant, in line with the findings of a study in Spain conifer forests (Lasa et\u00a0al., 2022). Similarly, the unknown/uncultured/ unassigned bacteria were 15\u201330% at all plots, in accordance with most reports on soil bacteria that failed to match any known taxa found in databases (Land et\u00a0al., 2015).\nThe composition and richness of most bacterial phyla in the mainland forest of Partnitha remained insensitive to season at all sampling sites, and only uncultured bacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were in higher numbers during the summer, and Acidobateria in the\nwinter. In the island forest of Andros, uncultured-and Alphaproteobacteria, as well as Actinobacteria and Chlor\u03bfflexi, were more abundant at all sites in the winter and Beta-Gamma-DeltaProteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes in the summer. Soil depth had a more pronounced effect since most bacteria phyla increased their presence in the topsoil samples (\u201cb,c\u201d), irrespective of the forest type, season or plot, displaying a readable genera diversity mainly for Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobateria and Actinobacteria at the periods of higher relative abundance. Our results are in agreement with other pertinent studies on Mediterranean forests (Bevivino et\u00a0al., 2014; Moroenyane et\u00a0al., 2018; Reis et\u00a0al., 2019; Castronovo et\u00a0al., 2021) and since Acidobacteria are good indicators of humid and Actinobacteria of dryer forests, they suggest that the observed distributions are most likely due to weather differences between the mainland forest (heavier precipitation) and the island forest (lower precipitation). At the same time the similarities in the occurrence of the core bacteria phyla observed in Mediterranean forests are considered to be\u00a0driven by their common functional role, i.e., in decomposing the tree litter (plant residues) and bioconverting complex organic compounds to provide plants with valuable substances (Fierer, 2017). Earlier reports considered members of Actinobacteria, Alpha-and Gamma-proteobacteria as the only bacteria involved in lignin-degradation (Bugg et\u00a0al., 2011; Saini et\u00a0al., 2015). However, numerous subsequent studies determined that laccases are the most abundant ligninolytic enzymes in bacteria, and genes coding for these enzymes could be\u00a0identified in members of Bacteroidetes, Beta-and Delta-proteobacteria, Firmicutes and possibly Acidobacteria (Wilhelm et\u00a0al., 2019; Kalam et\u00a0al., 2020). In that sense, it is particularly interesting to note the presence of many bacteria genera which possess genes related to (or associated with) lignocellulose degradation functions in both forests and at several plots (Supplementary Table S7), like lignin peroxidases (ligD from Pseudomonas fluorescens, ligI from Mycobacterium bevis, M. neworleance, M. kansasi and Mycolicibacterium terrea, ligB and ligF from Sphingobium sp. and Pantoea apista), vannilin dehydrogenases and vannilate O-demethylases (from Bradyrhizobium, Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and to a lesser extent from many other genera), a feruloyl-CoA synthase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis and a coniferyl aldehyde dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on single plots; altogether indicating that they play an important direct or indirect role in the decomposition of lignin (Granja-Travez et\u00a0al., 2020).\nExtended studies on various soil ecosystems across the globe have established that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are invariably the predominant fungal phyla (Baldrian et\u00a0al., 2012; Tedersoo et\u00a0al., 2014; Baldrian et\u00a0 al., 2022). As it was the case with bacteria, fungal abundance was strongly affected by soil structure and stratification, vegetation and climate, e.g., Ascomycota predominated in soils of several habitats in Italy and France (Orgiazzi et\u00a0al., 2013), or were found at equal rates with Basidiomycota in temperate soils of pine and deciduous forests (O\u2019Brien et\u00a0al., 2005), while the relative abundance of Basidiomycota was higher (53\u201359% vs. 25\u201341% for Ascomycota) in soils of oak and coniferous forests in various European countries (Baldrian et\u00a0 al., 2012; Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 et\u00a0 al., 2014; Kielak et\u00a0 al., 2016; Casta\u00f1o et\u00a0al., 2018; \u0160tursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2020). In our work, and for all soil samples from both forests, fungi quantitatively dominated bacteria, and members of Basidiomycota were recorded at higher than in other Mediterranean forests relative abundances (~67%), whereas\nFrontiers in Microbiology 12 frontiersin.org\nAscomycota (~25%) were detected at lower relative abundances (especially in the coniferous forest of Parnitha). Season exerted a similar effect on the main orders of Ascomycota in the two forests, i.e., Eurotiales were found at equal abundances, Sordariales, Pleosporales and Diaporthales were more abundant in winter, and Helotiales and Hypocreales were more abundant in summer. Since no xylariaceous Ascomycota were detected in the soils of both forests, and the rest of Ascomycota comprise a small part of soft-rot fungi with limited ability to degrade lignin, their role is considered as complementary to that of Basidiomycota that are the main wood-degraders (Liers et\u00a0al., 2011; Cragg et\u00a0al., 2015). The uniform presence of the cosmopolitan genus Penicillium at all plots, depths and seasons, and to a lesser extent of the genus Humicola, a Helotiales taxon and an unspecified Chaetomiaceae taxon, are in agreement with the results of other studies in Mediterranean forests (Rinc\u00f3n et\u00a0 al., 2015; Adamo et\u00a0 al., 2021; Hagenbo et\u00a0al., 2021). Moreover, in conjunction with the outcome of a metaproteomic study showing that the secreted enzymes of Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes dominated in a beech and conifer forest (Schneider et\u00a0al., 2012), it is further supported that these fungi play a key role in the degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses. However, it must be\u00a0pointed out that Trichoderma, Cladosporium and Alternaria, which were found in abundance in other Mediterranean forests, were detected only in small numbers in soils of both Greek forests (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figure S5). On the other hand, the exclusive presence of ascomycete genera like the mycorrhizal Oidiodendron in Andros and the endophyte Preussia, along with several other mycorrhizal generalists like Humaria, Otidea and Wilcoxina, ectomycorrhizae like Trichophaea, litter colonizers like Desmazierella, and the truffle and truffle-like Tuber and Geopora (all found at single soil plots in Parnitha), are highly indicative of the habitat-specific differences in respect to fungal communities, and probably reflect their complementarity to metabolic traits of Basidiomycetes (Krah et\u00a0al., 2015). On the contrary, the high abundance of entomopathogens like Metarhizium and Ophiocordyceps or of the plant pathogen Coniella at single plots could be\u00a0 considered as transfers from infected/dead insects or plants, in contrast to Coniochaeta species which attack wood and hence contribute to the degradation of lignocellulosics (MycoCosm, mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov).\nSix orders of Basidiomycota (i.e., Agaricales, Russulales, Sebacinales, Trechisporales, Thelephorales and Filobasidiales) accounted for more than 86% of the diversity in this phylum. Since results from control plots in both forests (open canopy gaps with no pronounced decomposition activities) were very similar with those obtained from all other plots, the possibility of overestimating the abundance of Basidiomycota can be\u00a0 excluded. The significant increase of Basidiomycota with soil depth in both forests, coupled with the markedly higher abundance of Ascomycota in Andros (mainly on surface samples), demonstrates the considerable variations in fungal distribution and composition among soil layers between the fir and oak forests, underlining at the same time the strong influence of soil stratification, vegetation and seasonality. This is further supported by the distinct differences observed regarding the distribution of genera of Basidiomycota, which were either quantitative (for the commonly found in both forests and at all plots Russula, Sebacina, Cortinarius, Inocybe and Trechispora), or qualitative for those found exclusively in all plots of one forest, for one season, e.g., Mycena in Parnitha and Tricholoma in Andros. Moreover, the strikingly strong dominance of\nseveral genera in few plots of either forest, underlined the important role of even small variations in soil constitution and is indicative of the plant-substrate specificity that has been established by fungal communities (Krah et\u00a0 al., 2015). This is rather anticipated since differences in the type of decomposing material shape the microbial communities and establish mutualistic relationships between plants and microorganisms as reported in pertinent studies on Mediterranean conifer and oak forests (Delgado-Baquerizo et\u00a0al., 2016; \u0160tursov\u00e1 et\u00a0al., 2020; Adamo et\u00a0al., 2021; Hagenbo et\u00a0al., 2021). In this respect, the high abundance of mycorrhizal taxa recorded in both forests of the present work is explained by the mutualistic relationships that have been developed between the Mediterranean trees, regularly suffering from water/heat stress, and their fungal partners, that help to alleviate/ mitigate drought repercussions (or to cope with other adverse environmental conditions; Mohan et\u00a0al., 2014). Thus, the dominance of mycorrhizal generalists like members of Russula, Sebacina, Cortinarius, and Inocybe in the soil layers of both forests, highlights the similarities with other Mediterranean conifer and oak forests (Orgiazzi et\u00a0al., 2013; Pecoraro et\u00a0al., 2014; Rinc\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2015; Casta\u00f1o et\u00a0al., 2018; Saitta et\u00a0al., 2018; Adamo et\u00a0al., 2021). At the same time the dominance of Hebeloma, Mycena, Clavariadelphus, Geastrum, Pseudotomentella in the fir forest of Parnitha, and Tomentella, Rhodocollybia and Lactarius in the oak forest of Andros, illustrate the differences of fungal mycorrhizal communities between the two sites. Similarly, the high abundance of the yeast genera Solicoccozyma and Saitozyma (Filobasidiales) in Andros, but not in Parnitha (present only at two plots in very low numbers) is noteworthy, while the widespread distribution of Mortierella (Mucoromycota) at all plots of both forests (particularly in winter) is probably due to its adaptation to degrade pectin, cellulose and hemicelluloses (Sista Kameshwar and Qin, 2019). Taking into consideration the aforementioned distribution of bacterial communities in the two forests and the AA2 peroxidases sequences recovered, it is likely that interactions among microorganisms may affect the fitness of either fungi or bacteria depending on whether the organisms possess the enzymes required to degrade lignin (mainly white-rot fungi) or hemicelluloses and cellulose (Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, Bacteria). Such effects have been demonstrated by secretome and transcriptomic studies on soil microbiomes (Kellner et al., 2014; Gruninger et\u00a0al., 2017; Moraes et\u00a0al., 2018; Peng et\u00a0al., 2018; Wymelenberg et\u00a0al., 2020).\nWe recorded in both forests a sequential succession of Ascomycota that colonize wood debris (leaves, twigs etc.) on the soil surface/ organic layer by Agaricomycetes that are the main decomposers in the deeper topsoil layer. This change in structure and distribution of fungal communities with soil depth and over the course of decomposition is to be\u00a0expected as the fast-growing ascomycetes and associated mitosporic fungi produce enzymes able to depolymerize cellulose and hemicelluloses, leading to rapid loss of wood rigidity, but can only weakly affect lignin, while Agaricomycetes and in particular white-rot fungi are the principal lignin degraders (Schneider et\u00a0 al., 2012; Cragg et\u00a0 al., 2015; Baldrian, 2017). Not surprisingly, in direct correlation to the relative abundance of basidiomycetes in the topsoil samples of both forests (as revealed by ITS2 analyses), the targeted PCR AA2 peroxidase sequences obtained in this study were assigned to these particular fungi (Table\u00a0 1, Supplementary Figures S6, S7). Similarly, the recovery of GT2, GT4 and GH3 CAZymes classes as the most prevalent in both forests, at all plots, soils layers and seasons, along with GH127, GH2, CBM50,\nFrontiers in Microbiology 13 frontiersin.org\nCBM2, CBM13, and CE1 (at lower abundance) is expected since the first group of the aformentioned enzymes are present in all predicted proteomes of 103 representative fungi examined \u2013mainly Ascomycota and Basidiomycota- and the second group, in most genomes (70\u2013103) of those same fungi, all in multiple gene copies (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2013). The AA2 peroxidases sequences from the topsoil layers of Parnitha soils were recovered in strikingly high numbers, and corresponded to 59.62% of the totally obtained OTUs in winter and up to 98.10% (in one plot) in summer. As the number of published fungal genomes increases rapidly, detailed comparative genome analyses of wooddecaying basidiomycetes with emphasis on species of Agaricomycetes have shown that these fungi excrete a large range of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes for the degradation of lignocellulosics. White-rot fungi possess combinations of AA2 genes (MnPs, VPs and LiPs) while brown-rot fungi completely lack these genes (Floudas et\u00a0al., 2012; Ruiz-Due\u00f1as et\u00a0al., 2013; Riley et\u00a0al., 2014; Nagy et\u00a0al., 2016; Floudas et\u00a0 al., 2020; Miyauchi et\u00a0 al., 2020; Ruiz-Due\u00f1as et\u00a0 al., 2021). Furthermore, when sequences of AA2 genes from the available white-rot fungi genomes are carefully analyzed, it becomes evident that the known lignin-degrading subsets of LiPs and VPs are very limited (and only few of them are functionally characterized), while the majority AA2 shareholders are MnPs, which are abundant in all genomes and present in many isozyme forms. Thus, in view of the rarity of characterized LiP sequences for most members of Polyporales, and the low relative abundance of members of this particular order in our samples, the recovery of such sequences was limited to 17 genes, derived only from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Bjerkandera adjusta (Supplementary Figure S6A). Similarly, the 164 VP-like sequences that we\u00a0analyzed corresponded to 23 genes of eight species (seven of the order Polyporales and one of the order Agaricales) along with three sequences that contained the characteristic residues for VPs, but showed lower identity levels in comparison with known genome sequences (denovo134619, placed as Agaricomycetes; denovo181710, placed as uncultured Trametes or Dichotomus; and denovo233737 with the Trp residue one amino acid downstream of its position on the typical VP sequence, possibly indicating low enzyme activity; Supplementary Figure S6B).\nConiferous and angiosperm wood is composed by the same main constituents, i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, but they differ significantly not only in the relative quantities of these components, but more importantly in their particular structure. Especially hemicelluloses are highly heterogeneous polysaccharides with complex molecular structures, consisting of neutral sugars with a \u03b2-1,4 backbone (glucose, xylose, mannose), decorated with an array of other sugars (arabinose, galactose) and uronic acid substitutions, and can be\u00a0chemically modified by acetylation (Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010). In oaks, hemicelluloses are rich in xylan and contain small amounts of glucomannan, while in conifers they contain small amounts of xylan and acetylated galactoglucomannans (Busse-Wicher et\u00a0 al., 2016). The adjustment of the type and composition of hemicelluloses in the course of evolution of these plants is a way to control the mechanical properties of secondary cell walls; at the same time it provides the background for the co-evolution and adaptation of wood-decaying fungi to the chemical composition of their growth substrate (Ayuso-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2019). As a consequence, most species of wood-decaying fungi exhibit a characteristic preference for either conifers or hardwoods (Hibbett and Donoghue, 2001; Krah et\u00a0al., 2015). Data on the evolution of lignin-degrading enzymes show\nthat MnPs were the first enzymes evolved from a single generic peroxidase-encoding gene, and with subsequent gene duplications, mutations, etc., an array of peroxidase subfamilies appeared, the most recent of which are VPs and LiPs, which could be\u00a0detected in white-rot Agaricomycetes only (Floudas et\u00a0al., 2012). Thus, it is not surprising that we\u00a0have recorded a wealth of known and unknown or related to a genus or family fungal MnPs (denovo sequences, Supplementary Figure S7). In addition, the outcome of a recent study, based on comparative genomics of Agaricomycetes, led to the phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of class II peroxidases, showing that MnPs exist in at least five orders, i.e., Agaricales, Polyporales, Corticiales, Hymenochaetales and Russulales, and that the early-diverging lineages of Cantharelalles, Sebacinales and Dacryomycetes all lack AA2s (Nagy et\u00a0al., 2016). Our results clearly suggest that orders of Phallomycetidae should also be\u00a0added to the aforementioned groups since the MnP sequences we\u00a0found in most abundance derived from genera related to Hysterangiales (a Hysterangiales taxon, from a single site), Gomphales (Gautieria, Gomphus, Ramaria), Geastrales (Geastrum), and the Phallomycetidae Insertae Sedis Sclerogaster (NCBI Taxonomy). Further, the recovery of MnPs from several different genera of Russulales, Hymenochaetales, Agaricales, and Polyporales, irrespective of their abundance in soil samples, strongly indicates that the set of primers used in this work in nested PCR is highly efficient for the recovery of AA2 enzymes from all fungi possessing such genes. Although it was previously thought that Agaricales lack LiP with the characteristic amino acid residues of the white-rot Polyporales, such molecule was recently detected in Agrocybe, albeit of the lower enzymatic activity due to the differentiation of the neighboring residues (S\u00e1nchez-Ruiz et\u00a0al., 2021). This novel finding combined with the numerous peroxidase sequences recorded in this work, show that there is still plenty to discover about Class II peroxidases, and that genomic, metagenomic and transcriptomic approaches will certainly pave the way to uncover novel lignin degrading enzymes in the quest of effective renewable energy solutions."

Although the same core bacteria phyla, i.e., Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes, were present in both forests, they differed significantly both quantitatively and qualitatively. Archaea were detected in very low numbers. Similarly, Basidiomycota (~67%) and Ascomycota (~25%) were the most abundant fungi with Agaricales, Russulales, Sebacinales, Trechisporales, Thelephorales (Basidiomycota) and Eurotiales, Sordariales, Pleosporales, Helotiales, and Diaporthales (Ascomycota) being the most abundant in the two forests, again showing significant differences in their distribution depending on forest, depth and season. The constructed primers aiming to amplify Class II peroxidases succeeded in the recovery of many gene sequences, which through phylogenetic comparisons were shown to belong to known (LiPs), and to both known and unknown genes of VPs and MnPs. An abundance of Phallomycetidae (Hysterangiales, Gomphales,\nFrontiers in Microbiology 14 frontiersin.org\nGeastrales) novel gene sequences were discovered along with those from Polyporales, Agaricales, Russulales, and Hymenochaetales. Non-specific sequences obtained from bacteria with the same primers indicated that they may play an important direct or indirect role in the decomposition of lignin."
