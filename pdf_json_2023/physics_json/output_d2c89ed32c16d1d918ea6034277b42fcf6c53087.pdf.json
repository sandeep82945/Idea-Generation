    "abstractText": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are oxidative enzymes that help break down lignocellulose, making them highly attractive for improving biomass utilization in industrial biotechnology. The catalytically essential N-terminal histidine (His1) of LPMOs is post-translationally modified by methylation in filamentous fungi to protect them from auto-oxidative inactivation, however, the responsiblemethyltransferase enzyme is unknown. Using mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics in combination with systematic CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening in Aspergillus nidulans, we identify the N-terminal histidine methyltransferase (NHMT) encoded by the gene AN4663. Targeted proteomics confirm that NHMT was solely responsible for His1 methylation of LPMOs. NHMT is predicted to encode a unique seventransmembrane segment anchoring a soluble methyltransferase domain. Colocalization studies show endoplasmic reticulum residence of NHMT and coexpression in the industrial production yeastKomagataella phaffiiwith LPMOs results in His1 methylation of the LPMOs. This demonstrates the biotechnological potential of recombinant production of proteins and peptides harbouring this specific post-translational modification.",

Olsen 1\nLytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are oxidative enzymes that help break down lignocellulose, making them highly attractive for improving biomass utilization in industrial biotechnology. The catalytically essential N-terminal histidine (His1) of LPMOs is post-translationally modified by methylation in filamentous fungi to protect them from auto-oxidative inactivation, however, the responsiblemethyltransferase enzyme is unknown. Using mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics in combination with systematic CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening in Aspergillus nidulans, we identify the N-terminal histidine methyltransferase (NHMT) encoded by the gene AN4663. Targeted proteomics confirm that NHMT was solely responsible for His1 methylation of LPMOs. NHMT is predicted to encode a unique seventransmembrane segment anchoring a soluble methyltransferase domain. Colocalization studies show endoplasmic reticulum residence of NHMT and coexpression in the industrial production yeastKomagataella phaffiiwith LPMOs results in His1 methylation of the LPMOs. This demonstrates the biotechnological potential of recombinant production of proteins and peptides harbouring this specific post-translational modification.\nProtein methylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) widely utilized to regulate DNA transcription via the modification of histones at lysine and arginine residues in eukaryotic organisms, constituting the primary component of the so-called \u201chistone code\u201d1. Histidine methylation of proteins was recently described in mammalian cells targeting highly abundant actin proteins and its primary function has been suggested to moderately regulate actin filament2. More recently, the human methyltransferases METTL9 and METTL18 have demonstrated histidine methylation activity. METTL9 was shown to mediate ubiquitous histidine methylation in mammalian proteomes3, whereas METTL18 was shown to be a histidine-specific methyltransferase that specifically targets 60 S ribosomal protein L3 and affects ribosome biogenesis and function4. Histidine N-methyltransferase activity has developed on both SET2 and seven-\u03b2-strand domain containing(4) class of methyltransferases. Histidine methylation5,6 on fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) is particularly unique as this methylation occurs only on the N-terminal histidine that is part of the conserved active site7. LPMOs are a class of oxidative enzymes found widely in nature. They have broad substrate specificity towards complex polysaccharides, including lignocellulose8,9. Cellulose-specific LPMOs are used commercially for the conversion of plant biomass to biofuels10.\nReceived: 6 December 2022\nAccepted: 29 June 2023\nCheck for updates\n1The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark. 2Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. 3TheNovoNordisk FoundationCenter for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. 4Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark. 5These authors contributed equally: Tanveer S.

A defining feature of all LPMOs is their N-terminal histidine, which is crucial for copper binding and enzyme activity. It is this N-terminal histidine residue that is methylated on its imidazole nitrogen (\u03c4-methylation of N\u03b52, Fig. 1A). This PTM prevents protonation of theHis1 side chain, and it hasbeen demonstrated that it protects the critical active site of the enzyme from oxidative damage11. Although X-ray crystallography has shown methylation of the N-terminal histidine in several fungal LPMOs8,12, the methyltransferase responsible for this modification remains unknown.\nIn this study, we used state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics in combination with a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout strategy to identify and characterize a previously undescribed N-terminal histidine methyltransferase (NHMT) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. We demonstrate that this enzyme is solely responsible for the unique His1 methylation of LPMOs in A. nidulans. The methyltransferase is predicted to contain a unique seven helical transmembrane domain and a soluble catalytic domain."

            "text": "Shortlisting N-terminal histidine methylation candidates using bioinformatics and a quantitative proteomics screen To identify and shortlist NHMT candidates, a large-scale quantitative proteomics screen was performed to identify differentially expressed cellular proteins of cells grown on different carbon sources (Fig. 1B). This strategy was based on the hypothesis that NHMT candidates are co-expressed with methylated LPMO substrates, specifically growth conditions in which the LPMO is needed for polysaccharide conversion, such as when A. nidulans is grown with cellulose as an additional carbon source.\nDifferential protein expression analysis of A. nidulans cells grown with the different carbon sources was accomplished through a combination of single-shot label-free quantification (LFQ) and tandem mass tag (TMT)-labelled multiplexed in-depth quantitative massspectrometry. Additionally, we performed deep proteome sequencing for A. nidulans, identifying almost 7000 protein groups and generating the largest dataset of filamentous fungal proteins to date (Supplementary Data 1).\nOver 200 histidine methylation sites were identified in the proteomics dataset, four of which were localized to N-terminal histidines on fourdifferentproteins (SupplementaryData 2).MaxQuant software13 was utilized for the identification of methylated histidine residues within peptides by allowing a variable methyl modification (mass addition of 14.0156Da) on histidine residues, thereby enabling the Andromeda search algorithm to look for this mass shift within the peptide fragment spectra (MS/MS). Furthermore, a methylated histidine-specific diagnostic immonium ion of m/z 124.0869 was defined to assist in the high-confidence localization of methylated histidines14. The four UniProt identifiers found to contain N-terminally histidine methylated proteins were C8V530, Q5B1W7, Q5AU55, and Q5B428. C8V530 (gene ID AN10419), is classified as a member of the Auxiliary Activity Family 9 (AA9) of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs, Supplementary Table 1)15\u201317. Q5B1W7 (AN5463) plays a crucial role in starch degradation18, and similarly classified as AA13 family of copper-dependent LPMOs shown to be active on starch19 (Supplementary Table 2). Q5AU55 (AN4702) is structurally similar to an AA11-type LPMO from A. oryzae. Lastly, Q5B428 (AN8175) is highly homologous to an LPMO-like protein from Laetisaria arvalis (termed LaX325), part of the recently defined protein family \u201cX325\u201d that are found to be widespread in the fungal kingdom but have deviated evolutionary and do not perform oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides20. All four of these LPMO-related proteins contain a secretion signal peptide prior to the N-terminal histidine of the processed proteins.\nTo identify NHMT candidates, relative protein abundances in cells grown on glucose-containing media (minimal media with glucose or\npotato dextrose) were compared with those in cells grown with the addition of cellulose. More specifically, we utilized a two-sided t-test with permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 on log2-fold changes of protein intensity values between growth conditions to determine statistically significant protein abundance differences. This was visualized in a volcano plot of the log2-fold protein changes between two conditions on the x-axis and t-test based statistics on the y-axis; we focused on proteins with putativemethyltransferase activity that exhibited differential abundances when grown on differentmedia (Fig. 1C). To bioinformatically determine whether a protein is a methyltransferase in the A. nidulans (Emericella nidulans) UniProt protein sequence database, we utilized a combination of Interpro16, Pfam17, PROSITE21 and gene ontology protein sequence annotations that predicted S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases, domains, activity, or other related SAM annotations. From this, wemanually curated 225 potentialmethyltransferases in the A. nidulans FASTA protein sequence database (SupplementaryData 3). The proteomics analysis of A. nidulans identified 120 of the 225 candidate methyltransferases, and 41 of these displayed statistically significant higher abundance when A. nidulans cells were cultured on the growth media containing cellulose compared to only glucose or potato dextrose (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Data 4). Seven of the 41 methyltransferases were eliminated due to their prediction (based on combined annotations) as methyltransferases with oxygen as the acceptor atom insteadof nitrogen. Additionalmethyltransferaseswere eliminated due to the existence of homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Komagataella phaffii as these organisms are incapable of performing theN-terminal histidinemodification of LPMOs.Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that 19 of the remaining methyltransferases appeared to be unique among fungi known to encode for LPMOs (Supplementary Data 4). To identify the hitherto unknown NHMT enzyme responsible for N-terminal methylation of LPMOs in filamentous fungi, systematic CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout screening was carried out on the 19 candidates in A. nidulans (Fig. 1D). Another five manually curated methyltransferases that lacked homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Komagataella phaffii were included. Of the 24 candidates, 22 were successfully knocked out and assayed for NHMT activity.\nCRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening of 22 methyltransferase candidate genes coupled with targeted MS analysis of LPMO methylation status To precisely and efficiently knock out each of the 22 genes by CRISPR/Cas9, we designed guide RNAs for each candidate and used a Cas9-expressing A. nidulans strain deficient in the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair, ensuring high-fidelity genome editing through homologous recombination22,23. CRISPR/Cas9mediated gene knockouts were confirmed by diagnostic PCR and to analyse the effect of the individual knockouts on N-terminal histidine methylation, we developed a targeted proteomics assay based on parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to specifically monitor and quantify the native N-terminally histidine methylated A. nidulans peptide sequences identified in the proteome analysis (Fig. 2A). Of the four N-terminal histidinemethylated protein sequences detected in the large-scale proteomics screening, we ultimately selected the most abundant His1 methylated peptide corresponding to ([meth] HTVIVYPGYR) from the uncharacterized X325 LPMO-like protein Q5B428 (encoded by the gene AN4702). We selected this protein because its N-terminal histidine methylated peptide ([meth]HTVIVYPGYR) was reproducibly detected in rapid single-shot PRM-MS proteomics analysis (Fig. 2B). We simultaneously targeted the unmethylated peptide (HTVIVYPGYR) in the same PRM assay. The unambiguous observation of the non-methylated Q5B428 N-terminal peptidewas required to constitute aNHMThit in individual knockout strains (Fig. 2B).

As we were unable to test 2 knockout candidates for activity, we cannot say with certainty that they would not have influenced the methylation status of N-terminal histidine residues. Nonetheless, the knockout of the gene encoding for AN4663 (corresponding to the UniProt identifier Q5B467 abolished N-terminal histidine methylation on the monitored methylated peptide and\nhistidine methylated and unmethylated HTVIVYPGYR peptide in reference strain (top) and AN4663 knockout strain (bottom).

Despite low amino acid identity (22.6%), sequence alignment of AN4663 C-terminal domain (236-493) to the SpdS-like domain (236-493) of the humaneukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha N-terminal methyltransferase (METTL13)26 identified a conserved glutamic acid at position 340 (E340) which is required for the binding of the co-substrate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) but not the catalytic activity of methyltransferases27. Activity of NHMT was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of this glutamic acid to an alanine (E340A) in A. nidulans. This E340A mutation resulted in the complete loss of N-terminal histidine methylation, similar to AN4663 gene knockout (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 5). Furthermore, chimeric constructs consisting of an mRFP fluorescence tag fused to the C-terminal of the NHMT greatly diminished N-terminal histidine methylation but not whenmRFPwas fused to theN-terminus of NHMT (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 5), suggesting that the C-terminal mRFP tag interferes with the NHMTs catalytic activity or alternatively impair correct subcellular localization. Collectively, these data confirm that AN4663, henceforth denoted as nhmT when referring to the gene locus, encodes the specific and sole NHMT enzyme in A. nidulans responsible for N-terminal histidine methylation of coexpressed LPMOs.\nStructural prediction and sequence analysis supports NHMT activity and predicts a unique transmembrane domain The AlphaFold2 predicted model of the NHMT structure proposes an N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1-215) and a soluble region containing the MTase domain (residues 216-558), complimenting the PSIPRED analysis (Fig. 3B). The predicted model of the soluble MTase domain suggests that NHMT is a member of the 7BS family of methyltransferase with a predicted substrate-binding cavity that is large enough to accommodate the co-substrate SAM with a potential entry pathway that could theoretically allow access for the substrate N-terminal histidine (Fig. 3B, C). Although the AlphaFold2 predicts the structure with high confidence (Supplementary Fig. 4), it is only a prediction and therefore cautionmust be taken as the limited predictive modeling is done without substrates or co-factors.\nAN4663 is annotated as member of the spermidine synthase (SpdS) family of proteins based on sequence homology28. This is to be expected as spermidine synthases andmethyltransferases have similar protein structures, sequence features, and catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to their respective substrates29. As these annotations are linked to enzyme activity based on observed studies, proteins with similar sequences yet distinct activities can be mis-annotated due to a lack of experimental evidence. Sequence alignment of the NHMT catalytic domain using BLAST revealed a single amino acid variance within a conserved motif that could separate the NHMT catalytic domain from spermidine synthases. Specifically, spermidine synthases require either an aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) in theGxG(D/E)G motif to bind decarboxylated SAM within the extended catalytic pocket (Fig. 3C, D, Supplementary Fig. 5D)30\u201332. However, sequence alignment of the NHMT catalytic pocket revealed that isoleucine at residue position 322 (I322) replaces the D or E in this motif (Fig. 3C, D, Supplementary Fig. 5).\nLastly, interrogation of the NHMT transmembrane domain (1-215) sequence and predicted structure suggests a unique 7TM domain.\nSearching the AlphaFold2 predicted 7TM domain model against the DALI server33 only resulted in low scoring matches to proteins without 7TM domains (Supplementary Fig. 6C). UniProt BLAST search of the 7TM domain (1-215) resulted in 452 matches to homologous 7TM domains containing proteins exclusively to organisms within the filamentous Ascomycota subphylum pezizomycotina expect for one unclassified fungal organism (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. 5B). This analysis revealed ~97% of the matches are single copy genes within their respective organisms. Moreover, all of the 452 matching transmembrane domain sequences were linked to soluble domains that contain a highly conserved segment 389-394 uniquely found in proteins with the NHMT 7TM domain (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 6B).\nNHMT resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and methylates N-terminal histidines of secreted LPMOs The LPMOs identified to date are typically secreted outside of the cell by their host organism. Furthermore, all four proteins detected with N-terminal histidine methylation in our proteomics dataset are encoded with a signal peptide, indicating processing through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To determine its role in the histidine methylation capacity of NHMT, we examined the importance of its putative NHMT seven-transmembrane region (positions 1-224) by generating a truncated variant NHMT225-559 that was lacking the first 224 amino acids. Expression of this variant resulted in elimination of the N-terminal histidine methylation with concomitant appearance of the unmodified version as measured by the PRM assay, indicating that the transmembrane region is critical for its activity (Fig. 4A, B, Supplementary Data 5). We also performed cellular co-localization imaging by fluorescencemicroscopy using the functional chimera with an mRFP tag fused to the N-terminal of full length NHMT alongside a positive ER marker, the fluorescent organelle probe DiOC6\n34 (Fig. 4C). We utilized cytosolic mRFP as a negative ER membrane control (Fig. 4D), and anmRFP taggedmannosyltransferase (AN10118, UniProt entry C8VRA6) involved in protein glycosylation was used as a positive ER localization control35. The imaging analysis revealed high colocalization of all mRFP-tagged NHMT constructs with the ER membrane control protein, supporting subcellular localization of NHMT in the ER (Fig. 4C, D).\nRecombinant methylation of LPMOs by NHMT in the yeast Komagataella phaffii To test NHMTactivity and determine its biotechnological potential for recombinant N-terminal histidine methylation, we co-expressed NHMT together with a fungal AA9A LPMO from Lentinus similis (LsAA9A, UniProt accession A0A0S2GKZ1 or a bacterial AA10 LPMO from Thermobifida fusca (TfAA10A, UniProt accession Q47QG3 in the yeast protein production host Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), which does not present any endogenous N-terminal histidine activity. The full-length nhmT sequence from A. nidulans was codonoptimized and expressed without introns in K. phaffii. We tested three different secretion peptide sequences for LPMO translocation through the ER using LsAA9A as themethylation substrate (Fig. 5A). Thesewere the native LsAA9A signal peptide, the \u03b1-amylase (AmySP) secretion sequence from A. niger termed \u201cAmy\u201d36, and the alpha-mating factor (\u03b1-MF) secretion signal leader peptide from S. cerevisiae37,38. LsAA9A expression and activity were confirmed both with and without coexpression of NHMT (Fig. 5B). LsAA9A was secreted into the supernatant with all three signal peptides (Supplementary Figs. 7\u20139). However, correct signal peptide processing was only observed and confirmed by LC/MS/MS when using the native or the Amy signal peptide (Supplementary Data 6, Supplementary Fig. 10). We were able to conclusively confirm the N-terminal histidine methylation of LsAA9A upon co-expression with NHMT by using tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. The histidine methylated N-terminal LsAA9A peptide was identified with high confidence and complete amino acid\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4202 5\nFig. 3 | Domain, structure, and phylogenetic prediction from the sequence of NHMT.

Interestingly, we did not detect histidine methylation by MS when the signal peptide was not cleaved at the correct position N-terminal to the histidine as in the case of using the \u03b1-MF as the signal peptide sequence, which resulted in anN-terminally extended LsAA9A harbouring an additional amino acid N-terminal to the histidine with no detectable methylation. This suggests that N-terminal histidine methylation occurs only after precise signal peptide cleavage. We quantified the degree of N-terminal histidine methylation to be ~30% of the identified tryptic LsAA9A N-terminal peptide when co-expressed with NHMT (Fig. 5C, D). TfAA10A was similarly found to be secreted into the supernatant when the sequence was expressed with the Amy signal peptide (Supplementary Fig. 11). Furthermore, we found an average of 15% N-terminal histidine methylation of TfAA10A (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Data 6). These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to engineer a heterologous expression host for specific methylation of N-terminal histidine residues on different protein targets."

            "text": "In this study, we have identified the NHMT enzyme, which is encoded by the nhmT (AN4663) gene and solely responsible for N-terminal histidine methylation of LPMOs. This was accomplished through a combination of in-depth proteomics, bioinformatics, and systematic CRISPR/Cas9 facilitated gene knockouts. The proteomics analysis identified close to 7000A. nidulans protein groups, generating the largest dataset of filamentous fungal proteins to date. Quantitative proteomics analysis of A. nidulans cells grown on different carbon sources further enabled us to shortlist potential NHMTcandidates that were subsequently selected for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts. We developed a targeted proteomics assay monitoring the methylation state of N-terminal histidine containing peptides from expressed LPMOs to determine the effect of these knockouts and ultimately identified the putative NHMT candidate.\nThe NHMT enzyme shares a seven-\u03b2-strand fold in the soluble domain similar to humanhistidinemethyltransferases such asMETTL9 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9H1A3), METTL18 (https:// www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O95568), and the human N-terminal methyltransferase METTL13 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/ Q8N6R0). Uniquely, NHMT contains an N-terminal seven-transmembrane domain with little structural similarities compared to known membrane proteins in the PDB database. Based on our experimental data, the transmembrane domain is required for the NHMTs specific activity in the context of N-terminal histidine methylation of secreted LPMOs. The sequence of the 7TMregion is unique to filamentous fungi and similar sequences are primarily found as single copies in the genomes of filamentous fungi, suggesting distinct phylogeny of the enzyme.\nLoss of the N-terminal histidine methylation due to transmembrane truncation could be due to the loss of co-localization with its substrate proteins that require signal peptide cleavage through the ER for secretion. Co-localization imaging suggested that NHMT is indeed located in the ER, providing further supportof this theory.Moreover, it is also plausible that the transmembrane region of NHMT is important for trafficking to the ER membrane, correct protein folding and putative oligomeric assembly39. The transmembrane region might harbour sites for lipid specific interactions, which could be necessary for its specificity towards N-terminal histidine residues. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction (but not a complete loss) of methylation activity upon the addition of an mRFP-tag to the C-terminus of the NHMT, suggesting loss of catalytic function or substrate recognition. This could be due to issues related to protein translocation, insertion, or orientation in the membrane. It is also possible that the mRFP tag could prevent access of substrate proteins to into the\ncatalytic NHMT pocket, inhibiting the transfer of the methyl group from SAM.\nThediscovery ofNHMTprompted co-expressionwith LPMOs inK. phaffii, leading to the demonstration of recombinant N-terminal histidine protein methylation in a heterologous host that is not a filamentous fungus. Futureeffortswill be directed towards optimizing the co-expression of the NHMT and its targeted substrates to increase methylation stoichiometry, for example, by testing NHMT homologs from other fungi and integrating the corresponding genes into the K. phaffii genome together with different substrate-encoding genes. Another limitation couldbedue to the limited availability of SAM in the ER, as recent plant research has demonstrated that SAM transporters across the Golgi apparatus are required for the efficientmethylation of polysaccharides40. Optimization of these transporters in the ER might be similarly required in K. phaffi to increase the methylation yields on N-terminal histidine residues of proteins such as LPMOs. The findings presented here demonstrate a potential to generate recombinant proteins with methylated N-terminal histidines, which could enable further investigations into the role of this modification in LPMO function and activity. N-terminal histidinemethylation could also have potential applications beyond LPMOs, in the production of different classes of pharmaceutical proteins and peptide hormones such as incretins, where methylation of the terminal histidine of GLP-1 for example, may incur protease protection to plasma dipeptidyl peptidase-441,42.\nThis study also highlights the power of combining large-scale quantitative proteomics with a systematic CRISPR editing screen of specific enzyme classes for discovering novel biology in organisms such as the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. Filamentous fungi play a crucial role in the degradation of biopolymers and thereby the recycling of organic matter, enabled by the secretion of a battery of enzymes. These enzymes are best known for their roles in biomass degradation that has been exploited in biotechnological and industrial settings10. Exploring and characterizing fungal enzymeswill thus affect a broad number of bio-based industries. The results presented here pave the way for further proteomics investigations into the diverse phyla of the fungal eukaryotic kingdom, aimed at the discovery of novel PTMs thatmay lead to thediscoveryof uniqueprotein attributes."

The strain contained a mutation in the gene encoding ornithine transcarbamylase (argB2) of the arginine biosynthesis pathway, which is utilized as selection in transformations via the auxotrophic growth requirement of arginine. Deletion of nkuA\u0394 eliminates to a large extent, the activity of the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair mechanism and forces repair to take place through homologous recombination to promote gene targeting23. NID2531 is derived from the wild-type strain FGSC A4, which was used for the initiating Aspergillus nidulans proteome experiment. Spore production for inoculations and strain validation were produced in solid minimal medium (MM: 2% agar, 1% glucose, 1 x nitrate salt solution, 0.001% thiamine, 1 x trace metal solution)43,44, which was supplemented with 4 mM L-arginine when required.\nThe parent strain used for engineering and protein production was Komagataella phaffii GS115 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which has a mutation in the his4 gene, rendering the strain unable to produce histidine. All plasmids employed for genomic integration contain the HIS4 gene for complementation of the his4 gene in the parent strain. Transformants are plated on selective medium lacking histidine.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4202 9\nDNA fragment and plasmid constructions in A. nidulans and K. phaffii Fragments constructed by PCR were made as described previously in ref. 23 and CRISPR-Cas9 vectors were assembled by USER fusion45. The vectors for K. phaffii expression were constructed by LyGo cloning as described in Hern\u00e1ndez-Roll\u00e1n et al.36, and by USER fusion as described previously in ref. 46. Primers and synthetic gene fragments were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), and are listed in Supplementary Table 6. The synthetic gene AN4663 used for expression in K. phaffii is listed in Supplementary Notes 3. All PCR fragments for cloning and plasmids were purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and GenEluteTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Merck), respectively, and the vector assemblies were confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics, Germany).\nAll deletions and codon substitutions in A. nidulans were enabled by the oligonucleotide-mediated gene-editing procedure described previously in ref. 23, except for the length of the geneediting oligonucleotides which was 60 nucleotides instead of 90. All CRISPR/Cas9-vectors and expression vectors were assembled via uracil excision-based cloning (USER), as described previously in ref. 23. All CRISPR/Cas9 vectors were based on pFC331 as the recipient vector22, andwere composed by one ormore single guide RNAs flanked by tRNAs. All PCRs for DNA-fragment construction in A. nidulans engineering were done as described previously in ref. 23. The expression vector for insertion into integration site 5 (IS5) was established in pU0002 as described previously in ref. 47 with a recreated PacI/Nt.BbvCI USER cassette between the targeting sequences of 1.0 kbmatching IS5 for cloning of promoter Ptef1, gene fragment, and terminator Ttef1.\nFor heterologous expression in Komagataella phaffii, genes for LsAA9A and TfAA10A were cloned according to the LyGo cloning protocol and integrated into the genome of K. phaffii. The native DNA sequence of LsAA9A followed by a TEV cleavage recognition site and a His purification tagwas cloned into three different constructs carrying three different signal peptides for secretion in the yeast K. phaffii. The following signal peptides were selected: \u03b1-MF signal peptide resulting in the vector namedpLyGo-Kp\u22121-LsAA9A, AmySP signal peptide fromA. niger resulting in the vector pLyGo-Kp\u22122-LsAA9A, and the native L. similis signal peptide of LsAA9A resulting in the vector called pPIC9KNativeSP-LsAA9A. The LsAA9Anative signal peptidewas cloned into the vector pLyGo-Kp\u22122-LsAA9A using USER cloning in which both the forward primer FW-NativeSP_LsAA9A and reverse primer RVNativeSP_LsAA9A contained the native signal peptide, resulting in the vector pPIC9K-NativeSP-LsAA9A. The native DNA sequence without the native signal peptide of TfAA10A from Thermobifida fusca (UniProt: Q47QG3) was ordered as synthetic gene fragment from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) with SapI restriction enzyme sites compatible with LyGo cloning. The gene fragment was cloned by LyGo cloning into the vector pLyGo-Kp\u22122 with AmySP, resulting in the vector pLyGo-Kp\u22122-TfAA10A. The signal peptide AmySP was chosen to direct the proteins to the ER as it was predicted to be cleaved at position His1 for both proteins according to SignalP48. All vectorswere cloned andpropagated in E. coliDH5a,mini-prepped, and their sequences were confirmed by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany).\nThe synthetic DNA sequence of AN4663 was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) without introns codon-optimized and cloned into the episomal vector pBGP1 (a kind gift from Charles Lee)49 using uracil excision-based cloning as described previously in ref. 46 using the primer pair FW-USER-AN4663episomal and RV-USER-AN4663-GAP-episomal. The expression of the AN4663 in the episomal plasmid pBGP1 is driven by the strong constitutive promoter pGAP. The resulting plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing.\nCompetent cells, transformation, and strain validation Protoplastation for A. nidulanswas performed as previously in ref. 50. The transformations were made in gently thawed protoplasts23. Each transformation protoplasts were mixed with 1.5\u03bcg of CRISPR vector andused in combinationwith either 2\u03bcgof a lineardouble-strandDNA for homologous recombination or 20\u03bcL of 100\u03bcM stock solutions of oligonucleotides in a total volume of 150\u03bcL of PCT buffer (50% w/v PEG8000, 50mM CaCl2, 20mM Tris, 0.6M KCl, pH 7.5). The mix was incubated for 10min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 250 \u00b5l of transformation buffer (1.2M sorbitol, 50mM CaCl2\u00b72 H2O, 20mM Tris, 0.6M KCl, pH 7.2), and plated on transformation media (1M sucrose, 2% agar, 1x nitrate salt solution, 0.001% thiamine, 1 x trace metal solution plates). All transformation plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Resulting transformants were examined by diagnostic tissuePCR as described previously in ref. 22. Sanger-sequencing was used for validation of strains with AN4663 complementation, point-mutation, and RFP-tagging.\nFor K. phaffii, all vectors were linearized before genomic integration using the primers Fw-PmeI and Rv-PmeI and the linearized fragmentswere confirmedby electrophoresis prior to electroporation. PCR fragments were further subjected to PCR clean-up using PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel\u2122). Electrocompetent cells were produced according to the Invitrogen Pichia Expression Kit (Catalogue no. K1710-01). In detail, a starting culture of the desired strainwasgrown in 5mLyeast extractpeptonedextrose (YPD)mediumat 30 \u00b0Covernight. Next day, 0.1mL was used to inoculate a fresh culture of YPD and incubated at 30 \u00b0C overnight until an optical density measured at a 600 nmwavelength (OD600) of 1.3 was obtained. On the following day, the culturewas centrifuged at 1500 g at 4 \u00b0C and the cells resuspended in 500mL ice-cold water. The process was repeated with 250mL icecold water, and once more with 20mL of an ice-cold sorbitol solution (1M). After final centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1M sorbitol solution to a final volumeof 1.5mL. Approximately 1 \u00b5g of PCR product was used in combination with 80 \u00b5L of freshly produced electrocompetent cells (GS115) for electroporation. The cells and the DNA were incubated on ice for 5min prior to electroporation. For electroporation, a 0.2 cmgap sterile electroporation cuvette was used, and the cells were electroporated using the following parameters: (voltage (V) 1500, capacitance (\u00b5F) 25, and resistance (\u03a9) 200). Right after electroporation, 1mL of 1M ice-cold sorbitol was added to the cuvette, and the entire cell pulsed was then plated on minimal dextrose medium (MD), and incubated upside down at 30\u00b0 for 3\u20134 days until colonies had formed. The identity of the transformants was confirmed by colony PCR. Colonies grown on MD plates were picked and resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 20mM NaOH and boiled at 99 \u00b0C for 25min. The mixture was centrifuged for 1min at 11,000 g to remove cellular debris, and 5 \u00b5L of the supernatant was used as a template for the PCR reaction using OneTaq\u00ae 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer (New England Biolabs) primers Fw-AOX1 and Rv-AOX1.\nCorrect clones producing LsAA9A and TfAA10A were selected for small-scale (in 24-well plates) screening of protein production, and the best producers were then used to make a second batch of electrocompetent cells for the introduction of the episomal plasmid containing AN4663. Selected strains of LsAA9A and TfAA10A expression were made electrocompetent using the method described above, and 1 \u00b5g of the episomal plasmid pBGP1-AN4663 was electroporated as described above. After electroporation, 1M ice-cold sorbitol solution was added to the cuvette, and the mixture was recovered at 30 \u00b0C for 2 h with vigorous shaking. The entire culture was then plated on selective YPD plates containing 100 \u00b5g/mL Zeocin\u2122 and incubated for up to a week at 30 \u00b0C until colonies appeared.\nCo-expression of LsAA9A and TfAA10A together with AN4663 Single colonies of the desired strain were used to inoculate 10mL of Buffered Glycerol Complex Medium (BMGY) (Pichia Expression Kit,\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4202 10\nLife Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and grown at 28 \u00b0C for two days with shaking at 250 rpm. From the saturated culture, a starting culture with an OD600 of 1.0 was prepared in 25mL buffered methanol complex (BMMY) medium, sometimes supplemented with Zeocin (100 \u00b5g/mL) for the strains carrying the pBGP1 plasmid. Baffled glass flaskswere used, and the cultureswere incubated at 28 \u00b0Cwith shaking at 250 rpm. Expression wasmaintained by the addition of 1%methanol every day for an additional four days. OD600 measurements were carried out daily and the cultures were plated on YPD-agar with 100 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin at the end of expression to check for the presence of the pBGP1 plasmid containing AN4663. On the final day, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20min, and the supernatant was subjected to filter sterilization. To check for the secretion of LsAA9A and TfAA10A, 5 \u00b5L of the supernatant was loaded into a 4\u221220% Mini-PROTEAN-TGX gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), run at 165 V for 50min. After the run, gels were stained with InstantBlue Protein Stain (Expedeon Inc., Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for one hour and destained overnight with demineralized water."

The samples were centrifuged to remove the AZCL-HEC substrate, and the absorbance was measured at 590 nm.\nFluorescence microscopy and image analysis Fresh A. nidulans spores suspensions (10 \u00b5L of ~105 spores per mL) were inoculated on glass slides with 0.5mL solid MM (as described above) with 4mM L-arginine and incubated for 20 h in petri dishes in micro-perforated bags at 37 \u00b0C. A cover slide and immersion oil were applied and the ER was labelled with 10 \u00b5M 3,3\u2032-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) for 20min. Images of A. nidulans were acquired with a Leica DMI6000 widefield microscope, equipped with an 63 \u00d7 1.40OILHCPLAPOobjective and operatedwith LASX (version 3.3.3) software. Three images of mRFP tagged proteins, green mitochondrial membrane dye (DiOC6) and bright field were acquired for each sample. Collected images were processed using the Imaris software version 9.8.2 (Bitplane AG, Z\u00fcrich / Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England). Background subtraction was performed followedbymanual segmentationofA. nidulansfilaments and saved as surfaces for each image and co-localization of mRFP and DiOC6 labelled components were determined using Imaris Coloc tool.

Three different liquid media for A. nidulans were utilized for the fermentations, these include potato dextrose media containing 39 g/L potato dextrose, minimal media with 1% glucose, or cellulose minimal media (0.5% cellulose, 1% glucose). All media contained 1x nitrate salt solution, 0.001% thiamine, and 1x trace metal solution supplemented with 4 mM L-arginine.

Biomass was filtered and biomass were washed with Phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. FivemL of A. nidulans\ncell biomass was pelleted by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS. Lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100mMNaCl and 10mMEDTA) was added to each sample and vortexed, followed by incubation at 95 \u00b0C for 10min and then vortexed again. 1.5mL of the resulting solution was transferred to 2mL bead beating tubes containing 1.4 millimetre Zirconium oxide beads.

The resulting liquid was transferred to new 1.5mL tubes and sonicated using a 2 millimetre sonication tip at 100% power, with 3 s ON and 1 s OFF, for a total sonication time of two min. The resulting liquid was centrifuged at 20,000g for 10min at 4 \u00b0C, and the resulting supernatant transferred to new 1.5mL tubes. The protein concentration in the samples was determined using a tryptophan assay52.\nCysteine residues of the resulting protein lysate were reduced with 5mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and alkylated with 5mM chloroacetamide for 30min at room temperature. Protein lysate was prepared for protease digestion with protein aggregation capture (PAC)53 using magnetic hydroxyl beads. Once the proteins had aggregated on the beads, 50mMHEPES buffer (pH 8.5) was added. This was followed by the addition of Lys-C protease at a ratio of 1:200 (to total lysate protein) and digestion at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, followed by the addition of trypsin at a ratio of 1:50, and digestion at 37 \u00b0C overnight. Samples were acidified to quench the protease reaction by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 2%.\nThe resulting peptide mixture was prepared for downstream LC/ MS/MS analysis with hydrophobic solid-phase extraction using C18 Waters Sep-Paks (Milford Massachusetts, USA). Briefly, Sep-Paks were prepared by the sequential addition of acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA solution, followedby the additionof the acidifiedpeptidemixture. The samples were then washed with 0.1% TFA and eluted into new tubes using 50% acetonitrile solution with 0.1% TFA. Acetonitrile was evaporated from the peptide solution using an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus speedvac operated at 60 \u00b0C. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% TFA solution, and the peptide concentration was determined using a Thermo Fisher NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nFor samples analysed by in-gel proteomics analysis, sample preparation was performed as previously described in ref. 54."

            "text": "Peptides were prepared for labelling using the PAC protocol described above. Briefly, 20 \u00b5g of protein was protease-digested on-bead overnight in 50mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.5). The resulting peptide mixtures were transferred to new tubes and acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 50%. Tandem mass tag 11-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) were added to individual sample and incubated for 60min at room temperature. The resulting reaction was quenched by the addition of 5% hydroxylamine for 15min, followed by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 1%. The labelled samples were pooled and mixed, followed by the evaporation of acetonitrile with a speedvac (see above). The resulting peptide pellet was reconstituted in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and prepared for offline fractionation.\nHigh pH reversed-phase offline peptide fractionation A mixture of 200 \u00b5g of the peptides reconstituted in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) was injected, fractionated and collected using a Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The system was operated at 30 \u00b5L/min, and peptides were separated on a Waters Acquity CSH C18 1.7\u03bcm 1\u00d7 150mm C18 column. Aqueous buffer A (5mM ammonium bicarbonate) and buffer B (100% acetonitrile) were used for the gradient, which consisted of increasing B from 8 to 28% in 62min, followed by an increase to 60% B, and another ramp to 70%, where it was\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4202 11\nmaintained for 8min, followed by ramp back down to 8% B, where it was maintained for 10min. For TMT-labelled peptides, the gradient was initially increased to 30% B, followed by a ramp to 65%B and rapid increase to 80% B, where it was maintained for 7min. The total fractionation time for bothmethodswas 87min, and a total of 46 fractions were collected.\nFormic acid (10%) was added to each fraction, and the samples were dried to completeness using the speedvac. Dried fractions were reconstituted in 40 \u00b5L 0.1% formic acid and 20 \u00b5L of each fraction was loaded onto Evotips (EvoSep, Odense, Denmark) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and prepared for MS analysis.\nLiquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry Single-shot label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis of protein digests from A. nidulans cells grown on different carbon sources were analysed using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to the MS with 0.1% formic acid as buffer A and 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% FA as buffer B. 500 ng of peptidemixturewas injected onto a homepacked C18 column (15 cm\u00d7 75\u03bcm inner diameter) packed with 1.9\u03bcm C18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Entringen, Germany). The peptide mixture was separated using a gradient of 0 to 25% B in 60min, after which it was increased to 40% B in 15min. The gradient was further increased to 80% B in 5min, where it was held for an additional 5min, followed by a ramp down to 5% B in 3min where it was held for 2min for equilibration. The total runtime was 90min. A column temperature of 50 \u00b0C was applied during all the runs using a column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach, Germany).\nAn EvoSep One nano-LC system (EvoSep, Odense, Denmark) was coupled to MS for peptide sequencing analysis of individual fractionated samples (TMT labelled and unlabelled) and PRM analysis. Two methods were utilized for all samples: either the 60 samples per day, resulting in a total runtime of 21.5min, or 30 samples per day, with a total runtime of 44min. Buffer A, consisting of 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B, consisting of 0.1% formic and 99.9% acetonitrile, wereused for separation. A 15 cm\u00d7 150\u03bcminner diameter homepacked column with 1.9 \u03bcm C18 beads was heated to 60 \u00b0C, as described above.\nMass spectrometric data acquisition The samples were analysed on either a Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF-X or Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in positive mode with 2 kV spray voltage and a capillary temperature of 275 \u00b0C. An MS1 resolution of 120,000 and an MS2 resolution of 30,000 (with an automated gain control (AGC)fill timeof 54 s) were used for data-dependent acquisition (DDA). A normalized collisional energy (NCE) of 28 and a quadrupole isolation window of 1.3m/z were used for LFQ samples, while corresponding values of 35 NCE and 0.8m/z isolation window were used for TMT-labelled samples.\nTargeted analysis was performed using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) with the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An MS1 scan with a resolution of 120,000 was performed prior to an unscheduled product ion scan that cycles through an inclusion list of peptide mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios provided for targeted analysis. Typically, two charge states for each peptide were targeted for PRM analysis in order to increase the specificity. An isolation width of 1.3m/z, an MS2 resolution of 60,000, a NCE of 30, and maximum injection time of 100ms were used for each target.\nMass spectrometry data analysis All DDA data were searched using MaxQuant software13. A. nidulans samples were searched against the UniProt Emericella nidulans (taxonomy ID 227321, strain FGSC A4 / ATCC 38163 / CBS 112.46 / NRRL 194 / M139) reference proteome. Signal peptides predicted by SignalP48 were removed from the leading sequence of all signal\npeptide containing proteins in the FASTA file prior to searching. Files were searched with \u201cTrypsin/P\u201d as the protease specificity, with a maximum of two missed cleavages, fixed carbamidomethyl modification on the cysteines, and variable modifications of oxidation (methionine), acetylation (protein N-terminal), methylation (histidine), phosphorylation (serine, threonine, and tyrosine), and deamidation (asparagine, and glutamic acid) were utilized. Methylated histidine-specific diagnostic ion of 124.0869m/z was added to the modification within MaxQuant software for high-confidence localization of methylated histidines14. The search mass tolerance was first set to 20 ppm, followed by 4.5 ppm after main search recalibration. The mass tolerance for fragment ions was set to 20 ppm. An Andromeda score cut-off of 40 was utilized with a 1% false discovery rate at all levels (peptide spectral matches, peptides, and proteins).\nPRM and stoichiometry analysis were performed with the Skyline software55. A spectral library was constructed in Skyline from MaxQuant-processed results from label-free samples to assist peak identification. The PRM results were quantified by summing the fragment peak areas (Supplementary Data 5). Summed MS1 peak areas of the three isotopic parent peptidemasses were utilized for quantitative comparison in the stoichiometry analysis.\nDownstream bioinformatics and statistical analysis MaxQuant-processed results were analysed using the Perseus software56. LFQ intensities reported in the proteingroups.txt output from MaxQuant were used for the quantitative analysis of label-free samples analysed with LC/MS/MS. Contaminant and reverse hits were removed from the list and the values were log2 transformed. Protein groups were removed if not observed in at least two replicates in one condition. Missing values were imputed using a width of 0.3 and downshift of 1.8. To determine regulated proteins, a two-sided t-test was performed using a permutation-based false discovery rate cut-off of 0.05 as truncation for significant hits. For TMT-labelled samples, reporter intensities were utilized instead of LFQ. Contaminants and reverse hits were similarly removed, and quantile normalization was performed on the reporter intensities followed by log2 transformation. A two-sided t-test was performed as described above to determine significant differences between proteins for LFQ and TMT experiments."
