1. **Investigate the mechanism of steroid degradation in Mycolicibacterium strains.** The study found that Mycolicibacterium strains can degrade hydrocortisone, but the mechanism of this degradation is unknown. Future research could investigate the enzymes and pathways involved in this process. This knowledge could be used to develop strategies to prevent or reduce steroid degradation during bioconversion processes.


2. **Engineer Mycolicibacterium strains with improved steroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity.** The study found that the heterologous expression of kstD2NS in Mycolicibacterium strains resulted in only a modest increase in steroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity. Future research could focus on engineering Mycolicibacterium strains with higher levels of kstD2NS expression or with mutations that improve the activity of the enzyme. This could lead to the development of more efficient biocatalysts for the production of 1(2)-dehydrosteroids.


3. **Explore the use of Mycolicibacterium strains for the production of other 1(2)-dehydrosteroids.** The study focused on the production of prednisolone from hydrocortisone using Mycolicibacterium strains. Future research could investigate the use of these strains for the production of other 1(2)-dehydrosteroids, such as 1(2)-dehydrotestosterone, 1(2)-dehydroprogesterone, and 1(2)-dehydroestrone. These steroids have a variety of pharmaceutical applications and could be produced more efficiently using Mycolicibacterium strains than with current methods.


4. **Investigate the potential of Mycolicibacterium strains for the bioremediation of steroid-contaminated environments.** Steroids are a major class of environmental pollutants, and their presence in the environment can have a negative impact on human health and the environment. Future research could investigate the potential of Mycolicibacterium strains to degrade steroids in contaminated environments. This could lead to the development of new bioremediation strategies for the removal of steroids from the environment.


5. **Study the regulation of steroid-1(2)-dehydrogenase activity in Mycolicibacterium strains.** The study found that the expression of kstD2NS in Mycolicibacterium strains was regulated by the acetamidase and hsp60 promoters. Future research could investigate the regulation of kstD2NS expression in more detail. This knowledge could be used to develop strategies to control the expression of kstD2NS and improve the production of 1(2)-dehydrosteroids.
