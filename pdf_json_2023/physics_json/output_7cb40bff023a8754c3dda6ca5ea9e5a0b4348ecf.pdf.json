The distinctive adsorptivity and inducibility of chitosan and polyaspartic acid in the hydrogel electrolyte triggers a double coupling network and an associated synergistic inhibition mechanism, thereby effectively inhibiting the side reactions on the zinc anode. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte played a crucial role in an aqueous acid-based Zinc/MnO2 battery, by maintaining its interior two-electron redox reaction and inhibiting the formation of zinc dendrites. Furthermore, the sustainable biomass-based hydrogel electrolyte is biodegradable, and could be recovered from the Zinc/ MnO2 battery for subsequent recycling.",

            "text": "green zinc-ion batteries\nHongyu Lu1,2,8, Jisong Hu3,8, Xijun Wei1,8, Kaiqi Zhang4,8, Xiao Xiao1, Jingxin Zhao 5 ,QiangHu6, JingYu7, Guangmin Zhou 1 &BingangXu 5\nThe operation of traditional aqueous-electrolyte zinc-ion batteries is adversely affected by the uncontrollable growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. These problems can be avoided by the development of functional hydrogel electrolytes as replacements for aqueous electrolytes. However, themechanismbywhichmost hydrogel electrolytes inhibit the growthof zinc dendrites on a zinc anode has not been investigated in detail, and there is a lack of a large-scale recovery method for mainstream hydrogel electrolytes. In this paper, we describe the development of a recyclable and biodegradable hydrogel electrolyte based on natural biomaterials, namely chitosan and polyaspartic acid. The distinctive adsorptivity and inducibility of chitosan and polyaspartic acid in the hydrogel electrolyte triggers a double coupling network and an associated synergistic inhibition mechanism, thereby effectively inhibiting the side reactions on the zinc anode. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte played a crucial role in an aqueous acid-based Zinc/MnO2 battery, by maintaining its interior two-electron redox reaction and inhibiting the formation of zinc dendrites. Furthermore, the sustainable biomass-based hydrogel electrolyte is biodegradable, and could be recovered from the Zinc/ MnO2 battery for subsequent recycling.\nThe burgeoning development of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) has led to their exploration for broad applications in renewable energy storage, as the sustainability, high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness of AZIBs can relieve energy shortages and help to protect the environment1,2. Metallic Zn is considered to be an ideal anode for rechargeable AZIBs because of its high theoretical capacity (820mAh g\u22121), low redox potential (\u22120.762 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode), and low toxicity, and as Zn is a plentiful resource3. However, uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites on Zn anodes leads to a low coulombic efficiency (CE), and the solvation structure of Zn(H2O)6 2+ induces a series of side reactions on Zn anodes and metallic Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, which cause short circuiting and volume expansion, thereby restricting the long-term operation of AZIBs4. Thus, there is an urgent need to exploit available and feasible strategies to protect Zn anodes from the above-described processes. The design and development of functional hydrogel (i.e., the hydrogel has different functional characteristics) electrolytes as replacements for traditional aqueous electrolytes has proven to be effective for inhibiting the growth of Zn dendrites on Zn anodes and theoccurrenceof side reactions5,6. However,manyproblems remain to be solved, such as volumetric expansion, parasitic reaction, and dendritic growth, and themechanismbywhichmost hydrogel electrolytes\nReceived: 21 February 2023\nAccepted: 17 July 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, P.

Consequently, there is a pressing need for the design ofmultifunctional hydrogel electrolytes capable of exhibiting all of the properties required in practical applications. In addition, there is a lack of a large-scale recoverymethod formainstream hydrogel electrolytes and these are typically prepared from non-biodegradable raw materials. This results in large amounts of hydrogel electrolytes remaining discarded in AZIBs, leading to serious environmental and economic problems. Taken together, the above-mentioned problems demonstrate that a novel hydrogel electrolyte must be developed that displays recyclability, biodegradability, and multifunctionality, thereby enabling the sustainable development of AZIBs with long-term cycling stability. Unlike other hydrogel ingredients, chitosan (CS) and polyaspartic acid (PASP) are biomass materials that are ubiquitous in the shells of molluscs, such as snails, and possess good recyclability and biodegradability. Moreover, the CS and PASP skeletons have abundant carboxylic acid and amine groups, which can form hydrogen-bond crosslinks and effectively enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels.\nIn this work, we describe the design and fabrication of a CS- and PASP-containing ZnSO4hydrogel (denoted \u201cCPZ-H\u201d) electrolyte, which exhibits high ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties. Specifically, CPZ-H has high robustness, good recyclability, and biodegradability, and it maintains stable electrochemical performance after mechanical damage and subsequent regeneration. Additionally, calculations show that the abundant anionic functional groups in CS and PASP have high adsorption energy for the Zn (002) crystal plane, which is horizontally aligned. This means that a synergistic inhibition mechanism operates in CPZ-H that facilitates equilibrium ion flux and preferred growth of Zn crystals on the Zn (002) crystal plane to cooperatively regulate Zn deposition. Moreover, anionic groups in CS and PASP with high adsorption energies (such as carboxyl and ether groups) possess desolvation and proton-storage abilities, so they can effectively restrict the decomposition of active water molecules and further restrain adverse reactions on the surface of Zn anodes. Therefore, a symmetric cell consisting of bare Zn anodes and CPZ-H (Zn/CPZ-H/Zn) achieved an ultralong cycle life (2200h) at a high current density (10mA cm\u22122), and had a high average CE (99.6%) and persistent stability, even at a high depth of discharge (DOD; 80%). MnO2 experiences a two-electron-transfer redox reaction in an acidic Zn-MnO2 system, which can promisingly double the specific capacity of MnO2 from 308 to 616mAhg\n\u221212. However, an acidic electrolyte with H+ will cause a strong hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of the Zn anode, which greatly affects the cyclic life of the acidic Zn-MnO2 battery. Encouragingly, theCPZ-H electrolytewas effective in aqueousacid Zn/MnO2 batteries andmaintained its interior two-electron redox characteristics due to its good compatibility with a Zn metal anode; it also achieved a high initial capacity (523.6mAhg\u22121) at a current density of 0.1 A g\u22121, owing to its good proton-redistribution behavior and acidcorrosion resistance. Furthermore, a Zn/MnO2 full cell containing the CPZ-H electrolyte exhibited an impressive capacity retention of 92.5% at a current density of 5 A g\u22121 after 5000 cycles without concomitant introduction of excess Mn2+ into the electrolyte. Moreover, the CPZ-H electrolyte could be recycled and reused after battery operation: regenerated CPZ-H (rCPZ-H) electrolyte was used to assemble a Zn/ MnO2 full cell, and this exhibited good cycling stability (86.7% after 2400 cycles at a current density of 5 A g\u22121). In addition, the CPZ-H electrolyte can be decomposed under natural conditions by microorganisms."

            "text": "Fabrication and investigation of the CPZ-H electrolyte The design and fabrication process of the CPZ-H electrolyte is illustrated in Fig. 1a. CS and PASP were obtained from snail shells. In contrast to the conventional acid-based method used to prepare CS\nhydrogel (C-H), a precooled aqueous alkali\u2013urea solution was used to increase the dissolution of CS for the preparation of the CPZ-H electrolyte. Subsequently, as such solutions are thermosensitive, the CPZH electrolyte was gelled by heating and solvent exchange (as detailed in the Experimental section)7. Asmentioned, the chains of CSwerewell coupled to PASP within CPZ-H via hydrogen bonds, which greatly enhanced the mechanical properties of the CPZ-H electrolyte. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1b) shows the micromorphology of the freeze-dried CPZ-H electrolyte. Extensively layered and interconnected pores are visible, indicating that it had a high specific surface area (Supplementary Fig. 1) that can accommodate more electrolytes and permit free drift of dissolved ions. Figure 1c presents the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of C-H, CPZ-H, and CPZ-H electrolytes without ZnSO4 (denoted as CP-H). The peak at 3210 cm\u22121 is attributable to the O-H and N-H stretching vibrations of CS, with the broad shape due to these groups being involved in hydrogen bonds. The peaks at 2875 and 1082 cm\u22121 are attributable to C-H and C-O-C stretching vibrations, respectively. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of PASP are observed at ~1512 and 1612 cm\u22121, representing the N-H bending vibration and C=O stretching vibration of an amino group, respectively. Furthermore, the characteristic peak of the carboxyl group of PASP shifted from 1398 to 1390 cm\u22121 when ZnSO4was added intoCP-H\n8. As shown in Fig. 1d, CPZ-Hhad highwater retention (80.5%) after 84 h, which was much higher than those of the CP-H (66.2%) and C-H (45.2%) electrolytes, demonstrating that the hydrophilicity of the CPZ-H electrolyte was greater than those of the latter electrolytes. Similarly, the digital images in the insert of Fig. 1d demonstrate that the CPZ-H electrolyte exhibited almost no water-loss-related volume changes after 84 h.\nThe mechanical properties of the C-H, CP-H, and CPZ-H electrolytes were examined by determining their typical stress\u2013strain curves (Fig. 1e). It was found that the CPZ-H electrolyte possesses a high tensile strength (53.2 kPa), a large fracture strain (1298%), and that its maximum strain was approximately three times that of the C-H electrolyte. To further verify the flexibility of the CPZ-H electrolyte, a series of extreme tests were performed, which revealed that it had excellent flexibility and stretchability, i.e., it did not crack, even when stretched, twisted, andknotted (Fig. 1f, g). Impressively, theCPZ-Helectrolyte can also be drawn into a thin thread that holds a weight of 1 kg (Fig. 1h), which is 10,000 times its ownweight. In addition, CPZ-H electrolytes of different colors can be molded into various shapes, revealing their good plasticity (Fig. 1i). The ion diffusion coefficients of the CPZ-H electrolyte at various temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 1j, revealing that its ion diffusion coefficient remained stable (at 4.1 \u00d7 10\u221210) at 25 \u00b0C but substantially increased with heating to 50 \u00b0C (due to a moderate amount of water evaporation) and remained at this level for ~1 h due to thermal effects6. However, further continuous evaporationmeant that the remaining water molecules within the CPZ-H electrolyte were insufficient to enable the effective transport of ions, such that the ion diffusion coefficient decreased significantly to 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221211. However, the ion diffusion coefficient gradually increased when the CPZ-H electrolyte was placed in a room-temperature environment. Therefore, controlling the water content of the CPZ-H electrolyte by varying the temperature can regulate the migration of ions within its hydrogel structure. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the ionic conductivity of the CPZ-H and CZ-H electrolytes at various temperatures of \u221220 to 30 \u00b0C, and the ionic conductivity of the CPZ-H electrolyte is greater than that of the CZ-H electrolyte due to the presence of PASP in the CPZ-H electrolyte, which allows it to form more porous structures via crosslinking than that of the CZ-H electrolyte. Moreover, the carboxyl groups on the surface of PASP attract counter-ions and thus are served as additional hopping sites for ion transfer9. After 15 days of soaking in an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid (pH ~1), testing indicated that the CPZ-H electrolyte maintained its structural integrity, indicating its good resistance to corrosion in highly acidic conditions (Fig. 1k\u2013n).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 2\nInvestigations of electrochemical properties and Zn deposition behavior of the Zn/CPZ-H anode To confirm the feasibility and unique advantages of using the CPZ-H electrolyte to protect a Zn anode, a hydrogel electrolyte consisting of CS and ZnSO4 was also fabricated and was denoted the \u201cCZ-H\u201d electrolyte. Then, the electrochemical properties of various Zn anodes in symmetric cells were systematically investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the bare Zn anode had a cycle life of only 190 h with a voltage hysteresis of 436mV, prior to short circuiting at a current density of 10mAcm\u22122. However, compared with the bare Zn anode and the Zn/ CZ-H anode, the Zn/CPZ-H anode had a lower voltage hysteresis (96mV); moreover, its cycle life (2200h) wasmore than ten times that of the bare Zn anode. Furthermore, the Zn/CPZ-H anode displayed superior stability and reversibility, even under severe conditions (25mA cm\u22122 and 25 mAh cm\u22122), revealing that the addition of PASP significantly assisted in suppressing the growthof Zndendrites and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that competes with Zn deposition (Fig. 2b). The rate performance of the symmetric cells containing Zn anodes (Fig. 2c) illustrated that the Zn/CPZ-H anode had a stable voltage profile, with lower voltage hysteresis when the current density\ntemperature was changed from 25 to 50 \u00b0C. k\u2013nOptical photographs of the CPZ-H electrolyte in an acid-soaking experiment that lasted for 15 days.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 3\nwas increased from 0.5 to 10mA cm\u22122, while the bare Zn anode abruptly failed at 10mAcm\u22122. This is further evidence that the synergistic interaction between CS and PASP is critical for the increased cycling stability of the Zn/CPZ-H anode. Figure 2d shows that the Zn/ CPZ-H anodehadanexchange current density of0.378mAcm\u22122, which is lower than those of the bare Zn and Zn/CZ-H anodes, demonstrating its good corrosion resistance. As summarized in Fig. 2e, the corrosion rates of the bare Zn, Zn/CZ-H, and Zn/CPZ-H anodes were surveyed by linear polarization measurements. The Zn/CPZ-H anode retained a corrosion current of 0.27mA cm\u22122, which is less than those of the Zn/ CZ-H and bare Zn anodes, reflecting the distinct anti-corrosion properties of the CPZ-H electrolyte. As revealed by the Nyquist plots in Fig. 2f, the impedance of the bare Zn anode attests to its high interfacial charge-transfer resistance (1027\u03a9). However, the Zn/CPZ-H and Zn/CZ-H anodes had lower interfacial charge-transfer resistances (316 and 511\u03a9, respectively),\n[20] [5] [17] [13]\n[22] [4] [15] [16]\n[10] [12] [11] [3]\n[14] [18] [19] Zn/CPZ-H (This work)\n5 25 40 80DOD of Zn anode (%)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nTim e (h) Bare Zn\nZn/CP-H\nZn/CPZ-H\nCycle number (n)\nC ou lo m bi c ef f ic i e nc y (% )\nZn/CPZ-H\nZn/CZ-H\nBare Zn\nZ\u2019 (\u03a9)\n-Z \u2019\u2019( \u03a9 )\nZn/CPZ-H\nZn/CZ-H\nBare Zn\n0 1 Capacity (mAh)\nPo te nt ia l( V)\n2 3 4 5\n0.0\n1st\n50th\n250th\n0.6\n0.3 450th\n850th\n72 mV\n-1.2 -1.1 Potential ( V v.s.

Supplementary Fig. 3 reveals the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the bare Zn and Zn/CPZ-H anodes; as can be seen, the Zn nucleation overpotential of the Zn/CPZ-H anode was less than that of the bare Zn anode, which demonstrates that there were faster nucleation kinetics and a lower nucleation barrier during the Zn deposition process in the Zn/CPZ-H anode than during that in the bare Zn anode. Encouragingly, the Zn/CPZ-H//Cu cell operated over 850 cycles had an average CE of 99.6% at a current density of 10mAcm\u22122 with a limited capacity 5mAh cm\u22122 (Fig. 2g), indicating the excellent reversibility and durability of the Zn/CPZ-H anode. Additionally, the charge\u2013discharge voltage profiles from the 1st to 850th cycles are presented in Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4. The Zn/CPZ-H/Cu cell had a plating/stripping voltage hysteresis of 72mV, whichwas substantially lower than those of the Zn/CZ-H anode (109mV) and bare Zn anode (153mV). The DOD of the Zn anodes was also evaluated, as it is an important metric for revealing the suitability of AZIBs for use in practical applications. As observed in Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 5, the bare Zn anode shortcircuited after ~300h when its DOD was 5%, leading to a low Zn utilization rate and energy density. In contrast, the lifespan of the Zn/CPZ-H anode was prolonged to 120 h, even under the harsh condition of 80% DOD, owing to the protection afforded by the CPZ-H electrolyte. In addition, a Zn/CPZ-H//Zn/CPZ-H symmetric cell displayed satisfactory cyclic performance and reversibility in an alternating test of continuous running and shelving (Supplementary Fig. 6), indicating that the Zn/ CPZ-H anode possesses tremendous potential for recovery performance. Furthermore, this ultrahigh cycling life of the Zn/CPZ-H anode exceeds the cycling lives of most of the modified Zn anodes that have been previously reported (Fig. 2j)3\u20135,10\u201322.\nTo further investigate the ability of the CPZ-H electrolyte to modulate the Zn deposition behavior of the Zn/CPZ-H anode, a series of ex situ characterizationswereperformed. The ex situ SEM images of the bare Zn anode in Fig. 3a\u2013c reveal that the surface of the bare Zn anode was covered with Zn dendrites after 100 and 200h. These formeddisorderly piles of Zn flakes,whichaccumulatedon thebare Zn anode and eventually led to battery failure. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows SEM images of the Zn/CZ-H anode at various cycle times, clearly demonstrating that the excessive growth of Zn dendrites was somewhat suppressed, due to the CS in the CZ-H electrolyte effectively regulating Zn2+ flux. However, the CS only delayed the growth rate of dendrites, and it could not completely eliminate the damage to the separator caused by dendrite growth. Thereby, abundant dendrites were present on the surface of the Zn/CZ-H anode at 1100h. In contrast, a largenumber of Zndendrites grewon the Zn (002) planeon the surface of the Zn/CPZ-H anode over a cycling time of 2200 h (Fig. 3d\u2013f), which is attributable to the stronger adsorption energy of PASP along the Zn (002) plane, indicating that the PASP in the CPZ-H electrolyte enhanced deposition of Zn onto the Zn (002) crystal plane during theplating/strippingprocess (SupplementaryFig. 8). The crosssectional SEM images of the bare Zn and Zn/CPZ-H anodes are shown in Supplementary Figs. 9, 10, respectively; these reveal that vertical Zn dendrites were present on the bare Zn anode but not on the Zn/CPZ-H anode, due to the presence of PASP in the CPZ-H electrolyte. Furthermore, ex situ laser confocal scanning microscopy was performed to survey the surface conditions of the Zn anodes after various cycling times. Figure 3g\u2013i shows that the surfaces of the bareZn anode initially had a smooth planar morphology, but had accumulated flake-like dendrites after 100 and 200h. In contrast, Zn nanosheets were uniformly deposited across the entire surface of the Zn/CPZ-H anode, and deposited Zn grew in the horizontal direction with no abnormal local protrusion, even after 2200h (Fig. 3j\u2013l).\nTo further scrutinize the mechanism of growth of the deposited Zn layer, chronoamperometry was performed at a constant overpotential of \u2212150mV. As shown in Fig. 3m, the current density continuously increased after 300 s, which demonstrates that the two-\ndimensional diffusion process triggered the uneven growth of a Zn film and that Zn2+ tended to aggregate and ultimately form dendrites. During this process, deposited Zn atoms would have diffused transversely along the surface to find the most favorable sites for charge transfer, i.e., those with decreased surface energy and exposed areas. In the Zn/CPZ-H anode, the rate of increase in the current density slowed after the initial 50 s, and then a stable and constant threedimensional diffusion process became dominant. This process increased the number of sites for Zn nucleation and thus led to an increase in the uniformity and density of the deposited layer of Zn (inset of Fig. 3m). In addition to guiding uniform nucleation and Zn deposition, the CPZ-H electrolyte also accelerated the kinetics of Zn2+ plating/stripping. Specifically, the activation energy (Ea) of Zn 2+ transference was calculated using the Arrhenius equation, showing that Ea decreased from 29.14 kJmol\u22121 in the absence of the CPZ-H electrolyte to 18.43 kJmol\u22121 in the presence of the CPZ-H electrolyte (Fig. 3n and Supplementary Fig. 11). Online electrochemicalmass spectroscopywas also used for ex situ monitoring of the H2 flux during the Zn plating/ stripping process, to enable accurate quantification of H2 evolution (Fig. 3o and Supplementary Fig. 12). The H2 evolution rate of the bare Zn//Zn anode symmetric cell reached 0.47\u03bcmol/s over a 5-h cycle, whereas the average H2 evolution rate of the Zn/CZ-H//Zn/CZ-H anode symmetric cell was only 0.16\u03bcmol/s, due to the CZ-H electrolyte suppressing Zn2+ flux. Surprisingly, the H2 evolution rate in the Zn/CPZ-H anode symmetric cell was negligible (only 0.04\u03bcmol/s over a 5-h cycle), revealing that PASP could further suppress the HER. The theoretical adsorption energies of the carboxyl and ether anionic groups of CS and PASP in the CPZ-H electrolyte for Zn2+ are higher than that of H2O for Zn2+, revealing that Zn2+ is preferentially captured by such anionic functional groups. As the main barrier to charge transfer usually originates from the Zn2+ desolvation process in an electrolyte, the desolvation abilities of CS and PASP were further assessed by calculating the desolvation energies (Fig. 3p). The structure of the solvation environment in the CPZ-H electrolyte was simplified as CS-[Zn(H2O)5]\n2+ and PASP-[Zn(H2O)5]\n2+ to explore the dissolution capacity of its different components (Supplementary Fig. 13). The calculations revealed that the desolvation energies of CS-[Zn(H2O)5] 2+ and PASP-[Zn(H2O)5] 2+ (\u221220.46 and \u221221.52 eV, respectively) are more negative than that of [Zn(H2O)6] 2+ (\u221218.59 eV). This highlights the enhanced desolvation ability of the CPZH electrolyte and is consistent with the calculated Ea of the symmetric cells. In addition, the lowest unoccupiedmolecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of a Zn anode/electrolyte interface have an enormous effect on the thermodynamic stability of a full battery. Therefore, the LUMO and HOMO of H2O, PASP and CS molecules were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in Fig. 3q, the LUMO energies of PASP (\u22122.06 eV) andCSmolecules (0.76 eV) in theCPZ-H electrolyte are much lower than that of H2Omolecules (1.44 eV), revealing that the low LUMO of the CPZ-H electrolyte is capable of suppressing the spontaneous reduction of H2O molecules, i.e., the HER. To explore the mechanism of this suppression, the Gibbs free energies of H+ adsorption (\u0394GH) for the Zn/PASP, Zn/CS, and bare Zn anodes were calculated. This showed that compared with water dissociation on the bare Zn anode, that on the Zn/CPZ-H anode is more difficult, due to the presence of CS and PASP, which leads to a reduction in the proton supply, thereby inhibiting the generation and evolution of H2 (Fig. 3r). As aforementioned, the deposition of Zn onto the bare Zn anode and the Zn/CPZ-H anode can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 3s. The zincophilic functional groups (hydroxyl and N-acetylamino groups) of CS decrease the energy barrier of desolvation and thus facilitate the uniform deposition of Zn in a vertical electric field. Moreover, the PASP in the CPZ-H electrolyte possesses satisfactorily reversible proton-storage ability, which reduces the trend of HER and further inhibits related parasitic reactions. In addition, PASP strongly adsorbsonto theZn (002) plane, so it can induce Zn dendrites to grow preferentially on this plane\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 5\n(Supplementary Figure 14). The synergistic effect of CS and PASP effectively inhibits the irreversible damage that Zn dendrites can cause to a battery, further increasing the long-term cyclic stability of a battery (Supplementary Fig. 15).\nElectrochemical performance and reaction mechanism of a Zn/ CPZ-H//MnO2 full battery Due to the excellent anti-acid-corrosion properties of the CPZ-H electrolyte, CPZ-H immersed in a sulfuric acid solution was used as a hydrogel electrolyte in an aqueous-acid Zn/MnO2 battery to stimulate the internal two-electron redox process of the battery. MnO2 cathode materials were also synthesized (Supplementary Fig. 16), and the correspondingdetails aredescribed in the Supplementary Information. As shown in Fig. 4a, the ideal chemical reaction in an aqueous-acid Zn/ MnO2 battery with a two-electron redox process delivers a high theoretical capacity (616mAh g\u22121) and achieves the maximum energy density of a Zn/MnO2 battery.

The first five discharge curves of the Zn/MnO2 cell system at a current density of 0.1 A g\n\u22121 are shown in Fig. 4c. The Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell delivered a high capacity (523.6mAhg\u22121) in the first cycle, and the discharge capacity of the second cycle was similar (516.4mAh g\u22121), which is higher than that of Mn4+ to Mn3+ in the conventional natural aqueous electrolyte (theoretical capacity = 308mAh g\u22121). During the subsequent cycle, the Zn/ CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell achieved high and stable performance during the discharge process, with the single plateau on the discharge curve, indicating that the two-electron reduction from Mn4+ to Mn2+ was directly realized, i.e., occurred in one step. The CV curves of the Zn/ CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell in Fig. 4d have a typical single-peak shape with smaller voltage polarization between the oxidation and reduction peaks, and the CV curves of this cell over the first ten cycles (Supplementary Fig. 17) exhibit a similar profile and a pair of fixed redox peaks, revealing the good reversibility of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell. A bare Zn//MnO2 full cell was also assembled, using an aqueous electrolyte containing ZnSO4 and H2SO4, and used as a comparison cell to determine the practical utility of the CPZ-H electrolyte in an aqueous-acid Zn/MnO2 system, The CV curves of the Zn/CPZ-H// MnO2 and Zn//MnO2 full cells at scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 5mV s\u22121 exhibited a pair of well-defined and sharp redox peaks (Supplementary Fig. 18), which again indicates that only one redox reaction occurred in these aqueous-acid Zn/MnO2 batteries. Figure 4e displays the capacitance behavior of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 and bare Zn//MnO2 full cells. Significantly, the b values of peaks 1 and 2 were 0.62 and 0.67, demonstrating that the reactions represented by these peaks were controlled by both ionic diffusion and capacitive behavior (with the latter being dominant), which would accelerate the reaction kinetics of electrochemical processes in the Zn/CPZ-H// MnO2 full cell. Figure 4f, g shows the CV curves of the Zn/CPZ-H// MnO2 full cell, indicating that the capacitive contribution ratio at 5mV s\u22121 (76.4%, as can be seen in the shaded region) was higher than that of the bare Zn//MnO2 cell (58.7%). In addition, the abovementioned capacitive contribution ratio of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell at 5mV s\u22121 was greater than that at 0.2mV s\u22121 (40.9%) (Supplementary Fig. 19). This high capacitive contribution is attributable to the fast migration of ions/electrons in the Zn/CPZ-H anode, which is also the key requirement for achieving excellent rate capabilities and cycling performance at large current densities.\nThe increase in kinetics was also demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As illustrated in Fig. 4h, the EIS spectrum of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell had a greater slope than that of the bare Zn//MnO2 full cell in the low-frequency region, which again illustrates that the former cell featured faster diffusion and transport of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process than the latter cell. Moreover, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique tests showed that the Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell was higher than that of the bare Zn//MnO2 full cell (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Fig. 21). Figure 4j and Supplementary Fig. 20 demonstrate that the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell had a high capacity (523.6mAhg\u22121) at a current density of 0.1 A g\u22121 and even a capacity of 376.8mAhg\u22121 at a current density of 5 A g\u22121, with capacity retention as high as 71.9%. In addition, the capacity of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell exhibited almost no decay over 5000 cycles (Fig. 4k), corresponding to an impressive capacity retention rate of 92.5%; and an energy density of 452.16Wh kg\u22121, even at high power density (753.6Wkg\u22121). Overall, compared with the corresponding performances of most of the previously reported AZIBs, the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell exhibited a large capacity (523.6mAhg\u22121), a high energy density (452.16Wh kg\u22121) and excellent cyclic stability (a capacity retention rate of 92.5% after 5000 cycles), owing to the ionic redistribution and induced planar\ndeposition of its functional CPZ-H electrolyte (Fig. 4l and Supplementary Information Table 1)2,3,5,17,23\u201333.\nInvestigation of the Zn2+ storage mechanism of the Zn/CPZ-H// MnO2 full cell To further investigate the reactionmechanismof the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell, a series of ex situ and in situ characterizationswere conducted. Ex situ X-ray diffraction revealed the Zn2+-storage mechanism of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell operating via a two-electron redox process during discharging/charging (Fig. 5a). The MnO2 cathode initially had fivemaincharacteristic peaks, all ofwhich shifted to smaller diffraction angles during the first discharge to 0.8 V. Additionally, two extra characteristic peakswere located at 33\u00b0 and34\u00b0, and correspond to the (200) and (103) crystal planes of ZnxMnO2 and ZnMnO4, respectively. However, there were no peaks corresponding to MnOOH, revealing that MnO2 tended to undergo a two-electron reduction from Mn\n4+ to Mn2+. Subsequently, as the battery was fully charged to 2.0 V, the characteristic peaks of ZnxMnO2 and ZnMnO4 gradually disappeared, and themain peaks of theMnO2 cathode returned to their initial state, which represents the de-intercalation of Zn2+ from the MnO2 cathode. Moreover, the galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge profile contained only one plateau, which is further evidence that Mn4+ was directly reduced toMn2+ during the electrochemical reaction34. Finally, after the second discharge process, the characteristic peaks of ZnxMnO2 and ZnMnO4 reappeared, and the characteristic peaks of MnO2 were shifted to a smaller diffraction angle, demonstrating the reversibility of the structural change in the MnO2 cathode during the repeated charging/discharging process.\nEx situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to further confirm the existence of the two-electron reduction process. Figure 5b presents the spectrumofMn 2p during the charge/discharge process, and the change in the Mn valence is also illustrated by the spectra of Mn 2p at various voltages. After the full cell was first discharged to 0.8 V, the intensity of the Mn4+ peaks at 654.7 and 642.8 eV gradually weakened, while that of theMn2+ peaks at 653.4 and 642.5 eV was enhanced, which confirms that there was a significant change in the valence of Mn, i.e., fromMn4+ to Mn2+. Subsequently, after the full cell was charged to 2.0 V, theMn4+ peaks regained their initial intensity and theMn2+ peakgraduallyweakened. Finally, as the full cell was again discharged to 0.8 V, the intensity of the Mn2+ peak was restored, confirming that the two-electron reduction occurred during the discharge/charge process35,36. Moreover, the full cell exhibited excellent reversibility. The Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 peaks gradually increased in size, corresponding to the intercalation of Zn2+ into theMnO2 cathode, and with the extraction of Zn2+, these peaks decreased in size (Fig. 5c). In addition, the O 1 s and N 1 s XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5d, e; the O 1s spectrum contains three peaks, corresponding to Mn-O, O-H, and C-Mn-O bonds, respectively. The enhancement of the Mn-O and Mn-N peaks is attributable to Zn2+ extraction, increasing the binding energy of the restored Mn4+ with electronegative functional groups. Figure 5f and g show in situ Raman spectra of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell. The peak at 653 cm\u22121 (v) is assignable to the Mn-O stretching vibration in the dz2 orbital of [MnO6] octahedra. Due to the effect of redox reactions on the Mn-O stretching vibrations, the Mn-O energy band changed significantly when the applied potential was decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 V and then back to 2.0 V. Specifically, the intensity of the Mn-O peak gradually increased when the cell was charged to a higher potential, revealing the presence of an oxidized form of elemental Mn (i.e., Mn4+), that is, Mn was oxidized and theMn-O bonds in [MnO6] octahedra were shortened. Conversely, when the cell was discharged to a lower potential,Mn4+was reduced and theMn-Obonds of [MnO6] octahedra were elongated, causing the weakening of the Mn-O stretching vibration in the dz2 orbital of [MnO6] octahedra37. This further demonstrates the reversibility of the Zn/CPZ-H//MnO2 full cell during the charging/discharging process. The Zn2+-intercalation/\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 8\nde-intercalation during the electrochemical process is illustrated in Fig. 5h. The promotion of the two-electron reduction (Mn4+ to Mn2+) caused the MnO2 cathode to increase its storage of Zn\n2+ during the electrochemical process, whichprovided additional energy for storage in the Zn/MnO2 system.\nSustainability of the CPZ-H electrolyte in a Zn/MnO2 full cell The sustainable biomass composition of the CPZ-H electrolyte was exploredby examining the recyclability anddegradability of theCPZ-H electrolyte in a Zn/MnO2 battery. As shown in Fig. 6a, the aged CPZ-H electrolyte was dried and grinded into powder, and then was treated with a few drops of water to form a solution and transferred into molds, whichwere heated to obtain recovered CPZ-H (rCPZ-H). Owing to the high powder healing ability of this biomass hydrogel, it can be recovered by a simple process, which provides a good feasibility verification for its large-scale recycling technology. To survey the electrochemical performance of rCPZ-H electrolytes, we combined Zn foil with a rCPZ-H (Zn/rCPZ-H) symmetric cell. The resulting Zn/rCPZ-H// Zn/rCPZ-H symmetric cell operated continuously over 750h at a current density of 5mA cm\u22122 and a limited capacity (10mAh cm\u22122; Fig. 6b),\nMnO2 cathode during an electrochemical process.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 9\nwhich revealed that the rCPZ-H electrolyte retained high utilization value. Therefore, the rCPZ-H electrolyte was also used in an aqueousacid Zn/MnO2 full battery, which was found to exhibit an excellent cycling performance: a capacity retention of 86.7 % after 2,400 cycles at a current density of 5 A g\u22121 (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the rate performance of the Zn/rCPZ-H//MnO2 full cell at various current densities (Fig. 6d, e) shows that it had capacity retention of 68.7% at a high current density of 5 A g\u22121. Moreover, the Zn/rCPZ-H//MnO2 full cell achieved an average capacity of 453.6mAhg\u22121 when the current density was switched back to 0.1 A g\u22121 after 60 cycles, and a high CE (>97.6%), demonstrating the good reversibility of the rCPZ-H\nelectrolyte. To demonstrate the practical application of the Zn/rCPZH//MnO2 full cell, two cells were connected in series (Supplementary\nFig. 22) to power a small elevator, which enabled it to rapidly lift a weight a height of 8 cm (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Movie 1). To evaluate the mechanical performance of the rCPZ-H electrolyte in practical applications, it was molded into a traction rope, which was then used in the small elevator. The structure of this rope was largely undamagedduring the operation of the elevator, evenduring repeated operations. In addition, the rCPZ-H electrolyte could be used in the form of a conveyor belt on a motor to maintain the high-speed operation of a small Ferris wheel (Supplementary Fig. 23 and\npowered by a Zn/rCPZ-H//MnO2 full cell.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4435 10\nSupplementary Movie 2), which showcases the excellent scratch resistance and toughness of the rCPZ-H electrolyte, owing to its dynamic and reversible hydrogen-bonding and ionic complexation capacity.\nIn addition, the CPZ-H electrolyte is biodegradable, as its key structural components are CS and PASP, so it can be directly biodegraded after recycling and reuse. Specifically, asdiagrammed inFig. 7a, the CPZ-H electrolyte could be degraded into plant nutrients by bacteria and microorganisms after being buried in the soil. To verify the feasibility of this process, a small piece of CPZ-Helectrolytewas placed in a Bacillus culture fluid, which was maintained at a constant temperature and humidity. The CPZ-H electrolyte was gradually decomposed and absorbedby theBacillus, and almostdisappearedover a 90- day incubation (Fig. 7b\u2013e). Moreover, the distribution of bacteria on the CPZ-H surface at different periods was observed by microscope. With increasing incubation time, the CPZ-H electrolyte was effectively decomposed and absorbed by the Bacillus, and the nutrients they obtained promoted their continued growth on the surface of the CPZH electrolyte (Fig. 7f\u2013i). Thus, ultimately, the constituents of the CPZ-H electrolytes would be naturally released into the environment (Fig. 7j) bymicroorganisms andwould serve as fertilizer for plants. Overall, this green microbial degradation method exhibited a satisfactory degradation rate as compared to those that have been previously reported for biodegradable energy-storage devices (Fig. 7k)22,38\u201342."

            "text": "In summary, an innovative biomass-based electrolyte, the CPZ-H electrolyte, was fabricated from CS and PASP and found to effectively inhibit side reactions and the uncontrolled formation of Zn dendrites. Given the numerous anionic functional groups of CS and PASP, with their high adsorption energy for the Zn (002) crystal plane, it was proposed that a synergistic mechanism within the CPZ-H electrolyte accounted for this inhibition. Thismechanism involves equilibrium ion flux and preferred horizontal orientation of growth of the crystal plane on the Zn anode (an E-P mechanism). Therefore, the Zn/CPZ-H//Zn/ CPZ-H symmetric cell had a high cyclic performance (2200h) with excellent reversibility at 10mAcm\u22122. Due to the excellent H+-redistribution and desolvation ability of the CPZ-H electrolyte in an acidic environment, an aqueous-acid Zn/CPZ-H/MnO2 full cell based on a two-electron redox reaction achieved a large capacity (523.6mAhg\u22121) and excellent cyclic performance, with a capacity retention of 92.5% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the CPZ-H electrolyte is sustainable and has high recycling usability, creating infinite possibilities for the development of green batteries. This study has established a significant path toward the development of multifunctional and sustainable biomass electrolytes for use in high-performance green and aqueous energy-storage devices."

Finally, the CPZ-H electrolyte were obtained by soaking the gels in deionized water until the value of pH closes to 7.0. For the CP-H electrolyte, the preparation process is similar to the CPZ-H electrolyte except that without the addition of ZnSO4. For the preparation of Zn/ CPZ-H anode, the above mixture solution were injected into a mold\nand CPZ-H electrolyte with a thickness of ~0.15mm was achieved by heating at 60 \u00b0C for 1.5 h and soaking the gels in deionized water until the value of pH closes to neutral.

Subsequently, the as-prepared CPZ-H electrolyte were soaked in deionizedwater until the value of pH closes to 7.0. And then, the CPZ-H electrolyte was immersed in H2SO4 solution (PH= 1) and H2SO4 solution (PH= 2), respectively. The CPZ-H, after fully absorbing protons, was attached to the Zn foil and cut into a diameter of 16mm round as an anode.
