    "abstractText": "We provide the all-loop structure of gauge-variant operators required for the renormalisation of Green\u2019s functions with insertions of twist-two operators in Yang-Mills theory. Using this structure we work out an explicit basis valid up to 4-loop order for an arbitrary compact simple gauge group. To achieve this we employ a generalised gauge symmetry, originally proposed by Dixon and Taylor, which arises after adding to the YangMills Lagrangian also operators proportional to its equation of motion. Promoting this symmetry to a generalised BRST symmetry allows to generate the ghost operator from a single exact operator in the BRST-generalised sense. We show that our construction complies with the theorems by Joglekar and Lee. We further establish the existence of a generalised anti-BRST symmetry which we employ to derive non-trivial relations among the anomalous dimension matrices of ghost and equation-of-motion operators. For the purpose of demonstration we employ the formalism to compute the N = 2, 4 Mellin moments of the gluonic splitting function up to 4 loops and its N = 6 Mellin moment up to 3 loops, where we also take advantage of additional simplifications of the background field formalism.",

            "text": "The increasing precision with which particle collisions are being measured at the Large Hadron Collider have pushed theoretical predictions in QCD to the next-to-next-to-nextto-leading order (N3LO) in perturbative QCD. First calculations at this order were completed for Higgs boson production [1\u20136] and the Drell-Yan process [4, 7]. Even 2 \u2192 2 reactions may become feasible at this order in the not-too-far future as first results for 3-loop dijet production amplitudes have become available [8, 9]. One of the dominant remaining theoretical uncertainties associated to such N3LO calculations is now related to the lack of knowledge of the 4-loop splitting functions, which determine the evolution of the parton densities at the relevant perturbative order, and which are known completely only up to three loops [10\u201328].\nSubstantial efforts to improve this situation have already been made. In the non-singlet sector, after pioneering calculations of lower moments [29], numerical approximations for the 4-loop splitting functions are now known to high accuracy. An analytic reconstruction was achieved in the limit of leading number of colours [30] and for subleading corrections in the number of quark flavors, nf , [31]; the leading nf -contributions were known already for some time [32] to all orders in perturbation theory. Even some low N -moments at five loops [33] are already known. In the singlet sector instead only a handful of lower moments have been calculated so far at the four-loop level [34] and this input was found to be insufficient for reliable numerical approximations.\nThe reason for why calculations in the non-singlet sector are so much more advanced than those in the singlet sector is not only due to more numerous and complex Feynman diagrams but also due to a more powerful framework. This framework is based on the operator product expansion (OPE) [35, 36], which allows the extraction of Mellin moments from the anomalous dimensions of leading-twist light-cone operators. While the renormalisation of such operators entering in the non-singlet sector is relatively straight forward, the renormalisation of the corresponding gluonic operators in the off-shell formalism (likely the most promising framework to allow for progress at four loops at this time) is non-trivial due to the mixing into unphysical operators. The mixing into these operators arises from subgraphs with external gluons and ghosts which contain the insertion of the singlet operator; schematic examples appearing at four loops are depicted in figure 1.\nAn explicit basis for these unphysical operators, valid up to the two-loop level, was worked out by Dixon and Taylor already almost fifty years ago [37] and was employed in the computation of one-loop Mellin moments in the Feynman gauge. Hamberg and Van Neerven about twenty years later managed to successfully employ the same framework to perform calculations at the 2-loop order in dimensional regularisation [13]. This calculation was also repeated very recently [38]. It is interesting to note that the calculation by Hamberg and Van Neerven managed to successfully resolve a number of conflicting results [10\u201312] which were present at that time because of negligence of the mixing into unphysical operators.\nNevertheless the structure of the basis proposed by Dixon and Taylor remained somewhat mysterious. This was pointed out in particular by Collins [39], who argued that the\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nunphysical operators appeared to be in conflict with a general theorem which states that the unphysical operators should be either proportional to the equation of motion (EOM) or BRST-exact. This theorem was in part first conjectured by Kluberg-Stern and Zuber [40, 41] before it was proven by Joglekar and Lee [42\u201344]. Another proof based on cohomology theory was later provided by Henneaux [45].\nIn the present paper we revisit the problem. More concretely we reinterpret the basis of Dixon and Taylor as being build up from EOM and ghost operators. The former are proportional to the EOM of the gauge invariant part of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. Using this notion we are able to write down the general form of the EOM operators at arbitrary loop orders. As was noted already by Dixon and Taylor the combined Lagrangian consisting of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian and their EOM operators is invariant under a generalised gauge symmetry. This generalised gauge symmetry can then be promoted to a generalised BRST symmetry. We prove that the generalised BRST transformation is nilpotent and that the ghost operator can be constructed from a single BRST-exact operator in the generalised BRST sense. While the generalised BRST symmetry was in part pointed out already by Hamberg and Van Neerven in [13], it was not clearly spelt out how to use it to construct the ghost Lagrangian. We apply the formalism to work out the explicit form of EOM and ghost operators up to four-loop order. We also show that the basis is in accord with the theorem of Joglekar and Lee.\nTo further simplify calculations in the OPE framework we explore two further symmetry principles. We observe that the ghost term of the unphysical operator can also be generated from a generalised anti-BRST symmetry [46\u201349] and a corresponding generalised anti-BRST-exact operator. In particular we employ this alternative formulation to derive a set of nontrivial identities among the anomalous dimensions of the EOM and ghost operators. We also make use of the background field formalism [40, 41, 50\u201352, 52, 53, 53, 54]. Background field gauge invariance allows one to reduce by one the maximum number of loops at which the anomalous dimensions of the EOM and ghost operators are required \u2014 thereby yielding another welcome simplification for the calculation of unphysical counterterms. For the purpose of demonstration we will employ the formalism to re-calculate the N = 2 and N = 4 moments of the purely gluonic contributions in the singlet sector up to 4 loops and the N = 6 moment up to three loops.\nIn the following we give a brief outline of the paper. In section 2 we summarise our conventions and review some of the relevant background material. The construction of EOM operators and the generalised gauge symmetry is discussed in section 3. The\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nconstruction of ghost operators and the generalised BRST and anti-BRST invariance is discussed in section 4. There also the compatibility of our construction with the theorems of Joglekar and Lee is shown. The concepts are employed to build an independent basis of gauge-variant operators in section 5 for various fixed values of N . The background-field formulation is presented in section 6 and employed in section 7 for the computation of Mellin moments up to 4-loop order. We conclude in section 8."

This feature becomes most transparent after the introduction of an auxiliary field ba(x), also known as the Nakanishi-Lautrup field [55, 56]. In this formulation the Lagrangian is written as\nLGF+G = \u2212ba\u2202\u00b5Aa\u00b5 + \u03be 2(b a)2 \u2212 ca \u2202\u00b5Dab\u00b5 cb . (2.9)\nEq. (2.9) can be seen to be equivalent to eq. (2.6) after substituting the solution of the EOM ba = 1\u03be\u2202\u00b5Aa\u00b5. The BRST variation leaving this Lagrangian invariant [57, 58] is defined as\n\u03b4BRST(\u2022) \u2261 \u03b8 s(\u2022) , (2.10)\nwhere \u03b8 is a Grassmann number, s denotes the BRST operator, which being nilpotent satisfies s2(\u2022) = 0, and whose action on the fields is given by\nsba = 0 , sAa\u00b5 = (D\u00b5 c)a , sca = \u2212 g\n2 f abccb cc , sca = \u2212ba . (2.11)\nThe BRST invariance of eq. (2.9) can be made manifest by writing it in BRST-exact form, that is as the BRST variation of an ancestor operator:\nLGF+G = sOancestor , Oancestor = ca [ \u2202\u00b5Aa\u00b5 \u2212\n1 2\u03beb\na ] . (2.12)\nAn interpretation of the BRST symmetry is that it corresponds to a certain subclass of gauge transformations, where the parameter \u03c9(x) of the gauge transformation is identified with the ghost field times a Grassmann number. There exists in fact a second such symmetry in the gauge-fixed Lagrangian where the role of the ghost field in the BRST variations is replaced with that of the anti-ghost field. This leads to the so-called anti-BRST symmetry [46\u201349]. To discuss this symmetry we first introduce another auxiliary field:\nb\u0304a = \u2212ba + gfabcc\u0304bcc .

It is then conventional to introduce the notation\nF\u00b5;a = \u2206\u03bd F\u00b5\u03bd;a, Aa = \u2206\u00b5A\u00b5;a, D = \u2206\u00b5D\u00b5, \u2202 = \u2206\u00b5\u2202\u00b5 .

(2.20)\nIt is well known that the operator O(N)1 (x) when inserted into general Green\u2019s functions mixes with non-physical operators under renormalisation. A basis for these non-physical operators will be constructed in the following sections consisting of two kinds of operators, namely operators proportional to the EOM, defined in eq. (2.4), and operators containing ghosts (G). We therefore include besides O(N)1 (x) also the operators O (N) EOM and O (N) G (x). The complete Lagrangian is then given by\nL\u0303(A, c\u0304, c; g, \u03be) = L0 + LGF+G + C(N)1 O (N) 1 (x) +O (N) EOM +O (N) G (x) , (2.21)\nwhere C(N)1 is the Wilson coefficient associated to O (N) 1 (x). The mass dimension of O (N) 1 (x), O(N)EOM and O (N) G (x) equals the dimension of space-time, d, this is achieved by defining \u2206 to carry a mass dimension of 2/N \u2212 1. Let us now briefly discuss the renormalisation of L\u0303, which in eq. (2.21) was defined in terms of physical or equivalently renormalised fields and couplings. The counterterms required to make finite all correlators of the fields Aa\u00b5, ca and c\u0304a at distinct positions can be readily generated by replacing the fields and couplings with their bare counterparts in L\u0303(Ab, c\u0304b, cb; gb, \u03beb) with\nAb;\u00b5a (x) = Z 1/2 3 A \u00b5 a(x) , c\u0304ba(x) = Z1/2c c\u0304ba(x) , cba(x) = Z1/2c cba(x) ,\ngb = \u00b5 gZg , \u03beb = \u03beZ3 . (2.22)\nThis replacement is not sufficient to renormalise correlators with an insertion of O(N)1 . For this purpose it is convenient to introduce the vector notation ~O(N) = (O(N)1 , . . . ,O (N) n ),\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nwith O(N)1 defined in eq. (2.20) and the remaining components O (N) i>1 , to which we associate Wilson coefficients Ci, forming a basis of operators spanning the space of EOM and ghost operators O(N)EOM and O (N) G . The required counterterms are obtained by taking into account the mixing of the operators under renormalisation. This is achieved by making the replacement\nC(N),bi = Z (N) ji C (N) j .\nThe bare Lagrangian then takes the form\nL\u0303(Ab, c\u0304b, cb; Cbi , gb, \u03beb) = L0(Ab; gb) + LGF+G(Ab, c\u0304b, cb; gb, \u03beb) + \u2211 i,j C(N)i Z (N) ij O (N),b j (2.23)\nwhere the O(N),bi denote the operators written in terms of bare couplings and fields. It is well known [40\u201345] that the structure of Zij is block triangular in that the physical operator O(N)1 may mix into O (N) i>1 but not vice versa. This is discussed further in section 4.2."

[Tr(T a AT b AT c AT d A) + symmetric permutations] , (3.21)\nwhere (TA)bac = ifabc. Going beyond four loops would not only require further operators, i.e. O(N),k>4EOM , but also further color structures in the definitions of Cijk and Cijkl. In fact to arbitrary loop-order, there are arbitrarily many independent color structures contributing to Cijk and Cijkl. If one was to work in a fixed gauge group this task would be far simpler. For instance in SU(Nc) we know that the complete basis at 4 and 5 points is expressible in terms of single and double traces of permutations of the generators in the fundamental representation. The penalty for working in an arbitrary gauge group thus becomes increasingly higher at higher loops, but is still mild at the four-loop level. Let us now come to the definition of the sums appearing in eqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.16). These are defined such that we sum over all non-negative integer values of the indices i, j, k, l, appearing in the sum which satisfy the respective constraint, e.g. i+j+k = N\u22124. While this sum notation leads to reasonably compact definitions of the EOM operators, it does also lead to overcounting. For instance in the order g term we sum over all indices i+j = N\u22123, but since the associated color tensor, fabc, is asymmetric under exchange of b and c the operators appearing in the sum for j > i are related to those with j < i. To compensate this over-counting of independent operators we impose relations on the \u03ba-coefficients. In general there exists a lot of freedom in how to choose these relations. A particularly convenient choice of constraints is obtained by demanding the \u03ba-coefficients to satisfy the same relations as their respective color factors. That this works can be understood as follows. If we were to use up all the color identities, we would clearly land in an independent basis of operators. By imposing the same identities on the \u03ba-coefficients, we effectively ensure that solving these identities would lead to the right degrees of freedom \u2014 that is the right number of independent \u03ba-coefficients. This choice is in spirit not dissimilar to the BCJ-choice of numerators [59] for Feynman diagrams where the numerators of Feynman diagrams are chosen such that they satisfy the same constraints as the corresponding color factors. Here however the motivation is solely to make manipulations with these operators more manageable.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nThese considerations then finally lead us to impose the following relations on the \u03bacoefficients:\n\u03baij + \u03baji = 0, (antisymmetry of f) (3.22)\n\u03ba (1) ijk + \u03ba (1) ikj = 0, (antisymmetry of f) (3.23)\n\u03ba (1) ijkl + \u03ba (1) ijlk = 0, (antisymmetry of f) (3.24)\n\u03ba (1) ijk + \u03ba (1) jki + \u03ba (1) kij = 0, (Jacobi) (3.25)\n\u03ba (1) ijkl + \u03ba (1) iklj + \u03ba (1) iljk = 0, (Jacobi) (3.26)\n\u03ba (1) ijkl + \u03ba (1) jilk + \u03ba (1) lkji + \u03ba (1) klij = 0, (double Jacobi) (3.27)\n\u03ba (2) ijk = \u03ba (2) jik = \u03ba (2) ikj = \u03ba (2) kji = \u03ba (2) jki = \u03ba (2) kij , (symmetry of d4) (3.28)\n\u03ba (3) ijk = \u03ba (3) ikj , (antisymmetry of f) (3.29)\n\u03ba (3) ijk + \u03ba (3) jki + \u03ba (3) kij = 0, (generalised Jacobi ) (3.30)\n\u03ba (2) ijkl + \u03ba (2) ijlk = 0, (antisymmetry of f) (3.31)\n\u03ba (2) ijkl = \u03ba (2) jikl, (symmetry of d4) . (3.32)\nAn independent set of operators is then found for any given N by solving these relations. Fixing N this is in principle a straight forward exercise, but is somewat difficult to do keeping N general. We now give the color identities which lead to eqs. (3.22)\u2013(3.32). The Jacobi relation is as usual,\n(ff)abcd + (ff)acdb + (ff)adbc = 0 . (3.33)\nBy the double Jacobi relation we refer to the identity\n(fff)abcde + (fff)acbed + (fff)adebc + (fff)aedcb = 0 , (3.34)\nwhich itself can be derived by repeated use of the Jacobi relation. Another consequence of the Jacobi relation is what is sometimes refered to as a generalised Jacobi relation [60]:\ndabcde4f + dbcdae4f + dcdabe4f + ddabce4f = 0 . (3.35)\nThis identity does not lead to any relations among the coefficients \u03ba(2)ijkl, since we fix the position of the index a, which contracts the EOM, to be in the d4. The relation would connect it to operators where the a would be attached to the corresponding f . However contracting this relation with fdeg leads to\nCA d abcd 4 + dabcd4ff + dbcad4ff + dcabd4ff = 0 . (3.36)\nCombining this equation with its permutations, and using the symmetry properties,\ndabcd4ff = dabdc4ff = dbacd4ff = dbadc4ff , (3.37)\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nwhich follow directly from the definition in eq. (3.20), one can further derive the less obvious relation\ndabcd4ff = dcdab4ff . (3.38)\nCombining eqs. (3.36)\u2013(3.38) we then derive\nCA d abcd 4f + dabcd4ff + dacdb4ff + dadbc4ff = 0 . (3.39)\nThis relation implies that operators with color structures d4 and d4ff are linearly dependent. To avoid this undesirable feature we introduced the modified color factor d4\u0302ff which satisfies\ndabcd 4\u0302ff + dacdb 4\u0302ff + dadbc 4\u0302ff = 0 , (3.40)\nand is therefore independent of dabcd4f . Having discussed an explicit basis of the EOM operators and their color structures we can now consider the generalised gauge invariance discussed in section 3.2. To 4-loop order the \u2206-dependent part of the transformation reads\n\u03b4\u2206wA a \u00b5 = \u2212\u2206\u00b5\n[ \u03b7 ( \u2202N\u22121\u03c9a ) + g\n\u2211 i1+i2 =N\u22123 C\u0303a;a1 a2i1 i2 ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2+1\u03c9a2 )\n+ g2 \u2211\ni1+i2+i3 =N\u22124\nC\u0303a;a1 a2 a3i1 i2 i3\n( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3+1\u03c9a3 ) (3.41)\n+ g3 \u2211\ni1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+i4 =N\u22125\nC\u0303a;a1 a2 a3 a4i1 i2 i3 i4\n( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3Aa3 ) ( \u2202i4+1\u03c9a4 ) +O(g4) ] ,\nwhere C\u0303a;a1...ani1...in involve the same colour structures which appear in eqs.

(3.51)\nThe use and power of these relations will become clear in the next section, where we discuss how the generalised gauge symmetry is promoted to a generalised BRST symmetry."

            "text": "The main virtue of the generalised gauge transformation, \u03b4\u03c9 + \u03b4\u2206\u03c9 , which we established in section 3.2, is that we can promote it to a generalised BRST (gBRST) transformation:\n\u03b4\u2032BRST(\u2022) \u2261 \u03b8 s\u2032(\u2022) , s\u2032 = s+ s\u2206. (4.1)\nHere s is the action of the usual BRST transformation and s\u2206 is the new \u2206-dependent part. To define the action of this symmetry on the fields we follow [15, 42]. The only nonvanishing action is the variation of the gauge field. It is constructed simply by replacing the gauge parameter \u03c9(x)a in eq. (3.41) with the ghost field c(x)a. We thus obtain\ns\u2206b a = 0 , s\u2206ca = 0, s\u2206ca = 0 , (4.2)\nand\ns\u2206A a \u00b5 = \u2212\u2206\u00b5 \u221e\u2211 k=0 gk\u22121 \u2211\ni1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ik =N\u2212k+1\nC\u0303a;a1 ... a4i1 ... i4\n( \u2202i1Aa1 ) . . . ( \u2202ik\u22121Aak\u22121 ) ( \u2202ik+1cak ) . (4.3)\nFurthermore eq. (3.9) can be promoted to an idenitity for the corresponding BRST variations:\ns\u2206A \u00b5 a(x) + sG\u00b5a \u2212 g fabc G \u00b5 b cc = 0 . (4.4)\nThis relation is very useful. For instance it allows us to show that s\u2032 is nilpotent. In the following we prove this up to terms of order \u22062, which is all we require for the renormalisation of Green\u2019s functions with single insertions of twist-2 operators. First we note that\ns\u2032 2 = s2 + ss\u2206 + s\u2206s+O(\u22062) = O(\u22062) . (4.5)\nGiven s2 = 0 we therefore require\nss\u2206 + s\u2206s = 0 . (4.6)\nTo prove this identity it is sufficient to show that it holds for the gauge field. We start with\nss\u2206A a \u00b5 = \u2212s(sGa\u00b5 \u2212 g fabc Gb\u00b5 cc) = g fabc s(Gb\u00b5 cc)\n= g fabcsGb\u00b5 cc \u2212 g2\n2 G b \u00b5f abcf cdecdce (4.7)\n= g fabcsGb\u00b5 cc \u2212 g2fabcf cdeGd\u00b5cbce\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nwhere we used eq. (4.4) and nilpotence of s in the first line and the Jacobi identity and index relabeling to get to the last line. Next we now consider\ns\u2206sA a \u00b5 = s\u2206(Dac\u00b5 cc) = gfabcs\u2206Ab\u00b5cc\n= \u2212gfabcsGb\u00b5 cc + g2fabc f bde Gd\u00b5 cecc (4.8) = \u2212gfabcsGb\u00b5 cc + g2fabc f cde Gd\u00b5 cbce = \u2212ss\u2206Aa\u00b5 .\nThis proves eq. (4.5). The nilpotence is thus a direct consequence of the generalised gauge invariance. Let us now come to the general form of the gauge-fixing+ghost Lagrangian required to renormalise arbitrary Green\u2019s functions with single insertions of O(N)1 . We propose that it can be represented as follows:\nL\u2032GF+G = s\u2032Oancestor , (4.9)\nwhere the ancestor is the same one which appears in the usual gauge-fixing and ghost term required for the Yang-Mills Lagrangian; that is the one we defined in eq. (2.12). Expanding out s\u2032 we thus obtain\nL\u2032GF+G = LGF+G +O (N) G (4.10)\nwith O(N)G = s\u2206Oancestor = \u2212c a \u2202\u00b5 s\u2206A a \u00b5 . (4.11)\nWe can then rewrite the complete Lagrangian, introduced in eq. (2.21), as\nL\u0303 = LEGI + L\u2032GF+G , (4.12)\nwith LEGI = LYM +O(N)1 +O (N) EOM . (4.13)\nIn this formulation the Lagrangian is then manifestly invariant under the generalised BRST transformation \u03b4\u2032BRST. For LEGI this follows immediately from its invariance under generalised gauge transformations. And given the nilpotence of s\u2032 it also follows that L\u2032GF+G is invariant under the symmetry, as it lies in the image of s\u2032. Instead LEGI lies in the kernel of s\u2032. The cohomology of the generalised BRST transformation, defined as the kernel modulo the image of s\u2032, is thus unaffected of the details of the gauge fixing function \u2014 an important feature which underlies also the usual BRST symmetry."

            "text": "Let us now come to an important issue concerning the mixing between gauge invariant and gauge variant operators. For physics to be independent of the gauge variant operators the renormalisation matrix Z(N)ij should be block triangular. This theorem was proven by Joglekar and Lee [42] and states, essentially, that the block triangular structure is present as long as the unphysical operators belong to two different operator classes:2\n2Note that this is slightly different from the classification into EOM and BRST-exact operators which is often stated and which can be found for instance in [39].\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\n\u2022 Class I operators:\nOI = \u03b4S\n\u03b4A\u00b5a \u03b4F [A, c, c\u0304] \u03b4(\u2202\u00b5c\u0304a) + sF [A, c, c\u0304] (4.14)\n\u2022 Class II operators:\nOII = \u03b4S\n\u03b4ca Xa[A, c, c\u0304] (4.15)\nwhere X and F are local (polynomial) functionals of the fields. For our construction this would then imply that Z(N)j1 = 0. However it is not obvious that the ghost and EOM operators presented here fall into these classes. We will now show that they do. Using eq. (4.4) we can write eq. (4.11) as follows:\nO(N)G = c a \u2202\u00b5 sGa\u00b5 \u2212 gfabcca \u2202\u00b5 Gb\u00b5cc . (4.16)\nUsing now that s(c\u0304a\u2202\u00b5Ga\u00b5) = \u2202\u00b5baG\u00b5;a + \u2202\u00b5c\u0304a sG\u00b5a and the EOM of the ba-field, eq. (4.16) becomes\nO(N)G = \u2212s(c\u0304 a\u2202Ga) + [1 \u03be (\u2202\u2202\u03bdAb;\u03bd) + gfabc(\u2202ca)cc ] Gb . (4.17)\nCombining this expression with eq. (3.3) and eq. (2.8) we thus obtain\nO(N)G +O (N) EOM = s(\u2202c\u0304 aGa) + \u03b4S \u03b4Aa Ga . (4.18)\nIt is thus apparent that our expressions for the ghost and EOM operators are just Class I operators, and therefore comply with the theorems of Joglekar and Lee, if we identify F = \u2202c\u0304aGa in eq. (4.14). In our case the class II operators can not actually contribute due to the leading twist nature. This follows as the ghost EOM \u03b4S\u03b4ca is already twist 3. For a similar reason Ga can also not depend on ghost and anti-ghost fields at twist two. The structure of the renormalisation matrix Z(N)i j is therefore, by the theorem of Joglekar and Lee, expected to be of the form\nZ(N) =  Z (N) 1 1 Z (N) 1 2 . . . Z (N) 1n 0 Z(N)2 2 . . . Z (N) 2n . . . . . . . . .\n0 Z(N)n 2 . . . Z (N) nn\n . (4.19)\nSo while O(N)1 may mix into the unphysical operators O (N) i>1 , the unphysical operators can only mix among themselves. For calculations of physical quantities, such as S-matrix elements, it is thus fully sufficient to know Z(N)1 1 . We require Z1 i>1 only when renormalising Green\u2019s functions with insertions of O(N)1 . Instead the Z (N) i>1 j>1 are only required for calculations of Green\u2019s functions with insertions of the unphysical operators.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7"

The ghost operator for arbitrary N as required for calculations up to the four loop level is thus determined to be\nO(N)G = \u2211 k O(N),kG , (4.21)\nwith\nO(N),1G = \u2212\u03b7 (\u2202c a) ( \u2202N\u22121ca ) , (4.22)\nO(N),2G = \u2212g \u2211 i1+i2 =N\u22123 C\u0303a;a1 a2i1 i2 (\u2202c a) ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2+1ca2 ) , (4.23)\nO(N),3G = \u2212g 2 \u2211 i1+i2+i3 =N\u22124 C\u0303a;a1 a2 a3i1 i2 i3 (\u2202c a) ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3+1ca3 ) , (4.24)\nO(N),4G = \u2212g 3 \u2211 i1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+i4 =N\u22125 C\u0303a;a1 a2 a3 a4i1 i2 i3 i4 (\u2202c a) ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3Aa3 ) ( \u2202i4+1ca4 ) . (4.25)\nThe ghost operator is therefore completely determined by the generalised BRST symmetry, or, equivalently, by the generalised gauge invariance and the particular form of the gauge-fixing term. Since the couplings appearing in eq. (4.21) are determined as linear combinations of an independent set of the \u03ba-couplings of the EOM operators we can effectively combine the independent parts of the ghost operator with those of the different EOM operators, collecting terms together which share common \u03ba-coupling coefficients, into what Joglekar and Lee called Class I operators. One welcome result is thus that the generalised BRST symmetry vastly reduces the independent set of operators one needs to consider. This was of course already oberserved\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nin [37] and [13] although it was accounted for in slightly different ways. In [37] the relations among the couplings were derived by enforcing the Lie algebra structure on the generalised gauge invariance. Instead in [13] they followed from the generalised BRST invariance of the complete Lagrangian. We like to stress here that in both these references the basis was only considered to two-loop level, and that no connection to EOM operators and BRST exact operators was made. The explicit form of the gauge variant operators and their connection to the ghost operators was thus rather non-trivial and somewhat mysterious. We hope that our presentation finally sheds some light into this long-standing puzzle. Another advantage of the formalism is that in order to compute the full anomalous dimension mixing matrix we only need to consider the mixing of O(N)1 into ghost operators, which depending on the method of computation may also require the mixing of the ghost operators among themselves. This is of course much easier to compute then the mixing of O(N)1 into the EOM operators, whose renormalisation would naively require the computation of multi-gluon correlators. Instead the anomalous dimensions of ghost operators can be extracted from multi-gluon correlators with a ghost anti-ghost pair; which yields a welcome reduction of complexity. This point will be discussed in more detail in section 7 with reference to specific examples."

What is more surprising is that the ghost\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\noperator generated by the anti-gBRST exact operator,\nO(N)G = \u2212c a \u2202\u00b5 s\u2206A a \u00b5, (4.28)\n= (\u2202ca) \u03b7 (\u2202N\u22121ca)+ g \u2211 i1+i2 =N\u22123 C\u0303a;a1 a2i1 i2 ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2+1ca2 )\n+g2 \u2211\ni1+i2+i3 =N\u22124\nC\u0303a;a1 a2 a3i1 i2 i3\n( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3+1ca3 )\n+g3 \u2211\ni1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+i4 =N\u22125\nC\u0303a;a1 a2 a3 a4i1 i2 i3 i4\n( \u2202i1Aa1 ) ( \u2202i2Aa2 ) ( \u2202i3Aa3 ) ( \u2202i4+1ca4 ) +O(g4)  , is at first sight not equivalent to its gBRST generated cousin.

Identifying the r.h.s. of eqs. (4.21) and (4.28) we then find, after using integration by parts and the product rule, the following relation:\n0 = \u2211\ni1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+in =N\u2212n\u22121\n(\u2202ca) ( \u2202i1Aa1 ) . . .

Let us remark that the summand does not necessarily vanish independently here. It does only as long as the field contents and its derivatives are independent in each term in the sum. One therefore has to be careful when applying this identity. Using the definitions in eqs. (3.42)\u2013(3.44) we then derive the following set of constraints on the couplings of the ghost operators:\n\u03b7 (1) i1i2\n= \u2212 i1\u2211\ns1=0 (\u22121)s1+i2 ( s1 + i2 s1 ) \u03b7 (1) (i1\u2212s1)(i2+s1), (4.31)\n\u03b7 (1) i1i2i3\n= i1\u2211\ns1=0 i2\u2211 s2=0 (s1 + s2 + i3)! s1!s2!i3!

(4.37)\nTo the best of our knowledge the existence of these kind of identities was not known by the authors of the previous works [13, 37]. But we can use their one-loop all-N results for \u03b7\n(1) ij , which in their work was named \u03b7i to check eq. (4.31) at this order. Their one-loop result in our notation is given by\n\u03b7 (1),1 ij = 1 2N(N \u2212 1)\n[ (\u22121)i \u2212 3 ( N \u2212 2 i ) \u2212 ( N \u2212 2 i+ 1 )] . (4.38)\nSubstituting this result into eq. (4.31) we then find:\n\u03b7 (1),1 ij + i\u2211 s=0 (\u22121)s+j ( s+ j s ) \u03b7 (1),1 (i\u2212s)(j+s) = 3 2 (\u22121)N \u2212 1 N(N \u2212 1) ( N \u2212 2 1 + i ) . (4.39)\nThe right hand side thus indeed vanishes for all positive even values of N , as required. We initially found these identities after inspecting the results of explicit calculations. We could explain the extra relations by imposing a ghost-antighost exchange symmetry; whose origin we then finally derived as a consequence of the anti-gBRST symmetry. Since the \u03b7-coefficients can be written in terms of the \u03ba-coefficients it then follows that the set of \u03ba-coefficients associated to the different EOM operators is not actually independent. That is there are nontrivial relations among the EOM-operators. To solve these relations in closed form is in general difficult but it is not too hard to solve them for fixed N on a case-by-case basis. We will give examples and demonstrate the use of these relations in section 5 where we construct minimal bases of operators for the lowest values of N , and study the size of the basis for higher N ."

As explained there, we only require k \u2264 4 for general N when working up to four loops. The corresponding EOM operators were presented in eqs. (3.13)\u2013(3.16). Another constraint on k arises for fixed N since we only have a total budget of N \u2212 1 \u2202s and As to spend in the G-function multiplying the EOM in eq. (3.4). Since O(k)EOM requires at least k As, this leads to k \u2264 N \u2212 1. Being determined by the gBRST symmetry explicit expressions for all ghost operators required up to four loops are given in eqs. (4.22)\u2013(4.25). Their color decompositions are given in eqs. (3.42)\u2013(3.44), with the Wilson coefficients being related to those of the EOM operators via eqs. (3.45)\u2013(3.51). Finally, the generalised anti-BRST symmetry imposes further constraints given in eqs. (4.31)\u2013(4.37), reducing unphysical operators to a yet smaller basis. Having all these definitions at our deposal we are now in a position to construct explicit and minimal bases. In the remaining part of this section we provide explicitly the bases that are relevant for the renormalisation of O(N)1 , with N = 2, 4 and N = 6, and we describe the space of independent operators for higher N ."

In practice, this fact has important consequences for renormalisation, because it implies that the O(2)EOM and O (2) G mix with O (N) 1 with the same counterterm. In other words, we find only one unphysical operator mixing with the gauge invariant operator of N = 2.

(5.4), (5.5), (5.6) and (5.8) contribute to the renormalisation of O(4)1 starting from two loops [13, 37]. From three loops onwards, we must take into account also the EOM operator O(4),3EOM, eq. (3.15), which reads\nO(4),3EOM = g 2\u03ba (2) 000 d aa1a2a3 (D.F )aAa1Aa2Aa3 , (5.9)\nwhere we applied eqs. (3.23), (3.25), (3.28), (3.29) and (3.30) to restrict the independent couplings to a single operator at mass dimension 6. Due to the fully symmetric nature of the colour structure daa1a2a3 of eq. (5.9), we find that two-point correlators with an insertion of O(4),3EOM vanish automatically at one and at two loops. This implies that O (4),3 EOM enters the renormalisation of O(N)1 only at four loops. We derive the ghost operator O (4),3 G , eq. (4.24), by computing the coefficients (3.46)\u2013(3.48), which enter C\u0303aa1a2a3i1i2i3 in eq. (3.43).

(5.10)\nBy taking into account only the relations deriving from the generalised BRST symmetry, we obtained a set of three unphysical operators, each of them corresponding to the terms in eqs. (5.4)\u2013(5.6) and (5.8)\u2013(5.10) that are proportional to the coefficients \u03b7, \u03ba01 and \u03ba\n(2) 000, respectively. However, the generalised anti-BRST symmetry introduces an additional constraint on these coefficients and reduces the set of independent operators further. By specialising i1, i2 = 0, 1 in eq. (4.31) we find\n2\u03b7(1)10 = \u03b7 (1) 01 \u21d0\u21d2 2\u03ba01 = \u03b7. (5.11)\nThis identity is surprising, because it relates the couplings of different EOM operators, which are free a priori. Therefore the EOM and ghost Lagrangian feature only two independent parameters, e.g. \u03b7 and \u03ba(2)000, which are chosen as coupling constants of two independent unphysical operators.

This picture simplifies significantly by taking into account the anti-BRST relations. For instance, by evaluating eq.

The operators that mix with O(N)1 up to four loops are given, for every value of N , in eqs. (4.22)\u2013(4.25). They involve the colour structures given in eqs. (3.42)\u2013(3.44). Eqs. (3.45)\u2013(3.51) uniquely determine all parameters of the ghost Lagrangian, in terms of the parameters of the EOM operators.\n3 Impose the anti-BRST symmetry, eq. (4.28). The latter implies relations among the coefficients of the EOM operators via eqs. (4.31)\u2013(4.37). These reduce the number of independent operators to a minimal set.\nThe steps above allow to automate easily the construction of the operators, e.g. in FORM [61]. Finding independent operators boils down to finding a set of coefficients which solves the linear relations3 in eqs. (3.22)\u2013(3.32) and (4.31)\u2013(4.36), using the definitions in eqs.

While the basis grows significantly with the spin N , we find that most of the free parameters are associated to the operators O(N),4EOM . For instance, O (N),4 EOM generates 112 out of the 140 unphysical operators at N = 16. Since mixing with O(N),4EOM is only relevant at one loop, see table 2, these operators do not introduce prohibitive obstacles."

            "text": "A powerful trick to simplify calculations of anomalous dimensions is to use the background field method. The basic idea is to split the gauge field into a classical (non-propagating) background field component B and a purely Quantum field component Q as follows:\nA\u00b5a(x) = B\u00b5a (x) +Q\u00b5a(x) . (6.1)\nOne can then consider Green\u2019s functions with external background fields. By using a clever gauge fixing and ghost Lagrangian, for the Quantum field [50\u201353]\nLBGF+BG(Q,B, c\u0304, c) = \u2212 1 2\u03be (D\u0304 \u00b5A\u00b5)2 \u2212 c\u0304aD\u0304ab\u00b5 D\u00b5;bccc , (6.2)\nwhere the background- and background+quantum-field covariant derivatives are defined as\nD\u0304ac\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03b4ac + gfabcBb\u00b5 , Dac\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03b4ac + gfabc(B +Q)b\u00b5 , (6.3)\nit then follows that the quantum gauge-fixed Lagrangian,\nLB(Q,B, c\u0304, c) = L0(Q+B) + LBGF+BG(Q,B, c\u0304, c) , (6.4)\nstays invariant under background-field gauge transformations\n\u03b4BwB a \u00b5(x) = D\u0304ac\u00b5 \u03c9(x)c , \u03b4BwQ a \u00b5(x) = gfabcQb\u00b5\u03c9(x)c . (6.5)\nWe now wish to discuss the form of the complete Lagrangian L\u0303(A, c\u0304, c), introduced in eq. (2.21), which contains besides the Yang-Mills, gauge fixing and ghost terms also the twist-2 gauge invariant gluonic operator ON (A), the EOM operator O(N)EOM(A) and the ghost operator O(N)G (A). Here we have purposefully included a dependence on A, although we will not write out explicitly the dependence on its derivatives. The lifting of L\u0303(A, c\u0304, c) into the background field formalism is straight forward for the gauge invariant part but requires some minor modifications to the EOM and ghost\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\noperator. We therefore introduce their background field versions O(N)BEOM(Q,B, c\u0304, c) and O(N)BG (Q,B). Before giving a detailed derivation of the form of the Lagrangian we will state their form below. The complete Lagrangian then reads\nL\u0303B(A,B, c\u0304, c) = L0(Q+B) + LBGF+BG(Q,B, c\u0304, c) +O(N)1 (Q+B)\n+O(N)BEOM(Q,B, c\u0304, c) +O (N) BG (Q,B) , (6.6)\nwhere\nO(N)BG = \u2211 k O(N),kBG , O (N) BEOM = \u2211 k O(N),kBEOM, (6.7)\nO(N),kBEOM = g k\u22121 (D \u00b7 F (B +Q))a \u2211 i1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ik =N\u2212k\u22121 Ca;a1...aki1...ik ( D\u0304i1Qa1 ) . . .

( D\u0304ik\u22121Qak\u22121 ) ( D\u0304ik+1cak ) . (6.9)\nNote in particular that the coefficients Cabc...ijk... and C\u0303abc...ijk... are identical in their definitions to those defined respectively in eqs. (3.17)\u2013(3.19) and (3.42)\u2013(3.44). The set of EOM and ghost operators in the background gauge formalism is thus directly related to those in the standard formulation.\nTo understand the structure of the EOM operator note that it should be generated from an infinitesimal field transformation of the kind Q \u2192 Q + GB(Q,B, \u2202Q, \u2202B, . . . ), since the Quantum effective action contains a path integral only over the field Q being a functional of B. This fixes the form of the EOM operator as follows:\nO(N)BEOM = \u222b dDx\n\u03b4S0(A+Q) \u03b4Q\u00b5a(x) GB;a\u00b5 (Q\u00b5, B\u00b5, \u2202\u00b5Q, \u2202\u00b5B, . . . )\n= ( D.F (Q+B) )a GB;a(Q,B, \u2202Q, \u2202B, . . . ) (6.10) where we have used also our earlier considerations about the mass dimension and counting of \u2206-contractions. Finally we make the assertion that\nGB;a\u00b5 (Q,B, \u2202Q, \u2202B, . . . ) = Ga\u00b5(Q, D\u0304Q, . . . ) . (6.11)\nwith Ga\u00b5 defined in eqs. (3.2) and (3.3). There are a number of considerations which fix this relation. First we require GB;a to be background-field gauge covariant \u2014 thus it can only depend on Q or on its background-field covariant derivatives. However this fixes only its dependence on Q and B but not its functional form, GB = G. To fix this form we set B = 0, Q = A in the complete Lagrangian, i.e. we consider L\u0303B(A, 0, c\u0304, c). For this Lagrangian to generate the same Green\u2019s functions as L\u0303(A, c\u0304, c) (note their gauge-invariant parts are now identical) we therefore require:\nL\u0303B(A, 0, c\u0304, c) = L\u0303(A, c\u0304, c) . (6.12)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nFrom this it immediately follows that GB;a\u00b5 (Q, D\u0304Q, . . . ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 B=0,Q=A = GB;a\u00b5 (A, \u2202A, . . . ) = Ga\u00b5(A, \u2202A, . . . ) (6.13)\nand we see that eq. (6.11) satisfies these constraints uniquely. Let us now turn our attention to the ghost operator in the background formalism. Again we need to satisfy the constraints that it should coincide with O(N)G when we set B = 0, Q = A and that it should be background gauge invariant. A simple recipe which satisfies all these constraints is to make the replacements A\u2192 Q, \u2202 \u2192 D\u0304 in O(N)G . A more thorough path to arrive at the same answer would involve working out the generalised gauge invariance and its associated generalised BRST symmetry. In turn one could write the ghost operator in gBRST exact form, in the background field formalism."

In the equation above, the operator O(N)i = O (N) i (B + Q) is inserted with zero momentum. Counterterms proportional to O(N)BEOM and O (N) BG are required in order to cancel divergences of the diagrams that contribute to eq. (6.14). Notably, these unphysical operators always involve at least one quantum gluon or a ghost-antighost pair, as it follows from the definitions in eqs. (6.8) and (6.9). Therefore, EOM and ghost operators are only required from the two-loop level onwards, in order to cancel the subdivergences of the correlator in eq. (6.14); and no unphysical counterterm can arise at one loop [54, 62]. In table 4 we report example diagrams showing subdivergences of \u0393(N)Oi;BB, which are renormalised by each term O(N),kEOM . Table 5 summarises the maximal loop order at which each operator O (N),k EOM enters the renormalisation of eq. (6.14). By comparing the last line of tables 2 and 5 we find that there is an advantage in renormalising correlators of background fields, in that unphysical counterterms are needed only up to 3 loops. In contrast without background-field invariance the counterterm O(N),1EOM would be required up to 4 loops, as in table 2. In the next section we will compute the counterterms required to renormalise these subdivergences. To this end, it is convenient to reduce to a basis of independent operators. In the background-field method a basis for a given fixed value of N is obtained by modifying the corresponding basis obtained without background field, according to the replacements:\n(D.F )a \u2212\u2192 (D.F (Q+B))a, (\u2202iAa) \u2212\u2192 (D\u0304iQ)a, (6.15) (\u2202c\u0304a) \u2212\u2192 (D\u0304c\u0304)a, (\u2202ica) \u2212\u2192 (D\u0304ic)a.

Notably, there is no such counterterm for N = 2, as it can be seen by inspecting O(2)2 in eq. (5.3). ForN = 4, the operatorO (4) 2 , given in eq.

For consistency, we verified that\n\u03b4Z (4) 1 2 extracted from eq. (7.15) agrees with the result in eq. (7.11).

We generated all the Feynman diagrams that contribute to eq. (7.26) with QGRAF [73], we performed the color and Lorentz algebra with inhouse code, which is written in FORM [61] and makes use of the package COLOR [60]. All the Feynman integrals that contribute to eq. (7.26) are massless two-point functions,\n4The mass dimension of the operator increases with the spin, as d = N+2, and therefore also the degree of divergence of the Feynman diagrams of eq. (7.24). This requires to compute high order terms in the Taylor expansion of the diagrams, see eq. (7.8), which can generate large numbers of terms.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nalso called p-integrals [74\u201377], which we computed with the code Forcer [78]. In order to renormalise eq. (7.26), we separate the tree-level from loop contributions\n\u0393(N)i;BB(gB, \u03beB) = { \u0393(N),0i;BB + \u03b4\u0393 (N) i;BB(gB, \u03beB), for i = 1\n\u03b4\u0393(N)i;BB(gB, \u03beB), for i 6= 1. (7.28)\nwhere we omit the dependence on p2, which can be reconstructed via dimensional analysis, and with\n\u03b4\u0393(N)i;BB(gB, \u03beB) = \u221e\u2211 r=1 \u0393(N),ri;BB (\u03beB) ( \u03b1s,B 4\u03c0 )r , (7.29)\nwhere \u03b1s,B = g2B/(4\u03c0). Upon considering \u0393 (N) 1;BB(gB, \u03beB) in eq. (7.26), we find the renormalised correlator to obey\nK [ ZB [ Z (N) 1 1 \u0393 (N) 1;BB(gB, \u03beB) + \u2211 i>1 \u03b4Z (N) 1 i \u03b4\u0393 (N) i;BB(gB, \u03beB) ]] = 0, (7.30)\nwhere ZB = 1Z2g is the renormalisation constant of the background field [52, 53]. Eq. (7.30) can be solved in terms of the renormalisation constant Z(N)1 1 of the gauge invariant operator. Using identities eqs. (7.1) and (7.28), we then get\n\u03b4Z (N) 1 1 \u0393 (N),0 1;BB = \u2212 1 ZB K ZB\u2211 i\u22651 Z (N) 1 i \u03b4\u0393 (N) i;BB(gB, \u03beB)  . (7.31) The equation above holds to all loop orders. The renormalisation constants Z(N)1 i>1, on the right hand-side of eq. (7.31), are required to renormalise sub-divergences of \u0393(N)1;BB, which involve quantum gluons and/or a ghost-antighost pair. Each sub-divergence is proportional to one of the unphysical operators O(N)i>1 . This determines the maximal loop order at which Z\n(N) 1 i has been computed, as shown in table 7. The diagonal renormalisation constant,\n\u03b4Z (N) 1 1 , appears on both sides of eq. (7.31). However, we notice that the Z (N) 1 1 appearing on the right hand-side is multiplied by \u03b4\u0393(N)1;BB(gB, \u03beB), which starts at O(\u03b1s). Therefore, eq. (7.31) allows us to compute Z(N)1 1 at L-loops, given the knowledge of Z (N) 1 i at l < L loops as discussed before. We plug the l-loop values of Z(N)1 i , given in eqs. (7.10)\u2013 (7.12), (7.17), (7.22) and (7.23) respectively, into eq. (7.31). After computing the relevant correlators \u03b4\u0393(N)i;BB(gB, \u03beB) at the required L\u2212 l loop order, we find\nZ (2) 1 1 = 1 +O ( \u03b15s ) , (7.32)\nZ (4) 1 1 = 1 + \u03b1s 4\u03c0 21CA 5 + ( \u03b1s 4\u03c0 )2 C2A ( 28 25 2 + 7121 1000 ) + ( \u03b1s 4\u03c0 )3 C3A ( \u2212 13161125 3\n\u2212 15144145000 2 + 103309639 4050000 ) + ( \u03b1s 4\u03c0 )4 { C4A [ 11186 5625 4 + 1512989 450000 3 \u2212 5437269017 162000000 2\n+1 (1502628149 13500000 + 1146397\u03b63 45000 \u2212 126\u03b65 5 )] + dAA NA (21623 600 + 3899 \u03b63 15 \u2212 1512 \u03b65 5 )} +O(\u03b15s), (7.33)\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\nZ (6) 1 1 = 1 + \u03b1s 4\u03c0 83CA 14 + ( \u03b1s 4\u03c0 )2 C2A ( 7885 1176 2 + 1506899 148176 ) + ( \u03b1s 4\u03c0 )3 C3A ( \u2212 465215148176 3\n+ 24337598918670176 2 + 96390174479 2613824640\n) +O ( \u03b14s ) , (7.34)\nwhere dAA = dabcd4 dabcd4 , with dabcd4 defined in eq. (3.21). As a check on our calculation, we verified that all non-local divergences of the form 1/ p logq(\u00b52/p2), which appear in the bare correlators, cancel upon combining the required counterterms. Furthermore, we verified that the dependence on the gauge parameter \u03be cancels up to three loops in eqs. (7.32) and (7.33). The O(\u03b14s)-terms in those equations were computed only in Feynman gauge. Similarly, the calculation of the O(\u03b13s)-terms in eq. (7.34) was performed in Feynman gauge and the cancellation of \u03be was verified to two loops. The result Z(2)1 1 = 1, in eq. (7.32), agrees with the findings of refs. [79, 80], which imply that O(2)1 does not renormalise to all orders. Finally, by extracting the anomalous dimension \u03b3(N), as written in eq. (7.3), we find agreement with the results at three and at four loops given in refs. [20] and [34]."

            "text": "In this paper we generalised a method, originally by Dixon and Taylor [37], for the construction of unphysical operators which are required for the renormalisation of Green\u2019s functions with insertions of twist-two gluonic operators. As one increases the loop order of the Green\u2019s function more unphysical operators are in general required for its renormalisation. The previously known basis was restricted to two-loop calculations, and it was unclear how to systematically extend it to higher loop order, thereby preventing the OPE method to be used for calculations of the singlet splitting functions. We have uncovered a general and systematic formalism for extending the basis to arbitrary loop order. Using this formalism we then worked out the explicit basis for calculations up to four-loop order and used it to perform calculations of the N = 2, 4 Mellin moments at four loops and the N = 6 Mellin moment at three loops, obtaining the correct known results. The formalism we developed can essentially be broken down to a few key concepts. The first is that we identified the gluonic gauge-variant operators in the Dixon-Taylor basis with EOM operators, these are not EOM operators of the gauge-fixed Lagrangian, but EOM operators of the gauge invariant part of the Lagrangian. With this identification we could easily write down the all-loop structure of the EOM operator. The second concept is that of a generalised gauge transformation which leaves invariant the Lagrangian made up of the gauge invariant and EOM operators. Following the works of Hamberg and Van Neerven [13] and Joglekar and Lee [42] this generalised gauge invariance is promoted to a generalised BRST symmetry. We then propose that the most general ghost operator can be written as the generalised BRST action acting on a single BRST ancestor operator. The ghost operator is therefore identified as an BRST-exact operator in the BRST generalised sense. This proposition not only reproduces the previously known ghost operators required at two loops, but we also confirmed that it complies with the theorems of Joglekar and Lee [42]. Indeed we show that the operators generated with our procedure can be always written as a sum of a BRST-exact term (in the sense of the original, not generalised, BRST\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 7\ntransformations) and a term that vanishes on the equation of motion of the complete YangMills lagrangian, as required by [42].\nWe explored two further symmetry principles to simplify calculations of unphysical counterterms. The first is the anti-BRST symmetry which can be used to derive a ghost anti-ghost exchange symmetry of the ghost operators. This symmetry allows one to drastically reduce the number of independent unphysical operators. Another symmetry principle is background field gauge invariance, which we employed in our calculations. Background field invariance allows to do calculations without unphysical operators at the one-loop level, beyond one-loop counterterms a number of unphysical operators are however still required to perform calculations.\nThe task of computing unphysical counterterms requires the extraction of local renormalisation counterterms of Green\u2019s functions containing a ghost anti-ghost pair and multiple gluons. For instance to determine the anomalous dimension of the gauge invariant operator at the four-loop level generally requires, among others, the counterterms associated to Green\u2019s functions containing a ghost anti-ghost pair with two gluons at two loops and with one gluon at three loops. These quantities can thus not be extracted through a naive calculation of a self energy diagram. In this work we employed a fully automated implementation of the local R\u2217-operation, an operation which allows to extract the counterterms of Greens\u2019s functions of arbitrary many external particles from self energy diagrams, via the technique of IR rearrangement and IR subtractions. However the R\u2217operation becomes very expensive for higher moments, due to the many derivatives and many counterterms one requires. Already at N = 6 we found that the calculations were becoming prohibitively time-consuming even with substantial computing resources. It may be possible with further optimisation to push the R\u2217-approach to higher N , however we believe that a more streamlined approach could be more promising. We leave further improvements of this task to the future.\nAssuming that the problem of calculating these UV counterterms can be solved efficiently one can expect that the methods presented here should allow for a much more efficient approach to computing Mellin moments of gluonic splitting functions at N3LO than the brute force approach which was currently used [34]. To extend the methods presented here to singlet splitting functions containing also quarks will require further extensions of the formalism. We do not believe these to give major complications."
