    "abstractText": "Noncentrosymmetric hybrid framework (HF) materials are an important system in discovering new practical second-order nonlinear optical materials. We calculated the second harmonic generation (SHG) response of a noncentrosymmetric (NCS) organic\u2013inorganic HF compound, CuMoO3(p2c) (p2c = pyrazine-2-carboxylate) to find that it exhibits the largest SHG response among all known NCS HF materials with one-dimensional helical chains. Further atom response theory analysis revealed that the metal atoms Cu and Mo contribute much more strongly than do nonmetal atoms in determining the strength of the SHG response, which is a novel example in nonlinear optical materials known to date.",

            "text": "Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals play a vital role in modern laser technologies and sciences due to their ability to convert the frequency of an incident laser beam through the second harmonic generation (SHG) process [1\u20135]. A noncentrosymmetric (NCS) arrangement of atoms is a prerequisite for the generation of non-zero second-order NLO properties in bulk materials. The search for new NCS structures with excellent SHG properties remains a hot scientific challenge. Although there exist a number of extensively studied and commercially available inorganic NLO crystals, there has been tremendous interest in finding new NLO materials in other systems such as organic molecular crystals, inorganic\u2013organic hybrid nanocomposites, self-assembled chromophoric superlattices and inorganic\u2013organic hybrid framework materials (including both nanoporous metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) and dense inorganic\u2013organic frameworks (IOFs)) [6\u201310]. Hybrid framework materials are constructed by employing modular synthetic procedures with metal ions (i.e., Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Ag+, Cu+) or inorganic nodes (i.e., metal-oxide, metalfluoride, metal-chalcogenides and metal-halides) that are covalently and/or coordinately bonded to various organic linkers. Because of the advantages over conventional inorganic materials (e.g., structural tunability at a molecular level, chemical stability, and ease of synthesis on a large bulk scale), NCS hybrid framework materials are expected to form a new class of potentiality practical NLO materials [11\u201313]. Numerous hybrid framework materials have been reported to be SHG-active. According to the dimensionality of the coordination networks, they can be roughly classified\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 824. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14040824 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 824 2 of 11\ninto three groups: (a) three-dimensional (3D) networks (e.g., diamondoid, octupolar), (b) two-dimensional (2D) grid structures, and (c) one-dimensional (1D) chains (e.g., helical chains). Lin et al. suggested that 3D and 2D networks with a high degree of controllability and predictability are better platforms for the synthesis of NCS MOFs [6,8], and they reported a number of MOFs with a large SHG response, which includes Cd{3-[2(4-pyridyl)ethenyl]benzoate}2 (powder SHG intensity I2\u03c9powder of 800 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, Fdd2) [14] and other systems [15]. For hybrid framework materials, the molecular origin of SHG is believed to arise from the electronic asymmetry (push\u2013pull effect or acceptor\u2013donor effect) induced by the polarization of ligand electron density or the metal-to-ligand/ligand-tometal charge transfer [6,9,10,16]. The alignment of NLO chromophores may be necessary for NCS hybrid framework materials to have a large SHG response. For example, Ye et al. obtained a zinc MOF based on a 2D square grid network, in which the ligands involve an aligned two-center acceptor\u2013donor system, which displays a very strong SHG response (I2\u03c9powder of 50 \u00d7 urea and 500 \u00d7 KH2PO4 (KDP), respectively) [16]. Yu et al. encapsulated a matching ordered organic dipolar chromophore in the pores of porous MOFs forming a highly NLO active anionic MOF (ZJU-28\u2282DPASD, I2\u03c9powder of 18.3 \u00d7 \u03b1SiO2) [17]. However, the NCS hybrid framework materials with 1D helical chains are not known to have large SHG responses, although it may be related to synthetic difficulty and unpredictability. Maggard et al. used short organic ligands to bridge polar or chiral inorganic basic building units (i.e., MoO2F42\u2212) to obtain two isomorphic SHG-active NCS solids with helical chains [18,19], A(pyz)(H2O)2MoO2F4 (A = Zn, Cd, pyz = pyrazine, I2\u03c9powder of ~0.28\u20131 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, P3221). Other examples with 1D helical chains include Cu(pzc)2AgReO4 (pzc = pyrazinecarboxylate, I2\u03c9powder of ~0.5\u20130.7 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, P43212) [20], [Zn(mpz)3]2[MoO2F4]2 (mpz = 3-methylpyrazole, I2\u03c9powder of ~10 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, Pna21) [21], and [(S)-C5H14N2][(MoO3)3(SO4)]\u00b7H2O (I2\u03c9powder of ~5\u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, Pna21) [22]. The cancellation or the absence of a net dipole moment in these structures is usually considered to be responsible for their low SHG response [19]. Finding hybrid framework materials with 1D helical chains possessing a large SHG response remains a challenge. It should be pointed out that the SHG phenomenon, as a second-order polarization, involves both the occupied and the unoccupied states of a material, while the vector sum of the dipole moments of the groups within a unit cell, as a zero-order polarization, associated with only the occupied states. The non-zero vector sum of the dipole moments lead to a polar structure which guarantees the presence of an NCS structure, which is a necessary condition for the occurrence of the SHG phenomenon, but it does not influence the magnitude of the second-order NLO properties. It is desirable to understand the SHG responses for the NCS hybrid framework compounds at the electronic and the atomic levels. Recently, Luo et al. [23] reported a new NCS metal-oxide/organic hybrid compound CuMoO3(p2c) (p2c = pyrazine-2-carboxylate) with 1D helical chains. However, so far neither theoretical nor experimental work on the linear and the nonlinear optical properties of this compound has been reported. Based on our first-principles calculation, we found CuMoO3(p2c) exhibits a very strong SHG response with a static effective SHG value d p e f f calculated to be 30.6 pm/V. This value is about 92.7 times that of KDP (~927 \u00d7 \u03b1-SiO2, 3.12 \u00d7 AgGaS2 (AGS)), which ranks the SHG response of CuMoO3(p2c) to be the highest among all the reported hybrid framework materials with 1D helical chains. Besides, our atom response theory (ART) analysis [24] shows that the SHG response of CuMoO3(p2c) originates largely from the states of the metal ions, Cu+ and Mo6+, i.e., approximately 56% of the total SHG response. Such a large contribution from metal ions also makes CuMoO3(p2c) a quite special example in NLO materials."

            "text": "Computational Details\nVASP calculations. The structural and the electronic properties of CuMoO3(p2c) were calculated within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) [25,26] by using the\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 824 3 of 11\nVienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [27\u201329] with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [30]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the Perdew\u2013 Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE)-type exchange-correlation potentials [31] was used throughout this work. The employed PAW\u2013PBE pseudopotentials [32] with 11 (3d104s1), 14 (4s24p64d55s1), 6 (2s22p4), 5 (2s22p3), 4 (2s22p2) and 1 (1s1) valence electrons for Cu, Mo, O, N, C, and H were used to describe the electron\u2212ion interactions, respectively. The plane wave cutoff energy for the expansion of wave functions was set at 600 eV and the tetrahedron method with Bl\u00f6chl corrections was used for integrations. The numerical integrations in the Brillouin zones were performed by utilizing 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 4 Monkhorst\u2013Pack k-point mesh, which showed an excellent convergence of the energy differences (0.005 eV) and stress tensors (0.001 eV/\u00c5). The quasi-Newton algorithm as implemented in the VASP code was used in all structural relaxations. In this work, both the cell volume and the atomic positions were all allowed to relax to minimize the internal forces. The optimized lattice parameters, a = 7.791 \u00c5 and c = 11.229 \u00c5, are slightly overestimated with respect to the experimental, which were measured at room temperature as usual with the PBE functional. Details of the optimized structure and the agreement with the experimental values are given in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. In our calculations for the linear and the nonlinear optical properties, we employed the sum over states (SOS) method [33\u201335] using the code we developed [24] based on the calculated electronic structures from the VASP optical module. The SOS formalism for second-order susceptibility was derived by Aversa and Sipe [33] and later modified by Rashkeev et al. [34,36] and Sharma et al. [35,37]. To gain insight into the origin of SHG response, the contributions A\u03c4 of the individual atoms \u03c4 to a specific component, e.g., the largest, of the total SHG response tensor, were determined by performing atom response theory (ART) analysis [24,38] for the CuMoO3(p2c) structure. Note that, the chirality may lead to higher-order interactions beyond the electric dipole approximation, for which one needs to use model studies instead of the first-principles method [39]. Partial response functional (PRF) method. The contribution of a certain occupied energy region between EB and valence band maximum (VBM), \u03b6V(EB), to each SHG coefficient dil = 12 \u03c7 (2) ijk , l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is determined by considering only those excitations from all occupied states between EB and VBM to all the unoccupied states of the conduction bands (CBs) and the contribution, \u03b4\u03b6V(EB), of specific occupied states of energy EB to each dil by the excitations from that energy to all unoccupied states of the CBs.\n\u03b4\u03b6V(EB) = \u2212 d\u03b6V(EB)\ndEB (1)\nSimilarly, the contribution, \u03b6C(EB), of a certain unoccupied region between the conduction band minimum (CBM) and EB to each dil is determined by the excitations from all occupied states of the VBs only to all unoccupied states between CBM and EB, and the contribution, \u03b4\u03b6C(EB), of specific unoccupied states of energy EB to each dil by the excitations from all occupied states of the VBs only to that energy.\n\u03b4\u03b6C(EB) = d\u03b6C(EB)\ndEB (2)\nAtom response theory (ART) analysis. To evaluate the individual atom contributions to the SHG components, dil , it is computationally more convenient to express the corresponding PRFs in terms of the band index IB, \u03b6(IB), where the band index IB runs from 1 to Ntot (i.e., the total number of band orbitals) with increasing energy, EB, from Emin to Emax.

            "text": "The Cu/Mo-oxide CuMoO3(p2c) crystallizes in the NCS space group P32 (Figure 1 and Table S1). Within each unit cell, Cu and Mo atoms each have one crystallographically unique site, whereas the O, N, C, and H atoms occupy five, two, five and three independent crystallographic positions, respectively. All atoms are at special Wyckoff positions of 3a. The Mo atoms are coordinated with five O atoms (O1, O3, O4, O4, O5) and one N1 atom, forming a distorted MoO5N octahedron with Mo-O and Mo-N bond lengths around 1.92 and 2.37 \u00c5, respectively. Neighbouring Mo-centered octahedra are connected by sharing the O4 atom with alternating short (1.82 \u00c5) and long (2.12 \u00c5) Mo-O4 bond distances as well as alternating small (\u2220Mo-O4-Mo = 145.64\u25e6) and large (\u2220O4-Mo-O4 = 162.57\u25e6) bond angles forming 1D zigzag -Mo-O-Mo-O- chains along the c-axis (Figure 1a). Besides, this zigzag chain propagates along the 32 screw axis, that is, the MoO5N octahedron could duplicate itself by rotating 120\u25e6 within the ab plane and gliding 2c/3 along the c axis. In addition, the Cu atoms form a distorted CuO3N tetrahedron with the surrounding three O atoms (O2, O3, O5) and one N2 atom with the Cu-O and Cu-N distances of ~2.03 \u00c5 and ~1.99 \u00c5, respectively. Each CuO3N tetrahedra is corner shared with two neighbouring MoO5N octahedra through the O3 and O5 atoms, forming the inorganic CuMoO3 helical chains. Further, the N1 and O1 atoms from one p2c ligand simultaneously coordinate with the Mo atom, while the O2 and N2 atoms from two different p2c ligands connect the Cu atoms (Figure 1b). Thus, the 3D inorganic\u2013organic hybrid network is constructed through the bridging p2c ligands. Note that, the Mo-O1 and the Cu-O2 distances (2.16 and 2.08 \u00c5) connecting to the p2c ligands are slightly longer than the other Mo-O and Cu-O bonding lengths (1.86 and 2.01 \u00c5) within each MoO5N octahedra and CuO3N tetrahedra, respectively.

We also calculated the SHG responses for several NCS hybrid framework compounds with helical chains, as presented in Table S2, which also lists the available experimental SHG values. Clearly, CuMoO3(p2c) has the highest d p e f f value among all reported NCS hybrid framework materials with helical chains. This remarkably strong SHG response is larger than those found in the majority of hybrid framework materials reported to date. Only a few are exceptional: [Cd(L-N3)2(H2O)2]n (I2\u03c9powder of 80 \u00d7 urea) [49], Zn((E)-4pyv-3-bza)2 (I2\u03c9powder of 1000 \u00d7\u03b1-SiO2) [50], and [(CN4-C6H4-C12H7N-C5H4N)2Zn]\u00b71.5H2O (I2\u03c9powder of 50 \u00d7 urea) [16]. Besides, the SHG response of CuMoO3(p2c) is even larger than several newly reported inorganic IR-NLO crystals, e.g., Li[LiCs2Cl] [Ga3S6] (I2\u03c9powder of 0.7 \u00d7 AGS) [51], Ba2SnS5 (I2\u03c9powder of 1.1 \u00d7 AGS) [52], Na2MSn2Se6 (M = Zn/Cd) ((I 2\u03c9 powder of 3 and 2.2 \u00d7 AGS) [53], and \u03b4-Ga2Se3 (I2\u03c9powder of 2.3 \u00d7 AGS) [54].

            "text": "We investigate the origin of the SHG responses further by employing the ART analysis [24]. Shown in Figure 2c is the partial response functionals (PRFs), \u03b6V(EB) and \u03b6C(EB) as well as their derivatives (Figures S6 and S7), \u03b4\u03b6V(EB) and \u03b4\u03b6C(EB), for CuMoO3(p2c). The \u03b6V(EB) functional increases in magnitude with decreasing EB from EF to\u22124.4 eV indicating that the nonbonding Cu 3d and O 2p states are the dominating contributors to the SHG response in the VB part. From the rising amplitude of the \u03b6V(EB) functional, it is clear that the contribution from the Cu 3d states (EF to \u22121.0 eV) is greater than that from the O 2p states (\u22121.8 to \u22124.4 eV). This is so because the completely filled d orbitals of each Cu+ (d10) possess more electrons than the completely filled 2p orbitals of each O2\u2212 (p6). However, in the energy range of \u22124.4 to \u22129.0 eV where the C-O/N, Mo-O/N and Cu-O/N bonding interaction occurs, the functional shows small variation, showing that these bonding states contribute little to the SHG response. A dramatical change from the CB minimum to 7 eV and the steady increase at the higher energy range of the \u03b6C(EB) functional reveal the contribution from the unoccupied Mo-4d and C/O/N-2p states in the CB part. The quantitative contribution of an individual atom \u03c4, A\u03c4 (in %), to the strongest SHG coefficient d11 for CuMoO3(p2c) is obtained based on the PRFs. As presented in Tables 1 and S3, the A\u03c4 of Cu (~11.7%) is nearly 1.7 times that of Mo (~7.0%) and 7.3 times that of O (~1.6%) and N (~1.2%). Besides, the A\u03c4 value of C and H are negligibly small, <0.8%. These results reflect that the metal atoms Cu and Mo serve as the NLO-active centers at the atomic scale. Considering the number of atoms of each element in the unit cell, the total contributions of Cu, Mo, O, N, C, and H are 35.2, 20.9, 24.1, 7.4, 11.1, and 1.4%. Although the uneven stoichiometry effect is included, the metal atom Cu is still the leading contributor to the SHG response, while the contributions from the Mo and O atoms are comparable. This further reflects the important contribution from the metal atoms since the number of O in a unit cell is five times that of Cu and Mo. The relative atom contributions decrease in the order Cu >> Mo > O > N > C> H in the VB contributions (Table S3), and in the order Mo >> Cu > N > C > O> H in the CB contributions (Table S3). These findings show that the SHG of CuMoO3(p2c) is governed largely by the occupied states of Cu 3d, Mo 4p, and O 2p, and by the unoccupied states of Mo 4d, Cu 3d, and N-2p. The metal atoms Cu and Mo contribute much more strongly than do the nonmetal atoms in determining the strength of the SHG response in CuMoO3(p2c), which is quite special among the NLO materials known to date.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 824 8 of 11\nAccording to the individual atomic contribution to the SHG response, the contribution of an atomic group can be calculated by summing the contributions of the center atom and those of its ligands. In this work, we partition the contribution of an anion (O2\u2212 and N3\u2212) equally to all the atomic groups it belongs to. The contribution of an atomic group can be calculated by summing the contributions of the center atom and those of its coordinated atoms [55]. Considering the coordination number for each O and N atom (2 and 3, respectively, Figure S8), the group CuO3N can be rewritten as CuO21/2O31/2O51/2N21/3. Therefore, the group contribution of CuO3N to SHG response is calculated as follows,\n\u03c7 (2) [CuO3N] = \u03c7 (2) Cu + 1\u00d7\n( \u03c7 (2) O2 / 2 ) + 1\u00d7 ( \u03c7 (2) O3 / 2 ) + 1\u00d7 ( \u03c7 (2) O5 / 2 ) + 1\u00d7 ( \u03c7 (2) N2 / 3 ) (6)\nThe group with anion coordination numbers and the total group contributions for the largest SHG component d11 of CuMoO3(p2c) are given in Figure 4, which shows that the metal-centered group [CuO3N] and [MoO5N] contribute much more strongly to the SHG response than does the organic p2c ligand. That is, the total contribution of the inorganic part is ~79.1%, which far surpasses that of the organic part (i.e., ~20.9%). Our results reflect that the inorganic part contributes dominantly to the SHG response, while the organic part is important in the stabilization of the crystal structure of CuMoO3(p2c). It is worth mentioning that we did not separately calculate the hyperpolarizability tensor \u03b2ijk by cutting out the ligand or groups from the structure of the compound. Such an approach will unavoidably lead to uncontrolled errors; thus, they are not used in our calculations.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 11\nTable 1.

In this work, we partition the contribution of an anion (O2\u2212 and\nN3\u2212) equally to all the atomic groups it belongs to. The contribution of an atomic group\ncan be calculated by summing the contributions of the center atom and those of its coor-\ndinated atoms[55]. Considering the coordination number for each O and N atom (2 and 3,\nrespectively, Figure S8), the group CuO3N can be rewritten as CuO21/2O31/2O51/2N21/3.\nTherefore, the group contribution of CuO3N to SHG response is calculated as follows,\n\ud835\udf12[CuO3N] (2) = \ud835\udf12Cu (2)\n+ 1 \u00d7 ( \ud835\udf12O2\n(2)\n2 \u2044 ) + 1 \u00d7 (\n\ud835\udf12O3 (2)\n2 \u2044 ) + 1 \u00d7 (\n\ud835\udf12O5 (2)\n2 \u2044 ) + 1 \u00d7 (\n\ud835\udf12N2 (2)\n3 \u2044 ) (6)\nThe group with anion coordination numbers and the total group contributions for\nthe largest SHG component d11 of CuMoO3(p2c) are given in Figure 4, which shows that\nthe metal-centered group [CuO3N] and [MoO5N] contribute much more strongly to the\nSHG response than does the organic p2c ligand. That is, the total contribution of the inor-\nganic part is ~79.1%, which far surpasses that of the organic part (i.e., ~20.9%). Our results\nreflect that t e inorganic part contributes dominantly to the response, while the or-\nganic part is important in the ilization of the crystal s ructure of CuMoO3(p2c). It is\nworth e ti ing that we id not separately calculate the hyperpolarizability tensor \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58 by cutting out the ligand or groups from the structure of the compound. Such an approach\nwill unavoidably lead to uncontrolled errors; thus, they are not used in our calculations.\nFigure 4. The cause for the large second harmonic generation (SHG) of the metal-oxide/organic hybrid co pound CuMoO3(p2c) is shown to be the inorganic metal-cation-centered groups [CuO3N] and [MoO5N] rather than the organic nonmetal-cation-centered groups [C5O2N2H3].\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 824 9 of 11"

            "text": "Although a number of NCS HF materials with 3D and 2D frameworks have been reported with large SHG response, only low SHG intensities have been measured for HF materials with 1D helical chains. Our first-principles calculations predict that the recently synthesized CuMoO3(p2c) exhibits the largest SHG response among all the NCS HF materials with 1D helical chains. Its static effective SHG response, 30.6 pm/V, is about 3.12 times greater than that of commercial AGS, and 92.7 times greater than that of KDP. This value also exceeds those of most NCS hybrid framework materials reported so far. Our ART analysis shows that the SHG of CuMoO3(p2c) is determined largely by the occupied states composed of Cu 3d, Mo 4p, and O 2p, and by the unoccupied states composed of Mo 4d, Cu 3d, and N 2p. The metal atoms Cu and Mo contribute much more strongly than do the nonmetal atoms in determining the strength of the SHG response in CuMoO3(p2c). The latter is quite special in the NLO materials known to date. Our work based on the quantitative calculations at the electronic and the atomic level reveals the importance of the contribution from metal atoms and the metal-centered inorganic groups for the SHG response of CuMoO3(p2c).\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/sym14040824/s1, Figure S1: Calculated band structure for P32-CuMoO3(p2c).
