    "abstractText": "Selection of proper stocks, before allocating investment ratios, is always a crucial task for the investors. Presence of many influencing factors in stock performance have motivated researchers to adopt various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to make this challenging task easier. In this paper a novel fuzzy expert system model is proposed to evaluate and rank the stocks under Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory is used for the first time to automatically generate the consequents of the fuzzy rule base to reduce the effort in knowledge base development of the expert system. Later a portfolio optimization model is constructed where the objective function is considered as the ratio of the difference of fuzzy portfolio return and the risk free return to the weighted mean semi-variance of the assets that has been used. The model is solved by applying Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm by giving preference to the top ranked stocks. The performance of the model proved to be satisfactory for short-term investment period when compared with the recent performance of the stocks.",

There are different types of factors which directly or indirectly influence the performance of stocks. This has made the task of stock selection and portfolio construction very challenging and uncertain for the stock market researchers\nEmail addresses: cse.gsmt@gmail.com (Gour Sundar Mitra Thakur), mathsrup@gmail.com (Rupak Bhattacharyya), seemasarkarmondal@yahoo.co.in (Seema Sarkar (Mondal))\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n13 38\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n4 M\nsince the very beginning. According to [1] portfolio selection may include two stages: firstly, performances of different securities is observed with beliefs about their future performances and secondly, a proper choice of portfolio is made with relevant beliefs about future performances. The main aim in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) of investment is to maximize the expected return of the portfolio for a given amount of portfolio risk or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets. In a ground-breaking work [1], Markowitz has quantified return as the mean and risk as the variance of the portfolio of securities. The relationship between risk and mean-variance are later examined in various researches like [2, 3, 4, 5]. The twin objectives of investors\u2019, profit maximization and risk minimization, are thus quantified. Though this theory has been widely accepted and adopted, it is being criticized since last few years. The main reason behind this is in MPT the efficiency of market is considered to be the basic assumption and obtaining information about markets in frequent intervals is costly and time consuming [6]. Computational burden caused by the quadratic utility functions and covariance matrix when number of stock increases, is another major concern in MPT. Another limitation of MPT is, it does not give importance to real investors\u2019 preferences [7]. In practice, it is also found that investors prefer portfolios that lie behind the efficient frontier of Markowitz model even though they are dominated by other portfolios with respect to return and risk. From the above discussion it is obvious that some additional criteria should be added to the classical risk-return framework.\nThus portfolio selection problem is proved to be a multi-dimensional problem and to solve this inherent multi-criteria nature of this problem Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach has been adopted in various researches like [8, 9, 10, 11]. In spite of all these efforts researchers were facing difficulties in bringing efficiency in portfolios specially in dynamic uncertain environment. As a result the use of different AI techniques in stock selection and portfolio construction became inevitable due to their well known capability of handling uncertain and vague data. In literature we can find wide use of different AI and Soft Computing techniques to analyse and predict the performance of stocks in various stock exchanges around the world. In some researches [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] efficient learning capability of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is adopted to select stocks and construct portfolios whereas in some other researches [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] optimization capability of Genetic Algorithm is used for portfolio optimization. But the application of Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Set theory has become the most popular among other soft computing techniques, due to its uncertainty handling capability and the efficiency to incorporate vagueness in investors\u2019 preferences in portfolio construction [22, 23, 24, 25, 26].\nPortfolio selection process can be divided into two stages [7]. In the first stage, some stocks are selected to construct the portfolio and in the second stage, the percentage of the total value for each stock is identified. Use of fuzzy expert systems in the selection of stocks and equity have recently become very effective and popular. In a work Fasanghari et al. [24] developed an fuzzy expert system to select superior stocks in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE)\nby identifying 7 factors influencing the stock market. A rule base of total 932 rules was constructed for this purpose. Though no proper portfolio optimization model was used in this work, the outcome of the model proved to be satisfactory. But the major concern of this model can be the development time and cost due to repetitive expert interactions for the development of the model. Authors have used only fuzzy set theory to deal with the inherent uncertainty present in the rule base though fuzzy set theory is more effective in dealing with vagueness in the model than addressing inherent uncertainty of the model [27]. In another significant work Xidonas et al.[7] developed an expert system for the selection of equity securities but the concerns remained more or less same as the previous one.\nIn this proposed work selection of stocks are made with the help of an expert system where the fuzzy rule base is automatically generated by applying DS evidence theory. This has considerably minimized the development time and cost as no cost is incurred here in terms of experts\u2019 consultations for the construction of the rule base. DS evidence theory is well known for its capability of dealing with incomplete and uncertain information. So another level of uncertainty handling mechanism beside fuzzy set theory is incorporated in the model. Though there are many factors which function as evidences of stock performance, here four most popular performance indicators: Price to Earning Ratio (P/E), Price to Book Value (P/B), Price to Sales ratio (P/S) and Long Term Debt to Equity ratio (LTDER) are initially identified and their historical data for all the registered stocks under BSE, are collected during the period of FY 2003-04 to FY 2011-12. In the first phase of the design, these four factors has functioned as input variables of a fuzzy inference system in the proposed model and their historical data have been used to generate the consequents of the fuzzy rules with the help of DS evidence theory. The model is tested with the historical data of FY 2012-13, when values of these four factors for each stocks are provided as input to the fuzzy inference system and then they are ranked based on their defuzzified output. In the second phase, a portfolio optimization model is constructed and then it is solved with ACO by considering top 10 stocks, as per the previous ranking, in the portfolio, to allocate investment ratios by giving preferences to the top ranked stocks. As mentioned earlier the model is tested with the data of FY 2012-13 to predict the performance of different stocks in FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15, the performance of the model is proved to be satisfactory when compared with their actual performance. Figure 1 depicts the brief structure of the article.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives brief description about the four identified factors and their importance in stock performance. In Section 3 design of the proposed fuzzy expert system model is elaborated. Portfolio construction using top 10 stocks is discussed in Section 4. Result analysis and comparison with recent performance of stocks is done in Section 5 and finally Section 6 concludes the discussion.\n2.\nThere are many technical and fundamental factors which influence the stock market directly or indirectly. In this work four fundamental factors Price to Earning Ration (P/E), Price to Book Value (P/B), Price to Sales ratio (P/S) and Long Term Debt to Equity ratio (LTDER) are identified and their brief definitions are given below:"

            "text": "A. P. Dempster in 1967 [28] proposed a multi-valued mapping from one space to another which was used for statistical inference when we needed to identify a single hypothesis from multiple sample information. The DS-theory was first proposed by Dempster in 1968 [29] and later in 1976 it was extended by Shafer [30] to deal with incomplete and uncertain information.\nDS-Theory mainly deals with four components: Frame of discernment, Basic Probability Assignment (BPA), plausibility function Pl and belief function Bel.\nIn evidence theory first a set of hypothesises \u0398 called frame of discernment, is assumed and defined as follows:\n\u0398 = {H1, H2, H3, ...,HN}. (5)\nThe set is composed of N mutually exhaustive and exclusive hypothesises. From the \u0398, let us denote P (\u0398), be the power set composed with 2N propositions Xof \u0398:\nP (\u0398) = {\u2205, {H1}, {H2}, ..., {HN}, {H1 \u222aH2}, {H1 \u222aH3}, ...,\u0398} (6)\nwhere \u2205 denotes the empty set. The most important task in applying evidence theory is Basic Probability Assignment (BPA). A BPA is a function from P (\u0398) to [0, 1] defined by:\nm : P (\u0398)\u2192 [0, 1] X 7\u2192 m(A)\n(7)\nand which satisfies the following criteria:\u2211 X\u2208P (\u0398) m(X) = 1;\nm(\u2205) = 1. (8)\nDempster\u2019s rule of combination is denoted by m = m1 \u2295 m2, which can combine two BPAs m1 and m2 to yield a new BPA:\nm(A) =\n\u2211 Y \u2229Z=X m1(Y )m2(Z)\n1\u2212 k (9)\nwith k = \u2211 Y \u2229Z=\u2205 m1(Y )m2(Z) (10)\nwhere k is a normalization constant, known as conflict because it measures the degree of conflict between m1 and m2. k = 0 corresponds to the absence of conflict between m1 and m2, whereas k = 1 implies total contradiction between them. The resulting belief function from the combination of I information sources can be defined as:\nm = m1 \u2295m2 \u2295m3...\u2295mI (11)\nWith the help of Equation (11) multi source information can be fused into a single framework in belief theory very easily and it proved to be very effective when it is applied in fuzzy rule generation discussed later in Section 3.3.3."

So the use of Expert Systems (ES) became popular because it is capable of representing and reasoning knowledge rich domain with a view to solve problems and giving advice [31]. The main advantage of ES over any other conventional software applications is its effective reasoning capability as they process knowledge instead of data or information [32]. On the other hand the application of fuzzy set theory in uncertainty handling has become one of the strongest tool to design any framework. As fuzzy set theory is now widely applied in information gathering, modelling, analysis, optimization, control, decision-making and supervision [33], fuzzy expert system is used in the construction of the proposed model.\nFuzzy expert system is an expert system that uses fuzzy logic instead of Boolean logics in its knowledge base and derives conclusion from user inputs and fuzzy inference process [34].

            "text": "The most significant novelty of this research work is the application of DS evidence theory in fuzzy rule construction. The knowledge base of any fuzzy inference system is developed using collection of fuzzy rules which determines how the output will be generated based on the given input. The proposed system has four input parameters namely, P/E, P/B, P/S and LTDER, and based on these input parameter the DS-Fuzzy system is expected to determine whether the selection of any stock will be Highly Favourable, Moderately Favourable or Not Favourable, as output. The frame of discernment is considered as \u0398 = {High Performance, Average Performance, and Poor Performance}.\nRisk/Return ratio is one of the most commonly used measure to evaluate the performance of stocks. Risk is generally measured by semi-variance(S) of the stocks\u2019 previous returns and Return(R) is actually the mathematical mean of previous returns. Obviously lower value of this ratio indicate better performance of stocks. Based on linguistic values of each input factors and comparing those with S/R values as a measure of the performance of various stocks BPAs for different hypothesises are achieved. The historical data of FY 2012-13 are used to identify the stocks. Consulting various domain experts and analysing historical data initially standard values for each factors for all the stocks are decided. By analysing last 9 years\u2019 historical data it is found that when P/E ratio was around its standard value then 75% of stocks under BSE performed better and S/R value was also found to be satisfactory. So a belief of 0.75 is assigned towards the hypothesis {High Performance} when the P/E ratio is near\nto its standard value. Again, when P/E value found to be much lower than its standard value, 65% of total stocks under BSE performed average and S/R value also found to be average. So 0.6 degree of belief is assigned towards the hypothesis {Average Performance} when P/E ratio is lower than its standard value. Similarly, when the value of P/E ratio was much higher than the standard value then it was found that 70% of stocks under BSE performed poor and S/R value was also very high. So 0.7 degree of belief is assigned towards the hypothesis {Poor Performance}. In the same way initial believes or Basic Probabilities are assigned for all other factors as mentioned in Table 3.\nNow to elaborate further let us consider the following four sample rules with their initial belief:\nRule 1. IF P/E is Low THEN Performance will be Average (m1 (A P ) = 0.6).\nRule 2. IF P/B is Standard THEN Performance will be Average (m2 (A P ) = 0.6).\nRule 3. IF P/S is High THEN Performance will be High (m4 (H P ) = 0.75).\nRule 4. IF LTDER is High THEN Performance will be Poor (m6 (P P ) = 0.65).\nThe above four rules represent the belief towards the performance of stocks with respect to the values of four input factors as the presence of evidences. Now consider the IF part of Rule 1 and Rule 2 as the first two evidences and m1 and m2 as mass functions for them respectively.\nNow from Rule 1, m1(A P ) = 0.6 and m1(\u0398) = (1 \u2212 0.6) = 0.4, where, m1(\u0398) represents the degree of belief in the rest of the hypotheses present in the hypothesis set. Similarly, from Rule 2, m2(A P ) = 0.6 and m2(\u0398) = (1\u2212 0.6) = 0.4. Now these two mass functions are combined using Dempster\u2019s rule of combination (Equation 9) to obtain a new function m3 as mentioned in Table\nThe new mass value m3 for the same hypothesis set is calculated as:\nm3(A P ) = 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.24 = 0.84\nm3(\u0398) = 0.16  (12) Now consider the IF part of the Rule 3 as the new evidence and m4 be the new mass function. From Rule 3, m4(H P ) = 0.75 and m4(\u0398) = (1 \u2212 0.75) = 0.25. Now again, m3 and m4 are combined to generate new mass m5 as mentioned in Table 5.\nTable 5: Combination of mass considering first three evidences\nCombining m3 and m4 m4(H P ) = 0.75 m4(\u0398) = 0.25\nm3(A P ) = 0.84 \u03a6 = 0.63 A P = 0.21\nm3(\u0398) = 0.16 H P = 0.12 \u0398 = 0.04\nNew mass values m5 for the hypothesis set are calculated as below:\nm5(A P ) = 0.21\n1\u22120.63 = 0.567\nm5(H P ) = 0.12\n1\u22120.63 = 0.324\nm5(\u0398) = 0.04\n1\u22120.63 = 0.108  (13) Now if we consider the IF part of the Rule 4 as the last evidence and m6 as its mass function then we get m6(H P ) = 0.6 and m6(\u0398) = (1\u2212 0.6) = 0.4. Now finally, m5 and m6 are combined as mentioned in Table 6 to generate the final mass values mf for the hypothesis set (Equation 14).\nFollowing the same procedure final mass values for the rest 80 rules are calculated. For the hypothesis High Performance(H P) maximum and minimum mass values (mf ) are found to be 0.9916 and 0 respectively. As mass values for any hypothesis can lie between 0 and 1 we have divided the favourability of any stock, based on the mf (H P ) of the rules, into three categories: Highly Favourable (0.76 \u2264 mf (H P ) \u2264 1), Moderately Favourable (0.46 \u2264 mf (H P ) \u2264 0.75) and Not Favourable (mf (H P ) \u2264 0.45).\nSo the combined version of the four sample rules mentioned earlier is formed as:\n\u201cIF P/E is Low AND P/B is Standard AND P/S is High AND LTDER is High THEN the stock is Not Favourable\u201d.\nIn this way total 81 fuzzy rules are formulated using DS evidence theory to develop the knowledge base of the proposed DS-fuzzy inference system and the above mentioned three selection categories are converted into fuzzy linguistic variables with trapezoidal membership values as shown in Table 7 for output of the proposed inference system.\nFigure 3 shows the snapshot of the fuzzy rule base and Figure 4 shows the sensitive analysis for the same when designed in MATLAB."

            "text": "To justify the applicability of the proposed model its performance is analyzed further in three aspects. First, top 15 companies are ranked based of their S/R values for the year of 2013-14 and 2014-15. Details of these rankings along with the ranking of the proposed model is given in Table 11.\nFrom the above table we can find a match of 9 companies for FY 2013-14 and a match of 11 companies for FY 2014-15. As S/R values are effective performance indicator of stocks, it can be concluded that the proposed model will give better\nreturn in short-term investment period. In the second stage by considering top 10 stocks under BSE, based on their S/R values for FY 2012-13, a portfolio is constructed using the same ACO algorithm and the objective function (Eq. 19). The optimum return is found to be 0.0740, which is much less than the expected return (0.1317) of the proposed model.\nIn the third stage another portfolio is constructed using the same ACO algorithm, where all 30 registered companies were under BSE are considered. But the optimum return found to be 0.0624 which is much lower than the return calculated by the proposed model. This again proves that the proposed model is more effective in portfolio construction. Figure 7 compares the returns of these three portfolios."

            "text": "In this research a novel fuzzy expert system model is designed and implemented to evaluate and rank the stocks under BSE. DS-evidence theory is used for the development of the fuzzy rule base to reduce the overall implementation time and cost of the system. A portfolio optimization model is constructed by considering the ratio of the difference of fuzzy portfolio return and risk free return to the weighted mean semi-variance of the assets as the objective function. ACO is used to obtain the optimum value of this portfolio.\nAs the outcome of this model found to be satisfactory, this can be implemented for any stock exchanges around the world but the selection of critical factors may vary over different stock exchanges. This fuzzy expert system model can be used to rank any set of alternatives based on the factors influencing them. The portfolio optimization model and the related ACO algorithm can be used to optimize any rank-preference based portfolios."
