 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on mitigating bias in neural text classification:

1. Explore using WFC for other NLP tasks beyond text classification, such as named entity recognition, question answering, etc. The approach could potentially improve fairness for other tasks.

2. Investigate how to further improve the accuracy-fairness trade-off. The paper showed competitive but not state-of-the-art results on some datasets. More work could be done to push the Pareto frontier.

3. Try different techniques for training the demonic model when sensitive attributes are unavailable. The paper demonstrated transfer learning, but other approaches like adversarial training could be explored.

4. Evaluate the approach on more diverse and real-world datasets. The paper used two existing benchmark datasets. Testing on datasets with more nuance would better validate the method.

5. Study the social impacts and ethics of using algorithms to determine fairness. While technical solutions are important, a holistic view encompassing law, ethics, and society is needed. Further interdisciplinary collaboration would be beneficial.
