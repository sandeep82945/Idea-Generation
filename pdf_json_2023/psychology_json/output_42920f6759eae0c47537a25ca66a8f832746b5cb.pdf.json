However, most of the ionic liquids analyzed so far exhibit longer ignition delay times. The inclusion of fuel additives may serve as an alternative solution to reduce these delays to an acceptable range for in-space applications.5 Dicyanamide anions have demonstrated advantageous hypergolic behavior due to their low toxicity, low viscosity, and high thermal stability.7 Furthermore, imidazolium-based cations contribute to reducing the ignition delay time while offering additional performance benets and physicochemical properties, making them suitable for environmentally friendly rocket propellants.7,8,10 Thomas et al. demonstrated that the addition of sodium dicyanamide to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide reduced the ignition delay when used with WFNA as an oxidizer.11 The ignition delay time depended on the additives' concentration, with\nhonnam National University, Gwangju .kr tion (ESI) available. See DOI:\n8963\na reduction of 11 ms observed when the sodium dicyanamide content was increased to 7 wt%.\nExtensive research has been conducted to enhance the ignition behavior of DCA-based ionic liquids by exploring various unique additives, including graphene, graphene oxide, and boron particulates.8,9 The ideal hypergolic additives should exhibit ignition properties similar to hydrazine and possess stability comparable to that of DCA ionic liquids. However, achieving both of these characteristics simultaneously is relatively challenging. Considering the signicant potential for combining different hypergolic structures, there is a need for an efficient and systematic approach to designing highperformance hypergolic additives.\nThe ionic liquids, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide [EMIM][C2N3] and 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dicyanamide [DMIM][C2N3], had the ignition delay time of 52 ms and 35 ms, respectively. However, further purication could reduce the ignition delay time, which is a critical factor in propulsion system design.\nHere we report the effect of additives containing multiple nitrogens on the ignition delay time of energetic ionic liquids, [EMIM][C2N3] and [DMIM][C2N3], as shown in Scheme 1. The potential co-additives, such as diamines (including piperazine, ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1- methylpiperazine, 2-methylpiperazine, 1-ethylpiperazine, 1- butylpiperazine, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, 1-allylpiperazine, 1- amino-4-methylpiperazine [AMPZ], etc.), were examined by measuring the ignition delay time through drop test, as listed in\nScheme 1 Structure of energetic ionic liquids and co-additive with the measured ignition delay.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Additionally, the vapor pressure of the corresponding compounds was compared.\nThe vapor pressure of the ionic liquids and AMPZ have been measured using the simple volumetric vacuum instrumentation similar to that reported earlier.6 In brief, the liquid sample was placed in the bottle connected to the vacuum line and evacuated till 10\u22124 torr using the freeze\u2013thaw cycle to remove the dissolved impurities such as carbon dioxide. Subsequently, the pressure increased, and vapor pressure was measured directly at 298 K aer the thermal equilibrium. For [DMIM][C2N3] and [EMIM][C2N3], the obtained pressure was consistent with the reported, below 1 torr.12 Also, the vapor pressure of 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 torr was obtained for AMPZ, which was comparable to that of ionic liquid.\nAMPZ has an ignition delay time of 11 ms, which was measured through a drop test using WFNA under ambient conditions, where a single drop of AMPZ was added to the WFNA solution.10,13 Such a short ignition delay can be attributed to the presence of an N\u2013N bond, like hydrazine, thereby improving the performance of the ignition delay when it is combined with the energetic ionic liquid. Thus, the combination of the results of the ignition delay time and the vapor measurement for the compound suggests that 1-amino4-methylpiperazine is suitable for improving the hypergolic performance as a bipropellant.\n[DMIM][C2N3] and [EMIM][C2N3], were each combined with AMPZ in weight percentages of 10, 20, 30, and 40 to measure the ignition delay and vapor pressure. Ignition delay time was measured in triplicate using the same method as above for AMPZ, with the ignition delay monitored using a camera with 1000 fps, allowing for 1 ms resolution in the measurement.\nIn Fig. 1, snapshots of the ignition delay for [DMIM][C2N3] and mixtures containing 20 wt% and 40 wt% AMPZ upon the contact with WFNA are presented. The ignition delay time is determined as the time interval between the initial contact of a drop with the oxidizer and the initial ash in the gas phase.10,11,13\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the ignition delay time of [DMIM][C2N3] was 35 ms, which is shorter than the 43 ms reported earlier for\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nother ionic liquids such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide.11 Indeed, the ignition delay time can vary depending on the functional group at the imidazole ring. The ignition delay of [EMIM][C2N3] was found to be 52 ms, signicantly shorter than that reported earlier,10 because solvent-free synthesis conditions were utilized to achieve a high yield above 95% for [EMIM]+ precursor before the ion exchange of [C2N3], resulting in the minimization of residual solvent. The [EMIM][C2N3] showed a similar hypergolic reaction to that of [DMIM][C2N3] as shown in Fig. 1.\nWith an increase in AMPZ content to 40 wt% in the mixture, the hypergolic reaction of the energetic ionic liquid exhibited a decrease in ignition delay time to 20 ms (Fig. 2). The vapor pressure of the mixture was also measured triplicate and remained unchanged despite the increase in AMPZ content. Although the vapor pressure of the mixture containing AMPZ should show an increase linearly with the increase of AMPZ content, the results indicated no signicant change in the vapor pressure, which suggests that AMPZ was compatible with the energetic ionic liquid. Additionally, there was no observed phase separation in the mixture even aer several weeks of aging.\nFurther, to support the miscibility or the stability of the energetic ionic liquid and AMPZ, the DFT calculation employing CP2K package with GTH-TZV2P basis set and PBE potential was performed on 1 : 1 complex of each ionic liquid pair and AMPZ, respectively.14 In the calculation, the total energy of the complex, ionic liquid, and AMPZ, respectively were calculated and subsequently, the stabilization energy for the aggregate was estimated following the equation below\nDEstabilization = ET,aggregate \u2212 ET,IL \u2212 ET,AMPZ\nIn the equation above, DEstabilization, ET,aggregate, ET,IL, and ET,AMPZ represent the stabilization energy, total energy for the aggregate, ionic liquid, and AMPZ, respectively aer geometry\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 18960\u201318963 | 18961\nFig. 2 The ignition delay time and vapor pressure of the mixture containing [DMIM][C2N3] and [EMIM][C2N3] with varying amounts of AMPZ are plotted as black and red symbols, respectively, in relation to the concentration of AMPZ in the mixture. The dotted line serves as a guide for the changes in vapor pressure.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The stabilization energy was found to be 0.27 eV and 0.42 eV for the complex of [DMIM][C2N3] or [EMIM][C2N3] and AMPZ, respectively. The obtained stabilization energy was comparable to that of a hydrogen bond. The optimized geometric structures for [DMIM][C2N3]\u2013AMPZ and [EMIM] [C2N3]\u2013AMPZ are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe shortest distance between the N atom in the dicyanamide ion and the H atom in the methyl functional group in the imidazole ring is 2.1 \u00c5, suggesting tight bonding in [DMIM][C2N3], while the shortest distance between the same atoms in [EMIM] [C2N3] is 2.2 \u00c5, which slightly increases, probably due to the bulky ethyl functional group.15 When AMPZ is combined, the corresponding distance remains almost the same with a variation of only 0.1 \u00c5. The amino group in AMPZ also appears to interact with the methyl and ethyl groups in imidazole, based on the distances of 2.3\u20132.4 \u00c5 from the radial distribution function, which can explain the aggregation formation energy and support the stability and miscibility of the ionic liquid and AMPZ.\n18962 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 18960\u201318963\nThe ESI\u2020 shows the IR spectrum of the [EMIM][C2N3] and AMPZ mixture as a function of AMPZ content. The IR spectrum of [EMIM][C2N3] remains the same with the appearance of a weak band near 2800 to 3000 cm\u22121, which can be attributed to the increase of AMPZ due to the asymmetric C\u2013H methyl group stretching and the symmetric stretching vibrations near 2980 cm\u22121 and 2870 cm\u22121.16 Additionally, the IR band at 988 cm\u22121 appears when AMPZ is mixed, which can be attributed to the non-bonding interaction of the methyl group with the amino group.\nThe preliminary molecular dynamics simulation was performed on the [DMIM][C2N3] and AMPZ aggregate in a 20 \u00c5\u00d7 20 \u00c5 \u00d7 20 \u00c5 box using a Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat at 373 K to ensure complete mixing for 5 ps.17 Referring to the TG/DTAmeasurement under nitrogen, [DMIM][C2N3] and [EMIM][C2N3] were found to be stable up to 473 K, as shown in ESI.\u2020 The system quickly reached equilibrium, indicating the interaction between the ionic liquid and AMPZ based on kinetic energy, potential energy, and temperature. Further details can be found in ESI.\u2020 The simulation demonstrates the non-bonded interaction between the ionic liquid and the additive, AMPZ.\nDuring the molecular dynamics simulation at 373 K, the interaction of the dicyanamide ion with the imidazolium cation can be observed by examining the distance between the terminal nitrogen in dicyanamide and the methyl functional group, as shown in ESI.\u202018 The corresponding distance observed during the simulation was 2 \u00c5, indicating that the dicyanamide ion is in close contact with the imidazolium cation.\nAs the dicyanamide ion moves, all hydrogens in the [DMIM] [C2N3] molecule can interact with the dicyanamide ion for contact ion pairing. Meanwhile, the interaction between AMPZ and [DMIM][C2N3] can be explicitly monitored bymeasuring the radial distribution function between the amino group andmethyl group in the imidazolium cation.18 The corresponding radial distribution function showed that the interacting distance appeared at 2 \u00c5, suggesting that AMPZ can diffuse in and out freely to provide homogeneous distribution in the mixture.\nIn summary, we nd the remarkable effect of AMPZ containing hydrazine-like functional group on the reduction of the ignition delay of energetic ionic liquid around 20 ms with the low vapor pressure; otherwise, it shows a much longer ignition delay time, rendering difficulty for the design of the green propulsion system. Further, we have found the intimate interaction between AMPZ and energetic ionic liquid using DFT calculation, suggesting a compatible mixture for chemical propulsion."
