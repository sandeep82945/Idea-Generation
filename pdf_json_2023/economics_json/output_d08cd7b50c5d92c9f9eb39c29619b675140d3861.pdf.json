    "abstractText": "Introduction: Jordan declared a quarantine in March 2020 and shut down all educational institutions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. E-learning was a novel way to continue the educational process in the wake of the pandemic. The study evaluates online learning (OL), aiming to examine the economic, financial, and psychological effects of OL on students, as well as their concentration, university instructors' efficiency, and satisfaction with OL. This research also explores the gender association of OL effects in Jordanian universities. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A self-filled questionnaire was generated using an online form and distributed to students at public and private universities through social media. The questionnaire utilized a five-point Likert scale to assess various aspects related to OL. The main evaluation involved a Chi-square test and posthoc test to examine gender-based differences in the factors associated with OL. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of 0.721 and a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.7. Results: A total of 720 responses were collected and analyzed. The results revealed a significant gender association with the economic/financial (P=0.001) and psychological (P=0.002) effects of OL. It was observed that 65.3% of students reported feeling depressed due to online learning. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between students' concentration and university instructors' efficiency (P=0.00). Interestingly, only 14.72% of students believed university instructors were 100% efficient in teaching theoretical and practical subjects. Additionally, 55% of the students expressed their desire for university instructors to record lectures for ease of access. Conclusion: The study concludes that OL's poor economic/financial effects disproportionately affect female students. On the other hand, male students were more likely to strongly disagree with the poor psychological effects of OL. Moreover, female students were more inclined to strongly disagree with the notion that OL has no psychological effect. Lastly, significant findings indicate that both students and university instructors share equal responsibility for the success of OL in Jordanian universities.

            "text": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan, like many other countries, faced the challenge of sustaining the educational process amidst lockdowns and social distancing measures [1,2]. As a result, e-learning emerged as a critical method to continue education after the pandemic's onset. Among the affected population, university students and academic staff at higher education institutes experienced significant stress and anxiety due to the unprecedented situation [2,3]. To address the evolving educational landscape, the Ministry of Higher Education required educational institutions to submit plans and reports outlining their policies during this period. Additionally, students were given the option to include or exclude their online grades from their cumulative GPA, reflecting the adaptability needed during this period of uncertainty.\nSurveys conducted during this time highlighted that while most universities could provide \"Reliable\" video conferencing, issues such as fluctuating internet speeds and limited access to laptops hindered the full benefits of distance learning [4]. To meet the stringent accreditation requirements for university degrees in Jordan, educational institutions endeavored to integrate online learning with on-campus education, leading to substantial efforts to improve the quality of online teaching. Key areas of focus included enhancing the\nHow to cite this article Tadros O, Arabiyat S, Al-Daghastani T, et al.

Furthermore, the shift to online learning called for the adaptation of assessment methods to meet the new demands of remote education [2,5].\nThis study aims to evaluate online learning (OL) from the perspective of Jordanian students, focusing on various aspects of its impact. The research seeks to examine the economic, financial, and psychological effects of OL on students, along with evaluating their concentration, university instructors' efficiency, and overall satisfaction with OL. Additionally, the research delves into the gender association of OL effects in Jordanian universities. By analyzing students' satisfaction with the online learning process and its broader social and economic implications, this study aims to provide valuable insights for optimizing the efficacy and accessibility of online teaching in the context of Jordanian higher education."

The questionnaire also assessed various factors associated with online learning, including the financial effects of OT, its psychological impact, and its association with bullying and isolation among students. Participants were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with online learning at Jordanian universities and express their views on the pass-fail grading system during OT.\nThe questionnaire underwent a rigorous development process, starting with testing and refining it through multiple iterations with a focus group. After each round of revisions, the questionnaire was shared again for further testing until a semi-final version was achieved. To ensure its effectiveness, a small group assessed respondent skips, interpretations, and option comprehension.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The present study examined the impact of OL on Jordanian university students, focusing on various factors affecting their learning experiences. Jordan boasts 40 universities, including public, private, regional, and foreign institutions, adhering to high higher education standards [6,7]. Our findings revealed a significant gender association with the economic/financial effects of OL, as many female students saved on transportation expenses but incurred additional costs for electronic devices and internet services to attend online lectures. This contradicted previous studies by Ong & Lai, which indicated that women were more influenced by perceptions of computer self-efficacy and ease of use [8], and aligned with the results of Jiang et al., who found that females were less likely than males to enroll in massive open online courses [9].\nMoreover, students from disadvantaged areas encountered challenges with OL, such as poor connectivity and limited access to personal electronic devices, leading to reduced time spent studying online compared to pre-pandemic conditions [3]. As a result, 8% of students felt that the educational benefits did not justify the costs, leading them to prefer a pass-fail grading system to prevent any negative impact on their GPAs.\nLoneliness, isolation, and depressive feelings were reported by students during the online learning experience, with an increase in bullying among colleagues, in line with similar findings in a Canadian study that highlighted the negative impact on students' social lives and increased need for social support services [10]. Our results also supported a significant gender association with the poor psychological effects of OL, with posthoc tests indicating that more males disagreed strongly with experiencing such effects [11]. Additionally, our study found that more females strongly disagreed with the notion of no psychological effect of OL, aligning with previous studies showing females to be more psychologically affected [12]. Magson et al. also reported significant increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety among adolescents during the transition to online learning, particularly pronounced among girls [13].\nFurthermore, our evaluation of the association between students' concentration and university instructors' efficiency for OL demonstrated that both factors significantly contribute to the success of OL. These results corroborate Wenglinsky's findings, indicating that university instructors can play an equal role in student learning alongside the students themselves [14]. However, no sufficient studies were found to show a direct association between OL success dependency and student concentration. A recent study by Walters et al. indicates that pupils' learning experiences, including concentration, engagement, capacity to learn, and selfesteem from learning, were significantly lower for online learning compared to the traditional classroom setting, with the transition to online learning negatively impacting students' ability to concentrate, engage in their schoolwork, and learn, leading to decreased feelings of self-worth and mental well-being, particularly among students with specific learning difficulties [15].\nRegarding student satisfaction, our study found no significant association between gender and satisfaction\n2023 Tadros et al. Cureus 15(8): e42994. DOI 10.7759/cureus.42994 9 of 11\nfor OL, which contrasts with the results of Yekefallah et al. may be attributed to the difference in sample size [16]. However, our findings align with Al Azmeh's study, showing no variation in electronic services and student satisfaction based on gender, specialty, or age [17]. Suri & Sharma also reported that there was no correlation between gender and the use of different e-learning formats [18]. Nevertheless, Martin et al. found that the students were less satisfied with the learning procedure [19].\nRegarding university instructors' efficiency, students reported lower effectiveness in online teaching compared to on-campus instruction for both theoretical and practical subjects. This might be attributed to the challenges and psychological distress university instructors faced during the COVID-19 pandemic [2], as supported by the study of Yasemin et al., which found that instructors' beliefs in their abilities to meet distance education requirements were not at a high level [20].\nFinally, students provided suggestions to enhance online teaching, including incorporating illustrative techniques, adjusting lecture times, and recording lectures. This aligned with the findings of Nartiningrum and Nugroho, where students expressed the need for more communication and social interactions among instructors and students [21]. Similarly, Martin et al. reported low ratings for interactive visual syllabi and video-based course introductions for online courses [19]. In our study, 29% of students expressed the need for more interactive lectures, which they felt were lacking in OL. The impact of self-awareness and student engagement in online sessions on the success of OL was also recognized in previous studies [22,23].\nThe findings highlight the significance of recording online lectures and employing illustrative techniques as essential strategies to optimize students' perceptions and enhance the online learning process. Additionally, emphasizing the shared responsibility between students and instructors is crucial for successful online learning outcomes. To address potential economic constraints, one suggestion is to provide economical internet bundles that enable students to engage effectively in online learning. Furthermore, a combined approach of online and in-campus learning may be employed to mitigate any psychological effects associated with exclusive online learning."

            "text": "The main limitations of this study are related to the online distribution of the questionnaire, which may have resulted in unequal responses from public and private universities, limiting the representation of diverse perspectives among students in Jordan. Nevertheless, online data collection allows students to freely express their true experience regarding online learning and is the most practical way to reach out to the intended study sample. Additionally, the study's focus on students enrolled in medical-related fields may restrict the generalizability of its findings to students in other academic disciplines. To enhance the study's comprehensiveness, future research could incorporate a more balanced representation of universities and include a wider range of academic fields, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of students' perceptions of online learning across diverse educational contexts."

The findings also indicated that only a few students believed that university instructors were 100% efficient in teaching theoretical and practical subjects during online learning. However, incorporating illustrative techniques and recording lectures emerged as potential strategies to enhance learning efficiency.
