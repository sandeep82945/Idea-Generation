A preventive surgical procedure is recommended when the maximum aortic antero-posterior diameter, periodically assessed on two-dimensional abdominal ultrasound scans, reaches 5.5\u00a0mm. Although the maximum diameter criterion has limited ability to predict aneurysm rupture, no clinically relevant tool that could complement the current guidelines has emerged so far. In vivo cyclic strains in the aneurysm wall are related to the wall response to blood pressure pulse, and therefore, they can be linked to wall mechanical properties, which in turn contribute to determining the risk of rupture. This work aimed to enable biomechanical estimations in the aneurysm wall by providing a fast and semi-automatic method to post-process dynamic clinical ultrasound sequences and by mapping the cross-sectional strains on the B-mode image. Specifically, the Sparse Demons algorithm was employed to track the wall motion throughout multiple cardiac cycles. Then, the cyclic strains were mapped by means of radial basis function interpolation and differentiation. We applied our method to two-dimensional sequences from eight patients. The automatic part of the analysis took under 1.5\u00a0min\u00a0per cardiac cycle. The tracking method was validated against simulated ultrasound sequences, and a maximum root mean square error of 0.22\u00a0mm was found. The strain was calculated both with our method and with the established finiteelement method, and a very good agreement was found, with mean differences of one order of magnitude smaller than the image spatial resolution. Most patients exhibited a strain pattern that suggests interaction with the spine. To conclude, our method is a promising tool for investigating abdominal aortic aneurysm wall biomechanics as it can provide a fast and accurate measurement of the cyclic wall strains from clinical ultrasound sequences.\nAbbreviations: 2D US, two-dimensional ultrasound; 3D US, three-dimensional ultrasound; AAA, abdominal aortic aneurysm; AP, antero-posterior; BSC, backscattering coefficient; FEM, finiteelement method; ICC, interclass correlation coefficient; RBF, radial basis function; RMSE, root mean square error; ROI, region of interest; SD, Sparse Demons.\nFrontiers in Physiology 01 frontiersin.org\nKEYWORDS\nabdominal aortic aneurysm, ultrasound B-mode cine-loops, vascular wall strains, strain imaging, ultrasound elastography, ultrasound simulations, radial basis functions, finite element modeling"

            "text": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an irreversible dilation of the arterial wall usually localized in the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta, resulting in a balloon-like bulge. Mostly affecting the elderly male population, with a prevalence of between 4% and 8% in men aged above 65, it is often described as a silent killer since it becomes symptomatic only upon rupture (Nordon\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010). Given the degenerative nature of AAA, regular surveillance is fundamental after diagnosis. As of today, a preventive surgical procedure is the only viable treatment if the bulge size reaches a certain threshold (Chaikof\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018). Current guidelines prescribe the maximum diameter criterion as an independent risk factor for surgical decision-making. This criterion consists of a genderadjusted threshold for surgery (i.e., 5\u00a0cm for women and 5.5\u00a0cm for men) and is based on large population studies (Moll\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). Despite the maximum diameter being an established criterion in clinical practice, serious concerns about its efficacy have emerged (Raut\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013).\nAlongside morphological assessment, several studies suggest thatwall biomechanics provide important information on the degree of severity of the disease. Wall strain in response to blood pulse pressure is a measure of wall distensibility and can provide insight into disease progression (Wilson\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; Cebull\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2019). In addition, peak wall stress has been associated with rupture risk (Fillinger\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; Polzer\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). To correctly perform stress analyses, patient-specific material properties including wall stiffness are fundamental (Bruder\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Material testing can provide a detailed characterization of the aortic tissue, but it can only be performed post-operatively. Conversely, in vivo estimations of AAA mechanical properties based on time-resolved AAA imaging could complement the current clinical guidelines. Specifically, AAA wall motion analysis allows for strain estimation, which in turn can be related to the wall stresses or can be used for inverse identification of material properties (Bihari\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013).\nIn current clinical practice, the most reliable imaging technique to assess the AAA diameter is computed tomography, or, alternatively, the recently emerging three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) imaging techniques (Ghulam\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). However, computed tomography provides a static representation of the AAA, while the low frame rate of 3D US (up to 20\u00a0Hz) limits its usability for deformation tracking. Conversely, two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) B-mode images can be acquired at a high frame rate using a 2D probe to image a single plane (up to 80\u00a0Hz) or using a 3D probe to perform bi-plane acquisitions (up to 40\u00a0Hz) (Bihari\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013; Wittek\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017). Because of their high temporal resolution and widespread use in clinical practice, 2D US cine-loop sequences are viable candidates for clinical research studies on wall motion and for clinical applications with real-time\nmeasurements, overall contributing to the clinical translation of AAA non-invasive biomechanical assessment.\nBased on 2D US, several tools have been developed to calculate the mechanical properties of the AAA wall. Assuming a circumferential vessel section, the cyclic AAA diameter variation was used as ameasure of the globalwall strain, as in theDiamove tool (Teltec, Lund, Sweden). The global wall stiffness was also estimated by relating the diameter change to blood pressure variation, as described in Hansen\u00a0et\u00a0al. (1993). Although very straightforward, this global method showed poor predictive power, suggesting the need for local wall strain estimationmethods (Lorenzen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn general, the steps needed to compute the AAA wall strains are segmentation, motion tracking, and displacement estimation. Segmentation is usually a manual delineation of the wall in the first frame of the sequence, which is then automatically tracked in the successive frames. To measure circumferential strains along the aortic wall, tracking algorithms were used to track the wall motion in 2D US cine-loops (Brekken\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006; Vonk\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Mix\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017). In an early study (Brekken\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006), the wall was segmented with a single layer of points. The wall motion along the tangential direction was accurately recorded for the selected points with M-mode imaging, but only on a single dimension. In later works, alongside the improvement in image quality and spatial resolution, 2D multi-layer strategies for AAA wall motion tracking were proposed by several authors. Their main goal was to analyze displacements in the wall thickness and, thus, provide deeper insight into the local wall strain. The tracking algorithms were based on cross-correlation between radio-frequency signals (Vonk\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Mix\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; de\u00a0Hoop\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Alternatively, B-mode speckle tracking echocardiography was adapted for AAA 2D and 3D US sequences (Bihari\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013; Derwich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). However, while single-layer methods are almost real-time, tracking wider areas of interest significantly increases the time needed for strain mapping, resulting in up to 60\u00a0min\u00a0per scan (Zottola\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2022).\nIn addition to computational costs, previous studies have also reported critical challenges related to image quality for clinical translation of non-invasive AAA mechanical estimations (Petterson\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). B-mode image formation depends on the direction of acoustic scattering generated by the soft tissues. As a consequence, image quality can vary locally according to the position and orientation of the tissues. In particular, AAA lateral walls are hard to image because they are oriented parallel to the transmitted beams, thus producing a weaker echo scatter signal. It follows that tracking accuracy may vary along the circumference of the aortic wall, especially in lateral locations with lower echogenicity.\nOnce the wall motion is tracked, strains can be directly computed from the displacement field. A simple approach consists\nFrontiers in Physiology 02 frontiersin.org\nin computing the engineering strain: the wall contour is discretized in the circumferential direction, and the local strain is calculated as the ratio between the elongation and the initial length of each segment making up the wall (Brekken\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006). The main limitation of this approach is that the strains are given only on a single dimension, i.e., the curvilinear coordinate describing the wall and, therefore, the strain estimation is highly dependent on segmentation and discretization methods. Another common method relies on the numerical differentiation of a dense 2D displacement field based on bilinear shape functions, the typical approach of the finite-element method (FEM), resulting in fullfield strain representations (Mix\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; Zottola\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2022). However, this approach requires performing tracking on a regular mesh, constraining the location of the tracking points to the nodes of this mesh. To remove the need for a regular grid for computation, meshless methods, and specifically radial basis function (RBF)-based methods, can be employed to solve relatively simple mechanical problems with complex geometries from sparse source points (Patel and Rachchh, 2020).\nIn this work, we aimed to contribute to the clinical translation of AAA wall biomechanical estimations by proposing a fast, noninvasive, and accurate 2D strain mapping method based on clinical\ndynamic US acquisitions. By combining a sparse tracking algorithm and RBF strain computation, we designed a method that can adapt to the heterogeneous US image quality as well as deal with the time constraints typical of multi-layer approaches. In addition, we performed a feasibility study on a small cohort of patients, and we independently validated the tracking and strain computation algorithms."

The patients were enrolled in a study on AAA surveillance approved by the Danish Regional Research Ethics Committee (record number H-20001116) and gave their written consent. For each of the 10 patients, US B-mode cine-loop sequences were acquired during breath-holds in supine position with an EPIQ (Philips Healthcare) scanner. For each patient, we acquired a singleplane sequence with a 2D probe (C5-1) and a bi-plane sequence with a 3D probe (X6-1). The bi-plane sequences comprised both transversal and longitudinal views. For this study, we analyzed the transversal view. The image resolution ranged between 0.2\u00a0mm \u00d7 0.2\u00a0mm and 0.3\u00a0mm \u00d7 0.3\u00a0mm. Probes were positioned on the patient\u2019s abdomen in order to visualize the maximum AP AAA diameter section in the transversal plane according to clinical guidelines. In this orientation, the posterior wall of the AAA is at the bottom of the scan, anatomically adjacent to the vertebral column, whereas the anterior wall is at the top, on the probe side. As in standard AAA echography, the patient\u2019s anatomic left is observed on the right of the scan view.The US focal depth was placed adjacent to the posterior AAA wall, at the AAA\u2013vertebra interface. No contrast medium was to be present in the patient\u2019s blood. Two patients were excluded from the analysis: one had contrast medium in their bloodstream and the other displayed large breathing artifacts and low image quality. As a result, data from eight patients were deemed suitable for the analysis."

Landmark placement was more challenging in the lateral walls due to the lack of echoes, and, when visible, at the interface with the intraluminal thrombus, which is more echogenic than blood. The final segmentation of the inner wall was achieved by interpolating the points and discretizing the contour to a fixed, regularly spaced number of points."

The final grid is obtained by building two intermediate layers by partitioning the segment connecting the inner layer to the outer layer nodes into three segments. Therefore, the connecting segments are not necessarily normal to the vessel wall. N is chosen to guarantee an aspect ratio of the grid elements close to 1.\nspaced output grid was then generated for strain visualization using the inner and outer layers of the ROI. Figure\u00a02 shows an example of an output grid with four layers. The grid density was determined in accordance with the results of the convergence study presented in Section\u00a02.5.5."

Local extrema in the AP diameter temporal evolution define the peak-systole (maxima) and end-diastole (minima) frames (Figure\u00a01C). Notably, in this work, we adopted the typical cardiac terminology to refer to the abdominal aortic pressure cycle for simplicity, but a physiological delay exists. Each sequence can thus be split into pressure cycles starting at the beginning of systole (or end of the previous diastole). For each sequence, a cycle of reference is also selected as the cycle where the diameter variation from end-diastole to the next peak-systole is closest to the mean diameter variation. The peak detection algorithm was tested by determining the variability of the cycle length within a sequence as well as the AP diameter change."

The points were selected on the first tracked frame, i.e., the start of the first systole of the sequence. First, the gradient of the image was calculated as the sum in two dimensions of the Sobel operator (Sobel and Feldman, 1968). A sorting algorithm was then implemented to select the points based on their gradient value. To avoid clustering, a minimum distance between the points was imposed.This distance constrains the number of points in an image and, thus, the computational cost, and it was empirically set to 1\u00a0mm as no improvement was observed for smaller distances. The points were selected only within and on the edges of the ROI (Figure\u00a01E).

We propose a similar validation strategy for the AAA wall motion tracking. Specifically, we have simulated eight 2D US sequences for which the displacement field is known. In order to achieve realistic simulation, the MATLAB Ultrasound Simulation Toolbox (MUST, Garcia (2021)) was employed. MUST allows the generation of a B-mode image starting from a template image. Acoustic echoes are simulated by convolving an acoustic pressure field with the impulse response of a set of independentmonopole point sources, or scatterers, in the frequency domain. Each scatterer generates an echo proportional to its reflection or backscattering coefficient (BSC).The BSCwas calculated based on the intensity level in the corresponding location on the template image, as explained by Alessandrini\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2015). For a generic scatterer s, we used the following relationship\nBSCs = Is\n255\u03b3 , (1)\nwhere Is the pixel amplitude and \u03b3 is an experimental parameter fixed to 0.2. The scatterers were selected on the image domain in random locations, and their density was set experimentally as a compromise between image quality and the computational cost of the simulation, resulting in around 11,000 scatterers per frame.\nTo simulate the displacement of the wall, 2D US cine-loop sequences obtained from the patients were used as templates. From each sequence, the frames belonging to the first detected cycle were extracted. To capture themotion, we adopted the approach proposed by Alessandrini\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2018): the scatterers were grouped into two distinct maps, the moving (coherent) map and the background (incoherent) map, depending on their location.The scatterers inside the wall ROI were in the coherent map and were assigned fixed BSC values in the first frame of the template sequence. Conversely, the scatterers in the background were in the incoherent map, and their BSCwas updated at each frame.While the location of the incoherent scatter map was fixed, the coherent maps moved according to a predetermined displacement field. Finally, a transition zone of 1\u00a0mm between the two maps was created. The wall displacement field was generated by exporting the sequence output grid to a FEM solver (ABAQUS Inc.) and simulating a plane strain inflation test with a uniform pressure of 3\u00a0kPa, followed by deflation to the initial state. The inflation and deflation phases were matched to the systolic and diastolic phases in the sequence, respectively, and the output of the simulation was sampled with the sequence frame rate. In this way, we obtained a temporal coherence between the real sequence and the simulated one.The nodal displacements resulting from the FEM simulation were considered the ground truth, and they were applied to the coherent scatter map after interpolation. The simulation of a single B-mode 2D US sequence took 224\u00a0min\u00a0for a 33-frame cycle using 20 parallel threads on a 2 CPU Intel Xeon 10\u00a0core 2.6\u00a0GHz processor.\nFor validation, the nodes of the output grid, used as an input to the FEM, were placed on the first frame of the sequence (i.e., the beginning of the first cycle) and tracked with the SD\u00a0algorithm. The obtained displacement field was then compared to the ground\nFrontiers in Physiology 05 frontiersin.org\ntruth to evaluate the tracking accuracy. We computed the error in each frame and each point of the grid as the distance between the tracked points and the corresponding ground truth points to have a local measure of the error. The proposed method was also used to test the benefits of automatic point selection. Each sequence was tracked both using the output grid and the automatic segmentation approach. Then, we computed the root mean square error (RMSE) in all frames."

For this purpose, RBF interpolation and differentiation were adopted to accurately map AAA wall strains, similar to what was performed by Biancolini (2017) and Chiappa\u00a0et\u00a0al.

Wall distensibility in response to pulsating blood pressure can provide clinicians with relevant information on the degree of wall degeneration, therefore contributing to decision-making (Wilson\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003). However, the estimation of AAA wall biomechanical properties in the clinic is hindered by the lack of non-invasive measurement tools. Current methods make strong assumptions to reduce the computational burden (Hansen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1993) but with unsatisfactory results in terms of risk assessment (Lorenzen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021).

Thus, manual cropping of the sequence was performed by the reader by looking at the AP evolution curve. At least two consecutive stable cycles per sequence were selected. After the manual sequence cropping was performed, the peak detection algorithm showed an inter-cycle variability of cycle length up to 0.4\u00a0s. The cardiac cycle duration was coherent between the two probes, and the cases of large rhythm variability were captured by both probes (e.g., P3 in Figure\u00a04). In general, the X6-1 probe detected shorter cycles, which could be due to its lower temporal resolution. A cyclic AP diameter expansion of up to 2.1\u00a0mm was found, in line with the clinical assessments in Gr\u00f8ndal\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2012). In some cases (P1, P5, and P7), the two probes revealed a high difference in the values of AP diameter variation. This variability could be due to a difference in transducer position often associated with tortuous AAA Sch\u00e4berle\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2015). An intraprobe reproducibility study is needed to confirm this hypothesis."

Specifically, in this study, an automatic procedure was developed to only select the points in the ROI where the gradient was above an empirically chosen threshold. As a consequence, it can be postulated that the manual wall segmentation had a limited effect on the tracking results, as it only influenced the ROI selection. SD\u00a0tracking performance was previously validated on myocardial sequences (Somphone\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013), finding a maximum global displacement error of 0.8\u00a0mm. In the present study, we proposed a validation strategy for AAA wall tracking based on physical simulations, adapting the pipeline presented in Alessandrini\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2018). Specifically, we simulated 2D US sequences of AAA with an imposed wall motion, which was used to evaluate the tracking algorithm accuracy. For most cases, the highest tracking errors were observed at systole, where tissue velocity is highest. However, for one case, (P5), the error followed a different pattern and kept increasing throughout the sequence. For this case, the high tracking error was associated with a signal void in the lateral wall where the tissue was not visible, and, therefore, could not be tracked. In general, the RMSE foundwas below0.22\u00a0mm,which iswithin theB-mode spatial resolution.

The advantage of using an automated point selection based on gradient, as opposed to using a regular grid, was best demonstrated in cases with low-signal regions. In these regions, extrapolating motion from the adjacent wall segment using RBF fields proved more effective than tracking. In general, the RMSE found was below 0.22\u00a0mm, which is within the B-mode spatial resolution. The automatic selection showed an improvement of up to 0.06\u00a0mm in the tracking performance compared to tracking on a regularly spaced grid.

Contrary to mesh-based methods, meshless methods can adapt to sparse source points. To validate the strain estimation independently from the previously mentioned steps, we compared the RBF differentiation method to the mesh-based\nnumerical approach, typical of FEM. The two approaches show similar convergence rates, RBF being slightly faster. Furthermore, we found a difference between the two methods of up to 20% of the FEM value in the high-strain zones. The tendency of RBF to provide higher strain and stress values with respect to the FEM is in agreement with what was previously found by Groth\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2022). Equivalent results were found by running the FEM with full integration elements. A possible strategy to reduce this distance could be to fine-tune the RBF parameters."

(2020) found similar results whenmapping the aortic wall strains from 2D US in a phantom. In their study, a porcine aorta was embedded in an abdominal phantom and put in contact with a vertebral segment in order to mimic the boundary conditions of a human aorta. We hypothesize that the negative or small strains in the posterior wall could be associated with the motion constraint caused by the spine. However, a decrease in length in the circumferential direction that is not accompanied by a radial expansion would be more likely due to cyclic out-of-plane motion. Because the posterior wall experiences less in-plane motion due to the spine, as previously shown by Goergen\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2007), we also expect a higher impact of the out-of-plane motion (P4, P7, and P8 in Figure\u00a010). Wall strain assessments from time-resolved 3D US revealed high circumferential strains happening in the posterior wall (Derwich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020), suggesting that the complex 3D motion of the AAA should be taken into account when interpreting 2D USbased strain maps. The described pattern did not appear in one patient, possibly due to the presence of intraluminal thrombus (P1 - Figure\u00a07), which was previously found to have a large impact on the stress distribution in the wall (Lorandon\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2022)."

The polar plots have the same orientation as the 2D US scan (i.e., with the AAA posterior wall on the bottom).\ncompared to the wall area, which is a characteristic of AAA sequences. Although the SD\u00a0algorithm only tracks the selected points, background motion influenced the tracking because of the image filtering performed as a pre-processing step for regularization. Therefore, a new validation pipeline should be proposed that imposes a coherent motion to the background motion of the template image. In addition, the impact of spatial and temporal resolution could be investigated bymeans ofUS simulations in order to better assess the robustness of the proposed method.\nAs a further limitation, we did not impose any mechanical equilibrium on the wall strain field. Therefore, we do not assume the wall to be a continuum. Enforcing equilibrium could provide a reconstruction of the strain field where the information from the B-mode images is missing. However, such an approach would also assume the absence of out-of-plane forces and surrounding tissues, leading to an erroneous reconstruction. Thus, a dedicated analysis should be performed to study the impact of these boundary conditions on the AAA wall mechanics. Adding a correction factor based on tracking in the longitudinal plane would help account for out-of-plane motion.\nLast, our study is limited to a small cohort of patients and was sensitive to acquisition conditions, such as large motions and the presence of contrast medium in the blood. Clinical studies on larger cohorts of patients are needed to confirm our findings on the strain maps as well as to obtain a better insight into the reproducibility of strain measurements. The same probe intrapatient reproducibility should be assessed to better characterize the different factors affecting US-based mechanical estimations, including transducer placement, patient stillness, and sonographer level of expertise. In addition, the tracking algorithm could be made more robust to undesired motion by applying temporal smoothing and by re-initializing the point selection at the beginning of each cycle. By doing so, our method could generalize to less stable cycles, thus decreasing the need for sequence cropping and potentially broadening its applicability.\nThe efficiency of our method could be improved by better harnessing the sparse nature of the RBF differentiation for strain computation. In practice, instead of providing the full displacement and strain meshes as maps, as typically performed in the field (Mix\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; de\u00a0Hoop\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Zottola\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2022), we could\nFrontiers in Physiology 14 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 12 Polar plots comparing the finite element (FEM) and radial basis function (RBF) methods for strain validation.

Because full automation is desired for reproducible and fast results, we aim to develop an automatic wall segmentation as well as an automatic sequence cropping and to study the impact of the initial wall delineation on the strain maps. Ultimately, wall strain could be estimated during the acquisition in order to have an overview of the AAA wall distensibility within the clinical assessment time."
