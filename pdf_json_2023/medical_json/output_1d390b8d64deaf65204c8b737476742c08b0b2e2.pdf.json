Enzymes\ninvolved in the conversion from 7-ACA to D-7-ACA present critical resources in\nthe pharmaceutical industry. In the present study, a putative acetylesterase, EstSJ,\nidentified from Bacillus subtilis KATMIRA1933, was first heterologously expressed\nin Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and biochemically characterized. EstSJ belongs\nto carbohydrate esterase family 12 and is active on short-chain acyl esters from\np-NPC2 to p-NPC6. Multiple sequence alignments showed that EstSJ was also an SGNH family esterase with a typical GDS(X) motif at its N-terminal end and a catalytic triad composed of Ser186-Asp354-His357. The purified EstSJ displayed the highest specific activity of 1,783.52 U mg\u22121 at 30\u25e6C and pH 8.0, and was stable\nwithin the pH range of 5.0\u201311.0. EstSJ can deacetylate the C3\u2032 acetyl group of 7-ACA to generate D-7-ACA, and the deacetylation activity was 4.50 U mg\u22121.\nBased on the structural and molecular docking with 7-ACA, the catalytic active sites (Ser186-Asp354-His357) together with four substrate-binding residues (Asn259, Arg295, Thr355, and Leu356) of EstSJ are revealed. This study provided a promising\n7-ACA deacetylase candidate that could be applied to produce D-7-ACA from\n7-ACA in the pharmaceutical industry.\nKEYWORDS\n7-ACA, D-7-ACA, deacetylation, esterase, acetylesterase\nIntroduction\nCephalosporins are a class of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics that are widely used to treat and prevent diseases caused by bacteria that disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall (Guo et al., 2016). However, due to uncontrolled use and a continuous production of cephalosporins, an increasing number of pathogenic bacteria with antibiotic-resistance genes that can escape from various types of antibiotics have emerged. Therefore, exploring and developing new types of effective antibacterial antibiotics are urgent (Theuretzbacher et al., 2020). Deacetyl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid (D-7-ACA) is\nFrontiers in Microbiology 01 frontiersin.org\nan important intermediate for synthesizing new kinds of semisynthetic cephalosporins due to the modification of the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of D-7-ACA which is easy to be achieved (Tan et al., 2018), such as the generation of clinically used cefoxitin and cefuroxime (Ma et al., 2015, 2016). Two major methods, namely, chemical and enzymatic deacetylation of 7-ACA, could be used to generate D-7-ACA. The enzymatic processes using deacetylases or esterases have attracted more attention and have gradually become the prevailing trend for the production of D-7-ACA, compared with the chemical approaches that require energy-intensive conditions and generate toxic waste (Ma et al., 2016).\nEsterases (EC 3.1.1.X) that can hydrolyze esters or synthesize pure compounds are widely used for the preparation of commercial products that are used in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries (Zhang et al., 2017). Esterases or deacetylases are typically classified into 20 carbohydrate esterase (CE) families in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database1 based on their activities on carbohydrate ligands and deacetylases or esterases from the CE7 or the CE12 family exhibiting deacetylation activity toward cephalosporins are included. To date, several esterases, namely, Axe1 (Thermoanaerobacterium sp. JW/SL-YS485) (Lorenz and Wiegel, 1997), Axe (Bacillus pumilus PS213) (Degrassi et al., 2000), CAH (Bacillus subtilis 168) (Vincent et al., 2003), TM0077 (Thermotoga maritima MSB8) (Levisson et al., 2012), AXE (Bacillus subtilis CICC 20034) (Tian et al., 2014), PbAcE (Paenibacillus sp. R4) (Park et al., 2018), and EstZY (Alicyclobacillus tengchongensis) (Ding et al., 2020) from the CE7 family have been characterized and demonstrated their activities on 7-ACA or cephalosporin C. Additionally, among the CE12 family, YesT from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 (Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2008), BH1115 from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (Navarro-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008), and EstD1 from A. tengchongensis (Ding et al., 2016) also exhibited 7-ACA deacetylation activity. Although deacetylases or esterases that are active on 7-ACA have good industrial and pharmaceutical potential, reports on such enzymes, especially with high deacetylation activities, are still limited.\nEsterases belonging to \u03b1/\u03b2 superfamily enzymes contain a catalytic triad (S-D/E-H) and a conserved pentapeptide motif (GXSXG) near the nucleophilic serine residue (Bhatt et al., 2021). Conversely, the SGNH hydrolase family does not contain a classical GXSXG motif and is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved, four-residue sequence motif near the N-terminal end (Ser-Gly-Asn-His, SGNH) (Kim et al., 2017; Mar\u0161avelski et al., 2020). The SGNH hydrolases display broad substrate specificities and could be applied in various fields (Mar\u0161avelski et al., 2020). For example, LpSGNH1 (PDB ID: 3DC7), an SGNH esterase from Lactobacillus plantarum, was active on p-nitrophenyl acetate, acetyl xylan, glucose pentaacetate, cefotaxime, and 7-ACA (Kim et al., 2017). The catalytic mechanisms of SGNH hydrolases were also diverse, such as MsAcT (PDB ID: 2Q0S) from Mycobacterium smegmatis exhibiting both transesterification and side reaction hydrolysis activities (Kazemi et al., 2018). However, besides BH1115 (Navarro-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008) and EstD1 (Ding et al., 2016), limited information about the characterization of SGNH hydrolases\n1 http://www.cazy.org/\nwith 7-ACA deacetylation activities from microorganisms is available.\nIn this study, an acetylesterase, EstSJ, identified from probiotic bacteria Bacillus subtilis KATMIRA1933 (Karlyshev et al., 2014) and their biochemical characteristics were evaluated in detail. The sequence similarity, substrate binding, and activity on 7-ACA were determined through sequence alignment and kinetic analyses."

The signal sequence of EstSJ was predicted using SignalP 4.0 (Petersen et al., 2011). Phylogenetic analysis of EstSJ with other homologs was conducted by MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al., 2016). CAZy database was applied to classify EstSJ. Then, the estSJ gene was commercially synthesized and ligated into the pACYCDuet-1 vector by BamHI and NotI restriction sites with in-frame 6 \u00d7 His tag sequence fused at the C-terminus. EstSJ mutants, including the substitutions of potential catalytic triads (Ser186A, Asp354A, and His357A) and other residues (Asn259A, Arg295A, Thr355A, and Leu356A), were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (where A represents alanine). Primers used are shown in Supplementary Table 1, and the correct inserts were confirmed through DNA sequencing.\nThe recombinant plasmids, namely, wild-type pACYCDuet1/EstSJ and its mutants pACYCDuet-1/EstSJSer186A (EstSJAsp354A, EstSJHis357A, EstSJAsn259A, EstSJArg295A, EstSJThr355A, and EstSJLeu356A), were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells to heterologously overexpress EstSJ and its mutants, respectively.

The pH stability was measured by incubating EstSJ in various pH values at 30\u25e6C for 1 h, and temperature stability was evaluated by incubating EstSJ in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 25, 40, 45, and 50\u25e6C for specific time intervals, respectively.

K-ACET acetic acid kit was used to determine the deacetylation activity of EstSJ according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions by measuring the acetic acid released from 7-ACA. Specifically, the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mL EstSJ (111.7 \u00b5g) and 7.5 mM 7-ACA was incubated at 25\u25e6C for 10 min. Every test was conducted in triplicate and no enzyme was added to the reaction mixture in the control reaction for correction of spontaneous hydrolysis.

Meanwhile, activities of EstSJ on cefotaxime acid/cephalothin sodium/cefuroxime acid/7-ACA (50 mM) or tert-butyl acetate/linalyl acetate/glyceryl tributyrate/glyceryl trioleate/terpinyl acetate (25 mM) were detected by adding 400 \u00b5g EstSJ or EstSJ mutants and 0.02% bromothymol blue in Na2HPO4\u2013KH2PO4 buffer (50 mM, pH 7.3).\nHomologous modeling and molecular docking\nThe crystal structure of YXIM (PDB: 2O14) from B. subtilis, which shares 95.36% sequence similarity with EstSJ, was used as a template to build the 3D structure of EstSJ by an online SWISSMODEL server (Waterhouse et al., 2018). The online SAVES Server was applied to check the quality of the modeled structure.2 The chemical structure of 7-ACA was obtained from PubChem3 and the interaction between EstSJ and 7-ACA was predicted by AutoDock 4.2 (Morris et al., 2009). For the docking assays, polar hydrogen atoms were added both to the target protein and the ligand. In preparation, the docking poses were restricted to a grid that was of the dimension of 42 \u00c5 by 56 \u00c5 by 50 \u00c5 and centered on allatom centers of three active-site residues (Ser186-Asp354-His357).

The gene estSJ is 1,146 bp in length and encodes a protein of 382 amino acids. Its theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point were 41,823.33 Da and 6.34, respectively. BLASTP showed that EstSJ belongs to the rhamnogalacturonan_acetylesterase-like SGNH hydrolase superfamily and displayed the highest similarity with YXIM (PDB: 2O14), an esterase with unknown function from B. subtilis. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments of EstSJ with two characterized SGNH hydrolase superfamily members, TAPthioesterase I (PDB ID: 1IVN) from E. coli (Lo et al., 2003) and RGAE-rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase (PDB ID: 1DEO) from Aspergillus aculeatus (M\u00f8lgaard et al., 2000), revealed that there was a GDSL motif but not GXSXG at the N-terminal of EstSJ and four conserved residues, Ser, Gly, Asn, and His (SGNH), located in blocks I, II, III, and V (Jones et al., 2020; Mar\u0161avelski et al., 2020; Supplementary Figure 1).

Maximal activity of EstSJ was detected at pH 8.0 in Tris\u2013HCl buffer, and >50% of its original activity was maintained across a pH range of 7.5\u20139.5. No activity was detected at both pH values of 5.0 and 10.0 (Figure 4B). EstSJ was stable at a pH range between 5.0 and 10.0, and it maintained 70\u223c90% of its original activity when incubated at these pH ranges for 1 h (Figure 4D), indicating that it might be applied under acidic or alkaline conditions. Among other previously characterized esterases that were active on 7-ACA, EstSJ was comparable to those of EstZY and AXE, which was stable between pH 7.0\u201311.0 (Ding et al., 2020) and pH 6.0\u201311.0 (Tian et al., 2014), respectively. To investigate the optimum temperature of EstSJ, the effects of\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nvarious temperatures (0\u201370\u25e6C) on EstSJ were assayed. As shown in Figure 4A, the highest activity of EstSJ was observed at 30\u25e6C, which was similar to those of AcXEs (30\u25e6C), an esterase identified from a hot desert hypolith metagenomic DNA (Adesioye et al., 2018), but lower than that of EstA (95\u25e6C) (Levisson et al., 2009) from T. maritima, EstD1 (65\u25e6C) (Ding et al., 2016), or AXE (40\u25e6C) (Tian et al., 2014), respectively. The temperature stability was assessed by incubating EstSJ at 25, 40, 45, and 50\u25e6C for 1 h in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.0), respectively, and the residual activities were determined. EstSJ maintained more than 70 and 50% of its original activity after incubation at 25\u25e6C and 40\u25e6C for 1 h, respectively, whereas the activity decreased sharply at 45 or 50\u25e6C and was almost completely lost in 10 min at 50\u25e6C (Figure 4C). Among the reported deacetylases, EstSJ may be more appropriate for 7-ACA deacetylation in practice because 7-ACA is unstable at a high temperature. Under optimum pH and temperature, the Km, Kcat/Km, and specific activity of EstSJ toward p-NPC2 were 3.03 \u00b1 0.40 mM, 4652.69 S\u22121 mM\u22121, and 1783.52 U mg\u22121, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Previous reports showed that the enzymatic activities of AXE (Tian et al., 2014), EstZY (Ding et al., 2020), and TM0077 (Levisson et al., 2012) toward p-NPC2 were 2,949, 221.25, and 113.5\u00b1 1.5 U mg\u22121, respectively. The effects of metal ions or chemical reagents on EstSJ were investigated. As shown in Figure 4E, Ca2+ increased the activity of EstSJ slightly (3% activation), while Mn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Na+, Li+, Co2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Zn2+ exhibited an 8\u223c23% inhibition on EstSJ. Al3+ had moderate inhibitory effects (36% inhibition), and K+ had no obvious influence on EstSJ. Hg2+ and\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nAg+ displayed 59 and 79% inhibition on EstSJ, respectively. For the chemical reagents, Tween 80 [1% (v/v)], urea (1 mM), and EDTA (1 mM) inhibited EstSJ moderately by 21, 22, and 35%, respectively. DTT, SDS, and CTAB inhibited EstSJ strongly by 50, 55, and 73% (Figure 4F). Similar to AXE, Ca2+ also increased the activity of AXE by 2% activation. Fe3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ also inhibited AXE, but with 86, 52, and 56% inhibition, respectively, higher than that of EstSJ (Tian et al., 2014). Collectively, the good tolerance of EstSJ to metal ions or chemical reagents suggested that it could be a promising candidate in practical pharmaceutical use."

            "text": "The experimentally determined protein structures provided a bridge to study the structure unknown proteins through homology modeling, such as to identify the putative catalytic or specific substrate-binding residues that are important for enzyme activity (Waterhouse et al., 2018). The crystal structure of YXIM (PDB: 2O14) from B. subtilis sharing 95.36% similarity with EstSJ was employed as a template to create the homologous 3D structural model of EstSJ. The first 24 amino acid residues were not modeled. To date, a functional study about YXIM toward 7-ACA or cephalosporin C has not been observed yet. As shown in Figure 5A, the overall structure of EstSJ is represented as having two domains, out of which one domain contains the catalytic triad (Ser186-Asp354-His357), which is similar to BH1115, a rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase, which also belongs to the CE12 family from B. halodurans (Navarro-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008). This domain was composed of five \u03b2-strands surrounded by \u03b1-helices in an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 sandwich fold. At the same time, SAVES v6.0 was used to evaluate the model. The Ramachandran plot shows that 92.5% of amino acids fall in the most favorable area (Supplementary Figure 3), indicating that the modeled EstSJ was of acceptable quality. Structural comparisons of modeled EstSJ and YXIM also revealed that their catalytic triads (Ser186-Asp354-His357) matched together (Figure 5B). To verify whether Ser186-Asp354-His357 was composed of the catalytic triad of EstSJ, E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells containing pACYCDuet-1/EstSJSer186A, pACYCDuet-1/EstSJAsp354A, and pACYCDuet-1/EstSJHis357A were separately constructed, and the EstSJSer186A, EstSJAsp354A, and EstSJHis357A mutants were heterologously overproduced and purified (Supplementary Figure 4A). As shown in Supplementary Table 2, EstSJ lost almost all of its original activity after Ser186, Asp354, and His357 were substituted with A, respectively, indicating that Ser186-Asp354-His357 composed the catalytic triad of EstSJ."

            "text": "Deacetylation of cephalosporins and other important esters, such as tertiary acetate esters, catalyzed by EstSJ and its three mutants (EstSJSer186A, EstSJAsp354A, and EstSJHis357A) was determined. In the pharmaceutical chemistry, tertiary alcohols, which are mainly obtained through the enzymatic hydrolysis of tertiary acetate esters, are critical building blocks. Therefore,\nactivities of EstSJ toward tert-butyl acetate, linalyl acetate, glyceryl tributyrate, glyceryl trioleate, and terpinyl acetate were investigated. The release of acetic acid could be monitored by observing a color change from blue to yellow using a pH indicator-based colorimetric assay. Unfortunately, no color change was monitored, indicating that EstSJ displayed no activity on the above esters (data not shown). As shown in Supplementary Figure 5, EstSJ was active on 7-ACA, cefotaxime acid, and cephalothin sodium and no activity was detected on cefuroxime acid. The microTOF-Q II analysis was used to further characterize the deacetylating product of 7-ACA by purified EstSJ. As shown in Figure 6, a peak with m/z 295.0784 [M + Na]+ in the control without EstSJ (Figure 6A), and the deacetylated derivative D-7-ACA with m/z 253.0677 [M + Na]+ in the reaction with EstSJ were detected (Figure 6B). In addition, the deacetylase activity of EstSJ toward 7-ACA was determined as 4.50 U mg\u22121, with Km and Kcat/Km values being 25.66 \u00b1 5.55 mM and 2.98 S\u22121 mM\u22121, respectively. Meanwhile, no obvious activity was detected for EstSJSer186A and EstSJHis357A, and the activity of EstSJAsp354A on 7-ACA was 1.03 U mg\u22121, which also supports the result observed in Supplementary Figure 5. Combined with all the results mentioned above, a reaction mode of 7-ACA catalyzed by EstSJ was proposed (Figure 6C).\nTo better elucidate the binding and catalytic mechanisms of EstSJ on substrate 7-ACA, a molecular docking analysis of the receptor (EstSJ) and ligand (7-ACA) was performed. The results showed that the ligand 7-ACA was located, beside the active residues Ser186, Asp354, and His357, in the cavity (Figure 5C) and interacted with other amino acid residues, namely, Asn259, Arg295, Thr355, and Leu356 (Figures 5C\u2013F). To investigate their functions, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing pACYCDuet-1/EstSJAsn259A, pACYCDuet-1/EstSJArg295A, pACY CDuet-1/EstSJThr355A, and pACYCDuet-1/EstSJLeu356A plasmids were constructed separately, and the N-terminal His6-tagged EstSJAsn259A, EstSJArg295A, EstSJThr355A, and EstSJLeu356A mutants were heterologously overproduced and purified (Supplementary Figure 4B), following which the activities and kinetic parameters on 7-ACA were determined. As shown in Table 1, activities of EstSJAsn259A, EstSJArg295A, EstSJThr355A, and EstSJLeu356A mutants were approximately 1.44, 1.06, 1.66, and 0.63 U mg\u22121, which were about 32, 23.6, 36.9, and 14% of the original activity of the wild-type EstSJ. These results suggested that these amino acid residues might be involved in 7-ACA binding. Although 7-ACA is a crucial intermediate for synthesizing industrial cephalosporin antibiotics, its continuous production and uncontrolled use have led to their widespread presence in aquatic environments (Yu et al., 2017). More residues have been detected in animal tissues, treated sewage, surface water bodies, or hospital effluents which have caused immediate or potential threats to human and environmental safety (Chen et al., 2017). Currently, various methods, including chemical oxidation processes and biological treatments, are being developed to remove 7-ACA from wastewater. However, the products are usually more toxic than their parent compounds after being treated by chemical oxidation processes. On the other hand, the biological methods, especially bacterial communities, caused a significant impact on the removal of 7-ACA, and enzymatic activities of hydrolysis were environment friendly and cost-effective (Hu et al., 2020). Therefore, functional 7-ACA acetylesterases,\nFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org\nincluding EstSJ, might also be used for environmental 7-ACA bioremediation."

            "text": "In this study, an acetylesterase, EstSJ, a new member of the CE12 family, was identified and characterized. EstSJ prefers shortchain acyl esters from p-NPC2 to p-NPC6 and acquires its highest activity at 30\u25e6C and pH 8.0. EstSJ can remove the 3\u2032 acetyl group from 7-ACA to generate deacetylated 7-ACA, which is a critical intermediate in the industry for synthesizing new types of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Meanwhile, EstSJ is an SGNH family esterase with a typical N-terminal GDS(X) motif and this study will also broaden our general understanding of esterases from the SGNH superfamily. In future, protein engineering technologies, namely, directed evolution and protein rational/semirational design, might be used together to improve the deacetylation activity of esterases against 7-ACA."
