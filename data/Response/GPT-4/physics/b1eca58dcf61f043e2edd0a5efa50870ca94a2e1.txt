Extension of ROSPAC to Multiple-Nuclei Systems: Investigating the effectiveness of the ROSPAC sequence in multi-nuclei systems beyond the proton (1H) and carbon (13C) examples provided. This would involve theoretical and experimental studies to assess decoupling efficiency and robustness in more complex systems, including those with multiple rare spins.

Integration with Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP): Exploring the integration of ROSPAC with Dynamic Nuclear Polarization techniques to enhance signal sensitivity in solid-state NMR. Research could focus on how ROSPAC affects the polarization transfer mechanisms and whether it can improve the efficiency of DNP-enhanced experiments.

Development of ROSPAC Variants for Low-Field NMR Systems: Designing and testing variations of the ROSPAC sequence tailored for use in low-field NMR spectrometers. Given the growing interest in affordable, low-field instruments, adapting ROSPAC for such systems could make advanced decoupling techniques more accessible.

Machine Learning Optimization of ROSPAC Parameters: Employing machine learning algorithms to optimize the ROSPAC sequence parameters for different experimental conditions and sample types. This approach could lead to automated, adaptive NMR experiments that maximize decoupling efficiency and data quality.

Long-Term Stability and Reproducibility Studies: Conducting long-term studies to assess the stability and reproducibility of the ROSPAC sequence across different spectrometer setups and sample conditions. This research could include the development of standardized protocols for ROSPAC implementation to ensure consistency in results across the NMR community.
