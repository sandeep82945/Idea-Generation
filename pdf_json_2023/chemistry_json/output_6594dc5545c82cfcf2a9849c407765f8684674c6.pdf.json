            "text": "Diseases caused by bacterial infections are one of the major problems affecting human health worldwide.1,2 The discovery of antibiotics has reduced the mortality rate of bacterial infections. However, bacteria have a short reproductive cycle and are prone to rapid mutation. Some of them are becoming resistant to antibiotics.3,4 In addition, the abuse of antibiotics aggravates the development of drug resistance in bacteria.5\u20138 The main solution to this problem is to constantly improve conventional antibiotic molecules to produce various new antibiotic derivatives, but it is still hard to meet the need for eliminating resistant bacteria.9 Furthermore, some organic antibacterial agents, which have been used to solve the problem of bacterial resistance, also face problems in terms of biosafety and stability.10\u201312 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new antibacterial strategies to address the problem of drug resistance in bacteria.\nNanozymes are a class of nanomaterials with enzyme-like catalytic activity.13,14 The unique advantages of nanozymes as antibacterial agents include low cost, versatility, good stability,\neering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou\nu.cn anslational Medicine, School of Medicine, ina.

MnO2, as a nanozyme with multi-enzymemimicking activities, can generate high-intensity ROS to cut off the nucleic acid, make the protein inactive, and degrade a variety of molecules in bacteria, thus exhibiting good potential for application in killing bacteria.27,28 In terms of POD-like activity, the antibacterial capacity is based on the catalytic reaction between MnO2 and H2O2. However, the deciency of endogenous H2O2 and the instability of exogenous H2O2 make the POD-like activity-dependent antibacterial strategy fail easily. So, how to improve the antibacterial ability of MnO2 is worth investigating. The OXD mimetic enzyme does not require the addition of H2O2 to produce ROS for bacterial inhibition. So, the construction of MnO2 nanostructures with good OXD catalytic activity is very important. In addition, drug combination is a common clinical treatment protocol for anti-infection therapy. Inspired by this, we here try to integrate catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy.29,30\nCurrently, varieties of photothermal agents have been reported for bacterial inhibition, among which MXenes are an emerging class of two-dimensional layered materials with excellent photothermal properties.31\u201334 Among the different\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In the absence of light, the sterilization efficiency decreased dramatically. So how to achieve long-term sterilization is a problem. Therefore, if Ti3C2Tx could be combined with other materials, such as nanozymes, to achieve a synergistic effect of multiple functions, a good sterilization effect should be achieved.\nBased on the above, we prepared Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 composites with high OXD-like activity and photothermal conversion ability for efficient bacterial inhibition. The MnO2 in Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 is capable of exerting a variety of mimetic enzyme properties. Specically, their high OXD-like activity can be utilized directly for bacterial inhibition without the addition of H2O2.36\u201338 At the same time, the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of Ti3C2Tx can greatly improve the sterilization efficiency. Therefore, we could establish a catalytic-photothermal synergistic antibacterial system using nanozymes and Ti3C2Tx to develop highly and enduringly efficient antibacterial agents."

For the solid medium, 2% agar was added. Aer autoclaving, it was used on an ultra-clean workbench in time to make culture plates. Aer solidication and drying, these plates were placed in a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator for storage. Before the experiment, the workbench was sterilized by UV light irradiation for 30 min. According to the planned time, the bacterial liquid was inoculated in advance, then transferred according to a ratio of 1 : 100, and continued to be incubated at a constant temperature at 37 \u00b0C in a shaker for about 3 hours.

            "text": "Characterization of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2\nIn order to synthesize the Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 composites a two-step synthesis process was used. First, the etched Ti3C2Tx was added into dopamine hydrochloride to form a layer of polydopamine (PDA) on its surface. Secondly, KMnO4 was added to synthesize Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 using the redox reaction between PDA and KMnO4, as shown in Scheme 1.\nDetailed characterization studies of Ti3C2Tx@PDA and Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 were carried out to investigate the surface morphology and composition. The presence of N elements in addition to Ti and C elements as shown in Fig. S1a\u2020 is evidence of PDA loading on the Ti3C2Tx surface. The zeta potential (Fig. S1b\u2020) of Ti3C2Tx was negatively charged (\u221231.27 mV). Aer loading of PDA, the zeta potential was increased to\u221225.57 mV.39 From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) patterns shown in Fig. S2,\u2020 it was seen that the formation of PDA on the surface did not change the morphology of Ti3C2Tx, which remained as a layered structure. Aer the addition of KMnO4, Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 was obtained. The SEM and TEM patterns demonstrate that the morphology of the sample as shown in Fig. 1a and b is homogeneous. And the akes of MnO2 grew on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. In contrast, the S1 and S3 samples were not so inhomogeneous as shown in Fig. S2 and S3.\u2020 The S1 sample is shown as bare Ti3C2Tx, where no akes were found on its surface; while the S3 sample has excessive MnO2 akes. As shown in Fig. 1c, the 0.420 and 0.276 nm lattice distances in the HRTEM image could correspond to the (101) and (301) crystal planes of MnO2, respectively, proving that the product is MnO2.\nIn order to investigate the crystal structure of the materials, S0 and S2 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1d). In the XRD pattern of the S0 sample, the disappeared peak located at 39\u00b0 in the XRD spectrum of Ti3AlC2 (JCPDS No. 52-0875) proves the successful etching of Ti3C2Tx.40 The S2 sample has no obvious broad peak. And Ti, C, Mn, and O\nScheme 1 Schematic diagram of the preparation of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 com\n2218 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2216\u20132225\nelements are uniformly distributed (Fig. 1e\u2013i). This further proves the formation of MnO2. In addition, the disappearance of the N element also indicates that the PDA supported on the Ti3C2Tx surface had been completely consumed. To further determine the composition of this material, the sample was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 1j\u2013m). From the full spectrum, it can be found that the material contains the elements Ti, C, O, and Mn. The N element was eliminated during the synthesis of MnO2 (disappearance of the N peak), and the element contents shown in Table S1\u2020 further concluded that PDA was completely consumed. The O 1s spectrum of S2 can be split into three characteristic peaks. The low-binding energy O peak (blue line) at 531.5 eV corresponds to Mn\u2013OH bonds, and the high-binding energy O peak (red line) at 530.2 eV could be assigned to Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn. The H\u2013O\u2013H peak at 532.7 eV appeared from adsorbed water molecules. The loading of MnO2 nanosheets on Ti3C2Tx provided active centers and reaction sites to improve the catalytic performance. The Mn 2p spectrum with a separation spin energy of 11.7 eV (as shown in Fig. 1l), where Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 are located at 642.4 and 654.1 eV, conrms the formation of MnO2.41,42 This could also be proved by the separation spin energy of 4.8 eV of two characteristic peaks at 84.3 and 89.1 eV in the spectrum of Mn 3s shown in Fig. 1m. Furthermore, the binding energies of 282.2, 284.8, 286.3, and 288.5 eV can be attributed to C\u2013Ti, C\u2013C, C\u2013O, and C]O bonds based on the high-resolution spectra of C 1s. In the Ti 2p spectra (Fig. S4a and b\u2020), the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of Ti3+ appeared at 458.8 and 464.6 eV. In addition to this, Ti\u2013C with 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks appeared at 456 and 461.3 eV, respectively, indicating that the composite retains the structure of Ti3C2Tx.43 The specic surface areas of the four materials analyzed by nitrogen adsorption and desorption (Fig. S4c\u2020) were 10.02, 27.52, 112.53, and 102.38 m2 g\u22121, respectively (Table S2\u2020). The S2 sample has the largest specic surface area, which indicates that the material has more active sites susceptible to catalysis.\nEnzyme-like catalytic activity of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2\nAccording to previous reports,44\u201346 MnO2 exhibits OXD-like activity.

There is a clear characteristic absorption peak at 652 nm as shown in Fig. 2a accompanied by a color change to blue in the presence of O2. S1 exhibits relatively low OXD-like activity at 652 nm.

The variation of absorbance with time for the different nanozymes (Fig. S5a\u2020) also demonstrates the excellent enzyme mimicking activity of S2.

Furthermore, the maximum specic surface area of S2 as shown in Fig. S3c\u2020 further supports this result.\nIn addition to OXD-like activity, the prepared material also exhibits valid POD-like enzyme mimetic activity. The POD-like activity was assessed by catalytic TMB oxidation in the presence of H2O2 as a model reaction with a characteristic absorption peak at 652 nm accompanied by a change in colour to blue. As shown in Fig. 2c, the characteristic absorption peak at 652 nm indicates that the composite has signicant POD-like activity. Similar to the OXD-like activity, S2 had better POD-like activity (Fig. S5b and d\u2020). The Michaelis\u2013Menten curves for S1, S2, and S3 are shown in Fig. 2d. In Table S4,\u2020 the Vmax/Km values of the S2 sample are higher than those of other samples, which also indicates that S2 has higher peroxidase-like activity. In addition, pure Ti3C2Tx did not show any OXD-like activity and POD-like activity at 652 nm, thus demonstrating that the catalytic activity was mainly provided by MnO2.\nPhotothermal properties of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2\nThe inhibition of bacteria by catalytic production of ROS alone is oen not satisfactory, so photothermy is introduced here to achieve synergistic antibacterial activity. The related literature has reported that Ti3C2Tx has good photothermal properties.49\u201351 Therefore, the photothermal conversion properties of the composites were investigated. The Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 samples were irradiated using an 808 nmNIR laser with a power density of 2.0 W cm\u22122, and the photothermal conversion performance, as well as the stability performance were studied\nFig. 3 (a) Temperature rise curves for H2O, S0 and different ratios o temperature rise profiles of different concentrations of S2 solution under different powers of NIR light irradiation for S2; (d) stability performance of (e) temperature change of the solution after 600 s of photothermal action switch-off; (f) negative natural logarithm (\u2212ln q) of the cooling time curv\n2220 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2216\u20132225\n(Fig. 3). Fig. 3a shows the temperature rise curves for H2O, 250 mg mL\u22121 of S0, S1, S2, and S3 solutions. The temperatures of the sample solutions increased by 0.7 \u00b0C, 23.2 \u00b0C, 22.6 \u00b0C, 24.6 \u00b0C, and 20.7 \u00b0C, respectively. Aer 10 min of NIR light irradiation, S2 showed better photothermal conversion performance than other materials. It has been reported that as MnO2 increases, the temperature of the system increases as well.52,53 The small difference between the increasing temperatures of S0 and S1 indicates that loading a certain amount of MnO2 on the Ti3C2Tx surface is more conducive to the improvement of photothermal conversion properties. However, there is a slight decrease in the temperature rise of S3, which is due to the excessive amount of MnO2, making it difficult for Ti3C2Tx to exert the effect of photothermal conversion. The optimum conditions for the concentration of the materials were explored (Fig. 3b). When the concentration was 50 and 150 mg mL\u22121, the temperature increased by 5.3 \u00b0C and 12.8 \u00b0C, respectively. In contrast, at a concentration of 250 mg mL\u22121, the temperature was able to increase by 24.6 \u00b0C. When the concentration was increased to 300 mgmL\u22121, the temperature rise did not increase toomuch, so a concentration of 250 mg mL\u22121 was chosen as the study concentration. And the investigation of power effects as shown in Fig. 3c yielded an optimum power of 2.0 W cm\u22122. In addition, at the same concentration, the stability performance of S2 solution was studied as shown in Fig. 3d. Aer three on/off irradiations, the S2 solution still maintained high photothermal conversion abilities. The photothermal conversion efficiency was measured by Roper's method. The relevant calculations were obtained as shown in Fig. 3e and f. The photothermal conversion efficiency (h) was 65.97%. The above results further demonstrate that S2 can efficiently and rapidly convert light to heat, and this property can be used in antibacterial applications.\nf Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 under NIR light (808 nm, 2 W cm\n\u22122) irradiation; (b)\nNIR light (808 nm, 2 W cm\u22122) irradiation; (c) temperature rise profiles of\nS2 under NIR light irradiation in the cycling stability performance graph;\nof S2 under 808 nm NIR light irradiation followed by 600 s of NIR light\ne of S2 after 600 s; the sample concentration was 250 mg mL\u22121.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

According to the reported results,54 it has been shown that the bacteria can also be inhibited by the photothermal conversion capability of Ti3C2Tx. Therefore, a catalytic-photothermal synergistic bacterial inhibition system was constructed. Herein, 808 nm irradiation was chosen to assess the inhibition performance of S2 using a plate counting method. First, the inhibition of S0, S1, S2, and S3 under acidic conditions was investigated in vitro. By comparing the bacterial survival of Gram-positive (E. coli) and Gram-negative (S. aureus) bacteria (Fig. 4), we concluded that S2 was the most effective in inhibiting bacteria. Next, the effect of the concentration and incubation time of the material on the inhibition of E. coli was studied. As can be seen in Fig. S6a and b,\u2020 the viability of the bacteria gradually decreased as the concentration of the material and the incubation time increased, indicating that the inhibition effect of S2 was concentration and time-dependent. In summary, we chose a concentration of 250 mg mL\u22121 and an incubation time of 30 minutes as the study conditions. As shown in Fig. S6c and d,\u2020 the inhibition effect of S2 on E. coli was related to the power and irradiation time of the NIR laser. As can be seen from Fig. S6c\u2020 the survival rate of E. coli decreased gradually with the increase of laser power, and the bacterial viability decreased signicantly at 2.0 W cm\u22122. And when the power increased to 3.0 W cm\u22122, the decrease in bacterial viability was not signicant. As shown in Fig. S6d,\u2020 the survival rate of E. coli gradually decreased when the light exposure was extended. The bacterial viability of E. coli decreased signicantly when the light time reached 8 minutes, which is better than lighting for 6 minutes. If the light time was extended for 10 minutes, the effect was not signicantly improved. Therefore, good photothermal conversion performance can achieve a certain antibacterial effect, but photothermal therapy is affected by its power and irradiation time. Low light power and short-duration lighting do not achieve a good antibacterial effect. So, in order to avoid too high a power or too long a light time leading to healthy tissue damage, a NIR\nFig. 4 (a and b) Bacterial survival of E. coli and S. aureus after incubation 250 mg mL\u22121; the reaction time was 30 minutes. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, a\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nlaser irradiation power of 2.0 W cm\u22122 and an irradiation time of 8 minutes were chosen for the following experiments. Similarly, the analysis in Fig. S6e\u2013h\u2020 shows that for S. aureus, a concentration of 250 mg mL\u22121, an incubation time of 30 minutes, a NIR laser power of 2.0 W cm\u22122, and an irradiation time of 10 minutes were used to achieve high bacterial inhibition.\nDetection of bacterial ROS induced by Ti3C2Tx/MnO2\nBased on the fact that the antibacterial mechanism of the mimetic enzyme with OXD-like activity is attributed to the ROS generated during the catalytic reaction, we examined the ROS levels in S0 and S2. The ROS levels of the bacteria in the different treatment groups were subsequently measured using DCFH. The uorescence intensity shown in Fig. 5 reects the level of ROS in the bacterial system. In the case of S. aureus, the uorescence intensity of the S2-treated group was increased compared with that of the control and S0-treated groups. Similar results were obtained for E. coli and MRSA. Therefore, ROS production in the system via catalytic production of mimetic OXD activity is a factor contributing to bacterial mortality.\nAntibacterial effect of Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 with and without NIR light\nThe irradiation effect on bacterial inhibition of S2 for E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA was also studied. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, S0 and S2 showed a slight reduction in bacterial viability (<\u22120.63 lg) because S2 had OXD-like activity to produce ROS to inhibit bacterial viability. The bacterial inhibition effect was signicantly enhanced by the involvement of NIR. When E. coli was treated with S0 + laser for 8 minutes, the bacteria decreased by \u22121.62 lg. The antibacterial efficiency of S2 + laser was decreased signicantly by \u22123.82 lg. The photographs of the bacteria colonies shown in Fig. 6a clearly showed that S2 + laser had the optimal antibacterial effect. On the one hand, the improvement in antibacterial performance is due to the synergistic effect of photothermy and nanozyme catalysis. On the other hand, the photothermal effect will also improve the performance of nanozyme catalysis and further kill bacteria.55,56 S. aureus (Fig. 6b) was reduced by \u22120.77 lg and \u22121.93 lg for S0 and S2 without the laser, and the bacteria were signicantly reduced by\nwith S0, S1, S2 and S3 under acidic conditions; the concentration was nd ***p < 0.001.\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2216\u20132225 | 2221\nFig. 5 The fluorescence signal of E. coli (a), S. aureus (b) and MRSA (c) after treatment with S0 and S2; **p < 0.01.\nFig. 6 (a\u2013c) Survival of bacteria after incubation with S0 and S2 with and without NIR light (808 nm; 2 W cm\u22122) for E. coli (8 min), S. aureus and MRSA (10min); (d\u2013f) photographs of bacterial colonies; incubation time was 30min; the sample concentration was 250 mgmL\u22121; **p < 0.01, and ****p < 0.0001.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

It is important to note that drugresistant bacteria are usually more difficult to kill in bacterial infections. In contrast, the material in this paper is equally effective against MRSA. As can be seen in Fig. 6c, S2 + laser inhibited the viability of MRSA effectively and \u22123.75 lg reduction was observed. The efficient bactericidal effect of S2 + laser is further illustrated by the photographs of the colonies in Fig. 6d\u2013f. These results suggest that S2-based catalytic-photothermal synergistic therapies have a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than monotherapies (single photothermal therapy or ROS therapy).\nWound healing by Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 in vivo\nTheir antibacterial properties in skin wound healing were assessed given their signicant inhibition of bacteria in vitro.\n2222 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 2216\u20132225\nThe S2 sample with the highest OXD-like activity was selected from the three samples as well as the carrier Ti3C2Tx as a control for the treatment of wound healing in infected mouse skin. First, an approximately 8 mm diameter circular wound was created on the back of each mouse. Then the wounds were infected with S. aureus for 24 h to establish the mouse infection model, and the mouse wounds were treated with S0, S2, S0 + laser, and S2 + laser, respectively. During the 12 days of treatment, we recorded the photographs of the wounds, the wound size, and the weight of each mouse. As shown in Fig. 7a, the wounds of the S2 + laser group had scarred rst, and the inammation had subsided. Moreover, the bacterial count from the wound on day 3 (shown in Fig. 7b) indicated that the S2 + laser could heal the wound effectively. The count of S. aureus at the wound site is shown in Fig. 7b.

And the S2 + laser showed mostly intact epidermal structures on day 12. Analysis of the wound area as shown in Fig. 7c showed that S2 was effective in reducing infectious inammation, mainly due to the OXD-like activity of S2. Wound healing was further accelerated under photothermal action. In comparison, the control, S0, S0 + laser and S2 groups showed wound closure rates of approximately 57%, 52%, 45% and 41% respectively (Fig. 7c). In addition, there was a signicant upward trend in the body weight of the mice as the treatment effect improved (Fig. 7d), reecting the good in vivo biocompatibility of S0 and S2. Hematoxylin\u2013Eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe the wound tissue (Fig. 7e). In comparison with the control group, a large number of broblasts could be observed in the treated group, which presumes that the infected wound was recovering. The above results indicate that S2 showed optimal wound healing with the synergistic effect of NIR light.\nTo further illustrate the good wound healing effect of S2, all mice were sacriced on day 12.

As shown in the H&E-stained images of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys, no signicant damage was observed in the major organs. This indicates that S0 and S2 were not signicantly toxic (Fig. S7a\u2020). In addition, the survival of L02 cells aer incubation with S0 and S2 nanoparticles was determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay as shown in Fig. S7b,\u2020 also demonstrating the good in vivo compatibility of these two materials. In summary, S2 was effective in ghting bacterial infections and promoting wound healing, because S2 acts as a novel bacteriostatic agent by exerting its excellent OXD-like activity and photothermal properties."
