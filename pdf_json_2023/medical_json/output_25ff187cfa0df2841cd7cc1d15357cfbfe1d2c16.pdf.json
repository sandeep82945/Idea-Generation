    "abstractText": "The protection of natural forests as the major land-based biotic sink of carbon is regarded as a priority for climate action, and zero deforestation is an accepted global imperative. Sustainable intensification of plantation forestry will be essential to meet escalating, shifting, and diversifying demand for forest products if logging pressure on natural forests is to be decreased. Substitution strategies involves enhanced offtake from plantation forestry into long life-cycle products, opening up new options for mediumto long-term carbon drawdown, downstream decarbonization, and fossil fuel displacement in the construction and chemicals sectors. However, under current plantation productivity levels, it has been projected that by 2050, supply could provide as little as 35% of demand. This could be further exacerbated by climate change. To mitigate this shortfall, to avoid ensuing catastrophic logging pressure on natural forests, and to ensure that downstream decarbonization and fossil fuel substitution strategies are feasible, a dramatic step change in plantation productivity is required. This is particularly necessary in developing countries where increases in per capita demand and pressure on natural forests will be the most acute.",

Sustainable intensification of plantation forestry will be essential to meet escalating, shifting, and diversifying demand for forest products if logging pressure on natural forests is to be decreased. Substitution strategies involves enhanced offtake from plantation forestry into long life-cycle products, opening up new options for medium- to long-term carbon drawdown, downstream decarbonization, and fossil fuel displacement in the construction and chemicals sectors. However, under current plantation productivity levels, it has been projected that by 2050, supply could provide as little as 35% of demand. This could be further exacerbated by climate change. To mitigate this shortfall, to avoid ensuing catastrophic logging pressure on natural forests, and to ensure that downstream decarbonization and fossil fuel substitution strategies are feasible, a dramatic step change in plantation productivity is required. This is particularly necessary in developing countries where increases in per capita demand and pressure on natural forests will be the most acute.\nOver the last 20 years, gene modification,gene editing, and genomics approaches for yield enhancement and yield protection have been developed for eucalyptus, one of the most significant plantation species globally. Thiswork delivers positive insights for carbon drawdown and for driving climate changemitigation, adaptation, and resilience strategies. We present here a snapshot of our experience to date in Brazil of genetically modified eucalyptus enhanced for greater yield (carbon drawdown), and photorespiratory bypass (climate adaptation). In parallel, we have developed a robust governance frame-\nworkbasedonanumberof ethical principles and practical precautionary steps, including global dialogue and technology sharing. Here we describe possible ways forward to explore carbon drawdown at scale and climate resilience through field experimentation and discuss the potential future impact of these approaches. One of our primary objectives is to use landscape-level experimentation as a platform for global dialogue to create a new narrative around biotech plantations on the governance required to unlock technologies for the benefit of climate change mitigation, biodiversity, and equality.\nEditors: Daniel Drell, L.

            "text": "As demand for food, fiber, and fuel increases, woodharvestingwill triple by2050 to\u223c10billion m3 per annum, which would require a doubling of the existing plantation area: roughly 250 million ha of new plantations under existing productivity levels (World Wildlife Federation 2011). More recent estimates indicate that timber consumption for construction alone is predicted to triple from 2.2 billion m3 to 5.8 billion m3 in 2050, driven by urbanization and political commitments to decarbonization (Gresham House, greshamhouse.com/global-timber-outlook). Furthermore, over the last 20 years, the source of demand has changed radically. The developing world has overtaken the developed world, growing from 770 million m3 in 1998 to 1.2 billion m3 in 2018, with China leading this shift as a result of population growth and urbanization. Wood consumption is tightly linked to population growth; with a further 800 million people expected by 2050\u2014two-thirds of which will be inAfrica\u2014this trendwill accelerate.However, today, the vast majority of timber (74%) is produced in the global North (United States, Canada, Europe, Russia). The only solution to avert massive deforestation in the global South is therefore significant upscaling of local production capacity. For some countries, this means starting organized forestry operations from an almost zero base. This was recently underlined by SirDavidAttenborough, describing the use of more wood as \u201can extraordinary renewable resource\u201d for growing populations\u2014\u201cOn their own, natural forests cannot provide all the wood we need so we also have to farm trees like any other crop and create a new generation of plantations\u201d (Attenborough 2020).\nHowever, this forecasted rise in timber demand is set against a constrained supply fixed by the long-term growth rate of the trees, limited land area, climate change, and an uncertain in-\nvestment scenario. Current forecasts for longterm timber supply between nowand 2050 range between 3.7 billion m3 and 4.7 billion m3, representingaconsiderable shortfall.TheInternational Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO, www .itto.int) estimates even greater shortfall caused by inadequate plantation expansion globally. The total area of industrial fast-growing forest plantations in 2012 was 54.3 million ha and this area will increase to 91 million ha by 2050, satisfying only 35% of total industrial wood requirements (ITTO 2020).\nAddressing this projected deficit places considerable pressure on the global forest sector to dramatically increase productivity while reducing logging pressure on natural forests and also scaling up landscape restoration activities (IUCN 2009). Global momentum to decarbonize economies is expected to further accelerate timber consumption, as wood is increasingly seen as a clean and low carbon alternative to fossil fuel and carbon intensive inputs (European Commission 2020). Furthermore, increased fire risk, increased amplitude, and duration of pest and disease cycles, water constraints, and impaired photosynthesis as a result of climate changewill require thedevelopment anddeployment of new and effective mitigation strategies that increase productivity at scale and on time."

Under appropriate landscape-level zoning, local community consultation, and the appropriate genetics, plantations can produce more wood on less land than natural forest, and could thus spare land for other uses (newgenerationplanta tions.org). Estimates underline that while tree plantations comprise only 7% of total forest area, they provide 50% of industrial roundwood (Jagels 2006).Of these, themostproductiveplantations\u2014intensively managed planted forests (IMPFs)\u2014cover only 0.2% of global land area\n2 Advanced Online Article.

Further intensification is, however, needed to mitigate projected supply deficits, and is entirely feasible since in many regions, plantationsarenotmanagedat theiroptimalproductivity. Tripling the yield and harvest of planted forests from 800 million m3 from 7% of the world\u2019s forests to 2.7 billion m3 from 11% of the world\u2019s forests would create savings of 2.35 Gt CO2/yr and a net gain of 1.5 Gt CO2/yr (Flores Carre\u00f1o et al. 2012). Improving and protecting yields of planted forests would be achieved \u201cthrough genetic improvements that emphasize a mix of plant traits (drought tolerance, insect resistance, product characteristics) and adaptation to different forest types and locations\u201d (Flores Carre\u00f1o et al. 2012).\nFast-growing eucalyptus plantations have many of the characteristics required to meet part of this supply gap. While the eucalyptus commercial plantation area represents only \u223c0.5% of the world\u2019s forest cover (25 million ha globally [FAO2020]), it accounts for\u223c10%of the global roundwood demand. Brazil is the world\u2019s largest eucalyptus grower (22%) (followed by China [20%] and India [17%]) (Wen et al. 2018), with 7.6 million ha, constituting \u223c7% of Brazil\u2019s GDP (IB\u00c1 2022).\nBrazil, more importantly, is by far the leader in productivity, with an average mass accumulation of 40 m3ha\u22121yr\u22121, resulting from a decades-long history of investment in breeding and improvements in silvicultural practices. This has created a diverse clonal base of varieties that are adaptable tomany biomes and relatively tolerant to biotic and abiotic stress (da Silva et al. 2013; Ramantswana et al. 2020). Long-term studies have demonstrated that the eucalyptus plantations are sustainable, and very efficient at capturing CO2 (240 tons of CO2 per ha over a 7-year rotation (IB\u00c1 2022). Furthermore, under the norms of the Brazilian Forest Code, landowners may only establish plantations on degraded land and must commit between 20% and 50% of their land to native forest renewal, making this industry one of the global leaders in degraded land restoration (Grossberg 2009; Sembiring et al. 2020; Coelho et al. 2022)."

In addition, some traits cannotbecreated throughconventional breeding (such as insect resistance or modified wood properties), and for some traits, such as climate resilience, conventional breeding time lines are too long. If enhancing plantation productivity requires a continued emphasis on raising technical efficiency, then genetic modification (GM) could be part of this solution. Since 2006,FuturaGenehasbeenintegratingGMwithin conventional breeding programs, affording the potential to enhance and protect yield, to modify wood properties for diverse offtakes, and to prepare for climate change while using less land and resources and reduce chemical loads. This approachholdsgreatpromise forenabling theessential stepchange inproductivityand intensification of existing practices for closing the supply gap.

A scientific and operational framework to ensure all projects provide solutions that enable not only the transformation of the economic values of forestry but also create social shared values and environmental renewal and resilience; and\n2.

This framework would be implemented through commitments to ensure transparency, stewardship, and traceable good practices within all operations; stimulate long-term, outcomeoriented, local and global, inclusive dialogues on tree biotechnology; promote technology transfer for humanitarian or environmental purposes; align all initiatives withopportunities to sharebenefitswithoutgrowers (contracted small-holder farmers); and implement abioethics advisory committee to identify anddefine technical, scientific, and bioethical questions about the social, environmental, economic, and legal aspects of biotechnology and its applications.\nThese commitments create the potential for community empowerment, resilience, and entrepreneurism at a local level, and globally through sharing our technologies free of charge to public sector research institutes working on the improvement of subsistence crops for food security or institutes developing strategies for safeguarding forest health. To date, we have shared our technologies with the Donald Danforth Center to improve subsistence crops (Ven-\nkata et al. 2020); we have provided a eucalyptus research clone and genetic transformation protocols to a research consortium based at Oregon State University; and we have put the most advanced eucalyptus genome data into the public domain to advance public research (FuturaGene, www.futuragene.com/shared-value). Furthermore, during in-licensing of key technologies, we ensure that smallholder outgrowers of Suzano have access to technologies free of any royalty charges.\nWe describe here three approaches to scaleup and expand our programs to reframe global thinking on carbon drawdown, closing the supply gap, climate resilience, and to reframe critical questions regarding the relevance of tree biotechnology for society and the environment."

The event was approved for commercial use by the CTNBio in April 2015 (Nature Biotechnology 2015).\nOur field experiments to date have yielded a large body of evidence on biosafety and performance criteria that demonstrates that our transgenic approach delivers substantial yield enhancement in different genetic (G) backgrounds in different environments (E).

The gains from the geneticallymodified yield enhanced eucalyptus event in specific biomes can represent up to almost half of the entire yield gain achieved over the last 40 years of conventional breeding. Thus, our yield-enhancing technologyoffersthepotential tochange theparadigm of yield enhancement and directly address the yield gap.\nCurrently, more than 6million ha are planted with eucalyptus inBrazil alone.Newplantings are only permittedondegraded pastureland,which is a very poor carbon sink. Data from the IB\u00c1 (the BrazilianTreeAssociation) indicates that conventional eucalyptus may sequester 240 tons of CO2 per ha over a 7-year rotation (IB\u00c1 2022). An average increase of 12% in yield would potentially push this to 270 tons of CO2 per ha.

            "text": "Even with significant advances in the form of clonal adaptations, improved management practices, soil preparation and fertilization, and pest and disease control, eucalyptus productivity in Brazil is strongly affected by climate variability (Binkley et al. 2017; Martins et al. 2022). Water deficits (Scolforo et al. 2019; Martins et al. 2022) and extreme temperatures outside of appropriate thresholds (from 8.5\u00b0C to\u223c40\u00b0C) (de Freitas and Bolzan Martins 2019) are the main causes of reduced eucalyptusproductivity inBrazil, and these impacts are expected to become more prevalent with climate change (Elli et al. 2020; Florencio et al. 2022). A series of approaches allow us to prepare for such an impact to provide varieties thatwill be able to performwell evenunder future adverse climate scenarios.\nOne approach that has already shown promise in other species (see Erb 2023) is to investigate ways to bypass photorespiration (Betti et al. 2016; South et al. 2018). During photosynthesis, the enzyme rubisco incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule during carbon fixation, but rubisco has a flaw: instead of using carbon dioxide as a sole substrate, it sometimes consumes oxygen, particularly under conditions of high light and high temperature. This side reaction triggers a process called photorespiration, which causes carbon dioxide to be lost rather than fixed. Photorespiration (also known as the oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle, photorespiratory cycle or C2 cycle) is a complex and energy-consuming set of reactions required to recycle 2-phosphoglycolate generated by the oxygenase reaction of rubisco (Betti et al. 2016). Photorespiration wastes energy, hampers primary metabolism and carbon fixation, and produces toxic byproducts that can impair crop productivity by as much as 50% under severe conditions such as elevated temperatures. Increased temperatures enhance photorespiration, and with the\nAdvanced Online Article. Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a041670 5\ncurrent global warming, the negative impact of photorespiration on yield loss will increase. Recent studies indicate that plant yield can be substantially improvedby the alteration of photorespiratory fluxes or by engineering artificial bypasses to photorespiration. To address these challenges and improve the sustainability of eucalyptus growth and cultivation, FuturaGene has developed a transgenic eucalyptus variety expressing a photorespiration bypass. The engineered photorespiration bypass would allow the transgenic eucalyptus to bemore effective in capturing CO2 and water, thus reducing the negative impact of photorespiration. Throughmonitoring gas-exchange parameters in the youngest fully expanded leaves, ourfindings show that the transgenic eucalyptus plants exhibit a significant increase in leaf photosynthetic capacity (measured as Amax under ambient conditions), ranging from 15% to 25% higher than nontransgenic plants.Moreover, we sought to investigatewhether the enhanced photosynthetic performance of the transgenic plants resulted in any phenotypic differences. Our experiments with eucalyptus trees grown in greenhouse conditions revealed that the transgenic lines had an increased growth rate and demonstrated an increased height of up to 15% compared to nontransgenic trees, with no change in stem diameter. Although our experiments are limited to greenhouse studies at this stage, we have demonstrated that eucalyptus engineered with photorespiration bypass results in enhanced growth and increased carbon assimilation compared with nontransgenic controls. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of photorespiratory bypass on plant metabolism and performance, we plan further studies to investigate the impact of this GM on eucalyptus primary metabolites, specifically carbohydrates and amino acid composition. In addition, we plan to evaluate the performance of the transgenic eucalyptus trees under drought conditions.\nThis research emphasizes the potential for transgenicmetabolic engineering to improve the sustainability and resilience of eucalyptus in the face of future climate change and to permit better strategies for forestry planning, silvicultural practices, and guiding effective adaptive mea-\nsures to cope with climate change threats, especially in regions facing water scarcity and high temperatures. Further research is required to fully understand the potential implications of this technology and its feasibility for commercial use. The next step is to take these experiments to the field to assess the impact of the bypass under different genetic and environmental combinations in different biomes in Brazil."

The approach has been to urge a discourse and collective reasoning on governance, and break the deadlock caused by decades of exchanges around risk.With a perspective of governance, it is possible to reframe what is essentially a \u201cwicked problem\u201d in terms of broader value for society and the environment. Our narrative has been framed on the premise that with limited scope for sustainable throughput of resources, ensuringwell-being within planetary boundaries, will require enhanced resource use efficiency while meeting growing and shifting demand. In practical terms, this requires stepchanges inproductivityandprocess efficiency and an expansion of the quality, scope, and scale of products and services, and that in turn means an increased dependence on scientificand technological innovation.Thequestion we have posed is: \u201cIf the only way to achieve natural resource use efficiency and produce more from less is to improve technical efficiency\u2014how can inclusive frameworks of governance for the development and deployment of scientific and technological innovation be established and implemented down to the local level?\u201d\nInpractical terms:\u201cHowcanresearchbeguided toward productivity challenges, how can its impact reach smallholders, and how can they use it to access newmarkets?\u201d\nOurGM tree policy is designed specifically to operationalize this ethic through sharing technology with small producers in Brazil, sharing technology free of charge to public sector research institutes for humanitarian and environmental objectives (Venkataetal. 2020;FuturaGene2023), and the establishment of a bioethics advisory committee to oversee the entire program.\nWe have made some progress in creating awareness around positive narratives, but further progress at scale and on time is essential. The large-scale field experiments we propose to assess carbon drawdown and yield enhancement provide a unique opportunity to expand and enrich this dialogue.Becauseof the scaleof this approach and its novelty and relevance to the global debate on different approaches to carbon drawdown, we\nplan toopen thefield experiments as a global platform for dialoguewith theparticipationof the key institutions leading the global carbon drawdown and decarbonization discussions and key downstream industries through a series of workshops, trainings, and debates in situ. Such interactions would allow decision makers to see first-hand how carbon drawdown would work in practice. This would fill an important gap in the global \u201ccarbon drawdown\u201d debate framed in the context of \u201cwhat do real-life solutions actually look like?\u201d Theprogramwouldalso involvefieldvisits toprotected forests, visits with local communities and social programs\u2014andwouldbuild awareness that high-techplantation forestry is anecessaryoption for development.\nWorkshops based on real-life experiences framed around critical discussion themes in situ would help bridge many current gaps in thought leadership andwould provide a fact-based vehicle for introducing the role of tree biotechnology into global thinking. A critical objective will be to establish key facts on plantation management, to create awareness that well-placed and well-managedplantations can be an asset for local communitywell-being,biodiversity conservation, ecological health, and commercial benefit.\nThe Brazilian context in which our work evolves is unique in the world and offers a vision of how plantation forestry can provide a strong vehicle for rural development, biodiversity conservation,economicgrowth,andecologicalregeneration (IB\u00c1 2022). By changing the content and direction of debate around the role of biotech forestry in carbon drawdown and the potential to narrow the supply gap at scale and on time, a new vision for plantation-based solutions for sustainability and developmental issues could emerge.

To date, however, the institutional arrangements established since the Earth Summit in 1992 have struggled to manage the complexity of these demands: overshoot of natural resource consumption, inequality, anddegradationcontinuedespite global commitments to create a low-carbon, inclusive,andjust trajectoryforglobaldevelopment. The UN 2030 Agenda of Sustainable DevelopmentGoals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, was already off-target across many indicators within years of its inception (World Economic Forum 2021); most indicators for preventing excessivewarming areoff-target (WorldResources Institute2021). In the interim, the escalating imbalance betweenhuman activity and natural resource capacities will continue. There is an obvious and disconcerting mismatch between the urgency with which the objectivesof ensuringwell-beingwithinplanetary boundaries and the time frames inwhichpractical transformative forest solutions can be delivered.

We know, however, that to achieve greater intensification of productivity, existingperformance standardsdesigned tomanage linear incremental change will not suffice. Future standards must be designed to manage the complexity of systemic transformational changes.\nAs proposed by Rockstr\u00f6m et al. (2017):\n\u2026 an explicit carbon roadmap for halving anthropogenic emissions every decade, codesigned by and for all industry sectors, could help promote disruptive, nonlinear technological advances toward a zero-emissions world. The key to such a roadmap will be a dual strategy that pushes innovative strategies up the creation and dissemination trajectory, while simultaneously pulling fossil-based value propositions from the market. Thus, the transformation unfolds at a pace governed by innovation rather than by inertia imposed by incumbent technologies.\nWhile the forestry sector could clearly play a pivotal role inclimatechangemitigationandinsucha carbonroadmap, thereality isthat the forest sector has little influence inglobal thought leadership. In thecontextof theUNSDGs, forestsare incorrectly framed inanarrowand restrictedperspective limited to biodiversity (sustainable forest management is mentioned only once in SDG 13). The globaldiscoursecannotbe limited to thebiodiversity area alone, otherwise the active management or restoration of forests will simply be invisible. A narrow interpretationof forestswithmost of their social and economic benefits and functions disregardedorunrecognizedgreatly limitsoptionsfora bioeconomy, climate resilience, decarbonization, and fossil fuel substitution and appropriate integration of their true socioeconomic value.\nPart of the underlying hesitancy to political endorsement of forestry in the climate agenda could lie in the fact that such an endorsement would require massive adoption of plantation forestry and, in particular, IMPFs. Given the fact that genetically engineered (GM) trees will play a growing role in yield enhancement and protection and in modification of feedstock chemistry (Indufor 2012), it has been our experience that it becomes very problematic to even convene appropriate stakeholders for debate.\nNevertheless, a new narrative is needed that reframes global environmental change from an exclusive focus on physical processes of nature to the interlinkages with social processes. This new insight would provide an incentive to see the environment in terms of use and distribution of natural resources rather than scarcity. This subtle switch could have powerful consequences to enable a more rapid and inclusive uptake of practical measures to tackle production and consumption and internalize them into mainstream economic strategy.\nOur view is that part of this narrative, based on our experience to date, must be the moral imperative of unlocking the potential of tree plantation biotechnology at scale, on time, and in the right location.\nWe believe that the landscape level experimentation we propose will contribute significantly to this newnarrative, both through providing robust scientific evidence fordecisionmaking, but also by providing a platform for objective debate on the reality of what is possible.\nThe availability of a landscape level experiential platform for debate could help build a positive, mobilizing vision for the ways in which communities and biodiversity can benefit from the technologies that will underpin intensification and insights for appropriate governance frameworks. For both civil society and business, this means developing a cooperative model that favors a diffusion of advanced technologies to the benefit ofmore, not fewer, people under conditions that are acceptable. This would be unprecedented but necessary since we live in a world in which the only thing we can be certain of is change. Change challenges everything. It challenges most of all the tools we employ to achieve our objectives\u2014if our objectives are to remain relevant and have impact at scale. The speed of change is the most difficult facet of this challenge because it requires us to act in ways and in contexts in which we are unfamiliar. Exponential change is inevitable, and the risks of not mounting an effective systemic response are profound. Collective response in developing transformative solutions will start with trust building to enable the collusion required for implementation. Governance will provide the co-\nAdvanced Online Article.

If joint interests can be agreed upon up front under appropriate governance frameworks, there is a more mobilizing potential for development and deployment of innovations that could enhance carbon drawdown and climate mitigation. Our interests are therefore roughly aligned and opposition to such technologies could actually do more harm than good to local communities.\nOurGM tree policy was drafted from the perspective that it is inour interest toshare innovation broadly with our outgrowers and tomake it freely available for humanitarian and forest protection purposes. It neednot be the case that the onlyway of balancing more with less through improving technical efficiency (\u201cintensification\u201d) is seen only as an interim solution for resolving the imbalance between the activities of society and the capacities of the natural world. This could in fact be the start of a trajectory toward renewal.\nWe are also confident that the dialogue platform we propose could address the evident hesitancy in considering high-tech plantations as an option for development. Dialogue of such a nature could provide the reassurances and evidence of safeguards and shared benefits that managing transformational change is practically possible and that disruption need not necessarily be a threat.\nFor business this is a major challenge; it will involvemore intimatelyworkingwithnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), integrating \u201csocial license to operate\u201d into strategy, diffusion rather than consolidation of innovation, and internalizing environmental externalities. Themost fundamental change required would be the building of trust, to deconstruct ideological barriers that thwart collective action, and enable the identification of a common ground to achieve a common objective of sustainable forest management.\nA recent publication describing a set of principles for governanceof cropbiotechnology (Gordon et al. 2021), significantly shifts the debate toward collective action and the question of shared value. This offers a novel path toward defining\ncommon ground on which such principles could be implemented. \u201cRisks and benefits should be weighedagainst the counterfactuals of continuing with business as usual against the backdrop of a changing climate and growing human population\u201d (Gordon et al. 2021). In January 2022, in collaboration with members of the steering committee of this publication, we published a commentary on this article (May et al. 2022), because manyof thekey featuresof theseprinciplesconcur broadlywith theGMtreepolicywehadpublished earlier. We welcome a pathway for engagement and exploration of narratives toward further positiveunderstandingoftherelevanceofbiotechnology to climate change food security and related challenges.\nThe moral imperative should be to embrace newer methods, allowing advances to leave the laboratory and be tested in the field unhindered. This isof special importance fordeveloping countries, where modern plant-breedingmethods can allow local scientists to innovate and improve the crops needed to feed their citizens (May et al. 2022).\nUltimately, success lies not only in the science available, but in parallel, the co-creation of an environment in which science is embraced and capacity building and technology transferflow from that. Science, without public acceptance, will in the endbe irrelevant, andahuge, existential global imperative will be sidelined through misunderstanding, causing irreparable planetary damage.\nThe fundamental challenge and opportunity of our time is therefore to develop leadership in the formulation of a governance framework that will master natural resource productivity efficiency in transformative and socially relevant ways. Within this, the physical challenge is to develop and deploy the science and technology for the sustainable intensification of agroforestry commodity production. The socioeconomicchallengewill be to ensure that technology reaches those who need it the most and that responsibleprocurementpolicies are systemic.The environmental challenge is to uncouple solutions for meeting productivity challenges from persistent cycles of ecosystem degradation and carbon emissions.

The way forward is enhanced and informed dialogue on technology, enabling policies that stimulate the flows of technology and investment required and international cooperation in technology development and deployment.Well managed, and appropriately located GM plantations can be a key feature of healthy, diverse, and multifunctional forest landscapes, and can thus provide conditions that are compatible with climate, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being needs.\nCurrentthoughtleadershipidentifiestheneed for positive exponentials to break the existingparadigm of economic, ecological, and social dysfunction (Elkington 2020). Many of the technologies and ideas already exist. The fundamental shift required to unleash that potential and drive a regenerative, distributive economic order is the creation of hitherto unimaginable coalitions that can transcend current ideological and institutional barriers and disrupt dysfunction. More specifically, the scale and pace of breakthrough will be determined by the speed with which the technologiesandideasof thefuturecangainsocial license."
