    "abstractText": "21 Bacteriocins are a diverse group of highly specific antimicrobials produced by bacteria, 22 thought to mainly target and kill strains that are closely related to and which therefore potentially 23 compete in the same niche space as producer cells. Single strains can produce more than one 24 type of bacteriocin, with each usually having differing modes of action and receptors for binding, 25 and with strain specificity for each independent bacteriocin due to the requirement for these 26 molecules to bind to receptors in target cells prior to carrying out antibacterial functions. Here 27 we show that Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata DSM50252 (Ptt) displays broad intraspecific 28 killing activity due to combinatorial and non-overlapping activities of phage derived bacteriocins 29 (referred to as tailocins) as well as a prophage encoded lectin-like bacteriocin (aptatacin L1). 30 These results highlight how single strains can maintain broad killing activity against a variety of 31 potential competitors by targeting multiple conformations of a shared receptor, and provide 32 additional evidence that tailocins and aptatacin L1 both utilize rhamnose moieties in the LPS as 33 potential receptors for binding. 34 35 .

            "text": "Bacteriocins are a diverse group of highly specific antimicrobials produced by bacteria, 22 thought to mainly target and kill strains that are closely related to and which therefore potentially 23 compete in the same niche space as producer cells. Single strains can produce more than one 24 type of bacteriocin, with each usually having differing modes of action and receptors for binding, 25 and with strain specificity for each independent bacteriocin due to the requirement for these 26 molecules to bind to receptors in target cells prior to carrying out antibacterial functions. Here 27 we show that Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata DSM50252 (Ptt) displays broad intraspecific 28 killing activity due to combinatorial and non-overlapping activities of phage derived bacteriocins 29 (referred to as tailocins) as well as a prophage encoded lectin-like bacteriocin (aptatacin L1). 30 These results highlight how single strains can maintain broad killing activity against a variety of 31 potential competitors by targeting multiple conformations of a shared receptor, and provide 32 additional evidence that tailocins and aptatacin L1 both utilize rhamnose moieties in the LPS as 33 potential receptors for binding. 34 35\n36 INTRODUCTION 37 Microbial community structure can be driven by antagonistic interactions within and 38 between strains and species, leading to increased interest in mining the molecules behind such 39 interactions as next generation antimicrobials (1, 2). Pseudomonas syringae pv. aptata 40 DSM50252 (Ptt) was demonstrated to possess the broadest intraspecies killing spectrum 41 compared to other P. syringae strains in a relatively large screen for activity of phage derived 42 bacteriocins (referred to hereafter as tailocins, (3)). A better understanding of the genetic factors 43 enabling Ptt to maintain extensive intraspecies antibacterial activity could provide insights into 44 how to develop optimized antimicrobials and better deploy antimicrobials in effective 45 combinations (4\u20137), and we therefore sought to identify the underlying basis for this broad-46 spectrum activity. 47 Bacteriocins are proteinaceous antibacterial compounds produced by bacteria that 48 typically have activity against closely related strains, either by interrupting processes within the 49 cell or disrupting membrane integrity (8\u201311). Production of these molecules is typically thought 50 to be coregulated with the SOS response and upregulated in response to DNA damage, as they 51 are often repressed by the action of LexA-like proteins or LexA itself (12\u201315). Bacteriocins have 52 already shown promise as effective and highly specific treatment options to prevent or treat 53 bacterial infections through application and when engineered into host genomes (6\u20138, 16). A 54 deeper understanding of the modes of actions of multiple bacteriocins produced by single strains 55 could therefore aid the development and optimization of future bacteriocin treatments across 56 both clinical and agricultural settings. 57\nSpecificity of bacteriocin targeting is imparted by a requirement of these proteins to bind 58 to receptors on target cells prior to carrying out antimicrobial functions, and bacteriocin classes 59 can therefore be separated by their molecular composition, size, and modes of function (8). 60 Diffusible bacteriocins, such as colicins and microcins, are relatively small molecules that 61 diffuse or are translocated across the cell membrane of target bacteria to enter the cytoplasm, 62 where antimicrobial activity is often due to DNAse or RNAse activity (17\u201319). Tailocins are 63 relatively large phage-derived particles that are thought to bind to the receptors (like the 64 lipopolysaccharide, LPS) that decorate the outside of target bacteria, and which are thought to 65 puncture the cell wall with their spike protein causing disruption of the membrane potential and 66 therefore cell death (13, 20\u201322). Lectin-like bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas spp. were 67 previously thought to bind targeted D-mannose oligosaccharides, but have now been shown to 68 utilize D-rhamnose of the LPS in a genus-specific manner (23, 24). The exact mechanism of 69 action by lectin-like bacteriocins remains unknown, but studies have demonstrated that 70 interactions with both the LPS and the outer membrane protein BamA are required for lethal 71 activity (24). 72 We previously used polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation to screen for tailocin-like 73 killing activity across diverse strains of the phytopathogen P. syringae, and found Ptt maintained 74 the broadest target range according to these assays (3). By using PEG to precipitate high-75 molecular weight compounds, apatacin L1 theoretically should not be left in the precipitated 76 supernatant since lectin-like bacteriocins consist of a single protein versus tailocins that form 77 large protein complexes (25, 26). We follow up on these initial results by demonstrating that 78 only a subset of witnessed killing activity post PEG precipitation for this strain can be attributed 79 to tailocins. We further show that the remaining activity is due to the presence the lectin-like 80\nbacteriocin, aptatacin L1, which shares similarity with the putidacin L1 described by McCaughey 81 et al. Together, these results characterize and clarify the underlying molecular and genetic basis 82 of broad-spectrum killing activity by Ptt against other P. syringae strains. 83 84\nRESULTS 85 86 An Improved, Nearly Complete, Genome Sequence for P. syringae pv. aptata DSM50252 87 As a first step towards fully characterizing bacteriocin production by Ptt, we generated a 88 new, nearly complete, genome assembly for this strain. This whole genome shotgun project has 89 been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/Genbank under accession AEAN00000000 and was sequenced 90 independently from the original assembly (27). The version described in this paper is version 91 AEAN02000000. This genome assembly is composed of one circular chromosome and one 92 circular plasmid (pPttDSM50252-1; 53,430bp). Curiously, despite the chromosome being 93 circularized by the unicycler pipeline, one additional 695,685bp linear contig was produced 94 during assembly. Given the content of this contig (which includes a variety of well known 95 \u201chousekeeping\u201d genes for Pseudomonas like gacA which should be found within the Ptt 96 chromosome, we assume that circularization was a misassembly error and therefore include this 97 additional contig as part of the genome assembly. The total size of all three contigs and therefore 98 the genome is 5,918,862bp. 99\n100 Ptt shows a variable and differential killing phenotype in overlay assays 101 Our original results demonstrated that Ptt possesses the broadest spectrum of killing 102 activity compared to other P. syringae strains that were screened (3). As part of the screen, we 103 were able to classify P. syringae strains into two broad sensitivity classes (A and B) according to 104 their interactions with PEG precipitated supernatants produced by diverse P. syringae strains. 105 Unlike many other strains, PEG precipitated supernatants from Ptt maintained activity against 106 many strains from both tailocin sensitivity classes. Reinspection of overlays behind these results 107\nhighlighted an additional phenotype of interest relevant to the broad killing spectrum of Ptt in 108 that the zone of killing for Ptt preparations was visibly larger against sensitivity class A strains 109 than against class B strains (Figs. 1A and 1B). Killing zones were also visibly larger for 110 preparations from Ptt against class A strains when compared to other tailocins known to target 111 class A strains (Figs. 1A and 1B). As a follow up experiment, we retested the sizes of killing 112 zones when class A and B strains were treated with unselected supernatants from tailocin 113 induced cultures of Ptt and USA011. Using PsyB728a and P. syringae UB303 as representative 114 target strains for tailocin sensitivity class A and B strains, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 our 115 new data clearly demonstrates that the killing zone from Ptt supernatants is much larger against 116 tailocin sensitivity class A strains than tailocins from strain USA011 against these same targets. 117 The zone of inhibition is also larger than killing zones generated by Ptt supernatants against 118 tailocin sensitivity class B strains. We further find that the area of the PEG prepped supernatant 119 killing zone is not significantly smaller compared to raw supernatant (Fig. 1B), although 120 variability in the assay may be obscuring an underlying trend. These results indicate that PEG 121 precipitation does not cleanly select out a subset of the killing activity from these supernatants, 122 unlike other strains where diffusible bacteriocins are eliminated by this treatment (26). 123 124 Killing activity against tailocin sensitivity class A strains is eliminated in a tailocin 125 knockout strain 126 In previous studies, creation of a double knockout mutant through the deletion of the 127 receptor binding protein (Rbp) and adjacent chaperone (Ch) from the tailocin locus was 128 sufficient to abolish killing activity in a particular strain (3, 7, 28). To investigate tailocin killing 129 activity in Ptt, we created a similar a Rbp/Ch double knockout mutant and tested for killing 130\nactivity against strains from tailocin sensitivity classes A and B. Instead of eliminating all killing 131 activity from supernatants after PEG precipitation, as one would predict if the activity was solely 132 due to tailocins, we observed that the Rbp/Ch knockout (Ptt\u0394rbp/ch) abolished killing against all 133\ntailocin sensitivity class B strains but maintained activity against all sensitivity class A strains 134 (Fig. 2). 135 136 Non-tailocin antimicrobial activity is due to a phage derived lectin-like bacteriocin 137 Given that killing activity was maintained against tailocin sensitivity class A P. syringae 138 strains in the Rbp/Ch deletion mutant, we carried out transposon mutagenesis to identify genes 139 responsible for remaining antimicrobial activity. We were successfully able to isolate multiple 140 mutants with independent transposon insertions each of which had lost the antimicrobial activity 141 against tailocin class A strain PsyB728a. Focusing on transposon mutant Ptt2D7, we further and 142 found that killing activity in this mutant was abolished against other strains designated as tailocin 143 sensitivity class A but antagonistic activity was maintained against tailocin sensitivity class B 144 strains (Fig. 2). 145 However, investigation of transposon insertion positions in Ptt2D7 as well as two 146 additional and independent transposon strains where activity against class A strains was 147 abolished strongly suggested that transposon insertions were not causative of loss of 148 antimicrobial activity as each of the insertions was in unrelated genes predicted disrupt pathways 149 involved in metabolism and growth. Specifically, the transposons were found to have disrupted 150 hopAC (PSYAP_002225), an ABC transporter (PSYAP_017405), and mksF (PSYAP_003975), 151 in transposon strains 2D7, 4E3, and 5D10 respectively. Further investigation of genome 152 assemblies for these three strains showed that, in addition to possessing independent transposon 153\ninsertions, each had also lost a prophage compared to the original Ptt genome (Fig. 2B). 154 Evaluation of genes encoded by this prophage using BagelIV highlighted the presence within the 155 phage genome of an ORF encoding a potential lectin like bacteriocin previously identified in 156 strain Ptt by McCaughy et al. and which we will refer to as aptatacin L1. (23, 29, 30). 157 158 Ptt tailocin targets sensitivity class B strains, while aptatacin L1 targets sensitivity class A 159 To demonstrate that aptatacin L1 was responsible for killing activity maintained in the Ptt 160 Rbp/chaperone mutant against tailocin sensitivity class A strains, we deleted the aptatacin L1 161 gene (apt) from the Ptt genome and evaluated killing activity of this mutant. We find that killing 162 activity is abolished when supernatants from Ptt\u0394apt are tested against multiple strains classified 163\nas sensitivity class A, but is maintained against all strains classified as sensitivity class B (Fig. 164 2). In parallel, we cloned the apt gene under control of a lac promoter into pET-28a(+) and 165 measured the killing activity arising from supernatant from E. coli cultures induced by IPTG. As 166 one can see in Figure 3, production of aptatacin L1 by E. coli is sufficient to enable killing 167 against P. syringae class A strains (Fig. 3B). Therefore, it is clear that killing activity of Ptt 168 against sensitivity class A strains is due to the production of aptatacin L1. 169 170 Low level of induction of aptatacin L1 under normal laboratory conditions, with further 171 induction by mitomycin C 172 P. syringae tailocin production is thought to be induced by DNA damage, as tailocin 173 biosynthesis pathways are repressed by a lexA-like regulator (referred to as ptrR in P. aeruginosa 174 but with a similar protein present in P. syringae (12, 14, 31)). Since the apt gene is present in a 175 prophage in a different part of the chromosome than the tailocin locus (Fig. 3A), we tested for 176\ninduction of this lectin-like bacteriocin by DNA damage in response to mitomycin C (MMC). 177 We find that Ptt shows killing activity against sensitivity class A strains with and without MMC 178 induction, although the activity is lowered in the absence of MMC. In contrast, tailocin-179 dependent killing activity by Ptt against sensitivity class B strains is seen only after induction by 180 MMC (Fig. 2). These results therefore indicate that apt is expressed and aptatacin L1 appears to 181 be produced at a low level regardless of DNA damage under normal laboratory conditions, but 182 also suggests that the locus encoding aptatacin L1 can be additionally upregulated by the 183 presence of DNA damage. 184 185 DISCUSSION 186 Bacteriocins possess great potential for use as highly efficient strain-specific antibiotics 187 to replace, or work alongside, broad-spectrum antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of 188 bacterial infections across clinical and agricultural settings (8). Before deployment in such cases, 189 we must first gain a deep understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms by which they 190 are produced and released, how target host strains are sensed by the bacteriocins, the genetic 191 basis for target strain specificity, as well as the mechanism of action of different subsets of 192 bacteriocins. Towards these goals, we sought to investigate the genetic basis underlying 193 exceptionally broad intra-species killing by bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. 194 aptata DSM50252 (Ptt). 195 Despite an extensive amount of research identifying and characterizing bacteriocins 196 across bacteria, and recent insights into evolutionary costs and benefits of employing different 197 types of bacteriocins, much less is known about how evolutionary pressures structure bacteriocin 198 composition within single strains (32\u201334). Given that our previous publication (3) screened for 199\nbacteriocin activity from supernatants that had undergone PEG precipitation (which we assumed 200 cleanly selects tailocins away from other diffusible bacteriocins), our initial hypothesis was that 201 the ability of Ptt to target strains from multiple tailocin sensitivity classes meant that tailocins 202 from Ptt possessed unique capabilities compared to those from other strains. However, further 203 inspection of overlay data showed that killing zones from Ptt PEG-precipitated supernatants 204 were larger against tailocin sensitivity class A strains than against class B strains even when the 205 same volume of supernatant was applied, suggesting that killing activity was not phenotypically 206 homogenous against all other P. syringae strains. As relayed above, our follow up results 207 demonstrate both that non-tailocin bacteriocins can be pulled down during PEG precipitation 208 despite their smaller size but also highlight that different types of bacteriocins can have similar 209 or analogous receptors in target strains. 210 There is strong genetic evidence that tailocins produced by various Pseudomonads 211 interact with sugar chains that compose the O-antigen of the LPS to mediate antimicrobial 212 activity (35\u201338). Moreover, multiple studies strongly suggests that Ptt and other strains classified 213 as tailocin sensitivity class A appear to maintain an LPS O-antigen region consisting of D-214 rhamnose while sensitivity class B strains maintain an O-antigen that consists of L-rhamnose 215 (37, 39, 40). Data reported here further supports this hypothesis, as an Rbp/chap tailocin deletion 216 strain fails to kill sensitivity class B P. syringae strains and thus it is likely that the Ptt tailocin 217 targets strains with L-rhamnose moieties in their LPS to complement the activity of aptatacin L1 218 against D-rhamnose moieties as described below. 219 Lectin-like bacteriocins, such as aptatacin L1, have been shown to interact with D-220 rhamnose of the LPS and likely bind it (23), and thus potentially are able to target tailocin 221 sensitivity class A strains, but also ultimately mediate killing activity through further interactions 222\nwith the BamA protein (24). Since Ptt is classified as a tailocin sensitivity class A strain, and 223 therefore likely possesses a D-rhamnose based O-antigen, we predict that aptatacin L1 should be 224 able to bind to the LPS of Ptt. However, inspection of sequence variation in bamA from the Ptt 225 genome highlights that this strain likely avoids killing by aptatacin L1 despite possessing D-226 rhamnose because its version of BamA possesses a motif that is immune to lectin-like 227 bacteriocin killing (24). Regardless of the status of BamA across other genomes of P. syringae, 228 sensitivity class B strains fail to be killed by aptatacin L1 because this bacteriocin cannot bind to 229 the L-rhamnose based LPS of these strains and indeed we witnessed no killing activity against 230 class B strains from our tailocin Rbp/chap deletion strain. Therefore, our results demonstrate that 231 the previously reported broad killing spectrum of Ptt PEG precipitated supernatants is due to the 232 combination of activities of two different types of bacteriocins: a tailocin which kills strains with 233 L-rhamnose based O-antigen (sensitivity class B) and aptatacin L1 which kills strains with D-234 rhamnose based O-antigen and which also possess bamA alleles that are sensitive to lectin-like 235 bacteriocins. Furthermore, since other tailocins produced by P. syringae are predicted to interact 236 with D-rhamnose, it remains an open question whether aptatacin L1 and D-rhamnose targeting 237 tailocins interact with the O-antigen of the LPS in similar ways. 238 Phages are known to encode pathways to produce antimicrobial compounds which likely 239 benefit both the host cell and the phage by allowing bacterial hosts to outcompete other cells (41) 240 Resistance to many bacteriocins is usually provided by resistance genes that are coproduced 241 together with the bacteriocin, rendering the producer cells inherently immune to these toxins. It 242 is therefore straightforward to imagine how such bacteriocin-resistance gene modules can be 243 acquired by phage and plasmids, as their modular setup renders activity of the bacteriocin largely 244 independent of plasmid and phage functions. The presence of a gene encoding aptatacin L1 245\nwithin a prophage, as is found in Ptt as well as for other lectin-like bacteriocins, presents a 246 slightly more confounding situation because there doesn\u2019t appear to be other LPS-modification 247 genes present in this phage locus in Ptt. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of lectin-like 248 bacteriocins potentially limits host range of the phage and ultimately affects phage evolutionary 249 dynamics because new potential hosts for the phage must not only have a receptor for the phage 250 but must also possess an appropriate genetic background to be resistant to aptatacin L1. 251\nBacteriocins are typically produced by bacterial species as a competitive advantage 252 against other bacterial species in a particular microbiome when there are stressors, such as 253 limited resources (1, 2). Tailocin encoding operons are induced by DNA damage and tightly 254 controlled at the transcriptional level, likely because all known tailocin loci also co-express 255 lysozyme to enable bacteriocin release to the environment and thus expression of tailocin-256 coregulated operons is ultimately lethal. Given the phage-dependent location of aptatacin L1, we 257 investigated the regulation of the apt gene. Although we saw that this gene was induced under 258 DNA damage by MMC like tailocins, we witnessed aptatacin L1 production at lower and levels 259 \u201cnormal\u201d conditions of laboratory growth. Therefore, Ptt likely maintains the ability to kill 260 strains of tailocin sensitivity class A in the absence of DNA damage, and this potentially allows 261 for . This subtle change in regulation could also indicate that aptatacin L1 is effective in targeting 262 other strains under slightly different conditions than tailocins. 263\nAs we observed previously, strain Ptt possessed the broadest target range when evaluated 264 in the context of a relatively large and diverse screen for tailocin activity across P. syringae 265 strains (3). Here, we demonstrate that this abnormally broad killing activity by Ptt can be 266 attributed to the deployment of two classes of bacteriocins that act in a combinatorial way to 267 target strains with multiple types of O-antigens in their LPS. Further investigation into the 268\nspecific binding targets and regulatory pathways of these two types of bacteriocins will be useful 269 to understand environmental conditions with which they are beneficial in nature but may also 270 help to guide development of next generation strain-specific antimicrobials for use in agricultural 271 conditions . 272 273\n274\nMETHODS 275\nBacterial strains and growth conditions 276\nP. syringae pv. aptata DSM50252 was originally isolated from sugar beet, and the isolate 277 used for this manuscript displays resistance to rifampicin and was originally acquired from the 278 Dangl lab collection (27). All strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1 and with descriptions of 279 original isolation and modifications found in (42\u201344). Unless otherwise specified, all strains 280 were grown in King\u2019s B Media (KB) or on KB agar plates and antibiotics and other supplements 281 were used in the following concentrations: kanamycin 25ng/uL, rifampicin 50ng/uL, 282 nitrofurantoin 80ng/uL, tetracycline 10ng/uL, streptomycin 200ng/uL, diaminopimelic acid 283 (DAP) 200ng/uL. 284\nGenome Sequencing and Assembly 285\nThe Baltrus Lab stock of P. syringae pv. aptata DSM50252 was originally acquired from 286 the Dangl Lab stock in 2006 and frozen in 40% glycerol after two additional passages on KB 287 agar plates. For each genomic DNA extraction used in the assembly reported here, a sample of 288 this frozen stock was streaked onto KB agar plates, and a single colony was transferred to 2 ml of 289 KB broth and grown overnight at 27\u00b0C in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm. Genomic DNA used 290 for Illumina sequencing was isolated from a 2-ml overnight culture via the Promega (Madison, 291 WI) Wizard kit following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols and with the addition of RNAse. A 292 separate genomic DNA extraction was performed, as above, for Illumina and Nanopore libraries. 293 Sequencing of mutants followed the same protocols for DNA extraction. 294\nDNA for the Ptt genome was sent to MiGS (Pittsburgh, PA) for Illumina sequencing 295 following the standard workflow for library preparation and read trimming. As described in (45), 296 this workflow uses an Illumina tagmentation kit for library generation, followed by sequencing 297 on a NextSeq 550 instrument with 150-bp paired-end reads. Trimmomatic (46) was used for 298 adaptor trimming using the default settings. This workflow generated a total of 1,331,568 paired 299 reads and 358,000,888bp (\u223c60\u00d7 coverage) of sequence. Raw Illumina reads have been uploaded 300 to the SRA at accession SRR25551084. 301\nDNA for the Ptt genome was sent to Plasmidsaurus (Eugene, OR) for Nanopore 302 sequencing following the standard workflow for library preparation and read trimming. Samples 303\nwere prepared using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ligation Sequencing Kit version SQK-304\nLSK114, then sequenced on GridION 10.4.1 flowcells (FLO-MIN114) with the \"Super accuracy\" 305\nbasecaller in MinKNOW using ont-guppy-for-promethion version 6.5.7.This workflow 306\ngenerated a total of 95,408 reads and 477,229,324bp (\u223c80\u00d7 coverage) of sequence with a read 307 N50 of 8750bp. Raw Nanopore reads have been uploaded to the SRA at accession 308 SRR25551084. 309\nFor confirmation of the Rbp/ch deletion mutant and for identification of transposon 310 insertion sites, DNA was sent to MiGS (Pittsburgh, PA) for Illumina sequencing following the 311 standard workflow for library preparation and read trimming as described above. This workflow 312 generated a total of 1,331,568 paired reads and 358,000,888bp (\u223c60\u00d7 coverage) of sequence. 313 Raw Illumina reads for the transposon libraries have been uploaded to the SRA at accession 314 SRR25551084. 315 All genome sequences were assembled using unicycler v. as implemented in the Cyverse 316\npipeline v0.4.8 (47, 48). For the Ptt genome, both short and long reads were included in the 317 hybrid assembly while all other genome were assembled from short reads only. 318\n319\nBacteriocin induction and preparation 320\nThe method for bacteriocin induction and preparation has been previously described in 321 detail(49). For the induction and isolation of bacteriocins, a single colony of Ptt picked, 322 transferred to 2\u20133 mL of KB, and grown overnight on a shaking incubator at 220 rpm and 27 \u02daC. 323 The next day, the culture of the strain of interest was back-diluted 1:100 in 3 mL of KB and 324 placed back on the shaking incubator for 3\u20134 h. After this incubation period, mitomycin C 325 (MMC) was added to the 3 mL culture to a concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g mL\u22121 and incubated on the 326 shaker overnight to allow for induction of bacteriocin production. The next day, 1\u20132 mL of the 327 MMC induced cultures was centrifuged at 20 ,000 g for 5 min to form a pellet. Unless 328 undergoing PEG precipitation (see below), the supernatant was then carefully transferred to a 329 sterile microcentrifuge tube by filter sterilization using a 0.22 \u00b5m pore size filter. Supernatants 330 were stored at 4 \u02daC. For non-MMC-induced samples, overnight cultures were not back-diluted 331 and were immediately filter-sterilized after the overnight incubation period. 332\nPEG precipitation 333\nThe method for PEG precipitation has been previously described in detail (49). Polyethylene 334 glycol (PEG) precipitation is used for the separation and concentration of high molecular weight 335 compounds. NaCl and PEG were added to the sterile supernatant at final concentrations of 1M 336 and 10 %, respectively, and tubes were inverted repeatedly until dissolved. At this point tubers 337\nwere incubated for either 1 h on ice or overnight at 4 \u02daC. The samples are then centrifuged at 338 16 ,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u02daC. After decanting the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in a 339 volume of 1/10 of the original supernatant volume of buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM MgSO4, pH 340 7.0). To remove any residual PEG and to kill any remaining bacteria, an equal volume of 341 chloroform was added to the resuspended pellet and the tube was vortexed for 10\u201315 s, 342 centrifuged for 20 ,000 g for 5 min, and then the upper aqueous layer was transferred to a clean 343 microcentrifuge tube. This process was repeated for a total of two extractions until no white 344 interface was seen between the aqueous and organic phase layers. Any residual chloroform was 345 allowed to evaporate in a fume hood by leaving the tube uncapped for several (3\u20134) hours. 346\nSoft agar overlay 347\nThe method for the soft agar overlay assay used here has been previously described in 348 detail(49). A single colony of the target strain was picked, transferred to 3 ml of KB liquid, and 349 grown overnight on a shaking incubator at 220 rpm and 27 \u02daC. The next day, the target strain 350 culture was back-diluted 1:100 in 3 mL of KB and incubated for 3\u20134 h. Sterile 0.4 % water agar 351 was melted and 3 mL was transferred to a clean culture tube and allowed to cool until warm to 352 touch. An aliquot (100 \u00b5L) of the target strain culture was transferred to the melted water agar 353 and vortexed to thoroughly mix. The water agar mixture was then poured onto a solid KB agar 354 plate, swirled to cover the entire plate, and then allowed to cool for 15\u201320 min. Once solidified, 355 5 \u00b5L of the PEG-prepared supernatant was spotted onto the dish and allowed to dry. The plate 356 was allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days and then the presence or absence of killing activity was 357 recorded. All pictured soft overlay assays were repeated three times using independent 358 bacteriocin inductions and overlays and results reported are representative of all replicates. 359\nTwo independent replicate experiments were carried out to measure the sizes of killing 360 zones in soft overlay experiments. For each experiment, supernatant and PEG precipitated 361 supernatant treatments were prepared as above from each strain with 5 \u00b5L of each spotted onto 362 either P. syringae pv. syringae B728a (DAB2) or UB303R (DBL1887). For experiments using 363 DAB2 as a target strain, there were 5 measurements total across the two independent replicate 364 experiments. For experiments using UB303R as a target strain, there were 6 measurements total 365 across the two independent replicate experiments. Overlay plates were scanned and area of the 366 killing zones were measured using imageJ (50) (standardizing for 100mm diameter of petri 367 dishes). Scans underlying raw data can be found at 368 https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24208449, while raw data and code to reconstruct Figure 1B 369 can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8384752. 370\nTransposon Mutant Isolation and Screening 371\nFor construction of transposon libraries, a single E. coli colony housing a single plasmid 372 containing a modified Tn5 transposon was isolated from a previously constructed BarSeq library. 373 This plasmid was conjugated with Ptt through standard methods, briefly, both strains were 374 grown overnight in Lysogeny Broth (LB) media containing either rifampicin 50 ng/uL (Ptt) or 375 kanamycin 30 ng/uL and diaminopimelic acid 200ng/uL (E. coli). Cells were pelleted and 376 washed 2x in 10Mm MgCl2 with supernatant discarded after each wash, after which point the 377 cells were mixed and washed in 1mL 10Mm MgCl2. The mixture was pelleted, with supernatant 378 discarded, and the cells were resuspended in the remaining liquid. This mixture was plated on 379 LB agar plates supplemented with 200 ng/uL DAP and incubated at 28oC. After 7 days, the 380 conjugation mixture was resuspended and dilutions were plated on KB agar supplemented with 381 25 ng/uL kanamycin and 50ng/uL rifampicin. 382\nKanamycin resistant colonies arising from the conjugation were patched to KB agar 383 containing 25ng/uL kanamycin, and after growth, picked to 200uL KB media in a 96 well plate 384 and incubated at 28oC with shaking overnight. The next day, a drop of culture from each of the 385 96 wells was transferred to 100uL of KB media in a new 96 well plate and incubated for 4 hours 386 at 28oC with shaking, after which point an additional 100uL of KB media containing 387 1 \u00b5g mL\u22121 MMC was added to the plate. The plate was then incubated overnight with shaking at 388 28oC. The next day, 3uL samples from each well of the plate was spotted onto a soft agar 389 overlay plate prepared as described above except that for the overlay, 300uL of strain PsyB7828 390 was added to 5mL of 0.4% agar of the overlay strain and plated onto a 135mm petri dish 391 containing KB media with streptomycin added to the top agar at a final concentration of 392\n200ng/uL. Overlay plates were screened for lack of clearing zones, as indicative of the killing 393 activity from Ptt against PsyB728a being eliminated. 394\nCreation of Ptt Strains Containing Directed Deletions 395\nThe creation of DBL1944 (a Rbp/ch deletion mutant of Ptt, referred to as Ptt\u0394rbp/ch 396\nthroughout the text) was carried out using the Gateway cloning system with pMTN1907 as the 397 destination vector. To create this mutant, a Gblock was ordered from IDT and BP clonase was 398 used to recombine this dsDNA into plasmid pDONR207 to generate pDBL112. LR recombinase 399 was then used to recombine a dsDNA segment into pMTN1907 to generate pDBL113and 400 transformed into E. coli S17 lambda pir. As per previously described methods (CITATION), the 401 E. coli strain containing pDBL113 was mixed with Ptt and incubated on Lysogeny broth plates 402 (without antibiotic amendment) for 2 days. At this point, the conjugation mixture was 403 resuspended and plated onto KB agar plates containing rifampicin 50 ng/uL, tetracycline 10 404 ng/uL, and nitrofurantoin 40 ng/uL. Kanamycin resistant Ptt isolates were streaked to pure single 405 colonies on KB containing rifampicin and kanamycin at which point 8 independent colonies 406 were picked to a 2mL KB culture, grown overnight, and then plated onto KB media containing 407 10% sucrose. Sucrose resistant colonies arising from this selection were patched to KB plates 408 containing 10% sucrose plates and further patched to KB plates containing tetracycline. Sucrose 409 resistant, tetracycline sensitive colonies were then screened for presence of the deletion by PCR. 410 This Rbp/ch deletion was verified by whole genome sequencing, with raw sequencing reads 411 available at accession TBD. DBL1945 (the aptatacin L1 deletion mutant of Ptt, referred to as 412 Ptt\u0394apt throughout the text) was created by ordering a deletion vector from Twist Bioscience ( 413\nSan Francisco, CA USA) using pKM-18s (51) as a backbone vector to create pDBL114. This 414\nvector was conjugated into Ptt to create the deletion mutant using standard methods for 415 pMTN1907 growth and selection (as described above, except that selection for integration fop 416 pDBL114 into Ptt was performed and transconjugants were screened on KB agar plates 417 containing rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and kanamycin 25 ng/uL. For mutants arising from these 418 procedures, a single colony was grown overnight at 27 \u02daC with shaking in KB medium and 419 frozen in 40% glycerol at -80 \u02daC to . For all other P. syringae isolates, a single colony was 420\ngrown overnight at 27 \u02daC with shaking in KB medium supplemented with rifampicin 50 ng/uL. 421\nExpression of aptatacin in E. coli 422\nA pET-28a(+) expression vector with the addition of the apt gene was obtained through Twist 423 Bioscience and is referred to as pDBL115. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 424 (DE3) competent cells. Briefly, 1 \u00b5L of plasmid (50 ng) was added to 50 \u00b5L of competent cells 425 and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were then heat shocked for 15 seconds at 42\u02daC 426 and immediately added to ice for 2 minutes. 500 \u00b5L of LB was added to the tube and incubated 427 at 37\u02daC for 1 hour. The transformation was plated on LB + kanamycin 25 \u00b5g/mL and incubated 428 at 37\u02daC. A single colony from the selection plate was grown in LB liquid + kanamycin 25 \u00b5g/mL 429 overnight at 37\u02daC. A midlog phase culture (0.3-0.6 OD600) was induced with IPTG for a final 430 concentration of 0.33 mM IPTG and incubated overnight at 22\u02daC with shaking. Cells were spun 431 down at 8,000 x g for 2 minutes and supernatant decanted. Pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of 432 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl) and lysed using sonication. The lysed solution 433 was spun down and supernatant collected for overlay spotting. 434 435\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 436 437\nThis work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) 438\n(IOS 1856556) to DAB.

Ptt killing activity against different sensitivity classes due to combinatorial 460 activity of two different bacteriocins. A) Rows are bacteriocin treatment conditions and 461 columns are target strains sectioned out into sensitivity classes A and B. Ptt shows killing zones 462 across both sensitivity classes, with killing zone sizes being visibly smaller against class B. A 463 transposon mutant, Ptt2D7, is missing a prophage region, and subsequently aptatacin L1, in the 464 genome and shows abolished activity against class A strains. The tailocin knockout mutant, 465 Ptt\u2206rbp/ch, shows abolished activity against class B strains. The aptatacin L1 knockout mutant, 466 Ptt\u2206apt, shows abolished activity against sensitivity class A. Lastly, Ptt wildtype cultures not 467 induced by MMC only show activity against class A strains. These results, together, indicate that 468 Ptt tailocins target and kill sensitivity class A strains and aptatacin L1 targets and kills sensitivity 469 class B strains.
