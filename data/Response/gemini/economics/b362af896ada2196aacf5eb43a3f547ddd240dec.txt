1. **Investigate the long-term effects of digital deprivation on children's educational attainment and career prospects.** This could be done by following a cohort of digitally deprived children over time and comparing their outcomes to those of children who had access to digital technology.
2. **Examine the role of schools and other institutions in mitigating digital deprivation.** This could involve studying the effectiveness of school-based programs that provide students with access to computers and internet connectivity, as well as the role of libraries and community centers in providing digital access to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to reduce digital deprivation among children.** This could involve developing new technologies that make it easier for children to access digital content, or providing financial assistance to families to purchase computers and internet service.
4. **Explore the relationship between digital deprivation and other forms of social inequality.** This could involve studying the intersection of digital deprivation with poverty, race, and gender, and examining how these factors interact to create barriers to digital access.
5. **Develop policy recommendations to address digital deprivation among children.** This could involve working with policymakers to develop and implement policies that ensure that all children have access to the digital technology they need to succeed in school and in life.
