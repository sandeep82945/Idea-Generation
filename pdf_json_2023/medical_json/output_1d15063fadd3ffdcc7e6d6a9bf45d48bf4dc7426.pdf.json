    "abstractText": "A ratiometric fiber optic temperature sensor based on a highly coupled seven-core fiber (SCF) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A theoretical analysis of the SCF\u2019s sinusoidal spectral response in transmission configuration is presented. The proposed sensor comprises two SCF devices exhibiting anti-phase transmission spectra. Simple fabrication of the devices is shown by just splicing a segment of a 2 cm long SCF between two single-mode fibers (SMFs). The sensor proved to be robust against light source fluctuations, as a standard deviation of 0.2% was registered in the ratiometric measurements when the light source varied by 12%. Its low-cost detection system (two photodetectors) and the range of temperature detection (25 \u25e6C to 400 \u25e6C) make it a very attractive and promising device for real industrial applications.",

            "text": "Ratiometric sensors have been widely used in electrochemical analysis [1\u20136] and fluorescence-based sensing [7\u201311]. For example, ratiometric sensors have been developed to detect and measure DNA [12,13], glucose [14,15], and metal ions [16\u201318]. Among the advantages of ratiometric sensing schemes, one may mention the robustness over fluctuations, high accuracy, and great reproducibility. The basic idea of ratiometric sensing is the readout of two characteristic signals from the target measurand. When properly selected, one signal may act as a reference, making the ratio between them source-independent and providing the sensor with immunity against spurious signal fluctuations. Moreover, the characteristic signals may exhibit intensity changes in opposite directions, allowing an enhanced sensitivity. This improved sensitivity is particularly beneficial for sensing conditions with a low signal-to-noise ratio. On the other hand, and due to their materials and fabrication, fiber optic sensors share advantages such as compact size, light weight, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and chemical inertness. Therefore, fiber optic sensors have been developed to operate in harsh environments [19,20] and have shown reliability in measuring optical and mechanical variables such as refractive index [21,22], curvature [23,24], surface tension [25,26], and temperature [27,28]. Ratiometric sensing has been implemented in optical fibers to measure oxygen concentration [29,30], pH [31\u201333], and antibiotics [34]. In general, ratiometric fiber sensors use engineered fluorophores attached to optical fibers, generating a convenient optical probe for in-site measurement. In the experimental implementation, the fiber is used to launch the excitation irradiation as well as to collect the fluorescence emission.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7241. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167241 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7241 2 of 12\nThen, the spectral emission is analyzed, and the ratio between two specific wavelengths is measured. Recently, we reported a ratiometric temperature sensor based on two sections of highly coupled multicore fibers (MCFs) [35]. The designed sensor reported in [35] relied on the spectral features of the MCFs, which means that no fluorophore was required. Briefly, the sensor\u2019s spectral response is a function of the MCF geometry, MCF fiber lengths, and thermo-optic coefficient of the sensor materials [36]. The transmission spectrum of the proposed sensor exhibited a series of peaks within the near-infrared region. Based on numerical simulations, we tuned the MCF lengths in order to observe two wavelength peaks with opposite behavior in intensity when the MCFs were subjected to temperature variations. The MCF-based ratiometric sensor was simple to construct while exhibiting an enhanced sensitivity compared to non-ratiometric measurements. The main drawback of this approach was the use of expensive equipment, such as a supercontinuum (SC) light source and an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) in the detection stage. Applications such as point-of-care biosensing and industrial 4.0 sensors benefit from robust, portable, and inexpensive devices. Although optical fiber and fiber devices are inexpensive, the combined costs of an SC light source and an OSA exceed USD 45k, clearly preventing further applications. With that in mind, and in contrast to the approach reported in [35], we have designed, simulated, constructed, and tested an MCF-based ratiometric temperature sensor implemented with a commercially available and inexpensive light source and optical detectors. By connecting an NIR laser diode to two MCF sections in parallel and carefully selecting the spectral response of individual MCF sections, we obtained ratiometric operation from the voltage registered in two optical detectors. In this report, we combine the advantages of ratiometric sensing and the convenient implementation of fiber optic sensors. We believe these results represent a significant advance towards a more extensive development of industrial and MCF-based sensors."

            "text": "According to coupled-mode theory, the transmission spectrum of a seven-core highly coupled fiber (SCF) has a sinusoidal form with spatial frequency \u03b2 and intrinsic phase \u03b1 [22]. Then, one can model the normalized transmission response I of an SMF-SCF-SMF device as the following general expression:\nI(\u03bb) = 1 2 {1 + cos(\u03b2\u03bb + \u03b1)}. (1)\nIn Equation (1), \u03bb indicates wavelength, and the performed normalization restricts intensity to runs from 0 to 1. In general, \u03b2 and \u03b1 depend on the geometry, refractive indices, and fiber length. The inverse of spatial frequency is sometimes referred to as the free spectral range (FSR) and is important in optical sensors as it determines the operation range of the device. In other words, the FSR of an optical sensor should be larger than the maximum spectral shift to avoid ambiguity in the measurements. Thus, the spatial frequency, temperature, and \u2206Tmax of an SCF-based sensor should meet the relationship:\n2\u03c0 \u03b2 > \u2206Tmax \u2202\u03d5 \u2202T (2)\nwhere \u2202\u03d5/\u2202T indicates the phase shift with respect to temperature changes. Expressing Equation (1) in terms of a normalized wavelength \u039b = \u03b2\u03bb allows us to study the induced phase shift as a function of curvature and temperature. Figure 1a shows the generalized response of an SMF-SCF-SMF device of spatial frequency \u03b2 and intrinsic phase shift \u03b1 as a solid grey line. The normalized intensity of this device exhibits a minimum when the normalized wavelength is equal to \u03c0 + \u03b1 and a maximum when \u039b is equal to 2\u03c0 + \u03b1 as depicted in Figure 1a. We have indicated the operation wavelength in Figure 1 as a vertical dotted line and labeled it \u039b0. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that bending SMF-MCF-SMF devices translates into a high-sensitivity spectral shift [37\u201340]. Therefore,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7241 3 of 12\nthe spectral response of the proposed device can be set to intersect the operation wavelength at half the normalized intensity, provided a bending-based shift \u03d5B. The operation point at half the intensity is selected as the sinusoidal response is highly linear around this point. Figure 1a depicts as a solid black curve, the simulated response of the device after a shift of \u03d5B. Moreover, we can obtain an anti-phase version of the previous device using the same SCF lengths and inducing a curvature to shift the spectral response by \u03d5B + \u03c0 radians. Figure 1b shows the response of the first device as a solid black curve and the response of the anti-phase device as a solid red curve.

(c) Spectral response of the two anti-phase devices after a temperature-induced phase shift. See the text for more details.\nAlthough the temperature may alter the spatial frequency via refractive index variations, we have shown that the main contribution of temperature in an SMF-SCF-SMF device is a phase shift in the spectral sinusoidal response [22]. Then, in terms of temperature and bending disturbances, the normalized intensity of an SMF-SCF-SMF device can be modeled as follows: \ud835\udc3c \u039b = 1 + cos \u039b+ \ud835\udefc \u2212 \ud835\udf11 \u2212 \ud835\udf11 .

As shown in Figure 1c, the vertical line intersects both curves at different normalized intensity values. Thus, the temperature change may be tracked by recording the values of both devices at the operation wavelength. Moreover, by performing a ratiometric measurement of the recorded values, the measurement can be independent of the actual optical power supplied by the light source. We can further analyze the temperature response of the ratiometric measurements at \u039b0 as follows:\nFigure 1.

In order to show the linear tendency of the ratiometric response between 0 and \u03c0/4, we have calculated the first-order Taylor series around \u03c0/8 and plotted it in Figure 2 as a solid black curve.

As we will detail in the following section, the spectral response of one of the experimental devices showed the expected anti-phase behavior at 1550 nm without bending, which led us to engrave a curve and a straight channel on the same aluminum plate. The curvature radius of the curved channel was approximately 5.43 m\u22121 (18.40 cm).\n(Cimarec, SP88850100, ThermoScientific Waltham, MA, USA), and the SMF-SCF-SMF devices were allocated to the scribed channels, making sure to accommodate the SCF segments at the center of the channels. Additional stainless-steel nuts were placed over the channels to maintain the fibers within the channels and minimize contact with ambient air. As depicted in Figure 3, two light sources were used in this series of experiments; a supercontinuum source (SC, SC500, FYLA, Valencia, Spain) was used for the spectral characterization, while a laser diode (LD) at 1550 nm (LDM 1550-DB-1-FA) was used in the single-wavelength implementation. Similarly, an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, MS9740A, Anritsu, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan), two photodetectors (PDs, PDA20C, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA), and a 100 MHz oscilloscope (DSOX2012A, Keysight, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) were used in the detection stage for the spectral characterization and single-wavelength implementation, respectively. As shown in Figure 3, a 50/50 fiber coupler was used to split the input light at both device entries. For the single-wavelength implementation, the light source was controlled using an LD current controller (LDC220C, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA) with a 100 \u00b5A resolution, an accuracy of about \u00b12.0 mA, and \u00b12.0 A current operation control range. For both heat characterizations, the hotplate varied its temperature from 25 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C in steps of 25 \u00b0C. This controlled temperature change produced an anti-phase redshift in both devices that will be shown and described in the next section.\nAs s hematically shown in Figure 3, the aluminum plate was placed over a hotplate (Cimarec, SP88850100, ThermoScientific Waltha , MA, U.S.A.), and the SMF-SCF-SMF devices were alloca d to the scrib d channels, making sure to accommodate the SCF segments at the center of the channels.

            "text": "The results shown in previous sections demonstrate that a robust, highly linear, and easy-to-implement temperature sensor can be constructed based on short sections of highly coupled SCF by registering the quotient from two voltage signals. A key advantage of SCF-based sensors is their spectral tuning capabilities. In this exploration, we used that advantage to tune the linear response of two anti-phase SCF devices at a convenient operation wavelength to obtain enhanced sensitivity and good linearity performance. We showed in Section 2 that a good linear response could be found for a temperatureinduced phase shift of about \u03c0/4 (~0.78 radians). In Section 3, we confirmed that good linearity is experimentally observed even for slightly higher phase shift values than \u03c0/4, as the maximum shift observed of 12 nm corresponds to a phase shift of 0.9 radians. The slope of the linear approximation of the experimental data was 0.002 ratiometric units (R.U.) per centigrade. Notice that the slope of the experimental data shown in Figure 5 defines the sensitivity of the proposed sensor as ratiometric units per centigrade (R.U.\u25e6C\u22121), where ratiometric units result from the ratiometric measurement V1/V2. The experimental sensitivity value of 0.002 [R.U.\u25e6C\u22121] means that in each 100 \u25e6C step, the ratio between signals decreases by 20%, independently of the actual voltage readings. Indeed, temperature range and sensitivity are set once the fiber device is fabricated. However, designing a similar device for a predefined target temperature range or sensitivity is relatively easy. For instance, a sensor operating at twice the temperature range can be readily constructed by doubling the FSR and using half the SCF length (1 cm). Similarly, a more sensitive sensor can be designed using twice the SCF length (4 cm) to increase the slope from 20% to 40% in each temperature step of 100 \u25e6C. Evidently, one disadvantage of this proposed sensor is that the sensitivity and temperature range are inversely proportional in this approach. Therefore, designing a sensor for a larger temperature range with high sensitivity can be difficult. Nevertheless, many high-temperature and biological applications such as engine tests, reaction chambers, metallurgical processes, cell culture monitoring, and biomicrofluidics would greatly benefit from an easy-to-implement, versatile, non-electrical, small, chemically inert, and biocompatible sensor that is robust over source fluctuations such as the anti-phase ratiometric fiber temperature sensor presented here. A comparison of our proposed setup with similar previous works reported in [27,28,36,42,43] is shown in Table 1. In general, previous works rely on tracking the spectral shift of the engineered fiber device, and few efforts have been reported on high-temperature sensing (above 400 \u25e6C). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first research group to design and construct a ratiometric anti-phase fiber sensor for temperature sensing. Moreover, in this report, we propose and show a single-wavelength characterization system that allows robustness against power source fluctuations and avoids using expensive equipment. Moreover, the promising results shown here indicate that further explorations on this sensing approach can be attractive. For example, due to the reduced size of fiber optics, this sensing approach should exhibit a rapid response in following the temperature of its surroundings, even in sub-zero temperatures. The implementation can also be revised to reduce the cost of the system, improve resolution, or emphasize automatization by removing LD current/temperature drivers, using balanced photodetectors in the detection stage, or replacing the oscilloscope with a microcontroller board. Finally, we believe this versatile and inexpensive approach may help to design and construct more robust and attractive industrial fiber optic sensors. In summary, we have proposed and demonstrated a fiber optic temperature sensor based on an SCF that works in a ratiometric scheme. The inexpensive detection system of the device as well as its high sensitivity and temperature range (25 \u25e6C to 400 \u25e6C) make this sensor a good candidate for industrial applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7241 10 of 12\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.A.M.-A. and N.C.-E.; methodology, A.C.-A. and N.C.-E.; investigation, A.C.-A., N.C.-E. and D.A.M.-A.; resources, D.A.M.-A., I.H.-R., M.T-C. and N.C.-E.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.A.M.-A., N.C.-E., I.H.-R. and M.T.-C.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.A.M.-A., N.C.-E. and A.C.-A.; supervision, D.A.M.-A. and N.C.-E.; funding acquisition, D.A.M.-A., I.H.-R., M.T.-C. and N.C.-E.
