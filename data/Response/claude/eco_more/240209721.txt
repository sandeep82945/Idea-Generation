 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Study Bayesian persuasion with a learning receiver in settings with incomplete or asymmetric information. This paper focuses on the complete information setting. It would be interesting to extend the analysis to settings where the sender or receiver has private information.

2. Investigate the computational complexity of computing the optimal signaling scheme against a learning receiver. The paper shows that the sender's problem can be reduced to an approximate best-response model. What is the complexity of solving that model computationally?

3. Explore whether the bounds relating the learning outcomes to the approximate best-response outcomes can be tightened. There may be room to improve the constants or dependencies on key parameters in the bounds presented in the paper.

4. Consider other behavioral models for the receiver beyond no-regret learning. For example, how would outcomes change if the receiver follows a heuristic policy or is subject to cognitive biases?

5. Apply the framework to additional principal-agent settings beyond those discussed. The general techniques could apply to problems like pricing, voting, or auctions with learning agents. There may be new insights from studying those domains.
