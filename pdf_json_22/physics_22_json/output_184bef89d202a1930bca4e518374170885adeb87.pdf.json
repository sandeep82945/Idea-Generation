Here, we show that the sufficiently strong exchange coupling between a ferromagnetic impurity and substrate can trigger a quantum phase transition, beyond which, the phase of the topological surface superconducting order parameter around the impurity acquires a sign-change. In such a case, we prove that a Kramers degenerate pair of Majorana modes can be induced at the boundary separating the two sign-change regimes and trapped around the impurity in the topological surface superconducting state. Furthermore, we show that our theory can explain the controversial observations and confusing features of the zero energy modes from recent experiments in some iron-based superconductors.\nIn superconductor, the impurity can induce various quasi-particle states, such as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state from the classical impurity scattering potential[1\u20133] and Kondo resonance state from the impurity in quantum limit[4]. Through elucidating their properties, one can obtain much critical information on electron pairing[5]. Meanwhile, the quasi-particle state itself can manifest some unexpected behaviors. In particular, a interstitial iron impurity (IFI) induced robust zero-energy mode (ZM) has been reported by the scanning tunnelling micropy/spectroscopy (STM/S) in iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se)[6]. The subsequent studies have been extended to other iron-based superconductors such as monolayer Fe(Te,Se)/SrTiO3 and LiFeAs, and the similar ZM is also observed[7, 8]. Experimentally, the ZM can only be observed on partial iron impurities and is robust against the external magnetic field, and the critical temperature is much below the superconducting transition temperature Tc. Besides, these materials share a remarkable feature of possessing topological bands, which implies the ZMs could be Majorana modes. On the contrary, some revisited studies on Fe(Te,Se) claim the observed ZM is just trivial YSR states with nearzero-energy electron-like and hole-like components[9, 10]. Thus, the understandings of the properties and the mechanism of the ZMs in these iron-based superconductors are still in debate[6\u201310].\nIn this work, we first perform the first-principles calculations to investigate the interaction between IFI and substrate FeSe0.45Te0.55. The numerical results indicate the exchange coupling J(r, z) between magnetic moment of IFI and spin of the 3d electron of FeSe0.45Te0.55 has the form of Friedel-like oscillation with the characteristic length a0 of lattice constant of iron square lattice. The amplitude of J(r, z) and the magnetic moment of IFI strongly depend on the height z between IFI and sub-\nstrate. We further consider the impact of IFI on topological surface superconducting order parameter \u2206(r) by solving the Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes (BdG) equations defined on iron square lattice with self-consistency. We find that there exists a quantum phase transition (QPT) at a critical height zc, i.e. a critical Jc(r, zc), beyond which, \u2206(r) change sign in the r < a0 regime. Then, we prove that a Kramers degenerate pair of Majorana ZMs can be induced at the boundary separating the two signchange regimes and trapped by the IFI. For the smaller J(r, z) < Jc(r, zc), the QPT cannot be triggered. The IFI can only induce the trivial YSR states, which has the near-zero energy in vicinity of QPT. Within this picture, the contradictions between the results from different STM/S measurements can be solved, and properties of the ZMs, such as robustness against external magnetic field and lower critical temperature can also be understood.\nThe STM experiment shows that the height of IFI can be tuned by STM tip[8, 10]. During the process of approaching, transition from YSR states to ZMs happens[8]. It indicates that the coupling between IFI and substrate play a crucial role to observe ZMs. To elucidate properties of such coupling, we construct a 9\u00d79\u00d71 supercell including substrate Fe(Te,Se) with a suspended IFI. Here, we only summarize main results in Fig. 1, with calculation details in Ref. [11]. From Fig. 1 (a), there exists a strong charge transfer between IFI and substrate iron atoms, and such transfer decays abruptly as expected. The calculated spin polarizations of substrate shown in Fig. 1 (b) indicate J(r, z0) has the form of Friedel-like oscillation, which is consistent with the neutron scattering experiment on the Fe(Te,Se) with higher concentration of Te[12]. The characteristic length measured oscillation period is about lattice constant a0 from Fig. 1 (b). The findings are further supported by mag-\n2\nnetic moment of IFI as a function of height, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). As IFI approaches the substrate, the magnetic moment of IFI is suppressed. It indicates spin transfer also happens and exchange coupling between magnetic moment of IFI and substrate is strong. The strength of J(r = 0, z0) can be roughly estimated and is shown in Fig. 1 (d)[11]. Another crucial experimental signature is the presence of a level crossing at the transition from YSR states to ZMs, and the level crossing is robust against magnetic field[8]. This signature indicates the suitable model related to STS experiments is topological surface Dirac bands with trivial s-wave pairing[11]. Thus, we start with such a model defined on square lattices to evaluate impact of IFI to \u2206(r) of topological Dirac states on the surface of Fe(Te,Se) substrate. The model Hamiltonian is,\nHeff = HBdG +Hcoup, (1)\nand\nHBdG = \u2212\u00b5 \u2211\ni\nc\u2020i ci \u2212 it \u2211\n<i,j>\nc\u2020i\u03c3(S \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u00d7 d\u0302ij)\u00b7z\u0302cj\u03c3\u2032\n+ \u2211\ni\n\u2206i(c \u2020 i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193 + c.c.), (2)\nHcoup =\n\u222b\ndrJ(r, z0)Simp\u00b7\u03c3. (3)\nHere, \u00b5 is the chemical potential. The second term in Eq. (2) describes the topological surface Dirac states defined\non square lattices. d\u0302ij is the unit vector pointing from i to j. \u2206i is site-dependent superconducting order parameter. Note that such trivial s-wave pairing is good approximation for the topological surface Dirac state, can give the consistent results with the STS experiments[8, 11], and is widely adopted to study the topological properties of the ion-based superconductors[13\u201322]. Simp and \u03c3 in Eq. (3) label magnetic moment of IFI and spin of Fe of substrate, respectively. Here, we only consider z-directional spin polarization. J(r, z0) is important only in the first oscillating period a0. The nearestneighbor J(r, z0) is less than Jc according to the calculation. Here, we only consider the on-site term J(r = 0, z0) for simplicity[11]. As J(r = 0, z0) increases from zero, there exists a QPT[5, 23, 24] at a critical Jc \u223c 1.3t, beyond which, \u2206(r) suddenly changes sign and becomes negative, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Meanwhile, the level crossing of two components of YSR states happens, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Then, the spacial distributions of \u2206(r) in Fig. 2 (c) indicate \u2206(r) acquires a \u03c0 phase difference in r < R0 regime in comparison with that in r > R0 regime. Note that R0 can take the value of lattice constant a0 if the nearest-neighbor term of J(r, z0) is involved[11]. This is a very crucial result from the effect of IFI[23\u201327]. Though QPT is not driven by temperature, increase of temperature could quench it. Thereafter, we calculates the critical temperature Tq of QPT and find Tq is quite lower than bulk superconducting transition temperature Tc. We will return to this temperature effect below.\n3 Now, we consider the effect of spacial variation of \u2206(r) to topological surface states. The effective Hamiltonian describing the topological surface superconductivity with sign-change boundary condition is,\nHs = [vF (k\u00d7 \u03c3) \u00b7 z\u0302\u2212 \u00b5]\u03c4z +\u2206(r)\u03c4x. (4)\nHere, Hs is spanned in Nambu space, i.e., [c\u2191, c\u2193, c \u2020 \u2193,\u2212c \u2020 \u2191]. \u03c4x/z is Pauli matrix to span particle-hole space. \u2206(r) = \u2212\u22061 when r < R0 and \u2206(r) = \u22062 when r > R0 with \u22061/2 > 0 and \u22061 < \u22062. The phase of \u22061/2 is uniform and is omitted due to the absence of topological defect such as vortex. Thus, \u22061/2 is angle-independent and \u2206(r) is real in Eq. (4). In continuum limit, eigenequation of Hs is\nHs(k \u2192 \u2212i\u2207)\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = E\u03c8(r, \u03b8), (5) which can be solved under boundary conditions with a 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction shown in Fig. 3 (c). Before solving equation (5), we give a simple physical picture to understand existence of a Kramers degenerate pair of Majorana ZMs of the model. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) preserves particle-hole symmetry (PHS) with C = i\u03c3y\u03c4yK and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with T = i\u03c3y\u03c40K. The 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Fig. 3 (c) can come from the combo of geometries in Figs. 3 (a) and (b). We know that both geometries in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) host none edge bound states due to Dirac cone itself being two-dimensional boundary states[11]. However, when two geometries in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) are combined to form 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Fig. 3 (c), edge bound states must emerge. This behavior can be understood from Fig. 3 (d) to (e). 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Fig. 3 (e) can also obtained by bending 0\u2212 \u03c0 line junction in Fig. 3 (d) to connect two ends. It is well known that 0\u2212 \u03c0 line junction can support the one-dimensional linear-dispersion bound states[28, 29]. Likewise, 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Figs. 3 (c) and (e) should also have edge bound states. Such difference between Figs. 3 (a) and (b) and Figs. 3 (c) and (e) lies in that the wave function \u03c8(r, \u03b8) in 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Figs. 3 (c) and (e) must obey crucial antiperiodic boundary condition, i.e., \u03c8(r, \u03b8) = \u2212\u03c8(r, \u03b8 + 2\u03c0) to get bound states, which is explicitly pointed out by Fu et al [28]. Further considering geometry changes from Fig. 3 (d) to (e), the one-dimensional linear-dispersion bound states have to split into series quantized modes labeled by quantum numbers of angular momentum, among which, a pair of Majorana ZMs, must emerge. Such emergence can be understood from vortex case shown in Fig. 3 (f). The single-value condition requires wave function in vortex case is periodic, i.e., \u03c8v(r, \u03b8) = \u03c8v(r, \u03b8+2\u03c0). If one does a gauge transformation \u03c8v(r, \u03b8) \u2192 ei\u03c3z\u03b8/2\u03c8\u2032v(r, \u03b8), the phase winding of superconducting pair is eliminated, and new wave function \u03c8\u2032v(r, \u03b8) must obey antiperiodic boundary condition\nFIG. 3: (a) The infinite ring with uniform positive superconducting pairing \u2206.

It means that applying magnetic flux is equivalent to changing boundary conditions of wave function[30]. In this sense, our case is equivalent to vortex case by further taking into account another TR counterpart[11]. Therefore, Majorana ZMs must emerge for Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) with 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction in Figs. 3 (c) and (e)[31].\nThe above arguments can be exactly proven by both analytic and numerical solutions of Eq. (5)[11]. For boundless 0\u2212\u03c0 disk junction in Fig. 3 (c), wave function of the first Majorana ZM takes the form \u03c81(r, \u03b8) = [e\u2212i\u03b8/2u\u2191(r), ei\u03b8/2u\u2193(r), e\u2212i\u03b8/2v\u2193(r),\u2212ei\u03b8/2v\u2191(r)] with condition u\u03c3(r) = \u2212 v\u03c3(r). u\u03c3(r) = a\u03c3J\u22131/2(kF r)er/\u03be1 for r < R0 and u\u03c3(r) = b\u03c3J\u22131/2(kF r)e\n\u2212r/\u03be2 for r > R0. J\u22131/2(kF r) is Bessel functions with \u22131/2 for spin up and down, respectively. a\u03c3 and b\u03c3 are coefficients determined by continuity and normalization of wave function. Fermi wave vector kF = \u00b5/vF . Decay length \u03be1/2 = vF /\u22061/2. The wave function of the second Majorana ZM can be obtained by \u03c82(r, \u03b8) = T \u03c81(r, \u03b8). Note that the minigap to protect Majorana ZMs is proportional to vF /R0, which ensures only a pair of Majorana ZMs survive for small R0[11]. STS measured differential conductance dI/dV \u221d \u2211\u03c3 r[|u\u03c3(r)|2\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 eV )+ |v\u03c3(r)|2\u03b4(\u03c9 + eV )]. The case for Majorana ZMs is plotted in Fig.4 (b), from which, spacial profile of dI/dV is consistent with observations in monolayer Fe(Te,Se)/SrTiO3[7] but has subtle difference near r = 0 in comparison with the measurements in bulk Fe(Te,Se) and LiFeAs[6, 8]. We argue this tiny difference is from effect of IFI, such as mixture of electronic state, electron\u2019s inelastic tunneling process or finite quasi-particle scattering etc. In Fig. 4 (c), we consider modulation from finite quasi-particle\n4 (b)\n(d) (e) (c)\n(a)\nJ/t\nFIG. 4: (a) The overall energy spectrum from both YSR states (red color) of IFI scattering and the Majoran ZMs (blue color at zero energy) at the boundary separated the sing-change regimes as a function of J(r = 0, z).

(d) and (e) The external magnetic field effect to the YSR states and the Majorna ZMs, respectively.\nscattering and resulting spectrum is quite similar to cases in bulk Fe(Te,Se) and LiFeAs[11]. For finite 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction, numerical results are also consistent with analytic solutions[11].\nAforementioned theory can be utilized to understand multiple features and common properties of ZMs in ironbased superconductors. We summarize bound-state spectrum as function as J(r = 0, z0) in Fig. 4 (a). There exists a pair of near-zero-energy YSR states from IFI when J(r = 0, z0) is close to Jc. The electron-like and hole-like components of a pair of near-zero-energy YSR states has opposite spin polarizations. Thus, the whole of them shows no spin-resolved feature. When J(r = 0, z0) is larger than Jc, a pair of near-zero-energy YSR states steeply split, and the robust Majorana ZMs emerge and located at the boundary separated by two sign-change regimes. Note that the boundary is very close to the IFI. Thus, the contradictions from different STM/S experiments root in the selected IFIs with different exchange couplings J(r = 0, z), which coincides with the fact that ZMs can be only observed on a partial IFIs[6\u20138]. The fragileness of near-zero-energy YSR state and the robustness of Majorana ZMs against external magnetic field can also be understood. Consider Zeeman energy mz of ex-\nternal magnetic field, for a pair of near-zero-energy YSR states, opposite spin polarization indicates they have to split according to mz\u03c3z , as shown in Fig. 4 (d). For Majorana ZMs, the Hamiltonian Hs(k \u2192 \u2212i\u2207) defined in 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction possesses a hidden mirror symmetry Ml=0 = i\u03c3y\u03c4yO\u0302(r). O\u0302(r) is a spacial inverse operator along radial direction with inverse center at R0[11]. The degeneracy of a pair of Majorana ZMs is protected by this hidden mirror symmetry against \u03c3z and \u03c3x Zeeman field. However, in-plane Zeeman term my\u03c3y can split the degeneracy of Majorana ZMs[33]. This behavior can be testified by future experimental measurement. Turn to band structure, Zeeman term mz can be added into Hs in Eq. (4) to open a gap to Dirac bands. Then, the solution forms of Majorana ZMs are not changed but with a modulated k\u2032F = \u221a\n\u00b52 \u2212m2z/vF [11]. Thus, the Majorana ZMs are robust under condition mz < \u00b5, as shown in Fig. 4 (e). Note that Hs plus mz\u03c3z is also one copy of decoupled Hamiltonian to describe the case in monolayer Fe(Te,Se)/SrTiO3[7], in which, Dirac bands are from the bulk. Some experiments have observed that Majorana ZMs disappear at a temperature below Tc[6\u2013 8]. This behavior can also be understood from the selfconsistent calculation results in Fig. 2 (d). The signchange \u2206(r = 0) decays to zero at about Tq \u223c 0.6Tc. We argue this is the primary reason for temperature effect in spite of the possible quasi-particle poisoning[18, 32]. It is worth noting that magnetic impurity induced robust energy mode has also been observed in PbTaSe2[34], which also has topological bands and is superconducting. Within our theory, the observations in PbTaSe2 can be well understood.\nAt last, the reliablity of theory can be enhanced by estimating some relevant parameters. The first one is Jc \u223c 1.3t with t measuring the energy scale of the surface Dirac state, i.e., t \u223c vFkF . Acoording to the experiment[18, 35], vF \u223c 250meVA\u030a, and kF \u223c0.02A\u030a\u22121. Then, Jc \u223c7meV. It is also the reason why single IFI with quite small exchange coupling can induce the QPT and relevant Majorana modes. IFI can have a magnetic moment m \u223c 5\u00b5B, which induces a magnetic dipole field B(r) = \u00b50m/4\u03c0r\n3[36, 37]. The induced magnetic flux can be calculated by setting lower limit of integral cutoff to be a Wigner-Seitz radius of square lattice. If one quantized magnetic vortex emerges, it require the magnetic moment extend to be 104\u00b5B, which is only possible for a magnetic cluster in nanoscale.\nIn conclusion, we provide a new understanding to resolve the debate about whether STM/S observed ZMs induced by IFI on some iron-based superconductors is Majorana ZMs or not. We find a QPT can be triggered by the exchange coupling between the IFI and substrate. Then, the local superconducting order parameter of the surface superconduting state changes sign around the impurity, and we prove that a robust Kramers degenerate pair of Majorana ZMs can be induced and trapped\n5 around the IFI. Our theory can explain series confusing features observed by experiments. More meaningfully, our theory can be extended to other material categories, which host both topological bands and superconductivity.\nThe authors thank J. P. Hu, Z. Fang, C. Fang, X. X. Wu, S. B.

The plane-wave basis with an energy cutoff of 350 eV was adopted. The electron-ion interactions were modeled by the projector augmented wave potential (PAW) [3] and the exchange-correlation functional was approximated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-type (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [4]. Here we use the parameter \u201dI-CONSTRAINED-M\u201d in VASP to constrain the direction of the Fe impurity always along the z axis and give the substrate a very weak magnetic background. As shown in Fig. 5, the differential charge density can reflect the coupling between the impurity and substrate, as the height increases, the chemical adsorption will turn into physical adsorption. To estimate the value of J(r, z), we can set the impurity having a FM and AFM coupling with its nearest iron atoms respectively. And using a simple Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we can calculate the strength of exchange coupling. The local Hamiltonian reads\nHM = \u2212JH \u2211\nNN\nSimp \u00b7 SNN , (6)\nwhere Simp and SNN is the magnetic moment of the impurity and its nearest neighbor iron atoms. Because the impurity has four nearest neighbor, we can get\n\u2206E = HAFM \u2212HFM = 8JHSimpSNN . (7)\nThe effective magnetic field generated by the impurity is\nhimp = n\u3008Simp\u3009 \u00b5B \u222b JH(r)dr (8)\nwhere n, Simp,\u00b5B labels the concentration of localized moments, the average value of the localized spins, Bohr magneton and ferromagnetic exchange integral, respectively [5]. For a single impurity, we have n = 1 and JH(r) = JH\u03b4(r). The coupling Hamiltonian is\nHcoup =\n\u222b\ndrJ(r, z0)Simp \u00b7 \u03c3 (9)\nThe exchange interaction is very local, so we can assume that J(r, z0) = J\u03b4(r), and then we can adopt a mean-field approximation as\nHcoup = \u3008JSimp\u3009 \u2211\n\u03c3\n\u03c3c\u2020i0ci0 . (10)\n7\nComparing Eq. 10 and Eq. 8, we find that the existence of the magnetic impurity is equivalent to applying a local magnetic field at the impurity site. So the strength of the exchange coupling can be characterized by the effective magnetic field generated by the impurity, which can be calculated as\n\u3008JSimp\u3009 = \u2206E\n8SNN (11)\nIn our calculations, the SNN is set to be 0.05\u00b5B, Simp = \u00b13\u00b5B for FM and AFM coupling respectively.\nBDG METHOD IN LATTICE MODEL\nTo model the superconductivity in right way, it is better to start from the experimental measurements. From Fig. 3 in the experimental paper[6], one can find that the two YSR states always cross at a critical value of coupling\n8 between the impurity and substrate. Note that applying magnetic field is equivalent to change the coupling between the impurity and substrate and just move the crossing point. This robust crossing feature is crucial to decide how to model the superconductivity in right way. There are two possibilities to model the superconductivity related to the STM/STS experiments. i.e., the topological surface Dirac bands plus trivial s-wave pairing and trivial bulk multibands plus S\u00b1 pairing. In the former one, the superconductivity of the surface Dirac bands is from the self-proximity effect or inter-band scattering around \u0393\u0304 point in the surface Brillouin zone. The trivial bulk bands around M\u0304 point have no effect to the surface Dirac bands near \u0393\u0304 point. Thus, the superconductivity of the surface Dirac bands near \u0393\u0304 point can be reduced to have the trivial s-wave pairing, if the surface Dirac bands play a dominated role. We calculate the impurity induced YSR states for both models to see which one is consistent with the experimental measurements.\nTopological surface Dirac model with trivial s-wave pairing\nWe consider a square lattice, the topological surface Dirac Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nHsurf = \u2212 \u2211\ni\n\u00b5c\u2020ici \u2212 it \u2211 \u3008i,j\u3009 c\u2020i\u03c3(S \u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u00d7 d\u0302ij) \u00b7 z\u0302cj\u03c3\u2032 (12)\nwhich includes the on-site term, and linear Dirac term. Now a magnetic impurity is put onto the site i0 and thus would introduce an exchange term as\nHcoup = \u2212J(c\u2020i0\u2191ci0\u2191 \u2212 c \u2020 i0\u2193ci0\u2193), (13)\nwhich performs like an effective magnetic field generated by the impurity. Note that Simp is merged into J for simplicity. And when superconductivity is induced, the surface trivial s-wave Cooper pairing potential is introduced as\nH\u2206 = \u2211\ni\n(\u2206c\u2020i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193 + h.c.). (14)\nThe total Hamiltonian is\nH = Hsurf +Hcoup +H\u2206. (15)\nWe can perform the Bogoliubov transformation\nci\u03c3 =\n\u2032\n\u2211\nn\n(uni\u03c3\u03b3n \u2212 \u03c3vn\u2217i\u03c3 \u03b3\u2020n) (16)\nwhere \u2032 denotes summation over the positive eigenvalues, and numerically solve the equations \u2211\nj\nH\u0302ij\u03c6j = En\u03c6i (17)\nin the Nambu spinor representation \u03c6i = (u n i\u2191, u n i\u2193, v n i\u2191, v n i\u2193) T [7]. The matrix elements read\nH\u0302ij =\n\n   \n\u039bij\u2191 T \u2191\u2193 ij 0 \u2206i T \u2193\u2191ij \u039bij\u2193 \u2206i 0\n0 \u2206i \u2212(\u039bij\u2191)\u2217 (T \u2191\u2193ij )\u2217 \u2206i 0 (T \u2193\u2191 ij ) \u2217 \u2212(\u039bij\u2193)\u2217\n\n    , (18)\nwhere \u039bij\u03c3 = \u2212(\u00b5+ \u03c3J\u03b4ii0 )\u03b4ij . T \u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 ij = \u2212it(S\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 \u00d7 d\u0302ij) \u00b7 z\u0302. And the order parameter \u2206i should be self-consistently determined as\n\u2206i(T ) = g\n2\n\u2032\n\u2211\nn\n(uni\u2191v n\u2217 i\u2193 + u n i\u2193v n\u2217 i\u2191 ) tanh( En kBT ) (19)\nTo get the numerical results, we have adopted a 25\u00d7 25 lattice. The hopping parameter t = 10 meV , homogeneous order parameter \u22060 = 2 meV and chemical potential \u00b5 = 0.1t. The calculated spectrum of H in Eq. 15 is shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b), from which, one can find there exist a robust level crossing for two YSR states against the external magnetic field. The level crossing is schematically shown in Fig. 7 (d). The existence of level crossing is consistent with the experimental measurements, and indicates a QPT happens. At the QPT, the order parameter at the impurity site is discontinuous and suddenly change sign as shown in Fig. 7 (c).\nTrivial bulk Multi-bands model with S\u00b1 pairing\nNow we will check the same process between the magnetic impurity and bulk state of iron-based superconductor. The main difference is the pairing pattern. The numerical calculation is also carried on a square lattice and the minimal two-orbital band structure is adopt[8]. The two-orbitals model is described by\nHb = \u2211\nk\n\u03c8\u2020k[(\u01eb+(k)\u2212 \u00b5) + \u01eb\u2212(k)\u03c4z + \u01ebxy(k)\u03c4x]\u03c8k,\nwith \u03c8\u2020k = [d \u2020 xz(k), d \u2020 yz(k)], and\n\u01eb\u00b1(k) = \u01ebx(k)\u00b1 \u01eby(k)\n2 \u01ebx(k) = \u22122t1 cos kx \u2212 2t2 cos ky \u2212 4t3 cos kx cos ky \u01eby(k) = \u22122t2 cos kx \u2212 2t1 cos ky \u2212 4t3 cos kx cos ky \u01ebxy(k) = \u22124t4 sinkx sin ky\nAfter introducing the interacting term and at the mean field approximation, we obtain the BdG Hamiltonian as\n10\nHb +H \u2032 \u2206 = \u2212\n\u2211\nij,\u03b1\u03b2\n(tij,\u03b1\u03b2 + \u00b5\u03b4ij\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2)d \u2020 i\u03b1dj\u03b2 + \u2211\n<<i,j>>\n(\u2206ij,\u03b1\u03b2d \u2020 i\u03b1\u2191d \u2020 j\u03b2\u2193 + h.c.).\nHere, \u2206ij,\u03b1\u03b2 describes the next-nearest neighbor pairing with S\u00b1 symmetry i.e., cos kx cos ky form in momentum space. The IFI induced intra-orbital scattering is considered as\nH \u2032coup = J \u2211\n\u03b1\n(d\u2020i0\u03b1\u2191di0\u03b1\u2191 \u2212 d \u2020 i0\u03b1\u2193di0\u03b1\u2193).\nThe total Hamiltonian is\nH \u2032 = Hb +H \u2032 \u2206 +H \u2032 coup (20)\nThe self-consistent condition is\n\u2206ij(T ) = g\n2\n\u2032\n\u2211\n<<i,j>>n\n(uni\u2191v n\u2217 j\u2193 + u n i\u2193v n\u2217 j\u2191 ) tanh( En kBT ),\nand the final homogeneous order parameter is expressed as \u2206\u0304i = 1 8\n\u2211 j,\u03b1\u03b2 \u2206 \u03b1/\u03b2 ij .The calculated spectrum of H \u2032 in Eq. 20 is shown in Fig. 7 (e), from which, one can find there only exist a level anticrossing for two YSR states. The level anticrossing is schematically shown in Fig. 7 (f). This feature is inconsistent with the experimental measurements, and no QPT happens. The order parameter at the impurity site continuously decays to zero as J change, as shown in Fig. 7 (g). By comparing the calculation results of the above two models with the experimental measurements[6], we arrive the right model related with the STS experiments is the topological surface Dirac model with trivial s-wave pairing. We start with this model in the main text.\nTHE EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN VORTEX CASE AND IMPURITY CASE\nNumerical proof for the antiperiodic boundary condition for the impurity case\nWe first calculate the spectrum of the geometries, as shown in Fig. 8(a), (c) and (e) with periodic boundary condition i.e. \u03c8(r, \u03b8) = \u03c8(r, \u03b8 + 2\u03c0). The numerical results are shown in Fig. 8(b), (d) and (e), respectively. All \u03c0-phase disk and 0-phase ring and 0 \u2212 \u03c0 disk junction have no in-gap bound states. The numerical result for the 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction is not consistent with the well-know 0\u2212 \u03c0 line junction results. Therefore, the periodic boundary condition is not right for the 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction, and the antiperiodic boundary condition i.e. \u03c8(r, \u03b8) = \u2212\u03c8(r, \u03b8+2\u03c0) has to be used for the 0\u2212 \u03c0 junction disk in impurity case.\nVortex case\nFor comparison, we also analyzed the general vortex-induced Majorana mode. When there exist quantum vortexes, the SC order parameter should have a attached phase as \u2206 = \u2206(r)ei\u03b8 . The complete Hamiltonian can be expressed as\n\n  \n\u2212\u00b5 \u2212e\u2212i\u03b8vF (\u2202r \u2212 ir\u2202\u03b8) \u2206(r)ei\u03b8 0 ei\u03b8vF (\u2202r + i r\u2202\u03b8) \u2212\u00b5 0 \u2206(r)ei\u03b8\n\u2206(r)e\u2212i\u03b8 0 \u00b5 e\u2212i\u03b8vF (\u2202r \u2212 ir\u2202\u03b8) 0 \u2206(r)e\u2212i\u03b8 \u2212ei\u03b8vF (\u2202r + ir\u2202\u03b8) \u00b5\n\n  \n(21)\nCorrespondingly, the trivial wave functions should have this form\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = eil\u03b8\n\n   u\u2191(r) ei\u03b8u\u2193(r) e\u2212i\u03b8v\u2193(r) v\u2191(r)\n\n  \n(22)\n11\nAlso, the Majorana condition requests that\nl = 0 (23)\nu\u2191(r) = \u2212\u03b7v\u2191(r) (24) u\u2193(r) = \u03b7v\u2193(r) (25)\nThe radial equation can be obtained as\n\n  \n\u2212\u00b5 \u2212vF (\u2202r + l+1r ) \u2206(r) 0 vF (\u2202r \u2212 lr ) \u2212\u00b5 0 \u2206(r)\n\u2206(r) 0 \u00b5 vF (\u2202r + l r )\n0 \u2206(r) \u2212vF (\u2202r \u2212 l\u22121r ) \u00b5\n\n  \n\n   u\u2191(r) u\u2193(r) v\u2193(r) v\u2191(r)\n\n   = E\n\n   u\u2191(r) u\u2193(r) v\u2193(r) v\u2191(r)\n\n  \n(26)\nHere, we first derive the analytic solution for Majorana mode when \u2206(r) is approximated as a constant \u22060. Similarly, the equation can be simplified as\nu \u2032\u2032 \u2191 (r) + ( 2\n\u03be0 +\n1 r )u \u2032 \u2191(r) + ( 1 \u03be20 + 1 r\u03be0 + k2F )u\u2191(r) = 0 (27)\nthe solution can be obtained as :\nu\u2191(r) = c1J0(kF r)e \u2212r/\u03be0 (28) u\u2193(r) = \u2212c1J1(kF r)e\u2212r/\u03be0 , (29)\nwhich is consistent with Ref. [9, 10]. Now we will perform the numerical solution of Eq. (26), the method is the same as above. The space variation of order parameter is adopted as \u2206(r) = \u22060 tanh r \u03be0 . The results are shown in Fig. 10. For the vortex condition, its Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nH\u03bd = [vF (kx\u03c3y \u2212 ky\u03c3x)\u2212 \u00b5]\u03c4z +\u22060ei\u03bd\u03b8\u03c4+ +\u22060e\u2212i\u03bd\u03b8\u03c4\u2212, (30)\nwhere \u03bd = \u00b11 for (anti-) vortex, \u03c4\u00b1 = \u03c4x \u00b1 i\u03c4y. The wave functions of a vortex has a form shown in Eq. (22), we\n12\nname it \u03c8v+. And the wave function of an anti-vortex can be easily obtained as\n\u03c8v\u2212 = e il\u03b8\n\n   e\u2212i\u03b8u\u2191(r) u\u2193(r) v\u2193(r) ei\u03b8v\u2191(r)     . (31)\nBoth \u03c8v+ and \u03c8v\u2212 are periodic. However we can apply this gauge transformation\n\u03c8\u2032v\u00b1 = U\u00b1\u03c8v\u00b1, (32)\nhere U+ = diag(e \u2212i\u03b8/2, e\u2212i\u03b8/2, ei\u03b8/2, ei\u03b8/2) and U\u2212 = U\u2217+. It is obvious that the new wave functions \u03c8 \u2032 v\u00b1 is antiperiodic, the corresponding Hamiltonian can be obtained as H \u2032v\u00b1 = U\u00b1H\u03bdU \u22121 \u00b1 , which reads\nH \u2032v+ = H \u2032 v\u2212 = [vF (kx\u03c3y \u2212 ky\u03c3x)\u2212 \u00b5]\u03c4z +\u22060\u03c4x. (33)\nEq. (33) has the same form with Eq. (34) when B = 0. So its proved that the bound state in our 0\u2212\u03c0 disk junction is equivalent to the vortex condition, the difference is that in our 0\u2212 \u03c0 disk junction model the time-reversal symmetry is preserved so that the Majorana mode is a helical mode instead of a chiral mode. That can also be reflected by the numerical calculated results.\n13\nSOLUTION OF MAJORANA ZERO MODE\nAnalytic solution\nThe Hamiltonian of a magnetic field applied to a superconductor with a Dirac-type topological surface state can be expressed as H = \u222b d2r\u03a8\u2020(r)H\u03a8(r), where\nH = [vF (kx\u03c3y \u2212 ky\u03c3x)\u2212 \u00b5] \u03c4z + \u03b1 \u03c3 \u00b7B+\u2206(r)\u03c4x. (34)\nHere \u03a8 = (c\u2191, c\u2193, c \u2020 \u2193,\u2212c \u2020 \u2191) denotes the Nambu basis, \u03c3i and \u03c4i (i = x, y, z) are Pauli matrices but spans spin and Nambu space respectively, \u2206(r) takes the real value due to no superconducting vortex. B(r) is the external magnetic field B = (Bx, By, Bz). Due to the existence of impurity, translation invariance is broken. Thus we need to solve Eq. (1) in real space with cylindrical coordinate system, and we have following transformation:\nkx \u2212 iky = \u2212ie\u2212i\u03b8\u2202r \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8\nr \u2202\u03b8\nkx + iky = \u2212iei\u03b8\u2202r + ei\u03b8\nr \u2202\u03b8\nSubstituting it into Eq. (1), we get the complete form BdG Hamiltonian as\n\n  \n\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212e\u2212i\u03b8vF (\u2202r \u2212 ir\u2202\u03b8) \u2206(r) 0 ei\u03b8vF (\u2202r + i r\u2202\u03b8) \u2212\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5 0 \u2206(r)\n\u2206(r) 0 \u03b1Bz + \u00b5 e \u2212i\u03b8vF (\u2202r \u2212 ir\u2202\u03b8)\n0 \u2206(r) \u2212ei\u03b8vF (\u2202r + ir\u2202\u03b8) \u2212\u03b1Bz + \u00b5\n\n   . (35)\nHere, we assume the magnetic field is along the z direction. The BdG equation is\nH\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = E\u03c8(r, \u03b8). (36)\nAssuming the trivial wave function with the antiperiodic boundary condition has the form\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = eil\u03b8\n\n   e\u2212i\u03b8/2u\u2191(r) ei\u03b8/2u\u2193(r) e\u2212i\u03b8/2v\u2193(r) \u2212ei\u03b8/2v\u2191(r)    \n(37)\nThen we can obtain the radial equation of Eq. (36) as:\n(\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5)u\u2191(r) \u2212 vF (\u2202r + l + 12 r )u\u2193(r) + \u2206(r)v\u2193(r) = Eu\u2191(r) (38) vF (\u2202r \u2212 l \u2212 12 r )u\u2191(r) \u2212 [\u03b1Bz + \u00b5]u\u2193(r)\u2212\u2206(r)v\u2191(r) = Eu\u2193(r) (39) \u2206(r)u\u2191(r) + (\u03b1Bz + \u00b5)v\u2193(r) \u2212 vF (\u2202r + l + 12 r )v\u2191(r) = Ev\u2193(r) (40) \u2206(r)u\u2193(r) \u2212 vF (\u2202r \u2212 l \u2212 12 r )v\u2193(r) + (\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5)v\u2191(r) = \u2212Ev\u2191(r) (41)\nThe matrix form is :\n\n  \n\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212vF (\u2202r + \u03bd+1r ) \u2206(r) 0 vF (\u2202r \u2212 \u03bdr ) \u2212\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5 0 \u2206(r)\n\u2206(r) 0 \u03b1Bz + \u00b5 vF (\u2202r + \u03bd+1 r )\n0 \u2206(r) \u2212vF (\u2202r \u2212 \u03bdr ) \u2212\u03b1Bz + \u00b5\n\n   , (42)\n14\nwhere \u03bd = l \u2212 12 . The Majorana solution requests C\u03c8(r, \u03b8) = \u03b7\u03c8(r, \u03b8), where the particle-hole operator C = \u03c4y\u03c3yK, with K the complex conjugation operator, and \u03b7 is some constant. Without loss of generality, we assume u\u2191(\u2193)(r) and v\u2191(\u2193)(r) is real. This yields the following constraint condition:\nu\u2191(r) = \u03b7v\u2191(r) (43)\nu\u2193(r) = \u03b7v\u2193(r) (44)\nl = 0 (45)\nObviously, \u03b7 can only be +1 or \u22121, and they correspond to the exponential increase and decay solution, respectively. For an infinite large 2D space, only \u03b7 = \u22121 is reasonable. And then the equation set of Eq. (38)-(41) can be reduced as\n(\u03b1Bz \u2212 \u00b5)u\u2191(r) \u2212 [ vF (\u2202r + 1\n2r ) + \u2206(r)\n]\nu\u2193(r) = Eu\u2191(r), (46)\n[\nvF (\u2202r + 1\n2r ) + \u2206(r)\n]\nu\u2191(r) \u2212 [\u03b1Bz + \u00b5]u\u2193(r) = Eu\u2193(r), (47)\nFor the Majorana condition, we can set E = 0. Now, let\u2019s check the simplest condition where Bz = 0, which means there is no magnetic effect and then the system should return to the TI+SC model, however with a antiperiodic boundary condition. When Bz = 0, Eq. (12) and (13) can be reduced to :\nu\u2032\u2032\u2191(\u2193)(r) + u\u2032\u2191(\u2193)(r)\nr + ( \u00b52 +\u220620 v2F \u2212 1 4r2 )u\u2191(\u2193)(r) + 2\u22060 vF\n[\nu\u2032\u2191(\u2193)(r) + 1\n2r u\u2191(\u2193)(r)\n]\n= 0 (48)\nThe solution of u\u2191(r) is\nu\u2191(r) = c1 e\u2212ikF r\u221a\nr e\u2212r/\u03be0 + c2 eikF r\u221a r e\u2212r/\u03be0 (49)\nu\u2193(r) = \u2212i(c1 e\u2212ikF r\u221a\nr \u2212 c2 eikF r\u221a r )e\u2212r/\u03be0 (50)\nwhere \u03be0 = vF \u03be0 , kF = \u00b5 vF . Note that c1 should equal to c2 to ensure u(r) is real, and then the radial wave functions can be reduced as u\u2191/\u2193(r) \u221d J\u22131/2(kF r)e\u2212r/\u03be0 , by contrast with the vortex condition the order of Bessel function has a 12 shift. Note that we have obtain one zero energy mode solution as shown in Eqs. 37, 49 and 50. However, the Hamiltonian in Eq. 34 has the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) when Bz = 0. Therefore, there must exist another zero-energy mode, which is the TRS partner of the first one denoted by Eqs. 37, 49 and 50. Both of them form the Kramers degenerate states. The TRS operator takes the form T = i\u03c40\u03c3yK. When the magnetic field B = (Bx, By, Bz) is taken into account, the Hamiltonian for the zero modes in Eq. 42 can be expressed as\nHzero = (\u2212i\u03c3yT\u0302 (r) + \u03b1Bx\u03c3x + \u03b1By\u03c3y + \u03b1Bz\u03c3z)\u03c4z +\u2206(r)\u03c4x (51)\nHere, T\u0302 (r) = vF (\u2202r + 1 2r ). In such a case, one can define a mirror symmetry Ml=0 = i\u03c3y\u03c4yO\u0302(r). O\u0302(r) is a spacial inverse operator along the radial direction with the inverse center at R0. Note that T\u0302 (r) and \u2206(r) changes sign under the operation O\u0302(r). Now, one can get [Ml=0, Hzero] = 0 for non-zero Bx and Bz. For non-zero By, [Ml=0, Hzero] 6= 0. Therefore, a pair of zero modes are robust against non-zero Bx and Bz, but are fragile for non-zero By. When Bz 6= 0, we set mz = \u03b1Bz, the Zeeman term has the form of mz\u03c40\u03c3z, and the spliting between two zero energy modes can be estimated by\n\u3008\u03c81(r, \u03b8)|mz\u03c40\u03c3z |\u03c82(r, \u03b8)\u3009 = 0 (52)\nTherefore, the z-direction Zeeman coupling cannot split the zero-energy mode. However, if we directly solve the Eq. 46 and 47 with Bz 6= 0, one can find that only parameter kF is modified as kF = \u221a \u00b52\u2212m2z vF\n. It is easy to find that if |mz| > |\u00b5| the wave function is divergent when r \u2192 \u221e. Actually, only when \u00b5 > mz it\u2019s topological nontrivial.\n15\nQuasiparticle\u2019s scattering\nFrom Eq. (49) and (50), it\u2019s easy to find that the wave functions of Majorana modes can always be divided into two parts according to its radial propagating directions, i.e. towards or dorsad the impurity center. We define e\u2212ikF r as a converging wave. Here the scattering effect caused by the impurity should be considered. In a 2D space where the rotation symmetry is preserved, the scattering wave function should be described by the cylindrical wave. The scattering process can be understood as Fig. 13, we name the wave functions of incoming and scattering as \u03c8in and \u03c8s, respectively, their specific form is :\n\u03c8in = C e\u2212ikF r\u221a\nr er/\u03be0 (r < R0) (53)\n\u03c8s = f(\u03b8) eikr\u221a r , (54)\n16\nwhere f(\u03b8) is the scattering amplitude, and the scattering interface is defined as \u03c3(\u03b8) = |f(\u03b8)|2 [11]. The incoming and scattering current density can be defined by the following formula\nj = i~\n2m (\u03c8\u2207\u03c8\u2217 \u2212 \u03c8\u2217\u2207\u03c8). (55)\nSo the specific expression of the scattering wave function should be solved from the flow conservation and Schro\u0308dinger equation :\njin = js (56)\n~ 2 2m \u22072\u03c8s + U(r)\u03c8s = E\u03c8s (57)\nwhere U(r) is the scattering potential, for a single impurity we can consider it as a local potential U(r) = U0\u03b4(r), and the elastic scattering requests E = 0 since the scattered particle is Majorana fermion. According to the method of partial, we can decompose the scattering wave function into different angular-momentum channel by using\neikr cos \u03b8 = J0(kr) + \u221e \u2211\nn=1\ninJn(kr) cosn\u03b8 (58)\nIt is known that for a local \u03b4 potential, only s wave i.e. l = 0 is involved, so it\u2019s obvious to simplify the scattering wave function as \u03c8s(r, \u03b8) = f(\u03b8)J0(kr)/ \u221a r. Thus the additional density of states (DOS) at zero energy caused by the elastic scattering is\nNs(E = 0, r, \u03b8) \u221d r|\u03c8s(r, \u03b8)|2 \u221d J20 (kr). (59)\nHere |f(\u03b8)| is approximated to a constant because \u222b 2\u03c0\n0 f(\u03b8)d\u03b8 = constant. Considering this modulation about zero-\nenergy DOS, we obtain\nN(E = 0, r) = N0s J 2 0 (kr) +N 0 M (r) (60)\n17\nNumerical Solution\nNow we use Bessel functions as a complete orthogonal base to expand the wave function [12]. That is\nu\u2191(r) = N \u2211\nn=1\nu\u2191n\u03d5\u03bd,n(r) (61)\nu\u2193(r) = N \u2211\nn=1\nu\u2193n\u03d5\u03bd+1,n(r) (62)\nv\u2193(r) = N \u2211\nn=1\nv\u2193n\u03d5\u03bd+1,n(r) (63)\nv\u2191(r) = N \u2211\nn=1\nv\u2191n\u03d5\u03bd,n(r) (64)\nwhere \u03bd = l \u2212 12 , \u03d5\u03bd,n = \u221a 2\nRJ\u03bd+1(j\u03bd,n r R )J\u03bd(j\u03bd,n\nr R ), N is the cutoff number. Then the radial equation Eq. 42 can be\nreduced as a 4N \u00d7 4N matrix and the its eigenvalues are the energies. We define:\nT \u03bdij = \u03b1\n\u222b R\n0\nBz\u03d5\u03bd,i(r)\u03d5\u03bd,j(r)rdr (65)\nV \u03bd,\u03bd+1ij = vF\n\u222b R\n0\nr\u03d5\u03bd,i(r)(\u2202r + \u03bd + 1\nr )\u03d5\u03bd+1,j(r)dr (66)\nS\u03bd+1,\u03bdij = vF\n\u222b R\n0\nr\u03d5\u03bd+1,i(r)(\u2202r \u2212 \u03bd\nr )\u03d5\u03bd,j(r)dr (67)\n\u2206\u03bdij =\n\u222b R\n0\n\u2206(r)\u03d5\u03bd,i(r)\u03d5\u03bd,j(r)rdr (68)\nHere, the order parameter varies in the space can be approximately calculated as \u2206(r) = \u22060(1\u2212\u03b1 1\u2212cos(2kF r)k2 F r2 ). Then the eigenvalue equation can be expressed as :\nDet\n\n   T \u03bd \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212V \u03bd,\u03bd+1 \u2206\u03bd 0 S\u03bd+1,\u03bd \u2212T \u03bd+1 \u2212 \u00b5 0 \u2206\u03bd+1 \u2206\u03bd 0 T \u03bd + \u00b5 V \u03bd+1,\u03bd\n0 \u2206\u03bd+1 \u2212S\u03bd,\u03bd+1 \u2212T \u03bd+1 + \u00b5\n\n   = E (69)\nTo get the numerical results, we have set the radius of the disk as R = 800 A\u030a, the Fermi velocity vF = 200 meV A\u030a as the experimental measurement [13], \u00b5 = 1 meV and the cut-off number N = 50 which is accurate enough to affirm the Majorana zero-energy mode. The results are shown in Fig. 15.\n18\nThe Majorana condition requests that C\u03c8 = \u03b7\u03c8, in the main text we choose \u03b7 = \u22121 because we adopt a infinite large diameter of the disk and if \u03b7 = 1 the wave functions have an exponentially increasing form, which is not physical. However if the diameter is finite, \u03b7 = 1 would be reasonable and forms another probability-density peak at the boundary. Thus the zero-energy solution should be a linear combination of \u03b7 = \u00b11 as\n\u03c8 = \u2211\n\u03b7\na\u03b7\u03d5\u03b7. (70)\nAnd that is the reason why every zero-energy mode contains both the core and edge state. In the line-type 0 \u2212 \u03c0 junction, the gapless bound state has energy dispersion as E = \u00b1vFky . When the line is bent to form a ring, the energy becomes discrete and can be estimated by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantized condition, which is :\nEn = \u00b1vFkn (71) kn2\u03c0R0 = 2n\u03c0 (n = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) (72)\nThus the mini gap is \u2206E = vF /R0. With a large Fermi velocity and a small radius of the \u03c0-phase area, the bound states except zero-energy Majorana mode are hidden in the ground state.\n\u2217 Electronic address: zhang\u02d9ping@iapcm.ac.cn \u2020 Electronic address: haon@hmfl.ac.cn\n[1] G.
