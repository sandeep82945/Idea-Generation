1. **Investigate the feasibility of using smart insoles to conduct the SPPB in different populations:** 
This study focused on a relatively healthy population, so it would be valuable to examine the accuracy and reliability of the SPPB-SI in individuals with various health conditions, such as frailty, mobility impairments, or neurological disorders.


2. **Develop and validate an automated algorithm for analyzing plantar pressure graphs:** 
The current study relied on manual interpretation of plantar pressure graphs, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Developing an automated algorithm could improve the efficiency and objectivity of the SPPB-SI.


3. **Explore the use of smart insoles for continuous monitoring of lower extremity function:** 
Smart insoles can collect data continuously, which could be used to track changes in lower extremity function over time. This information could be valuable for monitoring disease progression, assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and providing personalized feedback to individuals.


4. **Investigate the potential of smart insoles for fall risk assessment and prevention:** 
Plantar pressure data can provide insights into balance and gait patterns, which are important factors in fall risk. Future studies could examine the use of smart insoles to identify individuals at risk of falls and to develop interventions to prevent falls.


5. **Explore the use of smart insoles for rehabilitation and exercise:** 
Smart insoles could be used to provide real-time feedback on gait and balance during rehabilitation exercises. This feedback could help individuals improve their movement patterns and optimize their rehabilitation outcomes.
