This study could help to identify metal dopants that can further improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.


2. **Explore the use of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for the degradation of other types of pollutants.** This could include pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. This study could help to expand the range of applications for g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and demonstrate their potential for use in water and wastewater treatment.


3. **Investigate the stability and reusability of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.** This could be done by conducting long-term photocatalytic experiments and by testing the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based materials after multiple cycles of use. This study could help to determine the stability and reusability of these materials and their potential for practical applications.


4. **Develop g-C3N4-based photocatalysts with enhanced visible light absorption.** This could be done by modifying the structure of g-C3N4 or by incorporating other materials that can enhance visible light absorption. This study could help to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation and expand its potential applications.


5. **Investigate the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of dyes by g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study could help to elucidate the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation and identify the key factors that affect the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4-based materials.
