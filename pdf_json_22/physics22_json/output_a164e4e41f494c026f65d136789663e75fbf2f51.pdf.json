Using a transport model simulation of isobar collisions, we quantify this claim from the dependence of the ratios v2,Ru/v2,Zr and v3,Ru/v3,Zr on various final state effects, such as the shear viscosity, hadronization and hadronic cascade. Although the v2 and v3 change by more than 50% when varying the final state effects, the ratios are unchanged. In addition, these ratios are independent of the transverse momentum pT and hadron species, despite of up to a factor of two change in vn. The ratio of mean transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9 is found to be controlled by the nuclear skin and nuclear radius, but is only slightly impacted by the final state effects. Therefore, these isobar ratios serve as a clean probe of the initial condition of the quark-gluon plasma, which in turn is controlled by the collective structure of the colliding nuclei.",

            "text": "Ratios of collective flow observables in high-energy isobar collisions are insensitive to final state interactions\nChunjian Zhang,1, \u2217 Somadutta Bhatta,1 and Jiangyong Jia1, 2, \u2020\n1Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA 2Physics Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11976, USA\n(Dated: September 1, 2022)\nThe ratios of bulk observables, such as harmonic flow v2 and v3, between high-energy 96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr collisions were recently argued to be a clean probe of the nuclear structure differences between 96Ru and 96Zr. Using a transport model simulation of isobar collisions, we quantify this claim from the dependence of the ratios v2,Ru/v2,Zr and v3,Ru/v3,Zr on various final state effects, such as the shear viscosity, hadronization and hadronic cascade. Although the v2 and v3 change by more than 50% when varying the final state effects, the ratios are unchanged. In addition, these ratios are independent of the transverse momentum pT and hadron species, despite of up to a factor of two change in vn. The ratio of mean transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9 is found to be controlled by the nuclear skin and nuclear radius, but is only slightly impacted by the final state effects. Therefore, these isobar ratios serve as a clean probe of the initial condition of the quark-gluon plasma, which in turn is controlled by the collective structure of the colliding nuclei.\nPACS numbers: 25.75.Gz, 25.75.Ld, 25.75.-1\nIntroduction. The success of the hydrodynamic framework of heavy-ion collisions enabled quantitative extractions of the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as for instance done in the state-of-the-art multi-system Bayesian analysis approaches [1\u20133]. Such extractions rely on a correct description of the initial condition of the QGP prior to the hydrodynamic expansion. The initial condition, e.g. its energy density distribution, is generated from the two colliding nuclei with simple scaling ansazes in Glauber model or Glauber-inspired models, which often assume spherical nuclei described by a two-parameter Fermi function [4, 5]. Recent experimental data [6\u201311] and dedicated theoretical studies [12\u2013 26], however, have indicated the importance of nuclear deformations and nuclear radial distributions of proton and neutrons in the nucleus, on the measured multiplicity distribution and collective flow. For a precision study of the properties and initial condition of QGP, the impact of and relations to these collective nuclear structure effects should be quantified, especially since all species used in high-energy nuclear collisions are expected to present some deformations and some uncertainties in their radial profiles.\nThe best example highlighting the importance of collective nuclear structure, is offered by the measurements in 96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr collisions at \u221a sNN = 200 GeV by the STAR Collaboration at RHIC [27]. Ratios of many observables between 96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr are found to deviate from unity in an observable- and centrality-dependent manner, including anisotropic flow v2, v3 and charged particle multiplicity Nch. These deviations must first originate from structure differences\n\u2217Electronic address: chun-jian.zhang@stonybrook.edu \u2020Electronic address: jiangyong.jia@stonybrook.edu\nbetween 96Ru and 96Zr, which impact the initial condition of QGP and its final state observables. Indeed, model comparison to the published vn and Nch data reveals a larger quadrupole deformation \u03b22 in\n96Ru, a larger octupole deformation \u03b23 in\n96Zr, and a larger diffusiveness value consistent with a larger neutron skin in 96Zr [24, 25]. Predictions for many other observables and their sensitivities to deformation and neutron skin have been made, such as mean transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9 [22] and its fluctuations [19], spectator neutron production [28], mixed-flow harmonics [26, 29], and vn\u2013pT correlations [14, 20, 23]. Preliminary measurements on a subset of these observables recently became available, which largely confirm these model predictions [30]. All these progresses highlight the enormous potential of using isobar collisions to improve our understanding of the initial condition of heavy ion collisions.\nBefore drawing a strong conclusion, an important question must be addressed first: \u201cTo what extent are the isobar ratios insensitive to the final state effects, including medium properties, particlization and hadronic transport?\u201d. To partially address this question, we performed a detailed investigation of the impact of the shear viscosity \u03b7/s and hadronic transport on the ratios of several observables in isobar collisions within a transport model. Our findings support the idea that the isobar ratios mainly reflect the initial condition.\nSetup. We simulate isobar collisions using the popular AMPT transport model [31], which starts with fluctuating initial conditions from a Monte Carlo Glauber model. The system evolution is modeled with strings that first melt into partons, followed by elastic partonic scatterings, parton coalescence, and hadronic scatterings. The hydrodynamic collectivity is generated mainly through elastic scatterings of partons. The specific shear viscosity \u03b7/s is controlled by the partonic cross-section \u03c3 = 9/2\u03c0\u03b12s/\u00b5 2, where \u03b1s is the QCD coupling constant\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n01 94\n3v 2\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 3\n1 A\nug 2\n02 2\n2 and \u00b5 is the screening mass. For a system of two massless quark flavors at initial temperature T , the \u03b7/s can be estimated using the following pocket formula [32],\n\u03b7 s \u2248 3\u03c0\n40\u03b12s\n1\n(9 + \u00b5 2 T 2 ) ln ( 18+\u00b5 2/T 2 \u00b52/T 2 ) \u2212 18\n(1)\nFollowing our previous work [24], we use the AMPT model v2.26t5 with string-melting mode and hadronic cascade time \u03c4hc = 30 fm/c. Four different combinations of \u03b1s and \u00b5 are chosen, as listed in Table I, to give different partonic cross-section of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 10.0 mb, respectively. Among these, the default case of 3.0 mb has been shown to reproduce the Au+Au v2 data at RHIC [33]. Assuming initial temperature of T = 0.38 GeV, it would correspond to \u03b7/s value of 0.23 at early time. Correspondingly, the case of 1.5 mb gives a larger \u03b7/s value, while the cases of 6.0 and 10.0 mb give smaller \u03b7/s value [32]. The impact of the hadronic scattering is studied by reducing the hadronic cascade time from 30 fm/c to 15 fm/c. Note that the QGP is expected to spent more time at a lower temperature where the \u03b7/s value is smaller (however the perturbative formula Eq. 1 may not be applicable), and therefore the \u03b7/s values in Table I should be treated as a crude estimate. Note as well that varying partonic cross-section might also change the specific bulk viscosity, which do not impact vn but may influence \u27e8pT\u27e9 via radial flow. However, the exact values of shear and bulk viscosities are irrelevant for our study, what is important is that these choices significantly change the predicted vn, and therefore allow us to check the stability of the isobar ratios.\nThe spatial distribution of nucleons in the 96Ru and 96Zr nuclei is described by a deformed Woods-Saxon (WS) function,\n\u03c1(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\u221d 1\n1 + e[r\u2212R0(1+\u03b22Y 0 2 (\u03b8,\u03c6)+\u03b23Y 03 (\u03b8,\u03c6))]/a0\n, (2)\nwith four parameters: quadrupole deformation \u03b22, octupole deformation \u03b23, surface diffuseness a0 and halfdensity nuclear radius R0. The parameter values for 96Ru\nand 96Zr are chosen to be identical as our previous studies [21, 24] and they are listed in Table I. In addition, we also simulate three intermediate cases whose parameter values are chosen such that we can separate the influence of each parameter.\nThe flow harmonics vn for n = 2 and 3 are calculated from the generated AMPT events using the standard twoparticle correlation method,\n\u27e8v2n\u27e9 = \u27e8\u27e8e in(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j)\u27e9\u27e9 , (3)\nwhere \u27e8\u27e8\u27e9\u27e9 represents the average over unique pairs in each event, and then over all events in an event class. To enhance the statistical precision, all hadrons within the pseudorapidity range \u2223\u03b7\u2223 < 2 and transverse momentum range 0.2 < pT < 2 GeV/c are used. These particles are also used to calculate the average transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9. Following the STAR data analysis [27], Nch in each event is defined as the number of charged particles within \u2223\u03b7\u2223 < 0.5 and pT > 0.1 GeV/c, from which we obtain the probability distribution p(Nch). The impact of shortrange non-flow correlations are studied by reporting the \u27e8v2n\u27e9 calculation using two-subevent method, i.e. by correlating particles in \u03b7 > 0 with those in \u03b7 < 0. Almost all results look the same but with larger statistical uncertainties. Therefore the default results are obtained without \u2206\u03b7-gap, only in the case of PID-dependence where some differences are observed, the two-subevent method is chosen as the default method.\nFor an observable O, the isobar ratio is calculated at the matching Nch between\n96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr collisions,\nRO(Nch) = ORu(Nch)\nOZr(Nch) . (4)\nNote that this ratio is slightly different from those calculated as the matching centrality due to the fact that the p(Nch) is also slightly different between the two collision systems [34]. Our previous study shows that isobar ratios are controlled by the differences in the nuclear structure parameters [21],\nRO \u2248 1 + c1\u2206\u03b2 2 2 + c2\u2206\u03b2 2 3 + c3\u2206R0 + c4\u2206a0 , (5)\nwith \u2206\u03b222 = \u03b2 2 2,Ru \u2212 \u03b2 2 2,Zr, \u2206\u03b2 2 3 = \u03b2 2 3,Ru \u2212 \u03b2 2 3,Zr, \u2206a0 = a0,Ru \u2212 a0,Zr and \u2206R0 = R0,Ru \u2212 R0,Zr. The coefficients c1\u2013c4 encode the information about how the energy from the colliding nuclei is deposited to create initial condition of QGP. We shall show that the RO are insensitive to the final state effects, and therefore the cn are robust probe of the initial condition of heavy ion collisions. Results. We first study the final state effects on the most basic observable p(Nch). Since the effect of viscosity is to enhance the entropy production during hydrodynamic evolution, the distribution p(Nch) is expected to be broader for smaller partonic cross-section or larger viscosity. Table II summarizes the average values of Nch in 0\u20135% central isobar collisions, compared with the experimental values. We found that theNch value decreases\nby about 10% from \u03c3 = 1.5 mb to 10 mb independent of centrality, implying that the impact of \u03b7/s is mostly an overall rescaling of p(Nch). The table also lists the scale factor along the x-axis required to match the \u27e8Nch\u27e9 of the data.\nFigure 1 shows the isobar ratio RNch = p(Nch)Ru/p(Nch)Zr for different cases. The ratios depend on the partonic cross-section, and they are also different from the data. But after applying the scale factors listed in Table II, all ratios from the AMPT model collapse on to a single curve, confirming that the effects of shear viscosity only amount to an overall rescaling of the Nch, but not the shape of p(Nch). Yet, all the ratios still overshoot the data in the central region, and an additional scale factor, applied on the x-axis of the data by 0.94, is required to bring RNch to match the STAR ratio. This implies that the shape of p(Nch) and ratio RNch from AMPT can not be matched to experimental data by a common scaling factor in Nch; the two factors required are off by about 6% 1. This mismatch points to a non-trivial relation between collision geometry and the particle production mechanism, but exact mechanism requires more studies. In the following discussion, the first scale factors are always applied to the AMPT results before comparing with each other.\nIn the picture of hydrodynamic, harmonic flow v2 and v3 are driven by the initial state eccentricities \u03b52 and \u03b53, respectively: vn = kn\u03b5n [35]. The response coefficients kn, encoding all final state effects, are function of centrality\n1 The Nch in the experimental data is not corrected by tracking efficiency which usually has the form = a + bNch. This leads to a Nch-dependent rescaling of p(Nch) and RNch along the x-axis by an identical factor, which would not remove the discrepancy seen in the middle panel.\nbut otherwise are the same for events in the same centrality class. The kn are also strong function of pT and depends on the mass of the hadrons. Therefore the sensitivity of the isobar ratio to the final state is reflected by the ratio of kn between 96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr\n4\ncollisions:\nvn,Ru vn,Zr = kn,Ru kn,Ru \u03b5n,Ru \u03b5n,Ru \u00d4\u21d2 Rvn = RknR\u03b5n (6)\nOne expect Rkn = kn,Ru/kn,Zr \u2248 1 for isobar collisions with the same Nch.\nThe impact of partonic cross-section and hadronic cascade time on v2 and v3 are studied in Fig. 2. Varying the cross-section changes the v2 by up to 30% and v3 by up to 50%. However the Rvn are almost unchanged, implying that the isobar ratios of harmonic flow are insensitive to the medium properties in the final state. Only a small visible deviation of the scaling is observed in the midcentral collisions for Rv2 in the 1.5 mb case. That is the region, where the Rv2 is dominated by the nuclear structure parameter a0 [24]. Changing the hadronic cascade time has negligible impact on vn and Rvn .\nFigures 3 and 4 display the vn and Rvn for three pT ranges and two hadron types, respectively. The values of vn are dramatically different among these different cases but the ratios are remarkably stable. The lack of pT dependence also implies that the Rvn are insensitive to the non-equilibrium effects such as the so-called \u03b4f correction [36], while the similarity between meson and baryon implies that Rvn are insensitive to partonic coalescence at hadronization and hadronic transport 2.\nWe also investigated the impact of nuclear structure on \u27e8pT\u27e9. We first performed a separate study where we isolate the contribution of each nuclear structure parameter similar to our previous study on vn [21]. As shown in Fig 5, \u03b22 and \u03b23 have little impact on the R\u27e8pT\u27e9. In contrast, a significant enhancement of the R\u27e8pT\u27e9 of about 0.2% is observed in mid-central collision associated with the fact that a0,Ru > a0,Zr. But a large part of this enhancement, especially in central collisions, is cancelled by\n2 Result in Fig. 4 is obtained using two-suevent method where the particles in the pair are taken from different \u03b7 region. However, the vn ratios without \u2206\u03b7 gap do show some differences between meson-meson correlation and baryon-baryon correlation, suggesting that short-range correlations induced by parton coalescence may influence the PID dependence of Rvn .\nthe fact that R0,Ru < R0,Zr. The enhancement of R\u27e8pT\u27e9 after considering all four structure parameters produce a maximum enhancement of 0.15% around Nch = 80 or 35% centrality. The centrality dependence trends are similar\n5 to the recent STAR preliminary measurement [30], but the magnitude is about a factor of three smaller. This is mainly due to the much weaker radial flow response to the size fluctuations in the AMPT model [19]. Thus the AMPT results shown here can only be used for qualitative guidance 3.\nFigure 6 displays the \u27e8pT\u27e9 and isobar ratio for different partonic cross-sections. Increasing the partonic cross-section increases the value of \u27e8pT\u27e9, and suggesting a stronger radial flow associated with larger pressure gradients. The R\u27e8pT\u27e9 values are somewhat sensitive to viscosity, especially in the peripheral region. The appar-\nent weaker dependence observed in a previous study [22] is because that study only varies \u03b7/s within 0.04\u20130.16, while our AMPT study varies \u03b7/s in a much larger range of 0.09\u20130.39. Clearly the nuclear structure influence on \u27e8pT\u27e9 is not entirely free of final state effects. However, the \u27e8pT\u27e9 is dominated by physics unrelated to QGP. In fact, only a small fraction, about 20% of \u27e8pT\u27e9 in A+A collisions accounting for the increase of \u27e8pT\u27e9 from peripheral to central collisions, can be associated with genuine radial flow. This is different from vn, which vanishes without final state interactions. So the modest sensitivity of R\u27e8pT\u27e9 to viscosity may be attributed to modification of the component unrelated to collective flow by the final state interactions. On the other hand, changing the hadronic transport time from 30 fm/c to 15 fm/c influences the value of \u27e8pT\u27e9 but give nearly identical R\u27e8pT\u27e9.\nSummary. We studied the impact of final state interactions on the elliptic flow v2, triangular flow v3, mean transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9 and charged particle multiplicity distribution p(Nch) and the ratios between 96Ru+96Ru and 96Zr+96Zr collisions at \u221a sNN = 200 GeV within the AMPT framework. The deviation of these ratios from unity are related to difference of collective nuclear structure between Ru and Zr nucleus, in terms of quadrupole deformation \u03b22, octupole deformation \u03b23, nuclear skin a0 and nuclear radius R0.\nWe found that the distribution p(Nch) is rescaled by a constant factor when varying shear viscosity, but the shape of ratio p(Nch)Ru/p(Nch)Zr remains unchanged. The values of vn vary by up to 50% when changing shear viscosity, but the ratios vn,Ru/vn,Zr remain almost the same. Furthermore, the numerical values of vn,Ru/vn,Zr are also found to be nearly identical between different pT ranges, as well as between the mesons and baryons. We also carried out a detailed investigation of the nuclear structure influence on the ratio of average transverse momentum \u27e8pT\u27e9Ru / \u27e8pT\u27e9Zr. This ratio is enhanced by the sharper skin of 96Ru i.e. a0,Ru < a0,Zr, but then is partially compensated by a larger radius of 96Ru i.e. R0,Ru > R0,Zr. On the other hand, the nuclear deformations have very little influence except in the ultra-central collision region. The values of \u27e8pT\u27e9Ru / \u27e8pT\u27e9Zr are only slightly influenced by the viscosity and do not depend on the hadronic cascade time. These findings prove that the ratios of bulk observables in isobar collisions, in particular v2 and v3, are unique probe of the nuclear structure difference between isobar nuclei, and therefore provide a unique lever-arm to study the relation between nuclear structure and initial condition of the heavy ion collisions.\nAcknowledgement.
