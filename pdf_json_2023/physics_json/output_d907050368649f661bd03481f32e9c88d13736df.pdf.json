    "abstractText": "Prenylated flavonoids are a special kind of flavonoid derivative possessing one or more prenyl groups in the parent nucleus of the flavonoid. The presence of the prenyl side chain enriched the structural diversity of flavonoids and increased their bioactivity and bioavailability. Prenylated flavonoids show a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-cancer, antiinflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, cardioprotective effects, and anti-osteoclastogenic activities. In recent years, many compounds with significant activity have been discovered with the continuous excavation of the medicinal value of prenylated flavonoids, and have attracted the extensive attention of pharmacologists. This review summarizes recent progress on research into natural active prenylated flavonoids to promote new discoveries of their medicinal value.",

            "text": "Prenylated flavonoids are a special type of flavonoid derivative that is characteristic of modified by prenylation of the skeleton. Prenylation refers to alkyl-substituent groups, such as prenyl, geranyl, lavandulyl, and farnesyl groups, which have more potential for further modification, such as oxidation, cyclization, and hydroxylation, and enrich the structural and biological diversity of prenylated flavonoids (Shi et\u00a0al. 2021). According to reported studies over the past decade, more than 1000 prenylated flavonoids have been discovered from natural sources.\nPrenylated flavonoids are the main active ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines and functional food resources, such as Morus alba, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Humulus lupulus, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Glycine max, and Ficus carica fruits, and are promising lead compounds or nutraceuticals due to their diverse health benefits in oncotherapy (Wen et\u00a0al. 2021), glycolipid metabolism balance (Jo et\u00a0al. 2021), and the cardiovascular system (Song et\u00a0al. 2011). Compared with nonprenylated flavonoids, prenylated flavonoids possess higher lipid solubility, an affinity for the cell membrane, and gastrointestinal absorption capacity due to the presence of prenyl groups (Ho\u0161ek et\u00a0al. 2011; Jakimiuk et\u00a0al. 2021). Therefore, prenylated flavonoids show more potential to interact with diverse cellular targets. In recent years, the biological activity of prenylated flavonoids has attracted great attention from many research teams due to their promising pharmacological properties.\nIn the present review, a total of 1036 prenylated flavonoids obtained from 127 species belonging to 62 genera of 26 families (Tables\u00a01, 2 and 3, Fig.\u00a01) during the past decade were systematically summarized. The prenylated flavonoids were classified into 6 categories (Fig.\u00a02), prenylated flavones (1-261), prenylated flavanones (262\u2013567), prenylated chalcones (568\u2013689), prenylated isoflavones (690\u2013908), prenylated flavans (909\u2013943) and isoflavans (944\u20131005), and prenylated flavonostilbenes and\n* Sheng-Qiang Tong sqtong@126.com\n* Xing-Nuo Li li_xingnuo@163.com\n1 College of\u00a0Pharmaceutical Science & Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of\u00a0TCM for\u00a0Innovative R&D and\u00a0Digital Intelligent Manufacturing of\u00a0TCM Great Health Products & Key Laboratory of\u00a0Marine Fishery Resources Exploitment & Utilization of\u00a0Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University of\u00a0Technology, 310014\u00a0Hang\u00a0zhou, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China\n2 Research Center of\u00a0Analysis and\u00a0Measurement, Zhejiang University of\u00a0Technology University, 310014\u00a0Hang\u00a0Zhou, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China\n3 School of\u00a0Pharmacy, Youjiang Medical University for\u00a0Nationalities, 533000\u00a0Baise, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China\n1 3\nbiflavonoids (1006\u20131036) according to their structural features (Fig.\u00a03). Fabaceae, Moraceae, and Euphorbiaceae are the three leading families with abundant prenylflavonoids. The biosynthesis of prenylated flavonoids, preliminary active screening results, structure-activity relationships (SARs), and mechanism of active prenylated flavonoids were also summarized, aiming to provide an overview of natural, active prenylated flavonoids and their pharmacological properties."

            "text": "In general, prenylated flavonoid biosynthesis in plant can conveniently be divided into three stages: (a) formation of the C6\u2013C3\u2013C6 skeleton (Fig.\u00a04a). l-phenylalanine or l-tyrosine was used to produce 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which can be combined with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to yield the chalcone backbone. (b) biosynthesis of the different classes of flavonoids (Fig.\u00a04b). Chalcones are\n1 3\n1 3\nproved to be the precursors to other subclasses of flavonoids and can be catalyzed by chalcone flavanone isomerase to obtain the basic skeleton of flavonoid which continues through a series of enzymatic modifications to yield flavones, flavans, isoflavones, and so on. (c) biosynthesis of the prenylated flavonoids (Figs.\u00a05 and 6). Prenyltransferases are the key catalytic enzyme for prenylated modification of the flavonoids and have been attracting increasing attention due to greatly contributing to the structural diversity of flavonoids. The reaction catalyzed by prenyltransferases represents a Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation of the flavonoid skeleton in the biosynthesis of natural prenylflavonoids. Most of the prenyltransferases exhibit strict substrate specificity and low catalytic efficiency. Metal ion, especially Mg2+, is required for the catalytic activity. Up to now, only a few flavonoid prenyltransferases have been identified. The general characteristic of flavonoid prenyltransferases discovered from natural sources was summarized in Table\u00a04.."

            "text": "Prenylated flavonoids were found to possess more potential cytotoxicity against various cancer cells due to the introduction of the prenyl side chain on the flavonoid skeleton which enhances the binding affinity of flavonoids toward P-glycoprotein. 2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-(3-methyl-but-2enyl)-chroman-4-one (1) (Fig.\u00a07) isolated from Artocarpus heterophyllus and displaying strong cytotoxic effect against MCF-7, A-549, SW480, and HL-60 cells, with IC50 values ranging from 1.03 to 5.28 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2020). Licoflavone C (3), also called 4\u2032,5,7-trihydroxy-8-prenylflavone (Ye et\u00a0al. 2021), was identified in Ficus hirta, Retama raetam, and Morus alba. It exhibited cytotoxicity against HL-60, HepG2, A549, and NCI-H292 cells with IC50 values ranging from 7.0 to 13.85 \u00b5M (Qin et\u00a0al. 2015a; Li et\u00a0al. 2018). Three prenylated flavonols (5, 139, and 164) were isolated from leaves of Macaranga barteri and showed antiproliferative activity against four human cancer cell lines, MCF-7, A549, PC-3, and HeLa cells. Broussoflavonol F (164) displayed the highest cytotoxicity against these four human cancer cell lines with IC50 value of 3.83\u20134.13 \u00b5M. While 8-prenylkaempferol (5) lacks the C-3\u2032 prenyl side chain on the B ring had a slight lower cytotoxicity (IC50 value of 6.22\u20136.88 \u00b5M) than 164. Isomacarangin (139) bearing a geranyl group in position C-8 also led to a slight reduction in antiproliferative activity (IC50 value of 8.43\u20138.72 \u00b5M) (Segun et\u00a0al. 2019).\nNine prenylated flavonoids, isolated from the fruits of Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, were tested for their cytotoxicity against human breast-cancer T47D cells in\u00a0vitro. Sinopodophylline B (10), 6-prenylquercetin 3-methyl ether (71), topazolin (72), and 5, 7, 4\u2032-trihydroxy-3\u2032-(3-methylbut2-enyl)-3-methoxy flavone (104) showed cytotoxicity against\n1 3\nT47D cells with IC50 values of 1.5, 6.3, 11.9, and 2.0 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas sinopodophyllines C (197) and D (219) exhibited weak cytotoxicity against T47D cells with IC50 values of 46.0 and 36.8 \u00b5M. It suggested that 3\u2032-hydroxyl group on the B ring and unmodified monoprenyl side chain promote the cytotoxicity, and the cyclization of the prenyl side chain would decrease the cytotoxicity (Wang et\u00a0al. 2017c)0.5,7,3\u2032,5\u2032-Tetramethoxy-6-C-prenylflavone (61), 6-(3-methyl-(E)-1-butenyl) chrysin (79), bracteflavone B (80), and dinklagin C (81), from Artocarpus heterophyllus displayed strong cytotoxic effects against MCF-7, A-549, SMMC-7721, SW480, and HL-60 cells with IC50 values ranging from 1.46 to 16.26 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2020).\n72 and licoflavonol (73), isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, exhibited cytotoxicities against SW480 cells with IC50\nvalues of 14.53 and 8.23 \u00b5M, respectively (Tang et\u00a0al. 2016). Most prenylflavonoids isolated from the twigs of Artocarpus nigrifolius exhibited cytotoxicity against SiHa and SGC-7901 cells. 6-Prenyl-4\u2032,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (64) showed inhibitory activity against SiHa (IC50 value of 13.3) and SGC-7901(IC50 value of 9.6). Comparing the structures of 64 and artocarpesin (65), it suggested that the hydroxyl group of C-2\u2032 on the B ring would dramatically decrease cytotoxicity. Eleocharin A (84) showed strong cytotoxicity against SiHa and SGC-7901 cells with IC50 values of 0.7 and 8.3 \u00b5M, respectively. The inhibitory activities of two structurally similar analogues, 5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-3\u2032-methoxy-(6:7)-2,2-dimethylpyrano-flavone (85) and carpachromenol (86), declined sharply against both two cell lines, which revealed the 3\u2032-methoxyl group was\n1 3\nunfavorable, but the 3\u2032-hydroxyl maybe was crucial for the antiproliferative activity (Liu et\u00a0al. 2018b).\nSinoflavonoid U (91) is from Sinopodophyllum hexandrum and exhibited cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells with IC50 values of 6.25 and 3.83 \u00b5M, respectively. However, Sinoflavonoid T (90) possessing the same B and C rings from flavone skeleton as 91 displayed no cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines, which suggested 2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)dihydrofurano group on ring A is structurally required for the cytotoxity against the MCF-7 and HepG2 cells lines (Sun et\u00a0al. 2019). The cytotoxicity of prenylated flavonoids from the fruits of Sinopodophyllum emodi was evaluated against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells. Podoverine A (106) exhibited cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells with IC50 values of 9.50 and 2.46 \u00b5M, respectively. However, oxidation or hydroxylation of prenyl group dramatically decrease cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2. Additionally, quercetin-3-methyl ether, a nonprenylation flavone, show more potent cytotoxicity than quercetin, suggesting methoxy at C-3 may contribute to its cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 (Sun et\u00a0al. 2015).\n6,8-Diprenylkaempferol (154) displayed a strong cytotoxic effect against the H460 cell line with an IC50 value of 4.67 \u00b5M (Long et\u00a0al. 2022). 6,8-Diprenyleriodictyol (155), isolated from Derris ferruginea, showed cytotoxicity against MRC-5 and KB cells with IC50 values of 8.0 and 8.5 \u00b5M, respectively (Morel et\u00a0al. 2013).\nSeven prenylated flavonoids (6, 15, 92, 99, 162, 191, and 192) from the leaves of Epimedium Koreanum were evaluated for cytotoxic activities against lung cancer A549 and NCI-H292 cells. Baohuoside I (15), epimedokoreanin D (99), epimedokoreanin B (162), epicornuin F (191), and epicornuin B (192) of which inhibited the proliferation of A549 and NCI-292 cells with IC50 values of 5.7\u201323.5 \u00b5M. Compound 162 showed cytotoxicity against A549 and NCI-H292 cells with IC50 values of 7.90 and 5.69 \u00b5M, respectively and 191 exhibited cytotoxicity against NCI-H292 cells with an IC50 value of 6.44 \u00b5M. Compounds 191 and 192 were structurally similar to 162, only one hydroxyl substitution in one prenyl decreased the cytotoxicity. Compared to the structures of these compounds, it suggested that glycosylation of the flavonoid and hydroxylation of the prenyl group\n1 3\ndecreased the cytotoxicity of the compounds (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2020).\nA diprenylated flavonol (164) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7, A549, PC-3, and HeLa cells with IC50 values ranging from 5.40 to 5.82 \u00b5M (Segun et\u00a0al. 2019). Daphnegiravone D (165), a 3-methoxy derivative of 164, showed cytotoxic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B cells) with IC50 values of 9.89 and 1.63 \u00b5M, respectively (Wang et\u00a0al. 2017a).\nSeveral prenylated flavonoids with pyran ring at A or B ring show potential cytotoxicity against different cancer cells. Kuwanon C (166) and morusinol (207) are from Morus alba root bark and showed cytotoxicity against THP-1 human monocytic leukemic cells with IC50 values of 1.7 and 4.3 \u00b5M, respectively (Zelov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2014). Three flavonols, macarindicin E (199), macadenathin B (200), and macarindicin F (227), each bearing a pyran ring showed stronger cytotoxic activity than macarindicin D (63) and glyasperin A (168) as well as the non-prenylated flavonoids, kaempferol, quercetin, and quercitrin (Huonga et\u00a0al. 2019).\nArtonin E (202) is from the bark of Artocarpus elasticus and possessed cytotoxicities against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values of 2.6 and 13.5 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Ramli et\u00a0al. 2016). The diprenylated flavones (204, 207, and 229) exhibited cytotoxicity against A549, NCI-H292, HepG2, and Hep3B cells with IC50 values ranging from 8.91 to 29.2 \u00b5M. Morusin (204) possessing an intact prenyl side chain exhibit more potent cytotoxicity than 207 bearing a hydroxylated prenyl side chain at C-3, suggesting hydroxylation of the prenyl side chain at C-3 decreased the cytotoxicity (Li et\u00a0al. 2018; Wang et\u00a0al. 2017a).\nPaulownia tomentosa fruits are rich in geranylated flavonoids (368\u2013371, 373, 382, 385, 412, and 420) (Fig.\u00a08) which exhibited potent antiproliferative activities against THP-1 (IC50 < 10 \u00b5M). However, the non-geranylated flavonoids, 3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trimethoxyflavanone, eriodictyol, and naringenin, were inactive in comparison to flavonoids with geranyl side chains. The cytotoxic effect of geranylated flavonoids is possibly related to their lipophilicity and to their greater ability to penetrate the membranes of\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 4\nF la\nvo no\nid p\nre ny\nltr

The presence of a \u03b2-carbon (proximal) OH group on a geranyl chain (385, IC50 = 6.5 \u00b5M) did not affect the cytotoxicity, but an OH group on the distal end of the side-chain (399, IC50 > 20 \u00b5M) caused a loss of cytotoxic\neffect. The substituents on ring B of the flavonoid structure seemed to have minor effects on the cytotoxic potential of the geranylated flavonoids (Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2015). Another phytochemical study of the fruit of Paulownia\nFig. 8 Chemical structures of prenylated flavonones (262\u2013567)\n1 3\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\ntomentosa led to the isolation of twelve natural geranylated flavonoids. Two flavonoids, diplacone (374) and 3\u2032-O-methyl-5\u2032-hydroxydiplacone (375) each bearing an unmodified geranyl side chain, possessed the strongest\nantiproliferative activities against THP-1 with IC50 values of 9.31 and 12.61 \u00b5M, respectively. The geranylated flavanones exhibited significantly greater cytotoxicity than the corresponding non-geranylated flavanones, taxifolin,\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\nnaringenin, and hesperetin, which suggested that the presence of a geranyl side chain is a crucial structural requirement for the cytotoxic effect of flavanones. The addition of a methoxy group on ring B decreased the activity of tomentone B (409) as compared to tomentone II (410), and of 3\u02b9-O-methyl-5\u02b9-hydroxyisodiplacone (424) as compared to 374 (Mol\u010danov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2021). Kuwanon E (434), isolated from the roots of Morus alba, also inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 human monocytic leukemic cells with an IC50 value of 4.0 \u00b5M (Zelov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2014). In addition, 6-Farnesyl-3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavanone (449), isolated from Macaranga triloba, strongly inhibited the growth of HeLa and HL-60 cells with IC50 values of 1.3 and 3.3 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Zakaria et\u00a0al. 2012). Calycinigin A (543), a C-3\u2032 lavandulylated flavonone, exhibited an antiproliferative effect against HeLa cells with an IC50 value of 9.7 \u00b5M (Win et\u00a0al. 2012).\nSeveral diprenylated flavonones show potential antiproliferative activities against different cancer cells. 6,8-Diprenyl-4\u2032-methyl-naringenin (452), isolated from the fruits of Macaranga balansae, showed cytotoxic activity against PanC1, A549, KB, and Lu-1 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 7.89 to 22.81 \u00b5M (Mai et\u00a0al. 2020). Lonchocarpol A (457) and dorsmanine I (504) from the stems of Derris ferruginea inhibited the growth of MRC-5 and KB cells with an IC50 value range of 6.2\u201323.8 \u00b5M (Morel et\u00a0al. 2013). Maackiaflavanone (463) and 5-hydroxysophoranone (482) exhibited cytotoxicity against HeLa and SK-MEL-5 cells. The IC50 values of 463 were 8.2 and 6.5 \u00b5M, whereas the IC50 values of 482 were 12 and 7.7 \u00b5M, respectively. However, the structurally similar analogues, isomaackiaflavanone A (465), isomaackiaflavanone B (473), and abyssinone V (479), exhibit weak cytotoxicity against HeLa and SK-MEL-5 cells with IC50\nFig. 8 (continued)\n1 3\nvalue range of 16\u201336 \u00b5M suggesting that 8-prenyl side chain promotes the cytotoxicity, and methoxy at C-2\u2032 on the B ring decreased the cytotoxicity (Veselova et\u00a0al. 2017). Sanggenol Q (480), isolated from the root bark of Morus alba, showed cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an EC50 value of 6.94 \u00b5M (Jung et\u00a0al. 2015). Three diprenylated flavonoids, addisoniaflavanones I (487) and II (488) and 5,7-dihydroxy-5\u2032-prenyl-[2\u2032\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-(3\u2032\u2032-hydroxy)dimethylpyrano]-(5\u2032\u2032,6\u2032\u2032:3\u2032,4\u2032)flavanone (516) isolated from Erythrina addisoniae, showed higher toxicity to H4IIE hepatoma cells than the monoprenyl-substituted flavonoids, with EC50 values of 5.25, 8.5, and 14.7 \u00b5M, respectively. Both 487 and 488 induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and -7 activation (Passreiter et\u00a0al. 2015).\nXanthohumol (579) (Fig.\u00a09), a prenylated chalcone isolated from H. lupulus, exhibited diverse bioactivities. It exhibited cytotoxic activity against WI-38, J774, HepG2, MG-63, HT-29, and SW620 cell lines with IC50 values of 19.5, 9.6, 7.1, 29.4, 12.0, and 25.0 \u00b5M, respectively (Bocquet et\u00a0al. 2019; Harish et\u00a0al. 2021; Hudcov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2014). Two structurally similar chalcones sanjuanolide (582) and sanjoseolide (583), isolated from D. frutescens, show different cytotoxic activities against PC-3 and DU 145 prostate cancer cells. It was noted that 582 was 3.2- and 3.6- fold more potent than 583 against PC-3 and DU 145 cells, respectively. These compounds differ only by the replacement of a 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl-3-butenyl group in 583 by a 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-butanyl group in 582, which suggested the hydroxylation of prenyl side chain decrease the cytotoxicity (Shaffer et\u00a0al. 2016). 3-Hydroxy-4-methoxylonchocarpin (601) is a prenylated chalcone from the seeds of Millettia pachycarpa and exhibited cytotoxicity against K562 cells with an IC50 value of 2.4 \u00b5g/mL (Su et\u00a0al. 2012). Gemichalcone B (602) is from the twigs of Artocarpus nigrifolius and showed strong cytotoxicity against SiHa cells with an IC50 value of 8.7 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2018b).\nChalcones (607, 608, 613\u2013615, and 666\u2013670) (Figs.\u00a09 and 10) from Desmodium renifolium and D. podocarpum exhibited cytotoxicity against NB4, A549, SHSY5Y, PC3, and MCF-7 cells (Li et\u00a0al. 2014a, b; Qin et\u00a0al. 2015b). Artonin ZA-1 (607) and artonin ZA-2 (608) exhibited cytotoxicity against these human tumor cells with IC50 values ranging from 5.8 to 10 \u00b5M. Renifolin C (613) showed cytotoxicity against NB4 and PC3 cells with IC50 values of 6.4 and 8.5 \u00b5M, respectively. 2\u2032,4-Hydroxy-3,4\u2032-dimethoxychalcone (614) inhibited SHSY5Y, PC3, and NB4 cells with IC50 values of 3.8, 3.6, and 4.2 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas 2\u2032,3-hydroxy-4,4\u2032-dimethoxychalcone (615) exerted cytotoxicity against A549, PC3, and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 3.5, 6.8, and 6.2 \u00b5M, respectively. Renifolins D\u2013H (666\u2013670) each bearing a five-membered carbocycle showed cytotoxicity against these cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 2.2 to 9.7 \u00b5M.\nKanzonol C (644) and hedysarumine F (645) showed cytotoxicity against A549 cells with IC50 values of 9.67 and 7.79 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas 644 exhibited cytotoxic activity against HCT116 cells with an IC50 value of 8.85 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2018c). Flemiphilippinone C (689) bearing two prenyl moieties at C-3\u2032 was isolated from the roots of Flemingia philippinensis. It exhibited antiproliferative activity against PC-3, Bel-7402, and CaEs-17 with GI50 values of 14.12, 1.91, and 2.58 \u00b5M, respectively. Mechanistically, 689 increased S/G2 arrest and induced apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells through a mitochondria-related pathway (Kang et\u00a0al. 2016).\nGancaonin G (729) (Fig.\u00a011) is from Glycyrrhiza uralensis and exhibited cytotoxicity against SW480 cells with an IC50 value of 9.84 \u00b5M (Tang et\u00a0al. 2016). 4\u2032-Hydroxy5,7-dimethoxy-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-isoflavone (730), gancaonin N (731), isopiscerythrone (732), viridiflorin (733), and ficucaricone D (741) exhibited cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480, with IC50 values ranging from 0.42 to 8.48 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019c). Eleven prenylated isoflavones (690, 736, 749, 757, 778, 795, 796, 813, 847, 848, and 870) and two coumaronochromones (887 and 888) from the fruits of Ficus altissima were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against three human tumor cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) through MTT assay. Ficusaltin B (848), isolupalbigenin (847), and lupinalbin D (888) exhibited more effective cytotoxic activities to tested cell lines, which speculated that the prenyl substituent at C-3\u2032 of the B ring was the active group in these isolated compounds. The structurally similar analogue isowigtheone (778) bearing only one prenyl substituent at C-3\u2032 was inactivated. It suggested that the simultaneous presence of a prenyl group at C-6 or C-8 in the A ring and a prenyl group at C-3\u2032 in B ring might be essential for those prenylated isoflavones to exert obvious anti-proliferative effects. For prenylated coumaronochromones, once the position of prenyl group changed to C-6 as lupinalbin B (887), the anti-proliferative activity against tumor cell lines would significantly reduce (Yao et\u00a0al. 2021). Auriculasin (818) from the roots of Flemingia philippinensis exhibited an antiproliferative effect against PC-3 cells with a GI50 value of 8.33 \u00b5M. However, eriosematin, a chromone derivative, showed no activity (GI50 > 100 \u00b5M) which suggested B ring with 3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy group in 818 would play an important role in inhibiting the growth of PC-3 cells (Kang et\u00a0al. 2016). Flemiphilippinin G (822) and 5,7,3\u2032-trihydroxy-2\u2032-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-4\u2032,5\u2032(3,3-dimethylpyrano) isoflavone (867) showed cytotoxicity against MCF-7, A549, and HepG2 cells with IC50 values ranging from 4.8 to 24.8 \u00b5M (Fu et\u00a0al. 2012). Tephrosin (893), cis-(6a\u03b2,12a\u03b2)-hydroxyrotenone (894), and rotenone (895), isolated from Indigofera spicata, exhibited cytotoxicity against HT-29, 697 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n1 3\n1 3\n1 3\n1 3\nFig. 11 Chemical structures of prenylated isoflavones (690\u2013908)\n1 3\nand Raji human Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 9.0 \u00b5M. Additionally, 894 (IC50 0.1 \u00b5M against HT-29 cells) and 895 (IC50 0.1 \u00b5M against HT-29 cells) did not show obvious toxic effects on normal CCD112CoN cells, with IC50 values over 100 \u00b5M (Bueno Perez et\u00a0al. 2013).\nThe prenylated flavans (909, 916\u2013927, 932, and 935\u2013942) (Fig.\u00a012), isolated from the stem and root bark of Daphne giraldii, were evaluated their cytotoxicity against Hep3B cells. Among them, 919\u2013921, 926, 927, and 935\u2013937 exhibited cytotoxicity against Hep3B cells with an IC50 value range of 5.15\u20139.66 \u00b5M (Sun et\u00a0al. 2016a; Li et\u00a0al. 2016).\nBy comparing two similar flavans daphnegiravans A (917) and B (918), the presence of a methoxyl connected to the pyran ring reduced the cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Bcap37, HepG2, Hep3B, and A549). The activity of the compound possessing a 2,2-dimethylpyran was greater than that of 2, 2-dimethyldihydropyran and furan substituents according to the IC50 values of daphnegiravans K (920), J (926), and I (927). A comparison of the activity data between daphnegiravan H (925) and 926 indicated that the cyclization between the prenyl and hydroxyl moieties in ring B produced a significant improvement in the reduction of cancer cell growth. This also supported that 917 and 924\nFig. 11 (continued)\n1 3\nFig. 11 (continued)\n1 3\nwith a pyran or dihydropyran ring produced more potent inhibition than (2\u00a0S)-7,4\u2032-dihydroxy-3\u2032-prenylflavan (916) and (2\u00a0S)-kazinol I (932), respectively (Sun et\u00a0al. 2016a).\nGlyurallin A (966) (Fig.\u00a013) is from Glycyrrhiza uralensis and exhibited cytotoxicity against SW480 cells with an IC50 value of 10.86 \u00b5M (Tang et\u00a0al. 2016). Thonningine A (996), asthonningine B (997), indicanine A (998), ficucaricones A (999) and B (1000), 3\u2032\u2032,4\u2032\u2032-dihydrothonningine C (1001), and indicanine B (1004) showed promising cytotoxic effects towards five human cancer cell lines HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480, with IC50\nvalues ranging from 0.18 to 18.76 \u00b5M (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019c). Alopecurone J (1011) (Fig.\u00a014) exhibited cytotoxic activities against HeLa, HCT116, A2780, and A549 cells with IC50 values ranging from 9.97 to 30.91 \u00b5M. (Soltani et\u00a0al. 2020). Sanggenon E (1025) is from Morus nigra and showed cytotoxicity against THP-1 human monocytic leukemic cells with an IC50 value of 4.0 \u00b5M. (Zelov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2014).\nAccording to the cytotoxic activities of aforementioned compounds, the general SARs of prenylated flavonoids was summarized in Figs.\u00a015 and 16.\nFig. 11 (continued)\n1 3\nFig. 11 (continued)\n1 3\n1 3"

            "text": "Inflammation is a primary pathological process involved in the progression of various diseases. Many prenylated flavonoids exhibited promising anti-inflammatory activities and regulated the expression of various inflammatory cytokines and related proteins, such as nitric oxide (NO),\nTNF-\u03b1, interleukins (ILs), induced NO synthase (iNOS), and NF-\u03baB, etc. Anti-inflammatory effect of Epimedium grandiflorum was attributed to the presence of prenylflavonoid glycosides. The prenylated flavones desmethylicaritin (5), icariside II (15), epimedigrandioside A (21), and korepimeosides A (22) and B (23) from Epimedium grandiflorum possessed inhibitory activities against NF-\u03baB and iNOS with IC50 values ranging from 16.6 to 26.5 \u00b5M and\n1 3\n1 3\n1 3\n14.0 to 17.5 \u00b5M, respectively. Epimedoside (19), epimedokreanoside II (20), and epimedins I (40), K (41), and L (42) also exhibited inhibitory activities of iNOS with IC50 values of 14\u201330 \u00b5M, respectively, however, they did not show any effect on NF-\u03baB or transcription factor Sp-1 (Zulfiqar et\u00a0al. 2017).\nMorus alba has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine and the root bark of M. alba, named Sang-bai-pi, is listed as an important herb medicine in Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The prenylated flavones, albanin D (146), (7\u2032\u2032R)-(\u2212)-6-(7\u2032\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-dimethyl-2\u2032\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-octadien1\u2032\u2032-yl)apigenin (147), 10-oxomornigrol F (190), 204,\n1 3\n2-(2,4-dihydrophenyl)-5-hydroxy-8-(hydroxymethyl)-8methyl-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-(9CI) (205), and mulberranol (225), and one chalcone, morachalcone A (575), isolated from the twigs of Morus alba, showed inhibitory activities against NO production with IC50 values of 2.2 to 5.3 \u00b5g/mL in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Compounds 146, 147, 190, 225, and 575 reduced LPS-induced iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, compounds 146, 190, and 225 significantly suppressed LPS-induced expression of COX-2 protein (Tran et\u00a0 al. 2017). Treatments of kuwanon T (176), 204, 434, sanggenol A (435), sanggenon A (545), sanggenon M (546), and kuwanon G (1027) at a dose of 100 \u00b5g/mL strongly inhibited the production of IL-6 with the inhibition values ranging from 90.9 to 99.1% in TNF-\u03b1 stimulated MG 63 cells (Chang et\u00a0al. 2019). Sanggenol L (431), isolated from the root bark of Morus alba, showed inhibitory effect against NO production with an IC50 value of 12.5 \u00b5M in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages (Qin et\u00a0al. 2015a).\nSix cyclized geranylflavonoids (237\u2013242) were isolated from the rhizomes of Helminthostachys zeylanica. (10R,11\u00a0 S)-ugonin S (237), ugonin V (238), ugonin W (239), and ugonin Y (240) exhibited NO inhibition with IC50 values of 19.7, 18.0, 7.0, and 6.7 \u00b5M, respectively (Huang et\u00a0al. 2017). Nymphaeol A (386), 3\u2032-geranyl-naringenin (437), isonymphaeol-B (438), and nymphaeols B (445) and C (446), isolated from Okinawa propolis, repressed NO production with IC50 values ranging from 2.4 to 7.0 \u00b5M and inhibited COX-2 activity with IC50 values ranging from 11.74 to 24.03 \u00b5M in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells (Shahinozzaman et\u00a0al. 2018).\nThe geranylated flavonoids from Paulownia tomentosa were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). Mimulone (369), 3\u2032,4\u2032-O-dimethyl5\u2032-hydroxydiplacone (370), 374, 375, and tomentodiplacone O (411) showed significant effects on COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition with IC50 values range of 1.8\u201326.3 \u00b5M, comparable with the positive control ibuprofen with IC50 values of 6.3 \u00b5M for COX-1, and 4.2 \u00b5M for COX2, respectively. Compound 411 showed greater selectivity against COX-2 than ibuprofen, which is a relatively nonselective COX inhibitor. According to the SARs of the geranylated flavonoids, the unmodified prenylated side chain and substitution of ring B appeared to be crucial for the COX inhibitory activity of flavanones. What\u2019s more, these geranylated flavonoids were also evaluated for their inhibitory activities against 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). 374, 375, 3\u2032-O-methyl-5\u2032-methoxydiplacone (371), tomentone (408), and paulownione C (415) show inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 0.05\u20132.46 \u00b5M. Compounds 374 and 375 both bearing two hydroxy groups on the ring B and an unmodified geranyl side chain showed inhibitory activities against 5-LOX almost 10 times greater than the\npositive control zileuton (IC50 value: 0.35 \u00b5M) (Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2017). Additionally, 369 also named bonannione A was isolated from Macaranga denticulata (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2016). Another study assayed the geranylated flavonoids (373, 379\u2013382, 394\u2013398, and 400\u2013406) from the fruits of Paulownia tomentosa were tested for inhibitory effect on human neutrophil elastase (HNE) in\u00a0vitro which stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and other cytokines, exacerbating the inflammatory process. 3\u2032-O-methyldiplacone (373), 6-geranyl-5,7,3\u2032,5\u2032tetrahydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyflavanone (379), prokinawan (395), tomentin J (396), isopaucatalinone B (398), and tomentin A (400) displayed potent inhibition with IC50 values of 7.8, 3.3, 6.7, 6.3, 2.4, and 8.4 \u00b5M, respectively, showing more potent than the non-prenylated flavones quercetin (IC50: 14.3 \u00b5M), luteolin (IC50: 12.7 \u00b5M), and apigenin (IC50: 46.1 \u00b5M). The activities of the geranylated flavonoids indicated a positional requirement for the geranyl derivatives. However, hydroxylation at C-3 and methoxylation at C-5\u2032 might tend to reduce the HNE inhibitory potencies (Ryu et\u00a0al. 2017).\nA series of prenylated flavonoids (154, 501\u2013503, 665, 681, 687, 805\u2013807, 818, 819, 855, 857, and 874) from the roots of Flemingia philippinensis were evaluated for their HNE inhibitory activity. The results indicate that HNE inhibitory activity was significantly affected by subtle changes in the respective structures of the prenylated flavonoids. The 4\u2032-hydroxy group in flavanones strongly affected the inhibition by comparing lupinifolin (501) (IC50 = 13.3 \u00b5M) and flemichin D (502) (IC50 = 5.3 \u00b5M) with khonklonginol H (503) (IC50 = 110.2 \u00b5M). 8-\u03b3,\u03b3Dimethylallylwighteone (805) (IC50 = 6.0 \u00b5M) with two prenyl groups on the A-ring was 9 times more effective than the non-prenylated compound genistein (IC50 = 51.4 \u00b5M), which suggested the prenylation at the A-ring plays a pivotal role in HNE inhibition. Similar prenylation effects were also observed for flemingsin (806) (IC50 = 12.0 \u00b5M) and osajin (819) (IC50 = 26.0 \u00b5M). A comparison of 6,8-diprenylorobol (807) (IC50 = 1.3 \u00b5M) with 819 (IC50 = 26.0 \u00b5M) showed that the catechol motif of the B-ring significantly influences HNE inhibition. However, prenylation on the B-ring diminished the inhibitory activity by comparing genistein (IC50 = 51.4 \u00b5M) with 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2\u2032,5\u2032-di(3-methylbut-2-enyl) isoflavone (855) (IC50 = 213.1 \u00b5M) (Kim et\u00a0al. 2018).\nThe prenylated chalcones (646, 648, 653\u2013655, and 647) were isolated from the roots of Hedysarum gmelinii and showed NO inhibition activities with IC50 values ranging from 3.25 to 18.18 \u00b5M in LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Among them, hedysarumine B (648), paratocarpin F (654), and hedysarumine G (655) exhibited higher activities than the positive control dexamethasone (IC50: 9.47 \u00b5M), with IC50 values of 5.12, 8.48, and 3.25 \u00b5M, respectively (Liu et\u00a0al. 2018c).\n1 3\nFruits of Ficus carica have been consumed as a very popular health-promoting fruit worldwide since ancient times. A series of prenylated isoflavone derivatives were separated from the fruits of F. carica. Among these isolated compounds, 730, 741, and 997\u20131000 showed stronger inhibitory effects against NO production with IC50 values below that of positive control hydrocortisone, while the other compounds (732\u2013734, 996, 1001, and 1004) exhibited weaker inhibitory effects against NO production by comparison with that of hydrocortisone. The compounds with the hydrogen atom at C-3\u2032, the 2-propan-2-ol group at C-2\u2033, and the furan ring were more likely to hold significant inhibitory effects against NO production by comprehensive analysis of the structures and the inhibitory activities of 997, 996, 1001 \u2212 1000, and 1004. The compounds with a paradisubstituted benzene ring were more likely to possess potent inhibitory effects against NO production by comparing the structures of 730\u2013734 (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019c).\nTwo diprenylated isoflavones, 819 and pomiferin (820), isolated from the fruit of Maclura pomifera, exhibited inhibitory activities against NF-\u03baB with IC50 values of 12.0 and 13.0 \u00b5g/mL in SW1353 cells and against iNOS with values of 7.2 and 6.4 \u00b5g/mL in LPS-treated macrophages, respectively. Compounds 819 and 820 also enhanced the activity of NAG-1 by 1.8- and 1.5-fold increases at 6.0 \u00b5M, respectively, whereas 820 inhibited intracellular oxidative stress with an IC50 of 3.3 \u00b5g/mL (Abourashed et\u00a0al. 2015). A prenylated flavonostilbene cajanusflavanol A (1028) featuring a unique highly functionalized cyclopenta[1,2,3de]isobenzopyran-1-one tricyclic core possessed inhibitory effect against NO production with an IC50 value of 13.62 \u00b5M (He et\u00a0al. 2018)."

            "text": "Postprandial hyperglycaemia is an important risk factor in the onset and development of type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase would delay the digestion as well as absorption of carbohydrates, which consequently, suppress the postprandial hyperglycaemia. Prenylation of flavonoids increased the potency of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition. 6-Prenylquercetin (70) and 71 from Glycyrrhiza uralensis leaves showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 3.7 and 21.3 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Fan et\u00a0al. 2019). Hirtacoumaroflavonoside (77) act as a noncompetitive \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor with an IC50 value of 22 \u00b5M (Sheliya et\u00a0al. 2015). Hirtaflavonoside B (157) showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 71 \u00b5M and acted in a mixed noncompetitive inhibitory pattern (Sheliya et\u00a0al. 2015). 207 and dioxycudraflavone A (229) also exhibited \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 23.2 and 25.27 \u00b5M, respectively (Li et\u00a0al. 2018).\n6-Prenyleriodictyol (266), 6-prenylnaringenin (267), and 5\u2032-prenyleriodictyol (312) showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 27.5, 15.4 and 53.4 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Fan et\u00a0al. 2019). Three 8-prenylflavonones euchrenone a7 (279), 8-prenylnaringenin (280), and isoxanthohumol (281) from Morus alba and H. lupulus showed inhibition activities against \u03b1-glucosidase with IC50 values of 6.28, 50, and 40 \u00b5M, respectively (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022; Yang et\u00a0al. 2012). 4\u2032,1\u2032\u2032-Dihydroxy-3\u2032-methoxy6,7-furanflavanone (349) is from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia and exhibited inhibitory activity on \u03b1-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 53.1 \u00b5M, lower than the positive control acarbose (IC50 = 214.5 \u00b5M) (Fei et\u00a0al. 2020). Four geranylated flavonones nymphaeol A (367), 437, 438, and 445, isolated from Okinawa propolis, strongly suppressed in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme activity with IC50 values of 3.77\u20135.66 \u00b5M (Shahinozzaman et\u00a0al. 2018). Kushenols E (460), L (461), and A (526) inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase activity with IC50 values of 24.6, 32.6, and 50.6 \u00b5M, respectively. 460 showed an uncompetitive inhibitory pattern, whereas 461 and 526 had a noncompetitive binding mechanism (Kim et\u00a0al. 2017). Kushenol B (554) inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase activity in an uncompetitive inhibitory pattern with an IC50 value of 11.0 \u00b5M (Kim et\u00a0al. 2017). 579 showed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 47 \u00b5M below that of positive control acarbose (IC50 = 58 \u00b5M) (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022). 5,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihydroxy-1\u2032\u2032methoxy-6,7-furanbavachalcone (609) is from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia and exhibited inhibitory activity on \u03b1-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 90.3 \u00b5M. The IC50 value of the positive control acarbose was 214.5 \u00b5M (Fei et\u00a0al. 2020). A phytochemical investigation of Masclura tricuspidata leaves resulted in the isolation of 47 prenylated isoflavonoids. They were evaluated for their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory and anti-glycation activities. Most isoflavonoids showed good inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase, with IC50 values of < 30.0 \u00b5M. Among the isolates, gancaonin M (698), millewanin G (808), erysenegalensein E (810), and cudracusisoflavone L (812) showed strong \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition with IC50 values of 8.2, 3.2, 4.2, and 8.9 \u00b5M, respectively. The prenylated isoflavonoids were further divided into one linear prenyl moiety, two linear prenyl moieties, one cyclized prenyl moiety, and two prenyl moieties with one linear and one cyclized type. Comparing the type of prenyl group, the inhibitory activity was stronger in isoflavonoids with linear prenyl group than cyclized ones. The addition of the hydroxyl group to the prenyl group increased the inhibitory effects, while the addition of the OCH3 group caused a decrease in the inhibitory effect. The molecular docking analysis also supported the aforementioned speculation (Jo et\u00a0al. 2021).\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that\nfunction as ligand-inducible transcription factors modulating the expression of target genes involved in controlling glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and inflammation. 22 prenylated flavonoids, isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, were screened on the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity. Bavachin (273), bavachinin (277), 4\u2032-O-methylbavachalcone (573), broussochalcone B (574), and corylifol A (869) exhibited potent PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activation from 6.16-fold to 13.12- fold at a test concentration of 25 \u00b5M. Substituting methoxyl at C-7 of A-ring to hydroxyl, such as 273 and 574, reduced PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activation compared to 277 and 573, indicating that the methoxyl in the C-7 position of A-ring is crucial for PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity. Isobavachin (289) and isobavachalcone (575) show less PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity than 273 and 574, suggesting that the prenyl in the C-6 position of A-ring may contribute to their agonist activities. 573 and 574 showed less PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity than 273 and 274, which indicated that the C-ring structure is an important determinant for PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity, opening the C-ring results in remarkably lower activity. In addition, the cyclization of the prenyl group on the A-ring and B-ring also markedly reduced PPAR-\u03b3 agonist activity (Fig.\u00a017) (Ma et\u00a0al. 2016).\nProtein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator in the insulin signaling pathway, was evidenced as a promising drug target for type 2 diabetes. The prenylated flavonoids, macarangin (143), bonannione A (337), bonanniol A (378), (2E)-1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-2\u00a0H-benzopyran-8-yl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-one (588), (2E)-1-(5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2\u00a0H-benzopyran-8-yl)3-phenyl-2-propen-1-one (589), and laxichalcone (656), from Macaranga denticulate showed potential inhibitory activities against PTP1B in\u00a0vitro with an IC50 value of 22.7, 14.0, 15.2, 48.8, 19.3, and 20.7\u00b5M, respectively (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2016). 166, cudraflavone C (167), cudraflavanone D (472), and euchrestaflavanone C (510) derived from the roots of Cudrania tricuspidate, showed PTP1B inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 13.6, 9.4, 5.7, and 12.3 \u00b5M, respectively (Quang et\u00a0al. 2015). Five prenylated flavonoids, morunigrol A (174), 204, cudraflavone B (228), and morunigrols C (248) and B (249), from Morus nigra exhibited PTP1B inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 12.5, 22.1, 20.0, 7.7 and 5.3 \u00b5M, respectively (Qu et\u00a0al. 2021).\nAldose reductase mediates the first step of the \u201cpolyol pathway\u201d by reducing glucose to sorbitol through a NADPH-dependent reaction. Under hyperglycemic conditions, it tended to cause excessive accumulation of sorbitol which might finally promote the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) by decrease the cell\u2019s antioxidative capabilities. The AGEs could lead to diabetic complications, such as microangiopathies, nephropathies, retinopathies, peripheral neuropathies and cataract. Aldose reductase inhibitors possessed the potential to prevent or control the onset of these diabetic complications. 280, 281, and 579 are potent tight-binding inhibitors of human aldose reductase AKR1B1 with IC50 values of 0.81, 0.57, and 9.11 \u00b5M and Ki values of 0.30, 0.17, and 5.29 \u00b5M, respectively, using glyceraldehyde as a generic substrate. The IC50 and Ki values of three inhibitors against AKR1B1 were 1.87, 0.88, and 29.17\u00b5M, and 0.71, 0.34, and 15.08 \u00b5M, respectively, when applied glucose as a generic substrate. 280 and 579 inhibited AKR1B1 in a non-competitive fashion, whereas 281 displayed the typical pattern of an uncompetitive inhibitor. All three inhibitors exhibit a 4\u2032-OH group which indicated a 4\u2032-OH group is crucial for the inhibition of AKR1B1. 280 (IC50 = 0.81 \u00b5M) exhibited an inhibitory potency that is 7.6 times greater as compared to that of 267 (IC50 = 6.2 \u00b5M), applying glyceraldehyde as substrate. It suggested that prenyl moiety at the C-8 position played an important role in aldose reductase inhibition. The efficacy of 280 (IC50 = 1.87 \u00b5M) and 281 (IC50 = 0.88 \u00b5M) is 15\u201334 times greater than that of 579 (IC50 = 29.17 \u00b5M), which indicated that the C-ring structure is an important determinant for aldose reductase inhibition, opening C-ring results in remarkably lower activity (Seliger et\u00a0al. 2018; Shim et\u00a0al. 2009). A series of prenylated isoflavoinds (698, 705, 727, 745, 760, 799, 808, 809, 832\u2013834, and 835) from M. tricuspidata leaves efficiently inhibited methylglyoxal- or glyoxal-induced AGEs formation, which can be considered as promising candidates for the treatment of several diabetic complications (Jo et\u00a0al. 2021).\nPrenylated flavonoids with\u00a0antioxidant activity\n6-Prenylated-3,5,7,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2\u2032-methoxyflavonol (69), isolated from Chlorophora regia, exhibited remarkable\n1 3\nfree radical scavenging properties with an IC50 value of 2.8 \u00b5g/mL (Kyekyeku et\u00a0al. 2016). 70, 5\u2032-prenylquercetin (102), 266, 312, and 8-[(E)-3-hydroxymethyl-2-butenyl]eriodictyol (323) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis leaves scavenged DPPH radicals with an EC50 value of 2.4, 3.6, 5.2, 8.7, and 2.3 \u00b5g/mL (Fan et\u00a0al. 2019). 72 exhibited weak DPPH scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 0.34\u00a0mg/ mL (ascorbic acid as a positive control, IC50 = 0.07\u00a0mg/mL) (K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131bekmez et\u00a0al. 2015). The prenylated flavnoids (84, 267, 308, and 332) and several non-prenylated flavonoids isolated from Eleocharis tuberosa were evaluated for antioxidant activity by the reducing power assay and DPPH radical scavenging assay. The result indicated that the flavonoids, 84, eleocharins C (308), and B (332), with a 3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxylated B ring had strong antioxidant activity, and the activity decreased when the hydroxyl of B-ring was substituted with methoxy. The prenylation of flavonoids did not affect the antioxidant activity of flavonoids (Luo et\u00a0al. 2014). Elastixanthone (97), 202, and cycloartobiloxanthone (217) identified in the bark of Artocarpus elasticus, displayed significant scavenging activity for DPPH with an IC50 value of 21.6, 11.5, and 40.0 \u00b5g/mL (Ramli et\u00a0al. 2016). Artocarpin (169), 3\u2032-hydroxycycloartocarpin (182), and pyranocycloartobiloxanthone A (232) are from the leaves and heartwoods of Artocarpus anisophyllus and showed DPPH radical scavenging activity with SC50 values of 140.0, 152.9, and 20.2 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. (Abdul Lathiff et\u00a0al. 2015). The antioxidant activities of sixteen prenylated flavonoids from Artocarpus altilis were assessed to scavenge DPPH, ABST, and superoxide anions. Artogomezianon (179) and isocycloartobiloxanthone (230) exhibited ABTS activities with IC50 values of 36.9 and 7.2 \u00b5M, respectively, while 179 had an IC50 value of 39.7 for superoxide anion scavenging activity. Artoflavone A (209), hydroxyartoflavone A (210), and 230 showed DPPH scavenging activities, with IC50 values of 53.5, 20.9, and 33.9 \u00b5M, respectively (Lan et\u00a0al. 2013). A diprenylflavone, 3,5,2\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-6\u2032\u2032,6\u2032\u2032-dimethylpyrano(2\u2032\u2032,3\u2032\u2032:7,6)8-(3\u2032\u2032\u2032,3\u2032\u2032\u2032-dimethylallyl) flavone (195), from the roots of Eriosema chinense show strong DPPH scavenging activities with an IC50 value of 35 \u00b5M (Thongnest et\u00a0al. 2013). Cycloheterophyllin (258) and 2\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy-3,4-(2\u2032\u2032,2\u2032\u2032dimethylchromeno)-3\u2032-prenyldihydrochalcone (688) showed antioxidant activity towards DPPH with SC50 value of 102.8 and 223.8 \u00b5M (Abdullah et\u00a0al. 2017). Mildbone (341) and mildbenone (593) were from Erythrina mildbraedii and showed potent DPPH scavenging activities with IC50 values of 20.2 and 28.5 \u00b5M, stronger than the positive control (BHA, IC50 value: 44.2) (Ali et\u00a0al. 2012). Two derivatives, 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-[8-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(4methyl-3-pentenyl)-2\u00a0H-1-benzopyran-5-yl]-1-propanone (672) and 2-geranyl-2\u2032,3,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone (673), from Artocarpus altilis showed DPPH scavenging activities with IC50 values of 82.2 and 82.4 \u00b5M, respectively\n(Huong et\u00a0al. 2012). Excelsanone (694) and 6,8-diprenylgenistein (805) from Erythrina excelsa possessed actives for DPPH radical scavenging with IC50 values of 1.31 and 0.07\u00a0mg/mL, respectively (Gbaweng et\u00a0al. 2020). Thonningiisoflavone (781) is from Ficus thonningii and showed strong DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 65.5 \u00b5M (Fongang et\u00a0al. 2015). Iconisoflavan (945), iconisoflaven (952), licorisoflavan A (961), (3\u00a0S)-licoricidin (962), and glycycoumarin (995), isolated from the roots of Glycyrrhiza iconica, exhibited weak DPPH scavenging activity with IC50 values of 0.29, 0.18, 0.56, 0.32, and 0.47\u00a0mg/mL, respectively (ascorbic acid as a positive control, IC50: 0.07\u00a0mg/mL) (K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131bekmez et\u00a0al. 2015).\nSophoflavanones A (539) and B (540) from the roots of Sophora flavescens exhibited antioxidant activities against Fe2+/cysteine-induced toxicity at a concentration of 0.1 \u00b5M with inhibitory values of 71.65% and 72.49%, respectively (vitamin C as a positive control:87.83%) (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2018). The diprenylisoflavones 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-6,8-diprenylisoflavone (807) and 818 from Flemingia philippinensis showed antioxidant activities with ferric reducing antioxidant power values of 4338 and 2977 \u00b5mol/g, respectively (Fu et\u00a0al. 2012).\nIn general, the antioxidant activity of prenylated flavonoids shows a close relationship with the number and position of hydroxyl groups. The catechol motif of B ring had strong antioxidant activity, and the activity decreased when the hydroxyl of B-ring was substituted with methoxy. Additionally, the prenylation of flavonoids did not affect the antioxidant activity of flavonoids."

Another compound 467 exhibited antimicrobial activities against Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with IC50 values of 2.95, 8.59, 4.32, and 4.47 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Chen et\u00a0al. 2017). 501 inhibited the growth of S. aureus with MIC and MBC values of 8 and 16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, by damaging the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (Yusook et\u00a0al. 2017). 501 resisted the activity of multidrug resistant enterococci with antibiofilm-producing activity, increasing membrane permeability and causing loss of salt tolerance (Sianglum et\u00a0al. 2019). 579 possessed antimicrobial\n1 3\nactivities against S. aureus (T28.1, T25.10, T26A4, 08143), Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania mexicana with MIC values of 6.8\u201355.0 \u00b5M (Bocquet et\u00a0al. 2019).\nSeveral monoprenylated isoflavonoids exhibited potent natural antifungal against Z. parabailii acting by severely compromising the membrane integrity, fifteen (690, 734, 735, 777, 778, 949, 951\u2013953, 968\u2013970, 975, 978, and 989) of which showed moderate to good antifungal activity against Z. parabailii (MIC \u2264 50 \u00b5g/mL) at pH 6.5. Wighteone (734), luteone (735), and glabridin (949) showed the highest antifungal activities with MICs of 3.13\u20136.25, 12.5, and 6.25\u201312.5 \u00b5g/mL. The fungicidal activity of 734 and 949 was 4\u20138 times higher than that of polygodial (MIC 50 \u00b5g/mL) at pH 6.5, the most potent natural agent against Z. parabailii reported so far. However, the diprenylated isoflavones (805 and 854) and diprenylated flavonone (466) did not exert any antifungal activity (MIC \u226b 25 \u00b5g/mL). A brief SARs of prenylated flavonoids was shown in Fig.\u00a018 (Kalli et\u00a0al. 2022). The isoflavans licoricidin (956), 961, and licorisoflavans C \u2212 E (958\u2013960) showed marked antibacterial activities against P. gingivalis with MIC value range of 1.56 \u2212 12.5 \u00b5g/mL.

(Song et\u00a0al. 2019).\nTyrosinase inhibitors are important substances to treat abnormal pigmentation disorders, such as melasma, age spots and sites of actinic damage, arising from the accumulation of an excessive level of epidermal pigmentation. Artogomezianone (179) and cudraflavone A (231) repressed melanin production by suppressing tyrosinase activity with IC50 values of 84.8 and 88.4 \u00b5M, respectively (Lan et\u00a0al. 2013). 232 inhibited tyrosinase activity with an IC50 value of 60.5 \u00b5g/ mL (Abdul Lathiff et\u00a0al. 2015). Artonin M (261) is from the dried heartwood of Artocarpus altilis and repressed melanin production by suppressing tyrosinase activity with an IC50 value of 74.1 \u00b5M (Lan et\u00a0al. 2013). 279 is from the leaves of Morus alba and significantly inhibited tyrosinase activity, with an IC50 value of 0.26 \u00b5M (Yang et\u00a0al. 2012). Morusyunnansins E (911) and F (912) from the leaves of Morus yunnanensis significantly inhibited mushroom tyrosinase with IC50 values of 1.43 and 0.15 \u00b5M, respectively (Hu et\u00a0al. 2012).

Both acetylation and deacetylation of histones play a fundamental role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and disruption of the balance between histone acetyltransferases and HDACs causes many disorders and metabolic diseases. Alopecurone J (1011) exerted strong histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity in HeLa and HCT116 cells with IC50 values of 3.85 and 0.08 \u00b5M, respectively.

It increased doxorubicin accumulation and cytotoxicity in triple negative breast cancer cells with high levels of Pgp, without adding significant additional toxicities to doxorubicin treatment. Glycine 185 of Pgp was identified as a critical residue mediating the reduced catalytic efficacy of Pgp elicited by compound 58 in a site-directed mutagenesis experiment. In addition, 58 was predicted to bind two residues, Pha 322 and Gln 721, by in silico molecular docking (Abd\u2013Ellatef et\u00a0al. 2022). 6-Prenylapigenin (64) suppressed the proliferation of HeLa cells via the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. Compound 64 increased the protein levels of p-JNK and p-p38, and reduced the expression of p-Akt and p-ERK (Ye et\u00a0al. 2021). 2-methoxy-2\u2032,4\u2032,4,6-tetrahydroxy-5-lavanduly dihydrochalcone (671) could significantly activate autophagic flux and trigger ROS release in HepG2 cells. However, it did not affect the main proteins of the apoptosis signaling pathway (Yang et\u00a0al. 2021). A new prenylated flavone (165), isolated from Daphne giraldii, selectively inhibited the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by activating the p38/MAPK pathway without apparent cytotoxicity to normal human cells. It also repressed tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model without significantly affecting body weight or pathology characteristics. Mechanistically, 165 resulted in G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis by downregulating the expression of cyclin E1, CDK2, and CDK4 and promoting the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP in HCC cells. It aggravated p38 phosphorylation and attenuated JNK phosphorylation which were abrogated by SB203580, a p38/MAPK-specific inhibitor, and exacerbated by SP600125, a JNK/MAPK-specific inhibitor, indicating 165-induced apoptosis in a p38/ MAPK dependent manner (Wang et\u00a0al. 2017a). A further mechanistic study indicated that 165-induced p38-dependent apoptosis was related to oxidative and nitrosative stress in HCC cells (Shang et\u00a0al. 2018). 169-induced primary glioblastoma cell apoptosis was mediated by the activation of the mitochondrial pathway involving mitochondrial depolarization, ROS production, cytochrome c release, Bad and Bax upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation. The 169-induced ROS generation activated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation which resulted in PARP cleavage and caspase-3, -7, and \u2212 9 activation (Lee et\u00a0al. 2018). Norartocarpin (173) was identified as an Nrf2 activator and prevented oxidative insults in human lung epithelial cells. 173 upregulated the protein levels of Nrf2 and its downstream genes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (GCLM) by facilitating the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and enhancing Nrf2 protein stability (Yang et\u00a0al. 2019). 204 is from the root bark of Morus australis and effectively\n1 3\ninhibited the proliferation and survival of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in\u00a0vitro and repressed tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. It resulted in paraptosis-like cell death, a novel mode of nonapoptotic programmed cell death that is characterized by extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation due to dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria and lack of apoptotic hallmarks. 204 also resulted in an obvious enhancement of mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, generation of ROS, and depletion of \u0394\u03c8m in EOC cells. 204-induced paraptosislike cell death was supposed to relate to overloaded mitochondrial Ca2+ causing mitochondrial swelling and dysfunction for the treatment of voltage-dependent anion channel inhibitor, 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid, which reversed the aforementioned effect in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (Xue et\u00a0al. 2018). In addition, 204 was found to be a promising candidate for cancer treatment, including lung cancer. It induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through chromatin condensation, PARP cleavage, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, cytochrome c release, Bax/ Bcl-2 dysregulation, and caspase-3 cleavage. It also caused a pro-autophagic effect, accompanied by an increased level of LC3-II and a decreased level of SQSTM1/p62. 204 enhanced intracellular ROS levels, inhibited PI3K/Akt signaling and activated the JNK and ERK pathways, which was confirmed by treatment with the corresponding enzyme inhibitors (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020c). 202, derived from the stem bark of Artocarpus elasticus, suppressed breast cancer cell viability by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. 202 enhanced the release of total ROS and polarized the mitochondrial membrane. It upregulated the expression of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-7 and -9, and p21 and downregulated the expression of MAPK and cyclin D at the transcriptional and translational levels. 202 also repressed an inhibitor of apoptosis, livin, to avoid preceding chemotherapeutic resistance and apoptosis evasion (Etti et\u00a0al. 2017a, b). 267 inhibited the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 with an estimated value of the half-blocking concentration of 5.76 \u00b5M in Jurkat T cells and exhibited more effective inhibition of Kv1.3 channels than the nonprenylated compounds, acacetin, chrysin, baicalein, wogonin, and luteolin. 266 showed low cytotoxicity to Jurkat T cells, which indicated that the channel inhibition might be involved in its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects (Teisseyre et\u00a0al. 2018). 281 can diminish melanoma cell viability due to autophagy and caspase-dependent apoptosis in the B16-F10 murine melanoma model. 281 abolished the metastatic potential of a melanoma subclone by disrupting integrin signaling and inhibited the development of lung metastatic foci in tumor-challenged animals (Krajnovi\u0107 et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition, 281 was identified as a noncompetitive inhibitor with a different binding site than acarbose. It bound to \u03b1-glucosidase in allosteric sites via hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, van der Waals, and\nelectrostatic forces. The binding of 281 to \u03b1-glucosidase affected the tertiary structure of \u03b1-glucosidase by changing the hydrophobicity around Tyr and Trp residues. After binding 281, the binding sites of \u03b1-glucosidase formed a stable \u03b1-helix, which is involved in forming stable hydrogen bonds with the Asn241 residue (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022). 460 inhibited autophagy-modulating activity by exhibiting autophagosome maturation by blocking the degradation of EGFP puncta in HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-mRFP-LC3B. It also reduced lysosomal activity and cathepsin maturation by disrupting lysosomal positioning, subsequently inducing apoptosis. Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 was proven to be a potential target protein of 460 in regulating lysosomal positioning for autophagy maturation (Kwon et\u00a0al. 2020). 522 suppressed the TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung epithelial cells. 522 suppressed the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and Akt induced by TGF-\u03b21 in lung epithelial cells and lung tissues treated with BLM. Oral administration of 522 attenuated fibrotic changes in lung tissues, including the accumulation of collagen, and improved mechanical pulmonary functions (Park et\u00a0al. 2021).\n579, a prenylated chalcone from hops, exhibited diverse anti-cancer activities, such as anti-chronic myelogenous leukemia, anti-breast cancer, and anti-glioma cell activities, but the anti-cancer mechanisms are different. 579 inhibited the proliferation, induced S phase cell cycle arrest, and stimulated apoptosis in K562 cells. It degraded BCR-ABL in a concentration- and time-dependent manner involving the activation of caspase and inhibition of autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system in K562 cells (Lu et\u00a0al. 2019). 579 inhibited the survival of breast cancer cells by modulating the Notch signaling pathway in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. It not only downregulated cell viability and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but also reduced the activation of the Notch signaling pathway and apoptotic regulators Bcl-2, Bcl-extra large, and caspase 3 (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016; Sun et\u00a0al. 2018b). 579 induced reversal of drug resistance via the inhibition of ABCB1-mediated transport of doxorubicin, stimulating ABCB1 ATPase activity and acting as a substrate of ABCB1. 579 bound to the ABCB1 transmembrane domain, which resulted in less protein and ligand position fluctuation, and 579 synergized with the ABCB1 substrate colchicine (Liu et\u00a0al. 2018a). 579 induced glioma cell autophagy and inhibited tumor growth in\u00a0vivo through the Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway and MAPK cascade (Lu et\u00a0al. 2015). 579 induced apoptosis in human malignant glioblastoma cells and the mechanism was related to the increase in ROS species and activation of MAPK pathways, and 579 activated caspase-3 and \u2212 9 and PARP cleavage (Festa et\u00a0al. 2011). 579 decreased the proliferation of TPC1 cancer cells by inducing DNA fragmentation and promoting cell cycle arrest (Carvalho et\u00a0al. 2018). The chemoprotective effect of 579 was investigated in\u00a0vitro in the metabolically\n1 3\ncompetent HepG2 cell line. The results indicated that 579 could act as a scavenger of AFBO, preventing DNA adduct formation and DNA damage induction (\u0160tern et\u00a0al. 2021). 579 impaired the PMA-driven migratory and invasive capacity of A549 cells by decreasing the level of MMP-9 expression and concomitantly increasing TIMP-1 protein expression, a specific blocker of PRO-MMP-9 activation. 579 decreased the PMA-induced production of VEGF and TGF-\u03b2. Furthermore, 579-treatment counteracted the PMAinduced EMT of A549 cells by upregulating of E-cadherin and \u03b1-E-catenin and downregulating of N-cadherin, vimentin, and snail-l expression (Slawinska-Brych et\u00a0al. 2021). 579 significantly induced glioblastoma multiforme cell death and enhanced temozolomide cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, 579 downregulated replication factor C subunit 2 (RFC2), a DNA repair-related gene, which was overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme patients and tumors. MicroRNA-4749-5p, a 579-upregulated microRNA, was identified to target the RFC2 3\u2032 UTR and inhibit RFC2 expression (Ho et\u00a0al. 2020). 579 inhibited esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo by targeting keratin (KRT)-18, which was highly expressed in patient ESCC tissues. Knockdown or overexpression of KRT18 protein abrogated or enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of 579, respectively. 579 could attenuate KRT18 protein expression. However, it did not change the KRT18 mRNA levels. 579 also induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which was associated with the modulation of the expression of related markers, including cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cleavedPARP, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, and Bax (Yin et\u00a0al. 2020).\n818, isolated from Flemingia philippinensis, promoted apoptosis and diminished tumor growth by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling through an ROS-mediated caspase-independent pathway. It caused selective apoptotic cell death in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by elevating DNA fragmentation, the sub-G1 cell population, c-PARP, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, AIF and endonuclease G. 818 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and PI3K. However, auriculasin-induced apoptosis did not result in caspase-3, -8, and \u2212 9 activation (Cho et\u00a0al. 2018). Isoangustone A (845) was proven to be an agonist of AMPK, an important signaling molecule that regulates cell energy homeostasis and autophagy. 845 inhibited mitochondrial respiratory capacity, activated autophagic signaling and induced a complete autophagic flux in colorectal cancer cells in a concentrationdependent manner. It also enhanced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and increased LC3-I&II protein levels in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Tang et\u00a0al. 2021). BAS-4, isolated from Brosimum acutifolium, showed potential activity against glioma through the apoptosis pathway mediated by \u0394\u03a8m loss and Akt pathway disruption. It inhibited migration and invasion and induced apoptosis via mitochondrial damage, \u0394\u03a8m loss, cell cycle\narrest, and Akt phosphorylation suppression in glioma cells. However, it did not induce cytotoxicity in primary glial cells (Mau\u00e9s et\u00a0al. 2019). 949 suppressed the tumor formation in the hepatoma xenograft model in\u00a0vivo without statistically significant changes in body weight. It was proven to restrain the migration and invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 rather than inhibiting their proliferation. 949 suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of MMP9 by affecting the expression of the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors (Hsieh et\u00a0al. 2014). Two prenylated dihydroisoflavones, sigmoidin I (883) and bidwillon A (904), and two prenylated pterocarpans, 6\u03b1-hydroxyphaseollidin (982) and sophorapterocarpan A (990), exhibited promising cytotoxic effects to diverse sensitive cell lines (CCRF-CEM, MDAMB-231-pcDNA, HCT116, U87MG, and HepG2) with an IC50 value range of 3.36\u201329.48 \u00b5M and drug-resistant cancer cell lines [CEM/ADR5000, MDA-MB-231-BCRP, HCT116 (p53\u2212/\u2212), U87MG, and \u0394EGFR] with an IC50 value range of 4.60-30.98 \u00b5M, and did not exhibit obvious cytotoxicity to the normal cell line AML12, with the IC50 values greater than 98.02 \u00b5M (Kuete et\u00a0al. 2014). 982 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by the activation of effector and initiator caspases, including caspase-3, -7, -8, and \u2212 9, breakdown of MMP and increase in ROS production, whereas the apoptotic process induced by abyssinone IV (483), 883, and 990 was alleviated by the loss of MMP and the increase in ROS production (Kuete et\u00a0al. 2014). A brief summary of the anti-cancer mechanisms of the active ingredients is listed in Table\u00a05.."

Treatment with 169 at topical doses of 0.05% and 0.1% showed a significant photoprotective effect by decreasing histopathological changes, such as desquamation, epidermal thickening and sunburn cell formation. It exhibited a significant effect by decreasing levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation which have been used as markers of oxidative stress for evaluating UVB irradiation induced skin damage. In addition, 169 downregulated the inflammatory proteins cPLA2 and COX-2 to decrease the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Lee et\u00a0al. 2013). 169 had a potential therapeutic effect on skin wounds by accelerating the inflammatory phase and increasing myofibroblast differentiation, proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, collagen synthesis and maturation, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis. It accelerated inflammatory progression and subsequently decreased persistent inflammation. 169 increased collagen production and increased human fibroblast proliferation and migration by activating\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 5\nA nt\ni-c an\nce r m\nec ha\nni sm\no f a\nct iv\ne in\ngr ed\nie nt\ns\nN o\nIn gr\ned ie\nnt M\nod el\ns Re\nsu lt/\nM ec\nha ni\nsm Re\nfe re\nnc es\n58 G\nla br\nat ep\nhr in\nM D\nA -M\nB -2\n31 a\nnd m\nur in\ne m\nam m\nar y\nJC c\nel ls\n\u2191D ox\nor ub\nic in\na cc\num ul\nat io\nn an\nd cy\nto to\nxi ci\nty , b\nin d\nPh e\n32 2\nan d\nG lu\n7 21\nA bd\n\u2013E lla\nte f e\nt\u00a0a l.\n(2 02\n2)\n64 6-\npr en\nyl ap\nig en\nin H\neL a\nce lls\n\u2191p -P\nA R\nP, \u2191\npJN\nK , \u2191\npp3\n8, \u2193\npA\nkt , \u2193\npER\nK Ye\ne t\u00a0a\nl.

It inhibited the LPS-induced production of NO, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in\u00a0vitro in RAW264.7 and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. 190 suppressed the expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. Mechanistically, 190 induced OH-1 mRNA and protein expression by activating Nrf2 through the p38 MAPK pathway. When HO-1 was inhibited, the anti-inflammatory effect of 190 was significantly abrogated (Tran et\u00a0al. 2018). 228, a large amount of prenylated flavonoid in the roots of Morus alba, was identified as a COX-2 and COX-1 inhibitor and decreased the expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 by blocking the translocation of the NF-\u03baB in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells (Ho\u0161ek et\u00a0al. 2011). Cudraflavanone B (275) suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and inhibited NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by restraining the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 and BV2 cells. In addition, 275 inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase, signaling pathways in these LPS-stimulated cells (Ko et\u00a0al. 2021). Sophoraflavanone M (286) reduced LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators NO, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1, and the expression of these mediators at the mRNA level in the LPS-primed RAW264.7 cell line. 286 inhibited the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and the translocation of p65. 286 also suppressed JNK phosphorylation to dampen AP-1 transcriptional activity (Han et\u00a0al. 2021). Neougonin A (416) from Helminthostachys zeylanica reduced the production of the inflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, PGE2, NO, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 and the inflammation-related proteins iNOS and COX-2 via the suppression of the NF-\u03baB signal transduction pathway in LPS-induced macrophage RAW264.7 cells. 416 inhibited the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and blocked the translocation of NF-\u03baB/p65 into the nucleus. However, it had no effect on JNK, ERK1/2, or p38MAPK phosphorylation (Cao et\u00a0al. 2016). 472 exhibited a potential antineuroinflammatory effect and inhibited NO production activity with an IC50 value of 6.28 in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells. Mechanistically, it remarkably suppressed the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2. 472 also decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2), blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p50 and p65 by interrupting the degradation and phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, and inhibited NF-\u03baB binding. In addition, 472 suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 (Kim et\u00a0al. 2016). 523 dose-dependently suppressed the production of\ninflammatory mediators, including NO, PGE2, IL-6, IL1\u03b2, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b2, in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, demonstrating the inhibition of STAT1, STAT6, and NF-\u03baB activation. It augmented the activity of Nrf2 transcription, which was responsible for the upregulation of HO-1 expression and its activity. 523 activated the endogenous antioxidant defense system involving glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress HaCaT cells, which was relative to upregulated activation of Nrf2 and Akt in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Cho et\u00a0al. 2020). Sophoraflavanone G (527) inhibited LPS-induced production of NO and PGE2 by downregulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. It also decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. Mechanistically, 527 decreased the levels of phosphorylated PI3K and Akt, and attenuated the expression of phosphorylated JAK and STAT. In addition, it upregulated HO-1 expression via nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (Guo et\u00a0al. 2016b). Compared with the chronic, unpredictable, mild stress-exposed group, the levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in the hippocampus were significantly reduced, and the quantity of 5-HT and NE was increased considerably in the 527-treatment model. 527 upregulated the expression of PI3K, Akt, mTOR, 70S6K, BDNF, and Trkb (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020b). SPF1 was identified as a potent ligand for RXR, a target related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. SPF1 potentiated the effect of T0901317, a liver X receptor ligand, on reducing proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels. It efficiently reduced the mRNA expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in\u00a0vitro. SPF1 increased ATF3 mRNA levels in RAW264.7 cells. However, SPF1 did not affect ATF3 mRNA induction in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells since ATF3 is also induced by LPS (Wang et\u00a0al. 2019).\nCompound 579 alleviated oxidative damage and accelerated diabetic wound healing via Nrf2 activation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vitro. It augmented Nrf2 expression and accelerated diabetic wound healing. 579 caused AMPK\u03b1 activation and covalent modification of Keap1, which were related to the stabilization and translocation of Nrf2 (Lu et\u00a0al. 2022). 579 possessed a potential protective effect on LPStreated depressive-like symptoms mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. Pretreatment with 579 at doses of 10 and 20\u00a0 mg/kg reversed the behavioral impairments prophylactically, as was obvious in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, without affecting locomotion, and the 20\u00a0mg/kg dose improved anhedonic behavior, as observed in the sucrose preference test. 579 prevented LPSinduced neuroinflammation and oxido-nitrosative stress in a dose-dependent manner. It reduced activated gliosis via attenuation of Iba-1 and GFAP, and the expression of phosph-NF-\u03baB and caspase-3 and enhanced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the hippocampus (Rahman et\u00a0al. 2021).\n1 3\nA brief summary of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the active ingredients is listed in Table\u00a06."

            "text": "Neurons are damaged following prolonged exposure to high concentrations of corticosterone and one of the main mechanisms underlying neuronal injury is apoptosis. Icariin (26) protected neurons from damage in hippocampal neuronal cells by protecting them against apoptosis. 26 blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation, improved mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibited caspase-3 activation. 26 stimulated mitochondrial activity by upregulating the cortical expression of SIRT1 and PGC1\u03b1 and prevented brain ischemic nerve injury (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2010; Liu et\u00a0al. 2011). 26 could be used to treat poststroke dementia. It ameliorated the damage in central cholinergic circuit histone acetylation homeostasis by enhancing CREB phosphorylation in the central cholinergic circuits. 26 decreased the levels of acetylcholine and choline acetyltransferase compared with those without 26-treatment (Wang et\u00a0al. 2013). 522 alleviated the clinical symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease and some other neurodegenerative diseases. It was proven that 522 played a functional role in dopamine receptor subtypes, V1AR, 5-HT1AR, and hMAOs. 522 could bind well to dopamine receptor subtypes, unfolding antagonist behavior on D1R (IC50: 42.1 \u00b5M) and agonist effects on D2LR and D4R (EC50 22.4 and 71.3 \u00b5M, respectively). 522 suppressed hMAO isoenzymes in a modest and nonspecific manner (Prajapati et\u00a0al. 2021). 579 acted at GABAA receptors in the hippocampal nerve terminals to downregulate the Ca2+ influx by N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, which subsequently suppressed the Ca2+-calmodulin/PKA cascade to reduce the evoked glutamate release. 579 reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents without affecting their amplitude (Chang et\u00a0al. 2016). In addition, 579 reduced infarct volume and improved neurobehavior, mediated by inhibition of inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and platelet activation. 579 decreased the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and caspase-3, which were associated with middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced focal cerebral ischemia (Yen et\u00a0al. 2012). Morachalcone D (586) and morachalcone E (610), two prenylated flavonoids with similar structures isolated from mulberry leaves, exerted protective effects against glutamate- and erastin-induced HT22 cell death. 586 had more potential than 610 in preventing oxytosis and ferroptosis. 586 attenuated glutamate- and erastininduced neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations between 20 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M. However, it had no significant protective effect against neurotoxicity below 15 \u00b5M. Mechanistically, the protective effect of 586 was related to the prevention of ROS production, glutathione\ndepletion, and active Fe2+ iron accumulation. 586 upregulated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense, including GPx4, CAT, SOD2, Nrf2, HMOX1 and SLC7A11. The activation of Nrf2 and HO-1 might play an important role in the neuroprotective effect of 586 against oxidative stress (Wen et\u00a0al. 2020). A brief summary of the neuroprotective mechanisms of the active ingredients was listed in Table\u00a07..\nAnti\u2011diabetic and\u00a0anti\u2011obesity activity\n(3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxy-8,3\u2032-dimethoxy-7-(3-methylbut-2-enoxy) flavone (121), a 7-O-prenylated flavonoid from the leaves of Melicope lunuankenda, induces insulin release by acting on pancreatic \u03b2-cells in STZ-induced diabetic rats. It ameliorated the derailed blood glucose levels, liver glycogen, and serum biological parameters at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg in STZinduced diabetic rats. In\u00a0vitro, 121 induced insulin release in RIN 5\u00a0F cells, which supported its action on pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Moreover, 121 did not show any conspicuous toxic symptoms at a dose of 500\u00a0mg/kg in the acute toxicity test. (George et\u00a0al. 2015). 949 stimulated glucose uptake through the AMPK pathway in L6 myotubes. It increased glucose uptake accompanied by the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. 949 required at least 4\u00a0h to increase glucose uptake, whereas it significantly decreased glycogen and increased lactic acid within 15\u00a0min. The 949-induced glucose uptake was abrogated by an AMPK inhibitor or siRNA. However, the inhibitors of PI3K and Akt did not block this progress. Therefore, 949 alleviated the effect of glucose intolerance by AMPK-dependent GLUT4 translocation in the plasma membrane of mouse skeletal muscle (Sawada et\u00a0al. 2014). 579 had anti-obesity benefits. It decreased the production of dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation and ROS, through mitochondrial uncoupling and stress response induction, and inhibited respiration in a ROS-dependent manner at higher concentrations (Kirkwood et\u00a0al. 2013). 579 also significantly decreased plasmic purine metabolites, glucose levels, energy metabolites, and body weight in\u00a0vivo (Legette et\u00a0al. 2013; Paraiso et\u00a0al. 2021). The seed extract of Psoralea corylifolia was rich in prenylated flavonoids, which reduced body weight and fat mass in a dose-dependent manner. It prevented obesity by increasing browning and activating thermogenic genes to increase energy expenditure and stimulating thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. It induced browning in white adipose tissue, increased p-AMPK\u03b11/2 and p38, and increased brown adipose tissue activity and the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by increasing the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and other thermogenic genes. In addition, it improved insulin sensitivity and prevented hepatic steatosis by increasing lipid oxidation and secretion in HFD-fed mice\n1 3\n190 10-oxomornigrol F RAW264.7 cells \u2193NO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, \u2193protein and mRNA of iNOS and COX-2, \u2193mRNA of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, \u2191protein and mRNA of HO-1, \u2191mRNA of NQO1 and GCLC, \u2191Nrf2, \u2191p-p38 MAPK.\nNegative results: ERK1/2, JNK, Akt\nTran et\u00a0al.

It could alleviate apoptosis by regulating the Bcl-2/Bax axis, inhibiting the levels of TNF-\u03b1, noradrenaline, angiotensin II and brain natriuretic peptide, and blocking the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Song et\u00a0al. 2011). 26 protected cardiomyocytes and apoptosis by inhibiting the JNK and p38 pathways. It prevented the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 and the protein expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in Ang II-treated H9c2 cells but upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2014). 579 inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced cardiac fibroblast activation by mediating the PTEN/Akt/ mTOR pathway. It inhibited the TGF-\u03b21-induced proliferation, differentiation, and collagen overproduction of cardiac fibroblasts by inducing the expression of PTEN and phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR (Jiang et\u00a0al. 2020). Moreover, 579 exerted a cardioprotective effect by upregulating PTEN expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR in\u00a0vivo (Sun et\u00a0al. 2021). 579 was also identified as a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor that regulates cholesterol transfer between lipoproteins, leading to an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk of atherosclerosis (Hirata et\u00a0al. 2012).

It inhibited multinucleated osteoclast formation and transcription factor expression of c-Fos and NFATc1 and suppressed RANKLinduced expression of TRAF6, GAB2, ERK, c-Src, PI3K, and Akt genes, as well as RANKL-induced activity of TRAP (Suh et\u00a0al. 2013). On the other hand, it stimulated osteoblast differentiation through the p38 MAPK and ERK signaling pathways by modulating ALP activity and the expression of RUNX2 in a mesenchymal stem cell line (Jeong et\u00a0al. 2011). A brief summary of the anti-osteoclastogenesis mechanisms of the active ingredients was listed in Table\u00a07.."

Moreover, 949 inhibited dexamethasone-induced phosphorylation of p38 and FoxO3a (Yoshioka et\u00a0al. 2019).\n492 exerted its antifungal activity on biofilms due to its antioxidant activity. It inhibited Candida albicans strain fluconazole-sensitive and C. albicans strain azoleresistant biofilms, with a prooxidant effect leading to the accumulation of endogenous oxidative metabolites and increased antioxidant defenses. COMSTAT analysis showed that biofilms treated with higher concentrations exhibited different diffusion distances that could change the flow inside the biofilm matrix (Peralta et\u00a0al. 2018).\n579 inhibited porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus proliferation and decreased viral-induced oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2\u2013HMOX1 pathway. It stimulated genes associated with the antioxidant response in the Nrf2 signaling pathway and upregulated the expression of Nrf2, HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM, and NQO1 in marc-145 cells (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019b)."

            "text": "In this review, the research progress on phytochemistry and pharmacological activity of prenylated flavonoids and plant resources in the past decade were comprehensively summarized. Prenylated flavonoids showed great potential in antitumor, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, and anti-osteoclastogenic activities. Due to the presence of the prenyl group, the bioavailability of prenylated flavonoids was improved and they had more potential in drug development than nonprenylated flavonoids. Several studies have confirmed that prenylation can increase the bioactivities of flavonoids. In this review, we made the best possible effort to summarize the available information and evidence. This review could be a useful tool in assisting researchers in discovering the new medicinal value of prenylated flavonoids.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12272- 023- 01443-4.\nAcknowledgements The authors are grateful for the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
