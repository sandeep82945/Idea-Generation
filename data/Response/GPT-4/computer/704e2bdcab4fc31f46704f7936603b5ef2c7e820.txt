Expand to Other Cognitive Systems and Networks: The study found that a Theory-of-Mind task provided more informative inferences about effective connectivity in the DMN than resting-state fMRI. Future research could extend this analysis framework to other cognitive systems and networks, such as attention networks, the salience network, or motor systems. This would help to determine if the superior informative value of task-based fMRI observed for the DMN is a more general trend across different cognitive domains.

Investigate Different Task Paradigms: Exploring a wider range of task paradigms within the same cognitive domain (e.g., various social cognition tasks) could help to identify which tasks are most effective at eliciting strong and informative neural connections. This could also include comparing traditional task-fMRI paradigms with novel or less commonly used tasks to assess their relative effectiveness in elucidating neural responses and connections.

Clinical Applications and Patient Populations: Given the potential superiority of task-based fMRI in certain contexts, it would be valuable to apply these methods to clinical populations. Research could focus on identifying disease biomarkers or characterizing network dysfunctions in conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or Alzheimer's disease. Comparing task-based and resting-state fMRI data in these groups could provide insights into the most effective ways to diagnose and understand various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

Longitudinal Studies to Assess Stability and Change: Conducting longitudinal studies that compare task-based and resting-state fMRI data over time could provide insights into the stability and variability of neural connections within individuals. This could be particularly relevant for understanding developmental processes, aging, or the effects of interventions (e.g., cognitive training, medication) on brain connectivity.

Develop and Test New Analytical Models: The current study used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for its analysis. Future research could develop and test new analytical models or methods for analyzing fMRI data, potentially combining elements of task-based and resting-state data to create more comprehensive models of brain connectivity. This could also include the development of machine learning or artificial intelligence approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis.
