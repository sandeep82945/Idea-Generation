"Although there have been previous reports assessing, to some extent, the use of reducing reagents in 2DE, there does not appear to be a direct assessment between different sample types treated with these reagents, either alone or in combination. It is acknowledged that there will not be a ‘perfect’ one-size-fits-all method; however, the goal here was to establish an optimized general protocol to enhance 2DE resolution and thus a breadth of research supported by routine integrative top-down proteomic analyses."

"Secondly, this study focused primarily on the reduction of proteomes during the rehydration and equilibration steps of 2DE. It might also prove useful to test these reagents in the solubilization buffer used for proteome extraction to assess potential improvements in proteoform solubilization, resolution, and, thus, depth of proteome analyses."

"While comparable systematic analyses of alkylating agents might also be suggested, excellent work indicates that the excess acrylamide used here is quite likely the best available treatment."

"To address the full complexity of proteomes, that is, routinely analyzing the constituent proteoforms beyond simply cataloguing canonical amino acid sequences, we must implement deep, quantitative analyses having the necessary analytical power and rigour."
