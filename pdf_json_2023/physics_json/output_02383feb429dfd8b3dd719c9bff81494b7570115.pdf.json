Initiated by a copper-free alkynylation, followed by a base-catalyzed cyclizive indole formation, electrophilic iodination, and finally electrophilic trapping of the intermediary indole anion with alkyl halides provides a concise one-pot synthesis of 3-iodoindoles. The latter are valuable substrates for Suzuki arylations, which are exemplified with the syntheses of four derivatives, some of them are blue emitters in solution and in the solid state, in good yield. Introduction Indoles and their derived substitution patterns are omnipresent heterocyclic structural motifs in nature [1], many natural products [2,3], drugs [4-8], and dyes [9-11] and their preparation is an evergreen in organic synthesis [12-15]. Although the classical Fischer indole synthesis provides a very reliable and broadly applicable access to indole derivatives [16-18], striving for new indole syntheses is ongoing. In particular, metal-catalyzed processes for accessing indoles have become attractive alternatives over the past decades [19-24]. Besides Larock's indole synthesis employing alkyne anellation [25] and Cacchi's cyclization of ortho-alkynylanilines [20,22] catalytic syntheses of indoles from alkynes have become increasingly interesting [26,27]. In addition, as one-pot processes with a huge exploratory potential and diversity-oriented character, syntheses of indoles by multicomponent reactions have aroused considerable interest [28-30]. As part of our program to develop heterocycle syntheses based upon transition-metal catalysis [31], we disclosed an activating group-free alkynylation\u2013cyclization sequence to (aza)indoles Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2023, 19, 1379\u20131385. 1380 Scheme 1: Consecutive alkynylation\u2013cyclization\u2013alkylation three-component synthesis and conception of a consecutive alkynylation\u2013cyclization\u2013iodination\u2013alkylation four-component synthesis via an (aza)indole anion intermediate. [32,33] that could be readily concatenated with a concluding N-alkylation of the 7-azaindole intermediate in the sense of consecutive three-component coupling\u2013cyclization\u2013alkylation synthesis of 1,2,5-trisubstituted 7-azaindoles [34]. Inspired by the coupling\u2013cyclization\u2013alkylation sequence and the stepwise Sonogashira coupling\u2013cyclization\u2013iodination protocol to give valuable 3-iodoindoles by Amjad and Knight [35], we reasoned that the interception by an electrophilic iodination step prior to terminal alkylation could provide a straightforward entry to trisubstituted 3-iodoindoles, which are valuable building blocks for accessing highly decorated (aza)indoles (Scheme 1). Here, we report the concise consecutive four-component synthesis of trisubstituted 3-iodoindoles. Results and Discussion In our previous studies on the alkynylation\u2013cyclization synthesis of 2-substituted (aza)indoles [32-34], we could show that the copper-free Pd-catalyzed alkynylation of 2-aminobromopyridines or 2-bromoanilines and the subsequent base-catalyzed anellation in a one-pot fashion proceeds without nitrogen protection or activation using KOt-Bu in DMSO as a base. Under these conditions, the formation of the terminal (aza)indole anion is the driving force (Scheme 1) [34]. As a consequence, the electrophilic trapping of this intermediate with alkyl halides provides as concise access to N-substituted (aza)indoles. As already shown for N-alkyl 7-azaindole formation in one case, the crucial 7-azaindole anion could be trapped with electrophilic iodine (from N-iodosuccinimide), resulting in a 3-iodo-7-azaindole anion, which could then be alkylated, still in a one-pot fashion [34]. Therefore, we set out to directly employ these standard conditions to the sequence of ortho-haloanilines 1, terminal alkynes 2, N-iodosuccinimide (3), and alkyl halides 4 to screen the scope of the one-pot synthesis of trisubstituted 3-iodoindoles 5 in a consecutive four-component fashion (Scheme 2). The sequence commences with a copper-free alkynylation using DBU as a base at 100 \u00b0C. This step is followed by the addition of KOt-Bu and reaction at 100 \u00b0C for 15 min and subsequent reaction with N-iodosuccinimide (3) at room temperature. Finally, the reaction with alkyl halides 4 at room temperature gives the title compounds 5 in yields between 11\u201369% after chromatographic workup. The structures of the products were unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Assuming that four new bonds are being formed in this one-pot process, the range of yield from 11 to 69% (after isolation) accounts for an average yield of 55\u201390% per bond-forming step which can be considered to be relative efficient, also because only a single terminal purification step is required. However, noteworthy, the 3-iodoindoles are sensitive to light and prolonged storage at room temperature, even under protective gas atmosphere, leads to slow decomposition. Therefore, storage at low temperature in a dark vial is strongly recommended. Upon using 2,4-dibromoaniline (1c) as the substrate and an excess of phenylacetylene (2a), both carbon\u2013bromine bonds are transformed in the alkynylation step affording the alkynyl-substituted 3-iodoindole 6 as product in 42% isolated yield in the sense of a pseudo-five-component reaction (Scheme 3). Finally, the 3-iodoindole 5a and arylboronic acids 7 were employed in a standard Suzuki protocol with cesium carbonate Beilstein J. Org.

The 1,2,3-trisubstitued indoles 8 were unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Miura et al. could show that 1-alkyl-2,3-diarylindoles constitute a class of blue-emissive indole derivatives that are accessible in two steps from indole carboxylates [36].

For example the absorption maximum of indole derivative 8b appears at 309 nm with an absorption coefficient \u03b5 = 10700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 and the emission maximum is found at 423 nm with a Stokes shift of 8700 cm\u22121 (Figure 1A). Moreover, compound 8b emits intensively blue in both the solid state and solution (Figure 1B). Conclusion In summary the indole anion intermediate resulting from a onepot alkynylation\u2013cyclization sequence, which has been previously shown to be efficiently trapped by carbon electrophiles to give N-substituted indoles in a consecutive three-component synthesis, can be selectively iodinated in the 3-position with N-iodosuccinimide prior to N-alkylation to give substituted Beilstein J.

These target compounds are versatile building blocks for instance for a Suzuki coupling to give 1-alkyl-2,3-diarylindoles that can be of particular interest as indole-based blue emitters in solution and in the solid state. The expansion of this practical concise synthesis of indoles and azaindoles and their exploration as biologically active apoptosis inducers [37] and as functional blue emitters is currently underway.

The 1,2,3-trisubstitued indoles 8 were unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Miura et al. could show that 1-alkyl-2,3-diarylindoles constitute a class of blue-emissive indole derivatives that are accessible in two steps from indole carboxylates [36]. Our two-step approach taking advantage of a de novo formation of 3-iodoindoles with variable substitution pattern in a consecutive four-\nScheme 3: Consecutive double alkynylation\u2013cyclization\u2013iodination\u2013alkylation pseudo-five-component synthesis of 5-phenylethynyl-1,2-disubstituted 3-iodoindole 6.\nScheme 4: Suzuki coupling of 3-iodoindole 5a with arylboronic acids 7 to give 1,2,3-trisubstituted indoles 8.\ncomponent process provides a concise access to the aforementioned class of emitters. For example the absorption maximum of indole derivative 8b appears at 309 nm with an absorption coefficient \u03b5 = 10700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 and the emission maximum is found at 423 nm with a Stokes shift of 8700 cm\u22121 (Figure 1A). Moreover, compound 8b emits intensively blue in both the solid state and solution (Figure 1B). Conclusion In summary the indole anion intermediate resulting from a onepot alkynylation\u2013cyclization sequence, which has been previously shown to be efficiently trapped by carbon electrophiles to give N-substituted indoles in a consecutive three-component synthesis, can be selectively iodinated in the 3-position with N-iodosuccinimide prior to N-alkylation to give substituted\n3-iodoindoles in a concise consecutive four-component fashion in modest to good yields. These target compounds are versatile building blocks for instance for a Suzuki coupling to give 1-alkyl-2,3-diarylindoles that can be of particular interest as indole-based blue emitters in solution and in the solid state. The expansion of this practical concise synthesis of indoles and azaindoles and their exploration as biologically active apoptosis inducers [37] and as functional blue emitters is currently underway.\nExperimental Consecutive four-component synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted 3-iodoindole 5d (typical procedure) PdCl2(PPh3)2 (17.4 mg, 25.0 \u03bcmol) and (1-Ad)2PBn\u00b7HBr (23.6 mg, 50 \u03bcmol) were placed in an oven-dried Schlenk tube with magnetic stirring bar under nitrogen.

After cooling to room temperature, potassium tert-butoxide (505 mg, 4.50 mmol) and DMSO (1.50 mL) were added to the reaction mixture and heated to 100 \u00b0C (oil bath) for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, N-iodosuccinimide (3, 338 mg, 1.50 mmol) and DMSO (1.00 mL) were added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for a further 2 to 5 h (monitored by TLC). Then, methyl iodide (4a, 639 mg, 4.50 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.1 to 2 h (monitored by TLC). Deionized water (20 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d7 20 mL).
