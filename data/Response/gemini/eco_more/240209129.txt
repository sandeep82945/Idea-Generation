1. **Extending the framework to more general settings.** The framework developed in the paper can be extended to more general settings, such as settings with more than two goods, settings with non-additive trader valuations, and settings with more general belief update functions.
2. **Developing new algorithms for solving the optimal transport problem.** The optimal transport problem is a challenging problem to solve, especially in high dimensions. Developing new algorithms for solving this problem would be valuable for a variety of applications, including market making.
3. **Investigating the economic properties of optimal market making mechanisms.** The paper provides some insights into the economic properties of optimal market making mechanisms, but more work is needed to fully understand these properties. For example, it would be interesting to investigate how the optimal mechanism changes as the number of goods and the distribution of trader valuations change.
4. **Applying the framework to real-world market making problems.** The framework developed in the paper can be applied to real-world market making problems. This could help to improve the efficiency and profitability of market making.
5. **Developing new market making mechanisms based on the framework.** The framework developed in the paper can be used to develop new market making mechanisms. These mechanisms could be more efficient and profitable than existing mechanisms.
