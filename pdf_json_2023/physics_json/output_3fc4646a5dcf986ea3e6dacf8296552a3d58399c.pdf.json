    "abstractText": "Triturated Moringa oleifera seeds have components that adsorb recalcitrant indigo carmine dye. Coagulating proteins known as lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins) have already been purified from the powder of these seeds, in milligram amounts. The coagulant lectin from M. oleifera seeds (cMoL) was characterized by potentiometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using MOFs, or metal\u2013organic frameworks, of [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n to immobilize cMoL and construct biosensors. The potentiometric biosensor revealed an increase in the electrochemical potential resulting from the Pt/MOF/cMoL interaction with different concentrations of galactose in the electrolytic medium. The developed aluminum batteries constructed with recycled cans degraded an indigo carmine dye solution; the oxide reduction reactions of the batteries generated Al(OH)3, promoting dye electrocoagulation. Biosensors were used to investigate cMoL interactions with a specific galactose concentration and monitored residual dye. SEM revealed the components of the electrode assembly steps. Cyclic voltammetry showed differentiated redox peaks related to dye residue quantification by cMoL. Electrochemical systems were used to evaluate cMoL interactions with galactose ligands and efficiently degraded dye. Biosensors could be used for lectin characterization and monitoring dye residues in environmental effluents of the textile industry.",

            "text": "Lectins are proteins that have binding sites and are able to recognize carbohydrates in a specific and reversible way, thus having biochemical, biomedical and biotechnological applications [1]. They are widely distributed in nature in different tissues of organisms and can adhere to carbohydrates present in the membrane or cell wall, thereby agglutinating cells by recognizing glycoconjugates and complex glycans [2]. Recent research has demonstrated several applications for plant compounds, including as coagulants in water treatment [3\u20135]. M. oleifera is a polyvalent tree [6\u20138] with therapeutic properties for alternative medicinal uses [9]. Extracts from its seeds have proven to be more efficient at removing humic acid than a commonly used chemical component [6] and they also have coagulant proteins that can be applied for water treatments and industrial waste removal [10,11], such as the treatment of textile effluents [12].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13060655 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 2 of 14\nExperiments with triturated M. oleifera seeds, involving spontaneous and exothermic chemical processes to adsorb indigo carmine dye in a liquid medium, have shown excellent results [13]. The environmental impact of the direct discharge of untreated wastewater after the use of dyes is worrying considering the variety and complexity of the chemicals used in the process [14]. Among the many chemical compounds used, dyes have attracted attention due to the high pollution potential they present [15]. In particular, the recalcitrant synthetic dye indigo carmine, widely used in the manufacture of jeans, is difficult to remove from an aqueous medium due to its chemical stability [16]. In Brazil, indigo carmine is broadly applied in the textile industry, especially in the process of customizing jeans, mainly in the northeast region [17]. The discard of textile effluents without treatment into aquatic environments can quickly lead to the depletion of dissolved oxygen, resulting in an imbalance of the ecosystem [18]. The presence of dyes can prevent the penetration of sunlight into the deeper water layers, altering the photosynthetic activity of the medium and resulting in the deterioration of the water quality; the presence of metals and aromatic groups in dyes can induce mutagenic or teratogenic effects, resulting in lethality to aquatic fauna and flora [19,20]. Even with all the problems caused to the environment, the textile industry is of relevance to the economy and various social issues. In Brazil, for, example, it generates 1.34 million formal jobs, and is considered the second largest employer in the manufacturing industry [21] and one of the largest in the world [17]. One of the coagulant molecules of M. oleifera seeds is a cationic lectin (cMoL), specific for galactose, that has been shown to be resistant to a wide pH range and high temperatures. The partially characterized lectin was revealed to have a molecular profile of 26.5 KDa, an approximate isoelectric point of 11.67, 101 amino acids [22] and the following biological activities: anticoagulant properties [23], insecticidal properties [24], antiparasitic properties [25], cytotoxicity to tumor cells [26] and a clarifying ability of water turbidity similar to aluminum sulfate treatment [22]. Electrochemical methods are sensitive, are financially viable and have a variety of instrument styles and components [27]. These techniques are useful for detecting a diversity of analytes [28\u201330]. Potentiometric and amperometric systems can be used sequentially in the monitoring of industrial waste [31]; they detect, through measurable electrical signals, conformational changes in biomolecules when in contact with a ligand [32]. Electrochemical biosensors are integrated and autonomous devices that use a biochemical receptor to obtain analytical information. These instruments have been designed for several applications [33,34]. Among such applications is the monitoring of water pollutants due to the high sensitivity of biosensors and their application in real time, which are features that have attracted the attention of researchers [35]. Considering that there are different physical, chemical and biological methods for wastewater treatment, it is difficult to choose a single procedure for the efficient removal of dyes from the textile industry [36]. Coagulation corresponds to the first stage of water treatment in the supply networks; it is used to reduce turbidity and coloration, as well as to eliminate pathogens [37]. One of the promising methods for this purpose is electrocoagulation [37,38], which consists of an alternative method to chemical treatment and occurs by destabilizing pollutant particles [39] through redox processes, promoted by an electric current applied in an electrochemical cell. The system is composed of metallic electrodes, which can be iron or aluminum electrolyte solutions [40]. The reaction generates coagulant substances, which can be metallic hydroxides or polyhydroxides, that are responsible for the flocculation of these particles, which float to the surface [41]. With the intention of reducing the cost of electrocoagulation processes for treating contaminated water, the aluminum electrode used in these reactors can be replaced by recycled aluminum beverage cans by building an aluminum battery; the aluminum that constitutes these cans works as an anode [36,38,42].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 3 of 14\nMOFs, or metal\u2013organic frameworks, comprise two- or three-dimensional structures that form coordination networks with metallic centers and organic ligands [43], which can be presented as nanochannels with adjustable shapes and sizes. Standing out for their qualities, such as the presence of adjustable pores and their large surface area, they have several applications, such as gas separation, emission purification and drug encapsulation [44]. Biosensors that use nanomaterials are paving the way for the development of devices with a better performance for monitoring environmental parameters, such as water quality control [45]. In this work, cMoL was characterized by a potentiometric biosensor and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, an amperometric biosensor was designed using cMoL immobilized in an MOF of [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n, with the objective of monitoring residual indigo carmine dye by simulating a textile effluent degraded by electrocoagulation."

The chromatographic conditions used were the same as those reported by Santos et al. [22] to purify cMoL. A flow rate of 20 mL/h was maintained and, after a washing step with the equilibration solution, the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 1.0 M NaCl. Fractions of 2.0 mL were collected and evaluated for their absorbance at 280 nm and their hemagglutinating activity (HA). The protein concentration was estimated using the method of Lowry et al.

The efficiency of cMoL immobilization in the metal\u2013organic structure [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n contributed to the stability of the biosensor, thus facilitating the electrochemical potentials and showing that the use of an electrochemical system with a modified working electrode can be applied to study the interaction of cMoL with galactose.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 6 of 14Biosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 14\nThe biological performance of lectin correlating structural modifications and surface charge distribution was elucidated by potentiometry [54].

According to Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez-Cejuela et al. [53], the combination of the MOF with luciferase contributed to the conformational stability of this enzyme, facilitating substrate access in a paper bioluminescence biosensor to monitor ATP; in this way, it contributed to the constancy of the data obtained by this device. This biocompatibility was also observed in electrochemical biosensors using polymers such as MOFs and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in assays with enzymes and antibodies [32]. The electrochemical potential was verified in all phases of this analytical system at different concentrations of galactose, with the results observed over a time period of 5 and\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 7 of 14\n10 min (Figure 2A); the mathematical model of bar errors (5%) was applied for these time parameters (Figure 2B). A significant increase was revealed in the electrochemical potential for this time range in relation to the addition of carbohydrates in the electrolytic medium. The characterization of Craylia mollis seed lectin (Cramoll), immobilized on a gold electrode coated with the crystalline polymer MOF [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)2]n with different concentrations of glucose in the electrolytic medium, induced an increase in the electrochemical potential, which was also detected between 5 and 10 min [54]. However, no variation was observed for each specific carbohydrate concentration between the respective analysis times (5 and 10 min), due to the stabilization of the potential generated by the platinum electrode coated with MOF (Pt/MOF/cMoL) (working electrode) in relation to the reference. A significant elevation in these electrochemical potentials was verified by the increase in the concentration of galactose in the electrolyte medium, revealing that this rise in the magnitude of the electrical signal produced in the system was the result of intrinsic conformational changes that occurred on the surface of the immobilized lectin, without altering the native structure of cMoL. The biocompatibility exhibited by MOF for the manufacture of electrochemical biosensors, with a good performance, was generated by the combination of MOF/cMOL. The biological performance of lectin correlating structural modifications and surface charge distribution was elucidated by potentiometry [54]. This redox electroactivity can reveal data characteristics of the equilibrium state through electrochemical methods; the application interface with electrical charges, adsorbed on the surface of the electrode, can be evaluated in a simplified way [32]. The redox-active nature of MOFs favors their application in electrochemical biosensors [43]. This property has an effect on the charge distribution on the surfaces of biomolecules in electrochemical systems that is relevant to understanding their interaction mechanisms and biological properties [55]. This elevation of the electrical signal generated through the electrodes of a biosensor by increasing the concentration of the analyte in an electrochemical cell has been confirmed by Carvalho et al. [54], Mohankumar et al. [33] and Selzer et al. [55]. This electrochemical model with the lectin immobilized in the MOF for the construction of a biosensor has also been verified by Carvalho et al. [54] for evaluating the results of the electrochemical potentials related to the interaction of Cramoll immobilized in an MOF with different concentrations of glucose. The combination of lectins with semiconductors, such as metallic polymers, increases their recognition capacity in biosensors [56]. The immobilization of lectins for sugar recognition offers further advantages among biospecific protein/carbohydrate systems, as they do not undergo structural changes after binding and they can also provide independent carbohydrate-binding domains [57,58]. In addition to the electrochemical biosensor, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the MOF and investigate its interactions with cMoL and galactose (Figure 3). The geometry of the MOF Cu-BTC crystals is represented by a smooth octahedral structure, approximately 2 \u00b5m in size. Figure 3B shows galactose adhered to the MOF surface; in Figure 3C, a globular structure of cMoL adhered to the MOF surface indicates the efficiency of immobilization on the surface of this metal\u2013organic framework and the complete MOF/cMoL/galactose system is represented in Figure 3D. This interaction model was confirmed by the evolution of electrochemical potentials, as shown in Figure 2. SEM is a perfect technological tool that helps with the characterization of biomolecules immobilized on MOFs due to the production of high-resolution images, which are capable of showing the target surface being analyzed [43,54,59,60].

At the anode, aluminum undergoes oxidation, releasing Al3+, which reacts with t e hydroxyl to form Al(OH)3(s), a white pr - ipitate responsible for the coagulation of the dye contained in the solution, according to the following equations:\nAnode: Al(s) \u2192 Al3+(aq) + 3e\u2212, E0 = \u22121.66 V (1)\nCathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e\u2212 \u2192 4OH\u2212, E0 = 0.82 V (2)\nhe potential generated by the battery was equivalent to 3.99 V and allowed electrolysis to treat new dye samples in the system formed by the beaker and iron electrodes (Figure 1). The container was the anode in the battery because it underwent oxidation. The electrons formed in this oxidation traveled through the external wire to the iron electrode, which promoted the reduction of water, forming hydroxide (OH\u2212) and hydrogen (H2), while in the electrode of the iron connected to the copper wire, oxidation of the iron occurred, forming Fe2+, which reacted with the hydroxide to produce Fe(OH)2, a gelatinous precipitate capable of coagulating the dye contained in the solution.\nFe(s) \u2192 Fe2+(aq) + 2e\u2212 (3)\n2H2O + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2 + 2OH\u2212 (4)\nThe pH of the samples with dye was measured to verify the formation of hydroxides in the solution (Table 1).\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 9 of 14\nThe pH values of the samples were measured before and after the electrochemical treatment with iron and aluminum electrodes. There was an increase in the pH of the samples after treatment, suggesting that this increase in pH occurred due to the evolution of hydrogen in the cathode [61]. Our results corroborate the studies presented by Lach et al. [62], who observed an increase in the pH value for the textile effluent in the electrocoagulation process with aluminum electrodes. The techniques commonly applied in the treatment of effluents have a high cost of chemical components, thus stimulating the search for new methods of water treatment [63]. Electrocoagulation methods are more advantageous than other treatments, since they use simple, easy-to-handle instrumentation, and the residual sludge formed can be retained more easily [64]; therefore, this technique is widely used to remove color and decontaminate effluents [65]. Despite this, the method has some limitations, such as electricity consumption, so new improvement alternatives have been investigated [66]. Therefore, the system composed of recycled aluminum cans generating energy to activate the degradation reaction of the dye represents a development of economic and environmental importance. Based on the results obtained (Figure 2) and carefully substantiated by the literature, it appears that the immobilization of cMoL in an MOF of [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n was efficient and facilitated the obtaining of electrochemical potentials, showing that the electrochemical system used with a modified working electrode can be applied to study the interaction of this lectin with indigo carmine dye. In order to build a biosensor to detect dye residues in samples after electrocoagulation with aluminum batteries, cMoL was used to aggregate MOF crystals on a platinum electrode surface, providing stability for the use of this device. This aggregate effect was also verified with Cramoll lectin on the surface of a gold electrode containing an MOF (54). To identify the occurrence of interactions between cMoL and the indigo carmine dye, cyclic voltammetry was performed (Figure 4). According to Mohankumar et al. [33], the oxidation and reduction peaks shown in cyclic voltammograms result from the current variation generated on the surface of the electrodes in an electrochemical biosensor. Electroanalytical methods such as cyclic voltammograms using electrodes modified with nanocomposites are increasingly being required to identify the redox properties of biomolecules [67], such as MOFs, due to their biocompatibility for glucose and H2O2 detection [43]. In this work, through a voltammogram, the treatment efficiency was observed due to the difference in the redox peaks, for which there was a decrease in the current peaks in the treated samples, indicating that cMoL was able to monitor the residues before and after the treatment. No significant difference was verified between the samples treated in aluminum batteries or after electrolysis. In a previous study, cMoL was purified and showed a coagulant capacity for removing impurities in turbid water [22]. The peaks that stood out in the cyclic voltammograms were due to the redox process of the MOF/cMoL interaction with the dye in the untreated samples. This is the first time that an MOF/cMoL/platinum amperometric biosensor has been utilized to detect dye residues after treatment with aluminum batteries and electrolysis, representing a new innovation to control water residues. Electrocoagulation, in addition to its recognized ability to purify contaminated water from industrial effluents, avoids the risk of secondary pollution of the treated material, as it does not require additional chemical products [68].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 10 of 14\nBiosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 14 chemical system used with a modified working electrode can be applied to study the interaction of this lectin with indigo carmine dye.

Electrochemical biosensors are currently considered a high-technology system for detecting target analytes due to their ease of handling, sensitivity, selectivity, speed and the reproducibility of their responses [32]; due to this specificity and sensitivity, these biosensors have excellent applicability for determining contaminants that cause water pollution [45]. The electrocoagulation method was efficient at removing the dye, indicating the possibility of using systems containing reactors with aluminum and copper electrodes for the treatment of effluents from the textile industry. A biosensor using cMoL can be applied for the recognition of dyes in textile industry effluents."

The potentiometric data obtained demonstrated the interaction of cMoL with different concentrations of galactose, as a consequence of the conformational changes that occurred on the lectin surface. The electrocoagulation method was efficient at removing the indigo carmine dye and constitutes a conventional system. Furthermore, the biosensor using MOF/cMoL was able to monitor dye residues in samples treated with iron and aluminum electrodes. The treatment on an industrial scale of effluents contaminated with dyes requires a fast and efficient process, due to the negative effect of these substances on the environment. Aluminum battery reactors for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with synthetic indigo carmine dye are promising for use in the textile industry, as they represent a low-energy-cost technique, with easy handling, using recycled aluminum cans. An amperometric MOF/cMoL biosensor will allow quick and easy dye detection.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 655 11 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: B.F.d.O., S.R.d.S. and L.C.B.B.C. designed the study protocol.
