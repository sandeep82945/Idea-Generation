    "abstractText": "Background: Increased knowledge about factors that can impact changes in adolescents\u2019 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is needed. The present study aimed to investigate possible HRQOL changes in adolescents at 14 and 16 years, and assess the impact of sociodemographic factors, gender, pain, self-esteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress on HRQOL changes over time. Further, to assess HRQOL stratified by gender. Methods: A longitudinal study involving 211 adolescents was conducted. Sociodemographic variables, pain, selfesteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress were all assessed with well-validated instruments. KIDSCREEN-27 was used to measure HRQOL. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, paired samples t-tests, and linear mixed models for repeated measures. Results: When all variables were added to the linear mixed models, stress, loneliness, and pain were significantly, independently associated with a reduction in HRQOL change scores for four of the five KIDSCREEN subscales. Time was significantly associated with a reduction in physical and psychological well-being. Self-efficacy and self-esteem were significantly associated with an increase in HRQOL change scores for four and two subscales, respectively. Male gender was significantly negatively associated with changes in social support and peers compared to female gender. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated a significant decline in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL regarding physical and psychological well-being for the age range 14\u201316 years. Furthermore, we found that stress, loneliness, and pain have a significant negative impact on HRQOL changes, whereas self-esteem and self-efficacy have a significant positive impact. Our results highlight the importance of increased understanding regarding factors associated with changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL to enable accurate and strategic interventions.",

            "text": "Methods: A longitudinal study involving 211 adolescents was conducted. Sociodemographic variables, pain, selfesteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress were all assessed with well-validated instruments. KIDSCREEN-27 was used to measure HRQOL. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, paired samples t-tests, and linear mixed models for repeated measures.\nResults: When all variables were added to the linear mixed models, stress, loneliness, and pain were significantly, independently associated with a reduction in HRQOL change scores for four of the five KIDSCREEN subscales. Time was significantly associated with a reduction in physical and psychological well-being. Self-efficacy and self-esteem were significantly associated with an increase in HRQOL change scores for four and two subscales, respectively. Male gender was significantly negatively associated with changes in social support and peers compared to female gender.\nConclusion: Our results demonstrated a significant decline in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL regarding physical and psychological well-being for the age range 14\u201316 years. Furthermore, we found that stress, loneliness, and pain have a significant negative impact on HRQOL changes, whereas self-esteem and self-efficacy have a significant positive impact. Our results highlight the importance of increased understanding regarding factors associated with changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL to enable accurate and strategic interventions.\nKeywords: Health-related quality of life, Longitudinal, Adolescent, Resilience, Stress, Loneliness\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

According to the World Health Organization, \u201cInvestments in adolescent health bring a triple dividend of benefits for adolescents now,\n*Correspondence: hilde.e.mikkelsen@uia.no\n1 Department of Health and Nursing, Faculty of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Agder, Postbox 422, 4604 Kristiansand, Norway Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nfor their future adult lives, and for the next generation. Their health and well-being are engines of change in the drive to create healthier, more sustainable societies\u201d [3, p. iv]. To invest in adolescent health, more information about their own perspectives is needed. Thus, in recent years, there has been an increased focus on understanding, improving, and mapping adolescents\u2019 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [3\u20135]. HRQOL is a multidimensional construct that includes the individual\u2019s subjective perspectives of the physical, psychological, functional, and social aspects of health [6].\nHRQOL is influenced by both individual and environmental characteristics [7]. The adolescence phase is characterized by rapid physical, cognitive, emotional, pubertal, and social changes and an increase in autonomy and independence from caregivers that may lead to vulnerability related to health and HRQOL [1\u20133, 8]. Previous studies have found that adolescents\u2019 HRQOL seems to deteriorate with age and that girls tend to report lower HRQOL than boys [4, 9, 10]. Self-efficacy, self-esteem, and social support have been found to be positively associated with HRQOL, while low socioeconomic status (SES), pain, loneliness, and stress have been negatively associated with HRQOL in general adolescent populations [11\u201320]. Most Norwegian adolescents report good health [21]; however, health challenges such as loneliness, stress, and pain seem to be increasing in both Norwegian and international adolescent populations [2, 21\u201324]. Recent studies have shown that the COVID\u201019 pandemic and its protective strategies (e.g., social distancing) have affected the well-being and behavior of adolescents\u2014 leading to, for example, increased stress and loneliness, lower life satisfaction, and reduced HRQOL [24\u201330].\nLongitudinal studies of adolescents\u2019 HRQOL can provide a clearer picture of the magnitude and direction of change in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL, help identify factors associated with change over time, and confirm or disconfirm the results of cross-sectional studies [10, 31]. Relatively few studies have investigated how HRQOL changes over time in general adolescent populations. It should be noted that most previous studies are cross-sectional, and most longitudinal studies have focused on specific groups of adolescent populations, such as clinical populations (e.g., selected patient groups). Furthermore, most longitudinal studies have considered only a limited set of potential predictive factors of adolescents\u2019 HRQOL\u2014 for example, gender, SES, and age. Thus, there is a need for longitudinal studies that investigate HRQOL in general adolescent populations and include a wide range of potential predictive factors of HRQOL changes. Considering that adolescence is a period when different behaviors are adopted and may track into adulthood, increased knowledge of factors related to changes in adolescents\u2019\nHRQOL is necessary to plan effective policies and health promotion interventions [32]. We have previously demonstrated that HRQOL is associated with sociodemographic factors, gender, pain, self-esteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress in a school-based population of 14-to-15-year-old adolescents [14, 20]. In the present study, we aim to further investigate the impact of these specific factors on HRQOL changes over time.\nIn Norway, the transition from lower secondary to upper secondary school normally involves a change in school institutions for 16-year-old adolescents. School transitions might disrupt established peer groups but also provide opportunities for developing new friendships [33], which may affect adolescents\u2019 well-being [34]. Peer interaction is especially important during adolescence [35], and spending time with friends is considered essential for adolescents\u2019 quality of life [36]. Therefore, longitudinal HRQOL studies covering the transition period from lower secondary to upper secondary school are important.\nThe primary aims of this study are to investigate possible HRQOL changes in adolescents at 14 and 16\u00a0years, and assess the impact of sociodemographic factors, gender, pain, self-esteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress on HRQOL changes over time. Secondary aim was to assess HRQOL stratified by gender."

            "text": "An electronic survey tool that consecutively administered the following questionnaires was used. All questionnaires had previously been translated into Norwegian. Most questions included a neutral option, resulting in all items being answered. All questionnaires that used sum scales showed satisfactory Cronbach\u2019s alpha values above .7 (Additional file\u00a01).\nThe first part of the questionnaire included selfreported data on demographic variables such as gender, age, parental members of the household, parents\u2019 birthplace, and parents\u2019 work status. HRQOL was assessed using the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire [38, 39], which is a multidimensional measure of generic HRQOL in adolescents. KIDSCREEN-27 consists of 27 questions organized into five subscales: (1) physical well-being, (2) psychological well-being, (3) autonomy and parent relations, (4) social support and peers, and (5) school environment [38, 40, 41]. The questionnaire is scored on a 5-point Likert scale referring to the last week, indicating either the frequency of certain feelings or behaviors or the intensity of an attitude. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL. In line with the KIDSCREEN handbook [40], Rasch scores were computed for each subscale and transformed into t-values normed to a mean (SD) of 50 (10) which can be compared with international t-values. The Norwegian KIDSCREEN-27 version has been shown to be valid and reliable [39]. Self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg SelfEsteem scale (RSES) four-item version [42], where respondents rate four self-perception statements on a 4-point Likert scale. The respondent\u2019s scores were summed and divided by 4 to obtain an RSES score ranging from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem. The Norwegian RSES four-item version has demonstrated a high degree of correlation (0.95) with the original 10-item version [43] and has previously been used among adolescents [14, 44]. Self-efficacy was assessed using the Generalized Self\u2010 Efficacy Scale (GSE), which consists of 10 items that measure optimistic self-beliefs in coping with the challenges, demands, and tasks of life in general [45, 46]. The items are rated on a 4-point scale, and scores on each item are summed and divided by 10 to obtain a GSE score ranging from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate higher levels of generalized self\u2010efficacy. The Norwegian GSE has been shown to be valid and reliable [14, 47]. Loneliness was assessed using the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale eight-item version (ULS-8), which is rated on a 4-point scale [48]. The total score ranges from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of loneliness. ULS-8 is an adequate and reliable measure of loneliness\namong adolescents [48\u201350], and the Norwegian ULS-8 has shown satisfactory internal consistency [14]. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), which consists of 30 items that refer to the previous four weeks [51, 52]. The items are rated on a 4-point scale. The PSQ total score is linearly transformed between 0 and 1; PSQ = (raw value \u2013 30) / 90. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived stress. Commonly used cutoff levels of stress within PSQ are as follows: low (< .33), medium (.33\u2013.45), moderate (.45\u2013.60), and severe (> .60) [51]. The Norwegian PSQ has demonstrated good reliability and validity [53]. Pain was assessed using one question from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) [54, 55]\u2014which measures the subjective intensity of pain on average and is rated on a 0\u201310-point scale, where higher scores indicate more pain. The Norwegian BPI has satisfactory psychometric properties [55] and has been used among adolescents [56]. We also used two questions from the L\u00fcbeck PainScreening Questionnaire to assess pain duration and pain frequency [57]. These questions were only administered to those who rated 1 or more on the BPI\u2019s \u201cpain on average\u201d question (indicating they had pain). The L\u00fcbeck Pain-Screening Questionnaire has shown satisfactory validity, and the Norwegian version has been used among adolescents [58]."

These independent variables were collected at time 1 (baseline).\nWe used an unstructured covariance structure with no specific parametric form. The random effects of variables schools (N = 22) and county (N = 4) were also estimated; however, this did not affect the estimates of fixed effects and the overall performance of the models. Thus, we removed the random effects from the models to save statistical power. The results are presented as regression coefficients B with 95% CI and p-values. All analyses were considered exploratory, and no correction for multiple testing was done. Hence, our results should be confirmed by other longitudinal studies. p values \u2264 .05 were considered statistically significant."

It is important to note that while the adolescents\u2019 HRQOL scores reported at time 1 are comparable to European norms, their HRQOL scores reported at time 2 are notably lower compared to European norms [40]. This should be viewed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, several studies have reported lower HRQOL scores in adolescents compared to the results of previous studies in adolescent populations [26\u201330].\nStress at age 14\u201315\u00a0 years was significantly negatively associated with a reduction in HRQOL change scores in four KIDSCREEN subscales, although the stress score in our sample indicated low levels of stress. In line with previous findings [14], we found that stress had the highest negative effect on the KIDSCREEN subscale autonomy and parent relations, underscoring the need to be aware of the negative impact stress seems to have on this HRQOL dimension, which reflects the quality of adolescent and parent interactions, the feeling of love and support by family, and adolescents\u2019 perceived autonomy [40]. Our findings confirm that stress is a considerable risk factor for adolescents\u2019 HRQOL [14, 17], and add to\nexisting knowledge by indicating that this is evident even with low levels of stress.\nHigher levels of loneliness were associated with a decrease in HRQOL change scores, confirming the result from a previous cross-sectional study [14]. Adolescence is a life phase where biological, cognitive, social, and demographic changes may influence loneliness [59]. Furthermore, feelings of loneliness may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [24]. Hence, we emphasize that loneliness should be viewed as a significant threat to changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL during and after the pandemic.\nThe median intensity of pain reported at time 1 of 2.0 is not considered high. Nevertheless, pain was significantly associated with a reduction in HRQOL change scores in four KIDSCREEN subscales. Thus, our results support previous studies demonstrating a negative association between pain and HRQOL in adolescents [14, 20] and indicate that this is evident even with low levels of pain. Moreover, we found that pain had its highest negative effect on school environment, which explores the adolescents\u2019 feelings about school, the perception of\nTable 4 (continued)\nSchool environment\nB 95% CI p value\nTime\n2021 \u2212 1.27 \u2212 2.61 to 0.06 .062 2019 (Ref.) 1\nGender\nBoy \u2212 0.58 \u2212 2.28 to 1.12 .503 Girl (Ref.) 1\nParental members of the household\nBoth parents \u2212 1.94 \u2212 4.29 to 0.42 .106 Alternates between two parents \u2212 1.19 \u2212 4.02 to 1.64 .409 One parent and/or other caregivers (Ref.) 1\nParents\u2019 birthplace\nBoth parents born in Norway \u2212 0.03 \u2212 0.87 to 1.80 .972 One or both parents born in another country (Ref.) 1\nParents\u2019 work status\nBoth parents are working 1.21 \u2212 0.80 to 3.22 .238 One parent is working (Ref.) 1\nPain on average \u2212 0.68 \u2212 1.07 to \u2212 0.29 .001 Self-esteem 1.10 \u2212 0.38 to 2.58 .146 Self-efficacy 5.73 3.72 to 7.74 < .001 Loneliness \u2212 0.20 \u2212 0.39 to \u2212 0.02 .030 Stress \u2212 1.33 \u2212 1.9 to \u2212 0.70 < .001\nLinear mixed model analyses were performed separately for each of the five KIDSCREEN-27 subscales as the dependent variables\nHRQOL was analyzed with KIDSCREEN-27 subscales.

Hence, we accentuate the need for interventions aiming to reduce the negative impact pain seems to have on changes in HRQOL related to the school environment.\nOur results confirm the positive association between higher levels of self-esteem and self-efficacy and an increase in HRQOL change scores. Self-efficacy and self-esteem are both considered resilient factors [60]. Resilience refers to having a relative resistance to risk experiences or overcoming adversity or stress [61]. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of resilience factors for HRQOL over time and call attention to the need for interventions aimed at increasing adolescents\u2019 resilience. Resilience interventions can increase adolescents\u2019 protective behaviors and coping skills\u2014which can help them manage daily stressors, allowing for greater wellbeing and academic success [62]. Moreover, resilience factors may protect adolescents\u2019 mental health in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic [63].\nGirls reported lower levels of HRQOL compared to boys at age 14\u201315\u00a0years and at age 16\u201317\u00a0years. This confirms findings from previous longitudinal studies among adolescents [4, 9, 10]. Nevertheless, in four KIDSCREEN subscales, we found no significant association between gender and changes in HRQOL. For these subscales, our results may indicate that gender-related differences in HRQOL remained unchanged during youth. A possible explanation may be that gender is an important factor concerning HRQOL but that part of the gender-related differences in HRQOL might be explained by genderrelated differences within other factors associated with HRQOL [10, 14, 15]. Surprisingly, for the subscale social support and peers, we found that male gender was associated with lower HRQOL scores compared to female gender. The subscale social support and peers explores adolescents\u2019 perceived support and the quality of the interaction between adolescents and peers [40]. Hence, our findings may be explained by previous research showing that adolescent boys report higher levels of social loneliness, which refers to the absence of a broader accessible and supportive social network, compared to girls [59]. Moreover, loneliness in boys is considered more sensitive to their interpersonal relationships [64].\nA negative association between changes in HRQOL and low SES was not supported by our findings\u2014except for the factor parents\u2019 work status, which showed that both parents being employed was associated with higher scores in the adolescents\u2019 physical well-being compared to when only one parent was employed. We have searched similar studies to find an explanation for this but have found none. Thus, we recommend future studies to further explore our findings. A possible explanation\nfor our results regarding SES may be that other factors (e.g., stress, loneliness, and self-efficacy) outweighed the effect of SES. Furthermore, the results may have been influenced by high SES in our sample."

All these factors were assessed with well-validated instruments. The overall response rate was only 30.3%, which is a limitation. Attrition can be a major methodological problem in longitudinal studies and may deteriorate the generalizability of findings [65]. The scores for sociodemographic factors, pain, self-esteem, self-efficacy, loneliness, and stress among the responders (N = 211) are similar to previous findings among the potential participants (N = 696) [14], indicating that the responders at time 2 were similar to the non-responders. However, the responders consisted of more girls (68%) compared to the sample of potential participants (57.5%). This may have influenced the results. Furthermore, it is important to note that more than two-thirds of the participants lived with both parents, had parents who were both born in Norway, and had parents both employed, indicating high SES. Thus, the results may not be representative of adolescents from low SES families. This should be considered when interpreting our results. Moreover, we did not control for other possible confounders\u2014for example, depression, anxiety, bullying, and physical activity. Hence, we recommend controlling for other confounders in future studies."

The findings provide insight into a complex life phase and confirm that several factors can influence changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL, such as stress, loneliness, pain, self-esteem, and self-efficacy. We recommend future health-promoting interventions among adolescents to target these factors. Considering that the ongoing COVID\u201019 pandemic is leading to increased stress and loneliness and reduced HRQOL in adolescents [25\u201330], an increased understanding of factors associated with HRQOL seems highly relevant.\nBased on previous research [11, 14, 15, 17] and our results showing the importance of self-esteem and\nself-efficacy for HRQOL, we recommend an increased focus on resilience-promoting interventions at school. School interventions can support positive growth and changes to all students within a class, although with more significant effects in the at-risk group [62, 66]. Teachers are considered an important resource in the development of resilience, as they are more likely to know the students\u2019 lived experiences and current helpseeking and coping strategies [62]. We also highlight the need to involve parents regarding resilience promotion. The involvement of parents is considered a key component of effective resilience interventions, as parents are important influencers and role models for adolescents [66, 67].\nIn future studies to explore our findings more thoroughly, the sample should be extended and include more boys and adolescents with an immigrant background, with low SES, and who live with only one parent. Future studies may also analyze the development of HRQOL in adolescents over a longer period and include possible confounders not included in the present study, such as depression, anxiety, bullying, and physical activity. Furthermore, qualitative data are needed to gain more indepth knowledge of factors associated with changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL over time."

            "text": "Our study provides important insight into changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL at two time points when they were 14 and 16\u00a0 years, and into factors associated with these changes. We found a significant decline in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL regarding physical and psychological well-being during these two years. Further, we found that stress, loneliness, and pain have a significant negative impact on HRQOL changes, whereas self-esteem and self-efficacy have a significant positive impact. Our results highlight the importance of increased understanding regarding factors associated with changes in adolescents\u2019 HRQOL to be able to intervene accurately and strategically.\nAbbreviations BPI: Brief pain inventory; CI: Confidence interval; GSE: General self-efficacy scale; HRQOL: Health-related quality of life; LPQ: L\u00fcbeck Pain-Screening Questionnaire; PSQ: Perceived Stress Questionnaire; RSES: Rosenberg self-esteem scale; SD: Standard deviation; SES: Socioeconomic status; ULS: UCLA loneliness scale.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12955- 022- 02035-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
