Background: men who have sex with men (MSM) are a high-risk group for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and the HPV vaccine is effective in preventing it. However, according to risk compensation theory, people may increase sexual risk behaviors after receiving HPV vaccination. Based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), this study investigated the influencing factors to predict intention to reduce condom use (risk compensation intention) among MSM after taking HPV vaccination in southwest China. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study among 948 MSM in southwest China using a non-probability sampling method and an electronic questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual risk behavior characteristics, HPV-related prevention behavior, and the HAPA scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using a structural equation model. Results: among 948 MSM, the incidence rate of reducing the frequency of condom use was 14.1%. The structural equation model showed that self-efficacy (β = −0.378, p = 0.020) and positive outcome expectancy (β = 0.366, p < 0.05) had greater effects on behavioral intention, followed by negative outcome expectancy (β = −0.296, p < 0.05) and risk perception (β = −0.232, p < 0.05). Conclusions: risk compensation may not be a major barrier to receiving HPV vaccination among MSM. Nevertheless, the recognition of possible risk compensation is necessary to implement appropriate interventions to reduce the occurrence of risk compensation. 1. conclusions The HAPA model could be used to predict the risk compensation intention after taking HPV vaccination among MSM in southwest China, in which self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancy are the important predictor factors. Risk compensation may not be a major barrier to receiving HPV vaccination among MSM. Nevertheless, it is necessary to acknowledge possible risk compensation.
