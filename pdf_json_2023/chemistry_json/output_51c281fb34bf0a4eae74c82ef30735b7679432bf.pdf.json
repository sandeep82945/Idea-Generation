    "abstractText": "Chromatographic fractionation of a methanol extract of Helichrysum rutilans afforded seven known compounds. The isolated compounds were identified as 5,7,8-trihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyflavone8-O-2-methyl-2-butanoate (C-1), 5,7-dihydroxy-3,6,8-trimethoxyflavone (C-2), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (C-3), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (C-4), ent-kaurenoic acid (C-5), ent-kauran-18-al (C-6), and 15-\u03b1-hydroxy-(-)-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (C-7). Compounds C-1\u2013C-4 demonstrated high antioxidant capacities on ORAC hydroxyl radical (2.114 \u00b1 4.01; 2.413 \u00b1 6.20; 1.924 \u00b1 16.40; 1.917 \u00b1 3.91) \u00d7 106; ORAC peroxyl radical (3.523\u00b1 3.22; 2.935\u00b1 0.13; 2.431\u00b1 8.63; 2.814\u00b1 5.20)\u00d7 103 \u03bcMTE/g; and FRAP (1251.45 \u00b1 4.18; 1402.62 \u00b1 5.77) \u03bcMAAE/g, respectively. Moderate inhibitory activities against Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation were observed for C-1\u2013C-4 as IC50 values of 13.123\u00b1 0.34, 16.421 \u00b1 0.92, 11.64 \u00b1 1.72, 14.90 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, while their respective anti-tyrosinase activities with IC50 values of 25.735 \u00b1 9.62, 24.062 \u00b1 0.61, 39.03 \u00b1 13.12, 37.67 \u00b1 0.98 \u03bcg/mL were also observed. All compounds demonstrated TEAC values within the range of 1105\u20131424 \u03bcMTE/g. The result is an indication that a methanol extract of H. rutilans might possibly be a good source of natural antioxidants against ailments caused by cellular oxidative stress and as inhibitors against skin depigmentation, as well as possible raw materials needed for slowing down perishable agricultural products. This is the first report on the phytochemical and biological evaluation of H. rutilans.",

            "text": "Oxygen serves as an important molecule for various cellular and metabolic processes. Nevertheless, this beneficial molecule can also be detrimental for living cells at a threshold level of accumulation. Disequilibrium between the cellular production and the oxidative stress clearing process may trigger the production of various free radical molecules [1]. In addition, persistent exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation generated primarily from sunlight and other activities (such as the use of sun/tanning beds) may result in premature/untimely skin aging (photoaging), characterized by uneven formation of pigments and loss of structural integrity of the skin, and also in damage to perishable agricultural products [2,3]. Considering various detrimental impacts of free radicals on essential elements in the human body, extensive research on naturally occurring phytochemicals with antioxidant properties is becoming a point of great interest. One such natural phytochemical group of compounds with notable antioxidant activity is flavonoids, with flavones, an\nPlants 2023, 12, 2870. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12152870 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2023, 12, 2870 2 of 13\nimportant subgroup of flavonoids, predominantly distributed in the plant kingdom [4]. Evidence based on pharmacological data has shown that flavones are well-known for their beneficial health effects and wide applications in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics/cosmeceutical, and medicinal sectors [5]. These beneficial effects can be structurally and biologically attributed to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, coupled with their capacities to modulate the activities of key cellular enzymes [6]. Diterpenes, on the other hand, are natural products structurally based on a podocarpane carbon skeleton, with only moderate antioxidant activity, with the exception of some diterpenes having multiple phenolic attachments [7]. A previous review reported on the established ethnomedicinal significance of diterpenes, ranging from antioxidant and anticancer activities and roles as mediators in metabolic diseases [8]. Helichrysum rutilans is a dense twiggy shrublet (\u2264600 mm tall) with characteristic lemon-yellow bracts. It occurs in sandy or stony soils of the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces and southern parts of the Free State in South Africa [9]. No traditional or scientific information about this plant has been documented in the literature according to SciFinder and the dictionary of natural products databases (as of July 2022). Although a great deal of research has been carried out on the genus Helichrysum, registered background information on H. rutilans is lacking with respect to its scientific and medicinal usage. This research was connected to the motivation for the medicinal possibilities of H. rutilans to possess phytochemicals with notable biological activities, due to previous scientific information documented on numerous phytochemicals isolated from South African Helichrysum species with varying degrees of biological and pharmacological importance [10]. The current study aims to elucidate the phytochemical and biological significance of secondary metabolites produced by H. rutilans."

The fluorescein solution and sample were added to the wells of an illuminated 96-well plate, and 12 \u00b5L of each of our samples (in stock solution of 1 mg/mL) was combined with 138 \u00b5L of a fluorescein working solution followed by the addition of 50 \u00b5L of 150 mg of AAPH prepared in situ in 6 mL phosphate buffer. Absorbance was measured using the Fluoroskan spectrum plate reader with the excitation wavelength set at 485 nm and the emission wavelength at 530 nm. A calibration curve was established using a trolox stock solution of concentrations in the range of 83\u2013417 \u00b5M (R2 = 0.9514). The ORAC values were calculated using a regression equation (Y = a + bX + cX2) between trolox concentration (Y in \u00b5M) and the net area under the fluorescence decay curve (X). ORAC values were expressed as micromoles of trolox equivalents (TEs) per milligram of test sample. Samples without a perfect curve were further diluted and the dilution factors were used for the result calculations of such samples.\n2.4.3. Trolox Equivalent Absorbance Capacity (TEAC) Assay\nThe total antioxidant activity of the test sample was measured using previously described methods [15,16]. The stock solutions which contained 7 mM ABTS and 140 mM potassium-peroxodisulphate (K2S2O8) (Merck, Johannesburg, South Africa) were prepared and kept at \u22122 \u25e6C. The working solution was then prepared by adding 88 \u00b5L K2S2O8 solution to 5 mL ABTS solution. The two solutions were thoroughly mixed and allowed to react for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. Trolox (6-hydrox-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman2-carboxylic acid) was used as the standard with concentrations ranging between 0 and 500 \u00b5M. After 24 h, the ABTS mix solution was diluted with ethanol to read a start-up absorbance (control) of approximately 2.0 (\u00b10.1). The stock solution (1 mg/mL) of a methanol extract (HT) and purified compounds (25 \u00b5L) were allowed to react with 300 \u00b5L ABTS in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 734 nm at 25 \u25e6C on the plate reader. The results were expressed as \u00b5M trolox equivalents per milligram dry weight (\u00b5M TE/g) of the test samples.\n2.4.4. Inhibition of Fe (II)-Induced Microsomal Lipid Peroxidation Assay\nA previously described method [17] was used with a few modifications. The reaction mixture contained microsomes (1 mg of protein/mL in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer; pH 7.4, supplemented with 1.15% KCl, m/v) isolated from an S9 liver fraction using a sepharose column. The positive control included microsomes, buffer, and ferrous sulphate, in the absence of the samples to be tested. The sample stock solutions (HR and C-1\u2013C-7) were prepared in methanol (1 mg/mL, w/v). The working sample solutions were prepared in 0.01M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1.15% KCl (m/v) diluted to 26.750, 13.375, 6.688, 3.344, 1.672, and 0.836 \u00b5g/mL concentrations. A total of 100 \u00b5L of each sample (working solutions) was dissolved in potassium phosphate buffer and pre-incubated with 500 \u00b5L microsomes at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min in a shaking water bath. A total of 200 \u00b5L of KCl buffer was added to the mixture, followed by 200 \u00b5L of a 2.5 mM ferrous sulphate solution and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 1 h in a shaking water bath. The reaction was terminated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA, m/v) solution (1 mL) containing 125 \u00b5L butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 0.01%) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min; 1 mL of supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) solution. The reaction mixture was then incubated in a water bath at 90 \u25e6C for 20 min and\nPlants 2023, 12, 2870 7 of 13\nthe absorbance was measured at 532 nm using Multiskan plate reader. EGCG, dissolved in methanol, was used as positive control. The percentage inhibition of TBARS formation relative to the positive control was calculated by\nAcontrol \u2212 Asample Acontrol \u00d7 100\n2.4.5. Tyrosinase Enzyme Assay\nThis assay was performed using previously described methods [18,19] with slight modifications. Samples were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) to a stock solution of 1 mg/mL (w/v). Further dilutions were carried out with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) for all working solutions to the concentrations of 100.00, 50.00, 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, 3.12, and 1.56 \u00b5g/mL. Kojic acid dissolved in DMSO was used as a control drug. In the wells of a 96-well plate, 70 \u00b5L of each sample of working solution was combined with 30 \u00b5L of tyrosinase (Sigma-Aldrich CAS No. 9002-10-2, from mushroom, 500 Units/mL in sodium phosphate buffer) in triplicate. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 110 \u00b5L of substrate (2 mM L-tyrosine, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS No. 35424-81-8) dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer was added to each well. Final concentrations of the crude extract, isolated compounds, and positive control (kojic acid) ranged from 1.0 to 100 \u00b5g/mL (m/v). The sample control was made up of each sample with sodium phosphate buffer. The reacting mixture was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a plate reader. The percentage of tyrosinase inhibition was calculated as follows:\n(A\u2212 B)\u2212 (C\u2212 D) (A\u2212 B) \u00d7 100\nwhere A is the absorbance of the control with the enzyme, B is the absorbance of the control without the enzyme, C is the absorbance of the test sample with the enzyme, and D is the absorbance of the test sample without the enzyme.\n2.4.6. Elastase Inhibition Assay\nInhibition of elastase by the test samples was assayed using N-succ-(Ala)3-nitroanilide (SANA) as the substrate, monitoring the release of p-nitroanilide by the method described [18] with little adjustment. The inhibitory activity determined the intensity of color released during cleavage of SANA by the action of elastase. The working reagent for anti-elastase assay was prepared in line with the literature. The preparation involved 1 mM SANA (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS No. 108322-03-8) in 0.1 M tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0. The sample stock solutions were prepared as 1 mg in 1 mL methanol. A total of 200 \u00b5L of already prepared SANA was added to the 20 \u00b5L of sample solution (diluted to 100.00, 50.00, 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, and 3.12 \u00b5g/mL concentrations in tris-HCl buffer as working solutions) in a 96-well plate. The mixtures were vortexed and pre-incubated for 10 min at 25 \u25e6C and then 40 \u00b5L of elastase from porcine pancrease (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS No. 39445-21-1, 0.03 Units/mL) prepared in Tris-HCl buffer was added. The mixtures were further incubated for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at 410 nm. Tris-HCl buffer was used as control, while oleanolic acid dissolved in methanol (1 mg/mL, further diluted to 100.00, 50.00, 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, and 3.12 \u00b5g/mL concentrations in tris-HCl buffer) was used as a positive control. The sample control involved the sample and SANA (uninhibited sample). The percentage of elastase inhibition was calculated as follows:\n1\u2212 B A \u00d7 100\nElastase inhibition (%), where A is the enzyme activity without sample and B is the activity in the presence of the sample.\nPlants 2023, 12, 2870 8 of 13"

Chemical structures of compounds C-1\u2013C-7 isolated from H. rutilans.\nMedicinal plant extracts have the potential for being incorporated in cosmetic formulations due to the presence of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that display\nMedicinal plant extracts have the potential for being incorporated in cosmetic for-\nmulations due to the presence of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that display\nbroad applications as antioxidants, capable of combating free radicals generated within the body [26]. During the last decade, natural antioxidants, particularly phenolic compounds, have been under very close scrutiny as potential therapeutic agents against a wide range of ailments including cardiovascular dysfunctions and aging [27]. The type of flavonoids, the degree of methoxylation, and the number of hydroxyl groups are some of the parameters that determine their antioxidant potentials. In general, the differences in antioxidant activity between polyhydroxylated and polymethoxylated flavonoids are most likely due to differences in both hydrophobicity and molecular planarity [28]. Flavonoid radical stability is thought to be increased by the creation of a completely conjugated electron system. This can be accomplished through structural planarity of the flavonoid due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the C3 position on the C-ring, resulting in a flavonol backbone structure. Replacement of 3-OH by a methoxy substituent at this position perturbs this conjugation, thus rendering the flavonoids less active as antioxidants than their corresponding OH at C3 [29]. In agreement with literature data, the present study corroborates the view that structural features of flavonols (3-OH) are an important moiety for antioxidant efficacy [30\u201333]. The total antioxidant activities (Table 2) confirm C-1\u2013C-4 as natural antioxidants but as less active when compared to their hydroxylated analogues previously reported [32]. Our results obtained on the total antioxidant assays, when compared with their corresponding hydroxylated derivatives, therefore described that the methoxylation of flavonoids\nPlants 2023, 12, 2870 11 of 13\nobviously weakened the antioxidant activity, as previously observed [33]. Our results are in agreement with the existing data, which demonstrated that the replacement of the C3 hydroxyl by a methoxy group resulted in a reduction in antioxidant activity. The ability of phenolic compounds to inhibit oxidative damage in lipids was assessed using thiobarbituric acid as a model system. Peroxidation was initiated by the addition of a FeSO4-EDTA mixture. It is well-known that a transition metal like iron may generate highly reactive hydroxyl or alkoxyl radicals (Fenton reaction). The result indicated compounds C-1\u2013C-4 to have mild inhibitory activities against the Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation as indicated by the IC50 values of 13.123\u00b1 0.34, 16.421\u00b1 0.92, 11.64\u00b1 1.72, 14.90 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. This suggests that C-1\u2013C-4 possess a feasible mechanism for iron-chelating and iron-stabilizing capacity due to the presence of 3-OMe and 5-OH in conjugation with the 4-keto group. It is also an indication that the lone pair of electrons on OMe contributes to the antioxidant activities of compounds investigated. Previous work illustrated the significant role of these features in the more potent antioxidant capacity due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between 5-OH and 4-keto groups, which helps to further stabilize the flavone radicals formed [32,34\u201338]. Compounds C-1\u2013C-4, in addition to lipophilicity, may therefore serve as a source of good antioxidants due to their ability to stabilize Fe2+, thereby reducing the production of the reactive hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b7) during the Fenton reaction [39]. Due to the everyday growing market of cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals, tyrosinase inhibitors have received special attention because of their ability to alleviate hyperpigmentation and undesirable browning of food products. Efforts are geared towards the sourcing of more suitable options obtained from compounds of natural origin due to their excellent pharmacological properties and commendably high safety margins, demonstrated by tyrosinase inhibitors isolated from nature [40,41]. When tyrosinase enzyme activity is inhibited, melanin production is reduced, resulting in fairer skin [42,43]. Amongst the H. rutilans constituents investigated for anti-tyrosinase activity in Table 3, compounds C-1\u2013C-4 demonstrated moderate inhibition of tyrosinase (with respective IC50 values of 25.735 \u00b1 9.62, 24.062 \u00b1 0.61, 39.03 \u00b1 13.12, 37.67 \u00b1 0.98 \u00b5g/mL), but remained less potent than the control included, kojic acid (IC50 = 3.511\u00b1 1.44 \u00b5g/mL). The presence of conjugation in the C-1\u2013C-4 rings further gives rise to a resonance effect in both rings, thereby providing stability to the respective flavone radicals formed [35,44\u201346]. No significant inhibitory activity was recorded when the samples were tested for their inhibition of elastase activity at the threshold concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL."

Seven known compounds were isolated and characterized by our previous analytical tools. Flavones have been shown to possess good antioxidant activity and have been implicated as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation. The evidence presented from this study suggests that a dietary intake of flavonoid-containing foods may be of benefit in lowering the risk of certain pathophysiologies associated with free radical-mediated events. This in vitro study showed that a methanol extract of H. rutilans can be considered a good antioxidant and skin depigmentation option for the relevant industries. Possible cosmeceutical products aimed against photo-oxidation of the skin can be formulated by including the constituents of H. rutilans, but further investigations are first required to ascertain possible undesirable side-effects on the skin. Furthermore, in vivo studies might be required to establish the usage of H. rutilans and its isolates in the formulation of cosmetic products.
