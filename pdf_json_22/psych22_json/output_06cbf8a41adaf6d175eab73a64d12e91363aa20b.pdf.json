Introduction\nn modern psychiatry, and medicine in general, finding the ppropriate experimental design that provides reliable sigal detection for medication efficacy and ensures trial ntegrity is of paramount importance. Randomized clincal trials (RCTs) include placebo-controlled and activeomparator trials. Placebo-controlled trials are widely conidered the gold standard for the evaluation of new medcations ( Healy, 2003 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). In a placeboontrolled trial, the efficacy of the experimental intervenion is established by demonstration of its superiority to lacebo in producing the desired effect ( Krol et al., 2020 ). rials involving active comparators can be either superiority rials or non-inferiority trials. In a superiority trial, a new gent is compared to an existing agent(s) to evaluate if the ew one outperforms the old in terms of efficacy and/or tolrability. A non-inferiority trial also compares a new agent gainst an established one, but the new agent is required o demonstrate that it is not worse than the proven drug Pocock, 2003 ). The use of placebo raises several issues that are the subect of uncertainty and informal debate. First, placebo is ot a standard of care, and placebo tablets per se are not art of modern medical practice. Placebo controlled ranomized trials are accordingly experiments, always somehat removed from ordinary care. Second, rates of \u2018reponse\u2019 to placebo appear to have been rising in some psyhiatric indications, notably in major depression disorder Howick, 2009 ; Khan et al., 2017 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; alsh et al., 2002 ). Placebo, in the context of a clinial trial, is both a physical object (a pharmacologically inert pill, identical in appearance to an active compara-\nrials, in particular placebo-controlled trials, for drug approval, ebate in the scientific community and beyond. This study ofs from clinical and academic experts to guide the selection iatry. Forty-one highly cited clinical psychiatrists and/or rehi survey. Consensus statements were developed based on the iewed systematic review. Participants evaluated statements in e Delphi method. The expert panel achieved consensus on 7 ng the use of randomized clinical trials . The endorsed recomm placebo-controlled trials are the most reliable and (ii) are lacebo-effect; (iii) it is ethical to enroll patients in placebot is available, if there is no evidence of increased health risk; new drugs with the same efficacy as existing treatments, but s; (v) Non-inferiority trials incur an increased risk of approving risk of approving an ineffective drug justifies trial designs that eriority trials incur the risk of rejecting potentially efficacious mendations inform the choice of trial-design appropriate for ical drugs. The recommendations strongly support the use of eral, and the use of placebo-controlled trials in particular. ll rights reserved.\nor) but also probably a psychosocial intervention related o the intensity of attention and care in a clinical trial de Craen et al., 1999 ; Ovosi et al., 2017 ). This usually xceeds the attention granted in ordinary practice. Such on-specific effects can magnify the placebo effect; it can hen become impossible to detect the superiority of an ctive comparator. In addition, it can be difficult to disinguish negative trials from failed trials when unexpectdly high placebo response rates eclipse the potential inrinsic efficacy of a pharmacologic compound, essentially ncreasing the risk of a Type II error ( Kemp et al., 2010 ; ocock & Stone, 2016 ). Finally, patient groups must have ssay sensitivity; the experimental design must have poential to show a differential effect of treatment by apropriate choice of treatment groups ( Howick, 2009 ). In he extreme case, some patients may respond to any inervention and some may respond to none: inclusion of arge numbers of either such patient will invalidate any trial esign. The choice of trial design has an enormous impact on the utcomes of a study, and the choice is influenced by differnt factors, that are not necessarily evidence-based. Based n the findings of a systematic review of the literature by rol et al. (2020) , a Delphi study ( Linstone & Turoff, 1975 ) as conducted to obtain consensus among expert clinicians nd researchers on the role of RCTs in clinical psychopharacology. Defining current clinical opinion could help to reolve any discrepancy between what is allowed by the decaration of Helsinki, the set of ethical principles developed y the World Medical Association for conducting human exeriments, and what researchers feel comfortable performng ( Batra & Howick, 2017 ).\n2\n2\nF 2 r p A r t n r\n2\n2 T e t t c\ng i t d E o t w\n2 T p T d a ( P\nC s m t p S i w \u2018\no E a r p r s < t\n3\nT 3\nm d e t s d t i p t i e ( i f a t a\n4\nT r a c o d g i n s e T s t i l\n. Experimental procedures\n.1. Selection of statements for the Delphi survey\nollowing a published systematic review of the relevant literature, 1 value statements were chosen based on prevalent arguments egarding different types of RCTs (superiority, non-inferiority, lacebo-controlled) ( Krol et al., 2020 ; E. Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). n expert task force iteratively developed consensus through seial consensus-based revisions using the Delphi method. Following he survey of initial items, subsequent survey included items that eeded to be re-rated. This process resulted in the final clinical ecommendations.\n.2. Consensus Method\n.2.1. EXPERT PANEL he expert task force was composed of a panel of international xperts on research in psychiatry, selected according to an objecive procedure based on a Scopus search of citations on the specific opic of research in mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and psyhopharmacology. The most cited authors and some additional authors from key eographical areas were identified and invited by e-mail to particpate; 53.2% (41/77) agreed to participate. Experts from 17 counries in Europe, North America, South America, Australia and Midle East Asia participated. The steering committee (D.P., F.K., B.L., .V., and M.H.) initially focused on the discussion and integration f findings from peer-reviewed published research findings on the opic ( Krol et al., 2020 ). Based on the findings of the review, queries ere prepared and approved by the steering committee.\n.2.2. Delphi method he Delphi method is an iterative process of asking an expert anel for their agreement with certain statements ( Linstone & uroff, 1975 ). It was first utilized to predict defense technology uring the Cold War ( Dalkey & Helmer, 1963 ), but has now been pplied to the social sciences and medicine, including psychiatry Lintonen et al., 2014 ; Nolen et al., 2019 ; Pacchiarotti et al., 2013 ; opovic et al., 2014 ). Following a systematic review of the literature, the Steering ommittee formulated 21 statements regarding the use of placebo, uperiority, and non-inferiority trial designs in psychiatry. This foral process used an anonymous iterative survey series wherein paricipants rated statements based on their agreement, using a fiveoint scale ranging from \u2018 strongly disagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree .\u2019 urvey participants did not know the other participants\u2019 responses n each round. After each of the two rounds, the level of conformity as calculated by grouping the answers into \u2018 agree ,\u2019 \u2018 neutral ,\u2019 or disagree .\u2019 Criteria for the Delphi method were established a priori based n similar surveys ( Pacchiarotti et al., 2013 ; Popovic et al., 2015 ). ndorsed items were the items rated as essential or important by t least 80% of participants in both rounds and were included in the ecommendations. Re-rated items: Items rated as essential or imortant by 65-79% of panel experts in the first round, that were then e-rated in round 2. Rejected items were items that received a conensus rating of < 65% in round 1, or re-rated items that achieved 80% rating in round 2 ( Table 3 ). Final recommendations were those hat achieved at least an 80% rating in round 1 or round 2 ( Table 1 ).\n. Results\nhe first survey round was rated by 41 participants and 3 responded to both rounds ( Fig. 1 ). A total of 7 state-\nents derived from the original 21 survey items were enorsed over the two survey rounds by 80% or more of the xpert panel ( Table 1 ). These consensus statements form he recommendations for the choice of experimental deign in randomized clinical trials. The endorsed recommenations were: (i) Results from placebo-controlled trials are he most reliable and (ii) are necessary despite the growng placebo-effect; (iii) it is ethical to enroll patients in lacebo-arms when established treatment is available, if here is no evidence of increased health risk; (iv) There s a need to approve new drugs with the same efficacy as xisting treatments, but with different side-effect profiles; v) Non-inferiority trials incur an increased risk of approving neffective medications; (vi) The risk of approving an inefective drug justifies trial designs that incur higher costs, nd (vii) superiority trials incur the risk of rejecting potenially efficacious treatments. The 14 statements that did not chieve consensus over 80% are shown in Table 3 .\n. Discussion\nhe results of the present study yielded seven endorsed ecommendations on the choice of trial-design in psychitry ( Table 1 ). Experts agreed that results from placeboontrolled trials are more reliable than results from any ther study-design, and that the growing placebo-effect oes not negate the need for placebo-controlled trials. Rearding non-inferiority trials, the panel concluded that the ncreased chance of approving ineffective medications in on-inferiority trials should impact the choice of trial deign. Moreover, they agreed that the risk of approving an inffective drug justifies trial designs that incur higher costs. he experts concurred that use of an active comparator intead of placebo leads to a risk of rejecting valuable new reatments, because it is more difficult to prove superiorty of a medication in active comparator trials. Along these ines, the panel agreed that it is justified to approve a new\n7. Use of an active comparator instead of placebo leads to a risk of rejecting valuable new treatments, because it is more difficult to prove superiority of a medication in an active comparator trial.\n70.7 (round 1) 84.9 (round 2)\nd a t i e o\n4\nT c r t L m s\no a a u t w p t o\no w u i\np f g t l s & 2\nK V\np 2 e t H n r p m\n4\nT a i t o p w 2 K V i n d s f H a & S b g l p G K\nrug with the same efficacy as existing treatments, but with different side-effect profile. With respect to the ethics of rial-design, there was consensus among the panelists that t is not unethical to enroll patients in a placebo-arm when stablished treatment is available, if there is no evidence f increased health risk.\n.1. Placebo-controlled trials\nhe Declaration of Helsinki in 1996 from the World Medial Association initially stated that patients should always eceive the best-known therapy ( WMA, 1996 ); this was ofen simply ignored when choosing trial designs ( Glass, 2008 ; evine, 1999 ). The declaration has had subsequent amendents; the latest version appeared in 2018 ( WMA, 2018 ) and tates in relation to placebo: Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, r no intervention, is acceptable; or Where for compelling nd scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of ny intervention less effective than the best proven one, the se of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine he efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients ho receive any intervention less effective than the best roven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject o additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result f not receiving the best proven intervention. Interpretations of these qualifications clearly remain pen to debate ( Batra & Howick, 2017 ). Thus, how should e define \u2018compelling and scientifically sound reasons\u2019 or nderstand what harms are acceptable (and not serious or rreversible). In the present study experts agreed that \u201cresults from lacebo-controlled trials are more reliable than results rom any other study design\u201d ( Table 1 , Table 2 ). One arument for the reliability of placebo-controlled trials in he literature states and re-states that the design alows for a differential effect of treatment to be demontrated, if one exists ( D\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Ellenberg Temple, 2000 ; Garattini & Bertele, 2009 ; Krol et al., 020 ; Powers et al., 2005 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; Sp\u0142awi n\u0301ski &\nu z\u0301niar, 2004 ; Streiner, 2008 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; ieta & Cruz, 2012 ). There may also be a 7% increase per decade in the lacebo effect in trial for major depression ( Walsh et al., 002 ). The expert panel agreed that \u201cthe growing placeboffect does not negate the need for placebo-controlled rials\u201d (vs only using active-controlled trials) ( Table 1 ). owever, the foregoing data suggest that caution may be eeded in accepting this opinion for major depression. A ising placebo response and a reduced active drug effect in lacebo-controlled trials risks rejecting effective new treatents for depression.\n.2. Non-inferiority trials\nhe corollary to the statement that placebo-controlled trils are the most reliable, is that experts consider nonnferiority and superiority trials less reliable. The argument hat non-inferiority trials are less statistically sound is based n the idea that they are too permissive (vs. superiority or lacebo-controlled trials) and yield approval of weak drugs ith questionable benefit-risk ratios ( D\u2019Agostino et al., 003 ; Powers et al., 2005 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; Sp\u0142awi n\u0301ski & u z\u0301niar, 2004 ; Streiner, 2008 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; ieta & Cruz, 2012 ). The expert panel considers that the ncreased chance of approving ineffective medications in on-inferiority trials should impact the choice of trial esign ( Table 1 ). A valid non-inferiority trial cannot asume that the active comparator will always show efects superior to placebo; this is not always the case. igh placebo or non-specific response rates may occur cross both active arms ( D\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Ellenberg Temple, 2000 ; Powers et al., 2005 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; p\u0142awi n\u0301ski & Ku z\u0301niar, 2004 ; Streiner, 2008 ; Temple & Ellenerg, 2000 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). Non-inferiority trials need reat care because an error-ridden trial will show equivaence between treatments when there is none, driving the ublication of invalid results ( Ellenberg & Temple, 2000 ; arattini & Bertele, 2009 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; Sp\u0142awi n\u0301ski & u z\u0301niar, 2004 ; Streiner, 2008 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ;\n1. It is justified to approve a new drug with the same efficacy as existing treatments, but with a different side-effect profile.\nBatra & Howick, 2017 ; Burger et al., 2011 ; D\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Ellenberg & Temple, 2000 ; Fleischhacker et al., 2003 ; Garattini & Bertele, 2009 ; Howick, 2009 ; Pocock, 2003 ; Shapiro et al., 2010 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012\n2. The risk of approving an ineffective drug justifies trial designs that incur higher costs (more subjects, longer duration etc.) \u2217\nD\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Splawinski & Kuzniar, 2004 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012\n3. Results from placebo-controlled trials are more reliable than results from any other study design.\nD\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Fleischhacker et al., 2003 ; Garattini & Bertele, 2009 ; Hasnain et al., 2018 ; Ovosi et al., 2017 ; Splawinski & Kuzniar, 2004 ; Streiner, 1995 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ; Walsh et al., 2002\n4. The growing placebo-effect does not negate the need for placebo-controlled trials (vs. only using active-controlled trials). D\u2019Agostino et al., 2003 ; Hasnain et al., 2018 ; Pocock, 2003 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; Splawinski & Kuzniar, 2004 ; Streiner, 2008 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ; Walsh et al., 2002 5. It is not unethical to enroll patients in a placebo- arm when established treatment is available, if there is no evidence of increased health risk. Ellenberg & Temple, 2000 ; Hasnain et al., 2018 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ; Walsh et al., 2002 6. The increased chance of approving ineffective medications in non-inferiority trials should impact the choice of trial design. Burger et al., 2011 ; Powers et al., 2005 ; Snapinn, 2014 ; Splawinski & Kuzniar, 2004 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 7. Use of an active comparator instead of placebo leads to a risk of rejecting valuable new treatments, because it is more difficult to prove superiority of a medication in an active comparator trial. Ellenberg & Temple, 2000 ; Pocock, 2003 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 \u2217= Arguments in favor of superiority trials, which are the most expensive trials\n2. Approval of new drugs should always require a placebo-controlled trial. 66.7 (round 2) 3. When treating my patients, I feel comfortable prescribing drugs for off-label indications. 61.0 (round 1) 4. Results from a non-inferiority trial are not as reliable as results from a placebo-controlled trial. 58.5 (round 1) 5. Despite the larger sample size needed in active-controlled superiority trials vs. placebo-controlled trials, it is not justified to expose more patients to a trial drug with unproven efficacy, than expose a lower number of subjects to placebo. 53.7 (round 1) 6. In clinical practice, I would prescribe a new drug that wasn\u2019t tested against placebo. 51.2 (round 1) 7. Considering the increase in placebo response over the years, results from older studies can no longer be directly compared to results from recent studies. 51.2 (round 1) 8. Easier recruitment of participants for active-controlled superiority or non inferiority trials compensates for the larger sample sizes than in placebo- controlled trials. 48.7 (round 1) 9. Established treatments used as active comparators give us less information than placebo. 46.4 (round 1) 10. FDA and EMA should not approve drugs that have not been tested against placebo. 46.4 (round 1) 11. It is justifiable to suspend a patient\u2019s ongoing treatment in a placebo- controlled trial in order to obtain more reliable data on new treatments 46.4 (round 1) 12. Calculated measures of effect size, such as NNT, should not be used as an alternative to head-to-head trials to compare efficacy of different drugs. 46.4 (round 1) 13. The risk of biocreep, the gradual degradation of efficacy of newly approved treatments, does not affect the decision to conduct non-inferiority trials. 46.3 (round 1) 14. Results of active-controlled superiority trials are less reliable than results of placebo-controlled trials. 43.9 (round 1)\nV n t\n4\nT y t S & d v a s ( i b b b i q S a v d t o t P T p n w a P p t d\n4 R d p i o a\na a r s e e e s ( t w c t\na fi n s a b a l a\ns p p n s a j c D s b c m i w o\nb c t u t f m c t e m c c T p a r c\nR\nN\nC\nM r s p t A o t\nieta & Cruz, 2012 ). In principle, a third placebo arm (not ecessarily powered for significance) can offer reassurance hat a non-inferiority trial is valid.\n.3. Superiority trials\nhe literature shows disadvantages in convenience and cost, et advantages in reliability compared to non-inferiority rials ( Batra & Howick, 2017 ; Ellenberg & Temple, 2000 ; p\u0142awi n\u0301ski & Ku z\u0301niar, 2004 ; Temple & Ellenberg, 2000 ; Vieta Cruz, 2012 ). The expert panelists agreed upon practical isadvantages of superiority trials that extend beyond conenience and cost; they could lead to the rejection of valuble new treatments, because it is more difficult to prove uperiority of a medication in an active comparator trial. Table 1 ). Statistically it may be hard to prove superiorty of one efficacious drug over another ( Temple & Ellenerg, 2000 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). The effect size difference etween two active arms is likely to be smaller than that etween an active and placebo arm. This may markedly ncrease the sample size requirements. If this were reuired, as some authorities suggest ( Barbui & Bighelli, 2013 ; pielmans & Kirsch, 2014 ), it would likely lead to fewer drug pprovals and fewer treatment options for patients. It is adantageous to have different drugs with the same indication ue to differences in individual tolerability, in drug-drug ineractions, and in potential efficacy for certain subgroups f patients, in the context of stratified treatment to opimize care for each patient ( Murawiec & Popovic, 2015 ; ocock, 2003 ; Popovic et al., 2012 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). here is an overwhelming consensus (i.e. 100%) among exerts with the statement that, \u201cIt is justified to approve a ew drug with the same efficacy as existing treatments, but ith a different side-effect profile\u201d ( Table 2 ), which is in lignment with the literature ( Fleischhacker et al., 2003 ; ocock, 2003 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ). The heterogeneity of sychiatric disorders leads to variable drug response beween patients, so drugs with similar effect sizes may have istinct clinical impact ( Pocock, 2003 ; Vieta & Cruz, 2012 ).\n.3.1. Limitations of RCTs CTs are used mainly for regulatory purposes in new inustry pharmaceutical therapies and secondary for research urposes. Although RCTs may have not contributed enough n the improvement of mental health indices or overall costs f treatment, they still represent the best research practice vailable. Yet, it is noteworthy that a gap exists between research nd clinical practice. Patients who participate in clinical trils, especially placebo controlled trials , may not be repesentative of \u201creal life patients\u201d, considering that more evere patients (e.g. with suicidal ideation) are usually xcluded. Also, participants are likely to differ in differnt study sites- e.g. EU and USA patients may be differnt, which also determines different placebo group reponse rates, as seen for example in Brexpiprazole study Vieta et al., 2021 ). Also, in developing countries, clinical rials may be the way for patients to receive treatments hich wouldn\u2019t be available for them otherwise, which ould account for recruitment of more severe patients, and his also may impact the generalizability of the results. In\nddition, the relatively short duration of RCTs makes it difcult to formulate a solid decision for clinical practice on a ew drug based on RCTs only, and although they are a first tep necessary for drug approval. Furthermore, most studies re funded by pharmaceutical companies and drug research y the industry can be different from drug research by the cademic centers ( Lundh et al.,2017 ). Yet, with all these imitations, RCTs represent the only option for regulatory nd research purposes of any new drug. The present study demonstrates the extent of the conensus among a large number of international experts. It rovides timely objective data on a topic that is often disuted on the basis of emotions and private beliefs and not ecessarily on evidence. Its limitations include that consenus is not an absolute measure and can vary with scientific dvances and new data. Delphi studies are meant to be subective, so that they can reflect the status of current clinial opinion. Between the two rounds of rating following the elphi protocol, 8/41 participants did not respond to the econd survey ( Fig. 1 ), which could have produced selection ias and influenced the results for the re-rated items. The hoice of experts and issues such as the wording of stateents might have influenced the results. Most of the experts ncluded are clinical researchers, and most are psychiatrists ith clinical experience, which may be reflected in the recmmendations. In summary, the endorsed recommendations established y our Delphi study can inform trial-design choice in psyhopharmacological trials and beyond. The most salient of hese recommendations includes not excluding a priori the se of placebo-controlled trials. The expert panel agreed hat this experimental design is the most reliable and still acilitates the introduction of new pharmaceuticals to the arket for improving patient wellbeing. Regarding activeontrolled trials, there was consensus that they play an inegral role in approving drugs with equal efficacy but differnt tolerability. Non-inferiority trials were the least recomended trial design. Experts also agreed that trial-design hoice must balance the risk of approving ineffective mediations with the risk of rejecting valuable new treatments. he present recommendations represent consensus of 41 exerts regarding the use of different trial designs for drug pproval trials in psychiatry, and strongly support the use of andomized clinical trials in general, and the use of placeboontrolled trials in particular.\nole of funding source\no funding was provided for this study.\nontributors\nS and CP contributed to the literature searches and prepaation of the manuscript.
