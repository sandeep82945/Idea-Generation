INTRODUCTION The authors in [1] considered the monitoring of the scale factor \u03c3 (\u03c3 > 0) of a quality characteristic T with a Rayleigh distribution, i.e., with a cumulative distribution function equal to\nFT (t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212[t/( \u221a 2\u03c3)] 2 , t > 0.\nIt was assumed that the output process observations are independent between and within samples of size n. Moreover, they suggested the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the scale factor \u03c3, VSQR = \u221a\u2211n i=1 T 2 i /(2n), as the control statistic of a Phase II chart they proposed to detect sustained shifts in \u03c3 from a known target value \u03c30 to \u03b8 \u03c30, where \u03b8 is a known positive constant. The observed Rayleigh random variables Ti are independent and identically distributed.\nThe control limits of this chart were given by LCLSQR = \u03c30 \u00b7 [ A(n)\u2212 l \u221a 1\u2212A2(n) ] (1)\nUCLSQR = \u03c30 \u00b7 [ A(n) + l \u221a 1\u2212A2(n) ] , (2)\nwhere: A(n) = E\u03c30(VSQR/\u03c30) = \u0393(n + 1/2)/( \u221a n\u0393(n)); l is chosen in such a way that the probability of a false alarm is equal to a pre-specified value \u03b1 and can be found in [1, Table 1] for different values of the sample size (n \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , 10}) and false alarm rate (\u03b1 \u2208 {0.002, 0.01, 0.025}).\nSince Z = 2nV 2SQR/(\u03b8\u03c30) 2 \u223c \u03c72(2n) is a pivotal quantity for \u03c3, we can obtain the following probability that the chart triggers a signal, given that \u03c3 = \u03b8 \u03c30:\n\u03beSQR(\u03b8) = 1\u2212 F\u03c72 (2n)\n( 2nUCL2SQR\n\u03b82\u03c320\n)\n+ F\u03c72 (2n)\n( 2nLCL2SQR\n\u03b82\u03c320\n) ,\nfor \u03b8 > 0. The corresponding average run length (ARL), that is, the expected number of samples we collect until a signal is triggered by what we shall call the VSQR chart, is given by ARLSQR(\u03b8) = 1/\u03beSQR(\u03b8).\nQuality control practitioners favour charts with suitably large ARL values when the process is in-control, thus leading to infrequent false alarms, and small ARL values when the process is out-of-control, yielding valid signals quickly."

The curves were truncated at ARL = 30 and values of \u03b8 in the interval (0, 1] were omitted.\nFor comparison, we plotted the ARL profiles for \u03b8 \u2208 [0.5, 6] in Figure 3. All the plots in Figure 3 show that the out-of-control ARL is larger than the in-control ARL values for some small increases in \u03c3. For example, when n = 3, the ARL associated with a 5.6% increase in \u03c3 is equal to ARLSQR(1.056) \u2243 44.23 and 10.58% larger than the in-control ARL. This behaviour of the ARL function of the VSQR chart will be less severe if we consider larger sample sizes. However, in practice, sample sizes are often\nbetween 1 and 5. Sample sizes could be much higher, but we recommend careful consideration if data are aggregated over time, as discussed by [2]."

AN ALTERNATIVE: THE ARL-UNBIASED CHART FOR \u03c3\nIdeally, the ARL function should achieve a maximum when the process is in-control, leading to what [4] termed an ARL-unbiased chart. An ARL-biased chart will have out-ofcontrol ARL values larger than the in-control ARL for some range of small shifts in the parameter being monitored.\nTo achieve an ARL-unbiased chart for \u03c3 with in-control ARL equal to ARL0 = 1/\u03b1, where ARL0 is a pre-specified suitably large value of the in-control ARL, we can capitalize on [5] or on two associated papers, [6] and [7]. These references propose ARL-unbiased charts (with fixed and variable sampling intervals) for the scale parameter of a process with Weibull output. The Rayleigh distribution is a particular case of the Weibull distribution with shape and scale parameters equal to 2 and \u221a 2\u03c3, respectively. Consequently, we can use the same control statistic VSQR and adopt the control limits\nLCL\u22c6 = \u03c30 \u00b7 \u221a a\u22c6/n (3)\nUCL\u22c6 = \u03c30 \u00b7 \u221a b\u22c6/n, (4)\nwhere the quantiles of the \u03c72(2n) distribution, a \u22c6 \u2261 a\u22c6(\u03b1, n) and b\u22c6 \u2261 b\u22c6(\u03b1, n)), satisfy, according to [5], [6], and [7], the following system of equations:\nF\u03c72 (2n) (b\u22c6)\u2212 F\u03c72 (2n) (a\u22c6) = 1\u2212 \u03b1; (5)\nf\u03c72 (2(n+1)) (b\u22c6)\u2212 f\u03c72 (2(n+1)) (a\u22c6) = 0. (6)\nThe probability that this chart triggers a signal, given that \u03c3 = \u03b8 \u03c30, is given by\n\u03be\u22c6(\u03b8) = 1\u2212 [ F\u03c722n(b \u22c6/\u03b82)\u2212 F\u03c722n(a \u22c6/\u03b82) ] ,\nfor \u03b8 > 0; the associated ARL function is equal to ARL\u22c6(\u03b8) = 1/\u03be\u22c6(\u03b8).\nThe use of (5) and (6) guarantees that ARL\u22c6(1) = 1/\u03b1 and dARL\u22c6(\u03b8)/d\u03b8 |\u03b8=1 = 0, respectively. The resulting chart has the desired in-control ARL, ARL0 = 1/\u03b1, and the ARL curve attains a maximum in the in-control situation, as illustrated by the plots in Figures 5 and 6.\nWhen ARL0 = 1/\u03b1 = 40 and n \u2208 {2, 4, 8, 10}, we have a\u22c6 = 0.422171, 1.954684, 6.355643, 8.889265 and b\u22c6 = 14.593993, 20.917543, 32.432957, 37.881789, respectively. For the in-control ARL value ARL0 = 1/\u03b1 = 100, and the commonly used sample size n = 5, we have a\u22c6 = 2.34441 and b\u22c6 = 26.65311.\nBoth figures also illustrate the fact that the VSQR chart is, on average, quicker than its ARL-unbiased counterpart in detecting decreases in \u03c32, namely because these two charts have the same in-control ARL and the derivative of the ARL\u2032SQR(\u03b8) is positive at \u03b8 = 1, whereas the one of ARL\u22c6(\u03b8) is zero. Basically, for the same reason, the ARLunbiased chart performs better than the VSQR in the presence of any increases in the scale factor.\nIn addition, Figures 5 and 6 suggest that the VR chart takes longer, on average, than the ARL-unbiased chart to detect any decreases and most increases in \u03c3.\nWe provide the source code in R language [8] used to numerically obtain the quantiles a\u22c6 and b\u22c6 after the reference list. Alternatively, we could have adapted the code found in [9] and used the R function uniroot.

CONCLUSIONS Equations (1) and (2) are very similar in form to the control limits of the traditional S-chart for the standard deviation of a normally distributed quality characteristic,\n\u03c30 \u00b7 (c4 \u00b1 3 \u221a 1\u2212 c24);\ninstead of c4 = \u221a 2/(n\u2212 1) \u00b7 \u0393(n/2)/\u0393[(n \u2212 1)/2] we are dealing with the constant A(n). We should also mention that VSQR is a biased estimator of \u03c3 while VR is an unbiased estimator of \u03c32. In any case, the control statistics are skewed distributions. Moreover, pairs of control limits defining a symmetric interval around an expected value were considered. Consequently, the ARL profiles of the VSQR and VR charts are not unbiased.\nFurthermore, the (equal tails) probability limits in equation (21) for the VSQR chart proposed by [1] can be obtained from the ones in formula (11) for the VR chart introduced by [3] through square root transformations. Both charts are ARLbiased.\nParaphrasing [10], the ARL-unbiased chart we discussed \u201cbalances\u201d control limits so that increases in the scale factor of the Rayleigh distribution are detected about as well as decreases.\nCumulative sum (CUSUM) and exponentially weighted moving average EWMA charts, see [11] and [12], would be more efficient in detecting small process shifts.\nREFERENCES [1] Z.
