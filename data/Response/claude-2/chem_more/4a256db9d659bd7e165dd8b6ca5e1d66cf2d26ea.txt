 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Perform detailed computational studies on model perovskite systems to quantify the energetic contributions of hydrogen bonding, pnictogen bonding, and other intermolecular interactions to the overall crystal stability. This could provide greater insight into the role and importance of pnictogen bonding.

2. Synthesize and characterize new organic-inorganic perovskite crystals with varied organic cations to systematically investigate the effects of pnictogen bonding on properties like bandgap, carrier mobility, and device efficiency. This could lead to rational design of improved materials. 

3. Use advanced charge density analysis techniques like ELF, RDG and QTAIM on a wider range of perovskite crystal structures to gain a more complete understanding of the interplay between different intermolecular interactions.

4. Investigate how strain, temperature, and other external factors influence pnictogen bonding strength and geometry in perovskite crystals, and relate this to changes in functional properties.

5. Explore the possibility of exploiting other pnictogen bonding interactions, such as P···X, As···X etc., in the design of new hybrid perovskite materials by substituting different pnictogen-containing organic cations.
