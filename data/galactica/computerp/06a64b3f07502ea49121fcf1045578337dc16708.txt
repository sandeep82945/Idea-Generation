The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic imaging has gained significant interest in recent years, particularly in lung cancer detection. This systematic review aims to assess the accuracy of machine learning (ML) AI algorithms in lung cancer detection, identify the ML architectures currently in use, and evaluate the clinical relevance of these diagnostic imaging methods. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was conducted in February 2023, encompassing the literature published up until December 2022. The review included nine studies, comprising five caseâ€“control studies, three retrospective cohort studies, and one prospective cohort study. Various ML architectures were analyzed, including artificial neural network (ANN), entropy degradation method (EDM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), support vector machine (SVM), partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and random forest neural network (RFNN). The ML architectures demonstrated promising results in detecting and classifying lung cancer across different lesion types. The sensitivity of the ML algorithms ranged from 0.81 to 0.99, while the specificity varied from 0.46 to 1.00. The accuracy of the ML algorithms ranged from 77.8% to 100%. The AI architectures were successful in differentiating between malignant and benign lesions and detecting small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This systematic review highlights the potential of ML AI architectures in the detection and classification of lung cancer, with varying levels of diagnostic accuracy. 1. conclusions This systematic review has provided a thorough evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning AI architectures in lung cancer detection and classification with varying degrees of success, demonstrating their potential and areas for improvement. The study designs and quality varied, while the algorithms employed included ANN, EDM, PNN, SVM, POMDP, and RFNN. The AI architectures were effective in differentiating malignant from benign lesions and identifying small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Although the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the AI architectures varied, promising results were demonstrated in many cases, indicating the potential of machine learning algorithms to improve lung cancer detection and classification. However, further research and optimization are needed to enhance the performance and reliability of these AI techniques in real-world settings.
