    "abstractText": "Ambitious climate packages promote the integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) and electrification of the economy. For the power sector, such a transformation means the emergence of so-called prosumers, i.e., agents that both consume and produce electricity. Due to their inflexible VRE output and flexible demand, prosumers will potentially add endogenous net sales with seasonal patterns to the power system. With its vast hydro reservoirs and ample transmission capacity, the Nordic region is seemingly well positioned to cope with such intermittent VRE output. However, the increased requirement for flexibility may be leveraged by incumbent producers to manipulate prices. Via a Nash-Cournot model with a representation of the Nordic region\u2019s spatio-temporal features and reservoir volumes, we examine how hydro producers\u2019 ability to manipulate electricity prices through temporal arbitrage is affected by (i) VRE-enabled prosumers and (ii) the latter plus a high CO 2 price. We find that hydro reservoirs could exploit prosumers\u2019 patterns of net sales to conduct temporal arbitrage more effectively, viz., by targeting periods in which prosumers are net buyers (net sellers) to withhold (to \u201cdump\u201d) water. Meanwhile, a higher CO 2 price would further enhance hydro reservoirs\u2019 market power because flexible price-taking thermal plants would be unable to ramp up production in order to counter such producers\u2019 strategy to target VRE\u2019s intermittency. Hence, in spite of a flexible demand side to complement additional intermittent VRE output, strategic hydro producers may still exacerbate price manipulation in a future power sector via more tailored exercise of market power.",

            "text": "Climate packages call for both steep reductions in power-sector CO2 emissions and electrification of the wider economy. For example, the Nordic countries have committed to carbon neutrality1 with stringent measures in line with the European Union (EU) target to cut CO2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.2 Underpinning this transformation will be substantial investment in variable renewable energy (VRE), such as wind and solar power.\nGiven its intermittent output, VRE requires flexible resources, e.g., storage and demand response, to integrate it into the power system. From this perspective, the Nordic region appears well positioned to absorb substantial VRE capacity due to its hydro reservoirs and transmission links (Amundsen and Bergman 2006). Yet, the additional need for flexibility and the advent of VRE-enabled prosumers, i.e., entities that both produce and consume electricity (Ramyar et\u00a0al. 2020; Wu and Conejo 2022), could impact hydro producers\u2019 potential leverage to exert market power. Here, we examine how Nordic hydro producers\u2019 ability to manipulate electricity prices via temporal arbitrage (Bushnell 2003; Tanger\u00e5s and Mauritzen 2018) would be affected by (i) VRE-enabled prosumers and (ii) the latter plus a high CO2 price. This analysis has policy implications for not only other hydro-dependent jurisdictions, e.g., Qu\u00e9bec (Debia et\u00a0 al. 2021), but also generic storage operations, e.g., in Germany (Schill and Kemfert 2011), the U.K. (Williams and Green 2022), and Western Europe (Ekholm and Virasjoki 2020), which are likely to figure prominently in VRE-dependent power systems."

            "text": "In deregulated electricity industries, the potential for market power by strategic producers is well known (Wilson 2002). Power companies with substantial market shares can manipulate electricity prices to their advantage through their investment and operational decisions. While market monitoring and regulators endeavour to mitigate the potential for price manipulation, e.g., via generation withholding (Tanaka 2009), there are still subtle channels that firms exploit to exert market power, especially via storage (Sioshansi 2010, 2014).\nOne such conduit is hydro reservoirs. As shown analytically (Crampes and Moreaux 2001), a hydro producer with market power could manipulate prices by moving water from peak periods to off-peak ones. In doing so, its additional benefit from higher prices during peak periods would outweigh any forgone revenue due to lower off-peak prices. More important, total hydro production over the entire time\n1 https:// www. norden. org/ en/ decla ration/ decla ration- nordic- carbon- neutr ality. 2 https:// eur- lex. europa. eu/ legal- conte nt/ EN/ TXT/? uri= CELEX: 52020 PC0563.\n1 3\nFlexible supply meets flexible demand: prosumer impact on\u2026 Page 3 of 35 23\nhorizon would be unchanged, which could make it challenging for market inspectors to detect such manipulation. This phenomenon was demonstrated in a case study of the California hydro-thermal power system (Bushnell 2003). Expanding the framework to consider transmission constraints and carbon policy, an analysis of the New York-Qu\u00e9bec interconnection revealed potential for such temporal arbitrage by a large hydro producer (Debia et\u00a0 al. 2021). Furthermore, an attempt to regulate not only the net-hydro production but also the net imports to prevent a hydro producer from \u201cdumping\u201d its output in another zone would actually facilitate spatial arbitrage by firms with pumped-hydro storage facilities.\nIn fact, even the Nordic region is not immune from such market power since hydro producers may take advantage of the increased requirement for flexibility stemming from additional VRE output. Empirical studies using data from 2011\u20132013 have revealed the potential for strategic behaviour by hydro producers (Tanger\u00e5s and Mauritzen 2018), thermal producers via unit failures (Fogelberg and Lazarczyk 2019), and generic Cournot behaviour (Lundin and Tanger\u00e5s 2020). Taking a computational Nash-Cournot approach, Hassanzadeh\u00a0 Moghimi et\u00a0 al. (2023) use 2018 Nord Pool data to demonstrate the potential for Bushnell (2003)-like behaviour by large hydro producers, viz., to increase (decrease) prices by allocating less (more) water in peak (off-peak) periods. They further investigate how structural changes to the supply side and a high CO2 price as part of a plausible 2030 climate package could affect such incentives for temporal arbitrage. In effect, they exogenously (i) double the installed 2018 VRE capacities in the existing firms\u2019 portfolios and (ii) increase the CO2 price to \u20ac100/t from its 2018 level of \u20ac15/t. Consequently, a large strategic hydro producer could increase its operating profit by 11.9% from behaving \u00e0 la Cournot as opposed to merely 1.99% via a similar strategy in 2018. This result is due to the fact that the climate package increases intermittent output, lowers prices, and renders fossil-fuelled plants unviable. Hence, strategic hydro reservoirs face lower opportunity costs and fewer countervailing manoeuvres from other flexible plants when conducting temporal arbitrage.\nAt the same time, climate packages envisage that flexibility from the demand side may be bolstered due to aggregators that can marshal the consumption patterns of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) (Momber et\u00a0 al. 2015) and building occupants (Ottesen et\u00a0 al. 2016). While such studies assume stochastic but exogenous prices, recent work in this strand of the literature has explored the impact of strategic behaviour by aggregators. For example, Momber et\u00a0al. (2016) use a bi-level model in which a PEV aggregator at the upper level anticipates lower-level market clearing when setting retail prices. Likewise, Ruhi et\u00a0al. (2018) examine a strategic aggregator\u2019s incentive as a leader to manipulate electricity prices by \u201cspilling\u201d output from a portfolio of distributed energy resources (DER). In a similar vein, Siddiqui and Siddiqui (2022) analyse strategic DER investment by a prosumer that acts as a Stackelberg leader to boost electricity prices via its installed capacity.\nIn order to investigate a prosumer\u2019s behaviour in a standard transmission-constrained oligopoly (Hobbs 2001), Ramyar et\u00a0 al. (2020) introduce a prosumer with both intermittent DER and a backup generator. Besides these generation sources, the prosumer has a gross-benefit function that values its own consumption. Since the other entities in the model, viz., conventional consumers and producers, are all price\nF.\u00a0Hassanzadeh Moghimi et al.\n1 3\n23 Page 4 of 35\ntakers, there is no advantage to the prosumer from exerting market power. Intuitively, the response by price-taking consumers and producers subverts any strategic behaviour by the prosumer as illustrated in a 24-node test network. An extension to this framework treats the prosumer as a Stackelberg leader instead of a Cournot player (Ramyar and Chen 2020). Once the prosumer is able to anticipate the decisions of the followers, it benefits from behaving as a Stackelberg leader rather than as a price taker or a Cournot agent. Thus, the extant literature on prosumers either (i) ignores market power altogether by focusing on decision making under uncertain exogenous prices or (ii) treats them as price makers. Between these polar opposites, a a more nuanced possibility is overlooked in the literature, viz., the ability of incumbent producers to exploit intermittent net sales by prosumers."

            "text": "While strategic behaviour by incumbent producers in the power market has been extensively studied, only recently has the effect of prosumers on the wholesale market drawn some attention. However, their role in and impact on a (hydro) storagedependent power system that is subject to a CO2 price is relatively less explored. Given this research gap, we contribute to advancing the understanding of how prosumer behaviour in a hydro-rich power system with vast reservoirs drives market outcomes. In effect, as a complement to Hassanzadeh\u00a0Moghimi et\u00a0al. (2023)\u2019s investigation of structural changes to the supply side, we probe how changes to the demand side through the electrification of the wider economy and the introduction of prosumers affect the incumbent producers\u2019 incentives to exert market power by tackling the following research questions (RQs):\nResearch Question RQ 1 What will be the impact of the advent of prosumers with high VRE capacity and flexible consumption on the potential for the exercise of market power by both hydro and thermal producers?\nResearch Question RQ 2 How will future carbon policy comprising a high CO2 price affect the potential for the exercise of market power by both hydro and thermal producers in the presence of prosumers?\nIn addressing\u00a0 RQ 1, we find that generating firms\u2019 leverage from withholding nuclear capacity in order to push up power prices is mitigated in the presence of VRE-enabled aggregators who pool prosumers\u2019 offers and predominantly switch to being net sellers. By contrast, the ability of hydro reservoirs to exercise market power by reallocating water from peak to off-peak periods is enhanced in the presence of prosumers by exploiting intermittencies in their net sales. As for\u00a0RQ 2, a high CO2 price augments hydro reservoirs\u2019 leverage as flexible price-taking plants, i.e., gas-fired ones, are less able to respond to such temporal arbitrage. Similarly, strategic nuclear plants benefit by withholding output so that fossil-fuelled plants set the market-clearing price. Hence, even in a well-functioning power sector such as the Nordic one, flexible demand and carbon policy may be exploited by incumbent\n1 3\nFlexible supply meets flexible demand: prosumer impact on\u2026 Page 5 of 35 23\nflexible producers, which has consequences for (hydro) storage operations in other power systems.\nOn the methodological side, our approach of representing chronological loads and VRE output based on a clustering analysis also effectively downscales the problem instances to facilitate computationally efficient solutions while maintaining the chronology of load, hydro inflows, and VRE output. Moreover, separating prosumers\u2019 gross benefit from conventional consumers\u2019 demand in the wholesale market enables the interaction between prosumers and the main grid to be modelled through the shift of residual supply curves.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section\u00a02 formulates the mathematical models, provides Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for each agent\u2019s problem, and reformulates the mixed-complementarity problem (MCP) as a single-agent optimisation problem. A numerical case study is presented in Sect.\u00a03 with concluding remarks provided in Sect.\u00a04. Appendix A contains supplementary data."

            "text": "We use a bottom-up equilibrium model comprising a Nash-Cournot game over a network (Hobbs 2001) among power-generating firms, an independent system operator (ISO), and aggregators (Fig.\u00a01). Consumers are represented by linear inversedemand functions at each node and in each period. The linearity assumption is\nF.\u00a0Hassanzadeh Moghimi et al.\n1 3\n23 Page 8 of 35\nbased on Nord Pool\u2019s bidding rules, viz., continuous and piecewise-linear supply and demand curves.3 It is also a fairly common assumption in the existing literature (Hobbs 2001; Metzler et\u00a0 al. 2003). Furthermore, allowing for non-linear demand functions complicates the solution procedure because KKT conditions will also have non-linear terms, thereby giving rise to a non-linear MCP overall. As EggingBratseth et\u00a0 al. (2020) point out, even oligopolistic problems that result in linear MCPs are more computationally efficient to solve as non-linear optimisation problems. Indeed, an MCP that results from an equilibrium problem with affine inversedemand functions can be reformulated (under mild conditions, such as convex cost functions) as a single convex optimisation problem, which can be tackled directly via solvers such as CPLEX. While iso-elastic demand functions are also used in energy economics, they cannot be reformulated as non-linear optimisation problems and necessitate solving non-linear MCPs unless firms are symmetric, which is not the case in reality. Finally, Metzler et\u00a0al. (2003) mention non-linear MCPs arising from non-linear demand functions and observe that such an \u201canalysis is made more complicated without yielding significantly more insights.\u201d\nProfit-maximising firms\u2019 hydro, thermal, and VRE units are subject to operational, storage, and water-regulatory constraints. An exogenous CO2 price is imposed on generation emissions. Meanwhile, aggregators own VRE capacity with intermittent output and have gross-benefit functions that quantify the value of their own consumption. They decide endogenously to buy or sell electricity in order to maximise net revenue from market interactions plus gross benefit from consumption of electricity. In essence, aggregators marshal prosumers\u2019 VRE output and consumption preferences in order to determine their endogenous net sales to the grid at node n during period t, \u2211\ne\u2208E G e,agg j,n,t \u2212 q agg j,n,t , which may be negative. Thus, the aggre-\ngators\u2019 endogenous net sales reflect structural changes to the demand side of the power sector due to the electrification of other sectors, such as heating and transport. In other words, we treat prosumers as additional net loads from the perspective of the power sector and not as defections by existing conventional consumers. A surplus-maximising ISO decides upon consumption and power flows to maintain nodal energy balance during each period. The Nash assumption means that each agent takes the decisions of all other agents as given when making its own decision.\nOur Nash-Cournot approach is rich in spatio-temporal details, which enables it to capture the texture of the Nordic power sector. For example, not only capacities of plants and transmission lines but also volumes of and periodic inflows to hydro reservoirs are modelled. However, as is customary in Nash-Cournot policy analyses, we make an open-loop assumption, i.e., we treat all decisions over the representative weeks of a year as if they were made simultaneously. By contrast, a closed-loop model that allowed for periodic decisions adapted to (stochastic) hydro inflows would have been more realistic. Indeed, hydro scheduling in reality is more complex than we could possibly capture in a computational NashCournot model. For example, stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) can\n3 https:// www. nordp oolgr oup. com/ en/ tradi ng/ Day- ahead- tradi ng/ Order- types/ Hourly- bid/.\n1 3\ntackle realistic problem instances, e.g., of the Brazilian power system (de Matos et\u00a0 al. 2015). Yet, in such analyses, there is typically a single welfare maximiser without strategic behaviour. Departures from perfect competition are instead addressed by Scott and Read (1996)\u2019s Cournot version of so-called \u201cconstructive dual dynamic programming\u201d and Genc et\u00a0al. (2020)\u2019s infinite-horizon game, which reflects the market in Ontario with strategic hydro and thermal producers. In this context, Markov perfect equilibria are obtained via approximations of the expected value functions that appear in the hydro producer\u2019s Bellman equation. Based on analytical models (Crampes and Moreaux 2001; Debia et\u00a0 al. 2019), a closed-loop Cournot approach that considers uncertainty would smooth out temporal arbitrage. Still, (weakened) incentives for strategic behaviour as in an openloop model would remain. Given this background, our open-loop Cournot model is suitable for our objective to analyse strategic reservoir operations in the Nordic power sector by incorporating the system\u2019s spatio-temporal texture, viz., heterogeneous firms, seasonal variations, and transmission constraints, in a computationally tractable manner. We recognise that this choice involves a tradeoff because we neglect uncertainty, dynamic decisions, and risk aversion, where the extent of risk aversion is somewhat subjective. In effect, the added features of stochastic or closed-loop models would likely come at the cost of computational tractability of the problem instances, viz., optimisation problems constrained by other optimisation problems would have to be solved without the theoretical underpinning\nF.\u00a0Hassanzadeh Moghimi et al.\n1 3\n23 Page 10 of 35\nto guarantee existence and uniqueness of equilibria (Murphy and Smeers 2005; Singh and Wiszniewska-Matyszkiel 2019). Thus, we take the open-loop NashCournot route and lay out each agent\u2019s optimisation problem in Sect.\u00a02.3 followed by the KKT conditions that constitute the corresponding MCP in Sect.\u00a02.4 and an equivalent quadratic programming (QP) reformulation of the MCP in Sect.\u00a02.5."

The two main parts of its objective function (1) are revenue from selling energy and costs of operation. In the first part of the function is the revenue from net energy sales, \u2211\nu\u2208Ui,n gi,n,t,u +\n\u2211\ne\u2208E G e i,n,t + \u2211 w\u2208Wi,n Qi,n,wyi,n,t,w \u2212 \u2211 w\u2208Wi,n Fi,n,wr in i,n,t,w ,\nat the nodal electricity price, Dint n,t \u2212 D slp n,t qn,t , where qn,t is the nodal consumption. The second part is the operating cost of thermal units, Ci,n,t,u , and the price of CO2 emission permits, S, which is based on the EU ETS permit price and is taken as exogenous because firms in the Nordic region are assumed to be too small to influence it. VRE output is considered to be cost free and is represented by its exogenous output, Ge\ni,n,t . By\nhaving no operating cost, VRE is in the priority to be dispatched in the energy market. Based on the Nash assumption, each firm takes as given the decisions of all other firms, all aggregators, and the ISO. In addition to the generation units, firms can take advantage of hydro units for energy storage in reservoirs, which might be used to exert market power. In case of a Cournot oligopoly, total quantity demanded, qn,t , in the firm\u2019s objective function (1) cannot be assumed exogenous since it is affected by the firm\u2019s decisions. Therefore, the net production of the firms, which is related to the total demanded quantity of the system via the energy-balance constraint (11), should be considered in the KKT conditions. Consequently, KKT conditions (15), (18), and (19) for thermal and hydro operations are written based on the exercise of market power in both thermal generation and hydro storage and ignore the impact of the higher price on revenues from VRE output, which is treated as exogenous.4 It is also possible to account for market power only in thermal generation and not in hydro storage.5 Likewise, the\n4 Price-taking behaviour in both thermal generation and hydro storage is handled by treating the price in (1) as exogenous, which means that KKT conditions (15), (18), and (19) would omit\nD slp n,t\n\ufffd\n\u2211\nu\ufffd\u2208Ui,n gi,n,t,u\ufffd +\n\u2211\nw\ufffd\u2208Wi,n Qi,n,w\ufffdyi,n,t,w\ufffd \u2212\n\u2211\nw\ufffd\u2208Wi,n Fi,n,w\ufffd r in i,n,t,w\ufffd\n\ufffd\n.\n5 For example, to indicate market power in thermal generation but not in hydro storage, only the impact of thermal generation on the price is included in (1) by treating qn,t as a constant when multiplying it by \u2211\ne\ufffd\u2208Ei,n Ge\n\ufffd\ni,n,t + \u2211 w\ufffd\u2208Wi,n Qi,n,w\ufffdyi,n,t,w\ufffd \u2212 \u2211 w\ufffd\u2208Wi,n Fi,n,w\ufffd r in i,n,t,w\ufffd .

Moreover, genera-\ntion limits of hydro units are enforced in (7), i.e., their electricity generated cannot exceed the installed hydro capacity. Finally, (8) is used in Cournot settings to prohibit \u201cspilling\u201d from hydro reservoirs at nodes where the firm behaves strategically, i.e., the total annual net generation from strategic reservoirs must be at least as much as the annual perfectly competitive production, Zi,n."

However, since it treats the decisions of all other agents as given in accordance with the Nash assumption, it is sufficient to state that the ISO maximises gross consumer surplus instead of social welfare. In reality, since the ISO\u2019s decisions occur after those of the generators, a fully accurate modelling of the sequence of market clearing would render an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) instead of an MCP. The challenge of solving an EPEC by iteratively solving mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) as Yao et\u00a0al. (2008) do is likely to be exacerbated by features such as hydro reservoirs and the need to represent sufficient time periods to capture the availability of VRE output over the year.\nF.\u00a0Hassanzadeh Moghimi et al.\n1 3\n23 Page 14 of 35"

Moreover, it should be emphasised that the introduction of prosumers already bolsters the price elasticity of either the residual or the total demand facing producers. For example, if prosumers are net buyers (net sellers), then the total (residual) inverse-demand function presented to producers will be flatter, i.e., more price responsive. In effect, we investigate whether hydro producers would be able to exert more leverage even in the presence of elasticity-enhancing prosumers.\nFour representative weeks, i.e., one for each season, are selected based on minimising the Euclidean distance of the seasonal-weekly values of averages and standard errors from each season\u2019s centroid for the observed consumption, prices, and wind availability using a clustering procedure. Therefore, each problem instance is based on four representative weeks of 168\u00a0h each that capture operations over an entire year using 672\u00a0h instead of 8,760\u00a0h.13 The full dataset and relevant sources are provided in Hassanzadeh\u00a0Moghimi et\u00a0 al.

In particular, 2030AV allows for a single price-taking aggregator at each node (except for NO1 and NO5 due to negligible VRE capacity) with its own (i) demand function and (ii) VRE capacity.16 This scenario enables us to address\u00a0RQ 1.

While this scenario does not directly address either\u00a0RQ 1 or\u00a0RQ 2, it, nevertheless, establishes a benchmark for how market power may be exerted in the \u201cexisting\u201d Nordic power system without either prosumers or a high CO2 price. In terms of calibration, we provide the following metrics:\n\u2013 The base results under the PC case for 2018 lead to total generation of 400 TWh, which compares favourably to actual generation of 398 TWh in 2018.19 \u2013 The modelled PC total net-hydro generation is 212 TWh, which is also in line with the actual generation of 213 TWh in 2018. \u2013 The modelled PC average electricity price is \u20ac39.32/MWh, cf. the average price of \u20ac42.04/MWh in the representative weeks of 2018.20 \u2013 The modelled PC total CO2 emissions are 31.5 Mt, which track well with the actual emissions of 35.1 Mt for both power and heat generation in 2017.21 \u2013 The modelled reservoir levels track the data well for SE1 (see Figure\u00a09 in Hassanzadeh\u00a0Moghimi et\u00a0al. (2023)), viz., the actual relative reservoir levels usually lie in between our modelled PC and COR reservoir levels.\nHence, based on these metrics, we believe that our model provides a credible basis for examining at least the potential of the plausible open-loop exercise of market power in a future Nordic system.\n18 All COR instances require relaxing the Zi,n parameter in the water-regulation constraint (8) by 0.001% to obtain optimal solutions to the QP.

Under COG, the average Nordic price increases to \u20ac70.45/MWh from \u20ac39.32/MWh under PC. CO2 emissions also increase noticeably as the withholding of nuclear capacity by Vattenfall at SE3 forces price-taking fossil-fuelled generators\u2019 capacity limits to become binding. Consequently, Vattenfall\u2019s firm surplus increases by 30.85%, i.e., from \u20ac2.01 billion to \u20ac2.63 billion (Table\u00a01), due to its withholding of nuclear output under COG vis-\u00e0-vis PC.\nThe strategic use of reservoirs is illustrated by comparing PC and COR results. Figure\u00a0 5 shows that Vattenfall at SE1 is able to move water from the peak winter and fall seasons to primarily the off-peak spring season in order to increase peak prices even though off-peak prices decrease (Crampes and Moreaux 2001; Bushnell 2003; Debia et\u00a0al. 2021; Hassanzadeh\u00a0Moghimi et\u00a0al. 2023). Overall, average prices increase slightly to \u20ac39.97/MWh for the Nordic region as a whole, which is closer to the Nordic average of \u20ac42.04/MWh in the representative weeks of 2018. Yet, at SE1, the impact is more pronounced as the average price becomes \u20ac41.03/MWh as opposed to \u20ac38.92/MWh under PC. This is in spite of the regulation on strategic annual net-hydro generation to prevent \u201cspilling\u201d water relative to PC. Still, overall net-hydro operations plus net imports are impacted to the extent that SE1 becomes a net exporter in the spring under COR instead of a net importer under PC. This temporal shift enables Vattenfall to export the \u201cexcess\u201d hydro production (Figs.\u00a06, 7 and 8). Via this temporal arbitrage, Vattenfall increases prices in the winter and fall while decreasing them in the spring (Fig.\u00a09). Hence, Vattenfall\u2019s overall firm surplus increases from \u20ac2.01 billion to \u20ac2.05 billion (Table\u00a01), i.e., by 1.99%."

The summary of the numerical results is in Table\u00a02. Since the annual consumption of aggregators is scaled such that it can \u201cabsorb\u201d their annual VRE output, welfare components and emissions under PC are similar to those in the base 2018 scenario under PC (Table\u00a01). Likewise, the average Nordic price under PC is still \u20ac39.32/MWh. Indeed, the only distinct change is the addition of the prosumer-surplus metric. However, as we will discuss in more detail, what is important in the 2030AV scenario is that the uneven production and consumption patterns of the aggregator can be exploited by market power under COR at SE1 to a greater extent. This is because VRE availability is highest during spring and fall (Fig.\u00a0 3) and net sales (net purchases) by the\n22 We indicate social welfare as well as its components, viz., consumer surplus, firm surplus, prosumer surplus, merchandising surplus, and government revenue.

By withholding from its large nuclear capacity at SE3, Vattenfall increases its firm surplus by 15.76% from PC as prices increase to an overall Nordic average of \u20ac65.02/MWh, which is less than the corresponding increase in the base 2018 scenario. Consequently, the benefit to Vattenfall under COG is relatively low in this 2030AV scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the base 2018 scenario, when its firm surplus was boosted by 30.85% in moving from PC to COG. Intuitively, the impact of market power under COG is limited because the aggregators typically switch to becoming net suppliers in all seasons (Fig.\u00a0 10). Thus, an attempt by Vattenfall to withhold its nuclear capacity to induce more price-taking fossil-fuelled generation at full capacity is mitigated, as evidenced by the smaller increase in both average prices and CO2 emissions from PC to COG in this 2030AV scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the base 2018 scenario.\nBy contrast, strategic behaviour with hydro reservoirs (COR) is facilitated in 2030AV relative to the base 2018 scenario (Fig.\u00a0 12). While social welfare, consumer surplus, and prosumer surplus are marginally reduced from PC, firm surplus increases by 1.74% as a result of the hydro units\u2019 strategic behaviour (Table\u00a02). As in the base 2018 scenario, prices are not drastically affected, i.e., the Nordic average price is \u20ac40.08/MWh (and the SE1 average price is \u20ac40.95/MWh as opposed to \u20ac39.05/MWh under PC), but Vattenfall enjoys a 2.46% increase in its firm surplus merely by shifting production from its reservoirs at SE1 (Fig.\u00a0 13). This is done by exploiting the fact that the aggregator at SE1 is a net buyer in the summer but a net seller in the spring and the fall under PC (Fig.\u00a0 10). Thus, in going from PC to COR, vis-\u00e0-vis the base 2018 scenario, Vattenfall withholds more (less) water in the summer (fall), thereby adapting its strategy to the VRE availability pattern, which shows relatively low (high) availability in the summer (fall). Likewise, when Vattenfall \u201cdumps\u201d the water in the spring, the opportunity cost related to the price-depressing effect of its increased production is cushioned because the aggregators reduce their net sales. Hence, in tackling\u00a0 RQ 1, we find that the advent of aggregators would bolster (mitigate) the ability of strategic hydro (thermal) producers to exert market power in a future 2030 Nordic power system."

            "text": "Here, we investigate the additional impact of a future carbon policy (involving a high CO2 price of \u20ac100/t) on the exertion of market power in the presence of aggregators, i.e.,\u00a0RQ 2. As anticipated, the high CO2 price reduces emissions by nearly 90% from the PC case in the 2030AV scenario. There is a slight decrease in social welfare and a wealth transfer from consumers to firms and prosumers (Table\u00a0 3), primarily due to the increase in the average Nordic electricity price from \u20ac39.32/ MWh to \u20ac55.51/MWh (Fig.\u00a0 14). In a similar vein, the SE1 average price increases\n1 3\nto \u20ac53.99/MWh under PC in 2030AVC from \u20ac39.05/MWh under PC in 2030AV. As a result, the aggregator at SE1 becomes more of a net seller (Fig.\u00a0 15), which is also generally true for all aggregators in the Nordic region.\nRegarding strategic behaviour under COG, while the overall increase in firm surplus of 57.70% vis-\u00e0-vis PC is somewhat less than the corresponding value of 62.43% in the 2030AV scenario, the increase in Vattenfall\u2019s firm surplus from withholding nuclear output is bolstered to 19.42% (Table\u00a03) as opposed to 15.76% in the 2030AV scenario. Intuitively, extremely high electricity prices under COG (averaging \u20ac93.46/MWh for the entire Nordic region) caused by carbon policy entice net sales by aggregators even more (Fig.\u00a0 15). Furthermore, the inability of price-taking flexible assets, viz., gas-fired plants, to respond to higher prices vis-\u00e0-vis the 2030AV scenario gives Vattenfall more leverage in exerting market power via its nuclear plants, e.g., to withhold output in order to force otherwise idle fossil-fuelled plants to set the\nMetric Case PC COG COR\nSocial welfare 142.29 140.69 142.21 Consumer surplus 129.46 117.47 128.94 Firm surplus 12.01 21.70 12.20 Prosumer surplus \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Merchandising surplus 0.35 0.70 0.59 Government revenue 0.47 0.82 0.48 CO\n2 emissions (Mt) 31.46 54.70 32.26\nVattenfall\u2019s firm surplus 2.01 2.63 2.05\n1 3\nmarket-clearing price. This lack of response refers to the economic unviability of fossil-fuelled power plants due to the high CO2 price. Indeed, when the CO2 price is high, fossil-fuelled plants are less able to respond because their operating costs are exorbitant. Thus, it becomes easier for strategic plants to exert market power.\nUnder COR, the exertion of market power through hydro reservoirs is also more effective with a high CO2 price. In particular, overall firm surplus increases by 2.53% from PC compared to 1.74% in the 2030AV scenario, while\n1 3\nVattenfall\u2019s firm surplus increases by 2.91% (Table\u00a03), cf. 2.46% in the 2030AV scenario. The average Nordic electricity price is \u20ac56.86/MWh, whereas that for SE1 is \u20ac58.31/MWh. In effect, although the aggregator is a consistent net seller under COR in the 2030AVC scenario, Vattenfall\u2019s net-hydro generation at SE1 is also more evenly distributed among the seasons under PC in the 2030AVC scenario (Fig.\u00a0 16) than in the 2030AV scenario. This is due to limited generation from price-taking flexible units, such as gas-fired plants, elsewhere in the Nordic region, and it is precisely their unprofitability that gives Vattenfall more\n1 3\nscope to exploit the intermittency of VRE generation in spite of the aggregator\u2019s countervailing flexibility in net sales. Hence, Vattenfall\u2019s leverage under COR as a provider of relatively scarce flexible and carbon-free generation is enhanced in the 2030AVC scenario relative to that in the 2030AV scenario, which enables us to address\u00a0RQ 2 by concluding that carbon policy in the presence of aggregators would intensify the market power of both thermal and hydro producers."

Thus, an emerging concern is the strategic behaviour of incumbent producers with (hydro) storage in the presence of prosumers. Since generic storage is also a lynchpin for integrating VRE output even in regions that do not have hydro resources, our assessment of prosumers\u2019 impact on hydro producers\u2019 market power (RQ\u00a0 1) and additionally carbon policy\u2019s interaction with strategic operations (RQ\u00a02) addresses a timely issue that has yet not been tackled in the literature.\n1 3\nWe apply a spatially constrained Nash-Cournot framework to investigate how price-taking prosumers, represented through aggregators, could facilitate either capacity withholding by thermal plants or temporal arbitrage by strategic hydro reservoirs. Our analysis is based on Nordic data and captures salient spatio-temporal features of the power system. In addressing\u00a0RQ 1 for thermal plants, we find that aggregators with VRE output may switch from being net buyers to net sellers in the face of capacity withholding by thermal plants and effectively attenuate price increases along with market power. Yet, firms with strategic thermal plants may have the incentive to manipulate prices more effectively and benefit more from withholding nuclear capacity under a high CO2 price when prosumers exist, which is the focus of\u00a0RQ 2. This is mainly because price-taking gas-fired plants find it economically less viable to ramp up output given the high incurred emission costs. By contrast, firms with strategic hydro reservoirs may benefit from temporal arbitrage\n1 3\nin the presence of prosumers (RQ\u00a01) by fine tuning their seasonal water allocation to target the additional intermittency from VRE output. Moreover, a high CO2 price in addition to prosumers (RQ\u00a0 2) could further bolster such hydro reservoirs\u2019 leverage by limiting the response from price-taking flexible (gas-fired) plants. Thus, the answer to\u00a0RQ 1 varies depending on the type of power plant, whereas it points towards enhancing the market power of both types of plants in the context of\u00a0RQ 2.\nBy anticipating future climate packages\u2019 impact on demand-side participation due to greater sector coupling and carbon pricing, our analysis contributes\n1 3\nto informing our understanding of prosumers\u2019 plausible interaction with a hydrodominant power system. While our results are based on a credibly calibrated bottom-up equilibrium model and could have implications for power systems where storage is likely to figure prominently, it still necessitated simplifying assumptions (as discussed in Sect.\u00a02.2) to obtain computationally tractable problem instances. Therefore, our analysis does not suggest that all strategic hydro producers will definitively have scope to exert more leverage in a future power system. For example, we did not consider that VRE-enabled aggregators could prompt standalone merchant providers to furnish storage services via grid-scale batteries, thereby curbing strategic producers\u2019 market power. Likewise, our openloop approach neglects the dynamic nature of a closed-loop game. By contrast, analytical models of strategic storage operations (Crampes and Moreaux 2001; Debia et\u00a0 al. 2019) derive closed-loop equilibria to test the sensitivity of openloop results. Although they find that incentives for temporal arbitrage in a closedloop model still exist, by internalising the responses of competitors, a strategic storage operator in a closed-loop setting would be more prudent about shifting its production to the off-peak period. Nevertheless, our approach is consistent in that it compares the potential for open-loop strategic behaviour under 2018 and 2030 scenarios.\nFuture work in this area could build upon our analysis in several directions. First, investment in flexible assets by strategic entities in a future power system with VRE-enabled aggregators could be analysed via bi-level models (Virasjoki et\u00a0 al. 2020). Likewise, the incentives for strategic behaviour by prosumers themselves could be investigated (Ramyar and Chen 2020; Siddiqui and Siddiqui 2022). Second, from the policy perspective, bi-level models could be devised to propose countervailing transmission plans (Pozo et\u00a0al. 2013), while cooperative\n1 3\nFlexible supply meets flexible demand: prosumer impact on\u2026 Page 31 of 35 23\ngame theory (Kristiansen et\u00a0al. 2018) could design resource regulation to mitigate welfare distortions under future climate packages with sector coupling (Mitridati et\u00a0 al. 2021). Third, extending the analysis to a closed-loop model (Genc et\u00a0 al. 2020) could incorporate stochastic hydro inflows and VRE output to assess the extent to which temporal arbitrage would be attractive to strategic producers under uncertainty and dynamic decision making. Finally, the scope of the equilibrium framework could be expanded to model the electrified sectors, viz., heating (Virasjoki et\u00a0al. 2018) and transport (Sioshansi 2012), explicitly in order to enrich the ensuing policy conclusions in the presence of prosumers."
