    "abstractText": "Objective: This research examines the direct and indirect relationships between optimism, perceived social support (PSS), benefit finding (BF), and anxiety and depressive symptoms among Chinese women with breast cancer (BC). Methods: We recruited 512 patients, aged averagely 47.46(SD = 8.51) years from two hospitals located in Hunan province, China. The variables were assessed using the Optimism\u2013Pessimism Scale (OPS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Path analyses were conducted by Amos version 24.0 for Windows to test the hypothesized serial mediation model. Results: Path analyses suggest a significant negative association between optimism and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The relationship was mediated by BF (\u03b2 = -0.085, SE = 0.015, 95% CI [-0.126, -0.055]), and by BF together with PSS (\u03b2 = -0.027, SE = 0.007, 95% CI [-0.047, -0.017]). The difference comparison between the two indirect effects was significant (\u03b2 = 0.057, SE = 0.015, 95% CI [0.034,0.101]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PSS, and BF are important mediators through which optimism may buffer symptoms of anxiety and depression among Chinese BC patients. Clinicians and healthcare practitioners should be aware of the importance of patients\u2019 emotional health and endeavor to offer emotional support, facilitate their capacity to improve their quality of life.",

The variables were assessed using the Optimism\u2013Pessimism Scale (OPS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Path analyses were conducted by Amos version 24.0 for Windows to test the hypothesized serial mediation model.\nResults: Path analyses suggest a significant negative association between optimism and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The relationship was mediated by BF (\u03b2 = -0.085, SE = 0.015, 95% CI [-0.126, -0.055]), and by BF together with PSS (\u03b2 = -0.027, SE = 0.007, 95% CI [-0.047, -0.017]). The difference comparison between the two indirect effects was significant (\u03b2 = 0.057, SE = 0.015, 95% CI [0.034,0.101]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PSS, and BF are important mediators through which optimism may buffer symptoms of anxiety and depression among Chinese BC patients. Clinicians and healthcare practitioners should be aware of the importance of patients\u2019 emotional health and endeavor to offer emotional support, facilitate their capacity to improve their quality of life.\nKeywords: Optimism, Perceived social support, Benefit finding, Anxiety, Depression, Breast cancer, Serial mediation\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is considered the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide [1, 2]. According to the China National Cancer Center, China accounts for 12.2% and 9.6% of new breast cancer cases and deaths, respectively. The prevalence rate in China is exponentially contributing to the global prevalence [3]. With the development of medical technology, the survival rate of breast cancer worldwide has improved significantly [4]. However, the adverse consequences of cancer and its treatments continue to plague patients, which interferes with patients\u2019 state and quality of life [5].\nNotably, a growing body of literature recognizes the importance of improving the quality of life alongside the disease, particularly addressing emotional distress, such\n\u2020Qingqian Mo and Chen Tan are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: zhangjinqiang@csu.edu.cn\n1 Department of Clinical Psychology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, People\u2019s Republic of China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nas symptoms of depression and anxiety [6]. Recent evidence suggests that failure to identify and treat symptoms of anxiety and depression can increase the potential risk of poor quality of life, disease-related morbidity, and mortality [7]. From a resource-oriented belief, this may be because patients will face huge challenges in adapting resources. They were related to the social and interpersonal relations (i.e., family relations, social support, and work) and personal internal resources (i.e., dispositions, individual traits, cognitive mechanisms, and abilities) [8]. It is important to identify individual differences and psychological resources related to positive physical and mental health results, which can promote interventions which improve the health and daily function of cancer patients.\nOptimism is a key personality resource that has proven to be a positive factor for individuals coping with troubles in life [9]. Dispositional optimism defined by Scheier and Carver is a cognitive-affective personality construction. It reflects individuals\u2019 universal and stable expectations that something good will happen to them [10]. Besides, it functions as a personal psychological resource that can bring health benefits [11, 12]. Extensive research has shown that a high level of dispositional optimism is a protective factor for cancer survivors\u2019 quality of life, sexual impairment, well-being, fatigue, symptoms of anxiety and depression [13\u201316]. While low optimism has been confirmed to be a significant predictor of psychological distress [17]. Many studies suggest a significant negative association between optimism and negative emotions [18, 19].\nOptimistic patients show greater satisfaction with support after surgery [20]. Perceived social support defined by Procidano and Heller, is the belief that support is accessible if there is a need [21]. Recent work has established that social support is a vital mediator working between optimism and regulating relationships. This could be because an optimistic personality can attract more people and allow individuals to establish more relationships, thereby augmenting social support [22, 23]. Besides, it has been evidenced that perceived social support mediates (partially or entirely) the association between optimism and better psychological adjustment among BC patients [24]. Perceived social support might be a significant mediator between optimism and symptoms of anxiety and depression among BC patients.\nBenefit finding, another vital concept in adaptive resources, is a cognitive reappraisal coping strategy [25] or adaptation [26]. Benefit finding, defined by Affleck and Tennen, are positive life changes in stressful events like a cancer diagnosis [27]. It plays an important role in promoting BC patients to adapt to life when\naccompanied by diseases. Individuals can gain psychological benefits from their cancer experiences for better adaptive coping mechanisms. BC-related benefits such as sensing closer relationships with others and greater spirituality appear to become a common phenomenon [28]. One might report that confronting cancer prompted a realization of others\u2019 supportiveness [29]. In addition, personality predictors of benefit finding include optimism and hope. Individuals who hold generalized expectancies for positive outcomes may seek opportunities to transform threatening situations into favorable circumstances through benefit finding [29]. Furthermore, some studies have yielded significant concurrent relations between perceived positive outcomes and better mood or quality of life [30]. In a longitudinal study, benefit finding predicts lower levels of distress after stressful event [31]. Based on a metaanalysis, the results implied that posttraumatic benefit findings predict positive markers of mental health (i.e., positive impact, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and less depression) [32].\nDespite various studies have assessed the relationship among these variables, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. According to these theories and previous findings, we hypothesized that optimism contributes to buffering symptoms of anxiety and depression. As individuals with high optimism could perceive more social support and find more benefits, it was further hypothesized to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. In other words, perceived social support and benefit findings mediate the association between optimism and symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nTherefore, the current study aimed to examine the direct and indirect effects of optimism on symptoms of anxiety and depression through the roles of perceived social support and benefit findings. Considering the unique medical and personal conditions of the study participants, we added three variables that may influence anxiety, depressive symptoms to the model (a) age, (b) months since diagnosis, and (c) years of education.\nThe following hypotheses were formulated (Fig.\u00a01):\nH1: Optimism negatively influences symptoms of anxiety and depression among BC patients. H2: Optimism positively influences perceived social support (H2a) and benefit findings (H2b). H3: Perceived social support negatively influences symptoms of anxiety and depression. H4: Benefit finding negatively influences symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nH5: Perceived social support and benefit finding are serial mediators between optimism and symptoms of anxiety and depression among BC patients."

Participants were eligible if they had histologically confirmed primary invasive carcinoma of the breast (stages I, II, and III) with no history of or current evidence of metastatic disease, 18\u00a0years and older, exhibited sufficient Chinese speaking and writing proficiency, without major psychiatric disorder or/and family history of mental disorders, without major somatic disease except for BC, without substance abuse history.\nThe study received ethical approval through the Ethics Committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan, China. Firstly, we orally informed the\neligible women of the study\u2019s purpose; those who agreed to participate then provided written informed consent. On enrollment, participants admitted to the hospital were administered the Optimism\u2013Pessimism Scale (OPS) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale (MSPSS) by trained graduate students majoring in psychology. They also completed a form for demographic and clinical information. When they were discharged from the hospital, participants completed the assessment of the 17-item Benefit Finding Scale (BFS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\nFive hundred twenty-seven eligible Chinese women in total volunteered to participate in the study, and finally, 512 completed and returned all assessments, with a valid response rate of 97.2%."

We first performed the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test for normality of the main study variables and found that they were all non-normally distributed (p < 0.05). Therefore, nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis analysis of variance test was conducted to compare benefit findings, anxiety, and depression for each categorical demographic and clinical variable for the descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. We included demographic and/or clinical variables which show significant group differences in the main study variables in the path analyses. Relationships between the primary study variables were analyzed through the analysis of correlation.\nThe proposed hypothesized research model presented in Fig.\u00a01 was examined via path analysis using the structural equation modeling software Amos version 24.0 (IBM Corporation) [46]. Model fit was tested for optimism, perceived social support, benefit finding, negative emotions (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) separately. The PSS average score, OPS average score, BFS average score, age, and months since diagnoses represented their respective observed variable in the proposed model. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to assess model fit. Four estimates of model fit were used, based on suggested recommendations in the literature: (a) chi-square (\u03c72), (b) root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), (c) normed fit index (NFI), and (d) comparative fit index (CFI). RMSEA index values at or above 1.0 indicate a poorly fitting model, values between 0.05 and 0.90 indicate an average model fit, and values below 0.05 indicate a superior model fit. CFI and\nNFI index values greater than 0.90 indicate a good model fit.\nBootstrap can be used for testing non-normal data. We conducted a bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and a bias-corrected 95% confidence interval to examine indirect effects. An absence of zero in the 95% CI suggests a significant indirect effect."

The results showed that optimism impacted negative emotions directly and indirectly by way of perceived social support and benefit findings. As a mediation framework, these results have theoretical and practical significance. Clinicians in the field should actively pay attention to the symptoms of anxiety and depression of breast cancer patients, help patients learn to use available interpersonal resources and appropriate cognitive strategies, and encourage patients to develop more optimism towards a potential recovery, thus improving the patient\u2019s prognosis and quality of life.\nThere is a significant negative correlation between optimism and negative emotions, with the association being mediated independently and cumulatively through perceived social support and benefit findings. Although our research is the first to explore this relationship specifically among BC patients. The current findings were consistent with the established bodies of literature on these associations. First, as hypothesized, optimism negatively correlated with negative emotions. It is consistent with previous studies, which indicated that optimism has been shown to prevent emotional distress among women facing chronic stressors such as cancer diagnosis and treatment [47].\nSecond, optimism was positively correlated with perceived social support and benefit findings. In terms of social support, this may be because optimistic individuals could attract more people, let\u00a0them build more relationships, and increase social support in a timely manner [22, 23]. The causal role of optimism in benefit findings has been demonstrated by Affleck et\u00a0 al. (1987) as optimism being an important pre-requisite capacity for individuals to find benefits [48]. The literature related to optimism shows that those optimistic about life are more likely to gain a sense of profit or gain, even if they are experiencing traumatic events [26].\nIn addition, we found a positive correlation between social support and benefit findings. An explanation for this might be that social and emotional support from\nsupportive friends and family members can provide an important emotional cushion, empowering people to obtain more meaningful and beneficial positive responses, and redefine the situation as less threatening [49].\nContrary to expectations, social support could not negatively influence negative emotions, nor can social support mediate the association between optimism and negative emotions. The findings are consistent with those reported by Shelby et\u00a0 al. (2008), which indicate that social support might be an important protective resource for low-optimistic women. While among high-optimistic women, increasing social support does not bring added benefits [50]. In other words, social support could play a moderating role rather than a mediating role in the association between optimism and negative emotions. Women with high levels of social support could adapt better even if they are less optimistic, which implies that social support can compensate for low levels of optimism.\nIn general, our results suggested that optimism could influence perceived social support, benefit findings, and negative emotions. Moreover, perceived social support could influence benefit findings, and benefit findings could influence negative emotions. These findings indicate that optimism seems to work via interpersonal and cognitive resources to influence negative emotions. Ultimately, as we expected, a serial-mediation model with social support as a prerequisite for benefit findings was found. The finding that social support is a precursor are as follows: Previous research has shown that perceiving more social support allows individuals to seek out and find their beneficial benefits, and then reduce negative emotions. For instance, in a longitudinal study of benefit findings among cancer patients, those with more social support reported greater benefit findings [51]."

The findings can be put into clinical practice to promote quality of life and facilitate treatment interventions for BC patients. On the one hand, our findings suggest a reduced capacity for lowoptimistic individuals to perceive social support and identify benefit findings to and from cancer suffering, which leads to more emotional distress. Then we can take measures to identify and support this risky group of patients. On the other hand, optimism is often seen as a core, stable personality trait that is unlikely to change easily. If we want to take effective interventions, we can train and change patients\u2019 cognition and improve their ability to benefit from findings. For instance, Antoni et\u00a0al. (2001) found that cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention (CBSM) could help women who were initially assessed as low-optimistic to find more benefits from cancer adversity [52]. In addition, it\u2019s important to strengthen the education of the patient\u2019s family for them to provide more social support to the patient and help them better adapt to change. Finally, the possible differential effects of different treatment stages on anxiety and depressive symptoms require further attention and verification.\nThree points can summarize the strengths of this research: (1) Integrating previous researches that only explored the relationship between optimism, perceived social support, benefit findings and symptoms of anxiety and depression, we simultaneously considered optimism (intrapersonal resource), social support (interpersonal resource), benefiting findings (cognitive resource), symptoms of anxiety and depression (negative emotions) to provide a comprehensive picture of the adaptive resource\u2014emotional distress linkage. The serial mediation model provides us with new insights, enabling us to understand how personal traits affect interpersonal environment, then affecting cognitive strategy, and finally affect mental health. (2) We clarified the exact role of specific psychological resources, which is necessary when considering possible ways of targeted intervention (3). Given the close association between optimism and emotional distress after diagnosis, these findings also provide a viable way and explanation for the robust link between optimism and emotional distress, both from perspectives of reserved adaptive resources."

First of all, adopting a cross-sectional design in this exploratory study failed to conclude the causal relationship between these variables. Future studies using longitudinal methods are needed to further certify the direction from social support to symptoms of anxiety and depression,\nand to better understand how optimism affects symptoms of anxiety and depression. Second, it is only based on self-reported data of BC patients, and the research results are prone to have mono-method bias. Finally, data from our sample were derived from the Chinese population only. This limits generalizability to women who are not geographically similar."
