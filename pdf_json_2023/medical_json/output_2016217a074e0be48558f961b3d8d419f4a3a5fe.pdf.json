In terms of prevalence, CC is a rare disease [3], however, it is the most important cause of treatable blindness in infants and children [4].\nCC is unilateral or bilateral. In a clinical study of 351 children with CC in Nepal, the bilateral cataract accounted for 43.9% [5]. Another study on CC patients younger than 12 months in South India showed that 77.9% of the children had bilateral cataracts [6]. In the research of Chinese doctors, bilateral cataracts were found in 128 children (128/239, 53.6%) [7]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that bilateral cataracts accounted for 54.1% in CC [2]. These findings indicate at least half of children with CC had bilateral cataracts."

Since the opacification occurs in infants or young children, lens opacity in optic axis can cause serious visual impairment and even blindness. A meta-analysis including 27 studies showed that the global prevalence of CC was estimated to be 4.24 per 10,000 people worldwide,\n\u2020Na Hui and Lei Yu contribution for this work equally.\n*Correspondence: Hong Yan yan2128ts@hotmail.com 1Shaanxi Eye Hospital, Xi\u2019an People\u2019s Hospital (Xi\u2019an Fourth Hospital), Affiliated People\u2019s Hospital of Northwest University, 710004 Xi\u2019an, China\nMethods 28 patients with CC underwent DSBCS. AH samples were collected from each eye before surgery. The contents of cytokines in AH were detected by Luminex xMAP Technology.\nResults There was no significant difference in the expression of IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1 and PDGFAA in the AH of the first and second eyes (P = 0.35, 0.39, 0.17, respectively). The level of IL-8 in the first-eye AH was negatively correlated with age (\u03c1=\u2013 0.519, P = 0.008). IP-10 and MCP-1 in the second-eye AH were negatively correlated with age (\u03c1=\u2013 0.483, P = 0.009; \u03c1=\u2013 0.445, P = 0.018,respectively).\nConclusion The first-eye surgery in patients with CC may not cause the change of cytokines in the contralateral eye. The expression of IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 in the AH was negatively correlated with the age of patients.\nTrial registration The study was registered at www.chictr.org.cn on March 22, 2022 and the clinical trial number is ChiCTR2200057927.\nKeywords Congenital cataract, Cytokines, Delayed sequential bilateral cataract Surgery\nCataract surgery in children requires general anesthesia. Immediate Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery (ISBCS) can reduce the risks and complications of general anesthesia [8\u201310]. Another advantage of ISBCS for children is the rapid visual rehabilitation [11] for both eyes to reduce amblyopia in the second eye. Bilateral cataract surgery needing general anesthesia is an indication of ISBCS [9, 12, 13]. However, due to the concern about the potential risk of severe bilateral endophthalmitis, ISBCS for cataract surgery in children is still needs to be treated with caution [10].\nAs far as we know, the clinical studies on immediate versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS) in children mainly focus on complications [8, 10], anesthesia time [8] and follow-up visits [10]. Few studies concerned about the difference of cytokines between the first eye and the second eye cataract surgeries in children. Our previous and other studies focused on alteration of some cytokines in aqueous humor(AH) during the first and the second eye cataract surgery in adults [14\u201317]. We have found that TGF-\u03b22 levels in the aqueous humor are elevated in the second eye of high myopia and age-related cataract within short period after sequential cataract surgery [17, 18]. However, research on cytokines in AH of children is far less than that of adults. Wu [19] et al. found that 15 cytokines expressed in AH of patients with CC were different from that of patients with age-related cataract (ARC). Another study showed the cytokines with increased expression in AH of patients after congenital cataract surgery were interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10)/CXCL10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2, and interleukin 2(IL-2), respectively [20]. Therefore, cytokines in aqueous humor of patients with congenital cataract during delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery is our motivation and curiosity for further study.\nBased on our previous studies in high myopia and agerelated cataract eyes in adult, we compared the content of cytokines in AH of patients with CC between the first and the second eye during delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery."

It was approved by the ethics committee of Xi\u2019an People\u2019s Hospital and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. Guardians of each child were informed and signed consent before enrollment. The study was registered at www.chictr.org.cnon22/03/2022 and the clinical trial number is ChiCTR2200057927.\n28 patients with bilateral CC were included in this study. Previous history of ocular surgery, other congenital ocular or systemic diseases, including but not limited to glaucoma, corneal disorders, vitreous and retinal diseases, congenital heart disease, with AH content less than 0.5 ml, were excluded from this study. 28 patients with CC underwent lens aspiration, posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy. Intraocular lens (IOL) were implanted in patients over 2 years old, but not in patients under 2 years old. One eye was randomly selected for the first surgery, which was the first eye group. The other eyes underwent the second surgery after a period of time, which was the second eye group.\nAll patients underwent thorough ophthalmologic examination, including slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundus examination and B-scan ultrasonography. Corneal endothelium and IOL master (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) were examined in patients over 2 years old. The IOL power was calculated by Barrett II formula and the target diopter was determined according to the ocular axis and age of the patient. All surgeries were performed under general anesthesia by the same pediatric cataract surgeon, using a Stellaris platform (Bausch & Lomb Incorporated, Rochester, NY, USA). The procedures included conjunctival peritomy and 2.2\u00a0 mm corneoscleral tunnel incision at the 11 o\u2019clock position, the anterior continuous circular capsulorhexis with a diameter of about 5.5\u00a0mm, lens aspiration, posterior capsulotomy, limited anterior vitrectomy, in-the-bag implantation of IOL MI60 (Bausch & Lomb Incorporated, Rochester, NY, USA) and suturing conjunctival and corneoscleral incision. Postoperatively, a topical treatment included antibiotics (0.3% tobramycin eye drop, 4 times per day for a month) and steroids (1% prednisolone acetate eye drop, 4 times a day for a month)."

The detection rates of IP-10 and MCP-1 were also 100%, while the detection rate of IL-8 was 88% and 100%, respectively [17]. Therefore, we can speculate that some cytokines are not fully expressed in the AH of patients with CC or ARC, while IP-10 and MCP-1 are 100% expressed.\nWe compared the contents of IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1 and PDGFAA in the AH of the first eye and the second eye of patients with CC, and the results showed no significant statistical difference. Then we grouped the patients according to age and interval. The contents of the above four cytokines were still not statistically different. IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1 and PDGFAA in the AH of the contralateral eye may not varied in response to the first-eye surgery of patients with CC. Zhao et al. [20] showed that the levels of IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-2 in the AH of the\nTable 6 cytokines in first-eye and second-eye AH samples of patients with different intervals\nCytokines Interval less than or equal to 7 days (N = 14)\nConcentration[M (P25,P75)], pg/ml) Interval greater than 7 days (N = 14) Concentration[M (P25,P75)], pg/ml)\nFirst-eye Second-eye U P value First-eye Second-eye U P value IL-8/CXCL8 3.69(1.94,4.35)\n(N = 13) 2.89(1.82,3.15) (N = 13)\n56.00 0.15 4.29(2.09,7.61) (N = 12)\n3.58(2.06,3.87) (N = 13)\n67.00 0.57\nIP-10/CXCL10 31.35(16.39,41.22) 27.56(13.68,34.52) 80.00 0.43 23.79(14.94,34.40) 25.54(14.10,34.25) 105.00 0.52 PDGF-AA 29.00(17.87,37.49) 27.17(19.25,33.56) 89.00 0.70 29.89(22.23,39.53) 26.70(22.13,32.70) 83.50 0.51 MCP-1/CCL2 432.44(351.26,495.89) 412.23(321.47,491.93) 90.00 0.73 532.27(373.09,673.94) 544.87(375.47,751.16) 98.00 1.00\nFig. 3 Box-plot of cytokines in first-eye and second-eye AH samples of patients with different intervals\nsecond eye were significantly higher than those of the first eye in CC patients. Unlike our study, they compared 23 aphakic eyes with 26 eyes without cataract surgery instead of those with delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery. This may be the reason why their results are inconsistent with ours.\nOur previous study found that IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 had no significant difference in the AH of both eyes of ARC patients undergoing sequential cataract surgery [17]. Gong et al. found that MCP-1 and IL-8 had no difference in the AH between the first eye and the second eye of ARC patients without diabetes [16]. In addition, Gong et al. confirmed that MCP-1 and substance P were significantly increased in the second eye of ARC patients with diabetes. It may be that hyperglycemia increases the expression of MCP-1 and substance P and partly explains why ARC patients with diabetes are more likely to feel pain during the second-eye surgery than ARC patients without diabetes [16]. Zhang et al. used the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to detect the AH of 141 patients with bilateral ARC. When the interval was 1 week or 6 weeks, the concentration of MCP-1 in the second eye was higher than that in the first eye [14]. However, 32 of these 141 ARC patients were diabetes, which may affect the research results. Zhu et al. compared the cytokines in the AH of ARC patients with an interval of 1 month, and found that the concentration of MCP-1 of the second eye was significantly higher than\nthat of the first eye [21]. Instead of comparing the first eye and the second eye of the same patient, they compared some patients who had the first eye surgery with other patients who had the second eye surgery.\nPrevious studies have found that IL-8 and MCP-1 in the AH of CC patients without surgery are negatively related to age [19, 22]. We also confirmed that the expression level of IL-8 in the AH of the first eye was negatively related to age. In addition, the expression of IP-10 and MCP-1 in the AH of the contralateral eye after the firsteye surgery was negatively correlated with age in this study. IL-8, IP-10 and MCP-1 are chemokines. Under inflammatory conditions, chemokines are produced by immune and other cell types [23]. Any inflammatory process is characterized by the presence of cytokines and chemokines [24]. IL-8, also known as CXCL8, is mainly used to attract neutrophils to participate in acute inflammation [25]. It is also chemotactic to endothelial cells and plays a major role in angiogenesis [25]. IP-10, also known as CXCL10, is a protein that can be induced by interferon to attract lymphocytes. It has been proved that IP-10 can chemotactic monocytes, activated T cells and expandable NK cells [26\u201327]. MCP-1, also known as CCL2, is one of the key chemokines regulating migration and proliferation of monocytes/macrophages [28]. In theory, these three cytokines may participate in the inflammatory reaction after CC surgery. Due to ethical reasons, we cannot obtain the postoperative AH of CC patients. The negative\ncorrelation between the expression of IP-10 and MCP-1 in the contralateral eye and age may explain the clinical phenomenon that the postoperative inflammatory reaction in the eyes of young children is more serious.\nThe limitations of this study are as follows: First, the sample size is relatively small. Second, some cytokines were not detected in this study due to the limited volume of AH, such as TGF-\u03b2. Third, the AH of healthy children cannot be obtained as the control group.\nIn conclusion, for patients with CC who need general anesthesia, the advantages of ISBCS are obvious. If the first-eye surgery causes changes in cytokines in the AH of the contralateral eye, DSBCS may be a better choice to alleviate the impact of cytokine changes on the contralateral eye. The findings of this study indicates that the first-eye surgery may not lead to the change of cytokines. For children with congenital cataracts, to some extent, DSBCS has no advantage over ISBCS at the level of cytokines.\nAbbreviations AH aqueous humor CC congenital cataract ARC age-related cataract DSBCS delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery ISBCS Immediately Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery IOL Intraocular lens TGF-\u03b22 transforming growth factor-\u03b22 IP-10 interferon-inducible protein-10 MCP-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 IL-2 interleukin 2 G- CSF H- Granulocyte colony stimulating factor IL-1\u03b1 interleukin 1 alpha IL-6 interleukin 6 IL-7 interleukin 7 IL-3 interleukin 3 IL-8 interleukin 8 EGF epidermal growth factor TNF\u03b1 tumor necrosis factor\u03b1 PDGF-AA platelet-derived growth factor AA ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions NH was a major contributor in writing the manuscript.
