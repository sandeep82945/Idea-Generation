    "abstractText": "Salmonellosis is a disease caused by non-typhoid Salmonella, and although some lactic acid bacteria strains have been shown previously to relieve Salmonellosis symptoms, little has been studied about the preventive mechanism of Lentilactobacillus buchneri (L. buchneri) against Salmonella infection in vivo. Therefore, the L. buchneri was fed to C57BL/6 mice for 10 days to build a protective system of mice to study its prevention and possible mechanisms. The results showed that L. buchneri GX0328-6 alleviated symptoms caused by Salmonella typhimurium infection among C57BL/6 mice, including low survival rate, weight loss, increase in immune organ index and hepatosplenomegaly, and modulated serum immunoglobulin levels and intrinsic immunity. Importantly, the L. buchneri GX0328-6 enhanced the mucosal barrier of the mouse jejunum by upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludins, and claudins-4 and improved absorptive capacity by increasing the length of mouse jejunal villus and the ratio of villus length to crypt depth and decreasing the crypt depth. L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced the intestinal proliferation and invasion of Salmonella typhimurium by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the intestinal tract of mice, and reduced intestinal inflammation and systemic spread in mice by downregulating the expression of IL-6 and promoting the expression of IL-10. Furthermore, L. buchneri GX0328-6 increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria colonies and decreased the relative abundance of harmful bacteria in the cecum microflora by modulating the microflora in the cecum contents.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, Salmonella was considered the main pathogen of foodborne diseases worldwide including gastroenteritis [1, 2]. Salmonella stimulates the expression of immune system genes, which involve in the inflammatory responses [3, 4]. Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium causes non-typhoidal salmonellosis, which is one of the most prevalent foodborne diseases [5]. As an important intracellular bacterium, the infection of Salmonella typhimurium is not only a serious threat to human health but also causes significant economic losses in the agriculture industry [6, 7]. Although salmonellosis can be\ntreated with multiple types of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the limitation includes antibiotic resistance and food safety issues [8\u201311]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternative strategies to reduce the transmission of foodborne pathogens in a safer and eco-friendly way [12].\nProbiotics have been broadly used in producing food such as cheese, yogurt, and fermented salted fish [13\u201316]. The health benefits of fermented food have been confirmed. Probiotics have been described as \u201corganisms and substances that contribute to intestinal microbial homeostasis\u201d [17, 18]. It modulates the immune system, limits pathogen colonization, and controls inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders [19]. Previous studies found that probiotics alter the mucosal immune system through Toll-like receptor-mediated processes. They promote T helper cell 1 differentiation thereby increasing antibody production, inducing phagocytosis, and enhancing the activities of natural cells. Probiotics can Yan Shi, Hao Peng, and Yuying Liao contributed equally to this work. Extended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\nalso inhibit nuclear factor light chain enhancers to activate B cell pathways, induce T cell apoptosis, increase antiinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10, and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines [19\u201324]. Previous studies also showed that Lactobacillus plantarum P8 could inhibit oocyst shedding as well as improve the general growth performance and intestinal health among broilers infected by Eimeria coccidia [25]. Wang et\u00a0al. showed that Lactobacillus plantarum could attenuate Clostridium perfringens\u2013induced growth performances and soothe intestinal ecological disorders among broilers by an increased level of short-chain fatty acids therefore improving their intestinal health [26]. Previous studies also showed that taking dietary with Lactobacillus plantarum B1 could increase the number of lactic acid bacteria and the concentration of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the intestine [27]. Mazkour et\u00a0al. found that the supplementation with both Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus coagulans improved the growth performance through benefiting intestinal microorganisms in rats [28]. Jang et\u00a0al. found that the Lactobacillus fermentum improved mice\u2019s immune system by modulating their intestinal flora [29]. Wang et\u00a0al. represented that Lactobacillus reuteri promoted intestinal development and modulated mucosal immunity in neonatal piglets [30]. In general, different probiotic strains can either promote the growth performance of animals or attenuate the tissue damage caused by foreign pathogens and soothe their intestinal ecological dysregulations.\nThe Lentilactobacillus buchneri could metabolize lactic acid into acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol under the anaerobic and acidic conditions, therefore maintaining cell activities. In the storage of sugarcane silage, the L. buchneri reduces the loss of dry matter content, maintains its pH value, benefits the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) population, helps the dry matter recovery, and maintains the concentration of WSC, lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol concentrations within a healthy range [31\u201334]. In general, the application of L. buchneri has strong advantages in feed preservation, particularly in reducing dry matter loss, improving aerobic stability and degradation rate [35, 36]. Additionally, adding L. buchneri also has a lower cost compared to chemical additives [37, 38]. It has also been reported that L. buchneri promotes the growth performance of cattle and regulates the microbial population of silage [31, 35]. However, little is known about its regulation of intestinal mucosal barriers such as microflora in monogastric animals, and neither does the mechanism of L. buchneri in the prevention of Salmonella typhimurium infection, nor its probiotic potential has been well studied. Therefore, this study tends to investigate the preventive and protective effects of L. buchneri in improving the function of intestinal mucosal barriers and its immune functions against Salmonella typhimurium infection among C57/BL6 mice."

On day 5 after infection, body weight significantly decreased among mice in the positive group (SM022) (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced the weight loss caused by the infection of Salmonella typhimurium (P = 0.059). Figure\u00a01b shows that the oral administration of L. buchneri GX0328-6 could improve the survival rate of Salmonella typhimurium\u2013infected mice. The survival rate was 100% in both the negative control (CON) and L. buchneri-treated groups, 91.67% in the prophylactic group (LB + SM022) while only 50% of the positive group infected with Salmonella typhimurium survived. In addition, L. buchneri GX0328-6 pretreatment reduced the thymic and splenic indices in mice, especially the thymic index (P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a01c).\nThe probiotic L. buchneri GX0328\u20116 Reduces Transmission of\u00a0Salmonella Typhimurium Among C57BL/6 Mice\nCompared to the negative control group, we found that the IgG level was significantly increased (P < 0.05) among Salmonella typhimurium\u2013infected mice. Meanwhile, the levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM in mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium after pretreatment with L. buchneri GX0328-6 had no significant difference compared with the positive group. However, when treated with L. buchneri GX0328-6 only, mice showed a significant increase in IgG (P < 0.01) while the level of both IgA and IgM were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a02a, b, and c). Interestingly, among L. buchneri GX0328-6 pretreated mice, we found that pathogen translocation was significantly reduced in the spleen, the liver, and the cecum compared to the positive group; particularly, the largest amount of reduction was observed in their cecum (Fig.\u00a02d, e, f)."

We also investigated the morphological changes of\n1 3\nthe liver under infection by evaluating the frequency and severity of inflammatory foci. We observed the decrease of inflammatory cell number and hepatocyte necrosis in the liver of mice in the prophylactic group compared to the positive group (Fig.\u00a03). In addition, small intestinal villi and the ratio of small intestinal villi to crypt depth were significantly increased, and crypt depth was significantly decreased in the prophylactic group compared to the positive group (Fig.\u00a04).\nL. buchneri GX0328\u20116 Regulates mRNA Expression of\u00a0Inflammatory Cytokines, Antimicrobial Peptides, and\u00a0Intestinal Mucosa\u2013Associated Proteins During Salmonella Typhimurium C57BL/6 Infection\nFigure\u00a05a shows that the mRNA expression of the cytokine IL-6 with potential pro-inflammatory function was significantly lower in the jejunum of the prophylactic group compared to the group of positive controls (P < 0.005). Meanwhile, there was a trend of decreasing but not yet\nstatistically significant mRNA expression for the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig.\u00a0 5b). On the other hand, both groups treated by the prophylactic group and the L. buchneri group showed an increase of the Ang4 mRNA expression, while the mRNA expression of REG III decreased. Our data showed that Salmonella typhimurium significantly upregulated the expression of REG III mRNA, while it downregulated in the prophylactic group (Fig.\u00a05c, d). In addition, our data represented that Salmonella typhimurium decreased the expression of jejunal ZO-1, occludins, and claudins-4, but the mRNA expression of all three was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when pretreated the mice with L. buchneri GX0328-6 before infection with Salmonella typhimurium (Fig.\u00a06).\nL. buchneri GX0328\u20116 Could Regulate Intestinal Microflora in\u00a0Mice\nUsing Illumina MiSeq 16S amplification and sequencing technique, we investigated the effects which L. buchneri\nFig. 1 The body weight change (a), survival rate (b), and immune organ index (c) in mice treated or not during 10\u00a0days by L. buchneri GX0328-6 and then infected or not with Salmonella typhimurium SM022.

Compared to the negative control group, the proportion of Bacteroidota (54.78%) in the positive group decreased, Firmicutes (34.48%) increased, and Campylobacter (4.66%), Proteobacteria (1.98%), and Spirochaeta (1.53%) did not show significant changes, while the prevention group not only reduced the increase in Firmicutes (25.45%) caused by Salmonella typhimurium SM022, but also significantly reduced the proportion of Campylobacter (1.99%) (P\u00a0< 0.05) and Proteobacteria (1.09%) (P\u00a0= 0.0925) (Fig.\u00a09a, b). The relative proportion of the harmful bacteria, Spirochaetota (0.49%), was also reduced, although this change was not statistically significant. In addition, the relative proportion of Bacteroidota (68.16%) was also increased. Compared to the negative control group, the Muribiculaceae (32.94%) decreased in the positive control group, while the relative proportion of Muribaculum (3.75%), Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 (2.59%), Lachnocolstridium (7.64%), and Ruminococcus (0.68%) all increased.

            "text": "It has been reported that probiotics could maintain the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells in mammal model [48\u201350]. Feeding probiotics inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli in the jejunum, colon, and ileum [51]. The L. buchneri GX0328-6 strain showed good probiotic properties, which was isolated from sauerkraut, a plant-sourced, traditional fermented food collected from Guangxi province, China. Compared to the positive control group, we observed the gain of average body weight among mice that were pretreated with L. buchneri GX0328-6 before being infected by Salmonella typhimurium (Fig.\u00a01a). Previous studies have shown that the protection function of probiotic treatment includes the prevention of weight loss under the infection of Salmonella among animals [52]. This conclusion is consistent with the results of the present study. Figure\u00a01b shows that feeding the L. buchneri GX0328-6 as a pretreatment before the Salmonella typhimurium infection could significantly increase the survival rate from 50% (mice without GX0328-6 treatment) to 91.67%. Additionally, the L. buchneri GX0328-6 treatment also decreased the symptoms of the Salmonella infection as well as a healthier look of their coat and skin appearance (Appendix 1) and significantly reduced thymic index (P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a01c). This suggests that L. buchneri GX0328-6 can effectively alleviate clinical symptoms and mortality in mice during Salmonella typhimurium infection. Zhang et\u00a0al. [53] showed that feeding L. buchneri in chicks before the Salmonella infection could significantly reduce dysentery and improve survival rate, which is consistent with the results in mice after the treatment of L. buchneri GX0328-6 in this study. In contrast, Santos et\u00a0al. found that Lactobacillus plantarum 286 failed to protect conventional mice from Salmonella typhimurium infection, and there was no statistically significant difference among groups, nor was the survival rate changed [54]. This indicates that not all probiotic strains could improve the survival rate of Salmonella-infected animals. It also reaffirms the potential of the L. buchneri GX0328-6 as a probiotic in protecting mice from the poor outcome of the Salmonella typhimurium infection.\nStudies have shown that strong antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses are associated with defenses against the Salmonella typhimurium infection [55]. Oxidative outbreaks of invasive Salmonella typhimurium strains were positively correlated with serum levels of antibodies such as immunoglobulins IgG and IgM [56]. Despite the importance of antibodies in the control of Salmonella infection [57], little work has been done on analyzing the regulation of serum antibodies after animals were treated by the L. buchneri GX0328-6. This ignited our interest in revealing the role of serum antibodies against Salmonella\n1 3\ntyphimurium. Our data showed (Fig.\u00a02a, b, c) that mice infected with the Salmonella typhimurium had significantly increased levels of IgG (P < 0.05) and no significant differences in levels of IgM and IgA (P > 0.05) compared to controls. Other studies have also found elevated IgG antibody levels during 1\u20134\u00a0weeks after infection with Salmonella typhimurium inoculation [58]. Interestingly, feeding L. buchneri GX0328-6 alone to mice increased immunoglobulin IgG antibody levels, but IgG expression in mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium after pretreatment with L. buchneri GX0328-6 was not significantly different from that in mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium only. It is possible that L. buchneri-induced immunoglobulins form an antigen\u2013antibody binding reaction with Salmonella typhimurium, thereby slowing the rise in IgG antibody levels. However, the exact mechanism requires further studies before it can be resolved experimentally.\nIn the present study, the number of Salmonella typhimurium detections was significantly lower in all organs of the prophylactic group pretreated with L. buchneri GX0328-6 compared to the positive group (Fig.\u00a02e, f, g). After oral administration of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhimurium entered the intestine of mice and adhered to intestinal epithelial cells, thereby promoting bacterial colonization in the intestine through its type I hairs [59]. With the migration of phagocytes from the mesenteric lymph nodes, it eventually spreads throughout the body and invades different organs or tissues such as the liver and spleen, causing various clinical symptoms [60]. Invasion of Salmonella typhimurium leads to hepatosplenomegaly and eventually organ failure [61]. In the present study, L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced the load of Salmonella typhimurium in these organs and alleviated Salmonella typhimurium\u2013induced hepatosplenomegaly (Supplementary Figure) Similar results were observed by Acurcio et\u00a0al. [43] after feeding BALB/c mice with milk fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei NCC 2461 (ST11). In addition, H&E staining results showed that L. buchneri GX0328-6 pretreatment significantly reduced liver frequency, hepatocyte damage, and inflammatory cells (Fig.\u00a03). These data suggest that pre-feeding of L. buchneri GX0328-6 has a positive effect on inhibiting the proliferation and invasion of Salmonella typhimurium in the intestinal tract of mice and has a protective effect on organ damage in mice. Studies have shown that the use of certain probiotics can improve the function of the small intestinal barrier by modulating the immune response, thus blocking the translocation of pathogenic bacteria to sterile organs such as the liver [62]. As a result, the survival, proliferation, and spread of pathogens in visceral organs are controlled. The ability of L. buchneri GX0328-6 to reduce liver tissue damage may be related to these mechanisms. Interestingly, studies have shown that the spread of Salmonella to the liver and spleen is also associated with increased permeability of the intestinal\nbarrier [60]. In contrast, the mechanism of action of L. buchneri in regulating intestinal barrier function in animals is not known. Therefore, we next looked at the preventive protective effect of L. buchneri by measuring the intestinal mucosal barrier. The intestinal mucosal barrier consists of four parts: physical barrier, immune barrier, chemical barrier, and biological barrier, which can effectively protect against the invasion of foreign pathogenic microorganisms.\nOur results showed that Salmonella typhimurium significantly decreased villi length and villi length to crypt depth ratio and increased jejunal crypt depth in mice. This is consistent with previous findings [63, 64]. In contrast, L. buchneri GX0328-6 pretreatment significantly increased mouse jejunal villus height and the ratio of intestinal villus height to crypt depth and significantly decreased mouse jejunal crypt depth (Fig.\u00a04b, c, d). Prevention by L. buchneri GX0328-6 effectively counteracted the effects of Salmonella typhimurium SM022 on jejunal villus height and the ratio of intestinal villus height to crypt depth in normal mice. It has been shown that the addition of the probiotic Enterococcus faecalis to the diet increased jejunal villus height and ileal villus height [65]. In addition, the addition of a variant of Bacillus subtilis to the diet resulted in the same changes [66]. The same results were obtained in the present study. Also, our pathological histological analysis showed that L. buchneri GX0328-6 was effective in protecting the integrity of the small intestinal mucosal tissue and that the intestinal tissues were not damaged (Fig.\u00a04a). In addition, prevention by L. buchneri GX0328-6 effectively counteracted the effects of Salmonella typhimurium SM022 on jejunal villus height and the ratio of intestinal villus height to crypt depth in normal mice. Taken together, these results suggest that L. buchneri GX0328-6 protects the integrity of intestinal epithelial tissue. Furthermore, the length of the villi was significantly and positively correlated with the number of villi epithelial cells, and only mature villi cells had the function of nutrient absorption. Therefore, when the villi are long, there are more mature cells, and the nutrient absorption capacity is strong [67]. The crypt depth reflects the generation rate of intestinal epithelial cells, and a shallower crypt indicates an increase in the maturation rate of intestinal epithelial cells and enhanced secretion function. The ratio of villi length to crypt depth (V/C ratio) was used to reflect the functional status of the small intestine, and when the V/C value increased, it indicated that the villi had an increased ability to absorb nutrients, and vice versa [68, 69]. These results also suggest that L. buchneri GX0328-6 enhances intestinal absorption in mice.\nIn this study, the expression of the tight junction protein gene (ZO-1), occludins, and claudins-4 was upregulated in the intestine of mice in both the L. buchneri group and the prophylactic group (Fig.\u00a06a, b, c). The expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludins was reported to\n1 3\nbe reduced after Salmonella typhimurium infection [70]. Similar results were obtained from our experiments. Interestingly, we also found that Salmonella typhimurium also reduced the expression of claudins-4. Proteins such as ZOs, occludins, and claudins are tight junction structures in the intestine [71]. The intestinal epithelial barrier is the main site of nutrient absorption in the intestine and the first barrier for animals to resist pathogenic microorganisms and protect the organism from invasion by pathogenic microorganisms, and the intestinal tight junctions are the most critical part of the intestinal epithelium [72]. The ability of L. buchneri GX0328-6 to significantly increase these genes in this study may be a result of L. buchneri GX0328-6 expressing AvrA, as AvrA has been reported to be an effector in stabilizing intestinal tight junctions such as ZO-1 and occludins [73]. Previous studies have reported that certain probiotics significantly maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function in mammals [48\u201350]. The experimental results of the present study also supported this idea. These results suggest that L. buchneri GX0328-6 can protect the mouse intestine from Salmonella typhimurium by increasing the length of intestinal villi, decreasing the depth of intestinal crypts, and increasing the tightly connected structures of the intestine as physical barriers.\nSalmonella typhimurium induces intense intestinal inflammation in several agricultural animal hosts such as cattle, pigs, and poultry [74\u201377]. During the inflammatory response of the intestine, the intestinal mucosal barrier is damaged, leading to the recruitment of immune cells at the site of inflammation [78]. Some probiotics have been reported to reduce the severity of experimental colitis and improve intestinal inflammation in mice [79]. However, little has been reported so far on the inflammation-attenuating effect of the probiotic L. buchneri in\u00a0vivo. Studies have shown that feeding probiotics significantly increased IL-6 and IL-10 levels in broiler liver [80] and reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in weaned piglets [81], which had a modulating effect on the proliferation and differentiation of immune system cells. While there are relatively few applications and studies on L. buchneri in the intestine to regulate IL-6 and other intestinal mucosal immunity, therefore, in this study, we measured IL-6 and IL-10 contents in the jejunum of C57BL/6 mice to investigate the effect of L. buchneri GX0328-6 on intestinal mucosal immunity in mice. Our data showed that the gene expression of IL-6 was significantly reduced in the jejunum of mice in both the prophylactic and L. buchneri groups compared to the positive group. In contrast, administration of L. buchneri GX0328-6 alone significantly increased IL-10 gene expression, although IL-10 was also increased in mice pretreated with L. buchneri GX0328-6 and then infected with Salmonella typhimurium (Fig.\u00a05a, b). This finding is consistent with the development of probiotics for the treatment of intestinal inflammation [67\u201369]. IL-6 is commonly considered a pro-inflammatory\ncytokine produced by classically activated macrophage 1, which has a pro-inflammatory effect on chronic inflammation and autoimmunity [82]. IL-10, on the other hand, is produced by selectively activated macrophage 2 and is usually considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine [83]. IL-10 is closely associated with the prevention of mucosal inflammation by acting on Treg cells or macrophages to prevent inflammatory responses [84]. The results of this study suggest that L. buchneri GX0328-6 ameliorates intestinal inflammation by modulating inflammation-associated cytokines and thereby enhancing intestinal immune barrier function.\nIn addition to the above immune and physical barriers, the intestinal mucosal barrier also has a chemical and microbial barrier. The mucus layer of the chemical barrier is an important line of defense to prevent pathogenic microorganisms from directly contacting intestinal epithelial cells, and in combination with antimicrobial substances secreted into the mucus layer such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) including defensins, substances such as lysozyme and endogenous antimicrobial peptide-like substances defensins and regenerating islet derived protein 3 (REGIII), among others, constitute a chemical barrier [85, 86]. Antimicrobial REG III proteins play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by spatially separating bacteria, preventing potentially harmful immune responses, and protecting the host from infection [87\u201389]. In addition, it has been shown that Ang4 may have antimicrobial effects [89]. Therefore, we determined the expression of the antimicrobial peptide Ang4 and REG III by qPCR assay to investigate the effect of L. buchneri GX0328-6 on the intestinal mucosal barrier in mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium. In this study, infection with Salmonella typhimurium significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of REG III, while pretreatment with L. buchneri GX0328-6 followed by infection with Salmonella typhimurium significantly decreased the mRNA expression of REG III and also significantly increased the mRNA expression of Ang4. In addition, administration of L. buchneri alone also significantly increased the mRNA expression of Ang4 (Fig.\u00a05c, d). Our results suggest that L. buchneri GX0328-6 can promote the intestinal secretion of the antimicrobial substance Ang4 to defend against Salmonella typhimurium invasion. These results are consistent with the translocation results we observed for Salmonella typhimurium. L. buchneri has been shown to significantly induce the expression of REG III at the ileal crypt, ileal villi, and colon after intestinal colonization [90]. However, the results of the present study were contrary to this. Our results found that pretreatment with L. buchneri GX0328-6 followed by reinfection significantly downregulated REG III expression; instead, Salmonella typhimurium resulted in upregulation of REG III expression. It is possible that REG III, an important repressor in the natural immune system, is abundantly expressed after intestinal damage and enhances\n1 3\nnatural immune defense in the early stages of inflammation [89]. One study has shown that REG III protein is also consistently increased with increasing levels of inflammation [91]. This also suggests to us that the abnormally high REG III did not suppress the amount of Salmonella typhimurium colonization in the intestine of mice well; instead, the intestinal tissues were further disrupted. Therefore, when there is a strong inflammatory response in the mouse intestine, REG III may be regulated by these inflammatory factors and promote abnormal REG III expression with the increase of inflammation. And at this time, the intestinal immune system is severely disrupted only by the massive expression of REG III can no longer inhibit the invading microorganisms; instead, pro-inflammatory cytokines may interact with REG III to play an important role in the amplification of inflammation, but the specific mechanism still needs further study. In addition, L. buchneri GX0328-6 pre-treatment followed by reinfection significantly downregulated REG III expression. This suggests that L. buchneri GX0328-6 alleviated the intestinal inflammatory pathway likely by affecting inflammation-associated cytokines and thus reducing the abnormal expression of REG III. However, the specific regulatory pathways and mechanisms of L. buchneri GX0328-6 on related cytokines and REG III need to be further investigated.\nThe microbial barrier consists of a large and diverse community of microorganisms located in the intestinal lumen [92]. Currently, gut microbes have become an integral part of human health research [93]. Gut microbes form a symbiotic ecosystem, which maintains the homeostatic balance in humans and animals. However, this balance may be disrupted by pathological conditions that interfere with intestinal physiology [94]. Studies have shown that probiotics not only improve the intestinal tract and promote the reconstruction of the intestinal mucosa [95] but also improve the intestinal microecology by producing different metabolites that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria [96, 97]. For example, strains of Lactobacillus paracasei can be used to prevent Salmonella typhimurium infections [43]. It has been shown that the diversity and abundance of bacterial species is an aspect of a healthy intestinal microbiota [98]. To investigate whether L. buchneri GX0328-6 could maintain the microbial barrier in the intestine by modulating microorganisms, we determined the intestinal flora characteristics of mice in the control, prophylactic, and positive groups. In the present study, Salmonella typhimurium infection of C57BL/6 mice was able to reduce the abundance of intestinal Bacteroidetes. while L. buchneri GX0328-6 not only enhanced the population of Bacteroidetes to some extent but also inhibited the colonization of the intestine by certain pathogens (Figs.\u00a07, 9). Bacteroidetes is a beneficial bacterium, one of the two most abundant phyla in the intestinal microbiome, that\ndirectly mediates the metabolism of carbohydrates, steroids, bile acids, and sugars [99, 100]. Furthermore, our results suggest that Salmonella typhimurium infection of C57BL/6 mice altered the structure of the mouse intestinal microbial community by increasing the relative abundance of pathogens of Protebacterota and Campilobacterota. In contrast, early administration of L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced the proportion of harmful bacteria such as Protebacterota, Campilobacterota, and Helicobacter (Figs.\u00a07, 9). Alterations in intestinal morphology, function, and bacterial flora have been reported to be caused by inflammation. Pathogenic intestinal flora may negatively affect the nutrition of patients and their metabolic efficiency by decreasing microbiota diversity, thus reducing the production of beneficial metabolites [101]. Salmonella infection leads to an increase in the number of potential pathogens and parthenogenic anaerobes in the cecum microbiota directly disrupting the intestinal flora ecosystem, which leads to malnutrition of the intestinal flora and causes intestinal inflammation [102, 103]. After feeding L. buchneri GX0328-6, the contents of the mouse cecum showed an increase in the dominant flora, such as the Bacteroidetes, and a decrease in the harmful flora, such as Campilobacterota, with changes in their colony structure, which may be due to the fact that L. buchneri GX0328-6 promotes the colonization of beneficial flora, decreases the number of harmful bacteria, and attenuates the inflammatory response caused by harmful bacteria through the production of different metabolites. These results are consistent with the results observed in the immune barrier in which the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was reduced, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was elevated in the intestinal mucosal tissue. Thus, L. buchneri GX0328-6 prophylaxis can effectively reduce the disruption of intestinal flora structure.\nOur results found that Salmonella typhimurium infection of C57BL/6 mice increased the abundance of Lachnocolstridium, Muribaculum, Prevotellaceae_UCG001, and Ruminococcus. In contrast, feeding L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced the abundance of these flora and Bacteroides (Fig.\u00a0 8). Lachnocolstridium, which constitutes an important component of the intestinal flora, can exert anti-inflammatory effects and plays a role in homeostasis in\u00a0vivo [104]. Prevotellaceae has been shown to increase the severity of DSS-induced colitis in mice [105]. And Prevotella and Bacteroides are the main species in the healthy human intestinal flora that produce acetate and propionate from complex carbohydrates to provide nutrition and maintain the normal physiological functions of the intestine [106]. Salmonella typhimurium infection of C57BL/6 mice increased the abundance of Lachnocolstridium, Muribaculum, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Ruminococcus. It may be that the organism\u2019s microflora is resistant to foreign invasive pathogens. In addition, compared to the positive\n1 3\ngroup, the prevention group showed an increased abundance of Muribiculaceae and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Muribiculaceae formerly known as S24-7 family, which is the main bacterial group in the mouse intestine [107, 108]. The relative abundance of Muribaculaceae was negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and positively correlated with the expression levels of tight junction protein and mucin 2 [109]. The Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group is a representative butyrate-producing bacterium that maintains intestinal barrier integrity in mice and is negatively correlated with intestinal permeability. Butyrate, one of the major SCFAs produced by the microbiota, is important in maintaining gastrointestinal health due to its ability to enhance epithelial barrier integrity and inhibit inflammation [110]. Therefore, Muribiculaceae and Lachnospiraceae_ NK4A136_group are important in maintaining the normal state of the intestine in mice [111]. It also indicates that L. buchneri GX0328-6 can prevent damage to intestinal tissues by Salmonella typhimurium by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal flora and by inhibiting certain pathogenic bacteria."

The possible mechanism is through the ability of the L. buchneri GX0328-6 to modulate the level of serum immunoglobulins, enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier, and reduce the effect of the Salmonella typhimurium on the intestinal invasion of mice. Immunoglobulin levels did not change in mice after infection with Salmonella typhimurium probably because L. buchneri-induced immunoglobulins formed an antigen\u2013antibody binding reaction with the Salmonella typhimurium during the infection cycle. Nevertheless, pre-treated with L. buchneri GX0328-6 followed by the Salmonella typhimurium infection also modulated the intrinsic immunity of mice. The L. buchneri enhanced the mucosal barrier and absorptive capacity of mouse jejunum by upregulating the expression levels of tight junctions such as ZO-1, occludins, and claudins-4 and increasing the ratio of villi length and villi length to crypt depth in mouse jejunum and decreasing the crypt depth through GX0328-6. Interestingly, the L. buchneri GX0328-6 reduced intestinal proliferation and invasion of Salmonella typhimurium by promoting the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the mouse intestine, and reduced intestinal inflammation and systemic spread in mice by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and promoting the\nexpression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the jejunum. In addition, the L. buchneri GX0328-6 increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and decreased the relative abundance of harmful bacteria in the cecum microflora by modulating the microflora in the cecum contents.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12602- 023- 10145-8.\nAuthor Contribution Conceptualization, Yan Shi, Hao Peng, and Xun Li; formal analysis, Yan Shi, Hao Peng, and Xun Li; investigation, Yan Shi, Hao Peng, Xun Li, Yuying Liao, Jun Li, Yangyan Ying, Hongyan Peng, Leping Wang, Yizhou Tan, Changting Li, Huili Bai, and Chunxia Ma, Wenbao Tan; writing\u2014original draft, Yan Shi; writing\u2014review and editing, Hao Peng and Xun Li.
