Endocrine therapy is commonly used for this subtype, targeting ER\u03b1 signaling to reduce 68 cancer cell viability. Tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator, is the primary and the frontline 69 endocrine therapeutic agent for ER+ breast cancer [5-8]. Tamoxifen has been shown to 70 significantly decrease the recurrence and mortality of breast cancer. However, approximately 71 30-40% of patients develop tamoxifen resistance, leading to therapy failure [9-11]. Overcoming 72 tamoxifen resistance is a critical challenge in clinical practice. Many mechanisms leading to 73 tamoxifen resistance have been reported, including alterations of ER\u03b1, crosstalk between ER\u03b1 74 signaling and other pathways, cell cycle regulation, and protective autophagy [12]. Despite 75 intense research, the molecular mechanism leading to tamoxifen resistance is still not fully 76 understood, and overcoming this resistance remains a significant clinical challenge [13]. 77 78 Systematic searches for genes responsible for tamoxifen resistance have been undertaken 79 using RNA interference screens, which identify a set of novel determinants of tamoxifen 80 sensitivity including components of a neddylation complex, modulators of chromatin remodeling, 81 members of RAS signaling cascade, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein [14, 15]. In 82 recent years, the development of gene editing technology, especially the CRISPR/Cas9 83 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9) system, provides convenient 84 tools to conduct genome-wide knockout genetic screens to identify drug resistance genes [16-85 22]. Notably, an epigenome screen via CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system has successfully 86 uncovered ARID1A, a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, mediating cell 87 sensitivity to the ER degrader fulvestrant, another widely used endocrine therapy [21]. Here, we 88 performed a loss-of-function CRISPR/Cas9 screen using a genome-wide sgRNA library to 89 identify genes associated with tamoxifen resistance. 90 91 Through the screen, we discovered that the expression of Tafazzin (TAZ, Gene ID: 6901. Please 92 notice that this is not the TAZ gene involved in Hippo pathway, the gene ID of which is 25937) is 93 a necessity to maintain cellular sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment. TAZ is an X-linked gene 94 encoding a mitochondrial transacylase required for the production of cardiolipin (CL), a specific 95 phospholipid found in mitochondria [23-27]. The metabolism of CL involves two steps: synthesis 96\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

TAZ is responsible for remodeling CL, upon which the vast majority of mature 98 cardiolipin molecules depend. However, other enzymes, including ALCAT1 (acyl-99\nCoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1) and MLCAT1 (monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 1), are 100 also involved in CL maturation. TAZ deficiency leads to the accumulation of its substrate 101 monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), and the reduction of the CL [25, 28]. Our results reveal that several 102 phospholipids are also essential in generating tamoxifen resistance. 103 104 Results 105 Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for identifying tamoxifen resistance genes 106 We applied a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening to identify genes involved in 107 therapeutic resistance to tamoxifen therapy, using the commonly used ER+ breast cancer cell 108 line MCF7 as the model system. MCF7 cells were transduced with the Brunello sgRNA library in 109 lentiCRISPR v2 (one vector system) of 76,441 small guide RNAs (sgRNAs), which targets to 110 knockout 19,114 genes. [29, 30]. One thousand non-targeting sgRNAs were included in this 111 library. Tumor cells were selected by tamoxifen citrate (shortened as tamoxifen in the following 112 text) treatment for three days and the surviving cells were considered to be drug-resistant. 113 Genomic DNA was isolated from these cells, and next-generation sequencing analysis was 114 performed (Fig. 1A). The abundance of each sgRNA in the original library was determined, with 115 most sgRNAs being evenly distributed and few being either low or high in abundance 116 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We analyzed the enrichment or depletion of sgRNAs by comparing 117 the tamoxifen-treated group to the DMSO-treated group, and the differential sgRNA 118 presentation in each group was determined using a Model-based Analysis of the Genome-wide 119 CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK) algorithm [31]. We obtained nine candidate genes by 120 setting a threshold with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 10% and a fold change greater 121 than 2 folds (Fig. 1B). These candidate genes were: RPS16, PELO, USPL1, CCDC81, 122 NDUFB4, IMP3, PSMD13, ROMO1, and TAZ. Additionally, the other leading increasing or 123 decreasing genes were showed and some of these genes might also be related to tamoxifen 124 resistance (Supplementary Fig. S1B&C). 125 126 To confirm the screening results, MCF7 cells were labeled with firefly luciferase, and 127 subsequent experiments measured cell survival using in vitro luciferase assay.

The knockout of RPS16, which encodes a ribosomal protein, proved toxic to the 130 cells. This is consistent with data from Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) that indicates cells 131 rely on RSP16 for survival (data not shown). For these candidate gene KO cells, the indel 132 frequencies were determined by the method of Tracking Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) to 133 confirm gene knockout efficiencies (Supplementary Table S5) [32]. 134 135 To validate the phenotype of the above KO cells, we assessed the survival rates of each group 136 following tamoxifen treatment compared to Non-Target (NT) control cells. Using two 137 independent sgRNAs, we observed significant increases in cell survival rates after tamoxifen 138 treatment for the PELO, ROMO1, and TAZ KO groups, whereas the KO of other genes 139 demonstrated no significant, or inconsistent survival benefits between two sgRNA KO cell 140 strains (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1D). To further investigate the clinical relevance of 141 these three genes, we performed patient survival analysis by using an online KMplot algorism, 142 which is based on multiple patient datasets. We found that lower expression level of ROMO1 or 143 TAZ is associated with poorer patient relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients undergoing 144 tamoxifen therapy (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1E). Moreover, even in patient dataset 145 without considering their treatment history, lower expression level of TAZ is still correlated with 146 poorer patient RFS of ER+ breast cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1F). In contrast, lower 147 expression level of PELO is correlated with better patient relapse-free survival (Supplementary 148 Fig. S1G). Additionally, only TAZ was significantly downregulated in ER+ breast tumor tissues 149 compared to normal tissues, while ROMO1 had a tendency of higher expression in tumor 150 tissues than in normal tissues, although it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1E and 151 Supplementary Fig. S1H). These findings suggest that TAZ may play a critical role in 152 maintaining the sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, and its loss of expression may contribute to 153 the development of tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients. 154 155 Although there have been numerous studies exploring the mechanisms of resistance to 156 endocrine therapy for breast cancer [10, 33-37], the potential impact of intracellular phospholipid 157 metabolism on tamoxifen resistance remains largely unknown. Our findings show that TAZ KO 158 results in therapeutic resistance to tamoxifen, coupled with the fact that TAZ encodes an 159 enzyme involved in mitochondrial cardiolipin metabolism [23, 38], suggest that investigating the 160\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We confirmed the KO efficiencies of TAZ using TIDE analysis (Supplementary Figs. 167 S2A-C). KO of TAZ increased cell viability compared to NT cells at two different concentrations 168 of tamoxifen treatment in both cell lines (Figs. 2A&B). In MCF7 cells, TAZ depletion increased 169 the number of colonies during tamoxifen treatment in a long-term colony formation assay and 170 led to an increased number of tumor spheres in a tumor sphere formation assay (Figs. 2C&D 171 and Supplementary Fig. S2D). We then tested our findings in vivo by following experimental 172 procedures shown in Fig. 2E. Briefly, we implanted 4-6 weeks old female nude mice 173 subcutaneously with a slow-releasing estrogen pellet, followed by mammary fat pad injection 174 with 2 \u00d7 106 vector control or TAZ-KO MCF7 cells. Tumor volume was measured every four 175 days. Mice were then treated with tamoxifen three times a week after the tumor volume reached 176 60 mm3, and continued until the experimental endpoint (Fig. 2E). Tamoxifen administration 177 significantly reduced the tumor volume of control (NT) xenografts, whereas TAZ-deficient cells 178 were extremely resistant to tamoxifen and showed no obvious growth inhibition (Fig. 2F and 179 Supplementary Fig. S2E). 180 181 To determine whether TAZ deficiency causes resistance to a broad range of therapeutic agents, 182 we treated MCF7 and ZR-75-1 with cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces DNA 183 damage, and assessed their cell survival rates. The KO of TAZ protected both cells from death 184 caused by cisplatin (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, KO of TAZ also enhanced cell survival after 185 treatment with Olaparib, a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), which is typically 186 used in DNA repair-deficient cancers (Fig. 2H). However, the KO of TAZ did not confer any 187 obvious survival benefit during cisplatin and Olaparib treatments in MDA-MB-231 or SCP2 cells, 188 both of which are triple-negative breast cancer cells (Fig. 2H and Supplementary Figs. S2F-I). 189 These findings suggest that TAZ depletion-induced drug resistance might be specific to ER+ 190 breast cancer cells, but not to triple-negative breast cancers. 191 192\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

A similar decrease in ER\u03b1 protein 197 expression could be seen in ZR-75-1 cells after TAZ KO (Supplementary Fig. S3A). As a 198 transcription factor, ER\u03b1 must translocate from cytoplasm to the nucleus to function properly. 199 Therefore, we measured its intracellular localization and found that while ER\u03b1 was 200 predominantly localized to the nucleus in control cells, KO of TAZ resulted in a significant 201 decrease in nuclear localization and a clear increase in cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3C). 202 Consistent with the decreased protein expression and nuclear localization of ER\u03b1, the 203 expression levels of many classical ER\u03b1 signaling genes, including CCND1, GREB, MYC, PGR, 204 TFF1-3, were significantly down-regulated in TAZ KO cells both in RNA and protein levels (Fig. 205 3D, and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide (PI) staining and 206 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed a significant decreased in the S phase and 207 G2/M phase, and an increased G0/G1 cells in TAZ-KO cells compared to control cells (Fig. 3E). 208 In summary, these results indicate that TAZ KO led to decreased ER\u03b1 expression and nuclear 209 localization, resulting in the reduction of downstream gene expression and slowed cell cycle 210 progression, with a clear G1 arrest. Notably, the G1-arrest was not apparent in TAZ-KO SCP2 211 triple-negative breast cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3C), indicating that the 212 aforementioned drug resistances induced by TAZ KO in the ER+ cell lines may be associated 213 with their ability to induce cell cycle arrest. 214 215 Dormant tumor cells and recent discovered drug-tolerant persister cells with quiescent or slowly-216 cycling state have the capacity to escape the anti-tumor therapies and obtain long-term survival 217 [39-41]. Slow cell cycling might also be a common trait for tamoxifen resistance cells. To 218 investigate this hypothesis, we induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in MCF7 and T47D 219 cells by culturing them with serum-free medium, and subsequently treated them with tamoxifen 220 (Supplementary Fig. S3D&E). The results demonstrated that cells were more resistant to 221 tamoxifen treatment under serum-starvation conditions than under normal culture conditions 222 (Figs. 3F). Additionally, we created stable KO strains of MCF7 using selected sgRNAs from the 223 top 10% rank from our initial gRNA screening (Supplementary Table S2) and tested the 224\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

A correlation between cell 226 proliferation index and tamoxifen resistance was observed, whereby cells with lower 227 proliferation rates (proliferation index < 0.5) were more resistant to tamoxifen treatment, while 228 cells with mild or no suppression of cell proliferation (proliferation index > 0.5) were almost not 229 resistant to tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3G). Cell cycle analysis of cell lines bearing the KO of 230 these genes further revealed that cells bearing strong tamoxifen resistance (resistance ratio > 231 1.5) generally had a clear cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S3F). These 232 cells with lower proliferation rates showing cell cycle arrest, which could be considered as 233 quiescent cells, were likely to be more resistant to therapy. Moreover, serum starvation-induced 234 cell cycle arrest also led to therapy resistance of MCF7 cells to cisplatin and Olaparib 235 treatments (Figs. 3H&I). Interestingly, KO of TAZ resulted in a modest decrease in the cell 236 proliferation rate but generated a significantly strong therapeutic resistance phenotype, 237 suggesting that additional mechanisms might be involved in TAZ KO-induced resistance. 238 239 TAZ enzymatic activity is responsible for ER\u03b1 downregulation and drug resistance 240 To determine how TAZ affects ER\u03b1 expression and induces tamoxifen resistance, we 241 investigated whether there is a direct protein-protein interaction between TAZ and ER\u03b1. To this 242 end, we generated HA-tagged ER\u03b1 and FLAG-tagged TAZ constructs and co-transfected them 243 into HEK293T cells for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. However, there was no observable 244 interaction between these two proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4A). 245 246 We investigated whether the enzymatic activity of TAZ is relevant to its role in tamoxifen 247 resistance, given that TAZ is a mitochondrial-localized, phospholipid metabolic enzyme with 248 transacylase activity. The H4XD motif, located in the N-terminal region of TAZ, is essential for its 249 catalytic activity (Fig. 4A) [23]. To explore the role of this motif in tamoxifen resistance, we 250 generated an enzyme-dead mutant lacking the H4XD motif (named TAZ-\u0394H4XD) and examined 251 its cellular localization in MCF7 cells. TAZ-\u0394H4XD colocalized with MitoTracker, a mitochondrial 252 dye, similar to the wild-type TAZ protein, suggesting that the deletion of the catalytic center did 253 not affect TAZ's cellular localization (Fig. 4B). 254 255 We then evaluated the effect of rescue the tamoxifen resistance phenotype of TAZ-KO MCF7 256\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We confirmed that wild-type TAZ, but not 257 TAZ-\u0394H4XD expression could rescue cardiolipin (CL) and monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) levels in 258 TAZ-KO cells, indicating the importance of the intact metabolic enzymatic activity of TAZ 259 (Supplementary Fig. S4B&C). Intriguingly, TAZ overexpression significantly reduced the therapy 260 resistance to tamoxifen caused by TAZ deficiency, while TAZ-\u0394H4XD mutant still conferred 261 resistance to tamoxifen therapy. This rescue phenotype was observed in TAZ-KO cells 262 generated by three independent sgRNAs (Fig. 4C), and in TAZ knockdown cells generated by 263 shRNA construct (Supplementary Fig. S4D&E). TAZ overexpression also significantly reduced 264 the resistance to cisplatin, while TAZ-\u0394H4XD mutant was unable to rescue the resistance to 265 cisplatin treatment (Fig. 4D). 266 267 As we previously observed, TAZ KO led to a significant decrease in ER\u03b1 expression. Upon re-268 expression of TAZ, the protein expression level of ER\u03b1 was restored, while expression of TAZ-269 \u0394H4XD could not rescue the ER\u03b1 expression (Fig. 4E). TAZ re-expression, but not TAZ-\u0394H4XD 270 mutant, restored the mRNA expression of several ER\u03b1 downstream genes, including CCND1, 271 MYC, and TFF1 (Fig. 4F). In summary, our results suggest that the enzymatic activity of TAZ is 272 crucial for its role in tamoxifen resistance and the maintenance of ER\u03b1 expression. 273 274 A malfunction of the cardiolipin-reliant cellular mechanism induces tamoxifen resistance 275 Because TAZ is an essential enzyme that plays a crucial role in the maturation of cardiolipin 276 (CL), we hypothesized that a deficiency in TAZ could result in the downregulation of ER\u03b1 and 277 drug resistance by directly impacting intracellular phospholipid metabolism. TAZ facilitates the 278 transition of monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) to mature CL by remodeling cardiolipin (Fig. 4A). 279 Therefore, we used high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to 280 examine phospholipid metabolism levels in TAZ-knockout MCF7 cells and observed significant 281 perturbances (Fig. 5A). As expected, we found a significant accumulation of MLCL and a 282 marked decrease in CL levels in TAZ-KO MCF7 cells compared to NT-control cells (Fig. 5B). To 283 confirm that the perturbances in CL metabolism were responsible for drug resistance, we further 284 disrupted CL metabolism by knocking down the expression of other enzymes involved in CL 285 biosynthesis, such as TAMM41, PGS1, PTPMT1, and ALCAT1 (Supplementary Figs. S5A&B). 286 Depletion of the expression of these genes also induced cellular resistance to tamoxifen in 287 MCF7 cells, confirming the crucial role of cardiolipin metabolism in therapy resistance (Fig. 5C). 288\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Previous research has shown that CL on the mitochondria 292 membrane plays a critical role in the type II apoptotic response as a platform for caspase-8 293 recruitment, activation, and processing [42]. To investigate whether the abnormal CL 294 metabolism causes tamoxifen resistance by disrupting type II apoptosis, we measured caspase-295 8 processing by detecting its cleavage product, p43, after tamoxifen treatment (Supplementary 296 Fig. S5C). We found that only the caspase-8 processing on the mitochondria was blocked due 297 to the abnormal CL metabolism induced by TAZ-KO, as evidenced by decreased p43 protein 298 levels in TAZ-KO samples (Fig. 5D). This result suggests that the dysfunction of type II 299 apoptosis may be partially responsible for the aforementioned downstream phenotypes of CL 300 disorder. 301 302 TAZ-KO increases the cellular LPC level, which is partially responsible for tamoxifen 303 resistance 304 In the cellular phospholipid network, changes in one species can impact other phospholipids, 305 disrupting homeostasis [45]. Additionally, a previous study showed that TAZ depletion not only 306 decreased cardiolipin but also increased intracellular phosphatidylserine levels, affecting the 307 stemness and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells [24]. Thus, we re-examined the 308 global levels of intracellular phospholipids in TAZ-KO cells and observed an increase in some 309 phospholipids, and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was the most up-regulated lipid besides 310 MLCL (Fig. 5A). To investigate the relationship between elevated cellular level LPC and 311 tamoxifen resistance, we supplemented cell culture with external LPC and tested their ability to 312 induce tamoxifen resistance. We found that the addition of LPC significantly improved cell 313 viability and clone formation in tamoxifen killing assays in both MCF7 and T47D cells (Figs. 314 5E&F, and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Further, we observed that the addition of LPC restrained 315 ER\u03b1 expression and impaired the nuclear localization of ER\u03b1, similar to the phenotype observed 316 in TAZ-KO cells (Figs. 5G&H). In conclusion, TAZ deficiency leads to elevated intracellular LPC 317 level, which may contribute to tamoxifen resistance, likely by regulating ER\u03b1 expression and 318 cellular localization. 319 320\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

LPA is a bioactive molecule that can bind to its receptors (LPAR1-6) and activate 324 intracellular survival signals, promoting tumor cell division, growth, and migration (Fig. 6A) [48]. 325 As the level of LPC is significantly increased in TAZ-deficient tumor cells, we investigated 326 whether the level of LPA is similarly affected and increased. Our results showed that the level of 327 LPA was significantly elevated in the conditional media from TAZ-KO MCF7 cells, with a 1.5-fold 328 upregulation compared to control cells (Fig. 6B). Treatment of TAZ-KO MCF7 cells with the 329 LPAR1/2/3 antagonist, Ki16425, showed that these cells were more sensitive than control cells 330 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). TAZ-deficient MCF7 cells were also re-sensitized to tamoxifen 331 treatment (Fig. 6C). Similar experimental results were obtained in T47D cells (Supplementary 332 Fig. S6B). Besides, external supplement of LPA to cell culture also improved cell viability of 333 MCF7 cells during tamoxifen killing assay (Supplementary Fig. S6C). As TAZ-KO cells down-334 regulate their ER\u03b1 signaling to resist tamoxifen therapy, they may simultaneously require the up-335 regulation of LPA signaling to provide a cellular survival signal. Subsequently, we found that the 336 mRNA level of ENPP2, which encodes ATX, was upregulated in TAZ-deficient MCF7 cells (Fig. 337 6D), and the protein level of ATX in the supernatant and cytosol was significantly elevated 338 compared to control cells (Fig. 6E). In both MCF7 and T47D cells, treatment with the ATX 339 inhibitor PF8380 in combination with tamoxifen lowered the survival rate of TAZ-KO cells to a 340 level comparable to that of control cells (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S6D). Taken together, 341 these results suggest that the survival of tamoxifen-resistant TAZ-KO cells might depend on the 342 LPC-LPA-LPAR phospholipid signaling axis. Inhibition of this synthesis pathway may restore the 343 sensitivity of ER+ tumor cells to tamoxifen treatment. 344 345 To extend our findings, we utilized a tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cell line (MCF7-TAM-R), which 346 was generated through a long-term, low concentration tamoxifen treatment in vitro. Using 347 HPLC-MS analysis, we measured the phospholipid metabolites in TAM-R cells and found that 348 MCF7-TAM-R showed similar phospholipid production compared to TAZ-KO cells, with about an 349 80% decrease in CL and a 2-fold increase in LPC (Fig. 6G). Furthermore, the protein expression 350 level of ER\u03b1 in MCF7-TAM-R was significantly low, similar to TAZ-KO cells (Fig. 6H). The 351 overexpression of TAZ, but not TAZ-\u0394H4XD mutant, restored tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF7-352\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Additionally, we employed the ATX inhibitor, PF8380 to treat the 353 resistant cells with or without tamoxifen. Neither tamoxifen nor PF8380 alone had a significant 354 killing effect on MCF7-TAM-R cells. However, the combination of both PF8380 and tamoxifen 355 significantly reduced the survival rate of tumor cells by nearly 70% (Fig. 6K). 356 357 Discussion 358 The occurrence of therapy resistance in breast cancer is a severe bottleneck in clinical and is 359 the major cause of treatment failure and patient mortality [2, 4, 49-51], and the molecular 360 mechanisms that underlie therapy resistance are not yet fully understood. To address this 361 challenge, we employed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen to 362 systematically identify candidate therapy-resistance genes. Our study revealed that TAZ, a 363 mitochondrial-localized lysophospholipid-phospholipid transacylase that is required for the 364 production of the phospholipid, CL, is essential for tamoxifen-induced cell death [23]. 365 366 Lack of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), the cellular target of tamoxifen, is a 367 well-known mechanism of tamoxifen resistance in many studies [52, 53]. Our results showed 368 that loss of TAZ led to suppression of ER\u03b1 expression, retention of ER\u03b1 in the cytoplasm, and 369 perturbation of ER downstream signaling, including CCND1, which is essential for G1/S cell 370 cycle transition. Therefore, TAZ appears to downregulate ER\u03b1, the major tamoxifen target, as a 371 means of escaping tamoxifen therapy. TAZ-KO cells exhibited a moderate reduction in cell cycle 372 progression rate due to the downregulation of ER signaling. Although cell cycle inhibition is a 373 primary strategy for controlling tumor growth and promoting apoptosis [54], quiescent cells or 374 dormancy tumor cells also proliferate slower or even halt their cell cycle [39, 55-57]. In addition, 375 drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells have emerged as a concept in drug resistance research, 376 characterized by a quiescent or slowly-cycling state in which tumor cells enter a reversible cell 377 cycle arrest. Several DTP-related studies have been conducted to identify the genetic features 378 or epigenetic modifications that regulate the development of DTP-induced drug resistance [40, 379 41, 58, 59]. We knocked out a set of genes with low-, medium-, or normal (high)- proliferation 380 indices and examined their tamoxifen resistance. KO of slow-proliferating genes significantly 381 increased tamoxifen resistance, while KO of the remaining genes had little effect. Thus, cell 382 cycle regulation can be a \"double-edged sword\" for tumor therapeutic resistance because slow-383 cycling cells are more likely to be drug-resistant. 384\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Firstly, we observed a reduction in mature CL levels in 387 TAZ knockout ER+ cells, and CL was found to be required for maintaining tamoxifen sensitivity. 388 A previous study demonstrated that CL is necessary for caspase-8 activation induced by 389 exogenous apoptosis (33). Tamoxifen promotes apoptosis via a caspase-8 dependent 390 mechanism as a calmodulin antagonist [60, 61], and our results show that tamoxifen induces 391 apoptosis of breast cancer cells by activating caspase-8. Abnormal CL metabolism caused by 392 TAZ deficiency inhibits the apoptotic response. Secondly, lipid metabolism is a highly 393 interconnected network, and alteration of one lipid species can affect other intracellular lipids 394 [45]. Depletion of TAZ blocks the remodeling of mature CL from MCLC, resulting in the 395 accumulation of MLCL and other upstream phospholipids in tumor cells. As an indirect result of 396 the perturbation of the CL synthesis pathway, many other phospholipids, including LPC, are 397 upregulated in TAZ-KO cells. Our results show that LPC induces tumor cells to develop 398 tamoxifen therapy resistance, causing the down-regulation of the ER\u03b1 protein and reducing its 399 nuclear localization. Thus, the down-regulation of ER\u03b1 signaling caused by TAZ KO could be 400 mainly mediated through LPC. 401 402 The LPC generated as a result of TAZ deficiency could be further metabolized into bioactive 403 LPA by the enzyme ATX, whose expression is known to be associated with tumor progression 404 [47, 62, 63]. A few studies report that increased ATX expression and LPA signaling promote the 405 development of cancer resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy [48, 64, 406 65]. However, the relationship between the ATX-LPA axis and tamoxifen resistance is not well 407 understood. In our study, we found that inhibiting ATX enzymatic activity directly or blocking LPA 408 receptor activation sensitizes tumor cells to tamoxifen treatment. The ATX-LPA axis has been 409 implicated in many other diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory 410 arthritis. Some ATX inhibitors have been developed and entered into clinical trials, including 411 GLPG1690, BBT-877 and BLD-0409[66]. Currently, several small-molecule ATX inhibitors are 412 being tested in human clinical trials for pulmonary fibrosis [67]. These inhibitors could be 413 repurposed for usage in treating tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer patients. 414 415 Materials and Methods 416\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. 585 Self-made slow-release oestrogen pellets (\u03b2-oestradiol 0.72 mg per implantation) were 586 transplanted into 6-week-old female Nude/nude mice before tumor cell inoculation. 50 \u03bcl PBS 587 containing 2\u00d7106 TAZ KO MCF7 or control cells (NT) were mixed 1:1 (volume) with Matrigel 588 (Corning, Catalog # 354234) and then injected into the fourth mammary fat pads of mice. When 589 the tumor size reached about 60 mm3, mice were randomized to be treated with tamoxifen 590 (Abcam, Catalog # ab120656) or vehicle (10% DMSO, 90% corn oil). Tamoxifen was injected 591 intraperitoneally at a dose of 1.5 mg per mouse, three times per week. Tumor volumes were 592 measured every four days and the tumor volumes were calculated as volume (mm3) = length \u00d7 593 width2/2. No blinding was done. 594 595 ELISA 596 The lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) concentration in cell supernatant was measured by ELISA 597 (Abmart, Catalog # AB-3859A) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were cultured in 598 serum-free medium for 18 h. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 599 minutes to remove debris. Plates were measured by EnVision\u00ae Multimode Plate Reader 600 (PerkinElmer). 601 602 Cellular fractionation 603 Cells were washed by PBS, pelleted and lysed in cytosol extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 604 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1M hexylene glycol, 100 \u03bcM digitonin) for 10 minutes on ice. The lysates 605 were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants were cytosolic fraction. 606 Then the pellets were further lysed in membrane extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 607 mM NaCl, 1M hexylene glycol, 1% IGEPAL) for 10 minutes on ice.

The remaining 609 pellets were nuclei fraction. 610 611 Quantification and Statistical Analysis 612 Sample sizes were chosen based on preliminary experiments or experimental designs in related 613 studies. For animal studies, no statistical methods were used to estimate sample size. Results 614 were reported as mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) or mean \u00b1 SEM (standard error of the mean), 615 as indicated in the figure legends. Unpaired t-test or two-way ANOVA analysis was used to 616 calculate the statistical significance of the difference in a particular measurement between 617 groups. p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All experiments with 618 representative images (including immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining) were 619 repeated at least twice and representative images are shown. 620 621 Acknowledgments 622 We thank D.
