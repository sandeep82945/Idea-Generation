DESIGN Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to 1 May 2021. REVIEW METHODS Cohort studies looking at the association between general or central adiposity and body fat content and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the general adult population were included. Two of the authors extracted the data in duplicate. Random effects dose-response meta-analyses were performed to estimate the degree of the associations. Curvilinear associations were modelled with a one stage weighted mixed effects meta-analysis. RESULTS 216 cohort studies with 2.3 million individuals with type 2 diabetes among 26 million participants were identified. Relative risks were 1.72 (95% confidence interval 1.65 to 1.81; n=182 studies) for an increase in body mass index of 5 units, 1.61 (1.52 to 1.70; n=78) for a 10 cm larger waist circumference, 1.63 (1.50 to 1.78; n=34) for an increase in waist-tohip ratio of 0.1 units, 1.73 (1.51 to 1.98; n=25) for an increase in waist-to-height ratio of 0.1 units, 1.42 (1.27 to 1.58; n=9) for an increase in visceral adiposity index of 1 unit, 2.05 (1.41 to 2.98; n=6) for a 10% higher percentage body fat, 1.09 (1.05 to 1.13, n=5) for an increase in body shape index of 0.005 units, 2.55 (1.59 to 4.10, n=4) for a 10% higher body adiposity index, and 1.11 (0.98 to 1.27; n=14) for a 10 cm larger hip circumference. A strong positive linear association was found between body mass index and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Positive linear or monotonic associations were also found in all regions and ethnicities, without marked deviation from linearity at a specific cut-off value. Indices of central fatness, independent of overall adiposity, also had positive linear or monotonic associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Positive linear or monotonic associations were also found for total and visceral fat mass, although the number of studies was small. CONCLUSIONS A higher body mass index was associated with a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A larger waist circumference, independent of overall adiposity, was strongly and linearly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42021255338.",

Currently, about 460 million adults aged 20-79 years live with diabetes, accounting for 10% of global health expenditure.1 Type 2 diabetes is the main form of diabetes in 90-95% of individuals with diabetes, with a rising trend over the past several decades.2 Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a two to threefold higher risk of premature death.3\nWorldwide, the obesity epidemic has continued to increase for three decades.1 Adiposity has become a global public health concern and is accompanied by a large financial burden on healthcare systems.4 People with adiposity are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease,5 site specific cancers,6 and premature death.7 Individuals with obesity are also at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes throughout their lifetime.8 A previous meta-analysis of 18 prospective cohort studies suggested that people with obesity, defined as a body mass index \u226530, are at sevenfold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than normal weight adults.9\nAlthough adiposity is an established risk for type 2 diabetes,2 no comprehensive systematic review or meta-analysis of epidemiological studies has summarised the evidence for the degree and shape of the association between general and central adiposity and the risk of type 2 diabetes.

We selected studies that had a cohort design (prospective and retrospective cohort studies); that were conducted in general adult populations (>18 years); that measured body mass index, hip circumference, waist circumference, thigh circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-thigh ratio, waist-to-height ratio, body adiposity index, body shape index, percentage body fat, fat mass, and visceral adipose tissue as the exposure and across two or more quantitative categories; that considered the incidence of type 2 diabetes as the outcome; and that reported the number of participants or person years\nand the number of individuals with diabetes, and adjusted effect estimates (relative risk, hazard ratio, or odds ratio) with 95% confidence intervals for type 2 diabetes across categories of measures of adiposity. Studies that reported effect estimates for a specific unit increase in measures of adiposity (eg, an increase in body mass index of 1 unit) were also eligible. For duplicate publications from the same cohort, those with more complete information for dose-response meta-analyses (eg, those that expressed exposures as categories and reported sufficient information across categories) were selected. Otherwise, publications that included the largest number of participants were selected. Excluded were cross sectional and casecontrol studies, studies conducted in patients with diseases, inpatient populations, or elderly patients in institutions, and studies that used self-reported anthropometric measures as exposures. To be included in our review, studies had to have an explicit statement about measuring anthropometric indicators. For cohort studies with incomplete information about the method of measuring anthropometric indices, we read other publications from that cohort or cohort protocol to obtain accurate information about the measurement method. Also, studies that used specific body fat content as the exposure, such as abdominal or leg fat mass, were excluded.\nData extraction and assessment for study quality After the study selection process, two reviewers (AJ and SS) independently extracted data from the original cohort studies. The characteristics extracted from each cohort were: the last name of the first author, year of publication, study name, location of the study (country), sex, sample size and number of individuals with type 2 diabetes, age range, length of follow-up, method for identifying outcome, and variables that were entered into the multivariable analyses in primary cohorts.\nWe also extracted data for performing the analyses: range of exposures, number of individuals with type 2 diabetes and participants or person years, and reported effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals in each category for measures of anthropometric indicators. For studies that did not report sufficient data for the analyses, we contacted the authors by email. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two reviewers. We evaluated the quality of the cohort studies with the ROBINS-I tool (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions).15 This tool was developed by Cochrane to assess the quality of non-randomised studies of interventions and is recommended to evaluate the potential biases associated with observational studies.16 Quality assessments were conducted in duplicate by two independent reviewers (AJ and SS-B).

The ROBINS-I tool is increasingly used for assessing the risk of bias of observational studies. The tool includes seven domains and considers potential biases resulting from confounding, selection of participants, assessing the exposure, misclassification during follow-up, missing data, measuring the outcome, and selective reporting of the outcome.15\nData synthesis and statistical analysis We selected the relative risk and 95% confidence interval as the effect size for reporting the results of our meta-analysis. We considered hazard ratios equal to relative risk.19 For studies that reported effect estimates as odds ratios, we converted them to relative risk according to the method of Zhang et al.20 We used the random effects model (DerSimonian and Laired method) to generate summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.21\nFor the linear dose-response meta-analyses, we estimated summary relative risks and 95% 95% confidence intervals for an increase in body mass index of 5 units, 10 cm larger waist and hip circumferences, 5 cm larger thigh circumference, increase in waist-tohip ratio and waist-to-height ratio of 0.1 units, 10% higher percentage body fat, 10% higher body adiposity index, increase in body shape index of 0.005 units, and increase in visceral adiposity index of 1 unit in each primary prospective cohort study according to the methods of Crippa et al.22 We then used random effects models to pool the individual study results.\nFor the analyses, the median of each category, number of individuals with type 2 diabetes and participants or person years, and adjusted effect estimates across at least two categories of exposures were extracted from each primary cohort study. For studies reporting exposures as a range in each category, the midpoint of the lower and upper bounds was used as a proxy for the median. The widths of the open ended categories were considered equal to the adjacent categories. We pooled relative risks for men and women within each study with a fixed effects model if studies only reported effect sizes specific for sex. For studies that reported the effect estimates graphically, a web plot digitiser (www:// plotdigitizer.sourceforge.net/) was used to estimate effect estimates from the graphs. We checked the accuracy of these tools in our previous meta-analysis of central fatness and mortality, which indicated precise estimations by these tools.7 For studies that reported a category other than the lowest one as a reference, we recalculated the relative risks assuming the lowest category as the reference, according to the method of Hamling et al.23\nAfter a comment from referees, we performed a sensitivity analysis after exclusion of studies that reported odds ratios as the effect size to ensure the robustness of the findings. Prespecified subgroup analyses were done according to location of the\npopulation, age, sex, number of individuals with type 2 diabetes, length of follow-up, and adjustment for confounders, including intake of alcohol, smoking status, physical activity, and family history of diabetes, and for the intermediate variables blood pressure and blood glucose. We also performed post hoc subgroup analyses by the method of case ascertainment (ie, method of identifying individuals with type 2 diabetes). P values for differences between subgroups were calculated by meta-regression analyses. We also performed sensitivity analyses in healthy participants. For the analyses of healthy individuals, any definition of healthy individuals used in primary cohorts, including those without cardiovascular disease, noncommunicable chronic diseases, or cardiometabolic abnormalities, were acceptable (because primary cohorts used a wide range of definitions for healthy individuals). Publication bias was assessed when at least 10 studies were available.13 The potential for publication bias was tested with Egger\u2019s test,24 Begg\u2019s test,25 and by inspection of funnel plots. To differentiate asymmetry caused by publication bias from that caused by other factors,26 we applied contour enhanced funnel plots.27\nCurvilinear dose-response associations were modelled with a one stage weighted mixed effects meta-analysis.22 We modelled the exposures by using restricted cubic splines with three knots, according to Harrell\u2019s recommended centiles (10%, 50%, and 90%) of the distribution.28 The correlation within each category of published relative risks was taken into account and the estimates specific to each study were combined in a one stage weighted mixed effects metaanalysis.22 29 This method estimates the slope lines specific to each study and combines them to obtain an overall average slope in one stage.30 31 For the analyses of body mass index, we considered the nadir of the curve of the association between body mass index and mortality (body mass index of 23) as the reference.32 For other anthropometric measures, we selected the median of the baseline values of the exposures of the included studies as a reference, and so we avoided selfselection bias in choosing the baseline for the curve and used a data driven approach. For all anthropometric measures, we first performed a main analysis including all eligible cohorts. Then, separate analyses were conducted according to sex, age, geographical region, ethnicity, and in healthy individuals. We applied the best fitting second order fractional polynomial to model curvilinear associations when restricted cubic splines could not be calculated because of the limited number of studies (n\u22642) included in the analyses.22 We used the Wald test to evaluate deviation of the data from linearity.\nTo compare the associations across different measures, we performed another analysis to estimate the summary relative risk for an increase of one standard deviation in each measure. For this analysis, we estimated the relative risk for each increase in standard deviation in each measure in each study.

For studies that reported the effect size for an increase of one standard deviation in exposure, the effect size was included in the metaanalysis as reported. For studies that reported the effect size for a specific amount of increase in measures, we exponentiated the log (relative risk) times the standard deviation of the anthropometric measure for each study to obtain the relative risk for an increase of one standard deviation in the level of the measures. Similar to a linear dose-response meta-analysis, for studies that reported exposures across quantiles, we estimated the relative risks for an increase of one standard deviation with Crippa et al\u2019s method.22 Statistical analyses were conducted with STATA software, version 16.0.

The analyses indicated a strong positive linear association between body mass index and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Similar linear associations, with no evidence of deviation from linearity at a specific cut-off value, were seen in different region, race, and ethnicity subgroups. Indices of central obesity also showed similar linear (waist circumference) or monotonic (waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio) associations with type 2 diabetes. These positive linear or monotonic associations were confirmed by the analyses of more objective measures of body fat content, such as percentage body fat and visceral adiposity index. These associations were consistently stronger in European countries. A larger hip circumference was linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.\nComparison with other pairwise meta-analyses A limited number of systematic reviews and metaanalyses of cohort studies have been undertaken of the association between measures of adiposity and the risk of type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of 18 prospective cohorts indicated that individuals with overweight (body mass index 25-29.9) and obesity (body mass index \u226530) had a 292% and 728% increased risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively.9 Another metaanalysis of 15 cohort studies found that an increase of one standard deviation for body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes of 55%, 63%, 52%, and 62%, respectively.11 A meta-analysis of 31 cohort studies showed a relatively linear association between body mass index and type 2 diabetes,10 but previous meta-analyses did not include a large number of primary cohort studies in their analyses.\nIn the analysis of body mass index, we found a strong positive linear association with type 2 diabetes, which was confirmed in the analyses for almost all regions and ethnicities. Although there was a non-linear association in some subgroups, no marked deviation from linearity was seen at a specific cut-off value.

Our findings indicated positive linear or monotonic associations between body mass index and the risk of type 2 diabetes in all regions, ethnicities, and races. These findings were from different studies (75 cohorts from the Far East v seven cohorts from the Middle East), however, with different sample sizes and lengths of follow-up, and different degrees of statistical control for confounders, and thus should be interpreted with caution.\nAnalyses of indices of central adiposity also indicated similar positive linear or monotonic associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes, with no marked deviation from linearity at a specific cut-off value. Analyses of different regions and ethnicities indicated similar findings. The results became stronger after adjustment for body mass index, suggesting that deposition of fat in this area of the body, independent of overall fatness, was related to a higher risk.7\nAnalyses of general and abdominal adiposity were confirmed by more objective measures of fatness. Analyses of the visceral adiposity index, representing deposits of fat in the visceral compartment, showed strong positive associations. Only five cohort studies were available for the non-linear dose-response meta-analysis of visceral fat, however, and thus more research might be needed to reach more confident conclusions.\nAnalyses of hip circumference confirmed our previous finding about the inverse association of hip circumference and risk of all cause mortality,7 suggesting that deposits of fat in the gluteofemoral compartment could have a protective effect. We also found that the analyses of hip circumference should be controlled for waist circumference to show these protective effects.\nIn the analyses of body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio, a subgroup analysis by length of follow-up indicated substantial stronger associations in studies with a longer followup. A previous meta-analysis of cohort studies of body mass index and all cause mortality indicated similar stronger associations in studies with longer follow-up periods,37 suggesting a weaker potential for bias owing to weight loss from pre-existing disease in studies with a longer follow-up. Also, studies indicated that length of adiposity was positively associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.38 39\nIn the analyses of body mass index and waist circumference, a stratified analysis based on the method of case ascertainment indicated significant differences between subgroups, where studies that performed blood glucose measurements reported weaker associations than those that used selfreported methods or medical registries (P for subgroup difference=0.01 and <0.001 for waist circumference\nand body mass index, respectively). Direct blood glucose measurement is probably a more reliable method for case ascertainment, but this method is difficult to perform in large scale population based cohort studies. About 60% of the studies included in the analyses of body mass index and waist circumference used a combination of methods for case ascertainment, and the main findings were close to those reported in these subgroups (1.72 v 1.68 for body mass index and 1.61 v 1.57 for waist circumference).\nStudies suggested evidence of a substantial effect modification by age in the association between adiposity and morbidity and mortality.40 41 In general, the harmful effects of adiposity are more evident in young adults, and excess mortality associated with obesity decreases along with the increase in age across levels of obesity, in a way that older adults might benefit from being overweight.32 42 Our results also indicated that the association between body mass index and type 2 diabetes was significantly stronger in adults younger than 30 years than in those older than 60 years (P for subgroup difference <0.001. Although originally planned in our protocol, we could not perform more efficient subgroup analyses by age.\nIn the analysis of body mass index, heterogeneity existed when we stratified studies based on how frequently the exposure was assessed, where studies with repeated assessments during follow-up indicated weaker associations compared with studies that performed one baseline measurement. One baseline measurement of exposures did not consider potential changes in the level of exposure over time and is one of the main limitations of epidemiological studies that could result in measurement errors and non-differential misclassification.43 Repeated measurements can probably provide more reliable measurements and thus can give a more precise estimation of the associations, but we did not find significant differences between subgroups in the analyses of other measures.\nWe performed an additional meta-analysis to compare the associations across different measures. The results indicated that body adiposity index, an alternative calculation representing an indirect estimate of body fat content, had a stronger association with the risk of type 2 diabetes compared with other measures. Body adiposity index integrates height and hip circumference to estimate the amount of body fat.44 We also found a strong association for percentage body fat. Of the six studies included in the analysis of percentage body fat, four used bioelectrical impedance analysis, one used hydrodensitometry (alternative method representing an indirect estimate of body fat content), and one study used dual energy x ray absorptiometry (the gold standard for measuring body composition) to predict percentage body fat.\nAmong conventional measures, we found a stronger association for waist-to-height ratio than waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index. This finding was consistent with previous reviews indicating that waist-to-height ratio is better\nP rotected by copyright.\non 25 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T echnology P atna (IIT P atna). http://w w w .bm j.com\nM J: first published as 10.1136/bm j-2021-067516 on 18 January 2022.

Marked differences existed across measures in terms of the number of studies included in each analysis, geographical location, study population, length of follow-up, and degree of statistical control, however, and thus our conclusions on the superiority of some measures should be interpreted cautiously and allowing for these limitations.\nClinical and public health implications Ours was a comprehensive study of the association between adiposity and the risk of type 2 diabetes across the world. Our findings indicated a strong positive linear association between body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Current recommendations from the World Health Organization suggest a threshold of 27.5 for body mass index to define obesity and start lifestyle interventions in populations in the Far East and Chinese populations,46 which was equivalent in risk to a body mass index of 30 in white individuals. Using a rigorous analytical method and performing a large meta-analysis of cohort studies, we found a strong positive linear association between body mass index and type 2 diabetes across the whole range of body mass index values.\nWe included several measures representing regional distribution of body fat. The results indicated a strong positive linear association across the whole range of waist circumference values in different regions, ethnicities, and in both sexes. We also included more objective measures of body fat content that confirmed current knowledge about the harmful effects of adiposity on human health. Allowing for limitations, such as different populations and different numbers of studies, our analysis compared the associations across different anthropometric indicators.\nWe considered the proposed limitations of conventional anthropometric measures, including body mass index (inability to distinguish lean mass from fat mass), waist circumference (strong correlation with body mass index), and waist-to-hip ratio (difficulty in measuring hip circumference) in presenting our comprehensive perspective of the association between important anthropometric indicators and the risk of type 2 diabetes. We also excluded cohort studies that used self-reported anthropometric measures as exposures. Systematic errors in self-reported weight and height have been reported,47 leading to misclassification and thus an upward bias in the magnitude of the effect estimates.48 49 By using cohort studies that measured anthropometric data, we presented a more accurate estimation of the associations."

We performed several predefined and post hoc subgroup analyses to present the results across subgroups and find the sources of heterogeneity, but extreme heterogeneity persisted in the subgroups. We\npresent several explanations for the large heterogeneity in the data.\nFirstly, we included a large number of studies in the analyses, especially for body mass index and waist circumference. In such cases, high heterogeneity is inevitable, and even a small difference in effect estimates can lead to high heterogeneity in the data.50 Secondly, all studies included in our review were consistent in terms of the PICOS (population, intervention or exposure, comparator, outcome, and study design) framework.51 Therefore, the heterogeneity seen in the data was statistical heterogeneity rather than clinical or methodological heterogeneity.\nThirdly, the large heterogeneity in the data was mainly because of the difference in the magnitude (weak, moderate, or strong) of the effect sizes rather than a difference in the direction (positive or inverse) of the associations. Of 182 studies included in the analysis of body mass index, 178 reported positive associations. Of 78 studies included in the analysis of waist circumference, all reported positive associations. This consistency in the results was also reported for waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and visceral adiposity index. Consistency was strong across the studies in terms of the direction of the associations. According to the GRADE approach, reviewers should differentiate between situations where the large inconsistency across studies is caused by differences in the magnitude of the associations rather than differences in the direction of the associations.52 Because individual studies were in the same direction, performing meta-analyses is still thought to be appropriate.53 54\nWe performed several prespecified and post hoc subgroup analyses to find the potential sources of the heterogeneity. Because of the large number of studies, however, large variations in participant and study characteristics within each subgroup persisted."

Secondly, we had insufficient data for the analysis of healthy individuals. Primary cohort studies used different definitions to specify healthy individuals and thus more research might be required in healthy individuals. We also had insufficient data for never smokers and for some subgroups, such as South America, Africa, and black individuals. Thirdly, studies published in non-English journals were not included because of resource constraints, which might cause selection bias. Given the large number of studies included in the analyses, especially for body mass index and waist circumference, however, inclusion of studies in non-English journals would probably not have changed the results substantially. Fourthly, of 216 studies included in the analyses, only a quarter performed repeated anthropometric measurements during the follow-up period. Analysis of body mass index indicated a weaker association in studies that performed repeated versus baseline anthropometric measurements. This finding should be considered in future studies evaluating the associations between obesity and morbidity. Fifthly, we did not include fat mass in specific regions, such as liver, muscle, and abdominal fat mass, in our review. Future research should evaluate the association between body fat content in specific regions and the risk of diabetes risk in more detail. Finally, because of the observational design of the studies, residual confounding cannot be excluded and should be considered when interpreting the results. Recent mendelian randomisation studies, however, suggested a casual effect of general and central adiposity on the risk of type 2 diabetes.55 56"
