    "abstractText": "Phase current reconstruction (PCR) strategy can improve the fault tolerance of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. The PCR precision is largely affected by the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors. The upper limit (Tlimit) of PCR allowable range can reflect the requirement of different PCR methods for the minimum sampling time (Tmin). With a longer Tlimit, there is sufficient time for sampling, even if Tlimit is halved due to the symmetrical waveform. Therefore, the extension of Tlimit is the key to eliminate the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors. In this paper, a method to increase Tlimit is proposed, which introduces the suitable auxiliary vectors (AVs) in different regions to extend the duration time of the sampling vectors. With the help of a longer Tlimit (12.5%Ts), it\u2019s possible to eliminate all the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors, relieve the pressure on the hardware of current loop, improve the sampling accuracy, and facilitate the reliable operation of the drive. Besides, the switching action times of IGBTs can be reduced by about one-third in the high modulation area. The proposed method is finally proved to accurately reconstruct the phase currents by the experimental results on the PMSM prototype.",

The PCR precision is largely affected by the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors. The upper limit (Tlimit) of PCR allowable range can reflect the requirement of different PCR methods for the minimum sampling time (Tmin). With a longer Tlimit, there is sufficient time for sampling, even if Tlimit is halved due to the symmetrical waveform. Therefore, the extension of Tlimit is the key to eliminate the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors. In this paper, a method to increase Tlimit is proposed, which introduces the suitable auxiliary vectors (AVs) in different regions to extend the duration time of the sampling vectors. With the help of a longer Tlimit (12.5%Ts), it\u2019s possible to eliminate all the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors, relieve the pressure on the hardware of current loop, improve the sampling accuracy, and facilitate the reliable operation of the drive.

For the propose of improving the fault tolerance and reducing cost, the phase current reconstruction (PCR) strategy with a DC-link current sensor has been studied.\nIn the PCR technology, feedback currents are reconstructed by extracting the DC-link current when sampling vectors (SVs) are acting. However, there are mainly two factors that cause degradation of the reconstruction currents accuracy in this extraction process.\nThe first factor is that the actual DC-link current cannot follow the applied SV as immediately as the ideal one, which is illustrated in the middle of Fig. 1(a). To sample effectively, the duration time of SVs must exceed a minimum sampling time (Tmin) [13] that depends on the hardware of the current loop, which can be expressed as min dead delay sett ADT T T T T= + + + (1)\nwhere Tdead is the dead time for the pass-through protection which is provided by the driver board, Tdelay is the delay time of IGBTs to turn-on or turn-off, Tsett is the settling time which is mainly determined by the motor inductance and also affected by the sampling process, and TAD is the sum of sampling time and A/D conversion time which depends on the controller.\nIn the maximum modulation circle, the areas that fail to be accurately reconstructed are called unmeasurable zones. The upper limit of PCR allowable range is defined as Tlimit, which can reflect the requirement of different PCR methods for Tmin. Tmin must be less than Tlimit, otherwise, the modulation area will be reduced. Therefore, both decreasing Tmin and increasing Tlimit can avoid unmeasurable zones. The limit factors of decreasing Tmin are shown in Fig. 1(a). First, the pass-through protection time of the driver board requires a strict design for decreasing Tdead, but insufficient protection time might cause a short circuit of the inverter. Then, the inverter must have higher performance requirements to reduce Tdelay, such as the faster turn-on and turn-off time. Moreover, to shorten Tsett, a higher bandwidth current sensor is required to measure current signals, and the current sampling board is also designed to shorten delay time, accelerate response, and reduce interference. Finally, to decrease TAD, the performance of controller needs to be improved, and the sampling time should be shortened. As is mentioned above, shrinking Tmin cannot eliminate all the unmeasurable zones but increases the cost and design difficulty of the hardware. Therefore, enlarging Tlimit might be a useful method to eliminate the unmeasurable zones.\nTo find a method to expand Tlimit, various advanced PCR\nP\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of York.

            "text": "methods [10]-[29] are discussed. By using the different observers, the current in the unmeasurable zones can be estimated in literature [10]-[12]. However, this method fails in the low modulation area due to the lack of two-phase current information at the same time, and the unmeasurable zones still exist in the maximum modulation circle. To accurately measure rather than estimate the current in unmeasurable zones, various advanced methods [13]-[29] have been proposed, which can be generally divided into two categories according to the location of the current sensor. In the first method, the current sensor is uninstalled at the DC-link side [13]-[18], and the DC-link current corresponding to the voltage vector must be changed. Although changing the position of the sensor is flexible and simple, the unmeasurable zones may just be transferred to other positions in the maximum modulation circle, i.e., the unmeasurable zones might not be eliminated and Tlimit is equal to zero. To turn things around, the second method is put forward to modify the seven-segment space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm with a single DC-link current sensor [19]-[29], where three typical examples are shown in Fig. 1(b). By inserting three SVs that are added up to zero, literature [19] and [20] eliminate the unmeasurable zones in the maximum modulation circle, and Tlimit probably does not exceed 4%Ts. Works [21]-[26] move the pulse width modulation (PWM) waveforms without changing the duty cycle to obtain enough sampling time. These methods also have different and strict constraints on Tmin. And Tlimit is stipulated in literature [22], which is 3.5%Ts approximately. The hybrid SVPWM methods are raised in [27]-[29], which compensate for the duration time of SVs by introducing new vectors. In [28], a method adopts correspondingly comprehensive strategies for reference voltage vectors (Vref). However, there may still be some stubborn\nunmeasurable zones in the low modulation area, which leads to inaccurate sampling. In [29], the problem of unmeasurable zones is addressed by an independent current reconstruction strategy without null switching states, leading to an independence of PCR. But the modulation area may be reduced as Tmin increases. Therefore, modifying the algorithm seems to be the valid way to increase Tlimit.\nThe second factor is that the three-phase currents cannot be simultaneously obtained with one single current sensor, which introduces the time-sharing sampling errors [30]. These errors cause current waveform fluctuations similar to offset jitter, resulting in the waveform distortion shown in [31]. Unfortunately, the time-sharing sampling errors cannot be compensated by a constant value, because they are related to the current slope, the voltage vector, and its duration time. Assuming that the current slopes are identical under the same vector in the same PWM cycle [36], the symmetrical sampling method using symmetrical PWM waves can eliminate these errors simply and effectively. However, owing to the harsh Tlimit, it is difficult to generate symmetrical PWM waves while ensuring sufficient duration time for SV. The current prediction method is often selected in [30]-[37], even if the variable parameters affect the prediction results and the computational burden is heavy.\nBased on the above analysis, the extension of Tlimit is the key to eliminate all the unmeasurable zones in the maximum modulation circle and time-sharing sampling errors by the symmetrical sampling method. Fig. 1(b) shows the cause of unmeasurable zones in the low modulation of sector I and the methods of increasing Tlimit. Tlimit is determined by the algorithm in the controller, including PCR algorithm and carrier frequency. Although Tlimit can be enlarged by modifying the SVPWM algorithm in the above-mentioned method, Tlimit cannot exceed 4%Ts without affecting the maximum modulation circle. The harsh Tlimit makes it difficult to generate symmetrical PWM waves. Meanwhile, to ensure the reliable current sampling, Tmin is set as 5 us [15]. With the carrier frequency of 10kHz, there are still unmeasurable zones within the maximum modulation circle. Decreasing carrier frequency is another method to expand Tlimit. When Tlimit is not equal to zero, with the decrease of the carrier frequency, Tlimit increases appropriately, but the waveform is distorted and the operation of PMSM is affected. Thus, it is necessary to bring forward a method with a longer Tlimit. As well as reducing the burden on the hardware circuit, a simple symmetrical sampling method can also be used to eliminate the time-sharing sampling errors.\nAiming at expanding Tlimit, a method is proposed in this paper, which introduces different auxiliary vectors (AVs) for prolonging the duration time of SVs. With the help of a larger Tlimit, it is possible to generate symmetrical PWM waves, thereby simply eliminating time-sharing sampling errors by the symmetrical sampling method. Moreover, a longer Tlimit (12.5%Ts) allows to relieve the pressure on the hardware of current loop, produce a more stable current waveform during sampling, and improve the sampling accuracy by multiple sampling. Besides, the switching times of IGBTs can be reduced by about one-third in the high modulation area.\nThis article is organized as follows.

            "text": "Eight basic voltage vectors of the inverter are defined as two zero vectors: V000 (V0), V111 (V7), and six active vectors: V100 (V1), V110 (V2), V010 (V3), V011 (V4), V001 (V5), V101 (V6). The DC-link current (iDC) is related to the three-phase currents (ia, ib, and ic) in different switching states [23]. The sum of the three-phase currents is 0, so at least two SVs are indispensable for obtaining the three-phase currents with a DC-link current sensor in each PWM cycle. Furthermore, it is necessary to introduce one or more basic vectors to assist in the synthesis of Vref.\nTaking Fig. 1(b) as an example, each segment duration time of SVs (TV1, TV2) is shorter than Tmin. The reconstruction currents (ia, ib) cannot be accurately sampled, therefore, modifying the SVPWM algorithm is proposed to eliminate the unmeasurable zones. Three typical examples in Fig. 1(b) are analyzed in detail. Literature [19] introduced three SVs whose sum is 0, and the three-phase currents are thus obtained. Two sets of vector pairs V1 and V4, V2 and V5 with opposite directions are used to replaced part of the zero vectors in [22]. Literature [29] uses V2, V4 and V6 to replace all zero vectors. In the maximum modulation area, the duration time of shortest SV is equal to Tlimit, so extending the duration time of SVs is the key to extend Tlimit. The above three typical examples essentially replace part or all of the zero vectors by adding active vectors to extend Tlimit. In this paper, the active vectors are used as AVs to replace all the zero vectors, meanwhile, the two adjacent vectors of each sector are specified as SVs, which can guarantee the longest duration time of SVs.\nB. Influence of AVs on Output Vector Area\nThe introduction of AVs is regarded as an important method to reduce the unmeasurable zones, i.e., superimposing different AVs can eliminate the unmeasurable zones of a specific part. To expand Tlimit, the features of AVs are studied. The addition of different AVs has a special effect on VS generated by SVs. If the angle between AV and VS is less than \u03c0/2, the length of VS will increase theoretically, and the angle will shift to the boundary of the sector. Similarly, if this angle is between \u03c0/2 and \u03c0, the length of VS will shorten and the angle will shift to the boundary or low modulation area.\nCombining the above analysis, the output vector area after introducing different AVs in sector \u2160 is represented in Fig. 2, where SVs adjacent to sector \u2160 are V1 and V2. Sector \u2160 is divided into two parts by its angle bisector l0, and the angle between the upper part and V3 is less than \u03c0/2. Under the influence of V3, the output vector area expands in the boundary area of high modulation, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The angle between the upper part and V4 is more than \u03c0/2. Under the influence of V4, the output vector area expands towards the boundary area of low modulation, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Similarly, V5 and V6 have the same effect as above on the lower part of the area.\nIdeally, the output vector area is the largest. And as Tmin\nincreases, the area shrinks. It can be clearly illustrated from Fig. 2. When there is a fixed Tmin, the output vector area is reduced by a certain percentage. To generate symmetrical PWM waves, each duration time of SVs must be greater than 2Tmin. With this limit, the output vector area is further reduced. However, it can still guarantee that there remains no unmeasurable zone with the increase of Tmin in some specific areas. In order to expand Tlimit, the sector is divided into different regions in the proposed method, and the different AV is used in the different region.\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 2(b), as long as Tmin exists, there must be unmeasurable zones in the low modulation area. Therefore, two AVs (V4, V5) are introduced at the same time, and an output area appears, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Both form two vectors paired with SVs in the opposite directions, i.e., (V1, V4) and (V2, V5). It is stipulated that TV1, TV2, TV4, and TV5 represent the duration of V1, V2, V4, and V5. However, the output vector is only related to the values of TV1 minus TV4 and TV2 minus TV5, resulting in a non-unique synthesis method. To solve this problem, the duration of two vector pairs is specified by 0.5Ts. And the output voltage area is shown in Fig. 3(b). The constraints can achieve a more balanced duration time of SVs and AVs, which can benefit the stability of motor control and ease the computational burden. Meanwhile, as long as Tmin does not exceed 25%Ts, it can be guaranteed that there is no unmeasurable zone in the low modulation area, and the addition of restriction conditions has no effect on this range."

PROPOSED PCR SCHEME WITH DIFFERENT AVS\nA harsh Tlimit raises the higher performance requirements on PMSM drive systems. Meanwhile, Tlimit limits the generation of symmetrical PWM waves, which makes it unfeasible to use the simple symmetrical sampling method to eliminate the time-sharing sampling errors. To extend Tlimit, a method with different AVs is proposed to divide each sector into five regions, which is described in detail in this Section."

V1 and V2 are called SVs, and V3 to V6 are named AVs. The AVs of region 1 are V4 and V5, and Vref' in region 2 or 3 can be synthesized by introducing V5 or V4. Likewise, V6 or V3 are used to synthesize Vref' of region 4 or 5.\nThe generation of symmetrical PWM wave leads to the reduction of Tlimit. To extend Tlimit as much as possible while generating symmetrical waves, a one-time SV (OSV) is placed in the middle of the waveform, and a two-time SV (TSV) is divided into two parts on both sides of OSV. AV, OSV, TSV corresponding to regions 1 to 5 are illustrated in TABLE \u2161.\nTo ensure the accuracy of sampling, the duration time of OSV and TSV must be longer than Tmin and 2Tmin respectively. And the total durations of the vectors are equal to Ts. According to Part B of Section \u2161, the durations of two vector pairs are specified by 0.5Ts. TV1 and TV2 are also required to surpass 2Tmin simultaneously to produce a symmetrical output voltage area for dealing with their nondistinctive correspondence to OSV and\nTSV. The sum of output voltage areas of five regions is displayed in Fig. 4(b).\nGenerally, to ensure the smooth operation of the motor, Vref falls into the maximum modulation circle, i.e., the inscribed circle of the regular hexagon. Therefore, if these two triangular areas are outside the maximum modulation circle, the stable operation of the motor cannot be affected.\nThe modulation area is divided into three parts, and the boundaries from the inside to the outside are named as low, medium, and high modulation circles, as shown in Fig. 4(b), where the high modulation circle is identical with the maximum one. In Fig. 5, the radius of the circle in low, medium, and high modulation areas are |Oa|, |Ob|, and |Oc| respectively, and a Cartesian coordinate system is created.\nThe equation of the lines l0, l1, l2, l3 and l4 can be easily\nobtained as follows:\n0 : 3l y x= (2) 1 s min: 2l x T T= + (3)\n2 s min: 3 3 3 3 2 3 3l y x T T= \u2212 + + (4)\n3 min: 3l y T= (5)\n4 min: 3 2 3l y x T= \u2212 (6) Combining the above equations of (3) to (6), the coordinates\nof points a and b can be obtained.

Using the proposed method, the PWM signals of Vref' in five regions are shown in Fig. 6(a)-(e), which eliminate previously unmeasurable zones. Through the waveform relationship of each sector in TABLE \u2163, combined with the number of the sector, the PWM waveform can be converted to the sector where Vref falls, where the negative sign (\u2212) represents the complementary waveform and x represents the number of regions."

Three sampling points are required in one PWM cycle, including two symmetrical sampling points under the duration time of TSV, and a midpoint under the duration time of OSV. The effects of random errors can be mitigated by continuous sampling m (m>1) times at each sampling point. Suppose the carrier frequency is fc, and the sampling frequency is 3mfc. The\ntime-sharing sampling errors could be eliminated by generating the symmetrical PWM waves and replacing the current at the intermediate moment with the average current under the symmetrical duration of TSV. The location and information of the current sampling points are explicitly shown in Fig. 6. Although the symmetrical sampling points change with the values of T2 and T3, the calculation method of PWM comparison value is simple and fixed, i.e., (T2+T3)/2.\nIn Part C of Section II, to convert Vref to Vref', sector s can coincide with sector I by rotating (s-1)\u03c0/3 clockwise. Therefore, to converse Vref' back to Vref, SVs need to rotate counter clockwise by (s-1)\u03c0/3. For example, when Vref is located in region 3 of sector II, OSV (ia) and TSV (-ic) need to rotate \u03c0/3 counter clockwise, corresponding to -ic and ib respectively.\nIV.

            "text": "1) Switching frequency of inverter The switching frequency of inverter is described by the upper bridge arm IGBT switching frequency. Each branch has a different switching frequency, depending on the position of Vref. Compared with the seven-segment SVPWM method, one of the three branches switches twice in one PWM cycle of low modulation area, and one branch does not switch in one PWM cycle of high modulation area. Besides, when the sector or region changes, the switching state of a branch may get changed, leading to an increase in the number of switches. The number of additional switches in each branch is related to the speed and modulation area of the motor. The power frequency of motor is f=np/60, where n is the motor speed, and p is the number of motor pole pairs. In one electrical period, each branch is switched one, three and five extra times in low, medium, and high modulation areas, respectively. The switching frequencies of three modulation areas are shown in the TABLE V.\nCompared with the traditional method, the switching times of IGBTs increase a lot in low modulation area. Since the motor system is usually designed to work in medium or high modulation area, this algorithm is acceptable. 2) Current ripple in capacitor\nThe current ripple in the capacitor can be reflected by the DC-link current. In the seven-segment SVPWM method, the DC-link current is zero under the duration time of V0 and V7. Especially in the low modulation area (longer action time of zero vector), the DC-link current ripple is small. However, the zero vector of the proposed method is synthesized through the active vectors. The currents are opposite to each other when the vectors act in opposite directions, therefore, a large DC-link current fluctuation must be generated with the long duration time of zero vector compared with the traditional method.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed PCR scheme with different AVs, an experiment platform is set up, which is shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9(a), the power source component is supplied by the AC grid through an isolated transformer and then converted to the DC voltage source (220 V) by using a rectifier. The driver is supplied with a rectifier and a DC-link capacitor. A controller, a sampling board, an inverter, and a drive board are used in the control platform to complete the closed-loop control of the motor drive. The controller (DSP TMS320F28379D) receives the feedback information from the sampling board and resolver decoder, and produces drive signals to the drive boards of the inverter. The DC-link current sensor (LA 25-P) is installed on the sampling board. The drive unit adopts the Infineon IGBT module (FS100R12KT4), which generates the same switching frequency (10 kHz) as that by the PWM carrier.

The DSP is used to obtain the DAC signals, which can produce three DACs at the same time. The output signal of DAC and the input signal of the oscilloscope in Fig. 9(b) are just for illustration, and the output of different signals depends on different experiments.\nFig. 10 shows the PWM signals of different sectors of each modulation area. The information of sector and region are marked in Fig. 10, and SA, SB, and SC are the signals that control the action of the upper power switches of the three bridge arms. Fig. 10(a) shows the PWM signals when the Vref falls into the low modulation area (x=1). One cycle of each sector is extracted and amplified to verify the correctness of the PWM signals. Fig. 10(b) shows the PWM signals in the middle vector area (x=2 or 3). Similarly, a PWM cycle of different regions in each sector is enlarged and displaced, verifying the correctness of the results. Fig. 10(c) shows the PWM signals in the high modulation area (x=4 or 5), and the result of two-fold magnification of the signal SA is shown in this figure as well. Compared with the traditional SVPWM algorithm, the switching times are reduced by about one-third in the high modulation area.\nTo verify the correctness and feasibility of proposed PCR method with different carrier frequencies application, the actual and reconstructed currents of the motor with higher 10 kHz and\nlower 5 kHz carrier frequencies are recorded, respectively. The current measurement methods are shown in Fig. 8(b), where the actual currents (ia_A, ib_A, ic_A) of the motor are measured by the current clamps, and the reconstructed ones (ia_R, ib_R, ic_R) in the DSP are output by the DAC. The waveforms of ia_A, ib_A, ic_A and ia_R, ib_R, ic_R are consistent. The results are shown in Fig. 11, where the motor speed is 850 r/min under the rated loads. The carrier frequencies of Fig. 11(a) and 11(b) are 10 kHz and 5 kHz, respectively. The current ripple in Fig. 11(a) is smaller, and the voltage utilization in Fig. 11(b) is higher. Reducing the switching frequency does not affect the reconstruction accuracy.\nThe actual driving performance is affected by the accuracy of the reconstructed currents and the fluctuation of the motor speed. To explore the effect of the errors between the measured and reconstructed currents on the drive performance under different loading conditions, the actual midpoint current (ia_M) and reconstructed current (ia_R) of phase A are compared under no, half, and rated loading conditions. The errors current (ierorrs) and motor speed are obtained, as shown in (a), (b), and (c) of Fig. 12, respectively.

These errors do not have significant impact on the actual drive performance at different loading conditions. The proposed method has no unmeasurable zones in the maximum modulation area. ierrors is generated by the measurement errors of current sensor and the sampling errors of current sampling hardware circuit. Besides, these errors may be introduced through the DAC output, therefore, ierrors may be smaller than the\none calculated above, and ia_R which is used for closed-loop control may be more precise. Compared with the first method of PCR [13]-[18], although the accuracy of the proposed method is slightly lower, the wiring of this method is simpler and the modulation area does not reduce. Compared with the second method [19]-[29], the proposed method prolongs the duration time of SVs and weakens the influence of time-sharing sampling errors, which hash higher reconstruction accuracy.\nWhen the vector falls into region 1 of sector \u2160 and has a value close to 0, the actual DC-link current (iDC_A) and the actual three-phase currents (ia_A, ib_A, ic_A) are shown in Fig. 13. The current waveforms of one PWM cycle are marked with the yellowish shadowed area, where the AVs (V011, V001) and SVs (V100, V110) are used. When TSV (V100) is generated, current samplings are performed on TSP1 and TSP2; when OSV (V110) is generated, one sampling is performed on OSP. The average of ITSP1 and ITSP2 (ia_R) is used to estimate the midpoint current ia_A, IOSP (-ic_R) is used to estimate the midpoint current ic_A, and ib_R is reconstructed by ia_R and ic_R. Compared with the traditional single-point sampling method, the errors of the two methods are shown in TABLE VII. The sampling method of symmetrical points is simple and effective to eliminate the time-sharing sampling errors. In addition, the duration time of the SVs is greater than one-eighth of the cycle, and the DC-link current at the sampling point is relatively stable.\nTo verify the effect of the proposed method at low speeds, the target speed is set to vary between 50 rpm and 200 rpm (rated speed 2000 rpm). The waveforms of ia_A and speed under different load conditions are given in Fig. 14, where the load is applied at 200 rpm. The motor can run stably at low speed.

The sample standard deviation (SD) is used to measure the magnitude of the ripple. In the low modulation area, the SD of iDC_R and iDC_T is 2.1530 A and 0.9828 A, respectively. In the medium modulation area, the SD of iDC_R and iDC_T is 2.3094 A and 1.5265 A, respectively. In the high modulation area, the SD of iDC_R and iDC_T is 1.1652 A and 1.2933 A, respectively. Larger ripples are generated in low and middle modulation areas with AVs instead of zero vectors. The ripple in the high modulation area is attenuated with AVs.\nTo compare the efficiency value of the proposed method, the seven-segment SVPWM without AV is chosen. Under the same working conditions, the output power of two methods is equal, and their input power can reflect the difference in efficiency. Therefore, a DC power supply can be used to compare the efficiency of the two methods. The motor is controlled under the same working conditions by two methods, respectively. The output current of the DC power supply is recorded, and the efficiency of the two methods is compared with the output current. The DC power supply provides 310 V DC, and the motor speed in the low, medium and high modulation area is 500, 1000, and 2000 rpm, respectively. The output current of the seven-segment SVPWM method is 0.594 A, 1.386 A, and 2.631 A in the low, medium, and high modulation areas, respectively. The output current of the proposed method is 0.683 A, 1.452 A, and 2.621 A in the low, medium, and high modulation areas, respectively. Because the number of switching times in the low or middle modulation area is larger, the method with AVs is less efficient. However, in the high modulation area, the proposed PCR method of introducing AVs instead of zero vectors is more efficient than the seven-segment SVPWM method.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nTo eliminate the unmeasurable zones, Tmin must be shorter than a harsh Tlimit, which raises the higher performance requirements on PMSM drive systems. Meanwhile, a shorter Tlimit limits the generation of symmetrical PWM waves, which makes it unfeasible to use the symmetrical sampling method to eliminate the time-sharing sampling errors. Therefore, the extension of Tlimit is the key to eliminate the unmeasurable zones and time-sharing sampling errors. To extend Tlimit, a method is proposed which adopts different AVs for prolonging the duration time of SVs in different regions. The following merits are obtained. 1) A longer Tlimit (12.5%Ts) allows to relieve the pressure on\nthe hardware of current loop, produces a more stable current waveform during sampling, and improve the sampling accuracy by multiple sampling. 2) The time-sharing sampling errors can be simply eliminated by generating a symmetrical PWM waveform, which can effectively prevent the distortion of the reconstructed current waveforms. 3) The switching times of the inverter can be reduced in the high modulation area, which could greatly reduce the losses of the inverter.\nIn conclusion, the presented method provides a new solution by modifying the SVPWM algorithm for the PCR technology."
