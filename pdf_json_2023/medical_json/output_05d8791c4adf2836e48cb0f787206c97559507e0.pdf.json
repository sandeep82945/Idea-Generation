    "abstractText": "Background and purpose: Brain function can be networked, and these networks typically present drastic changes after having suffered a stroke. The objective of this systematic review was to compare EEG-related outcomes in adults with stroke and healthy individuals with a complex network approach. Methods: The literature search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane and ScienceDirect from their inception until October 2021. Results: Ten studies were selected, nine of which were cohort studies. Five of them were of good quality, whereas four were of fair quality. Six studies showed a low risk of bias, whereas the other three studies presented a moderate risk of bias. In the network analysis, different parameters such as the path length, cluster coefficient, small-world index, cohesion and functional connection were used. The effect size was small and not significant in favor of the group of healthy subjects (Hedges\u2019g = 0.189 [\u22120.714, 1.093], Z = 0.582, p = 0.592). Conclusions: The systematic review found that there are structural differences between the brain network of post-stroke patients and healthy individuals as well as similarities. However, there was no specific distribution network to allows us to differentiate them and, therefore, more specialized and integrated studies are needed.",

            "text": "Stroke represents one of the most common causes of disability with regards to its impact on functional limitations [1]. In addition, because of the aging population, the absolute number of strokes is expected to increase in the coming years [2]. Apart from the positive and negative clinical features that may appear after a stroke, this type of neural lesion is typically associated with alterations in the oscillatory brain activity that can be measured from the lesioned areas in the brain. Typically, lesioned brain regions present a slowing of rhythmic activity as compared to the contralesional side. This can be observed by computing the ratio between the power at low frequency (e.g., delta) and high frequency (alpha/beta/gamma) of spectral components in the EEG [3] Brain connectivity\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 666. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11050666 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 666 2 of 19\nalso undergoes changes, and this has been researched during the last years [4\u201313]. At present, we mainly rely on structural images of the brain affected areas to take clinical decisions and make predictions about evolution. Brain networks are a relevant feature of brain function, and these networks typically present drastic changes after a certain region gets damaged. Taking all this into account, network analysis can help to improve the clinical characterization of patients with a stroke, since brain networks determine which areas of the brain are physically or functionally connected to support cognitive and behavioral functions during the brain\u2019s rest/default state [14]. A \u201csmall-world index\u201d (SW) network reproduces the competence of the brain networks to locally and globally process the flow of information [15]. In this regard, through the analysis of EEG graphs, it has been shown that ischemic stroke leads to a rearrangement of the information flow between the two hemispheres in the brain, which is frequency-dependent [13]. Regarding the interest in this field, the number of articles with the \u2018Brain Network\u2019 keyword has grown very fast since 1985, and this interest has increased exponentially in the last years, from 8387 research manuscripts published in 2016 to 14,256 in 2021 in Pubmed. Studies on network topology highlight functional reorganization after stroke [16,17], suggesting that changes in the spontaneous functional architecture of the brain connectivity affecting function could be produced by ischemic lesions [18]. The complexity of functional brain connectivity can be studied using graph theory, a mathematical approach used to analyze networks that may be used to analyze the brain\u2019s complex networks through simplified schemes of nodes and edges [19]. In this field, a network is a mathematical representation of a complex system in the real world and is defined by a set of nodes (vertices) and links (edges) between pairs of nodes. Different parameters define the properties of a network, each of which defines the network in some way. These parameters are used for network analysis and comparison between networks created from healthy humans and stroke patients. Brain network theory considers brain segregation as the network tendency to be organized in clusters and analyzes them using the local and global clustering coefficient (CC). The local CC calculates the local cohesion of a node with its neighbors [20]. Additionally, it provides an overall measure of the cohesion of the nodes in the whole network. The average shortest path length (PL) parameter is also used to analyze brain integration. This parameter represents the network ability to exchange information between distant regions [15\u201319]. The measure of network small-world index (SW) is defined as the ratio between CC and PL [21,22]. The SW coefficient is used to describe the balance between the local connectedness and the global integration of a network. When SW is larger than 1, a network is said to have small-world index properties. SW organization mixes short PL and high CC. The rapid development of imaging technology, such as computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and EEG, allows researchers to access latent knowledge about brain changes during stroke onset and the recovery process [23]. EEG provides a continuous, real-time and non-invasive measurement of brain function and provides new insights into brain pathophysiology after stroke [24\u201326]. This technology has the advantage of being widely available, having a low cost and providing a good compromise in terms of spatio-temporal resolution for superficial structures in the brain. EEG-based measures can provide neurophysiological biomarkers in the early pre-treatment phase that may be used to make short- and long-term predictions regarding the evolution of a patient, and that may even provide relevant information to determine optimal treatment strategies [3]. Moreover, EEG technologies have advanced significantly in recent years, making it possible to record signals unobtrusively without needing to move patients from their beds; it is also possible to test neurofeedback interventions based on the EEG signal and to modulate certain brain rhythms to study its potential therapeutic effect [3,27].\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 666 3 of 19\nIn EEG studies, functional connectivity between two signals can be evaluated by using a measure of general synchronization [28], such as EEG coherence [29]. The increase of EEG coherence can be interpreted as a functional coupling between two anatomically separated regions [30]. In addition, EEG coherence can also be used as a measure of binding by synchrony and is a proposed solution to the connecting problem [31], the way that the brain integrates signals separated in space and time [32]. Stroke leads to a large variability in clinical presentation and outcomes [33]. There is substantial heterogeneity in the procedures and tools used for outcome assessment after stroke, most of which are poorly validated [34]. Consequently, the heterogeneity in the use of outcome tools comprises the data quality [33]. No previous works looked into the brain network changes as an outcome post-stroke. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are not any previous reviews of studies that have carried out brain network analysis of EEG in stroke patients. Because of this, in this systematic review, our objective is to review the research carried out on different stroke areas (Broca, cerebellum, middle cerebral artery, thalamus) and clinical phases (i.e., acute, sub-acute), by networking analysis of EEG and to perform a meta-analysis of the EEG-related outcomes in stroke patients."

Rehabilitation studies, effect of physical therapy and/or effect of any other procedure on stroke were excluded. Two independent reviewers (BA and NC) performed the systematic search and screened the title and abstract of the articles, with duplicates being removed. The full text of eligible papers was carefully read to decide whether the eligibility criteria were met. The two reviewers compared their findings, and a third reviewer (SC) helped to solve any possible discrepancies if needed. After the selected articles were considered suitable for inclusion, one reviewer (BA) extracted the following information: (1) study author(s), (2) year of publication, (3) characteristics of participants (e.g., sample size, study groups, mean age, sex distribution, and types of strokes), (4) type of study, (5) type of method used to measure connectivity between nodes, (6) outcome measures, (7) assessment and intervention protocol and (8) main results. Then, a second reviewer (NC) verified the findings, and possible disagreements were discussed. The Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses [37]. Three factors were considered to score the quality of included studies: (1) selection, including representativeness of the exposed cohort, selection of the non-exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure and demonstration that at the start of the study the outcome of interest was not present; (2) comparability,\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 666 4 of 19\nassessed on the basis of study design and analysis, and whether any confounding variables were adjusted for; and (3) outcome, based on the follow-up period and cohort retention and ascertained by independent blind assessment, record linkage or self-report. The quality of the studies (good, fair and poor) was rated by awarding stars in each domain following the guidelines of the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. A \u201cgood\u201d quality score required 3 or 4 stars in selection, 1 or 2 stars in comparability and 2 or 3 stars in outcomes. A \u201cfair\u201d quality score required 2 stars in selection, 1 or 2 stars in comparability and 2 or 3 stars in outcomes.

            "text": "For the statistical analysis, the program R Ver. 4.1.2 was used (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Welthandelsplatz 1, 1020 Vienna, Austria). In the articles showing the results with median and interquartile range, these were transformed into mean and standard deviation using the appropriate formulas [38,39]. The combination of groups and the average of the means and standard deviations were performed using the appropriate formulas [40]. Data were obtained by request from the authors and, when it was not possible, by extracting data from the graphs available in the articles (since these did not present them in table format) using the webplotdigitizer software [41]. A meta-analysis was carried out taking the small-world index (SW) as measure of brain networks. A random effects model was applied given the heterogeneity between the studies and analyzing the level of significance between the groups of patients and healthy participants through the standardized difference of means (SMD), based on the mean, standard deviation and sample size in each group. Heterogeneity was analyzed by estimating the between-studies variance \u03c42 (calculated with the DerSimonian\u2013Laird estimator with Hartung\u2013Knapp correction), with the Cochran Q test as well as with the I2 estimator being defined with the latter as: 0\u201330%, unimportant heterogeneity; 30\u201350%, moderate heterogeneity; 50\u201375%, large heterogeneity; and 75\u2013100%, significant heterogeneity. The effect size was calculated with Hedges\u2019g, defined as small effect below 0.2, moderate effect between 0.2 and 0.8 and big effect above 0.8. Heterogeneity was assessed by detecting the following: (1) outlier studies, defined as studies with extreme effect sizes whose confidence interval does not overlap with the confidence interval of the pooled effect and differs significantly from the overall effect [42]; and (2) influencing studies, defined as those which have a large impact on the pooled effect or heterogeneity, regardless how high or low the effect is [42]. To analyze heterogeneity, the following were used: (1) influence graphs, which indicate the fit of the studies to the model; (2) Baujat plots, which detect studies that overly contribute to the heterogeneity in a meta-analysis ([43]); and (3) leave-one-out meta-analysis, which are forest plots with recalculated pooled effects, with one study omitted each time. In addition, a Graphic Display of Heterogeneity (GOSH) was used, which plots the pooled effect size on the x-axis and the between-study heterogeneity on the y-axis, which allows for looking for specific patterns or clusters with different effect sizes and amounts of heterogeneity [44]. Subgroup meta-analysis were performed to explore the detected heterogeneity depending on the mode to calculate SW brain networks: direct SW (SW calculated directly), ratio of the raw weighted clustering coefficient (Cw), weighted characteristic path length (Lw) or the ratio of raw global efficiency (Eg) to local efficiency (El). Publication bias was analyzed using the Begg and Eggers tests and standard and trim and fill funnel plots [45]. Finally, the overall and subgroup meta-analysis powers were calculated."

Discussion Studying cortical connectivity changes in stroke can provide novel ways to characterize clinical rehabilitation and suitable therapies for patients with brain lesions leading to cognitive or motor disability. Here, we revise the existing literature supporting the use of EEG-based metrics to analyze brain networks and how they are altered in stroke patients. Despite the identified differences between the studies considered here in terms of recording conditions (e.g., devices or number of channels used) and metrics used to assess cortico-cortical connectivity, it was possible to find a common conclusion in them: the brain network of stroke patients was shown to be different from that of healthy people. These differences were only found in specific frequency bands. For example, there were neither significant differences between post-stroke patients with hemianopia and the healthy controls in the global weighted CC and PL [8] parameters nor in the network rearrangement in alpha 1, beta and gamma bands [13]. In all the studies analyzed, the internal structure of the brain network changed compared to healthy humans. The greatest impact was observed in the affected areas, which showed weaker connections. If we consider delta, theta and alpha bands as low-frequency bands, and assume beta and gamma as high-frequency bands, the functional and topological network in high-frequency bands in patients after an acute stroke show changes [4,5,7,10,12,13]. However, no conclusion can be drawn with certainty about the SW index: in some studies, the patients had a higher SW in different bands [4,12], whereas in others [11], the SW index increased after stroke. However, another study showed that the SW parameter was higher in the control group [7]. It could be expected that healthy patients"

However, no conclusion can be drawn with certainty about the SW index: in some studies, the patients had a higher SW in different bands [4,12], whereas in others [11], the SW index increased after stroke. However, another study showed that the SW parameter was higher in the control group [7]. It could be expected that healthy patients have a higher SW so that transfer data in the brain is done faster from one point to another, following the shortest path length, but this is still unclear, and data obtained in different populations are still controversial. As in the case of the small-world index, no statistically significant differences w r found in indices, such as the shorte t p th length and clust ing coefficient, although recently a case study showed significant changes in these parameters wh n the analysis was performed by dynamic complex network, which shows higher variations in the global\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 666 13 of 19\nclustering coefficient and small-world index and lower variations in the average shortest path length in the low-frequency bands, such as delta, theta and alpha bands, in the chronic stroke patients [49]. Although evidence suggests that connections are less in the brain of post-stroke patients, a model of brain network cannot be clearly considered, or there is not a standard by which patients with stroke can be recognized. However, the immediate EEG changes observed after stroke are a direct consequence of cerebral blood flow reduction that later results in neuronal impairment or neuronal death. This neuronal impairment in turn leads to a disorganization of the electrical activity that is reflected by the global EEG changes [50]. Subsequent neuroplastic changes after stroke have been largely reported [51]. Post-stroke neuroplasticity can lead to reorganization in neural circuits that allow for regaining the lost functionality [52,53]. However, according to our knowledge, there have not been any publications discussing how neuroplasticity after a stroke leads to changes in brain network parameters measured with EEG. Oscillating neural activity in the gamma frequency band is involved in several cognitive functions, including visual object processing [54,55], attention [56,57] and memory [58,59]. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that gamma band activity is strongly associated with behavioral performance in several memory tasks [60,61] and that there is a higher gamma band activity in participants exhibiting superior recognition memory performance [62]. Other findings [63,64] suggest that gamma oscillations not only reflect brain activity related to memory processes, but also vary with the memory ability of individuals. Two of the studies included in the review [5,7] described variation in the gamma band, which could be supported by evidence that suggests that gamma oscillations mediate information transfer between cortical and hippocampal structure for memory abilities [58,59]. With some exceptions, a consensus is reached on how an increase in the slow band frequencies, referred to as slow oscillation and delta oscillation, and is associated with not only the slow-wave sleep state, but also brain ischemia. Conversely, high band frequencies, such as the alpha, beta and gamma oscillations, are associated with wake states or cognitive task engagement, and their presence frequently reduces after stroke. As it was found in one study [10], changes were seen in gamma and beta bands. A possible explanation could be that coherence in higher bands may be more involved in active (either motor or cognitive) tasks [30\u201332]. In our review, differences in EEG signals were observed not only in parameters, but also in different bands. For example, in one study [13], changes were seen in low-frequency bands (delta, theta and alpha2), and no difference was seen in higher-frequency bands (alpha1, beta and gamma), which is consistent with the results of a recent case study [49]. In other studies, changes were seen in alpha [7,9] and theta and beta bands [12]. The changes in the different bands that are seen can be related to the type of stroke, the type of networking of the brain regions, the resting or active state, the examined area of the brain and the age of the patient [65]. Regarding the usefulness of EEG-based connectivity measures to assess brain function in stroke, we found some limitations related to the heterogeneity of the injured areas in the patients participating in the studies included in our meta-analysis. Future studies should include larger samples and grouping patients in terms of the exact locations of their lesions, which would allow us to further understand how the spatial location of a brain lesion affects the rearrangement of brain connections at the local and global scales."
