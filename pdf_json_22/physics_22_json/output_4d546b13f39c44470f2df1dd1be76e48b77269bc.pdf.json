The majority of perovskite materials have the nonpolar CaTiO3\u00f0CTO\u00de structure, limiting the scope of their applications. Based on the effective Hamiltonian model as well as first-principles calculations, we propose a general thin-film design method to stabilize the functional BiFeO3\u00f0BFO\u00de-type structure, which is a common metastable structure in widespread CTO-type perovskite oxides. It is found that the improper antiferroelectricity in CTO-type perovskite and ferroelectricity in BFO-type perovskite have distinct dependences on mechanical and electric boundary conditions, both of which involve oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt. The above difference can be used to stabilize the highly polar BFO-type structure in many CTO-type perovskite materials.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.197601\nABO3 perovskite is an important family of materials that hosts many intriguing physical properties such as ferroelectricity (FE), ferromagnetism, and multiferroicity [1\u20134]. FE is one of the key properties that requires a switchable polar distortion to break the inversion symmetry [5\u20139]. However, in most perovskites, polarity does not occur independently, but is accompanied or induced by primary structural distortions associated with the oxygen octahedral rotations as in the improper FE [10\u201313]. In general, there are two patterns of oxygen octahedral rotations in perovskites. On the one hand, perovskites such as rhombohedral BiFeO3\u00f0BFO\u00de [14], adopt an out-of-phase oxygen octahedral rotation that is compatible with a large polarization. On the other hand, a perovskite such as orthorhombic CaTiO3\u00f0CTO\u00de incorporates an in-phase oxygen octahedral rotation, which gives rise to antipolar distortions with varnishing polarization [15]. Unfortunately, the CTO-type structure dominates the perovskite materials which makes the FE perovskites relatively rare in nature [11]. In perovskites, in-phase and out-of-phase oxygen octa-\nhedral rotations are in strong competition energetically. Under adjustable experimental conditions, the BFO-type structures can be actually stabilized in many CTO-type perovskites [16\u201319], and vice versa [20]. For example, the metastable BFO-type structure has been stabilized in ScFeO3 under applied high pressure and high temperature\n[18]. As another example, it was theoretically proposed that CTO can be stabilized in its BFO-type phase at interfaces in superlattices [19], and the prediction was confirmed by a recent experiment [21]. Notwithstanding the significant progress achieved so far\nin the field, the scope of this progress is very limited. The applied hydrostatic pressure hampers the device application under ambient conditions. Artificial oxide materials based on modern thin-film technology have provided a promising route to stabilize the functional BFO-type structure [8,22\u2013 25] only at interfaces [19,21], not in the bulk of the heterostructures [19]. A general guideline for stabilizing the BFO-type structure over the commonly found CTOtype structure in other perovskites has eluded the community to date [11]. More recently, it has been demonstrated [26] that the competing structural phases in PbTiO3 and BiFeO3 are very sensitive to the applied mechanical and electric boundary conditions. It indicates an alternative route to stabilize the hidden functional structure, which has not been explored so far. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and\npractical design methodology, which stabilizes the functional metastable BFO-type structure in widely spread CTO-type perovskites in nature. This approach is based on proper choices of mechanical and electric boundary conditions via modern thin-film technology [27,28]. We validate the design rule in a prototypical perovskite\n0031-9007=22=128(19)=197601(6) 197601-1 \u00a9 2022 American Physical Society\nCdHfO3 [29,30] by an effective Hamiltonian approach built upon the first-principles calculations, in which the epitaxial strains and electric displacement fields are considered as tunable parameters in experiments. We find that the improper mechanisms underlying the antiferroelectric (AFE) in CTO-type perovskites [29,31,32] and FE in BFO-type perovskites have distinct dependences on its mechanical and electric boundary conditions. With the increased applied tensile strain, the AFE ordering via the trilinear coupling [12,13] in CTO-type structure becomes destabilized much more rapidly than the FE ordering via four-linear coupling in a BFO-type structure [19,33]. On the other hand, the applied electric displacement field promotes the FE ordering in BFO-type structure and destabilizes the AFE in CTO-type structure. Therefore, the combined epitaxial strain and applied electric field can be used to stabilize the metastable BFO-type structure in general CTO-type perovskites. We further demonstrate that such a design scheme can be broadly applied onto many CTO-type perovskites and new room-temperature artificial multiferroic materials can now be designed and synthesized. We start by modeling the energies of the two phases,\nE\u201cCTO\u201d and E\u201cBFO\u201d, respectively, obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A 20-atom ffiffiffi 2 p a \u00d7 ffiffiffi 2 p\na \u00d7 2a supercell is used to accommodate FE, AFE, and oxygen octahedral rotation modes [20], where a represents the pseudocubic lattice constant [34]. We choose CdHfO3 as our prototypical perovskite, which adopts the CTO-type structure at its ground state and the BFO-type structure as the second lowest lying state with energy slightly higher (\u223c10 meV=formula, which is calculated by DFT) than the CTO-type structure. The small energy difference will facilitate the stabilization of its metastable phase by thinfilm technology [35\u201337]. Based on Landau-Devonshire theories [38,39], the effective Hamiltonian models are built upon expanding ECTO and EBFO in terms of structural distortions and their intercoupling terms that are allowed by space group symmetry analysis [19]. The structural distortions in the CTO-type structure [see Fig. 1(d)] are dominated by an in-phase oxygen octahedral rotation around the [001] axis, an out-of-phase oxygen octahedral tilt around [110] axis, and an AFE distortion mode within the AO layer, whose mode amplitudes can be denoted by RI, T , and AFExy respectively. Besides the above optical phonon distortions, the strain occurring in thin-films can be described by the Voigt notation \u03b7i (i \u00bc 1;\u2026; 6), where \u03b71, \u03b72, and \u03b73 are uniaxial strains while \u03b74, \u03b75, and \u03b76 are shear strains. We assume a coherent growth of the perovskite film on a cubic substrate along the [001] direction, which will rule out the presence of any shear strains (\u03b74 \u00bc \u03b75 \u00bc \u03b76 \u00bc 0). As a result, the elastic energies will be reduced from nine to only two degrees of freedom [39], \u03b71 \u00bc \u03b72 \u00bc \u03b7\u0304 and \u03b7z. By taking both structural and strain\ndistortions into account, we will expand the DFT energy of ECTO in CdHfO3 as a function of f\u03b7ig as\nECTO \u00bc \u00bda1RI2 \u00fe b1RI4 \u00fe a2T 2 \u00fe b2T 4 \u00fe c1RI2T 2 ERotCTO \u00fe 1\n2 \u00f02B11\u03b7\u03042 \u00fe B33\u03b72z\u00de \u00fe 2B13\u03b7\u0304\u03b7z \u00fe B12\u03b7\u03042\nEElasCTO\n\u00fe \u00bda3AFExy2 \u00fe b3AFExy4 \u00fe c2RI2AFExy2 \u00fe c3T 2AFExy2 \u00fe d1RIT AFExy E\u00f0A\u00deFECTO\n\u00bc ERotCTO \u00fe EElasCTO \u00fe E\u00f0A\u00deFECTO : \u00f01\u00de\nThe distortions in the BFO-type structure [see Fig. 1(d)] can be characterized by an out-of-phase oxygen octahedral rotation around the [001] axis, an out-of-phase oxygen octahedral tilt around [110] axis, polar distortions along both in-plane ([110]) and out-of-plane ([001]) directions [19]. For convenience, we will use math symbols RO, T , and FEz and FExy to denote the amplitudes of the four distortion modes, respectively. The internal energy of EBFO of the BFO-type structure as a function of f\u03b7ig can be expressed as\n197601-2\nEBFO \u00bc \u00bd\u03b11RO2 \u00fe \u03b21RO4 \u00fe \u03b12T 2 \u00fe \u03b22T 4 \u00fe \u03b31RO2T 2 ERotBFO \u00fe 1\n2 \u00f02B11\u03b7\u03042 \u00fe B33\u03b72z\u00de \u00fe 2B13\u03b7\u0304\u03b7z \u00fe B12\u03b7\u03042\nEElasBFO\n\u00fe \u00bd\u03b13FE2z \u00fe \u03b23FE4z \u00fe \u03b14FE2xy \u00fe \u03b24FE4xy \u00fe \u03b32FE2zFE2xy \u00fe \u03b33RO2FE2z \u00fe \u03b34RO2FE2xy \u00fe \u03b35T 2FE2z \u00fe \u03b36T 2FE2xy \u00fe \u03b41ROT FEzFExy E\u00f0A\u00deFEBFO\n\u00bc ERotBFO \u00fe EElasBFO \u00fe E\u00f0A\u00deFEBFO : \u00f02\u00de\nIn Eqs. (1) and (2), the coefficients of the energy terms such as a\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00de and b\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00de are strain dependent; detailed expressions are shown in the Supplemental Material [40], which includes Refs. [29,41\u201360]. We further group all the energy terms into subcategories according to their physical effects. ERot refers to the energy terms contributed by the oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt as well as their couplings; EElas denotes the elastic energy; E\u00f0A\u00deFE represents the energy contributions associated with electric dipole orderings including both AFE and FE. It should be noted that the trilinear coupling term of d1\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deRIT AFExy of Eq. (1) and the four-linear coupling energy \u03b41\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deROT FEzFExy of Eq. (2) play the key roles in giving rise to improper AFE and improper FE in CTO-type structure [12,13] and BFO-type structure [19,33]. We first explore the stabilities of both BFO-type and\nCTO-type structures in a CdHfO3 film under tunable mechanical boundary conditions. Because of the epitaxial-strain constraint, the most stable phase cannot be determined as the structure that has the lowest unconstrained total energy. Instead, one should compare the free energies FCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de and FBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de in both structures. FCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de and FBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de should be obtained by minimizing ECTO and EBFO under the constraint \u03b71 \u00bc \u03b72 \u00bc \u03b7\u0304, while allowing all the other degrees of freedom to be fully released, as FCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de\u00bcmin\u03b71\u00bc\u03b72\u00bc\u03b7\u0304ECTO\u00f0fRIg;fT g;fAFExyg;f\u03b7zg\u00de and FBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de\u00bcmin\u03b71\u00bc\u03b72\u00bc\u03b7\u0304EBFO\u00f0fROg;fT g;fFExyg;fFEzg; f\u03b7zg\u00de. The relative energy between BFO-type and CTOtype structures can be further evaluated by \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de \u00bc FBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de \u2212 FCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de. If \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de is positive (negative), then the CTO-type (BFO-type) structure is the stable structure under this particular epitaxial strain \u03b7\u0304. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we display the structural phase\ndiagram obtained by both model and direct DFT calculations as a function of epitaxial strain in CdHfO3. As expected, CdHfO3 bulk adopts the CTO-type structure, as evidenced by \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de > 0 when \u03b7\u0304 \u00bc 0. However, \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de quickly drops as the applied strain increases in Fig. 1(a), and both our model and direct DFT calculations predict that the BFO-type structure is stabilized for \u03b7\u0304 > 2.5%. In order to elucidate the physical origins of the stabilized BFO-type structure under tensile epitaxial strains, we further decompose the free energies FCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de, FBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de, as well as \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de\ninto the contribution from oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt \u0394FRot, AFE and its coupling terms \u0394F\u00f0A\u00deFE, as well as the elastic energy \u0394FElas as defined in Eqs. (1) and (2). The resulting decompositions are shown in Figs. 2(a)\u20132(c). Under tensile strain, the overall structural distortions associated with the octahedral octahedron and tilt are decreased in a similar extent for the CTO-type and BFO-type structures, thus their energies FRotCTO and F Rot BFO increase with a similar magnitude. Because of the above, the resulting \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00deRot \u00bc FRotBFO \u2212 FRotCTO is roughly a positive constant value which barely contributes the stabilized BFO-type structure under tensile strain as observed in Fig. 2(a). Similarly, elastic energy does not play a decisive role in stabilizing the BFO-type structure under tensile strain. Both FElasCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de and FFEBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de show a very similar quadratic dispersion under strain, thus \u0394FElas\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de \u00bc FElasBFO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de \u2212 FElasCTO\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de barely changes in Fig. 2(b). Finally, we focus our attention on the energy \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de\u00f0A\u00deFE \u00bc FFEBFO \u2212 FAFECTO, which decreases drastically with the epitaxial strain in Fig. 2(c) and plays a key role in stabilizing the metastable phase. In Fig. 2(c), it is evident that \u0394F\u00f0\u03b7\u0304\u00de\u00f0A\u00deFE is dominated by the trilinear and fourlinear coupling energies. The CTO-type structure rapidly becomes unstable due to the significantly increased d1\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deRIT AFExy term in Eq. (1) but the smaller change of \u03b41\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deROT FEzFExy in Eq. (2). We attribute the distinct dependences of improper AFE (CTO-type) and FE (BFO-type) on epitaxial strains to the very different capabilities in optimizing A-site coordination environments. Woodward et al. [10,61] discovered that the distortions of oxygen atoms in perovskite can be attributed to the optimization of the A-site cation coordination environment, which requires that the number of short A\u2500O interactions be maximized. The strong sensitivity of the trilinear coupling to the epitaxial strain is due to the fact that the in-plane AFE mode is directly coupled to the strain which will stretch or compress the AO bonds along roughly the same direction as schematically shown\n197601-3\nin Fig. 1(d). In contrast, the above scenario is absent in the BFO-type structure, where the improperly induced FE is along the [111] direction, whose A-site coordination is much less sensitive to the epitaxial strain applied within the AO layer as schematically plotted in Fig. 1(d). Besides the epitaxial strain, the electric boundary condition offers another tuning knob to control the stabilities among various competing structures in modern thin-film technology. In order to explore the possibilities for stabilizing the BFO-type structure by the applied electric field, we will choose the electric boundary conditions by constraining electric displacement (D) field along the thin-film growth direction [001] [28,62]. The advantage of the constrained D-field scheme is the energy landscape becomes a single-valued function of the D field, allowing the complete probing of all stable and metastable regions. In many CTO-type perovskites, such as CdHfO3, the FE mode is one of the low-lying instabilities. Therefore, the applied electric field is likely to activate this FE mode and develop its coupling terms in the modeling of ECTO. As such, the additional terms in E\u00f0A\u00deFECTO will be added to the original Eq. (1), the modified equation is shown as Eq. (S1) in the Supplemental Material [40]. Then the enthalpy functions U\u00f0D\u00de under constrained D-field for CTO-type and BFO-type structures can be expressed as modified formulas based on the expressions introduced by Stengel et al. [28,62]. Similarly, under the constraint electric boundary condition, we need to compare the energies of FCTO\u00f0D\u00de and FBFO\u00f0D\u00de obtained by minimizing U\u00f0D\u00deBFO and U\u00f0D\u00deCTO to determine the most stable phase at fixed D field. Again, the relative stability between BFO-type and CTO-type structures can be evaluated by \u0394F\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc FBFO\u00f0D\u00de\u2212 FCTO\u00f0D\u00de. The resulting phase diagram as a function of D field is presented in Fig. 1(b), in which DFT results again show a reasonable agreement with our model Hamiltonian predictions. The BFO-type structure is gradually favored with the increased D field as indicated by the rapidly dropping value of \u0394F\u00f0D\u00de. The BFO-type becomes the stable structure when the critical D field (D \u223c 0.4 C=m2) is reached in CdHfO3. In order to unravel the microscopic origin of the stabilized BFO-type structure under D field, we again perform a rigorous decomposition of the free energy changes into contributions from elastic, rotations, and electric polar ordering energies as \u0394F\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc \u0394FRot\u00f0D\u00de \u00fe \u0394FElas\u00f0D\u00de \u00fe \u0394F\u00f0A\u00deFE\u00f0D\u00de as shown in Fig. 3. The elastic energy contribution \u0394FElas\u00f0D\u00de to the free energy change is a rather flat dispersion in Fig. 3(b) due to the similar elastic constants of the BFO-type and CTO-type structures, which contributes little to stabilization of BFO-type structure under the applied D field. Under the applied D fields, the FE mode develops along the [001] field direction. In typical perovskites, the polar distortion is in strong competition with octahedral rotation\nand tilt [63,64]. Therefore, the octahedral rotation and tilt are gradually suppressed as a function of increased D field. In both CTO-type and BFO-type structures, the diminished octahedral rotation and tilt are reflected by the rapidly increased energy in Fig. 3(a), however, with similar variations in both types of structures. Therefore, the energy associated with oxygen octahedral rotations and tilts \u0394FRot\u00f0D\u00de does not contribute significantly to the stabilized BFO-type structure either. We next draw our attention on the free energy changes of \u0394F\u00f0A\u00deFE\u00f0D\u00de associated with the FE and AFE orderings. Under the applied D field, the CTO-type structure with improper AFE becomes more unstable because the aforementioned suppressed oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt modes make the trilinear coupling d1\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deRIT AFExy energetically unstable. On the country, the four-linear coupling energy \u03b41\u00f0f\u03b7ig\u00deROT FEzFExy behind the improper FE in BFO-type structure becomes more favorable because of the promoted FE mode along the [001] D-field direction. As a result, \u0394F\u00f0A\u00deFE\u00f0D\u00de undergoes a drastic drop under D field as shown in Fig. 3(c), and thus plays an important role to stabilize the BFO-type structure. For the thin film or superlattices grown by epitaxial strain technique, both the applied strain and the electric field on the perovskite should be kept as small as possible in order to ensure a coherent growth and to avoid the electrical breakdown. While the above requirement might be difficult to achieve by relying on one single approach, a combined engineering method by both mechanical and electric conditions should provide a more effective way to reduce the critical fields in both directions. As shown in Fig. 1(c), we present the phase diagram predicted by models as functions of both epitaxial stain (\u03b7\u0304) and D field. The blue and orange region indicate that the stable structure are the CTO-type and BFO-type, respectively. The critical epitaxial strain and D field to stabilize the BFOtype structure are as large as \u03b7\u0304 \u00bc 2.3% and D \u00bc 0.4 C=m2. However, with combined boundary conditions,\n197601-4\nour preliminary studies by the model found that the critical conditions can be reduced to \u03b7\u0304 \u00bc 1.6% and D \u00bc 0.24 C=m2. We then generalize the above design mechanism to the\nwidely spread CTO-type perovskite materials in nature. We propose that there are two prerequisites. First, the perovskite should have a hidden polar instability in addition to the oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt, which can be screened by the calculated phonon dispersion for at the high-temperature cubic phase. In CdHfO3, the three lowest unstable phonon modes are identified to at the \u0393 (\u03c9 \u00bc 149i), M (\u03c9 \u00bc 337i), and R (\u03c9 \u00bc 327i), points of the Brillouin zone, which give rise to the polar, in-phase oxygen octahedral rotation, and out-of-phase oxygen octahedral tilt distortions, respectively. At ground state CdHfO3 adopts the CTO-type structure with the hidden polar instability, FE ordering becomes a competing structure which can be stabilized under certain mechanical and electric boundary conditions. Second, the BFO-type structure should be a high-lying metastable state with the small energy barrier related to the ground-state CTO-type structure. For CdHfO3, the total DFT energy difference between the CTO-type and BFO-type structures is only \u223c10 meV=formula, which indeed facilities the stabilization of its metastable phase. With the above two guidelines, we have done a survey on\nthe database of perovskites with CTO-type as a ground state structure [53]. We have identified 9 perovskites that have intrinsic polar instabilities in their cubic phases. We then further employ the genetic evolutionary algorithm [54] to determine their potential metastable structures as well as their energetics and 7 of 9 perovskites are found to have BFO-type structure as the lowest-energy metastable phase. All the CTO-type perovskites with potential to convert BFO-type ferroelectrics are shown in Table SVII in the Supplemental Material [40]. We first stabilize the BFO-type structure by gradually increasing the magnitudes of tensile strains. As presented in Table SVII [40], all the seven perovskites can be stabilized into BFO-type structures if the applied tensile strain is large enough. We then proceed to apply the proper electric boundary conditions to stabilize the BFO-type structure. In particular, we carry out constrained D-field DFT calculations for CdSnO3 and NaMnF3, which are presented in Figs. S2(a) and S2(b) [40]. Both CdSnO3 and NaMnF3 can be stabilized to be the BFO-type structure with D \u00bc 0.25 and D \u00bc 0.17 C=m2, respectively. By combining the mechanical and electric boundary conditions, the critical strain and D field required to stabilize the BFO-type structure can be both further optimized. Our first-principles calculations show that as large as D \u00bc 0.50 and D \u00bc 0.50 C=m2 are required to stabilize BFO-type structure in CaHfO3 and CaZrO3 by using applied D field only, which are presented in Figs. S3(a) and S3(b) [40]. However, the critical D fields are largely reduced to D \u00bc 0.28 and\nD \u00bc 0.25 C=m2, respectively, for CaHfO3 and CaZrO3 under 2% epitaxial stain. In summary, a number of BFO-type ferroelectric and multiferroic perovskite materials have been successfully designed through epitaxial strain and D-field boundary conditions. These stabilized single-phase BFO-type perovskites can be used for engineering applications under ambient condition, which is more practical compared to other strategies such as high pressure, chemical substitution, and interfacial engineering. Moreover, the CTO-type LuFeO3 possesses a high-temperature antiferromagnetic order [60], therefore, the stabilized high-polar LuFeO3 may be another multiferroic material like BFO. In the future, the studies of the phase stability by the DFT-based effective Hamiltonian approach in current work can be systematically improved by the inclusion of higher-order invariants as well as the gradient invariants in the calculation of the free energy.\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation through Grants No. DMR-2053195 (X.W.).
