            "text": "With the renement of the theory of atomic spectroscopy, researchers have achieved the preparation of supercooled atoms, thus achieving the manipulation and imprisonment of atoms.1\u20133 The preparation of supercooled molecules has also attracted the interest of many researchers. Ultracold molecules can be used in many research areas, such as quantum computing,4 measurements,5,6 dynamics7 and ultracold chemistry.8 More importantly, the potential applications of ultracold molecules are quite attractive, for example, strong interactions of quantum gases, the storage and processing of quantum information, precise control of molecular dynamics, molecular clocks, etc. Due to the complex internal structure of molecules, the spectroscopic properties of their ground and low excited states must be investigated to achieve the preparation of supercooled molecules. Not all molecules can be laser cooled and prepared, and a suitable system must have a highly diagonally distributed Franck\u2013Condon factors that keeps the molecular leap in a near-closed loop. The very short energy level lifetime of the electronically excited state ensures that laser cooling can be performed efficiently.9\u201311 In a circulating system\n, China.

Therefore, it is particularly critical to nd leptons with a high diagonalized Frank\u2013Condon factors as well as a short radiation lifetime.\nIn 2010, Shuman12 at Yale University reported an experiment using three laser beams to prepare SrF molecules with temperatures close to supercooling, which rst conrmed the feasibility of using lasers to cool molecules directly in experimental. The success of experimental laser cooling of neutral molecules has led many researchers to turn their attention to anions and cations, and people have begun to investigate whether cations are also capable of laser cooling, so that the spectroscopic and transition properties of cations can be studied. The spectroscopic properties of molecules with the same electronic structure as SeBr+ have also been extensively studied. NCl,13 PCl,14 AsCl,15,16 SbCl,17 AsI,18,19 SbBr,20 SbI21 all have the same electronic state structure as SeBr+, which means they may have similar spectroscopic properties. For SCl+ of the samemain group, Lu et al.22 calculated the spectroscopic data of the ground and low excited states of this ion, detailed potential energy curves in the U state and the potential laser-cooled transition in the U state. Wang et al.23,24 calculated the spectroscopic data of SeCl+ and TeCl+ in the L\u2013S state as well as in the U state, compared in detail the spectroscopic properties in the presence of the same main group of ions, and concluded from detailed calculations that direct laser cooling of SeCl+ and TeCl+ is not feasible. Meanwhile, molecules with the same electronic state structure and the same potential energy curve trend as SeBr+ have also been extensively studied, and Belinassi25 investigated the transition properties between the ground state to the lower excited state of the SeI molecule.

However, the spectroscopic properties and transition properties of SeBr+ are rarely reported, so this paper will investigate the spectroscopic properties and transition properties of SeBr+ and discuss the feasibility of using laser cooling of SeBr+. Discuss the phenomenon of avoided crossing in the U states, which means that the potential energy curves of two states with the same symmetry cannot intersect in a diatomic molecule. Since the relative atomic masses of both selenium and bromine are large, the spin\u2013orbit coupling effect is not negligible. The phenomena of avoided crossing in the U state will also be more complicated. The obtained calculation results will be compared with ions of the same main group to analyze the similarities and differences of the spectroscopic properties. This would be the rst report on SeBr+ molecular spectroscopy data, bridging the experimental and theoretical void.\nIn this paper, we present the research work in the following sections: the calculation details are shown in Section 2, the results and discussions are shown in Section 3, and the conclusions are shown in Section 4."

Due to the restriction of the Molpro program, the symmetry is reduced to the C2n subgroup in the calculation of this paper. Single point energy calculations were performed for SeBr+ between the nuclear bond lengths R = 1.5\u20137 A\u030a. In order to make the data of the obtained potential energy curves smoother, we took a step of 0.02 A\u030a around the equilibrium nuclear bond length.\nIn the calculations, the initial guessed molecular orbitals and wave functions of the ground state of the SeBr+ ion were rst obtained using the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) method.28,29 On this basis, we used the state-averaged complete active space selfconsistent eld (SA-CASSCF)30,31 for optimization to obtain the state-averaged multistate wave functions. The internally contracted multi-reference conguration interaction method (icMRCI)32,33 was then used to calculate the correlation energy, and the Davidson correction (+Q) was included for optimization. To improve the accuracy of the potential energy curves for the L\u2013S and U states, the aug-cc-pVQZ-PP basis set34 was used for both Se+ and Br. The choice of these basis sets implies that a relativistic effective core potential is used in this paper when considering scalar-relativistic effects. In the CASSCF calculation, for SeBr+, we chose 8 molecular orbitals (4, 2, 2, 0) as the active orbitals, denoted as CAS(12,8). These 8 molecular orbitals\ninclude the 4s4p orbital of Se+ and the 4s4p orbital of Br. In the calculation of MRCI+Q, we consider the CV correlation effect, where the 3d orbitals of Se+ are used as the correlation level. When considering the spin\u2013orbit coupling effect, the spin\u2013orbit matrix elements and eigenstates are calculated using the spin\u2013 orbit pseudopotential.\nWith our obtained L\u2013S and U state potential energy curves and calculated transition dipole moments, the one-dimensional radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved using the LEVEL 8.0 program35 to obtain the equilibrium nuclear bond lengths (Re), harmonic frequency (ue), rst anharmonic correction (uece), rotation constants (Be) and vertical transition energies (Te) of the bound states.\nTable 4 Main CSFs around the Re of SeBr +\nL\u2013S states Main CSFs at Re (%)\nL\u2013S states Main CSFs at Re (%)\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The electronic states corresponding to the two dissociation limits and the energy difference between them and the experimental value are listed in Table 1. The difference between the second dissociation limit and the experimental value is 123 cm\u22121, and this result can well reect the accuracy of the calculation results in this paper. The calculated potential energy curves are shown in Fig. 1, where the phenomenon of avoided crossing in both the singlet and triplet states, 31P and 11F, 43P and 13F, respectively, occurring at about 2.5 A\u030a of the nuclear bond length. Since the energies of 13D and 13S+ are very close, their potential energy curves are not easy to identify. 13D and 13S+ come from the same symmetry and from the same dissociation limit, which means that the spectroscopic properties of these two electronic states are very similar. From the potential energy curves obtained, it can be seen that most of the electronic states are bound and a smaller fraction of them are repulsive.\nBased on the obtained potential energy curves, we tted the spectroscopic data of the bound states and show some of them in Table 2. (The spectrum data of all electronic states are shown in Table SI1.\u2020) We will focus on the analysis of the rst three electronic states in comparison with the electronic states corresponding to the ions of the same main group.

The equilibrium bond lengths of SCl+,22 SeCl+,23 TeCl+24 show an increasing trend, while the rest of the spectrum constants show a decreasing trend. The equilibrium bond lengths of the low excited electronic states of SeBr+ are larger than those of SeCl+ and smaller than those of TeCl+. This phenomenon is consistent with the fact that the relative molecular mass of SeBr+ is between SeCl+ and TeCl+. Besides, the rest of the spectrum constants of SeBr+ are smaller than those of SCl+, SeCl+ and TeCl+. Comparing the vertical transition energies of 11D and 11S+, we found that the overall vertical transition energies of SeCl+ are smaller compared with SCl+, SeCl+, TeCl+. For some neutral molecules with similar electronic state structures as SeBr+, the vertical transition energies from the ground state (X3S\u2212) to the rst (11D) and second (11S+) excited states of SbBr36 and AsBr26 are smaller than those of SeBr+, a property similar to that of ions of the same main group. Besides, the spectrum properties of 13D and 13S+ are very similar, and the difference between the values of various spectrum data is very small.\nThe main electronic congurations at the equilibrium bond lengths are listed in Table 4.

These atomic states correspond to six different dissociation channels, namely: Se+(4S3/2) + Br( 2P3/2), Se+(4S3/2) + Br( 2P1/2), Se +(2D3/2) + Br( 2P3/2), Se +(2D5/2) + Br( 2P3/2), Se+(2D3/2) + Br( 2P1/2), Se +(2D5/2) + Br( 2P1/2). The energy values corresponding to these dissociation channels as well as the experimental values are shown in Table 5. With the increase of the relative atomic mass of the elements, the effect of the spin\u2013 orbit coupling effect will have an obvious inuence on the spectrum properties, and it can be found that the calculation results in this paper are relatively reliable according to the comparison of the calculated and theoretical values. The potential energy curves are difficult to identify because of the small difference in energy between the second and third dissociation channels. The same property occurs between the fourth and h dissociation channels.\nThe potential energy curves of the electronic states corresponding to these dissociation channels are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the gure, there is a complex phenomenon of avoided crossing in the U state. For the U = 0+ state, the phenomenon of avoided crossing occurs mainly in the region between 20 000 cm\u22121 and 35 000 cm\u22121 of energy. The phenomenon of avoided crossing between (3)0+ and (4)0+ is most evident at the nuclear bond length of 2.6 A\u030a. The phenomenon of avoided crossing for the electronic states with U = 0\u2212 occur mainly between (2)0\u2212 and (3)0\u2212, and (7)0\u2212 and (8) 0\u2212. For the electronic state with U = 1, there is a very complex phenomenon of avoided crossing, which occurs mainly around 25 000 cm\u22121 to 30 000 cm\u22121. This phenomenon occurs mainly between nuclear bond lengths of 2.5\u20133 A\u030a and is more pronounced between some electronic states, for example, between (5)1\u2013(9)1. The phenomenon of avoided crossing between (3)2 and (4)2, (5)2 and (6)2 is very obvious and occurs near the nuclear bond length of 3 A\u030a. For the rest of the electronic states with U = 2, it is not easy to observe the phenomenon of avoided crossing, so it will not be discussed in detail. For the state U = 3, 4, there is no obvious phenomenon of avoided crossing, so we will not discuss it in detail. Based on the obtained potential energy curves, we obtained the spectroscopic data of some of the lower excited states by solving the onedimensional radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation and show them in Table 6. The vertical transition energy from the rst excited state(X3S\u22121 (1)1) to the ground state \u00f0X3S 0\u00fe\u00f01\u00de0\u00fe\u00de is 418 cm\u22121, compared with 13 cm\u22121, 191 cm\u22121, and 965 cm\u22121 for SF+,37 SeCl+,23 and TeCl+24 of the same main group, respectively. It can be noticed that this value becomes larger and larger as the relative atomic mass increases. The vertical transition energy of 11D2(1)2 also changes somewhat, with a value of 5733 cm\n\u22121 in the L\u2013S state and 6074 cm\u22121 in the U state. The change in this value indicates that the spin\u2013orbit coupling effect has some\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ninuence on SeBr+.

In this paper, the SO matrix elements between the SeBr+ electronic states are calculated and the strength of the spin\u2013 orbit coupling interaction is determined by their magnitudes, and the possible 29 SO matrix elements between the calculated electronic states are listed in Table SI3.\u2020 SO1 and SO2 denote the SO matrix elements between the two components of 11P and 13S+ so they are equal in size. Similarly, SO3 = SO4, SO5 = SO6, SO7 = SO8, SO9 = SO10, SO11 = SO12, SO13 = SO14, SO15 = SO16, SO17 = SO18, SO19 = SO20, SO21 = SO22, SO23 = SO24, SO25 = SO26, SO27 = SO28. The variation of the obtained SO matrix elements with the nuclear bond length is shown in Fig. 5. As a whole, the values of SO1, SO3, SO19, SO21 and SO25 are relatively small, while the rest of the values other than these are relatively large, with the maximum even reaching 1200 cm\u22121, which is sufficient to show that the rest of the states in the spin\u2013 orbit coupling effect are more affected. To ensure the accuracy of the calculation results, the possibility of laser cooling of SeBr+ under the effect of spin\u2013orbit coupling will be discussed in this paper."

            "text": "Based on the obtained potential energy curves and the calculated transition data, we used the LEVEL 8.0 program to calculate the Franck\u2013Condon factors between some electronic states of SeBr+, the radiative lifetimes, and the Einstein coefficients. The conditions that enable laser cooling of the molecule are a high diagonalized Franck\u2013Condon factor and a short radiation lifetime, so it is particularly critical to rst determine which electronic states can satisfy these conditions between them. For X3S\u22121 (1)1, the difference between the equilibrium bond length and the ground state \u00f0X3S 0\u00fe\u00f01\u00de0\u00fe\u00de 0.0007 A\u030a, which means that the Franck\u2013Condon factor between the two electronic states is large, but the vertical transition energy is only 418 cm\u22121, which means that the strength of the transition between the two electronic states is weak and therefore is not a suitable choice. The difference of the equilibrium bond length between 11D2(1)2 and the ground state \u00f0X3S 0\u00fe\u00f01\u00de0\u00fe\u00de is 0.0021 A\u030a and the vertical transition energy is 6074 cm\u22121. However, there is a forbidden barrier transition between the two states, so it does not constitute a circulating cooling system. For 21S\u00fe0\u00fe\u00f02\u00de0\u00fe, the difference in equilibrium bond length from the ground state is 0.0103 A\u030a and the vertical transition energy is 11 208 cm\u22121, which means that this is a potential transition capable of laser cooling. Therefore, in this paper, the Franck\u2013 Condon factor between X3S 0\u00fe42\n1S\u00fe0\u00fe , the radiation lifetime, and the Einstein coefficient are calculated. The calculated results are shown in Table 7, where we nd that there is a large\n33934 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 33928\u201333935\nFranck\u2013Condon factor between these two states, but the radiation lifetime is too long to constitute a recirculating cooling system. Therefore, we tentatively conclude that SeBr+ is not a suitable system for laser cooling."

            "text": "In this paper, the potential energy curves of 22L\u2013S states and 51 U states of SeBr+ were calculated using the ic-MRCI+Q method. Scalar relativistic effects, CV correlation effects and spin\u2013orbit coupling effects are taken into account in the calculations to ensure the accuracy of the results. The obtained potential energy curves were used to t the spectroscopic data of some of the low excitation bound states in the L\u2013S and U states using the LEVEL 8.0 program, and some similar properties were obtained by comparative analysis with the same main group of ions. The phenomenon of avoided crossing in theU state, which occurs mainly in the energy region from 20 000 cm\u22121 to 40 000 cm\u22121 and between the lower excited electronic states, is discussed in detail. In order to explore the transitional cycle system that can realize laser cooling, this paper calculates the transitional data between X3S 0\u00fe42\n1S\u00fe0\u00fe in the U state and obtains the Franck\u2013Condon factor, radiation lifetime and Einstein coefficient between the two states. According to the results of the current calculations, SeBr+ is not a suitable system for laser cooling. The calculated results will be useful for further study of laser cooling SeBr+ ions.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
